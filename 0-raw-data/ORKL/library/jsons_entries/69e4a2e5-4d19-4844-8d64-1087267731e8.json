Log4Shell ushered in a chaotic start  to 2022 and highlighted the positive impact of industry collaboration, as well as the criticality of patching and understanding the footprint of  widely used software in environments. \n\nLog4Shell was an edge case in terms of vulnerabilities disclosed in 2022, as threat actors\ncontinued to make use of known vulnerabilities, exploits and tools (e.g. Cobalt Strike) when\nconducting their attacks. However, throughout 2022 we also saw threat actors ranging in\nmotivation and sophistication employing enhanced tooling and frameworks, as well as\nmodifying their behaviours to outmanoeuvre security practices implemented by defenders.\nFurther, threat actors increasingly targeted cloud environments as well as identity and\nprivileged access capabilities in 2022.\n\nAs the Russian invasion escalated into full scale war, Ukraine along with other governments\nand cyber security organisations around the world tracked and responded to a series of\nsabotage efforts by Russia-based threat actors deploying multiple variants of wiperware.[1, 2, ]\n\n3 These sabotage attacks were largely contained within the immediate conflict zone, i.e.\nwithin Ukraine and territories annexed by Russia, and did not have the same level of impact\nas seen in 2015 and 2016 when Russia-based threat actors targeted Ukraine’s energy grid.\nWhilst multiple espionage motivated threat actors reacted and aligned to this worldchanging event, as seen through notable shifts in phishing and targeting operations, the\nwar prompted some cyber criminal threat actors and hacktivists (e.g. Blue Kurama a.k.a.\nKillnet) to react and respond in their operations and public statements, such as by declaring\n\n[1 ‘ESET Research jointly presents Industroyer2 at Black Hat USA with Ukrainian government representative’,](https://www.eset.com/int/about/newsroom/press-releases/events/eset-research-jointly-presents-industroyer2-at-black-hat-usa-with-ukrainian-government-representativ/)\n[ESET, https://www.eset.com/int/about/newsroom/press-releases/events/eset-research-jointly-presents-](https://www.eset.com/int/about/newsroom/press-releases/events/eset-research-jointly-presents-industroyer2-at-black-hat-usa-with-ukrainian-government-representativ/)\nindustroyer2-at-black-hat-usa-with-ukrainian-government-representativ/ (25th August 2022)\n[2 ‘NCSC advises organisations to act following Russia’s attack on Ukraine’, UK National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/organisations-urged-to-bolster-defences)\n(NCSC), https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/organisations-urged-to-bolster-defences (18th March 2022)\n[3 ‘Alert AA22-110A - Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal Cyber Threats to Critical Infrastructure’, US](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-110a)\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA), https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-110a (20th April 2022)\n\n1  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\npro-Ukraine or pro-Russia stances and targeting government and private sector entities\nperceived as opposition in the context of the war.\n\nIn addition to the Russian war in Ukraine, the cyber threat landscape in 2022 saw a\ncontinued optimisation and sophistication of China-based threat actor operations, although\nthe targets of these operations did not significantly change from those seen in prior years.\nThese threat actors increasingly employed obfuscation-as-a-service capabilities, including\nproxy networks (e.g. RedRelay) and shared malware, exploits and toolsets (e.g.\nShadowPad and ScanBox). The most prominent and prolific threat actor using these\ncapabilities was Red Scylla (a.k.a. CHROMIUM, ControlX, Earth Lusca, Aquatic Panda),\nwhich targeted at least 70 organisations around the world. Other threat actors flexed\nsophisticated operations impacting numerous regions, with some threat actors continuing\ntheir focus on the telecommunications sector.\n\nIran-based threat actors continued to make headlines in 2022 for their involvement in\nsabotage attacks against the Albanian government, their targeting of protesters and\ndissidents and sectoral targeting against organisations largely in the Middle East, Europe\nand the United States - activities which often aligned with priorities of the Iranian regime.\nNorth Korea-based threat actors doubled down on financial theft through their continued\ntargeting of financial services, cryptocurrency and decentralised finance (DeFi)\norganisations.\n\nOverall, the advanced persistent threats (APTs) we analysed in 2022 appeared to largely\nconform to previously observed targeting patterns despite continued efforts within corners\nof the international community to economically isolate their respective countries, although\nsome threat actors made significant advancements in their operations. Whilst we presume\nWestern-based actions occurred in 2022, we did not identify adequate evidence of these\nactivities, and therefore they are not covered extensively in this report.\n\nThe cyber criminal ecosystem also demonstrated operational enhancements in some\ncases, as well as new developments which challenged organisations around the world\nthroughout 2022. Whilst ransomware remained the top concern for many, we did see\nindications of a potential regroup or recalibration among some of the more prolific and\nprominent ransomware threat actors, and 2022 ended with a nearly identical number of\nleak site victims compared to 2021.\n\nOne of the most concerning threat actors with high profile victims in 2022 was White Dev\n111 (a.k.a. LAPSUS$ Group), which engaged in a string of “smash-and-grab” and “hackand-leak” operations against their targets. Many of these attacks used social engineering\nand other tactics to exhaust security measures and users employed by victim\n\norganisations. Cyber-enabled fraud was also rampant throughout 2022, further\nunderscoring the trend of threat actors commoditising access, exploits and tooling and\nlowering the barrier to entry for a wider range of cyber criminals.\n\n2  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### About us\n\nPwC serves more than 200,000 clients in 152 countries, and we use our vantage point as one of\nthe largest international professional services networks to provide global threat intelligence\nservices, tailored and delivered locally to our clients.

This urgency was further exacerbated by a proof of concept freely\navailable soon after the disclosure, providing instructions for exploiting this vulnerability and\nallowing for any type of attacker to remotely execute code on an impacted system.\nOrganisations scrambled to discover Log4j instances within their environments and Apache\nworked to develop a patch whilst threat actors began exploiting this opportunity within\nhours of the disclosure.[7]\n\n**Detecting Log4Shell exploitation**\n\nA simple, and broad, network detection option is to inspect all inbound traffic to exposed\nservers for the string ${jndi: - or to account for some common evasion techniques by\nlooking for ${ followed shortly by jndi.\n\nBy the end of December 2021, Apache released numerous updates to address Log4Shell.\nThe international security community and various government agencies also provided\ninformation regarding which versions of the popular software contained security fixes, as\nwell as which software still required attention.[8, 9] This collective effort likely made a\ndifference in quelling the chaos; however, threat actors still managed to exploit Log4Shell\nthroughout 2022, as well as the associated Log4j vulnerabilities CVE-2021-45046 and\n```\nCVE-2021-45105, discovered after initial remediation attempts were made.\n\n```\nSince the Log4Shell disclosure, dozens of espionage and financially motivated threat actors\nhave exploited this vulnerability across a variety of sectors.[10] In one example from 2022,\neight months after the Log4Shell disclosure, Yellow Nix (a.k.a. MuddyWater, MERCURY)[11]\n\n5 _Note: When originally discovered, Log4Shell impacted Apache Log4j versions 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1, and_\nsubsequent releases spawned additional vulnerabilities, remediated by version 2.17.0.

The invasion also set the stage for broader geopolitical\nimplications throughout 2022, such as additional countries requesting to join the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).[16]\n\nUkraine has been a persistent target for Russia-based threat actors throughout the past\ndecade, including numerous cyber attacks against the Ukrainian power grid in 2015 and\n2016.[17] Blue Echidna’s (a.k.a. Sandworm) NotPetya attacks were initially thought to be\nransomware deployed against a Ukrainian finance management application; however,\nNotPetya turned out to be destructive wiperware with devastating consequences for\ncompanies beyond Ukraine’s borders that used the targeted software.\n\nMemories of NotPetya weighed heavily as Russian wipers began propagating amongst\nUkrainian targets in January 2022 and continued during the initial months of the invasion,\nalthough the impact of these was contained and much more limited than expected due to\nthe efforts of Ukraine, other governments and security industry partners.[18] In particular,\nRussia-based threat actors focused on the Ukrainian Defence Ministry and PrivatBank,\nUkraine’s largest commercial bank, in the first days of the invasion.[19] Whilst many around\nthe world feared a major spillover of cyber activity outside of the conflict zone, as seen with\nNotPetya, this did not materialise by the end of 2022.\n\n15 _CTO-SIB-20220224-01A - Tensions escalate into invasion_\n16 _CTO-SIB-20221102-01A - NATO expansion - Finland and Sweden’s changing cyber threat landscape_\n17 _CTO-SIB-20220127-01A - Russia and Ukraine: on the brink_\n18 ‘ESET Research jointly presents Industroyer2 at Black Hat USA with Ukrainian government representative’,\n[ESET, https://www.eset.com/int/about/newsroom/press-releases/events/eset-research-jointly-presents-](https://www.eset.com/int/about/newsroom/press-releases/events/eset-research-jointly-presents-industroyer2-at-black-hat-usa-with-ukrainian-government-representativ/)\n[industroyer2-at-black-hat-usa-with-ukrainian-government-representativ/ (25th August 2022)](https://www.eset.com/int/about/newsroom/press-releases/events/eset-research-jointly-presents-industroyer2-at-black-hat-usa-with-ukrainian-government-representativ/)\n19 ‘Ukraine defence ministry website, banks, knocked offline’, Reuters,\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-reports-cyber-attack-defence-ministry-website-banks-tass-2022-02-](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-reports-cyber-attack-defence-ministry-website-banks-tass-2022-02-15/)\n[15/ (15th February 2022)](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-reports-cyber-attack-defence-ministry-website-banks-tass-2022-02-15/)\n\n8  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the following sections, we detail notable events and trends related to cyber threat actors\nand their activities leading up to and during the war, such as sabotage operations, phishing\noperations and intersections with cyber criminal threat actors and techniques.\n\nThe impact of threat actor operations had been anticipated, with numerous government\nagencies publishing mitigation advice that broadly countered the key tools, techniques and\nprocedures (TTPs) of threat actors like Blue Athena (a.k.a. APT28, FANCY BEAR) and Blue\n\n9  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nKitsune (a.k.a. APT29, COZY BEAR), as well as provided threat actor indicators.[20, 21] The\nprivate sector also contributed to these efforts, with examples from Mandiant[22] and\nDragos[23] demonstrating the collective support to defenders in exposing destructive\ncapabilities targeting operational technology (OT) systems.\n\n**Sanctions and responses from the West**\n\nWestern responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine included a series of sanctions and\nwidespread public condemnation. These sanctions have resulted in significant economic\n\nrepercussions for Russia, with a variety of sanctions being imposed on organisations and\nindividuals, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and other high ranking politicians and\n\nofficials. Immediately following the initial invasion, select Russian financial institutions were\nexcluded from the SWIFT network, the main global payment messaging system.\n\nUnion member countries, the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries further\nsanctioned Russia in the form of supply chain restrictions and other actions, whilst numerous\nforeign brands elected to pause or withdraw Russian operations due to ethical considerations\nand public sentiment.[26]\n\n#### For some strategic sectors, these restrictions have impacted Russia’s ability to access key components and technologies, and Russia has since begun investigating alternatives, such as replacement components and illicit supply chains. As Russia protracts its war and becomes increasingly isolated, we assess Russia-based, espionage motivated threat actors will likely pivot targeting objectives to support Russia’s domestic production capabilities through economic espionage, as well as to retaliate against organisations and countries which expressed solidarity with Ukraine.[27]\n\nIn our Looking ahead section later in this report, we explore how these scenarios may materialise\nand the implications for specific sectors and countries.\n\n20 ‘NCSC advises organisations to act following Russia’s attack on Ukraine’, NCSC,\n[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/organisations-urged-to-bolster-defences (18th March 2022)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/organisations-urged-to-bolster-defences)\n21 ‘Alert AA22-110A - Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal Cyber Threats to Critical Infrastructure’, CISA,\n[https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-110a (20th April 2022)](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-110a)\n22 ‘INCONTROLLER: New State-Sponsored Cyber Attack Tools Target Multiple Industrial Control Systems’,\n[Mandiant, https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/incontroller-state-sponsored-ics-tool (13th April 2022)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/incontroller-state-sponsored-ics-tool)\n23 ‘PIPEDREAM: CHERNOVITE’s Emerging Malware Targeting Industrial Control Systems’, Dragos,\n[https://hub.dragos.com/whitepaper/chernovite-pipedream (13th April 2022)](https://hub.dragos.com/whitepaper/chernovite-pipedream)\n24 ‘Joint Statement on Further Restrictive Economic Measures’, The White House,\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements- releases/2022/02/26/joint-statement-on-further-restrictive-](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/26/joint-statement-on-further-restrictive-economic-measures/)\n[economic-measures/ (26th February 2022)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/26/joint-statement-on-further-restrictive-economic-measures/)\n25 _CTO-SIB-20220228-01A - Implications of isolation_\n26 _CTO-SIB-20220825-01A - Sanctions and sectoral impact_\n27 _CTO-SIB-20220825-01A - Sanctions and sectoral impact_\n\n10  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sabotage operations and overlaps\n\nSabotage operations have been observed throughout the Russian war in Ukraine, ranging\nfrom information operations to destructive operations intended to degrade Ukrainian\ncommunications and systems. The attack on the Viasat satellite network in February 2022,\nattributed to Russia-based activity and coinciding with the onset of the Russian offensive,\nis a notable example of cyber threat actors tactically supporting kinetic operations with\nlonger term strategic implications.[28, 29, 30, 31]\n\nLeading up to the invasion, in late January and February 2022, we analysed samples of\nbomb threat emails to Ukraine’s security services, which we assess were likely from\nRussia-based threat actors intending to disrupt everyday activities in Ukraine.[32] Since late\nFebruary 2022, these information operations have extended more broadly to promote both\npro-Russia and pro-Ukraine narratives in a variety of channels, as seen prominently on\nsocial media.[33] Since the invasion, cyber-enabled information operations and other online\nactivities coincided with a resurgence in hacktivism.\n\n### Wipers\n\nNumerous Russia-based threat actors deployed destructive malware against Ukrainebased entities as the invasion persisted.[34] Through our analysis of available samples and\nresearch published by others in the security industry, we found examples of code overlaps\nand potential indicators of sharing across multiple Russia-based threat actors.

WhisperGate combines several attack stages consisting of a Master Boot\nRecord (MBR) overwrite and a file corruption stage.[39] When WhisperGate was first\ndiscovered, its behaviour and design initially suggested ransomware; however, unlike\nconventional financially motivated ransomware, WhisperGate’s corruption process is\nirreversible, indicating a sabotage intention rather than extortion. Further, the primary\ntargets of WhisperGate were Ukrainian government organisations, as well as at least\none technology firm known to provide services to the Ukrainian government.\n\n\n**_Hermetic wiper_**\n\n\nCoinciding with Russia’s invasion, we analysed Hermetic wiper following initial public\nreporting, and this wiper attempted to execute on Ukrainian infrastructure and,\nif successful, would wipe partitions of infected machines, rendering them inoperable.\nThe binary drops an EaseUS Partition file to conduct wiping activities but can also wipe\nfiles using the Windows application programming interface (API).[40]\n\n\n**_CaddyWiper_**\n\n\nIn mid-March 2022, security researchers discovered CaddyWiper executing on\nenvironments in Ukraine.[41] The wiper contained functionality to wipe files and eventually\nthe physical drive of all the drives mapped on the victim system if it was not the primary\ndomain controller. We assess the threat actor behind CaddyWiper likely manipulated\nthe rich header to cover up its original development fingerprint.[42] Other security\nresearchers linked CaddyWiper to the threat actor we track as Blue Echidna, known for\nmanipulating rich Portable Executable (PE) headers, for example in Olympic Destroyer.[43]\n\n38 ‘Destructive malware targeting Ukrainian organizations’, Microsoft,\n[https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/ (15th](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)\nJanuary 2022)\n39 _CTO-TIB-20220121-01A - The WhisperGate Wiper_\n40 _CTO-QRT-20220224-01A - Wiping and disruption in Ukraine_\n[41 @ESETResearch, Twitter, https://twitter.com/esetresearch/status/1503436420886712321 (14th March 2022)](https://twitter.com/esetresearch/status/1503436420886712321)\n42 _CTO-QRT-20220315-03A - CaddyWiper hits Ukraine_\n[43 ‘The devil’s in the rich header’, Kaspersky, https://securelist.com/the-devils-in-the-rich-header/84348/ (8th March](https://securelist.com/the-devils-in-the-rich-header/84348/)\n2018)\n\n12  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n**_ControlZero wiper_**\n\n\nIn mid-March 2022, we named a fourth wiper ControlZero (a.k.a. DoubleZero)[44] for its\nuse of the API call NtFsControlFile to wipe files, and assessed the wiper was likely used\nfor disruption events on Ukrainian networks. In our analysis, we observed ControlZero\nremoving registry keys from the affected system, and the system eventually prompted a\nrestart due to important system resources being modified.[45] From our observations,\nControlZero was the first wiper in 2022 to remove registry keys to cause further\ndisruption.\n\n\n**_StarWiper_**\n\n\nIn April 2022, we analysed another wiper we refer to as StarWiper (a.k.a. ACIDRAIN),[46]\nwhich appeared to target embedded devices rather than desktop devices due to its\nmicroprocessor without interlocked pipelined stages (MIPS) architecture. We connected\nthis wiper with low confidence to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, due to its usage of a\nfilename referencing a Russian language slur against ethnic Ukrainians. If StarWiper was\nindeed from the arsenal of wipers deployed by Russia-based threat actors against\nUkraine, StarWiper represented a shift in destructive malware, targeting embedded\ndevices rather than those previously observed targeting desktop devices.[47]\n\n\n44 ‘CERT-UA#4243 - Кібератака на українські підприємства з використанням програми-деструктора\n[DoubleZero’, Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA), https://cert.gov.ua/article/38088 (22nd](https://cert.gov.ua/article/38088)\nMarch 2022)\n45 _CTO-QRT-20220222-02A - ControlZero added to the wiper list_\n46 ‘AcidRain | A Modern Wiper Rains Down on Europe’, Sentinel One, https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-\n[modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe/ (31st March 2022)](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe/)\n47 _CTO-TIB-20220405-01A - StarWiper_\n\n13  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### Wipers we analysed (MITRE ATT&CK)\n\n**During our analysis of the five wipers we observed related to the Russian invasion of**\n**Ukraine–WhisperGate wiper, Hermetic wiper, CaddyWiper, ControlZero wiper and**\n**StarWiper–we mapped out the tactics (inner circle) and techniques (outer circle)**\n**employed by these wipers to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.**\n\nIn the below wheel, we visualise our detection coverage of these tactics and techniques–\naddressed through our threat intelligence reporting as well as our detection rules.

Whilst these\nactivities focused on Ukrainian government and military targets, Russia-based threat actors\nalso exhibited broader targeting in relation to their operations, some of which were exposed\nvia public disclosures. Russia-based threat actors rapidly responded to public disclosures\nof their activities, demonstrating their ability to adapt and continue effective operations\ndespite being actively pursued by both commercial and government security organisations.\nFor example, one day after the early March 2022 Google TAG[48] disclosure of infrastructure\nassociated with the threat actor we track as Blue Athena, the threat actor created new\nphishing domains, reusing code copied from its previous phishing sites.[49]\n\nIn another example of Russia-based threat actor phishing operations, Blue Callisto (a.k.a.\nCallisto Group) targeted a Ukrainian logistics and courier company, which had been\ndelivering humanitarian aid to Ukraine in addition to its commercial operations. Blue Callisto\nalso conducted credential harvesting campaigns against organisations in Europe and the\nUnited States, underscoring the threat actor’s dynamic operational portfolio likely at the\nbehest of the Russian government.[50 ]In December 2022, we identified evidence of Blue\nCallisto targeting other organisations supporting Ukraine, ranging from providing\nhumanitarian aid to Ukraine to investigating Russia’s actions in Ukraine.[51]\n\n**Tracking Blue Callisto infrastructure**\n\nIn April 2022, we analysed Blue Callisto (a.k.a. Callisto Group) domains and found a common\ninfrastructure pattern, further revealing a sprawling network of Blue Callisto infrastructure. We assess\nthe threat actor was likely using this infrastructure to conduct a Ukrainian military-themed phishing\ncampaign.[52] In September 2022, we identified further tracking techniques for Blue Callisto and its\ninterest in US-based laboratories.[53]\n\nRead more about Blue Callisto in one of our blog posts from 2022\n\nIn the course of our analysis into Blue Dev 4 (a.k.a. Ghostwriter, UNC1151), we identified a\nWord document which we assess to be likely associated with the threat actor due to its\nfilename including a Ghostwriter reference. The document contained a list of names and\nemails of specific individuals and organisations linked to the Ukrainian military, and we\nassess this list likely contained targets of interest to Blue Dev 4. The list included a website\n\n[48 'An update on the threat landscape', Google TAG, https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-threat-](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-threat-landscape-ukraine/)\nlandscape-ukraine/ (7th March 2022)\n49 _CTO-TIB-20220411-01A - Blue Athena 2022 phishing part 2_\n50 _CTO-SIB-20220908-01A - Ukraine Threat Update - August 2022_\n51 _CTO-SRT-20221213-01A - Blue Callisto targets Ukraine-linked organisations_\n52 _CTO-TIB-20220511-01A - Tracking Callisto infrastructure_\n53 _CTO-TIB-20220913-02A - Blue Callisto still phishing_\n\n15  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nowner for a Ukrainian military uniform, equipment and accessories store; Military Unit\nA1965, Ukrainian Naval forces based in the Zaporizhzhia region; several researchers\naffiliated with Ukrainian defence institutes; and, a Ukrainian reservist based in the Vinnytsia\nregion.[54] Targeting we attributed to Blue Dev 4 revealed a combination of approaches, from\nwidespread and opportunistic targeting of varieties of victims to persistent, ongoing efforts\nto compromise specific targets of interest.\n\nWe also analysed Blue Otso (a.k.a. Gamaredon Group) phishing activities seen in January\n2022. As tensions escalated between Russia and Ukraine leading up to the invasion, Blue\nOtso used Sievierodonetsk- and Crimea-themed lures in weaponised documents in its\nspear phishing operations, leading to self-extracting archives and UltraVNC binaries. Both\nSievierodonetsk and Crimea hold geopolitical significance, as the former is a city\nstrategically located in Luhansk outside what had been Russia-backed separatist LPR\nterritory, and the latter has been under Russian annexation since 2014.[55] In late 2022, Blue\nOtso reverted to registering domains using an email we first attributed with its operations in\n2020, and the registered domains were themed toward Ukraine’s State Special\nCommunications Service; however, the domains were in a different format when compared\nto previous Blue Otso activity. Throughout 2022, Blue Otso registered domains likely\nthrough an automated process using wordlists with no particular theme.[56] It is also likely\nBlue Otso maintained separate clusters of activity controlled manually as well as\nautomated. Blue Otso’s infrastructure management diversified in 2022 and became more\ndynamic than seen in prior years, and its command and control (C2) domains changed daily\nto resolve to new IP addresses.\n\n### Circling the cyber crime wagons\n\nThe Russian war in Ukraine shone an additional spotlight on Eastern European cyber\ncriminals and how they would respond to the war, particularly where they would align their\nallegiance. Prior to the invasion, in mid-January 2022 the Russian government announced\nits arrests of 14 individuals allegedly associated with White Ursia, the threat actor in control\nof the ransomware affiliate programme known as REvil or Sodinokibi. This announcement\nprompted some cyber criminals to reconsider their targeting, as at least one of those\narrested was noted as also being responsible for the May 2021 ransomware attack on USbased Colonial Pipeline, attributed to White Apep (a.k.a. DarkSide, BlackMatter).[57]\n\nFollowing Russia’s offensive into Ukraine in February 2022, cyber criminals grew more\nconcerned about sanctions impacting their ability to extort, launder and cash out funds\nfrom their illicit activities,[58] but in general cyber crime continued as normal.\n\n54 _CTO-QRT-20220303-01A - Blue Dev 4 phishing operations in 2022_\n55 _CTO-TIB-20220203-01A - Blue Otso retains Ukraine interest_\n[56 ‘ACTNIUM targets Ukrainian organizations’, Microsoft, https://www.microsoft.com/en-](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/02/04/actinium-targets-ukrainian-organizations/)\nus/security/blog/2022/02/04/actinium-targets-ukrainian-organizations/ (4th February 2022)\n57 _CTO-SIB-20220211-01A - White Ursia, from Unknown to under the bus_\n58 _CTO-SIB-20220915-02A - Tales from the crypto_\n\n16  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nIn February 2022, the Conti ransomware brand, operated by Blue Cronus, declared its\nsupport for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and threatened to target critical infrastructure of\ncountries targeting Russia via threats posted directly on its leak site.

ALPHV-ng,\nBlackCat), stressed their motivations were purely financial and expressed a degree of\nneutrality concerning the war.[61] Regardless of their ideological stances, we assess Russiabased ransomware threat actors are likely in the position to be co-opted or coerced by the\nRussian government to conduct operations in support of Russia.\n\n59 ‘To HADES and Back: UNC2165 Shifts to LOCKBIT to Evade Sanctions’, Mandiant,\n[https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/unc2165-shifts-to-evade-sanctions (June 2022)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/unc2165-shifts-to-evade-sanctions)\n60 ‘Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC Threat Intelligence\n[https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-report-download.pdf)\nreport-download.pdf (28th April 2022)\n61 _CTO-SIB-20220301-01A - Cyber criminal and hacktivist response_\n\n17  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nAs financially motivated threat actors waded into or avoided narratives involving the war,\nhacktivism-inspired threat actors and interlocutors surfaced, adding further complexity to\npro-Russia and pro-Ukraine information operations.

NB65).[65] Killnet, the pro-Russia hacktivist collective that we track as\nBlue Kurama,[66] gained notoriety for its multiple distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks\nagainst critical infrastructure in Lithuania, high profile public and private institutions in\nNorway,[67] Latvia’s Parliament and Estonian public websites.[68] Blue Kurama’s operations\nwere notable in 2022, as their DDoS targets included public and private organisations\ncritical of Russia’s actions and located outside of the immediate conflict zone; however, we\nfound the effectiveness of Blue Kurama’s campaigns, whilst widely publicised, were usually\nlow impact compared to other types of cyber attacks.[69]\n\n**The bluster of Blue Kurama**\n\nBlue Kurama (a.k.a. Killnet) is just one example of “patriotic hacking groups” that emerged during\n\nthe war in Ukraine and which supported either pro-Russia or pro-Ukraine interests. Blue Kurama\nspecifically aligned its support to Russia.[70] The threat actor primarily engaged in DDoS attacks\nagainst Ukrainian targets and public and private organisations, especially those tied to critical\ninfrastructure and defence, from countries considered acting against Russian interests (e.g.\nRomania,[71] Italy,[72] Lithuania, Norway[73] and the United States[74]). Blue Kurama initially formed as a\nDDoS-for-hire capability in January 2022 and was founded by an individual with the online\nmoniker Killmilk, who claimed to be a Russian national based in Russia. As Blue Kurama\ntransitioned from its for-hire model to conducting attacks, the threat actor facilitated its\noperations and recruitment primarily through Russian language Telegram channels. On a number\nof public forums, it was reported Blue Kurama conducted DDoS attacks using Mirai botnets in\n2022. In May 2022, Blue Kurama found itself on the receiving end of purported attacks launched\nby Grey Ares (a.k.a. Anonymous).[75]\n\n#### Overall, Blue Kurama’s attacks, if successful, were largely short lived and did not result in significant or sustained impact. However, the potentially disruptive and destructive nature of the threat actor’s attacks and intentions serves as a cautionary tale of a proliferation trend in hacktivism that may increase as the war continues, or as other conflicts arise.\n\n64 _CTO-SIB-20220301-01A - Cyber criminal and hacktivist response_\n65 _CTO-SIB-202220707-01A - Ukraine Threat Update - June 2022_\n66 _CTO-TIB-20221208-02A - Not cool Killnet_\n67 _CTO-SIB-202220707-01A - Ukraine Threat Update - June 2022_\n68 _CTO-SIB-20220908-01A - Ukraine Threat Update - August 2022_\n69 _CTO-TIB-20221208-02A - Not cool Killnet_\n70 _CTO-TIB-20221208-02A - Not cool Killnet_\n71 _CTO-WTU-20220505-01A - Ukraine Weekly Report_\n72 _CTO-WTU-20220513-01A - Ukraine Weekly Report_\n73 _CTO-SIB-20220707-01A - Ukraine Threat Update - June 2022_\n74 _CTO-SIB-20220804-01A - Ukraine Threat Update - July 2022_\n75 _CTO-WTU-20220526-01A - Ukraine Weekly Report_\n\n19  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n## China-based threat actors optimising operations\n\nThroughout the year, threat actors continued to coalesce around shared networks,\ninfrastructure and capabilities, often resulting in arguably more streamlined, expansive and\ntechnically sophisticated operations than those observed in previous years. Whilst this is a\ntrend we have been analysing for several years,[76, 77] in 2022 there was an observed spike in\nshared exploits and tools, including obfuscation-as-a-service proxy networks. Our analysis\nof threat actor targeting patterns further revealed country-specific targeting operations, as\nwell as a continued focus on digital supply chain and high technology compromises,\nnotably organisations within the telecommunications sector.\n\n#### Whilst these targets are not novel, China-based threat actors are increasingly optimising their operations and leveraging shared proxy resources, challenging conventional methods for attribution, incident response and damage assessments.\n\nAdditionally, starting in late 2021, we identified numerous instances involving multiple threat\nactors obfuscating implant payloads, highly likely employed to avoid detection and thwart\nanalysis. Significantly, Red Lich (a.k.a. Mustang Panda, Temp.Hex, TA416) used LLVMbased obfuscation of both its loader and inner PlugX payload during campaigns targeting\nentities in Europe. Whilst the usage of LLVM and other obfuscation techniques is not new,\nthis has usually only been applied on the loader components and not the payload itself.\n\nThis evolution further challenges attempts to identify and reverse engineer new and\nunknown payloads that would otherwise be detectable through YARA signatures, or\nthrough manual review using static and dynamic tools. By adding this extra layer of\nprotection to custom and bespoke tooling, attackers increase the longevity of their\ncampaigns in the face of improvements on the defensive side.\n\n#### We expect to see the trend of obfuscation and the protection of payloads continue and to improve at the operational level—where individual threat actors are employing obfuscation on custom implants, as well as at the developer level—where malware provided to threat actors is readily packaged or obfuscated by a quartermaster.\n\n76 ‘Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC Threat Intelligence, https://www.pwc.co.uk/cybersecurity/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf (17th December 2020)\n77 ‘Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC Threat Intelligence\nhttps://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threatsreport-download.pdf (28th April 2022)\n\n20  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### Red Scylla, a Winnti-linked global threat\n\nIn August 2022, we assigned Red Scylla (a.k.a. CHROMIUM, ControlX, Earth Lusca,\nAquatic Panda) to the activity we previously tracked as Red Dev 10,[78] largely due to our\nidentification of a distinctive set of infrastructure and techniques.[79] Red Scylla was arguably\nthe most prominent and prolific China-based threat actor in 2022, and given its global\ntargeting remit, optimised operational tempo and sophistication, we view Red Scylla as the\nmost active threat actor emanating from China.\n\n**Red Scylla targeting in 2022**\n\nWe observed Red Scylla scanning for vulnerabilities, using the open source tool Acunetix[80]\nand deploying a wide ranging post-compromise toolset which included both custom\nbackdoors and tools commonly shared among these threat actors, such as ShadowPad\nand PlugX. Since 2021, we have tracked Red Scylla as a ShadowPad[81] user, primarily\n\n78 Please see _Appendix B – Threat actor reference for more information about our naming convention._\n\n79 _CTO-TIB-20220825-01A - Red Scylla: A Winnti-Linked Global Threat_\n80 _CTO-TIB-20220621-01A - Red Dev 10 - Acunetix Scanning_\n81 ‘Chasing Shadows: A deep dive into the latest obfuscation methods being used by ShadowPad’, PwC Threat\n[Intelligence, https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/chasing-shadows.html (8th December](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/chasing-shadows.html)\n2021)\n\n21  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nthrough a custom obfuscation method we dubbed ScatterBee,[82] which uses control flow\nobfuscation, execution guardrails and runtime patching to obstruct forensic analysis. Red\nScylla targeted organisations from a global range of sectors, rapidly progressing from\nreconnaissance activities, gaining access to victim networks and deploying malware early\nin intrusions in a likely attempt to widen its foothold in victim environments.\n\nRed Scylla has not been the only threat actor deploying ShadowPad in the last year.\nThroughout 2022, ShadowPad was used among threat actors we already associated with\nthis malware family, as well as newly identified clusters of activity. During our tracking of\nShadowPad C2 infrastructure, we identified a new cluster based on associated\ninfrastructure management, which we now track as Red Dev 32.[83] We assess this threat\nactor likely shifted from PlugX to ShadowPad in June 2022, administering infrastructure\nthat served fake Microsoft Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates. Later in 2022, we\nidentified evidence of overlaps between Red Dev 32 and Red Scylla, such as Red Scylla\noperational relay boxes (ORBs) being used for testing activity with a Red Dev 32\nShadowPad C2. We assess it is highly likely these two threat actors share some form of\norganisational relationship. In October 2022, we further linked ShadowPad infrastructure to\nRed Dev 14, where multiple ShadowPad C2 hosts were serving a stolen, self-signed\ncertificate originally belonging to a Middle Eastern government entity.[84]\n\n**Defending against these TTP commonalities**\n\nGiven these TTP commonalities among China-based threat actors, defenders would be well\nadvised to monitor for LNK files with archive file targets and supplementary command lines\n(MITRE ATT&CK [T1204.002 - User Execution: Malicious File). Additionally, though the hijacked](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/)\n[applications vary, dynamic link library (DLL) side-loading (T1574.002 - Hijack Execution Flow:](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\n[DLL Side-Loading) remains a consistent technique seen across the infection chains for these](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\nthreat actors.\n\n### RedRelay, a shared proxy network\n\nThroughout 2022, we continued research into a proxy network, used by multiple threat\nactors, which we identified in 2021 and refer to as RedRelay. These threat actors had\nbegun moving to shared proxy networks over the past several years, and we assess these\nostensibly covert networks are likely operated in a quartermastering arrangement, through\nwhich tools are provisioned, sold and shared by a public or private entity. Proxy network\ncharacteristics, such as multihop proxying and facilitating communications over encrypted\nchannels, challenge traditional research methods for analysis and attribution. Proxy\nnetworks are also built using a combination of hundreds of threat actor-operated virtual\nprivate servers (VPS) and compromised devices.\n\n82 _CTO-TIB-20211021-01A - Chasing shadows_\n83 _CTO-TIB-20220913-01A - Red Dev 32_\n84 _CTO-TIB-20221005-01A - Not to worry; I have a certificate of authority_\n\n22  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nIn one example, we analysed the use of RedRelay by Red Vulture (a.k.a. APT15, APT25,\nKe3chang). Red Vulture used a specific cluster of RedRelay infrastructure throughout 2021\nand into early 2022. In March 2022, Red Vulture decommissioned and rebuilt this cluster\nbefore resuming its reconnaissance and exploitation activities against European\ngovernments, pan-European institutions and international organisations. This change\ndemonstrated Red Vulture’s proactive operational security (OPSEC) measures and mirrored\nwider shifts in RedRelay infrastructure management methods, which we observed in\nFebruary 2022.[85]\n\n### Country-specific targeting\n\nIn January 2022, we analysed malware communicating with C2 domains we attribute to\nRed Orthrus (a.k.a. Keyboy, TA428, Tropic Trooper), with this specific malware variant\nbeing a 64-bit version of the RAT known in open source as nccTrojan.[86] The lure themes of\nthe C2 domains present in these nccTrojan samples appeared to spoof organisations within\nthe Russian defence and manufacturing sectors; further, additional pivoting from\ninfrastructure known to be hosting nccTrojan domains revealed additional crossover\nbetween Russian-themed domains and Red Orthrus infrastructure. At some stage, all of\nthese domains were hosted on a Russia-based IP address, and we assess the threat actor\nlikely structured this intentionally to make the C2 traffic appear innocuous to the target.[87]\n\nWe assess these activities were likely indicative of intelligence collection as Russian forces\nmobilised ahead of the invasion into Ukraine.\n\nRed Phoenix (a.k.a. APT27, Emissary Panda, LuckyMouse) remained an ever-present and\nactive threat throughout 2022. In January 2022, Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection\nof the Constitution (BfV) released a public blog[88] providing technical details into the\noperations of this threat actor, as well as Red Phoenix’s targeting of German businesses. In\ntracking infrastructure and malware associated with the longstanding, custom malware\nfamilies HyperBro and FOCUSFJORD[89] attributed to Red Phoenix, we found the vast\nmajority of operations in 2022 targeted organisations based in the South China Sea region.\n\n85 _CTO-TIB-20220523-02A - Rampant Reconnaissance Redux_\n86 ‘China-linked TA428 Continues to Target Russia and Mongolia IT Companies’, Recorded Future,\n[https://www.recordedfuture.com/china-linked-ta428-threat-group (17th March 2021)](https://www.recordedfuture.com/china-linked-ta428-threat-group)\n87 _CTO-QRT-20220315-01A - Red Orthrus targets Russia_\n88 ‘Cyber attack campaign against German commercial companies’, BfV,\n[https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/DE/2022/2022-01-26-cyberbrief.html (26th January](https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/DE/2022/2022-01-26-cyberbrief.html)\n2022)\n[89 ‘Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC Threat Intelligence, https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf)\n[security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf (17th December 2020)](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf)\n\n23  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso in January 2022, we began tracking a significant regional targeting shift concerning a\ncampaign we assess is highly likely attributed to Red Lich (a.k.a. Mustang Panda,\nTemp.Hex, TA416). This particular campaign focused on European government and\ndiplomatic entities, whereas since 2020, Red Lich employed a broad targeting remit against\nvictims ranging from nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) to government entities across\nSouth and East Asia specifically, as well as internationally. In the first phase of this Europefocused campaign, beginning in at least January 2022 to late March 2022, Red Lich used\nRAR or ZIP archives, the titles of which used themes relevant to European affairs, specific\nCentral European countries and the Russian war in Ukraine.\n\n90 _CTO-TIB-20221102-01A - Rising from the hashes_\n[91 ‘LuckyMouse uses a backdoored Electron app to target MacOS’, Sekoia, https://blog.sekoia.io/luckymouse-uses-](https://blog.sekoia.io/luckymouse-uses-a-backdoored-electron-app-to-target-macos/)\n[a-backdoored-electron-app-to-target-macos/ (12th August 2022)](https://blog.sekoia.io/luckymouse-uses-a-backdoored-electron-app-to-target-macos/)\n92 _CTO-TIB-20221102-01A - Rising from the hashes_\n93 _CTO-TIB-20221102-01A - Rising from the hashes_\n\n24  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nThese archives contained a legitimate executable, which would download a decoy\ndocument to show the victim, as well as the Trident loader for PlugX, a benign executable,\na malicious DLL to be side-loaded and an encoded PlugX sample in a DAT resource.[94]\nBetween late March 2022 and late October 2022, Red Lich updated its TTPs in the context\nof its targeting of European entities, likely in an attempt to avoid detection, and possibly in\nresponse to public disclosure of the campaign.[95] The threat actor pivoted to using\ncompressed archives with malicious LNK files that would launch the Trident loader to run\nPlugX on victim machines. In the second phase of this campaign, Red Lich added further\nobfuscation and anti-analysis measures to its malware - including LLVM control flow\nflattening. Throughout this campaign, Red Lich primarily targeted Eastern and Central\nEuropean government entities involved in foreign affairs, as well as embassies and\nsupranational entities based in Belgium.\n\nIn yet another example of a capability shared among threat actors and being used in high\nprofile operations, we along with Proofpoint[96] analysed an espionage motivated ScanBox\ncampaign running from April 2022 through June 2022. ScanBox is a web reconnaissance\nand exploitation framework shared uniquely among China-based threat actors, and it has\nbeen in use sporadically since at least 2014. The 2022 campaign had an international reach\nbut with a specific focus against organisations in the Asia Pacific region, Australian\ngovernment and media entities and companies and countries with equities in the South\nChina Sea, including global heavy industrial manufacturers. We attributed this specific\ncampaign to Red Ladon (a.k.a. TA423, APT40, Leviathan). Red Ladon had previously used\nScanBox in 2018; in both the 2018 and 2022 campaigns, the threat actor crafted lures\naround national elections and established news-themed malicious websites to draw in\ntargets. In the 2022 campaign, Red Ladon transposed verbatim headlines concerning the\nMay 2022 Australian election from a UK-based news organisation onto a Red Ladoncontrolled website impersonating an Australian news media outlet.[97]\n\nLearn more about a related threat, Red Dev 26, in our talk at\nVirus Bulletin 2022\n\n94 _CTO-QRT-20220302-01A - Red Lich eyes Europe_\n[95 ‘Mustang Panda’s Hodur: Old tricks, new Korplug variant’, ESET,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/23/mustang-panda-hodur-old-tricks-new-korplug-variant/)\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/23/mustang-panda-hodur-old-tricks-new-korplug-variant/ (23rd March\n2022)\n[96 ‘Rising Tide: Chasing the Currents of Espionage in the South China Sea’, Proofpoint,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/chasing-currents-espionage-south-china-sea)\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/chasing-currents-espionage-south-china-sea (30th August 2022)\n97 _CTO-TIB-20220829-01A - Rising Tide_\n\n25  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### Persistent focus on telecommunications\n\nWhilst we have identified instances of threat actors targeting telecommunications providers\nfor a number of years, our research into 2022 activities against this sector revealed further\noptimisation efforts undertaken by several threat actors.[98]\n\n#### The implications for intrusions into telecommunications providers cannot be overstated: these activities undermine secure communications crossing countries, businesses and governments and threaten diplomatic, societal and business norms around the world.\n\nIn August 2022, we assigned Red Moros to the threat actor we previously tracked as Red\nDev 4 (a.k.a. GALLIUM) after our identification of the threat actor’s distinct TTPs,\nreconnaissance activities and C2 infrastructure and communications. Throughout 2022,\nRed Moros aggressively targeted telecommunications providers and government entities\naround the world, as well as a number of academic institutions. Our visibility into Red\nMoros’ activities revealed the threat actor using open source SoftEther virtual private\nnetwork (VPN) software, both offensively and as part of its infrastructure setup. We also\nidentified variants of a malware family known in open source as PingPull, which we assess\nis likely an evolved version of China Chopper malware.[99]\n\nFirst introduced in 2021,[100] Red Menshen remained active in 2022 targeting the\ntelecommunications and logistics sectors. Despite public disclosure of one of its most\ncommonly used malware families, BPFDoor, and a seemingly coordinated removal of a\nnumber of long running BPFDoor infections in August 2022, we have continued to observe\nRed Menshen accessing systems at previous victims as well as new targets.[101]\n\n[Read more about these threats in our TROOPERS22 talk synopsis](https://troopers.de/troopers22/talks/7cv8pz/)\n\n98 ‘U/OO/160405-22: People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Exploit Network Providers and\nDevices’, US government, https://media.defense.gov/2022/Jun/07/2003013376/-1/[1/0/CSA_PRC_SPONSORED_CYBER_ACTORS_EXPLOIT_NETWORK_PROVIDERS_DEVICES_TLPWHITE.PD](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Jun/07/2003013376/-1/-1/0/CSA_PRC_SPONSORED_CYBER_ACTORS_EXPLOIT_NETWORK_PROVIDERS_DEVICES_TLPWHITE.PDF)\nF (7th June 2022)\n99 _CTO-TIB-20220823-02A - Red Moros’ Reconnaissance_\n100 ‘Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC Threat Intelligence\n[https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-report-download.pdf)\n[report-download.pdf (28th April 2022)](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-report-download.pdf)\n[101 ‘Tinker Telco Soldier Spy’, PwC Threat Intelligence, https://troopers.de/troopers22/talks/7cv8pz/ (29th June](https://troopers.de/troopers22/talks/7cv8pz/)\n2022)\n\n26  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n## Iran’s internal and external challenges\n\n#### Throughout 2022, Iran-based threat actors continued to conduct espionage motivated attacks against victims in the Middle East, Europe and North America, and in some cases doubled down on destructive attacks that included wipers, ransomware and “hack-and-leak” attacks.\n\nWe also observed a focus expansion for Iran-based threat actors involving more domestic\nand regional targets, likely stemming from counterintelligence failures, domestic unrest and\na perceived need for retaliatory operations.\n\n### Sanctions and enablers of cyber operations\n\nMuch of the Western response to Iran’s transgressions in 2022 involved additional\nsanctions imposed on the regime. Iran was confronted with US sanctions[102] for its illicit\nactivities in four key areas: its involvement in sanction evasion networks to promote its\npetrochemicals sales; sales of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and weapons to Russia for\nuse in Ukraine; crackdowns on protesters and political dissidents, internet censorship and\nhuman rights abuses; and, offensive cyber operations. As Iran wrestled with continuing\neconomic and diplomatic isolation, Iran-based threat actors targeted sectors and regions\nwith direct and tangential connections to sanctions and formal rebukes of the regime. In\nsome cases, our analysis of Iranian offensive cyber operations in 2022 was supported by\nUS sanctions being levied against the same entities we analysed, such as Najee\nTechnology and Ravin Academy.\n\nIn September 2022, SECNERD, formally known as Najee Technology, was included in a list\nof Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)-affiliated entities sanctioned by the US\ngovernment for their roles in ransomware activities.[103] Earlier in the year, we had begun\ntracking infrastructure associated with SECNERD, a Farsi-language website purporting to\nprovide cyber security resources.[104] We identified direct infrastructure overlaps between\nSECNERD and Yellow Dev 24 (a.k.a. DEV-0270, Nemesis Kitten). We then tracked a\ncorporate trail connecting entities behind SECNERD, indicating associations with Iranian\ngovernment entities such as the IRGC, the Execution of Imam Khomeini’s Order (EIKO) and\nother sanctioned entities.[105]\n\nIn October 2022, the US government responded to Iran’s cyber operations and crackdown\non protesters by sanctioning several Iranian individuals, intelligence agencies and\n\n[102 ‘Iran Sanctions’, US Department of State, https://www.state.gov/iran-sanctions/ (23rd November 2022)](https://www.state.gov/iran-sanctions/)\n103 ‘Treasury Sanctions IRGC-Affiliated Cyber Actors for Roles in Ransomware Activity’, US Department of the\n[Treasury, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0948 (14th September 2022)](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0948)\n104 http://secnerd[.]ir, WayBackMachine (Archive), https://web.archive.org/web/20220223151704/http://secnerd.ir\n(6th April 2022)\n105 _CTO-TIB-20220517-01A - Get some better OPSEC nerd_\n\n27  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nostensibly NGOs, such as Ravin Academy.[106] Ravin Academy was founded in November\n2019, shortly after a series of leaks exposed its co-founders’ affiliation with Iran’s Ministry\nof Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Our analysis into Ravin Academy further revealed links\nto Yellow Nix, as well as professional links between Ravin Academy and Yellow Maero\n(a.k.a. APT34).[107]\n\n[Read more about Yellow Nix in one our blog posts from 2022](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/muddy-advanced-persistent-teacher.html)\n\n### Sabotage attacks\n\nIn July 2022, several MOIS-aligned threat actors were identified conducting sabotage\nattacks on Albanian government systems,[108] which involved reconnaissance and\nprepositioning before their deployment of wipers and ransomware.[109] We assess the\nattacks were almost certainly motivated by Albania hosting the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK).\nThe diplomatic fallout between Albania and Iran following these attacks was significant,\nwith Albania formally cutting ties with Iran. The Albanian government further considered\ncalling for Article Five of the NATO treaty, but ultimately decided to not escalate its conflict\nwith Iran any further. We found parallels between these attacks and those in January 2022\nagainst a US-based organisation for its connection to the MEK,[110] carried out by the IRGCaligned threat actor we track as Yellow Dev 19 (a.k.a. Emennet Pasargad).[111]\n\nIn their attacks on Albania, Iran-based threat actors[112] remained on Albanian government\nsystems for as long as 14 months, indicative of extensive prepositioning before conducting\ndestructive effects. This overall operation demonstrated threat actor persistence and\nhighlighted the trend of Iran-based threat actors employing both espionage and sabotage\n\n106 ‘Treasury Sanctions Iranian Officials and Entities Responsible for Ongoing Crackdown on Protests and Internet\nCensorship’, US Department of the Treasury, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1048 (26th October\n2022)\n107 _CTO-SIB-20220121-01A - Advanced persistent teacher_\n108 _Note: Microsoft assesses multiple Iranian threat actors participated in this attack under four different clusters of_\nactivity which we associate with Yellow Maero (a.k.a.

The threat actors gained initial access by exploiting an unpatched\nSharePoint server, dropped webshells, moved laterally with AnyDesk remote desktop and\nescalated privileges using built-in role groups for Microsoft Exchange. The threat actors\nthen leveraged those role permissions to exfiltrate emails using a bespoke tool just before\ndisabling endpoint defences and deploying both wipers and ransomware.[113]\n\nIran-based threat actors also continued their “hack-and-leak” or “lock-and-leak” operations\nagainst other organisations, seen previously in 2021 when the threat actor commonly\nreferred to as Moses Staff conducted “lock-and-leak” operations over a diverse range of\nsectors in Israel.[114] In the second half of 2022, a very similar threat actor emerged named\nAbraham's Ax, which claimed to have gained access to Saudi Ministry of Interior systems\nand posted both anti-West and anti-Israel messages on social media.[115] The modus\noperandi between Moses Staff and Abraham's Ax are nearly identical, and we identified\nnetwork infrastructure overlaps indicating the two threat actors are closely aligned.[116]\n\n### Domestic and dissident targeting\n\nOur analysis throughout the year indicated a continued trend of Iran-based threat actors,\nsuch as Yellow Garuda (a.k.a. Charming Kitten, APT42, PHOSPHORUS), focused on\ndomestic and dissident targets. Yellow Garuda targeted Farsi speakers, likely within Iran\nbut also possibly abroad, with a special focus on students, activists and purported\nmilitants. We analysed overlaps of activity occurring between September 2021 and June\n2022, with Yellow Garuda weaponising Microsoft documents using CVE-2021-40444 and\n```\nCVE-2022-30190. Based on compile times, Yellow Garuda was able to operationalise\n\n```\nthese exploits within one week after their public disclosure, providing a narrow window for\ndefenders to create effective detection and mitigation measures.[117]\n\nAmidst the protest activity in Iran in 2022 sparked by the September 2022 death of Mahsa\nAmini, a Kurdish Iranian woman arrested for violating hijab laws,[118] Iran-based threat actor\ntargeting continued to focus on a domestic audience, such as activists, dissidents and\nprotesters. Even with the breakout of widespread protests, Iran-based threat actors also\nmaintained their focus on standing priorities for the Iranian regime, which included\norganisations within the government, defence, telecommunications and energy sectors.[119]\nSimultaneously, Iran’s domestic surveillance apparatus continued its inward targeting,\nincluding through third party enablers and malware deployed against civilian mobile\n\n113 _CTO-TIB-20220916-01A – Iran-based APTs attack Albania_\n114 ‘Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC Threat Intelligence\n[https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-report-download.pdf)\nreport-download.pdf (28th April 2022)\n115 ‘Abraham’s Ax Likely Linked to Moses Staff’, Secureworks, https://www.secureworks.com/blog/abrahams-axlikely-linked-to-moses-staff (26th January 2023)\n116 ‘Iranian Hacking Group Abraham’s Ax claims hack on Saudi Ministry of Interior’, Cyberwarzone,\n[https://cyberwarzone.com/abraham-ax-saudi-ministry-interior-cyberattack/ (November 2022)](https://cyberwarzone.com/abraham-ax-saudi-ministry-interior-cyberattack/)\n117 _CTO-TIB-20220728-01A - Bye Follina_\n118 ‘UN rights chief says ‘full-fledged’ crisis underway in Iran amid crackdown on protesters’, CNN,\n[https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/24/middleeast/iran-protests-un-human-rights-council-intl/index.html (24th November](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/24/middleeast/iran-protests-un-human-rights-council-intl/index.html)\n2022)\n119 ‘Alert AA22-055A - Iranian Government-Sponsored Actors Conduct Cyber Operations Against Global\n[Government and Commercial Networks’, CISA, https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-055a (24th February](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-055a)\n2022)\n\n29  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\ndevices.[120] Yellow Dev 32 was one group focused on internal targets by deploying Android\nmalware called L3MON on protestors' phones in October 2022.[121]\n\n### Sector and regional targeting trends\n\nAnother trend concerning Iran-based threat actors seen across 2022 was their heavy\ntargeting of sectors in relation to shipping, logistics, maritime and critical infrastructure in\nEurope and the Middle East. Since at least May 2022, Yellow Liderc (a.k.a. Tortoiseshell,\nCURIUM) embedded JavaScript on legitimate websites that operate in the maritime,\nshipping and logistics sectors.[122] The script fingerprints website visitors by capturing user\nlocation, device information and timestamps of visits. Simultaneously, the threat actor\nregistered typosquatted domains masquerading as websites infected with malicious\nscripts. We assess Yellow Liderc likely used these typosquatted domains in conjunction\nwith user fingerprint data to launch tailored spear phishing attacks. Part of this activity\naligned with similar targeting reported in open source, which detailed how the threat actor\ntargeted shipping organisations in Israel between 2020 and 2022.[123] We further assess\nmuch of this activity likely related to the seizures of tankers flagged for carrying Iranian\ncrude oil, such as the vessel seized in the Mediterranean at the request of the US\ngovernment in May 2022.[124]\n\nIn early 2022, we identified instances of Yellow Garuda leveraging lures covering a variety\nof themes, including Turkey’s nuclear ambitions and US shipping ports. We considered the\npossibility that Yellow Garuda crafted the lures for targets in the wider Middle East, and\nthat the activity may not have been indicative of a campaign targeting energy sector\norganisations specifically. At least one US port-related lure document was likely targeted\nsince its format consisted of a letter with a named recipient.[125]\n\nWe also continued to observe Yellow Garuda targeting journalists, think tanks and\nresearchers using similar TTPs first seen in 2019, through our analysis of associated\ninfrastructure publicly disclosed in open source in January 2022.[126] We attributed the\ninfrastructure to Yellow Garuda and identified domains spoofing media organisations and\nthink tanks based in the United States, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Upon further\nanalysis, we identified the think tanks and journalists targeted as being notable experts of,\nor typically involved in, Middle East foreign policy, nuclear negotiations and other strategic\ninterests relevant to the Iranian regime. We also identified domains spoofing Google and\nMicrosoft accounts, along with more domestic focused targets aligning with typical Yellow\nGaruda victimology.[127]\n\n120 _CTO-TIB-20221206-01A - A sour L3MON and a FurBall_\n121 _CTO-TIB-20221206-01A - A sour L3MON and a FurBall_\n122 _CTO-TIB-20221208-01A - Yellow Liderc ships its scripts_\n123 ‘Suspected Iranian Actor Targeting Israeli Shipping, Healthcare, Government and Energy Sectors’, Mandiant,\n[https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-iranian-actor-targeting-israeli-shipping (17th August 2022)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-iranian-actor-targeting-israeli-shipping)\n124 ‘Iranian oil tanker’s cargo seized in Greece after US request’, AP News, https://apnews.com/article/russia[ukraine-politics-united-states-68af0db11c5c03e89049da0629ef4d85 (26th May 2022)](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-politics-united-states-68af0db11c5c03e89049da0629ef4d85)\n125 _CTO-TIB-20220308-01A - Charming Kitten's Turkish delight_\n126 ‘Shady Network of Fake Mossad Job Sites Targets Iranian Spies’, The Daily Beast,\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/shady-network-of-fake- mossad-job-sites-target-iranian-spies (24th January 2022)](https://www.thedailybeast.com/shady-network-of-fake-mossad-job-sites-target-iranian-spies)\n127 _CTO-TIB-20220302-01A - A busy bird that Yellow Garuda_\n\n30  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2022, Iran-based threat actors continued to target Israel-based organisations. In one\nexample, we analysed a GitHub account associated with Yellow Nix, and subsequently\nidentified a script within the account’s repository containing a C2 IP address. We attributed\nthe infrastructure to Yellow Nix and assessed it was highly likely used to target Israeli and\nTurkish organisations.[128] In another example, Yellow Nix targeted multiple Israeli insurance\ncompanies in November 2022 by leveraging a commercial remote administration tool called\nSyncro.[129]\n\n**Incident response case involving Yellow Liderc**\n\nEarly in 2022, we supported broader PwC incident response efforts involving a European\nengineering and manufacturing organisation targeted by Yellow Liderc (a.k.a. Tortoiseshell,\nTA456). Through our analysis of the sample executables provided by the victim, we found the\nthreat actor employing evolved tools and tradecraft, and we assess these shifts are likely\nindicative of Yellow Liderc attempting to enhance its operational security to evade detection and\nmaintain persistence in victim networks.\n\nWe analysed the functionality of three Python scripts obfuscated with PyArmor, a tool available in\nopen source for that exact purpose, as well as network traffic between the victim and the Yellow\nLiderc server. We found C2 communications beginning as early as January 2022 and continuing\n\nfor a period of at least four months. The highly obfuscated samples communicated over a secure\nmessaging protocol to dedicated mailboxes, all of which serve as an indicator of Yellow Liderc\n\nenhancing its operational security.[130]\n\nWhilst we often discover Iran-based threat actors through their poor operational security and use\nof known infrastructure and tools, this incident highlights the importance of not underestimating\n\nmotivated threat actors and their ability to evolve outside of assessed behaviours and\nboundaries. Our deep knowledge of threat actor motivations and TTPs allowed us to prioritise\n\nincident response efforts and provide substantive context to the victim for future planning.\n\n128 _CTO-TIB-20220210-01A - Smooth Operator_\n129 _CTO-TIB-20221206-02A - Let's Syncro up with Yellow Nix_\n130 _CTO-TIB-20220628-02A - Three varieties of Liderc_\n\n31  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n## Other regional case studies\n\nIn this section, we provide a sampling of other threat actors ranging in sophistication and\nmotivation.\n\n#### As in previous years, threat actor activities in 2022 aligned with real world events and reflected geopolitical circumstances, which in many cases appeared connected to political and national strategic objectives and priorities.\n\n### Black bag operations for the money\n\nOur research into activities concerning North Korea-based threat actors throughout 2022\nprimarily reinforced known trends, TTPs and victimology we had seen in previous years,\nsuch as the targeting of organisations within the financial services sector and\ncryptocurrency-affiliated companies,[131] as well as financially motivated attacks across\nnumerous other sectors. Based on targeting patterns we observed in 2022, we assess\nNorth Korea-based threat actors are highly likely continuing to respond to financial theft\ntasking on behalf of the government.\n\nWe continued to observe a high operational tempo attributed to financially motivated Black\nAlicanto (a.k.a. COPERNICIUM, DangerousPassword, CryptoMimic, CryptoCore, Operation\nSnatchCrypto) and Black Dev 2 (a.k.a. Operation Gold Hunting, Operation SnatchCrypto),\nwhich targeted cryptocurrency as well as venture capital and startup organisations in 2022.\nWe assess Black Dev 2 is likely linked to Black Alicanto, and since 2021, the two have\ntargeted victims with job-themed lures, as well as around opportunities for raising venture\ncapital in the cryptocurrency space.[132] Black Alicanto used Microsoft Software Installers\n(MSIs) in mid-to-late 2022 to achieve initial access and installation on victim systems, as\nopposed to its traditional use of malicious LNK files.\n\nBlack Artemis (a.k.a. Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, ZINC) remained very active, running\nmultiple campaigns throughout 2022. The threat actor continued its campaign known in\nopen source as “Operation Dream Job” and “Operation Interception” and which we track\nas ShowState, using the malware family known in open source as BLINDINGCAN.[133] Black\nArtemis’ continued use of malware implants like BLINDINGCAN and DTrack, deployed\nsince at least 2018 and 2014 respectively, demonstrates the threat actor’s proclivity to\ndevelop its existing codebase rather than abandoning it, in addition to adding new tools to\nits arsenal.\n\n131 _CTO-SIB-20220915-02A - Tales from the crypto_\n132 _CTO-TUS-20220616-01A - Threats under the Spotlight - May 2022_\n133 _CTO-TIB-20220812-01A - Black Artemis’ dream job hunt_\n\n32  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nBlack Artemis also continued to conduct espionage motivated targeting against defence\nand military entities, developing significant additions to its toolset and introducing malware\nfamilies like YamaBot and MagicRAT. Industry reporting concerning the threat actor’s\ntargeting of energy sector organisations[134, 135] has been particularly noteworthy and\ncomplemented our visibility into other aspects of Black Artemis activity.\n\n**Insights from PwC South Korea**\n\nIn the second half of 2022, PwC South Korea was alerted to the ransomware threat actor self\nbranded as GWISIN, meaning ghost in Korean, targeting organisations strictly within South\nKorea. The threat actor appears to have thorough knowledge of the Korean environment, such as\n\nwidely used local security systems, as well as Korean security certifications and law enforcement.\nThe threat actor employed defensive evasion techniques, true to its name, in combination with\n\nweb vulnerabilities and web shells used to send commands and exfiltrate data from victims.\n\n### Seeing static Orange\n\nThroughout 2022, India-based threat actors maintained their relatively high operational\ntempo, employing known TTPs from 2021. Whilst we have observed heavy targeting of\nPakistan-based government and defence entities with malware similar to those used in\nprevious years by India-based threat actors, we identified several notable new targets and\nTTPs. Several threat actors, such as Orange Yali (a.k.a. BITTER)[136] and Orange Kala (a.k.a.\nDONOT), seemingly broadened their targeting to include organisations based in other\ncountries in the region, whilst Orange Chandi (a.k.a. SideWinder) changed its attack\nprocess from its longstanding TTPs used across 2020 and 2021.\n\nWhilst 2022 provided evidence of new targeting aligning with political events in the\nregion,[137] India-based threat actors have primarily altered tooling within their attack\nprocesses instead of implementing more sophisticated techniques. In several instances, as\npreviously seen in 2021,[138] India-based threat actors continued to make use of commodity\nRATs in their campaigns.\n\n134 ‘Stonefly: North Korea-linked Spying Operation Continues to Hit High-value Targets’, Symantec,\n[https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/stonefly-north-korea-espionage (27th April](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/stonefly-north-korea-espionage)\n2022)\n[135 ‘DTrack activity targeting Europe and Latin America’, Kaspersky, https://securelist.com/dtrack-targeting-europe-](https://securelist.com/dtrack-targeting-europe-latin-america/107798/)\nlatin-america/107798/ (15th November 2022)\n136 _CTO-TUS-20221027-01A - Threats under the Spotlight - September 2022_\n137 _CTO-SIB-20220915-01A - APAC-origin forecast - Q2 2022 developments_\n138 _CTO-TIB-20210112-01A - Orange Kala enters the Warzone_\n\n33  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### Talent Need Not Apply: Advanced Persistent Threats using job-themed lures\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic led a significant number of workers to rethink their careers, threat actors\nexploited the opportunity throughout 2022 to fulfil strategic objectives for both financial and espionage\nmotivations. North Korea- and Iran-based threat actors were particularly brazen in their attempts to\ntarget employees at high profile companies, using social engineering to approach employees over email\nand social media to build rapport before attempting to gain initial access into company networks.[139]\n\n  - **North Korea-based threat actors and financially motivated campaigns**\n\nJob recruitment is a long running pretext for North Korea-based threat actors. During one such\ncampaign in 2022, Black Artemis (a.k.a. Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, ZINC) established a\nvariety of social media personas, including posing as recruitment professionals and human\nresources contacts at high profile companies, to socially engineer targets. Black Artemis also set\nup websites, impersonating well known job search companies, weaponised with browser\nexploits to deploy malware on the targets’ machines.\n\nIn another method, after contacting individuals on LinkedIn, WhatsApp or via email, the threat\nactor attempted to coax targets into opening malicious documents from systems they used for\nwork. Once opened, the remote template injection or malicious macros would download malware\nimplants on the organisations’ networks. Since at least July 2022, Black Artemis pivoted to\nhaving targets open EXE files[140] or ISO files[141] contained in compressed archives, under the\npretence of job descriptions for open roles at high profile technology companies or candidate\nassessments. In another example, since at least August 2022, Black Alicanto (a.k.a.\nCOPERNICIUM, DangerousPassword, CryptoMimic, CryptoCore, Operation SnatchCrypto)\nexperimented with MSI files as malicious lures in similar campaigns, likely in an attempt to\ndiversify initial access techniques.\n\n  - **Iran-based threat actor employing an espionage motivated campaign**\n\nYellow Dev 13 (a.k.a. BOHRIUM, TA455) also posed as recruiters for real or fictitious companies\nacross a variety of social media, including LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, despite\ntakedowns by Meta[142] and Microsoft.[143] Yellow Dev 13 used a variety of artificial intelligence (AI)generated photographs for its personas and impersonated at least one real individual for its\noperations.\n\n\n139 ‘Talent Need Not Apply Tradecraft and Objectives of Job-themed APT Social Engineering’, PwC Threat\n[Intelligence, https://i.blackhat.com/USA-22/Thursday/US-22-Wikoff-Talent-Need-Not-Apply.pdf (11th August 2022)](https://i.blackhat.com/USA-22/Thursday/US-22-Wikoff-Talent-Need-Not-Apply.pdf)\n140 _CTO-TIB-20220812-01A - Black Artemis’ dream job hunt_\n141 ‘It's Time to PuTTY!

In at least one case, the threat actor built a\n\nmalicious executable simulating an entire assessment platform for job candidates, including\naptitude tests and a live chat support function, that would connect back to the ApplyTalents\n\ndomain in the background. Whilst the platform required users to input credentials likely supplied\nby the threat actor to avoid analysis by researchers, we assess Yellow Dev 13 was likely\n\nattempting to compromise individuals or organisations for espionage purposes.\n\n\n### WIRTING about White Dev 21\n\nIn 2022, White Dev 21 (a.k.a. WIRTE) continued to target a variety of victims throughout the\nMiddle East, including Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon. A particular cluster of activity\nin September 2022 revealed that White Dev 21 relied heavily on geopolitical lures,\nleveraging themes relating to the Gulf Cooperation Council and information about Arab\nfinancial services and government organisations. The threat actor demonstrated a\npersistent ability to target key sectors and entities in the region.[145]\n\n### An in-Tur-esting development\n\nIn January 2022, we released a public blog concerning the threat actor we track as White\nTur, which targeted organisations within the Balkans region from at least 2017 through\n2021. Following our disclosure,[146] the threat actor remained active and continued to target\norganisations within the Balkans region with themes related to Bosnia-Herzegovina and\nSerbia. We further identified a series of HTML Application (HTA) scripts which were created\nbetween January 2022 and April 2022 and indicative of a shift in White Tur’s TTPs. In this\nseries of HTA scripts, the threat actor used the WebDAV protocol to transfer a malicious\npayload to the victim’s machine.[147]\n\n[Learn more about White Tur in one our blog posts from 2022](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/threat-actor-of-in-tur-est.html)\n[and our Threat Actor of in-Turest talk at SANS CTI Summit 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn-O8NDlwZs)\n\n144 _CTO-TIB-20220121-02A - Talent need not apply to this career finder_\n145 _CTO-TUS-20221027-01A - Threats under the Spotlight - September 2022_\n[146 ‘Threat actor of in-Tur-est’, PwC Threat Intelligence, https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/threat-actor-of-in-tur-est.html)\nthreat-intelligence/threat-actor-of-in-tur-est.html (27th January 2022)\n147 CTO-TIB-20221012-03A - White Tur’s WebDAV adventures\n\n35  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### What’s up with White Dev 140?\n\nOne of our research projects in 2022 resulted in a perplexing pattern of behaviour which we\nattribute to White Dev 140. The threat actor’s interest included Ukrainian entities in 2022,\nsimilar to targeting we have seen from Russia-based threat actors, but White Dev 140 also\nhad a diverse set of other interests outside of Ukraine which have confounded our initial\nassessments of the threat actor’s motivations. These interests included:[148]\n\n  - Food exporters, supermarkets and retailers;\n\n  - Regional governmental organisations, such as the Dnipro government and\nPiatykhatky District;\n\n  - Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear agency;\n\n  - A gas company;\n\n  - Factories manufacturing metals and electronic devices; and,\n\n  - Logistics companies and private couriers.\n\nSample indicators of White Dev 140 activities we identified in 2022:\n\n\nhttps[:]//product808[.]godaddysites[.]com/purchase-order\nhttps[:]//support-domaill[.]godaddysites[.]com/ukr\nhttps[:]//shipping8[.]godaddysites[.]com/dhl\nhttps[:]//servicesagreement[.]godaddysites[.]com/update\nhttps[:]//support-ukr[.]godaddysites[.]com/log-in\n\n\n148 _CTO-TIB-20221209-02A - Phishing trips to Ukraine_\n\n36  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nWe first identified White Dev 140 spear phishing activity in May 2022, with the threat actor\ntargeting a Ukraine-based software reseller that also supplies licences to the Ukrainian\ngovernment.[149] The spear phishing email contained a UKR[.]net theme, a popular internet\nportal used in Ukraine for email. The email contained a PDF attachment with the following\nmessage in Ukrainian, which has been roughly translated:\n\n\nDear User\nThis message was sent with high importance.

The threat actors were able\nto sell subscription access to the panels, typically in monthly plans, enabling cyber criminals to\nexploit the information for social engineering attacks and fraud.\n\n152 ‘Chinese reports uncover details of cyber attacks by U.S. security agency’, Xinhua,\n[https://english.news.cn/20220913/71f9b72993614795b4d8ff554c99ef9b/c.html (13th September 2022)](https://english.news.cn/20220913/71f9b72993614795b4d8ff554c99ef9b/c.html)\n153 ‘Shadow Brokers leaks show U.S. spies successfully hacked Russian, Iranian targets’, CyberScoop,\n[https://www.cyberscoop.com/nsa-shadow-brokers-leaks-iran-russia-optimusprime-stoicsurgeon/ (18th April 2017)](https://www.cyberscoop.com/nsa-shadow-brokers-leaks-iran-russia-optimusprime-stoicsurgeon/)\n\n38  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\nto sell subscription access to the panels, typically in monthly plans, enabling cyber criminals to\nexploit the information for social engineering attacks and fraud.\n\n152 ‘Chinese reports uncover details of cyber attacks by U.S. security agency’, Xinhua,\n[https://english.news.cn/20220913/71f9b72993614795b4d8ff554c99ef9b/c.html (13th September 2022)](https://english.news.cn/20220913/71f9b72993614795b4d8ff554c99ef9b/c.html)\n153 ‘Shadow Brokers leaks show U.S. spies successfully hacked Russian, Iranian targets’, CyberScoop,\n\n\n-----\n\n### Notable developments of the overall cyber criminal ecosystem emerged in 2022, such as threat actors engaging in “hack-and-leak” operations resembling the digital equivalent of “smash-and-grab” sprees combined with “big game hunting”, i.e. selecting high profile or perceived high value targets whilst chasing headlines and notoriety. \n\n However, cyber criminal ecosystem shifts were largely supported by a continued undercurrent of financially motivated threat actors capitalising on opportunistic and exploitative attacks involving theft, extortion and fraud, with ransomware attacks dominating the market. \n\nRansomware threat actors were more brazen in their attempts to pressure extortion victims\nand recruit insiders in 2022, and we assess this trend will likely grow more prominent in the\ncoming year as threat actors further fracture ransomware brands, compete for resources\nand respond to increased defences and resiliency across organisations. Given the\nintersections of cyber crime and threat actors based in Eastern Europe, we addressed\nspecific developments related to the Russian war in Ukraine earlier in this report - Russian\n\ninvasion of Ukraine: Circling the cyber crime wagons.\n\n## Ransomware developments\n\nOnce considered a disrupter to the cyber crime threat landscape, over the past several\nyears ransomware has become a consistently dominant threat to organisations.\nRansomware’s continued prevalence has been largely due to Ransomware-as-a-Service\n(RaaS) operations, the perpetuating model we detailed in our Cyber Threats 2021: A Year\n**in Retrospect report.[154]**\n\nIn 2022, the ransomware threat landscape saw a levelling off of leak site victims\ncomparable to 2021 trends. We assess this level of leak site activity is likely to remain\n\nconsistent in 2023; however, the number of distinct ransomware brands is unlikely to be a\n\n154 ‘Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC Threat Intelligence\n[https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-report-download.pdf)\nreport-download.pdf (28th April 2022)\n\n39  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nrelevant indicator of the threat landscape, as it has been common practice for groups to\nrapidly shift and rebrand.\n\n#### Moving forward, we judge the more relevant data points to track atmospherics across ransomware activity will be seen in the overlapping TTPs of ransomware threat actors.\n\n### TTPs observed in a typical Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation\n\n40  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### Leak site analysis\n\nIn 2022, there were 2,462 total victims posted to ransomware leak sites we tracked, slightly\nfewer (within 1%) compared to the 2,471 posted in 2021 and almost doubling the 1,330\nposted in 2020. Whilst there was a progressive increase in ransomware leak site victims\nfrom 2020 to 2021, the total number of leak site victims appeared to plateau between 2021\nand 2022.\n\n#### We therefore assess the number of leak site victims for 2021 and 2022 likely represents a “high water” mark for this activity, with 2022 having posed significant challenges to the ransomware ecosystem, such as the Russian war in Ukraine, law enforcement actions against ransomware threat actors, cryptocurrency volatility and internal leaks and conflicts fracturing prominent ransomware groups.[155]\n\n**Leak site activity vs. broader ransomware threat activities**\n\nTracking leak site activity provides specific visibility into the ransomware threat landscape;\nhowever, we continue to pursue other avenues of analysis as leak sites do not provide a\ncomplete picture of ransomware activities, particularly concerning threat actors operating without\nleak sites and victims that are not posted to leak sites or otherwise publicly disclosed.\n\n**Number of leak site victims posted throughout year (2021 – 2022)**\n\n155 _CTO-SRT-20230118-01A - Ransomware report for December 2022_\n\n41  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n**Number of leak site victims posted each month (2020 – 2022)**\n\n#### We classify ransomware attacks as opportunistic and enabled by widespread and indiscriminate infection operations, but we did observe several sectors having more leak site victims than others in 2022. Notably, the top five sectors with victims posted to ransomware leak sites in 2022 were manufacturing (15%), construction (10%), professional services (9%), technology (8%) and retail (8%). \n\n Possible explanations include the perceived high cost of operational downtime for these sectors, as well as the comparatively lower level of information security regulations imposed on these sectors. In addition to these trends, ransomware attacks significantly impacted organisations affiliated with other sectors in 2022, including government, telecommunications, transportation, energy and education.\n\n### White Janus with the lion’s share\n\nIn our analysis of leak site activity in 2022, White Janus (a.k.a. LockBit) dominated in\nnumbers throughout the year and quickly overtook the 2021 pace of Blue Cronus, which\nled the ransomware pack in leak site activity in 2021. In June 2022, White Janus announced\nits LockBit 3.0 RaaS programme, which further powered its operations and leak tempo in\nthe second half of 2022. We assess White Janus likely spent much of June 2022 beta\ntesting LockBit 3.0, coinciding with a pronounced decline in victims posted to its leak site\nwhen compared to the threat actor’s leak site activity in the first half of 2022.[156] By the end\nof December 2022, White Janus posted 907 victims to its leak site in total for all of 2022,\ncompared to 460 victims the threat actor posted in 2021.[157]\n\n156 _CTO-QRT-20220804-03A - White Janus changes the Locks_\n157 _CTO-SRT-20230118-01A - Ransomware report for December 2022_\n\n42  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen LockBit 3.0 was first released in June 2022, we identified codebase overlaps with\nmalware previously used as the main ransomware binary in the now defunct BlackMatter\nRaaS operation. We analysed these overlaps - found initially in the opening functions - and\ndetermined LockBit 3.0 was nearly identical to BlackMatter, such as language checks for\nspecific country codes, encryption implementation and anti-analysis techniques.[158] The\ntechnical overlaps were substantial enough that we, alongside other researchers, assessed\nthe similarity is likely a result of White Janus’ procurement of the BlackMatter codebase.[159]\n\nThis was confirmed by the White Janus spokesperson in an interview reported in July\n2022.[160]\n\n**Seeing BlackMatter in BlackCat**\n\nWhite Janus (a.k.a. LockBit) was not the only threat actor with capabilities overlapping with BlackMatter\nin 2022. In December 2021, the ransomware threat actor ALPHV-ng emerged, with its logo prompting\nmany in open source to label the brand BlackCat. We began tracking this threat actor as White Dev 101\nand quickly identified connections to BlackMatter.[161] Based on significant code overlaps between\nBlackMatter and White Dev 101 binaries, we assess BlackMatter developers highly likely evolved their\noperations to establish the ALPHV-ng brand following BlackMatter operations shutting down in\nNovember 2021.[162]\n\nWhilst White Janus dominated ransomware leak site activity with an inordinately higher number of leak\nvictims throughout 2022 with 907 victims, White Dev 101 leaked the second largest number with 228,\nfollowed by Blue Cronus (a.k.a.

The launch of LockBit 3.0 did not\nconform to this pattern, which we assess is likely indicative of an emerging shift in the RaaS\nmodel, through which technology and codebases are repurposed or acquired outright.[166]\n\n#### Effective defence against constantly evolving ransomware threats requires a two pronged approach. Organisations should make use of ransomware readiness frameworks to build a strategy that is agnostic of specific threats. At the same time, organisations should build an understanding of the underlying precursors and codebases powering known threats, creating opportunities to streamline detection and mitigation.\n\n**An unwelcome professionalisation of RaaS programmes**\n\nSeveral ransomware threat actors further professionalised their RaaS programmes in 2022,\nindicating the oversaturated threat landscape has prompted threat actors to employ new tactics\nto outmanoeuvre competitors whilst finding new ways to coerce and extort victims, who are\nincreasingly enhancing their security measures and responses.\n\n164 ‘LockBit ransomware builder leaked online by “angry developer”’, Bleeping Computer,\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-builder-leaked-online-by-angry-developer-/\n(21st September 2022)\n165 _CTO-SRT-20221019-01A - Ransomware report for September 2022_\n166 _CTO-TIB-20220916-02A - LockBit evolves…sort of_\n\n44  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n_Bug bounty programme and searchable databases_\n\nIn September 2022, White Janus (a.k.a. LockBit) announced its first payout for its bug bounty\nprogramme, allegedly worth USD 50,000. The bug discovered would have allowed for the\n\ndecryption of files encrypted by the threat actor’s ransomware.[167] By the middle of 2022, both\nWhite Janus and White Dev 101 (a.k.a. ALPHV-ng, BlackCat) added search functionality to their\n\nleak sites, allowing for visitors to search victim data.[168]\n\n_High pressure tactics in ransomware negotiations_\nOur analysis of the leaked communications attributed to the Conti brand revealed high pressure\n\nyet mature operations where the threat actor capitalised on direct communications with victims\nor their representatives in negotiations. These leaks also informed our understanding of the stable\n\nof ransomware operations attributed to the threat actor we track as Blue Cronus, including Conti\nand Emotet. From our analysis, we identified tactics used against ransomware victims, including:\n\n - Conti brand employees frequently referencing countdown timers associated with the\nscheduled release of victim data;\n\n - Demonstrating “proof” of compromises through hidden blog posts containing victim data\nand file directory settings;\n\n - Promoting discounts to victims who paid ransoms quickly and without negotiation;\n\n - Estimating the value of stolen data and remediation costs in comparison to paying\nransoms, and sharing this comparison with victims; and,\n\n - Threatening to contact the victims’ clients, partners and investors.[169]\n\n\n### Blue Cronus operations and updates\n\nOn 25th February 2022, a day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Blue Cronus, the threat actor\nbehind the Conti ransomware group and which we previously tracked as White Onibi,\nreleased public statements supporting Russia’s actions. Subsequently, between 27th\nFebruary 2022 and 2nd March 2022, a Twitter account released a series of internal data\nassociated with Blue Cronus operations, revealing unprecedented details and internal\nmachinations via more than 100,000 archived instant messenger communications dating\nback to June 2020. Upon examination of the communications and analysis of the threat\nactor’s operations, we ascertained the threat actors White Magician (a.k.a. TrickBot, Bazar,\nAnchor), White Onibi (a.k.a. Conti, Ryuk) and White Taranis (a.k.a. Emotet) were essentially\ncomponent parts of the same criminal organisation, which we designated as Blue Cronus in\nMarch 2022.[170]\n\n167 _CTO-SRT-20221019-01A - Ransomware report for September 2022_\n168 ‘Experts concerned about ransomware groups creating searchable databases of victim data’, Recorded Future,\n[https://therecord.media/experts-concerned-about-ransomware-groups-creating-searchable-databases-of-victim-](https://therecord.media/experts-concerned-about-ransomware-groups-creating-searchable-databases-of-victim-data/)\ndata/ (14th July 2022)\n169 _[CTO-SIB-20220324-01A - Negotiation tactics and internal dynamics](https://therecord.media/experts-concerned-about-ransomware-groups-creating-searchable-databases-of-victim-data/)_\n170 _[CTO-QRT-2022-20220315-02A - In the leak midwinter](https://therecord.media/experts-concerned-about-ransomware-groups-creating-searchable-databases-of-victim-data/)_\n\n45  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nThese disclosures and subsequent assessments about Blue Cronus operations did not\nslow down the threat actor, despite an apparent phasing out and dissolution of the Conti\nbrand. In April 2022, BlackBasta, the ransomware threat actor we track as White Dev 115,\ncommenced operations with posts on the Russian language, cyber criminal forums Exploit\nand XSS. In addition to Blue Cronus using Qakbot as a delivery mechanism, White Dev 115\nalso consistently used Qakbot to gain initial access into victim networks. We have since\nassessed White Dev 115 to be highly likely part of the Blue Cronus portfolio of ransomware\nvariants.[171]\n\n### Sizing up the precursors\n\n#### Cyber criminals continued to be some of the most agile and forward-evolving threat actors, especially when responding to enhanced security practices implemented across industry, and this is reflected in precursor activity seen in 2022.\n\nOne trend of note from the past year can be seen in the response some cyber criminals had\nto the July 2022 implementation of Microsoft’s policy to block macros by default on\nMicrosoft Office documents downloaded from the Internet,[172] which we detail later in this\nreport – Attack insights and trends: No macros, no problem? The threat actors behind\n\nBumblebee (i.e. Blue Cronus), IcedID (i.e. White Khione) and Qakbot (i.e. White Horoja)\ndeveloped workarounds in 2022 to counter the changes implemented by Microsoft,\nresulting in more bespoke and altogether more sophisticated attack processes. These\nprocesses involve multiple stages which make use of a combination of ISO and LNK files to\ndrop and execute their malware loaders on victim machines.[173]\n\n### Bumblebee\n\nIn the first half of 2022, the initial stage malware loader known as Bumblebee emerged,\ndeveloped by Blue Cronus to replace TrickBot and BazarLoader. Bumblebee quickly\nbecame a prolific capability used in ransomware attacks, with embedded advanced antivirtualisation techniques and the ability to deliver post exploitation kits such as Metasploit\nor Cobalt Strike. Bumblebee is delivered almost exclusively through phishing attacks, quite\noften in hijacked threads to appear more legitimate to victims, and masquerading as\ninvoices, meeting agendas and other documentation intended to elicit responses from\nvictims. The emails also contain “personal passwords” for victims, further luring them into\nopening a password protected malicious ZIP archive or ISO file. Once the victim opens the\nmalicious file, Bumblebee is loaded onto the victim machine through an LNK file.[174]\n\n171 _CTO-SIB-20221222-01A - Blue Cronus and Black Basta_\n172 ‘Macros from the internet will be blocked by default in Office’, Microsoft, https://learn.microsoft.com/enus/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked (11 October 2022)\n173 _CTO-TIB-20221014-01A - ISO-lemnly swear, that we are up to no good_\n174 _[CTO-TIB-20220729-02A - New Queen of the APIary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked)_\n\n46  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### IcedID\n\nIcedID is a banking trojan turned malware delivery system we attribute to White Khione,\nand it is used by a number of threat actors as an initial entry point into a victim system or\nnetwork. In 2022, following the implementation of macro default disabling by Microsoft,\nWhite Khione updated IcedID to move away from the use of malicious Excel spreadsheets\nwith macros in favour of ISO files. These files were coupled with White Khione’s popular\n“Fake Legal Threat” phishing campaign, which it has consistently used to deliver its\npayloads.\n\n### Qakbot\n\nQakbot (a.k.a. Qbot, Pinkslipbot) is controlled by the threat actor we track as White Horoja\nand has been in operation since 2007. Originating as a banking trojan, in 2021 Qakbot\nbegan evolving into a fully modular malware toolkit, boasting loader capabilities, a custom\npacker, anti-sandbox failsafes and anti-debug techniques. Whilst Qakbot is still delivered\nvia phishing attacks leveraging lures of all kinds, in 2022 it moved away from its use of\nmacro-enabled Office files to instead being embedded inside malicious MSIs and\npackaged within password protected ZIP archives.[175]\n\n### White Taranis’ reactivation by Blue Cronus\n\nWhite Taranis (a.k.a. Emotet) re-emerged in late 2021 upon reactivation by Blue Cronus.\nThroughout the first half of 2022, White Taranis operations proceeded at a steady pace,\nwith brief pauses to implement upgrades to its C2 infrastructure, spam engine and system\nreconnaissance capabilities.[176] Blue Cronus also revived some older functionality, including\nits payment card credential stealer.[177] Like other members of the Blue Cronus “stable”, the\nshutdown of the Conti ransomware operation had no immediate impact on White Taranis\ncampaigns; however, by mid-July 2022, White Taranis operations had come to an abrupt\nhalt and remained dormant until early November 2022. Spam campaigns resumed in\nearnest in November 2022, with payloads consisting of malicious Microsoft documents\ncontaining macros to download and execute a White Taranis binary on victim machines.\n\nAfter Microsoft changed its default for macros, Blue Cronus sought to bypass this\nprotection by instructing recipients to copy malicious attachments to their Templates folder\nand open the document from that location. This action removed the Mark of the Web\n(MotW) flag from the malicious document, and once opened, the file would no longer open\nin Protected View, enabling the macros to execute and install the Emotet binary.[178] It\nremains to be seen if the threat actor persists with this technique, or switches to methods\nused by Blue Cronus for Bumblebee and IcedID delivery.\n\n175 _CTO-TIB-20220525-01A - Duck, Duck, Bot: Qakbot evolves!_\n176 _CTO-TIB-20221104-01A - More modules, More Problems_\n177 _CTO-QRT-20220728-01A - You can’t keep a good botnet down_\n178 _CTO-QRT-20221103-01A - Emotet resumes operations_\n\n47  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n## Hackers, fraudsters and stealers\n\nWhilst cyber criminals demonstrated quick shifts to counter Microsoft’s default macro\nsettings in 2022, other threat actors also remained agile in their tactics for evading\nmultifactor authentication (MFA). With threat actors increasingly encountering MFA\nprotections, the demand has risen for MFA bypass capabilities, such as MFA fatigue\ntactics, modified credential stealers and enhanced Phishing-as-a-Service (PHaaS)\nofferings.\n\n48  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat actors motivated by other reasons also attempted to evade MFA, which we detail\nlater in this report – Attack insights and trends: More MFA, more evasion.\n\n### LAPSUS$ in judgement\n\nThe data stealing extortion group we track as White Dev 111 (a.k.a. LAPSUS$ Group)\ngained international notoriety in 2022 for several high profile attacks on large organisations,\nincluding Samsung, NVIDIA and Microsoft, as well as its claims of breaches into Okta, Uber\nand Rockstar. White Dev 111 used social engineering, MFA fatigue and other attacks\npreying on the human element of security and employing “smash and grab” tactics to\ntarget high profile organisations.[179] White Dev 111 first appeared in December 2021 after\nthe threat actor successfully compromised Brazil’s Ministry of Health,[180] claiming to have\nstolen 50 TB of data. White Dev 111 advertised its victims on a Telegram channel, which it\nalso used to post recruitment adverts for “Employees/Insiders” at several major technology,\ngaming and telecommunications organisations requesting access to company “VPN or\nCitrix” logins.[181]\n\n#### Whilst numerous countries have arrested teenagers allegedly affiliated with White Dev 111 (a.k.a. LAPSUS$ Group) operations,[182, 183, 184 ]the threat actor’s TTPs and motivations nonetheless remain of concern to organisations around the world.\n\n### Liars, cheats and thieving raccoons\n\nCredential stealing malware thrived in the underground economy in 2022, with systems like\nRedLine,[185] Raccoon[186] and Vidar[187] dominating the market for compromised credentials.\nThis was largely because the developers of these information stealers (a.k.a. infostealers)\nadjusted their tooling amidst a surge in organisations implementing MFA to protect their\nenvironments.\n\n179 CTO-QRT-20220920-01A - Uber and Rockstar breaches\n180 ‘Brazil health ministry website hit by hackers, vaccination data targets’, Reuters,\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazils-health-ministry-website-hit-by-hacker-attack-systems-down-2021-12-10/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazils-health-ministry-website-hit-by-hacker-attack-systems-down-2021-12-10/)\n(10th December 2022)\n181 _CTO-TIB-20220406-01A - LAPSUS$ Group has entered the chat_\n182 ‘Lapsus$: Oxford teen accused of being multi-millionaire cyber-criminal’, BBC News,\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60864283 (24th March 2022)](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60864283)\n183 ‘UK police arrest teenager suspected of Uber, GTA 6 hacks’, TechCrunch,\n[https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/26/london-police-arrest-uber-rockstar/ (26th September 2022)](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/26/london-police-arrest-uber-rockstar/)\n184 ‘PF prende brasileiro suspeito de integrar organização criminosa internacional’, Brazilian Ministry of Justice and\n[Public Security, https://www.gov.br/pf/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2022/10/pf-prende-brasileiro-suspeito-de-integrar-](https://www.gov.br/pf/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2022/10/pf-prende-brasileiro-suspeito-de-integrar-organizacao-criminosa-internacional)\norganizacao-criminosa-internacional (19th October 2022)\n185 _CTO-TIB-20220209-01A - The Rise of RedLine_\n186 _CTO-TIB-20220914-02A - Raccoon Stealer 2.0_\n187 _CTO-TIB-20230113-01A - Vidar Stealer_\n\n49  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Throughout 2022, more and more developers of credential stealing malware added or enhanced capabilities to syphon session cookies, which in certain circumstances facilitated MFA bypassing. \n\nIn March 2022, Raccoon Stealer suddenly ceased operations after the malware developers\nreported their lead was killed in Ukraine during the Russian invasion.[188] By mid-2022,\nRaccoon Stealer developers assured their criminal customer base that despite the major\nsetback, they would continue the development of a new version of Raccoon Stealer\nboasting enhanced capabilities; however, in October 2022, the US government announced\nthe lead developer, a Ukrainian national, was not killed in Ukraine but was instead arrested\nby Dutch police in March 2022, and Raccoon Stealer infrastructure was subsequently\ndismantled in a joint effort by international law enforcement agencies, forcing the\ndevelopers to restart and relaunch operations.[189]\n\n### Phishing with dynamite\n\nIn 2022, cyber criminals continued to rely on tried-and-true phishing tactics, which\nconsisted of clever messaging and a reliance on single factor authentication. When forced\nto adapt, numerous threat actors took advantage of free-to-use services largely intended\nfor security practitioners, such as Glitch and Gophish, which provide both infrastructure\nand tooling to create and distribute phishing emails and develop phishing landing pages.\nThreat actors engaging in phishing attacks also continued to demonstrate little reservation\nin masquerading as government or law enforcement agencies. One threat actor went as far\nas using the arrest of another well known scammer, Ramon Abbas (a.k.a. HushPuppi), to\nimpersonate the US Department of Justice’s Office of Victims of Crime in further attempts\nto victimise targets and steal their private financial information.[190]\n\n**Not just a Glitch**\n\nCreating and maintaining infrastructure to conduct phishing attacks is an expensive and labourintensive operation, and it can be especially frustrating for threat actors when their infrastructure\nis taken down by hosting providers or blocked by web browsers. For this reason, threat actors\nseek free and easy-to-use platforms and services for their phishing operations. Glitch was one\nsuch free-to-use, cloud-based software development platform used by West Africa-based\nbusiness email compromise (BEC) threat actors for this purpose. The Glitch platform has a free\ntier which allows users to quickly deploy public webapps with a Glitch-provided hostname. The\nthreat actors combined Glitch with an older phishing kit known as LogoKit to create fake webmail\n\n188 _CTO-TIB-20220914-02A - Raccoon Stealer Returns_\n[189 ‘United States of America v.

EvilProxy emerged in mid-2022,\noperating as an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) between phishing victims and enterprise\nlogin portals, and providing cyber criminals a graphical user interface (GUI) to customise\nand automate phishing campaign deliveries, all for a low use fee. EvilProxy facilitates both\ncredential and cookie stealing capabilities for bypassing MFA and has advertised its ability\nto compromise sign-on portals for large enterprises, such as Google, Microsoft and\nLinkedIn, as well as other services.\n\n#### The point-and-click nature of EvilProxy is one product in a growing market within the cyber criminal ecosystem, encouraging the development of on-demand and fee-based capabilities and further lowering the barrier to entry for a wide range of threat actors to engage in attacks.\n\n191 _CTO-SIB-20220811-01A - A glitch in the BEC system_\n\n51  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### Throughout 2022, new technologies and common vulnerabilities permeated the dynamic between attackers and defenders, with each seeking an advantage and highlighting the need for defence in depth. Threat actors increasingly leveraged enhanced tooling and frameworks in their attacks, as well as modified their TTPs to outmanoeuvre security practices implemented by defenders. Threat actors paired these shifts with their continued use of tried-and-true methods, such as exploiting exposed instances of remote desktop protocol (RDP) and systems not yet secured with MFA. \n\n## Tooling and frameworks\n\nThroughout 2022, numerous examples of tooling and frameworks were discussed and\ntracked across industry, and we observed a greater awareness of how these are used by\nlegitimate red teams and abused by malicious attackers.\n\n#### As a defender, these frameworks bring challenges due to their rapid evolution; however, they also bring detection opportunities. In some cases, once a defender detects the use of a particular framework, other frameworks could be detected as well with the same or similar approach.\n\nAlthough some frameworks gained notoriety across industry in 2022, Cobalt Strike\nremained the most abused post exploitation framework, used by a wide range of threat\nactors. Detecting the use of a particular framework in isolation is likely to remain a\nchallenge for defenders and will likely become more difficult in the coming years.\n\n52  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### Brute Ratel\n\nBrute Ratel is a commercial C2 framework that became more well known as 2022\nprogressed due to its use by several threat actors.[192] Various versions of Brute Ratel were\nleaked and cracked in the past year, and the framework can be customised and extended\nwith ease. By default, Brute Ratel boasts a variety of features which can be used to evade\ndetection, such as unhooking Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)/antivirus (AV), a\nvariety of C2 mechanisms and indirect execution of APIs.\n\n192 ‘When Pentest Tools Go Brutal: Red-Teaming Tool Being Abused by Malicious Actors’, Palo Alto Unit 42,\n[https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/brute-ratel-c4-tool/ (5th July 2022)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/brute-ratel-c4-tool/)\n\n53  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n54  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sliver\n\nUnlike Brute Ratel, Sliver is an open source framework, allowing those using it to more\neasily customise the framework in use.

With Microsoft’s 2022 update to disable\nMark of the Web (MotW) by default,[193] we observed threat actors having to adapt their\ntargeting of organisations with malicious documents relying on the execution of macros.\nFurther, threat actors ranging in resources, sophistication and motivation have sought\nalternative ways to gain initial access to targets, as seen in an infection vector revolving\naround using:\n\n  - ISO files (which effectively act as archive files) to deliver malicious payloads; and,\n\n  - LNK (shortcut) files to masquerade as legitimate documents, but in reality execute\nmalicious payloads.\n\n[193 ‘Macros from the internet will be blocked by default in Office’, Microsoft, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked)\nus/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked (11th October 2022)\n\n56  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n**Example infection chain using ISO + LNK files**\n\n57  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n## More MFA, more evasion\n\nAs more organisations adopt MFA protections for privileged access and identity access\nmanagement (IAM), threat actors have shifted to evasion techniques ranging from social\nengineering, as seen in the case of White Dev 111 employing MFA fatigue attacks against\n\nits victims, to technical bypass techniques, such as those integrated into malware\ncommonly used by cyber criminals as well as more sophisticated threat actors.\n\nOne such threat actor is Blue Dev 5 (a.k.a. NOBELIUM), which we analysed in 2022 during\nan incident response case and found the threat actor had evaded MFA protections by\nexploiting a dormant account to gain access to the victim’s Microsoft Azure Active\n\nDirectory (AD) environment. Blue Dev 5 authenticated to the account using valid\ncredentials, with the dormant account having been established before the victim\nimplemented MFA.

Earlier in 2022, we\nresponded to a separate Blue Dev 5-related incident, which involved the threat actor\ngaining initial access into the victim’s cloud environment through the compromise of its\nCloud Service Provider (CSP).[197] The CSP had Delegated Administrator[198] permissions for\nthe victim’s Microsoft Azure AD and O365 tenant, effectively providing the threat actor with\nadministrative access to the victim’s Microsoft cloud environment.\n\nUsing this access, Blue Dev 5 added a password credential to an Azure AD Service\nPrincipal[199] used by a backup application, allowing the threat actor to then log into the\nvictim environment with the same permissions as those available to the legitimate backup\napplication. Blue Dev 5 then used these credentials to authenticate as the backup\napplication and make Exchange Web Service (EWS)[200] cloud API calls to Exchange Online\n(O365), with the backup application privileges opening the possibility for Blue Dev 5 to\naccess and exfiltrate the emails of all of the victim’s O365 user accounts.

White\nBaku then leveraged Cobalt Strike for C2 and lateral movement, deploying Mozzy, a\ncustom piece of malware designed to gather information about the victim’s EDR, and RDP\nFacilitator, a piece of malware used to configure backdoors to facilitate RDP. To reinforce\nits foothold in the victim’s network, White Baku installed the GoToAssist remote support\ntool. For collection and exfiltration, White Baku installed WinRAR to compress files and\nPuTTY Secure Copy (PSCP) for file transfer and data exfiltration, enabling White Baku to\nsteal files from the victim before encrypting the system. Finally, White Baku used PsExec\nfor the final ransomware deployment.\n\n**White Baku intrusion chain**\n\n207 _CTO-TIB-20220608-01A - White Baku grabs a foothold_\n\n62  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n207 _CTO-TIB-20220608-01A - White Baku grabs a foothold_\n\n62  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n63  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n- _Collection: Once more, it’s important to stress that whilst compression tools like WinRAR and_\nothers are perfectly legitimate, they are also used by cyber criminal threat actors and advanced\n\npersistent threats alike.

To differentiate such exfiltration activity from legitimate\n\nfile transfer activity, it may be useful to specifically alert on origins, destinations and volumes of\noutgoing data transfers that are unusual for the environment. Additionally, endpoint signatures\n\nmay be created to detect file transfer tools that are not in line with the organisation's policy.\nSimilarly, processes which exhibit behaviour identical to that of known benign file transfer tools,\nbut are using unusual process names, may be alerted on through endpoint signatures.\nMITRE ATT&CK T1048.002 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Asymmetric\nEncrypted Non-C2 Protocol\n\n\n### Black Artemis case study\n\nIn late 2022, we responded to a long term, persistent intrusion against an organisation in\nthe chemicals sector by the North Korea-based threat actor Andariel (a.k.a. Stonefly, Silent\nChollima), which we track internally as a subgroup of Black Artemis. The threat actor\nachieved persistent access to the victim’s environment and returned to the network to\nperform further activity at least once, occurring two months after the initial compromise.\nGiven the nature of the victim organisation, its subject matter expertise and the evidence\nfound during our incident response engagement, we assess this intrusion was highly likely\nmotivated by espionage and targeting intellectual property and unique knowledge\nbelonging to the victim organisation.\n\nOur review of surviving evidence led us to assess the initial compromise into the victim’s\nenvironment was likely facilitated by Andariel’s exploitation of an Internet-facing server\nvulnerable to Log4Shell. Following initial access into the network, Andariel deployed\nexecutable loaders for the DTrack backdoor[208] on multiple hosts and established\npersistence through a variety of methods, including setting Autorun keys and creating\nStartup services, whilst the backdoor itself was exclusively run in memory.\n\n208 ‘Dtrack activity targeting Europe and Latin America’, Kaspersky, https://securelist.com/dtrack-targeting-europelatin-america/107798/ (15th November 2022)\n\n64  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nAndariel then dropped additional tools to disk:\n\n  - Legitimate PuTTY clients;\n\n  - A custom build of a specific, older version of the PuTTY Secure Shell Protocol\n\n(SSH)/Telnet client for Windows compiled from source;\n\n  - Often in combination with Flynet, an open source Go TCP/UDP proxying tool for\nWindows; and,\n\n  - In at least one case, Andariel also dropped 3Proxy, an open source proxying utility.\n\nThese tools were given filenames that allowed them to masquerade as being related to the\nantivirus present in the victim’s environment. We assess Andariel used these tools likely to\nproxy traffic in and out of the victim’s network. This is consistent with other Andariel activity\nencountered by Cisco Talos during incident response cases on the networks of other\nvictims,[209] suggesting the threat actor has a very defined and consistent playbook across\nintrusions.\n\n**Black Artemis intrusion chain**\n\n[209 ‘Lazarus and the tale of three RATs’, Cisco Talos, https://blog.talosintelligence.com/lazarus-three-rats/ (8th](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/lazarus-three-rats/)\nSeptember 2022)\n\n65  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nAndariel additionally compromised several accounts ranging from Local Administrators to\nDomain Administrators, and we observed evidence of the threat actor moving laterally\nacross the network, including by likely jumping hosts through SMB connections. The threat\nactor dropped a specific version of WinRAR on multiple hosts, which was used to unpack\ncompressed archives containing DTrack loaders to be executed, and with realistic\nprobability to compress files for exfiltration. We also found evidence suggesting Andariel\nused a custom infostealer matching the description provided by Symantec in a blog on\nDTrack activity, which it deployed specifically on file servers.[210]\n\n**Lessons from the Andariel incident involving DTrack**\n\nThere are several possibilities for detection and mitigation opportunities across the intrusion\nchain performed by Andariel which we observed in this incident. When comparing this case to\nthe White Baku case described above, it is important to consider similarities in some of the attack\nstages, further reinforcing the importance of defending against techniques widely used across\nthreat actors.\n\n   - _Initial access: Please see this section in the_ White Baku case study above.\nMITRE ATT&CK [T1505.003 - Server Software Component: Web Shell.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003/)\n\n   - _Persistence:_ Threat actors continued to use well known persistence mechanisms such as\nRegistry Keys and services. Whilst these are easy to establish for threat actors, they are also\nsimple to detect and monitor, and can be identified both at creation time as well as during\nroutine security hygiene checks for the environment. Whilst items like Registry Keys and services\nare a legitimate and normal part of organisation environments, and can be set up by threat actors\nto blend in among expected software and tasks, detection rules can be created to monitor for\ncreation or modification of Autorun methods.

More prolific espionage motivated threat actors will increasingly target digital supply chains and exploit 0-days for access operations.\n\nAs threat actors operate through quartermaster arrangements and use commodity or\nshared tooling, frameworks and malware, we expect the commercial marketplace for these\ncapabilities to evolve and prompt wider adoption. Indicators of this evolution include an\nincreasing market for 0-days and commercial threat actors stockpiling exploits, such as\nNSO Group (a.k.a. Grey Anqa)[211] and others. This evolution will enable more espionage\nmotivated threat actors to emerge from nascent capabilities that were typically underresourced or underutilised.\n\nConcerning quartermaster trends specifically, we anticipate espionage motivated threat\nactors will increase their investments into obfuscation-as-a-service proxy networks, and\nthat vulnerable Internet-of-Things (IoT) and small office/home office (SOHO) devices will\ncontinue to be some of the primary targets for exploitation and co-option systems run by\n\nthe commercial providers of these networks.\n\nGiven the saturated market across the cyber criminal ecosystem, we anticipate cyber\ncriminals will continue to adapt in the depth and breadth of monetised criminal services.\nWe anticipate the high profile “smash-and-grab” attacks of 2022 will prompt similar activity\nin the coming year, for both financially and hacktivism motivated threat actors. Software\nlibrary vulnerabilities are also likely to be an exploitation focus for threat actors in the year\nahead.\n\nFinally, as we research the development and deployment of sabotage capabilities by threat\nactors such as those based in Iran, we expect a continuation of “hack-and-leak” attacks,\n\n211 We previously shared information about this threat actor in ‘Cyber Threats 2021: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC\nThreat Intelligence https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-inretrospect/yir-cyber-threats-report-download.pdf (28th April 2022).\n\n68  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nuse of wipers, pursuit of long-standing destruction operations against industrial control\nsystems (ICS) and evolving techniques that could include data alteration-style attacks.\n\n## Threat actor-specific targeting anticipated in 2023\n\nWith Russia's protracted war in Ukraine and fallout of diplomatic relations across much of\nthe globe, we anticipate Russia-based threat actors will increasingly target sectors and\norganisations in retaliation for their perceived or overt support of Ukraine or divestiture from\nRussia. We also expect Russia-based threat actors to target logistics, transport and\nmanufacturing sectors as the war continues, as well as other sectors in which Russia\nexperiences significant supply chain challenges—akin to industrial espionage targeting.\nRussia-based threat actors will also continue to show interest in government, defence and\nrelated entities as part of longstanding espionage operations.\n\nWe expect China-based threat actors to increase their targeting operations against the\nsemiconductor industry and high technology, particularly given US sanctions imposed on\nChina in 2022.[212] Further, we anticipate geopolitical tensions in the region will increase\nrelated targeting operations by these threat actors. Given the protest activity that occurred\nacross China in late 2022, how threat actors may respond to support internal surveillance\nactivities will be an area to watch.\n\nIran-based threat actors will continue targeting sectors relevant to the Iranian regime, as\nwell as sectors related to the development of its strategic interests. We expect Iran-based\nthreat actors to continue targeting Israel-, Saudi Arabia- and US-based entities, whilst also\ncontinuing their tempo for inward targeting against domestic targets and dissidents.\n\nWe anticipate Western-based actions emanating from countries like the United States will\nlikely remain consistent and reflect geopolitical issues, as seen in the US’s admission in\n2022 of conducting offensive cyber operations “in support of Ukraine” amidst the Russian\nwar.[213]\n\n212 _CTO-SIB-20221117-01A - US export controls on semiconductors_\n213 ‘US military hackers conducting offensive operations in support of Ukraine, says head of Cyber Command’, Sky\nNews, https://news.sky.com/story/us-military-hackers-conducting-offensive-operations-in-support-of-ukraine-sayshead-of-cyber-command-12625139 (1st June 2022)\n\n69  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### PwC Cybersecurity\n\n**If you would like more information about any of the threats detailed in this report,**\n**[please feel free to get in touch with us at threatintelligence@pwc.com.](mailto:threatintelligence@pwc.com)**\n\nPwC is globally recognised by industry analysts as a leader in cybersecurity: as a firm with\nstrong global delivery capabilities and the ability to address the security and risk challenges\nour clients face.\n\nWe underpin our board-level security strategy and advisory consulting services with\nexpertise gleaned from the front lines of cyber defence across our niche technical expertise\nin services such as managed cyber defence, red teaming, incident response and threat\nintelligence.\n\nWe differentiate ourselves with our ability to combine strategic thinking, strong technical\ncapabilities and complex engagement delivery with client service excellence.

The following PwC firms provided their\ninsights from these engagements to enrich our analysis: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada,\nCzech Republic, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, New\nZealand, South Korea, United Kingdom, United States and Vietnam.\n\n**Estimative language**\n\nInterpretations of estimative or probabilistic language (e.g. “likely” or “almost certainly”)\nvary widely, and to avoid misinterpretation we have used the following qualitative terms\nwithin this report when referring to the level of confidence we have in our assessments.\nUnless otherwise stated, our assessments are not based on statistical analysis.\n\nQualitative term Associated probability language\n\nRemote or highly unlikely Less than 10%\n\nImprobably or unlikely 10-25%\n\nRealistic probability 26-50%\n\nProbable or likely 51-75%\n\nHighly probable or highly likely 76-90%\n\nAlmost certain More than 90%\n\nIn Appendix B - Threat actor reference, we describe the methodology behind our threat\nactor naming convention and how we define threat actor motivations and capabilities.\n\nIn Appendix D - Defender index, we provide additional definitions and explanations of our\n\ndetection and mitigation methodology.\n\n71  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B - Threat actor reference\n\nWe track a wide range of threat actors from around the world and apply our naming\nconvention, first consisting of a colour referring to where we assess the threat actor to be\nbased. We designate the colour \"White\" to threats under assessment, and the below table\nincludes some of our colour mapping. Following the colour, we assign a mythical figure to\nestablish a unique name for the threat actor. If we observe activity that cannot be attributed\nto a known entity, we refer to the threat actor as a “dev set” to facilitate further\ndevelopment and analysis, and in some cases we will assign a named set to a dev set if our\nanalysis results in an attribution assessment. Where we see overlaps in attribution between\nour research and other organisations’, we provide the respective threat actor names.\n\n### Key terms and phrases concerning threat actors\n\nCyber criminal -as-a-Service offerings: Cyber criminal services which are developed and\nthen advertised for use in exchange for payment, such as the following included in this\n\nreport:\n\n  - Access-as-a-Service (AaaS): The criminal service offering which charges\ncustomers for accesses to networks, predominantly corporate.\nThis type of offering can be divided into the following two categories:\n\n    - Initial access broker (IAB): A cyber criminal who sells login credentials to\nexposed Internet-facing infrastructure, such as remote desktop protocol (RDP)\nand virtual private networks (VPNs), to customers.\n\n    - Malware delivery system: A criminal service which uploads a customer’s\nmalware onto a compromised host as a secondary payload, such as White\nTaranis via Emotet and White Horoja via Qakbot. - pg. 45-48\n\n  - Distributed Denial of Service-for-hire (DDoS-for-hire): The criminal service offering\nwhere cyber criminals pay a fee to an illicit capability to conduct DDoS attacks,\nsuch as Blue Kurama (a.k.a.

In 2022, cyber threat actors](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/c-suite-insights/ceo-survey-2023.html)\ncontinued to adapt and modify their behaviours to outmanoeuvre security practices against\na backdrop of escalating conflict in Ukraine, a sustained yet high tempo in ransomware\nactivity and the use of sabotage to further both political and criminal gains. While the threat\nlandscape evolved and the risks increased, [PwC’s 2023 Global Digital Trust Insights](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/global-digital-trust-insights.html)\nresearch highlighted collaboration between CISOs and the C-suite and Board as a critical\ncontributor to cyber security improvements and making the most of sustained, cumulative\ninvestments in risk mitigation.\n\nPwC Threat Intelligence identified the following key cyber risks from our threat-focused\nresearch in 2022, as well as our proactive efforts to spot and assess emerging cyber\nissues.\n\n**1.** **Geopolitics reflected in threat actor activities - pg. 1-2, 68-69**\n\n     - Cyber capabilities were used extensively by threat actors to complement\ntraditional warfare methods observed in the Russian war in Ukraine (pg. 819).\n\n     - China-based threat actors advanced their abilities to obfuscate their\nactivities against traditional targets and demonstrated a keen interest in\nintelligence relating to the war in Ukraine, as well as the response of the\ninternational community (pg. 20-26).\n\n     - Iran-based threat actors escalated their targeting of dissidents and\ndemonstrated a willingness to use cyber as a political weapon in the\nBalkans (pg. 27-31).\n\n     - North Korea-based threat actors continued to target financial services and\ncryptocurrencies as a way of generating revenue and offsetting the effects\nof sanctions (pg. 32-34).\n\n     - Many nations escalated the priority of increasing cyber resilience at a\nnational level after cyber authorities like the Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the United States and the National\nCyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the United Kingdom forewarned of the\npotential for organisations to become collateral damage in the wake of\nincreased geopolitical tensions (pg. 9-10).\n\n**2.** **Ransomware’s evolution and outlook - pg. 39-48**\n\n     - Ransomware remained the main cyber threat to the majority of\norganisations across the globe, as threat actors professionalised their\nbusiness model to 24/7 operations against high value sectors, including\nmanufacturing, construction and retail (pg. 41-42, 44-45).\n\n     - Threat actor interest also extended to small and medium size\n\norganisations, including local government, incurring significant costs for\n\n76  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\nmitigation and remediation and publicising attacks and disruptions on leak\nsites (pg. 41-42).\n\n     - Ransomware groups and key threat actors continued to fracture and\nrebrand throughout 2022, with Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) proving\nincreasingly popular as a business model (pg. 39-46).\n\n**3.** **Sabotage operations escalate - pg. 1-2, 68-69**\n\n     - Russia-based threat actors deployed multiple forms of destructive malware\nagainst Ukraine-based entities, and we expect the same in 2023 (pg. 1,\n11-14).\n\n     - Iran-based threat actors launched sabotage attacks against organisations\nwithin the Albanian government. The success of these potentially\nforeshadows emboldened attempts to exert strategic influence via\noffensive cyber means in the future by Iran-based threat actors, as well as\nothers with sabotage motivations and capabilities (pg. 2, 28-29, 68-69).\n\n**4.** **Multifactor Authentication (MFA) bypassing/evasion and fatigue - pg. 49-52,**\n\n**58-60**\n\n     - Threat actors demonstrated the ability to adapt and bypass enhanced\nsecurity controls, including some forms of MFA, and tailor social\nengineering (pg. 49) and credential stealing tools (pg. 49-50) to maximise\ntheir ability to gain unfettered access to corporate environments, including\ncloud-based environments (pg. 58-59).\n\n     - The failure to use MFA in a corporate environment, especially on privileged\naccess accounts, contributed to the success of some ransomware attacks\nand other cyber criminal compromises observed in 2022. MFA makes it\nexceptionally difficult for a criminal to access a network remotely, even if\nthey have a legitimate username and password (pg. 50).\n\n**5.** **Targeting digital identity and privileged access - pg. 1, 58-60, 68**\n\n     - Protecting identity and privileged access is the single highest priority to\nsecure an organisation’s environment and data.\n\n     - Threat actors in 2022 focused extensively on compromising digital\nidentities, often by using sophisticated social engineering, to achieve initial\naccess (pg. 49).\n\n     - Threat actors also used infostealers, which syphon user credentials and\nother information to gain initial access into networks (pg. 49-51).\n\n**6.** **Cloud environments in the crosshairs - pg. 59-60**\n\n     - As more organisations moved to the cloud and reaped the benefits of\nenhanced security afforded by those environments, threat actors worked\nhard to develop new tools and knowledge to compromise cloud-based\nservices (pg. 58-60).\n\n77  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n     - Responding to attacks targeting cloud-based environments and services\nrequires different approaches, as threat actors predominantly abuse\nidentities, services and application programming interfaces (APIs) (pg. 5960). Software library vulnerabilities are also likely to be an exploitation focus\nin 2023 (pg. 68).\n\n     - We developed several recommendations for hardening cloud environments\nbased on incident response cases we supported in 2022 (pg. 59-60).\n\n#### Looking ahead, cloud service, managed service and identity and access management (IAM) providers with privileged access to client networks will increasingly become targets of choice for the most sophisticated actors – to achieve the scaled access that they need to compromise the targets of their espionage and intellectual property theft operations (pg. 68).\n\nOther appendices within this report provide more information about our methodology, the various threats\ndescribed and a collated index of information relevant to defenders.

Having visibility of all network\ntraffic means that even when an attacker evades detection on the endpoint, or\ncompromises an endpoint that has no detection tooling, the C2 activity can usually\nbe detected. Internal network visibility can also help with detecting and tracking\nlateral movement.\n\n**3.** **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)/Security Orchestration,**\n**Automation and Response (SOAR): Having a central view of all detection events**\nallows a defender to correlate at a higher level and conduct additional detection. It\nalso brings together the wider context of activity in ways that, if done well, help the\ndefender find signal in the noise. SOAR platforms also allow a defender to automate\nremediation, which is particularly useful when ransomware is in play and time is of\nthe essence.\n\n4. **YARA: Whilst rarely used for real time detection, YARA is incredibly useful for**\nanalysing suspect binaries and for scanning memory. With YARA, rules can be\nwritten to assist with the triage of suspicious samples and cluster artefacts as part\nof intrusion and campaign analysis efforts.\n\n#### Defence in depth can be further enhanced by developing detection for both specific activity attributed to threat actors with high confidence, as well as the behaviour more generally so that changes in behaviour, minor and otherwise, can be detected.\n\n[Read more about the YARA workshop we provided at FIRST22](https://www.first.org/conference/2022/program#pYet-Another-YARA-Workshop)\n\n80  |  Cyber Threats 2022: A Year in Retrospect\n\n\n-----\n\n### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) cited in this report\n\n  - `CVE-2021-40444 - pg. 29`\n\n  - `CVE-2021-44228 (a.k.a.
