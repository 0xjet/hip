It is considered critical as it can allow a](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40539)\nremote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.\n\n\n-----\n\nZoho has published a security advisory to announce that an update that patches the bug is\ncurrently available for ADSelfService Plus.\n\nIn a [security notification week, the company says that it is “noticing indications of this](https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/kb/how-to-fix-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-in-REST-API.html)\nvulnerability being exploited” in the wild.\n\nThe [alert from CISA is clear about this, though, as the agency informs that “CVE-2021-](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/09/07/zoho-releases-security-update-adselfservice-plus)\n40539 has been detected in exploits in the wild.”\n\nAt this moment, information about the vulnerability is scarce. A severity score has not been\ncalculated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. but Zoho notes\nthat the issue is critical:\n\n“An authentication bypass vulnerability affecting REST API URLs, that could result in\nremote code execution,” the company says.\n\nOrganizations with ADSelfService Plus builds lower than 6114 are urged to apply the latest\n[update from the developer, available using the service pack.](https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/service-pack.html)\n\nCVE-2021-40539 is the fifth critical vulnerability reported for Zoho ManageEngine\nADSelfService Plus this year:\n\n[CVE-2021-37421 - admin portal access-restriction bypass in Zoho ManageEngine](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37421)\nADSelfService Plus 6103 and earlier\n[CVE-2021-37417 - CAPTCHA bypass due to improper parameter validation in Zoho](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37417)\nManageEngine ADSelfService Plus build 6103 and earlier\n[CVE-2021-33055 - unauthenticated remote code execution in non-English editions](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-33055)\naffecting Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus through 6102\n[CVE-2021-28958 - unauthenticated remote code execution while changing the](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-28958)\npassword in all Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus builds up to 6101\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Zyxel fixes firewall flaws that could lead to hacked networks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zyxel-fixes-firewall-flaws-that-could-lead-to-hacked-networks/)\n\n[Critical F5 BIG-IP vulnerability exploited to wipe devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-f5-big-ip-vulnerability-exploited-to-wipe-devices/)\n\n[Mirai malware now delivered using Spring4Shell exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mirai-malware-now-delivered-using-spring4shell-exploits/)\n\n[Exploit released for critical VMware auth bypass bug, patch now](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exploit-released-for-critical-vmware-auth-bypass-bug-patch-now/)\n\n[Darknet market Versus shuts down after hacker leaks security flaw](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darknet-market-versus-shuts-down-after-hacker-leaks-security-flaw/)\n\n[ADSelfService Plus](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/adselfservice-plus/)\n[CISA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cisa/)\n[Critical Update](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/critical-update/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Exploit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/exploit/)\n[ManageEngine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/manageengine/)\n[Remote Code Execution](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/remote-code-execution/)\n[Zoho](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/zoho/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
