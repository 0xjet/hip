This series of suspected network\n\nintrusions also targeted the Hong Kong Study Mission to China and the\n\nPontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME), Italy. These organizations\n\nhave not been publicly reported as targets of Chinese threat activity\n\ngroups prior to this campaign.\n\nThese network intrusions occured ahead of the anticipated\n\n[September 2020 renewal of the landmark 2018 China-Vatican provisional](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2020/06/vatican-agreement-with-china-likely-to-be-renewed-archbishop-says/)\n\n[agreement, a deal which reportedly resulted in the Chinese Communist](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/22/vatican-pope-francis-agreement-with-china-nominating-bishops)\n\nParty (CCP) gaining more control and oversight over the country’s\n\nhistorically persecuted “underground” Catholic community. In addition\n\nto the Holy See itself, another likely target of the campaign includes\n\nthe current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China, whose\n\npredecessor was considered to have played a vital role in the 2018\n\nagreement.\n\nThe suspected intrusion into the Vatican would offer RedDelta\n\ninsight into the negotiating position of the Holy See ahead of the deal’s\n\nSeptember 2020 renewal. The targeting of the Hong Kong Study Mission\n\nand its Catholic Diocese could also provide a valuable intelligence source\n\nfor both monitoring the diocese’s relations with the Vatican and its\n\nposition on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement amidst widespread\n\n[protests and the recent sweeping Hong Kong national security law.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-53230391)\n\n\nWhile there is considerable overlap between the observed TTPs of\n\nRedDelta and the threat activity group publicly referred to as Mustang\n\nPanda (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT and HoneyMyte), there are\n\na few notable distinctions which lead us to designate this activity as\n\nRedDelta:\n\nThe version of PlugX used by RedDelta in this campaign uses\n\na different C2 traffic encryption method and has a different\n\nconfiguration encryption mechanism than traditional PlugX.\n\nThe malware infection chain employed in this campaign has not been\n\npublicly reported as used by Mustang Panda.\n\nIn addition to the targeting of entities related to the Catholic Church,\n\nInsikt Group also identified RedDelta targeting law enforcement and\n\ngovernment entities in India and a government organization in Indonesia.\n\n**_Figure 1: Selection of main differences between PlugX variants and the infection chain_**\n_used by RedDelta and Mustang Panda._\n\n###### Key Judgments\n\nThe targeting of entities related to the Catholic church is likely\n\nindicative of CCP objectives in consolidating control over the\n\n[“underground” Catholic church, “sinicizing religions” in China, and](https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/chinese-communist-party-vows-to-sinicize-religions-in-china/)\n\ndiminishing the perceived influence of the Vatican within China’s\n\nCatholic community.\n\nDue to RedDelta’s targeting of organizations that heavily align to\n\nChinese strategic interests, use of shared tooling traditionally used\n\nby China-based groups, and overlaps with a suspected Chinese\n\nstate-sponsored threat activity group, Insikt Group believes that\n\nthe group likely operates on behalf of the People’s Republic of\n\nChina (PRC) government.\n\nThe identified RedDelta intrusions feature infrastructure, tooling,\n\nand victimology overlap with the threat activity group publicly\n\nreported as Mustang Panda (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT\n\nand HoneyMyte). This includes the use of overlapping network\n\ninfrastructure and similar victimology previously attributed to this\n\ngroup in public reporting, as well as using malware typically used\n\nby Mustang Panda, such as PlugX, Poison Ivy, and Cobalt Strike.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Background\n\n China and the Catholic Church\n\nFor many years, Chinese state-sponsored groups have targeted religious\n\n[minorities within the the PRC, particularly those within the so-called “Five](https://warontherocks.com/2016/07/managing-the-power-within-chinas-state-security-commission/)\n\n[Poisons,” such as Tibetan, Falun Gong, and Uighur muslim communities. Insikt](https://warontherocks.com/2016/07/managing-the-power-within-chinas-state-security-commission/)\n\nGroup has publicly reported on aspects of this activity, such as our findings on\n\n[RedAlpha, the ext4 backdoor, and Scanbox watering hole campaigns targeting the](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redalpha-cyber-campaigns/)\n\n[Central Tibetan Administration, other Tibetan entities, and the Turkistan Islamic](https://www.recordedfuture.com/scanbox-framework-campaign/)\n\n[Party. Most recently, a July 2020 U.S. indictment identified the targeting of emails](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1295981/download)\n\nbelonging to Chinese Christian religious figures — a Xi’an-based pastor, as well as\n\nan underground church pastor in Chengdu, the latter of whom was later arrested\n\nby the PRC government, by two contractors allegedly operating on behalf of the\n\nChinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). Regional branches of China’s Ministry\n\nof Public Security (MPS) have also been heavily involved in digital surveillance of\n\n[ethnic and religious minorities within the PRC, most notably by the Xinjiang Public](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1055)\n\nSecurity Bureau (XPSB) in the case of Uighur muslims.\n\nHistorically, the PRC has had a highly turbulent relationship with the Vatican\n\nand its governing body, the Holy See. In particular, the Holy See’s [recognition](https://time.com/5407912/china-vatican/)\n\n[of bishops within China’s historically persecuted “underground” Catholic church](https://time.com/5407912/china-vatican/)\n\n[traditionally loyal to the Vatican and its relationship with Taiwan has maintained](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2114277/vatican-insists-it-will-continue-recognise-taiwan)\n\nan absence of official relations since the 1950s. The CCP perceived this behavior\n\nas the Holy See interfering in religious matters within China. In September 2018,\n\n[the PRC and the Holy See reached a landmark two-year provisional agreement,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-china/vatican-china-sign-landmark-accord-on-appointing-bishops-idUSKCN1M20H7)\n\nmarking a significant step towards renewed diplomatic relations.\n\nUnder the provisional agreement, China would regain more control over\n\nunderground churches, and the Vatican in turn would gain increased influence\n\nover the appointment of bishops within the state-backed “official” Catholic church.\n\nThe deal was met with a [mixed reaction, with critics arguing that the deal was](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-vatican-pope-deal/vatican-deal-with-beijing-leaves-some-key-questions-unresolved-idUSKCN1MA0D6)\n\na betrayal of the underground church and would lead to increased persecution\n\nof its members. Many of the [harshest criticisms came from clergy within Hong](https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/coe/china-vatican-deal-an-incredible-betrayal-says-cardinal/)\n\n[Kong. A year after the agreement, numerous](https://www.ft.com/content/360bc752-f6ea-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654) [reports noted the Vatican’s silence in](https://cruxnow.com/church-in-asia/2019/12/catholics-split-vatican-largely-mum-on-hong-kong-protests/)\n\nresponse to the Hong Kong protests beginning in late 2019, in what critics called\n\nan effort to avoid offending Beijing and jeopardizing the 2018 agreement.\n\n**_Figure 2: Intelligence Card for RedDelta PlugX C2 Server 167.88.180[.]5._**\n\n\n###### Threat Analysis\n\n Overview of Catholic Church Intrusions\n\nUsing Recorded Future RAT controller detections and network traffic analysis\n\ntechniques, Insikt Group identified multiple PlugX C2 servers communicating with\n\nVatican hosts from mid-May until at least July 21, 2020. Concurrently, we identified\n\nPoison Ivy and Cobalt Strike Beacon C2 infrastructure also communicating with\n\nVatican hosts, a Vatican-themed phishing lure delivering PlugX, and the targeting\n\nof other entities associated with the Catholic Church.\n\n**_Figure 3: Vatican lure document targeting the head of Hong Kong study mission to China._**\n\n[The lure document shown above, which has been previously reported on in](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chinese-state-hackers-target-hong-kong-catholic-church/)\n\nrelation to links to Hong Kong Catholic Church targeting, was used to deliver a\n\ncustomized PlugX payload that communicated with the C2 domain systeminfor[.]\n\ncom. The document purported to be an official Vatican letter addressed to the\n\ncurrent head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China. It is currently unclear\n\nwhether the actors created the document themselves, or whether it is a legitimate\n\ndocument they were able to obtain and weaponize. Given that the letter was\n\ndirectly addressed to this individual, it is likely that he was the target of a\n\nspearphishing attempt. Additionally, as this sample was compiled after signs of\n\nan intrusion within the Vatican network, it is also possible that the phishing lure\n\nwas sent through a compromised Vatican account. This hypothesis is supported by\n\nthe identification of communications between PlugX C2s and a Vatican mail server\n\nin the days surrounding the sample’s compilation date and its first submission to\n\npublic malware repositories\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: Union of Catholic Asian News article lure document (left), and Qum, the Vatican of Islam_**\n_lure document (right)._\n\nThe head of the Hong Kong Study Mission is considered the Pope’s de facto\n\nrepresentative to China and a key link between Beijing and the Vatican. The\n\npredecessor to this role played a key part in the finalization of the 2018 provisional\n\nChina-Vatican agreement, making his successor a valuable target for intelligence\n\n[gathering ahead of the deal’s expiry and likely renewal in September 2020.](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2020/06/vatican-agreement-with-china-likely-to-be-renewed-archbishop-says/)\n\nFurther entities associated with the Catholic Church were also targeted by\n\nRedDelta in June and July 2020 using PlugX, including the mail servers of an\n\ninternational missionary center based in Italy and the Catholic Diocese of Hong\n\nKong.\n\nInsikt Group identified two additional phishing lures loading the same\n\ncustomized PlugX variant, which both communicated with the same C2\n\ninfrastructure as the Vatican lure. The first sample included a lure document\n\nspoofing a news bulletin from the Union of Catholic Asian News regarding the\n\nimpending introduction of the new Hong Kong national security law. The content\n\nof the lure file, titled “About China’s plan for Hong Kong security law.doc,” was\n\n[taken from a legitimate Union of Catholic Asian News article. The other sample also](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8UDJsKVQyxYJ:https://www.ucanews.com/news/alarm-over-chinas-plan-for-hong-kong-security-law/88118+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk)\n\nreferences the Vatican using a document titled “QUM, IL VATICANO DELL’ISLAM.\n\ndoc” for the decoy document. This particular decoy document translates as “Qum,\n\nthe Vatican of Islam,” referring to the Iranian city of Qum (Qom), an important\n\nShi’ite political and religious center. It is taken from the writings of Franco Ometto,\n\n\na Italian Catholic academic living in Iran. Although the direct target of these two\n\nlures are unclear, both relate to the Catholic church.\n\nWe believe that this targeting is indicative of both China’s objective in\n\nconsolidating increased control over the underground Catholic Church within\n\nChina, and diminishing the perceived influence of the Vatican on Chinese Catholics.\n\nSimilarly, a focus on Hong Kong Catholics amid pro-democracy protests and the\n\nrecent sweeping national security law is in line with Chinese strategic interests,\n\n[particularly given the Anti-Beijing stance of many of its members, including former](https://www.ft.com/content/360bc752-f6ea-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654)\n\n[Hong Kong Bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun.](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/the-vatican-lost-everything-got-nothing-an-interview-with-cardinal-zen-80278)\n\n###### Other Targeted Organizations\n\nInsikt Group identified several additional suspected victims communicating\n\nwith RedDelta C2 infrastructure.

The group\n\nconsistently registered domains through GoDaddy, with WHOIS data providing\n\nadditional linkages between domains used by the threat activity group. Insikt\n\nGroup identified two primary clusters of RedDelta infrastructure used throughout\n\nthis campaign, referred to as the “PlugX cluster” and the “Poison Ivy and Cobalt\n\nStrike cluster.” A Maltego chart is included below displaying these clusters.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: Maltego chart of RedDelta infrastructure._**\n\n###### ‘Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian’ and the PlugX Cluster\n\nVatican hosts and several other victim organizations were communicating\n\nwith the PlugX C2 167.88.180[.]5 from May until June 10, 2020. This IP hosted the\n\ndomain cabsecnow[.]com over this time period. Cabsecnow[.]com then resolved to\n\na new IP, 103.85.24[.]136, from June 10 onwards.

For instance,\n\nMustang Panda has typically [used Windows Shortcut (LNK) files containing an](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\n\nembedded HTA (HTML Application) file with a VBScript or PowerShell script to load\n\nPlugX and Cobalt Strike Beacon payloads. However, in this campaign, RedDelta\n\nused ZIP files containing legitimate executables masquerading as lure documents,\n\na notable departure from Mustang Panda activity that has been publicly reported\n\npreviously. This legitimate executable is used to load a malicious DLL also\n\npresent within the ZIP file through DLL sideloading, before the target is shown\n\na decoy document. While Mustang Panda have used DLL sideloading previously,\n\nthe PlugX variant used in association with this campaign has key differences\n\nfrom more traditional PlugX variants, particularly in the C2 protocol used and\n\nthe configuration encoding within the samples, leading us to refer to it as the\n\n“RedDelta PlugX” variant below — however, this is not intended to suggest that\n\nthis variant is used exclusively by this group and is in reference to the first group\n\nwe have seen using this variant.\n\n**_Figure 7: Execution diagram of the malware associated with RedDelta PlugX._**\n\n###### RedDelta PlugX: ‘Hong Kong Security Law’ Lure\n\nThe first sample, titled “About China’s plan for Hong Kong security\n\nlaw.zip” (SHA256:86590f80b4e1608d0367a7943468304f7eb665c9195\n\nc24996281b1a958bc1512), corresponds to the Union of Catholic Asian News lure\n\ndelivering the RedDelta PlugX variant. Although Insikt Group does not have full\n\nvisibility into this infection chain, the ZIP file is likely to have been delivered via a\n\nspearphishing email. The ZIP contains two files:\n\n|File Name|About China’s plan for Hong Kong security law.exe|\n|---|---|\n|SHA256 Hash|6c959cfb001fbb900958441dfd8b262fb33e052342 948bab338775d3e83ef7f7 Hash|\n\n|File Name|wwlib.dll|\n|---|---|\n|SHA256 Hash|f6e5a3a32fb3aaf3f2c56ee482998b09a6ced0a60 c38088e7153f3ca247ab1cc Hash|\n\n\n###### Stage 1: Wwlib.dll DLL Sideload and Hk.dat Download and Execution\n\n“About China’s plan for Hong Kong security law.exe” is a legitimate Windows\n\nloader for Microsoft Word that is vulnerable to sideloading. When executed, it\n\nsideloads the malicious DLL, “wwlib.dll.”\n\nWwlib.dll initializes the loading stage by downloading, decoding, and executing\n\nan XOR-encoded Windows executable file, hk.dat, from http://167.88.180[.]198/\n\nhk.dat. Next, wwlib.dll will extract a Word document, “About China’s plan for Hong\n\nKong security law.docx” from its resource section and open it to make it appear to\n\nthe user that a legitimate Microsoft Word document was opened.\n\n###### Stage 2: Hk.exe/AAM Updates.exe DLL Sideloading to Load PlugX Variant\n\nAfter “hk.dat” is decoded and executed, it will create three files in the\n\nC:\\%APPDATA%/local/temp directory:\n\n - Hk.exe (SHA256: 0459e62c5444896d5be404c559c834ba455fa5cae1689c\n\n70fc8c61bc15468681) - A legitimate Adobe executable that is vulnerable\n\nto DLL sideloading\n\n\n-----\n\n - Hex.dll (SHA256: bc6c2fda18f8ee36930b469f6500e28096eb6795e5fd17c\n\n44273c67bc9fa6a6d) - The malicious DLL sideloaded by hk.exe that\n\ndecodes and loads adobeupdate.dat\n\n - Adobeupdate.dat (SHA256: 01c1fd0e5b8b7bbed62bc8a6f7c9ceff1725d4ff\n\n6ee86fa813bf6e70b079812f) - The RedDelta PlugX variant loader\n\nNext, “hk.exe” is executed and creates copies of the files “adobeupdate.dat,”\n\n“hex.dll,” and itself renamed as “AAM Updates.exe” in the folder “C:\\ProgramData\\\n\nAAM UpdatesIIw.” “AAM Updates.exe” is then executed, starting the installation\n\nprocess by sideloading the malicious “hex.dll.” “Hex.dll” will decode and execute\n\n“adobeupdate.dat,” which ultimately leads to the execution of the RedDelta PlugX\n\nvariant in memory. This use of DLL sideloading, including the use of this specific\n\nAdobe executable, aligns with recent public reporting of Mustang Panda PlugX\n\n[use (1, 2).](https://insights.oem.avira.com/new-wave-of-plugx-targets-hong-kong/)\n\n###### RedDelta PlugX: ‘Qum, the Vatican of Islam’ Lure\n\nThe second PlugX sample uses the same loading method identified above. In\n\nthis case, the same WINWORD.exe executable is used to load another malicious\n\nwwlib.dll file. The sample then contacts http://103.85.24[.]190/qum.dat to retrieve\n\nthe XOR-encoded Windows executable file, qum.dat. This sample uses the same\n\nC2 as above, www.systeminfor[.]com.\n\n###### RedDelta PlugX: Vatican Lure Targeting Hong Kong Study Mission\n\nThe final PlugX sample featuring the Vatican Hong Kong Study Mission\n\nlure also uses largely the same PlugX loading method. In this case, the ZIP file\n\ncontains a benign Adobe Reader executable, AcroRd32.exe, renamed “DOC\n2020-05-15T092742.441.exe,” which is used to load the malicious acrord32.dll\n\nfile through DLL sideloading. In this case the sample retrieves the file dis.dat from\n\nhttp://167.88.180[.]198/dis.dat and uses the same C2 referenced in the previous\n\nsamples.\n\n###### RedDelta PlugX: Installation Process\n\nInsikt Group performed detailed analysis on the DAT files related to the “Union\n\nof Catholic Asian News” and “Qum, the Vatican of Islam” lure. Analysis of these\n\nsamples showed two DAT files were downloaded from the URLs listed in the table\n\nbelow:\n\n**File Name** **Download Location** **SHA256 Hash**\n\n2fb4a17ece461ade1a2b63bb8db1\n\nhk.dat http://167.88.180[.]198/hk.dat 9947636c6ae39c4c674fb4b7d4f9\n\n0275d20\n\n476f80521bf6789d02f475f67e0f4\n\nhttp://103.85.24[.]190/qum.\nqum.dat ede830c4a700c3f7f64d99e8118\n\ndat\n\n35a39e\n\nIn each case, the file (“hk.dat” or “qum.dat“) is downloaded and executed after\n\ninitial execution of the phishing lure, as described above in “Stage 1: Wwlib.dll DLL\n\nSideload and Hk.dat Download and Execution.” Both files are RtlCompress/LZNT1\n\ncompressed, as well as XOR-encoded. The XOR key precedes the encoded data,\n\nallowing the file to be more easily decoded during static analysis. A Python script\n\n[to decompress and decode the payload can be found on our GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research/blob/master/RedDelta/RedDelta_PlugX_Install_DAT_Decoder.py)\n\nAfter the DAT files are decompressed and decoded, they are executed. The\n\nexecution details for “hk.dat” have been detailed above (see: “Stage 2: Hk.exe/AAM\n\n\nUpdates.exe DLL Sideloading to Load PlugX Variant“) and are nearly identical to\n\nthat of “qum.dat.” As with the hk.dat sample associated with the “Union of Catholic\n\nAsian News” lure, the main purpose of this stage of the malware is to perform the\n\nDLL sideloading step in order to execute the PlugX variant.\n\nAgain, the final stage consists of three files: a non-malicious executable, a\n\nmalicious sideloaded DLL, and the encoded DAT file which are all used to sideload\n\nthe final payload. This is consistent with a typical PlugX installation.\n\nLike the first-stage DAT files, the PlugX loaderDAT file is XOR-encoded and\n\nthe decode key precedes the encoded data in the file; however, they are not\n\nRtlCompress/LZNT1 compressed as the initial stage files are. A Python script to\n\ndecode the PlugX loader, as well as the configuration block, is contained on our\n\n[GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research/blob/master/RedDelta/RedDelta_PlugX_Loader_Decoder.py)\n\n###### RedDelta: An Updated PlugX Variant\n\nThe PlugX variant used in the RedDelta campaign is similar to the PlugX\n\nvariants previously associated with Mustang Panda by [Avira and](https://insights.oem.avira.com/new-wave-of-plugx-targets-hong-kong/) [Anomali. Both](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\n\nmake heavy use of stack strings as an obfuscation mechanism, as seen in Figure\n\n8, making it harder for an analyst to use strings to determine the functionality or\n\npurpose of the code.\n\n|File Name|Download Location|SHA256 Hash|\n|---|---|---|\n|hk.dat|http://167.88.180[.]198/hk.dat|2fb4a17ece461ade1a2b63bb8db1 9947636c6ae39c4c674fb4b7d4f9 0275d20|\n|qum.dat|http://103.85.24[.]190/qum. dat|476f80521bf6789d02f475f67e0f4 ede830c4a700c3f7f64d99e8118 35a39e|\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 8: Comparison of Anomali/Avira PlugX variant stack string implementation and RedDelta stack_**\n_string implementation._\n\nHowever, the configuration block for the RedDelta PlugX variant has one\n\nkey distinction: the [Avira-reported Mustang Panda configuration block decoding](https://insights.oem.avira.com/new-wave-of-plugx-targets-hong-kong/)\n\nfunction looks for the string “XXXXXXXX” to determine whether the configuration\n\nis encoded, while the RedDelta variant looks for the string “########.” Apart from\n\nthe different demarcator strings, both variants use the same rolling XOR encoding\n\nwith the key “123456789.” The configuration block decode routine can be seen\n\nin Figure 9, below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: Comparison of configuration block in Anomali/Avira PlugX (showing the “XXXXXXXX”**\n_demarcator) and the RedDelta configuration block (showing the “########” demarcator)._\n\nA Python implementation of this algorithm can be observed in Figure 10,\n\nbelow.\n\n**_Figure 10: Python implementation of RedDelta PlugX configuration block decoding mechanism._**\n\nIn conventional PlugX samples, the configuration block is encrypted with a\n\nmore complex algorithm using multiple keys in combination with shift left and shift\n\nright bitwise operations. For example, the Python code implementing this algorithm,\n\nas seen in Figure 11, was created by [Kyle Creyts based on Takahiro Haruyama’s](https://github.com/kcreyts/plugxdecoder)\n\nextensive research and analysis on PlugX.\n\n\n**_Figure 11: Python implementation of traditional PlugX configuration block decoding mechanism by_**\n_Kyle Creyts._\n\nThe configuration block encryption associated with the RedDelta variant is\n\nconsiderably less sophisticated when compared to traditional PlugX samples, and\n\nwhile both make use of XOR-based ciphers, the simple algorithm used by RedDelta\n\nwould be easier to brute force by an analyst.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Command and Control Protocol\n\nThe C2 protocol used for the RedDelta PlugX malware differs from the Mustang\n\nPanda PlugX. While both variants use the HTTP POST method common to PlugX\n\nincluding the number of “61456” in the POST header field which is a clear indicator\n\nof a PlugX HTTP POST. However, the RedDelta variant does not include the URI\n\nstring “/update?wd=” more commonly associated with PlugX, as seen in Figure 12.\n\n**_Figure 12: HTTP POST request from Anomali/Avira PlugX variant and RedDelta PlugX variant._**\n\nThe RedDelta PlugX variant encrypts its C2 communications very differently\n\nwhen compared to the Mustang Panda variant reported by Anomali and Avira.\n\nInstead of using XOR encoding, RedDelta uses RC4 encryption where the first\n\n10 bytes of the passcode are hardcoded and the last four bytes are randomly\n\ngenerated and included as a key within the TCP packet so that the communication\n\ncan be decrypted. The hardcoded portion of the RC4 passphrase is “!n&U*O%Pb$.”\n\nFigure 13 shows the function where the RC4 passphrase is defined as well as\n\nwhere the last four bytes are appended to create the full key. A Python script to\n\ndecode the RedDelta C2 communication from a supplied PCAP can be found on\n\n[our GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research/blob/master/RedDelta/RedDelta_PlugX_C2_Decrypt.py)\n\nDespite the different C2 encryption schemes, both RedDelta and Mustang\n\nPanda variants’ C2 traffic decrypts to the familiar PlugX header format, as shown\n\nin Figure 14.\n\n**_Figure 14: PlugX header and data._**\n\nIn conventional PlugX samples, the C2 uses the same algorithm as in the\n\nconfiguration decode (see Figure 11), with part of the key being the first four bytes\n\nof the TCP transmission. While the RedDelta PlugX variant also uses the first four\n\nbytes of the TCP transmission as a part of the key, the use of RC4 for C2 encryption\n\ndemonstrates a departure from the usual PlugX C2 traffic encryption mechanism.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Recorded Future has not done extensive code analysis to further\n\ncompare the samples, we have highlighted fundamental differences between the\n\nRedDelta PlugX variants and conventional PlugX, notably in the configuration block\n\nand C2 communication. Additionally, while RedDelta has implemented a modular\n\ndelivery system based on traditional PlugX tactics, it also provides the group with\n\nthe ability to change, enhance or remove functionality as needed.\n\nFile Name OneDrive.exe\n\nSHA256 Hash 7824eb5f173c43574593bd3afab41a60e0e2ffae80201a9b884721b451e6d935\n\n###### Cobalt Strike\n\nThe file, OneDrive.exe, is responsible for loading the Cobalt Strike payload.\n\nWhen executed, OneDrive will reach out to http://154.213.21[.]27/DotNetLoader40.\n\nexe, download the file DotNetLoader40.exe and invoke the “RunRemoteCode”\n\nfunction contained within it.\n\nDotNetLoader40.exe is a small .NET executable that essentially downloads and\n\nthen executes shellcode.

This also supports the CCP’s wider [stated goal of](https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/chinese-communist-party-vows-to-sinicize-religions-in-china/)\n\n“sinicizing religions” in China. Furthermore, it demonstrates that China’s interest\n\nin control and surveillance of religious minorities is not confined to those within\n\nthe “Five Poisons,” exemplified by the [continued persecution and detainment of](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/underground-catholic-bishop-arrested-in-china-62088)\n\nunderground church members and [allegations of physical surveillance of official](https://time.com/5757591/wang-yi-prison-sentence-china-christianity/)\n\nCatholic and Protestant churches.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom recently\n\n[expressed concern regarding the impact of the new national security law within](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/US-fears-for-Hong-Kong-s-religious-freedom-under-security-law)\n\nHong Kong, stating it has the “potential to significantly undermine religious\n\nfreedom.” The targeting of the Catholic diocese of Hong Kong is likely a valuable\n\nintelligence source for both monitoring the diocese’s position on Hong Kong’s pro\ndemocracy movement and its relations with the Vatican. This marks a possible\n\nprecursor to increased limits on religious freedom within the special administrative\n\nregion, particularly where it coincides with pro-democracy or anti-Beijing positions.\n\nRedDelta is a highly active threat activity group targeting entities relevant\n\nto Chinese strategic interests. Despite the group’s consistent use of well-known\n\ntools such as PlugX and Cobalt Strike, infrastructure reuse, and operations security\n\nfailures, these intrusions indicate RedDelta is still being tasked to satisfy intelligence\n\nrequirements. In particular, this campaign demonstrates a clear objective to target\n\nreligious bodies, and therefore we feel this is particularly pertinent for religious\n\nand non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to take note and invest in network\n\ndefenses to counter the threat posed by Chinese state-sponsored threat activity\n\ngroups like RedDelta. A lack of ability to invest in security and detection measures\n\nfor many NGOs and religious organizations greatly increases the likelihood of\n\nsuccess for well-resourced and persistent groups, even using well-documented\n\ntools, TTPs, and infrastructure.\n\n\n###### Network Defense Recommendations\n\nRecorded Future recommends that users conduct the following measures to\n\ndetect and mitigate activity associated with RedDelta activity:\n\n   - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention\n\nsystems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on —\n\nand upon review, consider blocking illicit connection attempts from — the\n\nexternal IP addresses and domains listed in the appendix.\n\nAdditionally, we advise organizations to follow the following general\n\ninformation security best practice guidelines:\n\n   - Keep all software and applications up to date; in particular, operating\n\nsystems, antivirus software, and core system utilities.\n\n   - Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.\n\n  - Make regular backups of your system and store the backups offline,\n\npreferably offsite so that data cannot be accessed via the network.\n\n   - Have a well-thought-out incident response and communications plan.\n\n  - Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data. In\n\nparticular, look at which data anyone with access to an employee account\n\nor device would have access to (for example, through device or account\n\ntakeover via phishing).\n\n   - Strongly consider instituting role-based access, limiting company-wide\n\ndata access, and restricting access to sensitive data.\n\n   - Employ host-based controls; one of the best defenses and warning signals\n\nto thwart attacks is to conduct client-based host logging and intrusion\n\ndetection capabilities.\n\n  - Implement basic incident response and detection deployments and\n\ncontrols like network IDS, netflow collection, host logging, and web proxy,\n\nalongside human monitoring of detection sources.\n\n   - Be aware of partner or supply chain security standards. Being able to\n\nmonitor and enforce security standards for ecosystem partners is an\n\nimportant part of any organization’s security posture.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy\n\nRecorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks threat actors\n\nand their activity, focusing on state actors from China, Iran, Russia,\n\nand North Korea, as well as cyber criminals - individuals and groups\n\n- from Russia, CIS states, China, Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize\n\ntracking activity groups and where possible, attributing them to\n\nnation state government, organizations, or affiliate institutions.\n\nOur coverage includes:\n\n   - Government organizations and intelligence agencies,\n\ntheir associated laboratories, partners, industry\n\n\n###### ADVERSARY\n\n\ncollaborators, proxy entities, and individual threat\n\nactors.\n\n   - Recorded Future-identified, suspected nation state\n\nactivity groups, such as RedAlpha, RedBravo, Red Delta,\n\nand BlueAlpha and many other industry established\n\ngroups.\n\n   - Cybercriminal individuals and groups established and\n\nnamed by Recorded Future\n\n   - Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific,persistent\n\ncommodity malware\n\nInsikt Group names a new threat activity group or campaign\n\nwhen analysts have data corresponding to at least three points\n\non the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium\n\nconfidence, derived from our Security Intelligence Graph. We can tie\n\nthis to a threat actor only when we can point to a handle, persona,\n\nperson, or organization responsible. We will write about the activity\n\nas a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary data. We\n\nuse the most widely-utilized or recognized name for a particular\n\ngroup when the public body of empirical evidence is clear the activity\n\ncorresponds to a known group.\n\nInsikt Group utilizes a simple color and phonetic alphabet\n\nnaming convention for new nation state threat actor groups or\n\ncampaigns. The color corresponds to that nation’s flag colors,\n\ncurrently represented below, with more color/nation pairings to\n\nbe added as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups\n\nassociated with new nations.\n\nFor newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt Group uses a\n\nnaming convention corresponding to the Greek alphabet. Where we\n\nhave identified a criminal entity connected to a particular country,\n\nwe will use the appropriate country color, and where that group may\n\nbe tied to a specific government organization, tie it to that entity\n\nspecifically.\n\nInsikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming newly\n\nidentified malware.\n\n\n###### INFRASTRUCTURE CAPABILITY\n\n
