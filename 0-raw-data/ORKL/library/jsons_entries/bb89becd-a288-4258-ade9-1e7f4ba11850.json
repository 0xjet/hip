    "plain_text": "# Who is Mr Ding?\n\n**[intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2020/01/14/who-is-mr-ding](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2020/01/14/who-is-mr-ding)**\n\nintrusiontruth January 14, 2020\n\nWe started by stating that Chinese APTs have a blueprint that us applied in multiple regions\nacross China: contract hackers and specialists, front companies, and an intelligence officer.\nApplying this blueprint in Hainan, we surfaced inter-linked companies recruiting for people\nwith hacking and specialist IT skills.\n\nWe have identified that Professor Gu Jian is connected to the front company Hainan Xiandun\nand supported some of their activities from his position at Hainan University. But his was\nmore of a supporting role. Who was in charge?\n\n**Wang Tian, Manager Jiang, and Mr Chen**\n\nJob adverts for Hainan Tengyuan, Hainan Yili and Hainan Xiandun list Wang Tian (王天) and\nManager Jiang (蒋经理) as contacts of the companies. We have been unable to identify\nmuch more about these individuals.\n\n\n-----\n\nHainan Xiandun – Manager Jiang\n\nHainan Tengyuan – Wang Tian\n\nHainan Yili – Wang Tian\n**Mr Chen**\n\nAn advert on Sichuan University’s website for a Penetration Test Engineer position at Hainan\nXiandun lists ‘Mr Chen’ (陈先生) using 2918588955[at]qq.com and telephone number\n13198985613 as the contact person.\n\nHainan Xiandun – Mr Chen\n\n\n-----\n\nMr Chen is seen on a number of job adverts for these Hainan front companies. While it s\nunclear who Mr Chen is, the website registrant for one of the front companies which we\nidentified, Hainan Yanwu, is listed as a Mr Chen Yanwu (陈彦武).\n\nHainan Yanwu historical WHOIS\n**Are any of these contacts real people?**\n\nThe number of contacts listed and the re-use of telephone numbers raised our suspicions.\nWe started to think that perhaps some, or all, of these contact names were fictitious. We\nreached out to our trusted network of contributors and posed the question: who was the real\nowner of these telephone numbers and email addresses?\n\n**So, who is Mr Ding?**\n\nWhile researching the phone numbers from these companies, one of our contributors turned\nup this information linking phone number 15638338966 (you’ll remember that from an earlier\njob advert for Hainan Xiandun, in the name Mr Chen) with a new e-mail address:\ndxy0015@163.com.\n\nRelationship between 15638338966 and\n\ndxy0015@163.com\nWhy is that e-mail address important? Because this information, from a frequent flyer\naccount, shows that dxy0015@163.com and the phone number belong not to a Mr Wang, or\na Mr Jiang, or a Mr Chen, but to a Mr Ding Xiaoyang (丁晓阳), who is very much a real\nperson.\n\n\n-----\n\nDing Xiaoyang’s name (丁晓阳) appears in this e-mail from Hainan airlines to\ndxy0015@163.com\nWe are extremely grateful to our contributor for their diligent work in finding this information.\nOur thanks also go out to Mr Ding for not changing his password after it had been leaked\nonline.\n\n**In summary: in some cases the contacts for these front companies in Hainan may be**\n**aliases. Other than Hainan University academic Gu Jian, the only individual that we**\n**have been able to link to the adverts is the true owner of one of the telephone**\n**numbers: Hainan resident Ding Xiaoyang.**\n\n**Is Ding the person in charge of these front companies? Does Ding have connections**\n**to the Chinese State? We know the answer, he knows the answer, do you?**\n\n\n-----",
