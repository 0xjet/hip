Subject to Enforcement Pending Enforcement Retired Terms Regional Definitions\n\n The first three sections identify all terms that have been adopted by the NERC Board of Trustees for use in continent-wide standards; the Regional definitions section identifies all terms that have been adopted by the NERC Board of Trustees for use in regional standards.\n\n Most of the terms identified in this glossary were adopted as part of the development of NERC’s initial set of reliability standards, called the “Version 0” standards. Subsequent to the development of Version 0 standards, new definitions have been developed and approved following NERC’s Reliability Standards Development Process, and added to this glossary following board adoption, with the “FERC effective” date added following a final Order approving the definition.\n\n Any comments regarding this glossary should be reported to the NERC Help Desk at https://support.nerc.net/. Select \"Standards\" from the Applications drop down menu and \"Other\" from the Standards Subcategories drop down menu.\n\n\n-----\n\n#####                                                          SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT\n\n|Continent-wide Term Actual Net Interchange (NI ) A|Link to Project Page|Acronym|BOT Adoption Date|FERC Approval Date|Effective Date|Definition The algebraic sum of actual megawatt transfers across all Tie Lines, including Pseudo‐Ties, to and from all Adjacent Balancing Authority areas within the same Interconnection.
