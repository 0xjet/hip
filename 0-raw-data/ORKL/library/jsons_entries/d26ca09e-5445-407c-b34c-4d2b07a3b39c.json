For**\n**the first time, sanctions have also targeted the Bitcoin mixer Blender.io, which is**\n**designed to obfuscate blockchain transactions.**\n\nThe sanctions – issued by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) – targeted 45\nBitcoin addresses linked to Blender.io and four new wallets linked to the Lazarus Group.\n\n## Lazarus Group\n\nOn March 29th, the North Korean cyberhacking organization stole $540 million from a\ndecentralized protocol allowing users to bridge their assets between Ethereum and the\npopular blockchain game Axie Infinity. The heist was the second largest crypto theft of all\ntime.\n\n[As previously identified, the Lazarus Group began laundering its funds through centralized](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/540-million-stolen-from-the-ronin-defi-bridge)\nexchanges and the popular Ethereum-based mixer Tornado Cash, which announced soon\nafter that it would be complying with US-based sanctions. It was previously believed that the\nLazarus Group had moved some of the stolen funds into Bitcoin. Today’s sanctioning of\nBlender.io appears to confirm this.\n\nBetween April 24th and May 4th, the Lazarus Group sent around $273.9 million of Ether to\nthe four newly-sanctioned addresses. The transactions involved amounts significantly larger\nthan its previous laundering efforts. The ramping up of laundering efforts in this manner\npotentially reflects a growing desperation by the hackers, who were previously targeted with\nsanctions by OFAC on the 14th and 22nd of April.\n\nOne of the addresses sanctioned today had already managed to send around $37 million\nthrough Tornado Cash prior to the sanctions announcement – leaving just over $236 million\nin the sanctioned addresses.\n\n## Blender.io\n\nFurthemore, in a continued effort to combat money laundering by the Lazarus Group, today’s\nactions mark the first time in which a virtual currency mixer has been sanctioned. According\nto an OFAC press release, Blender.io has been used by North Korea to support its money\nlaundering activities – including the laundering of over $20.5 million connected to the Ronin\nhack.\n\nElliptic’s analysis indicates that Blender.io has also previously been used to launder funds\nfrom Hydra market, a Russian language darknet market which was sanctioned by OFAC\nearlier this month.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Elliptic has taken urgent action to label the newly sanctioned addresses in our**\n**systems. Our customers will now be able to screen and be alerted for any activity**\n**relating to these addresses. View our** **[transaction monitoring and](https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/crypto-transaction-monitoring)** **[screening tools to](https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/crypto-wallet-screening)**\n**find out more or** **[contact us for a demo.](https://www.elliptic.co/schedule-demo)**\n\n**You can also download Elliptic’s** **[Guide to Sanctions Compliance in Cryptocurrencies](https://www.elliptic.co/resources/elliptic-guide-to-sanctions-compliance-in-cryptocurrencies)**\n**for case studies and examples of how to use blockchain analytics for OFAC**\n**compliance.**\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis blog is provided for general informational purposes only.
