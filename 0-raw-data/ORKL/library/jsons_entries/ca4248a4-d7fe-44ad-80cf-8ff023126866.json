However, it is undeniable that China has developed into a key actor in world politics, and\nother states cannot overlook or ignore its opinion or intentions on whichever considered terrain. With its immense\nand growing influence over the whole planet, cyberspace is no exception.\n\nAccording to Internet Live Stats, the number of internet users has already surpassed 3.4 billion, with 721 million\ncoming from China.[1] Naturally, China is increasingly dependent on various cyber assets and the Chinese authorities\nhave reacted accordingly. We have witnessed a growing emphasis on cyber security measures, as well as an increase\nin the country’s readiness to take advantage of the opportunities that the internet provides, and to respond to the\nthreats it poses to national security. With the largest population in the world, China holds a sizeable pool of experts\nwith potential value for the government and its cyber operations.\n\nUnderstanding China’s cyber structure, strategies and organisation is not an easy task. The Chinese have not\nestablished an exhaustive approach to cyber issues in the form of a strategy clearly outlining the country’s cyber\nobjectives and their execution. This has created much uncertainty for both China’s domestic environment and,\nunderstandably, outsiders for whom the complex hierarchies, command structures and various defence papers are\nvery confusing. Even though the Chinese do not seem to mind a certain degree of mystery, a step suggesting their\nincreasing desire to manage their cyber operations more efficiently can be seen in the recent creation of the Central\nInternet Security and Information Leading Group, for which Xi Jinping has taken personal responsibility to define\nChina’s cyber strategy. This also stands as a good example of how the Chinese understand cyber as something\nstrongly integrated with society, and do not separate it from the general flow of governance. Admittedly, the\nchallenges that originate from such a distinctive approach to cyber have great potential to affect the Western world’s\nactivities in cyberspace for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, the way in which the world’s biggest internet community is governed influences the overall development of\nthe internet worldwide. Granting netizens the opportunity to become a part of the online world free from physical\nconstraints, or restricting their access to information and using the internet as a tool against dissent are the two\nfundamentally different choices facing the Chinese government. As it has so far stuck to the second option, China’s\nparticipation in the global internet community has been greatly hindered, and thus countless opportunities for\ncooperation have been missed.\n\nSecondly, there is significant evidence that the Chinese government, together with the Chinese military, private\ncorporations, and unaffiliated citizens, conduct intrusions against major Western powers as well as in the\nneighbouring region every day, targeting academia, industry and government facilities for the purpose of amassing\ntechnological secrets.[2] For example, the Chinese have, among other high-tech weapon system designs, obtained\nthose of the F-35 stealth fighter – America’s most expensive military investment ever.[3] The underlying purpose of\nthese activities is to gain advantage in the economic, political and military fields, and often simply show the extensive\nharm they are capable of causing should the need arise.\n\n1 Internet Live Stats compiles data from six major reliable agencies, including the International Telecommunications Unit and\nthe World Bank.

Internet Live Stats compiles data from six major reliable agencies,\nincluding the International Telecommunications Unit and the World Bank.\n2 Richard Clarke, a former special advisor on cyber security to President George W. Bush, illustrates the situation rather\ncomprehensively, believing the Chinese hacking to be unprecedented in the history of espionage: ‘Exabytes of data have been\n_copied from universities, industrial labs, and government facilities. The secrets behind everything from pharmaceutical formulas_\n_to bioengineering designs, to nanotechnology, to weapons systems, to everyday industrial products have been taken by the_\n_People’s Liberation Army and by private hacking groups and given to China.’ Clarke, Richard A., and Robert K.

Reveron (eds)\n_China and Cybersecurity: Espionage, Strategy and Politics in the Digital Domain. Oxford University Press, 2015._\n\n5 Introduction\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile some experts suggest that China’s cyber units have so far ‘outmanned and outclassed’[4] their adversaries, the\nWest has actually demonstrated firm responses. For instance, several Chinese telecommunication companies such\nas Huawei have been banned from contracting and acquiring any broadband network providers in the US and\nAustralia.[5] It seems that whichever direction the Chinese offensive cyber capabilities develop, the West is unwilling\nto accept any growing danger to its private information, cyber infrastructure or security in general.[6]\n\nIn order to establish a comprehensive understanding of China’s cyber attitude, it is of paramount importance to\nknow its strengths and weaknesses. For that purpose, this paper aims to give readers a detailed overview of China’s\ncyber capabilities, related documents and strategies, and the general command structure of its tactical execution\nlayer. Importantly, the country’s distinct approach raises the necessity of introducing the general national strategic\nthinking and framework into which cyber falls. The paper acts as a comprehensive starting point for anyone aiming\nto get a foothold on affairs related to China and cyber. 1.\n\n## China’s Cyber Background and Related Challenges 1.1.\n\n### Free Information and Foreign Technologies Seen as Threats\n\nAs with most states, China is heavily dependent on technology, making the government highly concerned about\ndevelopments regarding the internet and the information flow that it generates. The Chinese see uncontrolled\ninformation as a threat to the regime, paying great efforts to obtain the economic gains that the internet provides,\nbut simultaneously maintaining political control.[7] It is believed that, for the Chinese, the whole concept of the\ninternet is built around controlling information through real-time censorship, constituting a completely different\nview from that in the West.[8] Indeed, ever since the internet became a publicly available communication platform in\nChina, the question was not whether to control it, but rather how to control it.[9] The most explicit example of such\nregulatory measures is of course the Great Firewall of China, which by monitoring all traffic in Chinese cyberspace\nenables the authorities to deny access to a variety of selected websites and disconnect all Chinese networks from\nthe global internet network.\n\nOther than being afraid of the growth of internal opposition through information, the government is also very\nsensitive about foreign information systems. Despite local technology and telecom companies’ efforts to supply high\nquality products for domestic use, a large part of technology connected to Chinese networks still originates from the\nWest. Chinese officials are convinced that these systems are equipped with Trojan horses and loopholes to steal\nChina’s national secrets and prevent its further economic upsurge.[10] To counter these fears, the government has\n\n4 Hannas, William C., James C.

Yet, demonstrating how far the Chinese still are from the desired\ntechnological independence, Beijing was not particularly pleased when in early 2014, Microsoft decided to stop\ncustomer support for Windows XP, the operating system used extensively in Chinese government computers. 1.2.\n\n### Chinese Views on Controlling Cyberspace\n\nPublic discussion about the nature and future of cyberspace was brought to the international level only very\nrecently.[11] In 2013, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts, including the representative from China,\nconcluded that the UN Charter and international law are fully applicable to state behaviour in cyberspace, a position\nwhich has also been taken by NATO countries.[12] However, this position impliedly assumes the use of already existing\ninstitutional framework, which, facilitated by ICANN, is more multi-stakeholder than intergovernmental. The latter\nwould better allow each government to regulate the internet itself, the main premise of China’s strong belief in socalled ‘cyber sovereignty’.\n\nChina has introduced its alternative position through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the UN\nGeneral Assembly, together with Russia and several Central Asian countries, first in 2011, with a revised version in\nJanuary 2015.[13] A common line between the SCO countries is a belief in the primacy of the nation state, which should\nbe carried over into cyberspace.[14] According to a report by the US-China Security Review Commission, this allows\nthe Chinese to dwell on two corollaries. Firstly, the users of cyberspace, both domestic and foreign citizens within a\nstate’s territory, should be controlled by the host state, a clear contradiction of the Western position which supports\na liberal cyberspace respecting human rights.[15] In China’s political culture, maintaining social order is unquestionably\nmore important than individual privacy.[16] Secondly, China is particularly sensitive in exercising its right to sovereignty\nin cyberspace and does not want it to be interfered with by any other state or international organisation.[17] Therefore,\nsomewhat contradictory to its position regarding the UN report, China does not see international law as the main\nregulator of cyberspace, but prefers each state setting its own rules.[18] China has also criticised the Tallinn Manual as\nan effort to manipulate cyberspace through law.[19]\n\nAnother concern characterising China’s attitude towards general governance of cyberspace is its antipathy to the\nUS. As many official statements by the Chinese press, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and academics have shown,\nChina is concerned about the US using its status and influence as the world’s leading technology power to establish\ninternational rules and norms favourable to the US. Thus, China often justifies its actions in cyberspace as a response\nto hostile developments by the US military.[20] A point further strengthening this understanding is the fact that ICANN\n\n11 When talking about rules in the internet, it is necessary to distinguish between two separate concepts. First, ‘internet\ngovernance’ is a term for norms, rules and procedures that shape the use of the internet in general, and is facilitated by the\nInternet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Different from ‘Internet governance’ is the framework of how a\nsovereign state behaves in cyberspace.\n12 _Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of_\n_International Security.

Moreover,\nas the US is a founding member of the majority of the world’s international institutions, China believes it to have\nexceptional control over cyberspace and its governing principles. For example, during the Budapest Conference on\nCyberspace in 2012, the official statement of the Chinese representative included points that criticised the US for\nmilitarising cyberspace and unfairly allocating cyber resources among only developed states to maintain its control.[21]\nThis is why several Chinese experts believe China has a key role in promoting a new, ‘common and inclusive global\ninternet governance’[22] model that redistributes digital resources and governance rights more equitably. Admittedly,\nsuch a model would probably lack legitimacy in the eyes of a large part of the international community.[23] 1.3.\n\n### China vs. the West and the United States\n\nThe different understandings of internet governance can be seen as part of the general existential competition\nbetween China and the West, which often asks whether China will continue growing as the peaceful lion as it claims,\nor whether conflict with the liberal democratic ideologies is bound to occur. As the US undeniably has the greatest\neconomic and military capabilities among the West, it has taken the lead in containing China’s growth. Whereas\nphysical confrontation has so far been avoided, the situation is certainly fiercer in cyberspace, which both the US\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) and the PLA have begun to view as a new domain of conflict, seeing cyber espionage\nand malicious activities from both parties, who refuse to admit their state-level involvement and rather blame their\nopponent.[24] China considers itself equal with the US when it comes to comparing the two countries’ size, power and\ninfluence in the online field, which creates tensions over who should dominate the digital world.[25] Understandably,\nsuch tensions frustrate cooperative interaction not only in the cyber domain, but also in the economic and political\nfields.\n\nAfter the US indicted five PLA officers for stealing data from American corporations in May 2014,[26] many saw the\ncyber-agreement between President Xi and President Obama in September 2015 as a positive development. Both\nPresidents pledged not to knowingly conduct or support cyber theft, including that of intellectual property, trade\nsecrets, or confidential business information in general.[27] Some cyber security firms have indeed noted a reduced\nnumber of attacks against American businesses, but this might be due to improved tactics making the attackers\nharder to detect, or simply a turn to new, uninformed targets in other countries, and not because of any deep respect\nfor the agreement.[28] FireEye’s recent report states that the China-based units’ operations against US companies saw\na decline in frequency a year before the Xi-Obama agreement and have since become more focused and calculated\n\n21 Hurwitz, Roger. ‘A Scene from the Road to Cyber Governance: The Budapest Cyberspace Conference.’ MUNK School of Global\n_Affairs. 26 Feb. 2013.

The outcome was a clear split between nations favouring the introduction of a multilateral\ngovernance model (most of the so-called BRICS countries, with the exception of India, and developing countries) and those\nopposed to it, including the USA, EU member states, Australia and Japan.\n24 Lindsay, Jon.

The report attributes such changes to military and political changes\nwithin China, the frequent exposure of Chinese hackers, as well as the pressure and threat of sanctions from the\nUS.[29] Nevertheless, the overall situation has remained fairly static and therefore the Xi-Obama agreement should\nnot be seen as a turning point.\n\nIt is essential to note that the foundation of such behaviour, as well as Chinese thinking on asymmetric warfare in\ngeneral and particularly on cyber-war, was laid down in Unrestricted Warfare – a book written by two PLA colonels\nQiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui in 1999 to provide a strategy of how China as a weaker country could defeat a\ntechnologically superior foe outside the scope of using hard military power. Part of the American media irresponsibly\ndepicted the book a grand strategy to destroy the US due to its precise scrutiny of the American military. Indeed,\nthe colonels identified the US military’s main weakness as its dependence on ICT-networked systems through which\nthe Chinese could obtain an asymmetric advantage.[30] According to SIPRI’s database, at the time of the book’s\npublication, the difference in the two countries’ military expenditure was about 15-fold. Even though the gap has\nclosed significantly, the US defence budget is still around three times that of China.[31] Therefore, if the front door\nremains closed, the smart player will try to sneak in through the back door or a window. That is exactly what the\nChinese strategy is about – knowing that even with wholesale modernisation, it will not be the equal of the US\nmilitary for decades, and so China is ready to win any confrontation without physical battles by using efficient and\noverwhelming cyber-attacks.[32]\n\nHowever, even though the book has predominantly been characterised as a plan to defeat the US, it really should\nbe perceived as an opportunity to understand China’s different operational thinking on the power struggle in\ngeneral. This is something that needs to be noticed and learned not only by the US, but also by other Western powers\nif they want to be on par with China in the cyber race. Colonels Qiao and Wang noted that it is vital to recognise that\nthe battlefields in future wars will be traditionally non-war spheres like cyberspace, which strongly affect national\nsecurity.[33] 1.4.\n\n### Understanding the Chinese Cyber Definitions\n\nIn looking into Chinese cyber developments, one should also be aware of their dissimilar terminology for cyber as\ncompared to the North-Atlantic area.[34] Efforts have been made to reconcile the mismatches, but these continue to\nbe met by a remarkable lack of enthusiasm. What can be done for the purpose of this research is to explain the most\nsignificant differences.\n\nTo begin with, the Chinese do not use the word cyber as extensively as the West. They perceive everything related\nto cyber developments as part of a broader transformation from an industrial society to an information society,\nreferring to the process as informationisation or informatisation (the latter is normally used in translations and has\n\n29 _Red Line Drawn: China Recalculates Its Use of Cyber Espionage.

It\nis easier to accept the current situation, but a better solution may exist in composing an international cyber lexicon that\naddresses all the relevant terms. This, however, will be a tremendous challenge due to the opposition of China and other\nalternative players like Russia, who find it more appealing to seek cooperation among themselves and other like-minded\ncountries instead of engaging into a constructive dialogue with the US-led English-speaking countries.

The West, including the NATO\nallies, sees cyber security as the security of computer and information systems as physical and logical entities, and\n_information assurance or information security as referring to security of the content. The Chinese, however, view_\nboth the information systems and the content of information as integral and connected parts of **_information_**\n**_security.[39] This holistic understanding thus extends the use of the term from purely ICT-related issues to mental_**\naspects and explains why the Chinese government’s approach to information security has been control-seeking and\nrestrictive. Likewise, the Chinese have adopted **_information warfare_** as a distinct, yet integrated and discrete\ndiscipline, which is incompatible with the Western view, which has recently been dividing the concept into smaller\nand separate disciplines, such as psychological operations and strategic communications. The Chinese use cyber\n_warfare only when describing Western countries and their cyber operations.[40]_\n\nIt would be a major challenge to have each player adopt a single lexicon, but as long as one understands what is\nbehind the varying definitions, it will become easier to evaluate cyber relationships between China and the West. In\nthis paper, unless specifically referring to a Chinese initiative or particular concept, cyber and its derivations should\nbe read in the conventional Western understanding. However, dissimilar terminology is certainly not the hardest of\nthe obstacles on the way to elaborating sophisticated cyber cooperation between China and the West. China’s\nnotion of sovereignty and independence has restrained it from considering Western points of view and international\nlaw’s efficiency in cyberspace. Reluctant to adopt the US-led positions, the Chinese prefer to control cyberspace\nthrough its government and military, as opposed to the West which prefers a liberal environment, giving space to\nindividuals and private corporations. Having analysed China’s previous behaviour and firmly held attitudes, it seems\nunlikely that its stance will see a significant change any time soon. Therefore, instead of fighting the red dragon in\nthe dark and without much success, it might be more useful to get to know her first. However, it is a large and\ncomplicated task due to continuing uncertainties that are not only a problem for the outsiders, but also for the\nChinese themselves. 2.\n\n## Assembling China’s Cyber Strategy and Its Main Goals\n\nIn 1999, colonels Qiao and Wang presented dependence on ICT-networks as the main weakness of the US military.\nToday, the PLA has reached a point where its reliance on information technology is no less than that of the\nAmericans. At the same time, cyber security is also concerned with industrial and civilian developments where public\nand private sector actors’ interests often mismatch, making it difficult to implement a streamlined approach.\nLogically enough, cyber security has become one of the priorities for both the PLA and the Chinese government,\nwhich has taken various steps to address the challenges of legal loopholes, incomplete institutions, and\n\n35 Zhao, Xiaofan. ‘Practice and Strategy of Informatization in China.’ State Council Informatization Office Department of IT\nApplication Promotion.

However, analysing these together allows gaining a rather sharp picture of China’s\noverall position in cyberspace. Even though many of the adopted initiatives have seen only limited success, this\nchapter will shed light on the most important documents together with their main content and goals. It will conclude\nby analysing China’s new strategic direction taken after establishing the Central Leading Small Group for Internet\nSecurity and Informatisation in February 2014. 2.1.\n\n### China’s Civilian Documents on Information Security\n\nPrior to establishing China’s national civilian cyber security plan, referred to as Document 27, several working groups\nhad touched upon related issues. However, lack of coordination and constant restructuring have continuously\ncaused much uncertainty for all the players. A national-level focus on information technology began in 1986 with\nthe establishment of the State Economic Information Management Leading Small Group, and continued in 1999 and\n2001 with the establishment and re-establishment of the State Informatisation Leading Group (SILG). In 2003, the\nState Network and Information Security Coordination Small Group (SNISCSG) was created as a sub-group under SILG,\nchaired by the current Premier Li Keqiang. The objectives for these three groups were to develop indigenous\ninformation technologies and place them into a national security context.[42] China’s tenth Five-Year Plan of 2001\nprioritised developing domestic information security infrastructure and initiating large-scale investments to both\nstate-sponsored and private IT-firms, which were to focus on anti-malware protection and general internet\nsecurity.[43] In the early 2000s, ICT development received attention from both President Jiang Zemin and President\nHu Jintao who started to talk about national security and economic security as an indivisible pair, hence promoting\nthe need to ‘leapfrog’ over the competitors in order to turn China’s historical disadvantages into strengths through\ninnovative development.[44] 2.1.1.\n\nDocument 27: Opinions for Strengthening Information Security Assurance Work (2003)\n\nIn 2003, SNISCSG issued Document 27, which implemented major cyber security related policies and national\nstrategies, including disaster recovery, incident management and e-government security plans.[45] The initially\nclassified Document 27’s persisting idea was the concept of ‘active defence’,[46] drawing various policies for protecting\ncritical infrastructure, enhancing encryptions and dynamic monitoring, improving indigenous innovation, and also\ntouching upon cyber security’s leadership, better coordination and funding. Document 27 was helpful in formulating\nnecessary policies, but the dismissal of SNISCSG in 2008 left China’s civilian cyber security disorganised, leading to\nvarious separate, unaligned policy initiatives from different bodies. Even though SNISCSG was reconstituted in 2009,\nno open records of its meetings are available and various ministries have been assigned the responsibilities to\n\n41 Li, Yuxiao. ‘Cyberspace Security and International Cooperation in China,’ p.4 in Lindsay, 2012.\n42 Wang, Yukai, ‘Zhongyang wangluo anquan yu xinxihua lingdao xiaozu de youlai ji qi yinxiang (The Origins and Influence of the\nCentral Network Security and Informatisation Leading Small Group),’ Zhongguo Gongchandang Xinwen Wang (Communist Party\n_of China News Network), 3 Mar. 2014. <http://theory. people.com.cn/n/2014/0303/c40531-24510897.html>, cited in Chang,_\nAmy.

Issued by the State Council, it is more precisely entitled the\n‘The National Programme for the Development of Science and Technology in the Medium and Long Term 20062020’. Dieter Ernst from the East-West Centre considers this document a cornerstone to China’s overall\nstandardisation strategy, which consists of various legal documents and policy initiatives. He also believes that the\nstrategy should be analysed in a broader context with China’s goal to level up with the Western life quality and\nincome level, not only when talking about technology or cyberspace. In order to achieve that goal, instead of merely\naccepting the current standards, the government wants to become a lead shaper, or at least a co-shaper, of\ninternational standards through innovation.[48] Accordingly, the document lists China’s goals for technological\nindigenous innovation and recognises the need for increased investment in research and development.\n\nOther research[49] suggests that the plan reflects China’s resolve to overcome domestic, social and environmental\nissues through technological innovation, while continuing with the firm understanding that only the government can\ndrive such innovation, guiding enterprises and the business sector which will execute the strategies. Perhaps the\nmost important aspect for the international community is Beijing’s strong determination to loosen ties with foreign\ninnovation firms and set the foundation for a truly independent base of knowledge. Concerns over the possibly of\nan emergent ‘techno-nationalism’ seem therefore justified. The plan calls for China not to obtain any ‘core\ntechnologies in key fields that affect the lifeblood of the national economy and national security’ from abroad,\nincluding next-generation internet technologies, digitally controlled machine tools, and high-resolution earth\nobservation systems.[50]\n\nIn order to deliver this, the government has increased R&D expenditure which will rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2020.\nWhile it is believed that China will have overtaken the US by 2020,[51] estimated figures for China in 2016 remain\naround 2%, or $396.3 billion, while those of the US are 2.77% and $514 billion, still maintaining a significant gap\nbetween the two.[52] Even though China’s figures show an almost two-fold increase from $213.4 in 2010[53], they need\nto be taken with a degree of scepticism, as large part of the budget is spent on developing infrastructure, rather\nthan on scientific research. Nevertheless, Chinese researchers and enterprises do have increasingly more incentives\nand support to develop intellectual property, fulfilling the government’s wish to reduce dependence on foreign\ntechnologies. Despite good intentions, such policies may actually amplify industrial espionage, as many local\nbusinesses lack the required skills and thus acquire the needed technology from abroad and simply modify it as\nnecessary, often illegally.[54] Here, one can find another controversy: a part of the Chinese understanding of\n‘indigenous’ highlights producing original innovations such as new products and services.[55] This seemingly\n\n47 Li, 2012, p. 6.\n48 Ernst, 2010, p. 96.\n49 Swedish Institute for Growth Policy Studies has conducted one of the most comprehensive studies on the 15-year plan and its\nimplications.

Its further aim is to\nprioritise energy, water supply and environmental technologies together, and to recognise that a better position on\nintellectual property rights would also strengthen China’s general competitiveness in the world markets.[56] However,\nTimothy Thomas has brought out the plan’s aspects that could in some ways be associated with enhancing China’s\ncapabilities in the offensive side, considering the strategy a counterpart to the American National Military Strategy\nfor Cyberspace Operations.[57] One interpretation of the strategy’s goal would therefore be the desire to secure the\nhome front before assaulting other countries. Indeed, given the intertwined nature of digital world, civilian\ncyberspace is certainly the most vulnerable target and would suffer the most harm if successfully attacked. By\ncontrast, Dieter Ernst believes that the crux of this plan remains how to execute the key objective of indigenous\ninnovation while becoming more and more integrated into global corporate production networks, often led by\nWestern ideals.[58]\n\nWhile the 15-year strategy has initiated the improvement of China’s innovation system, its success depends on\nreinforcing open markets and international linkages between China’s technology and global standards, while\nexecuting its domestic innovation and thus creating a ‘two-track’ approach.[59] Indeed, China’s technology giants such\nas Huawei and Xiaomi are gradually entering the world markets, but the opposite direction allowing foreign\ntechnology firms to trade in China is still restricted. For example, the extensive ‘Multi-Level Protection Scheme’\nintroduced in 2007 intended to protect national security through prohibiting foreign companies from selling any\ncore products to the government, banking, transportation, and other critical infrastructure companies, and the 2010\n‘Compulsory Certification for Information Security Scheme’ required that foreign companies wishing to sell to the\nChinese government must give their products’ intellectual property rights to the government. A continuation to that\ntrend in February 2015 saw the beginning of a ‘cyber security new regime’ which assumes that all foreign technology\nfirms supplying Chinese banks might be required to share their source code and even include back doors into\nhardware and software.[60] The attention that everything related to cyberspace and information technology is\ncontinuously receiving shows that the Chinese have not given up their ambitions. 2.1.3.\n\nState Council’s Information Office’s New Policy Opinion\n\nIn July 2012, the State Council’s Information Office (SCIO) issued a New Policy Opinion (NPO), translated as ‘The State\n_Council vigorously promotes informatisation development and offers several opinions on conscientiously protecting_\n_information security’.[61]_ Even though released nearly a decade after Document 27 and more than half a decade after\nthe 15-year strategy, its overall concerns remain the same, showing that not all goals have been met. It persistently\nnotes China’s exposure to urgent challenges in international competition over the control, use and acquisition of\ninformation. More precisely, the disparity between the West and China in digital infrastructure, inefficient exchange\nof information between government and industry, poor cyber security planning, inadequate defence capabilities,\nand a continuously large share of control over core technologies by foreigners attract the most attention.

This shows an expansion from ‘safeguarding national security information’ to ‘promoting stable and\nrapid economic development and social harmony and stability’. [63]\n\nGiles and Hagestad have distilled the NPO’s four policy mandates, which like the previously analysed documents\nfocus on civil cyber defence:\n\n  - Firstly, the NPO places strong emphasis on the security of all critical information systems and infrastructure,\nespecially focusing on information networks. This can be interpreted as an order, rather than guidance, on\nwhat the policymakers must protect – the internet, radio networks and private telecommunications\nsystems, as well as information networks related to finance, energy and transportation. Its clear goal is to\nsecure those industries where a cyber attack would cause tremendous harm to China’s economy.[64]\n\n  - Secondly, the NPO seeks to strengthen the governmental and classified information security systems, which\nare often attractive targets for hacktivists like Anonymous. For execution, the State Council expects the\ngovernment agencies to reduce their internet connectedness and enhance information security and\nconfidentiality protection monitoring by establishing a hierarchical system to protect classified information\nsystems.[65]\n\n  - Thirdly, the NPO seeks to increase protection of industrial control systems of facilities such as oil and gas\npipelines, nuclear and power infrastructures, as well as transportation and urban facilities, all invoking the\nmemory of Stuxnet. This should be achieved through strengthening regulations and conducting more\nfrequent security checks and risk assessments.[66]\n\n  - Finally, the NPO turns to safeguarding Chinese citizens’ personal information, noting its significance in\nachieving the general welfare of the country and thus promising protection of demographic, geographical\nor similarly sensitive data.[67] This step can be considered a countermove to an attack in 2012 which\ncompromised millions of users’ data on an opinion forum, Tianya, and a retail site, 360buy.com.[68]\n\nThe NPO is certainly a very comprehensive document, which covers the majority of essential areas of cyber security.\nThe State Council’s recommendations indicate the main weaknesses of China’s information security model, and\npoint out the increased vulnerabilities from growing dependence on the internet. Continuing hostility towards\nforeign technologies also suggests that related trade barriers will not be abolished in the near future. However, as\nan intriguing point in light of President Xi’s anti-corruption campaign, the NPO does not seem to address corruption,\nwhich is widespread within the technology industry. As the crackdown has not proven fully successful, the\ngovernment could think of rewarding legitimate officials and entrepreneurs to prevent dishonest players from\ncompromising the industry’s development. Overall, the NPO indicates that information security had, by 2012,\nalready become one of the government’s priorities. 2.2.\n\n### Formulating a New National Information Security Strategy\n\nThe analysis of these documents indicates that China’s main information security concerns have remained rather\nsimilar throughout the years. Guided by these principles, 2014 was finally considered a year of breakthrough towards\na better regulated cyberspace. The establishment of the Central Leading Small Group for Internet Security and\nInformatisation on 27 February 2014 shows President Xi’s personal commitment, as he is the first party head to chair\n\n63 Xue Ruihan, ‘Jianli jianqian guojia wangluo he xinxi anquan chang xiao jizhi (Establish and improve the national network and\ninformation security long-term mechanisms),’ Renmin Wang (People’s Daily Online), 17 Apr. 2014,\n<http://leaders.people.com.cn/n/2014/0417/c347621- 24909496.html>, cited in Chang, 2014, p. 17.\n64 Gu, Fa, ‘State Council vigorously promotes the development of information technology and to effectively protect the\ninformation security.’ 2012, cited in Giles and Hagestad, 2013, p. 12.\n65 Ibid, p. 13.\n66 Ibid.\n67 Ibid.\n68 Zhu, Yishi. ‘Hackers Find Holes Behind the Great Firewall.’ Hackers Find Holes Behind the Great Firewall. 21 Jan. 2012.\nAccessed 22 Aug. 2016. <http://english.caixin.com/2012-01-21/100350690.html>.\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\na leading small group related to information management.[69] When explaining the necessity of the new body, Xi has\npointed out China’s need to catch up with the West in innovation, and further developed his argument that ‘no\ninternet safety means no national security and no informatisation means no modernization’.[70] The leading group\ngives unprecedented priority to both internet security and information management as a single concept, trying to\nfight the lack of a coordinated approach that has caused problems in the past. President Xi has referred to internet\nsecurity and information management as ‘two wings of one bird, two wheels on one car’.[71] With Xi as its head, the\nnew group should be able to make firm demands and solve internal discrepancies where necessary.\n\nAs part of the new initiative, November 2014 saw the first World Internet Conference, hosted in Wuzhen, China.\nWith the presence of representatives from various big names like Apple and Microsoft, President Xi affirmed that\nunder the terms of mutual respect and trust, China was willing to cooperate with other states to achieve a peaceful\ncyberspace and a multilaterally governed, transparent internet, while sticking to the notion that state sovereignty\nmust be fully respected in cyberspace.[72] At the second Conference a year later, President Xi delivered a keynote\nspeech in which he called for ‘building a cyber community of common destiny and put forward the principles of\nrespecting cyber sovereignty, safeguarding cyber security, encouraging cyber opening up, and building cyber\norder’.[73] As part of his ideas, Xi proposed building an internet governance system based on a multilateral approach,\nand denounced unilateralism in which only a few parties discuss the future of the internet.[74] His other proposals\nconcerned the digital gap, cultural diversity in cyberspace, the digital economy, and cyber security in general,\nindicating the core elements of China’s cyber strategy. While this call might be a chance for deeper cooperation with\nChina, it also impliedly depicts China’s dissatisfaction with the current system and the desire to guide the existing\nstructure and governance of cyberspace and technological development closer to their way of thinking.[75] Indeed, in\nthe National Meeting on Cyber Security and Information Technology held in April 2016, President Xi once again\nreaffirmed the importance of cyber sovereignty, implying a rejection of the applicability of international law and\nexisting regulations in cyberspace.[76]\n\nOverall, despite the lack of one single strategy clearly listing China’s future plans and ambitions, the different pieces\nof information allow a number of conclusions. The existing and newly created mechanisms must improve the\nsecurity of the domestic internet infrastructure, reinforce the move towards indigenous innovation detailed in the\n15-year plan, and, most importantly, help China become the leading actor on the global stage by promoting an\nalternative attitude to internet governance. The Chinese government understands the value and power of\ntechnology, innovation, and the internet, but remains extremely careful in operating the ‘double-edged sword’,\nbeing aware that free information, once released, is impossible to stop and has great potential to shake the\nfoundation of the communist party and the political order of China. Last year, for example, the government set up\na doctrine of Seven Baselines for using the internet, requiring that whatever is expressed online, must respect seven\nelements: laws and regulations, the socialist system, the country’s national interest, citizens’ lawful rights and\n\n69 Rountree, Florence. ‘Information management and internet regulation in China.’ China's Expanding Cyberspace (2014): pp.\n11-13. <http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ChinaAnalysisEng_June2014.pdf>.\n70 Zhu, Ningzhu. ‘Xi Jinping Leads Internet Security Group.’ Xinhuanet. 27 Feb. 2014.

A mixture of government\ninstitutions and military departments, together with uncoordinated action between central and local authorities,\nhas created a strong incentive for establishing a more streamlined and synchronised approach. To give a clear\noverview of the exact institutions in play, this chapter will introduce the past and recently launched initiatives that\nshape China’s cyber governance, including Xi Jinping’s Central Leading Small Group for Internet Security and\nInformatisation. The chapter will examine both civilian and military organs, and will first cover how the general\nresponsibility of cyber security is organised and coordinated by looking at the bodies responsible for the decisions\nand execution.\n\nThe military part of the chapter first introduces the military’s strategic thought and then focuses on the role of the\nPeople’s Liberation Army and its cyber espionage and intelligence units, which have previously acted mainly under\nthe 3[rd] and 4[th] Departments of the General Staff Department, but are expected to see a restructuring under the\nnewly created Strategic Support Force. This section also includes an analysis of the patriotic hacktivist groups which,\ndespite their usefulness to the government, may seriously hamper China’s overall development and foreign\nrelations. 3.1.\n\n### Civilian Government Agencies\n\nAs Amy Chang has noted, the key driver for formulating China’s cyber security strategy remains maintaining the\ncommunist party’s ruling power.[78] Therefore, as with any other subject, the party ultimately commands all the\nmechanisms regulating China’s cyberspace. So far, it has not been able to effectively reduce the large number of\nstakeholders with competing interests. However, like the noticeable trend in several other countries like Israel and\nthe US, China’s recent steps have allowed it to move towards a more streamlined unified command line for cyber.\n\nThe highest-level decision-makers in China are the Politburo Standing Committee, the State Council, and the Central\n**Military Commission. For policy-making, it is the State Council that usually adopts new initiatives, including those in**\ncyberspace, such as the 15-Year Plan in 2006 and the New Policy Opinion in 2012, but there are several government\nagencies charged with the execution of policy. In 1982, when China was not even connected to the internet, the\nState Council set up a government body for digital affairs, seeking to centralise control over the developing\n\n\n## China’s Strategic Cyber Governance\n\n\n### Civilian Government Agencies\n\n\n‘computers and large-scale integrated circuits’.\n\n\n79 Groups with similar structures and roles remain the key\n\n\norganisations today, but before turning to explaining their current functions, ministerial-level agencies which mostly\n\nperform general policy implementation will be introduced:\n\n  - The **Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) was established in 2008 as an attempt to**\ncentralise information technology development. It undertakes all State Council work on information\nmanagement and carries similar domestic responsibilities to the Department of Homeland Security in the\nUS. It also sets standards, holds exercises, inspects network security, and coordinates information and\ntelecoms security through a special department.[80] Whereas the primary duty to respond to cyber-attacks\nrests with the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Centre of\n**China (CNCERT) – a non-governmental technical centre established in 2002, MIIT has been influential in**\n\n77 Creemers, 2015, p. 10.\n78 Chang, 2014, p. 32.\n79 Wang, 2014, cited in Rountree, 2014, p.11.\n80 _The Cyber Index: International Security Trends and Realities.

Importantly, MPS operates the Great Firewall of China and is also involved\nwith conducting domestic intelligence.[84]\n\n  - The **Ministry of State Security (MSS) functions as an organ to conduct counterespionage,**\ncounterintelligence, foreign intelligence, and domestic intelligence. Its efforts originally focused on\ncountering separatism, terrorism and religious extremism, which are often described as the three\nexistential challenges to the Communist Party. However, despite having attracted little public attention,\nMSS’s estimated cyber capabilities have grown significantly in order to collect further political and economic\ndata on foreign governments, NGOs and domestic dissidents.[85]\n\nOther than these institutions, various sources have also highlighted the importance of the State Encryption Bureau,\nwhich conducts party, civilian and military encryption management, including restricting the import and export of\nany encrypted devices; and the **State Secrets Bureau, which manages all classified networks and has been**\nincreasingly engaged in keeping up with the technological changes China is witnessing.[86] As all of the three ministries\nand the two bureaus operate under the State Council, they are seemingly equal in hierarchy. However, looking at\npast actions and attention, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology seems to be the main force behind\nexecuting the tangible progress of China’s cyberspace.\n\nOn the research and development side, further attention has been paid to a number of government affiliated\nresearch institutions, such as the **Chinese Institute of Contemporary International Relations, which acts directly**\nunder MSS, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Not surprisingly, Tsinghua\nUniversity and Peking University, the top two academic institutions in China, are closely related to the government’s\ninformation technology related research work. Deeper strategic development is run by the PLA through institutions\nsuch as the **Academy of Military Science and the** **PLA Information Engineering University. March 2016 saw the**\nlaunch of the **Cyber Security Association of China, consisting of academic institutes, individuals and internet**\ncompanies such as Tencent, to speed up the development of industry standards and better coordinate research on\ncyber security.[87]\n\n81 Fu, Jingguang. ‘Policies and Practices on Network Security of MIIT.’ Workshop on Cybersecurity Policy Development in the\nAPEC Region.

Complying directly with the orders of the party’s\nhighest leaders, these are perhaps the most efficient mechanisms to the adoption of successful reforms. Whereas\nthe **State Informatisation Leading Group (SILG) and the** **State Network and Information Security Coordination**\n**Small Group (SNISCSG) – the first efforts to develop China’s indigenous information technologies and formulate a**\nsecure Chinese cyberspace – were guided by the State Council, the recently established Central Leading Small Group\n**for Internet Security and Informatisation (CLSGISI) acts directly under the direction of President Xi, and has thereby**\nassumed unprecedented authority. The leading group reportedly consists of 22 members: next to Xi Jinping, the\nPremier Li Keqiang and a Standing Committee member Liu Yunshan act as vice-chairs, to lead eight other Politburo\nmembers and eleven ministerial-level officials. As it is common in China for a new body to take over the duties of a\npreviously existing organ, this group has subsumed the roles of the SILG and SNISCSG, by merging most of the\nmembers from the previous two bodies.[88] Next to the obvious significance of the group deriving from its high\nleadership which shows cyber security’s weight in Chinese policy-making, the group is hoped to act as a middleman\nresolving internal misunderstandings between the ministerial-level institutions described above.\n\nMore than two years after its establishment, the CLSGISI itself has not been much discussed in the English-speaking\nmedia, but the executive body implementing President Xi’s reforms – the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC)\n– has caught its attention rather often. The CAC is basically a refreshment of the State Internet Information Office\n**(SIIO) as its Chinese name and chairman Lu Wei remained the same, although Lu unexpectedly stepped down in**\nJune 2016 to be replaced by Xu Lin. SIIO was founded in 2011 to better coordinate the ‘rectification’ of the internet,\nworking in close cooperation with MIIT and MPS to patrol social media, where user-created content generates a\nserious nuisance to the government. Establishing SIIO was a specific step by the State Council Information Office\n(SCIO), which manages the general domestic information flow.[89] Seemingly tied with Xi’s power consolidation and\ncountering domestic disobedience, CAC’s predominant function remains the same as that of SIIO – to monitor\ninformation movement and further strengthen the grip on websites allegedly undermining domestic stability.\n\nThe creation of CAC also represents an attempt to combine propaganda with technological innovation and\ndevelopment.[90] For example, CAC has published a choral anthem, which includes verses such as ‘with loyalty and\ndevotion, we watch over our domain day and night.’[91] Affirming the significance of the future of China’s cyberspace,\n_Time Magazine included Lu Wei among the 100 most influential people in 2015, emphasising his (former) power to_\npilot more than 700 million Chinese netizens.[92] CAC has so far executed its power by blocking foreign VPNs, closing\nand monitoring WeChat (the most popular messaging application in China) accounts of individuals perceived as\nthreatening, and possibly coordinating cyber-attacks against anti-censorship groups such as GreatFire.org, an\norganisation seeking to bring transparency to the Great Firewall by providing information on any blocked websites\nand keywords.[93] The beginning of 2016 saw a proposal for a new cyber security law that would include provisions\ntheoretically banning local service providers from enabling connections to sites with domain names registered\n\n88 Creemers, Rogier. ‘Cybersecurity and Informatization Leading Group: Names and Documents.’ China Copyright and Media. 13\nMar. 2014.

MIIT has, however, said that the core of the new regulations has been misunderstood, and they would not\naffect foreign companies launching services in China or users accessing such websites.[94] Despite the fact that the\nsecond reading of the draft regulations in June 2016 saw certain amendments, the existing draft further reaffirms\nthe state’s strict approach to controlling cyberspace and is soon expected to become adopted as law.[95]\n\nEach of these mentioned bodies has been trusted with specific tasks. While academia and specific institutions\nconduct research and strategic development work, it is the ministerial-level organisations which come up with policy\ninitiatives and direct the required changes. Establishing the Central Leading Small Group for Internet Security and\nInformatisation and the CAC as its executive body represents an additional step from the previously existing\nbureaucracy, as their authoritative leadership guarantees a better coordinated action between the ministries and\nbureaus. In terms of policy-making efficiency, it is a positive step towards a less fragmented system, but it also\nconstitutes a part of President Xi’s campaign to restrict anti-party and liberal movements through the opportunities\nthe internet creates, which is demonstrated by the CAC’s predominantly restricting activities. _3.3._\n\n### Military’s Cyber Activities\n\nThe following sections will look more closely at China’s cyber security from the military’s strategic and organisational\nperspective, which is intertwined with the goals and activities of the civilian agencies thus far discussed. While the\nmilitaries of the US and Russia have each published official documents on activities in cyberspace, the PLA has not\nissued any specific doctrine. However, the concept of information has always been extremely important in China’s\nmilitary strategies, and the contemporary emphasis on gathering information and intelligence is entirely in line with\nancient Chinese strategists such as Sun Zi. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of the guiding principles of the PLA’s\nconducts before engaging in analysing the specific activities of its cyber units. 3.3.1.\n\nThe Chinese Military’s Strategic Thinking on Cyber\n\nThe concept of information plays a central role in Chinese military thinking. As cyberspace is strongly related to\ninformation, one can find relevant content within general military documents which explain the PLA’s ambitions in\ncyberspace. For example, the Military Strategic Guidelines, normally renewed every 10-15-years, lead defence and\nmilitary policies strongly towards modernisation, while recognising the importance of the ability to fight in ‘technical\nconditions’ and implying the significance of information technology in overall strategies.[96] Furthermore, the recently\nupdated _Science of Military Strategy, a book_ issued by the Academy of Military Sciences, the most important\nresearch institution of the PLA, puts even stronger emphasis on conflict in the network domain and elaborates on\ndevelopments of high-tech local war, giving guidelines on how to behave in such circumstances.[97] In fact, its chapter\non information warfare openly declares that China does have specialised network warfare units, operating within\nboth the military and the civilian spheres, and carrying out both offensive and defensive cyber operations.[98]\n\nAnother initiative was launched in October 2014 when President Xi and the Central Military Commission issued a\ndocument entitled _Opinion on Further Strengthening Military Information Security Work, which listed the basic_\nprinciples and priorities for the PLA, but also provided directives for the military in the information security field.[99]\n\n94 Chin, Josh. ‘China Says New Internet Regulations Won't Increase Blocking of Foreign Websites.’ The Wall Street Journal. 30\nMar. 2016.

Looking at the available documents,\nit seems that China is moving towards a common approach that incorporates cyber war with a kinetic attack.[102] This\nalso corresponds with the Chinese strategists’ hypothesis that informatisation creates a new battlefield which the\nPLA must master.[103] However, there are also pragmatic economic and political objectives behind the military’s cyber\nactivities, mainly short and long-term gains from espionage against other governments and the private sector. Next\nto collecting valuable information from abroad, perhaps even more essential is the surveillance conducted against\nthe Chinese citizens in order to maintain control and political stability within the communist system. The main\ntargets normally include political dissidents and democracy activists, but also Tibetans, Uighurs and Falun Gong\nfollowers to examine their networks and communication methods.[104] While these activities are not conducted only\nthrough military mechanisms, the paper will later show that the PLA’s role is certainly vital in sustaining such\noperations.\n\nInterestingly, China has always emphasised its defensive nature in every aspect of warfare, including information\nsecurity. The 2013 Defence White Paper proclaimed China’s right to protect its interests of national security and\ndelivered a promise not to attack unless attacked first, including in cyberspace.[105] Whereas several Western\ncountries have communicated a similar position, the Chinese attitude relies on Mao Zedong’s ‘active defence’ as\nalready emphasised in Document 27 in 2003, assuming to attack only after being attacked.[106] Yet, Mao’s ‘active\ndefence’ can also be interpreted as the alternative use of defensive and offensive. This, together with different\nstrategic cultures, creates a situation where an act considered defensive by the Chinese might seem offensive to the\nWest.[107] As an interesting parallel, ‘active cyber defence’ is widely discussed in the West, referring to the ability to\ndetect and mitigate key threats before suffering from any damage, including the capacity to launch aggressive and\noffensive countermeasures.[108] Thus, Western actions taken under the concept of ‘active cyber defence’ might\nsimilarly seem offensive to the Chinese. Connecting the Chinese and the Western understandings of active defence,\nit seems that each has understood that in cyberspace, mere defensive capabilities are not enough to deter\nadversaries from attacking one’s networks. As the Chinese have recently admitted the existence of purely offensive\ncyber units in the PLA, it is increasingly clear that conflict in cyberspace has achieved fundamental importance in the\nChinese understandings of policy making, both in peacetime, and in any future war.[109]\n\nSecurity Work’),’ Jiefangjun bao (PLA Daily), 7 Oct. 2014. <http://news.xinhuanet.com/mil/2014- 10/07/c_1112726181.htm>,\ncited in Chang, 2014, p. 19.\n100 ‘Document: China's Military Strategy.’ US Naval Institute News. 26 May 2015.

The plan was intensified after the Gulf\nWar in 1991, when the PLA was stunned by the sophistication of US weaponry.[110] Relying on this imperative, the\nChinese military has implemented numerous reforms and modernisation plans, the latest and most comprehensive\nof them approved in December 2015 to adjust to the 21[st] century’s cyber era and exploit its opportunities. Parts of\nthe Chinese military have become useful tools for the government to conduct political and economic cyber\nespionage, and also to help reduce the PLA’s own technological and strategic disadvantages relative to its\ncompetitors.\n\nPrior to the largest restructuring within the PLA’s modernisation drive, the General Staff Department’s\nCommunications Department was restructured into the **Informatisation Department, together with establishing**\nseveral smaller information-related departments in the PLA regions and academia to raise the level of\ninformatisation in the PLA.[111] However, it seems that these developments should not receive too much attention in\nlight of the reforms President Xi announced on the last day of 2015. Three new organs were introduced: the PLA\nRocket Force, the PLA Strategic Support Force, and the Army Leadership Organ. Importantly, the Rocket Force\nassumed the responsibilities of the PLA Second Artillery Force and earned promotion to a status equal to the PLA\nArmy, Navy and Air Force. By today, it appears that the Strategic Support Force **(SSF) has also been given a status**\nequal to these professional service branches, and will likely formulate the core of China’s information warfare effort\nby comprising forces in the space, cyber and electromagnetic domains, thus finally bringing China’s military-related\ninformatisation activities under one umbrella.[112]\n\nHowever, the reforms are currently being implemented and the date of actual completion remains unknown.[113] So\nfar, two (former) executive bodies of the PLA’s General Staff Department (GSD): the 3[rd] and the 4[th] Departments,\nhave been trusted with cyber intelligence and cyber-warfare respectively. Even though both departments will most\nlikely become integrated under the SSF, their successors’ corresponding goals and practices are expected to remain\nsimilar, and therefore, it is appropriate to introduce these institutions in more detail. 3.3.3.\n\nGeneral Staff Department’s 3rd Department\n\nBefore giving full attention to the 3[rd] Department **(3/PLA), sometimes also referred to as the Technical Department,**\nit is necessary to recall that the MSS carries similar intelligence responsibilities in the civilian side. Also, the General\nStaff Department’s 2[nd] Department (2/PLA) is considered the conventional intelligence gathering agency and is\ninvolved with collecting and analysing mainly open-source information through its global network of defence\nattachés. Whereas it is not regularly engaged with covert operations, its non-official cover officers are believed to\nhave had significant success in collecting valuable data about US and other Western weapon systems. [114]\nNevertheless, neither MSS nor 2/PLA have played as significant role in cyber intelligence as 3/PLA.\n\nAccording to Nigel Inkster, 3/PLA has so far been the main operational force of the PLA’s cyber activities, as almost\nall operations that have been tracked originate from its official premises.[115] Appearing to be a counterpart to the\nNational Security Agency in the US, 3/PLA’s main focus has been on collecting signals intelligence (SIGINT). Before\nthe internet’s surge, it operated as a conventional SIGINT agency, but did not possess known overseas collection\n\n110 Inkster, Nigel. ‘Chinese Intelligence in the Cyber Age.’ Survival: Global Politics and Strategy Vol 55(1) (2013): 45-66, p. 50.\n<https://www.iiss.org/en/publications/survival/sections/2013-94b0/survival--global-politics-and-strategy-february-march2013-3db7/55-1-05-inkster-936c>.\n111 Thomas, Timothy L.

At the same time, it has managed to remain rather\nmysterious about its interactions with other domestic intelligence units, including the MSS, leaving open the\nquestion of how efficient the coordination and information sharing among the domestic bodies is. Nevertheless,\nlooking at 3/PLA’s wide-ranging structure, traditional competence in SIGINT, its high performance in computing and\ncryptology, and its status as China’s largest employer of professional linguists, one may assume its respective\nimportance, or even a central role among other institutions.[117] However, with the announced creation of the SSF, it\nis likely that China’s strategic intelligence and informatisation units will be merged into one central intelligence\nstructure, leaving open the question of in what form 3/PLA will continue, if at all.\n\n3/PLA’s headquarters is in Beijing, where it runs political and logistics departments together with the Science and\nTechnology Intelligence Bureau and the Science and Technology Equipment Bureau, which commands three\nresearch institutes responsible for computing, sensor technology and cryptography, respectively named the 56[th],\n57[th] and 58[th] Research Institutes. In addition, 3/PLA manages or is affiliated with several Computer Network Defencerelated institutions such as the National Research Centre for Information Security Technology, the Information\nSecurity Research Institute, and the PLA Communications Security Bureau.[118] Next to these bodies, it is the 12\noperational bureaus that play the most important role in 3/PLA’s structure. Each of the bureaus usually carries out\na specific task, for example intercepting radio or satellite communications, conducting cryptology, translation, or\nintelligence analysis on diplomatic communications, foreign militaries, economic entities, educational institutions,\nand individuals considered worthy of surveillance.[119]\n\nThe 2[nd] and 12[th] Bureaus deserve further attention.[120] First, the Shanghai headquartered 2[nd] Bureau, also known as\nUnit 61398 by its Military Unit Cover Designator, seems to specifically target the US and Canada to obtain political,\neconomic, and military intelligence. It was exposed in February 2013, when Mandiant published an unprecedentedly\nthorough report on a unit they named APT-1, which has achieved public attention through its very similar missions,\ncapabilities, resources and location to the 2[nd] Bureau. After having observed APT-1’s long-term and extensive cyber\nespionage operations for several years, Mandiant concluded that APT-1 is most likely government-funded and one\nof the most prolific and dangerous of China’s cyber actors.[121] According to the size of its physical infrastructure, APT1 is staffed by at least hundreds, if not thousands of people, all required to be competent in computer network\noperations and English.[122] Indeed, as Mandiant notes, 87% of APT-1’s victims are in English-speaking countries and\nbelong to industries that China has said to carry strategic importance to national growth. With the apparent help of\nrecruited linguists, malware authors and industry experts, APT-1 had by the time of the report’s publication obtained\nhundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organisations over 20 industries.[123]\n\n116 Inkster, 2013, p. 49.\n117 Stokes, Mark A., Jenny Lin, and Russell Hsiao.

Namely,\nthe 12[th] Bureau, or Unit 61486, also headquartered in Shanghai is believed to support China’s space surveillance\nnetwork and tasked to intercept satellite communications and collect space-based SIGINT.[124] According to the\nCrowdStrike report, the group, also called Putter Panda, has been active since 2007, allegedly targeting the\naerospace industries in both Europe and the US through attacks on the government, defence, research and\ntechnology sectors. The group’s methodology relies on deploying malware through targeted emails in the form of\nspear phishing.[125] The uncovering of the 12[th] Bureau shows that China can use cyber espionage on two strategic\nlevels: illegally obtained intellectual property allows it to speed up its own space-related developments, but also\nenables exploitation of an opponent’s satellite weaknesses during a real conflict.[126]\n\nEvidently, collecting foreign intelligence through cyber espionage has been fully institutionalised and prioritised for\n3/PLA. However, 3/PLA’s operations are often in parallel with those of the Military Region Technical Reconnaissance\nBureaus (TRB), which operate under seven military regions and are independent of 3/PLA. Like 3/PLA, the TRBs’\nresponsibilities include computer network exploitation, but also cryptology and communications intelligence.[127]\nNext to the military region TRBs, the PLA runs Service TRBs which intercept communications in areas related to their\ninterests, such as the air force or the navy.[128] 3.3.4.\n\nGeneral Staff Department’s 4th Department\n\nEven though the 4[th] Department (4/PLA) has received less attention than 3/PLA, it (or its respective future successor\nunder the SSF) is expected to fall under greater scrutiny due to the revelation of the existing network attack forces\nin the 2015 edition of _The Science of Military Strategy.[129] Formerly known as the Electronic Countermeasures_\nDepartment, 4/PLA is the institution one should become familiar with when seeking to prepare for the increasingly\nhyped danger of cyber war. Hierarchically the equal of 3/PLA, 4/PLA was traditionally responsible for electronic\nwarfare, but has recently also assumed the task of carrying out computer network attacks (CNA)[130] as a result of the\nPLA’s adoption of an offensive information warfare doctrine, the Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW),\nwhich is an ‘organic combination of electronic warfare and computer network warfare’, as explained by General Dai\nQingmin, former Commander of 4/PLA.[131] Therefore, unlike 3/PLA, this department’s mission is offensive, rather\nthan defensive electronic warfare or pure intelligence collection and analysis.[132] The simplest offensive activities\ncould be denial-of-service attacks to disrupt services or the use of worms or Trojan Horses to obtain sensitive data.\n4/PLA can also engage in collecting electronic intelligence and providing tactical electronic support measures.[133]\nFurthermore, it manages electronic countermeasures (ECM) units, which have obtained increasing coverage in the\nPLA media due to the increasing interconnection between information and electronic-based missions and\n\n124 Stokes et al., 2011, p. 11.\n125 See more at CrowdStrike Intelligence Report: Putter Panda.

Apparently, the most notable of these is the 54[th] Research Institute, which provides engineering support and\nfacilitates the department’s connection with other entities under the China Electronic Technology Corporation. For\ntraining junior officers, 4/PLA runs the PLA Electronic Engineering Academy located in Hefei as the primary academic\nelectronic warfare centre in China.[135] Interestingly, and again deriving from the Chinese historic understanding of\ninformation as the key to victory, several of the research institutes under 4/PLA have focused on how to counter key\nAmerican C4ISR systems. Some of the methods include, for example GPS jamming, Joint Tactical Information\nDistribution System countermeasures, and synthetic radar jamming. Such electronic warfare capabilities would be\ncoordinated with CNA tools to conduct a complete attack against the enemy’s key command and networks.[136]\n\nRegarding the interaction between the 3/PLA and 4/PLA, it is likely that some of their duties, such as R&D,\nintelligence collection, or managing a joint network warfare training system overlap.[137] However, the offensive\nnature of 4/PLA’s operations distinguishes it from 3/PLA and has thereby made it a centre of discussion on cyber\nwarfare. Yet, 3/PLA has undeniably been more attractive to foreign researchers due to its enduring cyber espionage\nactivities, which are currently more tangible than actual cyber war. What might indicate the next possible targets of\nthe PLA cyber units is China’s thirteenth five-year plan introduced in October 2015, which outlines the industries in\nwhich China aims to achieve the most growth. Therefore, other than the defence sector, developers of clean energy,\nelectric cars, computer chips as well as healthcare should implement greater security in their online operations.[138]\n\nHowever, it is important to bear in mind that the overall ‘Chinese cyber threat’ is often exemplified and not placed\ninto proper context, especially by the Americans. While not justifying China’s actions, Greg Austin, a well-regarded\nChina expert, draws attention to factors such as commercial lobbying and attention seeking by American cyber\nsecurity firms, a media environment too receptive to cyberspace intrigues and anti-China rhetoric, and the general\nlack of knowledge even among the highest decision-makers on the details and conduct of the US’s own cyber\nespionage and operations against China.[139] 3.3.5.\n\nThe Newcomer: PLA Strategic Support Force\n\nThe establishment of the Strategic Support Force **(SSF) was somewhat unexpected for foreign observers, but it is**\nactually a logical step within the general modernisation of the PLA. For example, the launch of the PLA’s Cyberspace\n**Strategic Intelligence Research Centre in June 2014** to ‘provide strong support in obtaining high-quality intelligence\nresearch findings and help China gain advantage in national information security’ already led observers to conclude\nthat the PLA’s focus was increasingly falling on cyberspace.[140] Indeed, as it seems that information warfare has\nbecome central to China’s ‘active defence’ strategic concept, the SSF will likely become the main force behind its\nexecution, acting as a culmination of years of technological advancement and institutional change.[141] Moreover, as\nthe SSF will assume control over the PLA’s space and cyber operations, it will cover two aspects of China’s new\n\n134 Easton, Ian, and Mark A.

For example, a former officer Song Zhongping stated that the SFF will be\ncomposed of three separate forces: space troops (recognition and navigation satellites), cyber troops (offensive and\ndefensive hacking), and electronic warfare forces (jamming and disrupting radars and communications). [143]\nAdditionally, Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo of the PLA Navy and who is believed to have direct links to the SSF’s creation\nsaid in January 2016 that its main task will be ensuring the military’s local advantages in aerospace, space, cyber,\nand electromagnetic battlefields through operations such as target tracking and reconnaissance, satellite navigation,\nand attack and defence in cyber and electromagnetic spaces – the underlying goal of which should be attaining\nvictory in future wars. Yin also believes the SSF will assume responsibilities in defending the civilian infrastructure to\nincrease the security of China’s financial institutions as well as people’s daily lives in general.[144] Indeed, greater\nassimilation with the civilian sector seems essential in executing China’s cyber ambitions given the rapidly growing\ndependence on information technology as well as the potentially dangerous aspect of informatisation to the current\nregime.\n\nIt thus appears that the SSF will be responsible for every aspect of information warfare, including intelligence,\ntechnical reconnaissance, cyber warfare, and electronic warfare, which are central to China’s strategic thinking on\nasymmetric warfare and pre-emptive attack. In a larger picture, this and other ongoing military reforms aim to\nstreamline the military activities into a ‘combined wartime and peacetime military footing’, which should give the\ncountry an advantageous position should a war break out against a technologically advanced opponent, such as the\nUS.[145] Overall, this desired dominance in the information space forms an essential part of China’s strategic thinking,\nwhich sees paralysing and sabotaging the enemy’s operational and command systems as a key to achieving\ndominance in all other domains, air, sea, and land.[146]\n\nInevitably, the creation of the SSF and other radical changes in the structure of the PLA have brought about a\nreshuffling difficult to follow. Announced in February 2016, the previous seven military area commands were\nregrouped into five geographical theatre commands. This also meant a reorganisation of the General Staff\nDepartment, under which 3/PLA and 4/PLA have so far operated, into the Joint General Staff Department, which will\nnot have operational control of the army unlike its predecessor.[147] Regarding the SSF, it will most likely draw forces\nfrom both 3/PLA and 4/PLA, as well as 1/PLA (operations), 2/PLA (intelligence), and the Informatisation Department,\nwhich is expected to move under the SSF entirely. This means a significant increase in efficiency when it comes to\nChina’s cyber-related operations, as computer network attack and defence, technical reconnaissance, espionage,\nelectronic countermeasures, intelligence, as well as majority of communications and information management will\nall be operating under one command.[148]\n\nOverall, the creation of the SSF is a landmark development, giving a clear indication of the PLA’s focus on\ninformationised warfare, which raises questions of whether these actions should be seen as provocative\n\n142 Costello, John. ‘China Finally Centralizes Its Space, Cyber, Information Forces.’ The Diplomat. 20 Jan. 2016.

The developments must also be seen in political context, as it shifts\ncontrol over China’s most powerful and strategically important weapons from the army to the Central Military\nCommission, headed by President Xi.[149] 3.4.\n\n### Hacktivist Units andCyber Militia\n\nOther than the PLA cyber units, various other groups operate from the Chinese cyberspace. Research by Jeffrey\nKwong in 2012 suggested that most of the openly confirmed attacks actually originated from such independent\nhacktivist units. Even though the assertion was made more than four years ago, it should not be disregarded as it\nrelies on data from 1990 to 2012 and thus enables the assertion of an interesting theory: whenever the Chinese lack\ninfluence over foreign threats, attacks by independent units increase China’s credibility in the opponent’s eyes.\nKwong brings out clear evidence that the government’s threats against another country are directly followed by\nwidespread cyber-attacks to increase domestic and international credibility. Since the groups are uncontrolled and\nmore nationalistic than the state, they create a risk of domestic unrest if the government should decide to retreat\nfrom its demands. Therefore, the Chinese government faces a double threat from cyber-attacks: adopting too mild\napproach against the opponent could invite the attacker groups to turn against China to express displeasure; while\nletting the groups go completely untamed creates a risk of falling into a bilateral conflict with another state.[150]\n\nAn example of such a group is the Red Hacker Alliance. The group has not been widely covered in the media, but it\nis believed to have a membership of several hundred thousand. It has been noted that the government tolerates\nand most likely even supports the group because of the large quantity of stolen data available from its members. At\nthe same time, while the Red Hacker Alliance is afraid of a crackdown on its activities, the government fears an\nonline rebellion by the hacktivists if it decides to oppose them.[151] Overall, it is an intriguing paradox that the Chinese\ngovernment needs to address. However, despite the risk of becoming malicious against the motherland itself, or the\nchance of cyber incidents spiralling out of control, the groups have efficiently proven their value and are thus unlikely\nto fall under more serious control by the government.\n\nSlightly different from the above described organs is the so-called ‘cyber militias’, which consist of hackers, IT\ncompanies, scientists, network engineers, foreign language speakers, and others with useful skills. Their main\nmission is to take part in military exercises as part of the National Emergency Drill Structure. However, they are not\ndirectly managed by the PLA in order to avoid the possible ambiguity over their combatant status and activities.[152]\nThe cyber militias are seen as part of the effort to enhance civil-military cooperation within the country and were\neven impliedly provided with a strategic impetus in the civilian 15-year strategy issued in 2006.[153] Contrary to\npopular belief, the groups tend to have a rather defensive nature, and conduct training missions for the PLA\noperators and research on cyber warfare.[154] Consisting of over eight million citizens, all related to Chinese\ndevelopmental programmes, it is a powerful force. While open source information on who controls such a large\nnumber of people remains unavailable, it is believed that the cyber militia are commanded through hierarchical\nlayers of administration similar to a regular militia. However, the extent of the cyber militia’s connections and\n\n149 For a detailed overview of the nature and the impact of the ongoing military reforms, see Allen, Kenneth, Dennis J.

Having worked hand in hand with\nthe government, 3/PLA and 4/PLA had so far played a critical role in executing China’s overall ambition to catch up\nwith Western technological development, and also obtain economic and political advantage in order to increase\nChina’s international bargaining power. As the responsibilities of these two departments have likely been integrated\ninto the Strategic Support Force, the efficiency of China’s state-led cyber operations is further expected to increase\nand the intense focus on information warfare indicates China’s ability to adapt its military force to the changing\nnature of international conflict. Simultaneously, the patriotic hacking units are in a way trying to help the\ngovernment, but also risk harming China’s reputation and other countries’ willingness to cooperate, which is already\nhampered by the PLA’s cyber units’ activities. Yet, the Chinese government is unlikely to put a stop to further\ndevelopment of cyber espionage and cyber warfare capabilities, and perhaps rightfully so, looking at similar\nsurveillance activities of its main competitors and potential adversaries on the international arena.\n\n155 For a detailed overview on cyber militia, see Sheldon and McReynolds, 2015.\n\n27\n\n\n-----\n\nClarke, Richard A., and Robert K.
