    "plain_text": "# Waterbug: Espionage Group Rolls Out Brand-New Toolset in Attacks Against Governments\n\n**[symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments)**\n\nThe Waterbug espionage group (aka Turla) has continued to attack governments and\ninternational organizations over the past eighteen months in a series of campaigns that\nhave featured a rapidly evolving toolset and, in one notable instance, the apparent hijacking\nof another espionage group’s infrastructure.\n\n## Three waves of attacks\n\nRecent Waterbug activity can be divided into three distinct campaigns, characterized by\ndiffering toolsets. One campaign involved a new and previously unseen backdoor called\n[Neptun (Backdoor.Whisperer). Neptun is installed on Microsoft Exchange servers and is](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2019-052708-1556-99)\ndesigned to passively listen for commands from the attackers. This passive listening\ncapability makes the malware more difficult to detect. Neptun is also able to download\nadditional tools, upload stolen files, and execute shell commands. One attack during this\ncampaign involved the use of infrastructure belonging to another espionage group known\nas Crambus (aka OilRig, APT34).\n\nA second campaign used Meterpreter, a publicly available backdoor along with two custom\nloaders, a custom backdoor called photobased.dll, and a custom Remote Procedure Call\n[(RPC) backdoor. Waterbug has been using Meterpreter since at least early 2018](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shift-towards-generic-tools/) and, in this\ncampaign, used a modified version of Meterpreter, which was encoded and given a .wav\nextension in order to disguise its true purpose.\n\nThe third campaign deployed a different custom RPC backdoor to that used in the second\n[campaign. This backdoor used code derived from the publicly available PowerShellRunner](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/29/turla-powershell-usage/)\ntool to execute PowerShell scripts without using powershell.exe. This tool is designed to\nbypass detection aimed at identifying malicious PowerShell usage. Prior to execution, the\nPowerShell scripts were stored Base64-encoded in the registry. This was probably done to\navoid them being written to the file system.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Waterbug group rolls out fresh toolset in three new campaigns\n\n## Retooled\n\nWaterbug’s most recent campaigns have involved a swath of new tools including custom\nmalware, modified versions of publicly available hacking tools, and legitimate administration\ntools. The group has also followed the current shift towards “living off the land,” making use\nof PowerShell scripts and PsExec, a Microsoft Sysinternals tool used for executing processes\non other systems.\n\nAside from new tools already mentioned above, Waterbug has also deployed:\n\nA new custom dropper typically used to install Neptun as a service.\nA custom hacking tool that combines four leaked Equation Group tools (EternalBlue,\nEternalRomance, DoublePulsar, SMBTouch) into a single executable.\nA USB data collecting tool that checks for a connected USB drive and steals certain file\ntypes, encrypting them into a RAR file. It then uses WebDAV to upload to a Box cloud\ndrive.\nVisual Basic scripts that perform system reconnaissance after initial infection and then\nsend information to Waterbug command and control (C&C) servers.\nPowerShell scripts that perform system reconnaissance and credential theft from\nWindows Credential Manager and then send this information back to Waterbug C&Cs.\nPublicly available tools such as IntelliAdmin to execute RPC commands, SScan and\nNBTScan for network reconnaissance, PsExec for execution and lateral movement,\n[and Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz) for credential theft, and Certutil.exe to download](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2012-042615-3731-99)\nand decode remote files. These tools were identified being downloaded via Waterbug\ntools or infrastructure.\n\n## Victims\n\nThese three recent Waterbug campaigns have seen the group compromise governments\nand international organizations across the globe in addition to targets in the IT and\neducation sectors. Since early 2018, Waterbug has attacked 13 organizations across 10\ndifferent countries:\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a Latin American country\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a Middle Eastern country\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a European country\nThe Ministry of the Interior of a South Asian country\nTwo unidentified government organizations in a Middle Eastern country\nOne unidentified government organization in a Southeast Asian country\n\n\n-----\n\nA government office of a South Asian country based in another country\nAn information and communications technology organization in a Middle Eastern\ncountry\nTwo information and communications technology organizations in two European\ncountries\nAn information and communications technology organization in a South Asian country\nA multinational organization in a Middle Eastern country\nAn educational institution in a South Asian country\n\n## Hijacked infrastructure\n\nOne of the most interesting things to occur during one of Waterbug’s recent campaigns was\nthat during an attack against one target in the Middle East, Waterbug appeared to hijack\ninfrastructure from the Crambus espionage group and used it to deliver malware on to the\nvictim’s network. Press reports have linked Crambus and Waterbug to different nation\nstates. While it is possible that the two groups may have been collaborating, Symantec has\nfound no further evidence to support this. In all likelihood, Waterbug’s use of Crambus\ninfrastructure appears to have been a hostile takeover. Curiously though, Waterbug also\ncompromised other computers on the victim’s network using its own infrastructure.\n\nDuring this attack, a customized variant of the publicly available hacking tool Mimikatz was\ndownloaded to a computer on the victim’s network from known Crambus-controlled\nnetwork infrastructure. Mimikatz was downloaded via the Powruner tool and the Poison\nFrog control panel. Both the infrastructure and the Powruner tool have been publicly tied to\nCrambus by a number of vendors. Both were also mentioned in recent leaks of documents\ntied to Crambus.\n\nSymantec believes that the variant of Mimikatz used in this attack is unique to Waterbug. It\nwas heavily modified, with almost all original code stripped out aside from its\nsekurlsa::logonpasswords credential stealing feature. Waterbug has frequently made\nextensive modifications to publicly available tools, something Crambus is not well known\nfor.\n\nThe variant of Mimikatz used was packed with a custom packing routine that has not been\nseen before in any non-Waterbug malware. Waterbug used this same packer on a second\ncustom variant of Mimikatz and on a dropper for the group’s custom Neuron service\n[(Trojan.Cadanif). Its use in the dropper leads us to conclude that this custom packer is](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2017-032415-1608-99)\nexclusively used by Waterbug. Additionally, this version of Mimikatz was compiled using\nVisual Studio and the publicly available bzip2 library which, although not unique, has been\nused by other Waterbug tools previously.\n\nAside from the attack involving Crambus infrastructure, this sample of Mimikatz has only\nbeen seen used in one other attack against an education target in the UK in 2017 On that\n\n\n-----\n\noccasion, Mimikatz was dropped by a known Waterbug tool.\n\nIn the case of the attack against the Middle Eastern target, Crambus was the first group to\ncompromise the victim’s network, with the earliest evidence of activity dating to November\n2017. The first observed evidence of Waterbug activity came on January 11, 2018, when a\nWaterbug-linked tool (a task scheduler named msfgi.exe) was dropped on to a computer on\nthe victim’s network. The next day, January 12, the aforementioned variant of Mimikatz was\ndownloaded to the same computer from a known Crambus C&C server. Two further\ncomputers on the victim’s network were compromised with Waterbug tools on January 12,\nbut there is no evidence that Crambus infrastructure was used in these attacks. While one\nof these computers had been previously compromised by Crambus, the other showed no\nsigns of Crambus intrusion.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Waterbug likely compromised the C&C network infrastructure of Crambus\n\nWaterbug’s intrusions on the victim’s network continued for much of 2018. On September 5,\n2018, a similar Mimikatz variant was dropped by Waterbug’s Neptun backdoor onto another\ncomputer on the network. At around the same time, other Waterbug malware was seen on\nthe victim’s network which communicated with known Waterbug C&C servers.\n\nFinally, the issue was clouded further by the appearance of a legitimate systems\nadministration tool called IntelliAdmin on the victim’s network. This tool is known to have\nbeen used by Crambus and was mentioned in the leak of Crambus documents. However, in\n\n\n-----\n\nthis case, IntelliAdmin was dropped by custom Waterbug backdoors, including the newly\nidentified Neptun backdoor, on computers that had not been affected by the Crambus\ncompromise.\n\nThe incident leaves many unanswered questions, chiefly relating to Waterbug’s motive for\nusing Crambus infrastructure. There are several possibilities:\n\n1. **[False flag: Waterbug does have a track record of using false flag tactics to throw](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2017/10/20114955/Bartholomew-GuerreroSaade-VB2016.pdf)**\n\ninvestigators off the scent. However, if this was a genuine attempt at a false flag\noperation, it begs the question of why it also used its own infrastructure to\ncommunicate with other machines on the victim’s network, in addition to using tools\nthat could be traced back to Waterbug.\n2. **Means of intrusion: It is possible that Waterbug wanted to compromise the target**\n\norganization, found out that Crambus had already compromised its network, and\nhijacked Crambus’s own infrastructure as a means of gaining access. Symantec did not\nobserve the initial access point and the close timeframe between Waterbug observed\nactivity on the victim’s network and its observed use of Crambus infrastructure\nsuggests that Waterbug may have used the Crambus infrastructure as an initial access\npoint.\n3. **Mimikatz variant belonged to Crambus: There is a possibility that the version of**\n\nMimikatz downloaded by the Crambus infrastructure was actually developed by\nCrambus. However, the compilation technique and the fact that the only other\noccasion it was used was linked to Waterbug works against this hypothesis. The fact\nthat Waterbug also appeared on the victim’s network around the same time this\nversion of Mimikatz was downloaded would make it an unlikely coincidence if the tool\ndid belong to Crambus.\n4. **Opportunistic sowing of confusion: If a false flag operation wasn’t planned from the**\n\nstart, it is possible that Waterbug discovered the Crambus intrusion while preparing\nits attack and opportunistically used it in the hopes of sowing some confusion in the\nmind of the victim or investigators. Based on recent leaks of Crambus internal\ndocuments, its Poison Frog control panel is known to be vulnerable to compromise,\nmeaning it may have been a relatively trivial diversion on the part of Waterbug to\nhijack Crambus’s infrastructure. A compromise conducted by one threat actor group\nthrough another's infrastructure, or fourth party collections, has been previously\ndiscussed in a 2017 white paper by Kaspersky researchers.\n\n## Further campaigns\n\nWaterbug has also mounted two other campaigns over the past year, each of which was\ncharacterized by separate tools. These campaigns were wide ranging, hitting targets in\nEurope, Latin America, and South Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the first campaign, Waterbug used two versions of a custom loader named javavs.exe (64bit) and javaws.exe (32-bit), to load a custom backdoor named PhotoBased.dll and run the\nexport function GetUpdate on the victim’s computers. The backdoor will modify the registry\nfor the Windows Media Player to store its C&C configuration. It also reconfigures the\nMicrosoft Sysinternals registry to prevent pop-ups when running the PsExec tool. The\nbackdoor has the capability to download and upload files, execute shell commands, and\nupdate its configuration.\n\nThe javaws.exe loader is also used to run another loader named tasklistw.exe. This is used\nby the attackers to decode and execute a series of malicious executables that download\nMeterpreter to the infected computer.\n\nThe attackers also install another backdoor that runs a command shell via the named pipe\ncmd_pipe. Both backdoors allow the attackers to execute various commands that provide\nfull control of the victim’s system. Waterbug also used an older version of PowerShell, likely\nto avoid logging.\n\nIn the second campaign, Waterbug used an entirely different backdoor, [named securlsa.chk.](https://github.com/k-vitali/Malware-Misc-RE/blob/master/2019-04-13-Possible-Turla-PowerShell-Implant.ps1)\nThis backdoor can receive commands through the RPC protocol. Its capabilities include:\n\nExecuting commands through cmd.exe with the output redirected into a temporary\nfile\nReading the command output contained in the temporary file\nReading or writing arbitrary files\n\nThis RPC backdoor also included source code derived from the tool PowerShellRunner,\nwhich allows a user to run PowerShell scripts without executing powershell.exe, therefore\nthe user may bypass detection aimed at identifying malicious PowerShell usage.\n\nWhile both campaigns involved distinct tools during the initial compromise phase, there\nwere also many similarities. Both were characterized by the use of a combination of custom\nmalware and publicly available tools. Also, during both campaigns Waterbug executed\nmultiple payloads nearly simultaneously, most likely to ensure overlapping access to the\nnetwork if defenders found and removed one of the backdoors.\n\nWaterbug took several steps to avoid detection. It named Meterpreter as a WAV file type,\nprobably in the hope that this would not raise suspicions. The group also used GitHub as a\nrepository for tools that it downloaded post-compromise. This too was likely motivated by a\ndesire to evade detection, since GitHub is a widely trusted website. It used Certutil.exe to\ndownload files from the repository, which is an application whitelist bypass technique for\nremote downloads.\n\nIn one of these campaigns, Waterbug used a USB stealer that scans removable storage\ndevices to identify and collect files of interest It then packages stolen files into a password\n\n-----\n\nprotected RAR archive. The malware then uses WebDAV to upload the RAR archive to a Box\naccount.\n\n## Unanswered questions\n\nThis is the first time Symantec has observed one targeted attack group seemingly hijack and\nuse the infrastructure of another group. However, it is still difficult to ascertain the motive\nbehind the attack. Whether Waterbug simply seized the opportunity to create confusion\nabout the attack or whether there was more strategic thinking involved remains unknown.\n\nWaterbug’s ever-changing toolset demonstrates a high degree of adaptability by a group\ndetermined to avoid detection by staying one step ahead of its targets. Frequent retooling\nand a penchant for flirting with false flag tactics have made this group one of the most\nchallenging adversaries on the targeted attack landscape.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\nSymantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks:\n\n**File-based protection**\n\n[Backdoor.Whisperer](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2019-052708-1556-99)\n[Hacktool.Mimikatz](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2012-042615-3731-99)\n\n**Threat Intelligence**\n\n[The DeepSight Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI)](https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/deepsight-intelligence/adversary) team co-authored this\nblog and its customers have received intelligence with additional details about these\ncampaigns, the characteristics of the Waterbug (aka Turla) cyber espionage group, and\nmethods of detecting and thwarting activities of this adversary.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Campaign 1**\n\n24fe571f3066045497b1d8316040734c81c71dcb1747f1d7026cda810085fad7\n66893ab83a7d4e298720da28cd2ea4a860371ae938cdd86035ce920b933c9d85\n7942eee31d8cb1c8853ce679f686ee104d359023645c7cb808361df791337145\n7bd3ff9ba43020688acaa05ce4e0a8f92f53d9d9264053255a5937cbd7a5465e\na1d9f5b9ca7dda631f30bd1220026fc8c3a554d61db09b5030b8eb9d33dc9356\nc63f425d96365d906604b1529611eefe5524432545a7977ebe2ac8c79f90ad7e\ncb7ecd6805b12fdb442faa8f61f6a2ee69b8731326a646ba1e8886f0a5dd61e0\ndb9902cb42f6dc9f1c02bd3413ab3969d345eb6b0660bd8356a0c328f1ec0c07\n\n\n-----\n\ne0c316b1d9d3d9ec5a97707a0f954240bbc9748b969f9792c472d0a40ab919ea\ne0c316b1d9d3d9ec5a97707a0f954240bbc9748b969f9792c472d0a40ab919ea\n5da013a64fd60913b5cb94e85fc64624d0339e09d7dce25ab9be082f0ca5e38b\nc8a864039f4d271f4ab6f440cbc14dffd8c459aa3af86f79f0619a13f67c309f\n588fd8eba6e62c28a584781deefe512659f6665daeb8c85100e0bf7a472ad825\ncda5b20712e59a6ba486e55a6ab428b9c45eb8d419e25f555ae4a7b537fc2f26\n694d9c8a1f0563c08e0d3ab7d402ffbf5a0fa11340c50fba84d709384ccef021\ncaaed70daa7832952ae93f41131e74dcb6724bb8669d18f28fbed4aa983fdc0c\n493eee2c55810201557ef0e5d134ca0d9569f25ae732df139bb0cb3d1478257f\n0e9c3779fece579bed30cb0b7093a962d5de84faa2d72e4230218d4a75ee82bc\n5bbeed53aaa40605aabbfde31cbfafd5b92b52720e05fa6469ce1502169177a0\nd153e4b8a11e2537ecf99aec020da5fad1e34bbe79f617a3ee5bc0b07c3abdca\n\nvision2030.tk\nvision2030.cf\ndubaiexpo2020.cf\nmicrosoft.updatemeltdownkb7234.com\ncodewizard.ml\nupdatenodes.site\n\nhttps://vision2030.tk/static/googleupdate.txt\nhttps://dubaiexpo2020.cf/counter.aspx\nhttps://microsoft.updatemeltdownkb7234.com/windows/update.aspx\nhttps://codewizard.ml/productivity/update.aspx\n\n**Campaign 2**\n\n10d1bfd5e8e1c8fa75756a9f1787c3179da9ab338a476f1991d9e300c6186575\n3fbec774da2a145974a917aeb64fc389345feb3e581b46d018077e28333601a5\n52169d7cdd01098efdde4da3fb22991aaa53ab9e02db5d80114a639bf65bce39\n56098ed50e25f28d466be78a36c643d19fedc563a2250ae86a6d936318b7f57e\n595a54f0bbf297041ce259461ae8a12f37fb29e5180705eafb3668b4a491cecc\n5dc26566b4dec09865ea89edd4f9765ef93e789870ed4c25fcc4ebad19780b40\n6b60b27385738cac65584cf7d486913ff997c66d97a94e1dde158c9cd03a4206\n846a95a26aac843d1fcec51b2b730e9e8f40032ee4f769035966169d68d144c4\nc4a6db706c59a5a0a29368f80731904cc98a26e081088e5793764a381708b1ea\nd0b99353cb6500bb18f6e83fe9eed9ce16e5a8d5b940181e5eafd8d82f328a59\nee7f92a158940a0b5d9b902eb0ed9a655c7e6ba312473b1e2c9ef80d58baa6dd\n\n94.249.192.182\n\n**Campaign 3**\n\n\n-----\n\n454e6c3d8c1c982cd301b4dd82ec3431935c28adea78ed8160d731ab0bed6cb7\n4ecb587ee9b872747408c00de5619cb6b973e7d39ce4937655c5d1a07b7500fc\n528e2567e24809d2d0ba96fd70e41d71c18152f0f0c4f29ced129ed7701fa42a\n6928e212874686d29c85eac72553ccdf89aacb475c61fa3c086c796df3ab5940\nb22bbda8f504f8cced886f566f954cc245f3e7c205e57139610bbbff0412611c\nd52b08dd27f2649bad764152dfc2a7dea0c8894ce7c20b51482f4a4cf3e1e792\ne7e41b3d7c0ee2d0939bb56d797eaf2dec44516ba54b8bf1477414b03d4d6e48\nec3da59d4a35941f6951639d81d1c5ff73057d9cf779428d80474e9656db427c\nfbefe503d78104e04625a511528584327ac129c3436e4df09f3d167e438a1862\n\nmarkham-travel.com\nzebra.wikaba.com\n185.141.62.32\n212.21.52.110\n\nSymantec’s managed adversary and threat intelligence (MATI) team of intelligence analysts\n& researchers are dedicated to understanding the adversary ecosystem and providing\ninsightful customer reports detailing their plans, tactics, tools, and campaigns.\n\n\n-----",
