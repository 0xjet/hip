We devise a method for querying\n\nFinFisher’s “anonymizing proxies” to unmask the true location of the spyware’s master servers. Since the master\n\nservers are installed on the premises of FinFisher customers, tracing the servers allows us to identify which\n\ngovernments are likely using FinFisher. In some cases, we can trace the servers to specific entities inside a\n\ngovernment by correlating our scan results with publicly available sources. Our results indicate 32 countries where\nat least one government entity is likely using the spyware suite, and we are further able to identify 10 entities by\n\nname. Despite the 2014 FinFisher breach, and subsequent disclosure of sensitive customer data, our scanning has\n\ndetected more servers in more countries than ever before.\n\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nFinFisher is a sophisticated computer spyware suite, written by Munich-based FinFisher GmbH, and sold exclusively to\n\ngovernments for intelligence and law enforcement purposes. Although marketed as a tool for fighting crime,[1] the\n\nspyware has been involved in a number of high-profile surveillance abuses. Between 2010 and 2012, Bahrain’s\n\ngovernment used FinFisher to monitor some of the country’s top law firms, journalists, activists, and opposition political\n\nleaders.[2] Ethiopian dissidents in exile in the United Kingdom[3] and the United States[4] have also been infected with\n\nFinFisher spyware.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Citizen Lab researchers and collaborators,[5] published several reports analyzing FinFisher spyware, and\n\nconducted scanning that identified FinFisher command and control (C&C) servers in a number of countries. In our\n\nprevious research, we were not yet able to differentiate between FinFisher anonymizing proxies and master servers, a\n\ndistinction that we make in this work.\n\nWhen a government entity purchases FinFisher spyware, they receive a FinSpy Master—a C&C server that is installed on\n\nthe entity’s premises.[6] The entity may then set up anonymizing proxies (also referred to as “proxies” or “FinSpy\n\nRelays” in the FinFisher documentation), to obscure the location of their master. Infected computers communicate with\n\nthe anonymizing proxy, which is “usually”[7] set up on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider in a third country. The proxy\n\nthen forwards communications between a victim’s computer and the Master server.\n\nWe first describe how we scanned the Internet for FinFisher servers and distinguished masters from proxies (Part 1: Fishing\n\n**for FinFisher). We then outline our findings regarding 32 governments and 10 specific government entities that we believe**\n\nare using FinFisher (Part 2: Country Findings). Finally, we highlight several cases that illuminate connections between\n\ndifferent threat actors (Part 3: A Deeper Analysis of Several Cases), before concluding (Conclusion).\n\n# Part 1: Fishing for FinFisher\n\nIn this section, we describe our scans for FinFisher servers, and how we unmasked the true location of the master servers to\n\nidentify governments using FinFisher.\n\nEach FinFisher sample includes the address of one or more C&C servers that the spyware reports back to. These C&C\n\nservers are typically FinSpy Relays, which forward connections back and forth between a device infected with FinFisher,\n\nand a FinSpy Master. The purpose of the FinSpy Relay is explicitly to make it “practically impossible” (their emphasis) for\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: How targets infected with FinFisher communicate with the FinSpy Master via one or more FinSpy Relays.[9]**\n\nWe employed zmap[10] to scan the entire IPv4 Internet (/0) several times since the end of December 2014 and throughout\n\n2015, using a new FinFisher server fingerprint that we devised by analyzing FinFisher samples. Our scans yielded 135\n\nservers matching our fingerprint, which we believe are a mix of FinSpy Masters and FinSpy Relays.\n\nWhen one queries a FinFisher server, or types the server’s address into a web browser, the server typically returns a\n\ndecoy page. A decoy page is a page designed to disguise the fact that the server is a spyware server. We found some\n\nvariation in the decoy pages used by FinFisher servers that we detected, though the bulk used either www.google.com\n\nor www.yahoo.com. Peculiarly, FinSpy Relays appear to return decoy pages fetched by their FinSpy Master, rather than\n\ndirectly fetching the decoy pages themselves. Thus, in many cases, the pages returned by the FinSpy Relays contain\n\n**location data apparently about the FinSpy Master (e.g., certain Google and Yahoo pages embed the requester’s IP**\n\n**address or localized weather), which can reveal the location of FinSpy Masters.**\n\n## Okay Google, What is my IP?\n\nWe noticed that when we issued a query like “What is my IP address?” to a Google-decoy FinFisher server, the server\n\nwould respond with a different IP address. In the case below, a FinFisher server 206.190.159.xxx (located in the United\n\nStates) reported that its IP address was the Indonesian IP 112.78.143.xxx, which matches a FinFisher server first detected in\n\nAugust 2012 by Claudio Guarnieri.[11] We hypothesize that 206.190.159.xxx is a FinFisher proxy, designed to obscure the\n\nlocation of the FinFisher master, which is at 112.78.143.xxx.\n\n**Figure 2: A FinFisher server in the US seems to be a proxy for a master in Indonesia.**\n\nSpecifically, we sent queries of the form:\n\n\nGET /search?q=my+ip+address&nord=1 HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: [ip of server]\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0\n\n\n**Figure 3: Queries we sent to Google-decoy FinFisher servers to reveal the IP address of the master.[12]**\n\nThe fact that FinFisher proxies can apparently reveal the IP of the master is quite peculiar. We illustrate below how we\n\nbelieve a query like “What is my IP address?” is routed through FinSpy Relays to the FinSpy Master:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: How we believe a “What is my IP address?” query is routed through FinSpy Relays to a FinSpy Master.**\n\nIt appears that the “What is my IP Address?” query is delivered from our Measurement Machine by the FinSpy Relay to\n\nthe FinSpy Master, and then submitted to Google by the FinSpy Master. Therefore, Google returns the IP address of the\n\n**FinSpy Master, which is then sent back to the Measurement Machine via the FinSpy Relay.**\n\n## How’s the Weather in Caracas?\n\nA significant number of FinFisher servers we detected used www.yahoo.com as their decoy page. While we were unable\n\nto devise a method to find the exact IP address of Yahoo-decoy FinFisher endpoints, we were still able to retrieve location\n\ninformation from Yahoo, by examining the userLocation object in the decoy page’s source code. Yahoo utilizes a\n\nuser’s location to customize several elements of Yahoo’s homepage, including weather and news.\n\n**Figure 5: Weather conditions in Caracas returned by a FinFisher server in Lithuania.**\n\nThe userLocation object returned by 185.8.106.xxx (located in Lithuania) is shown below:\n\n\n\"userLocation\":\n\n{\"woeid\":395269,\n\n\"zip\":\"Caracas\",\n\n\"city\":\"Caracas\",\n\n\"state\":\"Distrito Federal\",\n\n\"country\":\"Venezuela\",\n\n\"countryCode\":\"VE\",\n\n...}\n\n\n**Figure 6: A FinFisher server in Lithuania seems to be a proxy for a master in Venezuela.**\n\nThe userLocation object allows us to obtain city and country information for FinFisher endpoints, though we cannot\n\ndetermine their precise IP address. We issued a query similar to the following to each Yahoo-decoy FinFisher server to\n\nobtain a page with the userLocation object:\n\n\nGET https://www.yahoo.com/ HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: www.yahoo.com\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0\n\n\n**Figure 7:Queries we sent to Yahoo-decoy FinFisher servers to reveal the location of the master.[13]**\n\nSince Yahoo, like Google, implements SSL redirection by default, we had to devise a method to talk to Yahoo in plain\n\nHTTP. While Google provides the “nord=1” URL parameter to avoid SSL redirection, Yahoo apparently does not have\n\nan analogous publicized solution. However, we found that by sending plain HTTP GET requests to the resource\n\n“https://www.yahoo.com/” we could communicate with www.yahoo.com in plain HTTP without triggering SSL\n\nredirection.\n\n## Other Deco s\n\n\n-----\n\nOne server used the Italian news source libero.it as a decoy. We noted that libero.it sets the “Libero” cookie, which\n\ncontains the IP address of the computer that visited the libero.it website. When accessing 185.8.106.xxx, the Libero-decoy\n\nFinFisher server, the cookie was set to include the Italian IP 93.146.250.xxx.[14] Servers that we traced to Macedonia used\n\nMacedonian newsmagazine time.mk as a decoy. Servers we traced to Taiwan used Taiwanese web portal\n\n**pchome.com.tw as a decoy. We were unable to trace other servers which used file download site filehippo.com as a**\n\ndecoy. A handful of other untraceable servers returned custom HTML code as a decoy (e.g., a webpage with a META\n\nredirect to www.google.com).\n\n## General Comments\n\nThis design peculiarity is only the latest instance of fingerprintable anomalies in spyware decoy pages. FinFisher\n\ncompetitor Hacking Team formerly used decoy pages on its C&C server for Remote Control System (RCS), but apparently\n\nremoved them[15] after our research revealed that anomalies in the decoy pages could be used to fingerprint RCS\n\nservers.[16] We have also previously used decoy pages to fingerprint FinFisher servers.[17] We believe that FinFisher or its\n\nclients may also be realizing that decoy pages are problematic, as we have observed fewer FinFisher servers returning\n\ndecoy pages over time.\n\n# Part 2: Country Findings\n\nIn this section, we provide a list of likely FinFisher government users identified by our scans, and also map out which FinSpy\n\nrelays serve which FinSpy Masters.\n\nBelow, we identify 33 likely government users of FinFisher in 32 countries, based on the presence of a FinFisher master at\n\nan IP address in a country[18] or belonging to a specific government department.\n\n**Figure 8: Suspected FinFisher government users that were active at some point in 2015.**\n\nIn presenting our scan results, we do not wish to disrupt or interfere with legitimately sanctioned investigations or other\n\nactivities. Instead, we hope to ensure that citizens have the opportunity to hold their governments transparent and\n\naccountable. To this end, we identify government users, but redact certain details we have discovered about their\n\ninfrastructure whose disclosure might interfere with legitimately sanctioned activities. Redacted details include the last\n\noctet of live IP addresses, and part of live domain names. Appendix A contains a full list of countries and servers.\n\n**Country** **Specific entity if known**\n\nAngola\n\nBangladesh Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI)\n\nBelgium Federal Police\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nCzech Republic\n\nEgypt Technology Research Department (TRD)\n\nEthiopia\n\nGabon\n\n|Country|Specific entity if known|\n|---|---|\n|Angola||\n|Bangladesh|Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI)|\n|Belgium|Federal Police|\n|Bosnia and Herzegovina||\n|Czech Republic||\n|Egypt|Technology Research Department (TRD)|\n|Ethiopia||\n\n\n-----\n\n|Italy|Unknown multiple entities|\n|---|---|\n|Jordan||\n|Kazakhstan||\n|Kenya|National Intelligence Service (NIS)|\n|Lebanon|1.

We have also previously identified potential legal concerns regarding locating\n\nrelays in other countries.[21]\n\n## Attribution to Specific Entities\n\nWe attributed some FinFisher Master servers to specific government entities by correlating our scan results with publicly\n\navailable data, including emails from FinFisher’s competitor Hacking Team. This section briefly describes how we\n\nidentified these entities, and summarizes what is publicly known about their functions. While we do not provide a vignette\n\nfor each country where we have identified FinFisher, we note that a number of countries have dubious or problematic\n\nhistories of oversight of the security services.\n\n## Bangladesh\n\n**Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI)**\n\n\nOur investigation uncovered a FinFisher server at an IP address in the same /30 as the mail server for Bangladesh’s\n\nDGFI, [redacted].dgfi.gov.bd. Additionally, leaked Hacking Team emails claim that Bangladesh’s DGFI is a\n\nFinFisher customer.[22]\n\n\nEstablished in 1976, the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) is Bangladesh’s military intelligence agency.\n\nThe director of the agency holds the rank of Lieutenant General or Major General and directly reports to the Prime\n\nMinister.[23] In a report published in 2008, Human Rights Watch associated the DGFI with long-standing human rights\n\nviolations (e.g., torture and extrajudicial killings) and the stifling of political opposition in the country.[24]\n\nThe US State Department has reported that the DGFI has previously conducted surveillance on citizens for their criticism of\n\nthe government.[25] Leaked emails show that DGFI officials were engaged in discussions with FinFisher’s competitor\n\nHacking Team in June 2014.[26]\n\n## Belgium\n\n**Federal Police Service**\n\n\nOur investigation found a FinFisher server in a /28 assigned to Belgacom, denoted “SKY-5904592 / SOCC-2131136.”\n\nThis range of IP addresses also contained several servers returning SSL certificates issued by and to “Federal\n\nPolice.” Two IP addresses in this range were also pointed to by two subdomains of raspol.be, a domain name\n\nregistered to “Massimo Moschettini / ISRD NTSU / Police Fédérale.”\n\n\nBelgium’s Federal Police Service was established in January 2001. The agency is headed by a General Commissioner\n\nwho coordinates the work of five general directorates, including administrative police, judicial police, operational\n\nsupport, logistics, and human resources, as well as several departments that report directly to him/her.[27] Leaked Hacking\n\nTeam emails have revealed the company’s participation in a tender for “tactical interception of communications via\n\ncomputer systems” by the Belgian Federal Police.[28]\n\n\n-----\n\nOur investigation found a FinFisher server in the same /26 as bia.gov.rs, the website of Serbia’s Security Information\n\nAgency (BIA). The server was also in the same /28 as a computer that identified itself to Shodan as “DPRODAN\nPC”.[29] According to the leaked Hacking Team emails, a person with the email dprodan@open.telekom.rs\n\ncontacted Hacking Team in reference to a February 8, 2012 demo in Belgrade.[30] From February 7-9, 2012, Hacking\n\nTeam was in Belgrade to give a demo to a potential client, Vladimir Djokic, who worked for the BIA according to his\n\nemail address vladimirdj@bia.gov.rs.[31] Thus, we believe “dprodan” is also a BIA employee, and the FinFisher\n\nserver we found belongs to the BIA.\n\n\nSerbia’s Security Information Agency (BIA) was created in 2002 by the Law on the Security Information Agency. BIA is a\n\ncivil national security service and a part of the security-intelligence system of the Republic of Serbia.[32]\n\nWhile the BIA is generally regarded as operating with appropriate oversight and as being free from major abuses, some\n\nelements of its electronic surveillance practices have been challenged. Prior to 2014, the Law on the Security Information\n\nAgency was considered to be not in compliance with the constitution. In 2012, a constitutional court struck down several\n\nprovisions of the Law on the Security Information Agency, ruling that Articles 13, 14 and 15 of the Law, which govern the\n\nwiretapping of private communications, were unconstitutional.[33] The court ruled that these Articles were “not\n\nformulated clearly and precisely enough” and that citizens are “thus prevented from ascertaining which legal rule will\n\nbe applied in the given circumstances and are thus deprived of the possibility to protect themselves from inadmissible\n\nrestrictions of their right or arbitrary interference in their right to respect of their private life and correspondence”.[34]\n\nFurther, measures related to the ability of the BIA’s Director to authorize wiretapping in some circumstances without a\n\ncourt order were also challenged.[35] The court delayed its decision in order to give legislators the opportunity to revise the\n\noffending Articles in the Law.[36] The amendments to the Law were adopted in June 2014.[37] While acknowledged as a\n\npositive step, these amendments have been criticized as remaining “insufficient to fully democratize surveillance that is\n\ncarried out by the BIA”.[38]\n\nLeaked emails indicate that members of the Security Information Agency and the Ministry of Defense engaged in\n\npurchase negotiations with FinFisher’s competitor Hacking Team.[39]\n\n## Egypt\n\n**Technology Research Department**\n\n\nWe found a FinFisher server at IP address 62.114.252.xxx. We also found an email in the leaked Hacking Team emails\n\nthat, according to the headers, was sent from the same IP address.[40] The email was sent by Hacking Team\n\nemployee Davide Romualdi on June 25, 2015, when he was scheduled to be performing delivery[41] in Egypt for\n\nHacking Team customer TREVOR, identified as the TRD[42] (Technology Research Department).[43] Thus, we believe\n\nthe email was sent from the premises of the TRD, and the IP address 62.114.252.xxx belongs to the TRD.\n\n\nEgypt’s troubling human rights situation has continued to deteriorate under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. In recent\n\nyears, cases of mass arrests, significant violence against protesters and due process violations have increased.[44]\n\nNumerous Egyptian security agencies are permitted to conduct electronic surveillance, frequently with limited court\n\noversight. In somes, personal data improperly collected from civil society actors has led to their arrest and\n\nimprisonment.[45] While there is limited open source information available about the activities of the Technology Research\n\nDepartment, we closely examine a malware campaign linked to TRD infrastructure in Part 3 of this report.\n\n## Indonesia\n\n**National Encryption Body (Lembaga Sandi Negara)**\n\n\nTwo of the FinFisher servers we found in Indonesia were in the same /28. We found an IP address in this same /28\n\nincluded in the headers of an email sent by a Hacking Team employee[46] while he was in Indonesia[47] performing a\n\ndemo for the National Encryption Body. The email was sent at 12:39 PM Jakarta time on February 6, 2013, and a\n\nmeeting at the agency was set for 10:00 AM on the same day.[48] Thus, it seems probable that the email was sent\n\nfrom the premises of the National Encryption Body, and that the two FinFisher servers belong to the same\n\norganization.\n\n\nThe National Encryption Body is an agency headed by a director, who has the same stature as a minister and reports\n\ndirectly to the President. In a recent interview, the Body’s current director, Major General Djoko Setyadi, describes the\n\nagency’s responsibilities as, among others, securing state secrets and decrypting/decoding communication from\n\nwould-be terrorists.[49]\n\nThe threat of terrorism is a concern for Indonesia. Several bombing incidents have occurred in the country, including two\n\nWestern hotels in the capital city of Jakarta in 2009. As the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, the emergence of\n\nthe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) has also resulted in concerns that their militant ideology will gain\n\nground It is believed that as many as 200 Indonesian citizens have headed to Syria to fight with ISIS [50] Challenges from\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2013 Citizen Lab report, we identified at least twelve laws, two government regulations, and two ministerial regulations\n\nthat govern wiretapping and interception in Indonesia. Although wiretapping and interception are helpful, and\n\nsometimes even necessary to expose crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption, the lack of comprehensive\n\nlegislation regulating their use in Indonesia means that there is an increased risk for misuse and privacy violations.[51]\n\n## Kenya\n\n**National Intelligence Service**\n\n\nWe found a FinFisher server in a range of IP addresses registered to a Kenyan user named “National Security\n\nIntelligence.” Kenya’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) was formerly known as the National Security Intelligence\n\nService (NSIS).\n\n\nKenya’s NSIS replaced the former Directorate of Security Intelligence (DSI), commonly known as the “Special\n\nBranch”.[52] The NIS is known as one of Kenya’s security institutions with the biggest budgetary allocation—along with\n\nthe Kenya National Defence Forces and the National Police Service—and considered to be among the country’s\n\ncritical security organs in the new constitution.[53] In 2014, Human Rights Watch named the NIS, as well as the Anti-Terrorism\n\nPolice Unit and other Kenyan intelligence agencies, as being implicated in abuses including torture, disappearances,\n\nand extrajudicial killings.[54]\n\nThe powers of the NIS were expanded significantly in December 2014 when the Parliament of Kenya rushed to pass the\n\ncontroversial Security Laws (Amendment) Bill.[55] The amendments came following a series of deadly terrorist attacks by\n\nthe militant group al-Shabab, including the 2013 killing of 67 people at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.[56] This bill\n\nexpanded the powers of the NIS to monitor communications without a warrant, as well as expanding their powers to\n\nsearch and seize private property.[57] Article 62 of the amended bill authorized NIS agents to “do anything necessary to\n\npreserve national security” and to detain individuals on simply the suspicion of engaging in acts which pose a threat to\n\nnational security.[58] Section 66 of the bill amended the National Intelligence Services Act, permitting the Director General\n\nof the NIS to monitor communications or “obtain any information, material, record, document or thing” in order to\n\nprotect national security, without court oversight, leading rights organization Article 19 to argue that the amendment\n\n“effectively [gives] carte blanche to the Director-General to order mass surveillance of online communications”.[59]\n\nWhile a court ruling in February 2015 struck down some provisions of the amendment, the provisions enhancing the\n\npowers of the NIS remained.[60]\n\n## Lebanon\n\n**General Directorate of General Security**\n\n\nWe found a FinFisher server in a range of IP addresses registered to a Lebanese user named “General_Security.”\n\nWe assume that “General_Security” is a reference to the General Directorate of General Security.\n\n\nLebanon’s General Directorate of General Security was established in 1921 under Decree No. 1061.[61] The functions of\n\nthe General Security include collecting and gathering intelligence, monitoring the media, and issuing passports and\n\ntravel documents to Lebanese citizens.[62] The organization is categorized as a general directorate under the supervision\n\nof the Ministry of Internal Affairs.[63]\n\nAlthough Lebanon has legislation (Law No. 140) which establishes safeguards and oversight protecting electronic\n\ncommunications from unlawful surveillance, there is a systemic practice of this law being ignored.[64] Privacy International\n\nhas criticized the surveillance practices of Lebanon’s intelligence agencies, suggesting that the agencies, including the\n\nGeneral Directorate of General Security, operate without sufficient independent oversight, and that a lack of trust\n\nbetween different agencies leads the groups to operate their own operations out of view of the Ministry of the Interior.[65]\n\nControversies surrounding government surveillance practices have become particularly salient in the wake of several\n\nrecent high-profile assassinations, including the 2005 killing of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Organizations investigating the\n\nassassinations have had “unregulated access to the data of private citizens”, including mobile phone records, which\n\nraises privacy concerns.[66]\n\n**Internal Security Forces**\n\n\nWe found a FinFisher server at a Lebanese IP address that was formerly pointed to by what was apparently a mail\n\nserver with domain “[redacted].intelligence.isf.gov.lb” in 2012. We assume that the IP still belongs to the Internal\n\nSecurity Forces (ISF).\n\n\nThe Internal Security Forces (ISF) are the national police and security force of Lebanon. The ISF’s creation was\n\nmandated by Decree 138 in 1959.[67] Throughout its history, the ISF has had a troubled record of human rights abuses, in\n\nspite of recent efforts to promote proper conduct within the organization In consultation with the UN Human Rights\n\n\n-----\n\ny q\n\nof conduct.\n\nAn extensive Human Rights Watch report in 2013 detailed dozens of instances of vulnerable individuals subject to physical\n\nabuse, torture and sexual assault at the hands of ISF officials.[69] In June 2015, five ISF officers were arrested after videos\n\nreleased on social media showed the officers beating prisoners.[70] The ISF and other state agencies have summoned and\n\nquestioned bloggers, journalists, and activists over social media and blog posts critical of politicians.[71]\n\nThe organization also has a history of overreach in the collection of Lebanese citizens’ private user data. In 2012, it was\n\nreported that the ISF had requested that the Ministry of Telecommunications turn over the content of all SMS text\n\nmessages sent over a two month span for all users in Lebanon, followed later by a request for Lebanese users’ login\n\ncredentials for BlackBerry Messenger and Facebook.[72] The request was made following the assassination of the ISF’s\n\nInformation Branch head Wissam al-Hassan, and was rejected by the Ministry.[73]\n\n## Morocco\n\n**Conseil Superieur De La Defense Nationale (CSDN) / Supreme Council of National Defense**\n\n\nWe found a FinFisher server in a range of IP addresses registered to a Moroccan user named “Conseil Superieur De\n\nLa Defense Nationale.” We assume that this is a reference to the eponymous agency.\n\n\nThere is limited open source information available about the activities of the CSDN. Leaked Hacking Team emails\n\nindicate that the CSDN — among other Moroccan Government agencies — was a customer of FinFisher’s competitor\n\nHacking Team.\n\nIn 2012, spyware from Hacking Team was used against Mamfakinch, an award-winning group of Moroccan citizen\n\njournalists.[74] Privacy International released a report detailing the impact of surveillance on the group, as well as other\n\npolitical activists and journalists.[75]\n\n## Mongolia\n\n**State Special Security Department (SSSD)**\n\n\nWe found a FinFisher server at a Mongolian IP address in the same /28 as an IP address pointed to by the domain\n\n“td.sssd.mn.” We believe that “SSSD” is a reference to the Mongolian agency of the same name. We also\n\nfound what appears to be a test or demonstration FinFisher sample, whose bait content includes emails apparently\n\nbetween Gamma Group and Mongolia’s SSSD, discussing a visit by Gamma personnel to Mongolia.\n\n\nThere is limited open source information available about the SSSD; however, leaked emails from the spyware firm Hacking\n\nTeam indicate that in 2012 the company was in contact with members of the SSSD.[76] Additional leaked emails from 2013\n\nindicate that Hacking Team scheduled a product demonstration with the SSSD in April 2013.[77]\n\n# Part 3: A Deeper Analysis of Several Cases\n\nThe following section provides additional details for several countries\n\n## Egypt: Use of FinFisher illuminates connections between different groups\n\nWe noted an interesting connection between Egypt’s Technology Research Department (TRD) and two other malware\n\ngroups in the region: MOLERATS, and an as-yet uncharacterized group. We have previously observed both groups\n\ntargeting UAE-based activists.\n\n**MOLERATS Attacks with FinFisher**\n\nWe found an Egypt FinFisher sample, Egyptian_army.rar, hosted on google.wwwhost.biz.\n\n\n**SHA256:  1610fc805f980f5c70cec8e138ba800b01ebc86919f42b375cfb161ce6365a48**\n\n**Filename: Egyptian_army.rar**\n\n\nExtracting the .rar file yields an .exe file.\n\n\n**SHA256:  94abf6df38f26530da2864d80e1a0b7cdfce63fd27b142993b89c52b3cee0389**\n\n**Filename:** ﺔﻠﻬﻤﻟﺍ ءﺎﻀﻘﻧﺍ ﺪﻌﺑ ﺶﻋﺍﺩ ﺪﻳ ﻰﻠﻋ ﺔﺒﺳﺎﺴﻜﻟﺍ ﺢﺑﺫ ﺭﻮﺻ.exe\n\n\nThe name of the .exe file promises pictures of Jordanian Air Force pilot burned alive by ISIS, a popular news story at the\n\ntime.\n\n\n-----\n\n**google.wwwhost.biz had IP address 200.74.241.111 at the same time as info.dynamic-dns.net, which also had IP**\n\naddress 192.161.48.59, shared with update.ciscofreak.com, which also had IP address 162.220.246.117. This IP\n\naddress is linked to several known MOLERATS domains, like natco{1,2,3,4,5}.no-ip.net,[78] and uae.kim.[79]\n\n**google.wwwhost.biz also hosted two DarkComet samples, which communicated with r.ddns.me, which shared IP**\n\naddress 198.105.125.158 with a.ddns.me, which shared IP address 23.229.3.37 with MOLERATS domain test.cable\n**modem.org.[80]**\n\n**google.wwwhost.biz also hosted a GMail phishing page, 64c1ef8e0923bf44aaa96caeb28a6c11, also hosted by**\n\n**googlecombq6xx.ddns.net, which shared IP address 131.72.136.28 with tvnew.otzo.com, which shared IP address**\n\n**172.227.95.162 with several known MOLERATS domains, like natco{1,2,3,4}.no-ip.net,[81] and uae.kim.[82]**\n\n**google.wwwhost.biz served a Hotmail phishing page, 57ab5f60198d311226cdc246598729ea, also served by**\n\n**google.com.r3irv2ykn0qnd7vr7sqv7kg2qho3ab5tngl5avxi5iimz1jxw9pa9.uae.kim; uae.kim is a known MOLERATS**\n\ndomain.[83]\n\nA significant portion of MOLERATS bait content we have observed indicates targeting of Israel and “political Islam”\n\ngroups like Hamas. This MOLERATS activity could be accounted for by any number of intelligence agencies active in the\n\nregion, or a Palestinian faction, but it is also possible that MOLERATS is a multi-faceted group with several interests and/or\n\nclients.\n\nThat MOLERATS apparently used spyware linked to the TRD suggests a possible connection between the TRD and\n\nMOLERATS.\n\n**The Curious Case of the Shared Exploit**\n\nWe identified the following Word document uploaded to VirusTotal:\n\n\n**SHA256:  22deea26981bc6183ac3945da8274111e7fd7a35fbb6da601348cc6d66240114**\n\n**Filename:** ﺔﻳﺎﻐﻠﻟ ﻱﺮﺳ ﺮﻳﺮﻘﺗ.doc\n\n\nThe document, whose name translates to “A Highly Classifed Report” downloads a FinFisher sample from\n\n**http://workingulf.net/DFServ.exe.**\n\n\n**SHA256:  e2ecf89a49c125e0b4292645a41b5e97c0f7bf15d418faeac0d592205f083119**\n\n**Filename: DFServ.exe**\n\n\nThe sample communicates with 50.31.252.xxx and 95.170.82.xxx, which are proxies for 62.114.252.xxx, the FinFisher Master\n\nwe associated with Egypt’s TRD. The domain workingulf.net appears to be connected to the TRD, because it is linked to\n\na cluster of other domains, several of which were used to distribute TRD FinFisher samples.\n\nWe developed a fingerprint for the exploit, based on the presence of a 1.1MB binary embedded in the Word Document.\n\nA week later, we identified another instance of this same exploit (the binary was the same).\n\n\n**SHA256:  d759dcbebee18a65fda434ba1da5d348c16d9d3775fe1652a1dacf983ffc93b8**\n\n**Filename:** ﺕﺍﺪﺠﺘﺴﻤﻟﺍ.doc\n\n\nThis instance downloaded spyware from http://wp.piedslibres.com/wp/wp-includes/js/Next.scr, which appeared to be a\n\nhacked WordPress site.\n\n\n**SHA256:  08b32da8995ae094bfb703d7d975c3816cf04c075c32281e51158164d76cd655**\n\n**Filename: Next.scr**\n\n\nNext.scr is a bespoke malware that exfiltrates system information and files via email. The malware logs into an email\n\naccount on the C&C server via SMTP, and sends mail to another account on the same server. We have seen C&Cs\n\nincluding: pal4u.net, pal2me.net, and shop8d.net. All of the domains have similar registrant information, indicating the\n\nwork of a single group.\n\nThe group appears to be based in Palestine. The use of a shared exploit suggests some link between the TRD and this\n\ngroup.\n\n**FinFly Web in the Wild**\n\nWe traced workingulf.net, to a number of other domain names, including news-youm7.com (see Figure 10 below).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10: Domain names and IP addresses that we believe are associated with Egypt’s TRD. We redact only live**\n\n**domains and IP addresses, and show full details for inactive ones.**\n\nWe found a FinFly Web sample at http://videos.news-youm7.com/youm7/videos/5671264.html. FinFly Web is a FinFisher\n\nproduct that allows customers to create a website to infect targets with spyware. We identified the sample as FinFly Web\n\ngiven substantial similarity with leaked FinFly Web code.[84]\n\n**Figure 11: The FinFly Web page, asking users to install Adobe Reader XI. The download link points to a FinFisher spyware**\n\n**sample.**\n\nThe FinFly Web page appears to have a number of deficiencies. The attacker appears to have copied a page from the\n\n\n-----\n\nresources to the attack site, nor changed the relative paths to point to the legitimate site, the attack page looks\n\nmalformatted. The attacker made the same mistake with the news ticker IFRAME, resulting in the “Not Found” message\n\nin the background. Also, the attacker entitled the page “Video: Islamic State Enters Egypt,” but created a popup to\n\ninstall Adobe Reader, which is Adobe’s product for viewing PDF files. It is likely that the attacker instead wanted to\n\ncreate a popup to install Adobe Flash, a plugin for viewing web videos. Additionally, the download link points to a .rar\n\nfile,[85] which is suspicious as Adobe does not distribute its products in .rar files. Finally, the .exe inside the .rar file is not\n\nmelded with the Adobe Reader setup program, so a victim who executes the file may become suspicious when no\n\nAdobe setup program runs.\n\n## Italy: Shift from Hacking Team to FinFisher?\n\nWe identified one IP address in Italy (2.228.65.xxx) which served as a FinFisher server from 2014 to present. Earlier in 2014,\n\nand before our publication of our report on Hacking Team, the same IP address instead matched our fingerprint for\n\nHacking Team spyware servers. This might indicate an Italian government agency switching from Hacking Team to\n\nFinFisher.\n\n## Oman: Eagle Eye Digital Solutions LLC\n\nWe found a FinFisher server running on IP address 37.139.27.xxx, which is pointed to by two subdomains of to70.org, a\n\ndomain name associated with an Omani company called “Eagle Eye Digital Solutions LLC” through historical WHOIS.\n\nThe domain is currently registered to “Omantel,” the largest telecom in Oman. Eagle Eye Digital Solutions LLC was\n\nfounded by, and is run by, Warith Al-Maawali.[86] Leaked emails describe Warith as part of Oman’s Ministry of Interior, as\n\nwell as a reseller of FinFisher products.[87] Other sites apparently run by Eagle Eye include a major Omani online forum,\n\n“oman0.net.” Eagle Eye founder Warith Al Maawali says the forum is “one of the most active sites with the largest user\nbase in Oman.”\n\nAn archived version of Eagle Eye’s website on the Wayback Machine showed Elaman GmbH as one of their partners,\n\nand “Security Organizations” as their clients. Elaman is known to be a reseller of FinFisher products.[88]\n\n**Figure 12: Old version of Eagle Eye’s website showing FinFisher reseller Elaman as a partner, and “Security**\n\n**Organizations” as among the firm’s clients.**\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn this report we provided the first update on Citizen Lab’s previous FinFisher scanning work since a widely discussed 2014\n\nhack of FinFisher. Despite the disclosure of sensitive customer data in that hack,[89] and the potential customer concerns\n\nthis might cause, our latest scans have detected FinFisher servers in more countries than any previous round of scanning.\n\nFinFisher is still being used by a number of previously identified government clients, including Ethiopia, which is the\n\ndefendant in an ongoing lawsuit over previous FinFisher use.[90] We have also identified newly identified suspected\n\ncustomers, including: Angola, Egypt, Gabon, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Saudi\n\nArabia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, and Venezuela.\n\nWhile we may not be detecting all FinFisher installations this report’s methods improved on both our ability to detect\n\n\n-----\n\nwe identify government users, but redact certain details about live infrastructure (like removing the last octet of IP\n\naddresses), whose disclosure might interfere with legitimately sanctioned activities.\n\n## The Global Intrusion Software Market: Difficult to Study, Tricky to Regulate\n\nThe market for intrusion software like FinFisher is challenging to track because the key players, from government\n\ncustomers to software developers, have a strong interest in keeping transactions private. However, several years of\n\nresearch, reporting, and revelations have made it clear that a growing list of countries have acquired, or are seeking\n\nthese tools.\n\nAs customer lists grow, so should concern over the documented abuse potential of intrusion software. Some governments\n\nclearly believe that it can be used, with proper oversight, in the service of legitimate criminal investigations and\n\nintelligence gathering. However, there are also well documented cases in which government customers have abused\n\nintrusion software to compromise political opponents within their borders, and overseas.\n\nThe current market seems to bypass some historic limits on the spread of advanced technical intrusion capabilities. Lack\n\nof a strong Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, or absence of long term investment in\n\nresearch and development pipelines, are no longer impediments to obtaining computer exploitation and intrusion\n\ncapabilities. These tools are now available for purchase by any government. Certainly, lack of development in STEM\n\nshould not preclude a country from having access to sophisticated investigative tools. Indeed, an under-resourced state\n\nis likely to face security challenges that are just as serious as a more developed one.\n\nHowever, it can be difficult even for democratic governments with a strong rule of law to oversee secret investigative\n\ncapabilities like intrusion software. These tools are likely to be acquired and used by divisions that are professionally\n\ndiscreet in their budgeting and information sharing. The information they generate may also have its origins deliberately\n\ndisguised before being shared with other departments or agencies. Intrusion software presents a challenge for\n\naccountability in any country, and the oversight authorities in under-resourced countries facing domestic or international\n\nsecurity threats may be particularly ill-equipped in expertise and political clout, to identify or act on signs of misuse.\n\nPrevious research has shown that FinFisher has been used to target regime opponents in several cases. Notably, FinFisher\n\nhas been used to hack Ethiopian and Bahraini democracy activists and opposition political figures. Meanwhile, research\n\nand revelations about Hacking Team’s Remote Control System (RCS), a competitor product, have also made it clear\n\nthat some government customers used these tools to target their political opponents, rather than security threats to their\n\ncitizens.\n\nDespite the well documented potential for abuse, the companies who develop and market these capabilities are\n\nreluctant and ill-equipped to conduct rigorous due diligence about potential customers, as recent revelations about\n\nHacking Team have made clear.\n\nThe Wassenaar Arrangement, which regulates the export of weapons, as well as “dual use” technologies, was\n\namended in 2013 to include items related to intrusion software, like FinFisher and Hacking Team’s RCS. Now, as\n\nparticipants like the European Union have undertaken their own implementations (or are still developing theirs as in the\n\ncase of the United States), it remains to be seen whether or not this will lead to greater transparency and control, and\n\nwhat impact, if any, it will have on abusive surveillance.\n\nWe hope that continued evidence-based research of this sort will contribute to greater overall transparency about this\n\nmarket, and provide much-needed points of reference for policy making and tracking the impact of regulatory efforts.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to Citizen Lab colleagues Morgan Marquis-Boire and Claudio Guarnieri, as well as Ron Deibert and\n\nMasashi Crete-Nishihata.
