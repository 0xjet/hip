    "plain_text": "# Waterbug: Espionage Group Rolls Out Brand-New Toolset in Attacks Against Governments\n\n**[symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments)**\n\nThe Waterbug espionage group (aka Turla) has continued to attack governments and\ninternational organizations over the past eighteen months in a series of campaigns that\nhave featured a rapidly evolving toolset and, in one notable instance, the apparent\nhijacking of another espionage group’s infrastructure.\n\n## Three waves of attacks\n\nRecent Waterbug activity can be divided into three distinct campaigns, characterized by\ndiffering toolsets. One campaign involved a new and previously unseen backdoor called\n[Neptun (Backdoor.Whisperer). Neptun is installed on Microsoft Exchange servers and is](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2019-052708-1556-99)\ndesigned to passively listen for commands from the attackers. This passive listening\ncapability makes the malware more difficult to detect. Neptun is also able to download\nadditional tools, upload stolen files, and execute shell commands. One attack during this\ncampaign involved the use of infrastructure belonging to another espionage group\nknown as Crambus (aka OilRig, APT34).\n\nA second campaign used Meterpreter, a publicly available backdoor along with two\ncustom loaders, a custom backdoor called photobased.dll, and a custom Remote\nProcedure Call (RPC) backdoor. Waterbug has been using Meterpreter since at least\nearly 2018 and, in this campaign, used a modified version of Meterpreter, which was\nencoded and given a .wav extension in order to disguise its true purpose.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third campaign deployed a different custom RPC backdoor to that used in the\nsecond campaign. This backdoor used code derived from the publicly available\nPowerShellRunner tool to execute PowerShell scripts without using powershell.exe. This\ntool is designed to bypass detection aimed at identifying malicious PowerShell usage.\nPrior to execution, the PowerShell scripts were stored Base64-encoded in the registry.\nThis was probably done to avoid them being written to the file system.\n\nFigure 1. Waterbug group rolls out fresh toolset in three new campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\n## Retooled\n\nWaterbug’s most recent campaigns have involved a swath of new tools including custom\nmalware, modified versions of publicly available hacking tools, and legitimate\nadministration tools. The group has also followed the current shift towards “living off the\nland,” making use of PowerShell scripts and PsExec, a Microsoft Sysinternals tool used\nfor executing processes on other systems.\n\nAside from new tools already mentioned above, Waterbug has also deployed:\n\nA new custom dropper typically used to install Neptun as a service.\nA custom hacking tool that combines four leaked Equation Group tools\n(EternalBlue, EternalRomance, DoublePulsar, SMBTouch) into a single\nexecutable.\nA USB data collecting tool that checks for a connected USB drive and steals\ncertain file types, encrypting them into a RAR file. It then uses WebDAV to upload\nto a Box cloud drive.\nVisual Basic scripts that perform system reconnaissance after initial infection and\nthen send information to Waterbug command and control (C&C) servers.\nPowerShell scripts that perform system reconnaissance and credential theft from\nWindows Credential Manager and then send this information back to Waterbug\nC&Cs.\nPublicly available tools such as IntelliAdmin to execute RPC commands, SScan\nand NBTScan for network reconnaissance, PsExec for execution and lateral\n[movement, and Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz) for credential theft, and Certutil.exe](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2012-042615-3731-99)\nto download and decode remote files. These tools were identified being\ndownloaded via Waterbug tools or infrastructure.\n\n## Victims\n\nThese three recent Waterbug campaigns have seen the group compromise governments\nand international organizations across the globe in addition to targets in the IT and\neducation sectors. Since early 2018, Waterbug has attacked 13 organizations across 10\ndifferent countries:\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a Latin American country\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a Middle Eastern country\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a European country\nThe Ministry of the Interior of a South Asian country\nTwo unidentified government organizations in a Middle Eastern country\nOne unidentified government organization in a Southeast Asian country\nA government office of a South Asian country based in another country\nAn information and communications technology organization in a Middle Eastern\ncountry\nTwo information and communications technology organizations in two European\ncountries\n\n\n-----\n\nAn information and communications technology organization in a South Asian\ncountry\nA multinational organization in a Middle Eastern country\nAn educational institution in a South Asian country\n\n## Hijacked infrastructure\n\nOne of the most interesting things to occur during one of Waterbug’s recent campaigns\nwas that during an attack against one target in the Middle East, Waterbug appeared to\nhijack infrastructure from the Crambus espionage group and used it to deliver malware\non to the victim’s network. Press reports have linked Crambus and Waterbug to different\nnation states. While it is possible that the two groups may have been collaborating,\nSymantec has found no further evidence to support this. In all likelihood, Waterbug’s use\nof Crambus infrastructure appears to have been a hostile takeover. Curiously though,\nWaterbug also compromised other computers on the victim’s network using its own\ninfrastructure.\n\nDuring this attack, a customized variant of the publicly available hacking tool Mimikatz\nwas downloaded to a computer on the victim’s network from known Crambus-controlled\nnetwork infrastructure. Mimikatz was downloaded via the Powruner tool and the Poison\nFrog control panel. Both the infrastructure and the Powruner tool have been publicly tied\nto Crambus by a number of vendors. Both were also mentioned in recent leaks of\ndocuments tied to Crambus.\n\nSymantec believes that the variant of Mimikatz used in this attack is unique to Waterbug.\nIt was heavily modified, with almost all original code stripped out aside from its\nsekurlsa::logonpasswords credential stealing feature. Waterbug has frequently made\nextensive modifications to publicly available tools, something Crambus is not well known\nfor.\n\nThe variant of Mimikatz used was packed with a custom packing routine that has not\nbeen seen before in any non-Waterbug malware. Waterbug used this same packer on a\nsecond custom variant of Mimikatz and on a dropper for the group’s custom Neuron\n[service (Trojan.Cadanif). Its use in the dropper leads us to conclude that this custom](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2017-032415-1608-99)\npacker is exclusively used by Waterbug. Additionally, this version of Mimikatz was\ncompiled using Visual Studio and the publicly available bzip2 library which, although not\nunique, has been used by other Waterbug tools previously.\n\nAside from the attack involving Crambus infrastructure, this sample of Mimikatz has only\nbeen seen used in one other attack, against an education target in the UK in 2017. On\nthat occasion, Mimikatz was dropped by a known Waterbug tool.\n\nIn the case of the attack against the Middle Eastern target, Crambus was the first group\nto compromise the victim’s network, with the earliest evidence of activity dating to\nNovember 2017. The first observed evidence of Waterbug activity came on January 11,\n2018, when a Waterbug-linked tool (a task scheduler named msfgi.exe) was dropped on\nto a computer on the victim’s network. The next day, January 12, the aforementioned\nvariant of Mimikatz was downloaded to the same computer from a known Crambus C&C\nserver Two further computers on the victim’s network were compromised with Waterbug\n\n\n-----\n\ntools on January 12, but there is no evidence that Crambus infrastructure was used in\nthese attacks. While one of these computers had been previously compromised by\nCrambus, the other showed no signs of Crambus intrusion.\n\nFigure 2. Waterbug likely compromised the C&C network infrastructure of Crambus\n\nWaterbug’s intrusions on the victim’s network continued for much of 2018. On\nSeptember 5, 2018, a similar Mimikatz variant was dropped by Waterbug’s Neptun\nbackdoor onto another computer on the network. At around the same time, other\nWaterbug malware was seen on the victim’s network which communicated with known\nWaterbug C&C servers.\n\nFinally, the issue was clouded further by the appearance of a legitimate systems\nadministration tool called IntelliAdmin on the victim’s network. This tool is known to have\nbeen used by Crambus and was mentioned in the leak of Crambus documents.\nHowever, in this case, IntelliAdmin was dropped by custom Waterbug backdoors,\nincluding the newly identified Neptun backdoor, on computers that had not been affected\nby the Crambus compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe incident leaves many unanswered questions, chiefly relating to Waterbug s motive\nfor using Crambus infrastructure. There are several possibilities:\n\n1. False flag: Waterbug [does have a track record of using false flag tactics to throw](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2017/10/20114955/Bartholomew-GuerreroSaade-VB2016.pdf)\n\ninvestigators off the scent. However, if this was a genuine attempt at a false flag\noperation, it begs the question of why it also used its own infrastructure to\ncommunicate with other machines on the victim’s network, in addition to using\ntools that could be traced back to Waterbug.\n2. Means of intrusion: It is possible that Waterbug wanted to compromise the target\n\norganization, found out that Crambus had already compromised its network, and\nhijacked Crambus’s own infrastructure as a means of gaining access. Symantec\ndid not observe the initial access point and the close timeframe between Waterbug\nobserved activity on the victim’s network and its observed use of Crambus\ninfrastructure suggests that Waterbug may have used the Crambus infrastructure\nas an initial access point.\n3. Mimikatz variant belonged to Crambus: There is a possibility that the version of\n\nMimikatz downloaded by the Crambus infrastructure was actually developed by\nCrambus. However, the compilation technique and the fact that the only other\noccasion it was used was linked to Waterbug works against this hypothesis. The\nfact that Waterbug also appeared on the victim’s network around the same time\nthis version of Mimikatz was downloaded would make it an unlikely coincidence if\nthe tool did belong to Crambus.\n4. Opportunistic sowing of confusion: If a false flag operation wasn’t planned from\n\nthe start, it is possible that Waterbug discovered the Crambus intrusion while\npreparing its attack and opportunistically used it in the hopes of sowing some\nconfusion in the mind of the victim or investigators. Based on recent leaks of\nCrambus internal documents, its Poison Frog control panel is known to be\nvulnerable to compromise, meaning it may have been a relatively trivial diversion\non the part of Waterbug to hijack Crambus’s infrastructure. A compromise\nconducted by one threat actor group through another's infrastructure, or fourth\nparty collections, has been previously discussed in a 2017 white paper by\nKaspersky researchers.\n\n## Further campaigns\n\nWaterbug has also mounted two other campaigns over the past year, each of which was\ncharacterized by separate tools. These campaigns were wide ranging, hitting targets in\nEurope, Latin America, and South Asia.\n\nIn the first campaign, Waterbug used two versions of a custom loader named javavs.exe\n(64-bit) and javaws.exe (32-bit), to load a custom backdoor named PhotoBased.dll and\nrun the export function GetUpdate on the victim’s computers. The backdoor will modify\nthe registry for the Windows Media Player to store its C&C configuration. It also\nreconfigures the Microsoft Sysinternals registry to prevent pop-ups when running the\nPsExec tool. The backdoor has the capability to download and upload files, execute\nshell commands, and update its configuration.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe javaws.exe loader is also used to run another loader named tasklistw.exe. This is\nused by the attackers to decode and execute a series of malicious executables that\ndownload Meterpreter to the infected computer.\n\nThe attackers also install another backdoor that runs a command shell via the named\npipe cmd_pipe. Both backdoors allow the attackers to execute various commands that\nprovide full control of the victim’s system. Waterbug also used an older version of\nPowerShell, likely to avoid logging.\n\nIn the second campaign, Waterbug used an entirely different backdoor, named\nsecurlsa.chk. This backdoor can receive commands through the RPC protocol. Its\ncapabilities include:\n\nExecuting commands through cmd.exe with the output redirected into a temporary\nfile\nReading the command output contained in the temporary file\nReading or writing arbitrary files\n\nThis RPC backdoor also included source code derived from the tool PowerShellRunner,\nwhich allows a user to run PowerShell scripts without executing powershell.exe,\ntherefore the user may bypass detection aimed at identifying malicious PowerShell\nusage.\n\nWhile both campaigns involved distinct tools during the initial compromise phase, there\nwere also many similarities. Both were characterized by the use of a combination of\ncustom malware and publicly available tools. Also, during both campaigns Waterbug\nexecuted multiple payloads nearly simultaneously, most likely to ensure overlapping\naccess to the network if defenders found and removed one of the backdoors.\n\nWaterbug took several steps to avoid detection. It named Meterpreter as a WAV file type,\nprobably in the hope that this would not raise suspicions. The group also used GitHub as\na repository for tools that it downloaded post-compromise. This too was likely motivated\nby a desire to evade detection, since GitHub is a widely trusted website. It used\nCertutil.exe to download files from the repository, which is an application whitelist bypass\ntechnique for remote downloads.\n\nIn one of these campaigns, Waterbug used a USB stealer that scans removable storage\ndevices to identify and collect files of interest. It then packages stolen files into a\npassword-protected RAR archive. The malware then uses WebDAV to upload the RAR\narchive to a Box account.\n\n## Unanswered questions\n\nThis is the first time Symantec has observed one targeted attack group seemingly hijack\nand use the infrastructure of another group. However, it is still difficult to ascertain the\nmotive behind the attack. Whether Waterbug simply seized the opportunity to create\nconfusion about the attack or whether there was more strategic thinking involved\nremains unknown.\n\n\n-----\n\nWaterbug s ever-changing toolset demonstrates a high degree of adaptability by a group\ndetermined to avoid detection by staying one step ahead of its targets. Frequent\nretooling and a penchant for flirting with false flag tactics have made this group one of\nthe most challenging adversaries on the targeted attack landscape.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\nSymantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these\nattacks:\n\n**File-based protection**\n\n[Backdoor.Whisperer](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2019-052708-1556-99)\n[Hacktool.Mimikatz](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2012-042615-3731-99)\n\n**Threat Intelligence**\n\nThe [DeepSight Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) team co-authored](https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/deepsight-intelligence/adversary)\nthis blog and its customers have received intelligence with additional details about these\ncampaigns, the characteristics of the Waterbug (aka Turla) cyber espionage group, and\nmethods of detecting and thwarting activities of this adversary.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Campaign 1**\n\n24fe571f3066045497b1d8316040734c81c71dcb1747f1d7026cda810085fad7\n66893ab83a7d4e298720da28cd2ea4a860371ae938cdd86035ce920b933c9d85\n7942eee31d8cb1c8853ce679f686ee104d359023645c7cb808361df791337145\n7bd3ff9ba43020688acaa05ce4e0a8f92f53d9d9264053255a5937cbd7a5465e\na1d9f5b9ca7dda631f30bd1220026fc8c3a554d61db09b5030b8eb9d33dc9356\nc63f425d96365d906604b1529611eefe5524432545a7977ebe2ac8c79f90ad7e\ncb7ecd6805b12fdb442faa8f61f6a2ee69b8731326a646ba1e8886f0a5dd61e0\ndb9902cb42f6dc9f1c02bd3413ab3969d345eb6b0660bd8356a0c328f1ec0c07\ne0c316b1d9d3d9ec5a97707a0f954240bbc9748b969f9792c472d0a40ab919ea\ne0c316b1d9d3d9ec5a97707a0f954240bbc9748b969f9792c472d0a40ab919ea\n5da013a64fd60913b5cb94e85fc64624d0339e09d7dce25ab9be082f0ca5e38b\nc8a864039f4d271f4ab6f440cbc14dffd8c459aa3af86f79f0619a13f67c309f\n588fd8eba6e62c28a584781deefe512659f6665daeb8c85100e0bf7a472ad825\ncda5b20712e59a6ba486e55a6ab428b9c45eb8d419e25f555ae4a7b537fc2f26\n694d9c8a1f0563c08e0d3ab7d402ffbf5a0fa11340c50fba84d709384ccef021\ncaaed70daa7832952ae93f41131e74dcb6724bb8669d18f28fbed4aa983fdc0c\n493eee2c55810201557ef0e5d134ca0d9569f25ae732df139bb0cb3d1478257f\n0e9c3779fece579bed30cb0b7093a962d5de84faa2d72e4230218d4a75ee82bc\n5bbeed53aaa40605aabbfde31cbfafd5b92b52720e05fa6469ce1502169177a0\nd153e4b8a11e2537ecf99aec020da5fad1e34bbe79f617a3ee5bc0b07c3abdca\n\nvision2030.tk\nvision2030.cf\n\n\n-----\n\ndubaiexpo2020.cf\nmicrosoft.updatemeltdownkb7234.com\ncodewizard.ml\nupdatenodes.site\n\nhttps://vision2030.tk/static/googleupdate.txt\nhttps://dubaiexpo2020.cf/counter.aspx\nhttps://microsoft.updatemeltdownkb7234.com/windows/update.aspx\nhttps://codewizard.ml/productivity/update.aspx\n\n**Campaign 2**\n\n10d1bfd5e8e1c8fa75756a9f1787c3179da9ab338a476f1991d9e300c6186575\n3fbec774da2a145974a917aeb64fc389345feb3e581b46d018077e28333601a5\n52169d7cdd01098efdde4da3fb22991aaa53ab9e02db5d80114a639bf65bce39\n56098ed50e25f28d466be78a36c643d19fedc563a2250ae86a6d936318b7f57e\n595a54f0bbf297041ce259461ae8a12f37fb29e5180705eafb3668b4a491cecc\n5dc26566b4dec09865ea89edd4f9765ef93e789870ed4c25fcc4ebad19780b40\n6b60b27385738cac65584cf7d486913ff997c66d97a94e1dde158c9cd03a4206\n846a95a26aac843d1fcec51b2b730e9e8f40032ee4f769035966169d68d144c4\nc4a6db706c59a5a0a29368f80731904cc98a26e081088e5793764a381708b1ea\nd0b99353cb6500bb18f6e83fe9eed9ce16e5a8d5b940181e5eafd8d82f328a59\nee7f92a158940a0b5d9b902eb0ed9a655c7e6ba312473b1e2c9ef80d58baa6dd\n\n94.249.192.182\n\n**Campaign 3**\n\n454e6c3d8c1c982cd301b4dd82ec3431935c28adea78ed8160d731ab0bed6cb7\n4ecb587ee9b872747408c00de5619cb6b973e7d39ce4937655c5d1a07b7500fc\n528e2567e24809d2d0ba96fd70e41d71c18152f0f0c4f29ced129ed7701fa42a\n6928e212874686d29c85eac72553ccdf89aacb475c61fa3c086c796df3ab5940\nb22bbda8f504f8cced886f566f954cc245f3e7c205e57139610bbbff0412611c\nd52b08dd27f2649bad764152dfc2a7dea0c8894ce7c20b51482f4a4cf3e1e792\ne7e41b3d7c0ee2d0939bb56d797eaf2dec44516ba54b8bf1477414b03d4d6e48\nec3da59d4a35941f6951639d81d1c5ff73057d9cf779428d80474e9656db427c\nfbefe503d78104e04625a511528584327ac129c3436e4df09f3d167e438a1862\n\nmarkham-travel.com\nzebra.wikaba.com\n185.141.62.32\n212.21.52.110\n\n\n-----",
