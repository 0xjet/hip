We have a client\n\nrecord of a blocked CCLeaner.exe detection on June 25th �agged as\n\nW32.Hacktool.Rpdpatch\n\nWe were lucky that I did not whitelist the threat as safe becasue at the time Webroot had a\n\nproblem with mis-categorizing legitimate software as malware. This threat was found on\n\na server and since we regularly used CCleaner on desktops but not servers, I was\n\nsuspicious of it and contacted Webroot support about it as well.
