With every rise of the Bitcoin value, more and more people\nare drawn into the game of selling, mining, and exchanging digital assets. However, the playground is tempting for\nboth honest people and malicious ones. Malware focusing on stealing cryptocurrency has become routine.\n\nOne specific malware family that emphasizes how easy it can be to lose your cryptocurrency coins is called\nHackBoss. It’s a simple yet very effective malware that has possibly stolen over `$560,000 USD` from the victims so\nfar. And it’s mainly being spread via Telegram.\n\nMalware designed to steal cryptocurrencies fall into one of three main categories:\n```\n   Password stealers : malware focusing on stealing cryptocurrency wallets or files with passwords.\n   Coinminers : malware that uses the victim’s machine’s computational power for mining cryptocurrencies.\n   Keyloggers : malware that logs keystrokes to record passwords or seed phrases.\n\n```\nThese three categories of cryptocurrency-related malware combined were the third most common type of malware\nseen in the wild over the past year.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The most_\n\n_common malware types seen in the wild since 03/2020 to 03/2021_\nPassword stealers have included a focus on cryptocurrencies for a long time now. It’s very easy to add a functionality\nfor stealing cryptocurrency wallets to a password stealer, which means it’s uncommon these days to find a password\nstealer that doesn’t look for cryptocurrency wallets. Because of this, people should take extra care of their passwords,\nwallets, and digital assets.\n\nThe graph below shows the progress of the total number of hits upon our user base per month from March 2020\nthrough March 2021 for cryptocurrency-stealing malware.\n\n_The total number of hits_\n\n_since 03/2020 to 03/2021_\nAnd the split between the three malware categories during the same timeframe is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Prevalence of_\n\n_cryptocurrency stealing malware types since 03/2020 to 03/2021_\n\n## HackBoss\n\nHackBoss is a simple cryptocurrency-stealing malware, but its monetary gain is significant. The most interesting\naspect of this malware is the way it is delivered to the victims. HackBoss’ authors own a Telegram channel which they\nuse as the main source for spreading the malware. A Telegram channel is a tool for broadcasting public messages to\na large audience. Anyone can subscribe to a specific channel and get a notification on their phone with each new\npost. Also, only admins of the channel have the right to post and each post shows the name of the channel as a\npublisher, not a name of a person.\n\nAuthors of the HackBoss malware own a channel called Hack Boss (hence the name of the malware family itself)\nwhich is promoted as a channel to provide “The best software for hackers (hack bank / dating / bitcoin)”. The software\nthat is supposed to be published on this channel varies from bank and social site crackers to various cryptocurrency\nwallet and private key crackers or gift card code generators. However, although each promoted application is\npromised to be some hacking or cracking application, it never is. The truth is quite different — each published post\ncontains only a cryptocurrency-stealing malware concealed as a hacking or cracking application. What is more, no\napplication posted on this channel delivers promised behavior: all of them are fake.\n\nThe Hack Boss channel was created on November 26, 2018, and has over 2,500 subscribers so far. Authors publish\nan average of 7 posts per month and each post is viewed approximately 1,000 times.\n\n\n-----\n\n_From telemetr.io_\n\nPosts on the Hack Boss channel promoting a fake cracking or hacking application usually contain a link to encrypted\nor anonymous file storage from which the application can be downloaded. The post also contains a bogus description\nof the application’s supposed functionality and screenshots of the application’s UI. It sometimes also contains a link to\na YouTube channel at `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1IEdha7riKwVCfPk (the channel has been taken`\ndown at the time of publishing) called `Bank God with a promo video.`\n\nAfter downloading the application as a .zip file, you can run the .exe file inside and a simple UI will be displayed.\n\n\n-----\n\n_UI examples_\nThe application itself does not have any of the promised behavior. It is basically just the prompted UI which can open\na file directory or popup a window, but its main and malicious functionality is triggered by a victim clicking on any\nbutton in the UI. After that, a malicious payload is decrypted and executed in the `AppData\\Local`\nor AppData\\Roaming directory. It can also be set to run at startup by setting up the value in the\n```\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run registry key or a task can be\n\n```\nscheduled to run the malicious payload repeatedly every minute.\n\nThe functionality of the malicious payload is fairly simple. It regularly checks the clipboard content for a format of a\ncryptocurrency wallet and, if a wallet address is present there, it replaces it with one of its own wallets. The malicious\npayload keeps running on the victim’s computer even after the application’s UI is closed. If the malicious process is\nterminated — for example via the Task manager — it can then get triggered again on startup or by the scheduled task\nin the next minute.\n\nThough the malware itself is not sophisticated, it can be very effective. Many people own some cryptocurrency coins\nnowadays and send coins via computer applications. Running a fake application which spawns a malicious process\nthat continuously checks and exchanges the clipboard content can lead to a significant monetary loss. Eventually the\nvictim might start a valid cryptocurrency application on his/her computer and will want to send real cryptocurrency\ncoins to someone else. Copying the receiving cryptocurrency wallet address will alert the already running malicious\nprocess, which will exchange the wallet address for one of its own. A slightly less observant user may then hit the pay\nbutton without noticing that the copied wallet address has changed in the meantime and lose his/her coins.\n\nA malicious actor just needs to be a little busy bee while promoting simple fake applications and the monetary gain\ncan be considerable. And that is what the HackBoss malware creators are consistently doing. The Hack Boss\nTelegram channel is not the only place where they promote their fake application. They also keep a blog at\n```\ncranhan.blogspot[.]com containing only posts promoting their fake applications, have YouTube channels with\n\n```\npromo videos, and post advertisements on public forums and discussions.\n\nStatistics about the spread of this malware upon our user base since November 2018 can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Number of hits since November 2018_\n\n## Monetary gain of HackBoss\n\nWe have collected a list of more than 100 cryptocurrency wallet addresses belonging to HackBoss authors and to\nwhich the HackBoss malware exchanges the wallet address present in the clipboard. The full list can be found in\n[appendix_files. The wallet addresses format that HackBoss checks for are from](https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/HackBoss/appendix_files) `Bitcoin,` `Ethereum,` `Dogecoin,`\n\n`Litecoin, and` `Monero` cryptocurrencies and the majority of those wallets are Bitcoin wallets. We have checked\nthe received funds on those wallets since November 2018 and got the following amounts.\n\n**Cryptocurrency** **Received amount** **Amount in USD***\n\nBitcoin 8.43237903 BTC ~ $543,409.4883 USD\n\nEthereum 6.893571509 ETH ~ $16,430.82769 USD\n\nLitecoin 1.12499004 LTC ~ $313.1859772 USD\n\nDogecoin 2,299.38 DOGE ~ $297.5811608 USD\n\n_*At the time of publishing_\nWhich gives the total received amount of ~ `$560,451.0831USD at the time of publishing. However, some of the`\naddresses were reported many times not only as cryptocurrency-stealing malware but also as a scam, cheating\nvictims into buying fake software. This makes the total received amount less accurate in the scope of the HackBoss\nmalware. However, we are still observing received funds of the same authors that deliver HackBoss.\n\n## Fake Bitcoin Sender – a HackBoss example\n\nWe have chosen one sample of the HackBoss malware from the Hack Boss Telegram channel to give a technical\noverview of the malicious core functionality. The chosen promoted fake application is called a `Fake Bitcoin`\n```\nSender .\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Fake Bitcoin Sender\n\nApart from receiving and spending real cryptocurrency coins, there is also a possibility for playing with fake coins.\nThere are a lot of applications for generating fake coins and sending them. Transactions created like that are never\nconfirmed and disappear in 1-3 days. These fake sender applications are quite popular since they allow users to play\nwith cryptocurrencies without the need to pay, prank friends, or to use it for testing purposes. However, such fun can\nbring unexpected and stealthy danger.\n\nThe Fake Bitcoin Sender was promoted on the Hack Boss Telegram channel as well as on their blog in December\n2020. It has also been advertised on multiple websites and public forums in the comment and discussion sections,\nmostly on the 18th and the 19th of December, 2020.\n\n_Advertisement of Fake Bitcoin Sender application on the funbox.com.au website_\n\nThe comments have been posted by user names such as `bittopInisp,` `bittopencum,` `bittoplaway,`\n\n`bittopPIP`, `bittopkek` and `bittopmeert .`\n\nThe post points to an encrypted cloud storage mega.nz from which the Fake Bitcoin Sender can be downloaded. After\nvisiting the url `https[:]//mega[.]nz/file/Mo5EnYxD#pQoaU0w2JqNVdqICrGuqaDuivlAbRfzjEt-hsnbT_jk a .zip`\npackage `BitcoApp.zip containing the malicious application can be downloaded.`\n\nAnother means for getting the Fake Bitcoin Sender application is by visiting the `www.progs[.]su (registered on the`\n10th of October, 2020). This page led to the following download page:\n\n\n-----\n\nprogs[.]su\nScrolling down, we got to a text promising to get an application for sending fake Bitcoins:\n\nAfter clicking the download button, we were redirected to the same mega.mz cloud storage as above.\n\n**Not so promising reality**\n\n\nprogs[.]su\n\n\nAfter unpacking the downloaded `BitcoApp.zip we obtained an executable` `BitcoApp.exe . Running it displayed`\nthe following UI:\n\n\n-----\n\nFake Bitcoin Sender UI\n\nIf we fill in the information and hit Send, the application pops up a `Result message after a few seconds.`\n\nResult message\n\nUnfortunately, that is about it for the fun part. No fake transactions are created, though it has a hidden functionality of\na simple yet very real malware.\n\n**Malicious part**\n\nThe process `BitcoApp.exe is responsible for displaying the UI, popping up the` `Result message and also for`\nadditional malicious behavior. The malicious behavior consists of decrypting three payloads – `splwow.exe,`\n```\nDefenderUpdate.exe and Net.dll and saving them in the AppData\\Roaming directory.\n\n```\nSplwow.exe\n\nThis process contains the malicious core. `BitcoApp.exe creates a folder called` `System` in the\n```\nAppData\\Roaming directory and decrypts a splwow.exe payload there (list of the most common file names of the\n\n```\n[decrypted malicious payloads can be found in the file_names.txt). Then it schedules it to run every minute by](https://github.com/avast/ioc/blob/master/HackBoss/file_names.txt)\nexecuting the command:\n```\nschtasks.exe /create /sc MINUTE /mo 1 /tn \"splwow\" /tr “C:\\Users\\\n<user_name>\\AppData\\Roaming\\System\\splwow.exe\" /f\n\n```\nThe created `splwow.exe process can be then seen in the list of all running processes:`\n\nMalicious splwow.exe process seen in the list of running processes.\nThe main functionality of `splwow.exe is a continuous exchange of the content present in the clipboard.`\n\nThe code runs in multiple threads, each one checking for a different cryptocurrency wallet address format present in\nthe clipboard. Once found, it is then exchanged for one of hardcoded 3DES encrypted cryptocurrency wallets through\nthe `Clipborad.SetText() function.`\n\nThe core code can be seen below:\n\n\n-----\n\nCore code functionality\nDefenderUpdate.exe and Net.dll\n\n`BitcoApp.exe also creates a directory named` `Defender` in the `AppData\\Roaming folder and decrypts payloads`\n```\nDefenderUpdate.exe and Net.dll there.\n\n```\nTo achieve persistence it sets the `DefenderUpdate.exe to run at startup by setting up the value in the below`\nregistry key.\n\n```\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Defender\n\n```\n```\nDefenderUpdate.exe extracts and decrypts the same payload splwow.exe as did BitcoApp.exe in the\n\n```\n`System` folder and schedules the same task for the `splwow.exe to run every minute.` `Net.dll is a dll with`\nextracting and decrypting functionality that `DefenderUpdate.exe uses.`\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHackBoss is a simple cryptocurrency-stealing malware that has possibly managed to steal over `$560,000 USD`\nfrom victims since November 2018. Its authors have chosen a strategy of misusing public social sites such as\nTelegram, YouTube, and public forums for promotion of their malware disguised as various hacking or cracking\napplications. The main source of HackBoss’ spread is a Telegram channel called Hack Boss in which the authors\npublish posts promoting hacking or cracking applications that victims can download. Unfortunately, none of these\n\n\n-----\n\napplications deliver promised behavior and only infect the victim s computer with a cryptocurrency stealing malware.\nHackBoss running on a victim’s computer keeps checking for the content in the clipboard and if a wallet address\nformat is present there it exchanges it for one of its own wallets. Such behaviour can be easily overlooked by a less\nobservant victim and may lead to a significant monetary loss.\n\nIt is important to be attentive when dealing with cryptocurrency. Always double check the wallet address you are\nsending your assets to, use two-factor-authentication for accessing your digital wallets and, of course, install Avast,\nas it will protect you not only from malware such as HackBoss.\n\n## Indication of Compromise (IoC)\n\n[The full list of IoCs is available at
