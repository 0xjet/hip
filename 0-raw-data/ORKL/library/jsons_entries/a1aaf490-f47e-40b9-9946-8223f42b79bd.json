    "plain_text": "# Examining the Cring Ransomware Techniques\n\n**[trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/i/examining-the-cring-ransomware-techniques.html](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/i/examining-the-cring-ransomware-techniques.html)**\n\nSeptember 24, 2021\n\nIn this entry, we look at the techniques typically employed by the Cring ransomware, as well\nas the most affected regions and industries.\n\nBy: Warren Sto.Tomas September 24, 2021 Read time: ( words)\n\nContent added to Folio\n\nHere is a more detailed description of this chain:\n\n**Initial Access**\n\nThe Cring ransomware gains initial access either through unsecure or compromised RDP or\nvalid accounts.\n\nThe ransomware can also get into the system through certain vulnerability exploits.. The\n[abuse of the aforementioned Adobe ColdFusion flaw (CVE-2010-2861) to enter the system](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-2861)\nis a new development for the threat. In the past, Cring was also used to exploit a FortiGate\n[VPN server vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379).](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379)\n\n**Credential Access**\n\n\n-----\n\n[Threat actors behind Cring used weaponized tools in their attacks. One of these tools is](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021)\nMimikatz, which was used to steal account credentials of users who had previously logged\ninto the system.\n\n**Lateral Movement and Defense Evasion**\n\nLateral movement was done through Cobalt Strike. This tool was also used to distribute BAT\nfiles that will be used later for various purposes, including impairing the system’s defenses.\n\n**Command and Control and Execution**\n\nCobalt Strike was also used to continuously communicate with the main command-andcontrol (C&C) server.\n\nBAT files were used to download and execute the Cring ransomware on the other systems in\nthe compromised network. It also uses the Windows CertUtil program to help with the said\ndownload.\n\n**Impact**\n\nOnce Cringhas been executed in the system, it disables services and processes that might\nhinder the ransomware’s encryption routine. The threat will also delete backup files and\nfolders. This will make restoring the encrypted files difficult for the victim, thereby placing\nmore pressure on them to pay the ransom.\n\nThe ransomware will then proceed with its encryption routine and delete itself using a BAT\nfile.\n\n## Regions and industries with the Cring ransomware detections\n\nBased on our data, most of the Cring ransomware detections for attempted attacks were\nobserved in Europe and the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. There have also been\nincidents in the Latin American Region (LAR), Asia Pacific (APAC), and North America\n(NABU).\n\nThe affected countries in the said regions were Azerbaijan, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, Saudi\nArabia, the United States, and Turkey. With regard to industries, detections affected the\nfinance and transportation sectors. Indeed, ransomware has been consistently attacking\n[critical industries, as we discuss in our midyear report.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup/attacks-from-all-angles-2021-midyear-security-roundup)\n\n## How to protect systems from ransomware\n\nWith ransomware, prevention is one of the most potent forms of protection. A proactive\napproach such as patching vulnerabilities and monitoring systems for signs of unusual\nbehavior helps curb ransomware before it can cause any real damage to a system.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the larger scheme of things, coming up with ransomware defense plans will help\nenterprises know which steps to prioritize. Here are some best practices that follow the lead\nof frameworks set by the [Center of Internet Security (CIS)and the](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/) National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST):\n\n**Audit events and take inventory. Audit both event and incident logs to spot**\nsuspicious behavior.Take note of all assets and data. Identify authorized and\nunauthorized devices and programs.\n**Configure and monitor. Manage hardware and software configurations. Only grant**\nadministrative privileges when necessary.\n**Patch and update. Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and patching or virtual**\npatching for operating systems and programs. Update software and applications.\n**Protect systems and recover data. Administer data protection, backup, and recovery**\nmeasures. Implement multifactor authentication (MFA).\n**Secure and defend layers: Perform sandbox analysis to filter malicious**\nemails. Employ security solutions to all layers of the system such as email, endpoint,\nweb, and network.\n**Train and test. Conduct regular training and security skills assessment for employees.**\nPerform red-team exercises and penetration tests.\n\n## Trend Micro solutions\n\nOrganizations can benefit from multilayered protection (for layers such as endpoint, email,\nweb, and network) with security solutions that can detect malicious components and help\nmonitor concealed malicious behaviors in the system.\n\n[Trend Micro Vision One™ spots suspicious behaviors that might seem insignificant when](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\nobserved from only a single layer. [Trend Micro Apex One™ protects endpoint devices](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps.html)\nthrough automated threat detection and response against ransomware, fileless threats, and\nother advanced concerns.\n\n[Trend Micro Cloud One™ Workload Security defends systems against threats that exploit](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/cloud-one-workload-security.html)\nvulnerabilities. This is done through virtual patching, machine learning (ML), and harnessing\nthe latest in global threat intelligence.\n\n[Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/email-and-collaboration/email-inspector.html)\nadvanced analysis techniques to effectively block ransomware before it gets into the system,\nsince one of the ways ransomware spreads is through malicious emails.\n\n\n-----",
