Morphisec’s ability to collect rich forensic data from memory has provided unique visibility into multiple FIN7 campaigns that our researchers were proud to share with MITRE and the InfoSec community at large. FIN7 is a well-funded, financially motivated cybercrime group. Their advanced techniques and tactics were even emulated in the third round of the MITRE ATT&CK evaluations.\n\n This report presents an attack chain that was intercepted and prevented within a customer’s network in December 2020, then will focus on a component from a typical FIN7 attack chain – JSSLoader. Though JSSLoader is well known as a minimized .NET RAT, not many details have been publicly available with respect to various capabilities such as exfiltration, persistence, auto-update, malware downloading, and more. Furthermore, in the many occasions where JSSLoader is mentioned, there are few details on the complete attack chain. The following provides a never-before-seen technical analysis of this infamous group’s JSSLoader as part of an end-to-end attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n\n###### Below is an example of a typical phishing campaign that may lead to a FIN7 JSSLoader compromise as well as to other malwares such as Qbot; the traffic is then redirected through BlackTDS traffic distribution system. In this example, an email is sent from “Natural Health Sherpa” with an invoice to pay from Quickbooks.\n\n**Figure 1: A typical phishing campaign.**\n\n###### Clicking the invoice link leads to a private Sharepoint directory that stores an archive file containing a VBScript (later changed to WSF-Windows Script File).\n\n**Figure 2: The private Sharepoint directory.**\n\n\n-----\n\nShortly after this phishing campaign, “Natural Health Sherpa” posted this on social media.\n\n**Figure 3: Natural Health Sherpa’s message on social media.**\n\nThis VBScript downloads and executes the next stage’s VBScript in memory. This second stage was recently\nintroduced. The in-memory script downloads and writes a .NET module (JSSLoader) on disk, then executes the\nmodule through a scheduled task with a newly introduced timeout delay to bypass attack chain monitoring.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the early versions of the VB scripts have a strong resemblance to the ongoing QBOT\ncampaign that may lead to an Egregor compromise.\n\nThe JSSLoader is a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) with multiple capabilities that were introduced over time. These\nvarious capabilities are documented throughout this report. In the specific attack chain that was recently\nintercepted, the RAT typically executes a Takeout which is responsible for the reflective loading and execution of\na Carbanak.\n\nNot surprisingly, the C2 hosting provider is a company named FranTech Solutions, which has been used before\nby the FIN7 group.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### WSF & VBS\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the early VBScripts had a resemblance to the QBOT attacks seen earlier this\n[year – QBOT-VBS.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk-en/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/qakbot-resurges-spreads-through-vbs-files)\n\nThe VBScript decodes a list of commands and a URL. This URL is used to download the next stage, the\nJSSLoader. After downloading and saving the JSSLoader into the %temp% directory, it will create a scheduled\ntask that executes the file. In the QBOT campaigns, a QBOT executable is the next stage instead of the\nJSSLoader.\n\nNewer VBScripts are divided into two stages. The first one just downloads and executes the second VBScript\nfrom <url_path>/margarita.\n\n**Figure 4: Downloading and executing the second VBScript.**\n\nThe downloaded VBScript decodes and executes the in-memory VBScript that then downloads and executes the\nnext stage JSSloader through a scheduled task, possibly to avoid sequential monitoring of the attack chain. URLs\nto the JSSLoader have a similar pattern – <url_path>/<file_name>.eml.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: A URL to the JSSLoader.**\n\nFrom late October 2020, the adversaries moved to a WSF (Windows Script File) as the first stage script. Basically,\nthey wrapped the VBScript from the older version into a WSF.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### JSSLOADER\n\nJSSLoader is a highly maintained minimized .NET RAT backdoor, mostly used by the FIN7 group. It includes the\nfollowing functionality:\n\n   - Minimal anti-debugging\n\n   - Exfiltration capabilities\n\n   - Persistency techniques\n\n   - Remote command execution.\n\nThe following will begin with the most recent sample of the JSSLoader together with its followup stages, then it will\ntrack its evolution over the past year, skipping over any minor changes.\n\n###### LATEST SAMPLE DECEMBER 14, 2020\n\nHash: db1d98e9cca11beea4cfd1bfbe097dffd9fc4cc8b1b02e781863658d8c6f16c7\n\n###### Unique identification\n\nTo track the target, JSSLoader will generate a unique id of the victim which is based on the following:\n\n   - Serial number - “SELECT SerialNumber FROM Win32_BIOS”\n\n   - Domain name\n\n   - Computer name\n\nfingerprint - <domain_name><computer_name><serial_number>\n\n**Figure 6: The unique ID generated by JSSLoader.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Anti-Debug\n\nMinimalistic anti-debugging using timing checks – TickCount.\n\n**Figure 7: TickCount**\n\n###### Exfiltration\n\nAs with many other downloaders, the first exfiltrated information is a precondition for the next execution stage. The\nRAT collects the following:\n\n   - Host name\n\n   - domain name\n\n   - user name\n\n   - running processes\n\n   - system information (patches)\n\n   - desktop files\n\n   - AD information\n\n   - logical drives\n\n   - network information\n\n**Figure 8: The first exfiltrated information.**\n\nThe concatenated information is then base64 encoded and sent to a preconfigured URL. In this sample, it’s sent to\nhxxps://freshenvironmentaldesigns[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Persistency\n\n[A shortcut shell LNK via com IShellLink (similar to Turla’s campaign) in the startup directory that points to the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/eset-gazer-whitepaper.pdf)\nexecutable is created.\n\n**Figure 9: The shortcut shell LNK via IShellLink**\n\n###### Remote Command Execution\n\nThe next stage execution went through a significant evolution over the past year. Immediately following a\npersistence stage, the RAT will wait for a base64 encoded command string to be delivered via a ‘Get’ command from\nthe same domain the data had been sent to. As with previous communication attempts, SSL certificate errors will be\nignored and the unique victim ID will be sent as part of the request.\n\n**Figure 10: The WebClient communication protocol.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe command string that is received from the C2 domain will be evaluated against a predefined set of options.\n\n**Figure 11: The command string received from the C2 domain.**\n\nThe different execution options are described below:\n\n**•** **[Cmd_FORM][ – pops a non-malicious form.]**\n\n**•** **[Cmd_JS/Cmd_VBS][ – the command is written into a random named file in %userprofile%\\contacts\\<random_]**\nname> and executed using cscript.exe.\n\n**•** **[Cmd_EXE][ – writes the executable to %userprofile%\\contacts\\<random_name> and executes it.]**\n\n**•** **[Cmd_UPDATE][ – auto-update capability - writes the new version to %userprofile%\\contacts\\<random_name>, ]**\ndeletes the current JSSLoader, executes the new version, and terminates the old one.\n\n**•** **[Cmd_UNINST][ – Uninstalls the RAT from the infected machine by deleting the JSSLoader, removing the ]**\npersistency, and terminating the process.\n\n**•** **[Cmd_RAT][ – writes a blob of content to %userprofile%\\contacts\\<random_name> and executes a PowerShell ]**\ncommand that uses this file. This is be described in the next section.\n\n**•** **[Cmd_PWS][ – executes a PowerShell command in memory.]**\n\n**•** **[Cmd_RunDll][ – writes a DLL to %userprofile%\\contacts\\<random_name> and executes it using runll32.exe.]**\n\n**•** **[Cmd_Info][ – exfiltrates information from victims machine (see Exfiltration section above).]**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Next Stage – Takeout & Carbanak\n\nAs described above, while there are many possibilities for follow-up execution, the focus of this report is on the\n“Cmd_RAT” that was recently intercepted by Morphisec’s prevention product in a customer’s environment.\n\n**Figure 12: The “CMD_RAT”**\n\nThe delivered command is parsed into an array of lines (using new line delimiter), then the real command is\nextracted from between the quotes of the longest line in the array. This string is then written into a file on disk,\nwhich is later parsed by a pre-built PowerShell command described below. In most cases the string is a compressed\nstream.\n\n**Figure 13: The pre-built PowerShell command**\n\nThe executed PowerShell script is known as a Takeout script. Multiple variations of the Takeout script mainly differ\non how they extract the next stage of in-memory execution through the use of the “$body” parameter, a simple\nretrohunt in VirusTotal shows Takeouts with a full embedded “$body”. In this case, the PowerShell script reads the\ncontent of a previously written command file as described above, decompresses it in memory, and executes the\nsecond layer PowerShell. The second layer PowerShell reflectively maps a Carbanak to memory.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 14: Takeout scipt**\n\n**[It is possible to identify more Takeout script examples using the following vt-search (from there](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/content%253A%2522zipStream.Read(%2524scriptBin%2522/files)**\n**[searched by vthash vthash-search).](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/vhash:c8b4e6562ead4c9b903ea9707ffad6d1/files)**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CONCLUSION\n\nIf there is one thing this analysis shows us, it’s that these threats are a moving target. Thwarting them can only be\nachieved by outpacing their advancements, and knowledge sharing is one of the best ways to do this. MITRE ATT&CK\nis the first place that comes to mind when it comes to knowledge sharing and collaboration around adversarial\ntechniques and tactics.\n\nThreat actors like FIN7 are among a long list of groups that MITRE tracks. This list shows that FIN7’s JSSLoader is no\nexception when it comes to evolving threats. Threat actors constantly change their techniques, continuously evade\ndetection, and achieve their adversarial goals despite the security controls that are in place. It takes a new approach\nto end this cycle.\n\nMorphisec’s R&D team is dedicated to developing technology that does not rely on detecting techniques because\nthose are always subject to change. Instead, Morphisec prevents the non-negotiable tactics that the adversaries rely\non to achieve their goals no matter how many times they evolve their malware. As these new and unknown threats\n[like this one are prevented, rich forensic data is collected, analyzed, and shared with the community via our Moving](https://blog.morphisec.com/)\n[Target Defense Blog[.]](https://blog.morphisec.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### APPENDIX: JSSLOADER EVOLUTION\n\n###### Creation date: October 10, 2019:  148d74e453e49bc21169b7cca683e5764d0f02941b705aaa147977ffd1501376\n\nC2 - hxxps://dempoloka.com/gate.php\n\n   - It creates a shortcut shell LNK via com IShellLink in the startup directory that points to the executable.\n\n   - Then it exfiltrates information:\n\n**Figure 15: The first creation of JSSLoader**\n\n\n-----\n\n  - [The exfiltrated information is sent as base64 encoded.
