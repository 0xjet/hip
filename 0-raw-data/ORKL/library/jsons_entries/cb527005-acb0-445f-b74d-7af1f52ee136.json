Unfortunately, we can only pick one winner for the contest. In this case, our\nwinner was the first to submit the correct information. Join us in congratulating this month's\nwinner, Alex Rodriguez-Vargas! Alex will receive this month's prize: a Raspberry Pi 4 kit.\n\nSeveral people came close and almost had everything. This exercise required reviewing\nboth the pcap and malware recovered from the infected Windows host. You can still find the\n[pcap and malware at this Github repository.](https://github.com/brad-duncan/April-2021-forensic-quiz)\n\nThe pcap of infection traffic for this quiz was generated from a spreadsheet retrieved when I\n[recorded this Youtube video. The pcap in this month's quiz starts during HTTPS traffic to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAkeXCYcl4Y)\n\"unsubscribe\" page seen in the video.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Pcap from this quiz filtered in Wireshark, and a list of the malware/artifacts._\n\n**_Answers_**\n\nIP address of the infected Windows computer:\n\n**_192.168.5.125_**\n\nHost name of the infected Windows computer:\n\n**_LAPTOP-X9NAQ2EU_**\n\nUser account name on the infected Windows computer:\n\n**_wilmer.coughlin_**\n\nDate and time the infection activity began in UTC (the GMT or Zulu timezone):\n\n**_2021-03-29 at 22:18 UTC_**\n\nNOTE: The infection activity could be considered as early as 22:15 UTC which is when\nthe malicious domain gtmers[.]xyz appears. Or it could be considered as late as 22:22\nUTC, which is when the spreadsheet macro successfully downloaded a malicious EXE\nfor BazarLoader.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe family or families of malware on the infected computer:\n\n**_BazaLoader (BazarLoader)_**\n**_Cobalt Strike_**\n**_Anchor_**\n\nTo help in your analysis of this activity, please review the Prerequisites section in our\noriginal blog for this quiz.\n\n**_BazaLoader (BazarLoader) Activity_**\n\nFrom the malware archive in the Downloads directory under wilmer.coughlin, there is an\nExcel spreadsheet named subscription_1617056233.xlsb. This spreadsheet has malicious\nmacros. I [submitted it to the Triage Hatching sandbox, and it generated the following traffic:](https://tria.ge/210413-5h2m2q8ysx/behavioral2)\n\nhxxp://veso2[.]xyz/campo/r/r1\n\nIn the pcap, this URL caused a redirect. First it redirected to:\n\nhxxp://admin.youglessindia[.]in/theme/js/plugins/rt3ret3.exe\n\nBut that follow-up URL did not return any malware. This happened while I was still recording\n[the Youtube video. At the video's 10 minute mark, I enable macros on the malicious](https://youtu.be/uAkeXCYcl4Y?t=600)\nspreadsheet, but nothing apparently happened. So the call center operator had me re-open\nthe spreadsheet and enable macros again. That second time, the campo URL redirected to:\n\nhxxp://veso2[.]xyz/uploads/files/rt3ret3.exe\n\nThe above URL returned a Windows executable (EXE) file. This EXE from the pcap has the\nsame SHA256 hash as the file located in our malware archive at:\n\nProgramData\\huqvg\\huqvg.exe\n\nOf note, opening the spreadsheet and enabling macros generated the following artifacts:\n\nUsers\\Public\\4123.do1\nUsers\\Public\\4123.xlsb\nUsers\\Public\\4123.xsg\n\nTraffic caused by BazaLoader (BazarLoader) in this pcap is:\n\n176.111.174[.]53 port 80 - veso2[.]xyz - POST /campo/r/r1\n104.21.74[.]174 port 80 - admin.youglessindia[.]in - POST /theme/js/plugins/rt3ret3.exe\n176.111.174[.]53 port 80 - veso2[.]xyz - POST /uploads/files/rt3ret3.exe\n54.184.119[.]29 port 443 - HTTPS traffic\n184.72.1.208 port 443 - HTTPS traffic\nport 80 - api ip[ ]sb - GET /ip\n\n\n-----\n\nOf note, the last entry above is an IP address check by the infected Windows host. I don t\nnormally see that with BazaLoader activity, but I could not positively attibute it to any of the\nother malware activity in this pcap.\n\n_Shown above: Some of the BazaLoader traffic from this infection._\n\n**_Cobalt Strike Activity_**\n\nCobalt Strike was sent through encrypted HTTPS traffic generated by BazaLoader. A DLL\nfor Cobalt Strike was saved to the infected host at:\n\nC:\\Users\\wilmer.coughlin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\C618.tmp.dll\n\nThe run method for the above Cobalt Strike DLL is:\n\nrundll32.exe [filename],lowslow\n\nThis generated the following Cobalt Strike traffic:\n\n217.12.218[.]46 port 80 - 217.12.218[.]46 - GET /YPbR\n217.12.218[.]46 port 80 - onedrive.live.com - GET /preload?manifest=wac\n217.12.218[.]46 port 80 - onedrive.live.com - GET /sa\n\nThere were a great deal of HTTP requests generated by the Cobalt Strike, about 40 to 60\nHTTP requests every minute. Of note, the domain onedrive.live[.]com does not resolve to\n217.12.218[.]46, which means this is a deception intentionally generated by the malware.\nDuring the Cobalt Strike traffic, seven HTTP requests to checkip.amazonaws[.]com appear\nas the infected Windows host periodically checks its IP address.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Start of Cobalt Strike activity in the pcap._\n\n**_Anchor Activity_**\n\n[Anchor DNS malware uses DNS queries to stealthily communicate to C2 servers. Our pcap](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware#anchordnsvariant)\ncontains DNS activity that follows patterns reported for Anchor. The associated domains are:\n\nsluaknhbsoe[.]com\nxyskencevli[.]com\n\nThe domain xyskencevli[.]com did not resolve, but sluaknhbsoe[.]com did. The pcap\ncontains several DNS queries with long strings for sub-domain of sluaknhbsoe[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: DNS traffic caused by Anchor DNS malware._\n\n[This type of DNS tunneling does not rely on direct contact with the the C2 domain. Malware](https://hello.global.ntt/en-us/insights/blog/trickbot-variant-communicating-over-dns)\nfamilies like Anchor use this method to disguise tunneling from an Windows infected host.\nHowever, we can easily spot the unusual DNS queries from the pcap.\n\nOf note, the following binaries are included in the malware archive:\n\nWindows\\Temp\\adf\\anchor_x64.exe\nWindows\\Temp\\adf\\anchorAsjuster_x64.exe\nWindows\\Temp\\adf\\anchorDNS_x64.exe\n\nThe malware archive also contains a scheduled task at:\n\nWindows\\System32\\Tasks\\Sun SvcRestartTask#32640\n\nThis shows a task to run the following command:\n\nWindows\\Temp\\adf\\anchorDNS_x64.exe -s\n\nThe task is designed to keep Anchor DNS malware persistent on the infected Windows host.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Scheduled task for Anchor malware._\n\n**_Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)_**\n\n[SHA256 hash: ae6dbc08e0e21b217352175f916cfd5269c4fd8d5de6bff2d0a93a366f78e8d1](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ae6dbc08e0e21b217352175f916cfd5269c4fd8d5de6bff2d0a93a366f78e8d1/detection)\n\nFile size: 181,413 bytes\nFile name: subscription_1617056233.xlsb\nFile description: Spreadsheet with macros for BazaLoader (BazarLoader)\n\nSHA256 hash:\n[291c573996c647508544e8e21bd2764e6e4c834d53d6d2c8903a0001c783764b](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/291c573996c647508544e8e21bd2764e6e4c834d53d6d2c8903a0001c783764b/detection)\n\nFile size: 242,176 bytes\nFile location: hxxp://veso2[.]xyz/uploads/files/rt3ret3.exe\nFile location: C:\\ProgramData\\huqvg\\huqvg.exe\nFile description: EXE for BazaLoader (BazarLoader)\n\n[SHA256 hash: cc74f7e82eb33a14ffdea343a8975d8a81be151ffcb753cb3f3be10242c8a252](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/cc74f7e82eb33a14ffdea343a8975d8a81be151ffcb753cb3f3be10242c8a252/detection)\n\nFile size: 299,520 bytes\nFile location: C:\\Users\\wilmer.coughlin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\C618.tmp.dll\nFile description: DLL for Cobalt Strike\nRun method: rundll32.exe [filename],lowslow\n\nSHA256 hash:\n[3ab8a1ee10bd1b720e1c8a8795e78cdc09fec73a6bb91526c0ccd2dc2cfbc28d](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3ab8a1ee10bd1b720e1c8a8795e78cdc09fec73a6bb91526c0ccd2dc2cfbc28d/detection)\n\nFile size: 251,904 bytes\nFile location: C:\\Windows\\Temp\\adf\\anchorAsjuster_x64.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nFile description: Anchor malware EXE (1 of 3)\nNote: This is not inherently malicious on its own, but can be used to run the other two\nAnchor files.\n\n[SHA256 hash: a8a8c66b155fcf9bfdf34ba0aca98991440c3d34b8a597c3fdebc8da251c9634](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a8a8c66b155fcf9bfdf34ba0aca98991440c3d34b8a597c3fdebc8da251c9634/detection)\n\nFile size: 347,648 bytes\nFile location: C:\\Windows\\Temp\\adf\\anchor_x64.exe\nFile description: Anchor malware EXE (2 of 3)\n\n[SHA256 hash: 9fdbd76141ec43b6867f091a2dca503edb2a85e4b98a4500611f5fe484109513](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9fdbd76141ec43b6867f091a2dca503edb2a85e4b98a4500611f5fe484109513/detection)\n\nFile size: 347,648 bytes\nFile location: C:\\Windows\\Temp\\adf\\anchorDNS_x64.exe\nFile description: Anchor malware EXE (3 of 3)\n\nHTTPS traffic that returned malicious spreadsheet:\n\n8.209.100[.]246 port 443 - gtmers[.]xyz\n\nBazaLoader traffic:\n\n176.111.174[.]53 port 80 - veso2[.]xyz - POST /campo/r/r1\n104.21.74[.]174 port 80 - admin.yougleeindia[.]in - POST /theme/js/plugins/rt3ret3.exe\n176.111.174[.]53 port 80 - veso2[.]xyz - POST /uploads/files/rt3ret3.exe\n54.184.119[.]29 port 443 - HTTPS traffic caused by BazaLoader (BazarLoader)\n184.72.1[.]208 port 443 - HTTPS traffic caused by BazaLoader (BazarLoader)\n\nIP address checks by the infected Windows host:\n\nport 80 - api.ip[.]sb - GET /ip\nport 80 - checkip.amazonaws[.]com - GET /\n\nCobalt Strike traffic:\n\n217.12.218[.]46 port 80 - 217.12.218[.]46 - GET /YPbR\n217.12.218[.]46 port 80 - onedrive.live[.]com - GET /preload?manifest=wac\n217.12.218[.]46 port 80 - onedrive.live[.]com - GET /sa\n\nDomains used by Anchor malware:\n\nsluaknhbsoe[.]com\nxyskencevli[.]com\n\n**_Final words_**\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother case of type of infection, one where BazaLoader leads to Cobalt Strike and Anchor,\n[was reported here last month.
