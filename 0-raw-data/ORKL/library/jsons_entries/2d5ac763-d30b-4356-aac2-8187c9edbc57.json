We have been monitoring the activities of this group and believe they are operating\nfrom China.\n\nThis group leverages social engineering to deliver spearphishing emails, in a variety of\nlanguages including English, French and Chinese, and email phishing pages to their targets.\nThe attackers use a variety of different malware and tools to maintain command and control\n(C2) and move laterally through their targets’ networks.\n\nIn a recent attack against a French company, the attackers sent simple, straightforward\nmessages in English and French from free email addresses using names of actual\nemployees of the targeted company.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have also observed this group using a Yahoo! email phishing kit, with phishing pages for\nmultiple regions and in multiple languages.\n\nThe malicious documents exploit vulnerable versions of Microsoft Office. The attackers used\ntwo different exploits CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2014-1761.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe documents that exploit CVE-2012-0158 were built using a tool that leaves behind the\n[metadata which indicates that the author is “Tran Duy Linh”. (This builder has been shared](http://blog.malwaretracker.com/2013/06/tomato-garden-campaign-possible.html)\nacross multiple threat groups that are otherwise unconnected).\n\nThe documents that exploit CVE-2014-1761 contain metadata that matches malicious\n[documents created by both the Jdoc builder and the Metasploit Framework, however, the](https://twitter.com/SnorreFagerland/status/464659376733958144/photo/1/large)\nexact builder tool used by the attackers remains unclear.\n\nThis threat group uses a first-stage malware known as Backdoor.APT.Pgift (aka\nTroj/ReRol.A), which is dropped via malicious documents and connects back to a C2 server.\nThis malware communicates some information about the compromised computer; however,\nits primary function is to deliver the second-stage malware to the compromised computer.\n\n**Backdoor.APT.Pgift Builder**\n\nDuring our investigation, we discovered a builder used in conjunction with the\nBackdoor.APT.Pgift malware. This builder is used to create and test files placed on the C2\nserver.\n\nThe builder creates three files:\n\n25dd831ae7d720998a3e3a8d205ab684 dr.asp\n4b89c31d1d7744bcf5049d582d35e717 Install-Dll.bat\ne738286a0031621d50aeb5fc1d95d7a4 JHttpSrv.dll\n\nThe dr.asp file is placed on a web server, and malware on compromised systems will beacon\nto it. The file can retrieve the compromised host’s IP address and returns either a 32-bit or\n64-bit second-stage executable depending on the compromised host’s environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Install-Dll.bat file simply installs JHttpSrv.dll by running the command:\n\nregsrv jhttpsrv\n\nThe JHttpSrv.dll handles the incoming, encoded data from compromised hosts.\n\nThis data is written to a text file in a directory named “log” with the following format:\n\nIP Address-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.[3 digits].txt\n\nThis data contains information about the compromised system including:\n\nHostname\nUsername\nSystem Type (32-bin or 64-bit)\nOperating System\nOrganization\nOwner\nPorts and Processes\nRunning Software\nInstalled Software\nNetwork Configuration\n\nAlthough this tool has some information-gathering capabilities, it is primarily a “downloader”\ndesigned to push second-stage malware to a compromised system.\n\n**Previous Attacks**\n\n\n-----\n\nIt appears the Backdoor.APT.Pgift malware was used in an earlier attack against a target in\nTaiwan. Although the email date shows September 2010, the actual email appears to have\nbeen sent in January 2014. The malicious attachment 中秋節酒品禮薈萃.doc\n(4c350726bb7773f0ac98bdd665ef93dc) exploits CVE-2012-0158 to drop\nf3b1a1c18c783c2e949e68f0dd047eae. The network communication is:\n\nPOST /pgift.asp HTTP/1.1\n\nContent-Length: 9637\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;)\n\nHost: 113.10.221.196:8080\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nAlthough the malware is the same, this version uses the filename “pgift.asp” instead of\n“dr.asp.”\n\nWe have observed attacks against targets in Taiwan using phishing emails written in\nTraditional Chinese, and the repeated use of .tw domains as command and control servers\nmay indicate an interest in Taiwan as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malware**\n\nThe PittyTiger group uses various other malware including:\n\nBackdoor.APT.PittyTiger1.3 (aka CT RAT) – This malware is likely used as a secondstage backdoor. The behavior of this sample is similar to the “old” PittyTiger but is\ndistinct. The attackers labeled it as PittyTiger v. 1.3 and use an interface that displays\nthe system information associated with a compromised computer and provides the\nattacker with a remote shell. The attackers may be using this as second-stage\nmalware.\n\nBackdoor.APT.PittyTiger – This malware is the classic “PittyTiger” malware\n(PittyTigerV1.0) that was heavily used by this group in 2012-2013. This malware allows\nthe attackers to use a remote shell, upload and download files and capture\nscreenshots.\n\nBackdoor.APT.Lurid (aka MM RAT / Troj/Goldsun-B) – This malware is a variant of the\n[Enfal/Lurid malware used by a variety of different groups since at least 2006. This](http://la.trendmicro.com/media/misc/lurid-downloader-enfal-report-en.pdf)\nvariant has the same functionality, but the file names have been changed. We have\nobserved the Enfal/Lurid malware in use since 2011 and in conjunction with\nBackdoor.APT.Pgift as the payload of a malicious document used in spearphishing\nattacks. It also appears the attackers use this as second-stage malware.\n\nGh0st variants – A [report by Cassidian Cyber Security reveals the attackers also use](http://bitbucket.cassidiancybersecurity.com/whitepapers/downloads/Pitty%20Tiger%20Final%20Report.pdf)\nvariants of Gh0st RAT, a well-known RAT used by a variety of attackers. These variants\nare known as Paladin RAT and Leo RAT.\n\nPoisonIvy – This group also used the Poison Ivy malware during 2008-2009. We\nanalyzed PoisonIvy samples that connect to domain names used by this group. The\nsamples were compiled in 2008 and 2009 (one of the samples with a 2008 compile\ndate was also submitted to Virustotal in 2008, leading us to believe the timestamps\nhave not been altered).\n\nThe PittyTiger group uses a variety of malware to achieve their objectives. We have not\nobserved these attackers using 0day exploits; rather, they appear to acquire access to\nbuilders that are more widely distributed that can be used to create malicious documents.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nWe would like to thank Alex Lanstein, Jen Kolde, Jonathan Wrolstad, Ned Moran and\nThoufique Haq.\n\n**Samples**\n\n_Backdoor.APT.Pgift_\n\n\n-----\n\n5e2360a8c4a0cce1ae22919d8bff49fd\n\nf74a7a7f43dfce7ff2851baefe19ef63\n\n05de3bfb5da1dcf08f9ca0bd589364bf\n\n5e2360a8c4a0cce1ae22919d8bff49fd\n\n79e48961d1ee982a466d222671a42ccb\n\nbf95e89906b8a17fd611002660ffff32\n\ned35e43142b42b57f518197d930471d9\n\n5e2360a8c4a0cce1ae22919d8bff49fd\n\n_Backdoor.APT.PittyTiger1.3_\n\nf65dc0b3eeb3c393e89ab49a3fac95a8\n\n**Backdoor.APT.Lurid**\n\nb72cf03822cd03a4923195cb7db9ac41\n\neb658d398ac54236564dd52b23943736\n\n728d6d3c98b17de3261eaf76b9c3eb7a\n\n735d37a1fde0f8d8924a70e9101c45b1\n\n9712235ba979ef5a23db3ebdc41d9a02\n\nd4be094c7f767fc6d9eda1665d536484\n\n_Backdoor.APT.PittyTiger_\n\n1097a30d91b0e8adaec8951fb639ffe0\n\n1f7796e76427c96d57086fcf797518f7\n\n0618961c6abf67670658c659a4b3897f\n\n370e2ebe5d72678affd39264a0d2fedd\n\n55e456339936a56c73a7883ea1ddb672\n\n55e456339936a56c73a7883ea1ddb672\n\n7fade5e7576cc72559c62660371279e8\n\n\n-----\n\nfa53ca3339bb5619f6e39215a4697b52\n\n1cea8afd101ab50087122231acf88407\n\n26be2cbb00158dfab6c81976d93748e8\n\nce15fa3338b7fe780e85c511d5e49a98\n\na494010a51705f7720d3cd378a31733a\n\n_PoisonIvy_\n\nae35a23cb418af084d10820bb0eae1d8\n\n99a5fd0eba39efc9cba880d9629217e0\n\na2494e1e528c4a973232d027172bee44\n\nPrevious Post\nNext Post\n\n\n-----",
