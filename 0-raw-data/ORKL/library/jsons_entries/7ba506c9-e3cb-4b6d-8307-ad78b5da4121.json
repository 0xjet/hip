If the user does not repay the demanded money, abusive messages/images\nof the user will be sent to all the contacts in the user’s device. There are many reports of users taking\ntheir own life as they were unable to withstand the harassment. And the more saddening part is that\nsome of these apps are still available in Google Play Store.\n\nSome of the loan apps in Google Play Store are shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nPlay Store\nSome user reviews in Google Play Store are shown in Figure 2.\n\nGoogle Play Store\n\n\nFigure 1: Loan apps in Google\n\nFigure 2: User reviews in\n\n\n-----\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n[In this blog, we will be analysing the com.lvcash.lvcashcomshoz app in Google Play Store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lvcash.lvcashcomshoz)\n\nThis loan app is named “Cash Advance” in Google Play Store.\n\nWhen the user installs this app as shown in Figure 3, the app requests for a list of permissions as\nshown in Figure 4. Why does a loan app request these permissions? Whenever any app is installed,\nusers should be alert as to what permissions are sought by the app and decide which permissions\nare actually necessary for the app to function properly.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: User installs Cash Advance in\n\n\ndevice\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: App permissions\n\nThis app accesses the camera on the user’s device as shown in Figure 5 and captures images and\nrecords videos of the user as shown in Figure 6, which can later be used to threaten them.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: App\n\naccessing the front camera\n\nFigure 6: App capturing image/video\nThe app collects the contact lists from the user’s device as shown in Figure 7. Later, the loan agent\nthreatens the user by sending abusive messages/images to this collected contact list.\n\nFigure 7: Collecting contact details from the user’s device\n\n\n-----\n\nThe app also collects a list of installed packages from the user s device as shown in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8: Collecting installed app list from user’s device\nThe app collects the location, SMS details and device information from the user’s device as shown in\nFigure 9 and Figure 10.\n\nFigure 9:\n\nCollecting location information from user’s device\n\nFigure 10: Collecting SMS information from\n\nuser’s device\n\nConsidering the aforementioned modules of the app, viz contact list collection, camera control, etc;\nwe can understand that this app is designed with deception and strong-arm tactics in mind. Once the\nuser makes a financial commitment through this app, they are trapped and their own user data is\nused against them. During the installation, the app does mention in its privacy policy that it collects\nall SMS details, contact list, access camera, storage, installed applications, IP of the device and also\nsays that it will upload this information to their site https[:]//app[.lvcash[.xyz.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mitigations\n\nCarefully read the user review’s before downloading any app\nBe aware of what information the app collects from the user’s device\nProtect your device and data with a reputed security product like K7 Mobile Security and keep\nit up to date to protect yourself of the threats lurking around\n\nWe at K7 Labs detect such kinds of threats and are constantly working to protect our users.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Package name** **Hash** **Detection**\n**Name**\n\ncom.lvcash.lvcashcomshoz 0A86646E55AB4501C483C06C24D7E01B Spyware (\n005923441\n)\n\ncom.moneyy.magicmoneyok 7881D65DEA553FBA86D83F846C83023C Trojan (\n0001140e1\n)\n\ncom.hc.go c9606e68f6bc314e268b8645e57c9716 Spyware (\n005926b41\n)\n\ncom.prestamos.credito.trueno 620589e7d4fdd5f42acf9eef7b3c26b0 Trojan (\n005926b31\n)\n\ncom.pezcredito.prestamo.dinero.efectivo 2edd76acfde09ff8af36d47077b04f4f Trojan (\n0001140e1\n)\n\n\n-----",
