These documents utilize macros to download and install the Emotet\nTrojan on a victim's computer, which is then used to steal email and deploy further malware\non the device.\n\nHistorically, Emotet would install the TrickBot or Qbot trojans on infected devices. These\nTrojans would eventually deploy Cobalt Strike on an infected device or perform other\nmalicious behavior.\n\n\n-----\n\nCobalt Strike is a legitimate penetration testing toolkit that allows attackers to deploy\n\"beacons\" on compromised devices to perform remote network surveillance or execute\nfurther commands.\n\nHowever, Cobalt Strike is very popular among threat actors who use cracked versions as\npart of their network breaches and is commonly used in ransomware attacks.\n\n## Emotet changes its tactics\n\n[Today, Emotet research group Cryptolaemus warned that Emotet is now skipping their](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1)\nprimary malware payload of TrickBot or Qbot and directly installing Cobalt Strike beacons on\ninfected devices.\n\n[WARNING We have confirmed that #Emotet is dropping CS Beacons on E5 Bots and](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Emotet?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nwe have observed the following as of 10:00EST/15:00UTC. The following beacon was\n[dropped: https://t.co/imJDQTGqxV Note the traffic to lartmana[.]com. This is an active](https://t.co/imJDQTGqxV)\nCS Teams Server. 1/x\n\n[— Cryptolaemus (@Cryptolaemus1) December 7, 2021](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1468266929014157316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nA Flash Alert shared with BleepingComputer by email security firm Cofense explained that a\nlimited number of Emotet infections installed Cobalt Strike, attempted to contact a remote\ndomain, and then was uninstalled.\n\n\"Today, some infected computers received a command to install Cobalt Strike, a popular\npost-exploitation tool,\" warns the Cofense Flash Alert.\n\n\"Emotet itself gathers a limited amount of information about an infected machine, but Cobalt\nStrike can be used to evaluate a broader network or domain, potentially looking for suitable\nvictims for further infection such as ransomware.\"\n\n\"While the Cobalt Strike sample was running, it attempted to contact the domain\nlartmana[.]com. Shortly afterward, Emotet uninstalled the Cobalt Strike executable.\"\n\nThis is a significant change in tactics as after Emotet installed its primary payload of TrickBot\nor Qbot, victims typically had some time to detect the infection before Cobalt Strike was\ndeployed.\n\nNow that these initial malware payloads are skipped, threat actors will have immediate\naccess to a network to spread laterally, steal data, and quickly deploy ransomware.\n\n\"This is a big deal. Typically Emotet dropped TrickBot or QakBot, which in turn dropped\nCobaltStrike. You'd usually have about a month between first infection and ransomware.\nWith Emotet dropping CS directly, there's likely to be a much much shorter delay,\" security\n[researcher Marcus Hutchins tweeted about the development.](https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1468305592296951808)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis rapid deployment of Cobalt Strike will likely speed up ransomware deployment on\ncompromised networks. This is especially true for the Conti ransomware gang who\n[convinced the Emotet operators to relaunch after they were](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-comeback-orchestrated-by-conti-ransomware-gang/) [shut down by law enforcement in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-disrupted-after-global-takedown-operation/)\nJanuary.\n\nCofense says that it is unclear if this is a test, being used by Emotet for their own network\nsurveillance, or is part of an attack chain for other malware families that partner with the\nbotnet.\n\n\"We don’t know yet whether the Emotet operators intend to gather data for their own\nuse, or if this is part of an attack chain belonging to one of the other malware families.\nConsidering the quick removal, it might have been a test, or even unintentional.\" Cofense.\n\nResearchers will closely monitor this new development, and as further information becomes\navailable, we will update this article.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Malicious PyPI package opens backdoors on Windows, Linux, and Macs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-pypi-package-opens-backdoors-on-windows-linux-and-macs/)\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows, Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Eternity malware kit offers stealer, miner, worm, ransomware tools](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/eternity-malware-kit-offers-stealer-miner-worm-ransomware-tools/)\n\n[Historic Hotel Stay, Complementary Emotet Exposure included](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/historic-hotel-stay-complementary-emotet-exposure-included/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
