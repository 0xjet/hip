This week, we were able to disrupt some of\nStrontium’s attacks on targets in Ukraine. On Wednesday April 6th, we obtained a court\norder authorizing us to take control of seven internet domains Strontium was using to\nconduct these attacks. We have since re-directed these domains to a sinkhole controlled by\nMicrosoft, enabling us to mitigate Strontium’s current use of these domains and enable victim\nnotifications.\n\nStrontium was using this infrastructure to target Ukrainian institutions including media\norganizations. It was also targeting government institutions and think tanks in the United\nStates and the European Union involved in foreign policy. We believe Strontium was\nattempting to establish long-term access to the systems of its targets, provide tactical\nsupport for the physical invasion and exfiltrate sensitive information. We have notified\nUkraine’s government about the activity we detected and the action we’ve taken.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis disruption is part of an ongoing long-term investment, started in 2016, to take legal and\ntechnical action to seize infrastructure being used by Strontium. We have established a legal\nprocess that enables us to obtain rapid court decisions for this work. Prior to this week, we\nhad taken action through this process 15 times to seize control of more than 100 Strontium\ncontrolled domains.\n\nThe Strontium attacks are just a small part of the activity we have seen in Ukraine. Before\nthe Russian invasion, our teams began working around the clock to help organizations in\nUkraine, including government agencies, defend against an onslaught of cyberwarfare that\nhas escalated since the invasion began and has continued relentlessly. Since then, we have\nobserved nearly all of Russia’s nation-state actors engaged in the ongoing full-scale\noffensive against Ukraine’s government and critical infrastructure, and we continue to work\nclosely with government and organizations of all kinds in Ukraine to help them defend\nagainst this onslaught. In the coming weeks we expect to provide a more comprehensive\nlook at the scope of the cyberwar in Ukraine.\n\nTags: [cyberattacks,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberattacks/) [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [cyberwar,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberwar/) [Russia,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/russia/) [strontium,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/strontium/) [Ukraine](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/ukraine/)\n\n\n-----",
