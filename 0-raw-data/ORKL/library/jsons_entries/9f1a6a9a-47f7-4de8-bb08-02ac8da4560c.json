Alongside goals like cyberespionage and cybersabotage, the\nattacker has been targeting banks and other financial companies around the globe. Over the last few months, Lazarus has successfully\ncompromised several banks and infiltrated a number of global cryptocurrency exchanges and fintech companies.\n\nKaspersky Lab has been assisting with incident response efforts. While investigating a cryptocurrency exchange attacked by Lazarus, we\nmade an unexpected discovery. The victim had been infected with the help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been\nrecommended to the company over email. It turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a third-party\napplication from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware known as Fallchill, an old tool that Lazarus\n[has recently switched back to. There have been multiple reports on the reappearance of Fallchill, including one from US-CERT.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-318A)\n\nTo ensure that the OS platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets, it seems the attackers went the extra mile and developed malware for\nother platforms, including for macOS. A version for Linux is apparently coming soon, according to the website. It’s probably the first time we\nsee this APT group using malware for macOS.\n\nThe fact that the Lazarus group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call for users of non-Windows\nplatforms.\n\n## Trojanized cryptocurrency trading application\n\nThanks to Kaspersky Lab’s malicious-behavior detection technology, implemented in its endpoint security software, we were able to\nreassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin. This helped us understand that one of Lazarus’ victims was infected\nwith malware after installing a cryptocurrency trading program. We also confirmed that the user installed this program via a download link\ndelivered over email.\n\n### Trojanized trading application for Windows\n\n\n-----\n\nc ud g a c ous code to d st buted so t a e a d putt g t at o a ebs te ou d be too ob ous stead, t e attac e s e t o a o e\nelaborate scheme: the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an update for a trading application.\n\nA legitimate-looking application called Celas Trade Pro from [Celas Limited showed no signs of malicious behaviour and looked genuine. This](https://www.celasllc.com/)\napplication is an all-in-one style cryptocurrency trading program developed by Celas.\n\n_Screenshot of Celas Trade Pro_\n\nWhen we started this research, any user could download the trading application from the Celas website. Checking the installation package\ndownloaded from the website confirmed the presence of a very suspicious updater.\n\n_Installation package download page_\n\nWe have analyzed the following Windows version of the installation package:\n\n**MD5: 9e740241ca2acdc79f30ad2c3f50990a**\n\n**File name: celastradepro_win_installer_1.00.00.msi**\n\n**File type: MSI installer**\n\n\n-----\n\n**C eat o** **t** **e** 0 8 06 9 0 6 00 U C\n\nAt the end of the installation process, the installer immediately runs the Updater.exe module with the “CheckUpdate” parameter. This file looks\nlike a regular tool and most likely will not arouse the suspicion of system administrators. After all, it even contains a valid digital signature,\nwhich belongs to the same vendor. But the devil is in the detail, as usual.\n\nThe code writer developed this project under the codename “jeus”, which was discovered in a PDB path included in the updater and used as\nunique HTTP multipart message data separator string. Because of this, and the fact that the attacked platforms include Apple macOS, we\ndecided to call this Operation AppleJeus.\n\nProperties of the shady updater tool included in the package are:\n\n**MD5: b054a7382adf6b774b15f52d971f3799**\n**File Type: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows**\n**Known file name: %Program Files%\\CelasTradePro\\Updater.exe**\n**Link Time: 2018-06-15 10:56:27 UTC**\n**Build path: Z:\\jeus\\downloader\\downloader_exe_vs2010\\Release\\dloader.pdb**\n\nThe main purpose of Updater.exe is to collect the victim’s host information and send it back to the server. Upon launch, the malware creates a\nunique string with the format string template “%09d-%05d” based on random values, which is used as a unique identifier of the infected host.\nThis malware collects process lists, excluding “[System Process]” and “System” processes and gets the exact OS version from the registry\nvalue at “HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion”. It seems that such values only exist from Windows 10, so we assume\nthat the author developed and tested it on Windows 10.\n\nProductName: Windows OS version\nCurrentBuildNumber: Windows 10 build version\nReleaseID: Windows 10 version information\nUBR: Sub version of Windows 10 build\nBuildBranch: Windows 10 build branch information\n\nThe code encrypts the collected information with the hardcoded XOR key (“Moz&Wie;#t/6T!2y“) before uploading it to the server.\n\n_Data encryption routine_\n\nThe code sends the victim’s information to a webserver using HTTP and the following URL:\n**www.celasllc[.]com/checkupdate.php**\n\nThe server is a legitimate looking website owned by the developer of the program: Celas LLC. At this point we were not able to conclude with\nhigh confidence whether the server was compromised by the threat actor or had belonged to the threat actor from the beginning. To learn more\nabout the server, please read the “Infrastructure” section below.\n\nThe malware used a hardcoded User-Agent string “Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/6.0)” and fixed a multipart\nform data separator string “jeus“.\n\nUsing encryption, the custom separator string wouldn’t be a red flag for a legitimate application, but sending a request with the contextirrelevant string “get_config”, as well as uploading collected system information as “temp.gif”, mimicking a GIF image with a magic number in\nthe header, definitely made us raise our eyebrows.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Communication with the C2 server_\n\nAfter successfully uploading data, the updater checks the server response. If the server responds with HTTP code 300, it means the updater\nshould keep quiet and take no action. However, if the response is HTTP code 200, it extracts the payload with base64 and decrypts it using\nRC4 with another hardcoded key (“W29ab@ad%Df324V$Yd“). The decrypted data is an executable file that is prepended with the\n“MAX_PATHjeusD” string.\n\nDuring our research, we found other similar files. One was created on August 3rd and another on August 11th. The PDB path shows that the\nauthor keeps improving this updater tool, apparently forked from some stable version released on July 2, 2018 according to the internal\ndirectory name.\n\n**Additional trojanized sample #1** **Additional trojanized sample**\n\n\n**Installation**\n**package**\n**MD5**\n\n**Package**\n**creation**\n**date**\n\n**Dropped**\n**updater**\n**MD5**\n\n**Updater**\n**creation**\n**date**\n\n**Updater**\n**Build path**\n\n\n4126e1f34cf282c354e17587bb6e8da3 0bdb652bbe15942e866083f29\n\n2018-08-03 09:57:29 2018-08-13 0:12:10\n\nffae703a1e327380d85880b9037a0aeb bbbcf6da5a4c352e8846bf91c3\n\n2018-08-03 09:50:08 2018-08-11 7:28:08\n\nH:\\DEV\\TManager\\DLoader\\20180702\\dloader\\WorkingDir\\Output\\00000009\\Release\\dloader.pdb H:\\DEV\\TManager\\DLoader\\2\n\n\nNote the TManager directory in the PDB path from the table. It will pop up again in another unexpected place later.\n\n### Trojanized trading program for macOS\n\nFor macOS users, Celas LLC also provided a native version of its trading app. A hidden “autoupdater” module is installed in the background to\nstart immediately after installation, and after each system reboot. It keeps contacting the command and control (C2) server in order to\ndownload and run an additional executable from the server. The communication conforms to the Windows version of the updater and is\ndisguised as an image file upload and download, while carrying encrypted data inside.\n\nWe have analyzed the following installation file:\n\n**MD5: 48ded52752de9f9b73c6bf9ae81cb429**\n\n**File Size: 15,020,544 bytes**\n\n**File Type: DMG disk image**\n\n**Known file name: celastradepro_mac_installer_1.00.00.dmg**\n\n**Date of creation: 13 July 2018**\n\nOnce the Cellas Trade Pro app is installed on macOS, it starts the Updater application on the system load via a file named\n“.com.celastradepro.plist” (note that it starts with a dot symbol, which makes it unlisted in the Finder app or default Terminal directory listing).\nThe “Updater” file is passed the “CheckUpdate” parameter on start.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Celas Trade Pro app plist file (Apple Property List)_\n\nThe command-line argument “CheckUpdate” looks redundant from a code analysis perspective: there is no other argument that the application\nexpects. In the absence of all arguments, it doesn’t do anything and quits. This may or may not be way to trick sandboxes that could\nautomatically execute this trojan updater, with no suspicious activity produced without such a “secret” extra argument. The choice of a benign\nstring such as “CheckUpdate” helps it to hide in plain sight of any user or administrator looking into running processes.\n\nThe trojanized updater works similar to the Windows version in many ways. Both applications are implemented using a cross-platform QT\nframework. Upon launch, the downloader creates a unique identifier for the infected host using a “%09d-%06d” format string template. Next,\nthe app collects basic system information, which for macOS is done via dedicated QT classes:\n\nHost name\nOS type and version\nSystem architecture\nOS kernel type and version\n\nThe process of encrypting and transferring data is the same as in the Windows version. This information is XOR-encrypted with hardcoded 16byte static key “Moz&Wie;#t/6T!2y”, prepended with GIF89a header and uploaded to the C2 server via HTTP POST and the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.celasllc[.]com/checkupdate.php\n\n_POST request template strings_\n\nThe module relies on a hardcoded User-Agent string for macOS:\n**User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/66.0.3359.139**\n**Safari/537.36**\n\nOnce the server replies, it checks the HTTP response code. HTTP response code 300 indicates that the server has no task for the updater and\nthe application terminates immediately. If the HTTP response is code 200, then the updater gets the data in the response, decodes it from\nbase64 encoding and decrypts it using RC4 with the hardcoded static key “W29ab@ad%Df324V$Yd“. It calculates the MD5 of the decoded\nand decrypted data, which is compared to a value stored inside, to verify the integrity of the transferred file. After that, the payload is extracted\nand saved to a hardcoded file location “/var/zdiffsec“, sets executable permissions for all users and starts the app with another secret\nhardcoded command-line argument “bf6a0c760cc642“. Apparently the command-line argument is the way to prevent the detection of its\nmalicious functionality via sandboxes or even reverse engineering. We have previously seen this technique adopted by Lazarus group in 2016\nin attacks against banks. As of 2018, it is still using this in almost every attack we investigated.\n\n## Downloaded payload\n\nAccording to data from Kaspersky Security Network, the threat actor delivered the malicious payload using one of the shadowy updaters\ndescribed above. We found a malicious file created at the same host:\n\n\n-----\n\n**5 0a 5a338** c9d a 889ae b e b\n**File Size: 104,898,560 bytes**\n**File Type: PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows**\n**Known file name: C:\\Recovery\\msn.exe**\n**Link time: 2018-04-19 13:30:19**\n\nNote the unusually large size for an executable file. We believe that it was inflated with junk data on purpose to prevent easy download or\ntransfer over the internet.\n\nSearching for the reason for the malware’s appearance on the system revealed that there was an additional process responsible for producing\nseveral files before this malware was launched, suggesting a trojan dropper in action. The main function of this malware is to implant the\nFallchill backdoor loader linked to several files. Upon launch, the malware checks one of the command-line arguments passed to it. The\nmalware chooses one of the service names located in the following registry value as a disguise:\n\n**HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost\\netsvcs**\n\nThis value includes a list of several dozen standard system service names.\n\nThe randomly chosen service name is used to name the dropped file and newly registered Windows service. Let’s refer to this randomly\nchosen service name as [service]. The malware contains references to several files inside:\n\nThe file passed as argument: contains a 16-byte key\nmsncf.dat: Encrypted configuration data\nmsndll.tmp: Encrypted Fallchill loader\nmsndll.dat: Encrypted Fallchill backdoor (payload for the loader)\n\n_[service]svc.dll: Fallchill backdoor loader_\n\n_[service].dat: Copy of msndll.dat_\n\nA mix of the above-mentioned files produces the final backdoor known as Fallchill. A more detailed procedure for technical specialists is as\nfollows:\n\n1. Check whether the command-line argument points to a file of 16 byte size.\n2. Read the file passed via the command-line argument. The contents of this file contains a crypto key, which we will call the main key.\n3. Open the msncf.dat file (configuration file). If the file size equals 192 bytes, read the content of the file.\n4. Open msndll.tmp file and decrypt it using the main key.\n5. Create the [service]svc.dll file and fill it with pseudo-random data.\n\n1. The malware fills the file with 10,240 bytes of pseudo-random data, and iterates (rand() % 10 + 10240) times. This is why it\n\nproduces files which are at least 104,851,000 bytes.\n6. Copy the 16-byte main key at the end of the [service]svc.dll file.\n7. Encrypt the [service].dat file name with the main key and append it at the end of [service]svc.dll.\n8. Overwrite the beginning of [service]svc.dll with data decrypted from msndll.tmp.\n9. Move msndll.dat file to [service].dat.\n10. Delete temporary files: msndll.tmp, msncf.dat, msndll.log.\n11. Timestamp [service]svc.dll and [service].dat files.\n12. Register [service]svc.dll as a Windows service.\n13. Save a copy of data from msncf.dat file in the following registry value\n\n**HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\TaskConfigs\\Description.**\n\n_Infection process diagram_\n\n\n-----\n\n### a c bac doo oade\n\nWe confirmed that the following malware was created on the infected host using the method described above:\n\nFallchill backdoor loader:\n\n**MD5: e1ed584a672cab33af29114576ad6cce**\n\n**File Size: 104,878,356 bytes**\n\n**File Type: PE32+ executable (DLL) (console) x86-64, for MS Windows**\n\n**Known file name: C:\\Windows\\system32\\uploadmgrsvc.dll**\n\n**Link time: 2018-01-18 01:56:32**\n\nEncrypted Fallchill backdoor:\n\n**MD5: d8484469587756ce0d10a09027044808**\n\n**File Size: 143,872 bytes**\n\n**File Type: encrypted data**\n\n**Known file name: C:\\Windows\\system32\\uploadmgr.dat**\n\nUpon starting, uploadmgrsvc.dll reads 276 bytes from the end of its own executable file. The first 16 bytes of this 276-byte data are used as a\ndecryption key, and the remaining 260 bytes contain the encrypted file path used by the backdoor.\n\n_Data at the end of the loader module_\n\nAfter decryption of the last 260-bytes, the malware retrieves the name or path of the file that contains the actual backdoor body in encrypted\nform.\n\n_Decrypted file name in the end of loader module_\n\nThe malware reads the specified file and decrypts it using the same decryption routine. This is how the executable code of the backdoor is\nproduced in memory and executed by the loader. Below is the meta information about the decrypted final payload in memory:\n\n**MD5: d7089e6bc8bd137a7241a7ad297f975d**\n\n**File Size: 143,872 bytes**\n\n**File Type: PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows**\n\n**Link Time: 2018-03-16 07:15:31**\n\nWe can summarize the Fallchill backdoor loading process as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Loading the Fallchill backdoor_\n\nAs mentioned previously, the final payload belongs to a Fallchill malware cluster formerly attributed to the Lazarus APT group. Upon launching,\nthis malware resolves the API function addresses at runtime, and reads the C2 server address from the registry value created during the\ninstallation stage:\n**HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\TaskConfigs\\Description**\n\nIf there is no configuration value, the malware falls back to a default C2 server address.\n\n**196.38.48[.]121**\n**185.142.236[.]226**\n\nThis is a full-featured backdoor that contains enough functions to fully control the infected host.

Of course,\nthese facts alone would not be enough to accuse Celas LLC of committing a crime.\n\n## Attribution\n\n[Kaspersky Lab has previously attributed the Fallchill malware cluster to Lazarus group when it attacked the financial sector around the world. It](https://www.slideshare.net/SeongsuPark8/area41-anatomy-of-attacks-aimed-at-financial-sector-by-the-lazarus-group-104315358/1)\n[was also confirmed by other security vendors, and the](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/a-deep-dive-analysis-of-the-fallchill-remote-administration-tool.html) [national CERT of US.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-318A)\n\n### RC4 key from the older Fallchill\n\nFallchill malware uses a RC4 algorithm with a 16-byte key to protect its communications. The key extracted from the Fallchill variant used in\nthe current attack is DA E1 61 FF 0C 27 95 87 17 57 A4 D6 EA E3 82 2B.\n\n_Current RC4 key of Fallchill_\n\nWe were able to confirm that some of older Fallchill malware variants used exactly the same RC4 key. Below are Fallchill malware samples\nthat used the same key (the compilation timestamp may indicate the date of malware creation).\n\n**MD5** **Timestamp**\n\n81c3a3c5a0129477b59397173fdc0b01 2017-05-26 23:37:04\n\n6cb34af551b3fb63df6c9b86900cf044 2017-06-09 17:24:30\n\n21694c8db6234df74102e8b5994b7627 2017-11-07 17:54:19\n\n5ad7d35f0617595f26d565a3b7ebc6d0 2015-10-24 01:52:11\n\nc501ea6c56ba9133c3c26a7d5ed4ce49 2017-06-09 03:59:43\n\ncafda7b3e9a4f86d4bd005075040a712 2017-11-07 17:54:33\n\ncea1a63656fb199dd5ab90528188e87c 2017-06-12 19:25:31\n\n6b061267c7ddeb160368128a933d38be 2017-11-09 17:18:06\n\n56f5088f488e50999ee6cced1f5dd6aa 2017-06-13 08:17:51\n\ncd6796f324ecb7cf34bc9bc38ce4e649 2016-04-17 03:26:56\n\n### Same C2 server with older Fallchill\n\nWe have confirmed that the C2 server addresses (196.38.48[.]121, 185.142.236[.]226) used in this attack have been used by the older variant\nof Fallchill.\n\n**MD5** **Timestamp**\n\n94dfcabd8ba5ca94828cd5a88d6ed488 2016-10-24 02:31:18\n\n14b6d24873f19332701177208f85e776 2017-06-07 06:41:27\n\nabec84286df80704b823e698199d89f7 2017-01-18 04:29:29\n\n\n-----\n\n_Overlap of C2 infrastructure_\n\nApparently, the attackers using the Fallchill malware continue to reuse code and C2 server infrastructure over and over again.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky Security Network, Fallchill was not the only malware used in this attack. There was another backdoor that was used by\nthe threat actor. We omit a full description of this backdoor in the current report to keep the write-up to an acceptable length, but we would like\nto highlight two important things discovered in it. First, this backdoor was created on 2018-07-12 and revealed an already familiar directory,\n“TManager”, which we previously saw in the Updater.exe application from the Cellas Trading Pro suite:\n\nH:\\DEV\\TManager\\all_BOSS_troy\\T_4.2\\T_4.2\\Server_\\x64\\Release\\ServerDll.pdb\n\nSecond, what is probably one of the most interesting findings to come from this additional backdoor was discovered hidden in hardcoded\nheaders used to communicate with C2 server. The Accept-Language HTTP header string revealed a language code associated with North\nKorea. In our experience, this is something we normally don’t see in malware.\n\nAccept-Language: ko-kp,ko-kr;q=0.8,ko;q=0.6,en-us;q=0.4,en;q=0.2\n\n_Accept-Language HTTP header value in the body of the backdoor_\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe Lazarus APT group’s continuous attacks on the financial sector are not much of a surprise to anyone. A lot of research has been done and\npublished about such attacks. However, we think this case makes a difference. Recent investigation shows how aggressive the group is and\nhow its strategies may evolve in the future.\n\nFirst of all, Lazarus group has entered a new platform: macOS. There is steadily growing interest in macOS from ordinary users, especially in\nIT companies. Many developers and engineers are switching to using macOS. Apparently, in the chase after advanced users, software\ndevelopers from supply chains and some high profile targets, threat actors are forced to have macOS malware tools. We believe that in the\nfuture Lazarus is going to support all platforms that software developers are using as a base platform, because compromising developers\nopens many doors at once.\n\nWe cannot say with full certainty whether Celas LLC was compromised and the threat actor abused it to push malware through an update\nmechanism. However, the multiple successful Lazarus attempts to compromise supply chain companies suggest that it will keep exploring this\ninfection method. From all angles, the Celas LLC story looks like the threat actor has found an elaborate way to create a legitimate looking\nbusiness and inject a malicious payload into a “legitimate looking” software update mechanism. Sounds logical: if one cannot compromise a\nsupply chain, why not to make fake one?\n\n\n-----\n\ns s ou d be a esso to a o us a d a a e up ca to bus esses e y g o t d pa ty so t a e o ot auto at ca y t ust t e code\nrunning on your systems. Neither good looking website, nor solid company profile nor the digital certificates guarantee the absence of\nbackdoors. Trust has to be earned and proven.
