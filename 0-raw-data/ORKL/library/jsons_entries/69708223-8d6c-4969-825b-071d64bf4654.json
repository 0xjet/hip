Campaign targeted air transportation and\ngovernment\n\n            - Attacker activity occurred on weekends\n\n            - In the Kuwait attack, threat actors created their own\nuser account\n\n            - The Saudi Arabia attack relied on social engineering\nto compromise victims\n\n            - The end goal of both attacks was likely data\nexploration and exfiltration\n\n\n-----\n\nIranian Chafer APT Targeted Air Transportation and Government in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\n\n## Attack Lifecycle\n\nReviewing telemetry regarding this threat, we have identified victims from two countries, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe modus operandi in these counties shares some common stages, but the attacks seem more focused and\nsophisticated on victims from Kuwait.\n\nAll the tools mentioned below will be detailed in the next section, Tools Arsenal.\n\n### Kuwait attack chain\n\nThe first signs of compromise were several reverse TCP files and PowerShell commands that executed some\nbase64 compressed code, specific to the Metasploit framework. Although difficult to speculate, it’s possible that the\nthreat actors used tainted documents with shellcodes to compromise the victim, potentially disseminated through\nspearphishing emails.\n\nOnce the victims were compromised, attackers started to bring reconnaissance tools for network scanning (“xnet.\nexe”, “shareo.exe”) and credential gathering (as “mnl.exe” or “mimi32.exe”) or tools with multiple functionalities, such\nas CrackMapExec (for users’ enumeration, share listing, credentials harvesting and so on). This arsenal of tools helped\nattackers move laterally inside the networks. Several methods were observed for this operation, either by using psexec\nfor remote service installation (also used by one of their custom tools “step-1.exe”), or through the use of RDP protocol,\na fact denoted by some unusual activity outside working hours and the presence of tools such as “rdpwinst.exe”.\n\nOnce they gained a foothold inside the company, they started to install custom modules: a modified Plink (wehsvc.exe)\ninstalled as a service, as well as a backdoor (imjpuexa.exe), which was also executed as a service on some machines.\n\nDuring our investigation, on some of the compromised stations we observed some unusual behavior performed under\na certain user account, leading us to believe the attackers managed to create a user account on the victims’ machine\nand performed several malicious actions inside the network, using that account.\n\n\n-----\n\nIranian Chafer APT Targeted Air Transportation and Government in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\n\n- Some of the tools mentioned were found in an unusual place (on the Desktop), indicating that the account was not\ncompromised.\n\n- Most activity occurs on Friday and Saturday, coinciding with the weekend in Middle East.\n\no Reviewing the incident timeline, we observed the following sequence: deployment of the modified\nPuTTY tool (“wehsvc.exe”) on one of the machines; a specific user is created four days after, on the\nsame system; the user account is created on other systems from that network, during the following\ndays;\n\n- Beside the aforementioned tools, under this user account, we also saw the rdpwinst tool, which allows multiple rdp\nsessions management, Smartftp Password Decryptor - the installer, and Navicat Premium, a database management\ntool.\n\nThe attackers kept permanent communication with the victim, either through tools with proxy functionalities\n(“mfevtpse.exe” and “mini.exe”) or through their own backdoor. As an interesting technique for C&C communication,\nwe observed that the C&C address is actually passed as a command line argument (both for some of the proxy tools\nand for the backdoor itself).\n\nSome traces indicate that the goal of the attack was data exploration and exfiltration (on some of the\nvictim’s tools such as Navicat, Winscp, found in an unusual location, namely “%WINDOWS%\\ime\\en-us-ime”, or\n_SmartFtpPasswordDecryptor were present on their systems). However, the lack of evidence, such as network logs,_\nmakes it difficult to confirm this was indeed the attacker’s final objective.\n\nA timeline of the attack for one of the organizations in Kuwait targeted by these threat actors is illustrated below.\n\n\n-----\n\nIranian Chafer APT Targeted Air Transportation and Government in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\n\n### Saudi Arabia attack chain\n\nThe case investigated in Saudi Arabia was not as elaborate, either because the attackers did not manage to further\nexploit the victim, or because the reconnaissance revealed no information of interest.\n\nWe suspect the initial compromise was achieved through social engineering. The RAT component was located in the\n_%Download% folder, which is the default folder for any download process, while its parent process was actually explorer._\n_exe; indicating that the user executed the malicious file. Also, the RAT was executed twice, with different names_\n(“drivers.exe” and “drivers_x64.exe”). The two executions were three minutes apart, which raises suspicion that the\nuser was tricked into running them.\n\nInternal network reconnaissance seems to have been performed using the “etblscanner.exe” tool. We also spotted the\nuse of three different RAT components which, according to the timeline, are not used at the same time. One of those\ncomponents, “snmp.exe”, is also present on some of the victims in Kuwait, under the name “imjpuexa.exe”, linking these\nattacks to the same threat actors.\n\nWhile this attack was not as extensive as the one in Kuwait, some forensic evidence suggests that the same attackers\nmight have orchestrated it. Despite the evidence for network discovery, we were not able to find any traces for lateral\nmovement, most probably because threat actors were not able to find any vulnerable machines.\n\nA timeline of the attack is illustrated below.\n\n\n-----\n\nIranian Chafer APT Targeted Air Transportation and Government in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\n\n## Tools arsenal\n\n### Living off the land tools\n\nThis threat actor heavily uses “the Non-Sucking Service Manager” for ensuring that its critical components, such as\nthe proxy or the RAT, are up and running. They also use Sysinternals tools, such as psexec, for lateral movement in the\nvictim’s network. In terms of preinstalled Windows tools, we spotted the use of “schtasks.exe” for ensuring persistence,\n“tasklist” for testing persistence, and “nslookup” for communication over DNS, making queries for TXT record.\n\n### Hacking tools\n\nBy analyzing reports from targeted victims, we also spotted hacking tools usually used in different stages of the kill\nchain.\n\n[Mimikatz was used with different flavors, such as SafetyKatz, or customized, as depicted by previous security](https://github.com/GhostPack/SafetyKat)\nresearchers. The credentials obtained were used with the psexec tool to gain access to specific machines, a fact\ndenoted by some Python scripts converted to executables, which make the appropriate call to psexec with plain text\ncredentials.\n\nSome infected systems also contain pieces of shellcode from the Metasploit framework, such as reverse_tcp, with the\npurpose of connecting to different internal IP addresses.\n\nAnother tool, the CrackMapExec executable for version 2.2 (found on GitHub), has functionalities such as network\nscanning and credential dumping, as well as accounts discovery or code injection.\n\n### Custom build tools\n\n##### PLINK Tool\n###### A slightly modified version of PLINK, part of the PuTTY suite, was also revealed by Bitdefender telemetry in late September 2018. It preserves the original functionality, with some key new features such as the possibility to run it as a Windows service or to uninstall the service. We believe this tool may have been used either to communicate with the CnC or to gain access to some internals machines, but found no conclusive evidence to support these scenarios. As filenames, we’ve seen only one name: “wehsvc.exe”.\n\n##### Proxy Tools\nBeside PLINK, we spotted a command line tool, written in C++, that implements a proxy. The architecture of this\napplication is straightforward, imposing the following flow:\n\n- it connects to the first available server from a given list\n\n- sends the following HTTP header “GET /CNT HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: bing.com\\r\\nUser-Agent:\nMozilla/5.0”, to indicate the beginning of the communication\n\n- waits for the server for a limited time, which will send a byte, representing a command and the associated\nmessage.\n\nThe exposed commands are for setting or viewing the proxy id, echoing, session resetting, starting a tunnel or exiting.\n\nTunneling option (also denoted by debugging strings), which is the main functionality of this component,\nimplements socks5 protocol. When this command is selected, the proxy starts a new tcp connection with the current\nserver, sending the following http header “GET /TNL HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: bing.com\\r\\nUser-Agent:\n\n\n-----\n\nIranian Chafer APT Targeted Air Transportation and Government in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\n\nOn some systems where we found this file, we noticed another proxy, different from the previous one. In terms of\nimplementation, it uses a custom protocol, which implies using a table of available connections and their ids. Those\nids are used in sending messages between hosts. Also, this one was packet by the UPX packer, version 3.03.The main\npurpose of this tool is to give the attacker access to the internal network of the victim.\n\nIn our telemetry, those files were seen with the name of “mini.exe”, “mfevtpse.exe” or “mfevtps.exe”.\n\n##### RAT Tools\nDuring the attack, we also observed the use of a command line utility, which is a RAT, written in Python (probably\nversion 3.4) and converted into a standalone executable. Interestingly, the user interacts with this tool in a similar way\nas with “mini.exe”, described in the Proxy Tools section. The same filename for default input, the common debugging\nstrings, even the help page for the two are very similar, which suggests a possible connection between the two.\n\nThis tool uses 2 types of communications (“DNS” and “HTTP”, as found in code), both over TCP, with the same\nfunctionality. They both marshal the message such that the packet will resemble a DNS, and HTTP, packet. Parts of the\nheaders that are hardcoded can be seen below.\n\n**Part of header that will be included in the request (dns communication)**\n\n**Part of header that will be included in the response (dns communication).**\n\nHeaders for http communications are “GET /owa HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: live.com” for request and “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” for\nresponse. Also, some parts of the code are specific to different operating systems, which means that this tool may be\nin the wild in other forms.\n\nFilenames for these tools found in our telemetry are “snmp.exe”, “imjpuexa.exe” and “driver_x86.exe”.\n\nOur telemetry for the same machines revealed two other files that implement RAT functionalities, besides “snmp.\nexe”and“imjpuexa.exe”.\n\n[One of them is very similar to MechaFlounder, as described by previous security research, but packing a few new](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-python-based-payload-mechaflounder-used-by-chafer/)\nfeatures. It implements a persistence mechanism (using a scheduled task, named “Defender Update”) and a custom\ncommunication protocol over DNS (besides HTTP) with the CnC, where the response is found either in the IPv4 address\nor in the TXT record.\n\nThe second file is also about persistence and features a similar mechanism for parsing commands as the previous\nfile. However, it uses the “Service Update” scheduled task name, instead of “Defender Update”. The key difference\nbetween the two files is that the latter, in this case, communicates with the CnC through files uploaded to Dropbox,\nwhere each victim has a separate folder named with the same combination of username and machine name as used\nby MechaFlounder. The command, “service.html” is placed in the root of this directory, uploaded files from the victim\n\n\n-----\n\nIranian Chafer APT Targeted Air Transportation and Government in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\n\nare placed into a folder named “/download”, and the files for download are placed into the “/upload” folder. Also, all\nfeedback messages are simplified and uploaded in the same directory, under the name “results.txt”. It also implements\na synchronization mechanism by using the folder “done”, placed in the root location for each victim.\n\nFilenames for the two RATs are: “drivers.exe” (“drivers_x64.exe” for the 64-bit version) and “dbxservice.exe”. In terms\nof persistence, both “drivers_x64.exe” and “dbxservice.exe” make a copy of themselves in the Temp folder, named\n“MSCService.exe”, or “DBXService.exe” and then create a scheduled task that will reference them in that location.\nAnother interesting thing found in the decompiled code of the two files is the use of the special Unicode character\n“202e” (Right-to-Left Override character), in the persistence section. This character is expected to be found as the first\ncommand line argument.\n\n### Scanning tools\n\nBitdefender telemetry revealed another command line tool used in this attack, “xnet.exe”, which is very similar to the\n[known nbtscan tool, except it packs an additional feature. This version of the tool also obtains the IP range to scan](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)\n(when there is no given range) from network adapters on the machine. We also observed another tool, (“shareo.exe”)\nwritten in C#, which obtains the NetBIOS name for each machine within a range of IPs.\n\nFurther investigation into our telemetry revealed a new tool (“etblscanner.exe”), implemented in Python and converted\nto a Windows executable. As the name implies, it’s an EternalBblue scanner that accepts a given range of IPs.\n\n##### Remexi tool\nFound as “mas.dll” in our telemetry, it has been previously depicted as a backdoor. Interestingly, there is a connection\nbetween this file and the “xnet.exe” tool described in the Scanning tools section above, as indicated by some very\nsimilar yet uncommon pdb paths:\n\n- “F:\\Projects\\94-06\\RCE\\bin\\Release\\x64\\mas.pdb” – in “mas.dll” tool\n\n- “F:\\Projects\\94-08\\XNet\\bin\\Release\\Win32\\XNet.pdb”) – in “xnet.exe” tool\n\nThese two tools also share common functions in their code, some of them for debugging purposes. Both have the\nsame build number, 51106, for the compiler and the linker, which is found in the Rich header, and, in the PE header they\nhave the same Major.Minor version, namely 11.0. Thus, these metadata suggest an even stronger relationship between\nthem.\n\n\n-----\n\nIranian Chafer APT Targeted Air Transportation and Government in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\n\n## MITRE matrix TTPs\n\n[https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0087/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0087/%60)\n\n### Tactic: Persistence\n\n**Technique: T1050 “New Service”:**\n\n_“wehsvc.exe” hasthe ability to create a service and “imjpuexa.exe” was spotted in the registry “HKLM\\_\n_system\\controlset001\\services\\microsoft updating\\parameters\\application”_\n\n**Technique: T1053 “Scheduled Task”:**\n\nBoth“MSCService.exe” and “DBXService.exe” use this technique\n\n**Technique: T1136 “Create Account”:**\n\nSuspicious reports from a user’s desktop folder, including similar behavior from some of the\naforementioned tools\n\n### Tactic: Discovery\n\n**Technique: T1016 “System Network Configuration Discovery”:**\n\nThe “xnet.exe” component implements nbtstat functionality for a range of addresses\n\n### Tactic: Command and Control\n\n**Technique: T1090 “Connection Proxy”:**\n\nTools in the Proxy Tools section are candidates for this technique.\n\n### Tactic: Defense Evasion\n\n**Technique: T1045 “Software packing”:**\n\nThe “mfevtpse.exe” component uses this kind of technique, leveraging the UPX packer.\n\n**Technique: T1036 “Masquerading”:**\n\nBoth “DBXService.exe” and “MSCService.exe” include instances where their name contains the special\nRLO character “\\u202e”.
