Despite using simple\nmalicious advertisements, the malware became widespread, potentially leaking data from\nthousands of users and organizations.\n\nInstead of more traditional malware like a Windows executable (.exe) or Dynamic Link\nLibrary (.dll), the malware authors used a browser extension as their final payload. The\nbrowser extension serves as adware and an infostealer, leaking all of the user’s search\nengine queries. We discovered significant changes and additions of capabilities throughout\nthis campaign's evolution, and we predict further changes as this campaign continues.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this article, we examine the technical details of this malware, focus on the evolution\nbetween its different versions and describe changes in its infection process.

Each variant contains different stages\nthroughout its infection chain, but the infection chain often looks quite similar among the\ndifferent variants, including malicious browser extensions used in all variants.\n\nThe different payload extensions we tracked had a hardcoded version added by the attacker.\nThis labeling routine contributed to the research process, linking the different versions to the\nsame campaign – and by their correct chronological order.\n\nThe various extension versions are related to different variants of this malware. We\ndifferentiate the variants not only by the related extension version but also by the techniques\nused throughout their infection chain and the targeted operating systems.\n\nThe different variants are mentioned in this article by their detection order and referenced\nthroughout this document as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Variant 0: Named that way since it was active before Variant 1 (the first variant that was**\ndiscovered in the wild). It used AutoHotKey (AHK)-compiled executables and version 1.0 of\nthe Chrome extension. Its first known attack occurred in December. In this article, this variant\nis discussed fourth (in the section titled “The Real First Windows Variant”).\n\n**Variant 1: Mentioned first (beginning in the “Infection Vector” section). It used versions 2.0-**\n4.4 of the Chrome extension as its payload and a DotNet executable that launches\nobfuscated PowerShell as its dropper. It was mainly active in January.\n\n**Variant 2: Mentioned third (see the section “Second Windows Variant”). It uses the 6.0**\nversion of the Chrome extension and uses an obfuscated executable as its initial dropper. It\nhas been active since March.\n\n**MacOS Variant: Mentioned second (see the section “MacOS Variant”). This variant focuses**\non MacOS computers (while other variants target Windows users only). Uses the 6.0 version\nof the extension. Active since March.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. The infection chain of the different variants.\n\n## Infection Vector (Variant 1)\n\nThe first variant of ChromeLoader Malware (referred to in the Introduction as Variant 1) was\nfirst seen in January 2022.\n\nThe chain of events starts when a user is enticed to download a torrent or a cracked video\ngame through malvertising campaigns on ad sites and social media platforms. The user\nscans a QR code on these web pages and is redirected to a compromised website that\npresents an ISO image (an optical disc image file, typically used with CD/DVD). The user\ndownloads the ISO image, mounts it by double-clicking and executes content contained in\nthe mounted ISO image.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. An example of a\n\nQR code posted on Twitter.\n\nFigure 3. An example of a download link to the malicious ISO image from the QR code.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe downloaded ISO image contains the following:\n\n**Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.dll: a legitimate .NET DLL signed by Microsoft, used**\nby other .NET programs for integrating with the scheduled tasks mechanism.\n**Language folders: contains a resource file used by the mentioned DLL.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**CS_installer.exe and its config file: malicious executable written by the malware**\nauthors (note that the name might change from one version to another). In some\nversions, the authors (probably accidentally) left its PDB file, containing its debug data,\ninside this folder as well\n**_meta.txt: a text file found in advanced versions of this malware, containing scrambled**\nASCII letters.\n\nMost files in this directory are hidden, and the ordinary user will not notice them when\nopening this directory using Windows File Explorer. The only non-hidden file is\nCS_installer.exe, which tempts the victim to double-click it to complete the software\ninstallation download.\n\nFigure 4. An example of a mounted malicious ISO image (after selecting “show hidden files”).\nThe victim launches CS_installer.exe by double-clicking it. In most cases, the executable\npresents the message shown below in Figure 5, indicating that the program failed to execute.\nHowever, this is an attempt by the authors to mislead their targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Message box\n\npresented by the dropper, designed to deceive the user.\nThe executable is a non-obfuscated program written in .NET, so .NET reflectors can\ndecompile it to read the source code. The code shown in Figure 6 is revealed when the\nexecutable is loaded into a reflector. This code creates a scheduled task configured to\nexecute a malicious base64 encoded PowerShell command every ten minutes. The task\nname is constructed from the Chrome string concatenated with a random suffix from the\nnamesDict array.\n\nFigure 6. An example of decompiled CS_installer.exe source code.\n\nThe script content derives from the _meta.txt file, unscrambled by the following predefined\nfunction below in Figure 7, which applies simple character replacement.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. An example of the\n\nunscramble function.\nSome of the features mentioned were missing in earlier versions of this variant of the\nmalware. For instance, in the version shown in Figure 8, which was discovered only one\nweek before the version mentioned in Figures 6 and 7, the authors did not use a descramble\nfunction but simply hardcoded the encoded PowerShell script in the .NET executable and\nused the predefined ChromeLoader name for their task instead of generating a more\nrandomized suffix.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. An example of source code from an older version of Variant 1.\nThe attacker uses the encoded PowerShell script for downloading and loading a malicious\nbrowser extension into the user’s Chrome browser.\n\nFigure 9. An example of variable definition in the PowerShell dropper.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. An example of a payload download attempt.\n\nFigure 11. An attempt to load the payload into the user’s browser.\n_Figure 11. An attempt to load the payload into the user’s browser._\n\nThe evolution from early versions of this malware to later ones is also seen in the encoded\nPowerShell script. Figure 12 shows PowerShell script executed by an earlier version of this\nvariant, which is significantly shorter and contains less complicated code.\n\nFigure 12 An example of an older version of this PowerShell dropper\n\n\n-----\n\n## Dropper Statistics\n\nChromeLoader attacks on Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR customers were blocked by our\nBehavioral Threat Protection module starting from the first day of this campaign. However,\nwe were curious about the following stages of this attack. Consequently, we decided to\ncontinue our research, tracking down the attacker’s footprints and intentions.\n\nThe scheduled task is using the malware to download a malicious Chrome extension and\ninstalling it to the victim’s browser. The URL hosting the Chrome extension is hardcoded in\nthe obfuscated PowerShell command and changes between the different versions.\n\nFigure 13. First infection attempt for installation servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Installation server connection attempts distribution.\n\nFigure 15. Blocked infections per region.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Infection attempts per day per installation server during the Variant 1’s most active\ntime.\n\n## Payload\n\nThe payload of the malware is a Chrome extension – every downloadable extension has the\nsame format:\n\nFigure 17. An example of the downloaded extension files.\nUsing some definitions in the manifest file, and using a known legitimate picture, the\nextension claims to be legitimate and harmless. However, the extension asks for elevated\nprivileges. Requested privileges include accessing browser data, manipulating web requests\nand accessing every possible URL address, which legitimate browser extensions would not\ndo.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18. An example of a downloaded extension’s manifest file.\nThe Javascript file conf.js declares constant variables, which will use the main script\nbackground.js later. The C2 domain is stored in _ExtDomNoSchema.\n\nFigure 19. An example of a downloaded extension’s conf.js file.\nbackground.js is a one-line JavaScript file containing all of the extension’s functionality; it is\nheavily obfuscated but can be converted to readable JavaScript code in a short series of\nsteps. However, any attempt to deobfuscate this code using known public JavaScript\ndeobfuscation tools will fail due to reasons which will be detailed later.\n\nFigure 20. An example of a downloaded extension’s obfuscated background.js file.\nThis script uses various obfuscation techniques to hide its purpose and malicious code. One\nof the first functions executed is responsible for copying standard JavaScript functions and\nobjects into new objects with scrambled names, which will later use the script for decoding\nthe final payload, located in this script's last instructions.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21. An example of the renaming mechanism. For instance, in this case, the String\nobject is stored as b4VV.\nDuring the entire execution of this script, the authors use switch-case-oriented programming\nto make their program harder for malware analysts to read and understand.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. An example of switch-case-oriented programming.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe program loops using the E3 variable shown above in Figure 22 and acts differently for\neach value. When the relevant flow in the switch case has ended, the program changes the\nvalue of E3 to its next instruction. The program also uses the obfuscated object names\nmentioned previously. In Figure 22, we added the original object name in a comment below\nthe relevant code line.\n\nAfter understanding the obfuscated names and switch-case-oriented programming, we can\nbetter analyze the purpose of this code section. It uses a hardcoded four-sized array of\nintegers, translating it to the associated ASCII characters and sorting it by randomized order.\nLater, this array will be joined to a string, and the program will search for a defined function in\nthat name. The execution flow will start over if the function isn’t found.\n\nThis stage reveals another obfuscation technique in the script. One of the key features used\nby standard deobfuscation tools is dropping unreferenced functions and objects. Often, it\nhelps to shorten the code, leaving out complicated parts which will never actually run –\nremoving functions whose whole purpose is to mislead a malware analyst. However, in this\ncase, using deobfuscation tools drops an essential function, and the script will be stuck in an\nendless loop without it.\n\nThe function h0QQ is not directly referenced even once during the script execution. Yet, the\npreviously mentioned code section using a randomized sort algorithm will eventually attempt\nto execute it, since h0QQ is a permutation of the 0hQQ string. If h0QQ does not exist, the\ncode simply tries to sort the characters and repeatedly looks for a function name.\n\nFigure 23. An example of the unreferenced crucial function.\nThis function returns a long scrambled string, XORed by a hardcoded key, and then splits\ninto an array of strings.\n\nFigure 24. An example of a deXORed array containing strings used by the malware.\nThe malware eventually uses these strings to decode its malicious code. It references the\nstring at the relevant index in this array instead of hardcoding the string name in the code.\n\nFigure 25. An example of the malware usage of the deXORed array to decode its final\npayload. You can also see that the malware doesn’t use integers as the array’s indexes but\nstrings combined with arithmetic operations.\nWe exported the mentioned list members after utilizing a debugger to execute the\ninitialization code. Then we used a Python script to deobfuscate the remaining sections of\nthe JavaScript code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 26. A script used for deobfuscating background.js.\n\n## Infostealer and Adware\n\nFor communicating with the malicious extension, the authors used command and control\nservers (C2s), which are different from the installation server used for installing the extension\npreviously. The malware uses various extension features, giving it a strong foothold in the\nuser’s browser.\n\nFigure 27. An example of alerts installed by the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the extension is installed, it adds two Chrome alarms (alarms allow the developer to\ninstall a callback / scheduled task that will be triggered periodically). When these alarms are\ntriggered, two corresponding functions are being called:\n\nWhen the alarm is triggered, the extension asks the C2 for an advertisement and\npresents it in a new tab.\nThe hb callback is triggering functions that communicate with the C2, informing it of the\ncurrent state of the execution.\n\nFigure 28. An example of the malware’s reaction when its alerts are triggered.\nAnother interesting activity can be seen in the code shown in Figure 29. The extension\ninstalls a listener, which allows it to intercept every outgoing request, and uses it to check\nwhether the request was sent to a search engine – Google, Yahoo or Bing. If it does, the\nextension will send the search details to the C2, leaking the victim’s thoughts and interests.\n\nFigure 29. An example of browser hijacker capability.\nIn addition, the extension uses different mechanisms to verify that it executes properly. For\nexample:\n\n\n-----\n\nA hard-coded header named dd for each outgoing packet to the C2. This could be used\nby the C2 to identify the different distribution channels/affiliates.\n\nFigure 30. An example of the added dd header.\n\nCancelling search suggestions, probably in order to make sure that the search queries\nwere intended by the user.\nUninstalling existing Chrome extensions from the browser. It also sends the names of\nthe extensions to the C2 and gets back an allowlist json, in order to exclude chosen\nextensions from being removed.\nDisabling every attempt to access chrome://extensions and open chrome://settings\ninstead to prevent the user from uninstalling this malicious extension.\n\n## Version Control\n\nMost malicious extensions contained a file named conf.js alongside the main Javascript code\nstored at background.json. This conf.js (or manifest.json, or background.js file if conf.json is\nmissing) file stores relevant configuration for the extension: the C2’s hostname (e.g.,\nkrestinaful[.]com and tobepartou[.]com), the verification header’s value of dd, the extension\nname, and its version. It seems like the version information is accurate – there are several\ndifferences between the versions we saw (2.0, 3.0, and 4(.0,.3,.4)). (For our observations on\nthe relationship between variants and versions, please see the “Introduction” section.)\n\n### Version 2.0 (First seen Jan. 4, 2022):\n\nMissing functionality:\n\nNo advertisements for victims.\nSearch engine query gathering from Google only.\nNo deletion of existing browser extensions.\n\n### Version 3.0 (Jan. 6, 2022):\n\nAdded functionality:\n\nSearch engine queries are now gathered from Yahoo and Bing as well.\nSetWithExpiry() and GetWithExpiry() functions added and used for storing variables\n(i.e., query URL) and deleting existing extensions, respectively.\nExisting extensions deletion mechanism.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 4. versions (Jan. 7, 2022):\n\nAdded functionality:\n\nMore obfuscations throughout the script.\nChrome advertising mechanism added.\nChanged the hardcoded C2 URL.\nChrome alert mechanism.\n\n## MacOS variant\n\nIn March 2022, a new variant emerged targeting MacOS users. This variant remains active\nand uses similar techniques to install its payload and hide its actions. It uses the same\ninfection method of directing victims to compromised pay-per-download websites to install its\ndropper.\n\nIn this case, the dropper is a disk image (DMG) file – the MacOS implementation for ISO files\n– containing several files, including one bash script. The bash script resembles the\nscheduled PowerShell script in multiple manners:\n\nDownloads the payload – a browser extension from a remote installation server.\nLoads the payload into the target’s browsers – Google Chrome and the built-in Safari\nbrowser.\n\nFigure 31. An example of an early version of the MacOS installation script.\nIn more advanced cases, instead of hardcoding the download execute portion in the bash\nscript, the authors encoded these commands in a separate file, then decoded and executed\nby the bash script using OpenSSL.\n\nFigure 32. An example of a later MacOS installation script.\nThe downloaded extension functions were similar to those used in the Windows OS\nversions. The MacOS variant uses the same obfuscation method to execute the same vital\ncomponents – gather search engine queries and present advertisements. In addition, new\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 addresses were used in this version.\n\nBased on the version number of the malicious extensions delivered by this variant, the\nattackers reference the MacOS variant as later than the Windows variants, which fits the\ntimeline of infections in this campaign. In our research, the extensions found with this variant\nwere labeled as the 6.0 version of this malware.\n\n## Second Windows Variant (Variant 2)\n\nIn March 2022, several weeks after the last known infection of Variant 1, we identified a new\ncampaign with multiple similarities to the first one, which makes us believe that we are\nactually facing another variant of the same ChromeLoader malware, referred to in this blog\nas Variant 2.\n\nThe infection vector for this Variant 2 is identical to Variant 1. Users are enticed to download\na torrent or cracked video game through malvertising campaigns on pay-per-install sites and\nsocial media.\n\nISO images used for Variant 2 contain new executables. Victims would only see a Windows\nshortcut, which they would double-click to install the desired software or watch the movie.\n\nFigure 33. An example of a malicious mounted ISO.\nHowever, the ISO image contains other hidden files executed when the victim launches the\nWindows shortcut (.lnk file). The .lnk file simply runs a batch script named resources.bat. The\nscript, in turn, extracts the contents of app.zip into %APPDATA%. The zip archive contains\nan executable named Tone.exe, which is eventually stored into a registry run key by the\nbatch script, making the infection persistent.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 34. An example of the LNK file configuration.\n\nFigure 35. An example of resources.bat content.\nLike Variant 1, Variant 2 installed the same type of Chrome extension. The malware\nlaunched a cmd.exe process, which in turn executed powershell.exe. The PowerShell\nprocess executed WMI queries, used for installing a new scheduled task named chrome *,\nlaunching another encoded PowerShell command.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 36. An example of a causality chain when the malware installs a scheduled task.\nWhen analyzing the above-mentioned obfuscated PowerShell script, we were faced with a\nscript used as a dropper. This script doesn’t directly install a new Chrome extension, so it\ndoes not exactly match Variant 1’s PowerShell script pattern. However, the structure and use\nof variables resembles the behavior of Variant 1.\n\nFigure 37. An example of the installed schedule task script content after decoding.\nUsing XQL queries, when the installation server is available, the PowerShell script creates\nand loads the familiar malicious Chrome extension (the 6.0 version, used in the latest\nMacOS variant).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 38. An example of the files downloaded by the encoded PowerShell.\n\n## The Real First Windows Variant – December 2021 (Variant 0)\n\nDue to its [multiple infection incidents, this malware family has drawn worldwide attention in](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/experts-warn-of-rise-in-chromeloader.html)\nthe cybersecurity community.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we detected different versions of this malware during our investigation.\nEach version was labeled not only by us but also by the malware authors themselves. The\nearliest labeled version we detected was 2.0. Therefore, we were confident that this wasn’t\nthe first time these attackers struck, and we were determined to expose the actual first\nversion of this malware.\n\nDue to the attackers’ history of frequent payload updates, we were convinced that the first\ninfection case occurred relatively close to the currently reported infection case in January\n2022.\n\nPivoting over the installation server domains used for the Variant 1 PowerShell dropper\nrevealed that another piece of malware used some of these domains as its installation\nservers in December 2021.\n\nThis malware was an executable file written using AutoHotKey (AHK) - a framework used for\nscripting automation.\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing this tool, the programmer can write short, easy-to-understand scripts using the AHK\nsyntax. Then, by the programmer’s definitions, the framework creates matching hooks that\nwill cause the execution of these scripts.\n\nWhen transforming AHK scripts into Windows executables, the original script source code is\npasted into the end of the executable, making the investigation process for the researcher\nmuch more effortless compared to the other variants, which used heavy obfuscation. In this\ncase, the hardcoded script contained the following source code, which looks quite similar to\nthe PowerShell droppers we already analyzed:\n\nFigure 39. An example of the AutoHotKey script content.\nIn short, this dropper downloads a payload from its installation server. We can assume that\nthis payload is another browser extension by the variable name used for the downloaded\npayload (Extension_Name).\n\nAfter a more thorough investigation, we found the downloaded extension. Unsurprisingly, it\nalso contained features related to the ChromeLoader malware family – but more importantly,\nit was labeled version 1.0 (!)\n\nThese extensions were quite similar to the rest of the extensions related to this family, with\none main difference – this time, the extension was not obfuscated. It even contained some of\nthe author’s comments regarding different code sections.\n\nFigure 40 An example of the extension downloaded by this variant without any changes\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom our side.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis blog documents different examples of a new malware family, ChromeLoader, spread\nusing malicious advertisements. This malware demonstrates how determined cybercriminals\nand malware authors can be: In a short time period, the authors of ChromeLoader released\nmultiple different code versions, used multiple programming frameworks, enhanced features,\nadvanced obfuscators, fixed issues, and even adding cross-OS support targeting both\nWindows and MacOS.\n\nThis malware is used for hijacking victims’ browser searches and presenting advertisements\n– two actions that do not cause serious damage or leak highly sensitive data. However,\nbased on the wide distribution the attackers gained in such a short time, they were able to\ninflict heavier damage than the damage inflicted by the two primary functions of the Chrome\nExtension.\n\nAdditionally, the authors were quite organized, labeling their different malware versions and\nusing similar techniques throughout their attack routines. This probably made their lives\neasier while developing their attack framework and maintaining their attack chains, but\nunintentionally, this also made the investigation process significantly easier. In fact, it\nimproved the research ability so much that we were able to detect two new versions of this\nmalware – the first one and the latest, which have never been linked to this malware family\nbefore.\n\nFinally, this attack chain demonstrates two rising trends among malware authors that security\nproducts and even common users should be aware of – the use of ISO (and DMG) files and\nthe use of browser extensions.\n\n## Product Coverage\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers using Cortex XDR Prevent or and Pro receive protections\nfrom such campaigns in different layers, including
