This service allows any wannabe criminal to register an account and](https://twitter.com/Xylit0l)\ncreate their very own customized version of the Satan Ransomware.\n\nOnce the ransomware is created, it is then up to the criminal to determine how they will\ndistribute the ransomware, while the RaaS will handle the ransom payments and adding new\nfeatures. For this service, the RaaS developer takes a 30% cut of any payments that are made\nby victims. According to the advertisement for the Satan RaaS, the developer will reduce\ntheir cut depending on the volume of payments received by an affiliate.\n\n**Promoting on Underground Web Sites**\n\nSource: Xylitol\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Satan RaaS\n\nWhen a person first goes to the Satan RaaS they will be greeted with a home page that\ndescribes what the service is and how a criminal can make money with it.\n\n**Satan RaaS Home Page**\n\nOnce a user registers an account and logs in, they will be greeted with an affiliate console that\ncontains various pages that they can use to help distribute their ransomware. These pages are\nthe Malwares, Droppers, Translate, Account, Notices, and Messages pages.\n\nThe first page that is shown when someone logs in is the Malwares page, which allows a\ncriminal to configure various settings of their very customized version of the Satan\nRansomware. In terms of customization, there is not really many options. A user can specify\nthe ransom amount, how much it goes up after a certain amount of the days, and the amount\nof days that the ransom payment should increase.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Satan RaaS Ransomware Generation Page**\n\nThe Droppers page, shown below, provides code that assists the affiliate in creating\nmalicious Microsoft Word macros or CHM installers. These can then be used by the affiliate\nto distribute the ransomware via SPAM or other means.\n\nThis the first time I have seen a public RaaS like this offer tips and help to the affiliates when\nit comes to distribution methods. This type of hand holding could allow a curious affiliate to\nbecome an active one.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Satan RaaS Droppers Page**\n\nThe Translate page allows affiliates to expand the languages used by Satan for the ransom\nnotes.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Satan RaaS Translation Page**\n\nThe Account page is where the affiliate can see the amount of people infected, the amount\npaid, and other information.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Satan RaaS Account Information Page**\n\nFinally there is a Notices page, which will be used to display messages from the RaaS\ndeveloper, and a Messages page that can be used for \"customer service\" requests.\n\n## As for the Satan Ransomware Itself...\n\nWhen the Satan Ransomware is installed it will check to see if it is running under a virtual\nmachine, and if it is, will terminate. Once executed it will inject itself into TaskHost.exe and\nbegin to encrypt the data on the computer. It is currently unknown what encryption\nalgorithm Satan uses, but it will target files with the following extensions:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n.incpas, .mp4, .pab, .st6, .sas7bdat, .wmv, .backup, .drf, .ibank, .3ds, .odg, .cer,\n.tif, .cs, .dotx, .7z, .png, .bak, .ibz, .db3, .pbl, .3fr, .dxf, .nk2, .bkp, .mdf,\n.svg, .xlm, .3dm, .pct, .java, .pot, .sxi, .ibd, .sxw, .pspimage, .ppt, .kbx, .ppsm,\n.ndd, .txt, .pdb, .say, .backupdb, .fla, .swf, .asx, .accdt, .mp3, .ycbcra, .erf,\n.cr2, .pfx, .potx, .qby, .sqlite, .blend, .class, .pat, .odp, .gray, .qbw, .tib,\n.thm, .htm, .mos, .rm, .key, .std, .tlg, .lua, .pst, .sqlitedb, .grey, .cdr4, .dc2,\n.ce1, .ps, .tex, .eml, .xlam, .pages, .st8, .jar, .st7, .potm, .sdf, .db-journal,\n.pcd, .aspx, .rwl, .kpdx, .fmb, .xlr, .gry, .kc2, .oil, .moneywell, .xlk, .sti,\n.accdr, .oth, .c, .xml, .nd, .mdb, .pem, .erbsql, .bpw, .ffd, .ost, .pptm, .dwg,\n.zip, .qbm, .cdx, .des, .dng, .pdd, .cfp, .nyf, .cgm, .sldm, .xla, .odf, .raf, .crw,\n.mef, .raw, .x11, .nsd, .fff, .design, .dcs, .ptx, .al, .ns2, .bik, .back, .accdb,\n.nwb, .cpi, .ads, .odt, .sqlite3, .docm, .drw, .pl, .nx2, .fpx, .rdb, .otp, .msg,\n.accde, .agdl, .php, .csv, .py, .rtf, .ach, .sda, .ddd, .asf, .dotm, .cmt, .h, .hbk,\n.xlsx, .s3db, .tga, .wav, .iif, .dxb, .sql, .db, .sd0, .bgt, .djvu, .jpg, .doc,\n.craw, .mpg, .sxd, .kdc, .jpeg, .psafe3, .flac, .dtd, .act, .qba, .vob, .cdrw, .eps,\n.bkf, .mdc, .rar, .mov, .cdf, .m4v, .ab4, .bank, .pps, .cib, .dot, .dgc, .exf, .flv,\n.xlsb, .ddrw, .adb, .srw, .plc, .csh, .xls, .fxg, .otg, .pas, .xlt, .indd, .rwz,\n.xltx, .apj, .stw, .xltm, .orf, .ott, .qbb, .max, .cls, .obj, .docx, .dcr, .cdr3,\n.qbx, .pdf, .nef, .ots, .srt, .ddoc, .rat, .phtml, .m, .dbx, .nxl, .avi, .p12, .awg,\n.dbf, .ns3, .mmw, .prf, .wallet, .rw2, .jin, .odc, .qbr, .ppsx, .ns4, .wpd, .wps,\n.nsh, .dxg, .fhd, .dac, .wb2, .nrw, .odb, .ait, .jpe, .odm, .sldx, .fdb, .acr, .war,\n.oab, .sxc, .cpp, .r3d, .hpp, .asm, .st5, .stx, .xis, .dds, .xlsm, .p7c, .cdr5, .3g2,\n.mrw, .sr2, .html, .cdr, .idx, .st4, .bdb, .kdbx, .nsg, .der, .ods, .myd, .nop,\n.ppam, .pptx, .yuv, .xlw, .mfw, .nsf, .csl, .php5, .p7b, .crt, .asp, .srf, .jsp,\n.cdr6, .sxm, .iiq, .3gp, .ce2, .arw, .bay, .ai, .sxg, .psd, .3pr, .fh, .pef, .x3f,\n.sik, .bpp, .vmdk, .spi, .bup, .cvt, .bb, .fkc, .tjl, .dbk, .swp, .fb, .vib, .dtb,\n.bke, .old, .bkc, .jou, .rpb, .abk, .sav, .bkn, .tbk, .fbw, .vrb, .spf, .bk, .sbk,\n.umb, .ac, .vbk, .wbk, .mbk\n\n```\nWhen it has encrypted a file, it will scramble its name and append the .stn extension to the\nfile. For example, test.jpg may become ahasd.stn. While encrypting files it will also create a\nransom note called HELP_DECRYPT_FILES.html in each folder that a file has been\nencrypted.\n\nWhen it has finished encrypting the computer, it will execute the\n**C:\\Windows\\System32\\cipher.exe\" /W:C command to wipe all data from the unused**\nspace on the C: Drive.\n\nFinally it will display the ransom note, which contains a unique victim ID and a URL to a\nTOR payment site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Satan Ransomware Ransom Note**\n\nWhen a victim clicks on one of the enclosed URLs they will be brought to Satan's payment\nsite where they can get payment instructions.\n\n**Satan Ransomware Payment Site**\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt the files for free.
