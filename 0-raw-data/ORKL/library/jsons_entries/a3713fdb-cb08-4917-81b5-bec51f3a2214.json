ZeuS, the wellestablished banking Trojan, uses much the same trickery to achieve the same nefarious\nends.\n\nWeighing in at just 20KB, Tinba represents a new family of banking Trojan. Antivirus\ndetection of the analyzed samples is low, according to researchers at CSIS Security, a\nDanish firm.\n\nTinba uses a RC4 encryption scheme when communication with its Command & Control\n(C&C) servers, located at four hardcoded domains. \"Tinba proves that malware with data\nstealing capabilities does not have to be 20MB of size,\" Peter Kruse, a researcher with CSIS,\ntold El Reg.\n\nHis comments reference the avalanche of publicity that has accompanied the discovery of\nthe Flame cyber-espionage toolkit, a portly 20MB chiefly notable for affecting systems in Iran\nand the ability to turn its worm like propagation routines on and off for added stealth.\n\nCSIS has a detailed write-up of Tinba [here. ®](http://www.csis.dk/en/csis/news/3566)\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n\n-----\n\nExperts: AI should be recognized as inventors in patent law\n\nPlus: Police release deepfake of murdered teen in cold case, and more\n\n[Katyanna Quach Sat 28 May 2022 // 11:23 UTC 11](http://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Katyanna-Quach)\nIn-brief Governments around the world should pass intellectual property laws that grant\nrights to AI systems, two academics at the University of New South Wales in Australia\nargued.\n\nAlexandra George, and Toby Walsh, professors of law and AI, respectively, believe\nfailing to recognize machines as inventors could have long-lasting impacts on\neconomies and societies.\n\n\"If courts and governments decide that AI-made inventions cannot be patented, the\n[implications could be huge,\" they wrote in a comment article published in Nature.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01391-x)\n\"Funders and businesses would be less incentivized to pursue useful research using AI\ninventors when a return on their investment could be limited.
