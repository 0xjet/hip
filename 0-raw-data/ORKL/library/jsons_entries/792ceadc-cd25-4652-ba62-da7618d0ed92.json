It usually functions as a downloader, which is a computer virus that collects and\nexfiltrates information from the infected device, with the purpose of assessing the target and\ndropping a more significant payload if the target seems profitable. Mainly targeting Europe,\nSload has been in active use since at least 2018, where multiple vendors have reported\nattacks on targets in the UK and Italy. The malware’s developer/s have taken a unique\napproach; instead of using an executable or a malicious document to infiltrate machines,\nthey use scripts that are native to Windows operating systems, such as VBS and PowerShell\nas an initial foothold, tricking users into executing them using spear phishing.\n\nThe downloader is actively developed and has been through several iterations; its creator is\nconstantly changing the first stage script, while the main module remains more or less\nconsistent. First reports of this malware indicate that it uses a rogue LNK file (Windows\nshortcut) to download a PowerShell script, which will eventually download and execute\nSload. Later editions begin with obfuscated WSF/VBS scripts, which are frequently mutated\nto bypass AV detection. The initial script employed in attacks repeatedly scores low on\nVirusTotal and is designed to bypass advanced security tools such as EDRs.\n\n\n-----\n\nMinerva Labs have seen Sload infections coming from Italian endpoints this year, aligning\n[with the information provided in this tweet. The script we encountered is an obfuscated WSF](https://twitter.com/luc4m/status/1391720926069235714)\nscript that decodes a set of malicious commands, and once executed, will stealthily\ndownload and run a remote payload in memory. This is achieved using a simple evasion\ntechnique, the script renames legitimate Windows binaries. Both “bitsadmin.exe” and\n“Powershell.exe” are copied and renamed, the former is used to download a malicious\nPowerShell script and the latter loads it to memory and begins its execution.\n\nThe decoded commands (commented by us):\n\nThe obfuscated WSF Script:\n\nThe final payload of this downloader varies, but it was reported to drop Ramnit and Trickbot\nbanking trojans, both of which are highly hazardous malware that may even lead to\nransomware. Minerva prevents Sload and its subsequent payloads:\n\n\n-----\n\n**References:**\n\n[https://cert-agid.gov.it/news/campagna-sload-v-2-9-3-veicolata-via-pec/](https://cert-agid.gov.it/news/campagna-sload-v-2-9-3-veicolata-via-pec/)\nhttps://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/377/BitdefenderWhitepaper-WMI-creat4871-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf\n[https://www.cybereason.com/blog/banking-trojan-delivered-by-lolbins-ramnit-trojan](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/banking-trojan-delivered-by-lolbins-ramnit-trojan)\n[https://yoroi.company/research/the-sload-powershell-threat-is-expanding-to-italy/](https://yoroi.company/research/the-sload-powershell-threat-is-expanding-to-italy/)\n[https://www.vkremez.com/2018/08/lets-learn-in-depth-into-latest-ramnit.html](https://www.vkremez.com/2018/08/lets-learn-in-depth-into-latest-ramnit.html)\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/sload-and-ramnit-pairing-sustainedcampaigns-against-uk-and-italy\n[https://twitter.com/luc4m/status/1391720926069235714](https://twitter.com/luc4m/status/1391720926069235714)\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/01/21/sload-launches-version-2-0starslord/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/12/12/multi-stage-downloader-trojansload-abuses-bits-almost-exclusively-for-malicious-activities/\n\n**IOCs:**\n\n**URLs:**\n\nhttp://milanospizzaofavemaria[.]com/\n\n**Hashes:**\n\n3AFFBFB7E5CBC4CE9D4F149F0EC826F9932AFFD83CF5F77A1BDE334EB3A37D49\n\n\n-----",
