But something began\nto shift in the incident response business, starting in early 2020.\n\n\"What happened was we got pulled into a very large incident -- it was a Nasdaq-traded\ncompany that suffered a very large breach,\" he said. \"We had detected the threat and alerted\nthem, and they brought in their own incident response firm and then brought us back in after\nthe fact.\"\n\nCyber insurance carriers typically have lists or \"panels\" of approved vendors for various\nincident response services that address breaches and ransomware attacks, including\nransomware negotiations. In this case, according to Minder, the victim had just one company\nfor ransomware negotiations on its panel, and that company was \"completely overwhelmed\"\nwith demand at the time. As a result, GroupSense stepped in and conducted the negotiations\nwith the threat actors, which opened the door for future engagements with that carrier.\n\nSoon, the company took on other negotiation jobs. As a result, GroupSense launched\ndedicated services for ransomware negotiations last September. Minder said he was\nconducting three to five negotiations a week after the launch.\n\nNot too long ago, ransomware negotiations were viewed by many as a largely unscrupulous\n[endeavor performed by shady ransomware recovery firms that would claim to decrypt](https://features.propublica.org/ransomware/ransomware-attack-data-recovery-firms-paying-hackers/)\n[victims' data when in fact they were covertly paying the ransoms behind the scenes.](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Should-companies-pay-ransomware-and-is-it-illegal-to)\n\n[But times have changed. Ransomware attacks have steadily increased, as have the ransom](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/podcast/Risk-Repeat-Will-the-Ransomware-Task-Force-make-an-impact)\ndemands, which infosec experts say routinely reach seven figures. Experts also say many\nvictims, even those with proper backups to restore encrypted data, are now opting to pay\nransoms to prevent any exposure of stolen data.\n\nThose factors have driven up demand for incident response specialists who can delay a\npressing payment deadline and negotiate a million-dollar demand down to $200,000. Here's\nhow they do it.\n\n## The negotiators\n\nKaren Sprenger is COO of LMG Security, an infosec consultancy based in Missoula, Mont.,\nbut her unofficial title is \"chief ransomware negotiator.\" She fell into this role about three\nyears ago when ransomware incidents became increasingly common. At that time,\nnegotiating with ransomware threat actors wasn't nearly as common as it is today.\n\n\"I've started to see more clients request ransomware negotiations, and I think part of the\nreason for that is we're seeing more of the data extortion component,\" Sprenger said.\n\"Before, customers could say 'I've got backups; I don't need to pay because I can restore my\ndata.'\"\n\n\n-----\n\nBut that has changed now with data theft and exposure tactics, which Sprenger said have\nled to an increase in negotiations for LMG.\n\nKevin Kline, COO of infosec consultancy Aggeris Group in Essex, Conn., has also seen a\nsteep rise in ransomware attacks, hefty ransom demands and more victims who are willing to\npay. Before joining Aggeris Group in 2019, Kline spent nearly 30 years with the FBI, most\nrecently serving as assistant special agent in charge of the New Haven, Conn., field office.\n\nKline said it's hard to determine the full scope of ransomware attacks today. Earlier this\nmonth, the FBI's [Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) annual report showed a significant](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252498133/FBI-IC3-reports-ransomware-numbers-are-low-experts-say)\nincrease in ransomware incidents in 2020, as well as financial losses -- 2,474 complaints\nreported to IC3 and losses of more than $29 million, compared with 2,047 complaints and\njust $9 million in losses the year prior.\n\nThe IC3 routinely discloses that its ransomware data is \"artificially low\" for a variety of\nreasons. But like other infosec professionals, Kline said he believes the IC3 report numbers\nare extremely low and don't provide an accurate picture of the problem.\n\n\"In a number of instances, companies that are subject to ransomware attacks do not want to\nreport the matter for a number of reasons: Preventing the public from knowing and\nundermining confidence in their brand or stock, the ability to handle themselves with support\nfrom another company and the inclusion of an NDA, or the fear of having a government\nentity inside of their network and systems all lead to companies underreporting both the\nattacks and the amount of loss,\" Kline said.\n\nRather than report attacks to law enforcement, which typically don't have the time or qualified\npersonnel to resolve incidents within short windows and tight deadlines, businesses often\noutsource at least part of the remediation effort to incident response firms like Aggeris Group\nto quickly -- and discreetly -- address the problem in an expedited manner. And in many of\nthese cases, Kline said, clients opt to pay the ransoms.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansom\n\ndemands like this one from REvil often give victims and negotiators a deadline before\ndemands are doubled and stolen data is exposed.\n\nLike Sprenger, Kline said he believes the data thefts and exposure threats have led to a rise\nin payments. But paying isn't necessarily the right strategy, since you're left to trust\ncybercriminals to destroy the stolen data.\n\n\"It's more about the appearance of showing that you did everything you could to protect\ncustomer data,\" Sprenger said.\n\nAnother contributor to the rising number of paid ransoms is cyber insurance; more\n[enterprises have policies that will cover the price of most ransoms, and the threat actors](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-find-ransomware-cyber-insurance-coverage)\nknow it. \"There seems to be an understanding [from attackers] that a lot of companies have\ncyber insurance and that the policies will pay for the ransom,\" Kline said.\n\nThese trends have put negotiations services in higher demand, but Minder said it's not an\neasy business. For one, negotiation services don't generate a lot of revenue. When\nGroupSense was building its offering, there were suggestions that compensation for\nnegotiation services be a percentage of the paid ransom.\n\n\"The problem with that is it ripe for fraud between me and the bad guys,\" Minder said, adding\nthat GroupSense instead charges an hourly rate as part of its incident response services.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother challenge for negotiators is that threat actors can simply go nuclear, as Minder\nsaid, by doubling an already-high ransom demand or exposing stolen data on the internet.\n\n[For example, threat actors who attacked Acer with REvil ransomware last week broke off](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252498156/Acer-hit-by-apparent-attack-from-REvil-ransomware-group)\ntalks with a negotiator working on behalf of the computer maker and refused to lower their\ndemand of $50 million. The threat actors later threatened to launch DDoS attacks against the\ncompany, claiming such attacks would continue for years.\n\n\"If a threat actor decides to go nuclear during a negotiation, then that may reflect poorly on\nus,\" Minder said.\n\n## Let's make a deal\n\nRansomware negotiations can vary from incident to incident, but there are some\ncommonalities. For example, all three negotiators say threat actors are usually willing to at\nleast discuss lowering their demands.\n\nFor GroupSense, 100% of the negotiations so far have resulted in lower payments, Minder\nsaid. Ransom demands often start out at \"exorbitant\" prices, he said, but they can be\nnegotiated down to more reasonable levels or reduced by at least 10%.\n\nLMG had a recent case where attackers initially demanded $800,000. When Sprenger simply\nasked if the attackers were open to negotiating, the ransom was immediately dropped to\n$600,000. \"I didn't even have to name a price at that point,\" she said.\n\nBefore negotiations start, the incident response firms must first discuss the incidents with\ntheir clients. What starts as a technical discussion about the specifics of the attack then\nbecomes a business discussion about whether to pay.\n\n\"Incident response starts with the 1s and 0s and the type of encryption the ransomware is\nusing,\" Kline said. \"If the client is truly locked out of their systems, then we go to the client\nand ask what it means to them in terms of lost access, downtime and reputation.\"\n\nSprenger said there are occasional cases where victims that have proper backups in place\nchoose to pay the ransoms -- even when no data has been stolen -- because they believe it's\nthe fastest way to recover from the attack (LMG does not recommend that approach). But\ntypically, the decision to pay or not is largely based on whether systems can be restored from\nbackups and if confidential data has been stolen.\n\nOnce the decision to pay a ransom has been made by the client, the negotiators contact the\nthreat actors. Previously, ransomware gangs used email, but most of the well-known,\nsuccessful groups now have \"customer service\" portals for live chats.\n\n\n-----\n\nEstablishing trust with the threat actors is key, Minder said, and part of that is being upfront\nabout who you are and what you're doing. \"We never tell the threat actors who we are, but\nwe tell them we are a third party negotiating on behalf of the customer.\"\n\nThe negotiators, meanwhile, must assess the threat actors and ask some key questions.\nDoes this ransomware group have a history of decrypting systems after payment, or is its\ntrack record spotty? Is the threat actor an operator of this ransomware group, or a random\naffiliate that purchased the ransomware code on a dark web market? Has the group exposed\nvictims' data even after they've received ransom payments?\n\nAnd while ransom demands can vary wildly from victim to victim and gang to gang, Kline said\nthese days, the numbers tend to be very large and sometimes based on the victim's brand or\ntype of industry. \"The bad guys always go high for ransoms now,\" he said. \"They'll know\ngenerally what industry a company is in, like healthcare, but maybe not the specifics like how\nmuch cash on hand they have.\"\n\nSprenger said in some cases, LMG has found certain ransomware groups scanning victims'\nfiles for balance sheets and cyber insurance information. In one case, the threat actors\ngained access to the victim's cyber insurance policy and knew that the maximum ransom\npayment the policy would cover was $2 million; as a result, the threat actors settled for a\n$1.95 million payment.\n\nAs with almost all ransomware negotiations, time is critical. Victims are often given deadlines\n-- sometimes as long as a week, sometimes as little as 24 hours -- to respond and/or pay\nransoms. And often, ransom notes drop on what LMG calls \"Forensic Fridays\" because, as\n[threat researchers have noted, attackers like to strike on or just before the weekend.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/they-come-in-the-night-ransomware-deployment-trends.html)\n\nWhile the ticking clocks can add pressure for victims and negotiators, Kline said it can\nsometimes be used to their advantage.\n\n\"If we get a big ransom demand, $1 million or more, and we counter with 'We can pay you\n$100,000 in an hour,' they usually take it,\" he said. \"Taking a quick cash payment is more\nattractive to them than negotiating for days or even weeks and waiting for cyber insurance\npayments for $250,000 or $500,000 demands that they ultimately may not get.\"\n\n## Obstacles and questions\n\nNegotiations can sometimes turn tense, especially when threat actors are unwilling to\nnegotiate or asked to provide substantial evidence they've actually stolen a significant\namount of sensitive data. Minder said negotiators have to get a feel for the threat actor and\nan accurate read on the tone of the conversation, which can be difficult.\n\n\"It's a soft skill,\" he said of negotiations. \"It's not easily taught.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are also potential language barriers. Kline said most of Aggeris Group s negotiations\nare with threat actors who appear to be non-native English speakers, based on email\nexchanges and chat conversations. And most attackers are willing to negotiate a lower\npayment, though occasionally they'll terminate communications and move on to other\nvictims.\n\nThe negotiators said nearly all threat actors follow through with decryption upon payment,\nthough Sprenger said LMG has sometimes run into cases where the encryption used by\nspecific ransomware variants has trouble with SQL databases, for example. And\noccasionally, the decryptors will contain hidden backdoors and other malware.\n\nNegotiators\n\nsay most ransomware threat actors view their operations as a business and will agree to\ndecrypt data upon payment.\n\nBut even though the majority of attackers provide decryptors, a nagging question remains for\nnegotiators: Do the threat actors actually destroy victims' data? Sprenger said she's seen no\nindication that any of the attackers she's dealt with have gone back on their promises and\nsold or exposed victims' data after a payment. But she's not convinced it hasn't happened.\n\n\"I think it's a little too soon to tell,\" Sprenger said. \"It's a money-making opportunity, so I\nwouldn't be surprised if they sold the data.\"\n\n[Sprenger cites Uber's notorious breach in 2016, which was covered up by several](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252488361/The-Uber-data-breach-cover-up-A-timeline-of-events)\nexecutives, as evidence that hackers can't be completely trusted. Last August, the\n[Department of Justice announced former Uber CSO Joe Sullivan had been indicted on two](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252487955/Former-Uber-CSO-charged-over-hush-money-payment-to-hackers)\n\n\n-----\n\n[criminal counts in connection with the attempted cover-up of the breach.](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252487955/Former-Uber-CSO-charged-over-hush-money-payment-to-hackers)\n\nSullivan and others were accused of paying $100,000, disguised as a bug bounty payment,\nto two individuals who obtained Uber's corporate data from an Amazon S3 bucket. The two\nindividuals, who pled guilty to extortion for the hack in 2019, agreed to delete the stolen data\nin exchange for the payment; however, they didn't inform Uber that a third, unnamed\nindividual was also involved in the breach and had apparently kept their own copies of Uber's\ndata.\n\nAt the end of the day, Minder said, it's up to the client to make the final decision. Some\nGroupSense clients are large enterprises that have a CISO as well as outside counsel,\nbreach coaches, incident response vendors and cyber insurance representatives all sitting at\nthe table and providing feedback, while other clients are small and midsize businesses like a\nregional dairy farm that has a single IT operations manager. But ultimately, it's the company\ndecision, and Minder tries to provide guidance to reach the best possible outcome.\n\nThere are no guarantees threat actors will keep their word, he said, but \"these guys are\nbasically running a business, and if they don't honor the agreement, then eventually no one\nis going to pay.\"\n\n## Potential bans on payments?\n\nA new wrinkle for ransomware negotiations arrived last fall when the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control's (OFAC) [issued an advisory concerning](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory_10012020_1.pdf)\nransomware payments. In short, OFAC said making payments to entities on the U.S.\nsanctions list is against the law and could result in civil penalties such as fines.\n\nWhile there was no policy change -- prohibiting ransom payments to sanctioned entities had\nbeen a longstanding regulation -- experts saw the advisory as an effort by the federal\ngovernment to discourage such actions amid a rise in overall ransom payments.\n\nThe negotiators said paying ransoms has become much more common. Sprenger attributed\nthe rise to the additional threat of data theft and exposure. The majority of clients for LMG\nhave cyber insurance policies -- around 80%, which is far higher than just two years ago.\nAnd most policies will cover a ransomware payment.\n\nMinder said he wasn't surprised by the advisory, but he saw it as a \"CYA move\" from the\ngovernment that adds a complicated piece of the negotiation puzzle.\n\nSprenger said the OFAC sanctions list is a concern that negotiators and IR providers must\nconsider. It's a routine part of the process to check the list and making sure the\ncryptocurrency wallet isn't on there.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut the larger concern is that, as the ransomware situation grows worse, the government\nmay try to restrict or even ban ransomware payments. For example, Ciaran Martin, former\nhead of the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre, said paying ransoms incentivizes further\nattacks and [suggested banning such payments.](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Is-it-time-to-ban-ransomware-insurance-payments)\n\nMinder said banning payments isn't the solution. \"I agree -- it's subsidizing and encouraging\nthe behavior,\" he said. \"But to simply say 'Don't do it,' that doesn't solve the actual problem. It\nseems pretty tone-deaf.\"\n\nHe added that too many companies will be harmed and potentially put out of business if\npayments are outlawed. If the government institutes a ban, Minder said, then it will have to\noffer some kind of financial assistance or relief program for victims.\n\nEven if the U.S. government put some sort of ban in place, Kline said he doesn't believe it\nwill do much good. If the decision for a company is paying an illegal ransom or shutting down\ncompletely, then it will find a way to make the payment to stay afloat. Then the government\nwill be in a thorny situation of deciding whether it wants to investigate those companies and\nhow to penalize them.\n\n\"I don't think that's feasible,\" Kline said. \"It sounds good on paper, but it doesn't seem\nenforceable in reality.\"\n\nFor now, the OFAC advisory is merely a reminder, but Sprenger and others are bracing for a\nfuture where their jobs as ransomware negotiators become even more complicated.\n\n\"The advisory didn't really change anything,\" she said. \"But I would not be surprised if we\nstart to see sanctions at the federal level.\"\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n[What is extortionware?
