The Ransomware\nRoundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware\nlandscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants.\n\nThis latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Play ransomware.\n\n**Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows**\n\n**Impacted parties: Microsoft Windows Users**\n\n**Impact: Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryption**\n\n**Severity level: High**\n\n## Play Ransomware Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nPlay is a relative newcomer to the ransomware game, having been detected for the first time\nin June 2022. In this report, Play refers to both the group developing and distributing it and\nthe name of the ransomware executable. Like many other operators in this space, Play has\nadopted the double-extortion methodology of encrypting endpoints and/or other infrastructure\nof value within an organization and then threatening to release exfiltrated data from those\nmachines on the internet if a ransom is not paid.\n\n## Play Ransomware Infection Vector\n\nPlay has been seen to use a number of common methods to gain access to an environment,\nincluding phishing, valid compromised accounts, and exposed RDP (Remote Desktop\nProtocol) servers. Once a beachhead has been established, LOLBINS (Living Off the Land\nBinaries) are used to explore and then prepare the ground to execute malware on machines\nof interest.\n\n## Play Ransomware Executable\n\nThe ransomware executable is Microsoft Visual C++ based and contains several antidebugging and anti-analysis features to slow investigations into the activity of the malware.\nThese features include garbage code (untethered instructions that serve no useful purpose)\nand function returns that drive execution into a dead end.\n\nFigure 1. Garbage code in the Play executable.\n\n## Play Ransomware Execution\n\nWhen launched, the ransomware encrypts all files of interest, such as personal and\noperational documents (it does not touch system files), and leaves them with a “.PLAY”\nextension.\n\nFigure 2. Files encrypted by Play.\n\nWhen encryption is complete, a ransom note named “ReadMe.txt” is added to the root of the\nprimary drive (e.g., C:\\). This note contains a link to the group’s TOR pages and a contact email address.\n\nFigure 3. Play ransom note.\n\nThe “Play News” landing page lists the companies allegedly impacted by Play and a\ncountdown to the possible release of any data gathered by them. Organizations that have\nrefused to pay also have links to their data posted here.\n\nThere is also a contact portal where the group can be reached, an “FAQ” section that broadly\ndescribes what the group has done, and steps for victims to take to restore their data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Play TOR News countdown page.\n\nFigure 5. Play TOR “News” contact page.\n\nFigure 6. Play TOR “News” FAQ page.\n\nAs of this writing, the “Play News” page lists seven active victims currently being threatened.\nThe regional breakdown of the victims is below:\n\nFigure 7. Active Victim Counts by Region\n\nThe regional breakdown of victims whose stolen data was leaked is as follows:\n\nFigure 8. Previous Victim Counts by Region\n\nBased on this information, the Play ransomware threat actors appear to target victims\nregardless of their region. The one caveat is that enterprises in former Soviet states do not\nappear to be listed on “Play News”, although this may be coincidental.\n\n## Fortinet Protection\n\nFortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through FortiGuard’s\nWeb Filtering, AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows:\n\nFortiGuard Labs detects known Play ransomware variants with the following AV signatures:\n\nW32/Filecoder.PLAY!tr.ransom\nW32/Filecoder_PLAY.B!tr\nW32/Filecoder.OLT!tr.ransom\nW32/Filecoder.NHQDTEZ!tr.ransom\nRiskware/Filecoder_PLAY\nW32/PossibleThreat\n\n## IOCs\n\n**File-based IOCs:**\n\n**SHA256**\n\nf18bc899bcacd28aaa016d220ea8df4db540795e588f8887fe8ee9b697ef819f\n\ne641b622b1f180fe189e3f39b3466b16ca5040b5a1869e5d30c92cca5727d3f0\n\n\n-----\n\n608e2b023dc8f7e02ae2000fc7dbfc24e47807d1e4264cbd6bb5839c81f91934\n\n006ae41910887f0811a3ba2868ef9576bbd265216554850112319af878f06e55\n\ne4f32fe39ce7f9f293ccbfde30adfdc36caf7cfb6ccc396870527f45534b840b\n\n8962de34e5d63228d5ab037c87262e5b13bb9c17e73e5db7d6be4212d66f1c22\n\n5573cbe13c0dbfd3d0e467b9907f3a89c1c133c774ada906ea256e228ae885d5\n\nf6072ff57c1cfe74b88f521d70c524bcbbb60c561705e9febe033f51131be408\n\n7d14b98cdc1b898bd0d9be80398fc59ab560e8c44e0a9dedac8ad4ece3d450b0\n\ndcaf62ee4637397b2aaa73dbe41cfb514c71565f1d4770944c9b678cd2545087\n\nf5c2391dbd7ebb28d36d7089ef04f1bd9d366a31e3902abed1755708207498c0\n\n3e6317229d122073f57264d6f69ae3e145decad3666ddad8173c942e80588e69\n\ndd101db5d9503f33a0c23d79da3642e999375748f7c1532e98c813b114bdfa1a\n\n47c7cee3d76106279c4c28ad1de3c833c1ba0a2ec56b0150586c7e8480ccae57\n\n703075181922eb8db8d23279eaed8f7263dfa2b64383cff675da4cedc2394af5\n\nf39d6741cbb99a81decbe5e75c07e846b5a36b40bc1bb0c0c61415300cc43b6c\n\n8d94028bfaac5bef84c56b01f40e429ae4cdf799b2b755dfba9eee3b72448b5b\n\nf0a3047e9d557e2150501e302d5e96a1c2669858fb0072f97024fe0dd07d5271\n\n8556dfe5582a5647a5e96cd77e6239874504a01a9c7b9e512e70329ec6f61aea\n\n5e94626c6bcb825acede3826811ed693644d6dbb7caeeefb8575c2ec711a65a6\n\n\n-----\n\na29e20d89e8c933e05b690b2779f82716fb31f688594b99d868e4382058caa8f\n\n757524b09e5d4f2399172c4ac0f6996ec34dec90110542973d438d5370aff280\n\n3a36e917a4a6587290a393d5b10d0bd42f99cf0c72a2e7de751a4bfaeb9d30c5\n\n92f3abed62d710064a19f2a50c4482cd02adfd821ace4c2f3030f96290166189\n\n157c43a3a4e014827e42cf4dd20cc8efa71cdf098f5d1d04b6cd1a972d6a8c7a\n\n5eca08ddca898427de5ab13fedf25426102c3a0621d086b63f2e37d2d04ba3e9\n\n2b4111121fb35b46665c42e3ea2cf1b8eda5afce580e310465cb259bb1abd053\n\n12d1a0dc37d877dbf81bd18e8bd57b2843cc254c9a3cfcbecb70305612e60cae\n\nbb51255ec929ae1fb34981b8b988769027ee49e68c0958a4a2a76b59a0dc1cff\n\n51f44e31b0f3718a5d145a1f77fd79cbd7ff21fecf8bba3181fea019b508cfeb\n\n73e19be4da76bb4e52cb82493c75690977fc3a5f589a9b47e834362545ef512a\n\nbbd84d10f6a56bfeca23fd5d11d9e370fdfa91be73aa60c9d460b2671145c109\n\n0ed328af77f2576071bfd543938fc01101daac01f216dc43bc091a8da4aff18d\n\nf054f373cead893f868fd9b4acc24f751afefbb80cf961e305f97741f952a641\n\n176476f9d924d83343a51a90ade097d12b7594dc5dbca1771c440047dfbe81eb\n\n957a6aee2437a5c4d31372af2f6bceb29e1c7a49d650fe207cefc624bf6bca82\n\n2e9126dfad03bdaf54f9b29ade42038c83f65ac7288376f45768901660f62d7b\n\n2ab190542c3ec7b2b6e6d4bccce4c5d6a572f98c6bc89b014fea0c8fd6db6723\n\n\n-----\n\n## FortiGuard Labs Guidance\n\nDue to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an\norganization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date.\n\nSince the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider\nleveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing\nthreats:\n\nThe [FortiPhish Phishing Simulation Service uses real-world simulations to help organizations](https://www.fortinet.com/products/phishing-simulation)\ntest user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper\npractices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks.\n\nOur FREE [NSE training:](https://training.fortinet.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=nse-institute) [NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness includes a module on](https://training.fortinet.com/local/staticpage/view.php?page=nse_1&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=nse-1)\ninternet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from\nvarious types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs.\n\nOrganizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and\nsecurity of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk\nof ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce\ntelecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere.\n[Cloud-based security solutions, such as SASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/sase?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=sase)\nendpoint security, such as [EDR (endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt](https://www.fortinet.com/products/endpoint-security/fortiedr.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiedr)\n[malware mid-attack; and Zero Trust Access and network segmentation strategies that restrict](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/network-access.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=zero-trust-network-access)\naccess to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated\nto minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack.\n\n[As part of the industry's leading fully integrated Security Fabric, delivering native synergy and](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/security-fabric.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=security+fabric)\nautomation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of\ntechnology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our\nglobal FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts.\n\n## Best Practices include Not Paying a Ransom\n\n[Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, the FBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware)\npaying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered.\nAccording to a U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\nadvisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional\norganizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit\nactivities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by\n[ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaint page where victims can submit samples](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Ransomware)\nof ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).\n\n\n-----\n\n## How Fortinet Can Help\n\nFortiGuard Labs’ [Emergency Incident Response Service provides rapid and effective](https://www.fortinet.com/support/support-services/fortiguard-security-subscriptions/incident-response)\nresponse when an incident is detected. And our Incident Readiness Subscription\nService provides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through\nreadiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop\nexercises).\n\n_Learn more about Fortinet’s_ _[FortiGuard Labs threat research and intelligence organization](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=fglabs)_\n_[and the FortiGuard AI-powered security services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/security-as-a-service/fortiguard-subscriptions?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=services)_\n\n\n-----",
