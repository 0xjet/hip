In some cases, victims were asked hundreds of thousands for data\ndecryption.\n\n[One of their most publicized victims is the Washinton DC's Metropolitan Police Department](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dc-police-confirms-cyberattack-after-ransomware-gang-leaks-data/)\n(MPD). This attack likely pushed the threat actor into announcing its retirement from the\n[ransomware business only to adopt another extortion model that did not include encryption.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-quits-ransomware-encryption-focuses-on-data-theft-extortion/)\n\n[The gang also announced plans to release their malware so that other cybercriminals could](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-ransomware-readies-shut-down-post-plans-to-open-source-malware/)\nstart a ransomware-as-a-service operation. The threat actor kept its promise and published\nits builder, a tool that generates customized ransomware.\n\n[Security researcher Kevin Beaumont found it on VirusTotal and shared the information to](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1409117153182224386)\nhelp the infosec community with detection and decryption.\n\nAfter shutting down in April, the gang took the name PayLoad Bin, but their leak site shows\nlittle activity. Instead, a new leak site emerged on the dark web carrying the Babuk\nransomware markings.\n\nThe site lists fewer than five victims that refused to pay the ransom and that they have been\nattacked with a second version of the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nsource: [MalwareHunterTeam](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1410614992718553095)\n\n\n-----\n\nIt appears that Babuk has not given up the encryption-based extortion game. They released\nonly the old version of their malware and created a new one to get back into the\nransomware business.\n\nThe gang made this clear in a comment to our article about a rush of ransomware attacks\nthat used the leaked Babuk builder and demanded .006 bitcoins (currently about $200) clearly showing that it’s not the original group using it.\n\nIt appears that the Babuk gang is not ready to give up the file-encryption activity and will\ncontinue to focus on corporate networks for larger payments.\n\nIt is unclear what drove the group to return to their old practices but given how empty the\nPayLoad Bin leak site is, one can speculate that data theft extortion did not go too well.\n\nAlso, it remains unknown at the moment if the new Babuk operation has behind it the same\nmembers that attacked Washinton DC's Metropolitan Police Department or this incident\nproduced a split.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[Babuk Locker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/babuk-locker/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
