Significant\npeaks in activity occurred between February/March, notably kicking off during the start of the\nRussian-Ukrainian conflict at the end of February, and between June/July; attributed to\nEmotet’s usage alongside post-Conti groups such as Quantum and BlackCat.\n\n\n-----\n\n_It is notable that the most Emotet-targeted country is the United States, making up 35.7% of_\n_the dataset, with Finland (10.3%), Brazil (9.9%), The Netherlands (9.4%), and France (7.7%)_\n_in the remaining top placements._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Emotet botnet (also known as SpmTools) has fueled major cybercriminal groups as an\ninitial attack vector, or precursor, for numerous ongoing attacks. From November 2021 to\nConti’s dissolution in June 2022, Emotet was an exclusive Conti ransomware tool, however,\nthe Emotet infection chain is currently attributed to Quantum and BlackCat.\n\nEmotet is a botnet of Eastern European origin that was originally designed as a banking\ntrojan, meant to steal sensitive banking information by intercepting internet traffic. However,\nupdates to Emotet over time have significantly increased the threat that it poses, and it has\nevolved into a prominent, invasive malware loader, largely due to its ability to conduct a full\ninfection cycle and seamlessly spread other types of malware. Since its appearance in 2014,\nEmotet has proved to be a consistent and highly threatening malware that has targeted\nindividuals, companies, municipalities, and governments alike.\n\nThe observed botnet taxonomy attacker flow for Emotet is Emotet -> Cobalt Strike ->\n**Ransomware Operation. What this means is that currently, the way that threat actors**\nprimarily utilize Emotet is as a dropper, or downloader for a Cobalt Strike beacon, which\ndeploys a payload allowing threat actors to take over networks and execute ransomware\noperations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_An infographic depicting the progression of Emotet’s place in the now-dissolved Conti’s_\n_attacker flow, placed within a larger cluster of other “malware loader” and “backdoor”_\n_software. Threat actors that were previously affiliated with the Conti group continue to utilize_\n_its toolkit, which includes the Emotet botnet._\n\n**Adversarial Assessment Summary [Emotet]**\n\n**[Emotet [Threat Group]](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-280a)**\n\nMalware Type: Botnet/ Loader-as-a-Service (LaaS)\n\nOrigin: Eastern Europe\n\nIntelligence Source: High Confidence\n\nFunctionality:\n\nPayload delivery\n\n\n-----\n\nData exfiltration\n\nCredential harvesting\n\nDistribution:\n\nEmail Phishing\n\nPersistency: High\n\nInfection Rate: High\n\n**_Threat Assessment: Critical_**\n\n**Emotet Patterns [MITRE ATT&CK Framework]:**\n\n_The following techniques (framed within MITRE ATT&CK categorizations) are a small sample_\n_of those utilized by Emotet (for a full list, click_ _[here).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/software/S0367/)_\n\n**Technique** **Use**\n\n\nAccount Discovery:\nEmail Account\n\n​Brute Force: Password\nGuessing\n\nCredentials from\nPassword Stores:\nCredentials from Web\nBrowsers\n\nEmail Collection: Local\nEmail Collection\n\nExfiltration Over C2\nChannel\n\nProcess Injection:\n[Dynamic-link Library](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1055/001/)\nInjection\n\n\nEmotet may attempt to get a listing of email addresses and\naccounts, or dump Exchange address lists such as global\naddress lists (GALs).\n\n​With no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the\nsystem or environment, Emotet may guess passwords to attempt\naccess to the account.\n\n​Emotet may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading\nfiles specific to the target browser.\n\nEmotet may target user email on local systems to collect\nsensitive information.\n\n​Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing\ncommand and control channel.\n\nEmotet may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes in\norder to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly\nelevate privileges.\n\n\n-----\n\nUser Execution:\nMalicious File\n\n\nEmotet may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to\ngain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to\nget them to open a file that will lead to code execution.\n\n\n**_For more on Emotet botnet telemetry, please reach out to support@advintel.tech._**\n\n\n-----",
