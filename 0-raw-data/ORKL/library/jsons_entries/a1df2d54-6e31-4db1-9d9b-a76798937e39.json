Ransomware gang also threatened to leak the source code of Watch Dogs: Legion, an\nupcoming Ubisoft game.\n\nWritten by Catalin Cimpanu, Contributor on Oct. 15, 2020\n\n[A ransomware gang going by the of Egregor has leaked data it claims to have obtained from the internal networks of two of today's largest](https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1307056098596335628)\ngaming companies — Ubisoft and Crytek.\n\nData allegedly taken from each company has been published on the ransomware gang's dark web portal on Tuesday.\n\n\n-----\n\negregor leak.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\nDetails about how the Egregor gang obtained the data remain unclear.\n\nRansomware gangs like Egregor regularly breach companies, steal their data, encrypt files, and ask for a ransom to decrypt the locked data.\n\nHowever, in many incidents, ransomware gangs are also get caught and kicked out of networks during the data exfiltration process, and files\nare never encrypted. Nevertheless, they still extort companies, asking victims for money to not leak sensitive files.\n\n[Usually, when negotiations break down, ransomware gangs post a partial leak of the stolen files on so-called leak sites.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-a-list-of-all-the-ransomware-gangs-who-will-steal-and-leak-your-data-if-you-dont-pay/?__twitter_impression=true)\n\nOn Tuesday, leaks for both Crytek and Ubisoft were posted on the Egregor portal at the same time, with threats from the ransomware crew to\nleak more files in the coming days.\n\nFor the Ubisoft leak, the Egregor group shared files to suggest they were in possession of source code from one of the company's Watch Dogs\ngames. On its web portal, the group touted they were in possession of the source code for the Watch Dogs: Legion game, scheduled to be\nreleased later this month It was however impossible to verify that these files came from the new game rather than an existing release\n\n\n-----\n\nubisoft leaked folder.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\n[For the past year, security researchers have tried to reach out and notify Ubisoft about several of its employees getting phished, with no](https://twitter.com/search?q=ubisoft%20from%3Amalwrhunterteam&src=typed_query&f=live)\nresults, which may provide a clue of how the hackers might have got it.\n\nBut while hackers leaked only 20 MB from Ubisoft, they leaked 300 MB from Crytek, and this data contained a lot more information.\n\nThe Crytek files included documents that appeared to have been stolen from the company's game development division. These documents\ncontained resources and information about the development process of games like Arena of Fate and Warface, but also Crytek's old Gface\nsocial gaming network.\n\n\n-----\n\ncrytek leak folders.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\n\n-----\n\ncrytek leak.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\n\n-----\n\ncrytek leak minutes.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\nNeither Ubisoft nor Crytek responded to emails seeking comment on the leaks. None of the companies reported major security incidents\nweeks, nor any abnormal and prolonged downtimes, suggesting the Egregor intrusion didn't likely impact cloud and gaming system, but merely\nbackend office and work networks, where most ransomware incidents usually incur damages.\n\nHowever, in an email interview with ZDNet, the Egregor gang provided more details about the two incidents. The ransomware operators said\nthey breached the Ubisoft network, but only stole data, and did not encrypt any of the company's files.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Crytek has been encrypted fully,\" the Egregor crew told ZDNet.\n\nThe Egregor group said that neither company engaged in discussions, despite their intrusions, and no ransom has been officially requested\nyet.\n\n\"In case Ubisoft will not contact us we will begin posting the source code of upcoming Watch Dogs and their engine,\" the group threatened,\npromising to publish more data in a press release tomorrow.\n\n\n-----",
