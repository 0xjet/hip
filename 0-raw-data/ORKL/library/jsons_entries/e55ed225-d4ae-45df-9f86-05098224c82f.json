Multiple pieces and\ntypes of malware was used in this attack which took place over almost a year [1].\n\nIllustration using details from p.53 of the COI report\n\nOn 6th March, Symantec released a blog article [2] linking several pieces of malware and a threat\ngroup which we will be tracking as SectorM04 to Singapore’s SingHealth breach last year. One such\nartifact we found an exact match on was the DLL Shellcode Loader which was referred to as\nTrojan.Vcrodat that is one of the files dropped as something which has characteristics of the PlugX\nRAT. The PlugX RAT is a RAT which has been used by multiple threat groups, including one which\nwas reported to have interests in the healthcare sector [3].\n\n## Decoy (e9b12791e0ab3a952fa09afd29e5a1416abd917edf5c913af7573adf8ccc39b0)\n\nThe dropper for that file was in the form of a decoy executable/document and named as\n“PositionRequirement-SeniorCivilEngineer.doc.exe”. Opening this results in the Word document below\nbeing opened, and everything will seem normal to the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoy document that is opened after executing the malware\n\nHowever, this is actually a trick because the malware uses a “.docx.exe” extension. The actual\nexecutable drops other files in the same folder – a legitimate signed executable, a malicious DLL file\nwhich abuses the DLL search order [4] from the executable, a compressed shellcode file, a simple\nbatch script (a.bat) to clear its tracks, and a normal Word document. The executable then executes\nthe normal Word document, the batch script, and drops the remaining three files and executes the\nlegitimate signed executable.\n\na.bat – a simple batch script to hide the tracks of the original EXE\n```\n:Repeat\ndel [filepath]\\filename.docx.exe\nif exist [filepath]\\filename.docx.exe goto Repeat\n\n```\nIf this was the RAT used for the initial infection, then it seems to reinforce the theory that one likely\ninitial infection vector was via spear phishing using a link or an archived file [1]. This is because using\nan exploit to automatically run this dropper would not make sense as the malware also automatically\nopens a benign Word document which would arouse suspicion if it opened by itself.\n\n## PlugX Trinity\n\n\n-----\n\nThose remaining three files are actually the three files in what other researchers have dubbed the\nPlugX Trinity [5] – a legitimate signed executable, a loader DLL, and a shellcode file.\n\nIn this example, while the legitimate signed executable was a file named adobe.exe it was actually an\napplication from ESET. However, the attacker uses DLL side loading, and this “adobe.exe” file tries to\nload MSVCR110.dll which is a legitimate system DLL. But because of the way the DLL search order\nworks, the system tries to find MSVCR110.dll from the directory from which the application loaded\nfirst, thus loading the attacker’s version of MSVCR110.dll.\n\nMSVCR110.dll is a tiny dll made up of exported functions which the real MSVCR110.dll should have.\nThese external functions simply jump to the MSVCR90.dll when called, except for the\n“__crtGetShowWindowMode” function which calls the malicious function. The malicious function will\nproceed to read the MSVCR110.dat shellcode file into memory and decompress the buffer using\nRtlDecompressBuffer under the COMPRESSION_FORMAT_LZNT1 scheme, a method seen since\nearly days of the PlugX RAT [6], and further unpack the shellcode. Throughout the unpacking\nprocess, it makes use of its Process Environment Block (PEB) to parse the PEB_LDR_DATA structure\nfor getting addresses of functions and libraries it wants to use.\n\nWhen starting, this malware uses the Global mutex named “eeclnt”. It will run another copy of itself\nwith the arguments “258”, and this copy will run %windir%\\system32\\msiexec.exe as it disables\nWOW64 redirection.\n\nThe created msiexec.exe will be started with the flags 0x434 which among other things starts the\nprocess in a suspended mode and command line arguments “259”, then performs process injection\nso that the malware is running as msiexec.exe.\n\n**Persistence**\n\nIn order to persist on a system, the malware makes use of %APPDATA%\\Windows folder, setting the\nfolder attributes to HIDDEN | SYSTEM and moving MSVCR110.dll, MSVCR110.dat, and eeclnt.exe\n(renamed from adobe.exe) there. It stores this new location of the shellcode file (MSVCR110.dat) in\nan environment variable “%UI00%” and the location of the DLL file (MSVCR110.dll) in an environment\nvariable “%UI01%”.\nThere are two persistence mechanisms it makes use of:\n\n1. Service with service name and display name set to “WanServer”, which starts\n\n%APPDATA%\\Windows\\eeclnt.exe with the command line arguments “260”. The service\ndescription used is “Network for this computer. If this service is stopped, these functions will be\nunavailable.”, which is a generic sounding but unique description for this malicious service.\n2. If the service failed to be created, most likely due to insufficient privileges, then the malware\n\nwould make use of the standard run registry key located at\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with key “eeclnt” and value\n%APPDATA%\\Windows\\eeclnt.exe with the command line arguments “260”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command**\n**Line** **Description**\n\nNULL Re-run with arguments “258” and continue\n\n\n“258” /\n“260”\n\n\nRun %windir%\\system32\\msiexec.exe with arguments “259” or “261” respectively in\nsuspended mode and inject itself into it\n\n\n“259” Create persistence via service / run registry key and run itself as “eeclnt.exe” with\narguments “260”\n\n“261” Run normally, including C2 communications.\n\n**C2 Beacon**\n\nThe malware beacons using a legitimate HTTPS POST on port 443 to “/login.asp?id=%d” where %d\nis the victim identifier using the user-agent “User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0; Windows\nNT 5.0)” via WinINet.dll’s HttpSendRequestA. If the configuration uses a different port, then the\nrequest is done via HTTP.\n\n**Hooking**\n\nThe malware manually sets inline hooks on SspiCli.dll’s AcquireCredentialsHandleA function if\nrunning on Windows 10. AcquireCredentialsHandleA is actually a function normally called from\nsecur32.dll, which then forwards the API call to SspiCli.dll. Before performing the actual function, the\ninline hook will use the process token from explorer.exe and perform ImpersonateLoggedOnUser()\nwith that token, which is a trick we are seeing for the first time and seems to be for UAC bypass.\nThe malware also manually sets inline hooks on WSs2_32.dll’s closesocket and shutdown functions.\nBefore performing the closesocket function, the inline hook will perform “setsockopt(socket,\nSOL_SOCKET, SO_DONTLINGER, 0, 4)” and on shutdown, the inline hook will simply return from the\nfunction instead.\n\n**Information Collected**\n\nThe malware mainly collects the following information from the system automatically:\n\nMajor, minor, and build OS versions\nNetBIOS Name\nMAC Address\nLogged on user name\n\n**Other PlugX Capabilities**\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilar to previous PlugX variants [7], this version zeroes out its entire PE header (without that false\n“XV” header), together with other certain other PE sections we presume the attacker did not want\nothers to see.\nFinally, besides this technical analysis, it is important to remember that PlugX in general has reverse\nshell capabilities and typically has additional modules which might be either decrypted or downloaded\nas shellcode [8].\n\n## Summary\n\nWhile we cannot be sure of the SectorM04’s motives, healthcare data is information that has a lot of\npotential for intelligence gathering with the most obvious being used for blackmail. They have shown\ntheir willingness, ability, and patience to compromise their targets, of which Singapore appears to be\none of the bigger ones. As is the case for many nation state threat actor groups, it is important to\nremember that cyber is only one part of an intelligence operation.\n\n## ATT&CK Matrix\n\n**Initial Access**\nSpearphishing Attachment\nValid Accounts\n\n**Execution**\nCommand-Line Interface\nPowerShell\nRegsvr32\nRundll32\nScripting\nUser Execution\n\n**Persistence**\nAppInit DLLs\nDLL Search Order Hijacking\nOffice Application Startup\nValid Accounts\n\n**Privilege Escalation**\nAppInit DLLs\nDLL Search Order Hijacking\nExploitation for Privilege Escalation\nValid Accounts\n\n**Defense Evasion**\nDLL Side-Loading\nIndicator Removal from Tools\nIndicator Removal on Host\nProcess Hollowing\nRegsvr32\n\n\n-----\n\nRundll32\nScripting\nValid Accounts\n\n**Credential Access**\nCredential Dumping\nCredentials in Files\n\n**Lateral Movement**\nPass the Ticket\nRemote Desktop Protocol\nRemote File Copy\n\n**Collection**\nData Staged\n\n**Command and Control**\nRemote File Copy\n\n**Exfiltration**\nExfiltration over Command and Control Channel\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**PlugX Trinity Hashes (SHA-256)**\n\n**PlugX RAT Full Dropper**\n\ne9b12791e0ab3a952fa09afd29e5a1416abd917edf5c913af7573adf8ccc39b0\n\n**PlugX Trinity – Legitimate signed executables**\n\nfafb6ffd3ffcf414b702354f62a5216351af4566ed61ece7784846a6938bb8d9\n\n36d76999e9090c99fae2388cd3476134464807fc597f67c60eebc76e32339683\n\n**PlugX Trinity – Malicious DLLs which are used to abuse search order**\n\nCACEA09B3A5839B0A158F49B4EFEC2A698DB8688F57A92CBA61F287A1619833E\n\nED3CD71EACA603A00E4C0804DC34D84DC38C6C1E1C1F43AF0568FB162C44C995\n\n3B86CF2DEB6524D556AB0109B39A31AEDE3D0ACE423C94FD72DEFD6AB592A3AB\n\nD784A12FEC628860433C28CAA353BB52923F39D072437393629039FA4B2EC8AD\n\n6e874ac92c7061300b402dc616a1095fa7d13c8a18c8a3ea5b30ffa832a7372c\n\n**PlugX Trinity – Shellcode files**\n\n2201C3AC955148A078D366DC1E9F552FCA4A872756D3B6DA93494CDE8D5DECD5\n\n5664334F2DE563B9F8978B7E33AED4526F96D6D9751F1204D7FBBF659C4F0F7B\n\n**Other Hashes (SHA-256)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Another RAT Used**\nb2b2e900aa2e96ff44610032063012aa0435a47a5b416c384bd6e4e58a048ac9\nc83651940e90fd315f29fa878e96b9e1f624c840c09c187b376cffdd4c7dcd79\n6a633b83987dc01ec30d07b56e8a8b632dcb8ad40602e7036648cd70cdfb9fde\n9c2a0f30d49b70a9e81461c91e26ede52b9b65da4d44b7f81299914497203f29\n552cc8f42953ece5f69cd8c75dd9af3c059d10327ac6b75e4922f01572d4b7b7\n\n**Others**\n9d9a6337c486738edf4e5d1790c023ba172ce9b039df1b7b9720ed4c4c9ade90\n93c9310f3984d96f53f226f5177918c4ca78b2070d5843f08d2cf351e8c239d5\ndda22de8ad7d807cdac8c269b7e3b35a3021dcbff722b3d333f2a12d45d9908d\nf562e9270098851dc716e3f17dbacc7f9e2f98f03ec5f1242b341baf1f7d544c\na196dfe4ef7d422aadf1709b12511ae82cb96aad030422b00a9c91fb60a12f17\n\n**Network information**\n\n**Domains**\napi[.]edu-us[.]tk\napi[.]officeonlinetool[.]com\nnews[.]singmicrosoft[.]ga\napi[.]micsoftoffice[.]ga\n\n**IP Addresses**\n195[.]20[.]45[.]94\n64[.]20[.]227[.]134\n50[.]63[.]202[.]51\n192[.]71[.]247[.]131\n158[.]255[.]4[.]177\n\n## References\n\n[1] https://www.mci.gov.sg/coireport\n\n[2] https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/whitefly-espionage-singapore\n\n[3] https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2018_chinese-speaking-apt-actor-caught-spyingon-pharmaceutical-organizations\n\n[4] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order#standardsearch-order-for-desktop-applications\n\n[5] https://citizenlab.ca/2012/09/human-rights-groups-targeted-by-plugx-rat/\n\n[6]\nhttps://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/sophosszappanosplugxrevisitedintroducingsmoalerrev1.pdf\n\n[7] https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-paranoid-plugx/\n\n[8] https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/deep-analysis-of-new-poison-ivy-plugx-variant-partii.html\n\n\n-----",
