He’s like the John Gotti of cybercrime,” said Naskavets, who was not\ninvolved in the case.\n\n\n-----\n\nZhukov maintained his innocence since he was first brought into custody, and pleaded not\nguilty in early 2019. He claimed to have developed artificial intelligence tools to run an\n“absolutely legal” advertising business that didn’t victimize anyone. He asked the judge\npresiding over his case for a new attorney later that year, writing in a note, “I’m weaponless\nsoldier in front of a tank with name FBI.”\n\nA note Zhukov sent to his judge, asking for a new lawyer.\nAccording to court documents, the jury found Zhukov guilty on all four counts he was\ncharged with: wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy, and engaging\nin monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. The charges\ncarry a maximum prison sentence of up to 20 years.\n\n“Today, after evaluating the evidence and wading through the complexities of digital\nadvertising on the internet, the jury recognized the defendant for who he is—a fraudster who\nused computer code to steal millions from U.S. companies,” Acting U.S. Attorney for the\nEastern District of New York Mark Lesko said in a statement. “Zhukov may have thought that\nhe could get away with his fraud by carrying it out from halfway around the world, but this\nverdict sends a powerful message that U.S. law enforcement will bring such cybercriminals\nto justice, wherever they are.”\n\nZhukov’s scam made use of a vast network of bots, and involved both fake internet users\nand webpages. He used an ad network called Media Methane to place ad tags on websites\nin exchange for payments—but rather than place them on legitimate websites, the company\nrented thousands of computer servers in the U.S. and the Netherlands to load ads on fake\nwebsites. Zhukov programmed the servers to simulate human internet activity—for example,\nthey would “browse” the internet, scroll down a webpage, and start and stop video players.\nHe also leased more than 650,000 IP addresses and registered them in the names of large\ntelecom companies to make it seem like computer traffic was coming from residential\nhouseholds, according to prosecutors.\n\n“He was very advanced technically—he was sitting for months with the best software\nengineers in the field,” said Naskavets. “With experience like that, you could make more\nmoney than you could with bots. The Russian-speaking world… it’s crazy.”\n\nThe scheme falsified billions of ad views and siphoned more than $7 million from companies\nthat believed their ads were being watched by real human internet users. Victims included\nThe New York Times, The New York Post, Comcast, Nestle Purina, the Texas Scottish Rite\nHospital for Children, and Time Warner Cable, the Justice Department said.\n\n\n-----\n\nSentencing is set for September 17, 2021.\n\nTags\n\n[ad fraud](https://therecord.media/tag/ad-fraud/)\n[Aleksandr Zhukov](https://therecord.media/tag/aleksandr-zhukov/)\n[Methbot](https://therecord.media/tag/methbot/)\n\nAdam is the founding editor-in-chief of The Record by Recorded Future.
