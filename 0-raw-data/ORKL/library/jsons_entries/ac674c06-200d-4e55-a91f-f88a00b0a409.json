Any NCSC findings and recommendations made have not been provided with the intention of avoiding all risks, and following the recommendations will not remove all such risk. Ownership of information risks remains with the relevant system owner at all times.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction \n\n#### The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) assess that APT29 (also known as ‘the Dukes’ or ‘Cozy Bear’) is a cyber espionage group, almost certainly part of the Russian intelligence services. The United States’ National Security Agency (NSA) agrees with this attribution and the details provided in this report.\n\n The United States’ Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (DHS CISA) endorses the technical detail and mitigation advice provided in this advisory.\n\n The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets for intelligence gain.\n\n Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n APT29 is using custom malware known as ‘WellMess’ and ‘WellMail’ to target a number of organisations globally. This includes those organisations involved with COVID-19 vaccine development. WellMess and WellMail have not previously been publicly associated to APT29.\n\n## Details of techniques\n\n### Initial infection vectors\n\n#### The group frequently uses publicly available exploits to conduct widespread scanning and exploitation against vulnerable systems, likely in an effort to obtain authentication credentials to allow further access. This broad targeting potentially gives the group access to a large number of systems globally, many of which are unlikely to be of immediate intelligence value. The group may maintain a store of stolen credentials in order to access these systems in the event that they become more relevant to their requirements in the future. \n In recent attacks targeting COVID-19 vaccine research and development, the group conducted basic vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses owned by the organisations. The group then deployed public exploits against the vulnerable services identified.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### The group has been successful using recently published exploits to gain initial footholds. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n • CVE-2019-19781 Citrix [1]\n • CVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure [2]\n • CVE-2018-13379 FortiGate [2]\n • CVE-2019-9670 Zimbra [3]\n The group likely seeks to take full advantage of a variety of new exploits when publicised. More information about these exploits can be found in previous NCSC advisories on Citrix and VPN vulnerabilities [1,2]. \n The group also uses spear-phishing to obtain authentication credentials to internet- accessible login pages for target organisations. \n\n### Persistent access\n\n#### Upon gaining access to a system, the group likely drops further tooling and/or seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to the compromised systems in order to maintain persistent access. The actor is likely to use anonymising services when using the stolen credentials. \n\n### WellMess malware\n\n#### In some cases, APT29 also deploys custom malware known as WellMess or WellMail to conduct further operations on the victim’s system. \n WellMess is malware written in either Golang or .NET and has been in use since at least 2018. WellMess was first reported on by JPCERT and LAC researchers in July 2018[4][5]. It is named after one of the function names in the malware - ‘wellmess’. WellMess is a lightweight malware designed to execute arbitrary shell commands, upload and download files. The malware supports HTTP, TLS and DNS communications methods.\n\n Indicators of compromise (IOCs) for WellMess are available in the appendix.\n\n### WellMail malware\n\n#### WellMail is a lightweight tool designed to run commands or scripts with the results being sent to a hardcoded Command and Control (C2) server. \n\n The NCSC has named this malware ‘WellMail’ due to file paths containing the word ‘mail’ and the use of server port 25 present in the sample analysed. Similar to WellMess, WellMail uses hard-coded client and certificate authority TLS certificates to communicate with C2 servers. \n\n\n-----\n\n#### The binary is an ELF utility written in Golang which receives a command or script to be run through the Linux shell. To our knowledge, WellMail has not been previously named in the public domain.\n\n IOCs for WellMail are available in the appendix.\n\n### Certificate usage\n\n#### WellMess and WellMail samples contained TLS certificates with the hard-coded subjectKeyIdentifier (SKI) '0102030406', and used the subjects 'C=Tunis, O=IT' and 'O=GMO GlobalSign, Inc' respectively. These certificates can be used to identify further malware samples and infrastructure. Servers with this GlobalSign certificate subject may be used for other functions in addition to WellMail malware communications.\n\n### SoreFang malware\n\n#### Malware, dubbed ‘SoreFang’ by the NCSC, is a first stage downloader that uses HTTP to exfiltrate victim information and download second stage malware. The sample analysed by the NCSC contains the same infrastructure as a WellMess sample (103.216.221[.]19). \n\n It is likely that SoreFang targets SangFor devices. Industry reporting indicates that other actors, reportedly including ‘DarkHotel’, have also targeted SangFor devices. Therefore, not all SangFor exploitation activity relates to targeting by APT29. \n\n## Conclusion\n\n#### APT29 is likely to continue to target organisations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic. \n\n It is strongly recommended that organisations use the rules and IOCs in the appendix in order to detect the activity detailed in this advisory. \n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Indicators of compromise and detection rules\n\n#### WellMess IOCs\n\n##### Hashes\n```\n

See NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware.\n\n  - **Use multi-factor authentication (/2-factor authentication/two-step**\n##### authentication) to reduce the impact of password compromises. See NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online- services and https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication- 2fa\n\n  - **Treat people as your first line of defence. Tell staff how to report suspected**\n##### phishing emails, and ensure they feel confident to do so. Investigate their reports promptly and thoroughly. Never punish users for clicking phishing links or opening attachments. See NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing\n\n  - **Set up a security monitoring capability so you are collecting the data that will be**\n##### needed to analyse network intrusions. See NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security- purposes.\n\n  - **Prevent and detect lateral movement in your organisation’s networks. See**\n##### NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement\n\n\n-----",
