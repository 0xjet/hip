Om Nom Nom Nom”\n\n**[intezer.com/blog/research/ytstealer-malware-youtube-cookies/](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/ytstealer-malware-youtube-cookies/)**\n\nJune 29, 2022\n\nWritten by Joakim Kennedy - 29 June 2022\n\n### Get Free Account\n\nJoin Now\n\n## The Stage: The Dark Web Market for YouTube Account Access\n\nIn 2006, the term [“data is the new oil” was coined. Ever since then, the value of data has](https://ana.blogs.com/maestros/2006/11/data_is_the_new.html)\njust increased. We live in a world where many corporations collect data on users in an\nattempt to monetize it. This is not just limited to legitimate corporations; the same occurs on\nthe Dark Web. With data, someone always wants to turn it into money. One thing that’s\n\n\n-----\n\ninteresting when it comes to the Dark Web is that a lot of these deals are not happening\nbehind closed doors. Instead, they are sometimes advertised front and center on the\nforums.\n\nThese Dark Web forums have become their own small economies where threat actors\nspecialize in specific services. This specialization has made it easier for these threat actors\nto monetize what they are good at. We see this, especially in the ransomware scene. There\nare specialized roles for people that gain access to organizations, steal and encrypt data for\nthe double extortion effect, to ransom negotiators. Another hypothetical chain is: a threat\nactor sells malware to another that uses the malware to steal data from an organization.\nThe data is sold to another that tries to convert the data into cash. As you move along this\nchain, the amount of money exchanged usually increases since each party wants to turn in\na profit, but the risks also increase. At some point, one of these threat actors must interact\nwith the real world to obtain the cash. This is when they are usually exposed, if they haven’t\nalready made other mistakes.\n\nIn this blog post, we are describing a new malware that we have concluded is highly likely\nsold as a service on the Dark Web. We have named the malware YTStealer because its\n**sole objective is to steal authentication cookies from YouTube content creators. In**\n[June 2020, IntSights released a report on a new trend that they observed. In this trend,](https://intsights.com/blog/stolen-youtube-credentials-growing-in-popularity-on-dark-web-forums)\nthreat actors were selling access to YouTube accounts. The goal of this write-up is to share\none of the many methods threat actors are using to obtain these accounts.\n\n## One Stealer, One Goal\n\nYTStealer is a malware whose objective is to steal YouTube authentication cookies. As a\nstealer, it operates like many other stealers. The first thing it does when it’s executed is to\nperform some environment checks. This is to detect if the malware is being analyzed in a\nsandbox. The code that performs the checks comes from an open-source project hosted on\n[GitHub called Chacal. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the project’s readme file. The](https://github.com/p3tr0v/chacal)\nframework is marketing itself for Red Teams and pen-testers. It provides anti-debugging,\nanti-memory analysis, and anti-VM functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Part of Chacal’s README._\nWhat sets YTStealer aside from other stealers sold on the Dark Web market is that it is\nsolely focused on harvesting credentials for one single service instead of grabbing\neverything it can get ahold of. When it comes to the actual process, it is very similar to that\nseen in other stealers. The cookies are extracted from the browser’s database files in the\nuser’s profile folder.\n\nIf YTStealer finds authentication cookies for YouTube, it does something interesting though.\nTo validate the cookies and to grab more information about the YouTube user account, the\nmalware starts one of the installed web browsers on the infected machine in headless mode\nand adds the cookie to its cookie store. By starting the web browser in headless mode, the\nmalware can operate the browser as if the threat actor sat down on the computer without\n\n\n-----\n\nthe current user noticing anything. To control the browser, the malware uses a library called\n[Rod. Rod provides a high-level interface to control browsers over the DevTools Protocol](https://go-rod.github.io/)\nand markets itself as a tool for web automation and scraping.\n\n_Figure 2: Screenshot of Rod’s documentation describing the framework._\nUsing the web browser, YTStealer navigates to YouTube’s Studio page which allows\ncontent creators to manage their content. From YouTube studio, the malware grabs\ninformation about the user’s channels. The data it grabs includes the channel name, how\nmany subscribers it has, how old it is, if it is monetized, an official artist channel, and if the\nname has been verified. All the data is encrypted with a key that is unique for each sample\nand sends it together with a sample identifier to the command and control (C2) server\nlocated at the domain name youbot[.]solutions.\n\nYTStealer doesn’t discriminate about what credentials it steals, whether it’s someone\nuploading Minecraft videos to share with a few friends or a channel like Mr. Beast with\nmillions of subscribers. On the Dark Web, the “quality” of stolen account credentials\ninfluences the asking price, so access to more influential YouTube channels would\ncommand higher prices.\n\n## What is “YouBot Solutions”?\n\nWhile investigating all the YTStealer samples that we have come across, we noticed that all\nshared the same build path. The path, shown below, looks like a path from an internal build\nservice. The path also includes the domain name to which the stealer exfiltrates the stolen\ndata.\n```\n/home/admin/web/youbot.solutions/public_html/Builder/Sources\n\n```\nThis domain name was registered back in December 2021 and hosts a web server behind\nCloudflare that returns an empty response. By using the domain name we identified an\nAmerican corporation with the name of “YOUBOT SOLUTIONS LLC”. The corporation was\nregistered in New Mexico on March 8, 2022 (unfortunately, the State of New Mexico’s\ncorporation registry is not accessible outside of the US but the data can be obtained from\n\n\n-----\n\n[third party providers). Figure 2 shows a screenshot of a Google Business entry for a](https://www.bizapedia.com/nm/youbot-solutions-llc.html)\ncompany with the same name and address as in the registry database. The company lists\nitself as a software company that “provides [sic] unique solutions for getting and monetizing\ntargeted traffic”. The website provided in the listing points to youbot[.]solutions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Google_\n\n\n_Business listing for YOUBOT SOLUTIONS LLC._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe business listing has a logo of an eye in a red circle. A Google image search using the\nicon returned some results with the same image. All the results were under the domain\naparat[.]com. Aparat is an Iranian video-sharing site that was founded in 2011. The image\nmatched was used as a profile picture for a user on the site. Figure 4 shows the profile\npage of the user. The profile page provided a link to a Twitter account. Figure 5 shows a\nscreenshot of the Twitter account.\n\n_Figure 4: Screenshot of Aparat user account’s profile page that uses YOUBOT_\n_SOLUTIONS LLC’s “logo” as their profile image._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Twitter profile linked to in the Aparat user profile._\n\n## How Are Victims Targeted?\n\nGiven the optics of the infrastructure and that each sample has a unique identifier, it\nappears that YTStealer is sold as a service to other threat actors. With this in mind, we\ndecided to look into if we could get a better understanding of who is targeted by this stealer.\nAs it is designed to steal YouTube credentials, it’s already clear that YouTube content\ncreators are being targeted. Can we narrow the scope further?\n\nWe looked at files that either dropped or downloaded the YTStealer samples that we have\ncollected. The first observation is that the majority of these files don’t just drop YTStealer.\nThe droppers also came loaded with other stealers, including RedLine and Vidar stealers.\nOf the different stealers used together with YTStealer, RedLine stealer was the highest\ncount. Figure 6 shows the analysis of one of the files that drop both YTStealer and RedLine.\nOne of the memory modules found has a lot of shared code with other RedLine stealer\nsamples in our dataset.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6:_ _[Intezer Analyze result for one of the malware dropping YTStealer together with](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/132f868aabbd82b36b283f0b6768133b6297de0acd5f47e6cb9a76dc07fd276a/sub/78f7ed87-ba49-45be-9790-15aaf1faa0ce)_\n_RedLine stealer._\nA lot of these files are disguised as installers for tools or legitimate software. With it\ntargeting content creators, we would expect some of the names to overlap with tools or\nsoftware used by the intended targets. Grouping the names, we do see some overlap.\n\nOne of the groups is “Digital, Image, and Video software”. We found fake installers for OBS\nStudio, an open-source streaming software. Additionally, we identified a few video editing\nsoftware installers which included Adobe Premiere Pro, Filmora, and HitFilm Express. In the\naudio category, we identified fake installers for digital audio workstation (DAW) applications\nand plugins. This included the DAWs Ableton Live 11 Suite and FL Studio. The plugins\nincluded the infamous Antares Auto-Tune Pro, but also Valhalla DSP, FabFilter Total, and\nXfer Serum.\n\nThe second group is what we call “Game mods and cheats”. The games match popular\ngames used by streamers and content creators. We identified fake installers for the FiveM\nGrand Theft Auto V mod, different “hacks” for Roblox, and cheats for Counter-Strike Go,\n[and Call of Duty. A variant of the Valorant hack reported on by AhnLab earlier was also](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/32499/)\n[discovered. Valorant “gamers” were also targeted by a “Skin Changer”.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5dOjWDVG7g)\n\nAnother group of tools that can be classified as adjacent to games is driver tools. Gamers\nusually would like to squeeze the very last drop of performance out of their gaming rigs.\nOne way of doing this is to “ensure you are using updated drivers and that they are tuned\ncorrectly”. In this group, we found fake installers for tools such as “Driver Booster” and\n“Driver Easy”.\n\nThe last group is for other software and “cracks”. Here we identified anything from fake\ninstallers for security products, such as Norton Security and Malwarebytes to “token\ngenerators” and “cracks” for services such as Discord Nitro, Stepn, and Spotify Premium.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe overwhelming part of these fake installers are for pirated versions of the software, but\nwe also see some fake installers for game mods. This finding should further stress the\nimportance of only obtaining software from trusted sources. Only obtain software directly\nfrom the vendor or “modding” group.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nSomeone always has a way of monetizing data. When it comes to stolen YouTube\nauthentication data, we haven’t analyzed how it’s being monetized in the next step of the\nchain. One potential option could be to defraud the subscribers of channels. When it comes\nto how this malware is infecting the victims, we can see a trend. Most of the fake installers\nused were for cracked versions of legitimate software. We also saw fake installers for mods\nand cheats for games. When it comes to how to protect yourself, the classic security\npractice should be applied. Only use software from trusted sources.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n[IoCs can be found on GitHub here.](https://github.com/intezer/community-intellignce/blob/master/YTStealer_hashes.txt)\n\n**Joakim Kennedy**\nDr. Joakim Kennedy is a Security Researcher analyzing malware and tracking threat actors\non a daily basis.
