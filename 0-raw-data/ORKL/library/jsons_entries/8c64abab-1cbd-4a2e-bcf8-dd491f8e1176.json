    "plain_text": "# Holding Russia To Account\n\n**state.gov/holding-russia-to-account/**\n\nToday, we announced actions to hold the Russian Government to account for the SolarWinds\nintrusion, reports of bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, and attempts to interfere in the\n2020 U.S. elections.\n\nWe have engaged Russian authorities to share our concerns about their actions and the\nsteps we are taking in response. The President is signing a new Executive Order on Russia\nthat will broaden the scope of our sanctions authorities. Under this new Executive Order, the\nU.S. Department of the Treasury is issuing a directive prohibiting U.S. financial institutions\nfrom conducting transactions in the primary market for new ruble or non-ruble denominated\nbonds issued after June 14, 2021. This Executive Order also provides authority for the U.S.\nGovernment to expand sovereign debt sanctions on Russia as appropriate.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State is also expelling 10 officials from Russia’s bilateral mission. In\naddition, the U.S. Department of the Treasury is announcing sanctions against entities and\nindividuals involved in election interference and against companies that support the malign\nactivities of the Russian intelligence services responsible for the SolarWinds intrusion and\nother recent cyber incidents. These sanctions will serve to reduce Russian resources\navailable to carry out similar malign activities.\n\nIn addition, together with partners and allies, on March 2 the U.S. responded to Russia’s\nattempt to poison Aleksey Navalny using a chemical weapon and his subsequent arrest and\nimprisonment. We remain concerned about Navalny’s health and treatment in prison, and\n\n\n-----\n\ncall for his unconditional release.\n\nThese actions are intended to hold Russia to account for its reckless actions. We will act\nfirmly in response to Russian actions that cause harm to us or our allies and partners. Where\npossible, the United States will also seek opportunities for cooperation with Russia, with the\ngoal of building a more stable and predictable relationship consistent with U.S. interests.\n\nAdditionally, the State Department is taking steps to bolster cybersecurity partnerships\ninternationally, including by providing a new training course with partners on the policy and\ntechnical aspects of publicly attributing cyber incidents and by supporting trainings on\nresponsible state behavior in cyberspace.\n\nFor more information on the actions, visit https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing[room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/)\nactivities-by-the-russian-government/\n\n\n-----",
