The module version \"0.6.8\" is\nmeant for browser stealer activity affecting Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla\nFirefox, Microsoft Edge as well as browser cookies.\n\nThe signed malware sample that led to the discovery was originally found by\n[MalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam).](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\n\n**Discovery: New \"grabber.dll\" Test Module**\n\nStrangely enough, the module immediately alerted the victim machine of the fraud by\nopening the browser with the message:\n\nThe malware development module references a plethora of internal C++ code references\nsuch as \"grabchrome.cpp.\" The module itself references the usual TrickBot grabber code\npatterns and functions.\n\n\n-----\n\nNotably, the malware contains the detailed verbose functionality prompt:\n\n**Assessment: TrickBot Group Distribution Mistake?**\n\nAdvanced Intelligence assesses with high confidence that this module was likely a test\nmodule deployed mistakenly alerting on the malware activity during the testing phase due to\nthe typical TrickBot module code patterns. Based on our assessment, it is hypothesized If\ndeveloped by an outsider coder, this test module possibly reveals the nature of the TrickBot\noperations as leveraging coders with hiring coders under the ruse of legitimate anti-malware\nactivity development.\n\nAs part of the chain, Advanced Intelligence discovered another rather unusually named\nmodule \"socksbot.dll.\" This module is meant for Socks5 proxy activity of the TrickBot chain.\n\nWe continue closely monitoring for TrickBot activity and malware distributions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Recommendations & Possible Mitigations**\n\nThe immediate disconnect of the affected machine from the network when observed\nthe fraud message as displayed\n\nFull password reset from browsers for any internal and external assets\n\nLogged-in session reset to prevent reuse of stolen cookies\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): grabber.dll (MD5:**\n57103CAE44BA3FA21804EBC9BF702B1F) socksbot.dll (MD5:\n382A62908E86BB1F333EC99B17A38930) TrickBot loader (MD5:\n4BE2C925E06F6CABB3D3761B8D3A3D11)\n\n\n-----",
