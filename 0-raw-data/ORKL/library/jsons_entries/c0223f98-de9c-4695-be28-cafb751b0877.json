Over the past\nyear, there has been an increasing number of ransomware gangs releasing Linux\nencryptors targeting this platform.\n\nWhile ESXi is not strictly Linux as it uses its own customer kernel, it does share many\nsimilar characteristics, including the ability to run ELF64 Linux executables.\n\n\n-----\n\n## HelloKitty moves to ESXi\n\n[Yesterday, security researcher MalwareHunterTeam found numerous Linux ELF64 versions](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nof the HelloKitty ransomware targeting ESXi servers and the virtual machines running on\nthem.\n\nIt has been known that HelloKitty utilizes a Linux encryptor, but this is the first sample that\nresearchers have publicly spotted.\n\nSeems no one mentioned yet, so let me do it: the Linux version of HelloKitty\nransomware was already using esxcli at least in early March for stopping\n[VMs...@VK_Intel](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@demonslay335](https://twitter.com/demonslay335?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/atSv0OO7YL](https://t.co/atSv0OO7YL)\n\n[— MalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam) July 14, 2021](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1415403132230803460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nMalwareHunterTeam shared samples of the ransomware with BleepingComputer, and you\ncan clearly see strings referencing ESXi and the ransomware's attempts to shut down\nrunning virtual machines.\n```\nFirst try kill VM:%ld ID:%d  %s\nesxcli vm process kill -t=soft -w=%d\nCheck kill   VM:%ld ID:%d\nesxcli vm process kill -t=hard -w=%d\nUnable to find\nKilled     VM:%ld ID:%d\nstill running VM:%ld  ID:%d try force\nesxcli vm process kill -t=force -w=%d\nCheck  VM:%ld ID:   %d manual !!!\n.README_TO_RESTORE\nFind ESXi:%s\nesxcli vm process list\nWorld ID:\nProcess ID:\nRunning VM:%ld ID:%d  %s\nTotal VM run on host:  %ld\n\n```\nFrom the debug messages, we can see that the ransomware uses ESXi's\n```\nesxcli command-line management tool to list the running virtual machines on the server\n\n```\nand then shut them down.\n\nRansomware gangs targeting ESXi servers will shut down virtual machines before\nencrypting files to prevent the files from being locked and to avoid data corruption.\n\nSome Darkside affiliates have a tendency to forget to stop all the ESXi daemons\nbefore kicking off the encryption. The result is that sometimes encrypted data can be\ninterlaced with unencrypted data or that the footer containing the file key is partially\noverwritten. Same result.\n\n— Fabian Wosar (@fwosar) [April 14, 2021](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1382303492002435073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen shutting down the virtual machines, the ransomware will first try a graceful shutdown\nusing the 'soft' command:\n```\nesxcli vm process kill -t=soft -w=%d\n\n```\nIf there are still VMs running, it will try an immediate shutdown of virtual machines using the\n'hard' command:\n```\nesxcli vm process kill -t=hard -w=%d\n\n```\nFinally, if virtual machines are still running, the malware will use the 'force' command to shut\ndown any running VMs forcefully.\n```\nesxcli vm process kill -t=force -w=%d\n\n```\nAfter the virtual machines are shut down, the ransomware will begin encrypting\n**.vmdk (virtual hard disk), .vmsd (metadata and snapshot information), and .vmsn (contains**\nthe active state of the VM) files.\n\nThis method is very efficient as it allows a ransomware gang to encrypt many virtual\nmachines with a single command.\n\n[Last month, MalwareHunterTeam also found a Linux version of the REvil ransomware that](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomwares-new-linux-encryptor-targets-esxi-virtual-machines/)\ntargets ESXi servers and used the esxcli command as part of the encryption process.\n\nEmsisoft CTO Fabian Wosar told BleepingComputer at the time that other ransomware\n[operations, such as Babuk, RansomExx/Defray, Mespinoza, GoGoogle, and the now-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomexx-ransomware-also-encrypts-linux-systems/)\ndefunct DarkSide, have also created Linux encryptors to target ESXi virtual machines.\n\n\"The reason why most ransomware groups implemented a Linux-based version of their\nransomware is to target ESXi specifically,\" said Wosar.\n\n## A bit about HelloKitty\n\n[HelloKity has been in operation since November 2020, when a victim first posted about the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/750580/hellokitty-ransomware-crypt-read-me-unlocktxt-support-topic/)\nransomware in our forums.\n\nSince then, the threat actors have not been particular actively compared to other humanoperated ransomware operations.\n\n[Their most well-known attack has been against CD Projekt Red, where the threat actors](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cd-projekt-red-gaming-studio-hit-by-ransomware-attack/)\nencrypted devices and claim to have stolen source code for Cyberpunk 2077, Witcher 3,\nGwent, and more.\n\nThe threat actors later claimed that someone had purchased the files stolen from CD\nProjekt Red.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis ransomware, or its variants, has been used under different names such as\n[DeathRansom and Fivehands.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomware-group-uses-sonicwall-zero-day-to-breach-networks/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Hive ransomware ports its Linux VMware ESXi encryptor to Rust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-ports-its-linux-vmware-esxi-encryptor-to-rust/)\n\n[Shutterfly services disrupted by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-services-disrupted-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[FiveHands](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/fivehands/)\n[HelloKitty](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hellokitty/)\n[Linux](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/linux/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Virtual Machine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/virtual-machine/)\n[Vmware ESXi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vmware-esxi/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
