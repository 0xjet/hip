The gang hid the Trojan within a host of phony apps, some designed to look like\nauthentic online banking apps, some designed to look like pornography apps. These thieves knew their target demographic:\nover one million unsuspecting users installed the malware onto their Android mobile devices. The good news is that the\nvillainous gang has been apprehended. The bad news is that the villainous malware is still at large.\n\nNow, the Avast Threat Labs team have uncovered and analyzed with SfyLabs a new version of the malware, dubbed Catelites\nBot, which shares similarities with the malware used for CronBot. While we have no hard evidence that the Catelites actor is\nlinked to Cron, it is likely that Cron members have used the Catalites malware in their campaigns based on what we’ve seen\nso far. In the past few months, we have seen one or two fake apps per week attacking Android devices to make unsuspecting\n[victims download the malware. Once downloaded, the criminals use very sophisticated social engineering tricks to get credit](https://www.avast.com/c-social-engineering)\ncard information and possibly the ability to get into the victim’s bank account.\n\n## How does it get on your device?\n\nWhile we are still investigating the details of this malware, here is what we know: this malware gets “dropped” onto your device\nafter you download an app from a third-party app store (not official shops like Google Play) or from malicious adware\n(malvertisements) or phishing sites. Once dropped onto your Android device, the malicious app looks like the icon seen in the\nscreen below and is titled “System Application.”\n\n\n-----\n\n## How does it trick you?\n\nWhen you click the malicious “System Application” app icon, it will ask you for admin rights. If you grant those permissions, the\nmalware begins its work. The icon for the (fake) app you downloaded disappears and then, three familiar-looking, trusted app\nicons get dropped onto your home screen: one for Gmail, one for Google Play, and one for Chrome.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The 3 new icons appear on your home screen_\n_for Gmail, Google Play and Chrome._\n\nThe malware author uses two sophisticated “social engineering” techniques to encourage you to open one of these three apps\nin order to display a fake overlay that invites you to enter sensitive information like your credit card. Cybercriminals are\ncounting on the fact that you easily input credit card info for respected companies that you likely buy from regularly.\nSpecifically, these techniques are:\n\nCreating mirror icons of three well-known apps: Gmail, Google Play and Chrome\nCreating a notification that cannot be removed that links you to a fake “sign-in\" to your account\n\nBy placing these apps on the home screen, the user is more likely to open them, activating the malware so that the criminal\ncan steal sensitive information.\n\n_First you click “Google Play Store” notification;_\n_then it asks for your credit card number._\n\n## Targeting over 2,200 financial institutions\n\nWorse still, this piece of malware can also go after your bank account login details. This malware has the ability to pose as\nover 2,200 banks and financial institutions. It does so by adopting the logo and mobile application name of a bank used in the\nGoogle Play Store, allowing the author to use simple templates to harvest username and password or credit card information.\nThe overlay is HTML-based and not as sophisticated as other Android banking malware such as LokiBot, Red Alert, or Exobot,\nbut the power here is clearly in the shotgun approach: using simple phishing overlay screens, the criminals are able to target\nmany more users, increasing their likelihood of financial gain.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Above shows examples of the fake overlay screens_\n_that pull in the logos of actual banks._\n\nOnce you open your own banking app, the malware activates and places a fake overlay on your actual banking app, tricking\nyou into entering your bank login details and also your credit card info. Once you provide this, they have access to your\naccount and credit card.\n\n_If your bank is one of the 2,200 targeted financial institutions, the app pulls in the logo of your bank to make the overlay look_\n_official._\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At: https://youtu.be/1LOy0ZyjEOk\n\nCatelites Bot - Airbank example\n\nFurthermore, the Avast Threat Lab team has been analyzing this malware, and it appears to have a host of other functions\nbuilt in, though not yet activated. These include intercepting all incoming and outgoing SMS messages, setting ringer and\nstream volume to mute, and retrieving all running tasks from other apps. In addition, it can persistently ask for specific admin\nrights that could wipe data from your device or even lock you out completely.\n\n## What can you do?\n\nIf you have [Avast Mobile Security for Android, then you’re already protected from this malware. If you don’t, here are some tips](https://www.avast.com/)\nto help you stay safe:\n\n1. Beware of any strange requests for admin rights: better still, always think twice about granting any admin rights request.\n2. If you open your bank app and something doesn’t look right, shut it down.\n3. If you think you have the malware on your phone, boot your phone in safe mode (instructions [here) and carefully follow](https://www.wikihow.tech/Boot-Your-Android-Cell-Phone-Into-Safe-Mode)\n\nthe directions. Remove any suspicious apps as directed.\n4. Only get your apps from reputable stores like Google Play.\n5. Install security software on your phone like Avast Mobile Security for Android to protect against this and other malware\n\nthreats.\n\n## Technical Information\n\nIntercepts all incoming and outgoing SMS messages\nRetrieves running tasks, phone number, IMSI, device model, android version, installed applications\nSets ringer and stream volume to mute so the user doesn't hear sms notifications\nHides main application icon from launcher to stay stealthy\nAsks for device admin privileges in order to become persistent and get functions like:\n\nWipe Data\nLock the device\nForce a new unlock password for the device\nQueries phone numbers from contacts\nGet SMS and MMS message conversations\n\n**Sets ringer and stream volume to mute in order to suppress sms notifications:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Admin privileges**\n\nAsks for device admin privileges in order to become persistent and get functions like Wipe Data, lock the device and force a\nnew unlock password for the device:\n\n**Queries phone numbers from contacts:**\n\nThe Trojan has code to encrypt a big batch of file extensions with AES. The encrypted files will usually be renamed with the\noriginal name and a different extension “.cat”.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn December 8th 2017 a single botnet (C&C: 195.54.163.91) obtained 8553 bots in less than a month as shown in the panel\nof the C&C server.\n\nThe panel picture also shows similarities with the panel from the research that GroupIB did together with law enforcement to\ntake down the \"Cron\" crew. We have no hard evidence linking Catelites actor llyamov to Cron but it is likely that Cron members\nhave used the Catelites malware in their campaigns based on the exact Panel and bot similarities. The screenshot of the panel\nbelow also shows how easy it is to adjust the general overlay HTML (inject).\n\n## IOCs\n\n**SHA-256** **Package Name**\n\n\n-----\n\n0e741a21228f4f7ffdbb891524f3a246b60bee287965a74fe15009127f6de280 net.feeteyemountain.houseracerlangtree\n\n14c7e547cb8dc8f5d629725fdbdd2e8c33693dd407b2f36cd03c613e59af2cc7 net.friendsuperanswerland.foodfootmonth\n\nefe6d86d7482fbcb5b1e7e12e22c2b086e4ec988939ebdffc9d363413e5a3326 net.windclockmailsentence.doorpageperson\n\nbf6a4b8c24cd4cf233137dcee735bc33849d34e659ec2fa5e0fa9b425fee9b4e net.bodywooddoodle.mountainfriendeast\n\ne174dd174c5e21daa86064562aaf274d3f6fe84f4a3970beed48c02c3b605d58 net.songtablepicture.nightrocksciencemen\n\nb81e0b6fe123b8d4cf7d99c20de1c694360d146bf80d9490b1b0325a00bf7f5a net.manmothersouth.manbooksoundangry\n\n0c50311ee3e30fe5be1b863db1b60b32bc9afa8d4264b852a836220751c7e3b2 net.herfarmsunhead.angryspacefile\n\nd8452b39b1962239e9dbe12e8a9d8d0ee098b9c8de8a8d55b5a95b67b552102f net.homeclasswindwater.daymaildayeye\n\n53dc796e2e77689b115701a92ad2bdaeb0c7a4e87bc9e9a0bbeda057b77e22ee net.productmotherfire.sentencerockdeveloper\n\n## Targeted banking apps\n\nA list of the [targeting banking apps can be viewed here.](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4650993/avast-blog/Catelites%20Bot%20Targetted%20Banking%20Apps.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
