Introduction to\n Industroyer & Industroyer2\n\n\nIndustroyer2 is the latest evolution of the notorious\n\nmalware that was first deployed by threat actor Sandworm\n\nin Ukraine in 2016. As documented by ESET, this new\n\nartifact was used in the context of a broader operation\n\nagainst Ukrainian organizations in 2022.[1]\n\nThe Industroyer artifacts retrieved in 2016 consisted of\n\ncomponents targeting multiple industrial control system\n\n(ICS) protocols, specifically:\n\ny IEC 60870-5-101,\n\ny IEC 60870-5-104,\n\ny IEC 61850,\n\ny OPC DA.\n\nIndustroyer2, however, focuses only on IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC\n\n104), which is just an update to the Industroyer component\n\ntargeting the same protocol. This observation leads us to\n\nbelieve that, depending on the operational requirements,\n\nthe threat actors’ implementation of these ICS protocols\n\nis part of a broader framework of capabilities that is\n\nselectively packaged into a specific deliverable.\n\nIn this paper, Nozomi Networks Labs analyzes the Operational\n\nTechnology (OT) capabilities of Industroyer2, discusses the\n\nmajor changes between Industroyer and Industroyer2, and\n\nanalyzes how the codebase has evolved over time.\n\n\nA noteworthy characteristic of Industroyer deployments\n\nis the lack of any stealthy measures in the binaries. One\n\nplausible hypothesis is that the threat actor, having already\n\ncompromised the target environment and performed\n\nadvanced reconnaissance, is not concerned about potential\n\nsecurity controls.\n\nA second hypothesis is that due to time constraints, the\n\noperators would not have time to simultaneously obfuscate\n\ntheir activity and improve their posture in the environment\n\nby the time of malware delivery. Given the resources and\n\nexpertise of the threat actor, we believe this scenario to\n\nbe less likely. Nevertheless, it is clear that Sandworm is\n\nnot concerned about different Industroyer versions being\n\nattributed to the same actor through comparison of the\n\ntarget artifacts.\n\nThe takeaway for security teams is that advanced threat\n\nactors are continuously refining their OT capabilities to\n\nadapt to different operational scenarios. In the current\n\nthreat landscape it’s paramount to detect and respond to\n\nsophisticated attackers before they reach OT system—their\n\nability to analyze the targeted environment and modify its\n\nstatus was demonstrated once more with Industroyer2.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2. Industroyer & Industroyer2: The Evolving Source Code\n\n#### 2.1 Breaking Down the Samples\n\n\nIn this section, we present a series of evidence that\n\ncollectively and strongly supports the thesis that the two\n\nbinaries, Industroyer and Industroyer2, were compiled from\n\nthe same evolving source code.\n\nThroughout our analysis, we will refer to the first version\n\nof Industroyer as “v1”, which corresponds to sample\n```\n7907dd95c1d36cf3dc842a1bd804f0db511a0f68f4b3\n\nd382c23a3c974a383cad (104.dll). We will refer to\n\n```\n\nIndustroyer2 as “v2”, which corresponds to sample\n```\nd69665f56ddef7ad4e71971f06432e59f1510a7194386\n\ne5f0e8926aea7b88e00.\n\n```\nThe screenshot below (Figure 1) compares similar\n\nfunctionalities in the binaries. The decompiled code of v1\n\nis presented on the left while the matching part of v2 is\n\nshown on the right.\n\n\n**Figure 1 - Example comparison between Industroyer v1 (left) and v2 (right).**\n\n\nThe syntax of the configuration is the most obvious visual\n\ndifference between the two versions of the malware. However,\n\nthis refactor is largely irrelevant for the internal structure of\n\nthe executables. In both cases the configuration is normalized\n\ninto a matching data structure, called main_config in our\n\nanalysis, that is then used throughout the code.\n\nAs described by ESET, Industroyer v1 uses a classic INI\n\nconfiguration file that is passed as an argument to the\n\n\nCrash export of 104.dll.[2] Meanwhile, the Industroyer v2\n\nsample that we analyzed hardcodes its configuration inside\n\nthe binary in the form of a string.\n\nBelow, we present the possible properties for the\n\nhardcoded station and Information Object Address (IOA)\n\nconfigurations embedded in the analyzed binary.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.2 v2 Station Configuration\n\nThe following screenshot (Figure 2) shows the first\n\nhardcoded station configuration embedded in the analyzed\n\n\nbinary of v2. The sample embeds configurations for three\n\ndifferent IP addresses in total.\n\n\n**Figure 2 - Station Configuration.**\n\n\nBelow (Figure 3), we present the possible properties for\n\nthe hardcoded station and IOA configurations embedded\n\n\nin the analyzed binary of v2.\n\n|Property|Acceptable Values|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|Target IP|IP address|IP of the station to connect to|\n|Target port|Port number|Port of the station to connect to|\n|ASDU|Integer|Application Service Data Unit address|\n|Operation mode|Boolean|0 (Interaction with hardcoded IOA), 1 (Range mode)|\n|Switch for process manipulation|Boolean|0 (Disable), 1 (Enable)|\n|Reserved parameter|Boolean|-|\n|Process name|String|Name of the process to be killed|\n|Rename|Boolean|0 (Don't rename), 1 (Rename)|\n|Folder name|String|Folder name where the process targeted for killing and renaming is stored|\n|Sleep time in minutes|Integer|Initial sleep time, used to add a delay before interacting with a station|\n|Sleep time in seconds #1|Integer|Sleep time to use when Invert SCO/DCO On/Off is set|\n|Station index|Integer|Configuration station index to delay|\n|Sleep time in seconds #2|Integer|Sleep time before STOPDT for the previously used station index|\n|Initial SCO/DCO On/Off State|Boolean|0 (Initial state On), 1 (Initial state Off)|\n|Invert SCO/DCO On/Off|Boolean|If set, it will interact with each IOA again, with SCO/DCO On/Off inverted|\n|IOA count|Integer|Number of IOA following header|\n\n\n**Figure 3 - Target Configuration.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.3 v2 IOA Configuration\n\nAn IOA is used to address one specific piece of data within a\n\nstation. IOA configurations typically differ from station to station.\n\n\nIn the screenshot below (Figure 4) you can see the IEC-104\n\ntestbed traffic using the first station configuration.\n\n\n**Figure 4 - IEC 104 testbed traffic using first station configuration.**\n\nThe table below (Figure 5) shows the configurable IOA properties.\n\n**Property** **Acceptable Values** **Purpose**\n\nIOA Integer Information Object Address\n\nSingle/Double command Boolean 0 (Double command), 1 (Single command)\n\nSCO/DCO Select/Execute Boolean 0 (Execute), 1 (Select)\n\nSCO/DCO On/Off Boolean 0 (Off), 1 (On)\n\nPriority Integer  \nIndex Integer IOA entry index in the configuration list\n\n**Figure 5 - IOA Configuration.**\n\n|Property|Acceptable Values|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|IOA|Integer|Information Object Address|\n|Single/Double command|Boolean|0 (Double command), 1 (Single command)|\n|SCO/DCO Select/Execute|Boolean|0 (Execute), 1 (Select)|\n|SCO/DCO On/Off|Boolean|0 (Off), 1 (On)|\n|Priority|Integer|-|\n|Index|Integer|IOA entry index in the configuration list|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.4 v2 Command-line Parameters\n\nWhile v1 included a separate component to load and launch\n\npayloads contained in different Dynamic-link Libraries (DLLs),\n\nthe v2 sample provides the user with the ability to set certain\n\ncommand-line options.\n\nAs shown in Figure 6, two command-line flags are supported\n\nby the v2 executable; namely, -o and -t. The -o flag can be\n\nused to store the execution output log into a file instead\n\n\nof printing it to standard output. The -t flag can be used\n\nto perform a delayed execution. For example, running the\n\nprogram with -t 10 as an argument at 1:08 PM will cause\n\na time delay of approximately two minutes before the\n\nexecutable spawns its main thread at 1:10 PM.\n\n\n**Figure 6 - Command-line argument handling.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.5 v2 IEC 104 Interaction\n\nAfter terminating PServiceControl.exe, and\n```\nPService_PPD.exe (based on the configuration) being\n\n```\n\nrenamed with .MZ appended to its name, the v2 sample\n\nbegins IEC 104 interaction.\n\n\n**Figure 7 - Process termination and file renaming.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe default operation mode (0) set in the station\n\nconfigurations present in our sample produces the\n\nfollowing series of commands:\n\ny TESTFR\n\ny STARTDT\n\ny C_IC_NA_1 (100)\n\ny For each IOA configuration:\n\n‐ `C_SC_NA_1 (45) or C_DC_NA_1 (46) command,`\ndepending on the Single/Double command field in\nthe configuration\n\ny STOPDT\n\nIf the operation mode is set to 1 instead, the sample expects\n\nto find a starting index and an ending index following the\n\nstation configuration, which is then used as a range of\n\nIOAs to iterate through. In this case, the following series of\n\ncommands are generated in our testbed:\n\n\ny TESTFR\n\ny STARTDT\n\ny C_IC_NA_1 (100)\n\ny For each IOA in the range start_index → end_index:\n\n‐ `C_SC_NA_1 (45) with SCO Off and Execute`\n\ny STOPDT\n\ny TESTFR\n\ny STARTDT\n\ny C_IC_NA_1 (100)\n\ny For each IOA in the range start_index → end_index:\n\n‐ `C_DC_NA_1 (46) with DCO Off and Select`\n\n‐ `C_DC_NA_1 (46) with DCO Off and Execute`\n\ny STOPDT\n\nIn Figures 8a and 8b, we show both Single and Double\n\ncommands for range modes starting with 2 and ending with 9:\n\n\n**Figure 8a - Range mode with start index 2 and end index 9, Single commands.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8b - Range mode with start index 2 and end index 9, Single commands.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.6 Main Thread Spawning\n\nThe main thread of both samples contains the code\n\nresponsible for issuing the malicious IEC 104 packets. In v1,\n\nthe main thread is spawned from the Crash export, while in\n\n\nv2 the execution starts from the regular PE entry point. In\n\nboth cases the configuration is parsed before reaching this\n\nstage (Figure 9).\n\n\n**Figure 9 - Main thread spawning.**\n\n\nBeginning with this function, the usage of a structure\n\ndubbed main_config in our decompilation (Figure 10),\n\nbecomes pervasive throughout the codebase. In both the\n\nsamples this structure operates as the main glue between\n\nthe configuration and the rest of the code, independently\n\n\nfrom the configuration format used.\n\nThe way in which main_config is used is a strong indicator\n\nof how the two executables were compiled from the same\n\nsource code and updated over time.\n\n\n**Figure 9 -** `main_config structure definition.`\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.7 TESTFR Frame Inserted in v2\n```\nTESTFR frames in IEC 104 are used between the controlling\n\n```\nstation and the controlled station to periodically check\n\nthe status of a connection and eventually detect\n\ncommunication problems. After having established a TCP\n\n\nconnection, Industroyer v1 begins emitting STARTDT frames.\n\nThis marks the beginning of a data transfer from the\n\ncontrolling station to the controlled station.\n\n\n**Figure 11 - Main thread comparison.**\n\nIndustroyer v2, instead, takes the extra step of sending a TESTFR\n\nframe as we can also observe in the traffic dump (Figure 12).\n\n**Figure 12 -** `TESTFR frame in Industroyer v2`\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.8 Start/Stop Data Transfer Activation\n\nThe functions responsible for creating and sending STARTDT\n\nand STOPDT frames are essentially the same across the\n\ntwo executables. We can spot minor differences in the\n\nway dynamic memory is allocated, but the only functional\n\n\ndifference is a sleep timeout. In v1, it is customizable\n\nthrough the configuration, and in v2 is hardcoded to one\n\nsecond for both the functions.\n\n\n**Figure 13 -** `STARTDT frame creation.`\n\n\nWe can also observe how the invocation of function\n```\nparse_received_packet varies slightly between v1 and v2\n\n```\nof the malware. From a functional perspective, the most\n\n\nimportant update is the ability to reply to TESTFR activation\n\ncommands with TESTFR confirmation frames.\n\n\n**Figure 14 -** `STOPDT frame creation.`\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.9 Prepare/Send Station Command\n\nThe function named in our decompilation as\n```\niec104_prepare_and_send_station_command (Figure 15)\n\n```\nis found in both versions of the malware with similar\n\n\nsemantics. Nevertheless, we can appreciate how in v2 the\n\nfunction can receive more IEC 104 parameters to properly\n\ncustomize the packet payload.\n\n\n**Figure 15 - Function iec104_prepare_and_send_station_command invocation.**\n\n\nA plausible reason for this v2 function is that at first the\n\ndevelopers designed an abstraction that satisfied the initial\n\nrequirements, which over time changed to incorporate\n\nmore flexibility. This is also the general feeling that an\n\n\nanalyst gets when assessing the evolution of this codebase.\n\nA first rough version is developed to achieve a specific goal\n\nand it eventually morphed into a full-fledged framework to\n\nsurgically manipulate IEC 104 payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.10 Use of Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) Instructions\n\n\nSome of the IEC 104 commands are assembled from a bytes\n\ntemplate that is hardcoded in the binaries. The curiosity is\n\nthat in v1 these bytes are handled with x86 SSE instructions,\n\n\nwhile in v2 regular non-SSE instructions are used instead.\n\nThis is typically due to the threat actor choosing different\n\noptimization settings upon compilation (Figure 16).\n\n\n**Figure 16 - Different compiler optimizations between the v1 and v2.**\n\n#### 2.11 Parse_packet_and_log Function\n\n\nThe function dubbed Parse_packet_and_log used in the\n\nmalware provides some basic dissection of the packets\n\nreceived from the controlled station in response to the\n\nissued IEC 104 commands. We discovered an interesting\n\ntypo introduced in Industroyer v2 (line 164) where the\n\n```\nSTOPDT con string is logged rather than the correct\nSTOPDT act, as found in Industroyer v1 (Figure 17).\n\n```\nAlthough this typo does not have functional consequences,\n\nit is an interesting artifact that can seldom be found in a\n\nrefactored codebase.\n\n\n**Figure 17 - Function Parse_packet_and_log.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are a couple of functions used in Parse_packet_and_log\n\nwhich map a code (cause and typeid) to a verbose string\n\ndescription. For unknown reasons, the body of these\n\nfunctions has been removed from the v2 executable. It is\n\n\nextremely unlikely that this is due to the fear of being\n\ndetected, as there are no such precautions throughout the\n\nmalware. We speculate that this might be due to some pre\nprocessor directives.\n\n\n**Figure 18 - Function Parse_packet_and_log.**\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3. Summary\n\nWe conducted a comparative analysis of the artifact\n\nknown as Industroyer2 against the first deployment\n\nof the same toolkit. The evidence presented strongly\n\nsuggests that the threat group is updating the\n\ncodebase over time to meet operational requirements\n\nas they evolve.\n\nAdditionally, we provided a thorough breakdown of the\n\nconfiguration format used by Industroyer2, illustrating\n\n\nthe different options available to customize the behavior\n\nof the IEC 104 payload.\n\nFinally, we want to highlight a major difference between\n\nadvanced threat actors and more ordinary adversaries.\n\nSophisticated operators can not only compromise targets\n\nin-depth to reach the OT network, but they also have the\n\ntechnical capabilities to analyze the targeted environment\n\nand craft custom tools to manipulate OT systems.\n\n\n## 4.
