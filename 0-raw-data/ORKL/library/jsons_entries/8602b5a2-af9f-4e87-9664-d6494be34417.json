Through these months extensive_\n_patching and timely updates helped to reduce the threat, but the risk still exists. In these_\n_datasets Advanced Intelligence, LLC offers a brief data visualization summary of the_\n_Ransomware-&-CVE threat landscape._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis research is based on a unique AdvIntel dataset of High-Value Targets selected from our\nmajor Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet endpoint datasets to showcase the dangers to a\nvariety of different entities.\n\nBesides botnets and direct DarkWeb access, the most common vectors of initial attacks for\nransomware groups are either system CVEs or infrastructural vulnerabilities. To\nrepresent the two latter attack vectors, AdvIntel focused on the two most representative\ndatasets - Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities for the CVE segment of attack and\nFortinet VPN exposure for infrastructure vulnerabilities. The two types of exposures were\nselected based on an adversarial perspective - AdvIntel’s DarkWeb monitoring identified that\n\n\n-----\n\nthese two types of vulnerabilities were the most discussed across the criminal underground.\nThe discussions were performed on forums and chat groups especially favored by the\nransomware syndicates.\n\n**The full visibility of AdvIntel HVT sets is available in AdvIntel Andariel.**\n\n**Industries Statistical Analysis**\n\n**The Microsoft Exchange - Adversarial dataset consists of 8,390 HVT companies**\nfrom the original 2,506,718 collected from AdvIntel’s Andariel Platform.\n\nNext, AdvIntel selected 771 HVT companies from the original 79,128 collected for the\n**Fortinet/Fortigate VPN exposure due to it being a popular attack vector for many**\nransomware groups and nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.\n\nThe sample size for both data sets was chosen utilizing a rigorous process, ensuring\nan adequate sample size, enabling AdvIntel to reach an accurate conclusion regarding\nthe represented industries.\n\n**_Note: Some of the HVT targets were present in several categories. For instance, a_**\n_religious school would be reported in both Education and Religious statistics._\n\n**Microsoft Exchange Server CVEs – Overall Adversarial Dataset: AdvIntel data analysis**\nresulted in 21 industry categories, with a few outliers falling under the “other” category. The\ntop five industries exposed were education with 1,683, finance with 1,675, government with\n**1,129, healthcare with 984, and manufacturing with 819.**\n\nThe top five industries consisted of 75% of all exposures for the Microsoft Exchange\nAdversarial data set. This large percentage highlights how important it is for companies and\norganizations belonging to these specific industries to take preventative measures to protect\nthemselves. If immediate steps are not taken it could result in threat actors conducting\nmalicious operations against them.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Data Source: AdvIntel HVT Dataset - Microsoft Exchange Vulnerability_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fortinet VPN Gateways: Data analysis resulted in 22 industry categories with multiple**\nexposures, while the remaining industries fell into the “other” category. The top five industries\nexposed were service with 234, government with 111, finance with 110, manufacturing with\n**83, and education with 73.**\n\nAnalysis shows the top five industries consisted of 78% of all exposures for the Fortinet VPN\ngateways data set. This attack vector is popular with ransomware groups and could be\nutilized to perform malicious actions against unprepared organizations.\n\n**Fortinet VPN Case Study & Industry Review**\n\n\n-----\n\nFor Fortinet VPN endpoints that could be exploited by malicious actors, 41 HVTs within the\nhealthcare sector have been identified as being at risk of exposure via CVE-2018-13379,\n**CVE-2020-12812, and CVE-2019-5591. Although other sectors recorded a much higher**\nnumber of HVTs with vulnerabilities, the nature of many parts of healthcare, such as\nmanaged healthcare, can amplify the damage to any of the healthcare-related HVTs.\n\n_Data Source: AdvIntel HVT Dataset_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Healthcare: Industry Review**\n\nAdvIntel’s Andariel has assessed over 2,506,718 adversarial collections related to the\npotentially exposed endpoints of Microsoft Exchange Servers worldwide. Statistical analysis\nof a sample of 8,390 High-Value Targets that may be attacked by threat actors via ME\nexposure vulnerability shows that the healthcare sector has a high percentage in the dataset.\nMost notably, the sector has the fourth-most HVTs with potentially exposed endpoints,\nmaking up 12% of all exposures.\n\n_The proportion between subcategories of healthcare: Data Source: AdvIntel HVT Dataset_\n\nOf the 984 ME exposures pertaining to HVTs in the healthcare sector, many are tied to\n**hospitals (10.7%), research companies (9.6%), and pharmaceuticals (7.1%). However,**\nthe proportion of data potentially exposed is likely to be unevenly distributed, since the three\naforementioned categories tend to process and store much more digital information than\nothers, such as local clinics and specialty stores.\n\n\n-----\n\nNonetheless, other subsectors, such as medical devices companies, managed healthcare\nfirms, and medical specialists are still vulnerable to attacks. Ransomware groups can also\ntarget these entities in order to coerce ransom payment since hospitals are prone to pay\nquickly in order to resume day-to-day operations.\n\n_Data Source: AdvIntel HVT Dataset_\n\nOf the significant Fortinet HVTs in the healthcare sector, a large proportion are related to\nresearch institutions, pharmaceuticals, and hospitals, entities that process and store a large\namount of sensitive information.\n\n**Manufacturing: Industry Review**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe manufacturing sector is represented within both datasets. Manufacturing entities\ncomprise 9.8% of potential HVT at risk of data exposure due to Microsoft Exchange\nvulnerabilities and 9.7% of those at risk due to Fortinet vulnerabilities. Within the sector,\nseveral subsectors are particularly present. Key examples are listed below with statistics.\n\nThe U.S Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAdministration (CISA) have warned that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are\nscanning for unpatched Fortinet software in both public and private sector entities.\n\n_The U.S Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure_\n_Security Administration (CISA) have warned that advanced persistent threat (APT)_\n_groups are scanning for unpatched Fortinet software in both public and private sector_\n_entities_\n\nThe manufacturing sector possesses several key traits that render it a highly exploitable\ntarget for threat actors. Manufacturing companies handle a range of highly sensitive\ninformation. Blueprints and patents for products, data on clients with long-term contracts,\nfinancial account information, and personal information on employees are all at risk to threat\nactors. Such information can be encrypted for ransom, exfiltrated for sale on the DarkWeb, or\neven be used for corporate espionage purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, threat actors can pose a direct risk to manufacturing infrastructure.\nManufacturing is a capital-intensive enterprise that is increasingly reliant on digital\ntechnologies for production processes. If threat actors are able to seize control of a network\nat a manufacturing site, they can wreak havoc on production. Assembly lines may be\nstopped, production equipment irreparably damaged, or products ruined. Any of these\noutcomes would result in severe financial consequences for a firm in the form of shutdown\nand recovery costs, while also likely impairing the firm's reputation.\n\n**Religious: Industry Review**\n\nOn April 02, 2021, AdvIntel analysts updated high-value target information regarding the\nMicrosoft Exchange Server and Fortinet VPN vulnerabilities. Previously, it had been identified\nthat 26 religious entities were considered high-value targets that contained vulnerable\nMicrosoft Exchange Server endpoints. However, the update has increased the number to\n134 high-value target religious entities. Based on AdvIntel’s updated dataset, 94% of\n**Christian-affiliated entities, 4.5% of Judaism-affiliated entities, and only 1.5% of Islam-**\n**affiliated entities are at risk of having potentially vulnerable endpoints.**\n\nIn regards to the Fortinet VPN vulnerability, the dataset shows 71.4% of Christian-affiliated\n**entities, 14.3% of Judaism-affiliated and Hinduism-affiliated entities are at risk of having**\npotentially vulnerable gateways.\n\nAdvIntel analysts have detected possible correlations between ransomware groups and their\ninterests in exploiting vulnerabilities from the Microsoft Exchange Server and Fortinet VPN.\n\n\n-----\n\nReligious entities are at risk of potentially being targeted by ransomware groups such as\n**REvil, DearCry, Black Kingdom, Hades, and ransomware partnerships on the DarkWeb. In**\naddition, analysis has shown REvil, Clop, and Hades to have a potential interest in the\nFortinet VPN gateway vulnerabilities. Other known threats include advanced persistent threat\ngroups such as HAFNIUM and cybercriminals on the DarkWeb.\n\n**Education: Industry Review**\n\nEducation entities comprised 20% (1,683) of potential HVTs at risk of data exposure due to\nMicrosoft Exchange vulnerabilities, whereas education entities comprised 9.4% (73) of the\nentities potentially high-value targets at risk of data exposure due to Fortinet VPN\nvulnerabilities.\n\nAlong with healthcare information, the education sector contains financial information of\nfaculty, including payroll and bank account information. This data is particularly enticing to\nthreat actors because this information can be easily exploited for large sums of money on the\nDarkWeb.\n\nWhen a data breach has occurred in a school or university, it is not uncommon for the entity\nto stop its operations until IT support or federal agencies are able to resolve the cyber issue.\nThis can result in severe financial issues as schools and universities must spend more\n\n\n-----\n\nmoney on resolving the issue than being proactive with IT services. It may also cost the\nschools money, as they may lose enrollment because of the distrust in the school or\nuniversity that they can safeguard their personal information from exploitation.\n\n**Real Estate & Commercial Facilities: Industry Review**\n\nData gathered by AdvIntel through the analysis of adversarial feeds and parsing entity data\ncollected on Microsoft Exchange server exposure by Andariel indicate that of the total\nnumber of high-value ME server exposures detected, 10.9% are commercial or real estate\nentities. Comparatively, other sectors like education, government, finance make up 20.1%,\n13.4%, and 19.9% respectively. Exposed commercial and real estate entities are primarily\nbased in the United States and the United Kingdom but include entities from every continent.\n\nBased upon the entity composition, the real estate sector is particularly vulnerable, followed\nby the hospitality sector. Real estate houses key financial information belonging to realty\nclients that can be sold on the DarkWeb and potentially used for financial fraud schemes\nincluding loan and mortgage fraud.\n\nA close second is the hospitality sub-industry. Hospitality is unique because entities within\nthe sector house PII and credit card information on a mass scale and continuously collect it.\nCard dumps operators would view an exposed endpoint from a large, high-value entity in the\nhospitality sub-industry as a golden opportunity to gather credit card information that can be\nsold on the DarkWeb or exploited by the threat actor.\n\n**AdvIntel designated 771 total entities as high value based upon the data parsed from**\n**the Fortinet exposure. Out of the 771 total entities, entities pertaining to the**\n**commercial and real estate sector comprise 271, totaling 35.1% of HVTs.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Government & Tribal: Industry Review**\n\nWhile identifying government entities on the HVT dataset, AdvIntel analysts broke down the\ngovernment sector into sub-sectors to gain a better insight into the entities exposed.\nAmongst the government entities with potential exposure points, 65% were in the United\n**States while 35% were found in other countries around the world. In the United States,**\nlocal government entities were found to have the most potentially vulnerable endpoints.\n**Towns or villages make up 7%, cities make up 20%, and counties make up 14% of**\nexposed local governments. Local governments are valuable targets for ransomware\ngangs.\n\n\n-----\n\nOf the 771 entities, AdvIntel analysts had identified 111 of them pertaining to the government\nsector, which is 14% of the total entities. When broken further, the data shows that cities\ncomprise 16%, counties comprise 25%, and towns or villages combined make 4%, which\nidentifies local government entities as possessing potentially vulnerable endpoints at 45%.\nThe second highest are foreign governments at 17%, followed by state governments and\n**federal governments with both at 13% each.**\n\n**Finance: Industry Review**\n\nFinally, the financial industry entities were also majorly represented in our HVT datasets. This\nindustry is possibly the most targeted by cybercrime gangs. AdvIntel analyzed the financial\nindustry, which contained 110 entities from the selected data. The largest sub-sector from the\nFortiNet exposure belonged to banks with 26% of the total entities. Investment\n**organizations and capital management institutions tied for second in exposures for the**\nsub-sectors within the financial industry at 24%, while the holdings sub-sector came in third\nat 21%.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdvIntel analyzed the financial industry s 1,675 entities, which were 20% of the total exposed\nindustries for the Microsoft Exchange exposures. The number one exposed sub-sector at\n43% were holding entities, followed by banks at 33%, and investment companies were the\nthird-largest exposed group at 14%. The two largest sub-sectors, holdings and banks,\nresulted in 76% of the exposed entities.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis report was focused on potential victimology for the attacks that may potentially be\ninitiated via the exposure of both infrastructural or system CVE vulnerabilities. In the\nfollowing report, AdvIntel will focus on the adversarial perspective and illustrate which groups\nare the most interested to perform an attack using these specific exploits or CVEs. We will\ndemonstrate a deep dive into the DarkWeb communications and statements by the top-tier\nthreat actor groups to illustrate how these criminal organizations are aiming to weaponize the\nabove-listed exposures and, potentially attempt to attack the companies and organizations\nfrom the dataset analyzed in this report.\n\n**_Advanced Intelligence is an elite threat prevention firm.
