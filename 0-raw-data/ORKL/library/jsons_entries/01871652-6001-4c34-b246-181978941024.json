In a\nrecent incident reported on April 8, 2015, TV5 Monde, one of France’s largest global television networks was\nattacked by hackers, resulting in the disruption of eleven TV5 Monde’s channels. According to TV5 Monde, a\nhacker group claiming to be linked to the Islamic State Group executed the attack.\n\nThis report analyzes the malwares used in the targeted attack against TV5 Monde in France.\n\n### Attack Outline \n\nAt 10 pm on April 8, 2015, TV5 Monde fell victim to a cyberattack by Islamic fundamentalist hacker group,\n“Cyber Caliphate”, which claims to be linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Back in January\n2015, this group hacked into the official Twitter account of the United States Central Command.\n\nIn this incident, 11 programme broadcasts of TV5 Monde channels were disrupted for 3 hours as the hacker\ngroup breaches the Network’s internal systems and overriding the digital broadcast system. The hacker\ngroup also took control of the Network’s administrative systems making emails inaccessible. The Network’s\nsocial media accounts and website were not spared. The Network’s Facebook account was hacked, and\nmade to display images of ISIS.\n\n[Figure 1] French newspaper article on TV5Monde attack\n\nComplete details on the attack are still uncertain, but the Network’s soft approach to security was exposed\non live television.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 2] Live television displays usernames and passwords on wall\n\n\nA live interview with a reporter the next day of the attack displayed usernames and passwords written on\npost-it notes. One of the post-it notes revealed the network's passwords for YouTube. Twitter user “pent0thal”\nconfirmed that the password was \"lemotdepassedeyoutube,\" which translates in English to \"the password of\nYouTube.\"\n\n[Figure 3] Another password spotted\n\n\n-----\n\nThe same user, pent0thal, discovered another password in a publicly broadcasted segment of the news,\nwhich can be seen above. TV5Monde’s negligent approach to security, like writing account information on\nnotepads pasted on walls, may have contributed to the hacking incident.\n\nOn April 9, 2015, Blue Coat, a security vendor, released a press statement on the TV5Monde attack.\n\n[Figure 4] Press statement by Blue Coat (*Source: Blue Coat Blog)\n\nAccording to this statement, the malware used in the TV5 Monde attack is a variant of Njworm that is popular\nin the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Findings #1: Njrat and Njworm, based in the Middle East\n\nA Kuwaiti, known by the alias “njq8”, created NjRAT and Njworm. A simple search on the web shows that\nthere are numerous online video tutorials in the Arabic language sharing knowledge on executing and\nexploiting with njRAT and Njworm. This level of knowledge sharing and support is making the backdoor\nmalware popular among attackers in the Middle-East region.\n\n[Fig, 5] Video tutorial in the Arabic language\n\n(*Source: www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKtoONku1w0)\n\nMany variants of this malware have been found ever since the source code was disclosed in May 2013. A C#\nsource code generator was even uploaded on an Arabic developer’s site on December 8, 2014.\n\nWith the increase in threats involving this malware, Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) took down\nthe NjRAT and Njworm malware families in June 2014. These malware families are believed to have been\ncreated by Kuwaiti, Naser Al Mutairi, aka njq8, and Algerian, Mohamed Benabdellah, aka Houdini.\n\nThere is also VB source code generators. The VBS codes are slightly different as compared to the C#\nsource code generator, but it performs the same action – stealing personal information and acting as a\nbackdoor. When the VB source code generator runs, the attacker must enter the port number, and specify\nthe host address, name, directory and installation name. The output files created could be slightly different.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Findings #2: Source code generator and generation process\n\nLet’s take a look at how some source code generators work.\n\n1. Source Code Generator 1\n\nWhen you execute the generator, a window to set the port will appear. Then, a message stating the port is\nsuccessfully connected will appear as below.\n\n[Figure 6] Port connected\n\nIf you right-click on the white bar on the message above, a window will appear to send commands. The\ncommand types are divided into w0rm, Computer, Run and Options, and you can send various commands\nbased on the command type.\n\n[Figure 7] Command window\n\nAfter selecting a command, and clicking Builder, a window to initialize the IP and port will appear. You can\nspecify the host, port, name and install name, and select one of the six directories.\n\n[Figure 8] Generating source codes through Builder\n\n2. Source Code Generator 2\n\nLet us take a look at another source code generator. When you open the generator, a window to enter the\nport number as in [Figure 9] and a window to specify a few settings as in [Figure 10] will appear.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 9] Home screen for Source Code Generator 2\n\n[Figure 10] Settings page\n\nThe command type is simpler. The options are only Run File, VBS Code and Uninstall Worm.\n\n[Figure 11] Command window\n\nYou can specify the host, port, name and install name. The Spread File Name and directory has been\nmodified.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 12] Settings page for Source Code Generator 2\n\nThe biggest difference between the two source code generators is the process to verify whether the\nenvironment is a virtual environment or physical environment.\n\nSource Code Generator 1 does not include a function to verify the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, Source Code Generator 2 offers vmcheck() function at the beginning of the exploit codes,\nwhere if it is verified that the environment is verified as virtual, the exploit code jumps to a process that\nimmediately deletes the VBS file and terminates.\n\n### Findings #3: VB script backdoor\n\nThe malware used in TV5Monde attack is a VBS (Visual Basic Script) malware created with one of these\nsource code generators. It steals personal information and allows remote control, and performs the following\nactions:\n\n1. Create files\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\SecurityNajaf.vbs\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\LocalSettings\\Temp\\(Original).vbs\n\n2. Enable auto-run via Registry\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\SecurityNajaf \"wscript.exe //B\n\"SecurityNajaf.vbs\"\"\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\SecurityNajaff \"wscript.exe //B\n\"SecurityNajaf.vbs\"\"\n\n3. Communicate with C&C server\n\nThe scripts are divided into initialization codes and backdoor codes. The initialization codes contain install\nname, IP and port details.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 13] Initialization codes\n\nThe backdoor codes define the action of the commands sent to the C&C server.\n\n[Figure 14] Remote command execution codes\n\nThis malware not only acts as a backdoor, but also steal user information that includes user name, computer\nname, volume serial number and Windows version.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 15] System information extraction codes\n\nThe originating address of the detected malware was the malware itself, so it is determined and highly\npossible that it was created for testing.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAhnLab has investigated the malware that seized control of France’s TV5Monde and disrupting the\nbroadcast of 11 TV5Monde’s channels. Television networks are the perfect targets for cyber-attacks intended\nfor political reasons and it has been proven possible for attackers to take control of the television broadcast.\nTelevision broadcast companies have an immediate need to reinforce security and take targeted attacks\nseriously. Malware that are widely used in specific countries or regions could be executed as political attacks,\nso it is also important to be up-to-date about these malware.\n\n<References>\n\n- French TV station TV5Monde hit by Islamic State hack\n\nwww.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3031644/French-TV5Monde-hitpro-Islamic-State-hackers.html\n\n- Simple njRAT Fuels Nascent Middle East Cybercrime Scene\n\nwww.symantec.com/connect/blogs/simple-njrat-fuels-nascent-middleeast-cybercrime-scene\n\n- New RATs Emerge from Leaked Njw0rm Source Code\n\nhttp://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-rats-emerge-fromleaked-njw0rm-source-code\n\n- www.eff.org/files/2013/12/28/quantum_of_surveillance4d.pdf\n\n- ttp://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2015/04/09/les-sites-de-tv5-monde-detournes-par-un-groupeislamiste_4612099_4408996.html\n\n- www.cnbc.com/id/102330338\n\n- https://twitter.com/pent0thal\n\n- www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2015--04-09/visual-basicscript-malware-reportedly-used-tv5-monde-intrusion\n\n- www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKtoONku1w0\n\n- https://jomgegar.com/topic/14665-njrat-v07dbuilderstub-fullsource-code/\n\n- ttp://blogs.technet.com/b/mmpc/archive/2014/06/30/microsoftdigital-crimes-unit-disrupts-jenxcus-and-bladabindimalware-families.aspx\n\n- http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2014/06/30/microsoft-takes-onglobal-cybercrime-epidemic-in-tenth-malware-disruption/\n\n\n-----\n\nAhnLab, Inc.\n[www.ahnlab.com](http://www.ahnlab.com/)\n© 2015 AhnLab, Inc.
