(the “Company”) detected a cyberattack on its\ninformation technology systems. The Company promptly implemented a series of\ncontainment measures to address this situation including temporarily shutting down the\naffected systems and related operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Company is actively engaged in restoring the affected systems and returning to normal\nlevels of operations. At this time, the Company is not aware of any data loss from its\nsystems or any other loss of assets as a result of this attack. Although cyberattacks can be\nunpredictable, the Company does not currently expect this incident will have a material\nimpact on its business operations or its financial results.\n\nBleepingComputer has been actively tracking this attack after a source in the cybersecurity\nindustry told us last week that Steelcase suffered a Ryuk ransomware attack.\n\nWe were told that Steelcase's devices were encrypted by Ryuk after first being targeted by\n[the same group behind the recent attack on Sopra Steria and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/french-it-giant-sopra-steria-hit-by-ryuk-ransomware/) [Universal Health Services.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uhs-hospitals-hit-by-reported-country-wide-ryuk-ransomware-attack/)\n\nIf you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can\n[confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.](http://10.10.0.46/tel:+16469613731)\n\nThose attacks utilized either the BazarLoader or TrickBot infections, which ultimately\nprovide remote access to the Ryuk Ransomware threat actors, who then compromise the\n[rest of the network and deploy Ryuk.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bazarloader-used-to-deploy-ryuk-ransomware-on-high-value-targets/)\n\n**BazarBackdoor attack flow**\n\nSource: [Advanced Intel](https://www.advanced-intel.com/)\nIt is unknown how many devices were encrypted or if business operations were impacted\nother than the shutting down of the network.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Steelcase with further questions but has not heard back.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Luxury fashion house Zegna confirms August ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/luxury-fashion-house-zegna-confirms-august-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Ryuk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ryuk/)\n[SEC](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sec/)\n[Steelcase](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/steelcase/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
