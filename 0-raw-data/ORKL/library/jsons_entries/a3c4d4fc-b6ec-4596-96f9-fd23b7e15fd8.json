My family and I have been left, disabled, homeless, victimized by\nproperty management companies, unable to obtain legal representation and evicted by\na known corrupt mortgage company/bank. We have had pages of Apple itune charges,\natm withdraws which mimic our past behavior, but of which we did not make. We had a\nlarge sum of money disappear from our bank account were told my husband did it\nthrough the drive they and must have a double life I do not know about. I have fried,\nsince 2011, two iMac hard drives which at time of purchase was assured in my life time\nI could not fill up their available space or crash the hard drive, let alone two in three\nyears.\n\nI'd worry about the Networks connected to the FBI, this is the very reason the FBI is not\ncapable of handling cryptographic keys. The private sector draws the most talent.\nObviously that talent wasn't there. Its bad enough they let something in, but not to\ndetect it via log or IPS, that's a problem.\n\nThe skills are in the private sector., this is why the FBI can't manage keys. I'd be\nconcerned about the networks they attach to. I'm sure other agencies lose trust in\nthem. Simple logging and IPS should have caught this within a day. it's poor\nmanagement .\n\nHow is this not front page news???? This breach far surpasses anything brought to\nlight by our hero whistle-blowers many whose lives have suffered terribly for exposing\nthe truth to the people of this country. The people need only realize their majority power\nto change this way of life and rise up! #freeanons #deletetheelite\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther info on this report... routine advisory my ass!!!
