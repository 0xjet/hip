The author gets an exclusive look_\n_at the raging cyber-war—Operation Aurora! Operation Shady rat!—and learns why Washington has_\n_been slow to fight back._\n\nLying there in the junk-mail folder, in the spammy mess of mortgage offers and erectiledysfunction drug ads, an e-mail from an associate with a subject line that looked legitimate\ncaught the man’s eye. The subject line said “2011 Recruitment Plan.” It was late winter of 2011.\nThe man clicked on the message, downloaded the attached Excel spreadsheet file, and\nunwittingly set in motion a chain of events allowing hackers to raid the computer networks of\nhis employer, RSA. RSA is the security division of the high-tech company EMC. Its products\nprotect computer networks at the White House, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National\nSecurity Agency, the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, most top defense\ncontractors, and a majority of Fortune 500 corporations.\n\nThe parent company disclosed the breach on March 17 in a filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. The hack gravely undermined the reputation of RSA’s popular SecurID\nsecurity service. As spring gave way to summer, bloggers and computer-security experts found\nevidence that the attack on RSA had come from China. They also linked the RSA attack to the\npenetration of computer networks at some of RSA’s most powerful defense-contractor\nclients—among them, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and L-3 Communications. Few\ndetails of these episodes have been made public.\n\n\nThe RSA and defense-contractor hacks are among the latest battles in a\ndecade-long spy war. Hackers from many countries have been\nexfiltrating—that is, stealing—intellectual property from American\ncorporations and the U.S. government on a massive scale, and Chinese\nhackers are among the main culprits. Because virtual attacks can be\nrouted through computer servers anywhere in the world, it is almost\nimpossible to attribute any hack with total certainty.\n\n\n**“The difference with**\n\n**cyber is there are**\n**people trying to fly**\n**planes into buildings**\n\n**every day now.**\n\n**And everybody just**\n**looks the other way.”**\n\n\nDozens of nations have highly developed industrial cyber-espionage\nprograms, including American allies such as France and Israel. And because the People’s\nRepublic of China is such a massive entity, it is impossible to know how much Chinese hacking is\ndone on explicit orders from the government. In some cases, the evidence suggests that\ngovernment and military groups are executing the attacks themselves. In others, Chinese\nauthorities are merely turning a blind eye to illegal activities that are good for China’s economy\nand bad for America’s. Last year Google became the first major company to blow the whistle on\nChinese hacking when it admitted to a penetration known as Operation Aurora, which also hit\n\n_Page 1 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nIntel, Morgan Stanley, and several dozen other corporations. (The attack was given that name\nbecause the word “aurora” appears in the malware that victims downloaded.) Earlier this year,\ndetails concerning the most sweeping intrusion since Operation Aurora were discovered by the\ncyber-security firm McAfee. Dubbed “Operation Shady rat,” the attacks (of which more later)\n\n\n_Most companies have_\n\n_preferred not to talk_\n\n_about or even_\n_acknowledge violations of_\n\n_their computer systems,_\n\n_for fear of panicking_\n\n_shareholders and_\n_exposing themselves to_\n_lawsuits—or for fear of_\n\n\n_offending the Chinese_\n_and jeopardizing their_\n_share of that country’s_\n\n\nare being reported here for the first time. Most companies have\npreferred not to talk about or even acknowledge violations of their\ncomputer systems, for fear of panicking shareholders and exposing\nthemselves to lawsuits—or for fear of offending the Chinese and\njeopardizing their share of that country’s exploding markets. The\nU.S. government, for its part, has been fecklessly circumspect in\ncalling out the Chinese.\n\nA scattered alliance of government insiders and cyber-security\nexperts are working to bring attention to the threat, but because of\nthe topic’s extreme sensitivity, much of their consciousness-raising\nactivity must be covert. The result in at least one case, according to\ndocuments obtained by Vanity Fair, has been a surreal new creation\nof American bureaucracy: government-directed “hacktivism,” in\nwhich an intelligence agency secretly provides information to a\ngroup of private-sector hackers so that truths too sensitive for the\ngovernment to tell will nevertheless come out.\n\n\n_exploding markets._\n\n\nThis unusual project began in March, when National Security Agency officials asked a private\ndefense contractor to organize a cadre of elite non-government experts to study the RSA cyberattacks. The experts constituted a SEAL Team Six of cyber-security and referred to their work as\nOperation Starlight. “This is the N.S.A. outsourcing the finger-pointing to the private sector,”\nsays one person who was invited to join the group and has been privy to its e-mail logs. The\nN.S.A. provided Operation Starlight with the data it needed for its forensic analysis.\n\nOperation Starlight’s secret “Working Draft Version 0.2” report, dated April 4, 2011, has a cover\npage that bears a galactic image resembling a meteor-pockmarked moon. The source who\nprovided Vanity Fair with the document emphasized that the draft is just that—a draft—and\nsaid that Starlight’s provisional conclusions are subject to change. (The source also says that\nOperation Starlight’s analysis will continue for a matter of months, and possibly as long as a\nyear.) As of April, however, the draft report argued that the RSA hacks represent an “organized,\nconcerted campaign on behalf of China.” It also suggested that RSA had been under attack,\nperhaps by different groups, for months prior to the attack that the company acknowledged in\nMarch. In July, in the lengthiest interview RSA officials have given since their troubles began,\nexecutive chairman Art Coviello and EMC chief security officer Dave Martin resisted those\nsuggestions. Coviello admitted that the SecurID hack was preceded in March by “pretty heavyduty reconnaissance.” He refused to say specifically when the attack began or ended, but\ndescribed the duration as “a matter of days, not weeks.” He agreed that the evidence\n\n_Page 2 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nsuggested that the SecurID attack had come from a nation-state, but declined to accuse a\nspecific country.\n\n## ““TThhee AAddvveerrssaarryy””\n\nIf you were designing a new jetfighter for Lockheed Martin, sooner or later you would have to\ntravel to an air-force base to talk to military personnel about what they want the new jetfighter\nto do. Meetings over, you’d go back to your hotel room, fire up your laptop, and log on to\nLockheed’s remote network to get some work done. In order to log on, you’d have to glance\ndown at an inch-long red-white-blue-and-gray plastic key-chain fob, shaped vaguely like a key,\non which a little L.E.D. screen displays strings of six to eight digits that change every minute or\nso. Adding those numbers to the basic password that you’d memorized, you would type the\nwhole hybrid string of characters into the Lockheed-network log-in box—and then you would\nbe in. That key fob, called a SecurID token, is RSA’s best-known product. The strings of numbers\non its screen are generated by a microchip using the SecurID algorithm and a unique\ncryptographic seed.\n\nEach numeric string is called a “one-time password,” and, when entered in combination with\nyour own chosen password, it bumps up your network’s security by means of “two-factor\nauthentication.” As of March 2011, RSA commanded 70 percent of the market for this form of\nsecurity. More than 25 million of these tokens are in circulation, and for years they have been\nused by most U.S. intelligence and military officers, defense contractors, White House officials,\nand Fortune 500 executives.\n\nSo it was of great concern to many of the **_Within two months, the impossible had come_**\nworld’s most powerful people when, on **_to pass. Attackers … had broken into_**\nthe same day the company alerted the **_Lockheed Martin’s network using SecurID_**\nS.E.C., executive chairman Coviello **_information stolen from RSA._**\nposted an open letter to customers on\nRSA’s Web site, announcing that the company’s security system had identified “an extremely\nsophisticated cyber attack in progress,” an attack that “resulted in certain information being\nexported from RSA’s systems,” some of which was “specifically related to RSA’s SecurID twofactor authentication products.”\n\n\nThe letter was so vague and judiciously bland that many readers assumed what the later\nLockheed hack seemed to suggest: that SecurID’s seed-key algorithm and some, if not all, of its\nseed-key database may have been stolen. RSA executives have consistently refused to say\nprecisely what the company lost. Coviello did say in an interview that “the information taken, in\nand of itself, would not allow a direct attack.” An attacker, he went on, “would have had to get\nother information that only the customer had in their possession.” To weaponize the stolen\nSecurID information would require a strategy of coordinated intrusions, involving attacks not\njust on RSA but also preliminary attacks on every other target company—something that\nseemed so complicated as to be almost impossible. Yet within two months, the impossible had\n\n_Page 3 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\ncome to pass. Attackers, whom security experts often refer to in the satanic singular as “the\nAdversary,” had broken into Lockheed Martin’s network using SecurID information stolen from\nRSA.\n\nOn April 1, the RSA Web site published a blog posting titled “Anatomy of an Attack” by the\ncompany’s head of new technologies, Uri Rivner. Chatty and anecdotal, it described the “2011\nRecruitment Plan” e-mail, one of two e-mails sent to low-level employees. (“You wouldn’t\nconsider these users particularly high profile or high value targets,” Rivner wrote.) The post said\nnothing about when the attack began, how long it lasted, or what was taken, but some of\nRivner’s language seems intended to suggest that the intrusion was short-lived: “Since RSA\ndetected this attack in progress, it is likely the attacker had to move very quickly to accomplish\nanything.” Rivner wrote that the RSA hackers used a Flash zero-day vulnerability—that is, a flaw\nin the code that is unknown to the program’s developers and has not been used in prior\nattacks—to install an extremely common downloader called Poison Ivy. But he gave no details\nabout the malware that Poison Ivy downloaded into RSA’s system.\n\nRivner characterized the attackers’ technique as a form of “Advanced Persistent Threat,” or\nA.P.T.—security lingo for “Pretty sure it came from China,” in the words of Brian Krebs, a\nleading cyber-security blogger. According to Operation Starlight’s draft report, some of the\nmalware that was used to attack RSA was “compiled,” or written, in December of 2010—a full\nthree months before the SecurID hack. “APT attack groups typically launch their attacks within\nhours of compilation, providing a useful date indicator for the targeted intrusion,” the draft\nsays. The draft acknowledges that “these compile dates are easily modified,” but it goes on:\n“The earliest compile date [of malware used in the RSA hack] that\nhas not been materially modified is 12/22/2010, potentially\nproviding at least three months of persistent access into RSA **“The Adversary stayed**\n\n**under the radar by making**\n\noperations.” One prominent cyber-security analyst with firsthand\n\n**an ingeniously malevolent**\n\nknowledge of the RSA intrusions confirms that RSA appeared to\n\n**move: taking control of the**\n\nbe under attack by other A.P.T. groups prior to the SecurID hack.\n\n**companies’ virtual Help**\n\nThese groups “were not going after seed values,” the analyst says,\n\n**Desks, impersonating their**\n\nthough “we don’t know whether they were doing advanced\n\n**IT help-desk staff, and**\n\nreconnaissance” for the later attacks.

Coviello, for his part, says “we have no evidence” of **themselves.”**\nintrusions beginning earlier than March.\n\n\nThe SecurID hack, whenever it began and however long it lasted, was a sophisticated intrusion.\nThough RSA has not said how the Adversary managed to stay undetected inside its network,\nprevious examples of stealth techniques used by A.P.T. attackers illustrate how resourceful they\ncan be. Jonathan Pollet, the head of Red Tiger Security, based in Houston, Texas, was hired in\n2010 by three Fortune 100 companies to clean up after a spate of cyber attacks that came from\nservers in China. (These intrusions were similar in many ways to the attacks known as Night\nDragon, which targeted various energy industries at about the same time.) Pollet says the\n\n_Page 4 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nvictims knew that something strange was going on because they kept getting locked out of their\ne-mail accounts for no apparent reason. But the Adversary stayed under the radar by making an\ningeniously malevolent move: taking control of the companies’ virtual I.T. help desks,\nimpersonating their I.T. help-desk staff, and answering employees’ service complaints\nthemselves. “Attackers want to be a parasite, want to make sure the host is happy,” says Pollet.\n“So if they know the help desk is going to get overwhelmed with complaints, they decide, ‘Let’s\njust solve these problems ourselves.’ ”\n\n## BBooddyy CCoouunntt\n\nChina’s aggressive campaign of cyber-espionage began about a decade ago, with attacks on U.S.\ngovernment agencies. (The details have still not been divulged.) Then China broadened the\n\n\nscope of its efforts, infiltrating the civilian sector\n\n**“Today we see pretty much any company that** in order to steal intellectual property and gain\n\n**has valuable intellectual property or trade** competitive advantage over Western companies.\n**secrets of any kind being pilfered continually, all** Dmitri Alperovitch, vice president of threat\n\n**day long, every day, relentlessly.”** research at McAfee, who gave Aurora and Night\n\nDragon their names and has written definitive\nstudies of A.P.T. attacks, says that “today we see pretty much any company that has valuable\nintellectual property or trade secrets of any kind being pilfered continually, all day long, every\nday, relentlessly.”\n\nSome of China’s intellectual-property thefts are like virtual cat burglaries; others are inside jobs;\nand many combine elements of both. Dongfan “Greg” Chung, a former Boeing and Rockwell\nengineer, was convicted in 2009 of acting as an agent of the P.R.C. in stealing secrets related to\nthe Space Shuttle program and the Delta IV rocket. In March of this year, a man named Sixing\n“Steve” Liu, a Chinese engineer who worked for a division of L-3 Communications, was arrested\non charges of illegally exporting military data to China. (Liu has pleaded not guilty and the case\nis pending.) A former Google executive told me, “The party is very aggressive in enforcing\nloyalty among Chinese employees of American companies. This creates a dilemma of divided\nloyalties. Google’s response was to take the risk and plow ahead. Google did not hire private\ninvestigators. There may have been a cost for that.” Early news coverage of Operation Aurora,\nagainst Google, indicated that some Google China employees had been denied access to\ninternal networks and others had been put on leave or reassigned in the wake of the attacks.\nAccording to a Google spokesperson, the company “ran some tests … internally to ensure that\nthe network was safe and secure and we gave Googlers in China a holiday on the Tuesday we\nmade the announcement.”\n\nThe vulnerability of corporations to attack stems in part from ignorance, in part from denial.\nGoogle executives reportedly believed that the American government monitors this country’s\nInternet infrastructure the same way it monitors foreign military threats to keep the geographic\nhomeland secure. A former White House official told me, “After Google got hacked, they called\nthe N.S.A. in and said, ‘You were supposed to protect us from this!’ The N.S.A. guys just about\n\n_Page 5 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nfell out of their chairs. They could not believe how naïve the Google guys had been.” (In\nresponse to detailed questions regarding Operation Aurora and the company’s response to it,\nGoogle declined to comment.)\n\nMartin Libicki, a Rand Corporation analyst and the author of Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar,\nsays that the 2007 hack of Defense Secretary Robert Gates’s computer finally made some in\nWashington take the cyber-espionage problem seriously. The Pentagon has admitted that in\nJune of that year it had to shut down part of the computer system in Gates’s office after the\nattack, which senior U.S. officials attributed to the People’s Liberation Army. “It got personal at\nthat point,” Libicki says. Other Western nations started talking publicly about the problem at\naround the same time. In August of that same year, German chancellor Angela Merkel\nreportedly confronted Chinese premier Wen Jiabao after hackers from his country gained\naccess to the computers in her office, as well as those in the German foreign, economic, and\nresearch ministries. In December, M.I.5 sent a letter to 300 British C.E.O.’s and security chiefs\nwarning them that state-sponsored Chinese organizations may have been spying on their\ncomputer systems.\n\nPublic awareness of cyber-espionage was dramatically heightened in January 2010 when\nGoogle started talking about Operation Aurora. Operation Aurora gathered source code, the\nvirtual equivalent of Coca-Cola’s secret formula, from a broad array of U.S. corporations.\nBecause source code is so valuable, and because the manner of its theft was so innovative,\nmany experts were puzzled by the way that Google announced the attacks, emphasizing\nAurora’s secondary goal (reconnaissance of “human-rights activists” in China) rather than its\nprimary one (stealing Google’s virtual DNA).\n\nAccess to source code makes it relatively easy to discover new vulnerabilities in a Web\napplication. For malware writers, these vulnerabilities are the keys to the kingdom, the open\nwindows in the house that let them get inside to steal the furniture—or, depending on their\ngoals, to move the furniture around, by altering the code and therefore potentially changing\nthe functions of the company’s product.\n\nIt was eventually revealed that intruders had made off with source code for a Google passwordmanagement program called Gaia. The company’s\nlosses are widely rumored to have been much greater, _Access to source code makes it relatively_\nhowever. New information from security experts who _easy to discover new vulnerabilities in a_\nwere personally briefed by Google’s security chief, _Web application._\nHeather Adkins, while Operation Aurora unfolded,\n\n_For malware writers, these vulnerabilities_\n\noffers a far more comprehensive picture of the attack\n\n_are the keys to the kingdom._\n\nthan Google publicly told.\n\nThree people who visited Google’s Mountain View, California, headquarters while the attacks\nwere in progress describe dramatic scenes of a company under siege. Google “built a physically\nseparate area for the security team,” one of them says. Sergey Brin, one of the company’s co\n_Page 6 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nfounders, was deeply involved in the cyber-defense. “He moved his desk to go sit with the\nAurora responders every day. Because he grew up in the Soviet Union, he personally has a real\nhard-on for the Chinese now. He is pissed.” Caught unawares and shorthanded, the company\nmade a list of the world’s top security professionals, and Brin personally called to offer them\njobs—with $100,000 signing bonuses for some, according to one person who received such an\noffer—and quickly built Google’s small, pre-Aurora security operation into a group of more than\n200.\n\nMeanwhile, representatives of other companies hit by Aurora were invited to the Googleplex\nfor private meetings with Adkins. She told two of the visitors that the attackers had made a\nbeeline for Google’s “legal-discovery portals,” the system the company uses to evaluate\nrequests for information from law-enforcement agencies and foreign governments. “The\nactivity on those portals is closely monitored,” one visitor says. “Someone noticed that a bunch\nof Chinese names were queried on one woman’s computer [in the legal-discovery department]\nand asked her, ‘Why did you query all these people?’ She said, ‘I didn’t.’ ”\n\nSecurity took her laptop to analyze it, and “that was the string they started pulling” that\nunraveled the Aurora attack.\n\nMuch more significant, however—and previously unreported—is that the intruders used\nGoogle’s internal search engine to look for words related to the company’s signing certificates:\nvirtual credentials that verify the identity of the source of any software before it can be\n\n\n_In both Operation_\n\n_Aurora and the_\n_RSA hack, not only_\n\n_did the attackers_\n\n_seek to steal_\n\n_proprietary_\n_information, they_\n\n_sought to steal_\n\n\ndownloaded to a computer. This part of the attack was foiled\nbecause Google keeps its signing certificates offline, in an “airgapped” network—a network that is not connected to the Internet.\n\nThe search for signing certificates is a disturbing new piece of\ninformation about Operation Aurora’s intentions. It also suggests a\nlink to the SecurID theft. In both Operation Aurora and the RSA hack,\nnot only did the attackers seek to steal proprietary information, they\nsought to steal the digital identities that would allow them to\nimpersonate the companies.\n\n\n_the digital_\n\nGoogle’s initial announcement of Operation Aurora stated that “at\n\n_identities that_\n\nleast twenty other large companies from a wide range of\n\n_would allow them_\n\nbusinesses—including the Internet, finance, technology, media and\n\n_to impersonate_\n\nchemical sectors”—had been affected, and early news reports named\n\n_the companies._\n\nYahoo and Symantec as among the other victims. As the year wore\non, the body count grew: Adobe, Juniper Networks, and Rackspace\nadmitted that they’d been attacked, then Intel. Before long a cache\nof e-mails written by analysts at the security firm HBGary and its sister company HBGary\nFederal were made public, after the companies were caught in the crosshairs of the hacktivist\ngroup Anonymous, a loose coalition of individuals who perform coordinated cyber-attacks,\n\n_Page 7 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nsometimes with the stated goal of advancing Internet freedom. The e-mails revealed that\nAurora or similar attacks had also hit Baker Hughes, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Conoco\nPhillips, Marathon Oil, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, Symantec, Juniper, Disney, Sony,\nJohnson & Johnson, General Electric, General Dynamics, the law firm King & Spalding, and\nDuPont. DuPont was hit so intensely that, one HBGary analyst wrote, “their hair is on fire.”\n\nNot only did the HBGary e-mails\nprovide new details about Aurora, **“Many of the leading defense contractors … all had …**\nthey also described similar attacks that **aurora-type attacks as far back as 2005.”**\nhad been going on for much longer\nthan the public knew. “Many of the leading defense contractors … all had … aurora-type attacks\nas far back as 2005,” one analyst wrote. “So a search engine makes a big media stink about one\nintrusion, and that leads to a bunch of hype? I think the discussion needs to be on why it’s\ntaken 5+ years for the rest of the industry to catch on.”\n\n\n## PPooiinnttiinngg FFiinnggeerrss\n\nFrom the start, Google openly asserted its view that the attack originated in China, and Hillary\nClinton, after being “briefed by Google on these allegations,” issued a statement that pointedly\nsaid, “We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.” A report by Verisign iDefense, a\nsecurity-intelligence service based in Dulles, Virginia, went further, stating that Aurora was\ndirected by “agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof.” The Chinese government made no\nofficial, public response to Clinton’s statement. But shortly thereafter, a spokesman for China’s\nMinistry of Industry and Information Technology told Xinhua, the official news agency, about\nthe allegations regarding Google, that the “accusation that the Chinese government\nparticipated in [any] cyber attack, either in an explicit or inexplicit way, is groundless and aims\nto denigrate China.”\n\nYet, in the case of Aurora, there is evidence of involvement. After researchers found similarities\nbetween the tools used in the Aurora attacks and malware tools that were posted on open\nChinese hacker forums, many analysts speculated that Beijing had employed civilian hackers as\nproxies to launch the attacks. A leading security-intelligence analyst says he received several\ndozen tips from sources in China suggesting that, “in point of fact, it was the P.R.C. government\ntaking or demanding access to some of the research that the hackers had been doing, and then\nusing it themselves.”\n\nThe analyst goes on: “The Chinese government has employed this same tactic in numerous\nintrusions. Because their internal police and military have such a respected or feared voice\namong the hacking community, they can make use of the hackers’ research with their\nknowledge and still keep the hackers tight-lipped about it. The hackers know that if they step\nout of line they will find themselves quickly in a very unpleasant prison in western China,\nturning large rocks into smaller rocks.” In an undated cable made public by WikiLeaks, one\nAmerican diplomat in Beijing reported to Washington that Aurora was an act of revenge\n\n_Page 8 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nordered by a Chinese politburo member who had Googled himself and found a raft of\nunflattering articles.\n\nThe SecurID hack used the same basic technique as Operation Aurora and many other recent\nintrusions, though it made use of different specific tools. The technique, called “spearphishing,” begins with reconnaissance to find personal information about a company’s\nemployees. The Adversary may troll social-networking sites, including\nFacebook and Twitter, or may research e-mail archives exfiltrated in\n\n_“The initial machine is_\n\nprevious attacks to diagram its victims’ social situations.

From the moment you’ve clicked on the\nmalware, there is another individual on the other end adapting to your network eco-system,\nyour security system, and trying various things until they succeed in getting what they want. It’s\nlike a Predator drone in Pakistan that’s being controlled by a joystick in Nevada.”\n\n\nSome of the types of tools that the RSA hackers used—the rat, the command-and-controlserver infrastructure, and the remote domains—had previously been employed in a persistent\nseries of attacks on the Department of Defense and other U.S.-government systems. These\nattacks were originally code-named Titan Rain. After Titan Rain was made public, it was rechristened with the code name Byzantine Hades, and after that name, too, was made public,\nByzantine Hades was re-dubbed with at least three more new classified code names, according\nto a former N.S.A. analyst. Some top intrusion specialists attribute this series of attacks to a\ngroup in China called the Red Hacker Alliance, which has suspected ties to the People’s\nLiberation Army. (The particular malware and command-and-control servers used in the\nSecurID hack, however, were unique, and had not been used in previous attacks.)\n\n## AAcctt ooff WWaarr??\n\nOn May 21, the computer systems of America’s largest military contractor, Lockheed Martin,\ndetected an intruder. A week later, Lockheed acknowledged the breach in a statement. The\ncompany called the attack “significant and tenacious” but also said that it had been detected\n“almost immediately,” at which point the company took “aggressive” actions to stop it. “Our\n\n_Page 9 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nsystems remain secure; no customer, program or employee personal data has been\ncompromised,” the statement said—leaving open the questions of how an intrusion could be\nboth “tenacious” and detected “almost immediately,” and how it could be “significant” without\ncompromising any data. The event was noteworthy enough that President Obama was briefed\non the situation. An unnamed Lockheed executive told The New York Times investigators\n“cannot rule out” a connection to the RSA breach. RSA said that it was “premature to\nspeculate” on the cause of the attack.\n\nOn May 31, news broke that L-3 Communications, which provides intelligence, surveillance, and\nreconnaissance technology to the U.S. government, had also been attacked, according to an email to L-3 employees dated April 6. The e-mail said that L-3 had been “actively targeted with\npenetration attacks leveraging the compromised information” from the RSA breach. When\nasked whether intruders had gained the ability to clone SecurID key fobs, an RSA spokeswoman\nsaid, “That’s not something we had commented on and probably never will.”\n\nThe next day, June 1, Fox News reported that Northrop Grumman had cut off remote access to\nits network without warning, resetting domain names and passwords, and causing “chaos”\nacross the company, according to an unnamed Northrop executive. The company’s official\nresponse to Fox’s questions on the matter was, verbatim, the same as its response to my\n\nquestions about previous reported hacks, going back several years: “We\ndo not comment on whether or not Northrop Grumman is or has been\na target for cyber intrusions.”\n\n_This onslaught of_\n\nThat same day, Google made its first allegation of Chinese hacking since\n\n_revelations was all_\n\nOperation Aurora, announcing that it had thwarted an attempt from\n\n_the more_\n\nChina to steal the Gmail passwords of senior U.S. government officials.\n\n_extraordinary_\n\nThe next week, on June 7, RSA’s Art Coviello gave a mea culpa interview\n\n_because American_ to The Wall Street Journal, admitting that the entire SecurID system was\n_industry has so few_ compromised, offering to replace practically all of the millions of tokens\n\n_incentives to come_ on the market—and infuriating many of its customers, some of whom\n\n_clean about its_ were reported to be sundering their relationship with RSA and hiring\n_losses, and so many_ new security companies. Coviello says that he made the replacement\n\noffer because, “post-Lockheed, customers had a lower tolerance for\n\n_incentives to cover_\n\nrisk,” and he says that “less than 10 percent of our customers have\n\n_them up._\n\nrequested replacement tokens.”\n\nThis onslaught of revelations was all the more extraordinary because\nAmerican industry has so few incentives to come clean about its losses, and so many incentives\nto cover them up. Was it a coincidence that, only hours before Northrop’s and Google’s alleged\nhacks became public, the Pentagon provided an element of its forthcoming cyber-war strategy\nto The Wall Street Journal, declaring that the U.S. will consider some cyber-attacks to be the\nequivalent of physical acts of war?\n\n_Page 10 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nLike so many Rip Van Winkles, most of Washington has been asleep while cyber-attacks\nproliferated. But a few voices have been trying to wake the town up. One belongs to Scott Borg,\ndirector and chief economist of the U.S. Cyber-Consequences Unit, whose research indicates\nthat China, to sustain economic growth, “is relying increasingly on large-scale information theft.\nThis means that cyber attacks are now a basic part of China’s national development strategy.”\n\nAnother voice is that of James A. Lewis, a former diplomat who now leads the Technology and\nPublic Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He says, “The thing\nwe have to work through is, how do we want to work with the Chinese on this issue? This\nadministration has decided they want to cooperate, not have a confrontation.” A senior State\nDepartment official elaborates: “One of the core things we’re trying to do diplomatically is to\nbuild a consensus internationally to build norms of behavior, rules of the road,” as described in\nthe president’s “International Strategy for Cyberspace.” (The norms include “Upholding\nFundamental Freedoms,” “Respect for Property,” and “Right of Self-Defense.”) James A. Lewis\ngoes on: “This is what we did on missile proliferation. Our allies showed up and we all said,\n‘Here are the norms.’ But how do we get a flow of countries to show up and say, ‘You’re\ncrossing a line. Back off, or there will be consequences’? What is the cost to the Chinese right\nnow? Until there is some cost, they’re not going to stop.”\n\nAnother White House document, the “Comprehensive National CyberSecurity Initiative,” as\nwell as several bills in Congress, propose ways of protecting critical infrastructure, such as\nelectrical grids, from cyber-intrusions. China has so thoroughly probed and mapped our power\nsystem that former director of national intelligence Dennis Blair once publicly admitted that “a\nnumber of nations, including Russia and China, can disrupt elements of the U.S. information\ninfrastructure.”\n\n\nStill others are trying to address the economic\nimpact of cyber-espionage. On May 11, Senator\nJay Rockefeller and several of his colleagues sent\na letter to Mary Schapiro, chair of the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, asking the\nS.E.C. to issue interpretive guidance for\ncompanies about disclosing material risk due to\ncyber-breaches. The morning Rockefeller sent his\nletter, Tom Kellermann, a former cyber-security\nspecialist at the World Bank, told me that the\nS.E.C. would force companies to make significant\ndisclosures. “The dragon lady’s gonna rain down\nfire,” he said.\n\n\n**SECURITY BUDGET REQUEST**\n\nCFO: “What’s the worst that can happen if we\ndon’t fix these (65 network vulnerabilities)?”\n\nCIO: “We have large exposure.”\n\nCFO: “No. No. What’s the financial impact?”\n\nCIO: “We’re not regulated or audited, so there\nwon’t be any fines.”\n\nCFO: “You get no budget.”\n\n\nThe dragon lady has her work cut out for her. One industrial-control-systems security specialist\nrecalls a conversation with a chief financial officer and a chief information officer of a major\ncorporation after finding 65 vulnerabilities in the company’s networks, which would have\n\n_Page 11 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nrequired a huge investment to fix. “What’s the worst that can happen if we don’t fix any of\nthese?” the C.F.O. asked.\n\n“We have large exposure,” answered the C.I.O. “We could potentially be attacked—”\n\n“No, no, no. What is the financial impact if we don’t do any of these?”\n\n“We’re not regulated or audited, so there won’t be any fines.”\n\nThe C.F.O. answered, “You get no budget,” and the topic was closed.\n\nThe persistent culture of secrecy surrounding all things cyber compounds the difficulty of taking\npractical steps against Chinese hacking. Much, perhaps most, information about cyber-conflict\nof all types is classified, which creates tremendous practical problems of communication.\nSometimes, when the F.B.I. learns of an intrusion through classified channels, the Bureau has to\nfind other, unclassified evidence of the intrusion in order to be able to tell the victim what is\nhappening. “If it’s a defense contractor being hacked, then the victim company includes people\nwith clearances, so communication is easy. But if you’re talking about a company where no one\nhas clearances, that presents a significant problem”—and can create a significant time delay\nbetween the discovery of a hack and the victim’s awareness of exposure, according to one\ncyber-security analyst.\n\n## PPllaayyiinngg tthhee FFooooll\n\nYet the deeper I delved into the Chinese hacking problem, the more I discovered a network of\nindividuals in government and the private sector who are serving as a semi-official Resistance in\nthis secret war. A handful of influential congressional staffers who shape Hill debate on these\nmatters put me in touch with top intrusion specialists who are former hackers, military\npersonnel, or National Security Agency officials. These analysts are the civilian, cyber-equivalent\nof special-ops forces. When my phone rang very late one night this spring, I was surprised to\nsee the name of one of these analysts on the screen. In the mood to talk, he spent most of an\nhour describing his work to me, naming names and counting losses with shocking precision,\nthough forbidding me to repeat the details of his disclosures.\n\nIn this conversation—the first of several that took place over the following months—the man\nsaid that he had started his career protecting government networks against foreign attacks. On\nthat job, he became so preoccupied with the scale of Chinese hacking that a senior military\nofficer told him to stop talking about it, with the gruff explanation that “the reason this is still\ngoing on is that the Chinese government now owns us.” Frustrated, the analyst eventually left\ngovernment service for the private sector.\n\nThe problem may be reaching a boil that will take significant willpower to ignore. In mid-July,\nthe security firm McAfee shared exclusively with Vanity Fair the results of its latest cyber\n_Page 12 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nespionage investigation. McAfee reports that,\n\n**“There are only two types of companies—those**\n\nover a period of five years, a single Adversary\n\n**that know they’ve been compromised, and**\n\npenetrated more than 70 organizations, from\n\n**those that don’t know. If you have anything that**\n\ngiant multi-national corporations to tiny\n\n**may be valuable to a competitor, you will be**\n\nnonprofits, representing more than 30 industries\n\n**targeted, and almost certainly compromised.”**\n\naround the world, and exfiltrated intellectual\nproperty—including e-mail archives, legal\ncontracts, negotiation plans for business activities, design schematics, and government\nsecrets—as soon as its spear-phishing victims clicked on a link to a Web page. One country’s\nOlympic committee was compromised for a full 28 months; many other organizations were\ncompromised for two whole years. McAfee has given the name Operation Shady rat to this set\nof intrusions. Dmitri Alperovitch, who discovered Operation Shady rat, draws a stark lesson:\n“There are only two types of companies—those that know they’ve been compromised, and\nthose that don’t know. If you have anything that may be valuable to a competitor, you will be\ntargeted, and almost certainly compromised.”\n\nThe full list of Operation Shady rat’s victims includes government agencies and corporations\nworldwide. The vast majority of victims—more than two-thirds of the total—are in the U.S.\nAmong the other countries targeted are Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore,\nIndia, Germany, and the U.K. In 2007, the year before the Beijing Olympics, one international\nathletics organization and the Olympic committees of three different countries were breached\nby this intruder. Alperovitch believes the targeting of the Olympic committees and of American\npolitical nonprofits suggests the intrusions were state-sponsored, explaining, “There’s no\neconomic gain to compromising them.” When asked if the People’s Republic of China was\nconceivably behind Shady rat —given that China was not itself attacked—Alperovitch noted\nthat McAfee’s policy was not to comment on attribution. He added, “If others want to draw\nthat conclusion, I certainly wouldn’t discourage them.”\n\n\nAnother security researcher who was on the front lines during\nOperation Aurora says, “Those of us who are hands-onkeyboard want this story to be told, because we feel like the\ntop corporate managers—following the advice of their\nlawyers—are reflexively keeping breach information secret\nfrom other companies that are trying to defend themselves.\nIn the big picture, a little bit of short-term embarrassment is\nworth it, to get the American people to understand that\nthere’s a low-level Cold War going on.”\n\n\n_“…the top corporate_\n_managers—following the_\n_advice of their lawyers—are_\n_reflexively keeping breach_\n_information secret from other_\n_companies that are trying to_\n_defend themselves._\n\n\nDespite—and also because of—the extreme secrecy\nsurrounding industrial cyber-espionage, this phenomenon is gradually effecting a fundamental\nre-arrangement of the relationship between state and corporate power.\n\n_Page 13 of 14_\n\n\n-----\n\nMichael Hayden was the director of the N.S.A. and then the C.I.A. during the period when the\nproblem of Chinese cyber-espionage developed. In a conversation with him about Operation\nAurora, I asked what he believed to be the most significant fact about those intrusions.\n\nHe answered, “You see Google acting in some ways as nation-states used to act, exercising to\nthe best of their ability some attributes traditionally associated with sovereign states. ‘We’re\ngoing to break relationship’—cease doing business there, you know. It’s something I dwell on a\nlot. The cyberworld is so new that the old structures, you know—state, non-state, public,\nprivate—they all break down …\n\nThe last time we had such a powerful discontinuity is probably the European discovery of the\nWestern Hemisphere. At that point, we had some big, multi-national corporations—East India\nCompany and Hudson’s Bay—that acted as states. And I see elements of that with the big\nMicrosofts and Googles of the world. Because of their size, they actually are making decisions\nthat have the impact of the kinds of decisions made in the halls of government. Google is not a\nstate. But what constitutes Google’s inherent right of self-defense in this new environment\nagainst this kind of attack? I’m not accusing anyone of doing anything wrong. These situations\nare just so different. What do we believe would be legitimate for Google to do in response to\nthis? Now, I don’t have answers. I really don’t know, but it’s a really good question.”\n\nOperation Starlight has an old-fashioned answer to that question: Find the culprits and put\nthem to shame. Its draft report declares: “The attacker’s name, telephone number records, and\nother pertinent information should be divulged to the public in order to support attacker\nattribution and assist in tracking back to the source.”\n\n\nBut no one believes that this tactic by itself will solve the\nproblem—or that corporations will embrace their long-term best\ninterest anytime soon. Rather, so long as executives and politicians\n_are guided by short-term self-interest, they will continue to play the_\n_fool to the country that would be king._\n\n“You need to consider: What are the subconscious assumptions\nthat companies bring to the issue of foreign cyber-attacks on their\nnetworks?” a senior Senate staffer who works on cyber-issues\nasked me.\n\n\n**“The difference with**\n\n**cyber is there are**\n**people trying to fly**\n**planes into buildings**\n\n**every day now.**\n\n**And everybody just**\n**looks the other way.”**\n\n\n“They assume that if something bad happens government will take care of the losses. They act\nlike they don’t really believe that a bank could get completely taken out, or that a tech giant\ncould get its whole lunch eaten, because it sounds as fictional as 9/11 would have sounded\nbefore it happened. But terrorism is not the best analogy here. Who could have imagined that\npeople would have flown airplanes into buildings? The difference with cyber is there are people\ntrying to fly planes into buildings every day now. And everybody just looks the other way.”\n\n_Page 14 of 14_\n\n\nA ti l t d t htt // it f i / lt /f [t](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/09/chinese-hacking-201109) /2011/09/ hi h ki 201109\n\n\n-----",
