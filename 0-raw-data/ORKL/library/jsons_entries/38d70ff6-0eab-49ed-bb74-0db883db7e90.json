The attack is part of a rising wave of\ncyberattacks worrying firms.\n\nBayer factory\n\nA group of hackers known as Wicked Panda accessed Bayer's network in early 2018, the\ncompany said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe hackers reportedly used Winnti malware, which had also been detected at three other,\nsmaller, companies in Germany this year.\n\nWinnti is a China-based hacker groups, of which Wicked Panda is believed to be a member.\nIn Germany they already targeted the computer systems of technology group\n[ThyssenKrupp in 2016.](https://www.dw.com/en/thyssenkrupp-victim-of-cyber-attack/a-36695341)\n\n\"This type of attack points towards the Wicked Panda group in China, according to security\nexperts,\" a company spokesman said, citing evidence gathered by the DCSO cybersecurity\ngroup, which was set up by Bayer in 2015 and includes other German companies such\nAllianz, BASF and Volkswagen.\n\n\n-----\n\nBayer, Germany s largest drugmaker, said it had covertly monitored and analyzed the attack\nup to the end of this March and then cleared the threat from its systems.\"There is no\nevidence of data theft,\" the statement goes on.\n\nWhile public prosecutors in Cologne, Germany have opened an investigation into the\nincident, the former head of Germany's BND foreign intelligence service, Gerhard Schindler,\nsaid on Thursday it was difficult to determine the hackers' location.\n\nBayer is also the world's largest agricultural supplies company after it has taken over US\nchemicals maker Monsanto.\n\n**Germany watchful**\n\nThe news comes in the wake of one of Germany's biggest data breaches, in which the\nprivate data of almost 1,000 public figures were leaked in January, including email\nconversations and private photos. Cybersecurity has become a matter of urgency for\nGerman politics after the United States has ramped up pressure on its allies to desist using\n[Chinese firm Huawei technology in the roll out of 5G internet.](https://www.dw.com/en/huawei-and-germany-5g-relationship-status-is-complicated/a-47964044)\n\nGermany’s Office for Security in Information Technology (BSI) recently issued a warning to\nseveral German companies seen as potential targets for Chinese cyber espionage. There\nare mounting fears in Germany that Chinese hackers could be targeting companies involved\nin construction and materials research, engineering firms and big commercial enterprises.\nAccording to a BSI report in February, [Germany has seen a rising number of incidents hitting](https://www.dw.com/en/german-intelligence-head-warns-of-cyber-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure/a-43774802)\ncritical infrastructure, such as power grids and water suppliers. Among the companies most\nrecently targeted by the Chinese hackers was the Hagen Hohenlimburg specialty steel mill in\nwestern Germany.\n\nTechnical trade secrets were stolen from the steel production and manufacturing plant design\ndivisions of ThyssenKrupp in the attacks. At the time, the company said it had been targeted\nby attackers located in Southeast Asia. In 2014, a blast furnace at a steelworks in Germany\nwas also badly damaged by a cyber attack, resulting in \"massive damage to machinery\" at\nthe unnamed German steel mill.\n\nThis followed an attack on Deutsche Telekom routers that caused outage for nearly 1 million\ncustomers.\n\n**Costs**\n\nAccording to a survey published by Germany's IT sector association Bitkom in 2018, two\nthirds of German manufacturers have already come under the attack of cybercriminals. The\nassociation estimates that this costs Europe's largest economy €43 billion ($50 billion)\nannually.\n\n_Read more:_ [German firms warned about Chinese 'cloud hopper' hackers](https://www.dw.com/en/german-firms-warned-about-chinese-cloud-hopper-hackers/a-46799908)\n\n\n-----\n\nBitkom has also found that small and medium-sized companies are particularly vulnerable to\nattacks. Some 19 percent of those polled said their IT and production systems had been\nsabotaged digitally, with 11 percent reporting tapping of their communications.\n\nWatch video 01:55\n\n## Data theft and cyber attacks\n\n**DW recommends**\n\n## Six hack attacks that shook the world\n\n[The data breach that affected lawmakers from across Germany's political spectrum was the](https://www.dw.com/en/six-hack-attacks-that-shook-the-world/a-46963742)\nlatest in a string of prominent cyberattacks around the world.
