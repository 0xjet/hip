As part of our comprehensive response plan, we\nimmediately took our systems offline globally to contain the threat and began working with a\nthird-party forensic firm to conduct an independent investigation.\n\nOur technical team is working closely with world class third-party experts to address this\nmatter, and bring our systems back online in a secure manner, as quickly as possible.\n\n\n-----\n\nFederal law enforcement authorities have also been informed and are involved in the\ninvestigation.\n\nAs always, protecting client and employee information is a critical priority for the company. At\nthis time there is no evidence of any unauthorized transfer or misuse or exfiltration of any\ndata in our possession.\"\n[Later that night, TechCrunch reported that they were told that the attack affected all of Epiq's](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/epiq-global-ransomware/)\n80 global offices and their computers.\n\n## Epiq Global's attack started with a TrickBot infection\n\nToday a source in the cybersecurity industry exclusively shared information with\nBleepingComputer that sheds light on how Epiq Global became infected.\n\nIn December 2019, a computer on Epiq's network became infected with the TrickBot\nmalware.\n\nTrickBot is most commonly installed by the Emotet Trojan, which is spread through phishing\nemails.\n\nOnce TrickBot is installed, it will harvest various data, including passwords, files, and\ncookies, from a compromised computer and will then try spread laterally throughout a\nnetwork to gather more data.\n\nWhen done harvesting data on a network, TrickBot will open a reverse shell to the Ryuk\noperators.\n\nThe Ryuk Actors will then have access to the infected computer and begin to perform\nreconnaissance of the network. After gaining administrator credentials, they will deploy the\nransomware on the network's devices using PowerShell Empire or PSExec.\n\nIn Epiq Global's case, Ryuk was deployed on their network on Saturday morning, February\n29th, 2020, when the ransomware began encrypting files on infected computers.\n\n**Ransom Note Created**\n\nWhen encrypting files, the ransomware will create a ransom note named RyukReadMe.html\nin every folder. All files that were encrypted would also have the .RYK extension appended to\nthem.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Epiq Global's Ryuk Ransom Note**\nWhile Ryuk is considered a secure ransomware without any weaknesses in its encryption,\nEmsisoft's Brett Callow has told BleepingComputer that there may be a slight chance they\ncan help recover files encrypted by the Ryuk ransomware.\n\n“Companies affected by Ryuk should contact us. There is a small - very small - chance that\nwe may be able to help them recover their data without needing to pay the ransom,” Callow\ntold BleepingComputer.com.\n\nWhile the chances are very small, if your devices are encrypted by the Ryuk Ransomware it\ndoes not hurt to check with Emsisoft.\n\nBleepingComputer has reached out to Epiq with further questions about this attack, but have\nnot heard back at this time.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[TrickBot cybercrime group linked to new Diavol ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-cybercrime-group-linked-to-new-diavol-ransomware/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
