Syria is no exception, with\n\nthe crisis there taking many forms, and the cyberspace\n\nconflict is intensifying as sides try to tilt the struggle in their\n\nfavor by exploiting cyber intelligence and using distortion.\n\nThe Global Research & Analysis Team (GReAT) at\n\nKaspersky Lab has discovered new malware attacks in\n\nSyria, using some techniques to hide and operate\n\nmalware, in addition to proficient social engineering tricks\n\nto deliver malware by tricking and tempting victims to open\n\nand launch malicious files. The malware files were found\n\non activist sites and social networking forums, some other\n\nfiles were also reported by local organizations like\n\n[CyberArabs and Technicians for Freedom.](https://www.cyber-arabs.com/)\n\nTh f ll t d t ili th tt k d l t d ti iti\n\n\n-----\n\n### A glance at what was discovered\n\nThe number of attacks and malicious files being\n\ndistributed is constantly increasing as the attackers\n\nbecome more organized and proficient. The samples are\n\nall based on Remote Administration Trojan Tools (RATs)\n\nThe number of malicious files found: 110\n\nThe number of domains linked to the attacks: 20\n\nThe number of IP addresses linked to the attacks: 47\n\n#### The National Security Program – what the malware attacks look like\n\nMasquerading as a reportedly “Government leaked\n\nprogram” that has the names of all wanted people in Syria,\n\nthe National Security Program conceals a full featured\n\nRAT client to steal all sorts of information under one of its\n\nbuttons.\n\nﺑﺭﻧﺎﻣﺞ ﺍﻷﻣﻥ ﺍﻟﻭﻁﻧﻲ.exe (The national security program)\n\n#### Using shockingly disturbing videos to distribute malware\n\nA disturbing video showing injured victims of recent\n\nbombings was used on YouTube to appeal to people’s fear\n\nand prompt them to download a malicious application\n\n\n-----\n\nto be heavily obfuscated with the commercial utility\n\n“MaxToCode” for .NET in order to avoid early detection by\n\nantivirus solutions.\n\n#### Did you install your “Ammazon” Security Suite?\n\nIf you thought the era of fake antiviruses was over, here\n\ncomes this newly developed Syrian sample to challenge\n\nyour beliefs. With the innocent title of “Ammazon Internet\n\nSecurity”, this malicious application tries to mimic a\n\nsecurity scanner, even including a quite thorough\n\ngraphical user interface and some interactive functionality.\n\n#### Your “Ammazon” is now secure, what about the rest of your network?\n\nTotal Network Monitor (which is a legitimate application) is\n\ninside another sample found, being used with embedded\n\nmalware for spying purposes. Offering security\n\napplications to protect against surveillance is one of the\n\nmany techniques used by malware writing groups to get\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Instant messaging, instant infection\n\nIt’s also the case with other samples, where social\n\nengineering does all the heavy work. Instant messaging\n\napplications for desktop operating systems have been\n\nused in the past to spread malware and it seems Syrian\n\nmalware authors have jumped on the bandwagon.\n\n#### Beware of Chemical Attacks\n\nAnother of the attacks using social engineering tricks, the\n\nsample named Kimawi.exe (Arabic for Chemicals) with a\n\nJPG icon, is a RAT file bound to the image Kimawi.jpg.\n\nThe picture is a previously leaked paper supposedly from\n\nthe regime in Syria warning military units to prepare for\n\nChemical Attacks. The file is being sent by email to\n\nselected victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### What is new?\n\nThe threat actors are becoming more organized, the\n\nnumber of attacks is increasing and the samples being\n\nused are becoming more sophisticated, while also relying\n\nextensively on powerful social engineering tricks that\n\nmany people fall for.\n\n#### Where are the victims and the attackers?\n\nThe victims infected when accessing the hacked forums\n\nand social networking sites tend to be ordinary users or\n\nactivistshey were, or specific targets if they receive the\n\nmalware via email, Skype, or messages on social\n\nnetworking sites.\n\nThe victims are also located outside Syria. We have seen\n\nvictims of Syrian­based malware in:\n\n1. Turkey\n\n2. Saudi Arabia\n\n3. Lebanon\n\n4. Palestine\n\n5. United Arab Emirates\n\n6. Israel\n\n\n-----\n\n9. United States\n\nThe attackers’ command and control centers were tracked\n\nto IP addresses in Syria, Russia, Lebanon, the US and\n\nBrazil.\n\n#### How many have fallen victim?\n\nWe believe the number of victims exceeds 10,000, with\n\nsome of the files being downloaded more than 2000 times.\n\nThe attackers’ malware samples and variations have\n\nincreased dramatically from only a few in Q1 2013 to\n\naround 40 in Q2 2014.\n\n#### What is the impact on victims?\n\n**Remote Administration Trojans tools are used to fully**\n\ncompromise the system on victim devices. RATs are\n\ncapable of stealing user credentials in addition to\n\nactivating camera and microphone functionalities…\n\n#### Are users protected?\n\nKaspersky detects and blocks all the samples that have\n\nbeen found. They are detected as follows:\n\nTrojan.MSIL.Zapchast\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Bifrose\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Fynloski\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Xtreme\n\nMore details and analysis of the attacks and malware\n\n[samples can be found in the full report here.](https://cdn.securelist.com/files/2014/08/KL_report_syrian_malware.pdf)\n\n#### Further reading\n\n[If you’d like to read more on the subject, CitizenLab and](https://citizenlab.org/)\n\n[EFF have published several other good analyses of](http://www.eff.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\nTargeting Syrian Activists\n\nA Call to Harm: New Malware Attacks Target the\n\nSyrian Opposition\n\nSyrian Activists Targeted with BlackShades Spy\n\nSoftware\n\nHow to Find and Protect Yourself Against the Pro­\n\nSyrian­Government Malware on Your Computer\n\nFake YouTube Site Targets Syrian Activists With\n\nMalware\n\nQuantum of Surveillance: Familiar Actors and Possible\n\nFalse Flags in Syrian Malware Campaigns\n\n### Related Posts\n\n\n###### PNG\n\n\n###### EMBEDDED – MALICIOUS PAYLOAD HIDDEN IN A\n\n\n##### THERE IS 1 COMMENT\n\n[If you would like to comment on this article you must first login](https://securelist.com/wp-login.php)\n\n\nmohandas mv\n\nPosted on September 29, 2014. 5:24 pm\n\nextreemly thankfull for the informations provided\n\n\n[Reply](https://securelist.com/blog/research/66051/the-syrian-malware-house-of-cards/?replytocom=143781#respond)\n\n\n-----",
