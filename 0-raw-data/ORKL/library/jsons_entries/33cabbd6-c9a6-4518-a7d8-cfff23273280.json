In our coordinated effort, we performed the first ever-private sponsored\ninterdiction against a sophisticated state sponsored advanced threat group. Our efforts detected\nand cleaned 43,000 separate installations of Axiom tools, including 180 of their top tier implants.\nThis report will expand upon the following key findings:\n\n  - A coordinated effort across the private sector can have quantifiable impact on state\nsponsored threat actors.\n\n  - The Axiom threat group is a well resourced, disciplined, and sophisticated subgroup of a\n\nlarger cyber espionage group that has been directing operations unfettered for over six\nyears.\n\n  - Novetta has moderate to high confidence that the organization-tasking Axiom is a part of\n\nChinese Intelligence Apparatus. This belief has been partially confirmed by a recent FBI\nflash released to Infragard stating the actors are affiliated with the Chinese government[1].\n\n  - Axiom actors have victimized pro-democracy non-governmental organizations (NGO)\n\nand other groups and individuals that would be perceived as a potential threat to the\nstability of the Chinese state.\n\n  - Axiom operators have been observed operating in organizations that are of strategic\n\neconomic interest, that influence environmental and energy policy, and that develop\ncutting edge information technology including integrated circuits, telecommunications\nequipment manufacturers, and infrastructure providers.\n\n  - Later stages of Axiom operations leverage command and control infrastructure that has\n\nbeen compromised solely for the targeting of individual or small clusters of related\ntargeted organizations.\n\n  - Axiom uses a varied toolset ranging from generic malware to very tailored, custom\n\nmalware designed for long-term persistence that at times can be measured in years. In\ndescending order of observed scarcity these families are:\n\n     - Zox family (ZoxPNG, ZoxRPC)/Gresim\n\n     - Hikit\n\n     - Derusbi\n\n     - Fexel/Deputy Dog\n\n     - Hydraq/9002/Naid/Roarur/Mdmbot\n\n     - ZXShell/Sensode\n\n     - PlugX/Sogu/Kaba/Korplug/DestroyRAT\n\n     - Gh0st/Moudour/Mydoor\n\n     - Poison Ivy/Darkmoon/Breut\n\n1 http://www.slideshare.net/ragebeast/infragard-hikitflash\n\n\n-----\n\n### Operation SMN Background\n\nOperation SMN[2] is a coordinated effort amongst leading private-industry security companies,\nled by Novetta. The initial focus of Operation SMN was to conduct the first industry-led\ninterdiction effort against a sophisticated advanced threat actor group. This collaboration\nrepresents an evolution of the status quo from simple reporting of identified threats to a new\nmethodology of coordinated interdiction. During this operation, the group performed malware\nremoval, released detection signatures, and issued public reporting on 10/14/2014[3] and\n10/28/2014 in order to mitigate the threat posed by the actor group. For the purposes of this\ndocument, the name “Axiom” will refer to this threat group.\n\nThis effort was initially focused on transferring the understanding generated by Novetta’s\nmalware decoder development to Microsoft, via their Coordinated Malware Eradication program,\nto create high fidelity signatures for the Hikit malware family. These co-developed signatures\nbetween Novetta and Microsoft were slated for inclusion in a Malicious Software Removal Tool\n(MSRT) release that would initially only target the Hikit malware family. Upon the initial few\niterations of information sharing and signature development between Microsoft and Novetta it\nbecame clear that by leveraging additional industry partners a much larger sample set could be\ncollected, analyzed, and acted upon. This fueled the selective expansion of the partnership into\na small group of capable organizations that could contribute directly to the CME campaign.\n\nThe expansion of operational scope brought with it discussions of not only targeting the Hikit\nfamily of malware, but also refocusing efforts to target the entire known set of associated tools\nand malware capabilities. It was at this junction that the group decided on a more\ncomprehensive course of action that would leverage the MSRT capabilities for detection and\nremoval, as well as distribute the corpus of samples, analysis, and knowledge to the entire\nindustry via Microsoft's Virus Information Alliance. The group saw that this was the most\neffective means to broadly distribute highly sensitive information to 64 trusted industry partners\nin 22 separate countries for their own use, and to protect their customers.\n\nThis chain of events enabled Operation SMN members to plan and execute a global disruption\nand degradation campaign, exposing a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor that has targeted\nand exploited individual victims and organizations worldwide. Novetta feels that the unified\napproach developed within Operation SMN, which united multiple perspectives and capabilities\nacross private industry, provides the highest level of visibility and establishes the foundation\nnecessary to effectively counter a threat of this nature. It is Novetta’s hope that others within\nindustry will embrace and adopt a similar approach in the future.\n\n2 http://www.novetta.com/blog/2014/10/cyber-security-coalition1/\n3 http://www.novetta.com/files/5614/1329/6232/novetta_cybersecurity_exec_summary-3.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Operational Impact\nOn Tuesday, October 14, 2014, Operation-SMN took its first public action as a Coordinated\nMalware Eradication campaign (CME-2014-03). This first action consisted of efforts intended to\nimpede the ability of this and other threat actors to leverage this suite of tools. To do so, the\ncoalition:\n\n  - Released detection and removal signatures for related malware both publicly and\n\nthrough our coalition partners into their customer bases.\n\n  - Provided detection guidance to trusted security partners, including those in the Microsoft\n\nVirus Information Alliance program, so that as many potentially affected victims as\npossible will have detection and protection against this threat.\n\n  - Released several stages of reporting designed to raise awareness and highlight the\n\ntools, techniques, and procedures leveraged by Axiom and some affiliated groups.\n\nThe breadth and scope of Axiom’s operations served as motivation and justification for the\napproach adopted by the coalition of large scale data capture, analysis, and distribution of both\ndata and analytical output to industry. In the intervening period, the coalition has received a\nsubstantial amount of information relating to the removal of these malware tools. To date, over\n43,000 separate installations of Axiom-related tools have been removed from machines\nprotected by Operation SMN partners, and 180 of those infections were examples of Hikit, the\nlate-stage persistence and data exfiltration tool that represents the height of an Axiom victim’s\noperational lifecycle.\n\nShown below are two graphs, generated with data from Microsoft’s MSRT telemetry, which\ngraph the installation footprint of the various malware samples that Axiom has been observed\nusing. Three clear clusters emerge, centered on what Novetta believes to be areas of\nresponsibility for Axiom. These graphs speak to the usage of a multi-stage corpus of malware\nwhich allows the operators to continually refine their targeting as they get closer and closer to\ntheir intended goals.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Axiom Targeting \n\nNovetta has observed that Axiom’s activity largely centers on using Hikit within victim networks\npost-compromise. The configuration files extracted from Hikit binaries used in Axiom’s\noperations give identifiable campaign comments that provide strong indications of the intended\ntargets.\n\nFrom our analysis, we believe that organizations infected with Hikit are significant to the goals\nbehind those tasking Axiom operations. Though many organizations may have been targeted\nand compromised with initial stages of implants, the occurrence of Hikit activity within an entity\nindicates that the organization responsible for Axiom tasking considers it of importance or,\nalternatively, that the target is relatively hardened and more specialized malware is needed.\nWithin these targets, Axiom has been observed as going out of its way to ensure continued\naccess regardless of changes to its’ target’s network topology or security controls. Axiom’s Hikit\noperators have been observed returning to compromised organizations on a scheduled basis,\nand even performing targeted lateral compromises based on the geographic locations of\nnetwork egress points as well as introduction of new security controls.\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong the industries we observed targeted or potentially infected by Hikit:\n\n  - Asian and Western government agencies responsible for:\n\n     - Government records and communications agencies\n\n     - Law enforcement\n\n     - Environmental policy\n\n     - Personnel management\n\n     - Space and aerospace exploration and research\n\n      - Government auditing and internal affairs\n\n  - Electronics and integrated circuit manufacturers\n\n  - Networking equipment manufacturers\n\n  - Internet based services companies\n\n  - Software vendors, especially in the APAC region\n\n  - Journalism and media organizations\n\n  - NGOs, specifically those which deal with human rights or environmental policy\n\n  - International Consulting and analysis firms\n\n  - Law firms with an international or heavy M&A financial footprint\n\n  - Telecommunications firms\n\n  - Manufacturing conglomerates\n\n  - Venture Capital firms\n\n  - Energy firms\n\n  - Meteorological Services Companies\n\n  - Cloud Computing companies\n\n  - Pharmaceutical companies\n\n  - Highly regarded US Academic Institutions\n\nThese industries cover an array of targeted organizations spanning multiple countries including\nthe United States, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and the European Union. Novetta has observed\npotential compromises from the following geographic areas:\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Targeting and China’s Strategic Goals\n\nAxiom’s actions targeting the above industries have fit in particularly well with China’s strategic\ninterests and with their most recent Five Year Plans accepted in 2006 and 2011. The 12th Five\nYear Plan displays China’s new direction of pursuing advanced technology and advanced R&D\nefforts. As China begins its shift away from dependence on foreign technology (specifically the\nUS), more and more corporations and organizations may be targeted by Axiom, and/or other\ngroups that receive the same or similar tasking, as the Chinese play catch-up. The following\nsections detail how Axiom’s Hikit operations line up with official policy.\n\n##### Semiconductor and Networking Technology\nAs part of the 12th Five Year Plan, semiconductor and network device manufacturing were two\nmain areas of focus for growth that China has emphasized to minimize foreign dependencies[4]\nand increase potential consumption of domestic internet services. Of the many ways the\nChinese could acquire this knowledge and technology to further their stated goals, the fastest\nwould be the theft of trade and technology secrets from Western corporations, especially those\n\n4 http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1324373\n\n\n-----\n\nwith offices in China[5]. We have strong indications based on Hikit analysis that these industries\nhave been targeted by Axiom operations.\n\n##### Human Intelligence\nInformation on individuals stored by Western and Asian government entities has also been\ntargeted by Axiom. Information held by these organizations includes details on individuals with\naccess to confidential or classified information, which would be extremely useful for intelligence\nand counterintelligence operations. Additionally, it should be noted that this sort of information\ncould also be used to enable or extend technical and human operations against target\norganizations and individuals. For example, this can be done through remote network based\nattacks, tailored spear phishing, targeted social media delivery, physical delivery and transfer of\ndata through non-technical means, and traditional human operations.\n\n##### Non-Governmental Organizations\nAxiom has demonstrated a clear interest in compromising NGOs that deal with international\npolitics, environmental policy, pro-democracy movements, or human rights issues. Novetta has\nobserved at least one operation where Axiom compromised a satellite office of one of these\norganizations and then appeared to have moved laterally into that organization’s main\nheadquarters. Much has been written of China’s dissatisfaction of their reputation on the world\nstage, in particular criticism for human rights abuses and environmental issues stemming from\nrapid industrialization; these criticisms are often viewed as a blow to the authority of the ruling\nparty and to the “soft power” of their nation state, which China has been keen on developing in\nrecent years. Monitoring these kinds of organizations could allow the Chinese government to\ntrack these watchdog organizations and potentially accomplish more traditional goals such as\nthe suppression of dissidents or intimidation of whistleblowers.\n\n5 http://www.npr.org/2013/05/07/181668369/u-s-turns-up-heat-on-costly-commercial-cyber-theft-in-china\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Previous Public Reporting \n\nIn addition to the malware binaries that Novetta has analyzed and attributed to Axiom, we have\nfound similarities in several high-profile cyber attacks since 2009. The following timeline details\nsome of the attacks that we know exhibit similar TTPs or leverage overlapping tools and\ninfrastructure with those we have attributed to Axiom.\n\n  - June - December 2009: Operation Aurora (Hydraq)\n\n  - December 2009: Elderwood Project leveraging 0days[6] (Hydraq)\n\n  - March, April June 2011: Elderwood Platform Attacks\n\n  - April, May, August 2012: Elderwood Platform Attacks\n\n  - June - July 2012: VOHO Campaign wateringhole attacks[7] (Gh0st RAT, Hydraq)\n\n  - July 2012 - January 2013: Bit9 Compromise[8],[9] (Hikit)\n\n  - June 2013: Shell_Crew Compromise of ColdFusion Server[10] (Derusbi)\n\n  - September 2013: Operation Deputy Dog Attack on Japanese Targets[11]\n\n  - November 2013: Operation Ephemeral Hydra involving Internet Explorer Zero-day\n\n(DeputyDog)[12]\n\n  - January 2014: 3 new 0-Day exploits leveraged by Elderwood Platform[13]\n\n  - February 2014: Operation Snowman attack on the US Veterans of Foreign Wars website\n\n(DeputyDog)[14]\n\n  - June - July 2014: American Middle Eastern Policy think tank attacks[15]\n\nAs part of Operation Aurora, Google[16], Adobe[17], Rackspace and 32 other companies were\ncompromised in similar fashion by attackers with connections to China, who we believe exhibit\n\n6 http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/theelderwood-project.pdf\n7 https://blogs.rsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/VOHO_WP_FINAL_READY-FOR-Publication09242012_AC.pdf\n8\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/hidden_lynx.pdf\n9 https://blog.bit9.com/2013/02/25/bit9-security-incident-update/\n10 http://www.emc.com/collateral/white-papers/h12756-wp-shell-crew.pdf\n11http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2013/09/operation-deputydog-zero-day-cve-20133893-attack-against-japanese-targets.html\n12http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2013/11/operation-ephemeral-hydra-ie-zero-daylinked-to-deputydog-uses-diskless-method.html\n13 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/how-elderwood-platform-fueling-2014-s-zero-day-attacks\n14http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2014/02/operation-snowman-deputydog-actorcompromises-us-veterans-of-foreign-wars-website.html\n15 http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/07/07/chinese-cyberspies-have-hackedmiddle-east-experts-at-major-u-s-think-tanks/\n16 http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n\n\n-----\n\nsome of Axiom’s characteristics[18]. Microsoft also reported being subject to similar style attacks,\nthough those attempts were unsuccessful[19]. In April 2013, Microsofts’ David Aucsmith[20]\nsuggested that the Aurora campaign that targeted Google may have been part of a larger\nChinese counterintelligence operation aimed at gaining insights to Chinese Gmail accounts\nwhich were under FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) surveillance. Later, in May 2013,\nthe Washington Post[21] would report that according to current and former government officials,\nthe Chinese had successfully accessed Google’s database of flagged email accounts that were\nplaced under 702 foreign surveillance by U.S. Law Enforcement and counterintelligence. It is\nunclear whether these exploitation operations can be directly linked to Axiom, however we have\nseen direct evidence that Axiom is highly interested in targeting organizations with data that\nmay aid human intelligence or counterintelligence operations.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, the VOHO Campaign was discovered by private industry to be\nleveraging watering-hole attacks and several exploits to download and install variants of Gh0st\nRAT and Hydraq. The VOHO attacks occurred in two phases, each phase using a different\nzero-day vulnerability, over multiple weeks during July 2012. According to RSA’s reporting on\nthis campaign, nearly 1,000 organizations across multiple industries were impacted during the\nfirst phase, resulting in roughly 4,200 individual machines being compromised. During this multi\nphased attack campaign security firm Bit9 was targeted and Axiom operators gained access to\na Bit9 digital certificate. Which they then used to sign custom variants of the Hikit malware in an\neffort to bypass the additional security provided by their product at specific organizations within\nthe VOHO target set.\n\nThe ability to target, compromise, and filter tens of thousands of individual infections across\nnearly 1000 organizations, in order to identify victims to further other active attacks indicates a\nlevel of technical, organizational, and operational sophistication not typically seen. The\ntechniques used and malware delivered in the VOHO Campaign have been tied to Axiom, and\nthe use of digital certificates to deliver malware is also a well-known technique for Axiom.\n\nWatering-hole attacks that include 0-day exploits require planning and sophistication, as the\nattackers need to identify sites frequented by their targets, compromise those third party\nwebsite(s), have available 0-day exploits, and then ultimately compromise the visiting targets’\nsystems. Coupling a watering hole attack with a supply chain attack requires even more\nplanning. The fact that the VOHO watering hole attack, the Bit9 compromise, and the delivery of\nthe custom Hikit malware all occurred within a one week period suggests a highly organized\n\n17 http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2010/01/adobe_investigates_corporate_n.html\n18 http://www.wired.com/2010/01/operation-aurora/\n19 http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-and-breaches/google-aurora-hack-was-chinesecounterespionage-operation/d/d-id/1110060?\n20http://www.cio.com/article/2386547/government/-aurora--cyber-attackers-were-really-running-counterintelligence.html\n21http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-who-breached-google-gainedaccess-to-sensitive-data-us-officials-say/2013/05/20/51330428-be34-11e2-89c93be8095fe767_story.html\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup able to carry out simultaneous and independent objectives against larger goals, possibly\nunder the direction and supervision of a larger organization.\n\nAnother series of attacks named the Elderwood Project[22] began in late 2009 and used a notably\nlarge number of zero-day vulnerabilities to deliver malware (Hydraq) onto targeted networks.\nThe attackers delivered these exploits using a variety of methods including a watering hole\nattack targeting the Amnesty International Hong Kong website, which may provide insight into at\nleast some of the victims targeted. The threat actors behind these attacks had access to\nmultiple critical zero-day vulnerabilities, suggesting the group had resources to develop them or\nto acquire them from other. It should also be noted that the stated techniques of the actors\nbehind Elderwood include targeting of supply-chain organizations of their intended targets.\n\nAmerican think tanks focusing on Iraq have also been targets of watering-hole attacks[23] that\nutilize malware also occasionally used by the Axiom group: Derusbi. The attack was specifically\nlooking for users with identified Chinese, US English, Russian, Japanese, or Korean language\nmachines[24]. Although previous Chinese cyber attacks targeting think tanks have concentrated\non those involved in East Asian policy, this shift may be reflective of China’s renewed interest in\nthe Middle East due to their dependence on oil production from this region[25]. Although this is not\nas strong a link to the Axiom threat group, the fact that Derusbi was used is notable, as this\nmalware is not widely distributed beyond intermediate stages of operations that have been\nattributed to Axiom.\n\nWhen comparing the last three campaigns that have discussed(VOHO, Elderwood Project, and\nIraq-focused think-tanks), beyond the toolset:\n\n  - They all used waterholing as their primary initial infection vector\n\n  - They all required the ability to sift potentially large sets of infected machines to identify\n\ntargets of high interest for further exploitation.\n\n  - They all targeted (at least in part) non-profit organizations that deal with information\n\nrelated to Chinese policy or Chinese stated interests.\n\nThe fact that the primary beneficiary of information stolen in these campaigns is not military or\ndirectly financial, but rather intelligence benefiting Chinese domestic and international policies,\nis highly telling and implies the Chinese Intelligence Apparatus could be behind such attacks.\n\n22 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/elderwood-project\n23 http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/07/07/chinese-cyberspies-have-hackedmiddle-east-experts-at-major-u-s-think-tanks/\n24 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/internet-explorer-zero-day-used-watering-hole-attack-qa\n25 http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-17/iraq-crisis-could-threaten-chinese-oil-investments\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Domestic Targeting \n\nIn addition to international organizations of strategic interest, it also appears that Axiom has\nused Hikit internally to gather information on domestic Chinese targets. Cyber operations within\nChina’s own borders may be reflective of the Communist Party’s emphasis on maintaining\ninternal state security to ensure domestic stability, as the past three decades of rapid economic\nchange have brought about a significant wage gap, unemployment issues, environmental\nissues, and other societal issues, in addition to long-standing issues such as disparate ethnic\ngroups and territorial disputes. The CPC has subsequently dedicated significant resources\ntoward domestic security: although domestic security spending for 2014 was not revealed by\nofficial sources, in the three years prior it has consistently exceeded the military budget[26].\nAmong the well-funded entities tasked with domestic security are the Ministry of Public Security\nand the Ministry of State Security. In particular, the latter organization is the primary non-military\nsecurity agency of China and is tasked with not only domestic surveillance, but also foreign\nintelligence and counterintelligence.\n\nMuch of previous public reporting on Chinese threat groups has concentrated on the cyber\ncapabilities and information warfare of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). In particular, the\nThird Department serves as the PLA’s telecommunications reconnaissance bureau charged\nwith SIGINT for foreign intelligence operations[27]. The Third Department is divided into twelve\nbureaus, each ostensibly having a dedicated mission. For instance, the 2nd Bureau, or Unit\n61398, has been directly linked by security researchers to attacks primarily focused on Englishlanguage organizations of strategic importance to China[28]. While this group has been\nresponsible for a significant number of cyber attacks, the group’s profiled operational security\nand tactics do not appear to be as sophisticated as those attributed to Axiom. In fact,\nresearchers were able to directly link individuals to this bureau due to activity on social media as\nwell as identifiable indicators used to register campaign command and control (C2)\ninfrastructure, including domains or emails. Other individuals linked to Unit 61398 cyber\noperations have also been profiled by the FBI in an indictment of five Chinese military\nintelligence officers[29]. In contrast, there have been no identified mistakes in operational security\non the part of Axiom operators to date.\n\nOther attacks targeting satellite/aerospace industries have been linked to the Third\nDepartment’s 12th Bureau, Unit 61486[30]. Again, at least one individual has been connected to\nthis activity using open-source intelligence due to a presence on social media and clues found\nin campaign infrastructure information, suggesting a lax operational security when compared to\n\n26 http://www.trust.org/item/20140305043104-x0f0c/0\n27 http://project2049.net/documents/countering_chinese_cyber_operations_stokes_hsiao.pdf\n28 http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf\n29 http://www.fbi.gov/pittsburgh/press-releases/2014/u.s.-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-withcyber-espionage-against-u.s.-corporations-and-a-labor-organization-for-commercial-advantage\n30 http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hat-tribution-pla-unit-61486/index.html\n\n\n-----\n\nwhat has been observed with Axiom. Furthermore, attack activity from Unit 61486 has been\nlinked to Unit 61398 based on shared infrastructure. This might suggest some degree of\ncooperation or overlap between these teams and missions in the Third Department that we\nhave not yet observed between previously identified Chinese threat groups and Axiom, beyond\nthe usage of commonly available malware. However, we cannot discount the possibility that\npreviously reported Chinese threat groups could be linked to Axiom, or that both could be part of\na larger organization.\n\nWhile it appears that the identified missions of most if not all units of the Third Department\nremain focused on foreign intelligence and defensive network security, there are some\nindications that a few PLA bureaus do engage in unconfirmed domestic monitoring to some\ndegree, including monitoring of domestic broadcasts. Nevertheless, based on observed TTPs of\nidentified PLA threat groups compared to Axiom activity, we believe that Axiom operates based\non a different mission and has resources that previously reported and identified PLA cyber\noperators do not have.\n\nWhen examining Axiom’s possible domestic attack activity, we have identified several instances\nof Hikit present on machines located in China or Hong Kong, dating at least as far back as\nJanuary 2012. This would indicate domestic monitoring in addition to foreign operations, and\nmay suggest that the group to which Axiom belongs is an entity charged with domestic security.\n\nAdditional telemetry we have observed suggests that Axiom may also target Chinese citizens,\npossibly dissidents, in foreign countries (including the United States and Asia-Pacific countries),\nbased on the presence of Hikit on machines configured to use simplified Chinese. In particular,\nat least one Hikit sample was observed targeting a Chinese-language machine located in the\nUnited States; the filename “LiulanqiXunzhang.exe.tdl” appears to reference a browser (浏览器).\n\nCertain indicators from Hikit binaries detected on machines in China or Hong Kong also provide\nfurther insight how these domestic victims are targeted by Axiom. The filenames of the malware,\nfor instance, show that they were likely curated for Chinese speakers, as seen with Chineselanguage file names including at least one referring to QQ, the popular messaging application.\nOther more generically popular applications like Adobe Flash Player were also used as potential\nlures or means of hiding in plain site. Novetta has also observed that Chinese-related filenames\nof commodity malware that has been used by both Axiom as well as other threat groups (e.g.,\nPoison Ivy, PlugX, etc.) may also reflect a lively underground trade; some of the filenames we\nhave observed are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\nTable: Filenames of some malware binaries present on machines located in China\n\nOriginal Filename Translation Malware Family\n\nQQ6.3_6.3.12382.exe.P2P Hikit\n\nbaofeng.exe.td Hikit\n\nCODOL_Formal_1.2.2.10_1.

Though this cannot be linked conclusively to Axiom Hikit operators, education\ninstitutions, particularly those in Hong Kong, would likely be of extreme importance for any\nmonitoring of domestic activity -- not only is China worried about liberal academics, but also\nstudents, who have historically been leaders in pro-democracy movements as recently as this\npast summer with the Occupy Central protests in Hong Kong.\n\n### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures of Axiom\n\nA wide range of mechanisms are used to reach the stage of an operation where Hikit is\ndeployed. Observed methods include the traditional use of spear phishing, leveraging of generic\nand strategic website compromises, and targeted attacks against public facing infrastructure.\nOne of the many disturbing attributes of Axiom and their affiliated groups is their ability to create\nand leverage large pools of compromised machines, sift through them to identify the\norganizations of interest, and quickly (within hours or days) begin secondary follow-up\nexploitation operations. This rapid transition from identification to action on the objective\ndemonstrates the level of sophistication and focus of these actors; it also suggests an integrated\ntargeting element, with possible inputs from an authoritative tasking entity, which is responsible\nfor issuing dynamic taskings. This modus operandi does not suggest that Axiom relies solely\nupon casting a large net for victimization, rather that the Axiom actors have a well-established\ntradition and capabilities that support focused targeting of both individuals and organizations.\n\nOnce inside an enterprise, Axiom begins reconnaissance almost immediately to establish where\nthey are in the target’s network, and to identify any changes that have been made to the\nenvironment. Once this initial reconnaissance stage has been completed and the information is\ncollected, Axiom typically moves quickly to escalate privileges on compromised machines via\npreviously compromised administrative accounts, local exploits, or remote exploits as\ndemonstrated in the ZoxRPC malware. This escalation of privileges is typically in an attempt to\ndump the latest credentials they can gain access to on the victim network. This information is\nquickly accessed, compressed, encrypted, and exfiltrated by the actors. The turnaround for the\nuse of this information after collection can vary from minutes to months.\n\nThe Axiom threat actor group has also demonstrated the operational flexibility of leveraging\nsystems administration tools available within targeted organizations (e.g., Remote Desktop\nProtocol (RDP), remote administration tools). It has been observed several times that Axiom\noperators have even leveraged these capabilities as a means of maintaining additional\npersistence via setting “sticky keys” for RDP sessions. They also use custom tools containing\nnetwork and local exploits, hacking utilities, and legitimate security tools for privilege escalation\nand lateral movement. By leveraging tools already available within a target organization Axiom,\ncan forgo the need to potentially raise their profile by deploying additional malware that may\ntrigger antivirus or IDS indicators. As a typical scenario when compromising an organization,\nthis actor group will aim to orient themselves, move laterally, escalate privileges, dump\n\n\n-----\n\ncredentials, and install other families of malware to hedge against detection of any one variant\nof their malware.\n\nIt has been observed in many of Axiom’s victim environments that the total number of malware\nfamilies leveraged can exceed four separate “layers” of malware. These families of malware\nrange in uniqueness from extremely common (Poison Ivy, Gh0st, ZXshell) to more focused\ntools used by Axiom and other threat groups directed by the same organization (Derusbi, Fexel)\nto tools only seen used by Axiom (ZoxPNG/ZoxRPC, Hikit). This is likely done to ensure a\ncertain level of persistence and redundant command and control should one of the families ever\nbecome compromised. Additionally, once into later stages of their operations, Axiom operators\nwill create and deploy shell utilities that are customized to the operational environment.\nOperators will also install data archival and compression tooling that may not already exist on\nthe target machine. The flexibility and fluency of Axiom’s toolset, including the ability to produce\ncustom tools, is yet another indicator of the technical and operational sophistication of this\nentity.\n\nIn support of this flexible tooling capability, Axiom has demonstrated a relatively sophisticated\nuse of large amounts of legitimate and compromised internet infrastructure. Axiom has been\nobserved grooming and leveraging an array of compromised proxy infrastructure within the\nUnited States, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan. Novetta has observed indications\nin various datasets that this compromised infrastructure can be created per campaign or target,\nor can be shared within a cluster of related targets. It is surmised that this method is a means to\ncreate confusion for any investigation into activity related to an Axiom intrusion, by leveraging\nthe capabilities of Axiom tools and interweaving legitimate traffic to the same IP address during\nthe compromise. The net effect of this tactic is to create a set of network traffic that at first\nglance appears to be legitimate traffic.\n\nBeyond this generally stealthy technique for hiding malicious traffic, the ability to have access to\na continual pool of compromised infrastructure in which to overlay their operations speaks to the\nability of Axiom actors. They do not just comprise various Internet facing platforms, but also\nhave the organizational ability to deal with the capture, grooming, and maintenance of a large\nset of compromised infrastructure while in parallel executing technical operations and creating\nnew targeting information for pursuit. On top of Axiom’s usage of compromised infrastructure\nthey also maintain supporting infrastructure accounts, such as dynamic DNS services, and\nVPS/hosting providers from a variety of United States and Chinese providers. This ability to\nleverage both compromised and legitimate infrastructure enables Axiom to adjust to a target’s\nsecurity posture and potentially extend their access to a targeted organization.\n\n#### Victim Life Cycle\n\nBased on observed victim environments infiltrated by Axiom, Novetta believes that there are at\nleast six separate tiers of responsibilities that service different stages of the victim lifecycle.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Axiom, for its part, largely conducts operations in later stages of the overall victim**\n**compromise. Currently, we believe that the victim lifecycle is split into the following stages:**\n\n  - Stage 0: Target identification and reconnaissance\n\n  - Stage 1: Initial access, validation and internal target reconnaissance\n\n  - Stage 2: Lateral movement, and creation of additional footholds\n\n  - Stage 3: Compromised infrastructure creation and grooming\n\n  - Stage 4: Stealthy identification and exfiltration of targeted data\n\n  - Stage 5: Maintain access and understanding of environment\n\nThe level of sophistication seen by this multistage life cycle implies a number of things about the\nadversary’s ability to command resources and coordinate within itself. It is this structure and\ncoordination that truly sets Axiom and its associated groups apart from other actors in this\nspace.\n\n#### Structure of Adversary\n\n**We also assess that different groups associated with the Axiom threat actor group likely**\n**perform various phases. This deduction is supported by the number of differences in the**\nobserved activity during these compromise stages which suggest a number of separate teams\nwith varying responsibilities during their operation lifecycle. For instance, examinations of\ndifferences in command and control (C2) and midpoint proxy infrastructure displayed by the\nStage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 4 binaries have led us to believe that the operational tempo,\nsecurity policies, and acceptable risk levels are drastically different. This coordination of\ndifferent operators, infrastructure, and tools between stages in the same environment suggests\na common operating picture within a large organization.\n\nIt cannot be overstated that the operational timelines observed imply that Axiom and other stage\noperators operate with a cohesive long-term strategic goal. The ability of any organization to\nconsider strategic objectives over a multi year period implies that organization both believes that\ntheir operations will have far reaching effects, and that the organization itself will exist for an\nextended time. Extended operations require meaningful resources, both in terms of financial\ncapital (salaries), as well as physical resources (money for VPS’s and traditional server\ninfrastructure), as well as a logistic overhead for coordinating, planning, and researching attack\nvectors, creation/purchasing and distribution of 0-day exploit code and associated exploit\nframeworks[34], and campaign coordination between subgroups.\n\nFinally, threat actors at all the described stages, including Axiom, display a clear level of\ndiscipline in using their compromised resources. There is no meaningful level of information\nleakage due to resource access, or due to visiting personal websites with these resources.\nWhile this level of discipline has been observed outside of governmental organizations and\n\n34 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/how-elderwood-platform-fueling-2014-s-zero-day-attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nfunded operations, it displays a level of familiarity with investigative and forensics operations\nthat clearly sets them apart from the less sophisticated threat actors.\n\n##### Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure\nThe infrastructure practices of these linked groups often change depending on the current stage\nof operation as well as the intended target, ultimately culminating in Axiom operations. A good\nexample would be the watering hole attacks observed targeting Japanese entities in 2013[35].\nBecause broad-spectrum watering hole attacks are widely noticed and reported on, Stage 1\noperators appear to have heavily segregated their infrastructure from the infrastructure used\nduring later stages of operation in order to better evade detection.\n\nOperation SMN partners have a great deal of insight into the network characteristics and C2 of\nthe Stage 2 tools and techniques (i.e., Derusbi, HyDraq, DeputyDog) which serve as secondary\npersistence and lateral movement tools. Here, unlike Stage 1, the tools frequently reuse\ninfrastructure and other resources, and there is even some historical overlap between second\nlevel domains used by the Stage 2 actors and the Stage 4 operators (Axiom). iSIGHT Partners’\nreporting has discussed the usage of domains in watering hole attacks that have been used to\ngain initial access to target networks for later stage persistence. Passive DNS analysis has\ndemonstrated that the linkages between Stage 2 and Stage 4 C2 domains are indirect, but\npresent, establishing a possible link between the stages. Unlike other threat actors, operators of\nall stages, particularly from Stage 3 onwards, take operational practices and security seriously.\nThere was no observed activity outside of campaign activity on the identified operational\ninfrastructure across 76 unique Stage 4 campaigns.\n\nFor Stage 3 and 4 operations, Axiom is believed to have established a complex C2\ninfrastructure, which, based on campaign identifiers extracted from configuration files embedded\nin Hikit binaries, has been used to manage at least 76 unique campaigns that this operation has\ndiscovered. Operation SMN partners believe that many more organizations have been affected\nby Axiom, but are currently unaware of any compromise due to Axiom’s hyper targeting and\nstealth at this stage of activities. We hope that by highlighting some of Axiom’s techniques,\ntactics, and procedures we will increase the visibility of this group for awareness and detection.\n\nThe curated infrastructure that appears to be used strongly suggests that the Axiom actors are\ngiven the capacity and mandate to target and develop long-term strategic assets. Within\nobserved compromises, Axiom actors have been seen performing complex actions with their C2\ninfrastructure during the Stage 4 operational cycle. Configuration files extracted from Hikit\nbinaries indicate that C2 callback locations are tailored to the specific country and network\nenvironment in which the target resides. C2 domains will consistently be named and hosted in\nsuch a way that traffic appears legitimate, likely in an effort to fool network security operators of\ntarget organizations. Axiom and its linked groups have been known to conduct extensive\nresearch prior to compromising a target in order to determine ideal hosting locations. To achieve\n\n35 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2013/09/operation-deputydog-zero-day-cve-20133893-attack-against-japanese-targets.html\n\n\n-----\n\nthis, these threat actors often compromise secondary targets in order to obscure their C2\ninfrastructure and data exfiltration endpoints from their intended victims.\n\nAdditionally, past attacks have displayed that these linked groups are capable and willing to\nconstruct supply-chain attacks to allow them access to hardened targets. These supply-chain\nattacks will extend to elements of the target’s security supply chain. The observed tempo in\nthese supply-chain attacks suggest that Axiom operators are capable of coordinating rapid\nresponses to roadblocks in their goals, even when those roadblocks represen sophisticated\nsecurity organizations, such as Bit9.\n\n##### Hikit Command and Control (C2) Configuration\nAxiom’s rather distinct network operations and TTPs for setting up C2 infrastructure separate\nthem from other threat actors. In particular, Axiom’s midpoint centric C2 infrastructure has\nresulted in unique fingerprints. Each Hikit binary is configured for a specific target, often\nincluded in or referenced within the campaign indicator field of the respective configuration file.\nHikit operators (Axiom) appear to use a significant amount of C2 infrastructure isolation between\ntargets, with different targets rarely sharing identical C2 locations. This isolation provides a high\ndegree of resiliency and operational security in the event that one operation becomes\ncompromised, other operations are less likely to be interrupted or affected.\n\nIt is important to note that prior to Hikit Generation 2, we have no direct evidence of any C2\ninfrastructure due to the nature of Hikit Generation 1’s functioning. During the transition between\nthe Generation 1 and Generation 2 codebases, Hikit development teams made the decision to\ninclude an embedded configuration file in the binary itself. The first evidence of Hikit samples\ncontaining this configuration information, with embedded C2 information, appears to have been\ninitiated on April 12, 2012.\n\nDuring this time, two stages of Hikit binary creation were observed. During their initial stage of\nwork (those binaries with compile dates prior to April 2012), Axiom appeared to use both\ntraditional DNS hosting services and dynamic DNS services equally. While Axiom did not\nappear to have any obvious criteria for deciding which DNS provider would be used during this\nperiod, a preference for using DNSPOD (a Chinese-based DNS provider) and DtDNS (a USbased dynamic DNS service) was clear. The reasons for the selection of DtDNS are unknown at\nthis time but, the selection of DNSPOD can be assumed to be due to the geographic location of\nthe provider itself. The use of Dynamic DNS services is interesting, due to the confounding\neffect that it generally has on investigations. After 2012, however, we have observed a general\navoidance of dynamic DNS services.\n\nNaming conventions of these Hikit domains is also notable due to the pattern that defines them.\nUnder almost all conditions, the domains are expressed as a 3LD format, where the youngest\nchild domain represents the intended campaign target. As an example, the domain format for\nAcmeInc would be ‘acmeinc.basedomain.tld’. This naming convention, as well as the usage of\nDNS providers, is exclusive to Stage 4 infrastructure. In fact, for all Stage 3 cases, no second\nlevel domain is directly used. Instead, whenever malicious activity is observed, it can only be\n\n\n-----\n\nstrongly correlated to the child domain (of the DNSPOD domains), while the second level\ndomain remains relatively static and ‘clean’ in Asian geographic locations.\n\nHistorical examination of the base second level domains base, however, suggests that the\nsecond level domains were once used to launch attacks, similar to those domains seen in Stage\n2 operations. As this activity was last observed in 2010, it is theorized that current operational\nstrategies were then developed and adhered to.\n\nAs noted above, most of the observed Hikit (Stage 4) campaigns rely on DNS services for C2\nlocation and coordination. While the A records for the child domains of the mothership (second\nlevel domain) DNS names are typically located on compromised infrastructure as previously\ndiscussed, there are a few identifying characteristics which have been noted. Firstly, these\ndomains have extremely short times of existence within the US. Secondly, they display “long\ndistance relationship” behavior, wherein they have NS records in countries outside the location\nof the child domain. Heuristic detection for candidate C2 domains involves looking for domains\nthat have had RDATA that exhibits travel between geographically disperse countries, and\ncorrelating that towards displayed naming and linguistic characteristics of the domain names.\nHikit binaries have also been observed as members of complex internal routing structures for\nthe purposes of stealthy data exfiltration as well as access and persistence to internal\nresources. This activity is rarely caught in practice, as many security teams neglect to perform\nflow analysis on internal-to-internal network traffic.\n\nAt all points during Axiom Stage 4 infections, evidence suggests that there are humans directly\norchestrating operations. Stage 1 and Stage 2 operations may have varying levels of human\ninvolvement. As a result, exhaustive lists of domain names and IP’s used in C2 operations are\nsomewhat useless; blacklisting will be ineffective and present a large amount of ‘collateral\ndamage’ due to the use of compromised infrastructure. Interestingly, despite the general\nusefulness of large scale passive DNS analysis in most threat research, there are indications\nthat many of the ‘hits’ for Axiom C2 domains in this research exist because of independent\nsecurity researchers or IT security teams conducting investigations. This activity, while reliable\nfor observing network C2 behavior, does make ‘operational end dates’ difficult to determine for\nStage 3 and 4 campaigns.\n\n### Remediation\n\nCurrently, organizations that wish to protect themselves from the malware that Axiom has been\nobserved using should download and utilize the latest MSRT release. This tool has been\nverified to provide protection against malware families that Axiom favors, and is freely available\nto all Microsoft installations. It is suggested that enterprise organizations push out and execute\nMSRT on a monthly basis. Additionally, all members of the Operation SMN group have up-todate signatures and heuristics for detecting the Axiom malware families, as well as any vendors\ninvolved in Microsoft’s VIA program.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is strongly advised that organizations seeking protection from Axiom avoid the temptation of\nsolely deploying network based signatures. Because Axiom continually creates new C2\ninfrastructure for each new target and can quickly transition to new malware tooling, it is very\nunlikely that existing network IOCs will offer any meaningful level of protection for organizations\nwhose infections are new or previously undiscovered.\n\nNetwork operators can and should learn from the Axiom group’s tradecraft; security teams and\nIT staff should be especially wary of any traffic going to destination servers that does not match\nthe apparent intent of these servers. For example, large data transfers moving towards DNS\nnameservers on port 53 with no observable DNS content that are associated with known or\nrelated partners should be viewed as suspect. Hikit’s usage of internally routed proxy nodes can\ncomplicate this task, and only advanced network analytics that includes a holistic view of\ninternal and external network traffic can provide anything near 100% certainty. Network\nboundaries of all types should be monitored. If an internal network can route from restricted\nzones to ones of lower restriction, it should be monitored for data exfiltration in the same\nmanner as a traditional border network. Above all there is absolutely no substitute for continued\nvigilance -- by the time Hikit is installed on a victim’s infrastructure, the operation is in its final\nstages, and the attackers generally have free reign over the victim network.\n\nEnterprises are advised that while Axiom represents an advanced attacker, their power comes\nfrom their discipline and logistics. Ultimately, the removal of common “low hanging fruit” in\nnetwork and endpoint security will go far to prevent Axiom from easily accessing networks.\nAdditional suggestions for protection against Axiom’s attacks would be:\n\n  - Block or sinkhole the DNSPOD name servers. DNSPOD seems to be the preferred\n\nprovider for DNS services for Axiom, and many organizations can block these resources\nwithout adverse effect on business needs.\n\n  - Install and execute Microsoft’s EMET on endpoint machines, and configure it to your\n\nenvironment.\n\n  - Globally edit Windows policies to disable the “Sticky Keys” functionality.\n\n  - Restrict all remote access (RDP, SSH, Citrix, VPN, etc.) and ensure that this access is\n\nonly given to people that need it versus by default for the whole company; wherever\npossible, implement two-factor authentication for any remote access.\n\n  - Keep strong monitoring on VPN endpoints -- Axiom has demonstrated the ability to enter\n\nnetworks after compromising VPN client user credentials.\n\n  - Two-factor protection to webmail services should be added where possible.\n\n  - Ensure that local administrative accounts are not universal across your network, as a\n\nsingle compromise can bring the security of the entire network into question. Ensure that\nlocal firewalls are configured and restrict access to both servers and workstations to only\nthose subnets and users that require it.\n\n  - Implement application whitelisting to prevent execution of unauthorized executables -\nMicrosoft AppLocker, Bit9, and other third party solutions are all improvements over\ndefault installations without whitelisting.\n\n  - Encrypt e-mail where possible, even between internal users.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Ensure antivirus software is reporting to a central, monitored location. Axiom’s binaries\n\ncan flag AntiVirus rules that end up ignored, a security failing that they rely on.\n\n  - Ensure proper auditing and review of security firewall rules, antivirus updates, IDS\n\nsignatures, and other security controls. Axiom actors during active compromises have\nbeen observed to disable key signatures or rules to force victim organizations to lose\nvisibility.\n\n  - Apply security patches in a timely manner. While Axiom does make use of 0-day\n\nvulnerabilities, the group has also used disclosed, patched vulnerabilities that are found\non outdated systems in a target’s network.\n\n  - Reference information provided by the FBI in their FLASH report - additional remediation\n\ninformation and suggestions are included[36].\n\n36 http://www.slideshare.net/ragebeast/infragard-hikitflash\n\n\n-----\n\n### Kudos\n\nOperation SMN and the subsequent actions taken by the group members could not have\noccurred without the generosity and talent of several organizations. While the publicly\nacknowledged members of the group made critical contributions there are other firms that were\ncritical to the findings contained in this report. Their datasets, services, and software allowed\ncoalition members to construct a substantially stronger case than would have been otherwise\npossible. Farsight Security generously provided Novetta with unrestricted access to their\nhistorical passive DNS dataset, allowing analysts to investigate the C2 infrastructure used by\nAxiom over a wide window of time. Endgame provided Novetta with extensive proprietary threat\ndata and analytical processing capabilities allowing Novetta to gain a deeper insight into\ncompromised network footprints. Novetta would also like to thank those organizations and\nindividuals who quietly contributed to the content covered in this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A: Malware Key Findings \n\nIn the case of Axiom, the actors will utilize an array of capabilities, some more unique than\nothers, for various phases of their exploitation operations.

Novetta is working with both partners to insure that the signatures\nthey have provide the best coverage possible.\n\n### Appendix D: Malware Names Index\n\n**Operation SMN Name** Other Industry Names\n\nHydraq McRat, HydraQ/HidraQ, Naid, Homux,\nHomeUnix, MdmBot, Roarur\n\nGh0st Moudoor, Mydoor\n\nPlugX Korplug, Sogu, Kaba, DestroyRat, TVT,\nThoper\n\nPoison Ivy Breut, Darkmoon\n\nDerusbi Photos, Etso, Ocrums, win32.Agent.dbwr\n\nHikit Hikiti\n\nFexel DeputyDog\n\nZoxPNG gresim\n\nZoxRPC\n\n38 http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/threat-spotlight-group-72/\n39 http://emergingthreats.net/products/etpro-ruleset/daily-ruleset-update-summary/\n\n|Operation SMN Name|Other Industry Names|\n|---|---|\n|Hydraq|McRat, HydraQ/HidraQ, Naid, Homux, HomeUnix, MdmBot, Roarur|\n|Gh0st|Moudoor, Mydoor|\n|PlugX|Korplug, Sogu, Kaba, DestroyRat, TVT, Thoper|\n|Poison Ivy|Breut, Darkmoon|\n|Derusbi|Photos, Etso, Ocrums, win32.Agent.dbwr|\n|Hikit|Hikiti|\n|Fexel|DeputyDog|\n|ZoxPNG|gresim|\n|ZoxRPC||\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix E: Malware Hashes\n\nTo the best of our abilities, Novetta has filtered some of the sample hashes collected from the\nbelow sample hashes. This has been due to the highly targeted nature of some of the malware\nsamples Operation SMN has collected. The defensive value of knowing those samples or the\nhashes for organizations other than the targeted is nil given the technical information produced\nand shared by this effort. The below hashes are for sample families that leverage shared\ngeneric infrastructure between multiple compromised infrastructure or contain no configuration\ninformation in the binary.\n\n##### Links:\nhttp://www.novetta.com/operationsmn\n\n\n-----",
