    "plain_text": "# Evolving Trickbot Adds Detection Evasion and Screen- Locking Features\n\n**trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/evolving-trickbot-adds-detection-evasion-and-**\nscreen-locking-features\n\nThe malware known as Trickbot [started off as a banking trojan that used](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Malspam+pushing+Trickbot+banking+Trojan/22720/) [phishing techniques](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/banking-malware-emotet-and-trickbot-go-phishing-again)\n[– primarily malicious spam – to trick users into visiting copycat websites to steal their](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/look-locky-ransomwares-recent-spam-activities/)\ncredentials. Its authors continue to develop the already-troublesome malware by adding\nfeatures designed to make it more difficult to counter.\n\nSecurity researchers discovered a new module called spreader_x86.dll that contains two\nfiles, SsExecutor_x86.exe and screenLocker_x86.dll that form part of Trickbot’s new arsenal.\nThe first file, SsExecutor_x86.exe increases the malware’s evasion capabilities by attempting\nto add a link to the trojan's startup path by taking over registry use profiles to maintain\npersistence. ScreenLocker_x86.dll, on the other hand, gives Trickbot behavior that is similar\nto ransomware, as it attempts to lock victims' machines.\n\nThe module's locking mechanism deploys after the main infection chain runs, which could\nindicate that it is being used to attack unpatched corporate networks. The new functions\ncould have been added to expand the monetization schemes – corporate networks will often\nhave built-in security that prevents employees from visiting malicious URLs to minimize the\nimpact of these kinds of attacks. On the other hand, ransomware-style attacks could act as a\nbackup strategy, as well as a proven source of revenue for the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nCybersecurity is like a cat and mouse game between security providers and malware\nauthors. While security vendors constantly update and refine their software with new\ntechnology and features, the same can be said about malware. Thus, while traditional\nsecurity methods have become effective at preventing threats from affecting an organization,\nthere are methods of maximizing security with a proactive incident response strategy. This is\n[especially true for targeted attacks such as the recent Chessmaster campaign, which use a](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/chessmasters-new-strategy-evolving-tools-tactics/)\nwide array of sophisticated tools and tactics, or with evolving malware such as Trickbot,\nwhich can be challenging to mitigate for traditional security methods alone, especially if they\nadd evasion tools that allow them to slip through perimeter based security.\n\n[Cryptocurrency miners are examples of elusive malware that are on the rise in 2018. Many](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cryptocurrency-mining-malware-2018-new-menace/)\nof these kinds of malware work in the background, without showing obvious signs that they\nare already using resources for mining – something that can be problematic for certain\ntraditional security solutions. Employees that use personal laptops or works remotely\ncompounds this issue, as perimeter-based security is even more limited in this scenario.\nWith a proactive incident response strategy, the organization's security personnel can collect\nand analyze endpoint data, as well as provide intelligence on how to detect similar future\nattacks.\n\nA successful attack can be devastating to both a company’s finances and reputation,\nespecially when it comes to threats that directly affect customers and shareholders. Once an\nattack has done its damage to an organization, remediation can often take a large amount of\ntime and resources. This is why it's important to address threats before they can do their\ndamage. Given the sophisticated nature of many modern-day attacks, this often means that\ntraditional security solutions have to be supplemented with a human element – often\ninvolving IT personnel and system administrators working with security tools to monitor the\nnetwork, detect and respond to any threats on the network.\n\nOther proactive incident response strategies that organizations can implement:\n\nKeeping comprehensive logs of what happens within the network, which will allow IT\npersonnel to track any suspicious activity such as C&C server communication and\ntraffic from malicious URLs\nOnce an activity or data is deemed as suspicious, it should automatically be\ninvestigated to determine if it is malicious\nSifting through logs and data can be a challenge, but standardized alerts will help with\nstreamlining the monitoring process\n\nActively monitoring the network for any potential threats, as well as quickly responding to\nthese threats as they appear, can provide the organization’s security team the threat\nintelligence that they will need to identify malicious activities that may not be visible to\ntraditional security solutions.\n\nHIDE\n\n\n-----\n\n**Like it?
