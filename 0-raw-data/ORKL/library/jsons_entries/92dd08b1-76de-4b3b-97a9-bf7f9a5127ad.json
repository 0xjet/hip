(Photo by Adam Berry/Getty\nImages)\nWritten by [AJ Vicens](https://www.cyberscoop.com/author/aj-vicens/)\n\nJan 31, 2022 | CYBERSCOOP\nCybersecurity officials in Ukraine issued a warning Monday about yet another phishing attack\nusing either compromised or spoofed government email addresses, the second such\nwarning since Saturday.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Monday s alert warned of attackers targeting government institutions with malware-laced bait](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18273)\ndocuments hosted on Discord that come to targets within emails from the National Health\nService of Ukraine. The malware deploys a program called OutSteel that looks for certain file\n[extensions and steals them, and also deploys a second malicious program called SaintBot.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2021/04/a-deep-dive-into-saint-bot-downloader/)\n\n[Monday’s bulletin comes two days after government officials there warned of compromised](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/29/ukraine-russia-putin-nato-zelensky/?utm_campaign=wp_the_cybersecurity_202&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_cybersecurity202)\nemail accounts from the Ukrainian judiciary being used to target mostly Ukrainian\ngovernment targets with malware hidden within phony court inquiries.\n\n[Both operations come roughly two weeks after a cyberattack targeting Ukrainian government](https://www.cyberscoop.com/ukraine-website-hack-russia-tensions/)\nsystems that wiped some computers and defaced the websites of dozens of agencies’ sites.\n\nAll of the attacks are linked as part of “hybrid aggression, cyber aggression against Ukraine,”\nsaid Victor Zhora, the deputy chairman of the State Service of Special Communications and\nInformation Protection of Ukraine, but not as a single operation.\n\n“These are steps to continuously attack Ukrainian government agencies, objects of critical\ninfrastructure and to make us ready for any kind of new attack,” Zhora said.\n\nThe operations play out against the backdrop of ongoing tension between the government of\nRussia and a host of western governments, as the Russian government accused the U.S. of\nwanting war in Ukraine, and the U.S. continuing to insist that a Russian military attack on\nUkraine is possible at any time.\n\nAs the two nations’ [diplomats traded barbs at the United Nations Monday, officials in Kyiv](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/31/ukraine-russia-putin-nato/)\nsuch as Zhora are tasked with unpacking the technical details, as well as the methods and\nmotivations, behind ongoing cyberattacks directed at the government Ukraine.\n\nZhora spoke with CyberScoop Monday and explained the biggest outstanding questions\nrelated to the cyberattacks against his country, how the attacks fit into the context of Russian\naggression toward Ukraine for the last eight years, and how other countries, including the\nU.S., are helping decipher what’s happening in the attacks. The answers have been lightly\nedited and condensed for clarity.\n\n**CyberScoop: A fair amount of** **[data and context has been published about the latest](https://zetter.substack.com/p/dozens-of-computers-in-ukraine-wiped)**\n**round of cyberattacks on Ukraine. What are the biggest unanswered questions?**\n\n**Zhora: I would name two major questions. The first is the exact way and date of the**\ncompromising of the infrastructure software development company, which was used as a first\nstep of a supply chain attack on government websites. That’s what we need to discover.\n\nAnd that would be a key to the second major question: Attribution. We see a lot of signs, and\na lot of details, which can lead up to the conclusion that one of the Russian (advanced\npersistent threat) APT groups are responsible for this attack, but we need exact proof, which\ncan allow us to come out with a solid attribution.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CyberScoop: There have been** **public accusations of Russian-government**\n**involvement, but you’re saying that you want to be able to provide more forensic and**\n**digital evidence before formally attributing the attacks to specific groups?**\n\n**Zhora: We should have enough evidence before we blame anyone responsible for**\norganizing an attack. We already invited [experts] — and hopefully, we’ll be able to come out\nwith — a single statement involving international experts who will enrich our expertise.\n\n**CyberScoop: There have been reports of U.S. and other nations’ cybersecurity experts**\n**aiding Ukraine. What does help look like?**\n\n**Zhora: We appreciate the help from U.S. companies and officials, that is very valuable for**\nus. We have had some talks with different people, and we feel the support and practical\nsupport. We continue getting valuable information, which allows us to continue investigation.\n\nAs regards to some experts who will help in investigation, unfortunately, I cannot name them\nor their organization, but I’m confident their help will be very important and valuable for us.\n\n**CyberScoop: I would imagine your local experts are quite experienced with dealing**\n**with the kinds of attacks they’re seeing.**\n\n**Zhora: Providing comprehensive attribution means not just collecting evidence but also**\nmaking some conclusions from this evidence. It also should be combined with some intel\ndata and this intel data is particularly rich and fully owned by our foreign partners.\n\nSo I cannot say that Ukraine can provide such deep threat intelligence or APT intelligence\nlike the United States or United Kingdom can help with. That’s an area of cooperation to\nprovide us solid attribution. And that would be important, that this attribution should convince\neverybody that all steps that were taken were correct.\n\n**CyberScoop: There have been** **[reports of possible Belarusian connections to some of](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252512087/Russian-backed-hackers-defaced-Ukrainian-websites-as-cover-for-dangerous-malware-attack)**\n**the cyber activity that has been witnessed. Can you elaborate on any of that?**\n\n**Zhora: That was one of the questions, and could be one of the versions [of events]. For**\nexample the [attack] could be developed in the Russian Federation but executed by\nBelarusians. Or the territory from which Ukraine was attacked could be a territory of Belarus,\nand that could be done during the military exercises, which took place exactly at the same\ntime. But in my opinion, I don’t think that Belarusians would take the risk of being blamed for\nthis.\n\nWe understand that we have Russian troops, Russian soldiers, Russian arms, at the east,\nthat have occupied and annexed Crimea. We understand that this is [Vladimir] Putin, this is\nthe Kremlin, this is the Russian Federation. But with regards to Belarus, they always try to\n\n\n-----\n\nkeep their neutral position. And if it happens that they were somehow involved in this, that\nwould significantly change the total disposition of forces and there could be some geopolitical\nchanges with regards to this effect. So as an idea, it can exist, but as facts, I don’t think so.\n\n**CyberScoop:** **[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Western governments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/29/ukraine-russia-putin-nato-zelensky/?utm_campaign=wp_the_cybersecurity_202&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_cybersecurity202)**\n**are inciting “panic” by insisting that the Russian government will launch a full-scale**\n**attack any day. Do you think that includes any of the discussion around the**\n**cyberattacks that are making the headlines?**\n\n**Zhora: We consider this as a part of this hybrid aggression, parts of a big-information,**\npsychological special operation against Ukraine. Of course, we see the big geopolitical\ntension and some speculation about a potential land operation. In my opinion Kyiv is rather\ncalm and people are thinking about their day-to-day problems and about dealing with\nCOVID-19, and so the same things people are dealing with around the world. So that’s a\nmuch more important problem.\n\nBut of course, I understand that I cannot see the whole picture as the foreign leaders can\nsee. So my picture is about cybersecurity, and I will say that it’s not scary, but alarming. We\nwitnessed the recent cyberattack which shows us some serious weaknesses, which we need\nto quickly resolve. And the latest phishing campaigns confirm the adversary’s abilities and\ntheir will to to continue aggression.\n\nThis means that critical infrastructure should be our main point of interest. We need to be\naware of risks that can happen to critical infrastructure, especially regarding this winter time\nand potential energy prices, which is basically coming for the whole world.\n\n**CyberScoop:** **[Cisco’s Talos threat intelligence unit recently warned companies with](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/01/ukraine-campaign-delivers-defacement.html)**\n**connections to Ukraine to treat the cyberattacks seriously, but also to avoid “panic”**\n**and that cybersecurity experts have seen these kinds of attacks in Ukraine “on and off**\n**for years.” Is the activity we’re seeing in recent weeks evidence of more attacks than**\n**usual, or is the quantity of attacks relatively stable?**\n\n**Zhora: The growth is constant. So each month, we register up to 10% growth of attempts.**\nSo it’s normal way of things, and that’s the situation that we need to to understand and to try\nto live with.\n\nJust the same way as we live with constant shooting on the eastern border. It’s absolutely\nquiet here in Kyiv and 99% of Ukrainian territory, but unfortunately, almost every day or\nweek, we have victims from Ukrainian troops on the east. That’s a situation which has lasted\nfor eight years, and nobody knows how many years it will last more.\n\n\n-----",
