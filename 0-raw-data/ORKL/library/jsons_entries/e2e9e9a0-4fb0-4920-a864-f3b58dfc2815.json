    "plain_text": "# Distribution of malicious Hangul documents disguised as press releases for the 20th presidential election onboard voting\n\n**asec.ahnlab.com/ko/32330**\n\nMarch 3, 2022\n\nAhead of the presidential election, the ASEC analysis team confirmed that malicious Korean\ndocuments disguised as “press release on board the 20th presidential election”\n**were being distributed. The attacker distributed the malicious Korean document on**\nFebruary 28th, and the malicious document was not secured, but according to the company's\nAhnLab Smart Defense (ASD) infrastructure log, it is estimated that the batch file is driven\nthrough the internal OLE object to execute PowerShell. .\n\nDistribution file name: Press release\n(220228)_March_1st___March_4th_20th_Presidential Election_Shipboard\nVoting_Conducted (final).hwp\n\n[Figure 1] shows the batch file path and Korean file name confirmed in the infrastructure.\nWhile the same normal Korean document size is 2.06 MB, the malicious Korean document is\n2.42 MB, and it seems that the document was created by inserting an additional BAT file\ninside.\n\n[Figure 1] ASD infrastructure collection\n\n%TEMP%\\mx6.bat (path of batch file creation)\n\n\n-----\n\nA similar type of attack was also confirmed on February 7th. According to the article, the\nattacker impersonated the National Election Commission (NEC) and distributed malicious\ndocuments disguised as a normal document titled “Public Recruitment of Counting\nObservers for the 20th Presidential Election”.\n\n“North Korean hackers distributing malicious press releases under the guise of the National\nElection Commission” | DailyNK\nIt was found on the 8th that a North Korean hacking organization was distributing hacking emails impersonating the National Election Commission (NEC). Considering the fact that the\npress release distributed by the National Election Commission was used, it is highly likely\nthat the attack is being carried out targeting journalists in the media, so caution is required.\nThe common features of the malicious Hangul documents that were circulated at the time\nand the documents used in this attack are as follows.\n\nDissemination of malicious Korean documents disguised as the same institution (NEC)\n\n\n-----\n\nInducing Batch File Execution in OLE Object Way\nA PowerShell command containing a variable name ( $kkx9 ) similar to the one used\nin the NEC impersonation attack on 2/7 ( $kk y4 )\n\nPart of the PowerShell command: ( $kkx9 ='[DllImport(“user32.dll”)] public\nstatic extern bool ShowWindow(int handle, int state);')\n\n[Figure 2] Some of the collected PowerShell commands\n\n[Figure 3] below is a normal Korean document presumed to have been used by the attacker\nfor distribution.\n\n[Figure 3] Normal Korean document (press release\n(220228)_March_1st___March_4th_20th_Presidential Election_Shipboard Voting_Conduct\n\n(final).hwp)\n\n\n-----\n\nNormal official Korean documents can be found on the official website of the National\n[Election Commission ( https://www.nec.go.kr/ ), and users should be skeptical when](https://www.nec.go.kr/)\ndownloading similar documents from an unknown site.\n\n[https://www.nec.go.kr/cmm/dozen/view.do?cbIdx=1090&bcIdx=164018&fileNo=1](https://www.nec.go.kr/cmm/dozen/view.do?cbIdx=1090&bcIdx=164018&fileNo=1)\n(Document download address)\n\nThe attackers seem to be carrying out various attacks impersonating the National Election\nCommission as the 20th presidential election approaches. AhnLab continues to monitor\nsimilar malicious behaviors and will share new information as soon as it becomes available.\n\n**[AhnLab V3 product correspondence]**\n\n**[Behavior Detection]**\n– Execution/MDP.Powershell.M4208\n\n**Related IOCs and related detailed analysis information can be checked through**\n**AhnLab's next-generation threat intelligence platform 'AhnLab TIP'**\n**subscription service.**\n\n[Categories: Malware information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/ko/category/malware/)\n\n[Tagged as: National Election Commission,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/%ec%84%a0%ea%b4%80%ec%9c%84/) [Korean document](https://asec.ahnlab.com/ko/tag/%ed%95%9c%ea%b8%80%eb%ac%b8%ec%84%9c/)\n\n\n-----",
