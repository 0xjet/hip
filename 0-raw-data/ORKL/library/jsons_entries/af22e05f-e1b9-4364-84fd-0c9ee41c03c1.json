The components of\nthe framework are the following:\n\nMgBot EXE dropper\nMgBot DLL Loader\nMgBot Plugins\n\nThe MgBot plugins that were deployed in this activity have numerous capabilities that can\nprovide the attackers with a significant amount of information about compromised machines.\nAmong the unique plugins that were deployed during this activity were:\n\nNetwork scanner – innocence.dll\n\nCapabilities include: arp scan, http scan, determining the type of server (e.g.\nSQL, WebLogic, Redis, etc.) it is running on.\nA Chrome and Firefox infostealer that can gather information such as bookmarks and\nbrowsing history – bkmk.dll\nLogging module – famdowm.dll\n\n[Based on the open-source easylogging++, which can carry out basic logging,](https://github.com/amrayn/easyloggingpp)\ntrack performance and more.\nQQ messages infostealer – qmsdp.dll\n\nBased on [this blog, which details how a chat tool message database was cracked](https://blog.csdn.net/Px01Ih8/article/details/115435565)\nby hackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nActive Directory enumeration – ceeeb.dll\n\nCollects the following information from Active directory:\n\nMembers info\nComputers\nLocal Admins\nRemote Desktop Users\nDcom Users\nPassword dumper – cpfwplgx.dll\n\nDrops a file to call the MiniDumpWriteDump API to dump a process memory.\nQQ Keylogger – kstrcs.dll\n\nKeylogger that targets QQEdit.exe and QQ.exe processes.\nScreen and clipboard grabber – cbmrpa.dll\n\nCaptures clipboard and drag and drop data and saves it to a file.\nOutlook and Foxmail credentials stealer – maillfpassword.dll\nAudio capture – prsm.dll\n\nCaptures audio from the infected system.\nUses COM objects IMMDeviceEnumerator, IAudioCaptureClient.\nProcess Watchdog – ansecprocesskeep.dll\n\nRegistered as service AnsecProcessKeep.\nConfirmed to be a watchdog that keeps a process running.\nThe process name is found in an .ini file.\n\nAll of these capabilities would have allowed the attackers to collect a significant amount of\ninformation from victim machines. The capabilities of these plugins also show that the main\ngoal of the attackers during this campaign was information-gathering.\n\nDaggerfly’s development of these previously unseen plugins demonstrates that the attack\ngroup is continuing to actively develop its malware and the tools it can use to target victim\nnetworks.\n\n## Continuation of a Trend\n\nTelecoms companies will always be a key target in intelligence gathering campaigns due to\nthe access they can potentially provide to the communications of end-users.\n\nSymantec’s Threat Hunter team also spotted some other recent activity targeting telecoms\ncompanies that was linked with moderate confidence to the threat actor Othorene (aka\nGallium), in what appeared to be a continuation of an intelligence-gathering campaign first\n[reported on by SentinelOne under the name Operation Tainted Love in March. SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/)\nreported that in that campaign Othorene was targeting telecoms companies in the Middle\nEast.\n\n\n-----\n\nOthorene has been active since around 2014, and it is believed to be a relatively small group\nthat has a strong focus on the surveillance of individuals. There are some indications that\nOthorene may have links with the APT41 (aka Blackfly, Grayfly) APT group also. Overlap of\nboth personnel and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) among Chinese APT groups\nis not uncommon, and can mean that attributing activity to one group with high confidence is\ndifficult.\n\nIn the activity Symantec saw, we found three additional victims of the same campaign that\nSentinelOne detailed, located in Asia and Africa. Two of the three were subsidiaries of the\nsame Middle Eastern telecoms firm. The attackers had been active on victim networks since\nNovember 2022. Symantec saw attackers dumping credentials and scanning the network\nusing NbtScan.\n\nThe main malware (pc.exe dubbed mim221) in this campaign was used to dump credentials,\nand it had the same password as the malware used in the activity documented by\nSentinelOne. The attackers also moved laterally across victims’ networks, used Scheduled\nTask for persistence, and dumped SAM and System hives from the registry. There were\nindications that the attackers may have exported the Active Directory database on victim\nmachines, and they were also able to gain access to domain controllers, giving them deep\naccess to victim networks.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nIf an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect\nand block that file.\n\n**File Indicators – Daggerfly**\n\n**MgBot Dropper**\n\nc89316e87c5761e0fc50db1214beb32a08c73d2cad9df8c678c8e44ed66c1dab\n\n90e15eaf6385b41fcbf021ecbd8d86b8c31ba48c2c5c3d1edb8851896f4f72fe\n\n**MgBot – aasrvd.dll, pmsrvd.dll**\n\n706c9030c2fa5eb758fa2113df3a7e79257808b3e79e46869d1bf279ed488c36\n\n017187a1b6d58c69d90d81055db031f1a7569a3b95743679b21e44ea82cfb6c7\n\n**MgBot Plugins**\n\n\n-----\n\ncb8aede4ad660adc1c78a513e7d5724cac8073bea9d6a77cf3b04b019395979a\n\n2dcf9e556332da2a17a44dfceda5e2421c88168aafea73e2811d65e9521c715c\n\na6ed16244a5b965f0e0b84b21dcc6f51ad1e413dc2ad243a6f5853cd9ac8da0b\n\nee6a3331c6b8f3f955def71a6c7c97bf86ddf4ce3e75a63ea4e9cd6e20701024\n\n585db6ab2f7b452091ddb29de519485027665335afcdb34957ff1425ecc3ec4b\n\n29df6c3f7d13b259b3bc5d56f2cdd14782021fc5f9597a3ccece51ffac2010a0\nea2be3d0217a2efeb06c93e32f489a457bdea154fb4a900f26bef83e2053f4fd\n\n54198678b98c2094e74159d7456dd74d12ab4244e1d9376d8f4d864f6237cd79\n\nd9eec27bf827669cf13bfdb7be3fdb0fdf05a26d5b74adecaf2f0a48105ae934\n\ncb7d9feda7d8ebfba93ec428d5a8a4382bf58e5a70e4b51eb1938d2691d5d4a5\n\n2c0cfe2f4f1e7539b4700e1205411ec084cbc574f9e4710ecd4733fbf0f8a7dc\n\na16a70b0a1ac0718149a31c780edb126379a0d375d9f6007a6def3141bec6810\n\n0bcdcc0515d30c28017fd7931b8a787feebe9ee3819aa2b758ce915b8ba40f99\n\n**PlugX Loader – proccom.dll, djcu.dll**\n\nc31b409b1fe9b6387b03f7aedeafd3721b4ec6d6011da671df49e241394da154\n\ndb489e9760da2ed362476c4e0e9ddd6e275a84391542a6966dbcda0261b3f30a\n\n632cd9067fb32ac8fbbe93eb134e58bd99601c8690f97ca53e8e17dda5d44e0e\n\n**DumpCredStore – dumpcredstore.ps1, a.ps1**\n\nc1e91a5f9cc23f3626326dab2dcdf4904e6f8a332e2bce8b9a0854b371c2b350\n\n5a0976fef89e32ddcf62c790f9bb4c174a79004e627c3521604f46bf5cc7bea2\n\n**AnyDesk – anydesk.exe**\n\n7bcff667ab676c8f4f434d14cfc7949e596ca42613c757752330e07c5ea2a453\n\n**File Indicators – Othorene**\n\n3f75818e2e43a744980254bfdc1225e7743689b378081c560e824a36e0e0a195 – pc.exe,\nrpc.exe (Main malware)\n\n\n-----\n\n1b8500e27edc87464b8e5786dc8c2beed9a8c6e58b82e50280cebb7f233bcde4 – get.exe\n(used to print Syskey and Samkey)\n\n03bc62bd9a681bdcb85db33a08b6f2b41f853de84aa237ae7216432a6f8f817e – pc.dll\n\nae39ced76c78e7c2043b813718e3cd610e1a8adac1f9ad5e69cf06bd6e38a5bd – pc.dll\n\nf6f6152db941a03e1f45d52ab55a2e3d774015ccb8828533654e3f3161cfcd21 – pc.exe\n\n2f4a97dc70f06e0235796fec6393579999c224e144adcff908e0c681c123a8a2 – pc.dll\n\n22069984cba22be84fe33a886d989b683de6eb09f001670dbd8c1b605460d454 – pc.dll\n\n7b945fb1bdeb27a35fab7c2e0f5f45e0e64df7821dd1417a77922c9b08acfdc3 – rpc.dll\n\ne8be3e40f79981a1c29c15992da116ea969ab5a15dc514479871a50b20b10158 – pc.dl\n\nb5c46c2604e29e24c6eb373a7287d919da5c18c04572021f20b8e1966b86d585 – rpc.dll\n\n53d2506723f4d69afca33e90142833b132ed11dd0766192a087cb206840f3692 – test.exe\n\n26d129aaa4f0f830a7a20fe6317ee4a254b9caac52730b6fed6c482be4a5c79d – g.dll\n\nb45355c8b84b57ae015ad0aebfa8707be3f33e12731f7f8c282c8ee51f962292 – g.dll\n\n17dce65529069529bcb5ced04721d641bf6d7a7ac61d43aaf1bca2f6e08ead56 –\ngetHashFlsa64.dll\n\n98b6992749819d0a34a196768c6c0d43b100ef754194308eae6aaa90352e2c13 –\ngetHashFlsa64.dll\n\n6d5be3e6939a7c86280044eebe71c566b48981a3341193aa3aff634a3a5d1bbd –\ngetHashFlsa64.dll\n\n1cf04c3e8349171d907b911bc2a23bdb544d88e2f9b8fcc516d8bcf68168aede –\ngetHashFlsa64.dll\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n\n-----\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
