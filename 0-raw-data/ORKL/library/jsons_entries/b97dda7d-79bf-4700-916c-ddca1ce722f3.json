    "plain_text": "# Analysis of Project Cobra\n\n**blog.gdatasoftware.com/2015/01/23926-analysis-of-project-cobra**\n\nProject Cobra and the Carbon System were mentioned by Kaspersky in the article called “The Epic Turla Operation” . This malware is used by\nthe same actors as Uroburos (aka Snake/Turla) and Agent.BTZ. We estimate that Carbon System was developed after Agent.BTZ and before\nUroburos. The Carbon System shares some technical details with Uroburos and Agent.BTZ (encryption key, encryption algorithm, design, …)\nand some other links, such as the name of the snake-related project: Cobra. Uroburos could be considered as a kernel centric “snake” and\nCobra Carbon System as a userland centric “snake”.\n\nOne specification of the group behind this threat is the fact that when they developed new tools, the old ones are not destroyed or abandoned\nbut still maintained and used. Thanks to our collection of samples we are able to draw the following timeline:\n\nThe Cobra can be considered as an extensible framework. This framework is generally downloaded and dropped by a reconnaissance\n[malware for example Tavdig, aka Wipbot (Symantec) or also Epic Backdoor (Kaspersky). The following schema illustrates the “modus opandi”](http://securelist.com/analysis/publications/65545/the-epic-turla-operation/)\nused by the Uroburos actors:\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing IOC (Indicators of Compromise) to detect this malware is quite complicated, because the malware authors made efforts to randomize\nmany factors. For example, the attackers drop the malware into different directories, using the files present, also chosen randomly, to store the\nmalware configuration.\n\nDue to these characteristics, the experts of the G DATA SecurityLabs decided to publish an analysis of the framework dropped by the file with\nthe md5: cb1b68d9971c2353c2d6a8119c49b51f. G DATA security solutions detect this file as Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and\nWin32.Trojan.Cobra.B (Engine B).\n\nWe can find the compilation path in a file embedded in the dropper:\nf:\\Workshop\\Projects\\cobra\\carbon_system\\x64\\Release\\carbon_system.pdb\n\nLooking at this, we can easily identify that “Carbon System” is a part of the “Cobra” project.\n\n## Dropper\n\nThe dropper is used to install four files on the infected system. The dropped files are stored in the resources of the binary. The dropper has the\n32-bit and the 64-bit version of the executable files embedded. It installs the following files:\n\nminiport.dat: configuration file;\nstage 1: the file name is randomly chosen from ipvpn.dll,srsvc.dll or kmsvc.dll. This library is registered as a service;\nstage 2: the file name is msimghlp.dll. It’s the orchestrator of the malware (called “system” by the author);\nstage 3: the file name is msximl.dll. This library (called “user” by the authors) is injected in the browsers and the email clients in order to\ncommunicate to the outside via web requests.\n\nThe persistence is performed by the creation of a service (HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Service\\). The service name depends on the\nchosen stage 1 file name:\n\n<thead></thead>\n\n\n**File**\n**Name**\n\n\n**Service**\n**Name** **Display Name**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n**(Copy&Paste from the binary)**\n\n\n-----\n\nipvpn.dll ipvpn Virtual Private\nNetwork Routing\nService\n\nsrsvc.dll srservice System Restore\nService\n\nkmsvc.dll hkmsvc Health Key and\nCertificate\nManagement\nService\n\n\nProvides enchanced network management while active VPN connection established. Support All\nnecessary functions and maintain dynamic table rules. Enforcement technologies that use virtual\nnetworks may not function properly without this service\n\nPerforms system restore functions. To stop service, turn off System Restore from the System\nRestore tab in My Computer.\n\nProvides X.509 certificate and key management services for the Network Access Protection\nAgent (NAPAgent). Enforcement technologies that use X.509 certificates may not function\nproperly without this service\n\n\nThe descriptions reveal spelling mistakes and the sentence structure may indicate that the texts have been written by non-native speakers.\n\nStage 1 is always installed in %SystemRoot%\\system32\\\n\nTo install something into %SystemRoot%, the attackers have to have gained administration privileges before they executed the dropper. The\nthree other dropped files are stored in an existing directory in %ProgramFiles%, randomly chosen.\n\nDuring the installation, executed in a command line, the dropper displays the following information:\n\nThe screenshot shows the string “LUCKY STRIKE!!!”, displayed in case the installation was carried out successfully and “Idioten???” in case of\nany installation error. To be able to find the random installation path, the dropper modifies a legitimate .inf file (also chosen randomly) in\n%SystemRoot%\\inf\\ to add the following information to the end of the file:\n\n[B8744A58]\n\nroot=C:\\Program Files\\Windows NT\\Accessoiries\\en-US\n\nThe ID between the brackets is a unique ID and the root variable contains the path in which the three additional files are installed.\n\nThe tricks put in place by the authors – random file names and random installation paths – are used to limit the detection possible with\nIndicators of Compromise. Generally, security researchers use these kinds of artifacts in order to detect the compromise of systems.\n\n## Stage 1: loader\n\nMD5: 43e896ede6fe025ee90f7f27c6d376a4\nG DATA security solutions detect this as Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and   Win32.Trojan.Cobra.A (Engine B).\n\n\n-----\n\ne st stage s at e s a as t e u be o st uct o s a d act o s s at e s a S p y spo e, ts pu pose s to oad t e seco d stage\nTo perform this task, the first stage checks all of the files in %SystemRoot%\\inf\\ in order to find the entry with the unique ID previously\nmentioned and therefore to determine the path for stage 2. After that, the library of the second stage is loaded and, subsequently, the exported\nfunction ModuleStart() is executed:\n\n## Stage 2: the orchestrator\n\nMd5: e6d1dcc6c2601e592f2b03f35b06fa8f\n\nVersion: 3.71\n\nG DATA security solutions detect this threat as Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and Win32.Trojan.Cobra.B (Engine B).\n\nThe second stage is called “system” by the authors of the malware. The internal name of the library is carbon_system.dll.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to stay in background and orchestrate several requests and tasks made by the other .dlls or named pipe\nconnections.\n\n## Mutex creation\n\nThe orchestrator creates several mutexes. These mutexes are used for two reasons:\n\nused by the third stage in order to detect whether the orchestrator has been launched correctly on the infected system;\nused to execute the orchestrator only once.\n\nHere are the created mutexes:\n\nGlobal\\MSCTF.Shared.MUTEX.zRX\nGlobal\\DBWindowsBase\nGlobal\\IEFrame.LockDefaultBrowser\nGlobal\\WinSta0_DesktopSessionMut\nGlobal\\{5FA3BC02-920F-D42A-68BC-04F2A75BE158}\nGlobal\\SENS.LockStarterCacheResource\nGlobal\\ShimSharedMemoryLock\n\n## Working files and directories\n\nHere are the working files and directories used by the orchestrator. The orchestrator creates one single random path and then stores all\nnecessary folders mentioned under this one randomly generated path:\n\n%randompath%\\Nls\\: directory related to the tasks to be executed\n%randompath%\\0208\\: directory related to the temporary files\n%randompath%\\System\\: directory related to the additional plugins\n%randompath%\\System\\bootmisc.sdi: seems not to be used\n%randompath%\\0208\\C 56743 NLS: files related to the tasks to be executed and the plugins\n\n\n-----\n\n% a do pat %\\ s\\b9s3co a es e ated to t e tas s to be e ecuted a d t e a ed p pe\n%randompath%\\Nls\\a67ncodc.ax: file related to the tasks to be executed\n%randompath%\\vndkrmn.dic: log file\n%randompath%\\qavsrc.dat: log file\n%randompath%\\miniport.dat: configuration file\n%randompath%\\asmcerts.rs: purpose currently unknown\n%randompath%\\getcert.rs: purpose currently unknown\n\nThe files are not automatically created during the startup of the malware. The files are created only if the orchestrator needs them.\n\n## Configuration file\n\n[The configuration file (miniport.dat) is used by the second and the third stage. The file is encrypted with the CAST-128 algorithm, the same](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAST-128)\nalgorithm that has been used by Uroburos to encrypt the file systems. The encryption key is:\n\n{ 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 0x9a, 0xbc, 0xde, 0xf0, 0xfe, 0xfc, 0xba, 0x98, 0x76, 0x54, 0x32, 0x10 }\nNote: following the logic, 0xfc would be expected to be 0xdc.\n\nHere is an example of the configuration file:\n\npaul@gdata:~/Carbon/$ ./decrypt.py miniport.dat\n\n[NAME]\n\nobject_id=acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1\n\niproc = iexplore.exe,outlook.exe,msimn.exe,firefox.exe,opera.exe,chrome.exe\n\nex = #,netscape.exe,mozilla.exe,adobeupdater.exe,chrome.exe\n\n[TIME]\n\nuser_winmin = 1800000\n\nuser_winmax = 3600000\n\nsys_winmin = 3600000\n\nsys_winmax = 3700000\n\ntask_min = 20000\n\ntask_max = 30000\n\ncheckmin = 60000\n\ncheckmax = 70000\n\nlogmin = 60000\n\nlogmax = 120000\n\nlastconnect=1419925298\n\ntimestop=\n\nactive_con = 900000\n\ntime2task=3600000\n\ncheck_lastconnect=1419925298\n\n[CW_LOCAL]\n\nquantity = 0\n\n[CW_INET]\n\nquantity = 4\n\naddress1 = soheylistore.ir:80:/modules/mod_feed/feed.php\n\naddress2 = tazohor.com:80:/wp-includes/feed-rss-comments.php\n\naddress3 = jucheafrica.com:80:/wp-includes/class-wp-edit.php\n\naddress4 = 61paris.fr:80:/wp-includes/ms-set.php\n\n[CW_INET_RESULTS]\n\nquantity = 4\n\naddress1 = soheylistore.ir:80:/modules/mod_feed/feed.php\n\naddress2 = tazohor.com:80:/wp-includes/feed-rss-comments.php\n\naddress3 = jucheafrica.com:80:/wp-includes/class-wp-edit.php\n\naddress4 = 61paris.fr:80:/wp-includes/ms-set.php\n\n[TRANSPORT]\n\nsystem_pipe = comnap\n\nspstatus = yes\n\nadaptable = no\n\n[DHCP]\n\nserver = 135\n\n\n-----\n\n[ OG]\nlogperiod = 7200\nlastsend=1419924312\n\n[WORKDATA]\nrun_task=\nrun_task_system=\n\n[VERSION]\nSystem=3/71\nUser=3/62\n\nThe websites listed in [CW_INET] and [CW_INET_RESULTS] are all compromised legitimate WordPress websites. By the time of writing this\narticle, all websites have been cleaned and patched.\nThe file format is the same as the .ini file format from Windows. The authors use the Windows API to parse the configuration\n(GetPrivateProfileStringA()).\nThe file contains:\n\nA unique ID to identify the infected machine (object_id);\nThe command and control server used by stage 3 (addressX);\nThe version of the “system” and the “user” library (in [VERSION]);\nThe frequency and time of execution of several internal tasks ([TIME]);\nThe name of the named pipe used as communication channel between the “system” and the “user” (system_pipe);\nThe process name where stage 3 will be injected (iproc);\n…\n\n## Communication via named pipes\n\nThe orchestrator creates two named pipes in order to communicate with stage 3 or to receive messages from an external machine:\n\n\\\\.\\\\pipe\\sdlrpc\n\\\\.\\\\pipe\\comnap (the name in the configuration file)\n\n## Features\n\nThe orchestrator creates nine threads in order to handle the different features. We will now have a look at the most interesting threads.\n\nOne thread is used to check if the parameters in the configuration file have changed.\n\nA second thread is used to check the available hard disk space. If the HDD space is low, the orchestrator generates an entry in the log file:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe preceding screenshot reveals a rather interesting use of English, again. From what we can conclude, we believe “Survive me” is supposed\nto mean something like “Rescue me” in the sense of “help me to survive”.\n\nA third thread is created in order to handle the tasks. A task is a command sent from the C&C that is to be executed. The code to be executed\nis stored locally on the infected machine. The orchestrator is able to execute libraries (by executing the export start()) or to execute Windows’\ncommand line. The command line can be execute with the current user privilege or with the privilege of another user (via CreateProcessA() or\nCreateProcessAsUserA()):\n\n\n-----\n\nA fourth thread is used to handle the log rotation file (vndkrmn.dic).\n\nA fifth thread is used to create and read the data sent to the named pipes.\n\nA sixth thread is used to load plugins. For the orchestrator a module is a library file with a specific export called ModuleStart(). The plugin list is\nstored in the configuration file ([PLUGINS]). This thread is very similar to the third thread, but is bares some minor differences. The function to\nexecute the plugins is not the same.\n\nFinally a seventh thread is used to inject stage 3 (msximl.dll) into the browsers and email clients. The list of the targeted processes is stored in\nthe configuration file:\niproc = iexplore.exe,outlook.exe,msimn.exe,firefox.exe,opera.exe,chrome.exe\nAs usual, the injected library is executed via the ModuleStart() exports.\n\n## Log file\n\nThe orchestrator and stage 3 generate a shared log file. The file is encrypted with the same algorithm and the same key as the configuration\nfile. Here is an example of the content:\n\npaul@gdata:~/Carbon$ ./decrypt.py infected/vndkrmn.dic\n\n[LOG]\n\nstart=1\n\n30/12/14|08:28:44|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|ST|3/71|0|\n\n30/12/14|08:29:50|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|INJ|C:\\Program Files\\Windows Mail\\en-US\\msximl.dll|\n\n30/12/14|08:30:28|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|INJ|0|2204|\n\n30/12/14|08:30:28|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|ST|3/62|\"C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe\" :2204|\n\n30/12/14|08:30:28|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|ST|2204:END|\n\n30/12/14|08:30:39|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|W|-1|0|ALL|NOINET|\n\n30/12/14|08:30:41|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|W|-1|0|ALL|NOINET|\n\n30/12/14|08:37:18|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|STOP|3/71|0|\n30/12/14|08:37:18|acce6511 ba11 fa11 f0047d1|s|STOP|OK|\n\n\n-----\n\n30/ / |08 39 5|acce65 ba a 00 d |s|S |3/ |0|\n30/12/14|08:41:13|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|INJ|C:\\Program Files\\Windows Mail\\en-US\\msximl.dll|\n30/12/14|08:41:34|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|INJ|0|2196|\n30/12/14|08:41:34|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|ST|3/62|\"C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe\" :2196|\n30/12/14|08:41:34|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|ST|2196:END|\n30/12/14|08:41:35|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|OPER|Wrong config: no lastconnect|\n30/12/14|08:41:36|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|P|0|NULL|0|Sleep:41|\n30/12/14|08:41:38|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|OPER|Wrong config: no lastconnect|\n30/12/14|08:41:39|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|W|-1|0|tazohor.com:/|nrt|\n30/12/14|08:41:40|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|W|-1|0|61paris.fr:/|nrt|\n30/12/14|08:41:40|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|W|0|NULL|0|Sleep:1816467|\n30/12/14|08:41:40|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|P|0|NULL|0|Sleep:604\n\nThe log format is:\nDate|Time|Unique ID|source|message\n\nThe source can be:\n\nS: stands for the orchestrator (or “System”);\nU: stands for the injected library (or “User”).\n\nThe format of the message is not always the same. However, the first part is the executed feature:\n\nST: start (either for the orchestrator or the injected library); the second part of the message is the version (for example 3.71 for the\norchestrator and 3.62 for the injected library) and, regarding the injected library, the name of the host process;\nSTOP: stop;\nOPER: message for the operator (for example when the disk space is low);\nW: web requests;\nINJ: injection; the second part of the message is the path of the file (lib) used to be injected into e.g. the browser or the PID;\nL: load library log message;\nS: log rotation message;\nT: message linked to the task execution;\n\n## Stage 3: the injected library\n\nMd5: 554450c1ecb925693fedbb9e56702646\n\nVersion: 3.62\n\nThis threat is detected by G DATA security solutions as Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and Win32.Trojan.Cobra.B (Engine B).\n\nStage 3 is called “user” by the authors. The internal name of the library is CARBON.dll.\n\nThe purpose of this stage is to communicate to the outside via web requests. The communication is used to ex-filtrate data and to receive\norders (or plugins or code to execute).\n\n## Mutex check\n\nThe first task of stage 3 is to check whether the mutexes created by the orchestrator are available or not, to make sure the orchestrator has\nstarted correctly:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Check of the Internet connection\n\nBefore communicating with the command and control server, stage 3 checks whether an Internet connection is available by contacting:\n\nwww.google.com\nwww.yahoo.com\nwww.bing.com\nupdate.microsoft.com\nwindowsupdate.microsoft.com\nmicrosoft.com\n\nIn case the connection does not work, the following message is written into the log file:\n\n|u|W|-1|0|ALL|NOINET|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Communication to the command & controls\n\nThe communication to the operators is performed via the URL stored in the configuration file.\n\nFirstly, the malware performs a GET request in order to identify whether the C&C is up and running.\n\n[If the first query is a success, a second request is sent to the C&C with the difference that some data is included into an HTTP Cookie. The](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie)\ncontent of the cookie is catid, task, id, forumid, itemid, link, layout, start, limit (none of the parameters is mandatory). The data sent in this\ncookie is encrypted, using the CAST-128 algorithm, and encoded.\n\nThe malware can also generate POST requests. Here is an example of the pattern:\nPOST hxxp://%s/%s?uid=%d&context=%s&mode=text&data=%s\n\nThe malware uses the same technique as Tavdig does to receive orders. The data can be seen between the <div> and the </div> field in the\nfollowing screenshot:\n\n## Additional features\n\nStage 3 is able to execute tasks, exactly as the orchestrator is. The code concerning the features is exactly the same as the code the\norchestrator uses. We assume that this is the case due to copy & paste. The “user” is able to execute libraries (by executing the export start())\nand to execute Windows command line. The command line can be executed with the current user privilege or with the privilege of another user\n(via CreateProcessA() or CreateProcessAsUserA()).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis analysis shows us that the actors behind Uroburos, Agent.BTZ and the Carbon System are skilled and still active. This sample we\nanalyzed demonstrates how the authors tried to complicate the detection and the use of Indicators of Compromise. Summarized, some of the\ntricks we have encountered:\n\nuse of random service names;\nus of random file names;\nuse of random installation directory names;\nconfiguration of the named pipe name;\n…\n\nCarbon System is a real extensible framework with a plugin management. As these plugins are provided by the contacted C&C servers, it can\nbe anything – nothing has to be pre-bundled. Due to the nature of the malware attacks, we can imagine those plugins to be anything\nconnected to cyber espionage from keyloggers to credentials stealers eavesdropping mechanisms and much more An attacked enterprise or\n\n\n-----\n\no ga at o ou d be a ope boo o t e attac e s\n\nThe architecture is complex, with an orchestrator and a library injected into the browsers’ and email clients’ processes. Obviously, this\napproach resembles what we have seen looking at Uroburos. The framework could be considered as a “draft” but still very powerful version (in\nuser-land only) of Uroburos. We believe that Uroburos is the product of the Cobra malware evolution. Although Uroburos is a new branch, not\na linear follow-up.\n\nLooking at the whole picture that we can draw until now, we can say that everything regarding this whole campaign is highly professional. We\nhave analyzed various samples and have drawn many conclusions. Even though there are still many open questions that need to be\nanswered, we come closer to charming the snakes – The Cobra, the venomous animal with the deadly bite, and Uroburos, the self-sustaining\ncreepy mixture of a snake and a dragon. This kind of herpetology became quite interesting and we are thrilled to find out more about the\ncampaigns.\n\n\n-----",
