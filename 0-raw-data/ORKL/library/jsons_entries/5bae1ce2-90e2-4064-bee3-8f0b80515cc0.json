    "plain_text": "# Threat spotlight: WastedLocker, customized ransomware\n\n**[blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2020/07/threat-spotlight-wastedlocker-customized-ransomware/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2020/07/threat-spotlight-wastedlocker-customized-ransomware/)**\n\nPieter Arntz July 10, 2020\n\nWastedLocker is a new ransomware operated by a malware exploitation gang commonly\n[known as the Evil Corp gang. The same gang that is associated with Dridex and BitPaymer.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/trojan-dridex/)\n\nThe attribution is not based on the malware variants as WastedLocker is very different from\nBitPaymer. What was kept was the ability to add specific modules for different targets.\n\nThe attacks performed using WastedLocker are highly targeted at very specific\norganizations. It is suspected that during a first penetration attempt an assessment of active\ndefenses is made and the next attempt will be specifically designed to circumvent the active\nsecurity software and other perimeter protection.\n\nThe ransomware name is derived from the filename it creates which includes an abbreviation\nof the victim’s name and the string “wasted”.\n\nFor each encrypted file, the attackers create a separate file that contains the ransomware\nnote. The ransom note has the same name as the associated file with the addition of “_info”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransom demands are steep, ranging from $500,000 to over $10 million in Bitcoin. Given\nthat the operators make every effort to go after any backups, some organizations may feel\nthe need to pay up. Where other ransomware operators are adding the exfiltration and even\nauction of stolen data to their arsenal, the Evil Corp gang has shown no inclination in that\ndirection yet.\n\nHistorically the Evil Corp gang targets mostly US organizations and it looks like they are\nstaying on that track with a few victims in Europe. The main players in the group are believed\nto be Russian.\n\n## The importance of offline backups\n\nIn general, we can state that if this gang has found an entrance into your network it will be\nimpossible to stop them from encrypting at least part of your files. The only thing that can\n[help you salvage your files in such a case is if you have either roll-back technology or a form](https://support.malwarebytes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039756814-Ransomware-Rollback-in-Malwarebytes-Endpoint-Detection-and-Response)\nof off-line backups. With online, or otherwise connected backups you run the chance of your\nbackup files being encrypted as well, which makes the whole point of having them moot.\nPlease note that the roll-back technologies are reliant on the activity of the processes\nmonitoring your systems. And the danger exists that these processes will be on the target list\nof the ransomware gang. Meaning that these processes will be shut down once they gain\naccess to your network.\n\nAs you may have noticed this is a very sophisticated and highly targeted type of\nransomware. Which means that, given the ransom demands, most of the affected companies\nwill have a dedicated cyber- security department. It is imperative that this staff is alert on the\nearly warning signs of these attacks which may be indicated by breach attempts. At later\nstages more disruptive actions may be taken, such as disabled security software, dropped\nfiles, and deleted backups\n\n\n-----\n\n[Unlike other ransomware operators Evil Corp does not exfiltrate stolen data and publish or](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2020/05/maze-the-ransomware-that-introduced-an-extra-twist/)\n[auction the data that belong to “clients” that are unwilling to pay the ransom.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2020/06/sodinokibi-ransomware-gang-auctions-off-stolen-data/)\n\n## Infection details\n\nOne of the methods found to date is the usage of fake software update alerts embedded in\nexisting websites.\n\n_Code_\n\n_can be inserted on existing websites showing misleading information to prompt users and get_\n_them to run malware._\nThe malware from these websites is a penetration testing and exploration kit designed to\ncreate a foothold and gather information about the network. Historically Evil Corp has\ntargeted file servers, database services, virtual machines, and cloud environments.\n\nOnce the exploration phase has completed the gang will drop the ransomware on the\ncompromised systems.\n\nThe ransomware itself is custom built for each client so there is nothing to be gained by\ndoing a full analysis. The attacks do have some commonalities though which we will discuss\nhere.\n\nDeletes shadow copies, which are the default backups made by the Windows OS.\nThe main executable for the ransomware is copied to the system folder and gets\nelevated permissions\nA service is created that runs during encryption.\nDuring encryption the encrypted files are renamed, and the ransom notes are created.\nA log file is created that lists the number of targeted files, the number of encrypted files,\nand the number of files that were not encrypted due to access rights issues.\nThe service is stopped and deleted.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Overview\n\nWastedLocker has been actively deployed since May 2020.\nEvil Corp behind: this group previously associated to the Dridex malware\nand BitPaymer aka IEcrypt aka FriedEx aka WastedLocker.\nEvil Corp has been using WastedLocker to request ransoms in the range of millions of\nUSD, with some demands going above $10 million.\nWastedLocker replaces BitPaymer in the group’s operations.\nTechnically, WastedLocker does not have much in common with BitPaymer\nThe ransomware name is derived from the filename it creates which includes an\nabbreviation of the victim’s name and the string ‘wasted’.\nEncrypted files extension is set according to the targeted organisations name along\nwith the prefix wasted\nExample: test.txt.orgnamewasted (encrypted data)\nand test.txt.orgnamewasted_info (ransomware note)\nNo data theft and no leak site.\nEach ransomware victim has a custom build configured or compiled for them.\nNote contains: Protonmail and Tutanota email domains, as well\nas Eclipso and Airmail email addresses. The email addresses listed in the ransom\nmessages are numeric – usually 5 digit numbers.\n\nInfection highlights\n\nDelete shadow copies\nCopy the ransomware binary file to %windir%\\system32 and take ownership of it\n(takeown.exe /F filepath) and reset the ACL permissions. In other cases an Alternate\nData Stream (ADS) is used as a means to run the ransomware processes.\nCreate and run a service. The service is deleted once the encryption process is\ncompleted.\n\n## IOC’s\n\n*wasted and *wasted_info filenames for encrypted files and the ransom notes\n\nBasic layout of the content of the ransom note:\n\n*ORGANIZATION_NAME*\n\nYOUR NETWORK IS ENCRYPTED NOW\n\nUSE *EMAIL1* | *EMAIL2* TO GET THE PRICE FOR YOUR DATA\n\nDO NOT GIVE THIS EMAIL TO 3RD PARTIES\n\nDO NOT RENAME OR MOVE THE FILE\n\nTHE FILE IS ENCRYPTED WITH THE FOLLOWING KEY:\n\n[begin_key]*[end_key]\n\nKEEP IT\n\nThe email addresses are usually numeric and 5 digits, one at Protonmail and the other at\nAirmail, but we have also seen Tutanota and Eclipso email addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malwarebytes detection\n\nMalwarebytes detects WastedLocker ransomware as Ransom.BinADS.\n\nStay safe everyone!\n\n\n-----",
