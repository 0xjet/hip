An example of](https://www.corero.com/resources/ddos-attack-types/mirai-botnet-ddos-attack.html)\n[these attacks is the one targeting GitHub in February 2018, forcing the website to go offline](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/02/the-worlds-largest-ddos-attack-took-github-offline-for-less-than-tens-minutes/)\nfor approximately 10 minutes.\n\nIn researching the current DDoS ecosystem we find threat actors from different regions\ndisplaying different motivations. Chinese threat actors in particular have predominantly\ndeployed DDoS attacks in their cyber campaigns, and China has emerged as having one of\n[the highest rates of DDoS attacks.](https://securelist.com/ddos-report-in-q3-2018/88617/)\n\nIn this blog we will discuss the current state of a well-known Chinese threat actor group\nknown as ChinaZ, notorious for targeting Windows and Linux systems with DDoS botnets\n[since November 2014.](http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2015/01/mmd-0030-2015-new-elf-malware-on.html)\n\n[We will explain how we first came across ChinaZ, along with the various methods employed](http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2015/08/mmd-0039-2015-chinaz-made-new-malware.html)\nto discover more of the group’s servers. Additionally, we will analyze the types of files\nhosted on the servers and conclude with a technical analysis highlighting potential\nconnections that could relate various Chinese actors in the current DDoS landscape such\nas [Nitol,](https://www.netskope.com/blog/nitol-botnet-makes-resurgence-evasive-sandbox-analysis-technique) [MrBlack and some minor relations to Iron Tiger APT. These relationships will be](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/mrblack-malware-botnet/)\ndiscussed in the technical analysis section.\n\n**Initial ChinaZ Discovery via Honeypot Hit**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the last few months we have observed a higher volume of attacks from Billgates, a DDoS\nbotnet attributed to ChinaZ, a well-known Chinese threat actor notorious for deploying a\nseries of botnets primarily targeting Linux systems.\n\n[#BillGates hosted at 204[.]13[.]67[.]244](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BillGates?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#HFS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HFS?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@malwrhunterteam](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@w0lfvan](https://twitter.com/w0lfvan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[@malwaremustd1e](https://twitter.com/malwaremustd1e?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/ICgPqbBODU](https://t.co/ICgPqbBODU)\n\n[— Nacho Sanmillan (@ulexec) November 22, 2018](https://twitter.com/ulexec/status/1065743509376954368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nChinaZ was fairly active in 2018 based on previous hits that were encountered in our\nhoneypots. An example of an attack vector via SSH/Telnet bruteforce employed by ChinaZ\ncan be seen in the following session log from one of our honeypots:\n\nThe downloader bash script seems to be fairly simple in logic by changing directories from\n/root to /tmp once it detected that the dropped implant could not be executed after several\nattempts changing its file permissions.\n\nOnce we accessed where the script was trying to download its corresponding files we found\nthat there were files being hosted in a Chinese Http File Server (HFS) panel. The following\nis a screenshot of this panel:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe discovered the server was online for less than 24 hours, and that all of the files were\nuploaded on that same day. We decided to observe this and other servers and conduct a\ntracking investigation with the intention to collect all of the information we could about the\nbotnet infrastructure.\n\n**Observing ChinaZ**\n\nChinaZ is known to use Chinese Http File Server (HFS) instances, and unlike other major\nDDoS botnets such as Mirai, ChinaZ operates mostly on Windows Servers. In this particular\nHFS server we see various hosted files. The two Linux prefixed files are both regular\nBillgates builds. We can confirm this based on code reused from other samples:\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/5567e542-c2a1-4cb8-a7f7-f69b9d154ad1](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/5567e542-c2a1-4cb8-a7f7-f69b9d154ad1)\n\n[https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/5442438f-fe2e-478a-bbbe-0ee6dde39df7](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/5442438f-fe2e-478a-bbbe-0ee6dde39df7)\n\nSince BillGates is a well-known botnet and there are plenty of well-written technical analysis\n[articles about the botnet and its relations to ChinaZ, we have decided to not cover its](http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2015/08/mmd-0039-2015-chinaz-made-new-malware.html)\ntechnical analysis for the sake of simplicity. These builds are default BillGates instances.\nBoth of these instances share the same CNC domain which is the following:\n\nAmong the hosted files in the HFS server we can also find a PE executable labeled as\nBX.exe, which is a Gh0st RAT variant.\n\nFurthermore, this Gh0st RAT instance decodes the same CNC address:\n\n\n-----\n\nSince both BillGates and the Gh0st RAT instances found in the initially discovered HFS\npanel shared the same CNC, we can associate both implants to be components of a single\nbotnet targeting both Linux and Windows systems. This same scenario was presented by\n[Avast researchers as the Chinese Chicken DDoS botnets by exposing a series of multi-](https://www.botconf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-2.10-Chinese-Chicken-Multiplatform-DDoS-Botnets.pdf)\nplatform Chinese DDoS tools.\n\nAfter one day threat actors behind this botnet updated the HFS panel by uploading two\nChinaZ.DDoSClient samples compiled for x86 and x86_64 systems accordingly.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following is a code reuse analysis of these new samples:\n\n[https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/6a088a5e-4630-427b-b8de-806e633a1ccc](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/6a088a5e-4630-427b-b8de-806e633a1ccc)\n\nDDoSClient malware is a DDoS client known to be leveraged by ChinaZ. As an interesting\nfact about the progression of this threat actor group, at some point in time the source code\n[of this client was hosted in GitHub, although DDosClient was originally code of ChinaZ.](http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2015/06/the-elf-chinaz-reloaded.html)\nMalwareMustDie exposed this source code and the actor’s identity. The actor behind this\nclient was a student hired by ChinaZ.\n\nFurthermore, we can find a compressed archive labeled as ‘Black Wolf Linux Blasting V4.0’\nin Chinese among the different binaries hosted in the HFS server. Inside this RAR file we\nencounter the following files:\n\n\n-----\n\nMost interestingly, the contents of this compressed file appear to be a Chinese DDoS tool:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe tool enables users to edit which files will be used on deployment, and other related\nconfigurations such as the time out. We observed this specific DDoS tool advertised in a\nrange of Chinese forums:\n\nIf we analyze one of the scripts inside the zip file and compare it with our initial honeypot hit\nlog, we can assume that the attack was deployed using this tool:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe are not sure whether this Chinese DDoS tool was distributed by ChinaZ, or if the group\npurchased this tool in order to use it in its campaigns.\n\nThe server was online for one more day before it went offline. This behavior suggests that\nactors behind this botnet may have migrated to a different CNC server, they were\nperforming some internal management, or that it was merely part of the way they operate\nsince we have seen this same behavior tracking their other servers.\n\n**Hunting for Additional ChinaZ Servers**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe decided to look up the specific CNC domain name seen in the BillGates and Gh0st RAT\ninstances found in the initial HFS server, to see if this domain had multiple resolutions in\norder to find more potential servers linked to this botnet. When we searched the domain on\nRiskIQ we found the following:\n\nAll of the shown IPs in the previous screenshot denote a server that would resolve to “ak74.top”, the CNC address seen in the first HFS server. Based on these resolutions we were\nable to find other panels like the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe instantly recognize the same pattern in terms of the naming convention as well as the\ntypes of files that were hosted in this HFS server. In contrast with the previous HFS server,\nthis server is only hosting Windows binaries and a zip file.\n\nThe 7z compressed file contained the following files:\n\nThese files appear to be composing a Port Scanner tool written in python that could also be\nused to deploy DDoS attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the screenshot above we can observe an executable responsible for the main TCP/SYN\nflood, and the script used to deploy DDoS attacks.\n\nWe also used Shodan to hunt for more operative ChinaZ HFS servers. We did this by\nfiltering Shodan’s query for the appropriate service and country.\n\n\n-----\n\nLeveraging Shodan we were able to find many other ChinaZ linked servers, in which we\ncollected additional relevant samples. After we discovered several ChinaZ servers and we\ncollected their correspondent hosted files, we found interesting correlations and\nrelationships which we will discuss in the next section.\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nThroughout the investigation we found several interesting facts among the artifacts we\ncollected and analyzed. The following is a brief summary of our findings:\n\n**Gh0st RAT Clients:**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Gh0st RAT clients we discovered among several HFS servers all appear to be modified\ninstances of Gh0st RAT that share notable characteristics. These Gh0st RAT variants are\nfound hosted in different HFS servers with the names BX.exe or shadow.exe.\n\nWe can observe similarities in different functions from the open-source version hosted in\n[GitHub. The following is a brief comparison of both files’ WinMain function:](https://github.com/sincoder/gh0st)\n\nRegarding this Gh0st RAT variant, if we take a closer look we observe that it has similarities\n[with the Gh0st RAT instance deployed on Operation PZCHAO by Iron Tiger APT, an APT](https://download.bitdefender.com/resources/files/News/CaseStudies/study/185/Bitdefender-Business-2017-WhitePaper-PZCHAO-crea2452-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf)\ngroup with also alleged Chinese origin. The RC4 key used to decrypt the CNC is the same\nas the one used in the PZCHAO campaign, “Mother360”.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on a Bitdefender blog post about operation PZCHAO, this same cryptographic key\nwas not only used to decode the malware’s CNC addresses but also was the key used to\ndecrypt traffic between the client and the CNC.\n\nWe also see code similarities from both Gh0st RAT variants apart from the used RC4\nfunction. The following code similarity comparisons are portions of the main function:\n\nAlthough these two Gh0st RATs may share common code, it is important to understand how\nto interpret these similarities. ChinaZ has been known to employ DDoS botnets in its\ncampaigns as previously mentioned. Usually APT groups do not rely on DDoS attacks.\nThese similarities may not necessarily correlate ChinaZ and Iron Tiger APT, but instead it\nmay be evidence of the existence of a common Gh0st RAT variant shared within the\nChinese community, by having the possibility to have ‘Mother360’ as one of the default\n\n\n-----\n\nhard-coded keys. The reason for this interpretation is based on the fact that APT groups are\nrarely involved with DDoS operations since the mere thought of correlating these two\nmodels does not seem practical and the probability unlikely.\n\n**Infected Compressed Files with Nitol Artifacts:**\n\nAmong some of the HFS panels found, we observed that some of the panels were hosting\nDDoS tools.\n\nInside these compressed files we can see that they contain varying components. However,\namong all of the files found in these compressed files, the most notable file was a DLL\nlabelled as lpk.dll that appeared in every hosted compressed archive that we found. This\n[DLL has been known to be hijacked in the past by Nitol, a Chinese DDoS botnet targeting](http://www.edison-newworld.com/2017/07/analysis-of-nitol.html)\nWindows systems that propagated infected trusted software by exploiting the Windows\nModule Loading process. This was achieved by placing a malicious lpk.dll within the file\nsystem meant to take precedence against the genuine lpk.dll on load-time since this DLL is\nknown to be loaded in every process by being a component of Microsoft Language Pack.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can confirm this lpk.dll instance is the Nitol DLL from code reuse:\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/da7374a4-1574-4986-aeda-c0ce567e4a4d](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/da7374a4-1574-4986-aeda-c0ce567e4a4d)\n\nThis finding may lead to different interpretations. One may directly link Nitol to ChinaZ and\nargue that they are hosting infected compressed archives as a way to spread and\ncompromise systems. However, it is known that the Nitol botnet was seized by Microsoft in\n[2012, although there are reports that document Nitol activity from 2016 onwards.](https://www.netskope.com/blog/nitol-botnet-makes-resurgence-evasive-sandbox-analysis-technique)\n\nTherefore, we can interpret this finding from a different standpoint, and raise the possibility\nthat actors behind this botnet are operating on infected physical Windows systems, and\nconsequently deploying malware infected with previous malware belonging to older\ncampaigns, therefore indirectly linking Nitol and ChinaZ.\n\nIn addition, as a fact supporting this theory was that after analysis, this specific DLL failed to\nconnect to its correspondent CNC, but at some point in the infection chain a parite file\ninfector was also dropped from both, the Nitol DLL implants as well as from the hosted\nwindows Gh0st RATs.\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/47f52891-e2a3-4a9c-96b6-8184ce1c2e87](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/47f52891-e2a3-4a9c-96b6-8184ce1c2e87)\n\nIt is known that in 2010 there was a strong infection wave of Chinese servers that are still\noperative deploying infected malware. This may be why we can find parite drops from files\nhosted in these servers:\n\n\n-----\n\nI m pretty sure that it came from the worm wave in 2010. A lot of chinese server are\nstill infected. They build some malware (like gh0st) on pwned RDP/SMB servers and\nthe builded malware is \"file infected\" by ramnit\n\nYou can also found some Virut/Parite infection 🙂\n\n[— Benkøw moʞuƎq (@benkow_) February 8, 2018](https://twitter.com/benkow_/status/961713159630393346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nIt should be noted how minimal effort is shown from the actors to maintain a clean\ndevelopment environment for their newer malware campaigns, if the theory explained\nabove is indeed true.\n\n**Further Connections between ChinaZ and Nitol:**\n\n[MrBlack is an IoT botnet also known to have Windows variants. As documented by](https://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-botnet-soho-router.html)\n[MalwareMustDie, MrBlack is the simplified version of AES.DDoS, an ELF DDoS tool with](http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2014/09/reversing-arm-architecture-elf-elknot.html)\nChinese origin that was on circulation before ChinaZ was ever established. Therefore, there\nare not direct correlations between MrBlack and ChinaZ.\n\nHowever, we spotted MrBlack samples being hosted along with known ChinaZ malware. In\naddition, if we analyze the results on string reuse of MrBlack samples, often we can see a\nhigh volume of strings reused from ChinaZ malware.\n\nBelow is a code reuse analysis of the different files found in the following HFS server:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following is the code reuse analysis of one of the hosted linux files, both of them being\nChinaZ.DdosClient:\n\n[https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/ab5e016c-288b-433e-aae4-a0120e55509b](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/ab5e016c-288b-433e-aae4-a0120e55509b)\n\nThe following is a code reuse analysis of the hosted windows binary demonstrating that the\nfile is a Win32/MrBlack instance:\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/9ebd8c3d-2995-4bee-b5a7-6a8ae97854eb](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/9ebd8c3d-2995-4bee-b5a7-6a8ae97854eb)\n\n[We can see that this instance of MrBlack shares 10 genes with ServStart, a trojan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Win32%2FNitol)\nassociated with the Nitol family. After analysis of these 10 genes we observed that this\ninstance of MrBlack shares the exact SYN flood function as in the ServStart instance.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can observe that there are slight variations present throughout the code.\n\nMost of the function is identical, specifically the main flood loop:\n\n\n-----\n\nTo reinforce this connection between MrBlack and ServStart, we discovered the following\npanel:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this panel we found two instances of Linux/MrBlack along with seven instances of a\nvariant of ServStart. We have identified the MrBlack instances based on code reuse:\n\n[https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/59ee92b0-3641-4ae0-a04e-7a4e0d21f5ce](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/59ee92b0-3641-4ae0-a04e-7a4e0d21f5ce)\n\n\n-----\n\nRegarding the ServStart variants, we can see that they share a substantial amount of code\nwith respect to previous ServStart variants:\n\n[https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/5fa8efdc-49e7-41e9-bc69-173c23246fb1](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/5fa8efdc-49e7-41e9-bc69-173c23246fb1)\n\nIt is important to note that these newer ServStart variants have a recent compilation time\nstamp, and it was only submitted to VirusTotal one week ago from today:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found several nearly identical functions reused from previous variants of ServStart. The\nfollowing is an example of one of these common functions.\n\n\n-----\n\nWithin the common code we found exact code fragments like the one below:\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, we found common code, although there are noticeable differences\nbetween the new and old ServStart versions. An example of this is shown in the screenshot\nbelow:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe relationships described above validate the previous linkage between Nitol and ChinaZ,\nwhich could insinuate that these two threat actor groups may be related or may have\ncollaborated together. So far we have gathered the following links between them:\n\nThese two groups share the same goals in their campaigns with an emphasis on the\ndeployment of DDoS botnets.\nBoth groups have alleged Chinese origins.\nA range of ChinaZ’s Windows clients have been infected by old Nitol artifacts.\nThese two families share relevant code with one another such as DDoS flood\nimplementations.\nNew ServStart variants have been spotted being hosted alongside with MrBlack Linux\ninstances.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have covered how we have tracked ChinaZ and collected some up to date information\nabout this threat actor group. We have found potential connections that could relate various\nChinese actors in the current DDoS landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\nChinaZ is hosting instances of Linux and Windows builds of MrBlack, and Windows\nversions have shown code reuse connections with old ServStart variants. Furthermore, we\nhave spotted newer versions of ServStart being hosted along with MrBlack Linux instances.\nTherefore there may be a relationship between MrBlack and ServStart actors, indicating a\npotential relationship between ChinaZ and Nitol families.\n\nIn addition, ChinaZ Windows components have been seen infected with Nitol components,\nsuggesting that these actors may have been operating in servers already infected with Nitol.\nThis enforces the hypothesis that there may be deeper relationships between these two\nthreat groups. ChinaZ has always been a relatively active threat actor group that is slowly\nevolving in sophistication even though it is not making many changes to its overall\ninfrastructure from early stages. To reflect the most relevant relationships discussed in this\nblog we have decided to present them with the following diagram:\n\n**IOCs**\n\nChinaZ Gh0st RAT variant with ‘Mother360’ key:\n\nA9c54bdba780bcdc34f15b62f0ac1da8bcf4d65b4587d0d95bd2a9b5be5dfee6\n\n908d817f81f9276f5afad1a33a7e2de7566fd5c967ad95782a4d904ca0e5efdd\n\n9e24ba7304ae7c4f153fa8e97d2e6779d0e4377cee270b83d20d91afef7fe6f4\n\nIron Tiger APT gh0st RAT:\n\nD4262bbfe779d18b83b950bb993d3d46154bf1da5a4868ff6fa3e54c167eed71\n\n\n-----\n\nBillGates:\n\n92c191c41bcc701de5d633a0edb8cab6085ea13ede079651a2cc4a4ae54b29bb\n\n6fd7aab3faabd5f071d1bc9bb039146c01acf67d941c24e99813b1375114e908\n\nInfected ChinaZ DDoS tools with Nitol:\nB883b32264bcafd0c5ede5ff7399388feb51dbdf183f7ad52024c08cd221d574\n\n23c69edc4695f6c2184484682757f024f0e20573dba599030fde1cdaeae9915c\n\nChinaZ.DDoSClient:\n\n80952e211eb98773909f0f3e7ce783ce2f410327058a4760efad2ff0dbebcb88\n\nD97ffba4169df8b206f6fc588ba594e84539b321fae9247723d6b42940116fa5\n\nA8d0928098cc43e7b9e8ba3b03507d342489dea832816dfc083c356b346f8a3d\n\n7495be154047e2c3c3b9735d61c6f1256eea776eb536e42f2ea76d5c11fc7f84\n\nWin32/MrBlack:\n\nD793e629df1b73b054f763106fcfedaaafadd8a0919192fc7d1925752a1d64fe\n\nLinux/MrBlack:\n\nF025b6d531e7dcba68a309636f622fbe8ee212d457c9cc00e7bf339dca65fec2\n\nFb69075f4383f3537af46d2098b3bcdcb7c1bdd6896c580cd9ead6f56fb5219c\n\nServStart:\n\n4f4f24f0333ed6e8883971129f216fab608b6e4d0c97c58a2b3b6a1106c77bf7\n\n7db53e95a1339d4d023d61087907a5b07bf6720a2dd88b12882a2c5c201a92ea\n\n7e6a2448e06a1d97ff317a5dc4ed969cef077a3568fd214cbe61854b7ff1a6d1\n\nNew ServStart:\n\n774af1499fa1558d0b31272b84b4fbbfcc6fea578898325610524aa3853b669d\n\nE3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\n\nD104daec5e990de0233efdde8747a1d829c90b7b9a2169a7bcf5744fa1d95e6e\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ignacio Sanmillan**\nNacho is a security researcher specializing in reverse engineering and malware analysis.\nNacho plays a key role in Intezer\\'s malware hunting and investigation operations, analyzing\nand documenting new undetected threats.
