    "plain_text": "# “Page Not Found”: REvil Darknet Services Offline After Attack Last Weekend\n\n**[darkowl.com/blog-content/page-not-found-revil-darknet-services-offline-after-attack-last-weekend](https://www.darkowl.com/blog-content/page-not-found-revil-darknet-services-offline-after-attack-last-weekend)**\n\nOctober 20, 2021\n\nLast weekend, REvil’s “Happy Blog” went offline for the second time in less than six months.\nInstead of the blog Tor service simply not responding to an HTTP request, the page instead\ndisplayed the default 404 error displayed by the nginx webserver. According to a REvil\nrepresentative the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) organization’s Tor domain was\n“hijacked” using the private keys of the domain held by REvil’s previously public-face\n“Unknown” (who also operates as “UNKN”).\n\nDarkOwl reviewed the group’s history and latest posts about the hijacking and determined\nthat since returning, REvil’s reputation was in jeopardy and many darknet users and RaaS\ncommunity members suspected the group had been compromised by the FBI.\n\n## “This Page Is Not Found”\n\nLast weekend, Tor users anticipating to connect to the legendary Happy Blog hosted by the\ninfamous REvil RaaS gang, received the default 04 error page for nginx webservers on\nFedora, indicating the Tor onion services run by the REvil operation were compromised and\ncorrupted instead of simply taken offline by disconnecting the servers from the network.\n\nThe page read:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n nginx error! The page you are looking for is not found. Website Administrator\nSomething has triggered missing webpage on your website. This is the default 404\nerror page for nginx that is distributed with Fedora. It is located\n/usr/share/nginx/html/404.html You should customize this error page for your own\nsite or edit the error_page directive in the nginx configuration file\n/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.\"\n\n## An Insider Job?\n\n```\nIn a post titled, “У REvil угнали домены” [Translated: REvil’s domains were stolen”],\nREvil’s current spokesperson – the persona behind the moniker 0_neday on the darknet\nunderground forum XSS – stated the server had compromised using UNKN’s (a.k.a.\nUnknown and REvil’s previous representative) private Tor service keys. “To be precise they\n_deleted the path to my hidden service in the torrc file and raised their own so I would go_\n_there”._\n\n_0_neday went on to further state that the group presumed Unknown had “died” earlier in the_\nsummer, when the group went offline in mid-July shortly after the Kaseya supply chain\nattack successfully encrypted thousands of networks when its ransomware spread through\na software auto-update.\n\nThere are a number of conflicting theories why REvil disappeared less than a month later.\n\n## REvil’s Mysterious Disappearance in July\n\nREvil’s services mysteriously shutoff the Tuesday following a late “Friday phone-call”\nbetween US President Biden and Russian President Vladmir Putin, during which REvil and\nthe global ransomware epidemic was reportedly a subject of their conversation. The\ninformation security community has theorized any number of reasons the services\ndisappeared after this call:\n\n**a.  The US launched an offensive cyber campaign directly against REvil – possibly using**\nsophisticated intelligence or USCYBERCOM resources – and brought the gang’s services\noffline.\n\n**b.  President Putin directed REvil to shut down their operations in response to the**\nconversation he had directly with Biden, where Biden stated he would hold Russia\nresponsible for aiding and abetting the threat actor’s actions on Russian soil.\n\n**c.  REvil was feeling the “heat” and international pressure after a series of high-profile**\nattacks, some of which included US military targets. Perhaps the group’s operators\nvoluntarily “took a break” from their ransomware operation.\n\n**d.  REvil leader, UNKN “exit scammed” emptying the gang and their affiliate’s**\ncryptocurrency accounts and disabled their Tor services using their administrator privileges.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Reporting from the Washington Post suggested the US was not behind the July shutdown,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ransomware-fbi-revil-decryption-key/2021/09/21/4a9417d0-f15f-11eb-a452-4da5fe48582d_story.html)\nas some had hypothesized, citing government sources. No “seizure banner” was evident\nwhen the Tor services went offline as has historically been the case when law enforcement\ntake down darknet marketplaces. The FBI’s Director, Christopher Wray testified in front of\nCongress stating how they do not make decisions unilaterally but work directly with allies\nand other agencies on such matters. The FBI was strongly criticized for their delay in\nproviding a universal decrpytor key for the REvil ransomware after the Kaseya attack they\nhad allegedly obtained.\n\n“These are complex . . . decisions, designed to create maximum impact, and that\ntakes time in going against adversaries where we have to marshal resources not just\naround the country but all over the world.”\n\n— FBI Director Testimony\nThe FBI provided the key to Kaseya nineteen (19) days after their networks were\ncompromised and a week after the REvil infrastructure went dark. The key was reportedly\nobtained through direct access to the servers of the REvil operation.\n\nIn mid-September, BitDefender announced they had developed a “free universal decrpytor”\nfor the REvil/Sodin ransomware strain in circulation prior to July 13th. According to\nBitDefender’s blog and social media posts, the decrpytor was “created in collaboration with\na trusted law enforcement partner.”\n\nThis announcement was the source of many a controversial discussion across darknet\nmalware forums.\n\n## REvil’s Return in September\n\nAccording to the DarkOwl Vision darknet data records, REvil’s Happy Blog returned after\ntheir summer hiatus the first week in September 2021. Shortly after the blog was back\nonline, new victims were quickly announced.\n\nSurprisingly, in early October, DarkOwl analysts observed the REvil team sharing a link to\nRAMP – another ransomware focused forum – announcing that REvil was active on the\nnew Groove ransomware backed forum. RAMP, hosted on a Tor domain previously owned\nand operated by the Babuk RaaS gang, emerged after many darknet underground forums\n“banned” ransomware related discussions last summer.\n\nThis behavior was noteworthy as REvil had historically not shown any affiliation with other\nRaaS groups, making their endorsement of RAMP unusual to many in the darknet.\n\n## Complex Cast of Characters\n\n**Unknown/UNKN**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Unknown/UNKN was the original spokesperson for the REvil gang when they first branded_**\nas Sodinokibi in early 2019. They spoke with measured cadence and subtle humor. One of\ntheir last posts was early July after the Kaseya attack, where they simply shared a video of\na typical older, angry Russian gentleman.\n\nThe admin from XSS banned Unknown’s forum account on July 8th, the week in between\nthe Kaseya attack and the REvil servers were shutdown in July. It’s unclear if the\njustification was retribution for ransomware (as the topic was banned from the forum at that\ntime), or the admin knew something else was awry.\n\nIn May, Unknown announced they were going to leave XSS, have limited activity on their\naccount on exploit.in, and move their discussions to “private.”\n\nAt the time of their account ban, Unknown had 0.0022 Bitcoin in escrow on XSS.\n\n\n-----\n\n**0_neday**\n\n**_0_neday emerged as a representative of REvil on XSS after users evilcore and_**\n_Lockbitsupp challenged the origination of the REvil decryptor key released by Bitdefendor_\non the public forum. They created their account earlier this month on October 5, 2021,\ndepositing a significant amount of Bitcoin (i.e. account value of 1 BTC in escrow or\napproximately $50,800 USD on 10/5/2021) to legitimize their status. On October 12th,\n_0_neday posted on evilcore’s XSS member profile, “my boss agreed to offer you a 10%_\ndiscount” suggesting 0_neday is a front for someone much more authoritative in the REvil\ngang. This contrasts with a claim they made a few days later that only he and Unknown had\nprivate keys to the Tor onion service domains. As of 19 October, 0_neday indicated they\nwere leaving the forum, signing their last post with\n```\n[Translated] “Good luck everyone, I’m off.”\n\n```\n**evilcore**\n\n**_evilcore is a relatively long-time user of XSS with registration on the forum in late 2018._**\nThey claim they have no connection to any ransomware gang, but vocal in criticizing the\noperations of the groups, especially most recently REvil. They posted a comment to\n_0_neday’s thread this week about REvil’s domains getting stolen suggesting the leak of the_\ndecryption key was intentional and the entire infrastructure was merged and not\ncompromised by Unknown as indicated, with a bit of “told you so” attitude and stark warning\nfor users not to get fooled.\n```\n[Translated] \"Ahaha)))))\nfuck, I told you that they merged the entire infrastructure))))) and you didn't\nbelieve. I'm not a competitor and I don't care, they just really leaked the keys!\npeople don't get fooled.\"\n\n```\nevilcore have been vocal against the legitimacy of REvil since they reappeared in\nSeptember and the story that supposed a REvil developer “misclicked” accidently releasing\nthe decryptor key. In a comment on a thread titled, “Атака вымогателей на больницу\n**привела к гибели ребенка” [Translated: “The ransomware attack on the hospital led to**\nthe death of a child”], evilcore closes with [Translated: “where is UNKN?”] after claiming the\nFBI likely had control of REvil’s admin panel.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n[Translated] \"0_neday do the rebranding:) and I can bet on 5 bits, but the point is)\nthe conversation was about backdoor keys, I gave evidence that the backdoor key had\nnothing to do with it, it started about fictional gspch misklik checkout and - there\nit was already clear that the FBI had taken the admin panel.\nWhere is UNKN going???\"\n\n```\nThe controversial October 12 thread continued with bickering between directly between\n_0_neday and evilcore, with LockBit’s forum representative, LockBitSupp, and forum users,_\n_1MG, and ev4ng3liya, chiming in including critiques of REvil’s desperation to draw in_\naffiliates with a 90/10 percent split – unheard of in the RaaS industry. evilcore eventually\neven accused 0_neday of being FBI.\n\n**LockBitSupp**\n\n**_LockBitSupp is competitive RaaS gang, LockBit 2.0’s public representative on the XSS_**\nforum. This alias is also active for the same group on another darknet forum, exploit.in and\nhighly critical of REvil, stating they had recruited many REvil affiliates due to their lousy\npartner programs (PP). On exploit, they added lengthy posts with concerns that REvil had\nbeen compromised by the FBI and that the current REvil coders and affiliates needed to be\nchecked to verify their allegiance to the RaaS industry:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n[Translated] \"In connection with the above, I propose to check the coders who are\nnow allegedly running the REvil affiliate program, for example:\n- so that they somehow showed the locker source codes through the same TeamViewer or\nAnyDesk and made a test build from the source, providing this build to the public\nfor reverse and comparison with old builds;\n- so that the coders show the history of correspondence with the former management;\n- any other evidence that will allow us to verify the coders and show that they are\nnot undercover FBI agents.\nVerification can be entrusted to any independent and authoritative people on the\nforums, for example, those who do reviews of malware.\"\n\n```\nThey concluded their post with the realization that if the FBI has infiltrated the REvil RaaS\ngang or their affiliates, that the damage to the advertisers was far less than the suffering\ncaused to “our cozy and warm community.”\n\n## REvil brand trustworthiness continues to decline\n\nIn late September, darknet forum users began expressing concerns over REvil’s\nunpredictable and scandalous behavior. One exploit user, Signature, claimed they had\nevidence that REvil had installed a “cryptobackdoor” which allowed REvil operators to take\nover negotiations between their affiliates and their victims, usurping ransomware payments\n\n\n-----\n\n[thereby scamming money from their affiliates. It s unclear how long this backdoor existed –](https://www.cybertalk.org/2021/10/06/revil-ransomware-gang-scams-its-own-affiliates/)\nsome researchers state the backdoor was present for months, but removed from the\nSeptember codebase.\n\nSignature had launched a previous dispute on the forum with REvil’s UNKN in May 2021,\nwhen they claimed they had been contracted to provide network access to REvil victims,\nQuanta and Apex, and was never paid their 7 Million USD for the work provided. The thread\nresulted in a gross airing of RaaS dirty laundry to the public with private chats from qTox\nshared on the forum thread.\n\nUp until last weekend, REvil had been active on the same Tor v3 domain address for over\n22 months, excluding their summer vacation and active in the ransomware market since\nApril 2019. Most RaaS groups change addresses regularly and even rebrand with new\nlogos and aliases to maintain their operational security.\n\nEvilCorp RaaS gang’’s representative on the XSS forum suggested REvil should have\nrebranded a long time ago. In the most recent thread of the REvil domain hijacking, user\nKrypt0n, admittedly late to the conversation, stated it was stupid for REvil to return in\nSeptember to the same Tor domain address with the same keys. They added there was no\nway for REvil to restore their reputation and status achieved by UNKN.\n\nDespite the fact elite hacker forum members can easily spot law enforcement and rippers,\nREvil’s brand is renowned and other copycat services will likely emerge in their likeness. In\nNovember last year, DarkOwl detected a non-REvil related domain advertising they were\nthe “REvil Team” and were offering to sell Managed.com’s website hosting company’s\ndatabase.\n\nThe REvil imposters included a protonmail.com e-mail address for contacting them and the\ndomain was online for barely a month.\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkOwl will continue to monitor this situation as it develops.\n\n**_Curious about something you’ve read?_** **_[Contact us to learn how darknet data applies](https://www.darkowl.com/contact-us)_**\n**_to your use case_**\n\n\n-----",
