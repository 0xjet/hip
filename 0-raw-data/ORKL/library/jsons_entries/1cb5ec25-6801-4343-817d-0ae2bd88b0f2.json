For example, as users’ work environments diversify, adversaries are\nbusy acquiring the TTPs to infiltrate systems. Recently, we reported to our Threat\nIntelligence Portal customers a similar malware framework that internally we called\nMATA. The MATA malware framework possesses several components, such as loader,\norchestrator and plugins. This comprehensive framework is able to target Windows,\nLinux and macOS operating systems.\n\nThe first artefacts we found relating to MATA were used around April 2018. After that,\nthe actor behind this advanced malware framework used it aggressively to infiltrate\ncorporate entities around the world. We identified several victims from our telemetry and\nfigured out the purpose of this malware framework.\n\n## Windows version of MATA\n\nThe Windows version of MATA consists of several components. According to our\ntelemetry, the actor used a loader malware to load the encrypted next-stage payload.\nWe’re not sure that the loaded payload is the orchestrator malware, but almost all victims\nhave the loader and orchestrator on the same machine.\n\n**_Component of the Windows version of MATA_**\n\n### Loader\n\n\n-----\n\nThis loader takes a hardcoded hex-string, converts it to binary and AES-decrypts it in\norder to obtain the path to the payload file. Each loader has a hard-coded path to load the\nencrypted payload. The payload file is then AES-decrypted and loaded.\n\nFrom the loader malware found on one of the compromised victims, we discovered that\nthe parent process which executes the loader malware is the\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe” process. The WmiPrvSE.exe process is\n“WMI Provider Host process”, and it usually means the actor has executed this loader\nmalware from a remote host to move laterally. Therefore, we assess that the actor used\nthis loader to compromise additional hosts in the same network.\n\n### Orchestrator and plugins\n\nWe discovered the orchestrator malware in the lsass.exe process on victims’ machines.\nThis orchestrator malware loads encrypted configuration data from a registry key and\ndecrypts it with the AES algorithm. Unless the registry value exists, the malware uses\nhard-coded configuration data. The following is a configuration value example from one\norchestrator malware sample:\n\n**Victim ID** Random 24-bit\nnumber\n\n**Internal version number** 3.1.1 (0x030101)\n\n**Timeout** 20 minutes\n\n**C2 addresses** 108.170.31[.]81:443\n192.210.239[.]122:443\n\n111.90.146[.]105:443\n\n\n**Disk path or URL of plugin (up to 15) to be loaded on**\n**start**\n\n\nNot used in this\nmalware\n\n\nThe orchestrator can load 15 plugins at the same time. There are three ways to load them:\n\nDownload the plugin from the specified HTTP or HTTPS server\nLoad the AES-encrypted plugin file from a specified disk path\nDownload the plugin file from the current MataNet connection\n\nThe malware authors call their infrastructure MataNet. For covert communication, they\nemploy TLS1.2 connections with the help of the “openssl-1.1.0f” open source library,\nwhich is statically linked inside this module. Additionally, the traffic between MataNet\nnodes is encrypted with a random RC4 session key. MataNet implements both client and\nserver mode. In server mode the certificate file “c_2910.cls” and the private key file\n“k_3872.cls” are loaded for TLS encryption. However, this mode is never used.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe MataNet client establishes periodic connections with its C2. Every message has a 12byte-long header, where the first DWORD is the message ID and the rest is the auxiliary\ndata, as described in the table below:\n\n\n**Mes-**\n**sage**\n**ID**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n0x400 Complete the current MataNet session and delay the next session until the\nnumber of logical drives is changed or a new active user session is started.\n\n0x500 Delete configuration registry key and stop MATA execution until next reboot.\n\n0x601 Send configuration data to C2.\n\n0x602 Download and set new configuration data.\n\n0x700 Send the C2 the infected host basic information such as victim ID, internal\nversion number, Windows version, computer name, user name, IP address\nand MAC address.\n\n0x701 Send the C2 the configuration settings such as victim ID, internal version\nnumber and session timeout.\n\nThe main functionality of the orchestrator is loading each plugin file and executing them\nin memory. Each DLL file type plugin provides an interface for the orchestrator and\nprovides rich functionality that can control infected machines.\n\n**Plugin name** **Description**\n\n\nMATA_Plug_Cmd.dll\n\nMATA_Plug_Process.dll\n\nMATA_Plug_TestConnect.dll\n\nMATA_Plug_WebProxy.dll\n\nMATA_Plug_File.dll\n\n\nRun “cmd.exe /c” or “powershell.exe” with the specified parameters,\nand receive the output of the command execution.\n\nManipulate process (listing process, killing process, creating process,\ncreating process with logged-on user session ID).\n\nCheck TCP connection with given IP:port or IP range.\nPing given host or IP range.\n\nCreate a HTTP proxy server. The server listens for incoming TCP connections on the specified port, processing CONNECT requests from\nclients to the HTTP server and forwarding all traffic between client\nand server.\n\nManipulate files (write received data to given file, send given file after\nLZNT1 compression, compress given folder to\n%TEMP%\\~DESKTOP[8random hex].ZIP and send, wipe given file,\nsearch file, list file and folder, timestomping file).\n\n\n-----\n\nMATA_Plug_Load.dll\n\nMATA_Plug_P2PReverse.dll\n\n\nInject DLL file into the given process using PID and process name, or\ninject XORed DLL file into given process, optionally call export function with arguments.\n\nConnect between MataNet server on one side and an arbitrary TCP\nserver on the other, then forward traffic between them. IPs and ports\nfor both sides are specified on the call to this interface.\n\n\nThere is an interesting string inside the MATA_Plug_WebProxy plugin – “Proxy-agent:\n_[matt-dot-net” – which is a reference to Matt McKnight’s open source project. There are](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/93301/Implementing-a-Multithreaded-HTTP-HTTPS-Debugging)_\nsome differences though. Matt’s project is written in C# rather than C++. The MATA\nproxy is noticeably simpler, as there is no cache and no SSL support, for instance. It’s\npossible that MATA’s authors found and used the source code of an early version of Matt’s\nproxy server. It looks like the malware author rewrote the code from C# to C++ but left\nthis footprint unchanged.\n\n**_Proxy-agent of MATA_Plug_WebProxy.dll plugin_**\n\n## Non-Windows version of MATA\n\nThe MATA framework targets not only the Windows system but also Linux and macOS\nsystems.\n\n### Linux version\n\nDuring our research, we also found a package containing different MATA files together\nwith a set of hacking tools. In this case, the package was found on a legitimate\ndistribution site, which might indicate that this is the way the malware was distributed. It\nincluded a Windows MATA orchestrator, a Linux tool for listing folders, scripts for\n[exploiting Atlassian Confluence Server (CVE-2019-3396), a legitimate socat tool and a](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat)\nLinux version of the MATA orchestrator bundled together with a set of plugins. China[based security vendor Netlab also published a highly detailed blog on this malware.](https://blog.netlab.360.com/dacls-the-dual-platform-rat-en/)\n\nThe module is designed to run as a daemon. Upon launch, the module checks if it is\nalready running by reading the PID from “/var/run/init.pid” and checks if the\n“/proc/%pid%/cmdline” file content is equal to “/flash/bin/mountd”. Note that\n“/flash/bin/mountd” is an unusual path for standard Linux desktop or server\ninstallations. This path suggests that MATA’s Linux targets are diskless network devices\nsuch as routers, firewalls or IoT devices based on x86_64. The module can be run with\nthe “/pro” switch to skip the “init.pid” check. The AES-encrypted configuration is stored\n\n\n-----\n\nin the “$HOME/.memcache” file. The behavior of this module is the same as the\nWindows MATA orchestrator previously described. The plugin names of Linux MATA and\nthe corresponding Windows plugins are:\n\n**Linux plugin** **Corresponding Windows plugin**\n\n/bin/bash MATA_Plug_Cmd\n\nplugin_file MATA_Plug_File\n\nplugin_process MATA_Plug_Process\n\nplugin_test MATA_Plug_TestConnect\n\nplugin_reverse_p2p MATA_Plug_P2PReverse\n\nNote that the Linux version of MATA has a logsend plugin. This plugin implements an\ninteresting new feature, a “scan” command that tries to establish a TCP connection on\nports 8291 (used for administration of MikroTik RouterOS devices) and 8292\n(“Bloomberg Professional” software) and random IP addresses excluding addresses\nbelonging to private networks. Any successful connection is logged and sent to the C2.\nThese logs might be used by attackers for target selection.\n\n### macOS version\n\nWe discovered another MATA malware target for macOS uploaded to VirusTotal on April\n8, 2020. The malicious Apple Disk Image file is a Trojanized macOS application based on\n[an open-source two-factor authentication application named MinaOTP.](https://github.com/MinaOTP/MinaOTP-MAC)\n\n**_Trojanized macOS application_**\n\nThe Trojanized main TinkaOTP module is responsible for moving the malicious Mach-O\nfile to the Library folder and executing it using the following command:\ncp TinkaOTP.app/Contents/Resources/Base.lproj/SubMenu.nib ~/Library/.mina >\n\n\n-----\n\n/dev/null 2>&1 && chmod +x ~/Library/.mina > /dev/null 2>&1 && ~/Library/.mina >\n/dev/null 2>&1\n\nUpon launch, this malicious Mach-o file loads the initial configuration file from\n“/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstotore.db”.\n\nLike another strain running on a different platform, the macOS MATA malware also runs\non a plugin basis. Its plugin list is almost identical to the Linux version, except that it also\ncontains a plugin named “plugin_socks”. The “plugin_socks” plugin is similar to\n“plugin_reverse_p2p” and is responsible for configuring proxy servers.\n\n## Victims\n\nBased on our telemetry, we have been able to identify several victims who were infected\nby the MATA framework. The infection is not restricted to a specific territory. Victims\nwere recorded in Poland, Germany, Turkey, Korea, Japan and India. Moreover, the actor\ncompromised systems in various industries, including a software development company,\nan e-commerce company and an internet service provider.\n\nWe assess that MATA was used by an APT actor, and from one victim we identified one of\ntheir intentions. After deploying MATA malware and its plugins, the actor attempted to\nfind the victim’s databases and execute several database queries to acquire customer lists.\nWe’re not sure if they completed the exfiltration of the customer database, but it’s certain\nthat customer databases from victims are one of their interests. In addition, MATA was\nused to distribute VHD ransomware to one victim, something that will be described in\ndetail in an upcoming blog post.\n\n**_Victims of MATA_**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe assess that the MATA framework is linked to the Lazarus APT group. The MATA\norchestrator uses two unique filenames, c_2910.cls and k_3872.cls, which have only\npreviously been seen in several Manuscrypt variants, including the samples\n[(0137f688436c468d43b3e50878ec1a1f) mentioned in the US-CERT publication.](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10135536-B_WHITE.PDF)\n\n**_Unique file name_**\n\nMoreover, MATA uses global configuration data including a randomly generated session\nID, date-based version information, a sleep interval and multiple C2s and C2 server\naddresses. We’ve seen that one of the Manuscrypt variants\n(ab09f6a249ca88d1a036eee7a02cdd16) shares a similar configuration structure with the\nMATA framework. This old Manuscrypt variant is an active backdoor that has similar\nconfiguration data such as session ID, sleep interval, number of C2 addresses, infected\ndate, and C2 addresses. They are not identical, but they have a similar structure.\n\n**_Manuscrypt configuration structure_**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe MATA framework is significant in that it is able to target multiple platforms:\nWindows, Linux and macOS. In addition, the actor behind this advanced malware\nframework utilized it for a type of cybercrime attack that steals customer databases and\ndistributes ransomware. We evaluate that this malware is going to evolve, so we will be\nmonitoring its activity in order to protect our customers.\n\nFor more information please contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n### File Hashes (malicious documents, Trojans, emails, decoys)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Windows Loader**\n\nf364b46d8aafff67271d350b8271505a\n85dcea03016df4880cebee9a70de0c02\n1060702fe4e670eda8c0433c5966feee\n7b068dfbea310962361abf4723332b3a\n8e665562b9e187585a3f32923cc1f889\n6cd06403f36ad20a3492060c9dc14d80\n71d8b4c4411f7ffa89919a3251e6e5cb\na7bda9b5c579254114fab05ec751918c\ne58cfbc6e0602681ff1841afadad4cc6\n7e4e49d74b59cc9cc1471e33e50475d3\na93d1d5c2cb9c728fda3a5beaf0a0ffc\n455997E42E20C8256A494FA5556F7333\n7ead1fbba01a76467d63c4a216cf2902\n7d80175ea344b1c849ead7ca5a82ac94\nbf2765175d6fce7069cdb164603bd7dc\nb5d85cfaece7da5ed20d8eb2c9fa477c\n6145fa69a6e42a0bf6a8f7c12005636b\n2b8ff2a971555390b37f75cb07ae84bd\n1e175231206cd7f80de4f6d86399c079\n65632998063ff116417b04b65fdebdfb\nab2a98d3564c6bf656b8347681ecc2be\ne3dee2d65512b99a362a1dbf6726ba9c\nfea3a39f97c00a6c8a589ff48bcc5a8c\n2cd1f7f17153880fd80eba65b827d344\n582b9801698c0c1614dbbae73c409efb\na64b3278cc8f8b75e3c86b6a1faa6686\nca250f3c7a3098964a89d879333ac7c8\ned5458de272171feee479c355ab4a9f3\nf0e87707fd0462162e1aecb6b4a53a89\nf1ca9c730c8b5169fe095d385bac77e7\nf50a0cd229b7bf57fcbd67ccfa8a5147\n\n**Windows MATA**\n\nbea49839390e4f1eb3cb38d0fcaf897e  rdata.dat\n8910bdaaa6d3d40e9f60523d3a34f914  sdata.dat\n6a066cf853fe51e3398ef773d016a4a8\n228998f29864603fd4966cadd0be77fc\nda50a7a05abffb806f4a60c461521f41\nec05817e19039c2f6cc2c021e2ea0016\n\n**Registry path**\n\n\n-----\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\KxtNet\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\HlqNet\nHKLM\\Software\\mthjk\n\n**Linux MATA**\n\n859e7e9a11b37d355955f85b9a305fec  mdata.dat\n80c0efb9e129f7f9b05a783df6959812  ldata.dat, mdata.dat\nd2f94e178c254669fb9656d5513356d2  mdata.dat\n\n**Linux log collector**\n\n982bf527b9fe16205fea606d1beed7fa  hdata.dat\n\n**Open-source Linux SoCat**\n\ne883bf5fd22eb6237eb84d80bbcf2ac9  sdata.dat\n\n**Script for exploiting Atlassian Confluence Server**\n\na99b7ef095f44cf35453465c64f0c70c  check.vm, r.vm\n199b4c116ac14964e9646b2f27595156  r.vm\n\n**macOS MATA**\n\n81f8f0526740b55fe484c42126cd8396  TinkaOTP.dmg\nf05437d510287448325bac98a1378de1  SubMenu.nib\n\n### C2 address\n\n104.232.71.7:443\n107.172.197.175:443\n108.170.31.81:443\n111.90.146.105:443\n111.90.148.132:443\n172.81.132.41:443\n172.93.184.62:443\n172.93.201.219:443\n185.62.58.207:443\n192.210.239.122:443\n198.180.198.6:443\n209.90.234.34:443\n216.244.71.233:443\n23.227.199.53:443\n23.227.199.69:443\n\n\n-----\n\n23.254.119.12:443\n67.43.239.146:443\n68.168.123.86:443\n\n\n-----",
