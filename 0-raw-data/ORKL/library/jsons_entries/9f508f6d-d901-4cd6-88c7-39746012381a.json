Chumley\n\nScores of top U.S. defense, foreign policy and senior-level military authorities — including a\nfour-star admiral — have been sucked into a tangled weave of a social-media scam that’s\nbeen waged by creative Iranian hackers over the past few years, a new report from a cybersecurity firm found.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that since 2011, the hackers hit at hundreds of both current\nand former high-ranking U.S. officials, including a four-star admiral, who worked primarily on\nnon-proliferation issues.\n\nThe report, from iSightPartners, also found that the hackers targeted various personnel from\n10-plus different American and Israeli defense contracting companies.\n\nThe research firm iSight dubbed the operation Newscaster and said hackers used socialmedia sites like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn to draw their targets and then lure them to\ncheck out a bogus news site, NewsOnAir.org, filled with foreign policy and defense articles,\nThe Post reported.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe overall aim is that the social-media platform would give the hackers connections with\nthose at the top of public policy — and position them to tap into that information network.\n\nSpecifically, hackers wanted intelligence information that could give insight into U.S. and\nU.S.-Israeli military operations, as well as nuclear-related discussions between the U.S. and\nIran, the Washington Post reported.\n\n“They’re very brash,” Tiffany Jones, the senior vice president for iSight, told The Post. “What\nthey lack in technical sophistication, they make up for in creativity and persistence.”\n\nThe research firm couldn’t determine what data the hackers may have stolen. But they did\nfind that the NewsOnAir.org site is registered in Tehran.\n\n“The social networking is so elaborate, they’ve got connections to the highest levels of\nAmerican policy,” John Hultquist, the head of intelligence on cyber-espionage for iSight, told\nThe Post.\n\n_[• Cheryl K.
