Other\nvulnerabilities in public-facing infrastructure leveraged by the actor include exploitation of a\ndeserialisation vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), a 2019\nSharePoint vulnerability and the 2019 Citrix vulnerability.\n\nThe actor has shown the capability to quickly leverage public exploit proof-of-concepts to\ntarget networks of interest and regularly conducts reconnaissance of target networks looking\nfor vulnerable services, potentially maintaining a list of public-facing services to quickly target\nfollowing future vulnerability releases. The actor has also shown an aptitude for identifying\ndevelopment, test and orphaned services that are not well known or maintained by victim\norganisations.\n\nWhen the exploitation of public-facing infrastructure did not succeed, the ACSC has\nidentified the actor utilising various spearphishing techniques. This spearphishing has taken\nthe form of:\n\nlinks to credential harvesting websites\nemails with links to malicious files, or with the malicious file directly attached\nlinks prompting users to grant Office 365 OAuth tokens to the actor\nuse of email tracking services to identify the email opening and lure click-through\nevents.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce initial access is achieved, the actor utilised a mixture of open source and custom tools\nto persist on, and interact with, the victim network. Although tools are placed on the network,\nthe actor migrates to legitimate remote accesses using stolen credentials. To successfully\nrespond to a related compromise, all accesses must be identified and removed.\n\nIn interacting with victim networks, the actor was identified making use of compromised\nlegitimate Australian web sites as command and control servers. Primarily, the command and\ncontrol was conducted using web shells and HTTP/HTTPS traffic. This technique rendered\ngeo-blocking ineffective and added legitimacy to malicious network traffic during\ninvestigations.\n\nDuring its investigations, the ACSC identified no intent by the actor to carry out any\ndisruptive or destructive activities within victim environments.\n\n\n-----",
