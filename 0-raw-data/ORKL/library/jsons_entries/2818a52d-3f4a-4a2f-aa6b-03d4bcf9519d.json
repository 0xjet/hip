This blog post will explain the very active threat campaign targeting\nour customers’ cloud apps and how to secure your cloud risks.\n\n## Attack profile and example attack\n\nAs of February 28, 2022, we’ve observed approximately 78,000 credential variance attacks\n(i.e. brute force or password spray attempts), targeting 4,340 user accounts across 728\nmonitored cloud environments. Over 85% of the targeted organizations are US-based, with\nthe remainder operating in other Western countries. The vast majority of attacks either\noriginated from identified Russian sources (IP addresses and DCH services located in\nRussia) or from servers associated with Russian hosting services, chiefly in the US. In our\nassessment, unauthorized access could open the door to account takeover, privilege\nescalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.\n\nThe screenshot below showcases one of the many attacks we’ve seen. We detected this\nthreat to the user based on identifying the credential variance attack type, user behavior\nanalytics,and the user being heavily targeted in the past (the user is a Very Attacked Person\n, or VAP). In this case, the user has never attempted to log in to their organization’s Office\n365 account using the hostname “mastercommunications.ru” and a data hosting center\n(DCH) proxy. In fact, our threat intelligence has identified that as typical for this threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Screenshot: Suspicious login attempts from credential variance attacks detected by_\n_Proofpoint CASB viewed on the Information and Cloud Security platform_\n\n## Targeted industries and other technical analysis\n\nThe primary targets have been varied, with no industry accounting for more than 11% of all\nattacks. The top five most targeted industries account for 44% of all the attacks, including\nmanufacturing, financial services, healthcare, business services, and construction.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Chart: Proofpoint security research analysis on credential variance attacked by the targeted_\n_industry for February 22 – February 28, 2022_\n\nA few interesting artifacts of the campaign:\n\n1. An unusual user agent (UA) string – “14 Windows Mobile - Tablet Very common” –\n\namongst the many we’ve seen. We have seen either as a standalone string or\nappended to the end of a longer UA string. This UA string is unique to this campaign\nand may be unintentional.\n2. The attacks are conducted against users in alphabetic order by username, which may\n\nbe a trait of the credential variance tool kit used.\n3. The malicious targeting attempts are decentralized, with multiple hosting services and\n\noperational assets trying to compromise user accounts simultaneously.\n\n## Protect your cloud accounts with cloud security best practices\n\n- Treat any traffic from the IOCs listed below as potentially suspicious while this campaign is\nactive.\n\n- Monitor all cloud accounts of your organization for suspicious logins and remediate highly\nsuspicious logins immediately.\n\n\n-----\n\n-   Limit cloud traffic from locations of interest to trusted web infrastructure (IP addresses,\nISP hosts).\n\n- Use multi-factor authentication on your cloud services, especially web, customer, or\npartner-facing applications.\n\n- Set up DLP policies to identify sensitive data exfiltration to unmanaged devices.\n\n- Monitor for suspicious configuration changes to 3rd party OAuth apps, cloud email and\ncloud servers.\n\n**Summarized Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n**ISP / Proxy Service** **Associated Domain** **IP Address**\n\nAddress Management Inc. clouvider.co.uk 103.151.103.243\n\nAdmin LLC cadmin.ru 213.139.193.38\n\nAuction LLC dauction.ru 45.87.124.155\n\nB2 Net Solutions Inc. servermania.com 23.229.53.52\n\n23.229.53.63\n\n23.229.67.247\n\n23.229.67.248\n\n23.229.79.18\n\n23.229.79.24\n\n23.229.79.25\n\n23.229.79.28\n\nLIR LLC lir.am 103.152.17.248\n\n\n-----\n\nMastercom LLC mastercommunications.ru 109.94.218.192\n\n193.58.177.124\n\nOVH US LLC ovh.com 51.81.45.12\n\n51.81.45.128\n\nProline IT Ltd selectel.ru 176.53.133.249\n\n193.160.216.60\n\n193.160.217.66\n\n77.83.4.102\n\n77.83.5.161\n\nQwarta LLC qwarta.ru 193.232.144.116\n\n194.190.112.167\n\n194.190.179.10\n\n194.190.190.64\n\n194.190.90.41\n\n194.190.91.222\n\n194.226.185.120\n\n195.19.209.226\n\n212.193.136.39\n\n\n-----\n\n212.193.137.253\n\n212.193.140.208\n\n212.193.143.60\n\n62.76.147.174\n\n62.76.153.235\n\nThis post will be updated with additional details on observed user agents.\n\n_Is your organization protected from cloud credentialing attacks?
