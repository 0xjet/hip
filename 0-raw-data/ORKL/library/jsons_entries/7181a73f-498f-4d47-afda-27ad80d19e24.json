It is\nbelieved that the threat actors gained initial access through one or more SonicWall exploits\n\n[2], [3]. We can confirm prior sightings that Cobalt Strike was used by these threat actors to\nfurther gain access to exploit victim networks. In this blog, we will highlight previously\nunreported infrastructure that is managed by this unknown threat group.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nVictims are presented with the following ransom note:\n```\n   Hello dear user!\n   Unfortunately, your files have been encrypted and attackers are taking over 300\n   GB of your personal data, financial reports and many other documents.\n   Do not try to recover files yourself, you can damage them without special\n   software.\n   We can help you recover your files and prevent your data from leaking or being\n   sold on the darknet.\n   Just contact support using the following methods and we will decrypt one non   important file for free to convince you of our honesty.\n   Contact us method below:\n   Use TOR Browser: http://[redacted].onion/[redacted]\n\n### Hashes\n\n```\nA recent sample of the Golang packed malware was submitted to VirusTotal in mid July 2021\n\n[4]:\n\n\n-----\n\nMD5 864e4a109565f8d4052b959a12bfa45b\n\nSHA-1 94388841e65c0962e56bf3e37391006d0af20bf4\n\nSHA-256 d6f7eed7e8aeffb0683639a2c5b654d216f98a68de1528ef37685103f6e24550\n\n### Domains\n\nThe following domains have been attributed to the unknown threat group and have been\nobserved hosting a Cobalt Strike server using TLS/SSL on non-standard ports. It is clear\nthat these threat groups are attempting to blend in with the noise by generating seemingly\nlegitimate domains.\n\n3comnet.biz cisco-network.org group-policy.org releasesupgrade.com\n\n3comnet.net cisco-updates.com ibgp-cisco.com repositorybuster.com\n\nadvmicrodevice.com ciscodev.org intelfirmware.net routerosupdate.com\n\n\namibiosupdater.com\n\n\ncode-signing.org juniper-firmware.com serviceupdate.net\n\n\namibios.net dev-repository.com juniper-vpn.net softwarerepository.com\n\napps-update.net dev-service.org junipervlan.com softwareupdater.net\n\narchive-update.com dev.updatecore.net mikrotikfirmware.com ubiquiti-vpn.com\n\n\narchivesfirmwares.com\n\n\ndevelopmentsdata.com\n\n\nmikrotikvpn.net unattendedupgrades.net\n\n\nbgp-firmware.com dlinknetwork.com nvme-updates.com updatepayments.net\n\n\n-----\n\nbuster-updates.com dlp-systems.org poweredgeupdate.com\n\n\nveeamdata.com\n\n\ncisco-cloud.net esxi-update.net release-update.net vpn-updater.com\n\n### IP Addresses\n\nThe following IP addresses are related to the domains listed above and appear to be a single\nuse.\n\n104.129.26.226 170.130.28.35 173.232.146.43 23.226.132.245\n\n104.129.26.28 170.130.28.37 173.232.98.16 23.94.83.123\n\n104.129.42.67 170.130.55.16 191.101.172.24 45.227.255.15\n\n104.149.216.58 170.130.55.160 192.154.213.119 46.161.27.19\n\n\n104.223.106.239\n\n\n170.130.55.32\n\n\n192.154.213.122\n\n\n64.188.19.20\n\n\n107.150.19.211 170.130.55.97 192.154.224.52 64.188.27.154\n\n107.150.19.72 172.245.247.67 192.3.31.17 66.154.102.222\n\n162.218.210.152 172.245.87.3 192.3.99.71 66.154.103.212\n\n162.218.211.139 173.232.146.185 194.165.16.98 66.154.112.36\n\n162.245.191.153 173.232.146.218 198.23.141.117 66.63.162.170\n\n167.160.166.12 173.232.146.39 216.244.83.66\n\n## Am I impacted?\n\nThis threat group has been very active and if you or your organization utilized a SonicWall\nSMA VPN device since late 2020 or early 2021 without limited access, there is a likelihood\nthat your organization has been compromised If you observe any connections to the\n\n\n-----\n\ndomains listed above, it is very likely you are compromised.\n\n## What should I be doing to prevent these actors from disrupting our mission?\n\n1. Back up (or start backing up!) all of your critical business data to an offline location. We\n_observed these threat actors identifying backup solutions employed by a victim and removing_\n_all backup files from an online 3rd party solution provider._\n\n2. Patch and upgrade your SMA devices immediately. More information can be found here:\nhttps://www.sonicwall.com/support/product-notification/urgent-security-notice-critical-risk-tounpatched-end-of-life-sra-sma-8-x-remote-access-devices/210713105333210/\n\n3. Review all SMA logs looking for suspicious activity – specifically looking for successful\nauthentication attempts from non-US based IP addresses and/or IP addresses that don’t\noriginate from Internet service providers such as home or commercial ISPs.\n\n4. Enforce multi-factor authentication for all VPN accounts.\n\n5. Employ signatures to detect the above mentioned domains and hashes.\n\n**If you are in need of incident response support or ways to defend against this and**\n**other threats, please contact us at** **[https://breakpoint-labs.com/.](https://breakpoint-labs.com/mssp.php)**\n\n### References\n\n[1] [https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/new-ransomware-variant-uses-golang-packer/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/new-ransomware-variant-uses-golang-packer/)\n\n[2] https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/07/15/ransomware-risk-unpatched-eolsonicwall-sra-and-sma-8x-products\n\n[3] [https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0001](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0001)\n\n[4]\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d6f7eed7e8aeffb0683639a2c5b654d216f98a68de1528ef3\n7685103f6e24550/detection\n\n\n-----",
