We have named this family Linux/Mumblehard. A white paper about this\nthreat is available for download on WeLiveSecuriy.\n\n\n-----\n\nToday, ESET researchers reveal a family of Linux malware that stayed under the radar for\n[more than 5 years. We have named this family Linux/Mumblehard. A white paper about this](http://www.virusradar.com/en/Linux_Mumblehard/detail)\n[threat is available for download on WeLiveSecuriy.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/papers/white-papers/)\n\nThere are two components in the Mumblehard malware family: a backdoor and a\nspamming daemon. They are both written in Perl and feature the same custom packer\nwritten in assembly language. The use of assembly language to produce ELF binaries so as\nto obfuscate the Perl source code shows a level of sophistication higher than average.\n\nCheck out Alexis Dorais-Joncas explaining how Mumblehard works:\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XsxOvAlr45k\n\nMonitoring of the botnet suggests that the main purpose of Mumblehard seems to be to\n**send spam messages by sheltering behind the reputation of the legitimate IP addresses of**\nthe infected machines.\n\nThe relationship between the components and their command and control servers are\nillustrated in the following diagram:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Prevalence\n\nESET Researchers were able to monitor the Mumblehard backdoor component by\nregistering a domain name used as one of the C&C servers. More than 8,500 unique IP\n**addresses hit the sinkhole with Mumblehard behavior while we were observing the**\nrequests coming in. The following chart shows the number of unique IP addresses seen\neach day over that period.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can see from the chart that during the first week of April, more than 3,000 machines\n**were affected by Mumblehard. The number of infected hosts is slowly decreasing, but the**\noverall view shows that infection happens at specific times and that the botnet size has\ndoubled over a 6-month period.\n\nA quick look at the list of victims suggests that Mumblehard mostly targets web servers.\n\n## Links with Yellsoft\n\nOur analysis and research also shows a strong link between Mumblehard and Yellsoft.\nYellsoft sells software, written in Perl, designed to send bulk e-mails. This program is called\n**DirectMailer. The first link between them is that the IP addresses used as C&C servers for**\nboth the backdoor and spamming components are located in the same range as the web\nserver hosting yellsoft.net. The second link is that we have found pirated copies of\nDirectMailer online that actually silently install the Mumblehard backdoor when run. The\npirated copies were also obfuscated by the same packer used by Mumblehard’s malicious\ncomponents.\n\n## Prevention\n\nVictims should look for unsolicited cronjob entries for all the users on their servers. This\nis the mechanism used by the Mumblehard backdoor to activate the backdoor every 15\nminutes. The backdoor is usually installed in /tmp or /var/tmp. Mounting the tmp directory\nwith the noexec option prevents the backdoor from starting in the first place.\n\n[The white paper with all the technical details is available for download on WeLiveSecurity.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mumblehard.pdf)\n\n[Picture Credits: Flickr/Christian Barmala](https://www.flickr.com/photos/barmala/2561602478/in/photostream/)\n\n\n-----\n\n29 Apr 2015 - 12:50PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
