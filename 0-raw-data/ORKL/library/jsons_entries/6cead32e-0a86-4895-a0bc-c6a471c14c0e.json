I am also the cochair of the Disruption working group of the Institute for Security and Technology (IST)\nRansomware Task Force, which brings together experts across industries to combat the\nthreat of ransomware.[1] Prior to Microsoft, I spent a decade in government service at the\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security. At DHS, I held several attorney roles, specifically as\nthe lead attorney for the DHS representative to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the\nUnited States and then as a cybersecurity attorney for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency, and its predecessor. I want to thank you for the opportunity to discuss\nransomware attacks and illustrate why increased and meaningful information-sharing and\npublic private partnerships are critical to combatting this latest virulent example of costly\ncybercrime.\n\n\n-----\n\nI m also pleased to share information about how Microsoft is combatting ransomware. We\nbelieve the best strategy to decrease ransomware attacks is through targeted disruption\ncampaigns along with increased cyber security hygiene. I will close by highlighting several\nkey opportunities for more effective disruption of this cybercrime, opportunities to raise the\ncollective security of public sector and private sector organizations, and the importance of\npartnerships.\n\nRansomware attacks pose an increased danger to all Americans as critical infrastructure\nowners and operators, small and medium businesses, and state and local governments are\ntargeted by sophisticated criminal enterprises and nation-state proxies, operated by distinct\ncriminal organizations. A sustainable and successful effort against this threat will thus require\na whole-of –government strategy executed in close partnership with the private sector.\n\n**I. Microsoft’s Approach to Cybercrime**\n\nMicrosoft plays offense against online threats. Working through robust partnerships, we\nstrive to take down criminal infrastructure and pursue both financially motivated and nation\nstate supported cybercriminals. This work helps us to protect our customers and to improve\nthe safety of the global internet community so that all users – enterprises, consumers, and\ngovernments – can trust the technology and online services on which we rely for commerce\nand communication. The Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) is an international team of\ntechnical, legal, and business experts that has been fighting cybercrime to protect victims\nsince 2008. We use our expertise and unique view into online criminal networks to act. We\nshare insights internally that translate to security product features, we uncover evidence so\nthat we can make criminal referrals to appropriate law enforcement throughout the world,\nand we take legal action to disrupt malicious activity.\n\nAs part of the DCU, Microsoft’s new Ransomware Analysis and Disruption Program, which\nwe launched in 2020, strives to make ransomware less profitable and more difficult to deploy\nby disrupting infrastructure and payment systems that enable ransomware attacks and by\npreventing criminals from using Microsoft products and services to attack our customers. The\nprogram is based on Microsoft’s decade-long experience and history of success driving a\nsustained fight against other types of cybercrime.\n\nIn addition to partnering with law enforcement to disrupt cybercriminals involved in\n[ransomware attacks, such as the recent disruption of the payment system of the](https://tekdeeps.com/fbi-seizes-2-3-million-in-cryptocurrency-wallets-from-colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attackers/)\ncybercriminals that attacked Colonial Pipeline, Microsoft also uses our expertise to inform\ncybercrime legislation and global cooperation that advances the fight against cybercrime. We\nprovided substantial support to IST and participated in all four working groups of the\nRansomware Task Force. I personally co-chaired the Task Force’s Disruption working group.\nMy colleagues and I are also active participants in the World Economic Forum’s Partnership\nAgainst Cybercrime, focused on global policy efforts to combat ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough Microsoft s observations of ransomware deployment and attacks, our active\ncollaboration with the U.S. Government to date, and Microsoft’s thought leadership in the\nglobal discussion on policy and operational opportunities to counter ransomware, I will next\naddress opportunities for more effective disruption of this cybercrime, opportunities to raise\nthe collective security of public sector and private sector organizations, and the importance\nof partnerships.\n\n**II. Defining Ransomware**\n\n**A. What is a Ransomware Attack?**\n\nRansomware is a specific kind of malicious software or “malware” used by cybercriminals to\nrender data or systems inaccessible for the purposes of extortion – i.e., ransom. In a\nstandard ransomware attack the cybercriminal achieves unauthorized access to a victim’s\nnetwork, installs the ransomware, usually in locations with sensitive data or business critical\nsystems, and then executes the program, locking files on that network, making them\ninaccessible to the victim until a ransom is paid. Usually, the ransom demand is for payment\nin the form of cryptocurrency – such as Bitcoin. Increasingly, attackers also steal sensitive\ndata before deploying the actual ransomware in what is known as a double extortion\nransomware attack. The theft of data compels the victim to engage in negotiations and raises\nthe potential reputational, financial, and legal costs of not paying the ransom as the attackers\nwill not only leave the victim’s data locked, but also leak sensitive information that could\ninclude confidential business data or personally identifiable information.\n\nRecent, high-profile incidents such as those involving the Colonial Pipeline, JBS Foods, and\nKaseya ransomware attacks drew considerable public attention and illustrate the extent of\nthe threat and the significant, multimillion dollar consequences of ransomware. However,\nbased on Microsoft’s data, ransomware is not limited to high-profile incidents. It is ubiquitous\nand pervasive, impacting wide swathes of our economy, from the biggest to the smallest\nplayers. Our data shows that the energy sector represents one of the most targeted sectors,\nalong with the financial, healthcare, and entertainment sectors. And despite continued\npromises by some cybercriminals not to attack hospitals or healthcare companies during the\nglobal pandemic, Microsoft has observed that healthcare remains the number one target of\nransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware engagements by industry\n**B. How does a ransomware attack work?**\n\nThe image below depicts the basic steps that typically take place before a cybercriminal\ninstalls the malicious ransomware on a victim’s network. First, cybercriminals will gain access\nto the victim’s network through phishing, a stolen password, or through an unpatched\nsoftware vulnerability. Then, the cybercriminals will seek to move laterally within the network\nto obtain higher level privileges, such as those held by the victim’s IT Administrator, to\naccess the entire network. Cybercriminals will then conduct reconnaissance within the\nvictim’s network, looking for critical systems and sensitive data, in some cases stealing this\ndata, to facilitate an effective ransom demand. Finally, the cybercriminals will leverage this\ninformation to install the ransomware on the network that will lock the victim’s files until the\nransom is paid.\n\n\n-----\n\n**C. How do cybercriminals ransom targets?**\n\nRansomware has effectively evolved into a highly lucrative business model, with an\naccompanying advanced intelligence collection aspect. Criminal actors collect and perform\nresearch and analyze their intelligence to identify an optimal dollar amount for their ransom\ndemand. Once criminal actors break into a network, they may access and study their target’s\nfinancial documents and insurance policies to better inform their eventual ransom demand\nand negotiating position. They may even research the penalties associated with that\norganization’s local breach laws. The actors will then extort money from their victims, not\nonly in exchange for unlocking their systems, but in some cases to prevent public disclosure\nof the victim’s stolen data. Leveraging the significant intelligence they can gather on victim\ncompanies, the criminal actor will then launch their attack, identifying what they regard as an\n“appropriate” ransom amount.\n\nOnce the criminal actor installs the ransomware and uses it to lock the victim’s system, the\nvictim will have access only to a ransom note. The ransom note provides instructions to the\nvictim on how to communicate with the criminal actor. In the example below, the criminal\nused the ransomware strain known as Ryuk – one of many popular ransomware software\npackages in wide-spread use today. The criminal directs the victim to access the deep web\nusing the tor browser, a special means for accessing the deep web. At this point, the victim\ncan open communications with the criminal to negotiate the ransom or pay it.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe negotiation process and back-and-forth communications are often surreal and disturbing\nin the nonchalance with which some criminal actors offer to “help” companies recover from\nthe very attack they have orchestrated. The example below depicts a negotiation chat with a\npublic school district in which the criminals attempt to extort cash in exchange for a key to\nunlock the ransomware deployed on its network. The interaction demonstrates the research\nperformed by the criminal in advance of the negotiation, as the criminal actor explained that\nthey had\n\n“examined all financial documents, bank statements for the last year, insurance. And came to\nthe conclusion that you are exaggerating about poor financial condition. We also calculated\nyour possible losses from lawsuits from both your staff and your students for the leakage of\ntheir personal data. These fines will exceed $30 million. We are not talking about the loss of\nreputation, which in our opinion costs more.”[2]\n\n**D What barriers to entry exist to executing a ransomware attack?**\n\n\n-----\n\nVery few. A cybercriminal does not need specialized computer coding skills to profit from\nransomware. The only cybercriminal in the entire ransomware lifecycle who requires\nspecialized code development skills is the originator who develops the malicious software in\nthe first place. There are hundreds, if not thousands of different ransomware variants, such\nas Ryuk, Darkside, REvil, Maze, and Conti. Attacks are often misleadingly named after the\nmalicious software that was installed on a victim’s network though the cybercriminals\ninvolved in the attack may not have any link to creator of that particular ransomware. A single\ncybercriminal may use any number of ransomware variants in conjunction with other tools to\nattack victim networks.\n\nIncreasingly, cybercriminals who use ransomware have moved to a “Ransomware as a\nService” business model that is driven by human intelligence and research. This has further\ndecreased the barriers to entry for any cybercriminal. Ransomware as a Service is a\n“modular” business model where individuals with limited technical skills can leverage the\nmalware developed by others to conduct their own attacks.\n\nDevelopers or managers will use hacker forums to recruit affiliate hackers. For example, as\n[Bleeping Computer reported last fall, REvil developers used hacker forums to actively recruit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-deposits-1-million-in-hacker-recruitment-drive/)\naffiliate hackers. To facilitate the business aspect of the relationship, developers create and\nrun ransomware and payment sites with affiliates who hack businesses and lock their\ndevices. Developers typically get 20-30% of any ensuing ransom, with affiliates receiving 7080%. This is effectively a crime syndicate where each member is paid for a particular\nexpertise.\n\nThe below example, following the flow of cryptocurrency, shows how a criminal enterprise\nsplit its bitcoin (BTC) “earnings” such that approximately 25% of the earnings flowed to the\ndeveloper/manager and 75% of the “earnings” flowed to the attacker.\nTransaction hashes and wallet addresses intentionally blurred for publication\n\nTransaction hashes and wallet addresses intentionally blurred for publication\n**III. Opportunities for Disruption**\n\nDisruption of criminal activity does not eliminate the problem, but it raises the cost of\ncommitting the crime. Arrests and prosecution in cybercrime can be difficult, disrupting the\ninfrastructure that is used by cybercriminals in ransomware attacks is therefore a key part of\ndeterrence. In the case of ransomware, there are opportunities for both the public and private\n\n\n-----\n\nsector to focus on making the crime more difficult to commit (infrastructure disruption) and\nopportunities to focus on making the crime less profitable (payment disruption). The hope is\nthat by shifting this balance, criminal actors will abandon this crime.\n\n**A. Disrupt the Infrastructure by targeting the criminal actor’s ability to communicate**\n**with the victim or publicly disclose stolen data.**\n\nThere is not a “one size fits all” infrastructure disruption that will eliminate ransomware;\nrather, disruption will make it more difficult for the criminal actor to accomplish their goals,\nthereby raising the cost of committing this crime. Generally, infrastructure disruption focuses\non removing the infrastructure such as websites, servers or email accounts that enable the\ncriminal actor to negotiate the ransom with the victim and for publicly disclosing the victim’s\nsensitive data. Ransomware attacks often use the same infrastructure for multiple\ncampaigns. Cybercriminals decide how to conduct their attack based on what security tools\nwere present, whether the network had good cyber hygiene, and which data the\ncybercriminals wanted to exfiltrate from the network.\n\nAlthough the new Ransomware as a Service business model relies on a variety of tools and\nultimate choice of ransomware, all of them need to operate in a similar manner to effectively\nextract payment from victims. The infrastructure used is rather consistent. For example,\nevery double extortion ransomware scheme needs a location to publicize the stolen data and\nan opportunity to establish communication with their victims to negotiate the terms of the\nransom. This provides a disruption opportunity.\n\n**B. Disrupt the Payment Distribution System by targeting intermediaries that support**\n**the vulnerable elements of the system.**\n\nDisrupting the payment distribution system that supports this crime makes ransomware\nattacks less profitable. Improving our technical means and legal process for disrupting the\ninfrastructure that supports payments earned through ransom will significantly impact the\nprofitability (and thereby prevalence) of this crime. Because the payment distribution system\nand the intermediaries that support the money flow ranges across international borders,\ndisrupting the payment distribution system will require a global strategy.\n\nThe infographic below demonstrates the flow of payment and opportunities for disruption: a\nvictim (Alice) will obtain a wallet that is able to send cryptocurrency. There are several types\nof wallets – wallets that are held by a service provider on behalf of the owner (otherwise\nknown as a “hot” wallet) or wallets that are in the sole custody of the owner and are not\naccessible by any other party (otherwise known as a “cold” wallet). Victims usually obtain\n“hot” wallets while criminals will often have both “hot” and “cold” wallets. There are a series\nof actions that are taken to send cryptocurrency in a pseudonymous manner ultimately\nresulting in its receipt by the criminal (Rob). Rob then has a variety of choices to convert his\ncryptocurrency payment into traditional fiat currency, like U.S. Dollars. Those options include\ngoing through a crypto kiosk (which is akin to an automated teller machine), using a crypto\n\n\n-----\n\nexchange, using a peer-to-peer exchange or using an over-the-counter trading desk. Other\noptions include purchasing gift cards, gambling, or going through some other payment\nprocessor. It is these on-ramps (obtaining a “hot” wallet) and the off-ramps (exchanging\ndigital currency into traditional currency) where the criminal actor is most vulnerable and the\nopportunity for disruption is greatest.\n\nInfographic taken from the U.S. Department of Justice Report of the Attorney General’s\nCyber Digital Task Force\nRegardless of where ransomware is deployed, typically the threat actors will demand\npayment via crypto currency. Though the underlying blockchain technology facilitates\ntransparent cryptocurrency flows, the owners of wallets remain pseudonymous. To achieve\nthis pseudonymity, first a threat actor must obtain a crypto wallet from a wallet services\ncompany and second, the threat actor will seek to cash out its crypto currency through some\nsort of platform. At its core, the criminal actor needs to append the blockchain with a\ntransaction and ultimately find a way to cash out. Most stakeholders in this cryptocurrency\nsystem do not want their platforms used for nefarious purposes. Those that are compliant\nwith U.S. laws are interested in partnering with the security community to make it more\ndifficult for criminal actors to use\n\ntheir platforms. However, some wallet service providers and crypto currency exchanges can\nexist in jurisdictions that are either unwilling or unable to effectively police these service\nproviders. It’s these intermediaries that facilitate the flow of ill-gotten earnings from\nransomware. The private sector through civil litigation, and the government through criminal\nseizure, regulatory enforcement, and international collaboration can take coordinated action\nto disrupt these weak points in the payment process. We applaud the U.S. Department of\nJustice’s formation of its internal Ransomware Task Force and recent operation to seize a\nwallet and crypto currency from the criminal gang that attacked Colonial Pipeline.\n\n**IV. Raising Awareness for Potential Victims.**\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough disruption is important, preventing criminal actors from getting into networks in the\nfirst place and making organizations resilient to attacks are equally important. Potential\nvictims, governments, organizations, and businesses of all sizes are at varying levels of\npreparedness maturity. Ensuring that all potential victims increase their security and\nresilience is key.\n\nCybercriminals who install ransomware use tried and true methods for access. Often,\napplying basic cybersecurity hygiene can prevent a cybercriminal’s ability to ransom a\nsystem. Consider, for example, the [recent ransomware attack against EDGAR, the Securities](https://finance-yahoo-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/column-spent-24-years-building-120045105.html)\nand Exchange Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system.\nCybercriminals were able to access the network through an IT Administrator’s password that\nwas compromised in an earlier breach.[3]\n\nMicrosoft recommends that the government produce clear useable guidance to address\ncommon points of confusion around ransomware attacks, clarifying what organizations\nshould do first, next, and after that (1-2-3 style guidance). Although NIST has done an\nexcellent job of addressing many aspects of these attacks, organizations still struggle with\nwhere to start (especially smaller organizations with limited staff and experience). Any\ngovernment guidance should clearly state top security priorities, and why they are important.\nFor example, a simple three step approach could be effective: (1) Make it harder to get in, (2)\nLimit the scope of damage and (3) Prepare for the worst.\n\n**Making it harder to get in. There are several basic cybersecurity hygiene steps that can be**\ntaken to make it much harder for attackers to gain access to the victim’s network. The most\nimportant of these steps is the use of multi-factor authentication. A study done at Microsoft\nestimates that more than 99% of all cyberattacks would have been prevented if multi-factor\nauthentication were deployed. Multi-factor authentication is important to raising friction for\nentry but will take time to complete as part of a larger security journey. Other steps can be\ntaken to identify and close off vulnerable entry points. Limiting the scope of damage forces\nthe attackers to work harder to gain access to multiple business critical systems by\nestablishing least privileged access and adopting Zero Trust Principles. These steps make it\nharder for an attacker who gets into a network to travel across the network in order to find\nvaluable data to lock up. There are many resources that describe how to do this effectively,\nand simple free tools, like those from the Cyber Risk Institute, can help even small and\nmedium size businesses do this work. Finally, encouraging potential victims to prepare for\n**the worst is designed to minimize the monetary incentives for ransomware attackers by**\nmaking it harder to access and disrupt systems and easier for victims to recover from an\nattack without paying the ransom.\n\n[The recently launched Stop Ransomware website hosted by DHS/CISA is a fantastic](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware)\nresource for explaining ransomware, providing a step by step guide to responding to a\nransomware attack, and providing best practices for preparedness.\n\n**V. The importance of Public – Private Partnerships**\n\n\n-----\n\nJust as committing ransomware attacks requires collective effort, countering ransomware\nattacks needs the same focus and global coordination. As these attacks have evolved to\nmore sophisticated enterprise-like operations involving multiple players, countering these\nefforts requires a multi-stakeholder approach. Each of us has an important role to play, with\nthe foundation of our efforts being reliable information and operational collaboration. The\nprivate sector and the U.S. government have engaged in and experimented with technical\nand legal models, globally, to disrupt and dismantle cybercrime infrastructure. Efforts to date\nillustrate that a collaborative multi-stakeholder approach – sharing actionable information and\nleveraging the combined capabilities of the private sector and the government – yields the\nbest opportunity to disrupt cybercrime quickly and at scale.\n\nThe [recent take down of Emotet, a botnet known to support the distribution of the Ryuk](https://www.wired.com/story/emotet-botnet-takedown/)\nransomware, involved law enforcement around the world as well as private sector security\nresearchers. Individual computers infected with malicious software are called bots. These\nbots are controlled by the cybercriminal to create a botnet –that can be used to engage in\nfurther criminal activity. These botnets can range from a few hundred to tens of millions of\ncompromised systems. In taking down the Emotet botnet, law enforcement seized assets\nand arrested the cyber criminals in Ukraine while researchers working with law enforcement\ntook down Emotet’s command and control infrastructure used to operate the botnet and\ncleaned the individual computers in the botnet. The effort involved a worldwide coalition of\nlaw enforcement agencies across the U.S., Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany,\nFrance, Lithuania, and Ukraine to disrupt and take over Emotet’s infrastructure which was\nlocated in more than 90 countries[4] – while simultaneously arresting at least two of the\ncybercriminals.\n\nAs the U.S. government has recognized, for example, with the creation of the new\ninteragency ransomware taskforce and the FBI’s new cyber strategy, unilateral action,\nwhether public or private, is not a sustainable solution against nation-state sponsored or\nfinancially motivated sophisticated organized cybercrime. To combat ransomware we\nrecommend:\n\nClearly understanding the problem: Cybercriminals currently take advantage of the\ninternet and the limitations of sovereignty to carry out crime against victims located\nanywhere in the world. While the internet and technological tools enable cybercriminals\nto operate with almost absolute anonymity.\nFocusing on what can be done to address the problem: Disruption of malicious\ninfrastructure, even when arrest is not possible, through global cooperation between\nthe private sector and governments.\nIncreasing focus on critical areas: To increase the scope and scale of disruptions, and\nto have success similar to Emotet, public-private information sharing, strong global\nMutual Legal Assistance, technical operational capabilities and training, threat tracking\nand prioritization, and victim remediation needs to be improved.\n\n\n-----\n\nA collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach to countering cybercrime, including ransomware\nmust be nimble and function at scale. Though the bulk of government efforts have been\ndriven by traditional law enforcement objectives and tactics (e.g., indictment and arrest), we\nnow see a shift in the U.S. government and foreign governments to actions to disrupt\ncybercriminal infrastructure. Traditional enforcement mechanisms are a critical piece of\nglobal cybersecurity and U.S. national security; however, we must continue to focus on the\nmore immediate “takedown” or disruption of infrastructure, which more strategically aligns\nwith the needs and priorities of many victims and is a significant public interest. This focus on\ndisruption should be a primary strategy to combat ransomware.\n\n**VI. Conclusion**\n\nI am pleased to see that the U.S. Government, the security community, state and local\ngovernments, and the international community are coming together for a coordinated\nresponse to ransomware. There is much work that needs to be done but I am optimistic that\nwe collectively have the thought leadership to accomplish our goals. The IST Ransomware\nTask Force published a set of thoughtful and measured policy and operational\nrecommendations, including several that may require legislative action. I encourage all\nstakeholders involved to act where they can to reduce the incidence of ransomware attacks.\n\n[1] The Task Force recently published a framework of actionable solutions aimed to mitigate ransomware as a\nmalicious cyber activity and criminal enterprise: [Institute for Security and Technology (IST) » RTF Report:](https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/report/)\n[Combatting Ransomware](https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/report/)\n\n[2] See also [Parents were at the end of their chain –](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/parents-end-chain-ransomware-hit-rcna646) [then ransomware hit (nbcnews.com)](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/parents-end-chain-ransomware-hit-rcna646)\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\nTags: [cyberattacks,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberattacks/) [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [ransomware](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/ransomware/)\n\n\n-----",
