Additional information may be found in a statement from the State\nDepartment. For more information on Russian malicious cyber activity, refer to cisa.gov/uscert/russia.\n\nSUMMARY\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n(CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nare aware of possible threats to U.S. and international\nsatellite communication (SATCOM) networks.\nSuccessful intrusions into SATCOM networks could\ncreate risk in SATCOM network providers’ customer\nenvironments.\nGiven the current geopolitical situation, CISA’s Shields\nUp initiative requests that all organizations significantly\nlower their threshold for reporting and sharing\nindications of malicious cyber activity. To that end, CISA\nand FBI will update this joint Cybersecurity Advisory\n(CSA) as new information becomes available so that\nSATCOM providers and their customers can take\nadditional mitigation steps pertinent to their\nenvironments.\n\nActions to Take Today:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nUse secure methods for\nauthentication.\nEnforce principle of least\nprivilege.\nReview trust relationships.\nImplement encryption.\nEnsure robust patching and\nsystem configuration audits.\nMonitor logs for suspicious\nactivity.\nEnsure incident response,\nresilience, and continuity of\noperations plans are in place.\n\nCISA and FBI strongly encourages critical infrastructure organizations and other organizations that\nare either SATCOM network providers or customers to review and implement the mitigations outlined\nin this CSA to strengthen SATCOM network cybersecurity.\nTo report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact your local\nFBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at (855) 292-3937 or by email at CyWatch@fbi.gov. When available, please include the following information regarding the incident: date, time, and\nlocation of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the\nsubmitting company or organization; and a designated point of contact. To request incident response resources or technical\nassistance related to these threats, contact CISA at report@cisa.gov.\nThis document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited.

TLP\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nMITIGATIONS\nCISA and FBI strongly encourages critical infrastructure organizations and other organizations that\nare either SATCOM network providers or customers to review and implement the following\nmitigations:\n\nMitigations for SATCOM Network Providers\n●\n\n●\n\nPut in place additional monitoring at ingress and egress points to SATCOM\nequipment to look for anomalous traffic, such as:\no The presence of insecure remote access tools—such as Teletype Network\nProtocol (Telnet), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure Shell Protocol (SSH),\nSecure Copy Protocol (SCP), and Virtual Network Computing (VNC)—facilitating\ncommunications to and from SATCOM terminals.\no Network traffic from SATCOM networks to other unexpected network segments.\no Unauthorized use of local or backup accounts within SATCOM networks.\no Unexpected SATCOM terminal to SATCOM terminal traffic.\no Network traffic from the internet to closed group SATCOM networks.\no Brute force login attempts over SATCOM network segments.\nSee the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Annual Threat Assessment\nof the U.S. Intelligence Community, February 2022 for specific state-sponsored cyber\nthreat activity relating to SATCOM networks.\n\nMitigations for SATCOM Network Providers and Customers\n●\n\n●\n\n●\n\nUse secure methods for authentication, including multifactor authentication where\npossible, for all accounts used to access, manage, and/or administer SATCOM networks.\no Use and enforce strong, complex passwords: Review password policies to ensure\nthey align with the latest NIST guidelines.\no Do not use default credentials or weak passwords.\no Audit accounts and credentials: remove terminated or unnecessary accounts;\nchange expired credentials.\nEnforce principle of least privilege through authorization policies. Minimize\nunnecessary privileges for identities. Consider privileges assigned to individual personnel\naccounts, as well as those assigned to non-personnel accounts (e.g., those assigned to\nsoftware or systems). Account privileges should be clearly defined, narrowly scoped, and\nregularly audited against usage patterns.\nReview trust relationships. Review existing trust relationships with IT service providers.\nThreat actors are known to exploit trust relationships between providers and their\ncustomers to gain access to customer networks and data.\no Remove unnecessary trust relationships.\no Review contractual relationships with all service providers. Ensure contracts\ninclude appropriate provisions addressing security, such as those listed below, and\nthat these provisions are appropriately leveraged:\n▪ Security controls the customer deems appropriate.\n\nPage 2 of 4 | Product ID: AA22-076A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nProvider should have in place appropriate monitoring and logging of\nprovider-managed customer systems.\n▪ Customer should have in place appropriate monitoring of the service\nprovider’s presence, activities, and connections to the customer network.\n▪ Notification of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents\noccurring on the provider’s infrastructure and administrative networks.\nImplement independent encryption across all communications links leased from, or\nprovided by, your SATCOM provider. See National Security Agency (NSA) Cybersecurity\nAdvisory: Protecting VSAT Communications for guidance.\n▪\n\n●\n\n●\n\n●\n\n●\n\nStrengthen the security of operating systems, software, and firmware.\no Ensure robust vulnerability management and patching practices are in place\nand, after testing, immediately patch known exploited vulnerabilities included in\nCISA's living catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities carry\nsignificant risk to federal agencies as well as public and private sectors entities.\no Implement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs\ncan track and mitigate emerging threats. Regularly audit system configurations for\nmisconfigurations and security weaknesses\nMonitor network logs for suspicious activity and unauthorized or unusual login\nattempts.\no Integrate SATCOM traffic into existing network security monitoring tools.\no Review logs of systems behind SATCOM terminals for suspicious activity.\no Ingest system and network generated logs into your enterprise security information\nand event management (SIEM) tool.\no Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools where possible on\ndevices behind SATCOM terminals, and ingest into the SIEM.\no Expand and enhance monitoring of network segments and assets that use\nSATCOM.\no Expand monitoring to include ingress and egress traffic transiting SATCOM links\nand monitor for suspicious or anomalous network activity.\no Baseline SATCOM network traffic to determine what is normal and investigate\ndeviations, such as large spikes in traffic.\nCreate, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response plan, resilience plan, and\ncontinuity of operations plan so that critical functions and operations can be kept\nrunning if technology systems—including SATCOM networks—are disrupted or need to be\ntaken offline.\n\nCONTACT\nAll organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA 24/7 Operations Center at\nreport@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7\nCyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.\n\nPage 3 of 4 | Product ID: AA22-076A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nRESOURCES\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nNational Security Agency (NSA) Cybersecurity Advisory: Protecting VSAT Communications\nNSA Cybersecurity Technical Report: Network Infrastructure Security Guidance\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI): Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S.\nIntelligence Community, February 2022\nCISA Tip: Choosing and Protecting Passwords\nCISA Capacity Enhancement Guide: Implementing Strong Authentication\n\nPage 4 of 4 | Product ID: AA22-076A\n\nTLP:WHITE",
