For example, opaque predicates were\napplied to [Turla mosquito and APT10 ANEL. Another obfuscation, control flow flattening,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ESET_Turla_Mosquito.pdf)\nwas applied to APT10 ANEL and Dharma ransomware packer.\n\nANEL (also referred to as UpperCut) is a RAT program used by APT10 and observed in\nJapan uniquely. According to [SecureWorks, all ANEL samples whose version is 5.3.0 or](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2019/pdf/JSAC2019_6_tamada_jp.pdf)\nlater are obfuscated with opaque predicates and control flow flattening.\n\nOpaque predicate is a programming term that refers to decision making where there is\nactually only one path. For example, this can be seen as calculating a value that will\nalways return True. Control flow flattening is an obfuscation method where programs do\nnot cleanly flow from beginning to end. Instead, a switch statement is called in an infinite\nloop having multiple code blocks each performing operations, as detailed later in this\npaper in Figure 10.\n\n\n-----\n\nintroduced IDA Pro plugin [HexRaysDeob didn t work for one of the obfuscated ANEL](https://github.com/RolfRolles/HexRaysDeob)\nsamples because the tool was made for another variant of the obfuscation.\n\nTAU investigated the ANEL obfuscation algorithms then modified the HexRaysDeob code\nto defeat the obfuscations. After the modification, TAU was able to recover the original\ncode.\n\nThe below image depicts, an example of an obfuscated function:\n\n_Figure 1: obfuscated function example (all codes cannot be displayed in a screen)_\n\nThe image below shows the same function once it has been deobfuscated:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: de-obfuscated result of the same function_\n\n# Details\n\nHexRaysDeob is an IDA Pro plugin written by Rolf Rolles to address obfuscation seen in\nbinaries. In order to perform the deobfuscation, the plugin manipulates the IDA\nintermediate language called microcode. If you aren’t familiar with those structures (e.g,\nmicrocode data structures, maturity level, Microcode Explorer and so on), you should read\n[his blog post. Rolles also provides an overview of each obfuscation technique in the same](http://www.hexblog.com/?p=1248)\npost.\n\nHexRaysDeob installs two callbacks when loading:\n\n_optinsn_t for defeating opaque predicates (defined as ObfCompilerOptimizer)_\n_optblock_t for defeating control flow flattening (defined as CFUnflattener)_\n\n## Opaque Predicates\n\nBefore continuing, it is important to understand Hex-Rays maturity levels. When a binary is\nloaded into IDA Pro, the application will perform distinct layers of code analysis and\noptimization, referred to as maturity levels. One layer will detect shellcode, another\noptimizes it into blocks, another determines global variables, and so forth. The\n_optinsn_t::func callback function is called in maturity levels from MMAT_ZERO (microcode_\ndoes not exist) to MMAT_GLBOPT2 (most global optimizations completed). During the\ncallback, opaque predicates pattern matching functions are called. If the code pattern is\nmatched with the definitions, it is replaced with another expression for the deobfuscation.\nThis is important to perform in each maturity level as the obfuscated code could be\nmodified or removed as the code becomes more optimized. We defined two patterns for\nanalysis of the ANEL sample.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: opaque predicates pattern matching functions switch_\n\n### Pattern 1: ~(x * (x – 1)) | -2\n\nBelow is an example of one of the opaque predicates patterns used by ANEL:\n\n\n-----\n\n*** (dword_745BB58C – 1) is always even. This results in the lowest bit of the negated**\nvalue becoming 1. Thus, OR by -2 (0xFFFFFFFE) will always produce the value -1.\n\nIn this case, the pattern matching function replaces dword_745BB58C *\n**(dword_745BB58C – 1) with 2.**\n\n### Pattern 2: read-only global variable >= 10 or < 10\n\nAnother pattern is the following:\n\n_Figure 5: opaque predicates pattern 2_\n\nThe global variable value dword_72DBB588 is always 0 because the value is not\ninitialized (we can check it by is_loaded API) and has only read accesses. So the pattern\nmatching function replaces the global variable with 0.\n\nThere are some variants with this pattern (e.g., the variable – 10 < 0), where the\nimmediate constant can be different, like 9.\n\n### Data-flow tracking for the patterns\n\nWe also observed a pattern that was also using an 8-bit portion of the register. In the\nfollowing example, the variable v5 in pseudocode is a register operand (cl) in microcode.\nWe need to check if the value comes from the result of x * (x – 1).\n\n_Figure 6: register operand (pseudocode) in pattern 1_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: register operand (microcode) in pattern 1_\n\nIn another example, the variable v2 in pseudocode is a register operand (ecx) in\nmicrocode. We have to validate if a global variable with above-mentioned conditions is\nassigned to the register.\n\n_Figure 8: register operand (pseudocode) in pattern 2_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: register operand (microcode) in pattern 2_\n\nData-flow tracking code was added to detect these use-cases. The added code requires\nthat the mblock_t pointer information is passed from the argument of optinsn_t::func to\ntrace back previous instructions using the mblock_t linked list. However, the callback\nreturns NULL from the mblock_t pointer if the instruction is not a top-level one. For\nexample, Figure 9 shows jnz (m_jnz) is a top-level instruction and setl (m_setl) is a subinstruction. If the setl is always sub-instruction during the optimization, we never get the\npointer. To handle this type of scenario, the code was modified to catch and pass the\nmblock_t of the jnz instruction to the sub-instruction.\n\n## Control Flow Flattening\n\nThe original implementation calls the optblock_t::func callback function in\nMMAT_LOCOPT (local optimization and graphing are complete) maturity level. Rolles\npreviously explained the unflattening algorithm in a Hex-Rays blog. For brevity I will\nquickly cover some key points to understand the algorithm at a high level.\n\nNormally the call flow graph (CFG) of a function obfuscated with control flow flattening has\na loop structure starting with yellow-colored “control flow dispatcher” like this, shown after\nthe First Block:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: function obfuscated with control flow flattening_\n\nThe original code is separated into the orange-colored “first block” and green-colored\nflattened blocks. The analyst is then required to resolve the correct next block and modify\nthe destination accordingly.\n\nThe next portion of first block and each flattened block is decided by a “block comparison\nvariable” with an immediate value. The value of the variable is assigned to a specific\nregister in each block then compared in a control flow dispatcher and other condition\nblocks.\n\n_Figure 11: block comparison variable example (blue-highlighted eax in this case)_\n\nIf the variable registers for the comparison and assignment are different, the assignment\nvariable is called “block update variable” (which is further explained later).\n\nThe algorithm looks straightforward however some portions of the code had to be modified\nin order to correctly deobfuscate the code. This is further detailed below.\n\n### Unflattening in multiple maturity levels\n\n\n-----\n\nMMAT_LOCOPT maturity level. Rolles said this was to handle another obfuscation called\n“Odd Stack Manipulations”, referred in his blog). However the unflattening of ANEL code\nhad to be performed in the later maturity level since the assignment of block comparison\nvariable heavily depends on opaque predicates.\n\nAs an example in the following obfuscated function, the v3 and v7 variables are assigned\nto the block comparison variable (b_cmp). However the values are dependent on opaque\npredicates results.\n\n_Figure 12: simple obfuscated function example_\n\nOnce the opaque predicates are broken, the loop code becomes simpler:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13: simple obfuscated function example (opaque predicates deleted)_\n\nUnflattening the code in later maturity levels like MMAT_GLBOPT1 and MMAT_GLBOPT2\n(first and second pass of global optimization) caused additional problems. The unflattening\nalgorithm requires mapping information between block comparison variable and the actual\nblock number (mblock_t::serial) used in the microcode. In later maturity levels, some\nblocks are deleted by the optimization after defeating opaque predicates, which removes\nthe mapping information.\n\nIn the example below, the blue-highlighted immediate value 0x4624F47C is assigned to\nblock comparison variable in the first block. The mapping can be created by checking the\nconditional jump instruction (jnz) in MMAT_LOCOPT.\n\n_Figure 14: mapping between block comparison variable 0x4624F47C and block number 9_\n\nAdditionally here is no mapping information in MMAT_GLBOPT2 because the condition\nblock that contains the variable has been deleted. So the next block of the first one in the\nlevel can not be determined.\n\n\n-----\n\naddress in MMAT_LOCOPT, as the block number is changed in each maturity level. If the\ncode can’t determine the mapping in later maturity levels, it attempts to guess the next\nblock number based on the address, considering each block and instruction addresses.\nThe guessing is not 100% accurate however it works for the majority of obfuscated\nfunctions tested.\n\n_Figure 16: the output log showing ea and block number translation_\n\n_Figure 17: the result of deobfuscation in this case_\n\n### Control flow handling with multiple dispatchers\n\nThough the original implementation assumes an obfuscated function has only one control\nflow dispatcher, some functions in the ANEL sample have multiple control dispatchers.\nOriginally the code called the optblock_t::func callback in MMAT_GLBOPT1 and\nMMAT_GLBOPT2, as the result was not correct in MMAT_CALLS (detecting call\narguments). However, this did not work for functions with three or more dispatchers.\nAdditionally, Hex-Rays kernel doesn’t optimize some functions in MMAT_GLBOPT2 if it\njudges the optimization within the level is not required. In this case, the callback is\nexecuted just once in the implementation.\n\nTo handle multiple control flow dispatchers, a callback for decompiler events was\nimplemented. The code catches the “hxe_prealloc” event (according to Hex-Rays, this is\nthe final event for optimizations) then calls optblock_t::func callback. Typically this event\noccurs a few times to several times, so the callback can deobfuscate multiple control flow\n\n\n-----\n\nalgorithm for finding control flow dispatcher and first block, validating a block comparison\nvariable, and so on).\n\nAfter the modification, for example, the following functions with multiple control flow\ndispatchers can be unflattened.\n\nIn the case of two control flow dispatchers:\n\n_Figure 18: example #1 with two control flow dispatchers (graph)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19: example #1 with two control flow dispatchers (before)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20: example #1 with two control flow dispatchers (after)_\n\nIn the case of three control flow dispatchers:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21: example #2 with three control flow dispatchers (graph)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 22: example #2 with three control flow dispatchers (before)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 23: example #2 with three control flow dispatchers (after)_\n\n### Implementation for various conditional/unconditional jump cases\n\nAs shown in Figure 24, the original implementation supports the following two cases of\nflattened blocks to find a block comparison variable for the next block (the cases are then\nsimplified). In the second case, block comparison variable is searched in each block of\nendsWithJcc and nonJcc. If the next block is resolved, the CFG (specifically\nmblock_t::predset and mblock_t::succset) and the destination of goto jump instruction are\nupdated.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24: originally-supported two cases of blocks_\n\nI found and implemented three more cases in the ANEL sample. Of these, two cases are\nshown below:\n\n_Figure 25: newly-supported two cases of blocks_\n\nThe code tracks the block comparison variable in each predecessor and more (if any\nconditional blocks before the predecessor) to identify each next block for unflattening.\n\n\n-----\n\nassigned in the flattened blocks but rather the first blocks according to a condition. For\nexample, the following microcode graph shows edi is assigned to esi (the block\ncomparison variable in this case) in block number 7 but the edi value is assigned in block\nnumber 1 and 2.\n\n_Figure 26: newly-supported case (assigned in first blocks)_\n\nIf the immediate value for block comparison variable is not found in the flattened blocks,\nthe new code tries to trace the first blocks to obtain the value and reconnects block\nnumber 1 and 2 as successors of block number 7, in addition to normal operations\nmentioned in the original cases.\n\nAnother example function did the same processing twice:\n\n_Figure 27: newly-supported case (assigned in first blocks twice #1)_\n\n_Figure 28: newly-supported case (assigned in first blocks twice #2)_\n\nIn this case, the code parses the structure in first blocks then reconnects each conditional\nblocks under the flattened blocks (#1 and #2 as successors of #13, #3 and #4 as\n\n\n-----\n\npredecessor can be a conditional jump like jnz, not just goto. The modified code checks\nthe tail instruction and if the true case destination is a control flow dispatcher, it updates\nthe CFG and the destination of the instruction.\n\n### Other minor changes\n\nThe following changes are minor compared with above referenced ones.\n\nAdditional jump instructions are supported when collecting block comparison\nvariable candidates and mapping between the variable and ea or block number\n(jnz/jle in JZCollector, jnz in JZMapper)\nAn entropy threshold adjustment due to check in high maturity level\nMultiple block tracking for getting block comparison variable\n\nAnd the last change that was introduced in regards to the block update variable referred\nin the overview. Some functions in the ANEL sample utilize this, however the assignment\nis a little bit tricky:\n\n_Figure 29: block update variable usage with and instruction_\n\nBy using the and instruction, the immediate values used in comparison look different from\nassigned ones. The modified code will consider this.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe modified tool was tested with an ANEL 5.4.1 payload dropped from a malicious\ndocument with the following hash (previously reported by [FireEye):](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/09/apt10-targeting-japanese-corporations-using-updated-ttps.html)\n3d2b3c9f50ed36bef90139e6dd250f140c373664984b97a97a5a70333387d18d\n\nThe code is able to deobfuscate 34 of 38 functions (89%). It should be noted every\nfunction is not always obfuscated. The failure examples are:\n\nNot yet implemented cases (e.g., a conditional jump of the dispatcher\npredecessor’s tail instruction in goto N predecessors case, consecutive if-statement\nflattened blocks)\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally there is a known issue with the result (e.g., the remaining loop or paradoxical\ndecompiled code), using the following IDAPython command in Output window:\n\nidc.load_and_run_plugin(“HexRaysDeob”, 0xdead)\n\nThe command will instruct the code to execute only opaque predicates deobfuscation in\nthe current selected function. This allows an analyst to quickly check if there are any lost\nblocks by control flow unflattening. For instance, in one of the failure cases, the\npseudocode changes like this:\n\n_Figure 30: one failure case pseudocode (before)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 31: one failure case pseudocode (after)_\n\nAfter the check, the original result can be restored by using the following command.\n\nidc.load_and_run_plugin(“HexRaysDeob”, 0xf001)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe compiler-level obfuscations like opaque predicates and control flow flattening are\nstarted to be observed in the wild by analyst and researchers. Currently malware with the\nobfuscations is limited, however TAU expects not only APT10 but also other threat actors\nwill start to use them. Unfortunately, in order to break the techniques we have to\nunderstand both of the obfuscation mechanisms and disassembler tool internals before we\ncan automate the process.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe modified code is available publically [here. The summary of the modifications is:](https://github.com/carbonblack/HexRaysDeob)\n\nNew patterns and data-flow tracking for opaque predicates\nAnalysis in multiple maturity levels, considering multiple control flow dispatchers and\nvarious jump cases for control flow flattening\n\nThe tool can work for almost all obfuscated functions in the tested sample.  This\nimplementation will deobfuscate approximately 89% of encountered functions. This\nprovides researchers and analyst broad tool to attack this type of obfuscation, and if it\nadopted in other families. In should be noted that the tool may not work for the updated\nversions of ANEL if they are compiled with different options of the obfuscating compiler.\nTesting in multiple versions is important, so TAU is looking for newer versions ANEL\nsamples. Please reach out to our unit if you have relevant samples or need assistance in\ndeobfuscating the codes.\n\nIt’s difficult to create a generic tool that can defeat every compiler-level obfuscated binary\nbut experience and knowledge about IDA microcode can be useful for additional new\ntools.\n\nTAGS:\nAPT10\n\n/\nCarbon Black TAU\n\n/\nmalware\n\n\n-----",
