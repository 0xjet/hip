MSME sector is considered to**\nbe the backbone of the Indian economy. MSME employs around 40% of the country’s\nworkforce, contributing nearly 45% to manufacturing output and 40% of exports. Staring\nat a major financial resource crunch, MSME’s are worst affected due to the ongoing\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe observed one similar wave on MSME in late April 2020 — it was a phishing campaign\nluring victims with COVID-19 themed maldocs. From this campaign, one prominent file\nwas:\n\nFileName face mask order.doc\n\nMD5 4FC5BA9426E9191AAB4E694E7E703E13\n\nSHA-1 B5EBAF2F5AF220FE1B1DE5433C2E39FF16B0C0B4\n\nSHA-256 2022D9CC42ED2838DAA442561107C29297BDDB88B36222345C10B39164E66819\n\n\nPrevalence\n\n\n300+\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Trend for Gorgon APT sample\n\n## Technical Details\n\nVictims received an email with attached zip “face mask order.zip” which contained the\naforementioned maldoc responsible to drop malware into the victim machine. The attack\nbegins after opening “face mask order.doc”. This RTF is weaponized with exploit which\ntriggers CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.\n\nFigure 2: Process Infection Chain\n\n## CVE-2017-11882 Analysis:\n\nMalicious rtf document contains two malicious ole objects.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: RTF Objects\n\nThe tools extracts the ole objects from RTF file. OLE object (#0) is a VBScript file (i.e.\nServerCrypted.vbs script) and object (#2) contains Equation Editor Exploit and command\nto execute file “CmD.exe /C cscript %tmp%\\ServerCrypted.vbs”.\n\nThe OLE object (#0) is an executable file (i.e. ServerCrypted.vbs script) as shown in figure\n4.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Embedded VBScript\n\nThe class name for this object (#2) is Equation.3 the exploit (CVE-2017-11882) as shown\nin the below image.\n\nFigure 5: RTF contents\n\n\n-----\n\nIt also contains the command to run ServerCrypted.vbs script as shown in below figure 6.\n\nFigure 6: RTF contents\n\nCVE-2017-11882 is present in the Microsoft Office Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE)\ncomponent. The attacker can successfully exploit a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in\nthe equation editor component of MS Office and execute arbitrary code. The root cause of\nthis vulnerability is copy unbounded string of FONT name defined within a FONT record\nstructure of Equation Editor OLE object data.\n\nThe below figure shows the stack buffer overflow scenario while copying the font name\ninto a locally created buffer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Stack buffer overflow scenario\n\nIn this case, the function will return “back” to 0x430c12, which is the address of WinExec,\nand the argument is the “font name” and command which the attacker wants to execute.\n\nFigure 8: Return address, overwritten with WinExec\n\n## VBScript Analysis:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter successful exploitation, cmd.exe is executed with commands:\n\n_“/c cscript %tmp%\\ServerCrypted.vbs >> AC”_\n\nThis command creates a cscript.exe process to execute code in ServerCrypted.vbs.\nVBScript file was already dropped in %temp% folder by WinWord process. Below Figure\nshows the VBScript code. As shown in figure 9 and figure 10, actors used some AVvendors names in function names, variable names, and strings. This VBScript is\nresponsible to execute two processes, cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Figure 10 shows the\nobfuscated PowerShell script.\n\nFigure 9: Contents of ServerCrypted.vbs\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Contents of ServerCrypted.vbs\n\n## PowerShell Analysis:\n\nFigure 11 shows the de-obfuscated PowerShell script.\n\nAs shown below, the script downloads two files with a .jpg extension. First file\n“15882060891.jpg” is a PowerShell script which contains encoded injector DLL written in\nC#, as shown in figure 12. This DLL is loaded in-memory by PowerShell. In this script,\nactors used some interesting names of class and function of injector DLL like FlorianRoth\nand Cyb3rOps. Florian Roth is a well-known security researcher and CTO of Nextron\nSystems. Cyb3rOps is his twitter handle name. The second file which is downloaded by\nPowerShell is “15882060892.jpg”, is an encoded agent tesla payload. This payload is\ninjected in Windows native binary RegAsm.exe.\n\nFigure 11: Decoded PowerShell script\n\nBelow is encoded data of hxxp://www[.]m9c[.]net/uploads/15882060891.jpg. This is a\nPowerShell code and encoded injector DLL data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Contents of 15882060891.jpg\n\nAfter decoding PE header of injector DLL can be seen.\n\nFigure 13: Decoded data of 15882060891.jpg\n\nBelow figure shows contents of hxxp://www[.]m9c[.]net/uploads/15882060892.jpg. It is\nthe encoded data of the final payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: Contents of 15882060892.jpg\n\n## Final Payload – Agent Tesla:\n\nBelow figure shows injected Agent Tesla payload in RegAsm.exe.\n\nFigure 15: Injected payload\n\nAgent Tesla is a well-known keylogger and infostealer written in DotNet. This malware\nsteals information from a variety of applications like Web Browsers, Email Clients, FTP\nClients, Messenger applications, VPN clients, etc. and can also take screenshots of the\nsystem. All stolen data is exfiltrated over SMTP.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have already explored and analysed Agent Tesla in our last couple of blogs:\n\nhttps://www.seqrite.com/blog/advance-campaign-targeting-manufacturing-and-exportsectors-in-india/\n\n[https://www.seqrite.com/blog/coronavirus-themed-campaign/](https://www.seqrite.com/blog/coronavirus-themed-campaign/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMost TTPs shared above, have been seen on several occasions in the last few years.\nLooking at malware, C2 and technique execution, Quick Heal correlates this campaign on\nMSME sector to Gorgon group [a.k.a. Subaat]. All members of the Gorgon cyber-criminal\ngroup purport to have Pakistan-based interests/connections. Recently, another Gorgon\ncampaign was uncovered a few months back which used the same commodity malware\nRATs to accomplish their objective.\n\nGiven the global impact of COVID-19, threat actors will likely continue to use COVID-19themed emails to deliver malware broadly in support of their objectives. Considering this\ntrend, we encourage Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises to apply extra scrutiny to\nCOVID-19-related emails containing attachments. Though large organizations, critical\ngovernment infrastructures, and others have somewhat built resilience to such cyber\nthreats; but MSME still needs to cover-up and remain extra vigilant with a robust strategy\nto mitigate risks.\n\n## Threat Protection\n\nOur Seqrite and Quick Heal line of products protect against top cyber threats including\nMicrosoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) and variants of\nAgent Tesla RAT. Our advanced signature-less behaviour-based detection successfully\nblocks Agent Tesla variants.\n\nQuick Heal advises users to exercise ample caution and avoid opening attachments &\nclicking on web links in unsolicited emails. Users should also keep their Operating System\nupdated and have a full-fledged security solution installed on all devices.\n\nWhile organizations with appropriate spam filtering, proper system administration, and\nup-to-date Windows hosts have a much lower risk of infection, we further encourage\n[organizations to validate the installation of the Microsoft patch for CVE 2017-11882.](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882)\n\nQuick Heal’s research team is proactively monitoring all campaigns targeting MSME’s\nand working relentlessly to ensure the safety of our customers\n\n**Subject matter experts:**\n\nKalpesh Mantri\nBajrang Mane\nPavankumar Chaudhari\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
