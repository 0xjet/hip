In\naddition to damage resulting directly from fire, consequential damages can be\nidentified, which can assume catastrophic proportions in their damage effect\nespecially for Information Technology. Damage resulting from fire-fighting\nwater, for instance, does not occur only at the location of the fire. It can arise\nalso in lower lying areas of the building. During incineration of PVC, chlorine\ngases are produced, which form hydrochloric acid when combined with\nmoisture in the air and water for fire-fighting. When hydrochloric acid vapour\nis disseminated via the air-conditioning system, damage can thus be incurred\nto sensitive electronic devices, located in a very remote part of the building\nfrom the scene of the fire. However, “ordinary” fire smoke can also have a\ndamaging impact on IT-equipment in this way.\n\nNot only negligent handling of fire (e. g. unattended open flames, welding and\nsoldering works), but also improper use of electrical appliances (e. g.\nunattended coffee machine, overloading of multi-socket adapters) can result in\nan outbreak of fire. Technical defects of electrical equipment can lead to a fire\nas well.\n\nThe propagation of fire can be promoted by:\n\n– keeping fire-proof doors open using wedges,\n\n– inappropriate storage of combustible materials (e. g. waste paper),\n\n– failure to follow relevant fire protection standards and instructions,\n\n– lack of fire detection and alarm systems (e. g. smoke detectors),\n\n– missing or unprepared hand-held or automatic fire extinguishers (gas\n\nextinguishing systems),\n\n– inadequate fire prevention facilities (e. g. lack of fire insulation in cable\n\nroutes or use of unsuitable insulating materials for thermal and acoustic\n\n\n-----\n\ninsulation).\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– At the beginning of the 90s a mainframe computer centre in the Frankfurt\n\narea suffered catastrophic fire damage leading to a complete failure.\n\n– It often happens that small electrical appliances, such as coffee machines or\n\ntable lamps, are improperly installed and therefore cause fires.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.2 Unfavourable Climatic Conditions\n\nUnfavourable climatic conditions like heat, frost or high humidity can lead to\na wide variety of damage, like malfunctions in technical components or\ndamage of storage media. Frequent fluctuations of climatic conditions amplify\nthese effects. Unfavourable climatic conditions can also lead to a situation\nwhere people are no longer capable of working or where they are injured or\nput to death.\n\nEvery human being and every technical appliance has a temperature range,\nwithin which normal operation or proper functioning is guaranteed. Whenever\nthe ambient temperature exceeds the lower or the upper limit of this range, it\nmay cause absences from work (stoppages), operational disruptions or device\nfailures.\n\nFor example, electrical energy is converted into heat in a server room owing to\nthe devices inside and thus heating the room up. In cases of insufficient\nventilation, the permissible operating temperature of the devices inside can be\nexceeded. Under solar exposure, the temperature in the room can reach 50\ndegrees Celsius.\n\nFor the purpose of ventilation, windows in server rooms are frequently opened\nwithout permission. In seasonal transition periods with major temperature\nfluctuations (spring, autumn), this can result in exceeding the permissible air\nhumidity due to severe cooling.\n\nWhen storing digital long-term storage media, excessive fluctuations of\ntemperature or a too high humidity level can lead to data errors or a reduced\ndata retention period. Some manufacturers state that the optimum storage\nconditions for long-term storage media are temperatures ranging from 20 to\n22°C and an air humidity of 40%. Also, analogue media like paper or\nmicrofilms require certain storage conditions. If, for instance, paper is stored\nin too humid a place, it can get mouldy or disintegrate.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– In cases of high temperatures during the summer and inadequate cooling of\n\nIT equipment, temperature-dependent failures can occur.\n\n– Too much dust in IT systems can lead to a build-up of heat.\n\n– Too high temperatures can cause demagnetisation of magnetic data storage\n\nmedia.\n\n\nIT systems as heating\n\nDefects in long-term\n\nstorage media\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.3 Water\n\nWater can affect the integrity and availability of information stored on\nanalogue and digital data storage media. Also information in the RAM of IT\nsystems is at risk. An uncontrolled admission of water into a building or into\nrooms can, for instance, result from:\n\n– disruptions in the water supply or sewage disposal,\n\n– defective heating system,\n\n– defective air-conditioning systems with a water supply,\n\n– defective sprinkler systems,\n\n– water used during a fire-fighting operation and\n\n– water sabotage e. g. performed by opening taps and blocking drains.\n\nRegardless of how water enters into the building or into rooms, it entails the\nrisk that supply facilities or IT components will be damaged and taken out of\noperation (a short circuit, mechanical damage, rust, etc.). Especially if central\nsupply facilities of the building (main power distributor, telephone, and data)\nare housed in basement rooms without automatic drainage, The ingress of\nwater can cause extremely high losses.\n\nIn addition, problems resulting from frost can arise. For example in frostendangered areas, pipes can start to leak if water stands still inside them,\naccompanied by persistent frost. Even existing thermal insulation will also be\novercome by frost in time.\n\n**Example:**\n\n– In a server room, there was a water pipe running beneath the ceiling which\n\nwas covered with plasterboard panels. When a coupling in the water pipe\nstarted to leak, this was not recognised in time. At first the leaking water\ncollected in the deepest point of the cladding, before it flowed out and\ncaused a short circuit in the power distributor attached underneath. As a\nconsequence until it was finally repaired, both water and power supplies of\nthe corresponding part of the building had to be switched off completely.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.4 Pollution, Dust, Corrosion\n\nBesides electronics, many IT devices contain mechanical components, such as\nhard drives and removable disks, DVD drives, printers, scanners etc. and\ncoolers for CPUs and power supply units also. With increasing quality and\nspeed requirements, these devices must function more and more precisely.\nEven small amounts of pollution can lead to disruption of a device. Dust and\npollution in significant amounts can for example be generated by the\nfollowing activities:\n\n– repairs on walls, raised floors (double floors) or other building parts,\n\n– hardware upgrades or similar work\n\n– packaging (e. g. Styrofoam particles)\n\nExisting safety circuits in the equipment usually ensure a timely switching off\nthe device. This restricts the direct damage to the affected device, keeps the\nrepair costs low and the downtimes short, but the affected device remains\nunavailable during down-time.\n\nIn addition, equipment and infrastructure can be damaged by corrosion. This\ncan have a negative impact not only on IT but even on the safety of buildings.\n\nCorrosion can also indirectly lead to further risks. For example, when water\nflows out of corroded water pipes (see T 0.3 Water).\n\nAltogether, pollution, dust or corrosion can therefore lead to failure of or\ndamage to IT components and supply facilities. As a consequence, proper\ninformation processing can be impaired.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– After installation of a server in a media room, together with a photocopier\n\nand a fax machine, errors within the CPU cooler and the power supply fan\noccurred successively due to the high dust level in the room. The breakdown\nof the CPU cooler led to sporadic server crashes. The breakdown of the\npower supply fan finally led to an overheating of the power supply unit\nresulting in a short circuit, which eventually entailed a total failure of the\nserver.\n\n– To hang up a blackboard in an office, holes were drilled into the wall by the\n\nsite technical service. During this, the office employee had left his office for\na short time. After he returned to his workplace he noticed that his PC no\nlonger functioned. The reason for this was the ingress of dust from drilling\ninto the PC power supply unit through the ventilation slits.\n\n\nDust interferes with\n\nelectronics\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.5 Natural Disasters\n\nWith natural disasters natural changes are meant which have a devastating\nimpact on people and infrastructures. Causes for a natural disaster can be\nseismic, climatic or volcanic phenomena such as earthquakes, floods,\nlandslides, tsunamis, avalanches and volcanic eruptions. Examples of extreme\nmeteorological phenomena are thunderstorms, hurricanes or cyclones.\nDepending on its location, the institution is exposed to these risks stemming\nfrom various types of natural disasters to a greater or lesser degree.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– In the case of computing centres in flood-endangered areas, there is a\n\nparticular danger of water entering into the building in an uncontrolled\nmanner (flooding or phreatic rise).\n\n– The frequency of earthquakes and hence the risk accompanying them\n\ndepends strongly on the geographical location.\n\n– Extremely high solar activity has in the past repeatedly led to impairments\n\nof telecommunications infrastructures and the energy supply.\n\nIndependent of the type of natural disaster, even in areas not directly affected\nby it, the danger exists that supply facilities, communication links or IT\ncomponents will be damaged or put out of operation. In particular, the failure\nof the central supply facilities of the building (main power distributor,\ntelephone, data) can cause very high losses. Access to the infrastructure by the\nmaintenance and service staff can be impeded due to extensive restricted\nareas.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– Many commercial enterprises, also large companies, do not take the threat\n\nof floods into account adequately. There is a company which has been\n“surprised” by flood damage in their computing centre several times\nalready. The computing centre literally swam away after flood damage for\nthe second time within 14 months. The loss incurred amounted to several\nhundred thousand Euros and this has not been covered by insurance.\n\n– An IT system has been installed at a site with a geographic location well\nknown for a volcanic activity (intermittent phenomenon, where volcanic\nemission phases alternate with somewhat long resting phases).\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.6 Environmental Disasters\n\nA public body or a company can suffer damage when a serious accident\nhappens in its environment, for instance, a fire, an explosion, a release of\npoisonous substances or a dangerous radiation leak. Therefore, the danger is\nnot only due to the event itself but often to activities resulting there from, for\nexample access restrictions and rescue measures.\n\nThe property of an institution can be exposed to a variety of threats originating\nfrom the environment, among other things from traffic (streets, rail, air, and\nwater), neighbouring companies or residential areas.\n\nEven preventative or rescue measures can affect the property directly. Such\nmeasures can also lead to a situation where employees cannot reach their\nworkplace or staff must be evacuated. However, the complexity of site\ntechnical service and IT infrastructure can also give rise to indirect problems.\n\n**Example:**\n\n– Due to a fire outbreak in a chemical plant in the immediate proximity of a\n\ncomputing centre (approx. 1000 m as the crow flies), a large cloud of smoke\narose. The computing centre had an air conditioning and ventilation system\nwhich did not have any external air monitoring. Thanks only to the attention\nof an employee (the accident happened during working hours) who observed\nthe emergence and spreading of the cloud, the external air supply could be\nmanually switched off.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.7 Major Events in the Environment\n\nMajor events of every kind can impede the proper operation of a public body\nor a company. They include amongst other things street festivals, concerts,\nsporting events, industrial action or demonstrations. Riots in connection with\nsuch events can have additional consequences, like intimidation of employees\nup to the use of force against the staff or the building.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– During the hot summer months, a demonstration took place nearby a\n\ncomputing centre. The situation escalated resulting in violence. In a side\nstreet, a window of the computing centre area was still opened, through\nwhich a demonstrator gained access and used the opportunity to steal\nhardware with important data stored on it.\n\n– During the construction of a big funfair, electric cables were cut by mistake.\n\nThis led to a failure in a computing centre connected through it. This failure\nhowever, could be backed-up by the emergency power supply.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.8 Failure or Disruption of the Power Supply\n\nIn spite of high security of supply in the electricity sector, interruptions to the\npower supply on behalf of the distribution network operators or energy supply\ncompanies continue to occur. The majority of these disruptions are so short,\nwith times of less than one second, that a human does not notice them. But\ninterruptions of more than even 10 ms are capable of disrupting IT operation.\nHowever, besides disruptions in the supply networks, also shut-downs caused\nby unheralded works or cable damage due to civil engineering work, can lead\nto power failures.\n\nIt is not only those obvious, direct consumers of power (PC, lighting etc.)\nwhich are dependent on the power supply. Many infrastructure facilities\ndepend on electric power today, e. g. lifts, air-conditioning devices, alarm\nsystems, security gates, automatic door locking and sprinkler systems. Even\nthe water supply in skyscrapers is power-dependent because of pumps in the\nupper floors required for producing pressure. Prolonged power outages\nresulting in failure of the infrastructure facilities can lead to a situation where\nno activity can be undertaken on these premises any more.\n\nBesides failures, other disruptions of the power supply can impair the\noperation also. Voltage spikes can, for example, lead to malfunctions or even\ndamage of the electrical equipment.\n\nIn addition it has to be taken into account that sometimes failures or\ndisruptions of the power supply in the neighbourhood can affect one's own\nbusiness processes, if access routes are blocked for instance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– Due to an error in the uninterrupted power supply unit of a computing\n\ncentre, the unit was unable to return to normal operation after a short power\nfailure. After discharging of its batteries (which took about 40 minutes) all\ncomputers in the respective server hall failed.\n\n– At the beginning of 2001 in California there was a power supply crisis for\n\nmore than 40 days. The power supply situation there was so tense that the\nCalifornian Independent System Operator ordered rotating power cuts. Not\nonly households but also the high-tech industry was affected by these power\ncuts which lasted up to 90 minutes. Since during the power failure alarm\nsystems and surveillance cameras were also turned off, the energy suppliers\nkept their shut-down schedule secret.\n\n– In November 2005 many communities in Lower Saxony and North Rhine\nWestphalia remained without a power supply for days after intense snowfall,\nbecause many pylons were knocked over by the load of snow and ice. The\nrecovery of the power supply took several days.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.9 Failure or Disruption of Communication Networks\n\nMany business processes nowadays require at the very least intact\ncommunication connections, be it telephone, fax, email or other services using\nlocal or wide area networks. If one or more of these communication\nconnections are not available over a longer period of time, the result can, for\nexample, be that:\n\n– Business processes cannot be continued any longer because the required\n\ninformation cannot be retrieved,\n\n– Customers cannot contact the institution for inquiries any more,\n\n– Orders cannot be commissioned or completed.\n\nIf time-critical applications are run on IT systems which are connected via\nwide area networks, the possible losses and consequential damages due to a\nnetwork failure are correspondingly high if no alternatives (e. g. connection to\nanother communications network) are available.\n\nSimilar problems can arise if the required communications networks are\ndisturbed even though they have not completely failed. Communication links\ncan show increased error rates or other quality shortcomings for example.\nWrong configuration parameters also can lead to impairments.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– For many institutions the Internet has become an indispensable\n\ncommunication medium today, for the retrieval of important information,\nfor representation purposes and for communication with customers and\npartners, amongst other things. Companies specialising in Internet-based\nservices are of course eminently dependent on an operating Internet\nconnection in particular.\n\n– Benefiting from convergence of networks, voice and data services are\n\nfrequently transmitted over the same technical components (e. g. VoIP).\nThis however, increases the danger that at a disruption in communication\ntechnology leads to a failure of both voice and data services.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.10 Failure or Disruption of Mains Supply\n\nIn a building there are a variety of networks used for basic supply and disposal\nservices and, as such, form a basis for all of an institution's business processes,\nincluding IT. Examples of such supply networks are:\n\n– power,\n\n– telephone,\n\n– cooling,\n\n– heating or ventilation,\n\n– water and sewage,\n\n– supply of fire fighting water,\n\n– gas,\n\n– alarm and control systems (e. g. for burglary, fire, housekeeping control\n\nengineering) and\n\n– intercoms.\n\nA failure or disruption of a supply network can lead to a situation where,\namongst other things, people cannot work in the building any more or IT\noperation and hence information processing is impaired.\n\nCertain networks are dependent on each other to varying degrees so that\noperational disruptions in individual networks can also have an effect on\nothers.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– A failure of heating or ventilation can have the consequence that all\n\nconcerned employees must leave the buildings. This can, under certain\ncircumstances, result in high losses.\n\n– The failure of a power supply does not only directly affect IT but also all\n\nother networks which are equipped with electrical automatic controls. Even\nin sewage lines, electrical lifting pumps are used in some circumstances.\n\n– A failure of the water supply may affect the proper function of air\nconditioning systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.11 Failure or Disruption of Service Providers\n\nHardly any institution today operates without service providers like\nsubcontractors or outsourcing providers. If organisational units are dependent\non service providers, their performance can be impaired due to the absence of\nexternal services. A partial or complete outage of an outsourcing service\nprovider or a subcontractor can have a considerable effect on operational\ncontinuity, particularly in the case of critical business processes. There are\ndifferent reasons for such outages, for example insolvency, unilateral\ntermination of contract by the service provider or subcontractor, operational\nproblems due to forces of nature or shortfall of personnel for example.\nProblems can also arise if the services rendered by the service provider do not\ncorrespond to the quality requirements of the contractor.\n\nIn addition, it has to be taken into account that service providers also\nfrequently resort to subcontractors to make their services available to the\ncontractor. Disruptions, quality defects and failures on the part of the\nsubcontractors can thus indirectly lead to impairments in relation to the\ncontractor.\n\nThe contractor’s business processes can also be impaired by failures of the\nservice provider’s IT systems or communication connections.\n\nCeasing to outsource service processes, if it proves necessary, can be\nconsiderably complicated, because the outsourced procedures are not\nadequately documented or because the former service provider does not\nsupport this realignment, for instance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– A company has installed its servers in a computing centre of an external\n\nservice provider. After a fire in this computing centre, the finance\ndepartment of the company was no longer capable of working. It resulted in\nconsiderable financial losses for the company.\n\n– The just-in-time production of a company’s products was dependent on the\n\nsubcontracted supply of material from external service providers. After a\nprovider’s lorry failed due to a defect, the delivery of parts urgently required\nwas drastically delayed. This way, a number of customers could not receive\ntheir deliveries, timely.\n\n– A banking institute handled all monetary transports using a cash-in-transit\n\ncompany. The latter company surprisingly declared itself bankrupt. The\nagreement and route planning with a new valuables carrier took several\ndays. This led to considerable problems and time delays in cash supply to\nand collections from the affected branches of the bank.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.12 Interfering Radiation\n\nToday, information technology consists of electronic components to a large\nextent. Although optical transmission technology is increasingly in use,\ncomputers, network coupling elements and storage systems, for example, still\ngenerally contain many electronic components. Due to electromagnetic\ninterference having an effect on such components, electronic devices can be\nimpaired in their function or even damaged. As a consequence, disruptions,\nwrong processing results or communication errors can occur, among other\nfailures.\n\nWireless communication can also be impaired by interfering radiation. In this\ncase, a sufficiently strong disruption of the used frequency bands is enough in\ncertain circumstances.\n\nFurthermore, information which is saved on data storage media of certain\ntypes can, when under influence of interfering radiation, be deleted or\ndistorted. This refers in particular to magnetically sensitive data storage media\n(hard disks, magnetic tapes etc.) and semiconductor memory. Damage to such\ndata storage media due to interfering radiation is also possible.\n\nThere are many different sources of electromagnetic fields or radiation, for\nexample wireless networks (such as WLAN), Bluetooth, GSM, UMTS etc.,\npermanent magnets and cosmic radiation. In addition, every electric device\nemits electromagnetic waves of varying strength, which can spread amongst\nothers via air and along metallic conductors (e. g. cables, air conditioning\nducts, heating pipes etc.).\n\nIn Germany, regulations in this subject area are stated in the Act for the\nElectromagnetic Compatibility of Resources (EMVT - Gesetz über die\nelektromagnetische Verträglichkeit von Betriebsmitteln).\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.13 Intercepting Compromising Emissions\n\nElectrical devices emit electromagnetic waves. In cases of equipment which\nprocess information (e. g. computers, displays, network coupling elements,\nprinters) this radiation can also carry the information currently being\nprocessed with it. Such information-bearing radiation is called expositional or\ncompromising emissions. An attacker, for example in a neighbouring house or\nin a vehicle parked in the proximity, can try to intercept this radiation and to\nreconstruct the processed information carried there. The confidentiality of the\ninformation is this way called into question. A possible motive for such an\nattack is industrial espionage.\n\nThe limiting values in the Act for the Electromagnetic Compatibility of\nResources (EMVG) generally do not suffice to prevent interception of the\ncompromising emissions. If this risk cannot be accepted, additional protective\nmeasures must therefore be taken.\n\nCompromising emissions are not restricted to electromagnetic waves. Useful\ninformation can sometimes be retrieved from sound waves produced by\nprinters or keyboards, for example.\n\nIn addition, it has to be taken into account that compromising emissions can\nbe, in some cases, caused or amplified by the external manipulation of\ndevices. If a device is exposed to radiation with electromagnetic waves, it may\noccur that the reflected waves carry confidential information.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.14 Interception of Information / Espionage\n\nEspionage is defined as attacks aimed at collecting, evaluating and presenting\ninformation about companies, people, products or other target objects. The\npresented information may then be used, for example, to provide certain\ncompetitive advantages to another company, blackmail people or build a copy\nof a product.\n\nIn addition to a variety of technically complex attacks, there are often also\nmuch simpler methods for gaining valuable information, for example by\nbringing together information from several publicly accessible sources, which\nlooks like harmless information in isolation, but can be compromising in other\ncontexts. Since confidential data is frequently not sufficiently protected, this\ncan often be intercepted using visual, acoustic or electronic ways.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– Many IT systems are protected against unauthorised access by identification\n\nand authentication mechanisms, e. g. in the form of user name and password\nverification. If the password is transmitted over the wire in an unencrypted\nform, it is under certain circumstances possible for an attacker to retrieve it.\n\n– To be able to withdraw money out of an automatic teller machine, the\n\ncorrect PIN for the used electronic cash card or credit card must be entered.\nUnfortunately, the visual protection available for this equipment is\nfrequently insufficient, so that an attacker can look over the shoulder of a\ncustomer entering the pin without much effort. If the attacker steals the card\nafterwards, he can plunder the account this way.\n\n– To receive access rights to a PC or to otherwise manipulate it, an attacker\n\ncan send the user a Trojan Horse which he has enclosed within an email as a\nsupposedly useful programme.\n\n– In many offices, workplaces are not sufficiently protected in terms of\n\nacoustics. As a consequence, colleagues and also visitors could possibly\nlisten to conversations and come to know information which is not meant for\nthem or is even confidential.\n\n\nuncrypted password\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.15 Eavesdropping\n\nTargeted attacks on communication connections, conversations, noise sources\nof all kinds or IT systems with the objective of collecting information are\nreferred to as eavesdropping. It ranges from unnoticed, surreptitious\neavesdropping on a conversation to highly specialised complex attacks in\norder to intercept signals transmitted over radio or transmission lines, e. g.\nwith the help of antennae or sensors.\n\nIt is not only because of the low chance of discovery that wiretapping of lines\nor eavesdropping on wireless connections is a considerable threat for\ninformation security. In principle, there are no tap-proof cables. It is only the\neffort required by the eavesdropper that distinguishes the security of cables.\nWhether a line is actually wiretapped can only be ascertained through high\nmetrological effort.\n\nParticularly critical is the unprotected transmission of authentication data in\nplain-text protocols like HTTP, FTP or telnet, since they can easily be\nanalysed automatically due to the clear structure of the data.\n\nThe decision to eavesdrop on information somewhere is in principle\ndetermined by the question of whether the information is worth the respective\ntechnical or financial effort and the risk of being discovered. The answer to\nthis question essentially depends on the individual possibilities and interests of\nthe attacker.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– In the case of telephone calls, it is not only eavesdropping on conversations\n\nthat can be of interest to an attacker. The information which is transmitted in\nsignalling can be misused by an attacker as well e. g. due to an incorrect\nsetting in the terminal resulting in the password being transmitted in plain\ntext at the time of login.\n\n– An attacker can easily eavesdrop on the entire communication if wireless\n\ntransmission is unprotected or insufficiently protected (e. g. if a WLAN is\nprotected only with WEP).\n\n– Emails can be read throughout their entire journey through the network if\n\nthey are not encrypted. Unencrypted emails should therefore not be\ncompared with conventional letters but with postcards.\n\n\nEavesdropping on\n\nconversations\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.16 Theft of Devices, Storage Media and Documents\n\nThe theft of data storage media, IT systems, accessories, software or data, on\nthe one hand results in costs for the replacement and restoring operational\nstatus. On the other hand, there are losses due to lack of availability. If\nconfidential information is disclosed due to theft, this can result in further\ndamage. Besides servers and other expensive IT systems, also mobile IT\nsystems, which are unobtrusively and easily  transported, are frequently\nstolen. However, there are also cases in which data storage media like\ndocuments or USB-Sticks were purposefully stolen to access confidential\ninformation stored there.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– A notebook computer disappeared from the U.S. Department of State in the\n\nspring of 2000. In an official statement, it was not ruled out that the device\ncould contain confidential information. Nor was there information given as\nto whether the device was protected by cryptographic or other measures\nagainst unauthorised access.\n\n– A German Federal Office was repeatedly broken into through the same\n\nunsecured windows. Mobile IT systems disappeared along with other\nvaluables. It could not be ruled out without a doubt that files were copied or\nmanipulated.\n\n– There were a number of data leaks in Great Britain, in which confidential\n\ndocuments were disclosed because data storage media were stolen. In one\ncase, several computer hard disks were stolen from the British Air Force\nwhich contained personal information, collected by employees for security\nscreening purposes.\n\n– An employee of a call centre prepared copies of a large set of confidential\n\ncustomer data shortly before he had to leave the company. After leaving the\ncompany, he then sold this data to competitors. Since details about the\nincident were then published by the press, the call centre lost many\nimportant customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.17 Loss of Devices, Storage Media and Documents\n\nThere are a variety of causes that can lead to a loss of equipment, data storage\nmedia or documents. Directly, availability is a concern. But it may also mean\nthat confidential information falls into the wrong hands if the data storage\nmedia have not been completely encrypted. The replacement of equipment or\ndata storage media incurs costs, but also if they emerge again, information can\nbe disclosed or unwanted programmes can reside in them.\n\nMobile terminal equipment and mobile data storage media can be particularly\neasily lost. Today, on small memory cards, gigantic amounts of data can be\nstored. However, it also happens again and again that printed documents are\ninadvertently left somewhere, for example in restaurants or on public\ntransport.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– An employee uses the journey in the tramway to her workplace to read over\n\nsome documents. When getting off the tram in a hurry at her destination\nstop, she leaves the documents inadvertently on her neighbouring place.\nAlthough the documents are not confidential, several signatures of highprofile executives must nevertheless be collected once again as a\nconsequence.\n\n– At a major event, while searching through his briefcase, an employee\n\ninadvertently drops a memory card with confidential calculations on the\nground without noticing. The finder views its contents on his laptop and\nsells the information to the competition.\n\n– A manufacturer sends CDs with software updates for bug fixing by post to\n\nhis customers. Some of these CDs are lost in the post. Neither the sender nor\nthe recipients are informed about it. As a consequence, the effected\ncustomers experience malfunctions in the software.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.18 Bad Planning or Lack of Adaption\n\nIf organisational processes serving direct or indirect information processing\nare not properly designed, it can lead to security problems. Although every\nsingle process step is carried out correctly, damage often occurs because\nprocesses altogether are defined in an improper way.\n\nAnother possible reason for security problems is dependency on other\nprocesses which do not have any apparent relation to information processing.\nSuch dependencies can be easily disregarded during planning and trigger\nimpairments during operation.\n\nIn addition, security problems can arise when tasks, roles or responsibility are\nnot clearly assigned. This may cause, amongst other things, processes to be\ndelayed, security procedures to be neglected or regulations to be disregarded.\n\nA danger arises when equipment, products, procedures or other means for\nimplementation of information processing are not deployed properly. The\nchoice of unsuitable products or weak points in application architecture or in\nnetwork design for instance, can lead to security problems.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– If maintenance or repair processes are not designed to meet technical\n\nrequirements, unacceptable downtimes can occur as a consequence.\n\n– An increased risk can arise from attacks on one's own IT systems if security\n\nrequirements are not taken into account in the procurement of information\ntechnology.\n\n– If required consumable material is not made available on time, the IT\n\nprocedures dependent on it can come to a halt.\n\n– Weak points can arise if, at the planning stage of an IT procedure, unsuitable\n\ntransfer protocols are selected.\n\nInformation technology and the complete environment of a public body or a\ncompany continually change. Be it that employees leave or join, new\nhardware or software is procured or a supplier declares itself bankrupt. If the\nsubsequent necessary organisational and technical adaptations are not taken\ninto consideration or are considered only inadequately, threats may follow.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– Due to structural changes in the building, existing escape routes have been\n\nchanged. Since the employees were not sufficiently informed, the building\ncannot be evacuated in the required time.\n\n– When transferring electronic documents, it has been disregarded to use a\n\ndata format readable for the recipient.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.19 Disclosure of Sensitive Information\n\nConfidential data and information should only be accessible to the persons\nentitled to receive such information. Next to integrity and availability,\nconfidentiality belongs to the basic parameters of information security. For\nconfidential information (like passwords, personal data, official or trade\nsecrets, development data) there exists an inherent danger that these are\ndisclosed by technical failure, carelessness or also by deliberate actions.\n\nThis confidential information can be accessed in differing forms, for example:\n\n– on storage media within computers (hard disks),\n\n– on movable storage media (USB sticks, CDs or DVDs),\n\n– in printed form on paper (print outs, files) and on transmission paths during\n\ndata transmission.\n\nThe way how information is disclosed also can vary widely, for example:\n\n– unauthorised access to read files,\n\n– inadvertent dissemination e. g. in the course of repair orders,\n\n– inadequate deletion or destruction of data storage media,\n\n– theft of data storage media and subsequent data perusal,\n\n– eavesdropping on transmission lines,\n\n– infection of IT systems with malicious software,\n\n– intercepting by viewing data on screen or eavesdropping on conversations\n\nDisclosure of sensitive information can have serious consequences for an\ninstitution. Loss of confidentiality can among other things lead to the\nfollowing negative impact on an institution:\n\n– violation of laws, for example data protection and banking secrecy,\n\n– negative interior effects, for example demoralisation of the employees,\n\n– negative exterior effects, for example impairment of the relations to business\n\npartners, lost confidence of customers,\n\n– financial consequences, for example claims for compensation, fines,\n\nlitigation costs\n\n– impairment of the informational right of self-determination.\n\nA loss of confidentiality is not always immediately noticed. Often, it turns out\nonly later that unauthorised persons have obtained access to confidential\ninformation, e. g. by press inquiries.\n\n**Example:**\n\n– Buyers of second-hand computers, hard disks, mobile telephones or similar\n\nequipment repeatedly find highly confidential information stored on them,\nlike medical records or account numbers.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.20 Information or Products from an Unreliable Source\n\nIf information, software or equipment is used which comes from unreliable\nsources or whose origin and correctness were not sufficiently verified, their\ndeployment can pose high risks. It can lead to business relevant information\nresting in the wrong database, calculations providing wrong results or wrong\ndecisions being made, among other things. Also, integrity and availability of\nIT systems can be affected thereby.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– A recipient of emails, the origin of which has not been verified, can be\n\nencouraged to carry out certain actions which have an adverse effect on\nhimself or others. For example, the email may contain interesting\nattachments or links, which when clicked upon install malicious software on\nthe recipient’s computer. The sender of the email can be falsified or it can\nimitate a familiar communication partner.\n\n– An assumption that a statement is true because it is \"published in the\n\nnewspaper\" or \"was shown on TV\" is not always justified. Wrong\nstatements can be incorporated into business critical reports in this way.\n\n– The reliability of information which is spread via the Internet differs greatly.\n\nIf statements are accepted from the Internet without further source\nverification, wrong decisions can result from this.\n\n– If updates or patches are downloaded and installed from untrustworthy\n\nsources, it can lead to unwanted side effects. There is an increased threat\nthat IT systems get infected with a harmful code, if the origin of software is\nnot verified.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.21 Manipulation of Hardware or Software\n\nManipulation is defined as any form of targeted but secret intervention aiming\nto change target objects of all kinds in an unnoticed way. Manipulation of\nhardware or software can be performed, in, amongst other situations, when\nbeing influenced by desire of vengeance, to deliberately generate damage, to\nobtain personal advantages or gain. It can focus on all kinds of devices,\naccessories, data storage media (e. g. DVDs, USB sticks), applications and\ndatabases or the like.\n\nManipulation of hardware and software does not always lead to a direct loss.\nHowever, if such processed information is impaired, this can lead to all types\nof security implications (loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability).\nManipulations can thereby be all the more effective the later they are\ndiscovered, the more extensive the knowledge the perpetrators have, and by\nhow much more profound the effects on a work process would be. The effects\nrange from the unauthorized inspection of sensitive data to even destruction of\ndata storage media or IT systems. Manipulation can thus also result in\nconsiderable downtimes.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– In a Swiss financial company, an employee had manipulated the software\n\nused for certain financial services. This made it possible for him to illegally\ngain large amounts of money.\n\n– By manipulating ATMs, attackers succeeded several times to illegally read\n\nthe data stored on payment cards. In conjunction with PINs spied out, this\ndata was then misused to withdraw money at the expense of the cardholder.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.22 Manipulation of Information\n\nInformation can be manipulated in various ways, e. g. by incorrect or\nintentionally false recording of data, any change to the contents of database\nfields or via correspondence. In principle, this concerns not only digital\ninformation, but for example documents in paper form also. A perpetrator can,\nhowever, only manipulate the information to which he has access. The more\naccess rights to files and directories of IT systems a person has or the more\npossibilities to access information he has, the more significant manipulations\nhe can carry out. If the manipulations are not detected early, the smooth\nprogress of business processes and professional tasks can thus be seriously\ndisrupted.\n\nArchived documents usually contain sensitive information. The manipulation\nof such documents is particularly serious because, under certain\ncircumstances, it may take years before the manipulation is noticed and\nverification will often no longer be possible.\n\nManipulation of information can be performed when being influenced by the\ndesire for vengeance, to deliberately generate damage or to obtain personal\nadvantages or enrichment, amongst other reasons.\n\n**Example:**\n\n– An employee was so annoyed at the promotion of her roommate in the\n\naccounting department that during the short absence of her colleague, she\nillegally gained access to her computer. Here she has caused, by changing\nsome figures in the monthly balance sheet, enormous negative impact on the\npublished financial results of the company.\n\n\nVarious motives\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.23 Unauthorised Access to IT Systems\n\nIn principle, each interface of an IT system includes not only the possibility to\nlegally use particular services of this IT system pertaining to this interface, but\nalso the risk of unauthorised access to the IT system via this interface.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– If a user ID and password have been spied out, any unauthorised use of the\n\napplications or IT systems protected by them is well possible.\n\n– Using inadequately safeguarded remote maintenance access, hackers could\n\ngain unauthorised access to IT systems.\n\n– When interfaces of active network components are inadequately\n\nsafeguarded, it is possible that an attacker gains unauthorised access to the\nnetwork component. If they also manage to overcome the local security\nmechanisms, e. g. obtain administrative privileges, they could perform all\nadministrative activities.\n\n– Many IT systems have interfaces for the use of interchangeable data storage,\n\nsuch as extra memory cards or USB storage media. In an unattended IT\nsystem with the corresponding hardware and software, there is a risk that\nlarge amounts of data can be retrieved or malicious software can be\nintroduced this way.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.24 Destruction of Devices or Storage Media\n\nExternal and also internal perpetrators can, for different reasons (revenge,\nmalice, frustration), try to destroy equipment, accessories, documents and\nother data storage media (e. g. DVDs, USB sticks) or similar media. The\ndestruction of data storage media or IT systems can result in significant\ndowntimes for business processes.\n\nDue to negligence, improper use and also by untrained handling, destruction\nof devices and data storage media may occur which seriously impairs the\noperation of IT systems.\n\nThere is also a risk that, along with destruction, important information will be\nlost, which cannot be reconstructed at all or only with great effort.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– In a company an internal perpetrator used his knowledge about an important\n\nserver being sensitive to too high operating temperatures and blocked the\nventilation slits for the power supply fan using an object hidden behind the\nserver. Two days later, the hard drive in the server suffered a temperaturecaused defect, and the server was down for several days.\n\n– An employee was upset about the repeated crashes of his system so much\n\nthat he let out his anger on his workstation. Here, as the computer was being\nkicked, the hard drive was so badly damaged that it was useless. The data\nstored there could only be partially reconstructed from a backup made the\nprevious day.\n\n– Humidity ingressing into an IT system, due to knocked-over coffee cups or\n\nwatering the flowers can cause short circuits.\n\n\nVarious motives\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.25 Failure of Devices or Systems\n\nThe failure of a single component of an IT system can lead to a failure of the\nentire IT operation and hence to the failure of critical business processes. In\nparticular, key components of an IT system for example, servers and network\ncoupling elements, are likely to cause such failures. A failure of individual\ncomponents of the technical infrastructure, such as air-conditioning or power\nsupply facilities, may contribute to a failure of the entire information network\nas well.\n\nThe reason for a failure of an IT system is not always technical malfunction\n(e. g. T 0.8 Failure or disruption of the power supply). Failures can often be\nattributed to human error (e. g. T 0.24 Destruction of devices or storage\nmedia) or intentional acts (e. g. T 0.16 Theft of devices, storage media and\ndocuments, T 0.41 Sabotage). Also, lack of maintenance, for example due to\nabsence of maintenance personnel, can lead to technical failure. Force majeure\n(such as fire, lightning, chemical accidents) can also cause damage, but this\ndamage is usually many times higher.\n\nIf time-critical applications run on an IT system without any alternatives, the\nconsequential damages after a system outage is respectively high.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– Firmware has been installed on an IT system which is not designed for this\n\ntype of system. The IT system will then no longer start without errors and\nmust be made operational by the manufacturer.\n\n– A power failure in a memory system at the site of an Internet Service\n\nProvider (ISP) resulted in having to switch it off. Although the actual error\ncould be corrected quickly, the affected IT systems could not start again due\nto inconsistencies in the file system. As a result, several Web servers\noperated by the ISP were not available for days.\n\n\nFailure of central\n\ncomponents\n\nTechnical failure / Human\n\nerror\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.26 Malfunction of Devices or Systems\n\nDevices and systems that serve for information processing, today often have\nmany functions and are therefore of accordingly complex design. This applies\ngenerally to both hardware and software components. Due to this complexity,\nthere are many different sources of error in such components. As a\nconsequence, it happens that devices and systems do not function as they were\nintended to and this gives rise to security problems.\n\nThere are many causes of malfunctions, such as material fatigue,\nmanufacturing tolerances, design weaknesses, exceeded limits, unintended\nconditions of use or lack of maintenance for instance. Since there are no\nperfect devices and systems some residual probability of malfunctions must\nalways be accepted.\n\nA malfunction of a device or system can affect all the basic parameters of\ninformation security (confidentiality, integrity, availability). In addition,\nmalfunctions may under certain circumstances remain unnoticed for a longer\nperiod. It may therefore happen that, for example, calculation results are false\nand not corrected in time.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– A blocked ventilation grid causes overheating of a storage system, which\n\ndoes not fail completely, but just malfunctions sporadically after that. It has\nbeen noticed only a few weeks later that the information stored there is\nincomplete.\n\n– A scientific standard application is used to perform a statistical analysis of\n\npreviously collected data stored in a database. According to the\ndocumentation, the application does not support the database product\nconcerned. The analysis seems to work, spot-checks however show that the\ncalculated results are wrong. The reason for the problem was identified as\nincompatibility between the application and the database.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.27 Lack of Resources\n\nIf the available resources in a given area are insufficient, bottlenecks may\noccur in the supply serviced by these resources or even congestion and\nfailures. Depending on the type of resources concerned, even a small event\nthat was actually predicted to happen, can in the end affect a large amount of\nbusiness processes. Lack of resources may occur in IT operations and\ncommunications, but also in other areas of an institution. This can lead to a\nvariety of negative effects if for certain tasks, insufficient personnel, time and\nfinancial resources are made available. It can happen, for example, that the\nnecessary roles in projects are not filled with qualified people. If resources\nsuch as hardware or software do not sufficiently meet the requirements, under\ncertain circumstances technical tasks cannot be successfully processed.\n\nPersonnel, time, financial, technical and other shortages in normal operation\ncan often be compensated for, for a limited period however. Under extreme\ntime pressure though, for example in emergency situations, they become even\nmore obvious.\n\nResources can also be deliberately overloaded, if someone intentionally\ngenerates an intense need for a resource and thus provokes an intense and\npersistent impairment of this resource (see also T 0.40 Denial of Service).\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– Overloaded electrical wires heat up which, in an unfavourable installation\n\nlayout, can lead to smouldering.\n\n– When new applications in the network have higher bandwidth requirements\n\nthan it was assumed at the time of planning, this can result in loss of\navailability of the entire network, if the network infrastructure does not scale\nin an adequate measure.\n\n– If due to overwork, the administrators only sporadically check the log files\n\nof the equipment they administer, possible attacks will not be detected\npromptly.\n\n– Web servers can become so overloaded by a large amount of simultaneous\n\nincoming requests that controlled access to data is almost impossible.\n\n– If a company is subject to insolvency proceedings, it may happen that there\n\nis no money for urgently needed spare parts or those essential service\nproviders cannot be paid.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.28 Software Vulnerabilities or Errors\n\nFor all software the following applies: the more complex it is, the more likely\nerrors will occur. Even after intensive testing, not all errors are usually\ndetected prior to delivery to the customer. If software errors are not detected\nearly, the crashes or errors of the application can result in far-reaching\nconsequences. Examples for this include incorrect calculation results, wrong\ndecisions at management level or delays in the workflow of business\nprocesses.\n\nDue to software vulnerabilities or errors, serious gaps in the security can occur\nin an application or an IT system or all IT systems networked with it. Such\ngaps in the security can under certain circumstances be exploited by attackers\nto introduce malicious software, to access data in an unauthorised manner or\nto perform manipulation.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– The most frequent warnings of the Computer Emergency Response Teams\n\n(CERTs) in recent years were related to security-relevant programming\nerrors. These are errors made during programming of software which allow\nattackers to misuse it. A large proportion of these errors are caused by buffer\noverflows.\n\n– Internet browsers are nowadays an important software component on clients.\n\nBrowsers frequently do not only access the Internet but are also used for\ninternal web applications in companies and public bodies. This is why\nsoftware vulnerabilities or errors in browsers can impair information\nsecurity overall particularly strongly.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.29 Violation of Laws or Regulations\n\nIf information, business processes and IT systems of an institution are\ninsufficiently safeguarded (for example, by inadequate security management),\nthis can lead to violations of laws relating to information processing or of\nexisting contracts with business partners. Which laws must be observed there,\ndepends on the type of institution and of its business processes and services.\nDepending on where the sites of an institution are located, a number of\nnational regulations may also have to be observed.\n\n**The following examples illustrate this:**\n\n– The handling of personal data in Germany is governed by a variety of\n\nregulations. These include the Federal Data Protection Act, state data\nprotection laws and a variety of sector-specific regulations also. If during\ncommunication between two business divisions, personal data (e. g. medical\nrecords) is transmitted unprotected over public networks, this can lead to\nlegal consequences under certain circumstances.\n\n– The management of a company is obliged to take all reasonable care in their\n\nbusiness processes. This includes compliance with recognised security\nmeasures. In Germany, various laws are applicable, such as the Act for\nCorporate Control and Transparency (KonTraT - Gesetz zur Kontrolle und\nTransparenz im Unternehmensbereich), the Law on Limited Liability\nCompanies (GmbHT - Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit\nbeschränkter Haftung) or the Stock Corporation Act (AktT - Aktiengesetz),\nfrom which corresponding obligations and liabilities for the management or\nthe board of a company can be derived in relation to risk management and\ninformation security.\n\n– Proper processing of payment-relevant information is governed by different\n\nlaws and regulations. In Germany they include among others, the\nCommercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB e. g. §§ 238 et seq.) and the\nTax Code (AO Abgabenordnung). Proper processing of information implies\ntheir secure processing, of course. Both must be proven regularly in many\ncountries, for example by auditors as part of the audit of annual accounts. If\nserious security deficiencies are identified, a positive audit report will not be\nissued.\n\n– In many industries (e. g. the automotive industry), it is common that\n\nmanufacturers commit their suppliers to meet certain quality and safety\nstandards. Analogically, more and more requirements are placed on\ninformation security. If a contractor violates contractually regulated security\nrequirements, this can result in penalties and even termination of contracts\nup to and including loss of business relations.\n\nFew security requirements arise directly from laws. The legislation generally\norientates itself however, on the standards in technology as a common basis\nfor assessment of an achievable security level. If there is no healthy balance\nbetween the existing security measures in an institution and the sensitive\ninformation in the current state of technology, this can have serious\nconsequences.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.30 Unauthorised Use or Administration of Devices and Systems\n\nWithout appropriate mechanisms for entry, admission and access control,\nunauthorised use of devices and systems virtually can neither be prevented nor\ndetected. The basic mechanism IT systems use for this is user identification\nand authentication. But even in IT systems with a strong identification and\nauthentication mechanisms, unauthorised access is still conceivable, if the\ncorresponding security features (passwords, chip cards, tokens, etc.) fall into\nthe wrong hands. Also, when assigning and maintaining permissions, many\nmistakes can be made, for example, if authorisations are granted too liberally\nor given to unauthorised persons, or if they are not regularly updated.\n\nWhen granted illegal access to devices and systems, unauthorised persons can\nintercept confidential information, carry out manipulation or cause\ndisruptions.\n\nA particularly prominent special case of unauthorised use is unauthorised\nadministration. If unauthorised persons change the configuration or operating\nparameters of the hardware or software components, severe damage can be the\nconsequence of such action.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– When examining log files, a network administrator came across inexplicable\n\nevents occurring on different days but often early in the morning and in the\nafternoon. After a closer examination, it turned out that a wireless router was\nnot configured properly. People waiting at the bus stop outside the office\nbuilding have used this access to surf with their mobile devices on the\nInternet while waiting for the bus.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.31 Incorrect Use or Administration of Devices and Systems\n\nIncorrect or improper use of devices, systems and applications may affect their\nsecurity, especially when existing security measures are ignored or\ncircumvented. This often leads to disruptions or failures. Depending on what\ntypes of devices or systems are used improperly, confidentiality and integrity\nof information may also be violated.\n\nA particularly prominent special case of improper use is the improper\nadministration. Errors in the installation, configuration, service and\nmaintenance of hardware or software components can result in severe damage.\n\nFor example, too generously granted access rights, easy-to-guess passwords,\ninadequately protected data storage media containing backups or terminals not\nbeing blocked during a temporary absence can lead to security incidents.\n\nIn the same way, data can also be accidentally deleted or changed due to\nimproper use of IT systems or applications. Confidential information can thus\nbe available the public if, for example, permissions are set incorrectly.\n\nIf power or network cables are laid unprotected, they can be inadvertently\ndamaged, which can cause an outage. A cable connection can be pulled out\nwhen staff or visitors stumble over it.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.32 Abuse of Authorisations\n\nDepending on their roles and tasks, people are granted corresponding entry,\nadmission and access rights. In this way, the access to information is on one\nhand controlled and monitored, and on the other hand, people are enabled to\ncarry out certain tasks. For example, individuals or groups need specific\npermissions to use applications or edit information.\n\nA misuse of privileges occurs when intentionally legally or illegally obtained\npermissions are used outside of the scope of intended use. The aim is thereby\noften to gain personal benefit or to harm a specific person or institution.\n\nIn many cases, due to historical, system-related or other reasons, people have\nhigher or more comprehensive entry, admission and access rights than they\nneed to in order to perform their activities. These rights can be misused for\nattacks under certain circumstances.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– The finer the granularity of access rights to information, the greater the\n\neffort required to keep these permissions up to date. There is therefore a risk\nthat when granting the access rights, too little differentiation is being made\namong the various roles which facilitates the abuse of authorisations.\n\n– In various applications, access permissions and passwords are stored in\n\nsystem areas, which can be accessed by other users. This would allow\nattackers to change permissions or retrieve passwords.\n\n– Persons with too generously granted permissions can be tempted to access\n\nfiles belonging to other users, for instance to read another person's email if\ncertain information there is urgently needed.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.33 Absence of Personnel\n\nAbsence of personnel can have a significant impact on an institution and its\nbusiness processes. Staff may be missing unexpectedly due to illness,\naccident, death or strike, for example. Furthermore, also the predictable\npersonnel absences in cases of leave, training or regular termination of\ncontract must be taken into account, especially if the remaining working time\nis reduced, for example, by a right to take annual leave. Absences of personnel\nmay as well be caused by an internal realignment of resources.\n\nIn all these cases, critical tasks may in consequence no longer be performed\ndue to absence of personnel. This is especially critical if the person plays a\nkey role in a business process and cannot be replaced by another person due to\nlack of expertise. Disruptions in the IT operation may be the result. Thus,\nother areas and processes of the institution can be substantially impaired.\n\nA loss of personnel may additionally include a considerable loss of expertise\nand trade secrets, which makes the subsequent transfer of activities to other\npeople impossible.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– Due to a prolonged illness, the network administrator of a company\n\nremained out of office. In the affected company, initially the network ran\nflawlessly. After two weeks however, after a system crash, no one was able\nto fix the problem because there was only one administrator familiar with\noperation of this network. This led to a network failure which lasted several\ndays.\n\n– During the vacation of an administrator, the institution needed to access the\n\nbackup media in backup data safe. The access code to the safe was only\nchanged recently and was only known to that administrator. The data\nrecovery could only be performed after several days, because the\nadministrator was not available earlier due to his vacation.\n\n– In the event of a pandemic more and more personnel become unavailable in\n\nthe longer term, either due to the disease or due to the necessary care for\nrelatives or children. Also because of fear of contagion in public\ntransportation or in the institution, some employees remain out of office. As\na result, only the most necessary work can be done.  The required\nmaintenance of systems, be it the central server or the air conditioning in the\ncomputing centre, is not performed any more. Gradually, more and more\nsystem failures occur.\n\n\nKeyposition in the\nbusiness process\n\nLoss of expertise and\n\ntrade secrets\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.34 Attack\n\nAn attack can constitute a threat to an institution, certain areas of the\ninstitution or individuals. The technical possibilities to perpetrate an attack are\nnumerous: throwing bricks, blasts by explosives, use of firearms or arson.\nWhether and to what extent an institution is exposed to the danger of an attack\ndepends not only on the location and environment of the building but on the\ninstitution’s activities and the socio-political climate. Companies and public\nbodies that operate in politically controversial areas are more at risk than\nothers. Institutions close to the usual demonstration staging areas are more at\nrisk than those in remote locations. To assess the level of threat or when\nsuspecting the threat of politically motivated attacks, criminal investigation\nauthorities or the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation\n(Bundeskriminalamt) can be consulted.\n\nIn the case of archives, threat assessment must take into account a special\ncircumstance: They store a large number of documents and data in a relatively\nsmall space. This can be, for example, medical records, contracts, deeds or\nwills. Their destruction can have far-reaching implications, not only for the\narchive, but also for other users. For example, it may be necessary in such a\ncase, that the lost data must be re-collected or newly recorded with great\neffort. Under certain circumstances some data will even be irrevocably lost.\nAttacks on paper-based and electronic archives can therefore cause substantial\ndamage.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– In the 1980s, a bomb attack was perpetrated on the data centre of a large\n\nfederal agency in Cologne. Due to the large penetrating power of the\nexplosive device, not only windows and walls, but also many information\nsystems in the data centre were destroyed.\n\n– In the attack on the World Trade Center in New York on the 11th of\n\nSeptember 2001, not only were many people killed but also were a number\nof IT facilities destroyed. As a result, several companies had considerable\ndifficulty in continuing their business activities.\n\n\nMany documents in a\n\nsmall room space\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.35 Coercion, Extortion or Corruption\n\nCoercion, extortion or corruption may affect the security of information and\nbusiness processes. Using threats of violence or other detriments an attacker\ncan, for example, try to make the victim disregard security guidelines, or to\ncircumvent security measures (coercion).\n\nInstead of threatening, attackers can also purposefully offer employees or\nother person's money or other benefits to make them an instrument for\nsecurity violations (corruption). For example, there is a risk that a corrupt\nemployee will forward confidential documents to unauthorised persons.\n\nIn principle, by coercion or corruption, all basic parameters of information\nsecurity may be affected. Attacks can be aimed at, amongst other things,\nforwarding confidential information to unauthorised persons, manipulating\nbusiness-critical information or disrupting the smooth execution of business\nprocesses.\n\nParticular danger exists if such attacks are aimed against high-profile\nexecutives or persons in special positions of trust.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.36 Identity Theft\n\nIn the case of identity theft, an attacker assumes a false identity, he takes\nadvantage of information about another person, to act on his or her behalf.\nHere, data such as date of birth, address, credit card or bank account numbers\nare used in order, for example, to gain access to an Internet provider or to gain\nfinancial benefits in other ways. Theft of identity often leads directly or\nindirectly to damage of reputation, but also elucidating the causes and\npreventing the negative consequences for those affected is time-expensive.\nSome forms of identity fraud are also known as masquerade.\n\nIdentity theft occurs most frequently where identity verification is handled too\ncarelessly, especially if expensive services are based on it.\n\nA person who has been misled in respect to the identity of his or her\ncommunication partner can be easily persuaded to reveal sensitive\ninformation.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– To register with various email providers or auction platforms on the Internet,\n\nit sufficed to invent a fictitious name and to provide a suitable address from\nthe phone book with it. At first, attackers could register using recognisable\nfictitious names, for example, derived from cartoon characters. As stronger\nplausibility checks were later introduced for this purpose, names, addresses\nand account numbers of real people have been used. Those affected have\nonly learned about a fraud, when the first claims for payment arrived.\n\n– The sender address of emails can be easily spoofed. It happens again and\n\nagain that users are this way fooled into believing that an email comes from\na trusted communication partner. Similar attacks are possible by\nmanipulation of caller ID for voice calls or by manipulating the sender\nidentity for fax connections.\n\n– An attacker may use a masquerade to try to enter into an already existing\n\nconnection without having to authenticate himself, since this step has\nalready been performed by the original communication participants.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.37 Reputation of Actions\n\nPeople can deny, for various reasons, to have committed certain acts for\nexample, because these acts violate instructions, security guidelines, or even\nlaws. But they could also deny having received a notification, for example\nbecause they have forgotten a deadline or an appointment. The field of\ninformation security is focused on accountability, a property predestined to\nensure that committed acts cannot be denied without justification. Generally\nthe term non-repudiation is used here.\n\nIn a communication there is a further distinction, whether a communication\nparticipant denies the receipt of messages (Repudiation of Receipt) or sending\nof messages (Repudiation of Origin). Repudiating the receipt of messages can\nbe of relevance for, amongst other things, financial transactions when\nsomeone denies having received an invoice at a due date. Likewise, it may\nhappen that a communication participant denies sending messages, e. g.\ndenies having issued a purchasing order. Message sending or receiving mail\ncan be repudiated in the case of post messages as well as fax or email\nmessages.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– An urgently needed spare part has been ordered electronically. After a week\n\nit is claimed still to be missing, in the meantime high losses due to\nproduction outage are incurred. The supplier denies having ever received an\norder.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.38 Abuse of Personal Data\n\nPersonal data is almost always particularly sensitive information. Typical\nexamples include information about personal or factual circumstances of an\nidentified or identifiable natural person. If the protection of personal data is\nnot sufficiently guaranteed, the danger exists that the person will be impaired\nin his or her social position or economic conditions.\n\nAn abuse of personal data takes place if an institution collects, for example,\ntoo much personal data, collects it without legal basis or consent, uses it for\npurposes different from the objective stated at the time of collecting, deletes\npersonal data too late or discloses such data in an unauthorised manner.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– Personal data may be processed only for the purpose for which it was\n\ncollected or stored for the first time. It is therefore inadmissible to use log\nfiles for attendance and monitoring conduct, if they were designed to store\ninformation on users’ logging on to an IT system and logging off merely for\naccess control.\n\n– Persons who have access to personal data could disclose them in an\n\nunauthorised manner. For example, an employee at the front desk of a hotel\ncould sell the guests’ registration information to advertising companies.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.39 Malicious Software\n\nMalicious software is software developed with the aim of performing\nunwanted and often harmful operations. Typical kinds of malicious software\ninclude viruses, worms and Trojan Horses. Malicious software acts usually in\na secret way without the user’s knowledge or consent.\n\nNowadays, malicious software offers an attacker comprehensive\ncommunication and control possibilities, and makes a variety of functions\navailable. Amongst other things, malicious software can purposefully reveal\npasswords, remote-control systems, deactivate data protection software and\nspy on data.\n\nThe most significant damage here is loss or corruption of information or\napplications. But also the loss of reputation and financial damage, caused by\nmalicious software, are of great importance.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– In the past, the malicious software W32/Bugbear was spread in two ways: it\n\nsearched in local area networks for computers with shares, where write\naccess was possible, and made copies of itself on each share found.\nMoreover, it sent itself as an HTML-email to recipients in the email address\nbooks of infected computers. Due to an error in the HTML routines of\ncertain email programs, the malicious software was executed upon opening\nthe message without further action by the recipient.\n\n– The malicious software W32/Klez spread in different variants. Infected\n\ncomputers sent the virus to all recipients in the email address book of the\ncomputer. After this virus had infected a computer, by continuous\nmanipulation of the operating system it prevented the installation of antivirus programs from most popular manufacturers and made it significantly\nmore difficult to perform disinfection of the infected computers.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.40 Denial of Service\n\nThere are a variety of different forms of attack, all aiming at disruption of the\nintended use of certain services, functions or devices. The generic term for\nsuch attacks is \"Denial of Service\". Often the term \"DoS-attack\" is used.\n\nSuch attacks can come, amongst others, from disgruntled employees or\ncustomers, but also from competitors, extortionists or politically motivated\nperpetrators. The aim of the attacks can be business-relevant values of any\nkind. Typical forms of DoS attacks are:\n\n– Disruptions of business processes, for example, by flooding the order\n\nprocessing with improper orders,\n\n– Damage to the infrastructure, for example by blocking the doors of the\n\ninstitution,\n\n– provoking IT failures by e. g. purposeful overloading services of a server in\n\nthe network.\n\nThis type of attack is often associated with distributed resources, the attacker\ngenerates such a high demand for these resources that they are no longer\navailable for the actual users. In IT-based attacks, the following resources can\nbe artificially made scarce: processes, CPU time, memory, disk space and\ntransfer capacity.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– In spring 2007 in Estonia strong DoS attacks on numerous Internet sites over\n\na prolonged period of time took place. This led to significant impairments in\nthe use of information services and Internet services in Estonia.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.41 Sabotage\n\nSabotage is the deliberate manipulation of or damage to objects or processes\nwith the aim of inflicting damage to the victim by acting this way. Particularly\nattractive targets can be data centres and the communication connections of\npublic bodies or companies, since there a great effect can be achieved with\nrelatively few resources.\n\nThe complex infrastructure of a computer centre can be affected by selective\nmanipulation, when possibly external perpetrators but also primarily intruders\nfrom inside actively influence important components to provoke operational\ndisruptions. In this regard, insufficiently protected technical building systems\nand communication infrastructure as well as central supply points are\nparticularly threatened if they are left unobserved in organisational and\ntechnical terms and can be easily accessed by externals without being noticed.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– In a mainframe computer centre, a manipulation of the uninterrupted power\n\nsupply led to a temporary total failure. The perpetrator had repeatedly\nmanually switched the uninterrupted power supply to bypass mode and then\nmanipulated the main power supply of the building. Altogether there were\nfour failures within three years. Even hardware was partially damaged. The\ndisruption took between 40 and 130 minutes.\n\n– Sanitary facilities were also located within a data centre. Due to blockage of\n\nthe drains and the simultaneous opening of the water supply, water\npenetrated into central technology components. Damage caused this way\nresulted in interruptions of operation in the production system.\n\n– Electronic archives present a particular risk of sabotage, since there, many\n\nsensitive documents are kept on a small floor space. Because of this aspect,\nby targeted unsophisticated manipulation a great deal of damage can be\nincurred under certain circumstances.\n\n\nSelective manipulation\n\nPower supply\n\nFlooding\n\nElectronic archives\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.42 Social Engineering\n\nSocial engineering is a method to gain unauthorised access to information or\nIT systems through social action. In social engineering advantage of human\nqualities are taken of such as e. g. helpfulness, trust, fear or respect for\nauthority. As a result, employees can be manipulated so that they act in an\ninadmissible way.\n\nA typical case of attacks with the help of social engineering is the\nmanipulation of people by phone calls where the attacker introduces himself\nas for example:\n\n– a secretary whose boss must do something quickly, but has forgotten his\n\npassword and needs it urgently now.\n\n– an administrator, calling because of a system error, since he needs the user’s\n\npassword to fix the problem.\n\nIf such attackers are being asked critical questions in return, the enquirer is\nsupposedly \"just a temporary help\" or an \"important\" personality.\n\nAnother strategy for systematic social engineering is to develop a longer\nrelationship to the victim. Unimportant but numerous phone calls in advance\nserve the attacker to gain knowledge and build up confidence that he can make\nuse of later.\n\nSuch attacks can also be multi-stage attacks, where in further steps knowledge\nand techniques are used, which have been acquired in the previous stages.\n\nMany users know that they must not reveal their passwords to anybody. Social\nengineers know this and therefore must reach the desired aim using other\nways.\n\n**Examples for this are:**\n\n– An attacker can ask the victim, to execute commands or applications\n\nunfamiliar to him or her, for example, because this will help to solve an IT\nproblem. This may be a hidden command to change access rights. This\nallows the attacker to access sensitive information.\n\n– Although many users are using strong passwords, they are however used for\n\nmultiple accounts. If an attacker can provide a useful network service (such\nas an email address system), for which the user must authenticate him or her\nself, he can get access to the desired passwords and logins. Many users will\nuse the same credentials they chose for this service also for other services.\n\nIf attackers gain passwords or other authentication features in an unauthorised\nway, for example by means of social engineering, this is often referred to as\n\"phishing\" (a portmanteau word from \"password\" and \"fishing\").\n\nDuring social engineering the attacker is not always visible. Often the victim\nnever recognizes that he or she was being exploited. If successful, the attacker\ndoes not have to face the risk of legal sanctions and also has a source for\nobtaining additional information later.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.43 Replaying Messages\n\nIn this form of attack, attackers send specially prepared messages to\nindividuals or systems with the aim of gaining an advantage for themselves or\nto cause damage to the victim. To construct the messages in a proper way,\nattackers use interface descriptions, protocol specifications, or records logging\nof the communication behaviour from the past.\n\nIn practice, there are two important special cases of message replay:\n\n– In a \"replay attack\" (replay of messages) attackers record valid messages\n\nand play this information at a later time almost unchanged.Also only part of\na message may suffice, such as a password, to enter into an IT system\nwithout authorisation.\n\n– In a \"man-in-the-middle attack\" the attacker assumes unnoticed a mediating\n\nposition in the communication among various participants. In general, the\nattacker pretends here to be the sender of a message to the intended\nrecipient, and he pretends to the recipient that he is the actual sender. If\nsuccessful, the attacker can receive messages, which are not intended for\nhim, evaluate them and purposefully manipulate them before they are\nforwarded to the intended recipient.\n\nAn encryption of the communication does not protect against man-in-themiddle attacks, if no secure authentication of communication partners is\nperformed.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– An attacker records the authentication data (e. g. user ID and password)\n\nduring a user’s login and uses this information to gain access to a system. In\npurely static authentication protocols a password, also if it is transferred in\nan encrypted way, can be used to illegally access a third party system.\n\n– To cause financial harm to the employer (company or public body), an\n\nemployee places an approved purchase order several times.\n\n\nReplay\n\nMan-in-the-middle\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.44 Unauthorised Entry to Premises\n\nIf unauthorised persons gain illegal entry into a building or individual\npremises, this can lead to various other dangers. These include theft or\nmanipulation of information or IT systems. In qualified attacks time is crucial,\nin which the perpetrators can pursue their goal undisturbed.\n\nOften the perpetrators want to steal valuable IT components or other goods\nthat can be easily sold. However, the target of an intrusion, among other\nthings, can be to gain access to confidential information, perform\nmanipulations or disrupt business processes.\n\nUnauthorised intrusion into premises can thus result in multiple types of\ndamage:\n\n– Damage can occur already due to the very entry into property in an\n\nunauthorised manner. Windows and/or doors are forced open and hence\ndamaged, they must be repaired or replaced.\n\n– Stolen, damaged or destroyed equipment or components must be repaired or\n\nreplaced.\n\n– Damage due to breach of confidentiality, integrity or availability of\n\ninformation or applications can occur.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– During a night-time intrusion into an office building the perpetrators did not\n\ntake a worthwhile trophy. Due to frustration about this, they emptied the\npowder extinguishers into the offices. The burglary damage was minor,\nhowever, the costs of cleaning and work interruptions disproportionately\nhigh.\n\n– A break-in into a company during one weekend caused only minor damage\n\ndue to levering a window open, only one coffee cup stolen and smaller\npieces of furniture taken away. During a routine inspection, however, it\nturned out later that a central server has been skilfully manipulated exactly\nat the time of the intrusion.\n\n\nVandalism\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.45 Data Loss\n\nData loss is an event that leads to a situation where stored data cannot be used\nas required (loss of availability). A common form of data loss occurs when\ndata is inadvertently or illegally deleted, for example by accidental misuse,\nmalfunctions, power outages, pollution or malicious software.\n\nData loss may also occur due to damage, loss or theft of devices or data\nstorage media. This risk is extremely high in case of mobile terminals and\nremovable data storage media.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that many mobile IT systems are not always\nonline. The data stored on these systems is therefore not always up to date.\nWhen data is synchronised between the mobile and stationary IT systems,\ncarelessness or malfunction may lead to loss of data.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n– A PDA falls out of a shirt pocket and shatters into pieces on the tiles, a\n\nmobile phone is retrieved by a dog instead of the newspaper, unfortunately\nwith consequences. These and similar events are the causes of many total\nlosses of data on mobile devices.\n\n– There is malicious software that purposefully deletes data on infected IT\n\nsystems. Some pests execute the delete function not immediately upon\ninfection, but only when a defined event occurs, for example, if the system\nreaches a certain date.\n\n– Many internet services can be used to store information online. If the\n\npassword is forgotten, and is not stored, it may happen that the stored\ninformation cannot be accessed any more if the service provider does not\noffer a suitable method to reset the password.\n\n– Hard drives and other storage media have a limited lifetime. If no suitable\n\nredundancy measures are undertaken, technical defects may result in loss of\ndata.\n\n\nManipulations\n\n\n-----\n\n### T 0.46 Loss of Integrity of Sensitive Information\n\nThe integrity of information can be impaired by various causes, such as by\nmanipulation, misconduct of individuals, misuse of applications, software\nfailures of transmission errors.\n\n– Due to the aging of data storage media, loss of information can occur.\n\n– During data transfer transmission errors may occur.\n\n– Malicious software can destroy or modify entire databases.\n\n– Due to incorrect input, undesired transactions may occur, which often\n\nremain unnoticed for a long time.\n\n– Attackers may try to manipulate data for their purposes, e. g. to gain access\n\nto other IT systems or databases.\n\n– Manipulating the index database can prompt electronic archives to archive\n\nor retrieve false documents.\n\nIf the information loses integrity, it can cause a variety of problems:\n\n– In the simplest case, information cannot be read and hence further\n\nprocessed.\n\n– Data can be accidentally or intentionally falsified to the extent that false\n\ninformation is passed on. In this way transfers with wrong amounts, for\ninstance, or to the wrong recipient can be triggered, the sender data in an\nemail can be manipulated and many more.\n\n– If encrypted or compressed data loses its integrity (in this case it is enough\n\nto change just one bit), it cannot be decrypted or respectively decompressed\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n– The same applies to cryptographic keys, also here changing a single bit can\n\nmake the keys useless. This also has a consequence that data can no longer\nbe decrypted or their authenticity cannot be verified any more.\n\n– Documents stored in electronic archives, lose their probative value, if their\n\nintegrity can be questioned.\n\n\nTransmission errors\n\nMalicious software\n\nIncorrect input\n\n\n-----",
