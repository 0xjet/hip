This file used template injection to drop a malicious template which\nloaded a variant of Cobalt Strike.\n\nOne day later, the same threat actor changed their template and dropped a loader called\nMgBot, executing and injecting its final payload through the use of Application Management\n(AppMgmt) Service on Windows.\n\nOn July 5, we observed yet another archive file with an embedded document borrowing a\nstatement about Hong Kong from UK's prime minister Boris Johnson. This document used\nthe same TTPs to drop and execute the same payload.\n\nConsidering the ongoing tensions between India and China, as well as the new security laws\nover Hong Kong, we believe this new campaign is operated by a Chinese state-sponsored\nactor. Based on our analysis, we believe this may be a Chinese APT group that has been\nactive since at least 2014.\n\n## Active targeting with different lures\n\nWe were able to track the activities related to these threat actors over the succession of\nseveral days based on unique phishing attempts designed to compromise their target.\n\n**'Mail security check' with Cobalt Strike (variant 1)**\n\nThis campaign was most likely carried out through spear phishing emails. The .rar file (Mail\n_security check.rar) includes a document with the same name (Figure 1)._\n\nFigure 1: Mail security check.docx\nThe document uses template injection to download a remote template from the following\nURL (Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Template injection\nThe downloaded template uses the dynamic data exchange (DDE) protocol to execute\nmalicious commands, which are encoded within the document's content (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: Encoded command\nAfter decoding, we can see the list of commands that will be executed by DDE:\n\nFigure 4: Decoded commands\nAs Figure 4 shows, the threat actors used certutil with -urlcache -split -f parameters to\ndownload a com scriptlet from its server and then used the _[Squiblydoo technique to execute](https://car.mitre.org/analytics/CAR-2019-04-003/)_\nthe downloaded scriptlet via regsvr32.exe on the victim machine.\n\nThis scriptlet is stored in the Documents directory as \"ff.sct\". The scriptlet is an XML file that\nhas embedded VBscript (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: ff.sct snipplet\nThe scriptlet creates a VB macro and calls Excel to execute it. The macro has been\nobfuscated to bypass static security mechanism and is responsible for injecting the\nembedded payload into rundll32.exe using the reflective DLL injection method. The injected\npayload is a variant of Cobalt Strike.\n\nThe following diagram shows the overall process of this attack:\n\nFigure 6: Overall process\n\n**'Mail security check' with MgBot (variant 2)**\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, a day after the first attack, the APT group changed its remote\ntemplate. In this new variant, the actors stopped using the Squiblydoo technique and Cobalt\nStrike as a payload.\n\nFigure 7 shows the new encoded commands embedded within the template file.\n\nFigure 7: Encoded command\nFigure 8 shows the list of commands that will be executed by DDE.\n\nFigure 8: Decoded commands\nIn this new template file, the storm.sct scriptlet was replaced with storm.txt. Similar to the\nprevious version, certutil is used to download the storm.txt file which is an executable stored\nin the Documents directory as ff.exe.\n\nThe following diagram shows the overall execution process:\n\nFigure 9: Overall execution process\n\n**\"Boris Johnson Pledges to Admit 3 Million From Hong Kong\" with MgBot (variant 3)**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe last document used by the Chinese APT group in this campaign focused on issues\nhappening in Hong Kong. The file was embedded within an archive file named \"Boris\nJohnson Pledges to Admit 3 Million From Hong Kong to U.K.rar\".\n\nThis document quotes the prime minister after a new security law was issued by China\nagainst Hong Kong (Figure 10).\n\nFigure 10: Boris Johnson Pledges to Admit 3 Million From Hong Kong to U.K.\nSimilar to the other documents, it also uses template injection to download the remote\ntemplate (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 11: Remote template\nThe downloaded template (BNOHK.docx) is similar to ADIN.docx (variant 2) in which it uses\nDDE to download and drop its loader.\n\n## Payload analysis: MgBot (BLame, Mgmbot)\n\nThe dropped executable (ff.exe) is a new variant of a loader called MgBot that drops and\nloads the final payload. This loader pretends to be a Realtek Audio Manager tool (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 12: File version information\nIt has four embedded resources in which two of them are in Chinese Simplified language.\nThis is an indicator that suggests this campaign is likely operated by a Chinese APT group.\n\nFigure 13: Resource language\nThe loader starts its process by escalating privilege through a UAC bypass using the\n[CMSTPLUA COM interface.](https://cqureacademy.com/cqure-labs/cqlabs-how-uac-bypass-methods-really-work-by-adrian-denkiewicz)\n\nMgBot uses several anti-analysis and anti-virtualization techniques. The code is self\nmodifying which means it alters its code sections during runtime. This makes static analysis\nof the sample harder.\n\nMgBot tries to avoid running in known virtualized environment such as VmWare, Sandboxie\nand VirtualBox. To identify if it's running in one of these environments, it looks for the\nfollowing DLL files: vmhgfs.dll, sbiedll.dll and vboxogl.dll and if it finds any of these DLLs, it\ngoes to an infinite loop without doing any malicious activity (Figure 14).\n\nFigure 14: Anti-VMs\nIt also checks for the presence of security products on the victim's machine and takes a\ndifferent execution flow if a security product is detected. For example, it checks for\n_zhudongfangyu.exe, 360sd.exe, 360Tray.exe, MfeAVSvc.exe and McUICnt.exe in different_\nparts of the code (Figure 15). The malware does not perform all the checks at once and it\nrather checks a couple of them at different steps of its execution.\n\nFigure 15: Security products checks\n\n\n-----\n\nTo invoke the required APIs, the malware does not call them directly but instead builds a\nfunction pointer table for the required APIs. Each request to an API call is made through the\naccess to the relevant index of this table.\n\nFigure 16: Building function pointer table\nAs an example, when the malware needs to invoke WinExec, it does so by invoking it\nthrough its index from the function pointer table.\n\nFigure 17: Calling API through use of function pointer table\nAfter building the required API calls table, the malware performs the following procedures:\n\nIt calls CreateFileW to create iot7D6E.tmp (random name starting with iot) into the\n_%APPDATA%Temp directory. This tmp file is a cab file that embedds the final payload._\nIt calls WriteFile to populate its content\nIt calls CreateProcessInternalW to invoke expand.exe to decompress the content of\n_iot7D6E.tmp into ProgramData\\Microsoft\\PlayReady\\MSIBACF.tmp\\tmp.dat (the_\n_MSIBACF.tmp directory name is generated randomly and starts with MSI and then is_\nfollowed by a combination of random numbers and characters)\n\nFigure 18: Calling expand.exe\n\nIt calls CopyFileW to copy tmp.dat into pMsrvd.dll\nIt calls DeleteFileW to delete tmp.dat\nIt drops DBEngin.EXE and WUAUCTL.EXE in the ProgramData\\Microsoft\\PlayReady\ndirectory. Both of these files are rundll32.exe that is used later to execute the dropped\nDLL.\nIt modifies the registry hive of of HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppMgmt\nregistry location to make itself persistent. To perform this modification, it drops two\nregistry files named iix*.tmp (random numbers have been added to iix) into the\n%APPDATA%Temp directory which are the old and new registry hives for the\nmentioned registry location.\n\nTo load the dropped DLL (pMsrvd.dll) the loader registers it as a service. To achieve this, it\nmakes use of the already installed service, AppMgmt, to load the payload as shown in the\nfollowing images:\n\nFigure 18: ServiceDll\nFigure 19: ImagePath\nFinally, it executes the dropped DLL by running net start AppMgmt. After loading the DLL,\nthe Loader creates a cmd file (lgt*.tmp.cmd) in the %APPDATA%TEMP directory with the\ncontent shown in Figure 20. Then it executes it to delete the cmd file and loader from the\nvictim's machine.\n\nFigure 20: cmd file\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were able to identify several different variants of this loader. In general, all the variants\ndrop the final payload using expand.exe or extrac32.exe and then use \"net start AppMgmt\"\nor \"net start StiSvc\" to execute the dropped DLL with one of the following configurations:\n\nsvchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s AppMgmt\nsvchost.exe -k netsvcs\nsvchost.exe -k imgsvc\n\nThe dropped DLL is the main payload used by this threat actor to perform malicious\nactivities. The following shows the file version information pretending to be a Video Team\n_Desktop App._\n\nFigure 21: File info\nThe creation time for this DLL appears to be \"2008-04-26 16:41:12\". However, based on\nRich header data, we can assert that this might have been tampered with by the threat actor.\n\nFigure 22: Rich header\nThis DLL has exported several functions as shown in the following Figure. The function\n_ServiceMain is used by this DLL to install itself as a service._\n\nFigure 23: Export functions\nIt can check the running services and based on that can run itself as a service using\n_WmiPrvSE.exe._\n\nFigure 24: Running as service using WmiPrvse.exe\nFigure 25: RAT's DLL is installed as service using WmiPrvse.exe\nIt uses several anti-debugging and anti-virtualization techniques to detect if it's running in a\nvirtualized environment or if it is being debugged by a debugger. It uses GetTickCount and\n_QueryPerformanceCounter API calls to detect the debugger environment._\n\nTo detect if it is running in a virtual environment, it uses anti-vm detection instructions such\nas sldt and cpid that can provide information about the processor and also checks Vmware\nIO ports (VMXH).\n\nFigure 26: Environment Detection\n[All the strings and used imports by this RAT are obfuscated using DES algorithm. Three](http://cryptopp.sourceforge.net/docs/ref521/des_8cpp-source.html)\ndifferent functions have been used to deobfuscate strings and imports:\n\nThe first one has been used to decrypt unicode strings: In this function each string has\na limit of 160 bytes and the key for decryption is: 25 00 57 50 8B C3 8A\nThe second function is used to decrypt ASCII strings: In this function each string has a\nlimit of 56 bytes and the decryption key is: A2 B1 1B B1 26 7B\nThe last function is used to resolve API functions names in ASCII format. The\ndecryption key is this case is 81 6E 00 E5 50 B2 D8.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis final piece of code bundled in MgBot is a Remote Administration Trojan with several\ncapabilities such as:\n\nC2 communication over TCP (42.99.116[.]225:12800)\nAbility to take screenshots\nFile and directory management (Enumerate files and directories and send the list to the\nserver, Rename files, Create directories, Delete files)\nProcess management\nGet drive type (FAT, FAT32, NTFS, CDFS) and free space\n\n## Infrastructure relations\n\nThe following shows the infrastructure used by this APT and relations between hosts used by\nthis group. This APT group has used several different IP addresses to host its malicious\npayloads and also for its C2 communications.\n\nWhat is interesting is that the majority of IP addresses used by this APT are located in Hong\nKong and almost all of these Hong Kong-based IP addresses are used for C2\ncommunication. Even in their past campaigns they mostly have used infrastructure in Hong\nKong. The graph also shows the relationship between different IP addresses used by this\nAPT group.\n\nFigure 27: Infrastructure connections\n\n## Android RAT\n\nWe also found several malicious Android applications we believe are part of the toolset used\nby this APT group. Malwarebytes detects them as Android/Trojan.Spy.AndroRat.KSRemote.\n\nFigure 28: Malicious Android APK\n[All these bogus applications contain a jar file named ksremote.jar that provides the RAT](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5f76192e952fd0002c1df4b66423ae803536ad82a1ae36bc9bfc6f73a7093b7f/detection)\nfunctionality:\n\nRecording screen and audio using the phone'ss camera/mic\nLocating phone with coordinates\nStealing phone contacts, call log, SMS, web history\nSending SMS messages\n\nFigure 29: Contact grabbing capability\nThis RAT communicates with C&C servers using random port numbers within the\n122.10.89.170 to 179 range (all in Hong Kong)\n\n122.10.89[.]172:10560\n122.10.89[.]170:9552\n122 10 89[ ]172:10560\n\n\n-----\n\n## TTPs in line with Chinese APTs\n\nThe lures used in this campaign indicate that the threat actor may be targeting the Indian\ngovernment and individuals in Hong Kong, or at least those who are against the new security\nlaw issued by China.\n\nThe TTPs observed in these attacks have been used by several Chinese APT groups:\n\n[Rancor APT is known to use Certutil to download their payload](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-rancor-targeted-attacks-south-east-asia-using-plaintee-ddkong-malware-families/)\n[KeyBoy is known to have used DDE is its previous campaigns](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/the-keyboys-are-back-in-town.html)\n[APT40 has utilized Squiblydoo and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leviathan-espionage-actor-spearphishes-maritime-and-defense-targets) [template injection in its previous campaigns.](https://www.elastic.co/blog/advanced-techniques-used-in-malaysian-focused-apt-campaign)\n\nConsidering these factors we attribute this APT attack with moderate confidence to a new\nChinese APT group. Based on the TTPs used by this APT group we were able to track back\nits activities to at least 2014. In all their campaigns the actor has used a variant of MgBot.\n\n## A threat actor with a long documented history\n\nA [Needle in a haystack blog post from 2014 detailed a campaign that drops a Trojan](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2014/02/needle-haystack)\ndisguised as a legitimate MP3 encoder library. In this campaign the actor used CVE-20120158 to drop its Trojan. The rest of the TTPs including the methods used by the threat actor\nto execute MgBot and registry modifications are similar to this ongoing campaign.\n\nIn 2018, this group performed another operation in which they used a VBScript vulnerability\n[(CVE-2018-8174) to](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8174) [initiate their attack to drop a variants of MgBot.
