    "plain_text": "# Ransomware Hit ATM Giant Diebold Nixdorf\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2020/05/ransomware-hit-atm-giant-diebold-nixdorf/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/05/ransomware-hit-atm-giant-diebold-nixdorf/)**\n\n**Diebold Nixdorf, a major provider of automatic teller machines (ATMs) and payment**\ntechnology to banks and retailers, recently suffered a ransomware attack that disrupted\nsome operations. The company says the hackers never touched its ATMs or customer\nnetworks, and that the intrusion only affected its corporate network.\n\n[Canton, Ohio-based Diebold [NYSE: DBD] is](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dbd)\ncurrently the largest ATM provider in the United\nStates, with an estimated 35 percent of the cash\nmachine market worldwide. The 35,000-employee\ncompany also produces point-of-sale systems and\nsoftware used by many retailers.\n\nAccording to Diebold, on the evening of Saturday,\nApril 25, the company’s security team discovered anomalous behavior on its corporate\nnetwork. Suspecting a ransomware attack, Diebold said it immediately began disconnecting\nsystems on that network to contain the spread of the malware.\n\nSources told KrebsOnSecurity that Diebold’s response affected services for over 100 of the\ncompany’s customers. Diebold said the company’s response to the attack did disrupt a\nsystem that automates field service technician requests, but that the incident did not affect\ncustomer networks or the general public.\n\n“Diebold has determined that the spread of the malware has been contained,” Diebold said in\na written statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity. “The incident did not affect ATMs,\ncustomer networks, or the general public, and its impact was not material to our business.\nUnfortunately, cybercrime is an ongoing challenge for all companies. Diebold Nixdorf takes\nthe security of our systems and customer service very seriously. Our leadership has\nconnected personally with customers to make them aware of the situation and how we\naddressed it.”\n\n**NOT SO PRO LOCK**\n\nAn investigation determined that the intruders installed the ProLock ransomware, which\nexperts say is a relatively uncommon ransomware strain that has gone through multiple\nnames and iterations over the past few months.\n\n[For example, until recently ProLock was better known as “PwndLocker,” which is the name](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-pwndlocker-ransomware-targeting-us-cities-enterprises/)\n[of the ransomware that infected servers at Lasalle County, Ill. in March. But the miscreants](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/03/04/ransomware-attack-renders-lasalle-county-government-computers-unusable/)\n[behind PwndLocker rebranded their malware after security experts at Emsisoft released a](https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/stop-djvu)\n\n\n-----\n\ntool that let PwndLocker victims decrypt their files without paying the ransom.\n\nDiebold claims it did not pay the ransom demanded by the attackers, although the company\nwouldn’t discuss the amount requested. But Lawrence Abrams of BleepingComputer said\nthe ransom demanded for ProLock victims typically ranges in the six figures, from $175,000\nto more than $660,000 depending on the size of the victim network.\n\n**Fabian Wosar, Emsisoft’s chief technology officer, said if Diebold’s claims about not paying**\ntheir assailants are true, it’s probably for the best: That’s because current versions of\nProLock’s decryptor tool will corrupt larger files such as database files.\n\n[As luck would have it, Emsisoft does offer a tool that fixes the decryptor so that it properly](https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/)\nrecovers files held hostage by ProLock, but it only works for victims who have already paid a\nransom to the crooks behind ProLock.\n\n“We do have a tool that fixes a bug in the decryptor, but it doesn’t work unless you have the\ndecryption keys from the ransomware authors,” Wosar said.\n\n**WEEKEND WARRIORS**\n\nBleepingComputer’s Abrams said the timing of the attack on Diebold — Saturday evening —\nis quite common, and that ransomware purveyors tend to wait until the weekends to launch\ntheir attacks because that is typically when most organizations have the fewest number of\ntechnical staff on hand. Incidentally, weekends also are the time when the vast majority of\nATM skimming attacks take place — for the same reason.\n\n“After hours on Friday and Saturday nights are big, because they want to pull the trigger [on\nthe ransomware] when no one is around,” Abrams said.\n\nMany ransomware gangs have taken to stealing sensitive data from victims before launching\nthe ransomware, as a sort of virtual cudgel to use against victims who don’t immediately\nacquiesce to a ransom demand.\n\nArmed with the victim’s data — or data about the victim company’s partners or customers —\nthe attackers can then threaten to publish or sell the information if victims refuse to pay up.\n[Indeed, some of the larger ransomware groups are doing just that, constantly updating blogs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/ransomware-gangs-now-outing-victim-businesses-that-dont-pay-up/)\non the Internet and the dark Web that publish the names and data stolen from victims who\ndecline to pay.\n\nSo far, the crooks behind ProLock haven’t launched their own blog. But Abrams said the\ncrime group behind it has indicated it is at least heading in that direction, noting that in his\ncommunications with the group in the wake of the Lasalle County attack they sent him an\nimage and a list of folders suggesting they’d accessed sensitive data for that victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nI ve been saying this ever since last year when the Maze ransomware group started\npublishing the names and data from their victims: Every ransomware attack has to be treated\nas a data breach now,” Abrams said.\n\n\n-----",
