    "plain_text": "# Cron has fallen\n\n**blog.group-ib.com/cron**\n\nGroup-IB supports operations to arrest gang\n\nfor infecting 1 million smartphones\n\nA black police vehicle, UAZ Patriot, is accelerating, chasing a cherry Renault Logan and\nforcing it to the roadside. The taxi driver in the Logan seems agitated, frightened even,\naccelerates quickly while shifting into higher gears. It has gotten dark; both cars speed close\nto the side of the road sweeping bushes. \"Be ready to run,\" one of the officers warns his\ncolleagues. \"He's going to brake and flee over the fence.\" When the Logan finally stops, the\nofficers act faster: with the entry team jumping out, pulling the passenger from the back seat\nand laying him face down in the snow.\n\nThis taxi passenger is a member of Cron, a hacker group that stole money from bank\naccounts of Android smartphone users. The hackers infected 3,500 mobile devices per day\nduring the height of their operations. In total, infecting over 1 million devices!\n\nARREST VIDEO\n\n**Androids under attack**\n\nGroup-IB first learnt about Cron in March 2015: Group-IB's Intelligence system tracked the\nactivity of a new criminal group that was distributing malicious programs named \"viber.apk\",\n\"Google-Play.apk\", \"Google Play.apk\" for Android OS on underground forums. The hackers\n\n\n-----\n\ncalled this malware Cron, hence the logic for our naming convention of the group. Cron\ntargeted users of large Russian banks in the Top 50 standing – all of their SMS banking\nservices were under siege during cron's operations.\n\nAccording to statistics from the Russian Central Bank, 20% of the adult population in the\ncountry used mobile banking in Russia. Smartphones have become the new mobile wallet –\nthis trend was capitalized on by cyber criminals. In 2015, 10 new hacker groups started\nstealing money using mobile Trojans, and the number of incidents tripled!\nTrojans for mobile phones and tablets have finally replaced PC Trojans. According to 2015\nyear-end results, losses of online banking users from attacks employing Android Trojans\namounted to over $1 million (61 million rubles).\n\nWhy are hackers choosing Android users as a key attack target? Easy. Almost 85% of\nsmartphones run Android OS worldwide making them an attractive target for cyber criminal\ngroups.\n\nIt is no longer necessary to be a virus writer to steal money from users of Internet banks –\nready-to-use malware can be easily purchased or rented on hacker forums. The Cron\norganizers had already been convicted of various crimes before their hacker attacks. It\ncomes as no surprise that experienced criminals become hackers. Once Group-IB\ninvestigated activity of a hacker who earned up to $20 million per month through thefts in\nonline banking.\n**Cron's attack scheme**\n\nThe approach was rather simple: after a victim's phone got infected, the Trojan could\nautomatically transfer money from the user's bank account to accounts controlled by the\nintruders. To successfully withdraw stolen money, the hackers opened more than 6 thousand\nbank accounts.\n\nAfter installation, the program added itself to the auto-start and could send SMS messages\nto the phone numbers indicated by the criminals, upload SMS messages received by the\nvictim to C&C servers, and hide SMS messages coming from the bank.\nEvery day Cron malware attempted to steal money from 50-60 clients of different banks. An\naverage theft was about 8,000 rubles ($100). According to crime investigators, the total\ndamage from Cron's activity amounted to approximately $800 000 (50 million rubles).\n\nThe gang applied several infection vectors:\n\n1\n\n**Spam SMS messages with a link to a website infected with the banking Trojan. The**\nmessage was of the following form: \"Your ad is posted on the website ....\", or \"your photos\nare posted here.\" After the user visits the compromised website, the malware will be\ndownloaded on the device, tricking the victim to install it.\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n\n**Infected applications. The victim could install the malicious program on the phone by**\ndownloading fake applications masked as legitimate ones. The Trojan is distributed under\nthe guise of such applications as Navitel; Framaroot; Pornhub; Avito.\n\nThus, Cron managed to infect over 1 million mobile devices. The gang infected 3,500\ndevices on average daily.\n\nIn April 2016, an announcement about the lease of a mobile Trojan called cronbot appeared\non a hacker forum. According to its description, the Trojan had the functionality to intercept\nSMS messages and calls, send USSD requests, and perform web injections. We assumed\nthat the criminal group decided to recruit a new member to the team, because according to\nthe author of the announcement, they were ready to provide the Trojan to one person only.\nAt the time, the group consisted of the organizers, operators, \"cryptors\", \"traffickers\" and\nmoney mules.\n\n_Announcement about the cronbot Trojan offered for rent_\n\n**Plans for France**\n\nHaving earned money in Russia, Cron decided to expand throughout the world. In June 2016\nthe criminals rented a mobile banking Trojan Tiny.z for $2000 per month. This universal tool\nhas capabilities to attack Android devices of both Russian and international banks'\ncustomers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Control panel of the_ **_Tiny.z_** _mobile Trojan_\n\nGroup-IB specialists detected Tiny.z in early 2016. According to analysis of the botnet control\npanel, this is the same panel that was used by the well-known \"404\" criminal group that\nactively attacked clients of both Russian and foreign banks. Purportedly, after the arrest of a\n\"404\" member named Foxxx in 2015, Cron modified the malicious program.\n\nThe malware authors adjusted this program for attacks on banks of Great Britain, Germany,\nFrance, the USA, Turkey, Singapore, Australia and other countries. The Trojan scanned the\nvictim's phone for a banking application and displayed a universal window with the icon and\nname of the bank retrieved from Google Play that prompted the user to enter his personal\ndata.\n\n_Control panel of the_ **_Tiny.z_** _mobile Trojan_\n\nCron planned to start their \"international activity\" with attacks targeting banks of France.\nThey developed special web injections for the following French financial institutions: Credit\nAgricole, Assurance Banque, Banque Populaire, BNP Paribas, Boursorama, Caisse\nd'Epargne, Societe Generale and LCL.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, by November 2016, Russian legal enforcement with support from Group-IB had\nmanaged to identify all members of the group and collect digital evidence of the crimes\ncommitted. On November 22, 2016, a large-scale operation was carried out in 6 Russian\nregions: 16 Cron members were detained. The last active member of the group was detained\nin early April in St. Petersburg.\n\nHow to avoid becoming a victim of an Android Trojan\n\n1\n\nAndroid users are particularly vulnerable to security threats and should be extremely\ncautious.\n\nDo not click on URLs in emails or social media communications, even when coming from\nyour friends or colleagues. They can be hacked. Only download mobile applications from the\nofficial website or app store directly.\n\n2\n\nKeep your smartphone up.\n\nExperts strongly urge you not to root your Android device and to update the firmware in a\ntimely manner, because updates usually contain security patches. Install a modern Internet\nsecurity solution on your device - this minimizes the risks.\n\n3\n\nDo not hesitate to contact bank specialists for assistance.\n\nIn the event of any suspicious activity related your bank account, alleged theft or fraud,\nimmediately contact your bank.\n\n\n-----",
