    "plain_text": "# Flubot vs. Zimperium\n\n**blog.zimperium.com/flubot-vs-zimperium/**\n\nJon Paterson May 5, 2021\n\nOver the past few weeks, reports of the newest aggressive malware family to impact\n[Android devices have made the rounds. Flubot, the credential and banking malware family,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-password-stealing-android-malware-is-spreading-quickly-heres-watch-to-watch-out-for/)\nuses SMS phishing techniques to propagate to its victims, purporting to be various vendors\nand delivery services. The group behind this aggressive malware takes advantage of a\ncommon but effective social engineering technique.\n\nThe Zimperium zLabs team has analyzed over 300 variants of Flubot and the URLs used to\ndistribute them, finding that the aggressive credential stealer comes with unique features\nthat make it stand out from many other examples of mobile malware seen in the past. The\nAndroid malware has been so effective, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre has issued\na cybersecurity warning, providing instructions for removal and reporting of any attempts.\n\nThe modern bank robbery is not happening through the front door of a building but with the\npath of least resistance – banking credentials. Flubot’s credential theft effectiveness comes\nin the form of its delivery and execution. The victim’s phone receives an SMS, instructing\nthem to click a link to track their “package” via one of the known global shippers. The victim\nis redirected to a fake or compromised website where the malicious APK is downloaded\nand installed via side loading. The user wants to track their package and installs the\napplication via side-loading onto the Android device – even walking the victim through the\nprocess if unfamiliar\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter installation, a window appears asking for the victim to\n“Accessibility Services” (a restricted capability allowing\nmonitoring and interaction with all apps/screen content) for the\napplication, enabling the now-installed application to take control\nwithout the user even knowing. Once the application has this\npermission, it uses it to get others such as READ_SMS,\nRECEIVE_SMS, and READ_CONTACTS. The app registers\nitself as the main SMS client, which will be later used to steal\n2FA credentials.\n\nA key component of credential-stealing malware is an effective\ncommand and control (CNC) capability, giving the attacked the\nability to grab what they want and not be flooded with untargeted\ndata. In the case of Flubot, the CNC backend is not hardcoded\ninto the malware itself. Instead, it uses a Domain generation\nalgorithm (DGA) – common in advanced desktop malware to\ngenerate the CNC URL server address. This enables Flubot to continue to evade its victim’s\nmobile endpoints if a security team was to block one single address.\n\nIts effectiveness on mobile endpoints is made more so by Flubot’s capability to automate\nactions. After disabling Google Play Protect, the Android malware then asks to be set as the\ndefault SMS and notification tool, enabling it to continue spreading to more victims by\ncollecting contact lists and preventing the victim from seeing the actions. From the moment\nthe malicious application is installed, it also begins monitoring all the applications installed\nin the device. When a targeted application is opened, Flubot performs an overlay attack to\ncollect user credentials and send this data back to the CNC. At the same time, Flubot uses\nSMS permissions to read second-factor authentication codes.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nOne final and very effective trick Flubot pulls on victims is collecting credit card information\nvia a fake Google Play credit card re-verification popup. This is again performed as an\noverlay attack, looking just like the real popup notification. The unsuspecting victim is\nencouraged to fill in the necessary details without a second thought.\n\nZimperium zIPS customers are protected against 100% of the Flubot variants analyzed with\n[our zero-day, on-device z9 Mobile Threat Defense machine learning engine.](https://www.zimperium.com/machine-learning-z9-technology)\n\nAs a standard protocol, the Zimperium zLabs team checks new malware samples against\nnot only the current machine learning model but past ones as well. In the case of Flubot,\nZimperium zIPS customers were protected against this aggressive credential stealing\nAndroid malware since the first variant was first reported in February 2020.\n\nThe screenshot above highlights how Flubot samples are detected with extreme accuracy\nby different releases of our on-device malware classifier. In the Figure, classifiers up to 3\nmonths back in time are displayed, but samples were detected by classifiers going back\nover one year.\nZimperium’s z9 malware engine is also able to correctly identify the family of malware\n(“banker” in this case) on device, allowing customers to create policies around specific\nmalware types, and provide supporting forensics.\n\nThe URLs used to deliver the APK consisted 80% of compromised domains (a legitimate\nwebsite whose hosting server is compromised and a malicious site is stored on it),\nrendering most traditional phishing prevention techniques obsolete. All reported URLs were\nanalyzed using Zimperium’s z9 ML-based phishing engine. In this case, z9 proactively\nblocked over 98% of the URLs, preventing the attack chain from its inception. This adds to\nthe layer of protection and security coverage for our customers.\n\nTo ensure your Android users are protected from this latest malware, we recommend a\nquick risk assessment. Inside zConsole, admins can review which apps are side-loaded\nonto the device that could be increasing the attack surface and leaving data and users at\nrisk.\n\n## Remediating a Flubot Infection on Android\n\n_Non-Zimperium Customers: If you have fallen victim to the Flubot malware on your Android_\ndevice, immediate action is necessary to avoid more risks. First, disconnect the device from\nall connections, including cellular and WiFi, by putting the device into airplane mode. Next,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe most effective way to remove the Android malware is through a factory reset. This will\nwipe the mobile device and load a fresh, clean version of the operating system. Do not\n**restore from backup if it was created after the malware installation. Installing all your user**\napplications fresh from Google Play ensures that you are downloading safe, approved, and\nsecure apps. Finally, reset all your banking passwords, enable 2FA if possible, and notify\nyour banks to increase monitoring on your account.\n\n[Not a Zimperium customer?
