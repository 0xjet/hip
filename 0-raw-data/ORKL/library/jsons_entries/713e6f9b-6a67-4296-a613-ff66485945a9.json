    "plain_text": "# The Siesta Campaign: A New Targeted Attack Awakens\n\n**[blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/the-siesta-campaign-a-new-targeted-attack-awakens/](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/the-siesta-campaign-a-new-targeted-attack-awakens/)**\n\nMarch 6, 2014\n\nIn the past few weeks, we have received several reports of targeted attacks that exploited\nvarious application vulnerabilities to infiltrate various organizations. Similar to the Safe\nCampaign, the campaigns we noted went seemingly unnoticed and under the radar. The\nattackers orchestrating the campaign we call the Siesta Campaign used multi-component\nmalware to target certain institutions that fall under the following industries:\n\nConsumer goods and services\nEnergy\nFinance\nHealthcare\nMedia and telecommunications\nPublic administration\nSecurity and defense\nTransport and traffic\n\nThreat actors don’t always rely on complex attack vectors to infiltrate an organization’s\nnetwork. Attackers can also make use of basic social engineering techniques for their victims\nto take the bait, such as in our case study below.\n\n**The Siesta Campaign: A Case Study**\n\nWe are currently investigating an incident that involved attackers sending out spear-phishing\nemails addressed to executives of an undisclosed company. These emails were sent from\nspoofed email addresses of personnel within the organization. Instead of using attachments\n\n\n-----\n\nand document exploits, this specific campaign served their malware through a legitimatelooking file download link. To lure the target into downloading the file, the attacker serves the\narchive under a URL path named after the target organization’s name as cited below:\n\n_http://{malicious domain}/{organization name}/{legitimate archive name}.zip_\n\nThis archive contains an executable (TROJ_SLOTH) disguised as a PDF document. When\nexecuted, it drops and opens a valid PDF file, which was most probably taken from the target\norganization’s website. Along with this valid PDF file, another malicious component is also\ndropped and executed in the background. This backdoor component is named\n_google{BLOCKED}.exe. (Due to the ongoing investigation, we are unfortunately unable to_\nshare hashes and filenames at this time.) This backdoor connects to\n_http://www.micro{BLOCKED}. com/index.html, which are its command-and-control (C&C)_\nservers. Trend Micro identifies these samples as BKDR_SLOTH.B. At this point, the malware\nbegins waiting for additional commands from the attacker. The encrypted commands that are\naccepted are:\n\nSleep:\n\nCommands the backdoor to sleep for specified number of minutes\nWe have received a sleep command of “sleep:120” during our analysis which\nmeans that the malware will wait for 2hrs before establishing a connection again\nto the C&C server\nDownload: <download_url>\n\nCommands the backdoor to download and execute a file (most probably another\nWin32 executable) from a specified URL\n\nThe C&C servers used in this campaign are found to be newly registered and also shortlived, making it difficult for us to track the malware's behavior. Based on our research, we\nfound 2 variants of the malware used in this campaign. Although not exactly alike, the\nbehaviors are nearly identical. One of the similar samples is a file named Questionaire\n_Concerning the Spread of Superbugs February 2014.exe (SHA1:_\n014542eafb792b98196954373b3fd13e60cb94fe). This sample drops the file UIODsevr.exe,\nits backdoor component which behaves similarly as BKDR_SLOTH.B with the addition of\ncommunicating to its C&C at skys{BLOCKED}com. These samples are identified by Trend\nMicro as [BKDR_SLOTH.A. Both variants excessively use Sleep calls, which renders the](http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/us/malware/BKDR_SLOTH.A)\nmalware dormant for varying periods of time, hence the campaign name \"Siesta\" (which\nmeans to take a short nap in Spanish). Commands are being served through HTML pages\nusing different keywords as listed below:\n\n**_Variant 1_** _prefix: “>SC<”_ **_Variant 2_** _prefix: “longDesc=”_ _suffix: “.txt”_\n\nListed below are the backdoor commands we were able to see from our analysis:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Variant 1_** _run1 – open a remote shell_ _run2 – pipe shell commands from URL1_ _run3_\n_– pipe shell commands from URL2_ _“http” – pipe shell commands from C2_ _“x_” – sleep_\n_for specified number of minutes_ **_Variant 2_** _“sleep:” – sleep for specified number of_\n_minutes_ _“download:” – download and execute another executable from C2_\n\n**Attribution**\n\nAttribution of campaigns and attack methods can often be difficult. We were able to identify\nthis new campaign through inspecting hashes, C&Cs, registrants, commands, and additional\ninformation.\n\n_Figure 1. Attribution Graph (click the thumbnail for full view)_\n\nDuring the course of our investigation into this new campaign, we investigated the malware\ndropped. We quickly noticed the registrant of sky{BLOCKED}.com is also the same registrant\nas micro{BLOCKED}.com and ifued{BLOCKED}.net. This individual used the name Li Ning\nand others with an email address of xiaomao{BLOCKED}@163.com. This individual also\nrecently registered 79 additional domains. There are a total of roughly 17,000 domains\nregistered with this same email address.\n\n_Figure 2. Domains registered under the name Li Ning, based on Whois data_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEarly detection is crucial in preventing targeted attacks from exfiltrating confidential company\ndata. Organizations and large enterprises need an advanced threat protection platform like\nTrend Micro™ Deep Discovery, which can mitigate the risks posed by targeted attacks\nthrough its various security technologies and global threat intelligence. At the heart of our\nCustom Defense solution is Deep Discovery which provides real-time local and global\nintelligence across the attack life cycle. This can help IT administrators understand the\nnature of the attack they are dealing with.\n\nTrend Micro blocks all related threats, emails and URLs associated with these attacks. As\nalways, we advise users to exercise caution when opening emails and links.
