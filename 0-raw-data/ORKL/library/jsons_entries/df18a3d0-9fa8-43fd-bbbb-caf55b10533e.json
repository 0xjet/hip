The attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/08/south-korea-cyber-attack)\nbegan in the U.S. on its independence day, and targeted institutions including the White House\nand the Pentagon. Later that week the websites of major government, financial, and media\norganizations in South Korea were hit.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese attacks were distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that aimed to take websites\n[offline. The attackers used the Dozer malware (Trojan.Dozer) to carry out these attacks. The](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2009-070814-5311-99)\nattacks, while disruptive, were relatively unsophisticated, but over the years Lazarus has refined\nits methods to carry out more sophisticated attacks. However, as can be seen in the WannaCry\nattacks to which it has been linked, it can still be prone to sloppiness.\n\n## 2011: South Korean organizations targeted again\n\nIn 2011, organizations in South Korea were yet again targeted by DDoS attacks. Similar to\n2009, a number of government and private websites were targeted, this time using a tool called\n[Trojan.Koredos. This attack was unusual for a DDoS attack because it did not use a command](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2011-030417-4602-99)\nand control (C&C) server; the commands were hidden inside the threat itself. The use of a tactic\nlike this indicated a growth in sophistication from the group compared to the 2009 attacks.\n[Symantec research into this threat also found that, as well as carrying out a DDoS attack, if the](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/trojankoredos-comes-unwelcomed-surprise)\ninfected computers were not cleared of this Trojan the master boot record (MBR) of some of\nthem would be destroyed within 10 days.\n\n\n-----\n\nSouth Korea’s capital Seoul. South Korean organizations have been frequently targeted by\nLazarus.\n\n## 2013: Attacks become more destructive\n\nIn 2013, a destructive attack against banks and local broadcasting organizations in South\nKorea was reported. The attack defaced the website of a Korean ISP and also crippled servers\nbelonging to a number of organizations. The websites of the companies affected went down in\nthis attack, with a number of the organizations affected having the hard drives of many of their\n[computers wiped. Wiping malware called Jokra (Trojan.Jokra) was used in this attack, which a](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-032014-2531-99)\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup called WhoIs originally claimed credit for in a message posted on computers during the\n[attacks. However, Symantec and other security researchers believe that the Lazarus group was](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/are-2011-and-2013-south-korean-cyberattacks-related)\nbehind this attack, as well as the two previously mentioned attacks in 2011 and 2009.\n\n[Also in 2013, researchers spotted a piece of malware called Castov (Downloader.Castov and](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/south-korean-financial-companies-targeted-castov)\n[Infostealer.Castov) targeting South Korean financial institutions and their customers. In these](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-052416-2237-99)\nattacks, which are also believed to originate from Lazarus, Castov was used to steal\npasswords, account details, and digital certificates from the computers it infected. Castov\n[(Trojan.Castov) was also used in further DDoS attacks against South Korean targets in June](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-062618-2656-99)\n2013.\n\n## The Sony attacks\n\nIt was the attack on the computer systems of Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) in 2014 that\nbrought the Lazarus group to widespread attention.\n\nThe attack on Sony Pictures became public knowledge on November 24, 2014, when Sony\nemployees turned on their computers to be greeted with the sight of a neon red skeleton and\nthe words “Hacked by GOP”, which stood for “Guardians of the Peace”. The message also\nthreatened to release data later that day if an unspecified request was not met. Over the\n[following weeks, huge swathes of information stolen from Sony were released, including:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/the-sony-pictures-hack-explained/?utm_term=.a7d06538d573)\npersonal information about employees and their families; email correspondence between\nemployees at the company; information about company salaries, unreleased Sony films, and\nother information.\n\nMuch of the leaked information, particularly some of the email correspondence between\nexecutives at the company, received a lot of coverage in the media and caused embarrassment\nfor the company.\n\nIt’s not clear how long the hackers were on Sony’s systems before they released this\ninformation, but given how much data was obtained it is likely they maintained a presence for a\nfew months at least.\n\nAs well as leaking this vast trove of data, the attackers also destroyed many computers in the\n[organization using malware identified as Backdoor.Destover. Destover is a particularly](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-120209-5631-99)\ndestructive malware that can completely wipe infected systems. It was the subject of an FBI\nFlash Warning at the time. Flash Warnings are confidential alerts sent to businesses thought to\nbe at risk from attackers. It is possible to configure Destover to only target computers in one\nparticular organization, which is likely to have been the case in the Sony attack. Some of the\n[tools and techniques used by Destover allowed researchers to link it to the previously](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/destover-destructive-malware-has-links-attacks-south-korea)\nmentioned 2013 attacks carried out against targets in South Korea, indicating the same group\nwas responsible for both these attacks.\n\nThis attack was hugely high profile and received vast media coverage, with some executives at\nSony even stepping down in its wake.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Sony attacks, where were widely attributed to Lazarus, made headlines.\n\n## 2015: Manufacturing industry in South Korea targeted\n\nIn October 2015, [Symantec found evidence that organizations in South Korea were being](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/duuzer-back-door-trojan-targets-south-korea-take-over-computers)\n[targeted by a number of malicious tools, including Backdoor.Duuzer,](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-082113-4423-99) [W32.Brambul, and](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-051114-3802-99)\n[Backdoor.Joanap. These threats all appeared to originate from the same actors and seemed to](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-092507-0410-99)\nhave a focus on the South Korean manufacturing industry. The aim of these attacks appeared\nto be to steal data and information: cyber espionage.\n\n## SWIFT attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nA cyber attack in February 2016 resulted in $81 million being stolen from the Bangladesh\nCentral Bank, with the figure likely to have been much higher but for a typo and the vigilance of\neagle-eyed bank officials who put a stop to the fraud before any more money was stolen. It is\nbelieved the attackers originally aimed to steal $1 billion.\n\nThe money was stolen through fraudulent SWIFT transactions, though the SWIFT system itself\n[was not compromised, and malware (Trojan.BanSwift) was used to cover the attackers’ tracks.](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-042523-1230-99)\n[Subsequent investigations by Symantec determined that the same attackers were behind](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/swift-attackers-malware-linked-more-financial-attacks)\nsimilar attacks on other banks in Asia, including Vietnam’s Tien Phong Bank, which said it had\nintercepted a fraudulent transfer of more than $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\n[Code sharing between the BanSwift Trojan and Backdoor.Contopee, which had previously been](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021515-4543-99)\nobserved being used by Lazarus, led researchers to determine that Lazarus was also behind\nthese attacks.\n\nThe Bangladesh bank heist was a sophisticated and complex attack. Much of the $81 million\nstolen in this attack remains unrecovered.\n\n## 2017: Banks targeted again\n\n[In February 2017, Symantec published an investigation into watering hole attacks that had](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/attackers-target-dozens-global-banks-new-malware)\nattempted to infect more than 100 organizations in 31 different countries with a previously\n[undiscovered malware called Downloader.Ratabanka. These attacks were highly targeted, with](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-020908-1134-99)\nthe majority of institutions targeted being banks, with a small number of telecoms and internet\nfirms also on the list of targets. However, there was no evidence funds were successfully stolen\nfrom any of the banks in this attack.\n\nResearchers from Symantec were able to establish a number of links between Ratabanka and\ntools previously associated with Lazarus, leading them to conclude with reasonable confidence\nthat the group was behind these attempted attacks.\n\n## WannaCry rocks the world\n\nThe [WannaCry ransomware attacks have received extensive coverage since a widespread](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-051310-3522-99)\nattack on May 12 caused the systems of many large organizations around the world, including\nthe NHS in the UK, to come to a juddering halt.\n\nSymantec discovered evidence that an earlier version of WannaCry was used in targeted\nattacks on enterprises in February, March, and April, but the leak of the EternalBlue exploit\ncode by the Shadow Brokers in April was seemingly a fortuitous occurrence for the attackers\nthat allowed them to spread the ransomware much more widely.\n\nAnalysis of the early WannaCry attacks by Symantec revealed substantial commonalities in the\n[tools, techniques, and infrastructure used by the attackers and those seen in previous Lazarus](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-show-strong-links-lazarus-group)\nattacks, making it highly likely that Lazarus was also behind the spread of WannaCry.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile it made a splash, certain errors in how WannaCry was deployed indicate a degree of\nsloppiness that may have curtailed its effectiveness. For example, while the ransomware had\ncode to provide unique Bitcoin addresses for each victim it defaulted to hardcoded addresses\nas a result of a race condition bug. This meant WannaCry couldn’t use unique Bitcoin\naddresses because of the bug so couldn’t track payments. The attackers did release a variant\n13 hours after the initial deployment of WannaCry with this bug fixed, but the vast majority of\ninfections that occurred had this bug.\n\nMuch mystery still surrounds the WannaCry attack, and Lazarus itself, but given it has been\nactive for almost a decade, this ransomware attack is unlikely to be the last we see of this\naudacious attack group.\n\n_Check out the Security Response and follow Threat Intel on to keep up-to-date with the latest_\n_happenings in the world of threat intelligence and cybersecurity._\n\n_Like this story?
