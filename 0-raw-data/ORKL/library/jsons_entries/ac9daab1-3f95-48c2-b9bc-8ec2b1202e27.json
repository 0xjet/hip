The\nmalware steals sensitive financial and private information via phishing by pretending to be a tax-filing application. We\nhave identified two main campaigns that used different fake app themes to lure in taxpayers. The first\ncampaign from November 2020 pretended to be a fake IT certificate application while the second campaign, first\nseen in May 2021, used the fake tax-filing theme. With this discovery, the McAfee Mobile Research team has been\nable to update McAfee Mobile Security so that it detects this threat as Android/Elibomi and alerts mobile users if this\nmalware is present in their devices.\n\nDuring our investigation, we found that in the latest campaign the malware is delivered using an SMS text phishing\nattack. The SMS message pretends to be from the Income Tax Department in India and uses the name of the\ntargeted user to make the SMS phishing attack more credible and increase the chances of infecting the device. The\nfake app used in this campaign is designed to capture and steal the victim’s sensitive personal and financial\ninformation by tricking the user into believing that it is a legitimate tax-filing app.\n\nWe also found that Elibomi exposes the stolen sensitive information to anyone on the Internet. The stolen data\nincludes e-mail addresses, phone numbers, SMS/MMS messages among other financial and personal identifiable\ninformation. McAfee has reported the servers exposing the data and at the time of publication of this\n\n\n-----\n\nblog the exposed information is no longer available.\n\n**Pretending to be an app from the Income Tax Department in India**\n\nThe latest and most recent Elibomi campaign uses a fake tax-filing app theme and pretends to be from the Income\nTax Department from the Indian government. They even use the original logo to trick the users into installing the app.\nThe package names (unique app identifiers) of these fake apps consist of a random word + another random string +\nimobile (e.g. “direct.uujgiq.imobile” and “olayan.aznohomqlq.imobile”). As mentioned before this campaign has been\nactive since at least May 2021.\n\n_Figure 1. Fake iMobile app pretending to be from the Income Tax Department and asking SMS permissions_\n\nAfter all the required permissions are granted, Elibomi attempts to collect personal information like email address, phone number and SMS/MMS messages stored in the infected device:\n\n_Figure 2. Elibomi stealing SMS messages_\n\n**Prevention and defense**\n\nHere are our recommendations to avoid being affected by this and other Android threats that use social engineering\nto convince users to install malware disguised as legitimate apps:\n\nHave a reliable and updated security application like McAfee Mobile Security installed in your mobile devices to\nprotect you against this and other malicious applications.\n\n\n-----\n\nDo not click on suspicious links received from text messages or social media, particularly from unknown\nsources. Always double check by other means if a contact that sends a link without context was really sent by\nthat person because it could lead to the download of a malicious application.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAndroid/Elibomi is just another example of the effectiveness of personalized phishing attacks to trick users into\ninstalling a malicious application even when Android itself prevents that from happening. By pretending to be an\n“Income Tax” app from the Indian government, Android/Elibomi has been able to gather very sensitive and private\npersonal and financial information from affected users which could be used to perform identify and/or financial fraud.\nEven more worryingly, the information was not only in cybercriminals’ hands, but it was also unexpectedly exposed\non the Internet which could have a greater impact on the victims. As long as social engineering attacks\nremain effective, we expect that cybercriminals will continue to evolve their campaigns to trick even more users with\ndifferent fake apps including ones related to financial and tax services.\n\nMcAfee Mobile Security detects this threat as Android/Elibomi and alerts mobile users if it is present.

The SMS body field in the screenshot below shows the Smishing attack\nused to deliver the malware. Interestingly, the message includes the victim’s name in order to make the message\nmore personal and therefore more credible. It also urges the user to click on a suspicious link with the excuse of\nchecking an urgent update regarding the victim’s Income Tax return:\n\n_Figure 3. Exposed information includes the SMS phishing attack used to originally deliver the malware_\n\nElibomi not only exposes stolen SMS messages, but it also captures and exposes the list of all accounts logged in\nthe infected devices:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Example of account information exposed in one of the C2 servers_\n\nIf the targeted user clicks on the link in the text message, a phishing page will be shown pretending to be from the\nIncome Tax Department from the Indian government which addresses the user by its name to make the phishing\nattack more credible:\n\n_Figure 5. Fake e-Filing phishing page pretending to be from the Income Tax Department in India_\n\nEach targeted user has a different application. For example in the screenshot below we have the\napp “cisco.uemoveqlg.imobile” on the left and “komatsu.mjeqls.imobile” on the right:\n\n_Figure 6. Different malicious applications for different users_\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our investigation, we found that there are several variants of Elibomi for the same iMobile fake Income tax\napp. For example, some iMobile apps only have the login page while in others have the option to “register” and\nrequest a fake tax refund:\n\n_Figure 7. Fake iMobile screens designed to capture personal and financial information_\n\nThe sensitive financial information provided by the tricked user is also exposed on the Internet:\n\n_Figure 8. Example of exposed financial information stolen by Elibomi using a fake tax filling app_\n\n**Related Fake IT Certificate applications**\n\nThe first Elibomi campaign pretended to be a fake “IT Certificate” app was found to be distributed in November\n2020. In the following figure we can see the similarities in the code between the two malware campaigns:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Code similarity between Elibomi campaigns_\n\nThe malicious application impersonated an IT certificate management module that is purposedly used to validate\nthe device in a non-existent verification server. Just like the most recent version of Elibomi, this fake ITCertificate app\nrequests SMS permissions but it also requests device administrator privileges, probably to make more difficult its\nremoval. The malicious application also simulates a “Security Scan” but in reality what it is doing in the background is\nstealing personal information like e-mail, phone number and SMS/MMS messages stored in the infected device:\n\n_Figure 10. Fake ITCertificate app pretending to do a security scan while it steals personal data in the background_\n\nJust like with the most recent “iMobile” campaign, this fake “ITCertificate” also exposes the stolen data in one of the\nC2 servers. Here’s an example of a stolen SMS message that uses the same log fields and structure as the “iMobile”\ncampaign:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. SMS message is stolen by the fake “ITCertificate” using the same log structure as “iMobile”_\n\n**Interesting string obfuscation technique**\n\nThe cybercriminals behind these two pieces of malware designed a simple but interesting string obfuscation\ntechnique. All strings are decoded by calling different classes and each class has a completely different table value\n\n_Figure 12. Calling the de-obfuscation method with different parameters_\n\n_Figure 13. String de-obfuscation method_\n\n_Figure 14. String de-obfuscation table_\n\nThe algorithm is a simple substitution cipher. For example, 35 is replaced with ‘h’ and 80 is replaced with ‘t’ to\nobfuscate the string\n\n\n-----\n\n**Appendix Technical Data and IOCs**\n\n**Hash** **Package name**\n\n**1e8fba3c530c3cd7d72e208e25fbf704ad7699c0a6728ab1b290c645995ddd56** direct.uujgiq.imobile\n\n**7f7b0555563e08e0763fe52f1790c86033dab8004aa540903782957d0116b87f** ferrero.uabxzraglk.imobile\n\n**120a51611a02d1d8bd404bb426e07959ef79e808f1a55ce5bff33f04de1784ac** erni.zbvbqlk.imobile\n\n**ecbd905c44b1519590df5465ea8acee9d3c155334b497fd86f6599b1c16345ef** olayan.bxynrqlq.imobile\n\n**da900a00150fcd608a09dab8a8ccdcf33e9efc089269f9e0e6b3daadb9126231** foundation.aznohomqlq.imobile\n\n**795425dfc701463f1b55da0fa4e7c9bb714f99fecf7b7cdb6f91303e50d1efc0** fresenius.bowqpd.immobile\n\n**b41c9f27c49386e61d87e7fc429b930f5e01038d17ff3840d7a3598292c935d7** cisco.uemoveqlg.immobile\n\n**8de8c8c95fecd0b1d7b1f352cbaf839cba1c3b847997c804dfa2d5e3c0c87dfe** komatsu.mjeqls.imobile\n\n**ecbd905c44b1519590df5465ea8acee9d3c155334b497fd86f6599b1c16345ef** olayan.bxynrqlq.imobile\n\n**326d81ba7a715a57ba7aa2398824b420fff84cda85c0dd143462300af4e0a37a** alstom.zjeubopqf.certificate\n\n**154cfd0dbb7eb2a4f4e5193849d314fa70dcc3caebfb9ab11b4ee26e98cb08f7** alstom.zjeubopqf.certificate\n\n**c59ecd344729dac99d9402609e248c80e10d39c4d4d712edef0df9ee460fbd7b** alstom.zjeubopqf.certificate\n\n**16284cad1b5a36e2d2ea9f67f5c772af01b64d785f181fd31d2e2bec2d98ce98** alstom.zjeubopqf.certificate\n\n**98fc0d5f914ae47b61bc7b54986295d86b502a9264d7f74739ca452fac65a179** alstom.zjeubopqf.certificate\n\n\n**32724a3d2a3543cc982c7632f40f9e831b16d3f88025348d9eda0d2dfbb75dfe**\n\n\ncomputer.yvyjmbtlk.transferInstant\n\n\n[McAfee Labs Threat Research Team](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/mcafee-labs/)\nMcAfee Labs is one of the leading sources for threat research, threat intelligence, and cybersecurity thought\nleadership.
