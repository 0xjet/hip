    "plain_text": "## 3\n\n\n**Musical Chairs is a multi-year campaign which recently deployed a new variant Gh0st we’ve**\n\n**named “Piano Gh0st.”**\n\n**Our evidence suggests the actors behind these attacks have been operating for over five years**\n\n**and have maintained a single command and control server for almost two. They use**\n\n**compromised e-mail accounts to distribute their malware widely and their targeting appears**\n\n**opportunistic rather than specific.**\n\n**The overall motivation of this campaign is unclear at this time. Gh0st is very versatile as it allows**\n\n**an adversary to take complete control over the infected system including installing additional**\n\n**malware.**\n\n**[Using Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus we have identified Gh0st variants associated with Musical](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/subscriptions/autofocus.html)**\n\n**Chairs leading back to mid 2013. The source code and building tools for Gh0st are available**\n\n**freely on the web; anyone who is so inclined can build their own version of the malware. The**\n\n**way researchers differentiate between most variants is based on their “magic tag.”**\n\n**Gh0st uses a custom TCP protocol to connect to a command and control (C2) server and**\n\n**retrieve instructions from the attacker. The malware identifies itself to the server by sending a**\n\n**string of characters (the magic tag), which the server repeats back to confirm the connection**\n\n**(See Figure 1.)**\n\n**In the original version this string was “Gh0st” but in subsequent versions many different strings**\n\n**are used. These strings, along with the actual location of the command and control server**\n\n**(domain and/or IP address) allow us to associate various Gh0st samples with a single attacker**\n\n**[or group. In 2011, Norman released a paper that showed many clusters of Gh0st samples that](http://download01.norman.no/documents/ThemanyfacesofGh0stRat.pdf)**\n\n**were connected based on these tags.**\n\n**Figure 1. Gh0st “magic tag” value sent over custom TCP protocol**\n\n**Using these tags in the network traffic, the command and control infrastructure and other**\n\n**characteristics of the attacks, we have grouped together a series of attacks into the one**\n\n**campaign, named Musical Chairs.**\n\n**The functionality of Gh0stRat (3.6) is well documented by multiple sources and is summarized**\n\n**below:**\n\n**Keylogging**\n\n**Remote terminal access**\n\n**Remote audio and video access**\n\n|Col1|POSTED BY: Brandon Levene, Robert Falcone and Jen Miller-Osborn on September 8, 2015 12:15 PM|\n|---|---|\n|44||\n|LLiikkee|FILED IN: Malware, Threat Prevention, Unit 42 TAGGED: AutoFocus, Gh0st, Gh0stRat, Musical Chairs, Piano Gh0st, WildFire The Gh0st malware is a widely used remote administration tool (RAT) that originated in China in the early 2000s.

Additionally, the phishing**\n\n**messages are sent from US-based residential ISP e-mail addresses. The accounts themselves**\n\n**appear to be legitimate, and are likely also compromised by this actor. In many cases the**\n\n**phishing e-mails are sent indiscriminately to all e-mail addresses in an infected user’s address**\n\n**book, including “no-reply” addresses a human operator would know to ignore.**\n\n**While Gh0st itself does not have built in e-mailing components, it is also possible that an**\n\n**additional payload is responsible for the propagation via e-mail.**\n\n**The following list contains known filenames of attachments used in the delivery stage of the**\n\n**Musical Chairs campaign:**\n\n**“Pleasantly Surprised.exe”**\n\n**“Beautiful Girls.exe”**\n\n**“Sexy Girls.exe”**\n\n**“gift card.exe”**\n\n**“amazon gift card.pdf.exe”**\n\n**The subject of the e-mails carrying these files typically matches the filename itself and does not**\n\n**contain any sophisticated attempts at social engineering.

At the center of the infrastructure for the**\n\n**last two years is a Windows 2003 server using the IP address 98.126.67.114. The server uses**\n\n**a US-based IP address, but displays a Chinese language interface for Remote Desktop**\n\n**connections.**\n\n**Figure 2. Chinese language Windows Server 2003 login banner on Gh0st C2**\n\n**Thus far Unit 42 has identified 32 different Gh0st samples connecting to this server dating back**\n\n**to July of 2013. The Gh0st C2 software operates on Windows and allows the attacker to specify**\n\n**which port it should listen on for connections from infected systems. The attacker may host**\n\n**multiple Gh0st C2s on this server at one time, or may change the hosting TCP port very**\n\n**frequently.

Diagram of relationships between Musical Chairs C2 domains and related**\n\n**infrastructure**\n\n**These many related domains put the approximate start date of this campaign in 2010. The**\n\n**earliest versions of the attacks we’ve found are still visible in e-mail groups and public Facebook**\n\n**postings.

The files are delivered**\n\n**as a self-extracting executable (SFW) that acts as the dropper. It is responsible for extracting its**\n\n**payload to “c:\\microsoft\\lib\\ke\\Piano.dll” and executes the “mystart” function within the DLL’s**\n\n**export address table (EAT) using rundll32.exe.**\n\n**Figure 7. Screenshot of calls observed by Palo Alto Wildfire from within the AutoFocus interface.**\n\n**The “Piano.dll” file itself has very little functionality other than decrypting, loading and running**\n\n**an embedded DLL. It decrypts the embedded DLL using the Blowfish symmetric cipher with a**\n\n**simple key consisting of the character “y”. “Piano.dll” proceeds to load the newly decrypted DLL**\n\n**manually and calls the exported function “my start”. The decrypted DLL has the following**\n\n**attributes:**\n\n**MD5: 8182a33cc1268c0c3b4e3d9a02d912c9**\n\n**SHA256: 32026e702cff8fd3f113473ea2698eab0ca181aa2d0fd0e8802e31aa3befa94a**\n\n**Type: PE32 executable for MS Windows (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit**\n\n**Size: 148008 bytes**\n\n**Imphash: 9c01d71c9bf78d231a313c86540e284c**\n\n**Compiled: 2015-07-14 02:11:32**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This embedded DLL is the actor Gh0stRat Trojan, specifically version 3.6.
