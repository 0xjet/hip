While the FBI was on the verge of disrupting REvil, the\ncybercriminals shut down their operation.\n\nWhen REvil restarted its business, they restored from the backups that had been infiltrated\nby the FBI before the gang closed shop.\n\n\n-----\n\n## DarkSide money recovered by the FBI\n\nDarkSide's attack on Colonial Pipeline was the last one from DarkSide under this name.\n[Until then, the ransomware gang had collected at least $90 million from its victims.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-made-90-million-in-just-nine-months/)\n\nHowever, they chose their last target poorly, since its operations supplied petroleum\nproducts to markets and refineries on the U.S. East Coast accounting for 45% of all fuel\nconsumed in the region.\n\nEven if Colonial Pipeline paid the 75 BTC (around $5 million at the time) ransom,\nthe [consequences of the attack were too much for the DoJ not to treat it with top priority.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-declares-state-of-emergency-after-ransomware-hits-largest-pipeline/)\n\n[On June 7, the DoJ announced that it recovered 63.7 bitcoins of the ransom Colonial](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-recovers-most-of-colonial-pipelines-44m-ransomware-payment/)\nPipeline paid to DarkSide to recover their systems as fast as possible.\n\n[DarkSide then exited the ransomware business only to emerge as BlackMatter.
