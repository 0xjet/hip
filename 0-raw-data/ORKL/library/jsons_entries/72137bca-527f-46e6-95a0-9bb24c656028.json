For 46 years, the Cates have welded many things — fertilizer\ntanks, jet-fighter parts, cheese molds, even a farmer’s broken glasses.\n\nAnd like many small businesses, they have a dusty old computer humming away in the back\noffice. On this one, however, an unusual spy-versus-spy battle is playing out: The machine\nhas been taken over by Chinese hackers.\n\nThe hackers use it to plan and stage attacks. But unbeknown to them, a Silicon Valley startup is tracking them here, in real time, watching their every move and, in some cases,\nblocking their efforts.\n\n“When they first told us, we said, ‘No way,’” Mr. Cate said one afternoon recently over pizza\nand cheese curds, recalling when he first learned the computer server his family used to\nmanage its welding business had been secretly repurposed. “We were totally freaked out,”\nMs. Cate said. “We had no idea we could be used as an infiltration unit for Chinese attacks.”\n\n\n-----\n\nOn a recent Thursday, the hackers targets appeared to be a Silicon Valley food delivery\nstart-up, a major Manhattan law firm, one of the world’s biggest airlines, a prominent\nSouthern university and a smattering of targets across Thailand and Malaysia. The New York\nTimes viewed the action on the Cates’ computer on the condition that it not name the targets.\n\nThe activity had the hallmarks of Chinese hackers known as the C0d0s0 group, a collection\nof hackers for hire that the security industry has been tracking for years. Over the years, the\ngroup has breached banks, law firms and tech companies, and once hijacked the Forbes\nwebsite to try to infect visitors’ computers with malware.\n\nThere is a murky and much hyped emerging industry in selling intelligence about attack\ngroups like the C0d0s0 group. Until recently, companies typically adopted a defensive\nstrategy of trying to make their networks as impermeable as possible in hopes of repelling\nattacks. Today, so-called threat intelligence providers sell services that promise to go on the\noffensive. They track hackers, and for annual fees that can climb into the seven figures, they\ntry to spot and thwart attacks before they happen.\n\nThese companies have a mixed record of success. Still, after years of highly publicized\nincidents, Gartner, a market research company, expects the market for threat intelligence to\nreach $1 billion next year, up from $255 million in 2013.\n\nRemarkably, many attacks rely on a tangled maze of compromised computers including\nthose mom-and-pop shops like Cate Machine & Welding. The hackers aren’t after the Cates’\ndata. Rather, they have converted their server, and others like it, into launchpads for their\nattacks.\n\nThese servers offer the perfect cover. They aren’t terribly well protected, and rarely, if ever,\ndo the owners discover that their computers have become conduits for spies and digital\nthieves. And who would suspect the Cate family?\n\nTwo years ago, the Cates received a visit from men informing them that their server had\nbecome a conduit for Chinese spies. The Cates asked: “Are you from the N.S.A.?”\n\nImage\nCate Machine & Welding, a family-run business in rural Wisconsin, is at the center of a spyversus-spy battle.Credit...Lauren Justice for The New York Times\nOne of the men had, in fact, worked at the National Security Agency years before joining a\nstart-up company, Area 1, that focuses on tracking digital attacks against businesses. “It’s\nlike being a priest,” said Blake Darché, Area 1’s chief security officer, of his N.S.A.\nbackground. “In other people’s minds, you never quite leave the profession.”\n\nMr. Darché wanted to add the Cates’ server to Area 1’s network of 50 others that had been\nco-opted by hackers. Area 1 monitors the activity flowing into and out of these computers to\nglean insights into attackers’ methods, tools and websites so that it can block them from\n\n\n-----\n\nhitting its clients networks, or give them a heads-up days, weeks or even months before they\nhit.\n\nThe Cates called a family meeting. “People work really hard to make products, and they’re\ngetting stolen,” Ms. Cate said. “It seemed like the least we could do.” Area 1 paid for the\ninstallation cost, about $150.\n\nShortly after installing a sensor on the machine, Mr. Darché said his hunch was confirmed:\nThe sensor lit up with attacks. Area 1 began to make out the patterns of a familiar adversary:\nthe C0d0s0 group.\n\nArea 1 was founded by three former N.S.A. analysts, Mr. Darché, Oren Falkowitz and Phil\nSyme. The three sat side by side at Fort Meade, tracking and, in some cases, penetrating\nadversaries’ weapons systems for intelligence. A little over two years ago, they decided to\nstart their own company and raised $25.5 million in funding from major venture capitalists\nand security entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, including Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers and\nCowboy Ventures, and security veterans like Ray Rothrock, the chief executive of RedSeal,\nand Derek Smith, the chief executive of Shape Security.\n\nArea 1 is a new player in threat intelligence, a nascent subsector of the security business\nthat includes companies like iSight Partners and Recorded Future that track attackers in\nunderground web forums and on social media, gleaning intelligence about them.\n\nThreat intelligence is still more art than science. The jury is still out on whether companies\nare equipped to use that intelligence to thwart hackers. Area 1 claims that it can head off\nattacks through the compromised servers it is tracking. It can also use its vantage point to\nsee where attackers are setting up shop on the web and how they plan to target their\nintended victims.\n\nA handful of Area 1 customers confirmed that its technology had helped head off attackers.\nOne client, a chief information security officer at a large health care provider, said the health\ncare sector had been slammed by digital criminals and governments in recent years. He\nasked that the company not be named, to avoid becoming a more visible target.\n\nHe credited Area 1’s sensors with blocking several attacks on his network, helping his\ncompany avoid the fates of the health insurer Anthem, which was breached by Chinese\nhackers last year, and a growing number of hospitals hit by attacks that have forced them to\npay a ransom to get important information back.\n\nMr. Smith, the chief executive of Shape Security, said Area 1 gave his company warning of\nthree attacks before they happened, providing time to block them. Mr. Smith said he was\nimpressed enough that he made a small investment in Area 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nMany of these mom-and-pop shops are ambivalent because the attacks don t directly\nimpact their business and revenue,” he said. “Meanwhile, they unwittingly operate this attack\ninfrastructure.”\n\nBut Area 1’s business model can pose ethical dilemmas. What does the company do when it\nsees attacks against prominent companies and government agencies who are not Area 1\ncustomers?\n\n“We think of ourselves as a bodyguard, not a police force that runs around telling everyone\nthey’re a victim,” said Mr. Falkowitz, Area 1’s chief executive. “We’re in the business of preemption.”\n\nImage\nTools used by the Cate family at its welding shop in Belleville, Wis.Credit...Lauren Justice for\nThe New York Times\nThey do warn some victims, he said. For instance, they tipped off a law firm, a manufacturer,\na financial services firm and electronics company that were attacked via the Cates’ server\nafter they saw the C0d0s0 hackers make off with their intellectual property. Some of those\nvictims, including the law firm, later signed up for Area 1 services.\n\nNot all companies heed the warning. A security consultant for one victim, who spoke on the\ncondition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements, said that his client chose not\nto act on a tip from Area 1 last year out of concern that a scandal over a successful online\nattack against the company would jeopardize its recent acquisition. It figured its acquirer\nwould not have been thrilled to learn that the start-up’s proprietary technology was now in\nChinese hacker’s hands.\n\nPosted on the wall of Area 1’s headquarters in a historic house in Redwood City, Calif., is a\nlist titled “45 Things That Are Harder Than Cybersecurity.” It includes flight, solar power, the\nflu vaccine, brain surgery, the internet, heart transplants, skyscrapers, the Thermos and the\nQ-tip.\n\nMr. Falkowitz disagrees with a growing concern that it is too difficult or impossible to stop\nonline attacks. As attackers have grown more sophisticated, many security companies have\nstopped believing they can block attacks with traditional defenses like antivirus software.\nInstead, many focus on trying to detect an intrusion “in real time,” to catch hackers before\nthey steal too much.\n\nEighty percent of the time, victims learn they have been breached only when law\nenforcement or someone else shows up with their stolen data, according to Verizon, which\ntracks breach data.\n\nAt the N.S.A., Mr. Falkowitz had worked with teams that detected North Korean missile\nlaunches. Much of that early work was done with satellites that would look for sudden heat\nblasts\n\n\n-----\n\nEventually, Mr. Falkowitz s team tried a more proactive approach. If they could hack the\ncomputers that controlled the missile launch systems, they could glean launch schedules.\nArea 1 is now taking a similar approach to digital attacks, tapping into the attackers’\nlaunchpads, as it were, rather than waiting for them to attack.\n\nHackers don’t just press a big red “attack” button one day. They do reconnaissance, scout\nout employees on LinkedIn, draft carefully worded emails to trick unsuspecting employees to\nopen them and click on links or email attachments that will try to launch malicious attacks.\n\nOnce they persuade a target to click — and 91 percent of attacks start this way, according to\nTrend Micro, the security firm — it takes time to crawl through a victim’s network to find\nsomething worth taking. Then they have to pull that data off the network. The process can\ntake weeks, months, even years and leaves a digital trail.\n\nArea 1 watches for this kind of activity and then teams up with firms like Blue Coat, a web\nsecurity company, to build what it has learned into security software that can try to block\nattacks when they come.\n\nThe owners of Cate Machine & Welding say that living with Chinese attackers in your office\ncan be a strange feeling. Recently, Area 1 executives visited the shop and showed them\nsome of what they had learned from watching their computer. The C0d0s0 group had used\ntheir server to pilfer a law firm’s due diligence on an impending acquisition, a financial\nservices firm’s confidential trading plans, a mobile payment start-up’s proprietary source\ncode, some blueprints and loan applications at a mortgage company.\n\nHearing that, Mr. Cate expressed pride — and maybe even a hint of schadenfreude. For\nyears, the welding business that is his family’s bread and butter has been migrating to China.\nNow his family is helping American businesses fight back.\n\n“We want to do the right thing for these businesses,” Mr. Cate said, “For our country.”\n\n\n-----",
