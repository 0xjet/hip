    "plain_text": "# FASTCash and Associated Intrusion Techniques\n\n### By Kevin Perlow\n\n## Key Points\n\n  - ISO 8583 is a standard that applies to card payments and provides a common set of data fields\nand a common format for these fields during these financial transactions.\n\n  - Since at least 2018, a DPRK-nexus threat group has used malware that incorporates this\nstandard to perform large-scale fraudulent cash withdrawals against a small group of victims.\n\n  - Public reporting refers to this technique – and the malware used to carry it out – as FASTCash.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nSince at least 2016, a DPRK-nexus threat group[1] has conducted financially-motived intrusions against\ncompanies within or associated with the banking sector. Traditionally, these attacks have involved\ncomplicated, long-term workflows and culminate in large SWIFT transactions to threat group-owned\naccounts held at other banks.\n\nSince 2018 – and possibly as early as 2016 – this threat group has also conducted a novel type of attack\nin which it injected malware into a bank’s payment switch, forcing it to approve fraudulent transactions\noriginating from attacker-controlled Automated Teller Machines (ATM). This technique relies on the\nmanipulation and fraudulent creation of fields within ISO 8583 messages sent to and from these payment\nswitches. Public sources refer to this technique and its associated malware as FASTCash.[i]\n\nThis whitepaper supplements a portion of a BlackHat 2020 presentation that details the ISO8583\nstandard and the FASTCash malware. It offers two key additions to the presented slides. First, this paper\nprovides additional technical details regarding each known FASTCash variant. Second, this paper\nprovides details regarding additional tools from this threat group.[2]\n\n1 Different vendors and government agencies classify this activity using different – and often conflicting –\nmonikers and clusters. To avoid confusion, this paper does not use any of these designations and\nfocuses solely on a set of specific tools that share code-level characteristics or can be linked through\ninformation available on public and semi-public platforms such as VirusTotal.\n\n2 Due to the sensitive nature of the operational context in which the threat group used (and continues to\nuse) these tools, this paper limits its data to sourcing available to the general public and broader security\ncommunity; however, the author notes that sensitive source information strongly corroborates the\noperational relationships shared by these tools. This paper also limits its discussion to tooling used\nthrough 2019 to prevent the adversary from strengthening its own operational security posture.\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\n## ISO 8583 and FASTCash\n\n### ISO 8583\n\nISO 8583 is a widely-adopted financial standard that specifies a common set of fields and a common\nformat for these fields during card transactions. In short:\n\n  - Card transactions at ATMs and Point of Sale (PoS) devices generate ISO8583 messages.\n\n  - These messages contain key transaction information, such as the user’s account number.\n\n  - These messages are sent to a payment switch controlled by the institution that issued the card.\n\n  - The payment switch processes these messages and sends them to the card issuer (bank).\n\n  - The issuer generates an ISO 8583 response message and sends it to the payment switch.\n\n  - The payment switch processes this response and sends it back to the ATM or PoS that originated\nthe message.\n\nThe payment switch is the critical point in this process, as financial institutions and financial software and\nhardware developers implement ISO 8583 slightly differently.\n\n**Representative workflow for ISO 8583 transactions**\n\nISO 8583 Message Format\n\nISO 8583 messages contain information that a bank needs to approve or reject a transaction. There are\nover one hundred possible fields that specify information such as a user’s account number, the currency\ncode used for a balance inquiry, or the amount for a transaction.[ii] [iii]\n\nISO 8583 messages contain a:\n\n1) **Message Type Identifier, consisting of:**\n\na. ISO 8583 Version\nb. Message Classification (e.g. Authorization, Financial, Chargeback)\nc. Message Function (e.g. Request, Response)\nd. Message Source\n\n2) **Bitmap, which specifies which data fields are present in a message. Because there are over one**\n\nhundred possible data fields, messages only contain the fields used. The bitmap (and, if needed,\nsecondary bitmap) allows the payment switch to understand what to look for.\n\n3) **Data Elements, containing the actual data indicated by the bitmap. The data elements make up**\n\nthe majority of the message.[3]\n\n3 The FASTCash malware contains numerous functions that refer to these as “fields.” Data Element is the “official”\nterm, but sources often use these terms interchangeably.\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\nThe snippet below represents a sample ISO 8583 message, with different message parts and data\nelements highlighted.\n\n\n### 020042000400000000021612345678901234560609173030011456789ABC10001234 56789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012 345678901234567890123456789\n\n\nDeconstructed, this message indicates the following:\n\n  - **MTI – 0200**\n\n`o` Version: 0 (1987)\n`o` Classification: 2 (Financial Message),\n`o` Function: 0 (Request)\n`o` Source: 0 (Acquirer)\n\n  - **Bitmap –** 4200040000000002\n\n`o` Indicates data elements 2, 7, 22, 63\n\n  - **Data Elements**\n\n`o` DE 2 (PAN) – 2 digits indicating length + PAN\n\n          - 16 + 161234567890123456\n\n`o` DE 7 (Transmission Date/Time)\n\n          - 0609173030 = 06-09 17:30:30 UTC\n\n`o` DE 22 (Point of Service Entry Mode)– 2 digits for mode + 1 digit indicating PIN availability\n\n          - 011 = 01 (Manual Entry) + 1 (PIN entry available at terminal)\n\n`o` DE 63 – Reserved for private use\n\nThe actual process for decoding a bitmap is out of scope for this paper, but an excellent resource\ndiscussing the structure and methodology for doing so is available online,[iv] as are several tools that\nperform the decoding automatically.[v]\n\nDifferent payment switches implement slightly different requirements for each data field; for example, an\nolder publicly available ISO 8583 document for MasterCard Debit Switch indicated that all 02xx (1987,\nFinancial) messages require DE 43, the Card Acceptor Name and Location, to “satisfy national regulatory\nrequirements.”[vi] This is therefore a custom (and practical) requirement, rather than a part of the standard.\n\nSimilarly, different financial institutions use or opt not to use several “private fields.” For example, DE 127\nis referenced in the Windows version of the FASTCash malware. MasterCard Debit Switch documentation\ndefers to proprietary Customer Processing Systems for this field’s use,[vii] Star Northeast expects it to\ncontain data used for certain types of preauthorization,[viii] and RuPay expects it to contain biometric data\nin a tag-length-value (TLV) format.[ix] These differences limit visibility into the purpose of the particular\nreference within the malware.\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n### FASTCash\n\nFASTCash refers to a malware family and technique that relies on the ISO 8583 standard to authorize\nfraudulent ATM withdrawals. The attackers inject the FASTCash malware into the process on the\npayment switch responsible for receiving these transactions. The malware intercepts incoming messages\nby hooking the send and recv functions:\n\n  - If the transactions meet a certain criteria, they are approved without ever reaching the bank. The\nmalware can support both a withdrawal request and a balance inquiry request.\n\n  - If they do not meet the criteria, they are passed to and from the bank as a regular transaction.\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) first publicly disclosed the FASTCash\nmalware in 2018 in a Malware Analysis Report (MAR) containing brief descriptions for two variants[4] of this\nmalware as well as descriptions of associated tools. This report examines workflows for:\n\n**MD5 Hash** **Classification** **Description**\n\nA likely earlier version of the malware that\n\n46b318bbb72ee68c9d9183d78e79fb5a AIX Type 1 contains IP whitelisting but no card\n\nblacklisting.\n\nA version of the malware with a placeholder\nfor a blacklisting function and a consolidated\n\nd790997dd950bb39229dc5bd3c2047ff AIX Type 2 message generating structure.

This\nversion was uploaded to VirusTotal in 2019\nand first referenced publicly in 2020.[x] [5]\n\n4 DHS actually included three hashes in its disclosure, but this whitepaper considers two of the three FASTCash files\nin the DHS report to be the same variant.\n\n5 Several aspects of this public report contain technical inaccuracies, but the report correctly lists a hash for the\nWindows FASTCash malware.\n\n4\n\n|MD5 Hash|Classification|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|46b318bbb72ee68c9d9183d78e79fb5a|AIX Type 1|A likely earlier version of the malware that contains IP whitelisting but no card blacklisting.|\n|d790997dd950bb39229dc5bd3c2047ff|AIX Type 2|A version of the malware with a placeholder for a blacklisting function and a consolidated message generating structure.

Appears to be a “port” and update of AIX type two, with a fully functional blacklisting feature and similar message generating logic. This version was uploaded to VirusTotal in 2019 and first referenced publicly in 2020.x 5|\n\n\n-----\n\nAIX Type 1\n\nThe first FASTCash sample is presumed to be the oldest, and contains several core libraries that are\nimplemented or replicated within newer versions of the malware. The AIX versions of this malware\ncontain descriptive function names that indicate ISO 8583 interaction, including the following:\n\n  - DL_ISO8583_MSG_GetField_Str\n\n  - DL_ISO8583_MSG_SetField_Str\n\n  - CopyMsgFieldStr\n\nThese functions operate with a consistent pattern. Prior to the function calls, the malware loads an integer\ninto register 3. This integer indicates the field being copied, retrieved, or set. For the “SetField_Str” call,\nthe malware also loads a string into register 0. This string represents the data that will be placed in a field.\n\n**The Field 0[6] value being set to the string “0100” indicating an authorization response message**\n\n**Retrieval of the Field 2 (PAN) value**\n\nFinally, string references are all contained within a single section of the program. The malware points to\nthis section and provides an offset. The string begins at this offset and continues until the first null byte.\n\n**Strings within the AIX malware**\n\n6 Although the ISO 8583 standard does not describe a field designated as “0”, FASTCash considers “Field 0” to be\nthe MTI, likely for practical purposes.\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\nWith these core concepts in place, the following graph depicts the general workflow for the AIX Type 1\nversion of the FASTCash malware. Ovals represent an actual function name defined within the malware,\nand rectangles represent an action taken or set of data retrieved.\n\nThe AIX malware begins with an IP address check called from the NewRead workflow, shown in the\nimage below. The malware expects valid messages to be sent from a specific internal IP address.\n\n**NewRead function (left) calling CheckSock (middle and right) to validate message origination**\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware performs an apparent set of “flag” checks; although their purpose is unconfirmed,\ndebugging strings suggest that these ensure that a “block” flag isn’t set and that memory was properly\nallocated prior to continuing.\n\nIf these checks are passed, the malware calls a function named GetMsgInfo to retrieve Field 2 (PAN),\nField 3 (Processing Code), Field 60, and the MTI from the message. Field 60 is a “Private/Reserved” field.\nExamples of its use include holding the “Advice Reason Code”[xi] or “Additional EMV Information.”[xii]\n\n**NewRead function (left) calling GetMsgInfo, which uses GetFieldStr to retrieve message fields**\n\nThe malware then checks the PAN against a whitelist of cards. If it finds a match, it can take one of three\noptions:\n\n  - GenerateResponseTransaction1\n\n  - GenerateResponseTransaction2\n\n  - GenerateResponseInquiry1\n\nThe first two provide a mechanism for FASTCash to approve a fraudulent withdrawal request from\nattacker-controlled cards. Combine with a whitelist, this allows the attackers to ensure that _only their_\ncards cause this behavior. A full-scale cash-out would dispense money to non-attackers and would likely\nresult in earlier detection.\n\nIn each of these two functions, the malware uses CopyMsgFieldStr to copy data from the original\nmessage to construct a portion of a response. The malware sets one of two response codes in Field 39 –\nresponse code 51 (“Insufficient Funds”) in the event of an error, or response code 00 (“Approved”) for\nsuccessful construction of a new message. The malware also generates a random withdrawal amount as\npart of the message.\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\n**Portions of the “GenerateResponseTransaction1” Workflow**\n\nThe two GenerateResponseTransaction functions are nearly identical, with the primary difference residing\nin the fields that each one copies. One possibility for this discrepancy is that the environment in which the\nmalware operated supported multiple types of ISO 8583 transactions, including some that did not require\nthe Track 2 data omitted in the second transaction type; unfortunately, without access to the environment\nthis remains speculation.\n\n**Transaction 1                                  Transaction 2**\n\n\n\n- 2 – PAN\n\n- 3 – Processing Code\n\n- 4 – Amount, Transaction\n\n- 7 – Transaction Date and Time\n\n- 11 – System Trace Audit Number\n\n- 14 – Date, Expiration\n\n- 19 – Acquiring Country Code\n\n- 22 – POS Entry Mode\n\n- 25 – POS Condition Code\n\n- 32 – Acquiring Identification Code\n\n- 35 – Track 2 Data\n\n- 37 – Retrieval Reference Number\n\n- 41 – Card Acceptor Terminal ID\n\n- 42 – Card Acceptor ID\n\n- 44 – Additional Response Data\n\n- 49 – Currency Code, Transaction\n\n- 62 – INF Data (binary)\n\n- 63 – Network Data (binary)\n\n\n\n- 2 – PAN\n\n- 3 – Processing Code\n\n- 4 – Amount, Transaction\n\n- 7 – Transaction Date and Time\n\n- 11 – System Trace Audit Number\n\n- 14 – Date, Expiration\n\n- 19 – Acquiring Country Code\n\n- 22 – POS Entry Mode\n\n- 25 – POS Condition Code\n\n- 32 – Acquiring Identification Code\n\n- 35 – Track 2 Data\n\n- 37 – Retrieval Reference Number\n\n- 41 – Card Acceptor Terminal ID\n\n- 42 – Card Acceptor ID\n\n- 44 – Additional Response Data\n\n- 49 – Currency Code, Transaction\n\n- 62 – INF Data (binary)\n\n- 63 – Network Data (binary)\n\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final possible action, GenerateReponseInquiry1, allows the malware to fraudulently construct a\nresponse to a balance inquiry issued by an attacker. Structurally, this workflow is similar to the workflows\nwithin the ReponseTransaction routines; however, this action clearly serves a specific purpose. While the\nattacker’s intent cannot be certain, a likely explanation is that this allows the attacker to test if the\nmalware is properly intercepting ISO 8583 messages without actually performing a cash withdrawal.\n\nFrom a threat intelligence standpoint, this function contains valuable information: the results of a balance\ninquiry are placed in Field 54 (Additional Amounts) using a format string:\n\ncc01356Cdddddddddddd\n\nThis format string consists of four key segments:[xiii] [xiv]\n\n  - Account Type – Two digits (e.g. 10 for a Savings Account or 20 for a Checking Account)[xv]\n\n  - Amount Type – The type of balance shown to the user (01, Ledger Balance)\n\n  - Currency Code – The currency units for the balance shown (356, Indian Rupee)\n\n  - Balance – Type Digit (0, C, D) + Amount (12 digits)\n\nThis sample of the malware will always return a Credit Amount in units of the Indian Rupee. From a threat\nintelligence standpoint, this information hints that that victim is located in India or a country that would be\nexpected to use this currency. As with the transactions, the returned value is randomized.\n\nDuring legitimate behavior, this type of workflow would be expected when a user opts to check their\naccount balances at an ATM preceding or following a transaction. However, because this malware\nintercepts the message before it reaches the bank and randomizes the response, the value has no actual\nbearing on anything tied to the account or card.\n\n**Format string and currency constant within GenerateResponseInquiry1 function**\n\nFollowing these three branches, the malware finalizes the message and logs that it has successfully\nblocked it (or, if these workflows were bypassed due a PAN not being on the whitelist, logs that it passed)\nbefore sending the response back to the original source.\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\nAIX Type 2\n\nThe second AIX variant contains a similar set of function names and at a high level serves the same\npurpose: the malware either fraudulently approves withdrawal requests or responds to attacker-owned\nbalance inquiry requests. However, this version contains two significant changes:\n\n  - An incomplete “blacklist” function (later completed for the Windows version)\n\n  - A more streamlined workflow for responding to balance inquiries and transaction requests\n\nAs the workflow graph shows, this AIX variant foregoes the three separate response functions and\nconsolidates them into a single function call. This creates several efficiencies for the malware developers:\nrather than writing nearly identical code for three slightly different functions, this version applies one set of\nlogic to all three possible response options.\n\nAs part of this function, the malware checks that the message type is an x200 (Financial Request)\nmessage and sets the response to x210 (Financial Response).\n\n  - If the Processing Code starts with 3, the malware will return a balance inquiry response using the\nsame currency code (356, Indian Rupee) as the AIX Type 1 variant.\n\n  - If the Processing Code does not start with 3, the malware will fraudulently approve the transaction\nrequest.\n\n  - There is a third workflow available that open source reporting[xvi] suggests is affiliated with a\nblacklist function, although this is unconfirmed given that the blacklist function is incomplete in\nthis version.\n\nThis logic aligns with high level details provided in a Symantec report in November 2018,[xvii] although the\nresearchers did not list an analyzed hash to verify that this was the file examined.\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\n**Consolidated response logic in AIX Type 2 variant**\n\n**Overhead workflow for performing 0x200, 90, and blacklist checks**\n\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\nWindows\n\nThe Windows variant of FASTCash closely resembles the AIX Type 2 version, with the following changes:\n\n  - A completed blacklist function\n\n  - Additional checks prior to generating a response message\n\n  - Stripped function names (due to the programming language change)\n\n  - Support for Field 127, a Private/Reserved field likely specific to the target environment\n\nDespite the function name stripping, many functions within this variant are nearly identical to their AIX\ncounterparts. The graph below therefore uses the same or similar names where appropriate.\n\nThe malware performs an IP address check to determine if the message originates from one of two\nhardcoded IP addresses. It then retrieves an initial set of fields, including the MTI and verifies that the\nmessage is either an x100 (Authorization) or x200 (Financial) request. After validating the PAN against\nboth a whitelist and a blacklist, the malware proceeds to a “Process” function similar to AIX Type 2.\n\nThe Process function calls a parent function that performs three additional actions:\n\n1) The parent function calls GetField_Str to retrieve Field 0 (MTI) and Field 22 (POS Entry Mode)\n2) The parent function checks that digits 3 and 4 in the MTI are “00” (ensuring it is a “request”)\n3) The parent function checks if the POS Entry Mode begins with a “9” (indicating a card\n\ntransaction)\n\nFollowing these checks, the malware calls the function responsible for generating the response message.\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\nWithin the response message function, the malware once again validates several fields. The malware\nretrieves Fields 3, 4, 11, and 49 plus the MTI – if it cannot retrieve one of these fields, the malicious\nworkflow exits.\n\n**Validation of field data within MakeResponse_Msg function**\n\nIf these checks pass, the malware follows a workflow similar to the AIX Type 2 version. It will:\n\n  - Generate a balance response inquiry if the first digit in the processing code is a 3\n\n  - Generate a fraudulent withdrawal if the first digit in the processing code is a 0\n\n  - Generate an “Invalid PIN” response if the first digit of the processing code is neither 0 nor 3\n\n**Decision workflow**\n\nThe malware once again uses a format string for the balance inquiry; however, this time the currency\ncode is set to 949, the Turkish Lira. As with the previous two variants, the malware uses randomized\namounts for these workflows.\n\nFollowing this routine, the malware finalizes the response message and transmits it back to the\noriginating device, using functions similar to the previous two variants.\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\n## Tooling Clusters\n\n### Timeline\n\nFASTCash can be associated with other tools from the same threat group based on shared code\ncharacteristics and inferred operational relationships through VirusTotal submissions. Discussing\nindividual operations is outside of the scope of this paper; however, sensitive sourcing corroborates these\nrelationships at an operational level.\n\nDuring its FASTCash and SWIFT operations, the threat group also uses:\n\n  - A keylogger\n\n  - PowerShell-based backdoors\n\n  - PowerShell-based installers\n\n  - Process injectors\n\nThe graph below demonstrates how these tools are related at a code and operational level. This graph\n(and the subsequent tool descriptions) omits a select set of tools that the attacker continues to use as of\nJuly 2020 that have not been publicly described. Hashes for the listed files are included at the end of the\npaper.\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\n### Fake Resume Generator and Secondary Payload\n\nThe Fake Resume Generator likely represents the one of the group’s entry-stage tools to gain a foothold\non a victim’s network. This tool typically purports to belong to a legitimate company, often in the payment\nprocessing or interbank network sectors.\n\nThere are multiple versions of this tool, but in general this program performs the following steps:\n\n1) Downloads or runs a PowerShell-based backdoor\n2) Opens a window for the user to enter resume-related information\n3) Generates a PDF with this information\n\nThe malicious actions occur regardless of whether or not the victim actually generates the PDF. One\nsecond-stage payload, likely related to a late-2018 attack based on relationship information available on\nVirusTotal,[xviii] supported C2-initiated command-line execution, secure file deletion, and file writing/running\nof additional payloads. This tool also installed itself as either a scheduled task or a service for\npersistence.\n\n### PSLogger Keylogger/Screenshot Grabber\n\nThe keylogger and screen grabber is delivered via PowerShell and executable injectors, likely on targets\nidentified as being both higher priority and highly-used. There are DLL and EXE versions of this tool.\n\nThe screenshot functionality of PSLogger likely derives from open source code examples: the code\nstrongly resembles example content available online[xix] for generating multi-monitor image files. This\ncontent is zipped using code resembling the publicly available XZip library or a similar code set.[xx]\n\n**Open-source screenshot code (left) resembling threat group keylogger code (right)**\n\nThe filenames and locations for zipped screenshots and logged keystrokes have typically changed from\nversion to version, but are usually stored in the victim’s AppData\\Local\\Temp directory or a subdirectory\nof this folder. The screenshot filename will typically contain a timestamp (e.g. tmp_userA_0121_142748).\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\n### PowerShell Backdoor\n\nFor a roughly one-year period, the threat group deployed a PowerShell backdoor at victim sites alongside\nseveral of the other tools discussed in this report. A VNCERT report[xxi] was among the first to publicly\ndisclose hashes for this malware, some of which had been uploaded to VirusTotal with other tools from\nan event in Pakistan. The attackers have likely largely phased out this tool following its public disclosure\nand replaced it.\n\nThe samples initially disclosed to the public were likely “incomplete,” as they contained several empty\nfunctions. Based on the decoded function names present within the backdoor, a completed version would\nbe expected to support:\n\n  - File Transfer\n\n  - Screen Grabbing (through Base64-encoded script supplied by the C2)\n\n  - File Compression\n\n  - Command Execution\n\n  - Keylogging\n\n  - Registry Modification\n\n  - Collecting and Sending System Information\n\nThe attackers went through significant efforts to obfuscate the text: nearly every function named has been\nreplaced with an MD5 hash, which significantly slows down analysis. However, the contents of certain\ncommand variables are only Base64-encoded, which facilitates identifying these functions’ intent.\n\n### PowerShell DLL Installer\n\nThe DLL installer was also uploaded alongside several tools in Pakistan in late 2018 and early 2019.[xxii]\nThis script has a configuration that accepts five input variables: a .dll, .dat, and .cfg file alongside a\nservice name and a delete setting. This installer:\n\n1) Moves the input .dll file (e.g. AppChk.dll) from the current working directory to the System32\n\ndirectory and names it using the service name variable (e.g. appchk.dll)\n\n2) Moves the input .cfg file (e.g. AppChk.cfg) from the current working directory to the System32\n\ndirectory and names it using the service name variable and a .mui extension (e.g. appchk.dll.mui)\n\n3) Moves the input .dat file (e.g. AppChk.dat) from the current directory to c:\\programdata\\microsoft\\\n\nusing the service name variable, a generated number, and a .ldx extension (e.g. appchk6.ldx)\n\n4) Creates and starts a service pointing to the DLL file\n\nIf the deletion switch is set to “1” when the script is run, the malware terminates the service, deletes the\nservice, overwrites the bytes in all three written files, and then removes all three files from the disk. This\ndeletion function shares code with at least one other PowerShell tool not listed in this report and shares\nprinciples with a secure delete function included in the “non-FASTCash Injector” tool.\n\n16\n\n\n-----\n\n### Injector (Non-FASTCash)\n\nThe threat group uses at least two types of injectors (in addition to PowerShell loaders that run payloads\nin memory). One of these is specifically for the FASTCash malware and the other injects arbitrary\npayloads into memory. One possibility is that this injector is used specifically for the keylogger payload,\nas one sample was uploaded to VirusTotal directly alongside it; however, this remains speculation.\n\nThe non-FASTCash injector accepts four possible parameters:\n\n  - File path (required, points to payload to be injected)\n\n  - -S (causes the malware to sleep before injection, also causes secure deletion of payload)\n\n  - -D (causes the malware to securely delete the payload)\n\n  - -E (skips the deletion step)\n\nThe injector writes the specified payload into the process memory of explorer.exe and then executes it.\n\n### Injector (FASTCash)\n\nThe FASTCash injector is likely designed specifically to inject the FASTCash payload into the memory of\na payment switch application. The Windows version of this tool expects several command line arguments:\n\n  - The path to the injector (under normal circumstances, automatically included at runtime)\n\n  - An integer value (1 or 2) that specifies the operational mode (inject or eject)\n\n  - A PID that specifies the target process for injection\n\n  - A path to the DLL to be injected into the target process\n\nDepending on the specified operational mode, the malware will either write the specified DLL into the\ntarget process and create a threat or resolve and call the FreeLibrary API to remove it from the process.\n\n17\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe FASTCash technique and malware represents a novel way for its operators to conduct large-scale\ncash-outs against financial institutions, but several complexities inherent in this approach limit the\nfrequency that these attacks can be carried out:\n\n  - Each network will have a slightly different implementation of the ISO 8583 standard\n\n  - Each network will have different security controls on critical applications\n\n  - This attack requires a network of money mules to perform the cash withdrawals\n\nThese three factors are likely significant drivers for the apparent relative rarity of successful cash-outs\nthrough this technique. Still, the technique is a proven one and makes use of the fact that the ATMs\ntargeted are largely operating “as expected” and without being manipulated directly; put more simply, the\nattackers can conduct an ATM cash-out without installing malware on these devices (either remotely or\nvia physical access).\n\nThe threat group’s supplemental toolset is effective, but largely relies on TTPs that are significantly less\ndistinct: the group often uses PowerShell-based tools, scheduled tasks, and malicious services to gain\naccess to and maintain a foothold on target networks. When the attackers combine these techniques with\ntheir intricate knowledge of financial networks, however, the threat created is significantly larger.\n\n## File Hashes Referenced\n\nd13c15016b5ea2a88434d427bb47110d (India)\n\nd45931632ed9e11476325189ccb6b530 (api)\n\nKeylogger\n\n34404a3fb9804977c6ab86cb991fb130 (Pakistan)\n\n3122b0130f5135b6f76fca99609d5cbe (Vietnam)\n\n89081f2e14e9266de8c042629b764926 (Windows)\nInjector (FASTCash)\n\nb3efec620885e6cf5b60f72e66d908a9 (AIX)\n\nb9ad0cc2a2e0f513ce716cdf037da907 (signed)\nInjector (Non-FASTCash)\n\na042e53edd734b6a96ef9ab82bec8193 (unsigned)\n\nd1d779314250fab284fd348888c2f955 (Middle East)\n\nFake Resume Application b484b0dff093f358897486b58266d069 (Chile)\n\n4c26b2d0e5cd3bfe0a3d07c4b85909a4 (Pakistan)\nDLL Installer a827d598b4d13005526839473f38a01b (Pakistan)\n\nb12325a1e6379b213d35def383da2986 (Thailand)\nPowerShell Backdoor\n\n7c651d115109fd8f35fddfc44fd24518 (Pakistan)\n\nc4141ee8e9594511f528862519480d36 (Windows)\n\nFASTCash 46b318bbb72ee68c9d9183d78e79fb5a (AIX Type 1)\n\nd790997dd950bb39229dc5bd3c2047ff (AIX Type 2)\n\n18\n\n|Keylogger|d13c15016b5ea2a88434d427bb47110d (India)|\n|---|---|\n||d45931632ed9e11476325189ccb6b530 (api)|\n||34404a3fb9804977c6ab86cb991fb130 (Pakistan)|\n||3122b0130f5135b6f76fca99609d5cbe (Vietnam)|\n|Injector (FASTCash)|89081f2e14e9266de8c042629b764926 (Windows)|\n||b3efec620885e6cf5b60f72e66d908a9 (AIX)|\n|Injector (Non-FASTCash)|b9ad0cc2a2e0f513ce716cdf037da907 (signed)|\n||a042e53edd734b6a96ef9ab82bec8193 (unsigned)|\n|Fake Resume Application|d1d779314250fab284fd348888c2f955 (Middle East)|\n||b484b0dff093f358897486b58266d069 (Chile)|\n||4c26b2d0e5cd3bfe0a3d07c4b85909a4 (Pakistan)|\n|DLL Installer|a827d598b4d13005526839473f38a01b (Pakistan)|\n|PowerShell Backdoor|b12325a1e6379b213d35def383da2986 (Thailand)|\n||7c651d115109fd8f35fddfc44fd24518 (Pakistan)|\n|FASTCash|c4141ee8e9594511f528862519480d36 (Windows)|\n||46b318bbb72ee68c9d9183d78e79fb5a (AIX Type 1)|\n||d790997dd950bb39229dc5bd3c2047ff (AIX Type 2)|\n\n\n-----\n\ni “HIDDEN COBRA – FASTCash Campaign” United States Department of Homeland Security, 2 October 2018.\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A\nii “ISO8583 financial transaction message format” ADM Factory, https://www.admfactory.com/iso8583-financialtransaction-message-format/\niii “Financial Transaction Message Tools - ISO 8583 (1987) Data Fields” http://www.fintrnmsgtool.com/encodeiso87-bitmap.html\niv “ISO8583 – A layman’s guide to understanding the ISO8583 Financial Transaction Message”\nhttp://www.lytsing.org/downloads/iso8583.pdf\nv “Financial Transaction Message Tools” http://www.fintrnmsgtool.com/decode-iso87-bitmap.html\nvi “ISO 8583–1987 Data Element Definitions”, MasterCard, 2002.
