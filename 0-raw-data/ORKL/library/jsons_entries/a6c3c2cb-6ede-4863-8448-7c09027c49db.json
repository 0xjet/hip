On March 30, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a\n[private industry notification (PIN) warning of the continued targeting of local governments by](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220330.pdf)\nransomware operators, noting that local Government Facilities Sector (GFS) entities were\nthe second-most frequent victims to report ransomware incidents to the FBI in 2021. The\nnotification goes on to highlight four incidents that affected county governments and\nidentifies phishing, remote desktop protocol (RDP) compromise, and exploitation of\nunpatched vulnerabilities as the three most common means by which threat actors initially\naccessed victims’ systems. In [another relevant PIN, the FBI noted in May 2022 that](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220526.pdf)\nmembers of illicit forums regularly sell educational institutions’ credentials. Exposed\ncredentials may in fact be both a cause and effect of some attacks. Not only do ransomware\ngroups often use previously exposed credentials to access victim networks but, as the PIN\nnotes, some attackers also use an intrusion that ultimately results in a ransomware\ndeployment to harvest credentials from victim organizations.\n\nIn [a summary study of 2021 ransomware incidents, Sophos surveyed a group of 499](https://assets.sophos.com/X24WTUEQ/at/g523b3nmgcfk5r5hc5sns6q/sophos-state-of-ransomware-in-education-2021-wp.pdf)\ninformation technology professionals in the education sector. They found that 44% of\nrespondents’ organizations had experienced ransomware attacks that year. Of those attacks,\n58% resulted in the successful encryption of data, and 35% of successful encryptions led to\nransom payments. Moreover, Sophos’ statistics suggest that educational institutions may be\nless capable of detecting attacks than other targets. The percentage of attacks resulting in\n\n\n-----\n\nencryption for targets in education (58%) was 4% higher than the overall average (54%.) In\ncomparison, the percentage of respondents reporting that attacks were stopped before\nencryption was 2% lower in education than overall (37% vs. 39%) and the percentage that\npaid ransoms was 3% higher (35% vs. 32%).\n\n[Sophos also surveyed local government personnel in its study, finding that local](https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/pdfs/whitepaper/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2021-wp.pdf)\ngovernments were the organizations least capable of disrupting attacks prior to encryption:\n69% of respondents from local governments that suffered attacks reported those attacks led\nto the encryption of their organizations’ data. Moreover, local governments were among the\nransomware victims to pay ransoms most frequently: 43% of local government respondents\nreported that their organizations had paid a ransom after an incident.\n\n[Meanwhile, Emsisoft’s retrospective report on 2021 ransomware incidents found that](https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/40813/the-state-of-ransomware-in-the-us-report-and-statistics-2021/)\nransomware attacks had affected 77 state and local governments and 1,043 schools that\nyear, leading to an estimated minimum of 36 data breaches in local government and 118 in\neducation. This may indicate decreased targeting of local government, as 2021’s 77 victim\norganizations is considerably fewer than the 113 recorded in both 2019 and 2020. Emsisoft\nadditionally notes that smaller municipalities also made up a larger proportion of 2021\nvictims, in contrast to previous years, whose ransomware victims included large cities like\nAtlanta and Baltimore.\n\nUnlike local government, according to Emsisoft’s research, the number of victims in the\neducation sector did not decrease as notably in 2021. 2020 saw 84 attacks against 26\ncolleges or universities and 58 school districts (impacting 1,681 individual schools within\nthose districts). In 2021, 88 incidents occurred, and the number of higher-education victims\nremained 26, while the number of school districts increased to 62. However, the number of\nschools affected by attacks against those districts decreased to 1043. This suggests that\nransomware groups are targeting smaller educational organizations more often, just as they\nappear to have begun targeting smaller municipalities.\n\nWhile 2022 is not over yet (and full-year statistics are therefore not yet available), early\nindications are that ransomware attacks against targets in both local government and\n[education will persist, if not increase. In early April, Recorded Future reported that 37](https://therecord.media/north-carolina-at-hit-with-ransomware-after-alphv-attack/)\nschools had suffered ransomware attacks in the first quarter of 2022 alone, compared to 127\nin all of 2021. This included seven confirmed victims in higher education:\n\nNorth Carolina A&T University\n\nOhlone College\n\nSavannah State University\n\nUniversity of Detroit Mercy\n\n\n-----\n\nCentralia College\n\nPhillips Community College of the University of Arkansas\n\nNational University College (NUC University)\n\n[In response to a later attack, another expert reported at the end of April that ransomware had](https://twitter.com/BrettCallow/status/1519449603812200448?s=20&t=6pbrUGdm45ncLFT_p6pvGw)\naffected 12 institutions of higher education up to that point in the year, with 10 of those\n[incidents involving data theft, additionally noting that 9 school districts comprised of 234](https://twitter.com/BrettCallow/status/1519449606509056000?s=20&t=VF1RJY0vOT-qbICFhVPufQ)\nindividual schools had suffered attacks up to that point in 2022. Like the estimates above,\nthese figures would suggest that more attacks on the education sector will occur in 2022\nthan 2021, were they to continue at the same rate. Unlike education, however, attacks\n[against local governments may be decreasing. According to one estimate, as of early June,](https://therecord.media/louisiana-authorities-investigating-ransomware-attack-on-city-of-alexandria/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--eW2kbLDdCBoMvmbO2ieWBLkwFOyDUTV1HmK6rKMmAk_qCJFhuOzujZa19000_8muBuFJr)\n22 local governments had suffered attacks, but by the same point in 2021, 36 local\ngovernment attacks had occurred.\n\n**Particularly Active Groups: ALPHV/BlackCat and LockBit 2.0**\n\nOf the year’s publicly-disclosed ransomware attacks against higher education and local\ngovernment, the [LockBit 2.0 and ALPHV/BlackCat groups have figured particularly](https://www.lifars.com/knowledge-center/a-detailed-analysis-of-the-lockbit-ransomeware/)\nprominently. Of the above reports, ALPHV claimed responsibility for the attacks on North\nCarolina A&T and [Phillips Community College, while LockBit 2.0 claimed the University of](https://twitter.com/BrettCallow/status/1512126198528106506?s=20&t=R-zBzpXs5vPTN9GD3F-J5g)\nDetroit Mercy and [NUC University attacks. ALPHV subsequently claimed additional attacks](https://www.redpacketsecurity.com/lockbit-2-0-ransomware-victim-edukgroup-com/)\non [Florida International University and](https://www.databreaches.net/alphav-claims-attack-on-florida-international-university/) [Regina Public Schools and LockBit 2.0 claimed an](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-ransomware-attack-1.6468848)\n[attack against Mercyhurst University (though shortly after claiming the attack, LockBit](https://www.databreaches.net/pa-ransomware-group-claims-to-have-hit-mercyhurst-university/)\nremoved Mercyhurst’s entry from its leak site). Most recently, on June 3, 2022, the town of\n[Alexandria, Louisiana reported that it had suffered a breach resulting from an attack by](https://therecord.media/louisiana-authorities-investigating-ransomware-attack-on-city-of-alexandria)\nALPHV. Commentators have noted that the group took a particularly aggressive stance\nagainst media coverage in addition to making more predictable threats to leak data directed\nat state officials.\n\nALPHV (also tracked as BlackCat) and LockBit 2.0 are both ransomware-as-a-service\n[(RaaS) operations that reportedly conduct double and, in some cases, triple extortion against](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220204.pdf)\ntheir victims: in addition to demanding a ransom to decrypt encrypted systems, they not only\nthreaten to publish stolen data on their leak sites, but also occasionally launch distributed\ndenial of service (DDoS) attacks against their victims to apply additional pressure by way of\nadditional disruptions to their operations and recovery efforts. Both groups also often employ\nCobalt Strike in the course of their attacks.\n\nAs its name suggests, [LockBit 2.0 is a continuation of the earlier LockBit ransomware](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/lockbit-2-ransomware/)\noperation, which first surfaced in 2019 (LockBit 2.0 appeared in Summer 2021). According to\nan [FBI advisory released in February 2022, LockBit 2.0’s affiliates have accessed target](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220204.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nsystems by a variety of means, including remote access purchased through initial access\nbrokers, exploitation of vulnerabilities both novel and published, and through malicious\ninsiders. [More recent analysis of the group found that LockBit 2.0’s operators have sought](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/lockbit-2-ransomware/)\naffiliates who can help compromise target systems through phishing, remote services\nincluding RDP and VPN, previously exposed credentials, and insider access.\n\nALPHV [first appeared in early December 2021. Early analysis found the BlackCat strain of](https://therecord.media/alphv-blackcat-is-the-first-professional-ransomware-gang-to-use-rust/)\nransomware to be particularly sophisticated and that it was the first professionally-deployed\nransomware to be written in Rust. Later, in April 2022, the FBI [warned that as of March,](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220420.pdf)\nALPHV/BlackCat had already compromised 60 organizations and noted that the operation\nlikely shared personnel with the BlackMatter and DarkSide groups. DarkSide achieved\nconsiderable notoriety for its attack on Colonial Pipeline, which likely led the group to\nrebrand, first as BlackMatter and later as BlackCat. That warning notes that attackers\nnormally exploit previously exposed credentials to access victim systems, subsequently\nescalating privileges and moving laterally while disabling security systems to avoid detection.\nAs with many other ransomware operations, the group steals documents from victim systems\nin order to conduct secondary extortion and uses Cobalt Strike after initially compromising\nvictim systems. [More recent research has found that some BlackCat affiliates have exploited](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/06/13/the-many-lives-of-blackcat-ransomware/)\na Microsoft Exchange vulnerability to initially access unpatched servers–although the\nresearch does not explicitly name the Exchange vulnerability in question, it may be the\nwidespread ProxyLogon vulnerability that was first disclosed in early 2021, given that\nresearchers link to guidance about it in the newer report.\n\n**Ongoing Risks: Third-Party/Supply Chain Breaches**\n\nThird-party risk has been a recurring topic of concern within the cybersecurity community,\nand third-party breaches have proven particularly relevant in discussions of the impact of\nransomware upon government and educational institutions. In addition to direct attacks\nagainst them, ransomware attacks against other businesses have also led to breaches of\ngovernment and educational institutions’ data.\n\n[In July 2020, Blackbaud, a technology provider that caters to nonprofit organizations, notified](https://www.thenonprofittimes.com/npt_articles/breaking-blackbaud-hacked-ransom-paid/)\n[customers (including many K-12 schools, colleges, and universities) that a February](https://www.suspectfile.com/blackbaud-data-breach-university-college-k-12-terza-parte/)\nransomware attack had also exposed their data, but that Blackbaud had paid the ransom,\npartially in hopes of preventing the attackers’ publication of the stolen data.\n\nThe Accellion FTA compromise that became prominent in early 2021 is a particularly wideranging example of the intersection between supply-chain cyber risk and ransomware.\n[Between December 2020 and January 2021, Accellion patched a group of vulnerabilities in](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-8478/Accellion.html)\nits 20-year-old FTA file transfer software. However, by that point, threat actors had already\nexploited them to steal data from Accellion customers and partners and subsequently began\ncontacting those customers and partners to threaten to leak the stolen data and demand a\nransom; [by February 2021, victim data had begun appearing on the Cl0p ransomware](https://threatpost.com/accellion-zero-day-attacks-clop-ransomware-fin11/164150/)\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup s leak site. Analysts estimated at the time that the attacks affected 100 organizations,\n25 of which experienced severe data thefts. Educational institutions, including Stanford\nUniversity, the [University of California system, the](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2021/03/uc-part-of-nationwide-cyber-attack.html) [University of Colorado, the](https://www.cu.edu/accellion-cyberattack) University of\nMiami, the [University of Maryland, Baltimore, and at least](https://www.govtech.com/education/higher-ed/university-of-maryland-student-data-exposed-by-cyber-attack.html) [one state government were among](https://sao.wa.gov/breach2021/)\nthe affected organizations.\n\nThus far, breaches at two different educational technology (edtech) providers, Illuminate\nEducation and Battelle for Kids, have affected public school districts’ data in 2022; at least\none of these (Battelle) was the result of a ransomware attack. Illuminate Education\n[announced in January that service disruptions reported by customers, including the New](https://nypost.com/2022/01/15/nyc-schools-crippled-by-illuminate-educations-data-outage/)\nYork City public school system, were the result of an unspecified security incident. Then, in\n[March, Illuminate informed New York City officials that the incident had also led to a data](https://therecord.media/nyc-officials-call-for-investigation-after-data-of-820000-students-compromised-in-hack/)\nbreach that exposed 820,000 New York City students’ personal data. Some features of this\nincident resemble a ransomware attack, but public sources have not yet formally identified it\n[as one. In a similar event publicly acknowledged as a ransomware incident, in April, a group](https://www.uaschools.org/protected/ArticleView.aspx?iid=52UBG2&dasi=32UY)\nof [Ohioschool districts began announcing breaches resulting from a December 2021 attack](https://local12.com/news/local/lakota-local-schools-district-say-some-student-information-may-have-been-compromised-in-ransomware-attack-battelle-for-kids-elementary-middle-school-identity-theft-cincinnati-local-12-wkrc-tristate-ohio-kentucky-indiana-news)\nagainst edtech provider Battelle for Kids, with the much larger Chicago public school system\n[announcing in May that the Battelle attack had also impacted it, leading to a breach of](https://therecord.media/battelle-for-kids-ransomware-attack-chicago-public-schools-data-exposed/)\n500,000 students’ and 60,000 teachers’ data.\n\nEven in the wake of their respective security incidents, SecurityScorecard’s platform\nindicates that Battelle and Illuminate both suffer from issues attackers (including ransomware\noperators) could exploit. Previous leaks have exposed personal information belonging to\nemployees of both organizations, and other leaks have exposed passwords associated with\nBattelle email addresses. An attacker could use exposed personal information to craft\ncompelling phishing messages, and ransomware attacks have often used employee\ncredentials (like passwords that employees use across different accounts and fail to change\nafter their exposure in a breach) to access target systems. Both could be susceptible to\nphishing attacks: 17 domains attributed to Battelle for Kids lack Sender Policy Framework\n(SPF) records, and the SPF record for one Illuminate Education subsidiary, IO Education,\nindicates a misconfiguration. SPF can help prevent email spoofing, but in its absence, threat\nactors can more easily craft and distribute phishing emails that can be more convincing\nbecause they appear to have originated from within a target organization. SecurityScorecard\nalso observed open FTP services at an IP address attributed to Battelle as recently as June\n17. Speaking generally, attackers may take an interest in file-sharing services because they\noffer a means of accessing victim data, but some ransomware groups have taken a particular\n[interest in it. For example, Sophos warned in February 2021 that it had observed the Conti](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/02/16/what-to-expect-when-youve-been-hit-with-conti-ransomware/)\ngroup using FTP to steal victim data. Software in use on June 20 and 21 at Illuminateattributed IP addresses also appeared to be affected by high-severity vulnerabilities first\nidentified in 2016 and 2018, which could indicate patch management issues that could be\n\n\n-----\n\nespecially concerning given that ransomware often exploits unpatched vulnerabilities. Other\nissues, while not necessarily targeted by ransomware groups, may nonetheless indicate an\nongoing risk.\n\n[SecurityScorecard has previously researched the links between our scorecard factors and](https://securityscorecard.com/blog/organizations-with-diligent-cybersecurity-practices-less-likely-to-fall-victim-to-costly-ransomware-attacks)\nransomware attacks to identify which of the issues we observe are more prevalent among\nransomware victims than in other organizations. Many of the issue types identified in this\nresearch also affect Battelle for Kids and Illuminate Education. Exposed personal information\n(observed for both companies, as discussed above) was almost 40% more prevalent among\nthe ransomware cohort than non-victim organizations. SecurityScorecard observed TLS\nservices that support weak protocols in use in Battelle’s and Illuminate’s networks; this\nfinding is over 30% more prevalent among ransomware victims than non-victims.\nSecurityScorecard’s earlier research also noted that two other TLS flaws, TLS Service\nSupports Weak Cipher Suite, and Certificate Without Revocation Control, are respectively\n30% and 29% more prevalent in the ransomware cohort than in the control group.\nSecurityScorecard has found a TLS Service at a Battelle for Kids-attributed IP address to\nsupport a weak cipher suite and a TLS certificate at an Illuminate Education-linked IP\naddress to lack revocation control. Together, these findings suggest that both Battelle for\nKids and Illuminate Education may share a profile similar to many ransomware victims, even\nif only one of the two companies has publicly disclosed a ransomware incident in recent\nmonths.\n\n**Case Study: Alexandria, Louisiana**\n\nSecurityScorecard’s investigation into the attack against the government of Alexandria,\nLouisiana, by the ALPHV group revealed some possible insights, including a series of\nsuspicious network flows (netflows) in the days before the attack.\n\nOn May 30 and 31, 151 flows between 199.38.59[.]80 (an IP address attributed to the City of\nAlexandria) and 149.255.169[.]10 took place over UDP. These occurred within fairly narrow\ntimeframes: the 25 flows on May 30 occurred between 16:26:25 and 16:28:54 UTC, and the\n126 flows on May 31 all occurred between 11:22:14 and 11:42:12 UTC. SecurityScorecard’s\nnetflow tool has previously linked 149.255.169[.]10 to malicious bot and Cobalt Strike activity.\nASI has, moreover, revealed remote access services in use at open ports at the Alexandria\nIP address in question:\n\n\n-----\n\nASI also found a port indicative of VPN activity open at the other IP address involved in\nthese flows; [Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a VPN protocol that operates on](https://www.expressvpn.com/what-is-vpn/protocols/pptp)\nTCP port 1723, a port that ASI indicates is open at 149.255.169[.]10. While PPTP is widely\n[regarded as outdated, VPNs can also use UDP (the protocol over which the observed](https://vpnoverview.com/vpn-information/vpn-protocols-compared/)\ncommunication occurred) in its stead.\n\nWhile VPNs do not necessarily indicate malicious activity, threat actors use them regularly to\nobfuscate their traffic and communications.\n\nThese 151 flows make up the bulk of the observed traffic involving this particular Alexandriaattributed IP (199.38.59[.]80), which comprised 186 flows in total and may represent a\nparticularly concentrated period within a broader pattern of suspicious activity. The first flow\nwithin SecurityScorecard’s sample took place between 199.38.59[.]80 and 41.93.45[.]129 on\nMay 21. [Other vendors have observed this IP address leading to a download of a malicious](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/41.93.45.129/relations)\njavascript file, and ASI observed a malware infection active there on the same day as this\nflow:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [malicious file in question has, moreover, figured in](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b663321ab439cc53a329ee352c1b855d9998d3af95524a05795a88b42a9acf07/details) [previous SecurityScorecard research,](https://www.virustotal.com/graph/gf0fdb307a4874b0fa7796b0993ea8a4135334469e5914a8ebdd65f2231efc703)\nwhich linked it to possible Russian C2 infrastructure. The number of bytes observed in this\nflow (1500, or 15 KB) is only slightly larger than the javascript file in question (10.66 KB).\n\nThe following day (May 22), the same Alexandria IP address communicated with a\n[neighboring IP address, 41.93.45[.]130. Vendors have linked that address to malicious](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/41.93.45.130/detection)\nactivity and ASI observed malware infections at it only slightly before this flow:\n\n\n-----\n\nThen, on May 23, a 327-KB data transfer from 178.128.55[.]198 took place. Nine vendors\n[have detected malicious activity involving this IP address; it has hosted a domain that](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/178.128.55.198/detection)\nappears to impersonate Apple (icdn-appieid[.]com) and, more recently, was observed leading\n[to a download of a malicious text file detected as Win32.Trojan.Raasj.Auto.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a469ab4ca4e55bf547566e9ebfa1b809c933207e9d558156bc0c4252b17533fe)\n\nThese three flows used TCP, but after them, many others, like the 151 involving\n149.255.169[.]10, used UDP. This sudden shift to UDP may reflect the use of a VPN to\ncommunicate with threat actor infrastructure following an initial compromise represented by\nthese first three suspicious TCP flows.\n\nWhile this traffic may be benign (internal log data could further elucidate it), these findings\nsuggest that the above-discussed IP addresses merit further investigation, as the timing of\nthe traffic involving them suggests that they may have played a role in the attack against the\nAlexandria government.\n\n**Case Study: Somerset County, New Jersey**\n\nOn May 24, the government of Somerset County, New Jersey, [announced it had suffered a](https://www.co.somerset.nj.us/Home/Components/News/News/5000/17)\nransomware attack earlier that day, which disabled the county’s email system and [disrupted](https://www.co.somerset.nj.us/Home/Components/News/News/5008/17)\nSomerset County Clerk and Surrogate services requiring internet connectivity or access to\ncounty databases. Following the disclosure of the incident, SecurityScorecard researchers\nconsulted our internal scan data and netflow tool in hopes of enriching the publicly available\ninformation about the attack. SecurityScorecard observed several vulnerabilities commonly\nleveraged by ransomware groups on Somerset County’s network.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurityScorecard observed that Somerset County s main domain, somerset[.]nj[.]us, lacked\nan SPF (sender policy framework) record as recently as May 23. SPF can help prevent email\nspoofing by verifying that emails claiming to originate from a given domain are coming from a\nserver with a legitimate relationship to that domain, thus reducing the risk of successful\nphishing attacks. A threat actor could, for example, have begun spoofed emails from\nsomerset[.]nj[.]us to phish Somerset County employees at the beginning of the ransomware\nattack against the county. As SecurityScorecard’s recent cases have also revealed, phishing\nremains a common means of initial access for ransomware. With that said, recent years\nhave also seen ransomware groups use a remote desktop protocol to access victim systems\nwith increasing frequency.\n\nSecurityScorecard additionally observed FTP services publicly available at three Somerset\nCounty-attributed IP addresses, 64.206.95[.]16, 64.206.95[.]15, and 64.206.95[.]23. As\ndiscussed above, researchers have observed ransomware groups and other threat actors\nexploiting FTP in the past.\n\nAs seen above, exploitation of known vulnerabilities also remains a common feature of\nransomware attacks, and SecurityScorecard observed a number of CVEs affecting Somerset\nCounty IP addresses. Five of these, in particular, 64.206.95[.]22, 64.206.95[.]27,\n64.206.95[.]24, 64.206.77[.]196, and 64.206.95[.]21 may suffer from one especially\nprominent and relatively recent vulnerability, Spring4Shell, the exploitation of which, some\ncommentators note, could facilitate the deployment of ransomware.\n\nSecurityScorecard’s netflow data revealed a notable amount of traffic that may indicate\nattackers’ use of Cobalt Strike against Somerset County. From April 24 to May 24 (the month\nleading up to the Somerset County government’s detection of the attack), the netflow data\navailable to SecurityScorecard revealed 41,972 flows between the IP addresses attributed to\nSomerset County and IP addresses linked to Cobalt Strike command-and-control\ninfrastructure. Some of this traffic may have been part of the attack reported on May 24.\nAccording to [Cisco research conducted in 2020, 66% of ransomware attacks observed that](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/09/CTIR-quarterly-trends-Q4-2020.html)\nyear used Cobalt Strike. More recently, in February 2022, Cybereason’s Global SOC Team\nanalyzed an attack they attribute to a Conti ransomware affiliate that began with\nspearphishing directed at employees of the victim organization and later deployed Cobalt\nStrike. Given the SPF issue mentioned above, it is not unthinkable that the attack against\nSomerset County followed a similar trajectory.\n\nTo identify the most concerning IP addresses involved in the almost 42,000 flows that could\nreflect the use of Cobalt Strike against Somerset County, SecurityScorecard researchers first\nlimited the results to those involving Somerset County IP addresses where\nSecurityScorecard’s platform observed issues, as these issues could represent\nvulnerabilities that adversary may be more likely to target. They then sorted the results by\n\n\n-----\n\nbyte count in order to identify the Cobalt Strike-tagged IP addresses involved in the largest\ndata transfers. The top 10 IP addresses linked to Cobalt Strike and involved in large data\ntransfers to or from Somerset County are the following (in order of byte count):\n\n1. 165.225.242[.]248\n\n2. 208.87.239[.]180\n\n3. 208.40.200[.]194\n\n4. 192.216.142[.]51\n\n5. 162.142.125[.]211\n\n6. 174.128.243[.]54\n\n7. 154.89.5[.]80\n\n8. 70.39.102[.]189\n\n9. 128.14.133[.]58\n\n10. 174.128.243[.]54\n\nResearchers then identified additional traffic involving other IP addresses located in the\nsame countries as these known malicious IPs when the countries in question are ones with\nwhich a US local government would be unlikely to communicate. This led SecurityScorecard\nto observe large data transfers between vulnerable Somerset assets and IP addresses in\nIndia and Bangladesh in the weeks leading up to the attack. Researchers observed a total of\n2,109 flows between the county government’s assets and Indian IP addresses. Traffic\nbetween Indian IP addresses and those attributed to the Somerset County government is in\nand of itself something of an anomaly: the vast majority of traffic occurred within the US, as\nreflected in the graph below:\n\n\n-----\n\nDespite the low frequency of the traffic, the volume of the data it transferred was quite large:\nflows involving Indian IP addresses had an average byte count of 3,363,767, more than\ndouble the overall average (1,576,056 bytes). Because traffic between Somerset County IPs\nand Indian IPs appears uncommon, the amount of data transferred in that traffic was\nanomalously large. The transfers occurred in the lead-up to a ransomware deployment, and\nthreat actors have been observed abusing Indian infrastructure in previous attacks. Of the IP\naddresses appearing in the attack, 103.240.208[.]197 may represent a particular cause for\nconcern. SecurityScorecard’s netflow tool has associated it with Cobalt Strike, and\nresearchers detected a transfer of 156,000 bytes between it and one vulnerable Somerset\nCounty IP address, 64.206.95[.]4, on May 24, the date Somerset County detected and\ndisclosed the attack against it.\n\nIn contrast to those located in India, the Bangladeshi IP addresses communicating with\nSomerset County assets were both rarer and transferred smaller amounts of data. Between\nApril and May 24, they only appeared in 40 flows and had an average byte count of 506,863.\nHowever, in addition to the links SecurityScorecard’s netflow tool established between some\nof these IPs and malicious bot activity, the heavy concentration of the traffic on certain\nspecific dates appears somewhat suspicious. Of these 40 flows, 18 occurred on May 8 and\ninvolved larger data transfers than the overall average of 506,863; on May 8, the flows’\naverage byte count was 1,113,500. Although the IP involved, 103.92.85[.]202, has not\npreviously been linked to ransomware, it likely merits investigation, if not blocking, because\ntraffic between Somerset County IPs and Bangladeshi IPs appears uncommon. The amount\nof data transferred in that traffic was anomalously large and the transfers occurred in the\nlead-up to a ransomware deployment. Moreover, other members of the cybersecurity\ncommunity have previously linked it to brute force attacks targeting RDP. Ransomware\ngroups often compromise RDP for initial access.\n\nTraffic on another day, May 12, represented the next-largest portion of the flows observed:\n14 occurred on that day. They all involved one Bangladeshi IP, 37.111.205[.]165, which\nanother vendor has linked to Cobalt Strike. Their average byte count (6,957.5 bytes),\nhowever, was considerably smaller than the one observed on May 8.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Findings:**\n\nRecent incident response efforts in which SecurityScorecard was involved do, in general,\nindicate that ransomware groups’ TTPs have remained largely continuous with those\nemployed in 2021, with the exploitation of known vulnerabilities remaining a consistent\nfeature of recent attacks. However, the vulnerabilities exploited have changed as\nresearchers publish new CVEs.\n\nThus far in 2022, Confluence, GitHub, and Apache vulnerabilities have figured particularly\nprominently in SecurityScorecard cases. Since its publication in February, [CVE-2021-44228](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance)\n(an Apache vulnerability also tracked as “Log4Shell” because it affects Apache’s Log4j\nsoftware library) has figured in approximately six incidents to which SecurityScorecard\nresponded. More recently published research may also reflect the exploitation of Confluence\n[vulnerabilities observed by SecurityScorecard. Analysts first reported that they had observed](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cerber-ransomware-targets-confluence-and-gitlab-servers/)\n[the Cerber ransomware group exploiting CVE-2021-26084. This vulnerability permits](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2021-08-25-1077906215.html)\nattackers to execute arbitrary code on affected versions of Atlassian’s Confluence Server\n[and Data Center products in December 2021. Atlassian later advised Confluence users that](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2022-06-02-1130377146.html)\na new remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2022-26134, was under active exploitation\n[on June 2. By June 11, researchers had observed at least two ransomware groups (including](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/confluence-servers-hacked-to-deploy-avoslocker-cerber2021-ransomware/)\nthe aforementioned Cerber) exploiting it. In one particularly glaring incident,\nSecurityScorecard observed 64 open CVEs, including both Log4Shell and a GitHub\nvulnerability on a client’s system.\n\nDespite targeting newer vulnerabilities, systems that remain unpatched long after the\npublication of a CVE will also remain low-hanging fruit for attackers. In one recent\nengagement with a municipal emergency response service, SecurityScorecard determined\nthat a threat actor had originally accessed the target’s network through its VPN, exploiting a\nvulnerability in its firewall, which the victim organization had not updated in over a year. In\nthis particular case, the adversary remained in the victim’s network for months and loaded,\nbut ultimately did not deploy ransomware on its systems. The decision not to encrypt this\norganization’s devices, and particularly the time it took for the threat actors to reach that\ndecision, may reflect a wider trend.\n\nDespite these general continuities with previously established trends, recent cases have also\nrevealed two novel features of ransomware operations in 2022: increasing dwell time and\naggression. In the municipal emergency service incident, SecurityScorecard determined that\nthe attacker spent 90 days in the victim system prior to detection. According to\nSecurityScorecard experts, this reflects a broader trend: threat actors are taking their time\nmore. Threat actors often do not know what data they are stealing during exfiltration, but if\nthey have gone undetected, they increasingly appear to be willing to spend the time to figure\nout what data they can access and what it is worth. In previous cases, SecurityScorecard\nwas able to determine that attackers viewed some data but did not exfiltrate it, likely because\nthey believed that they could not monetize it, a belief likely shaped by time constraints–they\n\n\n-----\n\nwere unwilling or unable to spend the time to study victim data and make an informed\nassessment of its value. However, longer dwell times may suggest that actors hope to make\nmore informed decisions about what data they can monetize.\n\nMore than just seeking to evaluate the data available to them, in the municipal emergency\nresponse case, the adversaries disabled the victim’s anti-virus software to avoid detection.\nThey then spent some of their 90-day dwell time attempting further vertical and lateral\nmovement, perhaps in hopes of breaching more lucrative targets. From the emergency\nservice, for example, attackers tried to access the internal systems of other local government\nbodies, including city hall, and launched DNS poisoning attacks from the infected system.\n\nSecurityScorecard has also observed ransomware groups taking increasingly aggressive\nsteps to pressure their victims to pay ransom. In addition to the secondary and tertiary\nextortion methods mentioned above, attackers have taken more personal steps in recent\nincidents, contacting friends and family members of executives of some affected\norganizations to exert additional pressure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAlthough some statistics suggest that the targeting of educational institutions by ransomware\noperators has decreased in 2022, their targeting of local governments may have increased.\nSecurityScorecard’s findings suggest that a number of issues affecting organizations in these\nsectors could render them particularly vulnerable to ransomware. To reduce their\nvulnerability, organizations should make every effort to keep software up to date; unpatched\nsoftware is easier to exploit. In addition to those appearing on previously-circulated lists of\nCVEs frequently exploited by ransomware, those observed in recent SecurityScorecard\nengagements may merit particular attention. They should also remain on guard against\nphishing: frequent trainings would complement the use of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, which\ncan reduce the risk of email spoofing. While some credential exposures may be unavoidable,\norganizations can also reduce the risks associated with these exposures by advising\nemployees against password reuse, requiring 2FA, and requiring fairly stringent length and\ncomplexity requirements for passwords. While SecurityScorecard gathered and analyzed this\ninformation to provide an overview of some of SecurityScorecard’s threat intelligence and\ninvestigation capabilities as they relate to SLED organizations’ exposure to ransomware, the\ndiscussion above may not serve as an exhaustive enumeration of every possible threat and\nrisk involving ransomware. However, SecurityScorecard can offer more tailored support for\nSLED organizations both before and after ransomware attacks.\n\n**Incident Response Support**\n\nIn the event of a confirmed or suspected ransomware attack, SecurityScorecard can provide\n[managed incident response and digital forensics teams as a professional service to](https://securityscorecard.com/solutions/digital-forensics)\ncustomers driven by a large group of former law enforcement and private sector experts with\n\n\n-----\n\ndecades of experience in the space.
