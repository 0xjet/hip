    "plain_text": "# Canadian Man Behind Popular ‘Orcus RAT’\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/canadian-man-is-author-of-popular-orcus-rat/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/canadian-man-is-author-of-popular-orcus-rat/)**\n\nFar too many otherwise intelligent and talented software developers these days apparently\nthink they can get away with writing, selling and supporting malicious software and then\ncouching their commerce as a purely legitimate enterprise. Here’s the story of how I learned\nthe real-life identity of Canadian man who’s laboring under that same illusion as proprietor of\none of the most popular and affordable tools for hacking into someone else’s computer.\n\n[Earlier this week I heard from Daniel Gallagher, a security professional who occasionally](http://twitter.com/DanielGallagher)\nenjoys analyzing new malicious software samples found in the wild. Gallagher said he and\nmembers of [@malwrhunterteam and](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam) [@MalwareTechBlog recently got into a Twitter fight with](https://twitter.com/malwaretechblog)\nthe author of Orcus RAT, a tool they say was explicitly designed to help users remotely\ncompromise and control computers that don’t belong to them.\n\nA still frame from a Youtube video demonstrating Orcus RAT’s keylogging ability to steal passwords\n\nfrom Facebook and other sites.\n\n[The author of Orcus — a person going by the nickname “Ciriis Mcgraw” a.k.a. “Armada” on](https://twitter.com/ciriis)\nTwitter and other social networks — claimed that his RAT was in fact a benign “remote\nadministration tool” designed for use by network administrators and not a “remote access\nTrojan” as critics charged. Gallagher and others took issue with that claim, pointing out that\nthey were increasingly encountering computers that had been infected with Orcus\nunbeknownst to the legitimate owners of those machines.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware researchers noted another reason that Mcgraw couldn t so easily distance\nhimself from how his clients used the software: He and his team are providing ongoing\ntechnical support and help to customers who have purchased Orcus and are having trouble\nfiguring out how to infect new machines or hide their activities online.\n\nWhat’s more, the range of features and plugins supported by Armada, they argued, go well\nbeyond what a system administrator would look for in a legitimate remote administration\n[client like Teamviewer, including the ability to launch a keylogger that records the victim’s](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/)\nevery computer keystroke, as well as a feature that lets the user peek through a victim’s Web\ncam and disable the light on the camera that alerts users when the camera is switched on.\n\nA new feature of Orcus [announced July 7 lets users configure the RAT so that it evades](https://twitter.com/Ciriis/status/751207981048561665)\ndigital forensics tools used by malware researchers, including an anti-debugger and an\noption that prevents the RAT from running inside of a virtual machine.\n\nOther plugins offered directly from Orcus’s [tech support page (PDF) and authored by the](http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Future-Plugins-Suggestions.pdf)\nRAT’s support team include a “survey bot” designed to “make all of your clients do surveys\nfor cash;” a “USB/.zip/.doc spreader,” intended to help users “spread a file of your choice to\nall clients via USB/.zip/.doc macros;” a “Virustotal.com checker” made to “check a file of\nyour choice to see if it had been scanned on VirusTotal;” and an “Adsense Injector,” which\nwill “hijack ads on pages and replace them with your Adsense ads and disable adblocker\non Chrome.”\n\n**WHO IS ARMADA?**\n\nGallagher said he was so struck by the guy’s “smugness” and sheer chutzpah that he\ndecided to look closer at any clues that Ciriis Mcgraw might have left behind as to his realworld identity and location. Sure enough, he found that Ciriis Mcgraw also has a Youtube\n[account under the same name, and that a video Mcgraw posted in July 2013 pointed to a 33-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJRNsj5GQWQ)\nyear-old security guard from Toronto, Canada.\n\nGallagher noticed that the video — a bystander recording on the scene of a police shooting\nof a Toronto man — included a link to the domain policereview[dot]info. A search of the\nregistration records attached to that Web site name show that the domain was registered to\na **[John Revesz in Toronto and to the email address john.revesz@gmail.com.](https://www.facebook.com/revesz)**\n\nA reverse WHOIS lookup ordered from Domaintools.com shows the same\njohn.revesz@gmail.com address was used to register at least 20 other domains, including\n“thereveszfamily.com,” “johnrevesz.com, revesztechnologies[dot]com,” and — perhaps most\ntellingly — “lordarmada.info“.\n\n[Johnrevesz[dot]com is no longer online, but this cached copy of the site from the](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.johnrevesz.com/*)\n[indispensable archive.org includes his personal résumé, which states that John Revesz is a](http://web.archive.org/web/20100316120333/http://www.johnrevesz.com/?page_id=8)\nnetwork security administrator whose most recent job in that capacity was as an IT systems\nadministrator for TD Bank. [Revesz’s LinkedIn profile indicates that for the past year at least](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-revesz-b3437b2?authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=JxFD&locale=en_US&srchid=24600671469033281031&srchindex=3&srchtotal=4&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A24600671469033281031%2CVSRPtargetId%3A6884248%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH)\n\n\n-----\n\nhe has served as a security guard for GardaWorld\n**International Protective Services, a private security**\nfirm based in Montreal.\n\nRevesz’s CV also says he’s the owner of the\naforementioned Revesz Technologies, but it’s unclear\nwhether that business actually exists; the\ncompany’s Web site currently redirects visitors to a\nseries of sites promoting spammy and scammy\nsurveys, come-ons and giveaways.\n\n**IT’S IN THE EULA, STUPID!**\n\nContacted by KrebsOnSecurity, Revesz seemed surprised that I’d connected the dots, but\nbeyond that did not try to disavow ownership of the Orcus RAT.\n\n“Profit was never the intentional goal, however with the years of professional IT networking\nexperience I have myself, knew that proper correct development and structure to the\nenvironment is no free venture either,” Revesz wrote in reply to questions about his software.\n“Utilizing my 15+ years of IT experience I have helped manage Orcus through its\ndevelopment.”\n\nRevesz continued:\n\n“As for your legalities question. Orcus Remote Administrator in no ways violates Canadian\nlaws for software development or sale. We neither endorse, allow or authorize any form of\nmisuse of our software. Our EULA [end user license agreement] and TOS [terms of service]\nis very clear in this matter. Further we openly and candidly work with those prudent to\nmalware removal to remove Orcus from unwanted use, and lock out offending users which\nmay misuse our software, just as any other company would.”\n\nRevesz said none of the aforementioned plugins were supported by Orcus, and were all\ndeveloped by third-party developers, and that “Orcus will never allow implementation of such\nfeatures, and or plugins would be outright blocked on our part.”\n\nIn an apparent contradiction to that claim, plugins that allow Orcus users to disable the\nWebcam light on a computer running the software and one that enables the RAT to be used\nas a “stresser” to knock sites and individuals users offline are available directly from Orcus\nTechnologies’ Github page.\n\n\n-----\n\nRevesz s also offers a service to help people cover their tracks online. Using his alter ego\n“Armada” on the hacker forum Hackforums[dot]net, Revesz also sells a “bulletproof\ndynamic DNS service” that promises not to keep records of customer activity.\n\nDynamic DNS services allow users to have Web sites hosted on servers that frequently\nchange their Internet addresses. This type of service is useful for people who want to host a\nWeb site on a home-based Internet address that may change from time to time, because\ndynamic DNS services can be used to easily map the domain name to the user’s new\nInternet address whenever it happens to change.\n\nUnfortunately, these dynamic DNS providers are extremely popular in the attacker\ncommunity, because they allow bad guys to keep their malware and scam sites up even\nwhen researchers manage to track the attacking IP address and convince the ISP\nresponsible for that address to disconnect the malefactor. In such cases, dynamic DNS\nallows the owner of the attacking domain to simply re-route the attack site to another Internet\naddress that he controls.\n\nFree dynamic DNS providers tend to report or block suspicious or outright malicious activity\non their networks, and may well share evidence about the activity with law enforcement\ninvestigators. In contrast, Armada’s dynamic DNS service is managed solely by him, and he\npromises in his ad on Hackforums that the service — to which he sells subscriptions of\nvarious tiers for between $30-$150 per year — will not log customer usage or report anything\nto law enforcement.\n\n[According to writeups by Kaspersky Lab and](https://securelist.com/blog/research/73660/adwind-faq/) [Heimdal Security, Revesz’s dynamic DNS](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/security-alert-adwind-rat-targeted-attacks-zero-av-detection/)\nservice has been seen used in connection with malicious botnet activity by another RAT\nknown as Adwind. Indeed, Revesz’s service appears to involve the domain\n\n\n-----\n\nnullroute[dot]pw, which is one of 21 domains registered to a Ciriis Mcgraw, (as well as\norcus[dot]pw and orcusrat[dot]pw).\n\nI asked Gallagher (the researcher who originally tipped me off about Revesz’s activities)\nwhether he was persuaded at all by Revesz’s arguments that Orcus was just a tool and that\nRevesz wasn’t responsible for how it was used.\n\nGallagher said he and his malware researcher friends had private conversations with Revesz\nin which he seemed to acknowledge that some aspects of the RAT went too far, and\npromised to release software updates to remove certain objectionable functionalities. But\nGallagher said those promises felt more like the actions of someone trying to cover himself.\n\n“I constantly try to question my assumptions and make sure I’m playing devil’s advocate and\nnot jumping the gun,” Gallagher said. “But I think he’s well aware that what he’s doing is\nhurting people, it’s just now he knows he’s under the microscope and trying to do and say\nenough to cover himself if it ever comes down to him being questioned by law enforcement.”\n\n\n-----",
