Once launched, the ransomware asks for admin privileges, runs a few checks\nand then encrypts files on the computer and then demands 10 DASH coins, currently\nvalued at $700.\n\n## Modular architecture\n\nMalware researchers from McAfee discovered Anatova in a private peer-to-peer network\nwhere it uses an icon for a game or an application to lure users into downloading it.\n\nThey found that the new ransomware comes with support for additional modules that could\nextend its capabilities, allowing it to become an all-in-one malware tool.\n\nThe clue pointing to this possibility was a flag whose value determined the loading of two\nDLL files named 'extra1.dll' and 'extra2.dll.' \"This might indicate that Anatova is prepared to\nbe modular or to be extended with more functions in the near future,\" the researchers say in\na [report.](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/happy-new-year-2019-anatova-is-here/)\n\n\n-----\n\nBy making Anatova modular, its authors could use it to include all sorts of capabilities that\nwould take priority before running the file encryption routine. They could collect sensitive\ninformation, plant a backdoor, or other types of nasties.\n\n## Anti-analysis process\n\nAnatova tried to make the ransomware more resilient to analysis attempts by embedding a\nmemory cleaning procedure that activates in certain situations.\n\nAmong the first actions it takes is to check the username of the logged in user. If the name\nis a match with one on an internal list, the ransomware deploys the cleaning process and\nexits.\n\nAlthough the list of names Anatova checks is short, it may protect it from being checked by\nless careful malware analysts.\n\nIt includes the following strings: 'LaVirulera,' 'tester,' 'Tester,' 'analyst,' 'Analyst,' 'lab,' 'Lab,'\n'Malware,' and 'malware.'\n\nAccording to McAfee, these names are the default choices when setting up a virtual\nmachine or a sandbox environment or they are regularly used by some malware analysts.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional protection techniques are encrypting most of the strings and using different keys\nfor decrypting them and heavy reliance on dynamic calls.\n\nAnatova seems to be a new player on the ransomware market, as the analyzed sample\ncame with a compilation date of January 1, 2019.\n\nThe ransomware packs quite a punch for a package of just 32KB, excluding resources. It\nencrypts files using the Salsa20 algorithm and extends this process to available networkshares.\n\nTo eliminate file recovery possibilities from the infected machine, Anatova destroys the\nVolume Shadow copies ten times in a row. For this, it uses the 'vssadmin' utility, which\nneeds admin rights.\n\n## Encrypted files get no special extension\n\nTo make the encryption process quick, Anatova targets files that are 1MB in size or smaller.\nThis procedure avoids critical directories and files and does not result in files with a different\nextension.\n\n\"By setting pointers at the end of the encrypted files, Anatova makes sure that it does not\nencrypt files that are already encrypted,\" explain the researchers.\n\nUnlike other ransomware pieces, this one adds the ransom note only to folders where it\nencrypted at least one file. Also, it will not overwrite an existing note, most likely to save\ntime.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne peculiarity Lawrence Abrams of BleepingComputer observed while testing the\nransomware multiple times was that it crashed Windows File Explorer.\n\nAnatova could prove to be a next step in the evolution of the ransomware threat by\nincorporating functions that take advantage of the full spectrum of monetization possibilities.\nThis way, even if the victim does not pay the ransom, the criminals will still be able to make\nsome money by stealing private and sensitive information, or selling access to the\ncompromised station.\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
