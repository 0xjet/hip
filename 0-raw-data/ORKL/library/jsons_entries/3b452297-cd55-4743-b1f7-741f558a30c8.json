    "plain_text": "# Orion Threat Alert: Flight of the BumbleBee\n\n**cynet.com/orion-threat-alert-flight-of-the-bumblebee/**\n\n**By: Max Malyutin – Orion Threat Research Team Leader**\n\n\nApril 14, 2022\n\n\nOrion, Cynet’s Threat Research and Intelligence team, spotted a new malware campaign in\nthe wild: BumbleBee.\n\nWondering what’s going on? Let us fill you in.\n\nWe noticed a new trend in Initial Access Brokers’ (IAB) tactics to gain access to their victims’\nmachines. Initial Access Brokers refers to a cybercrime group that specializes in gaining\ninitial access to organizations for the sole purpose of offering it to other threat actor groups.\nThe trend started earlier this year and our team recently spotted their new BumbleBee\ncampaign.\n\nUsually, we observe malicious spam (MalSpam) campaigns that deliver malicious documents\n(MalDoc) to lure the victims to interact with the MalDoc and execute the malicious macro\ncode by clicking “Enable Content.” That in turn downloads and executes the malicious\n[payload, for example, the notorious Emotet campaigns.](https://www.cynet.com/attack-techniques-hands-on/new-wave-of-emotet-when-project-x-turns-into-y/)\n\nWe expected these groups to change the initial access methods. We believe there is a direct\nrelation to the changes Microsoft applied recently to the default policy in their Office\n[products: “Macros from the internet will be blocked by default in Office” and “Excel 4.0 (XLM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked#:~:text=This%20policy%20prevents%20users%20from%20being%20lured%20into%20enabling%20malicious,present%20and%20have%20been%20disabled.)\n\n\n-----\n\n[macros are disabled by default. These changes impact IABs because they have been](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-disables-excel-40-macros-by-default-to-block-malware/)\nabusing Office documents with malicious macros for years.\n\nIt appears that they’ve come up with a plan B.\n\nIn this post, we will cover what this campaign is, and how the IAB distributes the BumbleBee\nmalware and its TTPs. We will also explain each TTP according to the MITRE ATT&CK\nmodel, and its purpose.\n\n## A new campaign in the wild: BumbleBee\n\nFrom our initial analysis, BumbleBee is a custom new loader that is used by different IAB\n[groups. This malware was observed injecting Cobalt Strike shellcodes in memory and using](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/)\nseveral tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in order to compromise the victim’s\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of the campaign, the threat actors abuse spoofed companies’ identities (like fake\nemployee email addresses, fake websites, etc.) and use legitimate public storage services to\ndeliver the malicious ISO image file. The ISO image file is responsible for luring the victim to\nexecute the BumbleBee malware.\n\n[We’ve seen Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBins) execution with rundll32, which allows](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)\n[threat actors to avoid defenses. BumbleBee also creates a scheduled task on the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/)\n[compromised host for persistence and executes a Visual Basic script via the scheduled task.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005/)\n[The IAB relies on the user (victim) execution to execute the BumbleBee payload by luring the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/)\nvictim to mount an ISO image file and click on a Windows shortcut (LNK) file.\n\nThe malware name, BumbleBee, was chosen because of its unique user agent,\n“bumblebee,” that was used as part of the communication with the command and control\nserver (C2).\n\nThreat Analysis Group (TAG) shared observations on the financially motivated threat actor,\n[EXOTIC LILY, that use the BumbleBee malware. In addition, TAG mentioned an interesting](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/exposing-initial-access-broker-ties-conti/)\n[point of collaboration between EXOTIC LILY and the WIZARD SPIDER threat group.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0102/)\n\n## Orion’s observations\n\nThis type of attack is new, and the cybersecurity community is still gathering data to glean\nmore insights on the nature of this attack and its targets.\n\nOrion found a high number of targeted companies based in the US with the following\ndistribution method that delivers the BumbleBee malware: Spear phishing email > URL Link\n(TransferXL, TransferNow, WeTransfer) > Zipped ISO > ISO (contains the LNK file and the\nBumbleBee payload).\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can see the execution flow in the image below.\n\n_The infection flow_\n\nWe’ve handled several incident response (IR) cases where threat actors distributed\nBumbleBee malware. After the initial infection, the threat actors inject Cobalt Strike shellcode\nin memory and execute discovery commands to collect info about the victim’s network. We\nbelieve that threat actors performed this data collection in order to execute the next stage of\nthe infection.\n\nThe next stage is probably related to ransomware operations. We’re still investigating IR\ncases in order to find conclusive evidence that the next stage delivers ransomware.\n\nOn April 12, 2022, the BumbleBee IAB group was spotted using IMG file format in addition to\nISO file format.\n\nYou can see an example in the image below.\n\n_The IMG file, which contains LNK and DLL_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Orion s technical analysis\n\n### Initial Access\n\nThe BumbleBee payload was delivered via a spear phishing email that was sent from a\nspoofed email address. The email contains a URL link to the legitimate public storage\nservice, TransferXL.\n\n_Spear phishing email with a link to TransferXL_\nBelow you’ll see the legitimate public storage site, which leads the victim to the link to the\nmalicious file.\n\n_TransferXL legitimate public storage services_\n\nOnce they click download, the victim receives a ZIP folder that contains the malicious ISO\nimage files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Spoofed company email address_\n\n### Execution\n\nBelow is an example of what the ZIP file from the TransferXL link looks like.\n\n_ZIP file download from TransferXL_\n\nThe ZIP file contains an ISO image file with the following name “documents-04-106.iso.”\nNote that the following ISO image file name pattern was used for all the files that we have\nanalyzed:\n\n_documents-[0-9]{1,4}-[0-9]{1,4}\\.iso_\n\n\n-----\n\n_ISO image file_\n\nFrom this step, threat actors rely on the victim (user) interaction with the ISO image file. The\nthreat actors use a masquerading technique by setting the LNK file icon to be a folder icon in\norder to lure the victim to click on the LNK file:\n\n_ISO image file contains LNK and DLL_\n\nIn addition, the DLL payload attribute is set as “Hidden” in order to hide the DLL payload\nfrom the user when interacting with the ISO image file:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hidden attribute for the DLL_\n\nThe masqueraded LNK file properties show that the execution target is as follows:\n\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe settings.dll,IternalJob_\n\n\n-----\n\n_LNK executes the DLL via rundll32 command_\n\nAfter the initial execution, the BumbleBee DLL is copied to the %programdata%/{RandomDir}\ndirectory. In addition to the DLL, a VBS script is also dropped to the same directory:\n\n[a-z]:\\\\programdata\\\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\.[vbs|dll]\n\n_TTPs indicators during the execution_\n\nWe have other artifacts from different IR cases, where we have observed the following\nactivity. The screenshot below shows an event that detected a creation of a payload in the\n%ProgramData%\\{Random} directory the DLL payload is a copy of the initial BumbleBee\n\n\n-----\n\nloader that executed by Rundll32 from the ISO image file:\n\n_Copy of the BumbleBee DLL to %Programdata% directory_\nIn other IR cases, we observed an execution flow that’s bit different. For example, a LNK that\npoints to the following execution targets:\n\ncmd.exe /c start rundll32 neqw.dll,IternalJob\nrundll32.exe advpack.dll,RegisterOCX sysctl.exe\n\n### Persistence\n\nWe detected a scheduled task execution during the BumbleBee infection:\n\n**Grandparent process:**\nsvchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule\n\n**Parent process:**\n\nwscript.exe [a-z]:\\\\programdata\\\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\.vbs\n\n**Child process:**\n\nrundll32.exe [a-z]:\\\\programdata\\\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\.dll,{Export}\n\n_Strings from the BumbleBee loader show the VBS script and the execution method_\n\nWe also observed WMI execution. The VBS file that was executed via a scheduled task, was\nalso executed through WMI:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Grandparent process:**\nsvchost.exe -k DcomLaunch\n\n**Parent process:**\n\nwmiprvse.exe -Embedding\n\n**Child process:**\n\nwscript.exe [a-z]:\\\\programdata\\\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\\\[a-z0-9]{16}\\.vbs\n\n_Strings from the Bumblebee loader show the WMI Win32_Process execution_\n\n### Defense Evasion\n\nIn our labs, we observed that BumbleBee uses several anti-VM methods to avoid detection.\n\nOne of the anti-VM checks is related to the VirtualBox product:\n\n_Check for lpWindowName if matches VirtualBox_\n\nOther anti-VM artifacts were found after unpacking, as can be seen in the following strings:\n\n\n-----\n\n_List of strings that are related to VMware and VirtualBox_\n\nBumbleBee also detects if it is running within a VM by checking for known services that are\nrelated to different VM products:\n\n\n-----\n\n_List of services that are related to VM products_\n\nBumbleBee checks whether certain user names reside in the victim’s machine by comparing\nagainst a hardcoded list of user names. This allows BumbleBee to detect sandboxes and\nlabs that are used for malware analysis:\n\n_List of hardcoded usernames which are related to sandboxes and labs_\n\nIn addition, it uses WMI queries to collect system details and information:\n\nSELECT * FROM Win32_BaseBoard\nSELECT * FROM Win32_Bus\n\n\n-----\n\nSELECT FROM Win32_ComputerSystem\nSELECT * FROM Win32_Fan\nSELECT * FROM Win32_NTEventlogFile\nSELECT * FROM Win32_OperatingSystem\nSELECT * FROM Win32_PnPDevice\nSELECT * FROM Win32_PnPEntity\n\n### Discovery\n\nWe found that the threat actors used the AdFind tool to enumerate and map the victim’s\nnetwork. The ADFind tool was found in the %ProgramData% directory.\n\nIn the instance we observed, the following commands were used:\n\nadfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp\nadfind.exe -f “(objectcategory=group)”\nadfind.exe -f “(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)”\nadfind.exe -f “objectcategory=computer”\nadfind.exe -f “(objectcategory=person)”\n\n### Command and Control\n\nAfter the initial execution, the BumbleBee process (Rundll32) communicated with the\nCommand-and-Control server (C2). We’ve seen several C2 servers from different IR cases:\n\n_IP: 23.82.19[.]208:443_\n_IP: 192.236.198[.]63:433_\n_IP: 45.147.229[.]177:433_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example of the unique User-Agent: BumbleBee in the payload’s memory_\n\n_Additional reference to the BumbleBee malware name_\n\nAll the collected system and network information is sent to the C2 server, which sends back\na response containing the next step/command to execute based on that info.\n\n## BumbleBee binary analysis\n\nIn this section, we will cover some interesting indicators and artifacts that highlighted the\nBumbleBee actions and heuristics. These artifacts also help us to identify the BumbleBee\nmalware.\n\nWe analyzed several payloads and all of them had the same artifacts.\n\nAfter unpacking the BumbleBee loader and by searching in the metadata of the unpacked\npayload, we identified BumbleBee’s internal name, “LdrAddx64.dll,” and two export functions\n– “IternalJob” and “SetPath.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_BumbleBee internal name, export functions, and TimeDateStamp_\n\nIn the image below, we found the BumbleBee internal name and export function inside the\nprocess Rundll32.exe that executed the BumbleBee DLL loader:\n\n_Bumblebee’s internal name and the export functions names in the memory_\nBy inspecting the unpacked BumbleBee sections, we discovered that the .data section\ncontains two executables:\n\n\n-----\n\n_PEStudio shows the unpacked Bumblebee section and highlighted the .data section_\n\nWe extracted the two hidden payloads from the .data section by using Hex-Editor tool:\n\n_Hex-Editor shows 3 MZ headers: the first one is the Bumblebee, and the other two are_\n_additional payloads_\n\nThe first payload from the .data section is a 32-bit DLL payload:\n\n\n-----\n\n_PEStudio showing the payload’s metadata_\n\nWe found a few interesting functions in the payload strings indicating that this payload has\nprocess injection capabilities. For example, “CreateProcess,” “NtWriteVirtualMemory,”\n“CreateRemoteThread,”and “WinExec.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_PEStudio showing the payload’s strings that could be related to process injection_\n\nThe second payload that we extracted from the .data section is a 64-bit DLL payload:\n\n\n-----\n\n_PEStudio showing the payload’s metadata_\n\nWe analyzed the payload binary and noticed that this payload is responsible for\ncommunicating with BumbleBee’s C2 server:\n\n_In the strings we can see the C2 server’s IP address and port_\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth DLL payloads have the same internal name RapportGP.dll. An interesting point\nregarding the payloads internal name is that there is a legitimate DLL named “RapportGP.dll”\nthat is part of a “Trusteer Ltd” product from a computer security division of IBM.\n\n_Payloads internal name and TimeDateStamp_\n\n## Final notes\n\nBumbleBee threat actors are not the first to change the initial access method from malicious\noffice documents to malicious ISO image files. The ISO image file abuse was also seen a\nfew years ago, but in recent months, we have observed an increase in “ISO campaigns.”\n\nDifferent threat actors abuse ISO image files to deliver their payloads. For example,\nBazarISO deploys Bazarloader, and IcedID started to use ISO image files instead of\nMalDocs like in the two examples below.\n\n_Documents-17.iso (Bazarloader)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Invoice_pdf_1.iso (IcedID)_\n\nIn most of the cases, we’ve seen that during different IR cases, the campaigns escalated to\nfull-blown ransomware attacks. We believe that IAB groups work and collaborate with\nransomware affiliates like CONTI, LockBit, AvosLocker, and more. For example, we\n[observed an IcedID infection that leads to CONTI ransomware attack (Shelob Moonlight)..](https://www.cynet.com/attack-techniques-hands-on/shelob-moonlight-spinning-a-larger-web/)\n\nThe Orion team is constantly monitoring BumbleBee and the IAB group’s activities closely\nand analyzing them to better understand their motivation. As we learn more, we will publish\nour findings and artifacts to share additional insights for BumbleBee infection to ransomware\npost-attack chain.\n\nWe’re expecting to see more malware campaigns that will use the ISO delivery method in the\nnear future. So, stay vigilant.\n\nAs a final note, we’d like to share these indicators of compromise with you.\n\n### Indicators of compromise:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nBumbleBee payload\n88F5AE9691E6BCDD4065A420EAFAF3E3AA32C69605BF564A42FFD8ECD25C9920\n4a49e2f06ba48d3a88fdeb83fb8021f3d165535e8ea5319b16a7ebe4da9c0751\n08cd6983f183ef65eabd073c01f137a913282504e2502ac34a1be3e599ac386b\n186145f84ed6a473ec6bc4afa66bff156057888938793b12afd17659041ddbba\n4063fab9176db3960fa6014173b6c7ba52f19424887f5a6205ff73aa447ada61\n53b3ebaa3c485772f8e6abaa0f366ef192137496a7064e015ced4e6fc204b3c8\nd74a3f9b35d657516eb53d4e70582f93d22077d3e0936758cc4ef76d5171075d\n8f47c3962a7c418bae71fec42bbca9524b72f8f0fd2dd81d1175138f7d20b2f7\nc97b8bffcbe424cbc2a6e1135068d071c6f4e8f020fccd2db3dbee3aa80102ac\nBumbleBee C2 server\nIP: 23.82.19[.]208 Port 443\nIP: 192.236.198[.]63 Port 433\nIP: 45.147.229[.]177 Port 433\nCobalt Strike C2 server\nhojimizeg[.]com - 45.147.228[.]197\nnotixow[.]com - 23.19.58[.]154\nrewujisaf[.]com - 142.234.157[.]176\n\n```\nWe hope this was helpful.
