The\nmalware downloader comes packed with sophisticated reconnaissance capabilities and has\nbeen distributing the notorious Ramnit banking trojan.\n\nThe malware duo is being leveraged by a threat group called TA554, who has been targeting\nfinancial institutions across Italy, Canada and the UK. TA554 has been active since 2017.\nHowever, its latest campaign began in May 2018.\n\n### sLoad capabilities\n\nsLoad is capable of conducting reconnaissance operations such as gathering system\ninformation like a list of running processes, the presence of Outlook, and the presence of\nCitrix-related files. sLoad is also capable of checking the DNS cache for a particular domain,\nsuch as that of a targeted bank. What is more, the malware downloader can also take\nscreenshots and load external binaries\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the initial beacon, sLoad enters a loop in which it pushes extensive information about\nthe victim’s system to the C&C, expects and executes commands from the server, and sends\nscreenshots to the server. In this loop, it first performs a request to “captcha.php” and sends\ninformation about the infected system via the URL parameters,” security researchers at\n[Proofpoint, who discovered the new campaign, wrote in a blog.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/sload-and-ramnit-pairing-sustained-campaigns-against-uk-and-italy)\n\n### Modus operandi\n\nTA554’s campaign involves sending victims cleverly crafted emails, which contain language\nthat is native to the targeted country. The phishing emails also often mention the target’s\nname and address in various parts of the email, such as the email subject and body. The\nthreat group generally uses package delivery or order notification as lures.\n\nThe phishing emails contain malicious URLs that link to zipped LNK files, which, in turn,\ndownload the final payloads, which could either be a PowerShell script or another malware\ndownloader.\n\n“Geofencing -- restricting access to content based on the user’s location, determined via the\nsource IP address -- is performed at all steps of the infection chain,” Proofpoint researchers\nsaid.\n\nApart from Ramnit, sLoad has so far also been used to distribute other malware variants\nsuch as Gootkit, Ursnif, DarkVNC, PsiXBot, and more. The researchers said that since May,\nthey have observed multiple new versions of sLoad, all of which contained some minor\nmodifications.\n\n“sLoad, like other downloaders we have profiled recently, fingerprints infected systems,\nallowing threat actors to better choose targets of interest for the payloads of their choice. In\nthis case, that final payload is generally a banking Trojan via which the actors can not only\nsteal additional data but perform man-in-the-browser attacks on infected individuals,”\nProofpoint researchers added. “Downloaders, though, like sLoad, Marap, and others, provide\nhigh degrees of flexibility to threat actors, whether avoiding vendor sandboxes, delivering\nransomware to a system that appears mission critical, or delivering a banking Trojan to\nsystems with the most likely return.”\n\nSLoad Reconnaissance Malware Ramnit Trojan Ursnif Banking Malware\n\n\nMalware Downloader\n\n\n-----\n\nPublisher\n\n## Cyware\n\n\n-----",
