Spanish for “Butterfly,”\nMariposa was a potent crime machine first spotted in 2008. Very soon after its inception,\n\n\n-----\n\n[Mariposa was estimated to have infected more than 1 million hacked computers — making it](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/03/mariposa-botnet-authors-may-avoid-jail-time/)\none of the largest botnets ever created.\n\nAn advertisement for the ButterFly Bot.\n\nŠkorjanc and his hacker handle Iserdo were initially named in a Justice Department\nindictment from 2011 (PDF) along with two other men who allegedly wrote and sold the\nMariposa botnet code. But in June 2019, the DOJ unsealed an updated\nindictment (PDF) naming Škorjanc, the original two other defendants, and a fourth man (from\nthe United States) in a conspiracy to make and market Mariposa and to run the Darkode\ncrime forum.\n\nMore recently, Škorjanc served as chief technology officer at NiceHash, a Slovenian\ncompany that lets users sell their computing power to help others mine virtual currencies like\nbitcoin. In December 2017, approximately USD $52 million worth of bitcoin mysteriously\n[disappeared from the coffers of NiceHash. Slovenian police are reportedly still investigating](https://news.bitcoin.com/nicehash-returns-60-of-coins-stolen-in-the-hack/)\nthat incident.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe “sellers” page on the Darkode cybercrime forum, circa 2013.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what happens with the fourth and sole U.S.-based defendant\nadded in the latest DOJ charges — Thomas K. McCormick, a.k.a “fubar” — allegedly one\nof the last administrators of Darkode. Prosecutors say McCormick also was a reseller of the\n[Mariposa botnet, the ZeuS banking trojan, and a bot malware he allegedly helped create](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=zeus&x=0&y=0)\ncalled “Ngrbot.”\n\nBetween 2010 and 2013, Fubar would randomly chat me up on instant messenger apropos\nof nothing to trade information about the latest goings-on in the malware and cybercrime\nforum scene.\n\nFubar frequently knew before anyone else about upcoming improvements to or new features\nof ZeuS, and discussed at length his interactions with Iserdo/Škorjanc. Every so often, I\nwould reach out to Fubar to see if he could convince one of his forum members to call off an\n\n\n-----\n\nattack against KrebsOnSecurity.com, an activity that had become something of a rite of\npassage for new Darkode members.\n\nOn Dec. 5, 2013, federal investigators visited McCormick at his University of Massachusetts\ndorm room. According to a memo filed by FBI agents investigating the case, in that interview\nMcCormick acknowledged using the “fubar” identity on Darkode, but said he’d quit the whole\nforum scene years ago, and that he’d even interned at Microsoft for several summers and at\n_Cisco for one summer._\n\nA subsequent search warrant executed on his dorm room revealed multiple removable drives\nthat held tens of thousands of stolen credit card records. For whatever reason, however,\nMcCormick wasn’t arrested or charged until December 2018.\n\nAccording to the FBI, back in that December 2013 interview McCormick voluntarily told them\na great deal about his various businesses and online personas. He also apparently told\ninvestigators he talked with KrebsOnSecurity quite a bit, and that he’d tipped me off to some\nimportant developments in the malware scene. For example:\n\n“TM had found the email address of the Spyeye author in an old fake antivirus affiliate\nprogram database and that TM was able to find the true name of the Spyeye author from\nsearching online for an individual that used the email address,” the memo states. “TM\npassed this information on to Brian Krebs.”\n\n[Read more of the FBI’s interview with McCormick here (PDF).](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/McCormickInterview.pdf)\n\nNews of Škorjanc’s arrest comes amid other cybercrime takedowns in Germany this past\nweek. On Friday, German authorities announced they’d arrested seven people and were\ninvestigating six more in connection with the raid of a Dark Web hosting operation that\nallegedly supported multiple child porn, cybercrime and drug markets with hundreds of\nservers [buried inside a heavily fortified military bunker.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/german-cops-raid-cyberbunker-2-0-arrest-7-in-child-porn-dark-web-market-sting/)\n\n\n-----",
