It supports offline\nencryption using a combination of AES and RSA and targets documents, photos, and\ndatabases.\n\nThe authors claim it's FUD (fully undetectable), a claim that is supposedly backed by Virus\nTotal results where the strain returns zero detections.\n\nInterestingly, the ransomware module offers an option to set a timer that renders the files\ncompletely unrecoverable when it expires. This puts additional pressure on the victim to pay\nthe ransom quickly.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransomware timer threatening to corrupt files** _(Cyble)_\n\n## Real or scam?\n\n[Analysts at Cyble who discovered the Eternity Project told Bleeping Computer that while](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/05/12/a-closer-look-at-eternity-malware/)\nthey didn't have the chance to examine all of the modules yet, they have seen samples of the\nmalware circulating and used in the wild, and all user comments on Telegram point to this\nbeing a real threat.\n\nBy looking into the stealer module, Cyble analysts found several similarities to the Jester\n[Stealer, both probably derived from a GitHub project named DynamicStealer.](https://github.com/L1ghtM4n/DynamicStealer)\n\nAs such, the \"Eternity Stealer\" is most likely a copy of that code, followed by modifications\nand rebranding to sell it on Telegram for profit.\n\nEven if this is \"skidware\", the additional modules, customer support, automated building,\nand detailed instructions on how to use the malware, make it a potent weapon in the hands of\nunskilled hackers and a severe threat to internet users.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[German automakers targeted in year-long malware campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-automakers-targeted-in-year-long-malware-campaign/)\n\n[New powerful Prynt Stealer malware sells for just $100 per month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-powerful-prynt-stealer-malware-sells-for-just-100-per-month/)\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[Pixiv, DeviantArt artists hit by NFT job offers pushing malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pixiv-deviantart-artists-hit-by-nft-job-offers-pushing-malware/)\n\n[Beware: Onyx ransomware destroys files instead of encrypting them](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-onyx-ransomware-destroys-files-instead-of-encrypting-them/)\n\nAD\n\n\n-----\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
