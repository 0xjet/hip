The tactics, techniques,\nand procedures (TTPs) used in these older attacks support the hypothesis that Bumblebee\nmay have been introduced as a replacement loader for Trickbot and BazarLoader, since\nthere is some overlap between recent activity involving Bumblebee and older attacks linked\nto these loaders.\n\n## Bumblebee and Quantum: Bumblebee’s role in ransomware delivery\n\nA recent attack involving the Quantum ransomware demonstrates how Bumblebee is now\nbeing leveraged by attackers to deliver ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial infection vector was a spear-phishing email with an attachment containing an ISO\nfile. This ISO file contained a Bumblebee DLL file and an LNK file, which loaded the\nBumblebee DLL file using rundll32.exe.\n\nrundll32.exe teas.dll,kXlNkCKgFC\n\nBumblebee supports multiple commands like “Ins” for bot persistence, “Dij” for DLL injection,\nand “Dex” for downloading executables.\n\nBumblebee contacted a command-and-control (C&C) server (45.153.243.93) and created a\ncopy in the %APPDATA% folder with a random name, and also created a VBS file at the\nsame location to load the %APPDATA% DLL file.\n\nA scheduled task was created using the Bumblebee “Ins” command to run a VBS file every\n15 minutes.\n\nwscript.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\e147c18f9167cd0f\\f30b25c870238567.vbs\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\rundll32.exe\"\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\e147c18f9167cd0f\\f30b25c870238567.dll\n\nAfter a couple of hours, Bumblebee used the “Dex” command to drop and run a Cobalt Strike\npayload named “wab.exe” in the %APPDATA% location. It also ran the “systeminfo”\ncommand.\n\nwmiprvse.exe --> wab.exe\nwmiprvse.exe --> wab.exe --> cmd.exe /C systeminfo\n\nUsing the “Dij” command, Bumblebee then injected the Metasploit DLL into the legitimate\nprocess “ImagingDevices.exe”, which is a Windows Photo Viewer executable file.\n\nIn addition to this, using the “Dij” command Bumblebee injected the Cobalt Strike payload\ninto the legitimate “wab.exe”, which is a Windows Mail executable file.\n\nBumblebee then dropped the AdFind tool using the “Dij” command and tried to enumerate\ndomain-related information like domain trust, domain users, domain groups, and group\npermissions, etc.\n\nAt this point, Bumblebee dropped the Quantum ransomware using the “Dij” command. The\nattacker used both DLL and EXE payloads to encrypt files.\n\nrundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\2429189468.dll,start \\shareall \\nolog\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\2431789750.exe /shareall /NOLOG\n\n\n-----\n\nQuantum collects system information and user information using WMI. It also checks for\nSQL-related services and stops them if found running. Quantum also checks for some\nprocesses related to malware analysis like procmon, wireshark, cmd, task manager, and\nnotepad, and terminates them if found running.\n\n## Link 1: The AdFind connection\n\nTools used in recent Bumblebee attacks have appeared in older attacks, pre-dating\nBumblebee’s appearance. In a number of attacks involving Bumblebee beginning in mid-May\n2022, a version of AdFind (SHA256:\nb1102ed4bca6dae6f2f498ade2f73f76af527fa803f0e0b46e100d4cf5150682) was also\ndeployed by the attackers. AdFind is a publicly available tool for querying Active Directory\nand has been widely used by a range of threat actors in recent years.\n\nSimilar to the previously mentioned example, malicious ISO files attached to phishing emails\nwere the initial infection vector, with the attackers deploying legitimate ConnectWise remote\ndesktop software (formerly known as ScreenConnect), along with Atera, another legitimate\nremote access tool, and Meterpreter, a Metasploit in-memory payload that provides a\nreverse shell to the attacker. In all cases, the attacks never reached the payload stage.\nHowever, similarities TTPs used in other attacks suggest that ransomware was the intended\npayload.\n\nThis version of AdFind used in these recent Bumblebee attacks has appeared in attacks\ndating back as far as June 2021, where it was being used in conjunction with Cobalt Strike to\ndeliver the Avaddon ransomware.\n\nIn August 2021, it reappeared during an unsuccessful ransomware attack when it was used\nalongside a number of other legitimate software packages including AnyDesk, a publicly\navailable remote desktop tool; Splashtop, another remote desktop tool; and 7-Zip, the\npublicly available archiving tool. The attack was halted before a ransomware payload could\nbe deployed.\n\nDuring another abortive ransomware attack in May 2022, this variant of AdFind was also\ndeployed. Again, the attackers used Atera in conjunction with Splashtop and AnyDesk. The\nwidely used credential dumping tools Mimikatz and LaZagne were deployed, along with the\nNetScan network scanner. The attackers also made use of a PowerShell script named cve2021-34527.ps1 that has previously been linked to Conti’s leaked attack playbook.\n\nThis version of AdFind also appeared in attacks involving Quantum ransomware during May\n2022. The attackers also used Cobalt Strike; Ligolo, a publicly available tunneling tool\ncreated for penetration testing purposes, but which has been used by a number of espionage\n\n\n-----\n\nand ransomware actors; ProcDump for credential dumping; along with Rclone, a legitimate\nopen-source tool that can legitimately be used to manage content in the cloud, but is\nfrequently used by ransomware actors to exfiltrate data.\n\nMore recently, this same version of AdFind was used in an attack attempting to deliver the\nDiavol payload. The initial loader used by the attackers was not discovered, but the AdFind\nlink with Bumblebee activity suggests it may have been used by the attackers.\n\n## Link 2: adf.bat\n\nIn early June 2022, Bumblebee was used in a thwarted attack. Although the payload wasn’t\ndeployed, the TTPs used suggested ransomware. The attackers made use of a batch script\ncalled adf.bat (SHA256:\n1e7737a57552b0b32356f5e54dd84a9ae85bb3acff05ef5d52aabaa996282dfb) along the\npreviously mentioned version of AdFind (SHA256:\nb1102ed4bca6dae6f2f498ade2f73f76af527fa803f0e0b46e100d4cf5150682) and another\nversion of AdFind (SHA256:\n9d0fa4b88e5b36b8801b55508ab7bc7cda9909d639d70436e972cb3761d34eda).\n\nThis adf.bat script has been used in attacks since at least 2021. In September 2021, for\nexample, the file was deployed in what appeared to be an attempted ransomware attack. It\nwas used in conjunction with the previously mentioned version of AdFind (SHA256:\nb1102ed4bca6dae6f2f498ade2f73f76af527fa803f0e0b46e100d4cf5150682); Cobalt Strike;\nand PowerSploit, an exploitation framework originally developed for penetration testing.\n\nThe script was also used in another thwarted ransomware attack in November 2021, again\nalongside the previously mentioned version of AdFind. Once again the attackers used a\nnumber of publicly available tools, including Atera agent and Splashtop, along with Cobalt\nStrike. While the delivery mechanism wasn’t uncovered, some of the infrastructure used had\nbeen previously linked to infrastructure used by BazarLoader, which along with Trickbot, was\none of the primary pieces of malware used by the Miner cyber-crime group (aka Wizard\nSpider). Both were frequently used as part of the delivery mechanism for the group’s\nransomware families: Ryuk and Conti.\n\n## Link 3: find.exe/adfind.exe\n\nA third version of AdFind (SHA256:\n9d0fa4b88e5b36b8801b55508ab7bc7cda9909d639d70436e972cb3761d34eda) has also\nbeen used in recent attacks involving Bumblebee. This tool has been used in ransomware\nattacks for at least a year.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn May 2021, it was used alongside Cobalt Strike in an attempted ransomware attack against\na large electronics organization. One feature of this attack was that the attackers installed a\nVirtualBox VM on some compromised computers. While a VM image was not retrieved, it\nappeared that the ransomware payload was located on the VM and ran once the operating\nsystem was fully booted. The VM likely had access to the host computer’s files and\ndirectories (via \"SharedFolders\" set up by runner.exe), allowing it to encrypt files on the host\ncomputer. While the payload wasn’t identified, there were some links to both the Conti and\nMountlocker ransomware operations.\n\nIn another May 2021 attack it was again used in conjunction with Cobalt Strike in another\nabortive ransomware attack against an organization in the U.S. While the payload was not\ndeployed, some of the TTPs had links to earlier Conti attacks.\n\nAlso in May 2021, this version of AdFind was leveraged along with Cobalt Strike in an attack\nagainst an organization in Canada. In this case, the Conti ransomware was used.\n\n## Increase in use of legitimate software\n\nAside from Bumblebee’s links to a range of ransomware attacks, another commonality\nbetween many of the attacks investigated is the preponderance of legitimate software tools\nnow being deployed during ransomware attacks. Remote desktop tools such as\nConnectWise, Atera, Splashtop, and AnyDesk frequently feature in ransomware\ninvestigations, in addition to Rclone, which is now widely leveraged for data exfiltration\npurposes.\n\nMore recently, Symantec has seen attackers using the AvosLocker ransomware leveraging\nPDQ Deploy in their attacks. PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software package that allows users\nto manage patching on multiple software packages in addition to deploying custom scripts.\nAt least one affiliate of AvosLocker is now using it to execute malicious PowerShell\ncommands on multiple computers on victims’ networks using PowerShell Empire to deploy\nthe AvosLocker payload.\n\n## The Bumblebee threat\n\nBumblebee’s links to a number of high-profile ransomware operations suggest that it is now\nat the epicenter of the cyber-crime ecosystem. Any organization that discovers a Bumblebee\ninfection on its network should treat this incident with high priority since it could be the\npathway to several dangerous ransomware threats.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nIf an IOC is malicious and the file is available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect\nand block that file.\n\n\n-----\n\n6804cff68d9824efeb087e1d6ff3f98ed947f002626f04cf8ae7ef26b51e394b – Bumblebee\n\ndaf055e5c7f843a3dbe34c3c7b848e5bbe9c53b65df2556b4b450390154af3bb -
