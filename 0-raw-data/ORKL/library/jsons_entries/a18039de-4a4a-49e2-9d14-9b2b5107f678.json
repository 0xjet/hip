We discussed the threat actor’s reliance on certain IP ranges and\ndomains, as well as its naming conventions for malicious domains and command and control\nserver paths.\n\nIn this article we look at how the threat actor’s 2019 campaigns (even those continuing into\n2020) can be broadly grouped into three main “clusters” – and how all these, in turn, are\ncomplementary to its overarching strategic objectives in the context of current international\nrelations.\n\n## Clustering activity\n\n\n-----\n\nInvestigating Black Banshee s 2019 activity, and the infrastructure patterns emerging across\ndifferent campaigns and connecting them, we identified a number of activity “clusters”. Such\nclusters of campaigns and operations – identified based on our own datasets as well as\nexcellent open source research from others – are tied together by infrastructure links, similar\ntradecraft, shared indicators, and matching targeting.\n\nFigure 1 below shows the activity of several campaigns – grouped into such clusters –\nbetween November 2018 and February 2020:\n\nThe WildCommand cluster;\nThe BabyShark cluster; and,\nA credential harvesting cluster.\n\n**Figure 1. A high-level overview of campaigns conducted by Black Banshee throughout 2019.**\n\nThe dotted lines in the picture mark periods in which PwC analysts did not observe large volumes of activity related to acertain campaign, but in which such activity was likely in preparation, or still ongoing.\n\n### The Wild Cluster\n\nThe WildCommand cluster includes the activity first publicly detailed in AhnLab’s Operation\nKabar Cobra. The continuation of that activity was exposed in ThreatRecon’s Operation Kitty\nPhishing. We tracked this campaign as it continued throughout April and May 2019.\n\nAll this activity targeted the South Korean government sector, as well as aerospace and\ndefence contractors and cryptocurrency organisations doing business in South Korea. Based\non our analysis, we assessed that the operations were effectively part of the same\noverarching campaign, as they exhibited extensive overlaps in infrastructure and\ncorrespondence in tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) deployed – including a new\nmalware family at the time, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that we referred to as\nWildCommand.\n\n**Figure 2.time of a longer effort by Black Banshee. An evolution: Operation Kabar Cobra, Kitty Phishing, WildCommand and Missiles and Money are snapshots in**\n\nWe found further infrastructure links tying the WildCommand cluster to a campaign targeting\ncryptocurrency organisations, and active from 2018 until at least May 2019, which EST\n[Security has grouped under the name “Operation MoneyHolic”.](http://download.ahnlab.com/kr/site/library/Analysis_Report_Operation_Moneyholic.pdf)\n\nWe also saw multiple infrastructure connections between the WildCommand cluster and yet\nanother set of activity, dated around May 2019, leveraging a DLL RAT family that we refer to\nas MyDogs. MyDogs – a RAT that uses FTP to receive commands and exfiltrate files – was\n[reported on as being used in a cluster of activity called “Operation Red Salt” by AhnLab, in a](https://global.ahnlab.com/global/upload/download/asecreport/ASEC%20REPORT_vol.96_ENG.pdf)\ncampaign mostly targeted towards South Korean entities. Although the set of activity that\nAhnLab called Operation Red Salt was active around July 2019, we observed the leadup for\nthis campaign building from at least May 2019 – around the time when we also noticed a\ntemporary halt in the activity associated with Operation WildCommand.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecently, we have observed new WildCommand activity. This return of the WildCommand\ncampaign used similar TTPs to previous activity and a slightly updated version of the\nbackdoor, with samples compiled around 13th February 2020; from what we have been able\nto observe so far, this activity targeted financial sector entities in South East Asia.\n\n### The BabyShark cluster\n\nThe second cluster that PwC identified across Black Banshee’s 2019 activity revolves\naround a campaign, active since at least late 2018, that Palo Alto’s Unit42 called\n[“BabyShark” and EST Security refers to as “Operation SmokeScreen”. This campaign has](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/)\nconsistently targeted policy and national security think tanks as well as government entities\nin the US, South Korea, and European countries. It has also targeted organisations in the\ncryptocurrency space.\n\nWe noted infrastructure overlaps and indicator sharing between this and Prevailion’s\n“Autumn Aperture” report, including similar malware and the same author name –\n“windosmb” – present across multiple lure documents utilised in both campaigns. Such\nevidence led us to assess that the Autumn Aperture campaign likely constituted a\ncontinuation of the BabyShark campaign.\n\n**[Figure 3.Autumn Aperture campaign report, and ANSSI’s advisory on credential phishing activity attributed to Black Banshee. An example of overlaps between PwC reporting on BabyShark activity, Operation SmokeScreen, Prevailion’s](https://blog.prevailion.com/2019/09/autumn-aperture-report.html)**\n\n**Figure 4. The continuum of BabyShark activity between November 2018 and December 2019.**\n\nBabyShark activity often relied on compromised infrastructure instead of adversaryregistered domains. However, the naming of server-side folders remained consistent across\nBabyShark campaigns. Folders like “/customize/1111”, server-side files like “cow.php”,\n“expres.php”,  and malware parameters like “op=” remained characteristic of BabyShark\nmalware through its iterations until the current time.\n\nPwC analysts have routinely observed such server-side scripts on Black Banshee C2\ninfrastructure. These same server-side scripts were also observed in the context of a\n[campaign targeting the South Korean government and dubbed “Operation Stealth Power” by](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2234)\nEST Security. Although Operation Stealth Power was not directly linked to BabyShark\nactivity, the use of those same scripts effectively ties together different Black Banshee\ncampaigns based on the same infrastructure management TTPs.\n\n### A net cast wide: long-running, large-scale credential capture campaign\n\nSeparately, Prevailion noted some shared indicators and infrastructure connecting the\n“Autumn Aperture” campaign with activity discussed in a report by the Agence Nationale de\nla Sécurité des Systèmes d'Information (ANSSI), and also covered by Anomali in a late\nAugust 2019 report. Multiple infrastructure connections (examples of which are shown in\nFigure 4 above) and targeting similarities between the BabyShark campaign, Autumn\nAperture, and the ANSSI report, lead us to assess these sets of activity are likely part of the\n\n\n-----\n\nsame cluster . This is an overarching effort to target mainly foreign governments as well as\ninstitutions in the national security, policy, and education space – with multiple similarities\nacross the domains that we observed being set up between August and December 2018.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBoth the WildCommand and BabyShark activity cluster – as well as the credential harvesting\ncampaigns that PwC, ANSSI and Anomali have been tracking since at least 2018 – mainly\ntargeted entities and organisations in South Korean and the United States. These\ncampaigns’ operations focused on the following targets:\n\nGovernment (especially foreign governments, ministries, and diplomatic missions);\nNational security (especially with regards to national security policy, defence, and North\nKorea-related affairs);\nAerospace and defence,\nInternational relations and sanctions;\nNuclear-related policy; and,\nAcademia and research (especially in the nuclear space).\n\nIn this two-part series, we demonstrated how – within the horizon of PwC’s intelligence and\nvisibility, as well as of open source research – most of the campaigns conducted by Black\nBanshee in 2019 actually turned out to be interlinked, in terms of:\n\nInfrastructure overlaps crossing over multiple campaigns and betraying the threat\nactor’s overall modus operandi; and,\nOverall mission objectives, showing consistent targeting by Black Banshee.\n\nWe have seen Black Banshee introduce new tooling (like the WildCommand and MyDogs\nRATs, and BabyShark malware), and assess it is likely that the threat actor will continue\nupdating its toolset in upcoming campaigns.\n\nHowever, as we saw throughout 2019, Black Banshee continues to rely on a series of triedand-tested mechanisms, with distinctive operational tradecraft that emerges across its\ncampaigns. Going into 2020, we have not observed this activity decreasing or becoming less\naggressive, nor do we expect it do so – in fact, we expect Black Banshee to continue\nramping up operations, especially in the face of the current international state of heightened\ntension.\n\n## Contact us\n\n\n-----\n\n## Contact us\n\n[Form](https://cloud.uk.info.pwc.com/cyber-security-sign-up-to-updates)\n\nHide\n\n\n-----",
