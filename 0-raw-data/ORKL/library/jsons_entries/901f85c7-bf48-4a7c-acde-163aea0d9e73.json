We **[blogged about it and was able to tap into](https://blog.netlab.360.com/ddg-botnet-a-frenzy-of-updates-before-chinese-new-year-2/)**\nthe P2P network to track the infected devices again, and we logged a total of 5,695 devices\n\nIn Feb 2020, DDG made a major change regarding to its communication protocol again, a\nself-developed P2P protocol to build a hybrid P2P network has been adopted. The botnet still\nneeds static C2(IP or dns), but with this new development, the author basically has a fail\nback safe that even if the c2 is taken down, the infected devices are still going to keep going\nand perform the mining tasks.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith this new update, we correspondingly developed a new p2p tracking module that joins\nthe botnet’s P2P network to track it, the number we are getting this time is much lower\nthough, about 900 nodes every day, this has things to do with the new hybrid P2P\nimplementation as it won’t spit out all nodes now. And keep in mind that the botnet focuses\non intranet now, so there are probably many devices behind a single ip.\n\nTo get a better number of the infection in China, we collaborate with a trusted partner in\nChina, and was able to get the daily unique clients count just in China that connect to the\nactive C2 on its C2 port, the daily number is about 17,xxx. the compromised devices are\nmostly servers, so frequent IP change is not expected, and there will be noise in this number\nfor sure, but the number might provide some perspectives of the botnet’s size just in China.\n\nWe are now **[sharing the tracking demo with some related data and data parsing tools at](https://github.com/0xjiayu/DDGBotnetTracker/tree/master/v2)**\nGithub, so more security researchers can take a good look at it and hopefully slow down the\nseemingly unstoppable DDG botnet.\n\nCurrently, DDG only goes after weak SSH password for one single user name root, and the\npassword dictionary comes with DDG has 17,907 entries in it, so make sure you have strong\npassword for your root (and all other accounts)!\n\nWe are now simultaneously publishing a VERY lengthy technical write up, including IoCs\n[with this blog here for readers who want to read all the newest details. Take a breath and](https://blog.netlab.360.com/ddg-upgrade-to-new-p2p-hybrid-model/)\ncheck it out!\n\n\n-----",
