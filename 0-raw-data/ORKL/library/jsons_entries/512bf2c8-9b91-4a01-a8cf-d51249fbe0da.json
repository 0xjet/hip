It is highly\ncustomizable, which allows threat actors to tailor it to their particular needs.\n\nFirst seen in-the-wild in 2014, Agent Tesla has gone through many iterations, developing\nnew capabilities for causing mayhem and escaping detection along the way. It has used\nthese features to maintain itself as one of the most prevalent Remote Access Trojans (RAT)\nacross the cyber threat-landscape.\n\n_[Read our original writeup on “Secret” Agent Tesla here.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/threat-spotlight-secret-agent-tesla)_\n\n### Operating System\n\n Risk & Impact\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to its prevalence, ready availability, and highly sophisticated nature, Agent Tesla has a\nhigh impact rating.\n\n### Malware-as-a-Service\n\nAgent Tesla was first available for purchase from an official website agenttesla[.]com. This\nwebsite offered cybercriminals and threat actors flexible pricing options and fixed term\nlicenses to use the malware. Paying users would get a sophisticated graphical user\ninterface and a dashboard for management of victim devices, providing ease-of-use for\neven the most novice of threat actors.\n\nCurrently, there are two prominent variants of Agent Tesla still found in-the-wild:\n\n**Version 2 – First released version of the malware, with a focus on obfuscation and**\nanti-analysis.\n**Version 3 – Additional customization options, advances in obfuscation and further**\nfunctionality.\n\nBoth variants have varying levels of obfuscation. In version 2, a single function decrypts all\nthe strings and allows them to be executed. In version 3, each encrypted string has its own\nfunction, which makes reverse engineering these static strings more difficult.\n\nBoth versions of the malware can communicate over HTTP, SMTP, and FTP. Recent\nvariants of Agent Tesla version 3 have been seen abusing the chat platform Telegram. This\nlatter version also provides the option to use a Tor client to encrypt communications.\n\n### Infection Vector\n\nAgent Tesla can be dropped onto a victim’s machine in a wide array of ways. Email\nattachment is its most common deployment vector. These lure attachments can differ\ngreatly with the aim of generating a click by a potential victim and initiating its malicious\npayload.\n\nThis malware has been observed dropping from weaponized documents that\ncontain a malicious payload that downloads Agent Tesla, or it may deploy itself via an\nexecutable email attachment.\n\nThis large degree of flexibility is another reason why the malware is still such a prevalent\nthreat, even years after its initial release.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce deployed on a victim s device, the malware will initially fingerprint the device to\nconfirm infection, sending this information back to its Command and Control (C2) before\ncarrying out its large magnitude of malicious information stealing capabilities.\n\n_Figure 1: Example of Infection vector process flow._\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a typical spam email used by Agent Tesla. This email includes a\nRAR archive attachment (.rar), which is the initial step in this sample’s multi-stage infection\nprocess. The attachment masquerades as something of interest to the user, and has a\nsuffix of ‘_pdf’ before the file extension. This naming convention is an attempt to fool the\nvictim into believing they are opening a PDF document and not a malicious archive.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Recent Mal spam email._\n\nWithin this RAR archive is another disguised EXE file. The executable file also uses the\nsuffix ‘_pdf’ before the file extension.\n\nThis behavior can be seen in Figure 3. The bundled EXE file is a Nullsoft Scriptable\nInstaller. When it is run, it launches several processes that use ‘Living off the Land’ (LotL)\ntechniques to harvest information.\n\nLiving off the Land techniques maliciously abuse native system programs and tools found\non a victim’s machine. Samples of Agent Tesla use these techniques in a wide range of\nways to both insert the malware onto a victim machine, and to use native system\ncommands to obtain device information.\n\nThis information can then be utilized by the malware and exfiltrated:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Content of malicious RAR archive._\n\nThe lures used by attackers can differ greatly depending on the requirements of the\npotential victim. The malware can also arrive as a weaponized document that contains a\nmalicious macro payload, which downloads Agent Tesla.\n\n### Deployment\n\nIf the malicious attachment is executed by the user, the executable downloads additional\ncomponents. These components are often hosted on legitimate websites, which also helps\nthem evade detection by security products and services.\n\nIn one Agent Tesla loader sample observed by the BlackBerry Research Team, the file\nmasqueraded as a Databasic. This is a C#/VB.NET database utility developed by Czech\n[freelance developer and trainer known as Tom Fidlr:](https://github.com/Databasic-NET/Databasic)\n\n_Figure 4: Embedded file version information._\n\n\n-----\n\nAgent Tesla employs many techniques to help evade detection and impede analysis.\nExamining the binary in a .NET decompiler shows that the file’s function names and strings\nare heavily obfuscated. Based on the namespace labels and assembly comments, it\nappears the sample has been obfuscated with SmartAssembly 7.3.0.3296:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: File Obfuscation visible in DNSpy._\n\nIncluded with the file’s resources is a PNG image. Agent Tesla uses steganography\ntechniques, where an image contains an embedded Program Executable (PE) image that is\ndynamically decoded:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Malicious PNG resource._\n\nThe obfuscated PE image contains a .NET DLL file, which is the next step in the installation\nprocess. Once the PE image has been de-obfuscated during runtime, it calls the SelectorX\nmethod in SimpleUI.MDI:\n\nFigure 7: Second stage Agent Tesla loader.\n\n_Figure 8: .NET DLL calling SelectorX._\n\nAs part of Agent Tesla’s layered approach, this decoded DLL calls another loader. This\nloader launches a legitimate Microsoft .NET services installation tool (RegSvcs.exe) in a\nsuspended state:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Code Injection into Regsvcs.exe._\n\nUsing the technique called process hollowing, Agent Tesla unmaps the memory of\nRegSvcs.exe and overwrites this memory space with its malicious code before resuming\nthe suspended thread. In allows the malware to mask its activities as a legitimate process.\n\nFigure 10: Write Process Memory for PE header.\n\n_Figure 11: Resume Thread call._\n\nThe new ‘RegSvcs.exe’ then begins searching the host for information such as the active\ncomputer name and TCP settings:\n\n_Figure 12: Regsvc.exe searching the host machine._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware then creates a new folder AvrzbM and a file called AvrzbM.exe in\n**‘C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\’. This behaviour differs per sample,**\ndepending on how the malware variant is predefined during its creation:\n\n_Figure 13: Copy of 'RegSvc.exe' is created in %AppData% directory under the defined_\n_named 'AvzbM.exe'._\n\nThe malware creates the following registry key to achieve persistence:\n\n**“HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\” location.**\n\n_Figure 14: Additional Persistence Mechanisms._\n\nThe threat will search through the victim’s machine for a pre-defined list of specific software\nand utilities. These lists tend to vary per sample, but they can be quite long. The goal of this\nfunctionality is to locate software to steal information from, by extracting saved credentials.\nThis stolen information is stored for later exfiltration.\n\n### Browser Stealing Activities\n\nThe first set of utilities the malware searches for are web browsers. Most Agent Tesla\nsamples contain a large, predefined list of Internet browsers that the malware attempts to\nfind on the victim’s machine. If those browsers are located, the threat targets the place\nwhere their credentials are stored, and sends them back to the threat actor.\n\nAgent Tesla looks for the presence of both popular web-browsers like Chromium and\nFirefox as well as more uncommon web-browsers.\n\nPlease see Appendix A for the observed list.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15: Searching the victim’s machine for stored credentials._\n\n### Email Stealing Activities\n\nAgent Tesla will search through the device for the presence of a list of different email\nclients. If it finds them, it will attempt to deploy several measures depending on the specific\nclient, to steal its login credentials before storing them for extraction.\n\nPlease see Appendix B for the observed list.\n\n_Figure 16: Searching for email utilities._\n\n### FTP Utility Stealing Activities\n\nFTP utilities are also targeted for the purpose of stealing login credentials. If an FTP utility is\npresent on the victim’s device, Agent Tesla will attempt to obtain that information while also\ntargeting other information unique to specific applications, which we discuss in more detail\nin the FileZilla section.\n\nPlease see Appendix C for the observed list.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17: Searching for FTP utilities._\n\n### VPN Client and Miscellaneous Stealing Activities\n\nBecause Agent Tesla is highly customizable, some samples also include the ability to\nsearch for other software and utilities on a victim’s machine. For example, some Agent\nTesla Version 3 samples steal credentials of VPN clients, along with those of downloading\ntools and remote server desktop applications.\n\nPlease see Appendix D & E for the observed list of additional tools and applications.\n\n### Exfiltration\n\nOnce the malware has retrieved all available credentials and other assorted data from a\nvictim’s machine, it sends this information over email/SMTP protocol using a hardcoded port\n587:\n\nFigure 18: Sample utilizes SMTP via port 587.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19: Network capture of initial SMTP communication._\n\n### Communication\n\nBoth Version 2 and Version 3 of Agent Tesla can be configured to communicate over HTTP,\nSMTP, and FTP. The threat actor selects this configuration when building a new malicious\nsample.\n\nIn Version 3 of the malware, Agent Tesla added an additional form of communication. It\nabuses the popular Instant Messenger (IM) Telegram to communicate with its Command\nand Control (C2) infrastructure.\n\nMost Agent Tesla samples abuse SMTP as their desired communication method.\n\nThough the information-stealing capabilities operate in a similar manner across all forms of\ncommunication, the way data is exfiltrated can vary depending on both version of the\nmalware and configuration of a specific sample:\n\n**Communication** **Description**\n\n**SMTP** Compromised email accounts are utilized to exfiltrate information to a\nmail server operated by malicious actors.\n\n**HTTP** Sends compromised data to web panel operated by malicious actors.\n\n**FTP** Upload data to a malicious controlled FTP server.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Telegram** Exfiltrate data via maliciously setup Telegram chat rooms. (Version 3\nonly)\n\nAgent Tesla is heavily obfuscated to avoid initial static analysis steps. This can hide the\nmalicious code and its true intentions when it is run in a malware sandbox. After we\ndecoded it, we were able to observe it statically to understand its inner workings and\ncapabilities, such as the SMTP form of exfiltration as seen in the image below (Figure 20).\n\nThis observed sample uses SMTP as its form of exfiltration. This protocol is often used\nbecause there is limited overhead required by the attacker, as the threat actor only needs a\nsingle compromised email account to accomplish their malicious activities:\n\n_Figure 20: Example of SMTP exfiltration process._\n\n### Fingerprinting\n\nAgent Tesla gathers information from the infected machine for tagging a new infection and\n‘fingerprinting’ the victim’s machine, to indicate that it has been compromised.\n\nThis data includes:\n\nComputer Name\nUser’s Name\nIP information\nInternet Connectivity\nProcessor name and information\nMemory\nOperating System\n\nIn samples observed by the BlackBerry Research Team, Agent Tesla makes a HTTP\nRequest to ‘api[.]ipify[.]org’. This is a public web API that returns the external IP address of\nthe victim’s device. The IP address is stored by the threat actor, and it is used in the\nmalware’s user-interface when they are interacting with the information they have exfiltrated\nwith the malware:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21: Agent Tesla reaches out to 'api[.]ipify[.]org._\n\n### Core Commands\n\nBoth Agent Tesla Version 2 and Version 3 contain a set of core commands for information\nstealing and gathering. The malware’s primary goals are keylogging and gathering\nscreenshots, as well as stealing cookies and credentials.\n\nThe specifics of these commands, and which applications the threat focuses on, can vary\nfrom sample to sample:\n\n\n**String**\n**Command**\n\n\n**Command**\n**Action**\n\n\n**Description**\n\nRecord keystrokes, periodically logging and dating them\nbefore sending stolen info to its C2.\n\nScreenshot images of victim’s screen, saving and dating them\nbefore periodically sending them to C2\n\nHeavily varies per-sample; attempts to steal user and\npassword logins from a wide-range of applications and\nutilities.\n\nCustomizable, attempts to steal cookie information from a\nwide range of Internet browsers.\n\n\n**KL** Keyboard\nLogging\n\n**SC** Screenshot\nGather\n\n**PW** Credential\nStealing\n\n**CO** Cooking\nStealing\n\n### Uninstall\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 22: Uninstaller functionality._\n\nSome samples of Agent Tesla have further commands and capabilities, such as the\nmalware having the ability to uninstall itself.\n\nThis functionality could be used by Agent Tesla to briefly infect a victim’s machine, exfiltrate\ndata, and then remove its presence from a device, with these interactions going unnoticed\nby the victim.\n\n### Cookies\n\nAgent Tesla attempts to gather browser cookies from a list of predefined browsers. These\ncookies are sent back to the C2 server so that attackers can look for any login credentials\nor other sensitive information that might be present:\n\n_Figure 23: Gathering cookies from predefined Internet browsers._\n\n\n-----\n\nAgent Tesla will also gather any cookies from the SQLite cookies database for the list of\npredefined browsers seen below:\n\n_Figure 24: Gathering cookies from SQLite directories of predefined Internet browsers._\n\nThis threat also gathers additional information from the “\\User Data” directory of the\npredefined browsers listed below:\n\n_Figure 25: Gathering information from \\Users Data directory of predefined Internet_\n_browsers._\n\nThe malware searches the “\\CoreFTP\\site” directory to grab usernames and passwords for\nFTP applications:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 26: FTP application credential-grabbing._\n\nThe malware searches for any browser credentials:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 27: Internet browser credential-grabbing._\n\n### Keystrokes\n\nKeystrokes are also recorded and sent to the C2 server in the hopes that further sensitive\ninformation can be obtained from the victim's machine:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 28: Keylogging functionality._\n\n### Clipboard\n\nAgent Tesla can also harvest data from the system clipboard. It does this by calling the APIs\n‘SetClipboardViewer’ to register itself, so that it is alerted whenever data is updated on the\nclipboard:\n\n_Figure 29: Clipboard harvesting functionality._\n\nTo display the functionality of the clipboard stealer found in Agent Tesla, a sentence was\ntyped out and copied to the clipboard on a test victim machine:\n\n“This is an example of the clipboard stealer”\n\nThis information was exfiltrated and observed before being decoded to reveal the stolen\nclipboard information. It is further noted that Agent Tesla will label the stolen clipboard\ncontents with the tag [Clipboard] for ease of use by the threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 30: URL Decoded information._\n\n### Screenshots\n\nThe screenshot exfiltration function allows the malware to capture an image of the infected\nmachine. It sends the image back to the C2 server as a JPEG image:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 31: Malware screenshot functionality._\n\nExfiltrated information is sent back to Agent Tesla’s C2 server as Triple DES-EDE3\nencrypted data. This data can be captured, parsed, and decrypted, revealing a further layer\nof obfuscation as these stolen images are transported as Base64 encoded data.\n\nThis data can be decoded and rendered to reveal the screen capture the malware took on\nthe victim’s device, as seen in Figure 32:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 32: Decoded image data sent back to the C2 server._\n\n### FTP\n\nFTP usernames and passwords are harvested and sent via a STOR Request. A STOR\nrequest is issued after a data connection has been established and a victim client wishes to\nupload a local copy of a file to a server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 33: FTP credential stealing functionality._\n\n### Open-VPN\n\nThe malware then searches the Open-VPN directory “Software\\OpenVPN-GUI\\configs” for\nfurther potential credentials:\n\n_Figure 34: Open-VPN credential grabbing._\n\n### NordVPN\n\nJust like above, the malware searches the NordVPN configuration folder for usernames and\npasswords:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 35: NordVPN credential grabbing._\n\n### FileZilla\n\nAgent Tesla searches the FileZilla ‘recent servers’ folder within the “\\AppData” directory for\ninformation related to recently established connections with FTP servers. It gathers the\nhostname, port number, and username:\n\n_Figure 36: FileZilla recent-server grabbing._\n\n### Outlook\n\nAgent Tesla variants can now attempt to steal email addresses and login credentials. This\ncan be used as a pivoting point to illicitly login to a victim’s email clients, to gather and steal\nthe contents.\n\nHere, we see Agent Tesla looking for Registry Keys that signify that Microsoft Outlook is\ninstalled and used on the device by the victim, before attempting to harvest password\ninformation:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 37: Outlook credential grabbing (1 of 2).\n\n_Figure 38: Outlook credential grabbing (2 of 2)._\n\n### Tor Proxy\n\n\n-----\n\nVersion 3 of Agent Tesla uses the Tor client in order to conceal communications. The\nmalware already encrypts all C2 traffic, but using Tor further anonymizes its actions.\n\nTor is an open-source networking client that is designed to enable anonymous connection\nand communication. Tor itself promotes the use of concealing location and usage from\ntraffic analysis and networking monitoring.\n\nAgent Tesla V3 reaches out to the official Tor website to download the client. It also checks\nto see if the Tor client is either present on the device or currently running. If so, the malware\nattempts to kill this process and download a new one. It attempts to alter the default\nconfiguration file of Tor, which is known as ‘torrc’:\n\n_Figure 39: Downloading of Tor Client._\n\nThese alterations will create a localized Tor proxy on port 9050, once its de-obfuscated.\nThis port number was hardcoded in the observed sample:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 40: Utilization of the Tor proxy._\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere has been a recent resurgence in Agent Tesla samples in the wild, despite it\npreviously having been reported to be on the decline and no longer for sale.\n\nThe same distribution methods have prevailed, and recently discovered samples have been\ndistributed using spam emails and malicious attachments.\n\nThe samples we observed used several techniques to avoid detection. They abuse genuine\nemail servers to steal as much information as possible. The latest versions of this threat\nadd the ability to customize how information is exfiltrated, and include new forms of\ncommunication.\n\n### Yara Rule\n\nThe following Yara rule was authored by the BlackBerry Threat Research Team to catch the\nthreat described in this document:\n\n\n-----\n\nimport \"pe\"\n\nrule Mal_InfoStealer_Win32_AgentTesla_2021\n\n{\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"Detects AgentTesla V3\"\n\nauthor = \"BlackBerry Threat Research Team \"\n\ndate = \"2021-06\"\n\nstrings:\n$x1 = \"get_Provider\"\n\n$x2 = \"PADPADP\"\n\n$x3 = \"/VB.NET database utility\"\n\n$x4 = \"v4.0.30319\"\n\n$x5 = \".cctor\"\n\ncondition:\n\n//PE File\n\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and\n\n// DotNet\n\npe.imports(\"mscoree.dll\", \"_CorExeMain\") and\n\n// File imphash\n\npe.imphash() == \"f34d5f2d4577ed6d9ceec516c1f5a744\" and\n\n// PE Sections\n\npe.number_of_sections == 3 and\n\n// Checksum is not set and does not match\n\npe.checksum != pe.calculate_checksum() and\n\n//All Strings\n\nall of ($x*)\n\n}\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nAt BlackBerry, we take a [prevention-first and AI-driven approach to cybersecurity. Putting](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/01/from-aspiration-to-realization-the-evolution-of-the-prevention-first-approach-to-security)\nprevention first neutralizes malware before the exploitation stage of the kill-chain.\n\nBy stopping malware at this stage, BlackBerry solutions help organizations increase their\nresilience. It also helps reduce infrastructure complexity and streamline security\nmanagement to ensure business, people, and endpoints are secure.\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to Agent Tesla being so customizable, this information tends to vary between\nsamples:\n\n**File System Actions:**\n\nCreated\n\nC:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\%AvrzbM%\\%AvrzbM.exe%\n\n**Registries:**\n\nCreated\n\nKey:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\%AvrzbM%\n\nValue: C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\%AvrzbM%\\%AvrzbM.exe%\n\n**Mutex:**\n\n%FciEzCUbpfPiIrzZAOtOj%\n\n**Network:**\n\nProtocol: smtp\nHost: mail[.]rakub[.]org[.]bd\nPort: 587\n\nAppendix A\n\n\n**Software**\n**Name**\n\n**Browsers**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nCocCoc Freeware browser focused on the Vietnamese region/market\n\nPale Moon Open Source, Mozilla-derived web browser available for Microsoft®\nWindows and Linux\n\nFirefox Web-browser\n\nFlock A discontinued web browser that specialized in providing social\nnetworking and Web 2.0 facilities built into its user interface\n\n\n-----\n\nLieabao Chinese web browser by KingSoft\n\nIridium Web browser based on the Chromium code base\n\nChromePlus ChromePlus by MapleStudio is a web browser that tries to offer an\nimproved Chromium version\n\nChromium Open-source codebase for web-browser\n\nOrbitum Web browser developed based on Chromium with unique applications for\nsocial networks\n\nCoowon Google Chrome based browser\n\n360Chrome Web browser made by Chinese company Qihoo 360\n\nSputnik Web browser extension which I designed to search IPs, Domains, File\nHashes, and URLs using free Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)\nresources quickly and easily\n\nAmigo Web browser based on Chromium and it was created with the intent to\nsurf through social medias with a specially made panel\n\nOpera Freeware web browser for Microsoft Windows, Android, iOS, macOS, and\nLinux operating systems, developed by Opera Software\n\n7Star Chromium-based web browser\n\nTorch Web browser for Windows developed by Torch media, based on\nChromium.\n\nYandex Russian web browser developed by Yandex\n\nSleipnir5 A tabbed web browser developed by Fenrir Inc.
