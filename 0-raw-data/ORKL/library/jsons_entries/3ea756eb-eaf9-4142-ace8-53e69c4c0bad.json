Despite CTU™](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/cobalt-mirage)\n[researchers publicly disclosing COBALT MIRAGE tactics, techniques, and procedures](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/cobalt-mirage-conducts-ransomware-operations-in-us)\n\n\n-----\n\n(TTPs) in May 2022, the threat actors continue to demonstrate many of the same behaviors.\n\n[In this incident, COBALT MIRAGE exploited the ProxyShell vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473,](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/8/17/from-pwn2own-2021-a-new-attack-surface-on-microsoft-exchange-proxyshell)\n[CVE-2021-34523, and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34523) [CVE-2021-31207). It is likely that the compromise was opportunistic](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31207)\n[rather than targeted. In keeping with their established intrusion pattern, the threat actors](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/cobalt-mirage-conducts-ransomware-operations-in-us)\ndeployed multiple web shells and TunnelFish, a customized variant of Fast Reverse Proxy\n[(FRPC). They then enabled the DefaultAccount with a password commonly used by](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)\nCOBALT MIRAGE (P@ssw0rd1234) and encrypted several servers using BitLocker.\n\nThe threat actors attempted to remove traces of their activities, deleting web shells, tools,\nand audit logs. However, several tools and artifacts were recoverable. The TunnelFish\nsample was configured to communicate with two command and control (C2) domains:\ngupdate . us and msupdate . top. While investigating these domains, CTU researchers\ndiscovered additional infrastructure linked to COBALT MIRAGE: mssync . one, upmirror . top,\n104 . 168 . 117 . 149, 172 . 245 . 26 . 118, and 193 . 142 . 59 . 174. CTU researchers also\ndiscovered copies of a ransom note in the victim’s environment that referenced a Telegram\naccount (@BuySafety) and email address (buysafety @ onionmail . org) observed in prior\nintrusions.\n\nCOBALT MIRAGE usually leaves a ransom note in the form of a .txt text file. However, in this\ncase the threat actors copied a PDF file containing the ransom text (Hi.pdf) into the victim’s\nenvironment. Based on evidence from recovered log files, it appears multiple copies of the\nPDF file were created alongside multiple .txt files with the same content. While other copies\nof the PDF were deleted, a copy remained in the threat actor’s staging directory. This\noversight resulted in the disclosure of information that could reveal the identity of an\nindividual engaged in COBALT MIRAGE activity. The metadata of the Hi.pdf ransom note\nindicates that the document was created on December 17, 2021 by “ahmad khatibi” in a UTC\n+3.30 time zone (see Figure 1). This time zone corresponds to Iran Standard Time (IRST).\nThe timestamp appears to be authentic.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Metadata from Hi.pdf showing creator name and time zone. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nA LinkedIn profile lists Ahmad Khatibi as the CEO of Afkar System Co., a company based in\nIran. In June 2022, anti-Iranian regime whistleblower persona Lab_Dookhtegan posted a\nseries of tweets about Ahmad Khatibi and Afkar System, stating they are operating on behalf\nof Intelligence Organization of Sepah (see Figure 2). Sepah is a reference to the Islamic\nRevolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC), and the Intelligence Organization (IRGC-IO) is a\n[subordinate unit. The IRGC-IO is one of Iran’s primary intelligence functions and reportedly](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/irans-widening-crackdown-pressures-rouhani)\noperates a cyber division.\n\n_Figure 2. Lab_Dookhtegan tweet on June 23, 2022 referencing Ahmad Khatibi and Afkar_\n_System. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nLab_Dookhtegan’s allegations appear to reinforce that the creator reference in the ransom\nnote is legitimate and is not a false flag implicating an unrelated individual. Operational\nsecurity failures revealing attribution is not uncommon with Iranian cyber operations. Past\nexamples documented by CTU researchers include the identification of a developer linked to\nmalicious Iranian activity, and Iranian malware developers infecting their own system and\ndisclosing screenshots of their development environments on the internet.\n\n\n-----\n\nLab_Dookhtegan has been active on Twitter and Telegram since 2019. They have leaked\nverified source code and tools linked to several Iranian threat groups, including COBALT\nGYPSY and [COBALT EDGEWATER. They have also leaked information about multiple](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/cobalt-edgewater)\nindividuals and companies that allegedly work for the IRGC and the Iranian Ministry of\nIntelligence and Security (MOIS).\n\nIn April 2022, Lab_Dookhtegan reported via their Telegram and Twitter channels that Iranian\ncompany Najee Technology and Secnerd also operate on behalf of the IRGC-IO (see Figure\n3).\n\n_Figure 3. Tweet alleging connections among Najee Technology, Secnerd, and the IRGC._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe source of Lab_Dookhtegan's information is unknown, but CTU researchers\nindependently identified links between known COBALT MIRAGE infrastructure and Najee\nTechnology. DNS resolution data, WHOIS data, and website analysis reveal a series of\nconnections between two COBALT MIRAGE domains (newdesk . top and symantecserver .\nco) and an IP address (185 . 208 . 77 . 164) hosting two Iranian (.ir) domains: secnerd . ir\nand najee . ir (see Figure 4). Najee . ir was an official website for Najee Technology but no\nlonger hosts content promoting the company’s presence.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Connections between COBALT MIRAGE infrastructure and Najee Technology._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe uk7 . updates . icu domain hosts an instance of the GitLab code collaboration platform\nthat reveals an account for a user named unkn19wn (see Figure 5). This detail links updates\n. icu to secnerd . ir and najee . ir.\n\n_Figure 5. GitLab interface showing unkn19wn account. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThis same alias appears in an email address (unkn19wn @ gmail . com) that was used to\nregister najee . ir and secnerds . com. WHOIS records show the domain registrant as\nMansour Ahmadi. Public records of Iranian companies list Mansour Ahmadi as the CEO of\nNajee Technology. Mansour Ahmadi also appears in the WHOIS registrant information for the\ndomain misaq . me, which has resolved to COBALT MIRAGE IP address 148 . 251 . 71 .\n182.\n\n\n-----\n\nContent hosted on najee . ir in 2015 shows Mansour Ahmadi (also known as Unkn19wn)\ndeveloping an interest in hacking and website defacement and expressing dislike for the U.S.\nand Israel. Secnerd . ir is offline as of this publication but previously hosted content related to\n[cybersecurity and advertised for iOS and Android developers. It was cited in an incident](https://twitter.com/MayhemDayOne/status/1496504333843800064)\ninvolving the mass accumulation and accidental disclosure of Iranian citizens' social media\ndata. It is likely that Mansour Ahmadi leads both Najee Technology and Secnerd and that\nthese entities’ connection to COBALT MIRAGE activity represent just a portion of their\ntechnology and cybersecurity-related projects.\n\nIt is likely that updates . icu, secnerd . ir and najee . ir are all operated by the same group of\nindividuals and that those individuals support COBALT MIRAGE attacks. CTU analysis links\nAfkar System, Najee Technology, and Secnerd to COBALT MIRAGE but cannot verify\nreported links to the IRGC-IO. However, the pattern of private Iranian companies acting as\nfronts or providing support for Iranian intelligence operations is well established. In 2016, the\nU.S. Department of Justice [indicted seven Iranians employees of ITSec Team and Mersad](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged)\nCompany for supporting the government of Iran and the IRGC in attacking the U.S. financial\n[sector in 2011 and 2012. In 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm611)\nindividuals linked to Net Peygard Samavat Company (later known as Emennet Pasargad) for\n[working with the IRGC and MOIS. In 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1127)\nRana Intelligence Computing Company and some of its employees, describing it as a front\ncompany that conducts computer intrusions and malware campaigns on behalf of MOIS.\n\nFigure 6 likely represents the working relationship between Najee Technology, Secnerd,\nAfkar System, and the IRGC-IO. The exact nature of these companies’ involvement in\nCOBALT MIRAGE activity remains unclear, although evidence indicates that at a minimum\nthey provide network infrastructure and support the ransomware attacks. Third-party\n[reporting on UNC2448 appears to describe COBALT MIRAGE activity and links the group to](https://www.mandiant.com/media/17826)\n[Najee Technology and Afkar System. Similar reporting on DEV-0270, another COBALT](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/09/07/profiling-dev-0270-phosphorus-ransomware-operations/)\nMIRAGE alias, attributes the group to a company that functions under two public aliases:\nSecnerd (secnerd . ir) and Lifeweb (lifeweb . ir). The DEV-0270 reporting states that these\norganizations are linked to Najee Technology.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Potential relationships between Najee, Secnerd, Afkar System, and the IRGC-IO._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe model of Iranian government intelligence functions using contractors blurs the lines\nbetween the actions tasked by the government and the actions that the private company\ntakes on its own initiative. While part of COBALT MIRAGE activity appears espionagefocused, a significant portion is focused on opportunistic revenue generation through its\nransomware activities. While these companies may work with the IRGC-IO, the ransomware\nattacks could be another source of revenue that they can pursue without fear of prosecution\nby Iranian law enforcement. Other Iranian threat groups such as COBALT SAPLING (also\nknown as Moses Staff) and COBALT SHADOW (also known as Agrius and BlackShadow)\nhave made use of ransomware in their attacks. However, the primary intent of these attacks\nappeared to be disruption and harassment of the victim rather than revenue generation.\n\nAlthough the ProxyShell vulnerabilities were disclosed in August 2021, COBALT MIRAGE\ncontinues to have success exploiting them to compromise organizations. CTU researchers\nadvise organizations to routinely validate that all internet-facing systems are appropriately\npatched and take swift mitigating actions where gaps are found.\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1.
