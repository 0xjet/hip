The nature and geographic spread of the targets seems to point to a sponsor,\nor sponsors, with regional, political interests. The attackers, whom we have named Packrat, have shown a keen and systematic\ninterest in the political opposition and the independent press in so-called ALBA countries (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas),\nand their recently allied regimes. These countries are linked by a trade agreement as well as a cooperation on a range of nonfinancial matters.\n\nAfter observing a wave of attacks in Ecuador in 2015, we linked these attacks to a campaign active in Argentina in 2014. The\ntargeting in Argentina was discovered when the attackers attempted to compromise the devices of Alberto Nisman and Jorge\nLanata. Building on what we had learned about these two campaigns, we then traced the group’s activities back as far as 2008.\n\nThis report brings together many of the pieces of this campaign, from malware and phishing, to command and control infrastructure\nspread across Latin America. It also highlights fake online organizations that Packrat has created in Venezuela and Ecuador. Who is\nresponsible? We assess several scenarios, and consider the most likely to be that Packrat is sponsored by a state actor or actors,\ngiven their apparent lack of concern about discovery, their targets, and their persistence. However, we do not conclusively attribute\nPackrat to a particular sponsor.\n\n## Part 1: Packrat’s Seven Years of Activity\n\nThe authors on this report have been independently investigating malware and phishing campaigns in Latin America. This report is\nthe result of discovering that the cases we have been investigating are linked by a common threat actor with targeting in several\ncountries, including Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil. We refer to this threat actor as Packrat, to highlight their preference\nfor packed, commodity Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and their retention of the same domains and servers over many years.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 1: Some of Packrat’s known targets and activity types\nPackrat has systematically targeted high profile political figures, journalists, and others in several countries with malware and\nphishing. In total we uncovered 12 different malware command and control domains, and over 30 samples of malware stretching\nover a seven year time period. Packrat also favors an interesting strategy: create and maintain fake opposition groups and news\norganizations, then use these to distribute malware and conduct phishing attacks.\n\nSome of these organizations exist in name only, while others have a more elaborate online presence. Packrat has also created\nelaborate fake news organizations without any evidence we can find of malware or phishing activity.\n\nImage 2: Packrat’s major activities\nWe chart Packrat’s activities back to at least 2008. Through correlation of network infrastructure, we identified several waves of\nactivity, coupled with changes in tools and tactics. This section provides a brief chronology of Packrat’s network infrastructure and\nactivities. For a detailed chronology of the malware used, see 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants.\n\n### Packrat’s Greatest Hits\n\n\n-----\n\n**2008 2013**\nTools and infrastructure used by Packrat suggest that they have been active since at least 2008. During this period, Packrat used\nhosting services in Brazil, and some of their malware samples were uploaded from Brazilian IP space to popular online virus\nscanning services. Some of the messages they sent also contained Brazilian bait content. While this is suggestive of Brazilian\ntargeting, we have yet to find confirmed victims from this period.\n\n**2014**\nBy 2014, Packrat was targeting high-profile Argentine lawyer Alberto Nisman, and well-known investigative journalist and television\nnews host, Jorge Lanata. Maximo Kirchner, son of Argentina’s president, also announced that he was targeted. The screenshot he\nreleased of the phishing email he received is consistent with what we have seen, although we have not been able to verify his\nclaims. In addition, a number of phishing domains with Ecuadorian and Venezuelan targeting that we identified became active during\nthis period.\n\n**2015**\n2015 seems to have marked an extensive campaign of phishing and malware attacks targeting civil society and public figures,\nincluding parliamentarians in Ecuador. We observed a range of phishing domains and attacks, often using fake organizations during\nthis period. We also found fake organizations and possible disinformation campaigns with targets in Ecuador, Venezuela and the\nVenezuelan diaspora.\n\n### 1.1 Nisman and the Argentine Cases\n\n[In January 2015, controversial Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found dead of a gunshot under suspicious circumstances.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/07/world/americas/argentina-alberto-nisman-case.html?_r=0)\nArgentine news reported that a malicious file was found on his Android phone by the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police forensic lab.\nThe [file was named “estrictamente secreto y confidencial.pdf.jar,” or “strictly secret and confidential” in English.](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/21/inside-the-spyware-campaign-against-argentine-troublemakers-including-alberto-nisman/)\n\nAn [identically titled file was uploaded to VirusTotal from Argentina on the 29th of May, 2015. The file was a remote access toolkit,](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/aa9aa05af8df2cc99eb936e2d17623a68abdbb60606bb097379457c4a3760116/analysis/)\nknown as AlienSpy, which allowed an attacker the ability to record the activities of a target, access their email, their webcam, and\nmore. However, the file was built for the Windows operating system, and could not have infected Nisman’s Android phone.\n\nThe [initial analysis of the alienspy implant by Morgan Marquis–Boire revealed the command and control server of the attackers to be](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/21/inside-the-spyware-campaign-against-argentine-troublemakers-including-alberto-nisman/)\n**deyrep24.ddns.net. In addition to the malware apparently used to target Nisman, Lanata, and Kirchner (see below), three other**\nsamples[1] were found which used deyrep24.ddns.net as a command and control domain. One of these, 3 MAR PROYECTO\n**GRIPEN.docx.jar, was a build of AlienSpy (See Packrat’s Implants) which masqueraded as a document containing communication**\nbetween Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Ecuador’s Ambassador to Sweden concerning the acquisition of fighter jets.\n\nAfter [the finding was made public, other targets came forward. Prominent investigative journalist and television host Jorge Lanata](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/21/inside-the-spyware-campaign-against-argentine-troublemakers-including-alberto-nisman/)\n[revealed that he too had been targeted by the same malware. The president’s son, Maximo Kirchner, also](http://pastebin.com/iiAGSMYc) [claimed to have been](http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/196727/an%C3%ADbal-m%C3%A1ximo-kirchner-received-same-virus-as-lanata)\n[targeted. We were unable to verify Kirchner’s claim, however, a screenshot showing his targeting was included in a report of this](http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=803749)\nclaim:\n\n[Image 3: A screenshot included in this report showing Maximo Kirchner’s targeting](http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=803749)\nThe email which he claims to have received has an attachment named “Estrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf.jar” (size 67.3kb)\nwhich is the same as the malware sent to Nisman and Lanata. Additionally, the sender’s email address\n[(claudiobonadio88@gmail.com) purports to be well-known judge Claudio Bonadio. This similar to the targeting of Lanata, who also](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:claudiobonadio88@gmail.com)\n[received an email also claiming to be from Claudio Bonadio (cfed.bonadio@gmail.com).](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:cfed.bonadio@gmail.com)\n\n### 1.2 Ecuadorian Campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2015, we began independently receiving a growing number of reports of phishing attacks via e mail and SMS targeting journalists\nand other public figures in Ecuador. Some emails we examined had no political content, but were simple credential phishing for\nsocial media and email providers, like Gmail. Others, however, had explicit political content concerning a range of political figures\nand issues in Ecuador. Further investigation revealed an extensive campaign, as well as many fake organizations (See Section 6:\n**Possible Deception Operations).**\n\nOne of the authors developed a Gmail search query for strings associated with the attacks (See Appendix A: The Search Query).\nWe shared this query with many potential targets, resulting in hits for phishing attacks, as well as suspicious Microsoft Word (DOCX)\nfiles sent to a range of journalists and public figures. These documents contained embedded RATs written in Java, including Adzok\nand AlienSpy (See Packrat’s Implants). Subsequently, using indicators found in the JAR files, as well as an updated Gmail query\nwe were able to identify a larger set of malicious files and domains used by Packrat (See Appendix B: Malware Samples).\n\nWe found a dense web of interconnections between phishing and malware sites. Sites often shared registration information, or were\nhosted from the same servers. We determined that the malware samples typically communicated with daynews.sytes.net, which is\nlinked to the Argentine cases. Ultimately, investigation of this infrastructure also revealed malware and infrastructure in Brazil, and\nfake sites in Venezuela.\n\n### 1.3 Shared Command & Control Infrastructure\n\nThis section describes Packrat’s command and control infrastructure in narrative form, Appendix B provides a full list of Command &\nControl domains along with the related binaries and malware families.\n\nPackrat’s deyrep24.ddns.net domain was created on November 7th, 2014, and at the time of Nisman’s targeting, pointed to the IP\naddress: 50.62.133.49. This IP address belongs to a GoDaddy range for dedicated hosting, and on March 3rd, 2015, the domain\nmoved to another GoDaddy IP: 192.169.243.65. Passive DNS records revealed that at the same time as this IP was being used by\nthe deyrep24.ddns.net command and control domain, it was being used by the domain daynews.sytes.net which had been\ncreated on March 1st, 2015. Over the course of our joint investigation we found 5 samples of malware using this domain which were\nused to target journalists and civil society in Ecuador (See Appendix D: Seeding Domains for a larger list).\n\n**Packrat’s Command & Control Infrastructure**\n\nImage 4: Packrat’s Command and Control infrastructure [Click image for hires]Searching for domains related to daynews.sytes.net\nlead us to taskmgr.serveftp.com which on the August 11th, 2014 was at the IP address 190.210.180.181, an IP address in\nArgentina, used by daynews.sytes.net for a brief period when it was first registered, before being quickly moved to GoDaddy\nhosting. The taskmgr.serveftp.com domain also returns to 190.210.180.181 on multiple dates in October of 2014, and May of 2015.\nOn July 23rd, 2014, taskmgr.serveftp.com was hosted at 201.52.24.126, a Brazillian IP address, which was also hosting\n**taskmgr.servehttp.com, and taskmgr.redirectme.com. We found a total of 15 malware samples using either**\n**taskmgr.servehttp.com or taskmgr.serveftp.com as command and control domains (or both in the case of several samples). The**\nearliest of these samples had a compile time of December 24th, 2008, providing us with the earliest date we know of that Packrat\nwas active. While it is possible that this timestamp is faked, we have seen no evidence of this on other samples by these attackers.\n\n**Packrat’s Command and Control Infrastructure**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain** **Relevant Resolution** **Relevant Date of resolution**\n\ndeyrep24.ddns.net 50.62.133.49 November 7th, 2014\n\n192.169.243.65 March 3rd, 2015\n\ndaynews.sytes.net 192.169.243.65 March 3rd, 2015\n\n190.20.180.181 March 1st, 2015\n\ntaskmgr.serveftp.com 190.210.180.181 August 11th, 2014\n\n201.52.24.126 July 23rd, 2014\n\n186.220.1.84 July 11th, 2014\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com 186.220.1.84 June 24th, 2014\n\n201.52.24.126 July 23rd, 2014\n\n186.220.1.84 July 11th, 2014\n\n186.220.11.67 August 15th, 2014\n\ntaskmgr.redirectme.com 201.52.24.126 July 23rd, 2014\n\n186.220.1.84 July 11th, 2014\n\nruley.no-ip.org 186.220.1.84 July 11th, 2014\n\n189.100.148.188 September 6th, 2012\n\nlolinha.no-ip.org 189.100.148.188 September 6th, 2012\n\nwjwj.no-ip.org 189.100.148.188 September 6th, 2012\n\nconhost.servehttp.com 186.220.11.67 August 15th, 2014\n\ndllhost.servehttp.com 186.220.11.67 August 15th, 2014\n\nwjwjwj.no-ip.org 179.208.187.216 March 25th, 2014\n\n186.220.1.84 June 24th, 2014\n\nwjwjwjwj.no-ip.org 179.208.187.216 March 25th, 2014\n\nOn July 11th 2014, all ‘taskmgr’ domains were hosted on 186.220.1.84, an IP address in Brazil. At the same time, this IP address\nwas hosting ruley.no-ip.org. We managed to find a malware sample[2] using both ruley.no-ip.org and taskmgr.servehttp.com as\ncommand and control domains. On September 6th, 2012, ruley.no-ip.org was hosted at 189.100.148.188, another Brazillian IP\naddress, along with two other domains lolinha.no-ip.org and wjwj.no-ip.org. We found two samples configured with all three of\nthese domains as command and control servers, three samples which used both ruley.no-ip.org and wjwj.no-ip.org, two samples\njust using wjwj.no-ip.org, and one sample just using ruley.no-ip.org. On August 15th, 2014, taskmgr.servehttp.com was hosted\non 186.220.11.67, another IP address in Brazil. On the same date, this IP hosted both conhost.servehttp.com and\n**dllhost.servehttp.com. We found two samples configured with both conhost.servehttp.com and dllhost.servehttp.com as**\ncommand and control servers.\n\nIn addition to these domains, the domains wjwjwj.no-ip.org and wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org appear to be related. On March 25th, 2014\nboth wjwj.no-ip.org and wjwjwj.no-ip.org point to 179.208.187.216. On June 24th, 2014, both taskmgr.servehttp.com and\n**wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org pointed to 186.220.1.84. We didn’t manage to find malware samples related to either wjwjwj.no-ip.org or**\n**wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org.**\n\nThe command and control servers behind these domains were hosted with a variety of providers around Latin America, including:\nUruguay Montevideo Administración Nacional De Telecomunicaciones, Argentina Buenos Aires Nss S.A. (IPLAN), and Claro Brazil.\n\nPackrat has also used servers in Europe and the US, including Portlane AB in Sweden and GoDaddy in the United States.\n\nWe have notified hosting providers in order to facilitate the shutdown of Packrat’s infrastructure.\n\n## Part 2: Recent Malware Attacks in Ecuador\n\n\n-----\n\nPackrat is active in many countries, but it is in Ecuador that we were able to gather the most systematic evidence of their activities,\nas well as connect directly with targets and victims. We are also tracking active attacks against Ecuadorian targets at the time of\nwriting.\n\nImage 5: Some of Packrat’s known target groups in Ecuador\nUsing email inbox search queries that we shared with potential targets (See: Appendix A), as well as analysis of malware databases\nand seeding infrastructure, we collected a diverse set of malware and phishing attacks targeting journalists, public figures, politicians,\nand other prominent individuals (see: 5. Packrat’s Persistent Phishing Campaigns for examples).\n\n### 2.1 Previous Reports of Packrat Malware in Ecuador\n\nThere are public reports, as well as social media mentions, that point to politically-linked malware attacks Ecuador by Packrat. For\n[example, Ecuadorian freedom of expression organization Fundamedios reported that public figures, satirical news organizations, the](http://www.fundamedios.org/alertas/periodistas-y-activistas-sufren-repetidos-intentos-de-hackeo/)\ndirector of Fundamedios, and others, had received suspicious messages and phishing attempts. Fundamedios later updated their\nreporting to note that [Access Now had stated that some of these attacks shared command and control infrastructure with the](https://www.accessnow.org/)\nmalware that was reportedly used to target Nisman. There are also indications on Twitter of phishing attacks and malware. We have\nbeen able to link many of these reports to Packrat.\n\n### 2.2 Common Techniques\n\nWe observed a range of social engineering techniques used to send malware to Ecuadorian targets. In the cases where we\nobserved seeding, we found that the malware was often accompanied by political bait content, frequently relevant to Ecuador’s\nopposition. In other cases, the seeding was personalized to the intended victim. The most common delivery mechanism was via\nMicrosoft Word DOCX files containing malicious Java. However, in other cases, attackers used fake updates.\n\n**Common Seeding Techniques**\n\nEmailed as attached malicious files\nAs links to malware hosted on sites controlled by the attackers\nOn Google Drive or Onedrive\nPopups or fake update notifications on politically themed / lookalike sites\n\nPackrat often uses email senders and websites in its social engineering that appear similar to real persons and organizations. For\nexample, they registered ecuadorenvivo.co, which looks like the genuine domain of the Ecuador En Vivo news website\n(ecuadorenvivo.com). Packrat then sent e-mails purporting to be e-mail news updates (a practice by the real Ecuador En Vivo) from\nthe ecuadorenvivo.co domain.\n\nPackrat also sometimes creates identical paths to real news stories, and hides them under clickable links. For example:\n\n**Typical Lookalike Domain**\n\n**What the target sees:**\n\nhttp://ecuadorenvivo.com/videos/el-meme-que-volvio-loco-a-correa.html\n\n**HREF of the actual malicious link:**\n\nhttp://ecuadorenvivo.co/videos/el-meme-que-volvio-loco-a-correa.html\n\n### 2.3 Three Attacks in Detail\n\nTo illustrate Packrat’s approach, this section describes three recent attacks in detail. The attacks date from between Spring and Fall\n2015. Targets of these attacks include Ecuadorian journalists and public figures.\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.3.1 Attack 1: Email from a fake opposition movement**\n\nThroughout April 2015, multiple targets received e-mails from the “Movimento Anti Correista” (English: “Anti Correa Movement”), a\nfictitious group (based on open source searches and consultation with individuals familiar with the region) that purports to be\nopponents of Ecuador’s current president, Rafael Correa. The emails contained a Microsoft Word DOCX attachment containing\nAdzok malware (See: Section 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants), as well as text and graphics to bolster the fiction.\n\n**Example Seeding E-mail from “Movimento Anti Correista”**\n\nImage 6: Example Seeding E-mail from “Movimento Anti Correista”\n**Seeding text translation:**\n\n**Subject: Foul Play by Rafael Correa Against the Opposition**\n\n**Body:**\n\nWe are sharing with you this leaked document about President Rafael Correa’s dirty tricks against the opposition\n\n(Open on a PC, this cannot be read on a phone.)Coming soon more leaks on: www[.]movimientoanticorreista.com\n\nThe e-mail seems intended for several purposes. It is obviously designed to trick the target into downloading and viewing the\ndocument, but it also seems to be an effort to establish the legitimacy of the domain, and the identity of the movement.\n\n**The Malicious Attachment**\n\nName La jugada sucia De Correa ante la oposición.ppt\n\nType: Microsoft Word Document file (.docx)\n\nMD5: ea7bcf58a4ccdecb0c64e56b9998a4ac\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 7: Seeding email with text\n[Embedded in this document is software called “Adzok – Invisible Remote Administrator.” Analysis of the malware can be found in](http://adzok.com/)\n**Section 3: The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants and the configuration of this implant can be found in Appendix C: Malware**\n**Configuration.**\n\n**2.3.2 Attack 2: You are being spied on!**\n\nThis attack is designed to create a sense of fear and concern in the target, leading to the file being opened. The e-mail is customized\nfor the target’s name, and claims that the target is being spied on by SENAIN, Ecuador’s National Intelligence Secretariat. The\nattachment purports to be a list of Twitter users spied on by SENAIN. Interestingly, the purported sender is “Guillermo Lasso,” the\ndefeated challenger in Ecuador’s last presidential election.\n\nImage 8: Email with the purported sender as “Guillermo Lasso,” the defeated challenger in Ecuador’s last presidential election\n**Seeding text translation:**\n\n**Subject: [Target’s Name] spied on by SENAIN**\n\n**Body:**\n\nGreetings,G.L\n\nNote: Open this on your personal computer. It can’t be opened by smartphones.\n\nLike Attack 1, the malware is not delivered with an exploit, but rather requires that the victim double clicks on the file and accepts\nany prompts before executing it.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The document instructs the target to click:**\n\nImage 9: Document instructing the target to click\n**English Translation**\n\n**In English: TO READ ALL THE TWEETS DOUBLE CLICK ON THE GRAPHIC OF TWITTER**\n\nWhen the image is double clicked, the victim is infected with malware from the AlienSpy family. Examining the configuration file of the\nmalware reveals that the malware uses the the C2 server daynews.sytes.net, which is a domain common to several Packrat attacks.\nInterestingly, we found that the same document (identical MD5) was re-purposed for several other attacks.\n\n**File Name** **MD5**\n\nLOS TUITEROS ESPIADOS POR SENAIN.docx efc0009d76a2057f86c5f00030378c72\n\nLos trinos de Rafael Correa.docx efc0009d76a2057f86c5f00030378c72\n\nDetailed analysis of the malware can be found in Section 3 and the configuration of this implant can be found in Appendix C.\n\n**2.3.3 Attack 3: “Exclusive Information about Correa’s Lies”**\n\nThis attack was served via a link to a fake political website hosting malicious content. The e-mail served to direct the victim to the\nsite. Interestingly, the attack attempts to trick the target into believing that it originates from the legitimate investigative journalism site\n[Focus Ecuador.

It appears that the attackers were hoping to gain additional information about their targets, such as\npossibly de-anonymizing the IP addresses of targets who might be reluctant to open files.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe focusecuador.tk lookalike website contained content scraped from the legitimate site, but also showed victims a Flash update\nnotification.

This kind of engagement could be considered a](http://blog.9bplus.com/operators-have-feelings-too/)\nserious breach of operational security. Packrat took exception to these unwritten rules. It may be that Packrat has experienced other\ncases of individuals touching their infrastructure, or attempting to analyze their files, especially after some of their infrastructure was\nexposed. Since Packrat prefers to leave the infrastructure online, they may be trying to discourage unwelcome attention.\n\n## 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants\n\nOver the past seven years Packrat has used several different types of malware, much of it off-the-shelf RATs, such as Cybergate,\nXtreme, AlienSpy, and Adzok. While these malware families are known to researchers, Packrat typically obfuscates their malware\nusing a range of tools, including: an unknown VB6 crypter, AutoIt3Wrapper, UPX, PECompact, PEtite, and Allatori Obfuscator. This\nlayer of obfuscation means that Packrat’s attacks frequently escaped detection by antivirus when the attacks were deployed. This\nsection describes these tools, roughly grouped into distinct time periods.\n\nImage 12: Packrat malware families\n\n### 3.1. 2008-2014: Packed RATS, mostly CyberGate\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, Packrat made extensive use of off-the-shelf RATs encapsulated in AutoIt3Wrapper, a runtime packer. This\npacker is written in AutoIt, a compilable scripting language for automating tasks in Windows. The use of an initial obfuscation layer\nseems to have been enough to thwart or at least misguide detection, as well as leverage some basic anti-debugging techniques.\n\nThe majority of implants that are then dropped and executed appear to be CyberGate RAT. In 2013 and 2014, Packrat seems to\n[have adopted XtremeRAT as well. Cybergate and Xtreme are both written in Delphi and share code with each other and other Delphi](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/02/xtremerat-nuisance-or-threat.html)\nbased RATs, SpyNet and Cerberus.\n\nMany of these attacks included embedded decoy Office documents that are opened at execution of the implant, likely in the context\nof a targeted attack. Among the documents we found are résumés of purported Brazilian citizens, as well as purported payment\nreceipts of the Association of Lawyers of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 13: A résumé\nThese attacks suggest that Packrat had Portuguese speaking targets during this period. Based on the specifics of the bait\ndocuments, it seems likely that they were Brazilian.\n\nImage 14: Payment receipt\nThe majority of the implants we found were configured to beacon back to a Command & Control, taskmgr.servehttp.com, although a\nfew others include ruley.no-ip.org, lolinha.no-ip.org, and taskmgr.serveftp.com (See Appendix B for a complete list).\n\n**3.1.1 Analysis of CyberGate RAT**\n\nThe CyberGate RAT samples we analyzed were, as mentioned above, typically wrapped in a layer of AutoIt. Code and strings found\nin the binary indicate that it is based on the Spy-Net RAT version 2.6. This RAT was developed by a Brazilian hacker using the\nhandle spynetcoder and is outlined on the Spy-Net RAT [‘official’ website.](http://spynet-rat-officiel.blogspot.com/)\n\n**CyberGate’s Infection Routine**\n\nAfter unpacking from the applied runtime packer, CyberGate runs its second stage, which is likeley the infection routine. This injects\nthe third stage, a DLL, into a running process. Once implanted, CyberGate then deploys a range of techniques for persistence and\nmonitoring.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third stage module picks from three execution paths (based on mutexes, which can also be set by a prior infection):\n\nPassword gathering (mutex: “_x_X_PASSWORDLIST_X_x_”)\nBlock mouse and keyboard input to any other application (mutex: “_x_X_BLOCKMOUSE_X_x_”)\nInfection routine\n\n**CyberGate Anti Analysis**\nThe infection routine comes with a set of anti-analysis features packaged in a single function. CyberGate searches for a range of\nvirtual and sandbox environments.[3] It also checks for user space debuggers through the IsDebuggerPresent API, and for SoftICE\nand Syser through their respective pipes. The malware performs breakpoint detection on the function entries of the listed antianalysis features by checking whether the first byte of each function equals ‘CC’, the bytecode indicating a breakpoint.\n\nImage 15: CyberGate Anti Analysis\n**CyberGate Process Injection**\nThe infection routine fetches the encrypted implant from the resource section, and upon decryption attempts to inject its implant into\nthe Windows system shell process (explorer.exe). If this fails, CyberGate launches an explorer.exe process on its own, injects its\nimplant into it, and then completes the setup. Additionally, another instance of the CyberGate implant is injected into a default\nbrowser process, which runs invisibly.\n\nThe infection routine drops a copy of itself into different directories, depending on the Windows version: /System, /Windows, or\n/Program Files. The implant’s name varies: taskhost.exe, regedit.exe, or taskmgr.exe are all common. The infection routine also\nwrites a copy of the encrypted implant into the %TEMP% directory and names it XX–XX–XX.txt.\n\nTo achieve persistence, the second stage writes registry keys so that CyberGate is run at startup:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Active Setup\\Installed Components\\%GUID%\\StubPath: “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\policies\\Explorer\\Run\\Policies: “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\msconfig: “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”\n\n**Password Collection**\nIf tasked with password collection, the second stage binary grabs passwords from a range of locations, including: the No-ip Dynamic\nUpdate Client (DUC), MSN messenger, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. The credentials are collected from the Windows Registry,\nbrowser profiles, the RAS dial up settings, Local Security Authority (LSA) settings, MS ProtectedStorage, MS IntelliForms, and the\ncredential store.\n\n**CyberGate’s Functionality**\nThe CyberGate implant runs two instances. The first runs in the default browser process, and acts as the monitoring component.\nMeanwhile, the explorer.exe instance serves as ‘watchdog,’ ensuring persistence and making sure the infector binary on disk doesn’t\ndisappear.\n\nImage 16: Searching for indicators of an existing Spy-Net installation\nThe CyberGate implant comes with the same credential stealing capabilities as the infector, and is extended by routines to spy on\nChrome and STEAM credentials as well. Also inherited from the infector, the implant owns the same anti-analysis routine protecting\nit from sandboxes and debuggers.\n\nBeyond the capabilities seen in the infector, CyberGate has a range of features that provide an attacker with a full spectrum of\nmonitoring and remote control functionality.\n\nCyberGate capabilities include:\n\n\n-----\n\nCollecting detailed information about the infected system\nActivation and control of the webcam and microphone\nScreenshot capture\nBlocking user input (e.g. keyboard and mouse)\nControl over processes, windows, applications, devices, drive, ports, TCP & UDP connections, the clipboard, registry keys and\nvalues etc.\nControl over the filesystem\nDownload and execution of further binaries\nExfiltration via FTP\nCollection of information on installed security products\n\nInterestingly, CyberGate gathers information on installed security products through the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)\nby launching cscript.exe on a hardcoded .vbs-script. The script requests name and version number of installed antivirus and firewall\nsolutions and dumps the data to a file:\n\nSet objSecurityCenter = GetObject(“winmgmts:.rootSecurityCenter”)\nSet colFirewall = objSecurityCenter.ExecQuery(“Select * From FirewallProduct”,,48)\nSet colAntiVirus = objSecurityCenter.ExecQuery(“Select * From AntiVirusProduct”,,48)\nSet objFileSystem = CreateObject(“Scripting.fileSystemObject”)\nSet objFile = objFileSystem.CreateTextFile(“%FILEPATH%”, True)\nEnter = Chr(13) + Chr(10)\nCountFW = 0\nCountAV = 0For Each objFirewall In colFirewall\nCountFW = CountFW + 1\nInfo = Info & “F” & CountFw & “) ” & objFirewall.displayName & ” v” & objFirewall.versionNumber &\nEnter\nNextFor Each objAntiVirus In colAntiVirus\nCountAV = CountAV + 1\nInfo = Info & “A” & CountAV & “) ” & objAntiVirus.displayName & ” v” & objAntiVirus.versionNumber &\nEnterobjFile.WriteLine(Info)\nobjFile.Close\n\nCollected data is stored in dump files on disk and exfiltrated to the remote server component by HTTP or FTP.\n\n**3.1.2 Analysis of XTremeRAT**\n\nXTremeRAT is commercial off-the-shelf malware, often available cracked, and used to monitor victim machines. While used by\n[apolitical hackers, XTremeRAT has been extensively used by government-linked malware groups to target the opposition during the](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-marczak.pdf)\nongoing Syrian Civil War, as well as by [other politically-motivated groups in the Middle East and North Africa. It has also been](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/06/molerats-here-for-spring.html)\n[extensively](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/malicious/xtremerat-unicode-breaks-35897) [analyzed, and we encourage interested readers to review some of these analyses.](https://malware.lu/articles/2012/07/22/xtreme-rat-analysis.html)\n\nWhile often packed, XTreme RAT itself has limited stealth and persistence functionality. Its monitoring capabilities are also\nstraightforward. The versions we analyze here have no code obfuscation. XTreme Rat is implemented as client/server architecture,\nwhere the infected machine acts as server, while the C&C component is the client.\n\n**This version of Xtreme Rat’s capabilities include:**\n\nLogging keystrokes\nLogging the name of the foreground desktop application\nSniffing the clipboard for passwords\nDownloading and executing binaries via HTTP, presumably to install second stage malware\n\nImage 17: Installation of the XTreme RAT keylogger module\n\n\n-----\n\n**Xtreme RAT operation and keylogging functionality**\nThe Xtreme RAT implant sniffs the clipboard contents via the keylogger window, using a clipboard viewer that it also installs. The\nviewer receives the window message WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD every time the clipboard changes, and provides access to Clipboard\ncontents. Clipboard and keylogger data is dumped to a .dat-file that, along with the configuration file (.cfg), is located in the\n\n[…]\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows folder for the current user. Both filenames are dictated by XTreme RAT’s configuration.\n\n**XTreme RAT data files**\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows\\RJokLSZBj.cfg\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows\\RJokLSZBj.dat\n\nThe dump file is exfiltrated via push to FTP. XTreme RAT comes with preconfigured FTP server credential placeholders\n(ftpuser/ftppass) to log on to ftp.ftpserver.com, which are then switched for updated values received from the C&C at runtime.\n\nThe XTreme RAT implant also creates a mutex named following the same naming scheme as configuration and dump file (e.g.\n“RJokLSZBjPERSIST”). The RAT’s configuration is fetched from the .rsrc-section and encrypted using RC4, with the key “CONFIG”.\n[The same algorithm and key combination has been seen in use before in](https://malware.lu/articles/2012/07/22/xtreme-rat-analysis.html) [other variants of XTreme RAT.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/02/xtremerat-nuisance-or-threat.html)\n\nThis variant of XTreme RAT uses explorer.exe as a container for remote threads to carry out specific functions. Thread injection can\nhappen on at least three occasions.\n\nPossible injections of explorer.exe by XTreme RAT:\n\n**A ‘watchdog’ thread to restore persistence keys, and to locate and run the infector binary. To increase stealth, the dropping**\nmodule changes the timestamp of the dropped infector.\nA thread for deleting of XTreme RAT’s files on disk\n**The entire keylogging code and FTP push functionality**\n\n### 3.2: 2014- 2015 AlienSpy Dominates\n\nOver the past two years, Packrat has been using an evolving family of off-the-shelf malware known as AlienSpy. The software began\n[as the free RAT “Frutas,” and was](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/cross-platform-frutas-rat-builder-and-back-door) [identified in 2013 during a campaign in Mexico. This was subsequently adapted for commercial](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/targeted-attacks-delivering-fruit)\nsale as the “Premium RAT” [Adwind. Adwind could be purchased for $75 for a single license, and up to $250 for multiple licenses.](https://web.archive.org/web/20130213044621/http:/adwind.com.mx/)\n[Then, by 2013, AdWind was renamed UNRECOM (UNiversal REmote COntrol Multi-platform), and was detected in targeted attacks](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/adwind-rat-rebranding/)\nin the Middle East.\n\n[The software was most recently branded “AlienSpy,” and was again](http://www.fidelissecurity.com/sites/default/files/FTA_1015_Alienspy_FINAL.pdf) [found by security researchers in targeted spying operations. At](http://contagiodump.blogspot.ch/2014/11/alienspy-java-rat-samples-and-traffic.html)\nthe time of this report, the latest re-packaging of this RAT is known as [JSocket. For the purposes of this report, we’ll refer to all](https://jsocket.org/)\nvariants of this spyware as “AlienSpy.” AlienSpy is a relatively full-featured RAT with a range of features, such as recording the\nvictim’s keystrokes, audio eavesdropping via a device’s built-in microphone, remote viewing of the desktop, and the ability to turn on\na victim’s webcam “without user notification.” Alienspy has been extensively analyzed by malware researchers, including reports by\n[ProofPoint and Fidelis.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/You-Dirty-RAT)\n\n**3.2.1 Packrat’s Alienspy Deployment**\n\nFrom 2014 to early 2015, Packrat’s preferred technique was to send AlienSpy implants as attachments in phishing emails with the\nextension ‘.pdf.jar.’ The default setting in Windows is to hide file extensions, thus making it appear to be a “.pdf” file. With some minor\ndifferences, all the samples from this time period are built in a similar manner. There’s an outer .jar (Java archive) file containing a\nfolder named META-INF and two files: Favicon.ico and Principal.class. Upon execution, Principal.class unzips the contents of\n“Favicon.ico” (not an icon file, but a .zip archive), and looks for a filename containing “.jar”.\n\n**Contents of Favicon.ico**\n\n0doc.jar\n\n1Estrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf\n\nOnce it finds the right file (in this case 0doc.jar), it drops it to a randomly-named temp file starting with a constant string and invokes\nJava to run it.\n\n**Inside the .jar file from “Favicon.ico”**\n\nMETA-INF/MANIFEST.MF\n\nMANIFEST.MF\n\nID\n\n\n-----\n\nplugins/Server.class\nMain.class\nEstrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf\n\n[“Main.class” is obfuscated using Allatori, a Russian-origin JVM obfuscator used by AlienSpy.](http://www.allatori.com/)\n\nThis reads part of an RC4 key from the file “ID.” To this it appends a constant string, then uses the full RC4 key to decrypt the\ncontents of MANIFEST.MF, which yields the actual Adwind implant JAR file. Others have written about the operation and\n[deobfuscation of Allatori, including how to deobfuscate it, here,](https://boredliner.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/cracking-obfuscated-java-code-adwind-3/) [here, and](https://www.moparscape.org/smf/index.php?topic=238584.0) [here.](https://github.com/kevthehermit/RATDecoders)\n\n**AlienSpy in MS Office Documents**\nIn 2015, Packrat started sending AlienSpy implants embedded in .docx files. The method used to obfuscate these files is more\ncomplex, but ultimately similar to previous techniques. Uncompressing an infected MS Word document reveals a file named\n“oleObject1.bin” under the directories word/embeddings. Opening this file, which is a jar, reveals:\n\na\nabcdefghijka.class\nabcdefghijkf.class\nabcdefghijkj.class\nabcdefghijks.class\nabcdefghijku.class\nabcdefghijkz.class\na.txt\nb.txt\nc.dat\nkjmhs\nMain.class\nMETA-INF\n\nSimilar to the obfuscation described above in Packrat’s earlier uses of AlienSpy, half the decryption key is in a.txt. The other half is a\nstring which is decrypted iteratively by the abcdefghijk[a,f,j,s,u,z].class files with the method and class names from the caller.\n\nPersistence is achieved by adding the following registry value:\n\n“reg.exe” (Access type: “SETVAL”, Path:\n“\\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\WINDOWS\\CURRENTVERSION\\RUN”, Key: “JAVASE”, Value:\n“”C:\\Users\\PSPUBWS\\Cas436FlashJava\\RoUndCuBe\\bin\\javaw.exe” -jar\n“C:\\Users\\PSPUBWS\\Cas436FlashJava\\Cas436FlashJava\\Cas934FlashJava.\n\n**3.2.2 Adzok makes an appearance**\n\nBetween 2014-2015, Packrat also used Adzok – Invisible Remote Administrator. Similar to AlienSpy in functionality, the java-based\nAdzok is apparently from Bolivia. The premium version costs $990, but it appears that Packrat is using the “free” version. This\nversion of Adzok does not use obfuscation, which makes it possible to simply uncompress the jar files within the docx and read the\nclear-text configuration file. Given the obfuscated nature of the other RATs that Packrat has used, their use of Adzok is surprising. It\nis possible that they were having stability, compatibility, or detection problems with other RATs and that Adzok served a specific\nrequirement.\n\n## 4. Packrat’s Persistent Phishing Campaigns\n\nPackrat is active in phishing, often against the same groups and individuals whom they target with malware. For example, when\nexamining one target of malware attacks, we found this individual had been targeted by dozens of phishing attempts by Packrat\nduring the same period. The same domains and fake identities that Packrat uses to seed malware are also used to serve phishing,\nalthough Packrat also maintains dedicated phishing sites and servers. While phishing e-mails appeared to be regularly sent, we also\nobserved particular cases of the phishing apparently sent to targets in response to contacts they made during our investigation.\n\nWe have been able to achieve the most systematic visibility of Packrat’s campaign against Ecuadorian targets, but have found\nevidence of targeting in neighboring countries including Venezuela. Packrat uses both e-mails and social media messages, as well\nas SMSes to send phishing messages.\n\nThis section describes these phishing campaigns, and describes both Politically-Themed and Non-Politically Themed phishing\nattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Category** **Example Domain** **Note**\n\nPolitics & News lavozamericana.info Fake news website\n\nGovernmental – Ecuador asambleanacional-gob-ec.cu9.co Lookalike to the Ecuadorian National Assembly’s e-mail login\n\nPolitical Movement – Ecuador movimientoanticorreista.com Fake political movement\n\nFree E-mail mgoogle.us Fake Google login\n\n### 4.1 Non-Politically Themed Phishing Content\n\nOne of the most common phishing techniques is lookalike communications from popular webmail and social media sites containing\nrequests for password verification, notifications of unauthorized logins, and so on. Packrat uses a wide range of templates for the\nmajor email providers, including Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail. A majority of the e-mails are in Spanish. The messages are typically\npersonalized to the targets, including both their names and e-mail addresses.\n\nImage 18: Example phishing email\n**Translated Message**\n\n**From: Gmail Team no.response.delivery.es@gmail.com**\n\n**Subject: [Victim Name], you have a pending warning !**\n\n**To: [victim email]**\n\n[Victim email],\n\n[Victim Name]for security reasons we request that you verify your account below.\n\nTo ensure proper use of your account, we request that you verify it.\n\nClick here to verify your account.\n\nDepending on the attack, the phishing either contains a direct link to the phishing URL, or uses a shortener.\n\n**4.1.1 Most Recent Non-Political Phishing**\n\nRecently, the attackers appear to have slightly varied their technique. We have observed them making extensive use of tinyurl as a\nshortener, as well as moving their phishing pages to the free host cu9.co. The attackers may have concluded that using a free\nprovider reduced costs and increased flexibility.\n\n**Example recent phishing URL and shortener:**\n\ntinyurl.com/nww83ov Yields: main-latam-soporte-widget-local.cu9[dot]co\n\n**4.1.2 Example Non-Political Phishing SMSes**\n\nA number of Packrat’s targets also received phishing SMSes. The SMSes often use similar language to the phishing e-mails, and in\nsome cases use the same shortened URL. In other cases, the attackers push harder, warning the targeted user that their accounts\nwill be terminated if they fail to follow the link. In at least one case we observed that the messages contained improperly formatted email addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 19: Example of non political phishing\n\n### 4.2 Politically Themed Phishing\n\nWe observed a wide range of e-mails and messages that contained content with political overtones. Packrat takes two basic\napproaches in the attacks we have examined. First approach: create fake political and media organizations. Second approach:\n**impersonate well-known groups and high-profile individuals. Attacks typically took the form of messages and e-mails containing**\ninformation either in ‘solidarity,’ upsetting information, or other relevant news. A majority of what we observed seemed to be crafted\nto appeal to opposition elements.\n\nWhile much of the phishing seems to mimic common free webmail and social media sites, in specific cases, Packrat mimicked e-mail\nservices of high-profile targets, like the Ecuadorian National Assembly.\n\n**4.2.1 Targeting Ecuadorian Parliamentarians**\n\nA group we believe to be Packrat has operated a phishing campaign that mimics the Ecuadorian national assembly’s webmail portal.\nThis malicious site prompts the target(s) to enter their email credentials, which are captured via formmail, a technique seen\nrepeatedly in the phishing pages we identified (see below).\n\nasambleanacional-gob-ec.cu9.co\n\nThe legitimate domain is:\n\nhttp://mail.asambleanacional.gob.ec/\n\n**4.2.2 A Typical Credential Harvesting Page**\n\nWhatever the bait, the links on the messages typically lead victims (often via a shortener) to a lookalike domain for a free email\nprovider. During the summer of 2015, a frequently observed domain was a lookalike for Google, although there have been many\nothers:\n\nmgoogle.us\n\nWhile the attacks were active, mgoogle.us hosted a Spanish-language lookalike Google login.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 20: mgoogle.us hosted a Spanish-language lookalike Google login\nOnce a victim’s credentials are entered, they are shown a Spanish language note “confirming” that their gmail has been “unblocked”\nand thanking the victim for “choosing us.”\n\nImage 21: A Spanish language note “confirming” that their Gmail has been “unblocked”\nIn other cases, Packrat sends “confirmation” emails to the original victim, congratulating them on “successfully” verifying their\naccount after credentials are entered. In specific cases, we found that this e-mail arrived several hours before phished accounts\nwere accessed.\n\nWhile the phishing has used different tools to harvest credentials, we find that Packrat makes repeated use of the legitimate online\nwebsite form service formmail.com to receive phished credentials. Formmail is a legitimate HTML-based form processor that\nreceives the contents of data entered into forms, then sends them to an e-mail address.\n\n### 4.3 A Sample of Phishing & Malware Seeding Sites\n\nThe attackers control a range of domains that they use to serve both phishing and malware. This section outlines elements of this\ninfrastructure. A more complete list is in Appendix D, but we describe certain domains of interest here. The phishing page\nmgoogle.us, for example, has resolved to a range of IPs, including:\n\n**IP** **First Seen** **Last Seen** **WHOIS**\n\n198.12.150.249 5/19/2015 6:16:00 9/4/2015 9:51:00 Godaddy\n\n50.63.202.57 9/4/2015 12:52:00 10/8/2015 21:44:00 Godaddy\n\nOf these IPs, the first (198.12.150.249) is particularly interesting. We find that the same IP was used to host a range of other suspect\ndomains with similar themes. For a full list of associated domains, see Appendix D. While some of these domains are lookalikes for\nlogins, or update pages (e.g. sopporte-gmail.com or login-office365.com) others seem to have a more political angle.\n\n**WHOIS**\n\n\n-----\n\nName Pedro Luis\nOrganization Reterg is\nAddress teredotr\nCity berlin\nState berlin\nCountry DE Germany\nPhone +49.454545445\nPrivate no\n\nThe registrant of the site is [enripintos123@outlook.es, whom we find listed as the registrant for a range of other domains. All but two](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/12/packrat-report/enripintos123@outlook.es)\nare lookalike to the login pages of major online services, or suggestive of updates to services like Java and Android (see Appendix\n**D). The two exceptions are lavozamericana.info and pancaliente.info (see Section 6. Possible Deception Operations). Both of**\nthose domains were registered within the timeframe of other registrations of lookalike or confirmed phishing domains.\n\n**4.3.1 Lookalike Fake News Sites**\n\nThe website Ecuador En Vivio (ecuadorenvivo.com) is a legitimate news site, however the attackers control the lookalike\necuadorenvivo.co domain. Packrat has used this fake domain to send emails to targets, either containing attachment-based\nmalware, or links to the site which has also been used to seed malware via a plugin error.\n\n[A Twitter user spotted the fake plugin notification in May 2015 and alerted their followers, and included a screenshot purporting to](https://twitter.com/el_mercioco/status/596141189071577090)\nshow one of the fake plugin alerts.\n\nImage 22: Fake plugin notification\nSimilarly, Focus Ecuador (focusecuador.net) is a genuine news website, however the domain focusecuador.tk, is controlled by the\nattackers, and has been observed seeding malware using a fake popup. Examination of the IP hosting focusecuador.tk\n(193.105.134.27) reveals a long list of obvious lookalike domains (See Appendix D).\n\n**4.3.2 A Fake News Organization: The American Voice?**\n\nA second interesting domain is lavozamericana.info, which is no longer active. However we were also able to find a Twitter identity\nand string of tweets suggesting that there may have been an effort to establish the legitimacy of the site.\n\n[https://twitter.com/voz_americana](https://twitter.com/voz_americana)\nInterestingly, the fake identity appears to have had at least some success, as some of the followers of the account appear to be\ngenuine.

The same domain was also mentioned in a recent report by an Ecuadorian NGO of malware](http://www.fundamedios.org/alertas/periodistas-y-activistas-sufren-repetidos-intentos-de-hackeo/)\nattacks against journalists in Ecuador.

During much of\n2015, we observed that Packrat regularly used the same bit.ly link in a range of attacks.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1wl3YE2\n\nThis link was created Oct. 31, 2014 by an anonymous sharer. Examining statistics for the bit.ly link, we were able to see a superficial\noverview of the volume, timeframe, and basic geographic distribution of clicks.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 25: An overview of the volume, timeframe, and basic geographic distribution of clicks\nThe distribution of clicks is particularly interesting, and suggests that a majority of the hits were located in Ecuador, with others in\nArgentina, Germany, the United States, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The absence of Brazil is not necessarily surprising, as it is\nlikely that the attackers, if they continue to phish in Brazil, may be using separate, Portuguese language sites. This provides an\nindirect window into the location of Packrat’s targets.\n\nA majority of clicks (322) came from direct link clicks, rather than link shares elsewhere. While this particular bitly link was not\nextensively clicked on social media sites, Packrat does use social media for some seeding.\n\n### 4.5 Note: Lots of Phishing, Not All of it Linkable\n\nThe investigation yielded a high volume of Spanish-language phishing attacks against the same individuals that Packrat targeted,\nhowever for a number of reasons we were unable to link much of the phishing activity to Packrat. One of the most notable and high\nvolume campaigns that we identified used the domain gmail.com.msg07.xyz and masqueraded as a range of account notifications\nfrom popular providers including Gmail. Typically these messages displayed as originating from e-mail addresses like “noresponder@supportgmai1.com.”  In some cases, individuals received these messages almost weekly over long periods of time.\n\n## 5. Possible Deception Operations\n\nNot all of the domains associated with this group appear to have been built to spread malware, or to trick victims into entering their\npasswords. Several domains are extensively built out, and currently maintained, which appear to be designed to convey the\nimpression of active, news media sites. Some of these sites contain ‘original’ news stories and ‘leaks’ about political figures. At least\ntwo of these sites seem Venezuela-specific, while a third is Ecuador-oriented.\n\nWhat makes these three fake organizations exceptionally interesting is that we have found no evidence that they are used to seed\nmalware or conduct phishing, either directly, or as pretexts for messages. While it may be that we simply lack visibility on the\ntargeting, it may be that the pages and identities serve another function. They may be attempts to seed false information, or might\nserve as watering holes to attract individuals that Packrat or its sponsors wish to monitor. They may also be coupled with other\noperations on which we have no visibility.\n\n### 5.1 Anti-Chavez: The Very Strange Case of pancaliente.info\n\nUpdate: immediately **prior to the publication of this report the Pancaliente.info site went offline. The site is** **still viewable in**\n**Google’s cache. The second domain of this type (chavistas24.com) remains online.**\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the most interesting domains also hosted on 198.12.150.249 is pancaliente.info. At first glance this is a Venezuela focused\nnews and information site. Unlike all of the other sites hosted on this IP that we could verify, this site appeared to have a large\nvolume of original content that was presented in a news format.\n\nNevertheless, the site has many links to the other domains. While the domain registration is currently masked, the registration e-mail\nis shared with other phishing sites.\n\n[pancaliente.info](http://pancaliente.info/) GoDaddy.com,LLC(R171-LRMS) enripintos123@outlook.es [ns1.hostinger.ru](http://ns1.hostinger.ru/) 10/25/2014 49454545445\n\n[The registration can be verified, although pancaliente.info’s WHOIS has since been made private.](http://domainbigdata.com/email/enripintos123@outlook.es)\n\nImage 26: Pan caliente website as it appeared in October 2015\nExamining more closely, much of the content seems to be intended to appeal to Venezuelans at home and abroad who oppose the\nPartido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV: the party of Hugo Chavez). Some of the reports are intriguing because they describe\nprivate documents seemingly obtained by the site (and of questionable veracity), but without further information about their origins.\n\nIn other cases, the site has published purportedly “leaked” documents. Many of these stories are critical of individuals linked to the\nPSUV. Many reports also concern the “Expat” community of Venezuelans who oppose the regime from overseas, especially the\ndiaspora in Spain.\n\n[PanCaliente is referenced elsewhere online, such as an apparently leaked document hosted on Slideshare. Some of their reports](http://www.slideshare.net/Pancalienteve)\n[also appear to have been excerpted or cited by other online news sites.](http://www.el-nacional.com/sucesos/Investigan-EE-UU-Mariano-Diaz_0_611339029.html)\n\nAlthough there seems to be a great deal of content, PanCaliente’s articles do not have bylines. While the site is linked with a very\nactive Twitter account (https://twitter.com/pancalienteve), the associated Facebook profile (facebook.com/pancalienteok) is sparse.\n[The WayBack Machine makes it clear that PanCaliente has only recently become active.](https://archive.org/web/)\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 27: The Wayback Machine on Pan caliente\nInterestingly, some of the first reports published on the site appear to have been written when the site was being demoed as having a\ndifferent name and identity “Venezuela365.com.”\n\nImage 28: Early logos, still visible in the website’s directory structure\n\nImage 29: Variation on the current PanCaliente logo\nThe many images of this alternate logo as it went through its iterations are publicly visible. Also still online is at least one report that\nstill refers to the site as venezuela365.

Sistekon Corporation seems to now be defunct, although its information is still on archive.org, and indicates that it](http://web.archive.org/web/20130719001853/http://www.sistekon.com/)\ndevelops IT software as well as selling various security solutions. Given that the domain expired in 2013, but was re-registered in\n2014 at around the same time as pancaliente.info, the link may be coincidental.\n\nWe found no evidence that PanCaliente or venezuela365 was ever used to seed malware or conduct phishing attempts, either\ndirectly, or as a pretext for malicious content.\n\n### 5.2 And Pro-Chavez: Chavistas 24.com\n\nThe domain, chavistas24.com, which seems to refer to supporters of former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, also has a range of\ncontent that is apparently supportive of the party.\n\nImage 30: Screenshot of Chavistas24.com showing articles tagged “Traitors of the Revolution”on Chavistas24.com\nChavistas24.com similarly has an associated Twitter account that pushes out tweets, mostly referencing stories published on the\nwebsite.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chavistas24/\n\n\n-----\n\n[Image 31: The Chavistas 24 Twitter Feed](https://twitter.com/chavistas24/)\nWe found no evidence that chavistas24.com was used to phish or send malware, either directly, or as a pretext for malicious content\nor messages.\n\n### 5.3 Seeking Angry Police?\n\nPackrat appears to be interested in attracting dissatisfied members of Ecuador’s National Police, and has created a website (justiciadesvinculados.com) and social media identity built around “Los Desvinculados,” referring to police let go from Ecuador’s National\nPolice, possibly in the context of corruption inquiries. The website, which also includes a login section, contains news and highly\ncritical reports about the Ecuadorian government.\n\n[Ecuador’s police have previously been involved in protests over benefit cuts that some have seen as one of the strongest threats to](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/30/ecuador-chaos-police-rafael-correa)\nEcuadorian President Rafael Correa’s rule.\n\nImage 32: Screenshot of Los Desvinculados website\nThe social media component of this creation, including a Twitter page of the same name (twitter.com/justdesvincula2) further\ndevelops the identity.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 33: Screenshot of Desvinculados Twitter page\nAs with the two other operations described in this section, we have been unable to identify malware or phishing associated directly or\nindirectly with Justicia Desvinculados.\n\n## Part 6: The Challenge of Attribution\n\nThe evidence presented in this report points to a coordinated and persistent campaign with a regional focus. Naturally, this raises\nquestions about attribution. This section assesses two competing hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Packrat is State-Sponsored and\n**Hypothesis 2: Packrat is Not State-Sponsored. For each hypothesis we provide one or more scenarios that we consider plausible**\nversions of the hypothesis.\n\n### 6.1 Hypothesis 1: Packrat is State-Sponsored\n\n**6.1.2 Examining the Target List**\n\nThe list of known targets is full of influential people whose activities could have an impact on the domestic and regional political\nstanding of regimes in several countries. Where we have been able to identify individuals who have been targeted, we find vocal,\nstrong regime critics and independent journalists in Ecuador and Argentina. Interestingly, Packrat has also targeted parliamentarians,\nand others within the government of Ecuador. This diversity of targets with (possibly) opposing positions is a common theme in the\ndata.\n\nIn other cases, we find phishing and malware-seeding websites, emails and messages with obviously political themes. Packrat\ncreated fake political organizations, whose identities, logos, and websites are then used to seed phishing attacks and malware.\nThese materials seem designed to appeal primarily to both critics and (some) members of governments in Ecuador and Venezuela.\nWe also believe that there are targets in other countries, including Brazil, but have limited information about who they are.\n\nThese are the kinds of targets who would be of interest to an intelligence or security service in the region, especially one not\nequipped to directly and passively monitor all of the communications of their targets. The multiple nations reflected in the seeding\nand targeting suggest, further, that the sponsor(s) of this activity would be interested in the opponents of several regimes.\n\n\n-----\n\n**6.1.3 Motivation for Disinformation Campaigns**\n\nWe see a range of fake websites touching on political themes, but not obviously used to seed malware. While some of these sites\nshare the same registrations as malware serving sites, they differ by having extensive content, and show no evidence of having\nhosted malicious files or phishing pages, or of having been used as pretexts for campaigns, as is common with Packrat. The content\nreflects extensive effort, as does the backstopping with identities on social media sites.\n\nThere seem to be three possible explanations for these pages. First, the pages may be an attempt to create credible fake\norganizations that can be used to actively promote disinformation, interspersed with real news. Second, the pages may serve as\nhoneypots, used to attract targets, either to identify and possibly manipulate them, or to build trust that could then be used in\nmalware attacks. Finally, the pages may be part of information gathering operations that have other components of which we are not\naware.\n\nWhile it would not be surprising for a political movement or well-funded set of interests to engage in these activities in one country,\nPackrat has done so in multiple countries. It is not clear what group beyond a state, would be interested in this kind of activity, and\nhave the resources to support it.\n\n**6.1.4 Ability to Pay**\n\nThe hosting and domain registrations necessary to maintain this campaign infrastructure for more than seven years clearly have\nassociated costs. The human labor associated with creating and maintaining the many fake websites we have observed is also\ncostly. This is especially true for the websites with substantial “original” content, such as PanCaliente. Finally, the extensive and\npersonalized targeting clearly reflects substantial human effort.\n\nThe cost of this campaign suggests that Packrat is either well-resourced, or has sponsors who can pay for server space and time, as\nwell as the costs of Packrat’s operators. We see no evidence of targeting with out-of-scope seeding materials, such as industry,\nbusiness or the financial sector. Given the cost of the campaign, it is difficult to see who, beyond a state or an organized entity with\npolitical aspirations, would both want the information, and be in a position to pay for it.\n\n**6.1.5 Clues That Packrat Feels ‘Safe’**\n\nWhen the first reports were published on the Nisman and Argentine targeting in early 2015, some of Packrat’s infrastructure was\nexposed. Nevertheless, much of the infrastructure has remained online. From a pragmatic point of view this makes sense. If Packrat\nhad successful implants operational at that time, taking the infrastructure offline would close that access. Packrat would have had to\nengage in a process of pushing out updated implants to the infected computers that connected to a new host. This time-consuming\nprocess would also be prone to failure and possible detection.\n\nIf Packrat were afraid of criminal punishment in their country of residence, it would have been natural to take the servers offline once\nexposed. Their interlinked infrastructure can be used to investigate, as we did, the broader structure of their campaigns. In the hands\nof a law enforcement agency, these active servers could potentially be traced back to the responsible parties.\n\nThe fact that the servers remain online suggests that Packrat is operating purely on practical concerns, which do not include fear of\nthe authorities. We take this to suggest that they may enjoy a degree of protection in the country or countries in which they operate.\n\nWhile it is less conclusive, their taunts of a Citizen Lab researcher also suggest a degree of confidence that these actions will not\nhave consequence for them. Given their decision to keep their infrastructure online, this researcher may not have been the first (or\nthe last) to bother them by analyzing one of their attacks.\n\n**6.1.6 Two Scenarios of State Sponsorship**\n\nIn this section we present two possible scenarios for state sponsorship. The data we have presented in this report could be\nexplained by either of these possibilities (or by the scenario outlined for Hypothesis 2: Non State Sponsor).\n\n**Scenario 1: A Single State Sponsor**\n\nThere are several possible explanations for the targeting we see. It is possible that Packrat is working for a single intelligence or\nsecurity service, and that these activities all reflect that service’s targeting. Such a service would, potentially, wish to keep tabs on\nmany groups, including both its opponents, the opponents of friendly governments, and possibly friendly governments themselves.\n\nThe strong representation of ALBA (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas) countries, and their recent “fellow-travelers” (Argentina\nincluded, although it has recently changed ruling parties), among the locations of targeting may be instructive. The leaders of these\ncountries are widely seen as political allies on the leftist spectrum, although Argentina’s most recent [election in November 2015](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/argentina-election-exit-polls-buenos-aires-mauricio-macri)\nelected a president who seems to reject this relationship. The governments of Ecuador and Venezuela, meanwhile, are especially\n[close allies, although it is unclear how this will evolve given Venezuela’s very recent elections.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/07/venezuela-parliamentary-election-opposition-win-political-prisoners-amnesty)\n\n\n-----\n\nSome may jump to interpret public reports of malware attacks targeting opponents of the Ecuadorian government as conclusive\nevidence of official Ecuadorian government involvement with Packrat. They may also point to previous reports that Ecuador’s\ndomestic intelligence agency reportedly used the commercial trojan made by Hacking Team to [target at least one dissident.](http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2015/08/06/apnewsbreak-leaked-hacking-team-emails-suggest-ecuador-illegally-spied-on/)\nHowever, the presence of targets within the Ecuadorian parliament and possibly elsewhere in the government challenges any\n**simplistic theory of Ecuadorian government sponsorship, but does not completely rule it out as intra-governmental rivalries or**\nother dynamics could be at play.\n\n**Scenario 2: Mercenary Work for One or More Government Sponsors**\nThe range and diversity of regional targets, which includes the opponents of several regimes, as well as those same governments\nsupporters in some cases, could be taken as indicating that the threat actor group is reusing the same infrastructure for campaigns\non behalf of multiple client governments at once. It is possible, for example, that Packrat is in the “address book” of multiple clients,\nand reuses the same infrastructure for multiple campaigns.\n\n### 6.2 Hypothesis 2: Packrat is Not a State Actor\n\nAlthough some of the evidence we have outlined above provides circumstantial support for state sponsorship, other features of\nPackrat’s activity are not so clear. This section briefly lays out the most salient of these pieces of evidence: lack of technical\nsophistication. We evaluate this fact, and then briefly note a potential scenario for non-state sponsorship.\n\n**6.2.1 Lack of Use of technically sophisticated tools**\n\nThe malware used by this campaign is primarily Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RATs, not boutique or tailor-made implants. Nor\nis it the commercial malware sold to governments by companies like FinFisher and Hacking Team. Additionally, the attackers do not\nmake use of exploits for their malware seeding. The lack of exploits very likely hampers the efficacy of many attacks. For example\nsome of the bait documents instruct victims to double click on an icon in the document. This is cumbersome, and is more likely to\nresult in failed attacks or discovery. A threat actor with the direct support of a government might have access to more sophisticated\nmalware, and exploits.\n\nHowever, it is well documented that not all government-linked malware groups make use of sophisticated malware or exploits. Prior\nresearch by Citizen Lab, for example, has shown that state-sponsored groups targeting civil society often use the minimum\nnecessary technical sophistication in their campaigns. Why use more sophisticated or esoteric technique when simpler tools suffice?\nOther research on government-linked hacking groups in the Middle East also suggests that these groups persist in exploit-less\ntargeting, perhaps because it is inexpensive, and that it nevertheless achieves a minimum satisfactory level of infections.\n\nUltimately, the reliance on COTS malware and lack of exploits does not enable us to draw many conclusions. However, it does have\none feature worth noting: by extensively obfuscating COTS malware, the attackers are nevertheless able to deliver malware that is\neffective at evading detection while simultaneously being difficult to attribute. That said, since obfuscated malware is also common in\ncriminal hacking, the pairing of crimeware and obfuscators does not tell either way towards this hypothesis.\n\n**6.2.2: Scenario: Non-State Group**\n\nIt is impossible to reject the possibility that Packrat is a criminal or non-state group. Such a group could, in theory, be a supporter of\nan opposition political movement, or have other interests in the critics of regimes. There are a range of powerful non-state groups in\nSouth America, including cartels and others involved in illegal trafficking, who would certainly have the ability to pay for these\noperations. Nevertheless, given the particular targets we are aware of, we are unsure of why these individuals would be of primary\ninterest to groups involved in illegal activities.\n\nAnother possibility, also unfalsifiable, is that a non-government group with political ambitions is responsible for Packrat. Such a group\nmight be particularly interested in potential allies or sources of instability, as well as governments.\n\n### 6.3 Adjudicating between competing hypotheses\n\nUltimately, this report does not provide sufficient data to conclusively adjudicate between hypotheses. However, we think that the\nbest fit, which is still circumstantial, is that the ultimate recipient of the information collected by Packrat is likely one or more\ngovernments in the region.\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nThis report described a seven year campaign with targets in several Latin American countries. While there are many well-known\nthreat actors in Latin America, many of the most visible are engaged in cybercrime. What distinguishes Packrat is the extensive and\noften ingenious targeting of political figures, journalists and others. They are also distinguished by their ability to remain active over\nsuch an extended period, seemingly unfazed by discovery.\n\n\n-----\n\nPackrat highlights the extent to which multi year campaigns can be run using limited technical sophistication, and a lot of creativity.\nFrom a technical perspective, they rely almost entirely on off-the-shelf RATs and packers to evade antivirus detection. Where they\nexcel is in the time and effort spent to create detailed and moderately convincing fake organizations to seed their malware.\n\nTheir persistence, and their willingness to keep using domains even after they are exposed suggests that exposure of their\ninfrastructure is not an existential threat. Their threats and taunts are similarly brazen. This strongly suggests, but does not prove,\nthat Packrat operates with a perception of safety.\n\nUltimately, this report does not conclusively attribute Packrat’s activities, however we hope that by exposing their activities, we have\nprovided encouragement to others to continue to follow the thread.\n\n### Note: The Precarious Position of Media in Latin America\n\nWhile we discourage a direct link between specific incidents of non-digital harassment of journalists and Packrat, the case highlights\nthe difficult situation faced by journalists and freedom of expression supporters in countries like Ecuador.\n\nIn Ecuador, for example, [numerous](https://www.hrw.org/americas/ecuador) [observers, including the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, have](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2013/ecuador)\n[expressed concern that the freedoms afforded to journalists continue to be constricted. In Ecuador journalists, and even cartoonists,](http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21595946-government-orders-newspaper-correct-critical-cartoon-drawn-and-quartered)\nhave faced apparent retaliation for political speech. Journalist Martha Roldos, for example, had personal e-mails exposed in the\npress, and recordings of her conversations played in public. Freedom of expression and journalism organization Fundamedios,\n[which has documented over 600 attacks against journalists from 2008-2012, has face forced shutdown. Interestingly, both of these](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/09/ngo-alert-ecuadorian-government-orders-press-freedom-group-to-disband)\nindividuals were also targets of Packrat. While we have no evidence linking the perpetrators of these actions to Packrat, nor reason\nto believe the sponsor is the same, the targeted malware that we describe only adds to the threats these individuals and\norganizations face.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[1] See Appendix B for details.\n\n[2] bc97437fec7e7e8634c2eabae3cc4832\n\n[3] Sandboxes include ThreatExpert, Anubis, CWSandbox, JoeBox and Norman Sandbox.

Note that some of the sender emails look very similar to\nlegitimate e-mails of real people.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B Malware Samples\n\n**MD5** **C&C** **Family**\n\ndd1101adc86fd282f5f183942cc2f3b7 wjwj.no-ip.org ruley.no-ip.org lolinha.no-ip.org CyberGate\n\n2d722592a4e3c8030410dccccb221ce4 wjwj.no-ip.org CyberGate\n\nd2adecc6287dd4d559fe6ce2ce7a7e31 wjwj.no-ip.org ruley.no-ip.org lolinha.no-ip.org Cybergate (suspected)\n\n93b630891db21a4a2350280a360c713d ruley.no-ip.org wjwj.no-ip.org lolinha.no-ip.org CyberGate\n\na73351623577f44a2b578fed1e78e37e ruley.no-ip.org wjwj.no-ip.org CyberGate\n\n5a8975873f52436377d8fb0b5ab0d87a ruley.no-ip.org CyberGate\n\ned8d7ed45b64890b8901b735018318f3 ruley.no-ip.org wjwj.no-ip.org CyberGate\n\nc2237e9d415f542ce6e73adb260af123 wjwj.no-ip.org Xtreme RAT\n\n2827450763b55c5e71fda3caaf8e75f9 wjwj.no-ip.org Xtreme RAT\n\nbc97437fec7e7e8634c2eabae3cc4832 ruley.no-ip.org taskmgr.serveftp.com CyberGate\n\nd7f34168b1a7dd7cbd8e62a5ab1ebc0e taskmgr.serveftp.com taskmgr.servehttp.com Xtreme RAT\n\n6c34d4296126679d9c6a0bc2660dc453 taskmgr.servehttp.com taskmgr.serveftp.com CyberGate\n\nefc0009d76a2057f86c5f00030378c72 daynews.sytes.net AlienSpy\n\n74613eae84347183b4ca61b912a4573f daynews.sytes.net AlienSpy\n\nd2f151312f7dee2483ddcab9766b56db daynews.sytes.net AlienSpy\n\nea7bcf58a4ccdecb0c64e56b9998a4ac daynews.sytes.net Adzok\n\n1e4265a0c37773c2372b97bb6630ae57 daynews.sytes.net Adzok\n\n08a3bb5b220eb1e0dc2ecccbbc6859f5 daynews.sytes.net Adzok\n\n2de51e74fd571319bbf763ec62781096 deyrep24.ddns.net AlienSpy\n\n8fb96dfab7e4c0acb1eb9f4e950ba4b9 deyrep24.ddns.net AlienSpy\n\n4a23a1d6779d199aaa582cf0a5868ad1 deyrep24.ddns.net Adzok\n\n0ae0038ffe8cf5c3170734a71ff2213d deyrep24.ddns.net AlienSpy\n\n8e0f021dcbbfa586a1c6780e77ac0fb6 taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\na74ef893b1bf21c9df6d8e31285db981 taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\na988235ad7d47acbeca5ccb4ea5a1ed5 taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\n15ebe16cd9500de534d5bfd5eeceaf73 taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\n01dec1b1d0760d5a1a562edcfeb478d1 taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\n1e6d0b59d4fb7650453c207688385f3a taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\ne03be1849ad7cecba1e20923074cd22f taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\n779a79c11f581b84e7c81f321fd8d743 conhost.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\n13d939b2412c6adbab3cc1b539166671 conhost.servehttp.com dllhost.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\n7b2cb5249d704cb1df8d4210e7c3d553 dllhost.servehttp.com conhost.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\na09f100ddc7cf29f8a93a3d7a79c58b9 taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\nce6065346a918a813eeb58bbb0814a23 taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\nea50bf8abcf9c0c40c4490dc15fb0a2a taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\n\n-----\n\n**MD5** **C&C** **Family**\n\n3a61d64986ee6529cee271ab6754faa5 taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\n695db7dd3b1daf89f2c56d59faecc088 taskmgr.servehttp.com CyberGate\n\n## Appendix C: Malware Configuration\n\n### CyberGate RAT Configuration\n\nAll Packrat’s CyberGate samples seem to have been configured roughly in the same way, with only occasional changes in the\nCommand & Control domains and port. The following configuration, for example, has been extracted from\n01dec1b1d0760d5a1a562edcfeb478d1:\n\n**Key** **Value**\n\nActivate Keylogger TRUE\n\nActive X Startup {C452W6HW-7DQ6-8U8P-2730-EI158IF7748K}\n\nChange Creation Date TRUE\n\nCyberGate Version\n\nDomain taskmgr.redirectme.net|taskmgr.servehttp.com|\n\nEnable Message Box FALSE\n\nFTP Address ftp.server.com\n\nFTP Directory Value ./logs/\n\nFTP Interval 30\n\nFTP Password +\n\nFTP Port 21\n\nFTP UserName ftp_user\n\nGoogle Chrome Passwords\n\nHide File TRUE\n\nInstall Directory System32\n\nInstall File Name taskhost.exe\n\nInstall Flag TRUE\n\nInstall Message Box Arquivo Extraido com sucesso\n\nInstall Message Title Ok\n\nKeylogger Backspace = Delete FALSE\n\nKeylogger Enable FTP FALSE\n\nMelt File FALSE\n\nMessage Box Button 0\n\nMessage Box Icon 64\n\nMutex ***MUTEX***\n\nP2P Spread\n\nPassword abcd1234\n\nPersistence TRUE\n\n\n-----\n\n**Key** **Value**\n\nPort 2012|2008|\n\nProcess Injection Disabled\n\nREG Key HKCU msconfig\n\nREG Key HKLM msconfig\n\nServerID desp\n\nStartup Policies Policies\n\nUSB Spread FALSE\n\nWhen no decoy Office document is added to the AutoIt3 stub, they normally enabled the Message Box and used “Arquivo\ncorrompido“ as message. Additionally, the ServerID value seems to change, including additional values like ley, vtima, Emais 10.\n\n### Xtreme RAT Configuration\n\nFollowing is the configuration for one of the XtremeRAT
