With the CrowdStrike\neCrime Index (ECX), CrowdStrike’s Intelligence team maintains a composite score to track\nchanges to this ecosystem. The ECX is composed of several key observables covering\ndifferent aspects of criminal activity that are combined using a mathematical model. In recent\n[weeks, the Intelligence team observed a notable shift in big game hunting (BGH) activity and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/cyber-big-game-hunting/)\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that resulted in a downward trend of the ECX. As\nnoted in a previous CrowdStrike Intelligence blog, the intense attention surrounding the\nColonial Pipeline and JBS incidents had a significant impact on the criminal marketplace and\nthe political landscape. Get more Intel updates on the latest eCrime activity and TTPs at\n[Fal.Con, our annual cybersecurity conference, Oct. 12-14 — register for free today.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon/)\n\n## ECX Suggests Downward Trend in Ransomware Operations Following Colonial Pipeline Attack\n\n\n-----\n\nBy the time of the Colonial Pipeline attack on May 7, 2021, observed BGH ransomware\nincidents had reached a yearly high. However, publicly observable BGH activity declined\nthroughout early June 2021, immediately after the incident, amid reports of mounting U.S.\npressure to pursue BGH actors. A similar decline was also observed in the number of\nspecific leaks posted to adversaries’ dedicated leak sites (DLS). Despite the decline in the\nECX, there has been sustained ransomware activity, likely indicating that a number of\nadversaries are remaining active despite the dismantling of other groups.\n\n## BGH Actor Developments\n\nBGH adversaries responded to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident and the resulting\nwidespread media coverage in many ways. Some named actors shuttered ransomware-asa-service (RaaS) affiliate programs — at least publicly — while others have continued\ndeploying ransomware.\n\n[CARBON SPIDER (operators of DarkSide ransomware) continues to create active](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors/carbon-spider)\ncommand-and-control (C2) servers to deploy their Domenus PS backdoor and Cobalt Strike\npost-exploitation framework. The activation of new C2 servers demonstrates that CARBON\nSPIDER has not halted activities despite allegedly losing control of DarkSide-related\ninfrastructure and having their ransomware funds seized by the U.S. government. However,1\nin late July 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a new ransomware called BlackMatter\nbeing distributed. Code overlaps indicate that BlackMatter is highly likely the successor of\nCARBON SPIDER’s DarkSide ransomware. CARBON SPIDER has also created a Linux\nversion of BlackMatter that resembles the Linux version of DarkSide in multiple ways. After\n\n\n-----\n\ntaking a short break, CARBON SPIDER reinstated their BGH operations involving this RaaS\nand have stated that they have an interest in purchasing and executing unauthorized access\nto corporate networks.\n\n[RIDDLE SPIDER (operators of Avaddon ransomware) closed down their operations in late](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors/riddle-spider)\nJune. Earlier in June 2021, media sources allegedly received emails containing a password\nand links to 7zip files containing Avaddon ransomware decryption keys. RIDDLE SPIDER’s2\nDLS also went offline in June. While CrowdStrike Intelligence cannot confirm RIDDLE\nSPIDER’s motivations for closing down the Avaddon RaaS, the decision was likely\ninfluenced by the Colonial Pipeline incident and its resulting effects throughout the\nransomware industry.\n\n\n[GRACEFUL SPIDER had several members of their group arrested on June 16, 2021, by a](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors/graceful-spider)\njoint international law enforcement operation. These members were involved in laundering3\ncryptocurrency funds acquired through the use of GRACEFUL SPIDER’s Clop ransomware.\nThe immediate impact to GRACEFUL SPIDER operations resulting from these arrests is\ncurrently unclear. GRACEFUL SPIDER’s DLS site remains active after the arrests, with two\nnew listings in June, indicating they have not ceased their activity.\n\n[PINCHY SPIDER (developers and operators of the popular REvil RaaS) continued operating](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors/pinchy-spider)\nat a high pace throughout June and early July 2021, and the group introduced a new\nransomware named REvix, which is used to target ESXi and Linux environments. However,\non the morning of July 13, 2021, PINCHY SPIDER’s REvil infrastructure supporting their DLS\nand payment portal went offline. On the same day, the forum administrator of the Russianlanguage criminal forum XSS banned the actor Unknown (aka UNKN), who has acted as the\npublic spokesperson for PINCHY SPIDER since 2019. PINCHY SPIDER had released REvil\nversion 2.08 a few days prior, confirming the ransomware was under active development,\nand version 1.2 of REvix was observed on July 23.\n\nOn Sept. 7, after an approximately three month hiatus, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed\nPINCHY SPIDER’s REvil infrastructure come back online. Financial activity in terms of BTC\ntransactions from previously identified REvil addresses was also detected on Sept. 5.\n\n[On June 4, a sample of INDRIK SPIDER’s Hades ransomware was identified using the name](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors/indrik-spider)\n_PAYLOADBIN, similar to Babuk Locker’s DLS site Payload.bin. INDRIK SPIDER likely_\nswitched the names in an effort to avoid attribution by law enforcement and therefore avoid\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions. Prior to this recent name change,\nINDRIK SPIDER attempted to change the names of Hades and their Phoenix CryptoLocker\nransomware at least one other time to avoid OFAC sanctions. The changes made to avoid\nthese sanctions indicates that INDRIK SPIDER desires to continue their deployment of\n[ransomware.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn July 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence determined that Grief ransomware is developed by\n[DOPPEL SPIDER, likely as an intended successor to DoppelPaymer ransomware. The](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors/doppel-spider)\ncessation in DoppelPaymer activity coincided with the emergence of the Grief DLS that was\nfirst observed in May. Analysis of recently identified Grief samples indicates a number of\ntechnical overlaps with DOPPEL SPIDER’s wider toolset that provides a definitive link to the\nadversary.\n\n[WIZARD SPIDER continues to actively deploy Conti ransomware and update the Conti DLS.](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors/wizard-spider)\nIn June 2021, WIZARD SPIDER continued to target large entities in Europe and the United\nStates, including organizations in real estate, education and local government. Recent\ndevelopments related to the Colonial Pipeline and JBS incidents have not slowed down\nWIZARD SPIDER’s ransomware operations. This indicates WIZARD SPIDER remains\nlargely unaffected by external pressure, similar to their response to the September 2020\n[takedown efforts targeting TrickBot](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/wizard-spider-adversary-update/) infrastructure.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe confluence of U.S. and international law enforcement pressure and forum bans on\nransomware activity has led to a highly fluid and chaotic situation in the eCrime ecosystem.\nThe ECX has indicated a change in BGH activity May through June 2021 as well as the\npersistence of ongoing BGH incidents at a level observed in the first quarter of 2021.\nHowever, the downward trend in BGH victims posted to DLSs in June likely indicates that\nsome BGH actors have shifted TTPs to make tracking their activity more difficult.\n\nNumerous adversaries have shown themselves keen to take advantage of the situation and\nto attract new affiliates. These adversaries have explicitly expressed their intent to continue\nransomware operations despite reports of possible U.S.-Russian collaboration — or more\naggressive unilateral enforcement actions by the U.S. — in response to incidents, suggesting\nthat a complete drop in BGH activity is highly unlikely to occur in the near future.\n\nThe ECX remains a valuable tool used to identify significant events affecting the eCrime\necosystem. The ECX provides an easily referenced index to mark areas of disruption or\nchange in the eCrime ecosystem in real time.\n\n[Monitor the ECX regularly in the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe to make sure you stay up-](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/)\nto-date on eCrime trends.\n\n**Endnotes**\n\n1. https[:]//www.justice[.]gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency\npaid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside\n2. https[:]//www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down\nand-releases-decryption-keys/\n\n\n-----\n\n3. https[:]//www.npu.gov[.]ua/news/kiberzlochini/kiberpolicziya-vikrila-xakerske\nugrupovannya-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-virusu-shifruvalnika-ta-nanesenni-inozemnimkompaniyam-piv-milyarda-dolariv-zbitkiv/\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Learn how Falcon X Recon™ mitigates digital risk from the deep, dark web and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/threat-intelligence/falcon-x-recon/)_\n_beyond._\n_Read about BGH adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence in 2020 in the_\n_[CrowdStrike 2021 Global Threat Report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-threat-report/)_\n_To find out how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors into your security strategy,_\n_visit the_ _[Falcon X™ Threat Intelligence page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)_\n_Learn about the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the_\n_product webpage._\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ and learn how true next-](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
