As part of that commitment, we want to provide you with the following\nupdate on our investigation.\n\nWe have identified a global campaign that introduces a compromise into the networks of\npublic and private organizations through the software supply chain. This compromise is\ndelivered through updates to a widely-used IT infrastructure management software—the\nOrion network monitoring product from SolarWinds. The campaign demonstrates top-tier\noperational tradecraft and resourcing consistent with state-sponsored threat actors.\n\nBased on our analysis, the attacks that we believe have been conducted as part of this\ncampaign share certain common elements:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Use of malicious SolarWinds update: Inserting malicious code into legitimate**\nsoftware updates for the Orion software that allow an attacker remote access into the\nvictim’s environment\n**Light malware footprint: Using limited malware to accomplish the mission while**\navoiding detection\n**Prioritization of stealth: Going to significant lengths to observe and blend into normal**\nnetwork activity\n**High OPSEC: Patiently conducting reconnaissance, consistently covering their tracks,**\nand using difficult-to-attribute tools\n\nBased on our analysis, we have now identified multiple organizations where we see\nindications of compromise dating back to the Spring of 2020, and we are in the process of\nnotifying those organizations. Our analysis indicates that these compromises are not selfpropagating; each of the attacks require meticulous planning and manual interaction. Our\nongoing investigation uncovered this campaign, and we are sharing this information\nconsistent with our standard practice.\n\nWe have been in close coordination with SolarWinds, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\nand other key partners. We believe it is critical to notify all our customers and the security\ncommunity about this threat so organizations can take appropriate steps. As this activity is\nthe subject of an ongoing FBI investigation, there are also limits to the information we are\nable to share at this time.\n\nWe have already updated our products to detect the known altered SolarWinds binaries. We\nare also scanning for any traces of activity by this actor and reaching out to both customers\nand non-customers if we see potential indicators.\n\nFor more information please see:\n\n[Technical details regarding the actor’s tactics, techniques and procedures](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\n[FireEye’s GitHub for SUNBURST countermeasures](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures)\n[SolarWinds Security Advisory](https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory)\n\nFireEye’s mission is to make our customers and the broader community safer. We are\nmethodically uncovering and exposing this campaign piece by piece and working to prevent\nfuture attacks. It will require coordinated action by public and private organizations to fully\nexpose and mitigate this threat, and we intend to continue our efforts.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements contained in this blog post constitute “forward-looking statements” within\nthe meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
