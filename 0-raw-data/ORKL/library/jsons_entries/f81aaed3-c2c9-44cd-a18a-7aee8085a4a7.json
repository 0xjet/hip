This time,\nhowever, this attacker uses a COVID pandemic that has not yet happened as bait.\nFortiGuard Labs recently discovered a new malware posing as a mysterious COVID22\ninstaller. While containing many of the features of \"joke\" malware, it is also destructive,\ncausing infected machines to fail to boot. Because it has no features for encrypting data\n\n\n-----\n\ndemanding a ransom to undo the damage it inflicts, it is instead a new destructive malware\nvariant designed to render affected systems inoperable. This blog explains how this malware\nworks.\n\n## Covid-22 in Action\n\nThe malware file is named Covid22. For those unfamiliar with the naming scheme, COVID19 is a short form of Coronavirusdisease, and 19 represents the year the outbreak was first\nidentified. The file name Covid22 plays off the current Coronavirus disease but applies that\nsame image of fear and destruction to computers, potentially creating a cyber-pandemic in\n2022. While we don't know how exactly the malware was distributed, the malware author has\ntried to weaponize fear as bait to lure victims into opening the file.\n\n[While the malware itself is not sophisticated, it does take several actions designed to put fear](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/malware?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=malware)\ninto the victim before inducing true panic. But before that, when first manually running the\nfile, it asks whether the potential victim wants to install Covid-22 on their machine, as if it\nwere an application.\n\nFigure 1. Installer screen that asks the victim for permission to install\n\nOnce the victim proceeds with the installation, the malware drops several malicious files\nbefore forcefully rebooting the machine. Dropped files have file names that are simple and\nself-described for their actions. They are listed below in sequence of execution.\n\nCovid22Server.exe executes the commands in the dropped script.txt\nlol.vbs creates an endless loop of a MessageBox with \"Your PC has been infected by\nCovid-22 Corona Virus! Enjoy the death of your pc!\"\n\nFigure 2. Image of the pop-up message “Your PC has been infected by Covid-22 Corona\nVirus! Enjoy the death of your pc!”\n\nspeakwh.vbs uses the computer's speaker to say \"coronavirus\" in a loop\nCoronaPopup.exe displays a pop-up with the title \"Covid-22 has infected your pc!\" and\nan image of the actual coronavirus\n\nFigure 3. Image of the virus\n\nClutterScreen.exe clutters the screen by constantly moving blocks of pixels\nx.vbs displays the pop-up message, \"Corona Virus!\" 50 times\n\nFigure 4. Image of the pop-up message “Corona Virus!”\n\nnoescapes.vbs displays the pop-up message \"THERE IS NO ESCAPE\" 10 times\n\nFigure 5. Image of the pop-up message “THERE IS NO ESCAPE”\n\n\n-----\n\nicons.exe fills the screen with red Xs\n\nFigure 6. Image of the user’s screen filled with red Xs\n\nfinal.vbs displays a pop-up message \"Bye!\"\n\nFigure 7. Image of the pop-up message “BYE!!!”\n\nThese are the classic actions of joke programs usually intended to annoy or make fun of\nusers. But the next activity is not laughable at all. The malware drops and executes the\nmalicious WipeMBR.exe wiper malware that destroys the Master Boot Record (MBR)\nby overwriting its first 512 bytes with zeros. The malware then forces a machine reboot after\ndisplaying the following pop-up message:\n\nFigure 8. Final pop-up message before forcefully rebooting the compromised machine\n\nBecause MBR has information about the partitions of the hard drive and acts as a loader for\nthe operating system (OS), the compromised machine will not be able to load the OS upon\nreboot. The good news for the users is that the malware does not destroy nor steal any files\non the compromised device, meaning the victim can still recover user files from the hard\ndrive. The malware also does not demand ransom.\n\n[While the result is almost identical to another MBR wiper that Sonicwall posted a blog about](https://securitynews.sonicwall.com/xmlpost/coronavirus-trojan-overwriting-the-mbr/)\nin April 2020, our analysis did not show any resemblance in their wiper codes. This newer\nvariant simply overwrites the MBR with zeroes.\n\n## How to Repair a Damaged MBR\n\nFixing an MBR is relatively easy in modern Windows. After the affected machine reboots\n(sometimes it requires a few reboots), the system enters automatic repair mode. First,\nchoose Advanced Options, Troubleshoot. Another Advanced Option should then let you use\nthe Command Prompt. From the Command Prompt, type and run \"bootrec.exe /fixmbr\".\n\nAn alternative and more straightforward option would be to choose Startup Repair on the\nscreen to run the Command Prompt. The downside of selecting Startup Repair is that it will\ntake longer to complete the job.\n\nIf the automatic repair mode does not kick in for some reason, you'll need to boot the system\noff a recovery disk or drive. Note that you'll need to change your BIOS settings to ensure the\nsystem boots from the recovery media first, or else the system will try to boot using the\noverwritten MBR leading to a boot error. Once the system boots from recovery media, you\nshould be able to choose to run the command prompt, whereby the user can run the\ncommand \"bootrec.exe /fixmbr\".\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is also vital to remind system administrators of the importance of backing up your data on\nexternal storage in case any of your files are ever damaged, encrypted, or destroyed. You\nwill also want to create recovery media beforehand, or else you will need to use a working\nmachine, which can be difficult for home users after the damage is done.\n\n## Conclusion on COVID-22 Brings Disaster to MBR\n\nWhat looks to be a mere joke program is designed to bring destruction to impacted systems.\nThis time, luck was on the victim's side as the malware did not touch any user data, but the\nuser may not be so lucky next time. Imagine if the files on the compromised machine had\nbeen encrypted or destroyed and could not be recovered. Always be mindful of executing\nunknown files received from the internet.\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet customers are already protected from this malware by the FortiGuard Labs AntiVirus\n[Service as used by FortiGate,](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortigate) [FortiClient and](https://www.fortinet.com/products/endpoint-security/forticlient.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=endpoint-web-page) [FortiMail, and by](https://www.fortinet.com/products/email-security/fortimail.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortimail-main-page) [FortiEDR as follows:](https://www.fortinet.com/products/endpoint-security/fortiedr.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiedr)\n\nW32/Ursu.558C!tr\nMalicious_Behavior.SB\nVBS/BadJoke.8A6B!tr\nVBS/BadJoke.7182!tr\nVBS/BadJoke.84AB!tr\nVBS/BadJoke.0C12!tr\nVBS/BadJoke.DF52!tr\nW32/BadJoke.DCAB!tr\n\nFortiEDR detects the downloaded executable file as malicious based on its behavior.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**_Sample SHA-256:_**\n\n[Covid22.exe]\n\n79f3b39797f0e85d9e537397a6f8966bc288d1b83ae1c313c825fbd17698879e\n\n[ClutterScreen.exe]\n\n726DC8D52C9CF794412941BFBD27AF8F6FA27E72154A63F5C81A42BA40BD972D\n\n[CoronaPopup.exe]\n\n80C9F65617386940153CC4D42E1097DEB79B4F9C98C67E6025BDC1CA03AD8FB7\n\n[icons.exe]\n\n496CABBD18530780A3CB75340BDDD7F74A71E84C83DF4D185CFC6EC71D14C41E\n\n[WipeMBR.exe]\n\n5FC9080177A096DE2B717F2F2196867B6966900E129E5BC4E412D5DCA7ED9E60\n\n[final.vbs]\n\nEA2EF4196586BF851D4DC422A04D51AD2CB552BF5AAE2DF361D1ED2D4842B4BA\n\n\n-----\n\n[lol.vbs]\nC88D3022B25EF86CD19CE99815AD26A1F9A201F69974577DA93E08328E047410\n\n[noescapez.vbs]\n3D519FC10BC2B6CAA5A27069DA55B1614CC97C1DFD4BCDC1DD7F36E686D913F1\n\n[x.vbs]\nE22F004CF9E7C4C7B52BDA59DB2B57816992CB01FDBEF6675760FDD7BCD29728\n\n[speakwh.vbs]\n4624876389F6DDFB111FBBF3473D7C6B5555ED8A0F31C37E822A6FFEF5E27DE0\n\n[Covid22Server.exe]\n0C6DFAA12A98FB17058B79D283E96A3E34549D0AD2BE58F505AC8ABDE858D8A6\n\n_Learn more about Fortinet’s_ _[FortiGuard Labs threat research and intelligence organization](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiguard-labs)_\n_[and the FortiGuard Security Subscriptions and Services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?tab=security-bundles&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=security-bundles)_\n\n_Learn more about Fortinet’s_ _[free cybersecurity training, an initiative of Fortinet’s Training](https://www.fortinet.com/training/cybersecurity-professionals?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=campaign&utm_campaign=Freetraininginitiative)_\n_Advancement Agenda (TAA), or about the_ _Fortinet Network Security Expert_\n_[program, Security Academy program, and](https://training.fortinet.com/local/staticpage/view.php?page=fnsa&utm_source=pr&utm_campaign=fnsa)_ _[Veterans program.
