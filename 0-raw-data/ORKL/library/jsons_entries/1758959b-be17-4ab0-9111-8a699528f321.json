Among them, Avaddon stands\nout for its modus operandi and its rise.\n\nThis article describes the results of investigations conducted about this group as well as the technical analysis of a sample found in the victims\nof this ransomware.\n\n**UPDATE – 11-06-21**\n\nSince this article was written, a new event occurred on June 11, 2021: the Avaddon group stopped its activities.\n\nAccording to BleepingComputer[1], its journalists received an anonymous message, claiming to be from the FBI that contained the keys to\ndecrypt the files encrypted by Avaddon.\n\nCERT-DS has indeed confirmed that the sample files collected during previous scans have been successfully decrypted.\n\nThe Avaddon website, hosted on a hidden service of the Tor network, is unavailable, which would confirm that the group’s activity has been\nshut down.\n\nThe reasons behind this development are still unknown, but it could be related to the intensified fight against ransomware, recent events\nrelated to Colonial Pipeline[2] as well as political announcements from the United States.\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF AVADDON OPERATIONS**\n\nThe Avaddon group was first observed in February 2020 and fully began to operate as a RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) from June 2020\n\n**[1]. The ransomware acquired notoriety following a large-scale phishing campaign in which it was distributed by the Phorpiex/Trik. In this case,**\nthe fraudulent e-mails enticed victims to execute a compressed JavaScript file containing the ransomware payload. [2] [3].\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the same time, the Avaddon group started to promote its ransomware on Russian-speaking hacker forums in order to seek new affiliates\nand increase its distribution. A month later, in August 2020, the group launched its data leak website [4].\n\nSince then, the group has quickly established itself as being able to deliver powerful, customisable and well-supported ransomware. Recent\nreports indicate a resurgence of its activity, confirmed by the recent publication of numerous repositories of data stolen from organisations in a\nwide range of sectors and countries [5] [6].\n\n**THE AVADDON RAAS**\n\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) is a business model in which ransomware developers provide attackers with the whole infrastructure\nnecessary to encrypt a victim’s data. This infrastructure includes the encryption software, the payment management, the data disclosure and\nthe negotiation channel.Therefore, campaigns conducted by the Avaddon group under the RaaS model typically involve two threat actors.\nInitially, an attacker with access to an information system contacts the ransomware group. The Avaddon developers then examine the request\nas well as the credibility of the hacker’s entry point. If the request is accepted, the attackers conclude an agreement with the group to allow it to\nuse its infrastructure and the program that encrypts the data.\n\nAffiliated attackers can then use the Avaddon ransomware and pay the developers with a share of the profits generated by the ransoms paid\nby their victims (between 15 and 35% of the profits on average). The Avaddon group’s motives thus appear to be primarily lucrative, as is the\ncase with most ransomware attacks, which are usually conducted with the opportunistic intent to obtain financial gain.\n\n[1] Avaddon ransomware shuts down and releases decryption keys, BleepingComputer, https://www.\nbleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-decryption-keys/\n\n[2] Largest U.S. pipeline shuts down operations after ransomware attack, BleepingComputer, URL : https://www.\nbleepingcomputer.com/news/security/largest-us-pipeline-shuts-down-operations-after-ransomware-attack/\n\n**VICTIMOLOGY**\n\nThe Avaddon ransomware targets international public and private organisations in a wide range of sectors including IT services, wholesale and\nhealth. Recent victims include the American company American Bank Systems (ABS) [7], the Belgian consulting company Finalyse [8] and\nmore recently a Maltese political party [9] and the insurer Group AXA [10].\n\n\n-----\n\nMajor Avaddon intrusions\n\n**_Sources: Ransomwatch – DataBreaches – DomainTools – HornetSecurity_**\n\nAs a RaaS, Avaddon’s targets are therefore not chosen by its developers but by their affiliated groups. However, the group prohibits buyers\nfrom targeting countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In addition, the ransomware runs a script to identify its targets’\nlanguage during an intrusion. If it detects Russian or Ukrainian, it terminates its infection [11].\n\n**MODUS OPERANDI**\n\nAvaddon is usually distributed via phishing campaigns through e-mails containing obfuscated JPEG or ZIP attachments (which are actually\nJavaScript or Excel with macros). However, the ransomware exploits several other infection vectors, including being downloaded by other\nmalware (Smoke Loader, Phorpiex/Trik, Rigek, etc.) or distributed directly once an information system has been compromised, notably via\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Virtual Private Networks (VPN).\n\nDuring one of our investigations, Avaddon was distributed primarily due to a lack of VPN updates and insecure passwords. The actor was then\nable to gain maximum privileges on the Active Directory domain, collect and exfiltrate sensitive data, and deploy his encryption software on\nnumerous machines because of the process.\n\nA portion of the stolen data is published on a data leak website accessible on the Deep Web to give credibility to their claims and to incite the\nvictim to pay the ransom.\n\nAvaddon’s encryption mechanism avoids critical areas of the Windows system to allow the victim to use their computer and witness the\ndamages. If the ransom is not paid within ten days (240 hours), the group publishes all the stolen data on its data leak website.\n\n\n-----\n\nAvaddon Website in .onion\n\n**Source: Ransomwatch**\n\nSince January 2021, the group stated to be combining its ransomware attacks with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on its victims’\nWebsite to add additional pressure [12].\n\n**MAJOR AVADDON UPDATES**\n\nThe Avaddon ransomware has been modified and improved multiple times since the first version was released, especially regarding its\nencryption mechanism and its payload:\n\nAs early as June 2020, the developers have integrated the ability to launch the payload via Powershell to address improved detection of\nAvaddon by antivirus software;\nIn January 2021, Avaddon adds support for Windows XP and 2003;\nIn February 2021, the developers fixed a vulnerability in the ransomware encryption mechanism.\n\nThis latest update follows the release of the AvaddonDecrytper decryption tool on February 9, 2021, developed by the researcher Javier Yuste.\nHe managed to recover and analyse the ransomware encryption keys because they were stored in memory on the infected machines if they\nhad not been rebooted [13] [14].\n\nHowever, this tool allowed the Avaddon developers to realise the vulnerability of their ransomware and to implement a patch a few days later\n\n**[15].**\n\n**AVADDON MAIN FEATURES (V1)**\n\n**According to SentinelOne, the first version of Avaddon includes the following features [5]:**\n\nUnique payloads written in C++;\nFile encryption via AES256 + RSA2048, supporting full-file encryption & custom parameters;\nFull offline support, initial contact to C2 not required;\n“Impossible” 3rd party decryption ;\nSupport for

ANALYSIS**\n\n**HOW AVADDON WAS ABLE TO BREACH ITS VICTIM?**\n\n**Attack Description**\n\nThe attacker group responsible for the attacks we investigated used the Avaddon ransomware. Knowing that Avaddon is a RaaS, different\ngroups may use the ransomware. In general, attacker groups using this malware exploit the following entry points:\n\nWeak login credentials exposed on the internet (VPN SSL, RDP, etc…);\nExploitation of a vulnerability allowing them to get a foothold in the network (Fortinet, Citrix…).\n\nFigure 1 – Attack summary\n\nAs part of this attack, the group used weak credentials exposed via a firewall SSL VPN flaw. They then proceeded to guess other accounts\nbased on what they obtained. One of the accounts they found was the domain administrator.\n\nWhen the attackers were able to recover one or more firewall accesses, it was possible for them to move around the network. Exploiting the\n“EternalBlue” vulnerability, or MS17-010[3], allowed them to gain access to one of the servers. This security flaw allows an attacker to access\nthe server without authentication, but above all it allows them to get a Super Administrator access (NT/SYSTEM).\n\nFollowing this exploitation, the attacker’s group started their lateral movement in the network. The first action was to connect to other machines\nwith the domain administrator account using remote desktop protocol (RDP).\n\n\n-----\n\na y, t e attac e g oup pe o ed se e a act o s o t e et o\n\nDeployment of persistence using Cobalt Strike beacons;\nDeployment of a Mimikatz[4] executable used to retrieve credentials in memory;\nInternal network scan;\nSensitive data exfiltration.\n\nTTPs in use during the different attacks we investigated are referenced in a MITRE ATT&CK matrix at the end of the document.\n\n**Cobalt Strike Deployment**\n\nCobalt Strike[5] is a Command and Control (C2) server, which allows attackers or red teamers to control infected machines. Beacons are\nmalicious programs that allow an attacker to perform actions on the compromised machines.\n\nBeacons analysed on the information system are deployed with a Powershell script.\nThis power shell script uses the “iex” cmdlet to execute scripts, binaries or binary streams. In this case, the different steps of the power shell\ndecode base64 and execute it in memory.\n\nFigure 2 – First execution stage\n\nThis script executes a second power shell script. This one also uses the “iex” cmdlet to execute the real Cobalt Strike binary load in memory:\n\nFigure 3 – Second execution stage\n\nThe final execution step is the Cobalt Strike beacon.\n\nIt was possible to extract the beacon configuration, allowing analysts to find the C2 address and other information. Finally, when all sensitive\ndata was exfiltrated, attackers deleted the Firewall event logs and deployed the “Avaddon” ransomware.\n\n[3] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010\n\n[4] https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki\n\n[5] https://www.cobaltstrike.com/\n\n**AVADDON RANSOMWARE IN USE**\n\nThe analysed sample is a 32-bit PE Windows executable file called “exe_CLIENTNAME.en.exe“. It is compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ with\na compilation date/time group of March 09, 2021 18:35:19.\n\nWhen the executable is launched, the ransomware checks if it has privileged user rights. If not, it does not run.\n\nWhen files are encrypted, the ransomware drops the note “XXXXXX_readme.txt” in all folders with encrypted files. This note contains\ninstructions for victims to pay the ransom.\n\nAt the end of this note, an identifier is indicated. The attacker group to identify the infected machines uses this identifier.\n\n**RCID – Machiner identifier**\n\nThis identifier is represented by a base64 encoded block. Decoding this block shows two elements:\n\nFigure 4 – RCID format\n\nThe red “ID” part is a numerical value: “XXXX“. It was possible to find this value in the malware code. It can be a campaign number or a\nmalware version\n\n\n-----\n\ne ey a d t e t a sat o ecto a e a dcoded t e a a e\n\nAES key (b64) : REDACTED\nIV (b64) : REDACTED\n\nThis data contains the encrypted file extension, an “RCID”, the list of mounted disks, language of the machine and its host name.\n\nThe RCID represents the unique identifier of the compromised machine and is based on an asymmetric algorithm (RSA). Below, a summary\ndiagram of the RCID generation:\n\nFigure 5 – RCID generation\n\n**Malware configuration**\n\nThe configuration of this ransomware is encrypted using a XOR. This operation can be easily reversed when the key is known. Below are the\nmain elements extracted from the configuration:\n\n\nExtensions\nnot to\nencrypt\n\nRSA1\npublic key\n(b64)\n\nDatabase\nextension\n\nServices\nto kill\n\nProcesses\nto kill\n\n\n.exe,.bin,.sys,.ini,.dll,.lnk,.dat,.drv,.rdp,.prf,.swp\n\n**REDACTED**\n\n.mdf,.mds,.sql\n\nDefWatch,ccEvtMgr,ccSetMgr,SavRoam,dbsrv12,sqlservr,sqlagent,Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS,dbeng8,sqladhlp,QBIDPService,Culserve\n\nsqlservr.exe,sqlmangr.exe,RAgui.exe,QBCFMonitorService.exe,supervise.exe,fdhost.exe,Culture.exe,RTVscan.exe,Defwatch.exe,w\n\n\nNote ID **REDACTED**\n\n\nAES 256\nkey (b64)\n\n\n**REDACTED**\n\n\nIV (b64) **REDACTED**\n\n**D l ti** **b** **k**\n\n\n-----\n\nS ce do s, c oso t as de e oped a tec o ogy o as **o u** **e S aps ot Se** **ce o S ado** **Copy S ado** Copy a o s\nautomatic file backups to be made transparently to the user. When the ransomware starts, this feature is disabled and then the backups are\ndeleted by executing multiple wmic and wbadmin commands. Most of the commands are executed with the CreateProcessW API. These\ncommands are console applications, so they display a cmd.exe window when executed.\n\nFigure 6 – Commands execution routine\n\nNevertheless, the first wmic command differs from the others. It is executed 3 times through the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM)\ntechnology with the WBEM Locator interface. This interface allows to execute a WMI command with Win32_Process class and Create\nmethod. This method is equivalent to the previous CreateProcessW API, but it is less detectable by attack response systems. At the same\ntime, the recycle garbage is emptied of its contents with the SHEmptyRecycleBinW API.\n\n**Disabling the UAC**\n\nTo avoid user interaction during the encryption process as much as possible, UAC (User Account Control) is disabled in the registry. Thus, no\ndialog box will appear when the system requires access to administrator rights. Below the code that edits registry key EnableLUA:\n\nFigure 7 – Registry key modification in order to disabling the UAC\n\n**Searching for hidden volumes**\n\nSome volumes are mounted by different users on the same machine. Each user therefore has access to his or her own mounted volumes. In\norder to encrypt these volumes, Avaddon will disable this partitioning by modifying the registry. This modification allows all processes running\nas an administrator to access volumes mounted by users of the machine. Some volumes are also hidden. To find and encrypt them, the\nransomware will browse all volumes on the disks with the FindFirstVolume API and then attempt to mount these volumes with\n**SetVolumeMountPointW to access them:**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 – Browsing all volumes\n\n**Services and processes kill list**\n\nAvaddon cannot access some files, because they are already open by another program. For example, the files in a Microsoft SQL server\ndatabase. To overcome this problem, a routine allows stopping a selection of processes/services that are defined in the configuration.\nExamples of the code allowing deleting a service:\n\nFigure 9 – Kill list of services and process according to the malware configuration\n\n**Persistence**\n\nTo persist in the system, Avaddon copies itself into the %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ folder with the same file name. Then it installs\nitself in the Windows task scheduler using the ITaskService interface through the Microsoft COM technology. The task is set to run the\nransomware copy every 10 minutes indefinitely:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10 – Interaction with task scheduler\n\nTo avoid multiple execution of the ransomware and thus encrypting files that have already been encrypted, a mutex is created under the name:\n**Global{REDACTED}. The presence of this mutex is checked at each launch, if it is present then the program ends, because an instance of**\nAvaddon is already running.\n\n**Asynchronous Multithreading**\n\nTo encrypt as quickly as possible Avaddon will use a Windows kernel technology called I/O CompletionPorts. This technology allows to\ncreate a thread pool to handle asynchronous I/O requests efficiently on multi-core systems. Each of the threads has the task of encrypting one\nfile at a time. The number of threads created is proportional to the number of processors/cores the machine has:\n\nFigure 10 – Asynchronous multithreading\n\nThe threads are then put on hold until they are presented with a file path to encrypt.\n\n**Encryption through network**\n\nAs noted earlier the ransomware will encrypt all volumes it encounters, whether local or remote. However, Avaddon goes further by using the\nmachine’s ARP cache to discover new networks. Each new network is then fully scanned for a CIFS/SMB volume that can be mounted and\nencrypted:\n\nFigure 11 – Network enumeration using ARP cache\n\n**File encryption**\n\nAvaddon scans every file on the machine (or on remote volumes). Some file extensions are not encrypted according to the ransomware\nconfiguration, as they could affect the system stability and prevent the recovery of the ransom note and data.\n\nTo encrypt a file, Avaddon uses two modes. A first mode that allows you to specify how many bytes it should encrypt using the configuration,\nand a second mode that by default encrypts a maximum of 1048576 bytes. In our sample it is this second mode that is used. Thus beyond the\nfirst 1048576 (1000000h) bytes of a file, the data are no longer encrypted. Example of a text file :\n\nFigure 12 Data examples\n\n\n-----\n\no de to e c ypt a e, addo ge e ates a a do 56 C C c ypto qua ty S ey t t e C yptGe ey ac e s e c ypted t\na unique key per block of 8192 bytes. This key is then encrypted with the RSA public key and concatenated to the encrypted string stands for\nmalware extension (identical to the RCID). This data is then inserted at the end of the file (see next section) and the AES key is deleted. In\norder to retrieve the AES key and decrypt the file, you must have the private key that Avaddon has. Below is the summarised diagram:\n\nFigure 13 – File encryption process\n\n### 1.1.1. File identifier\n\nEach encrypted file embeds at its end, some data containing its own AES key to allow decryption. The end structure is composed as follows\n(data in little endian):\n\nEncrypted AES key using RSA;\nRSA encrypted extension ;\nIn red on 8 bytes, the size of the original file;\nIn blue on 4 bytes, the sum of the size of the blocks: AES key + the size of the extension block;\nIn green on 4 bytes, the encryption mode which corresponds here to the maximum (see previous section);\nIn yellow on 4 bytes, the Avaddon identifier (magic value);\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14 Encrypted data\n\n## 1.2.
