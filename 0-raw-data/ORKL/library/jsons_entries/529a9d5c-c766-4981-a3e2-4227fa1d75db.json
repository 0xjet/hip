We also saw\n\ncybercriminals abusing popular Web services such as\nthe instant­messaging app (IM), QQ, to communicate\n\nwith peers.\n\nToday, the Chinese underground is thriving more than\never. Previous explorations in the Chinese underground\nhave indicated that cybercriminals are quick to adapt to\n\ntechnological advancements and existing trends as\nseen throughout 2015. Data (either leaked or stolen)\nare now being traded along with prototypes and new\n\nfunctional hardware, like point­of­sales (PoS) and\nautomated teller machine (ATM) skimmers. As the\nChinese underground continues to burgeon, we expect\n\nto see more cybercriminal activity using these new\nmarket offerings: View Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal\n\nUnderground in 2015\n\n**Leaked data search engines and other offerings**\n\nData leaked in the underground allows cybercriminals to commit various crimes like financial fraud, identity and intellectual\nproperty theft, espionage, and extortion. Chinese cybercriminals have managed to enhance the way they share data as\n\nseen in the case of SheYun, a search engine created specifically to make leaked data to users available.\n\nOver the last few years, we have been keeping track of the shift of prices of goods and services traded in the Chinese\n\nunderground. Previously, we saw compromised hosts, DDoS attack tools services, and remote access Trojans (RATs)\n\nbeing sold. Today, social engineering tools have been added to the market.\n\n**Carding devices**\n\nCash transactions are slowly becoming a thing of the past, as evidenced by the adoption of electronic and mobile payment\nmeans.\n\n**PoS skimmers ­ Tampered PoS devices are sold to resellers who may or may not know that these devices are**\n\nrigged. Some PoS skimmers come with an SMS­notification feature that allows the cybercriminal to access the\nstolen data remotely every time the device is used.\n\n**ATM skimmers –Commonly sold on B2B websites, these fraud­enabling devices allowed fraudsters to carry out**\nbank fraud and actual theft. The devices have keypad overlays that are used to steal victims’ PINs.\n\n**Pocket skimmers – These small, unnoticeable magnetic card readers can store track data of up to 2,048 payment**\n\ncards. They do not need to be physically connected to a computer or a power supply to work. All captured data\n\ncan be downloaded onto a connected computer.\n\nOur paper, Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015 provides a closer look into the country's\n\nunderground market and how it has kept up with events in the real world.\n\n[Posted in Cybercrime & Digital Threats, Research, Cybercrime, Cybercriminal Underground Economy Series](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[Five Things We're Thankful for This 2015](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/5-things-thankful-for-this-2015)\n\n[Lesson Learned from ProtonMail Incident: Do Not Pay Cybercriminals](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/protonmail-incident-do-not-pay-cybercriminals)\n\n[2016 Security Predictions: The Fine Line](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/predictions/2016)\n\n[The Japanese Underground: Japan's Unique Cybercriminal Economy](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-japanese-underground)\n\n[Next­Gen Payment Processing Technologies: What They Are, and How They Work](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/security-technology/next-gen-payment-processing-technologies)\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n[Prototype Nation: The Chinese Cybercriminal Underground in 2015](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/prototype-nation-the-chinese-cybercriminal-underground-in-2015)\n\n[InstaAgent App Proves that Social Media View Scam is Still Effective](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/mobile-safety/InstaAgent-App-Proves-that-Social-Media-View-Scam-is-Still-Effective)\n\n[Hazards Ahead: Current Vulnerabilities Prelude Impending Attacks](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup)\n\n[B2B Extortion?
