But no one was breaking the law. These were just some of the\npeople taking part in Pwn2Own, one of the world’s most prestigious hacking competitions.\n\nIt was the 10th anniversary for Pwn2Own, a contest that draws elite hackers from around the\nglobe with the lure of big cash prizes if they manage to exploit previously undiscovered\nsoftware vulnerabilities, known as “zero-days.” Once a flaw is found, the details are handed\nover to the companies involved, giving them time to fix it. The hacker, meanwhile, walks\naway with a financial reward and eternal bragging rights.\n\nFor years, Chinese hackers were the most dominant forces at events like Pwn2Own, earning\nmillions of dollars in prizes and establishing themselves among the elite. But in 2017, that all\nstopped.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of China s elite hacked an iPhone…. Virtually overnight, Chinese intelligence used\nit as a weapon against a besieged minority ethnic group, striking before Apple could fix\nthe problem. It was a brazen act performed in broad daylight.\n\nIn an unexpected statement, the billionaire founder and CEO of the Chinese cybersecurity\n[giant Qihoo 360—one of the most important technology firms in China—publicly criticized](https://tech.sina.cn/i/gn/2017-09-12/detail-ifykusey8931658.d.html?vt=4)\nChinese citizens who went overseas to take part in hacking competitions. In an interview with\nthe Chinese news site Sina, Zhou Hongyi said that performing well in such events\nrepresented merely an “imaginary” success. Zhou warned that once Chinese hackers show\noff vulnerabilities at overseas competitions, they can “no longer be used.” Instead, he\nargued, the hackers and their knowledge should “stay in China” so that they could recognize\nthe true importance and “strategic value” of the software vulnerabilities.\n\n[Beijing agreed. Soon, the Chinese government banned cybersecurity researchers from](https://www.cyberscoop.com/pwn2own-chinese-researchers-360-technologies-trend-micro/)\nattending overseas hacking competitions. Just months later, a new competition popped up\ninside China to take the place of the international contests. The Tianfu Cup, as it was called,\noffered prizes that added up to over a million dollars.\n\nThe inaugural event was held in November 2018. The $200,000 top prize went to Qihoo 360\nresearcher Qixun Zhao, who showed off a remarkable [chain of exploits that allowed him to](https://blogs.360.cn/post/IPC%20Voucher%20UaF%20Remote%20Jailbreak%20Stage%202%20(EN).html)\neasily and reliably take control of even the newest and most up-to-date iPhones. From a\nstarting point within the Safari web browser, he found a weakness in the core of the iPhones\noperating system, its kernel. The result? A remote attacker could take over any iPhone that\nvisited a web page containing Qixun’s malicious code. It’s the kind of hack that can\npotentially be sold for millions of dollars on the open market to give criminals or governments\nthe ability to spy on large numbers of people. Qixun named it “Chaos.”\n\nTwo months later, in January 2019, Apple issued an update that fixed the flaw. There was\nlittle fanfare—just a quick note of thanks to those who discovered it.\n\n[But in August of that year, Google published an extraordinary analysis into a hacking](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html)\ncampaign it said was “exploiting iPhones en masse.” Researchers dissected five distinct\nexploit chains they’d spotted “in the wild.” These included the exploit that won Qixun the top\nprize at Tianfu, which they said had also been discovered by an unnamed “attacker.”\n\nThe Google researchers pointed out similarities between the attacks they caught being used\nin the real world and Chaos. What their deep dive omitted, however, were the identities of the\nvictims and the attackers: Uyghur Muslims and the Chinese government.\n\n### A campaign of oppression\n\n[For the past seven years, China has committed human rights abuses against the Uyghur](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/trump-china-xinjiang.html)\npeople and other minority groups in the Western province of Xinjiang.

The abuses add up to an](https://2017-2021.state.gov/determination-of-the-secretary-of-state-on-atrocities-in-xinjiang/index.html)\n[unprecedented high-tech campaign of oppression that dominates Uyghur lives, relying in part](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/12/surviving-the-crackdown-in-xinjiang)\non targeted hacking campaigns.\n\nChina’s hacking of Uyghurs is so aggressive that it is effectively [global, extending far beyond](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/facebook-says-chinese-hackers-used-platform-hack-uyghurs-abroad-rcna492)\nthe country’s own borders. It targets journalists, dissidents, and anyone who raises Beijing’s\nsuspicions of insufficient loyalty.\n\n[Shortly after Google’s researchers noted the attacks, media reports connected the dots: the](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/31/china-google-iphone-uyghur/)\ntargets of the campaign that used the Chaos exploit were the Uyghur people, and the\n[hackers were linked to the Chinese government. Apple published a rare blog post that](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/)\nconfirmed the attack had taken place over two months: that is, the period beginning\nimmediately after Qixun won the Tianfu Cup and stretching until Apple issued the fix.\n\n## Related Story\n\n[Apple says China’s Uighur Muslims were targeted in the recent iPhone hacking campaign](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/09/06/133138/apple-says-chinas-uighur-muslims-were-targeted-in-iphone-hacking-campaign/)\n\nThe tech giant gave a rare statement that bristled at Google’s analysis of the novel hacking\noperation.\n\n\n-----\n\nMIT Technology Review has learned that United States government surveillance\nindependently spotted the Chaos exploit being used against Uyghurs, and informed Apple.\n(Both Apple and Google declined to comment on this story.)\n\nThe Americans concluded that the Chinese essentially followed the “strategic value” plan laid\nout by Qihoo’s Zhou Hongyi; that the Tianfu Cup had generated an important hack; and that\nthe exploit had been quickly handed over to Chinese intelligence, which then used it to spy\non Uyghurs.\n\nThe US collected the full details of the exploit used to hack the Uyghurs, and it matched\nTianfu’s Chaos hack, MIT Technology Review has learned. (Google’s [in-depth examination](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/in-wild-ios-exploit-chain-5.html)\nlater noted how structurally similar the exploits are.) The US quietly informed Apple, which\nhad already been tracking the attack on its own and reached the same conclusion: the Tianfu\nhack and the Uyghur hack were one and the same. The company prioritized a difficult fix.\n\nQihoo 360 and Tianfu Cup did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When we\ncontacted Qixun Zhao via Twitter, he strongly denied involvement, although he also said he\ncouldn’t remember who came into possession of the exploit code. At first, he suggested the\nexploit wielded against Uyghurs was probably used “after the patch release.” On the\ncontrary, both Google and Apple have extensively documented how this exploit was used\nbefore January 2019. He also pointed out that his ‘Chaos’ exploit shared code from other\nhackers. In fact, within Apple and US intelligence, the conclusion has long been that these\nexploits are not merely similar—they are the same. Although Qixun wrote the exploit, there is\nnothing to suggest he was personally involved in what happened to it after the Tianfu event\n[(Chinese law](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1800/sources/2017_PRC_NationalIntelligenceLaw.pdf) [requires citizens and organizations to provide support and assistance to the](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/2015nsl/#_Toc423592316)\ncountry’s intelligence agencies whenever asked.)\n\nBy the time the vulnerabilities were closed, Tianfu had achieved its goal.\n\n“The original decision to not to allow the hackers to go abroad to competitions seems to be\nmotivated by a desire to keep discovered vulnerabilities inside of China,” says Adam Segal,\nan expert on Chinese cybersecurity policy at the Council for Foreign Relations. It also cut top\nChinese hackers from other income sources “so they are forced into a closer connection with\nthe state and established companies,” he says.\n\nThe incident is stark. One of China’s elite hacked an iPhone, and won public acclaim and a\nlarge amount of money for doing so. Virtually overnight, Chinese intelligence used it as a\nweapon against a besieged minority ethnic group, striking before Apple could fix the\nproblem. It was a brazen act performed in broad daylight and with the knowledge that there\nwould be no consequences to speak of.\n\n### Concerning links\n\n\n-----\n\nToday, the Tianfu Cup is heading into its third year, and it s sponsored by some of China s\nbiggest tech companies: Alibaba, Baidu, and Qihoo 360 are among the organizers. But\nAmerican officials and security experts are increasingly concerned about the links between\nthose involved in the competition and the Chinese military.\n\nQihoo, which is valued at over $9 billion, was one of dozens of Chinese companies added to\na [trade blacklist by the United States in 2020 after a US Department of Commerce](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/pdfs/2711-2020-bis-annual-report-final/file)\nassessment that the company might support Chinese military activity.\n\nOthers involved in the event have also raised alarms in Washington. The Beijing company\nTopsec, which helps organize Tianfu, allegedly provides hacking training, services, and\n[recruitment for the government and has employed nationalist hackers, according to US](https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/214462)\nofficials.\n\nThe company is [linked to cyber-espionage campaigns including the 2015 hack of the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/02/27/security-firm-finds-link-between-china-and-anthem-hack/)\n[insurance giant Anthem, a connection that was accidentally exposed when hackers used the](https://threatconnect.com/blog/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/)\nsame server to try to break into a US military contractor and to host a Chinese university\nhacking competition.\n\n## Related Story\n\n[Hackers are finding ways to hide inside Apple’s walled garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/01/1020089/apple-walled-garden-hackers-protected/)\n\nThe iPhone’s locked-down approach to security is spreading, but advanced hackers have\nfound that higher barriers are great for avoiding capture.\n\n\n-----\n\nOther organizers and sponsors include NSFocus, which grew directly out of the earliest\nChinese nationalist hacker movement called the Green Army, and Venus Tech, a [prolific](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/world/asia/in-china-hacking-has-widespread-acceptance.html)\n[Chinese military contractor that has been linked to offensive hacking.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/214462)\n\nOne other Tianfu organizer, the state-owned Chinese Electronics Technology Group, has a\n[surveillance subsidiary called Hikvision, which provides “Uyghur analytics” and facial](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tech-uighurs/chinese-tech-patents-tools-that-can-detect-track-uighurs-idUSKBN29I300)\nrecognition tools to the Chinese government. It was added to a US trade blacklist in 2019.\n\nUS experts say the links between the event and Chinese intelligence are clear, however.\n\n“I think it is not only a venue for China to get zero-days but it’s also a big recruiting venue,”\nsays Scott Henderson, an analyst on the cyber espionage team at FireEye, a major security\ncompany based in California.\n\nTianfu’s links to Uyghur surveillance and genocide show that getting early access to bugs\n[can be a powerful weapon. In fact, the “reckless” hacking spree that Chinese groups](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/10/1020596/how-chinas-attack-on-microsoft-escalated-into-a-reckless-hacking-spree/)\nlaunched against Microsoft Exchange in early 2021 bears some striking similarities.\n\nIn that case, a Taiwanese researcher uncovered the security flaws and passed them to\nMicrosoft, which then [privately shared them with security partners. But before a fix could be](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-probing-whether-leak-played-role-in-suspected-chinese-hack-11615575793)\nreleased, Chinese hacking groups started exploiting the flaw all around the world. Microsoft,\nwhich was forced to rush out a fix two weeks earlier than planned, is investigating the\npotential that the bug was leaked.\n\nThese bugs are incredibly valuable, not just in financial terms, but in their capacity to create\nan open window for espionage and oppression.\n\n[Google researcher Ian Beer said as much in the original report detailing the exploit chain. “I](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/a-very-deep-dive-into-ios-exploit.html)\nshan’t get into a discussion of whether these exploits cost $1 million, $2 million, or $20\nmillion,” he wrote. “I will instead suggest that all of those price tags seem low for the\ncapability to target and monitor the private activities of entire populations in real time.”\n\n\n-----",
