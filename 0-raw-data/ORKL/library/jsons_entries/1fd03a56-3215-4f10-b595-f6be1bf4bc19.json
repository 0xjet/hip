In many instances, this is due to what we\ncall a supply-chain attack, where a threat actor targets one company that acts as an\nintermediary to others.\n\nIn today’s case, the targeted websites all reside on the same server and sell video content\n[from various conferences and conventions. The host control panel belongs to Playback Now,](https://www.playbacknow.com/)\na company that provides its customers with an array of services to capture and deliver\nrecorded material into an online conference experience.\n\n\n-----\n\nCriminals decided to impersonate Playback Now by registering a malicious domain lexically\nclose to their official website that could be used to discreetly serve a credit card skimmer as\nwell as collect stolen data.\n\nTheir next move was to inject a malicious reference to this skimmer code into dozens of\nMagento sites hosted on the same IP address belonging to Playback Now. As a result, the\nfinancial details from customers shopping for conference material are now at risk.\n\n## Online conference sites compromised with Inter skimming kit\n\nPlayback Now provides organizations with an easy way to seamlessly convert an event into\nan online virtual experience. Conferences and seminars can be delivered via live streaming,\non demand, or a hybrid of the two.\n\nTheir offering of a virtual conference expo hall seems like a timely solution during the\npandemic for organizers and exhibitors to connect with customers just like at an in-person\nevent.\n\nFigure 1:\n\nLegitimate PlayBack Now website\n\n\n-----\n\nBusinesses or organizations that want to join the experience can get a dedicated website\nfrom where they will serve and promote their content. Take the following website built for the\nAssociation of Healthcare Internal auditors.\n\nOnce users have registered and purchased one of the packages, they can access recorded\nsessions online or save them onto a flash drive.\n\nFigure 2: A Playback Now customer site that has been compromised\nA closer look at the website’s source code reveals an external reference to a JavaScript file.\nIt would be easy to overlook, thinking it is served from the legitimate Playback Now website\n(playbacknow.com), but there is an extra ‘s’ in that domain name (playbacknows[.]com) that\ngives it away.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat domain was registered only a couple of weeks ago and its home page is void of any\ncontent.\n```\nDomain name: playbacknows.com\nCreation Date: 2020-09-21T20:22:10.00Z\nRegistrar: NAMECHEAP INC\nRegistrant Name: WhoisGuard Protected\nRegistrant Street: P.O. Box 0823-03411 \nRegistrant City: Panama\n\n```\nIn total, we detected the reference to this domain in over 40 websites belonging to different\norganizations (see the IOCs section of this blogpost).\n\nThis JavaScript is a skimmer that has been lightly obfuscated and contains a certain number\nof strings that are a common marking for the Inter skimming kit.\n\nFigure 3: Checkout page where skimmer will steal credit card data\nWhen someone purchases a course or conference recording, their personal and credit card\ndata will be leaked to criminals via the same malicious domain housing the skimmer.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Breach possibly related to Magento 1.x exploit\n\nAll affected Playback Now customer sites are running on the same IP address at\n209.126.18.3. Using VirusTotal Graph we can see an interesting connection with a piece of\n[malware we previously documented.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/02/new-golang-brute-forcer-discovered-amid-rise-e-commerce-attacks/)\n\nFigure 4: VirusTotal graph showing a connection between malware and hosting server\nThis GoLang sample attempts to bruteforce access into a variety of Content Management\nSystems. If successful, attackers could use the gained credentials to inject malicious code\ninto e-commerce sites.\n\nThis connection was interesting but lost some value when we looked at the submission date\nfor this sample to VirusTotal. It’s quite likely that the server was pinged just like many others,\nbut it’s unclear whether it would have resulted in a breach, even at a later date.\n\nBased on an analysis of the compromised Playback Now related sites, we found they were\n[running a vulnerable version of the Magento CMS, namely version 1.x. Following the release](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/results/www.playbackahia.com)\n[of an exploitation tool, a wave of attacks was recently observed, compromising over two](https://www.zdnet.com/article/magento-online-stores-hacked-in-largest-campaign-to-date/)\nthousand sites.\n\nGiven the timeline, this incident could have been leveraging the same exploit and be carried\nout by the same or perhaps a different group.\n\nThe official website playbacknow.com is hosted on 209.126.18.3 as well, but it does not\n[appear to be compromised. One thing to note though is that it is running a different CMS,](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/results/playbacknow.com)\nnamely WordPress version 5.4.\n\nWe contacted Playback Now to report this breach. In the meantime, Malwarebytes Browser\nGuard detects and blocks the fraudulent skimmer domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Malwarebytes Browser Guard blocking this attack\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nSkimmer\n```\nplaybacknows[.]com/playback/index.js\n\n```\nCompromised sites\n\n**Website** **Organization**\n\nplaybacknar[.]com National Association of Realtors\n\nnaraei[.]playbacknow[.]com National Association of Realtors\n\nnais[.]playbacknow[.]com National Association of Independent Schools\n\nnasmm[.]playbacknow[.]com National Association of Senior Move Managers\n\n\n-----\n\ntripleplay[.]playbacknow[.]com Triple Play\n\ndigitaldealer[.]playbacknow[.]com Digital Dealer\n\nplaybackaaj[.]com American Association for Justice\n\nplaybackacp[.]com American College of Physicians\n\nplaybacksmilesource[.]com Smile Source\n\nplaybackc21[.]com Century 21 University\n\nplaybackada[.]com American Diabetes Association\n\nplaybacknailba[.]com NAILBA\n\nplaybackswana[.]com SWANA\n\nplaybacknaspa[.]com NASPA\n\nplaybackaupresses[.]com Association of University Presses\n\nplaybacknacba[.]com NACBA\n\nplaybackaca[.]com ACA International\n\nplaybacknala[.]com NALA Paralegal Association\n\nplaybacknatp[.]com National Association of Tax Professionals\n\niplayback[.]com –\n\nplaybackcore[.]com –\n\nplaybackndsc[.]com National Down Syndrome Congress\n\nplaybackaata[.]com American Art Therapy Association\n\nplaybacksnrs[.]com Southern Nursing Research Society\n\nplaybackssp[.]com Society for Scholarly Publishing\n\nplaybackcaregiving[.]com Caregiving\n\nplaybackcas[.]com Casualty Actuarial Society\n\nplaybackmpc[.]com Midwest Podiatry Conference\n\nplaybackhinman[.]com Hinman Dental\n\nplaybacknetworker[.]com Psychotherapy Networker\n\n\n-----\n\nplaybacknara[.]com National Association for Regulatory Administration\n\naspcvirtualsummit[.]org American Society for Preventive Cardiology\n\nplaybackfgs[.]com National Genealogy Society\n\nplaybackifa[.]com International Franchise Association\n\nplaybackashe[.]com Association for the Study of Higher Education\n\nplaybackippfa[.]com IPPFA\n\nplaybackahri[.]com Air Conditioning Heating Refrigeration Institute\n\nplaybackaonl[.]com American Organization for Nursing Leadership\n\nplaybackngs[.]com National Genealogy Society\n\nplaybackrlc[.]com Restaurant Law Center\n\nplaybackahia[.]com Association of Healthcare Internal Auditors\n\nplaybacknacac[.]com National Association for College Admission Counseling\n\nServer hosting compromised sites\n```\n209.126.18.3\n\n```\n\n-----",
