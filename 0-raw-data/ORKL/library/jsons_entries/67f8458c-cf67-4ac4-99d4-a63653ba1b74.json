In fact, the opposite is true – October has seen\nthreats like ZLoader and HoneyGain have continued to evolve. Meanwhile, STRRAT has\nwreaked havoc by enabling bad actors to steal credentials and install additional malware.\n\nIn today’s Threat Spotlight blog, we break these threats down for you and walk through\nwhich Cisco Secure products can help protect your network. If you want to learn more about\n[these threats, register for our on-demand webinar today!](https://learn-umbrella.cisco.com/threat-intelligence/threat-spotlight-series-episode-2?utm_medium=web-referral&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=UMB-FY22-Q1-threat-spotlight-strrat-zloader-honeygain&utm_term=pgm&utm_content=UMB-FY22-Q1-NA-0930-Webinar-Threat-Spotlight-Series-Episode-Two)\n\n## Threat Name: STRRAT\n\n**Threat Type: RAT**\n\n**Delivery and Exfiltration:**\n\n\n-----\n\nSTRRAT Attack Chain\n**Description: STRRAT is a Java-based Remote Access Tool (RAT) that does not require a**\npre-installed Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It is mainly distributed through malicious\nspam (malspam) campaigns. The malware installs RDPWrap, steals credentials, logs\nkeystrokes, and remotely controls Windows systems. It also contains a ransomware module.\n\n**STRRAT Spotlight: STRRAT campaigns utilize malspam as a means of initial access. If a**\nvictim opens a weaponized email attachment and enables macros within the document on a\nvulnerable Windows host, the macro code downloads a zip archive containing a JRE, an\nencrypted and obfuscated .jar file, and a script to run STRRAT using the JRE from the zip\narchive. The RAT focuses on stealing passwords via keylogging, as well as stored web\nbrowser and email client credentials. It supports the following browsers and email clients:\n\nFirefox\nInternet Explorer\nChrome\nFoxmail\nOutlook\nThunderbird\n\nSTRRAT also installs RDPWrap, an open source tool that enables Remote Desktop support\non Windows. What’s more, STRRAT contains a ransomware module. Features and\ncommands it supports are similar to other RATs, including the ability to download and\nexecute additional malware.\n\n**Target Geolocations: Austria, Canada, Germany, Spain, UK, USA**\n\n**Target Data: User Credentials, Browser Data, Sensitive Information**\n\n**Target Businesses: Any**\n\n**Exploits: N/A**\n\n**Mitre Att&ck for STRAAT**\n\n**Initial Access: Malspam**\n\n**Persistence: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder Scheduled Task/Job**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Execution: Scheduled Task/Job**\n**Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information**\n**Collection: Automated Collection, Keylogging**\n**Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocol**\n**Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel**\n\n**IOCs**\n\n**Domains:**\nlauzon-ent[.]com\njbfrost[.]liveidgerowner[.]duckdns[.]org\nadamridley.co[.]uk\nalfredoscafeltd.co[.]uk\nbentlyconstbuild.co[.]uk\nbuildersworlinc.co[.]uk\nfillinaresortsltd.co[.]uk\ngossyexperience.co[.]uk\njeffersonsandc.co[.]uk\njpfletcherconsultancy.co[.]uk\nmetroscaffingltg.co[.]uk\npg-finacesolutions.co[.]uk\nplayerscircleinc.co[.]uk\nsivospremiumclub.co[.]uk\ntg-cranedinc.co[.]uk\ntk-consultancyltd.co[.]uk\nwestcoasttrustedtaxis.co[.]uk\nzincocorporation.co[.]uk\nwshsoft[.]company\n\n**IPs:**\n54.202.26[.]55\n104.248.53[.]108\n37.0.8[.]76\n\n**Additional Information:**\n[STRRAT-Crimson](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/strrat-crimson)\n[InfoSec Handlers Diary Blog](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/27798)\n\n**Which Cisco Products Can Block:**\nAMP\nCWS\nNetwork Security\nSecure Network Analytics\nSecure Cloud Analytics\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat Grid\nUmbrella\nWSA\n\n## Threat Name: ZLoader (Terdot or Zbot)\n\n**Threat Type: Loader**\n\n**Delivery and Exfiltration: The ZLoader attack utilizes three methods of infection.**\n\nZLoader Attack Chain no. 1\n\nZLoader Attack Chain no. 2\n\n\n-----\n\nZLoader Attack Chain no. 3\n**Description: ZLoader (also known as Terdot and Zbot) is a banking trojan that was first**\nobserved in 2016. It is still under active development and many versions have appeared\nsince December 2019. It acts as a backdoor to infected systems and has the ability to\ndownload additional malware. It also implements web injection to steal cookies, passwords,\nand sensitive information. ZLoader targets users of financial institutions and has been used\nto deliver ransomware from Egregor and Ryuk families.\n\n**ZLoader Spotlight: Recent Zloader campaigns used multiple initial attack vectors. Among**\nthese are the Malsmoke malvertising campaign, phishing campaigns with malspam, and a\nmalvertising campaign abusing advertisements published through Google Adwords. A recent\nevolution of the infection chain includes dynamic agent creation to download malicious\npayloads from a remote server. The malware can disable Windows Defender and relies on\nsystem binaries and scripts (living-off-the-land, or LOLBAS) in order to evade detection.\nZLoader leverages process injection to contact its command and control server using a\nDomain Generation Algorithm (DGA). Once it identifies a responding domain, optional\nmodules and a possible update to ZLoader is downloaded.\n\n**Target Geolocations: Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Spain, USA**\n**Target Data: User Credentials, Browser Data, Sensitive Information**\n**Target Businesses: Any**\n**Exploits: N/A**\n\n**Mitre Att&ck for ZLoader**\n**Initial Access: Malspam, Malvertising, Drive-by Compromise**\n**Persistence: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder,**\nCompromise Client Software Binary\n**Privilege Escalation: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**\n**Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell**\n**Evasion: Process Injection: Thread Execution Hijacking, Signed Binary Proxy Execution,**\nSigned Binary Proxy Execution: Msiexec Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32 Impair\n\n\n-----\n\nDefenses: Disable or Modify Tools, Subvert Trust Controls: Code Signing\n**Collection: Man in the Browser**\n**Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols**\n**Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel**\n\n**IOCs**\n\n**Domains:**\nlandingmonster[.]online\npornguru[.]online\npornislife[.]online\nheavenlygem[.]com\nmoviehunters[.]site\npornofilmspremium[.]com\nwebsekir[.]com\nteam-viewer[.]site\nzoomvideo[.]site\niqowijsdakm[.]ru\nwiewjdmkfjn[.]ru\ndksaoidiakjd[.]su\niweuiqjdakjd[.]su\nyuidskadjna[.]su\nolksmadnbdj[.]su\nodsakmdfnbs[.]com\nodsakjmdnhsaj[.]com\nodjdnhsaj[.]com\nodoishsaj[.]com\n\n**IPs:**\n194.58.108[.]89\n195.24.66[.]70\n\n**Additional Information:**\n[Malsmoke Malvertising Campaign](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/11/malsmoke-operators-abandon-exploit-kits-in-favor-of-social-engineering-scheme/)\n[Silent Night Campaign](https://www.malwarebytes.com/resources/files/2020/05/the-silent-night-zloader-zbot_final.pdf)\n[Google Adwords Malvertising Campaign](https://assets.sentinelone.com/sentinellabs/SentinelLabs-Zloader)\n[New Infection Technique](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/zloader-with-a-new-infection-technique/)\n\n**Which Cisco Products Can Block:**\nAMP\nCWS\nNetwork Security\nSecure Network Analytics\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat Grid\nUmbrella\nWSA\n\n## Threat Name: HoneyGain\n\n**Threat Type: Potentially Unwanted Application**\n\n**Delivery and Exfiltration:**\n\n\n-----\n\nHoneyGain Attack Chain\n**Description: HoneyGain is a is legitimate software that can be used to proxy clients’**\nconnections for money. However, due to increased popularity, malicious actors started to\ndistribute Trojanized versions of this software bundled with malicious payload. This packed\nmalware contains a complete set of monetization methods, including a Trojanized version of\n\n\n-----\n\nthe HoneyGain proxyware client, an XMRig miner, and an information stealer. The campaign\ncontinues to evolve, with the recent deployment of Nanowire client, another proxyware\napplication with similar functionality.\n\n**HoneyGain Spotlight: A variety of different malware families are being distributed under the**\nguise of legitimate installers for applications like HoneyGain. These trojanized installers\nenable adversaries to distribute threats such as RATs, information stealers, and other\nmalware to victims who believe they are installing legitimate applications. Associated\nmalware was also observed leveraging victims’ CPU resources to mine cryptocurrency, while\nalso monetizing their network bandwidth using proxyware applications. One of the most\ncommon techniques observed is the use of legitimate installers as decoy programs included\nalongside other malicious components. In these attacks, threat actors are distributing\nmalicious executables posing as installers for legitimate proxyware applications like\nHoneyGain. When executed, they will typically install the legitimate application while silently\ninstalling malware.\n\n**Target Geolocations: World-Wide**\n**Target Data: Browser Data, Sensitive Data**\n**Target Businesses: Any**\n**Exploits: N/A**\n\n**Mitre Att&ck for HoneyGain**\n**Persistence: Scheduled Task/Job, Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, Windows Service**\n**Execution: Scheduled Task, Native API**\n**Evasion: N/A**\n**Collection: N/A**\n**Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols**\n**Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel**\n\n**IOCs**\n\n**Domains:**\nariesbee[.]com\nbootesbee[.]com\naurigabee[.]xyz\nanalytics[.]honeygain[.]com\napi[.]honeygain[.]com\ndownload[.]honeygain[.]com\nwww[.]xsvpn[.]cf\nterminist-journal[.]000webhostapp[.]com\nr[.]honeygain[.]money\n\n\n-----\n\n**URLs:**\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/vhpmmwns1k9wh33/Honeygain.zip?dl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/rfbrftww47y0edv/nanowire.exe?dl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/7hy2ausr3rouflp/nanowire.toml?dl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/gq3tt6iawri6m3w/user.config?dl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/puz02l0l7a4wjmt/beehive.txt?dl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/gp7s712krr67kcx/MinerDownloader-1-23-21.txt?dl=1\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/uc?id=0BxsMXGfPIZfSVzUyaHFYVkQxeFk&export=download\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/zhp1b06imehwylq/Synaptics.rar?dl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/ve1i21h0ubslnkr/xmrig2.txt?dl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/h5lge8h8rhw93rh/Stealer%201-23-21.txt?dl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/8jyj3a5vw1bwot9/ChromePass.txt?dl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/v8x3jnnx15hjz04/WebBrowserPassView.txt?dl=1\nhxxps://r.honeygain[.]money/SAMIBDC7\nhxxps://iplogger[.]org/2jbNj6\nhxxps://iplogger[.]org/2azxA5\nhxxp://www.xsvpn[.]cf/ssr-download/readme.md\n\n**Stealer Exfiltration URL:**\nhxxps://terminist-journal.000webhostapp[.]com/donkeydick.php\n\n**Additional Information:**\n[HoneyGain](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/08/proxyware-abuse.html)\n\n**Which Cisco Products Can Block:**\nAMP\nCWS\nNetwork Security\nSecure Network Analytics\nSecure Cloud Analytics\nThreat Grid\nUmbrella\nWSA\n\n## Want to Learn More About This Month’s Leading Cyberattacks?\n\nRegister for our [on-demand webinar today to learn more about how these threats operate](https://learn-umbrella.cisco.com/threat-intelligence/threat-spotlight-series-episode-2?utm_medium=web-referral&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=UMB-FY22-Q1-threat-spotlight-strrat-zloader-honeygain&utm_term=pgm&utm_content=UMB-FY22-Q1-NA-0930-Webinar-Threat-Spotlight-Series-Episode-Two)\nand what you can do to protect your network against them.\n\n\n-----",
