D-Link no longer sells](http://forums.dlink.com/index.php?topic=51407.0)\nthe DNS-320 enclosure but the product page indicates that it is still supported. However, the\n[newest firmware revision came out in 2016 and there are plenty of known bugs that can be](https://support.dlink.com/ProductInfo.aspx?m=DNS-320)\nleveraged to compromise the equipment.\n\n[Scanning the malicious ELF binary on Thursday showed a minimum detection rate on](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/9a1de00dbc07271a27cb4806937802007ae5a59433ca858d52678930253f42c1/detail)\nVirusTotal, with only one antivirus engine identifying Cr1ptT0r as a threat. At the time of\npublishing, the malware is picked up by at least six antivirus engines.\n\n## Old firmware is a sitting duck\n\nDetails are scarce at the moment, but BleepingComputer forum members offer information\nsuggesting that the attack vector is most likely vulnerabilities in old firmware. A member of\nthe Cr1ptT0r team confirmed this to us, saying that there are so many vulnerabilities in DLink DNS-320 NAS models that they should be built from scratch to make things better.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough old versions of the firmware for DNS-320 are known to be vulnerable to at least\n[one bug leading to remote code execution, a hard-coded backdoor was published in 2018](http://roberto.greyhats.it/advisories/20120208-dlink-rce.txt)\nfor [ShareCenter DNS‑320L.](https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en/products/dns-320l-sharecenter-2-bay-cloud-storage-enclosure)\n\nSome users affected by Cr1ptT0r admitted to having an outdated firmware version installed\nand that their device was exposed to the internet at the time of the attack.\n\nThe malware drops two plain text files on the infected devices. One is the ransom note\ncalled \"_FILES_ENCRYPTED_README.txt,\" which gives information to the victim on how\nto get more details about what happened and how to reach the ransomware operators to\npay the ransom in exchange for the file decryption key.\n\nh/t Desdra\nThe ransom note points the victim to the Cr1ptT0r decryption service, which holds the same\ncontact details and the steps for getting the unlock key.\n\nTo verify that they can decrypt the data, the operators offer to unlock the first file for free.\n\nThe other text file has the name \"_cr1ptt0r_support.txt\" and stores the address of a website\nin the Tor network. This is a support URL that victims can provide if they are at a loss about\nwhat to do; it enables a remote shell on an infected device if it is online. The Cr1ptT0r group\nmember added that the URLs and IP addresses are not logged, so there is no correlation\nbetween data and the victim.\n\nAlthough the Cr1ptT0r member says they are just interested in getting paid and that spying\nis not on their agenda, they cannot guarantee privacy.\n\n## Synolocker decryption keys also available\n\n[Keys for unlocking files are sold via OpenBazaar marketplace, for BTC 0.30672022 (about](https://openbazaar.com/store/home/QmcVHJWngBD67hhqXipFvhHcgv1RYLBGcpthew7d9pC3rq)\n$1,200 at the current Bitcoin price). There is also an option to pay less for individual file\ndecryption. The cost for this is $19.99 and you have to send the encrypted file to receive it\n\n\n-----\n\ndecrypted.\n\nA recent update to the OpenBazaar store page shows that the operator of the\n[ransomware also offers decryption keys for Synolocker for the same price. This](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/543426/synolocker-ransomware-targets-synology-nas-devices/)\n[ransomware strain did serious damage back in 2014 when it infected NAS servers from](https://www.synology.com/en-global/security/advisory/SynoLocker)\nSynology that ran outdated versions of the DiskStation Manager containing two\nvulnerabilities. This was possible despite the vendor releasing the patches at least eight\nmonths before.\n\nThe crew behind Synolocker shut down their website in mid-2014 and offered to sell in bulk\nall the unclaimed decryption key they had for 200 BTC (about $100,000 at the time), over\n5,500 of them. The [crew announced that when all the databases would be permanently](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002733.html)\ndeleted when closing the website.\n\nToday, matching the private key that unlocks the data in lack of a victim ID is possible via by\nbrute-forcing, a process that is fairly quick in this case, with a few minutes to complete, the\nransomware handler told us.\n\n## No extension added to locked files\n\nThe ransomware, which is an ELF ARM binary, does not append a specific extension to the\n[encrypted data, but security researcher Michael Gillespie did a brief analysis of the malware](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nand the files it encrypts and found it added the end-of-file marker \"_Cr1ptT0r_\"\n\n\n-----\n\nfile\n\nmarker, h/t [@demonslay335](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nHe also says that the strings he noticed suggest that this ransomware strain uses the\n[Sodium crypto library and that it uses the \"curve25519xsalsa20poly1305\" algorithm for](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/03/06/announcing-sodium-a-new-cryptographic-library/)\nasymmetric encryption. We received confirmation about these details from the\nCr1ptT0r group member we talked to.\n\nThe public key (256-bit) used for encrypting the data is available in a separate file named\n\"cr1ptt0r_logs.txt,\" which stores a list of the encrypted files as well, and it is also appended\nat the end of the encrypted files, just before the marker. Gillespie says that it matches the\nencryption algorithm he noted above.\n\nAt the moment, the ransomware handler seems interested in targeting NAS devices, which\nare popular with small businesses to store and share data internally. This is likely the\nreason for the steep ransom demand.\n\nCr1ptT0r is new on the market, but it looks like it's planning a long stay. It is built for Linux\nsystems, with a focus on embedded devices, but it can be adapted to Windows, too,\naccording to its maker. The end game is making money, and, as someone familiar with this\nsort of business told us, it can have an almost infinite return on investment. The malware\ndoes not have a significant presence at the moment but it could turn into a nasty threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Update 2/27/19: D-Link issued a security advisory for this ransomware.](https://securityadvisories.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10110)**\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[QNAP alerts NAS customers of new DeadBolt ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-alerts-nas-customers-of-new-deadbolt-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[QNAP warns of ransomware targeting Internet-exposed NAS devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-warns-of-ransomware-targeting-internet-exposed-nas-devices/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Hash:\n```\n9a1de00dbc07271a27cb4806937802007ae5a59433ca858d52678930253f42c1\n\n File names:\ncr1ptt0r\n\n Ransom note text:\nAll your files have been encrypted using strong encryption!\nFor more information visit our website:\nhttps://openbazaar.com/store/home/QmcVHJWngBD67hhqXipFvhHcgv1RYLBGcpthew7d9pC3rq\nIf the website is unavailable you need to download the OpenBazaar application from:\nhttps://openbazaar.org/download/\nYou can then visit the store via this url:\nob://QmcVHJWngBD67hhqXipFvhHcgv1RYLBGcpthew7d9pC3rq/store\nWe are also reachable via these instant messaging sotwares:\ntoxchat: https://tox.chat/download.html\nUser ID:\nAE737ECB916BE24B41543BAD5B24710C5B9DB701592013A6EBBCC0A544931E6145C7D950B82F\nbitmessage: https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page\nUser ID: BM-NBcQxmkfyoVxSRE8WJQqEbXw1s63CMEq\nKind regards from the Cr1ptT0r team.\n\n```\n[Cr1ptT0r](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cr1ptt0r/)\n[DLink](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/dlink/)\n[NAS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nas/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
