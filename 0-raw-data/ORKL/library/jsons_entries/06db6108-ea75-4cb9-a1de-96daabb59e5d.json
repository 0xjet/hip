More_eggs is malicious software containing several components engineered to steal\nvaluable credentials, including usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts,\nemail accounts and IT administrator accounts, among others.\n\nTRU has uncovered a more_eggs phishing campaign where hackers are posing as job\napplicants and luring Corporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are\nresumes from job applicants. However, the bogus resumes contain the more_eggs malware.\n\nThus far, TRU has discovered and shut down four separate security incidents relating to the\ncurrent more_eggs campaign. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and the\norganizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense company; a large UK-based\n\n\n-----\n\nCPA firm; an international business law firm based out of Canada; and a national Canadian\nstaffing agency. TRU has produced a full report outlining their findings and how best to\nprotect against the current more_eggs threat.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\neSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) research team has discovered a new threat\ncampaign using the more_eggs malware.\nMore_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that contains components engineered to steal\nusernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email accounts and IT\nadministrator accounts, among others.\nThe current more_eggs campaign involves hackers posing as job applicants and luring\nCorporate Hiring Managers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job\napplicants. In actuality, the resumes contain the more_eggs malware.\nTRU has detected and shut down four different more_eggs security incidents recently.\nThree of them occurred at the end of March, and they all involve the new variant of\nmore_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.-based aerospace/defense\ncompany that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair for airline\ncomponents; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based out\nof Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.\nOne year ago, TRU also discovered a spearphishing campaign infecting victims with\nmore_eggs. However, during that operation, the threat actors were targeting\nprofessionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs, as opposed to Hiring Managers\nlooking for job candidates. The hackers sent the job seekers .zip files disguised as job\noffers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the installation of more_eggs.\n\n## Research Report\n\nA more_eggs malware campaign has appeared, just as it did last year during the Easter\n[season. eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) security research team has discovered a](https://www.esentire.com/)\nphishing campaign where hackers are posing as job applicants and luring Corporate Hiring\nManagers into downloading what they believe are resumes from job applicants. However, the\nbogus resumes contain the more_eggs malware.\n\nMore_eggs is a stealthy, lethal malware that has several components engineered to steal\nvaluable credentials, such as usernames and passwords for corporate bank accounts, email\naccounts and IT administrator accounts, among others. Once accessed, the hackers\nexfiltrate data from the victim organization, spread to other computer hosts via TeamViewer,\nand encrypt files. The [Golden Chickens group (aka Venom Spider) is believed to be the](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/07/golden-chickens-evolution-of-the-maas/)\nthreat operators behind more_eggs. Interestingly, several top financial cybercrime groups,\nincluding the infamous FIN6 gang, Evilnum and the Cobalt Group have employed the\nmore_eggs malware in their attack campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Current More_Eggs Operation – a Déjà Vu of the 2021 LinkedIn Campaign?\n\nIronically, around the same time last year in April 2021, TRU discovered a spearphishing\ncampaign which was infecting victims with more_eggs. However, during that campaign,\nrather than posing as hopeful job candidates sending a poisoned resume, the threat actors\n[targeted professionals on LinkedIn who were looking for jobs. The hackers sent the job](https://www.esentire.com/security-advisories/hackers-spearphish-professionals-on-linkedin-with-fake-job-offers-infecting-them-with-malware-warns-esentire)\nseekers .zip files disguised as job offers. When the targets opened the zip file, it led to the\ninstallation of more_eggs. The threat actors behind the campaign tried enticing the targets\ninto clicking on the zip file by naming the file after the job seeker’s current job title and adding\n“position” at the end.\n\nFor example, if the LinkedIn member’s job is listed as ‘Senior Account Executive—\nInternational Freight,’ the malicious zip file would be titled ‘Senior Account Executive —\nInternational Freight position.’ Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiated\nthe installation of more_eggs.\n\n## eSentire’s TRU Disrupts Attacks Against an Aerospace/Defense Company, International Law Firm, International CPA Firm and Staffing Agency\n\nThus far, in the current more_eggs campaign, the eSentire TRU team has discovered and\nshut down four separate security incidents. Three of them occurred at the end of March, and\nthey all involve the new variant of more_eggs. The organizations attacked include a U.S.based aerospace/defense company that designs, develops and provides maintenance repair\nfor airline components; a large UK-based CPA firm; an international business law firm based\nout of Canada; and a national Canadian staffing agency.\n\nThe threat actors behind the current more_ eggs campaign don´t appear to be randomly\ntargeting companies. For example, the CPA firm and the staffing agency, both list a job\nposting on Indeed.com and LinkedIn which match the title of the resume each hiring\nmanager received. The aerospace/defense company also had a job listed on zip\nRecruiter.com which matches the title of the fake resume received.\n\n## What are the Hackers After?\n\nSince these more_eggs attacks were disrupted, the TRU team cannot know with certainty\nwhat the end game is for this operation or what threat group is behind these attacks. What\nwe do know is that this current activity demonstrates a role-reversal from last year’s\n[more_eggs LinkedIn campaign. We also know that the more_eggs Malware-as-a-Service](https://www.esentire.com/security-advisories/hackers-spearphish-professionals-on-linkedin-with-fake-job-offers-infecting-them-with-malware-warns-esentire)\n[(MaaS) is known to be utilized by the very capable FIN6,](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf) [Evilnum and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evilnum-hackers-use-the-same-malware-supplier-as-fin6-cobalt/) [Cobalt cybercriminals.](https://cyware.com/news/the-tale-of-the-prolific-cobalt-threat-groups-massive-phishing-campaigns-against-financial-institutions-fedafe34)\n\n\n-----\n\nOf course, for a threat group to get a foothold into the IT environments of an aerospace/\ndefense company, an international law firm, an international CPA firm and a national\ncorporate staffing agency could be very lucrative. Successfully infecting a corporate\nemployee with the more_eggs malware could potentially enable a threat actor(s) to commit a\nvariety of cybercrimes including deploying ransomware, stealing intellectual property, stealing\ncredentials to corporate bank accounts, or committing business email compromise, among\nothers.\n\n## Connection Between FIN6, Evilnum, Cobalt Group and More_Eggs\n\n**FIN6 - FIN6 is a financial cybercrime group that primarily steals payment card data and sells**\nit on underground marketplaces. The FIN6 group first gained notoriety in 2014 for their\nattacks against point-of-sale (POS) machines in retail outlets and hospitality companies.\nContinuing their quest for credit and debit card data, they later moved on to targeting eCommerce companies and stole their credit card data via online skimming. The FIN6 threat\ngroup has also been known to infect some of their victims with ransomware.\n\n[Interestingly, intelligence analysts with Visa reported in February2019 that at the end of](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf)\n[2018, FIN6 was specifically targeting numerous e-Commerce companies’ payment servers](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf)\nand using malicious documents to infect their targets with more_eggs as the initial phase of\ntheir attack.\n\nThat activity mirrors a threat [campaign that was reported separately in February 2019 by](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/fake-jobs-campaigns-delivering-moreeggs-backdoor-fake-job-offers)\nProofPoint researchers. In these incidents, threat actors were observed attacking retail,\nentertainment and pharmaceutical companies’ online payments systems and using malicious\ndocuments, laden with more_eggs, to target the companies’ employees. The threat actors\nsent fake job offers to the employees, cleverly using the job title listed on their LinkedIn\nprofiles, in their communications. The campaigns reported in February 2019 by Visa and\nProofPoint could be the same operation or, they could be two separate campaigns. However,\nwhat we do know is that the targets (eCommerce companies’ payment systems) and tools\n(more_eggs) were used in both scams.\n\n[Later in August 2019, the FIN6 operators launched another malicious campaign, and](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/more_eggs-anyone-threat-actor-itg08-strikes-again/)\nresearchers believe with this operation FIN6 was actively going after multinational\norganizations. Similar to the February 2019 campaign launched against the retail,\nentertainment, and pharmaceutical companies; employees were spearphished with fake job\n[offers. According to security researchers, to gain access to victim environments, the threat](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/more_eggs-anyone-threat-actor-itg08-strikes-again/)\nactor began by targeting handpicked employees using LinkedIn messaging and email,\nadvertising fake jobs to lure recipients into checking into the supposed offers.\n\nBetween the end of 2018 and April 2021, there have been three distinct more_eggs LinkedIn\ncampaigns using the same Modus Operandi. Each campaign targeted corporate employees,\nutilized their LinkedIn profile, and then social engineered them with bogus job offers, which\nlead to the more eggs malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Evilnum - The** [Evilnum cybercrime group is best known for compromising financial](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evilnum-hackers-use-the-same-malware-supplier-as-fin6-cobalt/)\ntechnology companies, which are companies that provide stock trading platforms and tools.\nTheir target is financial information about the targeted FINTECH companies and their\ncustomers. They target items such as spreadsheets and documents with customer lists,\ninvestments and trading operations and credentials for trading software/platforms and\nsoftware.The Evilnum group is also known to spearphish employees of the companies they\nare targeting and enclose malicious zip files. If executed, the employees get hit with the\nmore_eggs backdoor, along with other malware.\n\n**Cobalt Group -** [The Cobalt Group is also known to go after financial companies, and it has](https://cyware.com/news/the-tale-of-the-prolific-cobalt-threat-groups-massive-phishing-campaigns-against-financial-institutions-fedafe34)\nrepeatedly used the more_eggs backdoor in their attacks.\n\n## The Interworkings of More_Eggs\n\nMore_eggs is a sophisticated suite of malware components. One of those components is\nVenomLink (a component used to trick the victim into installing TerraLoader). TerraLoader is\nan intermediate component used to install numerous modules designed to take malicious\nactions such as credential theft, lateral movement, and file encryption throughout a victim’s\nIT network. A complete analysis of the 2020 version of more_eggs was conducted by Quo\nIntelligence, who broke the malware into several modules. Here is a full breakdown:\n\n**VenomLNK is a poisoned LNK file. Windows uses LNK files to automate program**\nexecution. More_eggs uses a maliciously-written LNK file to execute TerraLoader by\ntricking the user into opening what they think is a document.\n**TerraLoader loads the other modules from VenomLNK.**\n**TerraPreter provides a Meterpreter (a Metasploit attack payload) shell in memory.**\n**TerraStealer is an info stealing module used to exfiltrate sensitive data.**\n**TerraTV allows threat actors to hijack TeamViewer for lateral movement.**\n**TerraCrypt is a ransomware plugin for PureLocker ransomware, aka CR1**\nRansomware, a lesser-known ransomware.\n\nThe social engineering method for this current more_eggs campaign consisted of disguising\na zipped copy of the VenomLNK malware as a job applicant’s resume. A benign PDF resume\nis included as well, which serves as a decoy resume, while more_eggs installs TerraLoader.\n\n[As with previous more_eggs variants observed by TRU, the malware abuses legitimate](https://www.esentire.com/security-advisories/hackers-spearphish-professionals-on-linkedin-with-fake-job-offers-infecting-them-with-malware-warns-esentire)\nWindows processes to evade detection, alongside a decoy document to trick users. With the\nincident involving the accounting firm, an employee of the firm received what they thought\nwas a candidate’s resume, when in actuality the resume was the VenomLNK malware. Once\nVenomLNK was executed, it proceeded to execute TerraLoader so that TerraLoader could\nthen load various information stealing and intrusion modules of the more_eggs malware\nsuite. With this campaign however, there are two notable differences:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs stated earlier, rather than targeting hopeful candidates looking for work, the\nhackers are targeting businesses looking for employees.\nIn place of the previously abused Windows process, cmstp.exe – which manages\nnetwork connections – more_eggs is abusing ie4uinit.exe, another Windows Process,\nto load its malicious plugins.\n\n## What’s New with More_Eggs?\n\nThe current threat campaign utilizes several similar features TRU observed in the 2021\nmore_eggs LinkedIn operation including: the VenomLNK module, including a decoy\ndocument, and .lnk file, and multi-phase execution through writing and reading .txt files\n(which turned out to be .xml files with JavaScript contents upon inspection). The TerraLoader\nequivalent, however, abuses ie4uinit.exe instead of cmstsp.exe, eventually leading to the\n[abuse of msxsl.exe as we reported in April 2021.](https://www.esentire.com/security-advisories/hackers-spearphish-professionals-on-linkedin-with-fake-job-offers-infecting-them-with-malware-warns-esentire)\n\n## Observations of More_Eggs Operation from Keegan Keplinger, research and reporting lead with eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) security team\n\n“Anti-Virus(AV) is not enough to protect employees and home users from cyber threats.\nBecause malware like more_eggs takes the so-called fileless approach to evade AV, there is\nno malicious executable for AV to detect. Rather, more_eggs achieves execution by passing\nmalicious code to legitimate windows processes and letting those windows processes do the\nwork for them.”\n\n“We tend to see threat campaigns, involving the sophisticated and versatile more_eggs\nmalware, just a few times a year compared to some other threats. In addition to the\nspearphishing component, this indicates to me that threat actors, using the more_eggs\nservice, are selective and patient.”\n\n“This year the more_eggs operation has flipped the social engineering script, targeting hiring\nmanagers with fake resumes instead of targeting jobseekers with fake job offers.”\n\n“The threat actors behind more_eggs use a scalable, spearphishing approach that\nweaponizes expected communications, such as resumes, that match a hiring manager´s\nexpectations or job offers, targeting hopeful candidates, that match their current or past job\ntitles.”\n\n## Recommendations for Protecting Against More_Eggs\n\n\n-----\n\n**Security Awareness Training for All Employees. Security Awareness training should**\nbe mandated for all company employees. The training should ensure that employees:\n\nAvoid downloading and executing files from unverified sources. For example, be\nwary of Word and Excel documents sent from an unknown source or acquired\nfrom the Internet that prompts you to ‘Enable Macros’.\nAvoid free versions of paid software.\nAlways inspect the full URL before downloading files to ensure it matches the\nsource (e.g., Microsoft Team should come from a Microsoft domain).\nInspect file extensions. Do not trust the filetype logo alone. An executable file can\nbe disguised as a PDF or office document.\nEnsure standard procedures are in place for employees to submit potentially\nmalicious content for review\n**Anti-virus isn’t enough. Malware that abuses LOLBINs bypasses binary detection**\napproaches. Therefore, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents need to be\ninstalled on all hosts. An EDR solution is a necessary technology for detecting threats\nsuch as more_eggs,and EDR agents must be continuously monitored and updated\nwith the evolving threat landscape. If not, then critical alerts will not be triaged and\ninvestigated. Managed Detection and Response (MDR) providers offer this service.\nRobust and comprehensive MDR services require an AI-powered Extended Detection\nand Response (XDR) technology platform so that the hundreds of daily security\nsignals, generated by an organization’s EDR agents, can be promptly ingested,\nanalyzed and responded to. Security events which can be resolved through an\nautomated response are processed, while security events requiring a hands-on\nresponse are handled by the MDR’s cybersecurity analysts and threat hunters.\n**Monitor the Threat Landscape. Organizations need relevant threat intelligence, and it**\nmust be actioned in a timely fashion. Additionally, one’s security team needs to be\nspecifically informed about an organization’s operating environment, working in concert\nwith one’s security provider.\n\nIf you’re not currently engaged with a Managed Detection and Response provider, we highly\nrecommend you partner with us for security services to disrupt threats before they impact\n[your business.
