See Scan Exchange log files for indicators of compromise._\n\nMicrosoft has detected multiple 0-day exploits being used to attack on-premises versions of\nMicrosoft Exchange Server in limited and targeted attacks. In the attacks observed, the\nthreat actor used these vulnerabilities to access on-premises Exchange servers which\nenabled access to email accounts, and allowed installation of additional malware to facilitate\nlong-term access to victim environments. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)\n[attributes this campaign with high confidence to HAFNIUM, a group assessed to be state-](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/?p=64505)\nsponsored and operating out of China, based on observed victimology, tactics and\nprocedures.\n\nThe vulnerabilities recently being exploited were CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065, all of which were addressed in today’s Microsoft\n[Security Response Center (MSRC) release – Multiple Security Updates Released for](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server)\nExchange Server. We strongly urge customers to update on-premises systems immediately.\nExchange Online is not affected. We have established a resource center that is constantly\n[updated as more information becomes available at https://aka.ms/ExchangeVulns.](https://aka.ms/ExchangeVulns)\n\nWe are sharing this information with our customers and the security community to emphasize\nthe critical nature of these vulnerabilities and the importance of patching all affected systems\nimmediately to protect against these exploits and prevent future abuse across the\necosystem. This blog also continues our mission to shine a light on malicious actors and\nelevate awareness of the sophisticated tactics and techniques used to target our customers.\nThe related IOCs, [Azure Sentinel advanced hunting queries, and Microsoft Defender for](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/)\nEndpoint product detections and queries shared in this blog will help SOCs proactively hunt\nfor related activity in their environments and elevate any alerts for remediation.\n\nMicrosoft would like to thank our industry colleagues at Volexity and Dubex for reporting\ndifferent parts of the attack chain and their collaboration in the investigation. Volexity has\n[also published a blog post with their analysis. It is this level of proactive communication and](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities)\nintelligence sharing that allows the community to come together to get ahead of attacks\nbefore they spread and improve security for all.\n\n## Who is HAFNIUM?\n\n\n-----\n\nHAFNIUM primarily targets entities in the United States across a number of industry sectors,\nincluding infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense\ncontractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs.\n\nHAFNIUM has previously compromised victims by exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing\n[servers, and has used legitimate open-source frameworks, like Covenant, for command and](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant)\ncontrol. Once they’ve gained access to a victim network, HAFNIUM typically exfiltrates data\n[to file sharing sites like MEGA.](https://mega.nz/)\n\nIn campaigns unrelated to these vulnerabilities, Microsoft has observed HAFNIUM\ninteracting with victim Office 365 tenants. While they are often unsuccessful in compromising\ncustomer accounts, this reconnaissance activity helps the adversary identify more details\nabout their targets’ environments.\n\nHAFNIUM operates primarily from leased virtual private servers (VPS) in the United States.\n\n## Technical details\n\nMicrosoft is providing the following details to help our customers understand the techniques\nused by HAFNIUM to exploit these vulnerabilities and enable more effective defense against\nany future attacks against unpatched systems.\n\n[CVE-2021-26855 is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange which](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855)\nallowed the attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange\nserver.\n\n[CVE-2021-26857 is an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26857)\nservice. Insecure deserialization is where untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by\na program. Exploiting this vulnerability gave HAFNIUM the ability to run code as SYSTEM on\nthe Exchange server. This requires administrator permission or another vulnerability to\nexploit.\n\n[CVE-2021-26858 is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26858)\nHAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability\nto write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-202126855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin’s credentials.\n\n[CVE-2021-27065 is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27065)\nHAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability\nto write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-202126855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin’s credentials.\n\n## Attack details\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter exploiting these vulnerabilities to gain initial access, HAFNIUM operators deployed web\nshells on the compromised server. Web shells potentially allow attackers to steal data and\nperform additional malicious actions that lead to further compromise. One example of a web\nshell deployed by HAFNIUM, written in ASP, is below:\n\nFollowing web shell deployment, HAFNIUM operators performed the following postexploitation activity:\n\nUsing Procdump to dump the LSASS process memory:\n\nUsing 7-Zip to compress stolen data into ZIP files for exfiltration:\n\nAdding and using Exchange PowerShell snap-ins to export mailbox data:\n\nUsing the [Nishang Invoke-PowerShellTcpOneLine reverse shell:](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang)\n\nDownloading PowerCat from GitHub, then using it to open a connection to a remote\nserver:\n\nHAFNIUM operators were also able to download the Exchange offline address book from\ncompromised systems, which contains information about an organization and its users.\n\nOur blog, [Defending Exchange servers under attack, offers advice for improving defenses](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/24/defending-exchange-servers-under-attack/)\nagainst Exchange server compromise. Customers can also find additional guidance about\n[web shell attacks in our blog Web shell attacks continue to rise.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/02/11/web-shell-attacks-continue-to-rise/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Can I determine if I have been compromised by this activity?\n\nThe below sections provide indicators of compromise (IOCs), detection guidance, and\nadvanced hunting queries to help customers investigate this activity using Exchange server\nlogs, Azure Sentinel, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Microsoft 365 Defender. We\nencourage our customers to conduct investigations and implement proactive detections to\nidentify possible prior campaigns and prevent future campaigns that may target their\nsystems.\n\n### Check patch levels of Exchange Server\n\nThe Microsoft Exchange Server team has published a blog post on these new Security\nUpdates providing a script to get a quick inventory of the patch-level status of on-premises\nExchange servers and answer some basic questions around installation of these patches.\n\n### Scan Exchange log files for indicators of compromise\n\nThe Exchange Server team has created a script to run a check for HAFNIUM IOCs to\naddress performance and memory concerns. That script is available here:\n[https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security.](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security)\n\nCVE-2021-26855 exploitation can be detected via the following Exchange HttpProxy\nlogs:\n\nThese logs are located in the following directory:\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Logging\\HttpProxy\nExploitation can be identified by searching for log entries where the\nAuthenticatedUser is empty and the AnchorMailbox contains the pattern of\nServerInfo~*/*\n\nHere is an example PowerShell command to find these log entries:\n```\nImport-Csv -Path (Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path\n\"$env:PROGRAMFILES\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Logging\\HttpProxy\" -Filter\n'*.log').FullName | Where-Object { $_.AnchorMailbox -like 'ServerInfo~*/*' or $_.BackEndCookie -like 'Server~*/*~*'} | select DateTime, AnchorMailbox,\nUrlStem, RoutingHint, ErrorCode, TargetServerVersion, BackEndCookie,\nGenericInfo, GenericErrors, UrlHost, Protocol, Method, RoutingType,\nAuthenticationType, ServerHostName, HttpStatus, BackEndStatus, UserAgent\n\n```\nIf activity is detected, the logs specific to the application specified in the\nAnchorMailbox path can be used to help determine what actions were taken.\n\nThese logs are located in the %PROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\Logging directory.\n\n\n-----\n\nCVE-2021-26858 exploitation can be detected via the Exchange log files:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Logging\\OABGeneratorLog\nFiles should only be downloaded to the\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\ClientAccess\\OAB\\Temp\ndirectory\n\nIn case of exploitation, files are downloaded to other directories (UNC or\nlocal paths)\nWindows command to search for potential exploitation:\n```\nfindstr /snip /c:\"Download failed and temporary file\"\n\"%PROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\Logging\\OABGeneratorLog\\*.log\"\n\n```\nCVE-2021-26857 exploitation can be detected via the Windows Application event logs\n\nExploitation of this deserialization bug will create Application events with the\nfollowing properties:\n\nSource: MSExchange Unified Messaging\nEntryType: Error\nEvent Message Contains: System.InvalidCastException\nFollowing is PowerShell command to query the Application Event Log for these\nlog entries:\n```\nGet-EventLog -LogName Application -Source \"MSExchange Unified Messaging\" EntryType Error | Where-Object { $_.Message -like\n\"*System.InvalidCastException*\" }\n\n```\nCVE-2021-27065 exploitation can be detected via the following Exchange log files:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Logging\\ECP\\Server\n\nAll Set-<AppName>VirtualDirectory properties should never contain script.
