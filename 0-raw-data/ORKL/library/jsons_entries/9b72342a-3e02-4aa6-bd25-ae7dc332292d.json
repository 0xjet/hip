Threat researchers like](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/exposing-initial-access-broker-ties-conti/) [@k3dg3 occasionally report malware samples from](https://twitter.com/k3dg3/status/1526252566803271680)\nthis activity. Based on [@k3dg3's recent tweet, I searched through VirusTotal and found a](https://twitter.com/k3dg3/status/1526252566803271680)\nhandful of active TransferXL URLs delivering ISO files for Bumblebee malware.\n\nToday's diary reviews an infection generated from this activity on Wednesday 2022-05-18.\n\n_Shown above: Flow chart for infection discussed in this diary._\n\n**_TransferXL URLs_**\n\nTransferXL is a legitimate file sharing service. However, like other services with a cost-free\ntier, TransferXL has been abused by criminals as a way to distribute malicious files.\nHowever, with TransferXL, we have the benefit of seeing an email address used to share the\nmalicious file. The image below shows a malicious TransferXL URL recently submitted to\nVirusTotal. Viewed in a web browser, it sends a malicious file. The associated email\naddress is jhurris@wolsleyindustrialgroup.com.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Malicious TransferXL URL delivering malware._\n\nThe downloaded zip archive contains an ISO disk image. When double-clicked, this file is\nmounted as a DVD drive. The ISO file contains a visible Windows shortcut and a hidden\nmalware DLL for Bumblebee. Double-clicking the Windows shortcut will run the hidden\nmalware DLL on a vulnerable Windows host.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Downloaded ISO file mounted as a disk image containing Windows shortcut_\n_and hidden malware DLL._\n\n**_Traffic from an infection_**\n\nAfter downloading malware from the malicious TransferXL URL, the infected host generated\nBumblebee C2 traffic to 194.135.33[.]144 over TCP port 443.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Initial infection activity with Bumblebee C2 traffic filtered in Wireshark._\n\nApproximately 15 minutes after the Bumblebee C2 traffic first appeared, the infected\nWindows host generated HTTPS traffic to ec2-3-144-143-232-us-east**_2.compute.amazonaws[.]com on 3.144.143[.]242 over TCP port 443. The infected host_**\nsent approximately 5.5 MB of data out and received approximately 4.0 MB of data back from\nthat server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Encrypted (HTTPS) traffic to an amazonAWS server._\n\nApproximately 14 minutes after HTTPS traffic to the amazonAWS server, HTTPS Cobalt\nStrike traffic appeared on 23.106.215[.]123 over TCP port 443 using xenilik[.]com as the\ndomain. It lasted approximately 3 minutes.\n\n_Shown above: Traffic from the infection showing Cobalt Strike activity._\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)_**\n\nTransferXL URLs associated with the above email returning zip archives containing\nmalicious ISO files.\n\n**_hxxps://www.transferxl[.]com/download/00ZNPDZqZwZ9m_**\n**_hxxps://www.transferxl[.]com/download/00jwbtRXtsSsZX_**\n**_hxxps://www.transferxl[.]com/download/00vJV4K6QVXSq6_**\n**_hxxps://www.transferxl[.]com/download/00y12VGg75h7K_**\n**_hxxps://www.transferxl[.]com/download/08j8ZRjHFkVxxc_**\n\nNOTE: The above URLs usually have ?utm_source=downloadmail&utm_medium=e-mail\nappended to them.\n\nEmail addresses associated with malicious TransferXL URLs:\n\n**_andresbolivar@southerncompanygas[.]co_**\n**_jhurris@wolsleyindustrialgroup[.]com_**\n**_m.jones@wolsleyindustrialgroup[.]com_**\n**_mjones@wolsleyindustrialgroup[.]co_**\n\nDomains from the above emails:\n\n**_southerncompanygas[.]co - registered 2022-04-27_**\n**_wolsleyindustrialgroup[.]com - registered 2022-04-29_**\n**_wolsleyindustrialgroup[.]co - not registered_**\n\nMalware from an infected Windows host:\n\n[SHA256 hash: 1ec8c7e21090fb4c667f40c8720388a89789c569169fe0e41ec81567df499aac](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1ec8c7e21090fb4c667f40c8720388a89789c569169fe0e41ec81567df499aac)\n\nFile size: 669,897 bytes\nFile name: TransferXL-00jdMwft3vVZ7Q.zip\nFile description: Zip archive retrieved from TransferXL URL\n\nSHA256 hash:\n[24aa82e1a085412686af5d178810fc0d056c5b8167ae5b88973b33071aa14569](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/24aa82e1a085412686af5d178810fc0d056c5b8167ae5b88973b33071aa14569)\n\nFile size: 1,052,672 bytes\nFile name: documents-2205210.iso\nFile description: ISO file extracted from downloaded zip archive\n\n[SHA256 hash: ade875616534b755f33f6012ea263da808dd7eb50bc903fc97722f37fac7c164](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ade875616534b755f33f6012ea263da808dd7eb50bc903fc97722f37fac7c164)\n\nFile size: 1,191 bytes\nFile name: New Folder.lnk\n\n\n-----\n\nFile description: Windows shortcut contained in ISO file\nShortcut: C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe spc.dll,JQhnMKwhpA\n\nSHA256 hash:\n[88c07354f1d7b0485452d5c39dc1a6d73884e163bc5489c40adc6662602b4d76](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/88c07354f1d7b0485452d5c39dc1a6d73884e163bc5489c40adc6662602b4d76)\n\nFile size: 997,888 bytes\nFile name: spc.dll\nFile description: 64-bit DLL (hidden flag set) for Bumblebee malware\nRun method: rundll32.exe [filename],JQhnMKwhpA\n\nTraffic from the infected Windows host:\n\n194.135.33[.]144 port 443 - Bumblebee C2 HTTPS traffic\n3.144.143[.]242 port 443 - ec2-3-144-143-242.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws[.]com\n\n   - HTTPS traffic\n23.106.215[.]123 port 443 - xenilik[.]com - Cobalt Strike HTTPS traffic\n\n**_Final words_**\n\nAs the [Google TAG blog post notes, EXOTIC LILY is using this method to push Bumblebee](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/exposing-initial-access-broker-ties-conti/)\nmalware, and Bumblebee leads to further malware like Cobalt Strike. And Cobalt Strike has\nbeen documented by different sources as leading to ransomware.\n\nToday's diary reviewed a Bumblebee malware infection associated with EXOTIC LILY that\nled to Cobalt Strike activity.\n\n[Pcap and malware samples associated with this infection are available here.](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2022/05/18/index2.html)\n\n--\nBrad Duncan\n\nbrad [at] malware-traffic-analysis.net\n\n[Keywords: Bumblebee](https://isc.sans.edu/tag.html?tag=Bumblebee) [Cobalt Strike](https://isc.sans.edu/tag.html?tag=Cobalt%20Strike) [EXOTIC LILY](https://isc.sans.edu/tag.html?tag=EXOTIC%20LILY) [malware](https://isc.sans.edu/tag.html?tag=malware) [TransferXL](https://isc.sans.edu/tag.html?tag=TransferXL)\n[3 comment(s)](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Bumblebee+Malware+from+TransferXL+URLs/28664/#comments)\n\n### Comments\n\nHi Brad,\n\nGood analysis as always. Quick feedback: you have mentioned \"194.135.33[.]134\" as a C2\nin the article but the network traffic image and the IoC shows it as \"194.135.33[.]144\".\n\n**Anonymous**\n\n\n-----\n\n**May 19th 2022**\n**11 months ago**\n\nThanks for the heads-up! I corrected that typo. Fortunately, it was listed correctly in the IOCs\nlist. Thanks again!\n\n**Anonymous**\n\n**May 20th 2022**\n\n**11 months ago**\n\nHi Brad,\n\nAnything new against Bumblebee? Trending this for official use case. Thanks in advance!\n\n**Anonymous**\n\n**Jun 13th 2022**\n\n**10 months ago**\n\n[Login here to join the discussion.](https://isc.sans.edu/login)\n\nTop of page\n×\n\n[Diary Archives](https://isc.sans.edu/diaryarchive.html)\n\n\n-----",
