At\nleast two were targeted or infected with both.\nVictims included Members of the European Parliament, Catalan Presidents, legislators,\njurists, and members of civil society organisations. Family members were also infected\nin some cases.\nWe identified evidence of HOMAGE, a previously-undisclosed iOS zero-click\nvulnerability used by NSO Group that was effective against some versions prior to 13.2.\nThe Citizen Lab is not conclusively attributing the operations to a specific entity, but\nstrong circumstantial evidence suggests a nexus with Spanish authorities.\nWe shared a selection of Pegasus cases with Amnesty International’s Tech Lab, which\nindependently validated our forensic methodology.\n\n[Click here for a graphical overview of our findings.](https://catalonia.citizenlab.ca/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn 2019, WhatsApp patched CVE-2019-3568, a vulnerability exploited by NSO Group to hack\nAndroid phones around the world with Pegasus. At the same time, WhatsApp notified 1,400\nusers who had been targeted with the exploit. Among the targets were multiple members of\n[civil society and political figures in Catalonia, Spain. The Citizen Lab assisted WhatsApp in](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/13/phone-of-top-catalan-politician-targeted-by-government-grade-spyware)\nnotifying civil society victims and helping them take steps to be more secure.\n\nThe cases were [first reported by](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/13/phone-of-top-catalan-politician-targeted-by-government-grade-spyware) _The Guardian in 2020. Following these reports, the Citizen_\nLab, in collaboration with civil society organisations, undertook a large-scale investigation\ninto Pegasus hacking in Spain. The investigation has uncovered at least 65 individuals\ntargeted or infected with Pegasus or spyware from Candiru, another mercenary hacking\ncompany.\n\nForensic evidence was obtained from victims who consented to participate in a research\nstudy with the Citizen Lab. Further, victims publicly named in this report consented to be\nidentified as such, while other targets chose to remain anonymous. Confirmed cases of\nPegasus and Candiru hacking (i.e. when the spyware is successfully installed on a device)\nare referred to as “infections” or being “infected” throughout the report, while “targeted” refers\nto an act of targeting with Pegasus or Candiru spyware that may or may not correspond to a\nforensically-discovered infection (i.e. because a device was unavailable for analysis, or is an\nAndroid which is more difficult to forensically analyse). “Hacking” is used as a global term to\ndescribe the act of targeting and/or infecting devices.\n\nThe hacking covers a spectrum of civil society in Catalonia, from academics and activists to\nnon-governmental organisations (NGOs). Catalonia’s government and elected officials were\nalso extensively targeted, from the highest levels of Catalan government to Members of the\nEuropean Parliament, legislators, and their staff and family members. We do not conclusively\nattribute the targeting to a specific government, but extensive circumstantial evidence points\nto the Spanish government.\n\n## Background: Spain, Catalonia, and Surveillance\n\nFollowing three years of civil war spanning from 1936 to 1939, and thirty-six years of brutal\ndictatorship under General Francisco Franco, Spain’s government transitioned into a\ndemocratic, constitutional monarchy in 1975-1978. Under the King as head of state, Spain’s\n[elected Prime Minister and Council of Ministers form the government.

In 2001,\nMariano Rajoy, then Spain’s Minister of Interior, purchased the Sistema integral de\ninterpretación de las comunicaciones (SITEL), spyware the Guardia Civil and CNI used to\n[track suspects’ phones. Spain also reportedly ‘colluded’ with the National Security Agency](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/30/spain-colluded-nsa-spying-citizens-spanish-el-mundo-us)\n[(NSA) in the United States. One interpretation of the 2013 Snowden disclosures suggested](https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1960151/0/espionaje-eeuu/espana-interceptadas/llamadas-telefono/?autoref=true)\nthat the NSA had intercepted 60 million calls in Spain between December 2012 and January\n2013. However, a [subsequent analysis showed that these assertions were based on a likely](https://theintercept.com/2019/05/29/nsa-data-afghanistan-iraq-mexico-border/)\nmisinterpretation of slides from the Snowden disclosures, and actually related to data\ncollection by NATO allies, including Spain, in Afghanistan.1\n\n[According to el Confidencial, the CNI and National Police paid at least 209,000 euros to the](https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/2015-07-06/cni-hackers-team-espionaje-contratos_916216/)\nMilan-based surveillance software company Hacking Team for use of its spyware in 2010.\nThe purchase was first revealed in 2015 when WikiLeaks published internal Hacking Team\nemails. El País then [reported that the contract with the CNI was “valid from 2010 to 2016,](https://elpais.com/politica/2015/07/07/actualidad/1436284983_731864.html)\n[worth 3.4 million euros.” The CNI acknowledged it purchased the spyware at the time, saying](https://elpais.com/politica/2015/07/07/actualidad/1436284983_731864.html)\n[it did so “in accordance with the public sector contracting laws.” CNI declined to give any](https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/2015-07-06/cni-hackers-team-espionaje-contratos_916216/)\nfurther information as to what they did with Hacking Team’s spyware.

The first to do so was Roger\nTorrent, then pro-independence president of the Catalan Parliament. The targeting of Torrent\nwith NSO Group’s spyware was [confirmed by WhatsApp.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/28/whatsapp-confirms-catalan-politicians-phone-was-target-of-2019-attack) [Ernest Maragall, leader of the pro-](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20200714/parlament-roger-torrent-espia-movil-catalunya-8038888)\nindependence, Barcelona-based Republican Left of Catalonia party, was the second target to\ncome forward, followed by Anna Gabriel, a former regional member of Parliament for the farleft party, the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), activist Jordi Domingo, and Puigdemont\nstaffer [Sergi Miquel Gutiérrez.

Our forensic analysis enables us to conclude with high\nconfidence that, of the 63 people targeted with Pegasus, at least 51 individuals were\n\n\n-----\n\ninfected.\n\n[Click here for a graphical overview of our findings.](https://catalonia.citizenlab.ca/)\nAlmost all of the incidents occurred between 2017 and 2020, although we found an instance\nof targeting in 2015. All targets publicly named in this report consented to be identified as\nsuch.\n\nIn addition to the forensic confirmations, we identified additional cases of Catalans targeted\nby Pegasus infection attempts, but where we were unable to forensically validate an\ninfection. This was due to multiple reasons, ranging from changed or discarded devices, to\nthe limitations of our forensic tooling.\n\n\n**Case Type**\n\n\n**Number**\n**observed**\n\n\nIndividuals with forensically-confirmed infections. 51\n\n\nIndividuals targeted via SMS or WhatsApp with Pegasus infection\n**attempts, without forensic confirmation of a successful infection.**\n\n\n12\n\n\nTotal Pegasus targets 63\n\n**Table 1: Pegasus Infection and Targeting Overview**\n\n[Spain has a high Android prevalence over iOS (~80% Android in 2021). Anecdotally, this is](https://www.statista.com/statistics/260419/market-share-held-by-smartphone-operating-systems-in-spain/#:~:text=The%20predominance%20of%20Android%20smartphones,percent%20of%20the%20total%20share.)\nsomewhat reflected in the individuals we contacted. Because our forensic tools for detecting\nPegasus are much more developed for iOS devices, we believe that this report heavily\n_undercounts the number of individuals likely targeted and infected with Pegasus because_\nthey had Android devices.\n\n### Relational or “Off-Centre” Targeting\n\nTargeting friends, family members, and close associates is a common practice for some\nhacking operations. This technique allows an attacker to gather information about a primary\ntarget without necessarily maintaining access to that person’s device. In some cases, the\nprimary target may also be infected, but in others this may not be feasible for various\nreasons.\n\nWe observed several cases of relational or “off-centre” targeting: spouses, siblings, parents,\nstaff, or close associates of primary targets were targeted and infected with Pegasus. In\nsome cases those individuals may also have been targeted, but forensic information was\nunavailable. In others, we found no evidence that a primary target was infected with\nPegasus, but found targeting of their intimates.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, one individual targeted with Candiru had a US SIM card in their device, and\nresided in the US. We failed to find evidence that this individual was infected with Pegasus.\nThis is consistent with [reports that most Pegasus customers are not permitted to target US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/07/19/us-phone-numbers-nso/)\nnumbers. However, both of the target’s parents use phones with Spanish numbers, and were\ntargeted on the day that the primary target flew back to Spain from the US. Neither parent is\npolitically active or likely to have been targeted because of who they are or what they do.\n\n### Target: Members of the European Parliament\n\nEvery Catalan Member of the European Parliament (MEP) that supported independence was\ntargeted either directly with Pegasus, or via suspected relational targeting. Three MEPs were\ndirectly infected, two more had staff, family members, or close associates targeted with\nPegasus.\n\n**Diana Riba (MEP, ERC), who assumed office in July 2019 was infected on or around**\nOctober 28, 2019. Antoni Comín (MEP, JUNTS), who also assumed office in July 2019, was\ninfected sometime between August 2019 and January 2020. He had assumed his role as a\nMEP in July 2019. Antoni Comín is also Vice President of the Council of the Catalan\nRepublic.\n\nIn some cases, the targeting coincided with political events, underlining that the targeting\nmay have been for the purposes of political espionage. For example, Jordi Solé (MEP, ERC)\nwas [targeted during party discussions about who would replace MEP Oriol Junqueras.

He also received\nmessages purporting to come from the Spanish tax and social security authorities.\n\nMessages received by Sànchez often coincided with important political events. For example,\non April 20, 2017, he was targeted the day prior to Catalan government meetings with civil\nsociety groups to discuss the October referendum. Months later, just as polling stations\nopened on October 1, 2017, he was targeted with an alarming message saying that a police\n“offensive” was beginning. Forensic analysis confirms that Sànchez was infected at least four\ntimes with Pegasus between May and October 2017.\n\n[Sanchez is among the prominent Catalans arrested, and later pardoned, for their role in the](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/22/spanish-government-pardons-nine-jailed-catalan-leaders)\n[Referendum.

Prior to her role with the ANC, she served as dean of the\nFaculty of Economics and Business at the University of Barcelona.\n\nShe was working from home during the COVID lockdown when the first Pegasus infection\nattempt arrived. It purported to be a news story about the ANC. On June 10, 2020, as she\nwas running for a board seat with ANC and as online voting began, a second infection\nattempt arrived. It masqueraded as a Twitter update from a Catalan newspaper.\n\nAnother ANC board member, Sònia Urpí Garcia, was infected with Pegasus on June 22,\n2020, just over a week after being elected to the role on June 13, 2020.\n\n**Target: Òmnium Cultural**\n\nMultiple individuals around Òmnium were similarly targeted with Pegaus.

We\nalso found evidence of extensive Pegasus SMS targeting straddling that period, beginning in\nFebruary 2018 and ending in May 2020.\n\n**Elena Jiménez, another executive board member and the international representative of**\nÒmnium, was also infected with Pegasus. Although we are unable to determine the date of\nthe infection, the case is interesting: her role included dialogue with NGOs throughout\n\n\n-----\n\nEurope including Amnesty International and Frontline Defenders.

Forensic examination of his phone indicates that he was also infected at least 16\ntimes with Pegasus between August 2019 and July 2020.\n\nMatamala was also infected with Candiru spyware. Other members of the Catalan opensource community who work on voting software and decentralization were similarly targeted\nwith Candiru. Their cases are described below in greater detail (See Finding: Catalans\n_Targeted with Candiru)._\n\n### Lawyers Representing Prominent Catalans\n\nMultiple lawyers representing prominent Catalans were targeted and infected with Pegasus,\nsome extensively. While not all have consented to be named, the targeting suggests that this\ngroup was a specific focus for monitoring.\n\nFor example, well-known lawyer Gonzalo Boye, who represents Puigdemont (among\nothers), was targeted at least 18 times with infection attempts between January and May\n2020. Some of the messages masqueraded as tweets from organisations like Human Rights\nWatch, The Guardian, Columbia Journalism Review, and Politico.\n\nBoye was successfully infected with Pegasus on or around October 30, 2020.

Examination of the SMS targeting also points to a\ndetailed understanding of the targets, their interests, concerns, and activities. The timing of\nthe targeting often directly coincided with specific non-public and sensitive activities such as\nstrategy meetings and negotiations. This is highly suggestive of a well resourced intelligence\nservice.\n\n## Exploit Techniques\n\nVictims were infected through at least two vectors: zero-click exploits and malicious SMSes.\nWhile users can be trained to be vigilant about not clicking suspicious links, the use of zeroclick exploits is especially difficult to defend against as there is no action that a regular user\ncan take that will reliably protect them against this kind of attack.\n\n### Zero-Click Exploits\n\nWe saw evidence that multiple zero-click iMessage exploits were used to hack Catalan\ntargets’ iPhones with Pegasus between 2017 and 2020.\n\n**Discovering Homage**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have identified signs of a zero-click exploit that has not been previously described, which\nwe call HOMAGE. The HOMAGE exploit appears to have been in use during the last months\nof 2019, and involved an iMessage zero-click component that launched a WebKit instance in\nthe com.apple.mediastream.mstreamd process, following a\n_com.apple.private.alloy.photostream lookup for a Pegasus email address. The WebKit_\ninstance in the com.apple.mediastream.mstreamd process fetched JavaScript scaffolding\nthat we recovered from an infected phone. The scaffolding was fetched from\n**/[uniqueid]/stadium/goblin. After performing tests, the scaffolding then fetches the WebKit**\nexploit from /[uniqueid]/stadium/eutopia if tests succeed.\n\nFigure 5: The scaffolding sets up code to fetch the WebKit exploit.\nOne test run by the scaffolding checks the exact screen resolution in pixels, and compares it\nwith hardcoded values for each type of iPhone hardware, with or without display zoom\nenabled. If there are multiple possible matches (for example, the iPhone X and Xs share the\nsame screen resolution if the latter is running in “display zoom” mode), then a timing sidechannel is tested, which involves measuring the time taken to encrypt a buffer of 2^28 bytes\nusing AES in CBC mode. If the measured time is less than 560ms, then the test concludes\nthat the iPhone device uses PAC (iPhone Xs and above). If the time taken is greater than\n560ms, then the test concludes that the device does not use PAC (iPhone X and earlier).\n\nThe exploit was fired at the phone on at least the following dates:\n\nMon, 16 Dec 2019 16:05:01 GMT\n\nWed, 18 Dec 2019 10:45:03 GMT\n\nThu, 19 Dec 2019 11:38:45 GMT\n\nThu, 26 Dec 2019 08:32:51 GMT\n\nSun, 29 Dec 2019 10:58:04 GMT\n\nThu, 02 Jan 2020 13:32:49 GMT\n\nSat, 04 Jan 2020 10:47:05 GMT\n\nWed, 08 Jan 2020 07:27:46 GMT\n\nAmong Catalan targets, we did not see any instances of the HOMAGE exploit used against a\ndevice running a version of iOS greater than 13.1.3. It is possible that the exploit was fixed in\niOS 13.2. We are not aware of any zero-day, zero-click exploits deployed against Catalan\ntargets following iOS 13.1.3 and before iOS 13.5.1.\n\nThe Citizen Lab has reported the exploit to Apple and provided them with relevant forensic\nartifacts. At this time, we do not have evidence to suggest that Apple device users on up-todate versions of iOS are at risk.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Kismet**\n\nThe zero-clicks used also included the KISMET [exploit, which was a zero-day in the summer](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/)\nof 2020 against iOS 13.5.1 and iOS 13.7. Though the exploit was never captured and\ndocumented, it was apparently fixed by changes introduced into iOS14, including the\nBlastDoor framework.\n\nThe most recent case we have documented of an iPhone belonging to a Catalan target that\nwas infected with Pegasus was in December 2020, via the KISMET exploit.\n\n**The 2019 WhatsApp Attack**\n\nCitizen Lab has previously confirmed that multiple Catalans were among those targeted with\nPegasus through the 2019 WhatsApp attack, which relied on the (now patched) CVE-20193568 vulnerability.\n\n### SMS-Based Targeting\n\nMany victims were targeted using SMS based attacks, and we have collected more than 200\nsuch messages. These attacks involved operators sending text messages containing\nmalicious links designed to trick targets into clicking. In this approach, once a victim clicks on\na link, the device is infected via a Pegasus exploit server.\n\nSophistication and personalization of the messages varied across attempts, but they reflect\nan often detailed understanding of the target’s habits, interests, activities, and concerns. In\nmany cases, either the timing or the contents of the text were highly customised to the\ntargets and indicated the likely use of other forms of surveillance.\n\n**Jordi Baylina is the technology lead at Polygon, a popular decentralised Ethereum scaling**\n[platform. He is also an advisor on projects related to digital voting and decentralisation, and](https://vocdoni.io/)\n\nhas built a [widely-used privacy toolkit. He was extensively targeted with Pegasus, receiving](https://blog.polygon.technology/meet-the-humans-building-zkverse-at-polygon/)\nat least 26 infection attempts. Ultimately, he was infected at least eight times between\nOctober 2019 and July 2020.\n\nBaylina received a text message masquerading as a boarding pass link for a Swiss\nInternational Air Lines flight he had purchased. Targeting in this case indicates that the\nPegasus operator may have had access to Baylina’s Passenger Name Record (PNR) or\nother information collected from the carrier.\n\n**Fake Mobile Boarding Pass**\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother common mode of targeting was to masquerade as official notifications from Spanish\ngovernment entities, including the Tax and Social Security authorities.The messages also\nused SMS Sender IDs to masquerade as official agency accounts.\n\nNotably, fake official messages were sometimes highly personalized. For example, a\nmessage sent to Jordi Baylina included a portion of his actual official tax identification\nnumber, suggesting that the Pegasus operator had access to this information.\n\n**Fake Official Notifications**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also observed regular use of package tracking or delivery notifications. Some were\npersonalised, containing the targets’ names.\n\n**Fake Package Notification**\n\n\n-----\n\nMany messages masqueraded as Twitter or news updates, typically focused on topics of\ninterest to the target. News organizations impersonated included international outlets such\nas The Guardian, Financial Times, and Die Welt, English language media like the Columbia\n_Journalism Review, as well as regional media like La Vanguardia, Europa Press, El Temps,_\n_El Confidencial, and so on._\n\n**Fake Twitter & News Updates**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cross-Border SMS Targeting**\n\nCatalans were also targeted outside of Catalonia with Pegasus infection attempts, including\nSMS messages sent to numbers with non-Spanish country codes. For example, Marta\n**Rovira was targeted while in Switzerland on her Swiss telephone number. Both SMS**\n[messages used an SMS Sender ID impersonating Swiss entities: Swisspeace is an NGO,](https://www.swisspeace.ch/)\n[and the Geneva Center for Security Policy is a foundation established and primarily funded](https://www.gcsp.ch/)\nby the Swiss government.\n\nJordi Baylina was also targeted with infection attempts masquerading as a tweet from\nEuropean NGO [European Digital Rights and a tweet purporting to be the Swiss telecom](https://edri.org/)\n[provider Swisscom.[2]](https://www.swisscom.ch/en/residential.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe text messages pointed to a cluster of domains pointing to infrastructure previously\nidentified through the Citizen Lab’s Internet scanning and fingerprinting as belonging to NSO\nGroup’s Pegasus infection infrastructure.\n\n## Finding: Catalans Targeted with Candiru\n\n[In July 2021, we published “Hooking Candiru,” in which we identified and analysed Candiru’s](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/)\nmercenary spyware, in cooperation with Microsoft. At the time we did not name the “patient\nzero” for our analysis. He is Joan Matamala. As noted above, Matamala was extensively\ntargeted and infected with Pegasus.\n\nWhile conducting a preliminary investigation into Candiru spyware we identified evidence of\na live Candiru infection on an institutional network backbone used by a consortium of\nCatalan universities.\n\nWith the help of technicians from the relevant institutions, the infection was localized to a\ncampus of the [University of Girona. Further investigation confirmed that Matamala was the](https://www.udg.edu/en/)\nowner of the infected device, and that an infection was live.\n\nUsing a pretext, Matamala’s colleagues asked him to step away from the computer and into\nthe hallway. Once the situation had been explained, he consented to a forensic analysis of\nthe device.\n\nWe were able to successfully forensically extract the malicious spyware and determine that it\nwas persistently installed on his device.\n\nWith Matamala’s consent, we shared forensic traces of the spyware with Microsoft’s Threat\n[Intelligence Center (MSTIC), who discovered over 100 victims across ten countries.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/)\nMicrosoft [describes the victims of Candiru (which they refer to as SOURGUM) as including](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/)\n“politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers, and political\ndissidents.”\n\n[Microsoft also discovered two zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31979,](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31979) [CVE-2021-33771)](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-33771)\nemployed by Candiru to infect Windows systems, and patched them in July 2021.\n\n### Identifying Additional Candiru Targets\n\nForensic evidence pertaining to Candiru was obtained from victims who consented to\nparticipate in a research study with the Citizen Lab. Victims publicly named in the report\nconsented to being identified as such.\n\n**Case Type** **Number observed**\n\n**Forensically Confirmed Candiru Infection** 1\n\n\n-----\n\n**Case Type** **Number observed**\n\n**Confirmed Candiru Targeting** 3\n\n**Total Cases** **4**\n\n**Table 3: Case Overview for Pegasus Infections & Targeting**\n\nOur continuing investigation into Candiru in connection with Catalonia revealed at least three\nother individuals were targeted with Candiru spyware via email messages: Elies Campo,3\nXavier Vives, and Pau Escrich. Escrich was also targeted with a Pegasus infection attempt\n[on June 2, 2020. Escrich and Vives are co-founders of Vocdoni, a censorship-resistant](https://vocdoni.io/)\nsecure digital voting protocol that Òmnium used during its internal elections. Elies Campo,\n[along with Jordi Baylina, both served as advisors to Vocdoni.](https://web.archive.org/web/20200930101542/https://vocdoni.io/about-us/)\n\n### Candiru Email Targeting\n\nWe identified a total of seven emails containing the Candiru spyware, via links to the domain\nname stat[.]email.\n\nThe email messages were well constructed efforts to entice the targets to click on the links.\nFor example, two of the three targets (Xavier Vives and Pau Escrich) received an email in\nFigure 6 in early February 2020, featuring the official emblem of the Government of Spain,\nand reporting that the World Health Organization had declared COVID-19 to be a “Public\nHealth Emergency of International Importance” in January.\n\nThe email contained a link to recommendations for what to do in cases of infection with\nCOVID-19. Clicking on the link would have infected the targets’ computers with Candiru’s\nspyware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Fake “Coronavirus” email sent to two of the targets in February 2020. Clicking on\nthe link would have infected the targets’ computer with Candiru spyware.\nOne of the targets, Pau Escrich, received an email impersonating the Mobile World Congress\n(MWC), with a link to tickets. Had he clicked on the link, his computer would have been\ninfected with Candiru’s spyware. The email content appears to be copied from a legitimate\nMobile World Congress email sent to news105@tutanota[.]com, which may be an email\naddress used by the spyware operators.\n\nInterestingly, Elies Campo was targeted with a well-crafted message purporting to be from\nBarcelona’s Mercantile Registry (Figure 7). The message contained factual information about\na company that he administered and purported to be a warning that a similarly-named\ncompany was registered in Panama. Such a message indicates a high degree of awareness\nof Campo’s activities, and would be likely to generate a click. The message was received\nwhile Campo was in the US.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Fake “Barcelona’s Mercantile Registry” email. Clicking on the link would result in\nthe infection of the device with Candiru spyware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Candiru infection attempt masquerading as a “Mobile World Congress” email.\nThe Mobile World Congress email containing a Candiru link is also noteworthy, as it echoes\nbait content in a Pegasus SMS sent to a separate target, Jordi Baylina:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis content similarity hints at a potential overlap of knowledge and targeting themes\nbetween the Candiru and Pegasus operators.\n\n### Candiru’s Capabilities\n\n[Our analysis of Candiru’s spyware showed that Candiru was designed for extensive access](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/)\nto the victim device, such as extracting files and browser content, but also stealing messages\nsaved in the encrypted Signal Messenger Desktop app. Figure 9 shows an excerpt of\n[Windows spyware functionality described in a leaked Candiru contract.](https://www.themarker.com/embeds/pdf_upload/2020/20200902-161742.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Some of Candiru’s functionality on Windows, as described by a leaked contract.\nMicrosoft’s analysis established that Candiru’s spyware, which they call Devil’s Tongue, also\nhad functionality allowing the operator to directly use a victim’s cloud accounts on their\n[infected device to send or post messages using their accounts. While it can be used as part](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/)\nof infection targeting, the same functionality could be used to plant evidence that would\nframe an individual in a way that would be exceedingly difficult for the victim to refute.\n\n## Attribution to NSO’s Pegasus\n\nThe Citizen Lab regularly conducts large-scale scanning, fingerprinting, and monitoring for\nevidence of Pegasus infections. We observed the following Pegasus domain names used in\nSMS infection attempts sent to Catalan targets:\n\n**Version of Pegasus Infrastructure** **Domains**\n\nVersion 1 `nnews[.]co`\n\nVersion 3 `statsads[.]co`\n```\n                    adsmetrics[.]co\n\n```\nVersion 4 `redirstats[.]com`\n```\n                    statsupplier[.]com infoquiz[.]net\n\n```\nVersion 4.5 `123tramites[.]com`\n\n**Table 4: CatalanGate Pegasus Infrastructure Domains & Versions**\n\n\n-----\n\nOf these domains, only `nnews[.]co and` `123tramites[.]com were complete matches`\nfor our fingerprint, and `statsads[.]co was a partial fingerprint match. Some of the`\ndomains appear to have customised behaviour or setup, perhaps in order to make them less\nvisible to our Internet scanning. For example, our Athena method for determining which\ndomain names were operated by a single customer (applicable to Version 3 domains) did not\nwork on `statsads[.]co or` `adsmetrics[.]co . Additionally, our Version 3 fingerprint was`\nonly a partial match for `statsads[.]co (the discrepancy was that the server exhibited`\n300ms of additional latency, perhaps because the operator fronted their NSO Group-supplied\ninfrastructure with their own custom server). Our Version 3 fingerprint did not match\n```\nadsmetrics[.]co at all, perhaps again because of a separate custom server that the\n\n```\noperator used to front their NSO-supplied infrastructure. We also did not detect any of the\nVersion 4 domains, as they used SSL certificates issued by cPanel; we only scanned for SSL\ncertificates from [specific issuers, of which cPanel was not one.](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/)\n\nDespite the apparent customizations, we have developed evidence that all of the domains\nare linked to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.\n\n**Domain** **Evidence of link to Pegasus**\n\n`nnews[.]co` Matched our “Version 1” [fingerprint](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)\n\n`statsads[.]co` Partially matched our “Version 3” fingerprint.

We link the domain\nnames infoquiz[.]net, statsupplier[.]com and redirstats[.]com to a single customer, because\nthey shared setup characteristics (nameserver hosted on kualo.net and SSL certificate from\ncPanel). We further believe that 123tramites[.]com was operated by the same customer,\nbecause an SMS with a link to 123tramites[.]com used identical bait content to an SMS with\na link to statsupplier[.]com.\n\nWe further believe that adsmetrics[.]co represents the same customer, as we saw similar bait\ncontent (message from “twitter” posing as tweet from “@ScotNational”) in an SMS with a link\nto statsupplier[.]com. We further believe that statsads[.]co represents the same customer, as\nwe saw similar bait content (message from “twitter” posing as tweet from “@elconfidencial”)\nin an SMS with a link to statsupplier[.]com. We are unsure if nnews[.]co represents the same\ncustomer, although we suspect that even if the customer is separate, it is at least a related\ncustomer: we did locate one individual who received Pegasus links from: nnews[.]co,\n_statsads[.]co and statsupplier[.]com._\n\n## Attribution to Candiru\n\n[In our July 2021 Hooking Candiru report, we listed 764 domain names that we linked to](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/)\nCandiru. Our initial ground truth was a self-signed TLS certificate mentioning an email\naddress on the domain name candirusecurity[.]com, which is registered to Candiru.\n\nThree of the domain names in our list of 764, adtrack[.]link, cortana[.]cloud, and rbtlnk[.]net\n[were interesting, because they initially matched our Candiru fingerprint CF1, but around April](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/)\n2018, began to exhibit an unusual behaviour that we believe represents customization\nemployed by the Candiru customer using these domain names. Starting from around May\n2018, any HTTPS traffic on port 443 to these three domain names was routed to a Tor client\n[running on the server (identifiable by the distinctive TLS certificates it returned), but only if](https://github.com/torproject/tor/blob/main/src/lib/tls/tortls.c#L292)\nthe SNI was set to adtrack[.]link, cortana[.]cloud, rbtlnk[.]net, or any other domain name\nconfigured on the server. The Tor behaviour simply appeared to be a “decoy” behaviour\ndesigned to confuse or mislead researchers who happened upon these domain names or\ntheir IP address. The spyware did not appear to use Tor for data exfiltration, nor was the IP,\n185.181.8[.]155, used as a relay by legitimate Tor users. Because this “Tor behaviour” was\ndifferent from the behaviour of other customers’ Candiru servers around this time, we\nhypothesised that the Candiru customer in question was attempting to “customise” their\nservers, perhaps in order to make them less visible to our Internet scanning. We scanned the\nInternet for other IPs exhibiting this same “Tor behaviour,” and found only one,\n185.193.38[.]113, which was pointed to by a single domain name at the time, stat[.]email.\n\nWe attributed stat[.]email not only to Candiru, but also to the same Candiru customer that\nwas using the other “Tor behaviour” domain names. Indeed, we located a Catalan target\n(Matamala) whose computer was communicating with domain names pointing to\n\n\n-----\n\n185.181.8[.]155, and recovered a sample of Candiru s spyware from his computer.\nAdditionally, all of the Candiru emails sent to Catalan targets used the domain stat[.]email.\n\n## Attribution to a Government\n\nAt this time the Citizen Lab is not conclusively attributing these hacking operations to a\nparticular government, however a range of circumstantial evidence points to a strong nexus\nwith one or more entities within Spanish government, including:\n\nThe targets were of obvious interest to the Spanish government;\nThe specific timing of the targeting matches events of specific interest to the Spanish\ngovernment;\nThe use of bait content in SMSes suggests access to targets personal information,\nsuch as Spanish governmental ID numbers; and,\nSpain’s CNI has [reportedly been an NSO Group Customer, and Spain’s Ministry of](https://elpais.com/espana/2020-07-15/los-servicios-de-informacion-tienen-programas-como-el-que-espio-a-torrent.html)\nInterior reportedly possesses an unnamed but similar capability.\n\nWe also judge it unlikely that a non-Spanish Pegasus customer would undertake such\nextensive targeting within Spain, using SMSes, and often impersonating Spanish authorities.\nSuch a multi-year clandestine operation, especially against high profile individuals, has a\nhigh risk of official discovery, and would surely lead to serious diplomatic and legal\nrepercussions for a non-Spanish government entity.\n\n## Independent Validation\n\nA selection of four Pegasus victims provided forensic artefacts from their devices to technical\n[experts with Amnesty International’s Security Lab, which independently examined them for](https://www.amnesty.org/en/tech/)\nevidence of Pegasus infections and targeting.\n\nElisenda Paluzie and Sònia Urpí Garcia of ANC\nJournalist Meritxell Bonet\nPolitician & professor Jordi Sànchez\n\nIn each case, Amnesty’s Security Lab independently confirmed our findings that these\nindividuals were infected, using their own forensic methodology. This independently validates\nthe soundness of the forensic methods that the Citizen Lab used in this report to identify\nPegasus infections and targeting.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis report details extensive surveillance directed against Catalan civil society and\ngovernment using mercenary spyware. According to NSO Group, Pegasus is sold\nexclusively to governments, and finding such an operation inevitably implicates a\ngovernment. While we do not currently attribute this operation to specific governmental\n\n\n-----\n\nentities, circumstantial evidence suggests a strong nexus with the government of Spain,\nincluding the nature of the victims and targets, the timing, and the fact that Spain is reported\nto be a government client of NSO Group.\n\n### Call for an Investigation\n\nThe seriousness of the case clearly warrants an official inquiry to determine the responsible\nparty, how the hacking was authorised, what legal framework governed the hacking and what\njudicial oversight applied, the true scale of the operation, the uses to which the hacked\nmaterial was put, and how hacked data was handled, including to whom it may have been\nprovided.\n\n### Window into a More Extensive Operation?\n\nThe list of confirmed victims and targets is striking. Our research has uncovered at least 65\nCatalans whose devices were either infected or targeted with spyware. The investigation was\nlabor-intensive, and there are many individuals who have not had their devices checked.\nFurthermore, our methods have limited insight into Android infections, which represent a\nlarge proportion of users in the region. Thus, we suspect that the total number of victims and\ntargets is much higher.\n\nThis extraordinarily high number of confirmed mercenary spyware victims and targets in a\nsingle case is by far the largest in all of the Citizen Lab’s prior research, including our reports\non _[Al Jazeera (36 victims) and El Salvador (35 victims).](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/)_\n\nOur investigation gives a window into what is likely a larger effort to place a significant slice\nof Catalan civil society under targeted surveillance for several years. This effort has resulted\nin the total surveillance of Catalan politicians in certain categories, such as multiple members\nof the European Parliament and every Catalan president since 2010.\n\n### Unrestrained, Unnecessary, and Disproportionate?\n\nThe case is notable because of the unrestrained nature of the hacking activities. The list\nincludes numerous elected officials of Catalonia’s government, as was every Catalan\nmember of the European Parliament that supported independence. Staff members and\nfriends are also among the list. So, too, were numerous members of Catalan civil society, as\nwell as lawyers representing Catalans (raising questions of attorney-client privilege\nviolations).\n\nEgregiously, family members of apparent targets were also targeted and infected. For\nexample, two physicians who use their devices to handle confidential and sensitive patient\ninformation were likely infected because they are the parents of the true target. Indeed, the\n[prominent physician Dr. Elias Campo (the father of Elies Campo) was infected on his official](https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/serviciosdeprensa/notasprensa/ciencia-e-innovacion/Paginas/2021/170521-pn_investigacion_2020.aspx)\nhospital-issued device.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe hacking also extended beyond Spain into other EU countries, including Belgium and\nGermany, suggesting possible breaches of appropriate conduct for lawful cross-border\ninvestigations, or violations of local law. Targeting was also observed in Switzerland, which\nnotably included impersonating Swiss organisations, including a government-supported\nfoundation, raising further questions about the disregard for Swiss law.\n\nThis very wide target list raises questions about whether the principles of necessity and\n**proportionality have been fulfilled. Many of the victims were not charged with serious**\ncrimes, and most were neither criminals and certainly not terrorists—the typical justifications\nmercenary surveillance companies employ for sales of their spyware to government clients.\n\nIt is also concerning that this surveillance occurred as the Spanish government and Catalan\nofficials were undertaking negotiations around political autonomy. If Spanish authorities are\nresponsible, clandestinely eavesdropping on the opposite side of a negotiation, including in\nsome cases their legal representatives or relatives, is a clear act of bad faith.\n\n### Hacking in the EU: Lack of Rules and Judicial Oversight?\n\nIf the Spanish government is responsible for this case, it raises urgent questions about\nwhether there is proper oversight over the country’s intelligence and security agencies, as\nwell as whether there is a robust legal framework that authorities are required to follow in\nundertaking any hacking activities. Formally, the operations of Spain’s security agencies are\noverseen by the judiciary and the relevant minister. However, it is hard to conceive how a\nproperly functioning oversight mechanism would permit extensive and, in some cases,\nreckless hacking of numerous elected officials at such a sensitive time. It is also unclear what\nsafeguards were in place, if any, to ensure the protection of any hacked data, and how it was\nhandled.\n\nThe hacking of the devices of relatives of principal targets, such as innocent spouses and\nparents, is especially disturbing. Such extensive clandestine hacking by a state against these\ntypes of targets is almost certainly outside of the scope of what would be permissible under\ninternational human rights law.\n\nWhile Europe has recently made great strides around privacy and data protection, such as\n[with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the picture is less bright around the](https://guardint.org/research/)\n[independent oversight of intelligence agencies, which remain largely cloaked in secrecy and](https://www.stiftung-nv.de/en/eion)\nmay be [exempt from rules around privacy applied to other entities. The possibility that an EU](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/national-security-and-defence/#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20exemption%20from,and%20to%20your%20security%20obligationshttps://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/national-security-and-defence/#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20exemption%20from,and%20to%20your%20security%20obligations)\nmember state is responsible for a massive domestic surveillance operation with political\novertones should serve as a wake-up call for a collective inquiry into the need for effective\noversight.\n\nFinally, the case is also notable because Spain is a democracy, and this case adds to the\ngrowing number of other democracies we have discovered that have abused mercenary\nspyware, including Poland, India, Israel, and El Salvador. While it is true and widely\n\n\n-----\n\nacknowledged now that spyware and commercial surveillance technologies embolden\nauthoritarian regimes and are contributing to the spread of authoritarian practices worldwide,\nthis case is a good reminder that all countries are prone to abusing spyware when\nsafeguards and oversight are absent—even democratic ones, like Spain.\n\n### Hacking: A Risky Tool for Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions\n\nThe objective behind the hacking we uncovered is unknown at this time. However, the\npotential application of Pegasus or Candiru spyware to extract information to use in the\ncontext of criminal investigations and prosecutions is risky because it may facilitate the use\nof tainted or planted evidence by state authorities. These risks are particularly prevalent in\n[countries where government hacking is not subject to a rigorous legal framework and](https://privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2018-08/2018.01.17%20Government%20Hacking%20and%20Surveillance.pdf)\neffective judicial oversight, and there are few or no requirements for ensuring the integrity of\ninformation collected.\n\nSpyware such as Pegasus modifies the operating system and files on an infected device. It\nis common guidance that once a device has been remotely penetrated and infected, the\nintegrity of data on the device may be tainted and could certainly be challenged in court.\n\nFurthermore, we observed that Candiru spyware has the capability to send messages under\nthe identity of the victim, from their device. Forensically determining that the victim did not\nsend the messages would be extremely difficult. Such a powerful capability could easily be\n[misused to plant evidence. For example, in a recent case in India where incriminating](https://netalert.me/bhima-koregaon.html)\n[evidence was allegedly planted by hackers on an activist’s device who was then charged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/new-forensic-report-finds-further-evidence-was-planted-in-case-against-indian-activists/bcc1d245-9e41-43e0-820a-b0beaef85a74/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_6)\nwith terrorism.\n\n### Another Indictment of the Mercenary Spyware Industry\n\nThis remarkable combination of high volume and unrestrained abuses points to a serious\nabsence of regulatory constraints, both over sales by the mercenary companies involved and\nthe use of such powerful surveillance tools by the government client or clients. It is now well\nestablished that NSO Group, Candiru, other companies like them, as well as their various\n[ownership groups, have utterly failed to put in place even the most basic safeguards against](https://issues.org/surveillance-spyware-uso-group-pegasus-citizen-lab/)\nabuse of their spyware. What we find in Spain is yet another indictment of this industry.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank all of the civil society organisations, political groups, and individuals\nwho graciously agreed to share forensic artefacts with this investigation, and everyone who\nassisted in gathering materials.
