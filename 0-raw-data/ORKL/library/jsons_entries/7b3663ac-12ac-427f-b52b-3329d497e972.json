This is very true for Magecart threat actors who love to\nimpersonate Google, jQuery and many other popular brands.\n\nIn this post we look at a skimmer recently disclosed by security researchers that has been\naround for over a year but managed to keep a low profile. In addition to naming several of\ntheir domains after Google, the threat actor is also naming their domains after the websites\nthey have compromised.\n\nOften, identifying additional infrastructure on the same network is a relatively simple\nexercize. But in this case it is more complex because the hosting servers are comprised of a\nlarge number of domains names, many of which are also malicious but not skimming related.\nHiding in the noise is another common trait for threat actors.\n\n## Keeping it simple\n\n\n-----\n\nThis skimmer was publicly mentioned by Eric Brandel in early June 2021 and unlike\nMagecart JavaScript code, this one is very straightforward. Jordan Herman had also\n[previously spotted this skimmer and referred to it as](https://twitter.com/TracerSpiff/status/1399840920057659404?s=20) [Lil’ Skim. Based on an urlscan.io crawl,](https://twitter.com/TracerSpiff/status/1399852523347927046?s=20)\n[it appears the earliest instance is from at least March 2020, via googie[.]host.](https://urlscan.io/responses/44bac77e9f8c60d6b01729b2d447b748c7e6e123dfd8ee87867d3fd13489503d/)\n\n[Newish Google themed digital skimming/#magecart domains](https://twitter.com/hashtag/magecart?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\ngoogie-analitycs.site\ngoogie-analytics.online\ngoogie-analytics.website\ngoogletagsmanager.website\n\n[Example on @urlscanio](https://twitter.com/urlscanio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[//googie-analytics.online/js/analytics.jshttps://t.co/wJMx4qP1z3](https://t.co/wJMx4qP1z3)\n\n[Very simple/clean code: pic.twitter.com/L6QuU6ImJR](https://t.co/L6QuU6ImJR)\n\n— Eric Brandel (@AffableKraut) [June 1, 2021](https://twitter.com/AffableKraut/status/1399786791931101192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## A dense network hiding more skimmer domains\n\nA quick review of the [Autonomous System (AS198610 Beget) where those skimmer domains](https://www.arin.net/resources/guide/asn/)\nare found shows a significant number of malicious hosts tied to phishing kits, Windows\npayloads, and Android malware just to name a few. Two IP addresses in particular,\n87.236.16[.]107 and 87.236.16[.]10, are host to additional skimmer domains belonging to Lil’\nSkim.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: VirusTotal Graph showing a number of Google-like domains\n[For example, tidio[.]fun is a play on tidio.com, a chat application for website owners wishing](https://www.tidio.com/)\nto interact with customers. We recognize the same Lil’ Skim code here as well:\n\nFigure 2: tidio[.]fun hosts the same Lil’ Skim skimmer\n\n\n-----\n\n## Custom domains by compromised store\n\nAnd then we discovered a number of skimmer domains that were named after compromised\nstores. This in itself is not a new practice and is often seen with phishing sites. The threat\nactor simply replaced the top level domain name with .site, .website or .pw to create hosts\nthat load the skimmer code and receive stolen credit card data.\n\nFigure 3: Legitimate website and copycat domain hosting a skimmer\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Legitimate website and copycat domain hosting a skimmer\nAll the domains we found (c.f. IOCs) were hosted on 87.236.16[.]107.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLil’ Skim is a simple web skimmer that is fairly easy to identify and differs from other\nMagecart scripts. The threat actor is keen of impersonating internet companies but also the\nvictim sites it goes after.\n\nWe were able to track this actor across the same ASN where they registered a number of\ndifferent domains over a period of at least a year. There likely are more pieces of\ninfrastructure to uncover here, but that might be a time consuming process.\n\nWe have notified the stores that have been impacted by this campaign. Additionally,\nMalwarebytes customers are already protected via our web protection module across our\n[different products including Malwarebytes Browser Guard.](https://www.malwarebytes.com/)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nThe following IOCs are linked to urlscan.io crawls whenever possible.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Standard skimmer domains**\n```\ngoogletagsmanager[.]website\ngoogie-analitycs[.]site\ngoogie-analytics[.]online\ngoogie-analytics[.]website\ncdnattn[.]site\nfacebookmanagers[.]pw\ngoogletagmanager[.]space\ngoogie[.]website\ngoogleapis[.]website\ngoogie[.]host\ntidio[.]fun\njquery[.]fun\ncloudfiare[.]site\n\n```\n**Skimmer domains impersonating compromised sites**\n```\nperfecttux[.]site\ngorillawhips[.]site\nbebedepotplus[.]site\npostguard[.]website\ndirsalonfurniture[.]site\ndogdug[.]website\nbebedepotplus[.]website\nperfecttux[.]website\n\n```\n**Skimmer IPs**\n\n**Known victim sites**\n\n\n-----",
