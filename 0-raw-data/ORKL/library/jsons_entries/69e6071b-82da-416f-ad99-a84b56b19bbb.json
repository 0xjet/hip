    "plain_text": "# China's Narrative War on Democracy\n\n**recordedfuture.com/chinas-narrative-war-democracy/**\n\nInsikt Group\n_“Battles are won with kinetics, but wars are won with influence.” -Ajit Maan_\n\nChina’s entire propaganda system is working at full force in the largest Chinese statesponsored overt influence campaign to date observed by Recorded Future. The narrative\nwarfare operation, which aims to reshape global definitions of democracy, criticize American\ndemocracy, and position China as a democracy itself, has been amplified by nearly every\nChinese state-affiliated media outlet and spokesperson and dozens of state-hired\ninfluencers. With thousands of social media posts, dozens of cartoons and memes, news\narticles and academic reports, panel discussions, and videos that criticize US democracy, the\nnarrative they are pushing is simple: US democracy is harming the world; trust China’s\n**“whole-process people's democracy” instead. This ongoing messaging, which began on**\nDecember 2, 2021, is particularly aimed at global, English-language audiences outside of\nChina and likely began as a preemptive defense campaign ahead of the December 9 and 10\nSummit for Democracy.\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group has translated and analyzed the Communist Party of China’s\n(CCP) propaganda strategies and has found that a primary tactic in its toolbox is the\ncoordination of various communicators, such as news media and civil society organizations,\nto disseminate the party’s messages through “polyphonous communication”. This strategy is\nclearly demonstrated in this influence campaign on democracy. This influence operation\nhighlights classic examples of narrative warfare (the fight over the meaning of information\nand identity) and is being used strategically by the CCP in an attempt to redefine what the\nworld thinks about democracy and sway people towards viewing China not as an autocratic,\nauthoritarian regime, but as a beloved socialist democracy that puts its people first. They call\nthis a [“whole-process people's democracy”. Their objective is simple: isolate the United](https://youtu.be/3r0vXbAapyM)\n**States and reshape governance to a global audience, with China’s model being the**\n**global standard.**\n\n## The Strategy: Consistent Messaging and High Volume\n\nThe CCP’s overt influence campaigns rely on a simple strategy: consistent messaging\nthrough narrative warfare and a high volume of posts and chatter across all online media\nplatforms. The effectiveness of this strategy is difficult to assess. However, China has a\nglobal reach. Its message is being amplified in foreign countries, especially in Belt and Road\nInitiative nations where China has partnerships or ownership of media outlets. Recorded\nFuture has uncovered evidence that China’s propaganda department is contracting with\n\n\n-----\n\nforeign media outlets and marketing companies to disseminate pro-China propaganda in\nforeign countries. The investigation is ongoing, and a full report on this topic is forthcoming.\nBefore this campaign, Chinese state-affiliated media accounts referred to “democracy”\napproximately 5 to 10 times per day, on average. These mentions revolved around news\ncycles related to political topics in foreign countries. However, toward the end of November,\nas US president Joe Biden prepared for and promoted his flagship Summit for Democracy,\nthe Chinese government apparatus responded with an anti-US influence campaign,\nhighlighting perceived weaknesses of US democracy and harm that the US has caused\naround the world. On November 24 and 25, we observed a marked increase of mentions of\n“democracy” across Chinese state-affiliated media accounts, up to 40.\n\n**_Figure 1: Social media activity from China’s state-affiliated accounts mentioning_**\n_[“democracy” spiked on December 2, 2021 (Source: Hamilton Dashboard)](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/hamilton-dashboard/)_\nOn November 29, mentions of democracy jumped again, with nearly 60 each day. However,\nthe most notable increase happened on December 2, with 166 mentions of democracy in a\nsingle day from these same accounts, not counting sharing and amplification activity.\n\nThese statistics align with the promotion of a Chinese state-sponsored virtual event called “A\nDialogue on Democracy — What is democracy and who defines it?”. This two-and-a-halfhour virtual panel discussion was hosted by CGTN, a mouthpiece of the Central Propaganda\nDepartment of the CCP. The event was broadcast online on December 2 and was heavily\npromoted by Chinese diplomats and state-sponsored influencers worldwide. More\ninformation on this event is provided in its own section below.\n\n**_Figure 2: Social media activity from China’s state-affiliated accounts mentioning_**\n_“democracy” increased 20-fold on December 2 (166 mentions) and Dec 9 (162 mentions)_\n_(Source:_ _[Hamilton Dashboard)](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/hamilton-dashboard/)_\nMentions of democracy remained consistent between 80 and 160 mentions per day for the\nremainder of that week while the Summit for Democracy took place on December 9 and 10,\nbefore declining steadily after December 11, following the conclusion of the Summit for\nDemocracy. A few key phrases emerged as the central theme to this campaign: “What kind\nof #democracy is this?”, “What is #democracy?”, and “who defines #democracy?”\n\nSocial media posts, such as the one written by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin\nshown in Figure 3, received thousands of engagements across all major social media\nplatforms. Recorded Future is investigating the activities of accounts amplifying this\ncampaign, including bot-like sharing, commenting, and inauthentic behavior. All of China’s\nprominent spokespersons took part in this campaign, with most activity originating with Hua\nChunying, Zhao Lijian, Wang Wenbin, and various Chinese embassy accounts globally.\n\n**_Figure 3: Social media post from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Wang_**\n_Wenbin_\n\n## The Influencers: China’s Propaganda Choir\n\n\n-----\n\nThis influence campaign on democracy has been the most comprehensive overt effort that\nRecorded Future has observed from the Communist Party of China. The campaign\nembodies the top-down narrative approach, with the highest levels of the Propaganda\nDepartment disseminating messaging down to the lowest levels of individual contributors.\n**_Figure 4: The State Council Information Office press conference announcing the release of_**\n_the white paper “China’s Democracy” (Source: PRC State Council Information Office_\n_website)_\nOn December 4, 2021, the State Council Information Office (Figure 4), referred to internally\nas the External Propaganda Office, held a press conference about the release of a white\npaper called \"China’s Democracy\". The conference was attended by some of the highest\nranking members of China’s propaganda department, an indicator of the importance put on\nthis campaign:\n\nXu Lin, Vice Minister of the Central Propaganda Department and Director of the State\nCouncil Information Office\nXu Yousheng, Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the Central\nCommittee\nTian Peiyan, Deputy Director of the Central Policy Research Office\nGuo Zhenhua, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National\nPeople's Congress\nHu Henglu, Director of the Research Office of the General Office of the CPPCC\nNational Committee\nWang Aiwen, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs\n\n**_Figure 5: China’s sprawling propaganda ecosystem. The State Council Information Office_**\n_[is located at the far right of the diagram. (Source: Clint Watts)](https://clintwatts.substack.com/p/chinas-propaganda-and-disinformation)_\nRecorded Future discovered over 8,470 mentions of “what is #democracy?” throughout open\nsources between December 1 and December 16, 2021. Over 90% of those results originated\nfrom China’s propaganda ecosystem, with state-affiliated new agencies contributing the\nmost. The remaining 10% included amplification, discussion, and counterarguments in\ndiscussion boards, forums, and comment sections. Additionally, we used the Recorded\nFuture platform to investigate the most common phrases (see Appendix A) used in the\ncampaign and highlighted the most prominent themes during December 2 through December\n11, 2021. The highest volume of mentions in open sources happened on December 4, the\nday the State Council announced its white paper release. When removing the phrase “wholeprocess people’s democracy” from search results, the highest volume of mentions occurred\non December 2, the day of CGTN’s Dialogue on Democracy.\n\n**_Figure 6: Mentions of democracy by China’s propaganda ecosystem and state-affiliated_**\n_accounts from December 2 to 11, 2021 (Source: Recorded Future)_\nFollowing the release of the common narrative across all platforms, we observed widespread\namplification and support of the narrative in the wider global propaganda landscape. This\nprocess involved amplification across all major Chinese news outlets: China Daily, CGTN,\n\n\n-----\n\nXinhua News, Global Times, and their global affiliates. Each network shared its own links to\narticles and reports about the topic, including opinion pieces criticizing US democracy,\narguing that Western democracies are failing the world, and highlighting nations globally that\nare allying with China instead of Western democracies.\n\n**_Figure 7: China’s state-affiliated tabloid Global Times promoted an opinion article about_**\n_the “woes of US democracy” via social media on December 10_\n\n## “A Dialogue on Democracy”: China’s Attempt at Defining Democracy\n\nOn December 2, 2021, one week before the Summit for Democracy hosted by President Joe\nBiden, China’s state-affiliated media company CGTN, hosted a live virtual panel discussion\non YouTube, called “A Dialogue on Democracy — What is democracy and who defines it?”.\nThis virtual summit, hosted by CGTN anchor Wang Guan, was delivered in English from\nBeijing and featured the following guest panelists: Le Yucheng (Vice Minister of Foreign\nAffairs of China), Eric Li S.M. (Vice Chairman of China Forum, Center for International\nSecurity and Strategy, Tsinghua University), Zhang Weiwei (Director of the China Institute at\nFudan University), Kishore Mahbubani (Distinguished Fellow at the Asia Research Institute,\nNational University of Singapore), Martin Jacques (Former Senior Fellow at the Department\nof Politics and International Studies, Cambridge University), and John Ross (Former Director\nof Economic and Business Policy for the Mayor of London). **_Figure 8: China comparing its_**\n_approval ratings with the US in the Dialogue on Democracy. Recorded Future found the_\n_original source of this chart from a 2017 World Economic Forum presentation of a 2016 (pre-_\n_COVID) survey by Ipsos Public Affairs, which queried citizens on their views of their own_\n_country, not that of other countries. (Sources:_ _[YouTube /](https://youtu.be/aMTsMh3vtSs)_ _[World Economic Forum)](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/which-countries-are-on-the-right-track-according-to-their-citizens/)_\nThe panel opened with Le Yucheng saying,\n\n\"Recently, democracy is being widely discussed around the world. This should have been a\ngood thing. But a very few countries are using democracy as a cover … They even take\ndemocracy as a political tour for selfish gains and build small blocks to create division and\nconfrontation in the world. This obviously runs against the spirit of democracy.\"\n\nIn his opening statements, Le also stated the purpose of the dialogue: “Clear up confusion,\npromote right conceptions, and look for the right way of democracy”. The first question Le\nposed and answered was, “Is China a democracy or not?”, adding, “Some in the West claim\nthat there seems to be no democracy in China, and that the Communist Party of China is just\nauthoritarian and autocratic”. Le continued, “In their eyes, although China has created many\nmiracles of long-term stability, rapid development, and poverty reduction, and the\ngovernment has the universal support of the Chinese people, yet China is still a country\nwithout democracy and without human rights.”\n\nFrom the outset of the dialogue, it was clear that the Chinese government was implementing\na holistic approach to countering Western criticism of its authoritarian, autocratic governance\nmodel, one of the objectives of the US-hosted Summit for Democracy on December 9 and\n\n\n-----\n\n10. The holistic approach is very similar to the Russian Active Measures playbook and is\noften referred to as the 4D approach: dismiss, distract, distort, and dismay.\n\nThe panel discussion focused on redefining what democracy is and posited that China’s\n“whole process people’s democracy” is its improved version of socialist democracy for the\n21st-century globalized world. Spokespersons for the Chinese government have created\ncountless graphs, charts, images, and explanations for this concept, as illustrated in\nspokesperson Hua Chunying’s social media posts, one of which is shown in Figure 9:\n\n**_Figure 9: China’s explanation for considering its system a “whole-process people’s_**\n_democracy” (Source: Hua Chunying)_\nOn December 8, the day before President Biden’s Summit For Democracy, [CGTN aired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r0vXbAapyM)\nanother show called “Compared with the West, what is China's whole-process people's\ndemocracy?” via YouTube and its own media channels. The program claimed to be an\ninternational forum on democracy boasting “more than 500 attendees from over 120\ncountries and regions and more than 20 international organizations, online and offline.” The\ntopic was “What is the essence of democracy? And how is the Chinese practice of\ndemocracy?”, with special emphasis on the opinions of foreign academics and international\nrelations experts on what democracy really is, how the US definition of democracy is limited\nand often incorrect, and how China is a democracy in its own right. The use of paid foreign\n[experts, which they call “global stringers”, is a tactic that CGTN has adopted over the past](https://www.cgtn.com/gstringer)\nyear to achieve more “precise communication” to global audiences and build China’s\nreputation among Western audiences.\n\nDespite widespread amplification of this influence campaign, the individual posts on\nmainstream social media platforms have received minimal engagement and strong\ncounterarguments against the idea of China being a democracy. The comment sections and\nsharing activity of the original content appear to be amplified by other accounts within the\nChinese propaganda ecosystem and by users in other countries. Recorded Future cannot\nverify the authenticity of the accounts that are posting support or dissent of this content at\nthis time, but our investigation and monitoring of this campaign continues, which includes\nattribution and dissemination analysis.
