The campaign masquerades as official communications](https://www.prevailion.com/darkwatchman-new-fileless-techniques/)\nfrom the Russian Government’s Federal Bailiffs Service, the Russian-language emails are\naddressed to users in Lithuania, Estonia, and Russia in the Telecommunications, Electronic\nand Industrial sectors. The activity predates and is not believed to be associated with the\nRussian-led invasion of Ukraine.\n\nX-Force assesses that it is possible the targeting of telecommunication providers and their\nindustry adjacent suppliers may be intended as ultimately serving to enable illegal access to\nnumerous distributed clients and end-users.\n\nDarkWatchman is a malicious Remote Access Trojan (RAT) based on JavaScript, using\n[command and control (C2) mechanisms for fileless persistence, as well as other capabilities.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/fileless-malware)\n\nThe phishing activity discovered by X-Force (tracked internally as Hive0117) aligns with\nresearch published in December 2021, detailing a similar phishing campaign designed to\n[deliver a DarkWatchman payload by imitating a Russia-based freight and logistics company.](https://www.prevailion.com/darkwatchman-new-fileless-techniques/)\n\nGiven the elevated levels of threat activity associated with the ongoing regional crisis, the\nevidence may suggest that threat actors will leverage the current climate to conduct and\nobfuscate further activity.\n\n## Hive0117 Activity Assessment\n\nX-Force assesses Hive0117 phishing campaigns are likely criminally motivated in nature\ngiven the target selection and focuses of current and previous activities. Additionally, while\nthe target list of the phishing campaign attributed to Hive0117 has regional associations with\nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine, the activity predates the invasion, indicating the separate\nfrom any politically charged associations that have spurred recent waves of criminal activity,\n[such as the attack on a German subsidiary of a Russian state-affiliated energy company.](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article237518665/Rosneft-Deutsche-Tochter-wurde-Ziel-eines-Cyberangriffs.html)\n\nNevertheless, given the evolving nature of criminal activity prompted by the conflict,\nlanguage capability, target focus, and relative sophistication of the actor, it is likely Hive0117related activity possesses an elevated threat to entities and enterprises based in-region.\n\n## Hive0117 Phishing Activity\n\nX-Force discovered multiple emails that were sent in mid-February 2022 to individual users,\nincluding a state-owned communication company based in Lithuania, a prominent Industrial\nEnterprise in Estonia, and several electronic and telecommunication businesses located in\nRussia. In some cases, the emails were targeting company owners, as well as individuals in\n\n\n-----\n\nleadership positions associated with Dispatch Services and Sales. Targeted organizations\ncould be of high value to criminal actors given the targets’ potential trusted access to wide,\nand distributed client base.\n\nThe emails are crafted to appear to originate from the official address of the Federal Bailiffs\nService in Russia, a federal law enforcement agency under the Russian Ministry of Justice;\nhowever, header examination revealed that some of the emails were received from\nshtampuy[.]ru (free.ds [185.64.76.158]). The majority of emails feature the return path\naddress [[email protected][.]fssprus[.]ru, meant to imitate the organization’s authentic address](https://securityintelligence.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n[https://r77.fssp.gov[.]ru. However, for unknown reasons, a single instance imitates a sender](https://r77.fssp.gov/)\nwhich seeks to pose as the head of a purported Russian investment company. The subjects\nof Hive0117 emails, including official notices, are eye-catching and are likely intended to\ncompel the target to open the email and access the attachment.\n\n_Image 1: Sample of email return path and subject line_\n\nThe contents of the emails feature identical Russian-language text detailing several articles\nrelated to enforcement procedures associated with the Kuntsevsky District Court of Moscow,\nupheld by the “Bailiff of the Interdistrict Department of Bailiffs for the Execution of Decisions\nof the Tax Authorities.” The only variation observed by X-Force within the emails is in the\nname and “case number” associated with the individual email and accompanying malicious\nZIP archive file attachment.\n\n_Image 2: Sample email body_\n\nX-Force assesses that it is possible the targeting of telecommunication providers and their\nindustry adjacent suppliers may be intended as ultimately serving to enable illegal access to\nnumerous distributed clients and end-users.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware Payload\n\nThe emails X-Force uncovered contain archive files either named “Исполнительный лист\nXXXXXXX-22.zip”, where the “X” indicates a numeric value, or “Счет 63711-21 от\n30.12.2021.zip”, translated respectively to “Performance List”, “Writ of Execution”, and\n“Invoice”. Each archive file contains an executable of the same name, designed to deliver the\nDarkWatchman JavaScript backdoor and encrypted source code for a keylogger similarly to\nthe report from December 2021.\n\nIn addition, X-Force discovered downloader files designed to deliver the DarkWatchman\nmalware, by contacting domtut[.]site|fun|online and downloading files to %TEMP%. Un\nexecution a self-extracting archive (SFX) installer drops two files: a Javascript (JS) file and a\nfile containing a series of hexadecimal characters. The JS file contains obfuscated code that\nfunctions as the backdoor and the hexadecimal data contains encrypted data that when\ndecrypted, contains a block of base64 encoded PowerShell that executes a keylogger. The\nconfiguration contains a comment in Russian text, which translates to “The comment below\ncontains SFX script commands” (;Расположенный ниже комментарий содержит команды\nSFX-сценария), indicating that the author of the malware is a Russian-language speaker,\npossibly based in, or originating from, a Russian-speaking territory.\n\nGiven the fileless nature of the malware, coupled with a JavaScript and a keylogger written in\nC#, and the abilities to remove traces of its existence on the compromised system when\ninstructed, X-Force assesses that malicious actor(s) behind Hive0117 activity are of\nmoderate sophistication.\n\n## Malware Infrastructure\n\nThe majority of the new malware samples discovered by X-Force, appear to be based on a\nC2 IP address (103.153.157[.]33) previously associated with Hive0117 activity. One of the\nsamples was submitted to Virus Total in February 2022 and is configured to use several C2\ndomains including d303790c[.]top, which overlaps with previously uncovered malicious\nexecutable Накладная №12-6317-3621.exe.\n\nThe DarkWatchman malware analyzed by X-Force uses a domain generation algorithm\n(DGA) to generate a list of C2 domains, in which the malware attempts to communicate with.\nThe DGA requires [a salt as input stored in the configuration key b, or the default salt](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/identity/what-is-salt/)\n_d46ebd15 is used if the key is not set. A list of hard-coded domain strings is contained in an_\narray, with the analyzed samples containing the following list:\n\n3a60dc39, 4d67ecaf, d303790c, a404499a, 3d0d1820, 4a0a28b6, dab53527, adb205b1,\n44e645b3, 500ed27c, c8690767, 17c45148, 13e1ced9, e123fe80, 136e9446, 5937c7c6,\n7c7cb9a4, 9eaa332e, 97815a39, 6a090054\n\n## IOCs\n\n\n-----\n\n### Files\n\n**File Name** **Hash**\n\nИсполнительный лист 1840120-22.exe d68180819bb8eb8207dc6ab74c1a4642\n\nИсполнительный лист 1909102-22.exe 2bd8ee514c13a06687b5775e0a9eaf71\n\nИсполнительный лист 16301123-22.exe b25b24998800da7b5cf17879f2eb83ed\n\nИсполнительный лист 1711390-22.exe 79b824bb99b4cc4f5da880371de52977\n\nИсполнительный лист 154211671.scr a4f19fba9a5ec97d3560cd43c4bd5507\n\nИсполнительный лист 154211671.scr a34809f26a22e0127e99597fed9169bf\n\nСчет 63711-21 от 30.12.2021.exe 75a3b83d2b4131132d76d92190f045ec\n\n### Domains\n\n3a60dc39[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n4d67ecaf[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\nd303790c[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\na404499a[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n3d0d1820[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n4a0a28b6[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\ndab53527[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\nadb205b1[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n44e645b3[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n500ed27c[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\nc8690767[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n17c45148[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n13e1ced9[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\ne123fe80[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n136e9446[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n5937c7c6[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n7c7cb9a4[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n9eaa332e[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n97815a39[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n6a090054[.]\\(top|fun|online|site)\n\n### URLs\n\nhttp[:]//domtut[.]\\(fun|online|site)\n\n### IP Addresses\n\n\n-----\n\n103.153.157.33\n\n[Melissa Frydrych](https://securityintelligence.com/author/melissa-frydrych/)\nThreat Hunt Researcher, IBM\n\nMelissa is an analyst on the Threat Hunt & Discovery Team within IBM X-Force.
