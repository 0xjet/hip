    "plain_text": "## y y\n\n##### By GReAT on March 9, 2018. 5:00 pm\n\nSofacy, also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Tsar Team, is a prolific, well\n\nresourced, and persistent adversary. They are sometimes portrayed as\n\nwild and reckless, but as seen under our visibility, the group can be\n\npragmatic, measured, and agile. Our previous post on their 2017 activity\n\nstepped away from the previously covered headline buzz presenting their\n\nassociation with previously known political hacks and interest in Europe\n\nand the US, and examines their under-reported ongoing activity in middle\n\neast, central asia, and now a shift in targeting further east, including\n\nChina, along with an overlap surprise. There is much understated activity\n\nthat can be clustered within this set and overlap in APT activity. Here, we\n\nexamine current deployment, code, cryptography, and targeting.\n\nEssentially, this examination finds the group maintains subdivisions of\n\nefforts in targeting, development, and coding. Comparisons to other\n\nmodules quickly shows a delineation in other Sofacy efforts. SPLM,\n\nGAMEFISH, and Zebrocy delivery all maintain their own clusters, but\n\nfrequently overlap later.\n\nBecause SPLM is their primary and selective second stage tool, SPLM\n\ndeployment is of much interest. But Zebrocy efforts are in such high\n\nvolume, that these modules need examination as well.\n\n# SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent Code\n\nSPLM, otherwise known as CHOPSTICK, or by the author(s) as “XAgent”, is\n\ndescribed as Sofacy’s signature second stage tool, selectively used for\n\nyears against around the world. Really, many modified XAgent modules\n\nhave been deployed over the years. Even the individual Linux modules\n\nrenamed as “Fysbis” backdoors released in 2016 were merely modified\n\nand reduced portions of recompiled XAgent C/C++ codebase. Anyway,\n\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK has maintained various combinations of code, with\n\nsome recognizable functionality listed here.\n\nSource Modules Channels\n\nModules Keylogger HTTP\n\nChannels RemoteShell FTP\n\nBoot FileSystem SMTP\n\nLibrary Launcher\n\nM i H dl C Sh\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot\n\nFileObserver\n\nPasswordFirefox\n\nInfoOS\n\nVersion 3 and early version 4 SPLM modules maintained keylogger,\n\nremoteshell, and filestealer code all within the larger compiled backdoor,\n\nand executed each body of functionality from within that process\n\nmemory space. Later v4 SPLM injected individual keylogger, filestealer,\n\nand remoteshell modules into memory space. But for the most part,\n\ndeployed SPLM maintained the structure of earlier executable code. In\n\n2018, we now see them pushing individual and separate blobs of\n\nkeylogger, filesystem, and remoteshell code that never touch disk. The\n\nlarger, 300kb+ SPLM backdoors deployed in 2016 and 2017 are not\n\nobserved any longer at targets in 2018. Instead, in-memory modules\n\nappear in isolation.\n\nIn addition to purely XAgent based code, we also observe zebrocy\n\nmodules completely recoded into powershell from .Net.\n\n# Code and Crypto Comparisons\n\nCurrent SPLM code maintains the unusual cipher hack that Sofacy began\n\ndeploying in 2017 to hide away configuration details. Comparisons with\n\ncipher design and implementations we see in WhiteBear, earlier SPLM and\n\nZebrocy modules tell a few things about design decisions and culture.\n\nAnd when specific malware sets are selectively deployed, that may tell us\n\nsomething about how efforts are divided.\n\nSPLM full backdoor and plugins crypto and strings v4\n\n973ff7eb7a5b720c5f6aafe4cd0469d5\n\nSummary: SPLM is being carved up and delivered as memory-only chunks\n\nof compiled code. We observe the “retranslator” code, or\n\nProcessRetranslator.dll, currently being delivered to systems without the\n\npresence of the previous, large, SPLM code and injection capabilities. The\n\nsmaller plugins deployed in 2018 now maintain the same dynamic\n\nencryption code as the large 330kb full SPLM backdoors seen in more\n\nwidespread use in 2017. Strings are well organized and concise.\n\nCode and strings example (decrypted from 2018 “ProcessRetranslator.dll”\n\nplugin):\n\n\nsuccess command not correct\n\n\n-----\n\ncommand processing error\n\nnot correct command\n\ncommand loading func/net module error\n\ncommand unloading func/net module error\n\ncmd.exe\n\nRetranslator is now launched\n\nRetranslator is now stopped\n\nthe process is destroyed\n\none thread has died so the process is killed too\n\ncreate process failed on: (%s), error (%d)\n\nRetranslator is already running\n\nRetranslator is not running\n\nexit\n\ncommand is successful\n\ncommand is unsuccessful\n\n\nSPLM crypto v3 (DNC hack)\n\ncc9e6578a47182a941a478b276320e06\n\nSummary: This earlier SPLM variant found on the DNC network in 2016\n\nstill maintains the internal name “splm.dll”, with only one export “init” that\n\nwas called at runtime. The C++ structure of this 280kb+ dll is familiar\n\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK, but it maintains a completely different cipher for\n\ndecrypting configuration data and error messages, etc. The loop\n\nperforming the bulk of the work is less than 100 bytes, performing pointer\n\narithmetic alongside a couple xor operations of a lower nibble against\n\nsequential bytes.\n\nHere, the cipher uses a modolo pointer arithmetic along with a\n\ndecryption key per blob. Reviewing all the older ciphers and newer EC\n\nbased ciphers in openssl and elsewhere results in no match.\n\nWhiteBear code and strings\n\nSummary: WhiteBear is a cluster of activity targeting foreign embassies\n\nand MFA organizations, starting in early 2016 and continued into early\n\n2017 Our private GReAT report on this activity pushed in February 2017\n\n\n-----\n\ncontent almost seven months later as “Gayzer”. It appeared to be a\n\nparallel project to WhiteAtlas Turla, and maintained quirks like modular,\n\nwell logged code with an elegant, professional RSA and 3DES encryption\n\nimplementation and high quality code injection capabilities, but lots of\n\nimmature and crude language and english mistakes. Clearly, english and\n\nmaturity was not the developers’ native language.\n\nWhile WhiteBear is Turla related, it is interesting to compare to other\n\nongoing development styles. Strings and code are crass.\n\nDebug and command strings\n\n\ni cunt waiting anymore #%d\n\nlights aint turnt off with #%d\n\nNot find process\n\nCMessageProcessingSystem::Receive_NO_CONNECT_TO\n\n_GAYZER\n\nCMessageProcessingSystem::Receive_TAKE_LAST_CONN\n\nECTION\n\nCMessageProcessingSystem::Send_TAKE_FIN\n\n\nZebrocy custom crypto\n\nSummary: innovative .Net, AutoIT, Delphi, and powershell components\n\nare continually updated and deployed to new and old targets.\n\nCryptography ranges from built-in windows api to custom RC4-based\n\nciphers. Strings and code are simple, innovative, and concise.\n\nCode:\n\n\n-----\n\n# Targeting Overlap and a Pivot to Asia\n\nNews headlines repeatedly trumpet Sofacy’s foray into Western targets in\n\nthe US and Europe, especially those connected with NATO. But these\n\nefforts only tell a portion of the Sofacy story.\n\nDelineating groups and activity can be messy, and there appears to be\n\noverlap in targeting efforts across varying groups in central and east asia\n\nthroughout 2017 and into 2018. Sofacy has been heavily interested in\n\nmilitary and foreign affairs organizations here, resulting in multiple\n\noverlapped and competing targeting scenarios:\n\nMosquito Turla and Zebrocy clusters – Zebrocy clusters targeting\n\ndiplomatic and commercial organizations within Europe and Asia that\n\nmatch Mosquito targeting profiling\n\nSPLM overlap with traditional Turla – often Turla precedes SPLM\n\ndeployments\n\nSPLM overlap with Zebrocy – Zebrocy often precedes SPLM\n\ndeployments\n\n\n-----\n\nCurrently, Sofacy targets large air-defense related commercial\n\norganizations in China with SPLM, and moves Zebrocy focus across\n\nArmenia, Turkey, Kazahkstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, China, and\n\nJapan. A previous, removed, report from another vendor claimed non\nspecific information about the groups’ interest in Chinese universities, but\n\nthat report has been removed – most likely detections were related to\n\nstudents’ and researchers’ scanning known collected samples and any\n\n“incidents” remain unconfirmed and unknown. On the other hand, this\n\nChinese conglomerate designs and manufactures aerospace and air\n\ndefense technologies, among many other enterprises. And here, an\n\ninterest in military technologies is certainly within Sofacy purview.\n\nSo, even more interesting than the shift eastward and other targeting\n\noverlap, is that the specific target system in China was previously a Grey\n\nLambert target. The Sofacy modules at this system appeared to never\n\ntouch disk, and resemble the Linux Fysbis code. Only one maintained the\n\nFilesystem.dll code, while another maintained ProcessRetranslator.dll\n\ncode. However, it is unusual that a full SPLM backdoor was not detected\n\non this system, nor was any powershell loader script. Because the\n\ninjection source remains unidentified on such a unique system, we might\n\nspeculate on what is going on here:\n\n1. Sofacy attackers had recorded a previous Grey Lambert remote\n\nsession and replayed the communication after discovering this host,\n\nessentially compromising the Grey Lambert module on the system to\n\ngain access and later injecting SPLM modules\n\n2. Grey Lambert attackers inserted false flag and reduced SPLM modules\n\n3. a new and unrecognized, full variant of SPLM attempted to inject\n\nmodule code into memory and deleted itself\n\n4. an unknown new powershell script or legitimate but vulnerable web\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSofacy is such a large, active group that appears to maintain multiple sub\ngroups and efforts that all fit under the Sofacy “umbrella”. Sometimes,\n\nthey share infrastructure, but more often they do not share infrastructure\n\nand appear to compete for access within targets. Either way, the group’s\n\nconsistent activity throughout central and eastern asia seems to be poorly\n\nrepresented in the public discussion.\n\nSPLM did not change in substantial ways for several years, and now it is\n\nbeing split up and used for just functional modules. And much of the\n\nmalware being deployed by Sofacy is quickly changed from C/C++ to\n\n.Net to powershell. Other open source and semi-legitimate pen-testing\n\ntools like nbtscan and powercat are being used for mapping available\n\nresources and lateral movement as well. It is easy to expect deliberate\n\nchanges within this group in 2018, with even more .Net, Delphi, and\n\npowershell ports of various tools appearing at Sofacy targets throughout\n\nthe year.\n\n# Technical Appendix\n\nEarly 2018 Reference Set\n\nSPLM\n\n452ed4c80c1d20d111a1dbbd99d649d5\n\nZEBROCY\n\nefd8a516820c44ddbf4cc8ed7f30df9c\n\nff0e4f31a6b18b676b9518d4a748fed1\n\nGAMEFISH\n\nbd3e9f7e65e18bb9a7c4ff8a8aa3a784\n\nGREY LAMBERT\n\n86146d38b738d5bfaff7e85a23dcc53e\n\nGREYWARE/PEN-TESTING NBTSCAN\n\nf01a9a2d1e31332ed36c1a4d2839f412\n\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/all?tag=538) [APT CRIMINAL](https://securelist.com/all?tag=657) [SOFACY](https://securelist.com/all?tag=736) [TARGETED ATTACK](https://securelist.com/all?tag=954)\n\n\nShare post on:\n\n####   \n\n\n-----\n\n##### The Slingshot APT FAQ\n\n\n##### The devil’s in the Rich header\n\n\n##### OlympicDestroyer is here to trick the industry\n\n\n-----",
