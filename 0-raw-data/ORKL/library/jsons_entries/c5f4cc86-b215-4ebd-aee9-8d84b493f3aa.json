The subject is a series of targeted\nattacks against private companies around the world.\n\nIn the course of our research we uncovered the activity of a hacking group which has Chinese origins.\nThis group was named “Winnti”.\n\nAccording to our estimations, this group has been active for several years and specializes in\ncyberattacks against the online video game industry. The group’s main objective is to steal source\ncodes for online game projects as well as the digital certificates of legitimate software vendors. In\naddition, they are very interested in how network infrastructure (including the production of gaming\nservers) is set up, and new developments such as conceptual ideas, design and more.\n\nWe weren’t the first to focus on this group and investigate their attacks. In 2010 US-based HBGary\ninvestigated an information security incident related to the Winnti group at one of HBGary’s customers –\nan American video game company.\n\n## In the Beginning Was …\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the autumn of 2011, a Trojan was detected on a huge number of computers – all of them linked by\nthe fact that they were used by players of a popular online game. It emerged that the piece of malware\nlanded on users’ computers as part of a regular update from the game’s official update server. Some\neven suspected that the publisher itself was spying on players. However, it later became clear that the\nmalicious program ended up on the users’ computers by mistake: the cybercriminals were in fact\ntargeting the companies that develop and release computer games.\n\nThe computer game publisher whose servers spread the Trojan asked Kaspersky Lab to analyze the\nmalicious program that was found on its update server. It turned out to be a DLL library compiled for a\n64-bit Windows environment and even had a properly signed malicious driver.\n\nThe malicious DLL landed on gamers’ computers running under either 32-bit or 64-bit operating\nsystems. It couldn’t start in 32-bit environments, but it could, under certain conditions, launch without\nthe user’s knowledge or consent in 64-bit environments, though no such accidental launches have\nbeen detected.\n\nThe DLL contained a backdoor payload, or, to be exact, the functionality of a fully-fledged Remote\nAdministration Tool (RAT), which gave cybercriminals the ability to control the victim computer without\nthe user’s knowledge.\n\nThe malicious module turned out to be the first time we saw Trojan applications for the 64-bit version of\nMicrosoft Windows with a valid digital signature. We had seen similar cases before, but all previous\nincidents where digital signatures were abused affected only 32-bit applications.\n\nAt an early stage of our research, we identified a fair number of similar backdoors, both 32-bit and 64bit, in our collection of malware samples that were detected under various verdicts. We grouped them\ntogether into a separate family. Symantec appears to be the first to name these malicious programs; we\nkept Symantec’s name – Winnti – in the name of the malware family we created:\nBackdoor.Win32(Win64).Winnti. As for the people behind these attacks involving this remote\nadministration tool, we ended up calling them “the Winnti group”.\n\nInterestingly, the digital signature belonged to another video game vendor – a private company known\nas KOG, based in South Korea. This company’s main business was MMRPG games, exactly the same\narea as the first victim.\n\nWe contacted KOG, whose certificate was used to sign the malicious software, and notified Verisign,\nwhich issued the certificate for KOG. As a result the certificate was revoked.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Digital Certificates\n\nWhen we discovered the first stolen digital certificate we didn’t realize that stealing the certificates and\nsigning malware for future attacks against other targets was the preferred method of this group. Over\nthe next 18 months we discovered more than a dozen similar compromised digital certificates.\n\nMoreover, we found that those digital certificates seemed to have been used in attacks organized by\nother hacking groups, presumably coming from China.\n\n[For example, in an attack against South Korean social networks Cyworld and Nate in 2011 the](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14323787)\nattackers used a Trojan that was digitally signed using a certificate of from the gaming company YNK\nJapan Inc.\n\nA digital certificate of the same company was used recently (March 2013) in Trojans deployed against\nTibetan and Uyghur activists. In fact, this story dates back to 2011. We highly recommend this Norman\nblogpost about a similar incident: http://blogs.norman.com/2011/security-research/invisible-ynk-a-codesigning-conundrum .\n\n[At the same time, in March 2013, Uyghur activists were targeted by other malware, which was digitally](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002524.html)\nsigned by another gaming company called MGAME Corp.\n\nWe believe that the source of all these stolen certificates could be the same Winnti group. Either this\ngroup has close contacts with other Chinese hacker gangs, or it sells the certificates on the black\nmarket in China.\n\nBelow is the list of known compromised companies and digital certificates used by the Winnti group in\ndifferent campaigns:\n\n**Company** **Serial number** **Country**\n\nESTsoft Corp 30 d3 fe 26 59 1d 8e ac 8c 30 66 7a c4 99 9b d7 South Korea\n\n\n-----\n\nKog Co., Ltd. 66 e3 f0 b4 45 9f 15 ac 7f 2a 2b 44 99 0d d7 09 South Korea\n\nLivePlex Corp 1c aa 0d 0d ad f3 2a 24 04 a7 51 95 ae 47 82 0a South Korea/ Philippines\n\nMGAME Corp 4e eb 08 05 55 f1 ab f7 09 bb a9 ca e3 2f 13 cd South Korea\n\nRosso Index KK 01 00 00 00 00 01 29 7d ba 69 dd Japan\n\nSesisoft 61 3e 2f a1 4e 32 3c 69 ee 3e 72 0c 27 af e4 ce South Korea\n\nWemade 61 00 39 d6 34 9e e5 31 e4 ca a3 a6 5d 10 0c 7d Japan/South Korea/US\n\nYNK Japan 67 24 34 0d db c7 25 2f 7f b7 14 b8 12 a5 c0 4d Japan\n\nGuangzhou YuanLuo 0b 72 79 06 8b eb 15 ff e8 06 0d 2c 56 15 3c 35 China\n\nFantasy Technology Corp 75 82 f3 34 85 aa 26 4d e0 3b 2b df 74 e0 bf 32 China\n\nNeowiz 5c 2f 97 a3 1a bc 32 b0 8c ac 01 00 59 8f 32 f6 South Korea\n\n## Victims\n\n[It’s tempting to assume that Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) primarily target high-level institutions:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Persistent_Threat)\ngovernment agencies, ministries, the military, political organizations, power stations, chemical plants,\ncritical infrastructure networks and so on. In this context it seems unlikely that a commercial company\nwould be at risk unless it was operating on the scale of Google, Adobe or The New York Times, which\nwas recently targeted by a cyberattack, and this perception is reinforced by the publicity that attacks on\ncorporations and government organizations usually receive. However, any company with data that can\nbe effectively monetized is at risk from APTs. This is exactly what we encountered here: it was not a\ngovernmental, political, military, or industrial organization but gaming companies that were targeted.\n\nIt’s difficult to name all the victims of the Winnti team. Judging by the information that we have at our\ndisposal – namely the tags within malicious programs, the names of the C&C domains, the companies\nwhose digital certificates were stolen to sign malware, and the countries where detection notifications\ncame from – we can say that at least 35 companies have been infected by Winnti malware at some\ntime.\n\nCountries where the affected companies are located:\n\n**Asia** **Europa** **South America** **North America**\n\nVietnam Belarus Brazil USA\n\nIndia Germany Peru\n\nIndonesia Russia\n\nChina\n\nTaiwan\n\nThailand\n\n\n-----\n\nPhillipines\n\nS. Korea\n\nJapan\n\nThis data demonstrates that the Winnti team is targeting gaming companies located in various parts of\nthe world, albeit with a strong focus on SE Asia.\n\n**Countries where gaming companies have been affected**\n\nSuch geographic diversity is hardly surprising. Often, gaming companies (both publishers and\ndevelopers) are international, having representatives and offices worldwide. Also, it is common practice\nfor gaming companies from various regions to cooperate. The developers of a game may be located in\na different country from its publisher. When a game later reaches markets in regions away from its initial\n‘home’, it is often localized and published by other publishers. In the course of this cooperation, the\npartner companies often grant each other access to network resources to exchange data associated\nwith the gaming content, including distribution kits, gaming resources, resource assembly kits, etc. If\none company in the network gets infected, it’s easy for the cybercriminals to spread the infection\nthroughout the partnership chain.\n\n## Winnti C&Cs Structure\n\nDuring the investigation, we identified over a hundred malicious programs, every single one compiled to\nattack a particular company. Typically, separate C&C domains were assigned to each targeted\ncompany. Virtually all the C&C domains were arranged as follows: a second-level domain was created\nwithout a DNS A-record, i.e., there was no IP address assigned to it.\n\nIn case there was an A-record, the assigned IP address was typically 127.0.0.1. It is also noteworthy\nthat some of the second-level domains that the cybercriminals created for their C&C had very similar\nnames to the domain hosting the site of a certain real gaming company. And the malicious users’\n\n\n-----\n\ndomain was resolved to the same IP address which the site of the real gaming company used. In any\ncase, the third-level domains resolved to IP addresses assigned to the attackers’ actual C&C servers.\n\n**C&C domain naming**\n\n**and resolution**\n\nSometimes the Winnti team registered their C&C units with public hosts. Judging by the samples\nidentified, these C&C centers were subdomains of such domains as 6600.org, 8866.org, 9966.org or\nddns.net.\n\nFrom the names of the C&C domains or subdomains, the attack targets or countries of residence could\nbe guessed, as in:\n```\nru.gcgame.info\nkr.zzsoft.info\njp.xxoo.co\nus.nhntech.com\nfs.nhntech.com\nas.cjinternet.us\n\n```\nThe subdomains “ru”, “kr”, “jp” and “us” most probably mean that these C&C servers manage bots\nhosted on the computers of companies located in Russia, South Korea, Japan and the US respectively,\nwhile “fs” and “as” are acronyms for the names of the companies being attacked.\n\nSometimes Winnti’s malicious programs had a local IP address, such as 192.168.1.136, specified in\ntheir settings for the C&C. This could mean that at some point of time there was an infected computer\nthat did not have a connection to the Internet, but the cybercriminals needed control over it (it may have\nbeen infected while malware was spread via a corporate network). In this case, the cybercriminals\ndeployed a dedicated local C&C server on another compromised computer within the same local\nnetwork which did have an Internet connection; via that C&C, the first victim computer could be\ncontrolled. System administrators often try to isolate critical computers from the outside world. This\ndecreases the probability of haphazard infection, but, apparently, does not always help in a targeted\nattack.\n\nIn the Winnti samples that were detected and analyzed, we found 36 unique C&C domains. Most\nprobably, this is only a small portion of all existing Winnti C&C domains, as we only managed to obtain\nsome of the samples from this malware family. This is hardly surprising since these malicious programs\nare used to execute targeted attacks, so no information is available about many instances of infection;\nfor this reason, we have no way of obtaining samples of the malware used in these undisclosed\nattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain names used in the attacks we discovered:**\n\nnewpic.dyndns.tv lp.zzsoft.info ru.gcgame.info\n\nupdate.ddns.net lp.gasoft.us kr.jcrsoft.com\n\nnd.jcrsoft.com eya.jcrsoft.com wm.ibm-support.net\n\ncc.nexoncorp.us ftpd.9966.org fs.nhntech.com\n\nkr.zzsoft.info kr.xxoo.co docs.nhnclass.com\n\nas.cjinternet.us wi.gcgame.info rh.jcrsoft.com\n\nca.zzsoft.info tcp.nhntech.com wm.nhntech.com\n\nsn.jcrsoft.com ka.jcrsoft.com wm.myxxoo.com\n\nlp.apanku.com my.zzsoft.info ka.zzsoft.info\n\nsshd.8866.org jp.jcrsoft.com ad.jcrsoft.com\n\nftpd.6600.org su.cjinternet.us my.gasoft.us\n\ntcpiah.googleclick.net vn.gcgame.info\n\nrss.6600.org ap.nhntech.com\n\nKnowing the 2nd level domains used by Winnti, we brute forced through all 3 level subdomains up to 4rd\nsymbols long, and identified those that have the IP addresses of real servers assigned to them. Having\nsearched through subdomains for a total of 12 2nd level domains, we identified 227 “live” 3 levelrd\ndomains. Many of them are C&C servers for Winnti-class malware that have hitherto remained\nunidentified.\n\n\nAnalyzing the WHOIS data for the 12 2nd level domains, we found the following list of email addresses\nused for registration:\n```\nevilsex@gmail.com\njslee.jcr@gmail.com\nwhoismydns@gmail.com\ngoogl3@live.com\nwzcc@cnkker.com\napanku2009@gmail.com\n\n```\nFor some of these domains, registration data proved to be the same as those for the domain\ngoogle.com:\n```\nRegistrant: Google Inc.\n1600 Amphitheatre Parkwa\nMountain Vie, California 94043\nUnited States\n+1.6503300100\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nJudging by the domain registration data, the Winnti team started their criminal activities at least in 2007.\nTheir early domains were involved in spreading rogue antiviruses (FakeAV). From 2009 onwards,\ndomains began to emerge hosting C&C servers for bots used to infect gaming companies. Apparently,\nthe cybercriminals graduated to relatively large-scale penetrations into the corporate networks of\ngaming companies starting from 2010.\n\n## Known Malware\n\nThe attackers’ favorite tool is the malicious program we called “Winnti”. It has evolved since its first use,\nbut all variants can be divided into two generations: 1.x and 2.x. Our publication describes both variants\nof this tool.\n\n[In our report we publish an analysis of the first generation of Winnti.](https://securelist.com/winnti-1-0-technical-analysis/37002/)\n\nThe second generation (2.x) was used in one of the attacks which we investigated during its active\nstage, helping the victim to interrupt data transfer and isolate infections in the corporate network. This\n[incident and our investigation is described in detail here.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20134508/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf)\n\nIn addition to that, we have observed the use of a popular backdoor known as PlugX, which is believed\nto have Chinese origins. Previously, this had only been used in attacks against Tibetan activists.\n\n## The Commercial Interest\n\nAs has been stated above, APTs can target any commercial company if cybercriminals find a way to\nmake a profit from the attack.\n\nSo which methods do cybercriminals use to generate illicit earnings from attacks on gaming\ncompanies?\n\nBased on the available information, we have singled out three main monetization schemes that could\nbe used by the Winnti team.\n\n**The unfair accumulation of in-game currency/”gold” in online games and the conversion of**\n**virtual funds into real money.**\n**Theft of source code from the online games server to search for vulnerabilities in games –**\n**often linked to point 1.**\n**Theft of source code from the server part of popular online games to further deploy pirate**\n**servers.**\n\nLet’s look at an example. During our investigation of an infection at a computer game company, we\nfound that malware had been created for a particular service on the company’s server. The malicious\nprogram was looking for a specific process running on the server, injected code into it, and then sought\nout two places in the process code where it could conceal call commands for its function interceptors.\nUsing these function interceptors, the malicious programs modified process data which was processed\nin those two places, and returned control back. Thus, the attackers change the normal execution of the\nserver processes. Unfortunately, the company was not able to share its targeted application with us,\nand we cannot say exactly how this malicious interference affected gaming processes. The company\nconcerned told us that the attackers’ aim was to acquire gaming “gold” illegally.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious activity like this has an adverse impact on the game itself, tilting the balance in favor of\ncheats. But any changes the Winnti team introduces into the game experience are unlikely to be very\nnoticeable. After all, maintaining a skillful balance is the main attribute of online games! Users will\nsimply stop playing if they feel that other players are using non-standard methods to create an\nadvantage beyond normal gameplay or if the game loses its intrinsic competitiveness due to resources\nor artifacts appearing in the game without the developers’ knowledge. At the same time the attackers\nare keen for the game to remain popular; otherwise, they would be unable to effectively turn all the time\nand effort of infecting a gaming company into financial gain.\n\nMembers of the Winnti team are patient and cautious. Cybercriminals have affected the processes of\nthe online games from the infected companies and stolen money from them for years, but they have\nfound ways of doing this without attracting attention to themselves.\n\n## Source of Attacks\n\nSo, who is behind Winnti? While analyzing the malicious files that we detected during our investigation\nwe found some details which may cast some light on the source of the attacks.\n\n[As part of our investigation, we monitored exactly what the cybercriminals did on an infected PC. In](https://securelist.com/the-winnti-honeypot-luring-intruders/35623/)\nparticular, they they [downloaded an auxiliary program ff._exe to the Config.Msi folder on the infected](https://securelist.com/the-winnti-honeypot-luring-intruders/35623/)\nmachine. This code searches for HTML, MS Excel, MS Word, Adobe, PowerPoint and MS Works\ndocuments and text files (.txt) on the hard drive.\n\nDebugging lines were found in ff._exe_ that possibly point to the nationality of the cybercriminals. They\nwere not immediately noticeable because they looked like this in the editor:\n\nHowever, during a detailed analysis it emerged that the text is in Chinese Simplified GBK coding. This\nis what these lines look in Chinese:\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is a machine translation of this text into English:\n```\nNot identify the type of file system\nBelow is a translation of the text by interpreter\nOpen the volume failed\nFailed to get the file system type\nFailed to read volume\nVolumes do not open or open failed\nNavigate to the root directory of the error\nError memory read pointer\nMemory is too small\nFile does not exist\nFailed to get the file mft index sector\nAccess to file data fail\nVolume and open volumes are not the same\nThe same volume and open volume\n\n```\nIn addition, cybercriminals used the AheadLib program to create malicious libraries (for details, see the\nsecond part of the article). This is a program with a Chinese interface.\n\nChinese text was also found in one of the components of the malicious program CmdPlus.dll plug-in:\n\n**Translation: The process is complete!!**\n\nIt would appear that the attackers can at least speak Chinese. However, not everything is so clear cut:\nbecause the file transfer plug-in has not been implemented entirely safely, a command which includes\nthe attackers’ local path (where the file comes from and where it is saved to) arrives during the process\nof downloading/uploading files on the infected system. While monitoring the cybercriminals’ activity on\n[the infected machine, we noticed they uploaded the certificate they found in the infected system, and](https://securelist.com/the-winnti-honeypot-luring-intruders/35623/#certificate)\nthe network traffic reflected the local path indicating the place where they saved the file on their\ncomputer:\n\n\n-----\n\nThese characters appear to be Korean, meaning desktop . This means the attackers were working on\na Korean Windows operating system. Therefore, we can presume that the attack is not the exclusive\nwork of Chinese-speaking cybercriminals.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOur research revealed long-term oriented large scale cyberespionage campaign of a criminal group\nwith Chinese origins. These attacks are not new, many other security researchers have published\ndetails of various cybercriminal groups coming from China. However, current hacking group has\ndistinguishable features that make it stand out among others:\n\nmassive abuse of digital signatures; the attackers used digital signatures of one victim company\nto attack other companies and steal more digital certificates;\nusage of kernel level 64-bit signed rootkit;\nabusing great variety of public Internet resources to store control commands for the malware in an\nencrypted form;\nsharing/selling stolen certificates to other groups that had different objectives (attacks against\nUyghur and Tibetan activists);\nstealing source codes and other intellectual property of software developers in online gaming\nindustry.\n\nThe malicious program which we call “Winnti” has evolved significantly since it first emerged; however\nwe classify all its variants in two main generations: 1.x and 2.x.\n\n[We have published the technical description of the first generation of Winnti in a separate article .](https://securelist.com/winnti-1-0-technical-analysis/37002/)\n\nThe second generation (2.x) was used to conduct an attack which we investigated during its active\nstage. We successfully prevented data transfer to the cybercriminals’ server and isolated the infected\nsystems in the company’s local network. The incidents, as well as results of our investigation, are\n[described in the full report on the Winnti group (PDF).](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20134508/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf)\n\nIn addition, we discovered that the Winnti group uses a popular backdoor known as PlugX which also\nhas Chinese origins. This backdoor had previously been seen almost exclusively in attacks targeting\nTibetan activists.\n\n[Read further](https://securelist.com/winnti-1-0-technical-analysis/37002/)\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Certificate authorities](https://securelist.com/tag/certificate-authorities/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Online Games](https://securelist.com/tag/online-games/)\n[Rootkits](https://securelist.com/tag/rootkits/)\n[Spear phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/spear-phishing/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Winnti](https://securelist.com/tag/winnti/)\n\nAuthors\n\n\n-----\n\nGReAT\n\nWinnti.
