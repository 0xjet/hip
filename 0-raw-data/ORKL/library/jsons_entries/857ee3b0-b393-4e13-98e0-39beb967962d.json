CHIRP does not modify any system\ndata.\n\n## 🏁 Getting Started\n\n[We build and release CHIRP via Releases. However, if you wish to run with Python3.6+,](https://github.com/cisagov/chirp/releases)\nfollow these instructions.\n\n[You can also write new indicators or](https://github.com/cisagov/CHIRP/blob/main/indicators/README.md) [plugins for CHIRP.](https://github.com/cisagov/CHIRP/blob/main/chirp/plugins/README.md)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nPython 3.6 or greater is required to run CHIRP with Python. If you need help installing\n[Python in your environment, follow the instructions here](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html)\n\nCHIRP must be run on a live machine, but it does not have to be network connected.\n\n### Installing\n```\npython3 -m pip install -e .\n\n```\nIn our experience, yara-python comes with some other dependencies. You MAY have\nto install Visual Studio C++ 14.0 and the Windows 10 SDK, this can be retrieved with\n[Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)\n\n## 🎈 Usage\n\n### From release\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n# defaults\n.\\chirp.exe -a AA21-008A\n# with args\n.\\chirp.exe -a AA21-062A -p registry yara -t c:\\\\target_dir\\\\** -o chirp_result -non-interactive -vv\n\n### From python\n# defaults\npython3 chirp.py -a AA21-008A\n# with args\npython3 chirp.py -a AA21-062A -p registry yara -t c:\\\\target_dir\\\\** -o chirp_result\n--non-interactive -vv\n\n Example output\n[15:32:19] [YARA] Enumerating the entire filesystem due to ['CISA Solar Fire', 'CISA\nTeardrop', 'CrowdStrike Rempack', 'CrowdStrike Sunspot', 'FireEye    common.py:103\n      Cosmic Gale', 'FireEye Sunburst']... this is going to take a while.\n      [YARA] Entered yara plugin.                        \ncommon.py:103\n      [REGISTRY] Found 0 hit(s) for IFEO Persistence indicator.         \ncommon.py:103\n      [REGISTRY] Found 0 hit(s) for Teardrop - Registry Activity indicator.   \ncommon.py:103\n      [REGISTRY] Found 0 hit(s) for Sibot - Registry indicator.\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      [+] Done! Your results can be found at Z:\\README\\output.\n\n Non-interactive Mode\n\n```\nNon-interactive mode may be used by issuing the \"--non-interactive\" flag at runtime. Using\nthis flag enables process completion without input. In addition, a non-zero status of 1 will be\nemitted at runtime completion if IoC's were discovered.\n\n## ⛏ Built Using\n\n[Python - Language](https://www.python.org/)\n[Nuitka - For compilation](https://nuitka.net/)\n[evtx2json - For event log access](https://github.com/vavarachen/evtx2json)\n[yara-python - Parses and runs yara rules](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara-python)\n[rich - Makes the CLI easier on the eyes](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich)\n[psutil - Provides an easy API for many OS functions](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil)\n[aiomp - Asynchronous multiprocessing](https://pypi.org/project/aiomultiprocess/)\n[pyyaml - Allows YAML interpretation](https://pyyaml.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## ✍ Authors\n\n 🎉 Acknowledgements\n\nDenise Keating\nLiana Parakesyan\nRichard Kenny\nMegan Nadeau\nEwa Dadok\nDavid Zito\nChris Brown\n[Julian Blanco, LTJG USCG](https://github.com/julianblanco)\n[Caleb Stewart, LT USCG](https://github.com/calebstewart)\nJames Haughom\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\n[We welcome contributions!
