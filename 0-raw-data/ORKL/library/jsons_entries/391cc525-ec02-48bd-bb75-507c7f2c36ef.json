The function that initializes the modules\n\n**_With additional insights from Philippe Z Lin_**\n\n\nMarch 17, 2022\n\n\n_Note: This article has been updated on March 17, 2022, 2:00 a.m. ET to include Asus’_\n_security bulletin._\n\n[Cyclops Blink, an advanced modular botnet that is reportedly linked to the Sandworm or](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/faq-blackenergy)\nVoodoo Bear advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has recently been used to target\n[WatchGuard Firebox devices according to an analysis performed by the UK’s National](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-news/blog/important-detection-and-remediation-actions-cyclops-blink-state-sponsored-botnet)\nCyber Security Centre (NCSC). We acquired a variant of the Cyclops Blink malware family\nthat targets Asus routers. This report discusses the technical capabilities of this Cyclops\nBlink malware variant and includes a list of more than 150 current and historical\ncommand-and-control (C&C) servers of the Cyclops Blink botnet. This list aims to aid\ncybersecurity defenders in searching for affected devices in their networks and starting\nthe remediation process. We have reached out to Asus regarding our investigation, and\n[they have created a security bulletin that includes a security checklist to help prevent](https://www.asus.com/content/ASUS-Product-Security-Advisory/)\nCyclops Blink attacks, as well as a list of affected Asus products.\n\nOur data also shows that although Cyclops Blink is a state-sponsored botnet, its C&C\nservers and bots affect WatchGuard Firebox and Asus devices that do not belong to\ncritical organizations, or those that have an evident value on economic, political, or\nmilitary espionage. Hence, we believe that it is possible that the Cyclops Blink botnet’s\nmain purpose is to build an infrastructure for further attacks on high-value targets.\nCyclops Blink has been around since at least June 2019, and a considerable number of its\nC&C servers and bots are active for up to about three years.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Sandworm APT group has been attributed as creating both Cyclops Blink and the\n[VPNFilter internet of things (IoT) botnet. VPNFilter, first discovered in 2018, targeted](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html)\nrouter and storage devices. It was also reported to have infected hundreds of thousands of\n[devices. In 2021, Trend Micro published a technical analysis of VPNFilter, which includes](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/a/vpnfilter-two-years-later-routers-still-compromised-.html)\na discussion of how the botnet continues to affect infected systems two years after its\ndiscovery. Sandworm was also responsible for many high-profile attacks, including the\n[2015 and 2016 attacks on the Ukrainian electrical grid, the 2017 NotPetya attack, the 2017](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/f/large-scale-ransomware-attack-progress-hits-europe-hard.html)\n[French presidential campaign, the 2018 Olympic Destroyer attack on the Winter Olympic](https://www.politico.eu/article/us-russia-macron-campaign-hack-2017-election-france-attribution-gru/)\nGames, and a 2018 operation against the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\nWeapons (OPCW).\n\nCyclops Blink malware analysis\n\nCyclops Blink is a modular malware written in the C language. In its core component, the\nfirst thing that the malware does is to check if its executable file name starts with \"[k\". If it\ndoes not, it performs the following routine:\n\n1. It redirects both stdout and stderr file descriptors to /dev/null.\n2. It sets the default handlers for SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGBUS, SIGPIPE, and SIGIO\n\nsignals.\n3. It reloads itself with a new \"[ktest]\" process name.\n\nIt then waits for 37 seconds before it sets up its hard-coded parameters. These include the\nhard-coded C&C servers and the interval that should be used to communicate with the\nC&C servers.\n\nIt also creates a pipe for inter-process communication (IPC) by calling the pipe() function\nfor getting two file descriptors for reading and writing data. It also enables non-blocking\nI/O for the writing file descriptor by using ioctl().\n\nAfter this, a new data packet will be created in memory, which will then be sent to a C&C\nserver. The details of this communication are covered later in this analysis.\n\nFor every hard-coded TCP port used to communicate with the C&C servers, the malware\ncreates a rule in Netfilter — the Linux kernel firewall — using the iptc_insert_entry()\n[function from libiptc1 to allow output communication to it. The rules have the following](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Querying-libiptc-HOWTO/index.html)\nparameters:\n\nProtocol: TCP\n\nChain: filter\n\nTable: OUTPUT\n\nAction: ACCEPT\n\nDestination ports: 636, 994, and 995\n\n\n-----\n\nFor an unknown reason, the malware deletes the aforementioned rules and creates them\nagain, this time using the iptables command via the system() function. The commands are\nas follows:\n\niptables -D OUTPUT -p tcp --dport %d -j ACCEPT\n\niptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport %d -j ACCEPT\n\nThe OpenSSL library is then initialized, and the core component proceeds to initialize the\nhard-coded modules.\n\n**Modules initialization**\n\nDuring this part, the core component initializes the modules. Communication with the\nmodules is performed via pipes. For each hard-coded module, the malware creates two\npipes before executing them in their own child processes.\n\nIn Figure 1, we inferred the following mod_t structure:\n\n**Parameters**\n\nThe parameters are then initialized. They consist of a\n592-byte structure containing essential information sent\nto the modules via pipes. This information includes:\n\nA “<p: ” string header\nThe pipe of the core component\nAll C&C IP addresses and ports\nThe local IP address\nAn interval for C&C server communication\nWhen the next packet to be sent to a C&C server is\n\nFigure 2. Inferred mod_t\n\nThe main process PID\n\nstructure; the last member is\n\nA hard-coded ID (we saw 0xA08F078B,\n\nunknown.\n\n0xBD0A5B36, and 0xA244E5E2)\nThe parameters are pushed to the modules, which are initialized at this point.\n\n\nC&C communication\n\nAfter obtaining data from the modules, the core component starts the encryption routines\nthat will cipher the data before sending it to the C&C server.\n\n**Encryption**\n\nCyclops Blink encrypts data using OpenSSL functions that should be available in the\ninfected device as they are dynamically loaded.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data is encrypted using AES-256 in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode with a\nrandomly generated 256-bit key and 128-bit initialization vector (IV). It is then encrypted\nusing a hard-coded RSA-2560 (320-bit) public key unique to each sample.\n\nThe malware authors decided to use the EVP_SealInit() function. This function performs\nall of the aforementioned encryption steps, including the random AES key and IV\ngeneration.\n\nThe C&C server must have the corresponding RSA private key to decrypt the data.\n\nAfter encryption, if the total packet length is greater than 98,303 bytes, the packet is sent.\n\n**Data transferring**\n\nTo send data to the C&C server, the core component performs a TLS handshake with a\nrandomly chosen C&C server at a random TCP port, both of which are from a hard-coded\nlist.\n\nAfter choosing an IP address and a TCP port pair, the core component creates a child\nprocess to perform the communication. The child process will connect to the C&C server\nand write four bytes to the SSL socket. These four bytes are the packet size that it wants to\nsend.\n\nFigure 3. The child process writes four bytes to the SSL socket.\n\nThe server must reply with an exact four-byte answer, which is the victim's IPv4 address.\n\n10 bytes are then written to the core component pipe. The data follows a specific format.\nFor example:\n\nPacket length Target module Command Data (victim's IPv4 address)\n\n00 00 00 0a 00 07 c0 a8 00 01\n\nThe core component then receives more data from the C&C server. This time, it expects\nan encrypted packet to be decrypted using the hard-coded RSA-2560 public key.\n\nThe malware expects a response where the first four bytes are the size of the packet\nfollowed by the encrypted data.\n\n|Packet length|Target module|Command|Data (victim's IPv4 address)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|00 00 00 0a|00|07|c0 a8 00 01|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Core component code that receives and decrypts data from the C&C server\n\nIf something is received, it is decrypted and written to the main pipe. For decryption, the\nmalware uses the RSA_public_decrypt() function, which decrypts data encrypted with a\ncorresponding private key, leveraging the “reversibility” of the RSA encryption algorithm.\n\nFinally, a variable containg the next time a packet should be sent is updated and all of the\nparameters are sent to the modules again. This is because the core component can receive\nnew parameters from the C&C servers.\n\n**Commands**\n\nThe data received from the C&C servers comprises either commands to the core\ncomponent itself or to one of its modules.\n\nFirst, the core component sends the supported commands to the C&C server and then\nenters in a loop where it expects one of the commands.\n\nIf a command targets the core component, it can be one of the following:\n\n|Command ID|Action|\n|---|---|\n|0|Terminates the program|\n|1|Bypasses the data-sending interval and sends data to C&C servers immediately|\n|2|Adds a new C&C server to the list in memory|\n\n\n-----\n\n|3|Sets time to send the next packet to the C&C server|\n|---|---|\n|4|Sets time to send the next packet to the C&C server|\n|5|Adds a new module (an ELF file should be received following the command)|\n|6|Reloads the malware|\n|7|Sets the local IP address parameter|\n|8|Sets a new worker ID|\n|9|Sets an unknown byte value|\n|10|Resends configuration to all running modules|\n\n\n**Modules**\n\n**Asus (0x38)**\n\nThis module can read and write from the devices' flash memory. The flash memory is\nused by these devices to store the operating system, configuration, and all files from the\nfile system. Our research was carried out on the RT-AC68U, but other Asus routers such\nas RT-AC56U might be affected as well. It’s important to note, however, that since the\nmalware is modular in nature, it can be easily recompiled to target any other device. The\nsamples we’ve obtained work in the conditions mentioned in this report, but the malware\nactors seem ready to target any other router model or brand. In fact, this is what they\nhave done with WatchGuard — it’s the same code, but it has been recompiled for the\nbrand.\n\nFirst, the module examines the content /proc/mtd file, which provides general\ninformation about the devices’ Memory Technology Device (MTD) subsystem. The MTD\nprovides an abstraction layer to access the device's flash memory.\n\nThe malware looks for the strings “linux” and “rootfs” and reads it using a printf()-like\nformat:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. The module looks for “linux” and “rootfs” strings\n\nThe inferred mdt_data_t structure is as follows:\n\nThe data is read to this structure. The content of /proc/mtd\nfor an Asus RT-AC68U device is as follows:\n\nFigure 6. The mtd_data_t\n\nstructure\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Typical /proc/mtd from an Asus RT-AC68U router\n\nTherefore, for the case here, the malware would open /dev/mtd2, which is the partition\nwhere the Linux kernel image is stored. Why the malware authors decided to read either\n“linux” or “rootfs” partition is unclear. Based on our knowledge, they have quite different\npurposes. While the first holds the operating system, the second stores programs’ critical\nfiles, such as executables, data, and libraries.\n\nCyclops Blink reads 80 bytes from the flash memory, writes it to the main pipe, and\nenters a loop to wait for a command to replace the partition content:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Asus module main loop\n\nIf the data coming from the core component starts with “<p:”, it means that it is a\nparameter for this module and 80 bytes will be written to the flash memory, effectively\nreplacing its content.\n\nThe writing is done by the j_save_data() function. It does this by correctly erasing the\nNAND eraseblocks first via ioctl() calls, and then writing the new content to them, as the\nfollowing image shows:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Cyclops Blink Asus module code for writing to raw flash memory\n\nAs the flash memory content is permanent, this module can be used to establish\npersistence and survive factory resets.\n\nAlthough it cannot be used as proof of attribution, the preceding code reminded us of a\nroutine from the third-stage code of VPNFilter’s process called “dstr” that was intended to\n“brick” the infected device. Apart from deleting many important files and even trying to\ndelete the whole root file system, this particular VPNFilter stage also writes many 0xff\nbytes to the raw flash memory:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. VPNFilter “dstr” third-stage code for writing to raw flash memory\n\n**System reconnaissance (0x08)**\n\nThis module is responsible for sending information from the infected device to the C&C\nserver. The following data is obtained from an infected device:\n\nThe Linux version, which the module gets by calling the uname() function and\n/etc/issue file\nInformation about the device’s memory consumption, which it gets by calling the\nsysinfo() function\nThe SSD storage information, which it gets by calling the statvfs() function\n\nThe content of the following files:\n\n/etc/passwd\n/etc/group\n\n/proc/mounts\n/proc/partitions\nInformation about the network interfaces, which it gets by calling the\nif_nameindex() and iotctl() functions with the SIOCGIFHWADDR and\nSIOCGIFADDR commands.\n\n**File download (0x0f)**\n\nThis module can download files from the internet. The DNS resolution is performed using\nDNS over HTTPS (DoH). The malware sends an HTTP POST request to a Google DNS\nServer (8.8.8.8) using the following headers:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. HTTP POST request over SSL for DNS resolution\n\nThis module seems to be an earlier version of the same module (0x0f) that is used by the\nCyclops Blink variant reported by NCSC. The main differences between the modules are\nas follows:\n\nThis module does not have an upload feature.\nThe 0x1 bit in the control flags is used in this module to specify if the download\nshould be done via HTTPS.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWe have been able to determine that the botnet of Cyclops Blink infected routers from\nboth compromised WatchGuard devices and Asus routers. These compromised devices\nperiodically connect to C&C servers that are themselves hosted on compromised\nWatchGuard devices. We have evidence that the routers of at least one vendor other than\nAsus and WatchGuard are connecting to Cyclops Blink C&Cs as well, but so far we have\nbeen unable to collect malware samples for this router brand.\n\nThe botnet of Cyclops Blink has been around for some time. Using historical data of\ninternet-wide scans and SSL certificate data, it is likely that Cyclops Blink dates back to at\nleast June 2019. Since June 2019, the actor has issued more than 50 SSL certificates that\nwere used on WatchGuard C&Cs on various TCP ports (as far as we are aware, the\nfollowing TCP ports were used: 636, 989, 990, 994, 995, 3269, and 8443).\n\nIn Appendix A, we have listed both the live and inactive C&Cs used by Cyclops Blink for\nthe benefit of network defenders. We have observed that some of the WatchGuard and\nAsus bots were never cleaned up because these routers still try to connect periodically to\nold C&Cs that were secured or taken offline.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. The timeline of several SSL certificates that were issued for Cyclops Blink C&Cs\n\nOur investigation shows that there are more than 200 Cyclops Blink victims around the\nworld. Typical countries of infected WatchGuard devices and Asus routers are the United\nStates, India, Italy, Canada, and a long list of other countries, including Russia. It should\nbe noted that these victims do not appear to be evidently valuable targets for either\neconomic, military, or political espionage. For example, some of the live C&Cs are hosted\non WatchGuard devices used by a law firm in Europe, a medium-sized company\nproducing medical equipment for dentists in Southern Europe and a plumber in the\nUnited States. This is in line with the increasing number of brute-force attacks performed\n[by other APT groups such as Pawn Storm, a group that has compromised numerous](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-pawn-storm-in-2019.pdf)\nassets like email addresses and email servers of targets that are typically not aligned with\nPawn Storm’s objectives. Just like Pawn Storm, Sandworm is fishing with a wide net or\nlooking to compromise assets on a larger scale.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. The number of months that Cyclops Blink C&Cs have been live; it is important to note that\n\nlive C&Cs during the time of reporting have been included.\n\nConclusion and security recommendations\n\nOver the past few years, IoT attacks have been escalating globally and internet routers\nhave been one of the primary targets. There are several reasons that these devices are\nfavored by an attacker — the infrequency of patching, the lack of security software, and\nthe limited visibility of defenders. Combined, these allow for the possibility of what we\nrefer to as \"eternal botnets.\" Once an IoT device is infected with malware, an attacker can\nhave unrestricted internet access for downloading and deploying more stages of malware\nfor reconnaissance, espionage, proxying, or anything else that the attacker wants to do.\nThe underlying operating systems for the majority of IoT devices is Linux, which is also\nused by many powerful systems tools. This can allow attackers to add anything else that\nthey might need to complete their attacks. In the case of Cyclops Blink, we have seen\ndevices that were compromised for over 30 months (about two and a half years) in a row\nand were being set up as stable C&C servers for other bots.\n\nThe NCSC report covered malware targeting a specific vendor, namely WatchGuard.\nBased on our previous analysis of VPNFilter, we assumed that there were more vendors\n[being attacked by this group. The vendors that were targeted by VPNFilter were Asus, D-](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/vpnfilter-malware-infecting-50000-devices-is-worse-than-we-thought/)\nLink, Huawei, Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, QNAP, TP-Link, Ubiquiti, UPVEL, and ZDE.\nIn the case of Cyclops Blink, we received samples targeting Asus routers that were not\npreviously reported on. The Asus version of the Cyclops Blink malware that we have\n\n\n-----\n\nanalyzed showed some differences compared to the WatchGuard versions that have been\npreviously discussed. The samples that we have analyzed are compiled for ARM and are\n[dynamically linked against uClibc. They also contain a module that specifically targets](https://www.uclibc.org/)\nAsus routers. Asus is likely only one of the vendors that is currently being targeted by\nCyclops Blink. We have evidence that other routers are affected too, but as of reporting,\nwe were not able to collect Cyclops Blink malware samples for routers other than\nWatchGuard and Asus. Looking into the malware and the infrastructure being used by\nCyclops Blinks actors gives us some clues about the other vendors that might be affected\nand how widespread this malware is. By sharing this additional technical observation, we\naim to help network defenders, as well as those likely to be targeted by APT groups (such\nas Sandworm), gain a more complete picture of the Cyclops Blink campaign.\n\nBased on our observation, we strongly believe that there are more targeted devices from\nother vendors. This malware is modular in nature and it is likely that each vendor has\ndifferent modules and architectures that were thought out well by the Cyclops Blink\nactors. Moreover, the purpose of this botnet is still unclear: Whether it is intended to be\nused for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, espionage, or proxy networks\nremains to be seen. But what is evident is that Cyclops Blink is an advanced piece of\nmalware that focuses on persistence and the ability to survive domain sinkhole attempts\nand the takedown of its infrastructure. The APT group behind this malware has learned\nfrom its VPNFilter campaigns and continues to attack IoT devices such as routers.\n\n[In the age of work-from-home (WFH) during the pandemic, it’s possible that espionage is](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/working-from-home-here-s-what-you-need-for-a-secure-setup)\n[part of the reason that IoT devices are still major targets for advanced attackers. The](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/predictions/2022)\nmore routers are compromised, the more sources of powerful data collection — and\navenues for further attacks — become available to attackers. Having a distributed\ninfrastructure also makes it more difficult for cybersecurity teams to take down the whole\nattack. This is also why, after more than two years, there are still live VPNFilter hosts out\nthere.\n\nOrganizations can protect themselves from Cyclops Blink attacks by using strong\n[passwords and re-examining their security measures. It is also important to ensure that](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ie/research/21/a/vpnfilter-two-years-later-routers-still-compromised-.html)\nonly the services that absolutely need to be exposed to the internet are exposed. Access to\nthese services should be limited, which can be achieved by configuring a virtual private\nnetwork (VPN) that can access those services remotely. It’s also important to set\nreminders to check if devices such as routers, cameras, network-attached storage (NAS)\ndevices, and other IoT devices have been patched or otherwise.\n\nIf it is suspected that an organization’s devices have been infected with Cyclops Blink, it is\nbest to get a new router. Performing a factory reset might blank out an organization’s\nconfiguration, but not the underlying operating system that the attackers have modified.\nIf a particular vendor has firmware updates that can address a Cyclops Blink attack or any\nother weakness in the system, organizations should apply these as soon as possible.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, in some cases, a device might be an end-of-life product and will no longer\nreceive updates from its vendor. In such cases, an average user would not have the ability\nto fix a Cyclops Blink infection.\n\nWhile the Cyclops Blink malware variant that we analyzed in this report is complicated in\nnature, one thing proves to be unmistakable when it comes to the Sandworm group that\ncreated it: Sandworm is a persistent and sophisticated group whose motives are clearly at\nodds with those that would be expected from groups that are primarily financially\nmotivated. Sandworm’s previous high-profile victims and their attacks’ substantial impact\non these organizations are particularly worrying — even more so for a group that quickly\nlearns from past errors, comes back stronger time and time again, and for whom\ninternational repercussions seem minimal at best.\n\n[The indicators of compromise (IOCs) can be found in this appendix and the C&C server](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/22/c/cyclops-blink-sets-sights-on-asus-routers/Appendix_Cyclops%20Blink%20Sets%20Sights%20on%20ASUS%20Routers.pdf)\n[validation script can be accessed via this text file.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/Validation-script_Cyclops-Blink-Sets-Sights-on-Asus-Routers-n2HqxTq.txt)\n\n\n-----",
