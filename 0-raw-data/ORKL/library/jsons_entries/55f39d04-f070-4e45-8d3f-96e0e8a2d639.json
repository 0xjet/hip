    "plain_text": "# Operation Night Fury: Group-IB helps take down a cybergang behind the infection of hundreds of websites all over the world\n\n**group-ib.com/media/night-fury/**\n\nOperators of the JavaScript-sniffer family, dubbed «GetBilling» by Group-IB, were arrested\nin Indonesia. The arrest came as a result of a joint operation «Night Fury» initiated\nby INTERPOL’s ASEAN Cyber Capability Desk (ASEAN Desk) that involved Indonesian\nCyber Police (BARESKRIM POLRI (Dittipidsiber)) and Group-IB’s APAC Cyber\nInvestigations Team. The operation is still ongoing in other five ASEAN countries with which\nthe intelligence was also shared. This case marks the first successful multi-jurisdictional\noperation against the operators of JavaScript-sniffers in the region. According to Group-IB’s\ndata, the suspects have managed to infect hundreds of ecommerce websites in various\nlocations, including in Indonesia, Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany,\nBrazil, and some other countries. Payment and personal data of thousands of online\nshoppers from Asia, Europe, and the Americas have been stolen.\n\nThe three suspects with the initials «ANF» (27 y.o.), «K» (35 y.o.), and «N» (23 y.o.) were\narrested in December 2019 in two different regions in Indonesia — Special Region\nof Yogyakarta and Special Capital Region of Jakarta — as part of the joint operation «Night\nFury» carried out by Indonesian Cyber Police and INTERPOL with the help of Group-IB’s\nCyber Investigations team. During the special operation, Indonesian Cyber Police seized\nlaptops, mobile phones of various brands, CPU units, IDs, BCA Token, ATM cards. The\n\n\n-----\n\nsuspected operators of the GetBilling JavaScript-sniffer family are charged with the theft\nof electronic data, which carries up to a 10-year jail sentence in accordance with Indonesian\ncriminal code.\n\nStrong and effective partnerships between police and the cybersecurity industry are essential\nto ensure law enforcement worldwide has access to the information they need to address the\nscale and complexity of today’s cyberthreat landscape. This successful operation is just one\nexample of how law enforcement are working with industry partners, adapting and applying\nnew technologies to aid investigations and ultimately reduce the global impact\nof cybercrime,» concluded Mr Jones.\n\n**Craig Jones**\n\nINTERPOL’s Director of Cybercrime\n\nThere are many challenges and obstacles in cross-border hi-tech crime investigations like\nthis. The Night Fury Operation showed that these obstacles could only be overcome with\nclose collaboration between national law enforcement, international organizations and\nprivate companies. Effective multi-jurisdictional coordination of efforts between Indonesia’s\nCyber Police, INTERPOL and Group-IB allowed to attribute the crimes, establish the\nperpetrators behind the JS-sniffer and arrest them. But more importantly to protect the\ncommunity and raise public awareness about the problem of cybercrime and its impact.\n\n**Idam Wasiadi**\n\nPolice Superintendent, Cybercrime Investigator at Directorate of Cybercrime of CID\nof Indonesian National Police\n\n\n-----\n\nWith cybercrime being a growing threat across the region, the ASEAN Desk was launched\nby INTERPOL to assist law enforcement agencies enhance their proactive response against\ncybercrime. Through this operation, it is clear that timely intelligence sharing and coordinated\nactions are the ways forward to effectively combat cybercrime regionally and globally.\n\n**James Tan**\n\nINTERPOL Acting Assistant Diector (Strategy & Capabilities Development)\n\nJavaScript-sniffers (JS-sniffers) targeting ecommerce websites is a type of malicious\nJavaScript code, designed to steal customer payment and personal data such as credit card\nnumbers, names, addresses, logins, phone numbers, and credentials from payment\nsystems, and etc. Group-IB has been tracking the GetBilling JS-sniffer family since 2018.\nThe analysis of infrastructure that was controlled by the suspected operators of GetBilling\narrested in Indonesia, carried out by Group-IB’s Cyber Investigations team, revealed that\nthey have managed to infect nearly 200 websites in Indonesia, Australia, Europe, the United\nStates, South America, and some other countries. However, the investigation in other\nASEAN countries continues, and the number of websites infected with GetBilling family\nis likely to be higher. According to the investigation, stolen payment data was used by the\nsuspects to buy goods, such as electronic devices or other luxury items, which they tried\nto resell online in Indonesia at below the market price.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 1 Example of GetBilling’s malicious script\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 2 Example of stolen payment and personal data stored on GetBilling’s servers\n\nGroup-IB Cyber Investigations team determined that some of the GetBilling’s infrastructure\nwas located in Indonesia. Upon discovery of this information, INTERPOL’s ASEAN Desk\npromptly notified Indonesian cyber police. Further investigation discovered that the\nGetBilling’s operators were not new to the world of cybercrime. To access their servers for\nstolen data collection and their JS-sniffers’ control, they always used VPN to hide their real\nlocation and identity. To pay for hosting services and buy new domains the gang members\nonly used stolen cards. Despite that, Indonesian cyber police in cooperation with INTEPROL\nand Group-IB’s Cyber Investigations team managed to establish that the group was\noperating from Indonesia.\n\nThis case showed the borderless nature of cybercrime — the operators of the JS-sniffer lived\nin one country attacking ecommerce websites all around the world. It makes evidence\ncollection, identification of suspects, and prosecution more complicated. Another thing that\nthe case demonstrated vividly is that international cooperation and cyber intelligence data\nexchange can help effectively tackle modern cyber threats. Thanks to Indonesian Cyber\nPolice and INTERPOL’s prompt actions, Night Fury became the first successful multijurisdictional operation against the operators of JavaScript-sniffers in the APAC region.\nIt is a great example of coordinated cross-border anti-cybercrime effort, and we are proud\nthat our threat intelligence and digital forensics expertise helped to establish the suspects.\nWe hope this will set a precedent for law enforcement in other jurisdiction too.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Vesta Matveeva**\n\nHead of Group-IB’s APAC Cyber Investigations Team\n\nBy leveraging its own infrastructure for monitoring of underground forums and cardshops,\nGroup-IB has collected comprehensive information about the carding market and is capable\nof identifying various anomalies. According to Group-IB’s annual 2019 threat report, the\nnumber of compromised cards uploaded to underground forums increased from 27.1 million\nto 43.8 million in H2 2108-H1 2019 year-on-year. The size of the carding market, in turn,\n\n\n-----\n\ngrew by 33 percent and amounted to USD 879.7 million. The sale of CVV data is also on rise\ntoday, having increased by 19 percent in the corresponding period, and one of the key\nreasons behind this trend could be JavaScript-sniffers.\n\n[GetBilling family was first described in Group-IB’s 2019 report «Crime without punishment»](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/threat-research/js-sniffers.html)\nwhich is a deep dive into the world of JS‑sniffers. According to the author of the report Viktor\nOkorokov, threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, at the time of the report’s publication,\nin total Group-IB Threat Intelligence team discovered 38 families of JS-sniffers. Ever since,\nthe number of JS-sniffer families, discovered by the company, has almost doubled and\ncontinues to grow. JS‑sniffers have caused many security incidents in past — the infection\nof the British Airways website and mobile app, payment-card attack on the UK website of the\ninternational company FILA etc. — and continue to gain popularity among cybercriminals.\nMost recently, in December 2019, JS-sniffers hit the APAC infecting the websites\nof Singaporean fashion brand «Love, Bonito.\n\nTo avoid big financial losses due to JS-sniffers, it’s recommended for online users to have\na separate pre-paid card for online payments, set spending limits on cards, used for online\nshopping, or even use a separate bank account exclusively for online purchases. Online\nmerchants, in their turn, need to keep their software updated and carry out regular\ncybersecurity assessments of their websites.\n\n\n-----",
