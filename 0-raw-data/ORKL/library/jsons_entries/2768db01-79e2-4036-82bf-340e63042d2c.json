In this\nbulletin we are sharing intelligence relating to a recent phishing campaign conducted by a group widely\nreferred to as ‘Sofacy’, named after the antivirus[1] detection name for one of the malware families used by\nthe group.\n\nOver the years there have been a number of papers discussing variations to the malware used by the\ngroup, but little discussion of less sophisticated techniques employed by the same attackers.\n\n#### Analysis\n\nSofacy has been discussed before as being used to target APEC members[2] and there has also been some\nprior analysis of the malware itself[3]. Variants of the malware have been in use for a considerable amount\nof time – for example, the screenshot below is from the decoy document loaded by one of the earliest\nversions present on ThreatExpert[4], from February 2010.\n\nSample 5e3bea788e89e0814e898b4a648b93c0b74f7e2c\n\nDecoy documents are used in conjunction with malware droppers in order to make the target believe the\nfile they have just opened is legitimate. The documents often give an indication of the attackers’ intended\ntargets.\n\nMore recently, ESET have reported[5] on related spear phishes using NATO/Ukrainian conflict themes and\nwatering hole attacks likely targeting the defence industry and a Polish finance company. It has been\npublicly speculated before that Sofacy malware is Russian in origin. Indicators found in the malware\nanalysis referenced in the appendix, such as embedded resources and targeting would appear to support\nthis theory.\n\n1\nhttp://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2011-090714-2907-99\n\n2 http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/spoofed-apec-2013-email-mixes-old-threat-tricks/\n3 http://thegoldenmessenger.blogspot.de/2012/12/3-disclosure-of-another-0day-malware.html\n4 http://threatexpert.com/reports.aspx?find=netids.dll\n5 http://welivesecurity.com/2014/10/08/sednit-espionage-group-now-using-custom-exploit-kit/\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Targeting\n\nRecently, we observed a number of new domain registrations by the Sofacy attackers, all of which are\nclosely related via shared WHOIS data and infrastructure. New domain registrations are usually\nindicative of a new campaign, and so we were eager to find new samples of the malware which connected\nto the infrastructure. The domain names chosen were almost identical to the legitimate domains of\nseveral organisations, a common technique and, like carefully chosen decoy documents, often gives clues\nas to the likely targets of the campaign. The new domain names mimicked organisations in the following\ncategories:\n\n   - International and European diplomatic institutions\n\n   - Popular providers of web services\n\n   - Military institutions, contractors and conferences\n\n   - Energy companies\n\n   - News organisations based out of the United States and Central Europe\n\nIn addition to new malware samples, we also found examples where the attackers were using the simple\ntechnique of phishing for credentials. The usage of malware in targeted attacks to steal information of\nvalue to attackers has been widely reported, however the simple technique of phishing for credentials,\nwhilst still relatively common in targeted attacks, is still more typically associated with criminal attackers\ninvolved in day to day cyber-fraud.\n\nThe pages used for phishing typically used obfuscated code to redirect the user to another webpage:\n\nIn some pages the malicious redirect was disabled by the attackers, by placing additional JavaScript on\nthe page which would redirect users to a legitimate site preferentially.\n\nFake login pages were observed both for webmail and two factor-authentication platforms. In the second\ncase this would require the attackers to log in at the same time as affected victims, showing a level of\ndedication to the cause. As well as the domains used being similar to those of the targeted, the pages were\nalso made to appear the same as their legitimate counterparts, making it difficult for end-users to tell they\nwere being duped.\n\nFor example the screenshot below shows the contents of a credential phishing website designed to mimic\nthe legitimate OWA site of a defence contractor. The attacker’s version is on the left, the real version is on\nthe right:\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo of the domains we identified have previously been associated in open source with credential\nphishing, although not attributed to this group of attackers:\n\n  - In October 2013 the domain chmail[.]in was reported [6] as being used in widespread attacks\nagainst users of the Iranian mail service chmail[.]ir\n\n  - In January 2014 the domain google-settings[.]com was reported7 as being used in credential theft\nagainst some gmail users.\n\n#### Recommended Actions\n\nAs ever with phishing attacks, one of the most important preventative steps you can take is to educate\nstaff on how to identify suspicious emails – especially as there are fewer technical measures that can be\ntaken to prevent low distribution phishing attacks which aim to steal credentials than there are for similar\nattacks involving malware.\n\nOrganisations with good logging for their e-mail data could attempt to detect activity relating to\ncompromised accounts by alerting on “impossible journeys”, where locations from which users log in are\nmonitored and where alerts are produced when a single user logs in from two separate countries in a short\nperiod of time.\n\n#### Snort Signatures\n\nWe have developed some SNORT signatures to detect the current template used by the attackers in their\nphishing campaigns. The following signatures detect Javascript that is present on many obfuscated\nredirects, not necessarily related to this activity but which may be indicative of Sofacy phishing:\n\n6\nhttp://www.asriran.com/fa/news/299798/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%84%DA%86%D8%A7%D9%BE%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D9%87%D9%87%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%AA\n\n7\nhttp://www.spamfighter.com/News-18805-Security-Researcher-Intercepted-Phishing-Email-Campaign-which-Aimed-at-GoogleUsers.htm\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nalert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (msg:\"Potential Sofacy Phishing Redirect\";\nflow:established,to_client;
