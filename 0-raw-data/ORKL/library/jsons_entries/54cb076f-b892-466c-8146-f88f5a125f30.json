It started as a SMS stealer and rapidly\nevolved into one of the most advanced actors in the financial fraud landscape. Ginp has\nprimarily targeted Spanish banks, but recent evidence suggests the malware has changed or\nmay change its targeting strategy in the near future to focus on Turkey. The following chart\nshows infection rates for different Android malware families from the last 90 days and\ndemonstrates that Ginp accounts for nearly 12% of infections during this time.\n\nFigure 1: Android banking malware infections from the last 90 days (source: IBM Trusteer)\n\n## Ginp Expands Targeting to Turkey\n\nA few weeks ago, IBM’s Trusteer team found evidence that Ginp malware developers intend\nto broaden their target set to customers of Turkish banks, after targeting Spanish banking\n[customers and customers in Poland and the United Kingdom. Specifically, our team](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ginp-mobile-banking-trojan/32478/)\ndiscovered new Ginp overlay pages intended for overlay attacks on mobile devices residing\non the malware’s command-and-control (C&C) servers (see Figure 2). These overlay pages\nare spoofs of legitimate banking pages, meant to deceive mobile device users into sharing\nconfidential banking and other information. Several of these fake overlays mimic banks in\nTurkey, suggesting that malware operators intend to use these pages in future campaigns to\ntarget customers of Turkish banks. These fake overlays have not previously been noted in\nthe security community.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Some of the overlay pages targeting Turkish banks, found on Ginp’s C&C server\n(source: IBM Trusteer)\n\nGinp’s new targeting strategy echoes other mobile banking malware families, which have\n[also expanded target sets to include Turkish banking customers. Cybercriminals appear to](https://blog.bushidotoken.net/2020/05/turkey-targeted-by-cerberus-and-anubis.html)\n[be finding this geographical region fruitful for cyber operations. Some observers have](https://www.cyberscoop.com/malware-attacks-hit-turkey-disproportionately-high-levels-report-says/)\nattributed this to obsolete systems and widespread poor security management. It also is\npossible that cybercriminals developing these overlays have recently made several options\ntargeting Turkish banks available on the dark web, which have become a popular commodity\nin those forums, including for Ginp operators.\n\nDespite Ginp’s expansion to Turkey, we assess the group will continue to target Spanish\nbanking customers, as well, based on recent overlay screens our team found on the\nmalware’s C&C server aimed at Spanish banks. The malware no longer appears to target\nPoland or the UK, but that targeting strategy may change at any time.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Overlay pages targeting Spanish banks, recently found on Ginp’s C&C server\n(source: IBM Trusteer)\n\n## How Ginp’s Overlay Attack Works in Practice\n\nOur team has studied how Ginp operators deploy the fake overlay pages to victims’ mobile\ndevices. When Ginp starts running, it first obtains information from the victim’s device, such\nas the state of the device and the currently installed applications, and sends it to the server.\nBased on this information, the server will then decide how to proceed—usually discovering\nwhich banking application the victim uses, and then initiating an attack. In most cases, the\nmalware will prompt the victim to click on his or her banking application and then pop a fake\noverlay onto the screen. In some cases, the malware operators will spy on the target before\ndeciding the best avenue of attack to bypass security countermeasures.\n\nGinp’s C&C server can send an array of commands to the malware. These commands can\nbe sent manually by an operator or automatically in response to information obtained by the\nmalware.\n\n## It Starts With Social Engineering\n\nOne of the recent features added to Ginp is the ability to make it appear as if a legitimate\nSMS message is being received on a device. The server sends a command called\n“INSERT_SMS,” which triggers the malware to effectively mimic the process of receiving a\nnew SMS message. The messages reference documents that need to be signed or\nsuspicious activity on a banking account—among other ploys—in an attempt to invoke a\nsense of urgency and persuade the victim to open his or her mobile banking application.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Fake incoming SMS messages generated by Ginp (source: IBM Trusteer)\n\nAn additional technique the malware uses is generating fake push notifications. The server\ncan send a “PUSH_NOTIFY” command to generate a fake “push” notification and make it\nappear as if it’s coming from the banking app.\n\nFigure 5: Fake push notifications generated by Ginp (source: IBM Trusteer)\n\n## Activate the Overlay\n\nIn general, as soon as the victim uses his or her banking app, this activity is logged and sent\nto the C&C server. If the banking app is targeted by Ginp, the server will respond with a\ncommand of “START_INJ” for the malware to start the overlay attack. This command will\ntrigger the malware to open a WebView on top of the screen and fetch the overlay attack\npages. However, Ginp also provides attackers with the flexibility to initiate an overlay attack\nat any time without relying on the user. For example, an attacker can trigger the overlay as\nsoon as the user sees the fake SMS message or push notification.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: The typical process of Ginp’s overlay attack (source: IBM Trusteer)\n\n## Evolving New Features\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Ginp malware continues to evolve rapidly, with developers frequently releasing new\nfeatures. Several of these features are worth mentioning.\n\n**Fake SMS Push Notifications**\n\nThis new feature was added December 2019. It is used for faking an incoming SMS\nmessage or push notification from the victim’s bank. These techniques allow the attacker to\nemploy social engineering before initiating an overlay attack and help decrease suspicion\nfrom a victim.\n\n**Notifications Listener (Blocker) Service**\n\nA few months ago, Ginp developers introduced a new feature that allows the malware to\nblock all push notifications from legitimate applications. This is particularly helpful to\nattackers, as it can block notifications about the fraudulent transaction taking place, thus\navoiding arousing suspicion from the victim. Additionally, the content of the blocked\nnotification is sent to the C&C server, allowing malware operators to steal second-factor\nauthentication codes or collect social media and instant messaging notifications to spy on the\ntarget.\n\n**RAT Capabilities**\n\nSimilar to other banking malware, Ginp operators started implementing Remote Access\n[Trojan (RAT) capabilities around March 2020, which allow them to spy on the victim in real](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/2020_year_of_the_rat.html)\ntime. This feature allows attackers to exfiltrate valuable information that can enable them to\ncircumvent security controls. More carefully, they can tailor an attack on a victim to increase\ntheir chances for success. The RAT also allows malware operators to take control of and\nconduct transactions from the victim’s device, reducing the risk of being detected by security\ncountermeasures.\n\n**Injections Locker**\n\nGinp’s newest feature is the injections locker. This feature was introduced just in the past few\nweeks and is activated by the “START_LOCK” command. It allows attackers to use an\naggressive version of an overlay attack. These overlay pages are similar to the regular ones,\nbut persist on the screen and keep reappearing. This feature blocks the victim from using his\nor her phone, even after entering their credentials, until their device is released by the\nmalware operator. This feature creates advantages for the attacker by persuading a victim to\nenter and reveal credentials to unlock the phone, and preventing a victim from accessing a\nlegitimate banking application, which may have security countermeasures.\n\n[Pavel Asinovsky](https://securityintelligence.com/author/pavel-asinovsky/)\nMalware Researcher\n\n\n-----\n\nPavel is a malware researcher for IBM Security s Trusteer s group.
