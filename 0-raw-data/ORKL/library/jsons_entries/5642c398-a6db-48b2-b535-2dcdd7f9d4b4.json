    "plain_text": "**FLASH REPORT**\n\n# Targeting of Olympic Games IT Infrastructure Remains Unattributed\n\n### By Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, Priscilla Moriuchi, Greg Lesnewich Recorded Future\n\n\n-----\n\n#### FLASH REPORT\n\n Executive Summary\n\nA major telecommunications and IT provider was targeted by an unknown threat actor​ ​as\npart of an operation directed at disrupting the Olympic Games in PyeongChang. Recorded\nFuture identified hardcoded credentials for the IT provider embedded in the Olympic\nDestroyer malware used in this campaign. Small amounts of code overlap connect the\nmalware to numerous, disparate threat groups, which ultimately does not help to identify\nthe threat actor responsible for developing the Olympic Destroyer malware.\n\n##### Key Judgments\n\n  - Olympic Destroyer should be treated with a high level of concern, due to the\ndestructive nature of the malware and its potent mechanisms to spread laterally.\n\n  - Commentary and analysis surrounding malware code similarities of Olympic\nDestroyer have yielded many leads but no conclusive attribution.\n\n  - The co-occurrence of disparate code overlaps in the malware may be indicative of a\nfalse flag operation, attempting to dilute evidence and confuse researchers.\n\n##### Background\n\nA major telecommunications and IT provider was targeted by an unknown threat actor​ ​as\npart of targeting the Olympic Games in PyeongChang prior to December 2017.\n\nThe malware, commonly referred to as Olympic Destroyer, was initially identified by Talos\n[researchers​. Researchers have theorized that Olympic Destroyer was used ​to disrupt​](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/olympic-destroyer.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:+feedburner/Talos+(Talos%E2%84%A2+Blog)&m=1) the\nOlympic Games opening ceremony on February 9. The destructive malware moves laterally\nwithin a network via Psexec and WMI, to infect hosts and render their data useless. Psexec\nand WMI are built-in Windows internal tools; Psexec is used to execute processes on other\nsystems in a shared network, and WMI is used to automate tasks on remote systems. The\nmalware also uses Mimikatz, a password-stealing tool, to extract credentials from a\ncompromised machine, also allowing it to move across the target network. [​Microsoft](https://twitter.com/WDSecurity/status/963308636276584448)\n[researchers stated​ that there is also evidence of use of EternalRomance, a leaked exploit](https://twitter.com/WDSecurity/status/963308636276584448)\nrecently abused by ransomware as a propagation method, but we were unable to verify\nthis claim.\n\n| | |\n\n\n-----\n\n#### FLASH REPORT\n\n##### Threat Analysis: A Two-Pronged Campaign\n\nRecorded Future found an extended set of malware targeting the PyeongChang Games\nusing an additional set of Active Directory credentials. The diversity of credentials and\npresence of a software key suggest that an early reconnaissance phase would likely involve\nan initial malware infection and not just simple credential phishing.\n\nAll samples of the Olympic Destroyer malware variant targeting the IT provider were\ntimestamped five minutes prior to the compilation of the samples identified by Talos\nresearchers as targeting the PyeongChang 2018 network. This suggests a parallel,\ntwo-pronged attempt to target the Olympics event, aimed at both organizers and\ninfrastructure providers.\n\nAdditional unreported malware hashes are contained in the appendix below.\n\nUpon discovery of the hardcoded credentials, Recorded Future adhered to responsible\ndisclosure practices, notified the relevant IT provider, and provided details of the\ncampaign. An independent forensic investigation is underway and no damage is reported\nat this time.\n\n##### Technical Analysis: Attribution Remains Elusive \n\nOne of the most innovative techniques currently employed by advanced research teams is\nhunting for code similarity at scale. Google researchers were the first to notably employ\n[this technique​ ​to cluster previously unattributed​](https://twitter.com/neelmehta/status/864164081116225536) ​campaigns like that of North Korean\nthreat actor Scarcruft​ ​and WannaCry​, ​ultimately tying both to the Lazarus Group​ . ​BAE\n[researchers​ ​discovered​](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html) ​the first overlaps in malware used by BlueNoroff​ ​employed in the\nBangladesh SWIFT heist by noting use of a shared wiping function, once again pointing the\n[finger at North Korea. Kaspersky researchers used this method to​ ​link the trojan targeting](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/910059453948579840)\n[CCleaner​](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/910059453948579840) ​to the Axiom group, and so on.\n\nThe trouble with this technique is that while code similarity can be stated with certainty,\ndown to a percentage of bytes shared, the results are not straightforward and require\nexpert interpretation. The Olympic Destroyer malware is a perfect example of how we can\nbe led astray by this clustering technique when our standard for similarity is too low.\n\n| | |\n\n\n-----\n\n#### FLASH REPORT\n\nOlympic Destroyer remains unclustered and unattributed. Because this technique still\nrequires expert interpretation, casual or incomplete analysis can yield seemingly cohesive\nnarratives, for example, pointing in the direction of North Korea, China, or Russia. This\noccurs when the code is looked at with a low enough correlative threshold.\n\nBelow are some disparate observations derived from the Olympic Destroyer malware\nbased on code similarity analysis:\n\n_[China: ​Intezer researchers were the first to point to ​fragments of code similarity​ with](http://www.intezer.com/2018-winter-cyber-olympics-code-similarities-cyber-attacks-pyeongchang/)_\ndiverse threat actors in the general Chinese cluster, including APT3 (UPS), APT10\n(menuPass), and APT12 (IXESHE).\n\n_North Korea:​ Our own research turned up trivial but consistent code similarities between_\nOlympic Destroyer modules and several malware families used by the Lazarus Group.\nThese include standard but different functions within [​BlueNoroff​ Banswift malware, the](https://securelist.com/lazarus-under-the-hood/77908/)\n[LimaCharlie family of Lazarus malware from the Novetta Blockbuster ​report​, and a module](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/resources/)\nfrom the Lazarus SpaSpe malware meant to target domain controllers.\n\nBefore one concludes that these widely diverse threat actors have formed an axis of evil\nintent on disrupting the Olympics, we need to take a step back and look at our research\ntechniques.\n\nCode similarity historically yielded significant research findings in clustering new campaigns\nto known threat actors and continues to hold great promise for research and malware\nclassification. However, it does require scrutiny and discernment when the similarity\nthreshold is so low as to focus on a few functions, or less. As with previous attributory\nmethods, researchers must remain vigilant to the ever-looming threat of adversary\nadaptability.\n\nIsraeli nation-state-sponsored threat actor Flame leveraged a previously theoretical\n[cryptographic attack ​to spread laterally. Threat group Turla lead incident responders astray](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/06/flame-crypto-breakthrough/)\nby placing unrelated malware on their victims’ machines, and the Lamberts spliced random\nclean code to use as encryption keys in order to avoid accurate clustering. Our adversaries\nare resourceful. While fooling code similarity clustering takes significant effort and skill, we\nmust consider it possible for determined, higher-tier attackers with the right motivations.\n\n| | |\n\n\n-----\n\n#### FLASH REPORT\n\n##### Outlook\n\nThe operation to disrupt the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games was more extensive\nthan originally reported, with both organizers and infrastructure targeted simultaneously.\nThe wealth of spreading mechanisms embedded within the malware suggests an\naggressive effort to spread within these networks and cause maximum damage. The\nco-occurrence of code overlap in the malware may be indicative of a false flag operation,\nattempting to dilute evidence and confuse researchers. For the time being, attribution\nremains inconclusive.\n\nAbout Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future arms security teams with the only complete threat intelligence solution powered by patented machine\nlearning to lower risk.
