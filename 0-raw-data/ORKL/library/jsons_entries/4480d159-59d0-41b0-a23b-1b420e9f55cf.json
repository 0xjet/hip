In the case of Wannacry, Google’s Neel Mehta was able to identify a\ncode fragment which became the most important clue in the story, and was later confirmed\n[by further evidence, showing Wannacry as a pet project of the Lazarus group.](https://securelist.com/wannacry-and-lazarus-group-the-missing-link/78431/)\n\nTo date, nobody has been able to find any significant code sharing between ExPetr/Petya\nand older malware. Given our love for unsolved mysteries, we jumped right on it.\n\n## Analyzing the Similarities\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the beginning of the ExPetr outbreak, one of our team members pointed to the fact that\nthe specific list of extensions used by ExPetr is very similar to the one used by BlackEnergy’s\nKillDisk ransomware from 2015 and 2016 (Anton Cherepanov from ESET made the same\nobservation on Twitter).\n\nThe [BlackEnergy APT is a sophisticated threat actor that is known to have used at least one](https://securelist.com/blackenergy-apt-attacks-in-ukraine-employ-spearphishing-with-word-documents/73440/)\nzero day, coupled with destructive tools, and code geared towards attacking ICS systems.\nThey are widely confirmed as the entity behind the Ukraine power grid attack from 2015 as\nwell as a chain of other destructive attacks that plagued that country over the past years.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more about the BlackEnergy APT, be sure to check our\nprevious blogs on the topic:\n\n[BE2 custom plugins, router abuse and target profiles](https://securelist.com/be2-custom-plugins-router-abuse-and-target-profiles/67353/)\n[BE2 extraordinary plugins](https://securelist.com/be2-extraordinary-plugins-siemens-targeting-dev-fails/68838/)\n[BlackEnergy APT Attacks in Ukraine employ spearphishing with Word documents](https://securelist.com/blackenergy-apt-attacks-in-ukraine-employ-spearphishing-with-word-documents/73440/)\n\nGoing back to the hunt for similarities, here’s how the targeted extensions lists looks in\nExPetr and a version of a wiper used by the BE APT group in 2015:\n\nExPetr 2015 BlackEnergy wiper sample\n\n\n3ds, .7z, .accdb, .ai, .asp,\n.aspx, .avhd, .back, .bak, .c,\n.cfg, .conf, .cpp, .cs, .ctl,\n.dbf, .disk, .djvu, .doc, .docx,\n.dwg, .eml, .fdb, .gz, .h, .hdd,\n.kdbx, .mail, .mdb, .msg,\n.nrg, .ora, .ost, .ova, .ovf,\n.pdf, .php, .pmf, .ppt, .pptx,\n.pst, .pvi, .py, .pyc, .rar, .rtf,\n.sln, .sql, .tar, .vbox, .vbs,\n.vcb, .vdi, .vfd, .vmc, .vmdk,\n.vmsd, .vmx, .vsdx, .vsv,\n.work, .xls\n\n\n.3ds, .7z, .accdb, .accdc, .ai, .asp, .aspx, .avhd, .back,\n.bak, .bin, .bkf, .cer, .cfg, .conf, .crl, .crt, .csr, .csv, .dat,\n.db3, .db4, .dbc, .dbf, .dbx, .djvu, .doc, .docx, .dr, .dwg,\n.dxf, .edb, .eml, .fdb, .gdb, .git, .gz, .hdd, .ib, .ibz, .io, .jar,\n.jpeg, .jpg, .jrs, .js, .kdbx, .key, .mail, .max, .mdb, .mdbx,\n.mdf, .mkv, .mlk, .mp3, .msi, .my, .myd, .nsn, .oda, .ost,\n.ovf, .p7b, .p7c, .p7r, .pd, .pdf, .pem, .pfx, .php, .pio, .piz,\n.png, .ppt, .pptx, .ps, .ps1, .pst, .pvi, .pvk, .py, .pyc, .rar, .rb,\n.rtf, .sdb, .sdf, .sh, .sl3, .spc, .sql, .sqlite, .sqlite3, .tar, .tiff,\n.vbk, .vbm, .vbox, .vcb, .vdi, .vfd, .vhd, .vhdx, .vmc, .vmdk,\n.vmem, .vmfx, .vmsd, .vmx, .vmxf, .vsd, .vsdx, .vsv, .wav,\n.wdb, .xls, .xlsx, .xvd, .zip\n\n\nObviously, the lists are similar in composition and formatting, but not identical. Moreover,\nolder versions of the BE destructive module have even longer lists. Here’s a snippet of an\nextensions list from a 2015 BE sample that is even longer:\n\n\n-----\n\nNevertheless, the lists were similar in the sense of being stored in the same dot-separated\nformats. Although this indicated a possible link, we wondered if we could find more\nsimilarities, especially in the code of older variants of BlackEnergy and ExPetr.\n\nWe continued to chase that hunch during the frenetic early analysis phase and shared this\ngut feeling of a similarity between ExPetr and BlackEnergy with our friends at Palo Alto\nNetworks. Together, we tried to build a list of features that we could use to make a YARA rule\nto detect both ExPetr and BlackEnergy wipers.\n\nDuring the analysis, we focused on the similar extensions list and the code responsible for\nparsing the file system for encryption or wiping. Here’s the code responsible for checking the\nextensions to target in the current version of ExPetr:\n\nThis works by going through the target file system in a recursive way, then checking if the\nextension for each file is included in the dot-separated list. Unfortunately for our theory, the\nway this is implemented in older BlackEnergy variants is quite different; the code is more\n\n\n-----\n\ngeneric and the list of extensions to target is initialized at the beginning, and passed down to\nthe recursive disk listing function.\n\nInstead, we took the results of automated code comparisons and paired them down to a\nsignature that perfectly fit the mould of both in the hope of unearthing similarities. What we\ncame up with is a combination of generic code and interesting strings that we put together\ninto a cohesive rule to single out both BlackEnergy KillDisk components and ExPetr\nsamples. The main example of this generic code is the inlined wcscmp function merged by\nthe compiler’s optimization, meant to check if the filename is the current folder, which is\nnamed “.”. Of course, this code is pretty generic and can appear in other programs that\nrecursively list files. It’s inclusion alongside a similar extension list makes it of particular\ninterest to us –but remains a low confidence indicator.\n\nLooking further, we identified some other candidate strings which, although not unique, when\ncombined together allow us to fingerprint the binaries from our case in a more precise way.\nThese include:\n\nexe /r /f\nComSpec\nInitiateSystemShutdown\n\nWhen put together with the wcscmp inlined code that checks on the filename, we get the\nfollowing YARA rule:\n\nC++\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n\nrule blackenergy_and_petya_similarities {\n\nstrings:\n\n//shutdown.exe /r /f\n\n$bytes00 = { 73 00 68 00 75 00 74 00 64 00 6f 00 77 00 6e 00 2e 00 65 00 78 00 65\n00 }\n\n//ComSpec\n\n$bytes01 = { 43 00 6f 00 6d 00 53 00 70 00 65 00 63 00 }\n\n//InitiateSystemShutdown\n\n$bytes02 = { 49 6e 69 74 69 61 74 65 53 79 73 74 65 6d 53 68 75 74 64 6f 77 6e 45\n78 57}\n\n\n-----\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n\n//68A4430110           push     0100143A4 ;'ntdll.dll'\n\n//FF151CD10010          call     GetModuleHandleA\n\n//3BC7              cmp     eax,edi\n\n//7420              jz     ...\n\n$bytes03 = { 68 ?? ?? ?1 ?0 ff 15 ?? ?? ?? ?0 3b c7 74 ?? }\n\n// \"/c\"\n\n$bytes04 = { 2f 00 63 00 }\n\n//wcscmp(...\n\n$hex_string = { b9 ?? ?? ?1 ?0 8d 44 24 ?c 66 8b 10 66 3b 11 75 1e 66\n\n85 d2 74 15 66 8b 50 02 66 3b 51 02 75 0f 83 c0 04 83 c1 04 66 85 d2\n75\n\nde 33 c0 eb 05 1b c0 83 d8 ff 85 c0 0f 84 ?? 0? 00 00 b9 ?? ?? ?1 ?0\n8d\n\n44 24 ?c 66 8b 10 66 3b 11 75 1e 66 85 d2 74 15 66 8b 50 02 66 3b 51\n02\n\n75 0f 83 c0 04 83 c1 04 66 85 d2 75 de 33 c0 eb 05 1b c0 83 d8 ff 85\nc0\n\n0f 84 ?? 0? 00 00 }\n\ncondition:\n\n((uint16(0) == 0x5A4D)) and (filesize < 5000000) and\n\n(all of them)\n\n}\n\n\nWhen run on our extensive (read: very big) malware collection, the YARA rule above fires\n**on BlackEnergy and ExPetr samples only. Unsurprisingly, when used alone, each string**\ncan generate false positives or catch other unrelated malware However when combined\n\n\n-----\n\n**together in this fashion, they become very precise. The technique of grouping generic or**\npopular strings together into unique combinations is one of the most effective methods for\nwriting powerful Yara rules.\n\nOf course, this should not be considered a sign of a definitive link, but it does point to\ncertain code design similarities between these malware families.\n\nThis low confidence but persistent hunch is what motivates us to ask other researchers\n**around the world to join us in investigating these similarities and attempt to discover**\n**more facts about the origin of ExPetr/Petya. Looking back at other high profile cases, such**\nas the Bangladesh Bank Heist or Wannacry, there were few facts linking them to the Lazarus\ngroup. In time, more evidence appeared and allowed us, and others, to link them together\nwith high confidence. Further research can be crucial to connecting the dots, or, disproving\nthese theories.\n\nWe’d like to think of this ongoing research as an opportunity for an open invitation to the\nlarger security community to help nail down (or disprove) the link between BlackEnergy and\nExPetr/Petya. Our colleagues at [ESET have published their own excellent analysis](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/30/telebots-back-supply-chain-attacks-against-ukraine/)\nsuggesting a possible link between ExPetr/Petya and TeleBots (BlackEnergy). Be sure to\ncheck out their analysis. And as mentioned before, a special thanks to our friends at Palo\nAlto for their contributions on clustering BlackEnergy samples.\n\n**Hashes**\n\n**ExPetr:**\n\n027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a745\n\n**BE:**\n\n11b7b8a7965b52ebb213b023b6772dd2c76c66893fc96a18a9a33c8cf125af80\n\n5d2b1abc7c35de73375dd54a4ec5f0b060ca80a1831dac46ad411b4fe4eac4c6\n\nF52869474834be5a6b5df7f8f0c46cbc7e9b22fa5cb30bee0f363ec6eb056b95\n\n368d5c536832b843c6de2513baf7b11bcafea1647c65df7b6f2648840fa50f75\n\nA6a167e214acd34b4084237ba7f6476d2e999849281aa5b1b3f92138c7d91c7a\n\nEdbc90c217eebabb7a9b618163716f430098202e904ddc16ce9db994c6509310\n\nF9f3374d89baf1878854f1700c8d5a2e5cf40de36071d97c6b9ff6b55d837fca\n\n[BlackEnergy](https://securelist.com/tag/blackenergy/)\n[Data Encryption](https://securelist.com/tag/data-encryption/)\n[Petya](https://securelist.com/tag/petya/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ransomware](https://securelist.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Wiper](https://securelist.com/tag/wiper/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nFrom BlackEnergy to ExPetr\n\nYour email address will not be published.
