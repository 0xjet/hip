This is a malware family\nthat's been spread with increasing regularity and could become the next big player in the\nspam space.\n\nSQUIRRELWAFFLE provides threat actors with an initial foothold onto systems and their\nnetwork environments that can then be used to facilitate further compromise or additional\nmalware infections depending on how adversaries choose to attempt to monetize their\naccess. In many cases, these infections are also being used to deliver and infect systems\n[with other malware like Qakbot and the penetration-testing tool Cobalt Strike. Let's take a](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/05/qakbot-levels-up-with-new-obfuscation.html)\nlook at how this new threat operates and the volume and characteristics of the malicious\nemail campaigns associated with it. Organizations should be aware of this threat, as it will\nlikely persist across the threat landscape for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Email campaigns\n\nThe email threat landscape is constantly changing as new threats emerge or existing threats\n[evolve over time. Over the past few years, Emotet has been one of the primary threats being](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/11/emotet-2020.html)\ndelivered via malicious spam campaigns as we have previously described in detail several\n[times. Following law enforcement disruption of the Emotet botnets, we've been waiting for](https://www.wired.com/story/emotet-botnet-takedown/)\nanother threat to fill the void left by Emotet's exit.\n\nBeginning in mid-September 2021, we observed malspam campaigns being used to deliver\nmalicious Microsoft Office documents that function as the initial stage of the infection process\nand are used to infect systems with SQUIRRELWAFFLE. Similar to what has been observed\nin previous threats like Emotet, these campaigns appear to be leveraging stolen email\nthreads, as the emails themselves appear to be replies to existing email threads. As shown\nbelow, these emails typically contain hyperlinks to malicious ZIP archives being hosted on\nattacker-controlled web servers.\n\nThe language targeted by the reply messages typically matches the language used in the\noriginal email thread, demonstrating that there is some localization taking place dynamically.\nWhile the majority of the emails were written in English, the use of other languages across\n\n\n-----\n\nthese campaigns highlight that this threat is not limited to a specific geographic region.\nAcross the malicious email campaigns we have observed being used to deliver\nSQUIRRELWAFFLE, the top five languages used are as follows:\n\nConsistent with other threats also leveraging stolen email threads, we observed some\ninconsistencies in how the attacker chooses which email chains to hijack. In the following\nexample, the attacker was observed replying to an extortion email message, which is likely\nineffective in convincing the recipient to access the content in the body of the email.\n\nSince the emergence of SQUIRRELWAFFLE, we have observed steady malicious email\ncampaign activity associated with this threat. Below is a graph illustrating the volumetric\ntrajectory of these campaigns between Sept. 1 and Oct. 15, 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the volume associated with these campaigns is not yet reaching the same level seen\npreviously with threats like Emotet, it appears to be fairly consistent and may increase over\ntime as the adversaries infect more users and increase the size of their botnet. The\ncampaigns themselves feature several similar characteristics to the campaigns previously\nseen associated with established threats like Emotet. Due to the prevalence of these\ncampaigns, organizations should be aware of SQUIRRELWAFFLE and the way it could be\nused by attackers to further compromise corporate networks.\n\nIn all of these cases, the emails are designed to trick the potential victim into accessing the\nincluded hyperlink to download a malicious ZIP archive. Malicious Microsoft Office files are\ninside the archives, which initiate the infection process as described below.\n\n## Infection process\n\nWhen the victim accesses the hyperlink contained in the initial malicious spam message,\nthey are sent a ZIP archive containing a malicious Office document. While these documents\nhave varied across campaigns, in all cases, they are either Microsoft Word documents or\nMicrosoft Excel spreadsheets. These documents contain the malicious code responsible for\nretrieving and executing the next stage component, in this case, the SQUIRRELWAFFLE\npayload.\n\nAcross all of the malspam campaigns observed, the distribution of DOC versus XLS was\nroughly 50/50.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn all of the campaigns observed, the distribution URLs that are used to host the malicious\nZIP archives contain Latin words and follow a URL structure similar to the following example:\n```\nabogados-en-medellin[.]com/odit-error/assumenda[.]zip\n\n```\nWe've observed that, in many cases, there are separate ZIP archives being hosted in\ndifferent directories on the same domain at any given point in time. Inside of the ZIP\narchives, the malicious Office documents often follow a naming convention similar to the\nexamples below:\n```\nchart-1187900052.xls\ndiagram-127.doc\ndiagram_1017101088.xls\nspecification-1001661454.xls\n\n```\nSince these campaigns began, we observed several variations in the way the documents\nfunction, so will describe two of the most common infection chains we observed in\nSeptember. This threat is actively evolving, and during our research into\nSQUIRRELWAFFLE, we observed the distribution campaigns' shift to almost exclusively\nusing Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for this purpose.\n\n### Malicious Word documents\n\nAs previously described, the initial malicious Office document format used across many of\nthe early email campaigns was a Microsoft Word document. In this case it was made to\nappear as if it was associated with DocuSign, a popular document sharing and signing\nplatform that is often used for a variety of purposes related to official transactions.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this particular case, the document contains malicious macros that initiate the\nSQUIRRELWAFFLE infection process if enabled by the victim. These macros are\nAutoOpen() and reference a macro function that contains the majority of the malicious code.\nBelow is an example of one of these malicious functions present in one of the samples\nanalyzed.\n\nAs can be observed in the previous code, the macros leverage string reversal as a way to\nslightly obfuscate the contents of the code. This macro is responsible for writing a VBS script\nto %PROGRAMDATA% and then executing it. The contents of the malicious script can be\nseen in the following screenshot.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis script is responsible for the retrieval of the SQUIRRELWAFFLE payload itself from one\nof the five hardcoded URLs present in the script. In this case, SQUIRRELWAFFLE is\ndelivered to the victim's system as a malicious DLL that is then executed using rundll32.exe.\n\n### Malicious Excel spreadsheets\n\nMany of the campaigns were observed using malicious Excel spreadsheets rather than Word\ndocuments.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese spreadsheets contain malicious Excel4 macros that are responsible for retrieving and\nexecuting the SQUIRRELWAFFLE payload. Below is an example of one of these macros\nthat has been cleaned up to improve readability.\n\nSimilar to what was observed with the Word document lures, these macros contain three\nhardcoded URLs that host the DLL associated with SQUIRRELWAFFLE. Once retrieved, the\nDLL is executed via ShellExecuteA and regsvr32.exe, thus infecting the system. The ZIP\narchives and associated maldocs are rotated across emails, resulting in large quantities of\n\n\n-----\n\nunique samples. However, the SQUIRRELWAFFLE distribution URLs appear to be fairly\ncommon across samples for a given email campaign.\n\n## Campaign timeline and variations\n\nWe believe the earliest files used in these campaigns were submitted to public malware\nrepositories on Sept. 10, 2021. The campaign volume began to ramp up on Sept. 13, 2021\nand has been characterized by daily spam runs observed since then. In analyzing these\ncampaigns, we observed some interesting characteristics associated with the infection chain.\nThe URL structure of the SQUIRRELWAFFLE distribution servers appears somewhat tied to\nthe daily campaigns, and rotates every few days. For example, the following table shows the\nvariance in the URL landing pages seen over a period of several days.\n\nThis rotation is also reflected in the maldoc macros themselves, with the macro function\nnames and hashes rotating at the same time. This is reflected in the table below, which\nshows some of the macro function names, hashes and the corresponding campaign landing\npages used by the macros to retrieve the SQUIRREWAFFLE DLL files observed across\nsome of the initial malspam campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese characteristics confirm that these documents are likely being crafted using an\nautomated builder. In more recent campaigns, the Microsoft Excel spreadsheets were crafted\n[to make static analysis with tools like XLMDeobfuscator less effective.](https://github.com/DissectMalware/XLMMacroDeobfuscator)\n\n## Distribution infrastructure\n\nThese malware distribution campaigns appear to be taking advantage of previously\ncompromised web servers, primarily running versions of the WordPress content\nmanagement system (CMS). Across the distribution servers we analyzed prior to\nhost/domain suspension, the most prevalent version was WordPress 5.8.1.\n\nIn one case, we also identified a SQL dump related to an AZORult panel present on the\nsame host being used as a C2 server by SQUIRRELWAFFLE. As is often the case with\nvulnerable servers exposed to the internet, it is unclear whether this panel was being\nadministered by the same threat actor or if the server had simply been compromised by\nmultiple unrelated entities.\n\nOne of the distribution servers also appeared to have had ANTIBOT deployed by\nadversaries on Sept. 8, 2021, shortly before the SQUIRRELWAFFLE distribution campaigns\ninitially launched that made use of this server.\n\nANTIBOT is a set of scripts commonly used as a component of phishing kits and can help\nactors evade analysis. This popular add-on will block access to the contents of their web\nservers if the HTTP/HTTPS requests originate from an IP address that is not determined to\nbe a potential victim but is instead associated with automated analysis platforms, security\nresearch organizations, or other locations that attackers may want to avoid. When HTTP\nrequests are received, the requestor is checked against several lists of IPs, ASN names and\nother artifacts. If any of the information matches, the server responds with an HTTP 404\nstatus code. Below is an example of the logic used by this process. Note that the contents of\n\n\n-----\n\neach array have been redacted, as they are prohibitively long and could not be included in\nthe screenshot. Typically, they contain large lists of IP addresses, network provider strings\nand more.\n\nCombined with the IP blocklist present across many SQUIRRELWAFFLE DLLs, this\ndemonstrates an effort to make the infrastructure more resilient and difficult to analyze. By\nlimiting the ability for systems to retrieve malicious components, adversaries may more\neffectively evade large-scale automated analysis. Over time, the distribution infrastructure\nhas become significantly more aggressive at restricting access to the malicious components\nand is employing techniques, like geographic-based filtering, to prevent analysis and\ntracking.\n\n## SQUIRRELWAFFLE loader\n\nThe SQUIRRELWAFFLE payload that is dropped on infected systems is a PE DLL that is\nexecuted using either rundll32.exe or regsvr32.exe depending on the maldoc used to initiate\nthe infection process. Here's an example of the syntax used to execute the payload using\nrundll32.exe, specifying the entry point:\n```\ncmd.exe /c rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\[DLL FILENAME],ldr\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nExecuting the DLL directly without specifying the required parameter will likely not result in\nsuccessful execution of the payload and may allow it to evade automated dynamic analysis\nplatforms.\n\nThe DLLs primarily function as a malware loader, enabling the infections to be used to\ndeploy additional malware. SQUIRRELWAFFLE infections have been observed to coincide\nwith [Qakbot and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/05/qakbot-levels-up-with-new-obfuscation.html) [Cobalt Strike installations following the initial compromise of the endpoint.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/09/coverage-strikes-back-cobalt-strike-paper.html)\nThe DLL also features an IP blocklist as part of its configuration that is used to attempt to\nfurther evade automated analysis platforms and security research organizations.\n\nThe operation of the DLL is fairly straightforward. The most interesting functionality is used to\nencode and decode information to facilitate communications between the victim system and\nthe C2 infrastructure. Below is a screenshot of the decompiled function responsible for this\nprocess.\n\nAdditional information regarding the C2 protocol used by the malware can be found in the\nfollowing section.\n\n### Command and control (C2)\n\nThe malware attempts to communicate with a C2 over HTTP POST requests containing\n\n\n-----\n\nobfuscated data:\n\nThe data present in these communications has been obfuscated using XOR and then\nBase64-encoded. The URL used by the victim to POST data to the C2 server consists of a\nrandom one- to 28-character alphanumeric string, followed by the IP address of the victim's\nsystem. The URL in the previous HTTP POST request can be deobfuscated to the following:\n\nThe body of the HTTP POST request contains information about the victim system. The data\nsent to the C2 includes:\n\n%APPDATA% configuration.\nThe hostname of the system.\nThe username of the victim.\nThe Workstation configuration of the system.\n\nThis information is retrieved using getenv, GetComputerNameW, GetUserNameW, and\nNetWkstaGetInfo() respectively. An example of the deobfuscated request body of an\nexample HTTP POST is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 server will respond to these requests with a status code as well as the previously\nsent beacon information. The response body is obfuscated using the same method as\npreviously described. An example response from C2 is shown below.\n\nThis C2 channel is also used to deliver secondary payloads at the discretion of the attacker.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nA new malware loader named \"SQUIRRELWAFFLE\" has recently emerged in the threat\nlandscape. This threat is primarily delivered via malicious spam email campaigns and\nfeatures several interesting characteristics that organizations should be aware of. These\ninfections are also used to facilitate the delivery of additional malware such as Qakbot and\nCobalt Strike, two of the most common threats regularly observed targeting organizations\naround the world. While this threat is relatively new, the distribution campaigns,\ninfrastructure, and C2 implementations feature several interesting techniques that are similar\nto those seen from other more established threats. Organizations should continue to employ\ncomprehensive defense-in-depth security controls to ensure that they can prevent, detect, or\nrespond to SQUIRRELWAFFLE campaigns that may be encountered in their environments.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
