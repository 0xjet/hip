Malicious actors, criminal organizations, and even\nindividuals busily diversified malware tools and families, attack vectors, and distribution\nchannels — all aimed at an expanding array of targets. Meanwhile, nation-state\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) group activity ratcheted up in volume and targets.\nHere are a few highlights of the major trends that we observed.\n\n###### COUNTDOWN TO ATTACK\n\nConstant targets of DDoS malware, IoT devices are now under attack five minutes\nafter being plugged in and targeted by specific exploits within 24 hours. IoT security\nis minimal to nonexistent on many devices, making this an increasingly dangerous and\nvulnerable sector as now everything from life-saving medical devices and equipment\nto home security systems and cars are IoT-equipped.\n\n\nATTACKED WITHIN\n\n###### 5 MINUTES\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THE ‘TERRORBIT ATTACK’ AND BEYOND\n\nFebruary and March of 2018 marked the first reported terabit attacks.\nWhile the second half of 2018 didn’t reveal new attacks at that volume,\n\nit is likely due to systemic changes to counter the Memcached vulnerability\nand the fact that other vectors didn’t emerge. Overall attack numbers were\nup 26 percent, while those in the 100–400 Gbps range exploded, showing\ncontinued interest and maturity of tooling in this midrange. It’s only a matter\nof time before new vulnerabilities drive attacks at the higher end again.\n\n###### NATION-STATE INNOVATION\n\nActivity from key nation-state actors such as China, Russia, Iran, and\nNorth Korea showed no sign of ebbing. New groups emerged, while known\nentities updated and evolved their tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs), combining custom tools with commodity crimeware to further extend\ntheir reach. We noted continued innovation from groups, such as the use of\nChrome extensions to enable persistence in the STOLEN PENCIL campaign.\n\n###### COMMERCIALIZATION OF CRIMEWARE\n\nWe saw a robust marketplace driven by well-stocked innovation pipelines\nfrom rapidly growing organizations. If this sounds like a business story, that’s\nbecause it is. The cybercriminal underground operates much like a legitimate\nbusiness on the right side of the law, with the huge proviso that cybercrime\norganizations cause billions of dollars in damage and negatively impact major\nenterprises and governments.\n\nFor instance, campaigns such as DanaBot use an affiliate model that\ndistributes labor to specialists and moves away from the more inefficient\nmethod of managing the entire process in house. While this was popularized\na few years ago with exploit kits like Angler, DanaBot has taken it to the next\nlevel by rapidly establishing its presence across the globe with 12 separate\naffiliates targeting financial institutions in many countries. Can a B-school\ncase study write-up be far behind?\n\n\nOVERALL THE NUMBER OF\nDDoS ATTACKS INCREASES\n\n\nCAMPAIGN HAS TAKEN\nCRIMEWARE TO THE NEXT LEVEL,\nESTABLISHING ITS PRESENCE\nACROSS THE GLOBE WITH\n\n###### 12 AFFILIATES\n\nTARGETING\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\n###### NETSCOUTʼs unique position protecting enterprise networks  and the internet through our service provider customers  gives us wide visibility into this dynamic and ever-changing environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n### ADVANCED THREAT\n\n###### The ATLAS Security and Engineering Research Team (ASERT) tracked\n\n approximately 35 APT groups around the globe in the latter half of\n\n 2018. These groups targeted verticals such as academia, government,\n\n and finance across the Middle East; the United States; Central and\n\n South America; and East and Southeast Asia. While the groups varied \n\n in sophistication, targeting, and TTPs, we saw the continued\n\n emergence of numerous groups on a worldwide basis.\n\n\n### ADVANCED THREAT\n\n\n###### NETSCOUT THREAT INTELLIGENCE\n\n\nAPT groups not only grew in number, but also in sophistication. Nation\nstates continually added additional facets of cyber espionage to their toolkit,\nincluding new targeting methods. They used methods such as a unified\nextensible firmware interface (UEFI) rootkit known as LoJax and a browser\nplugin first utilized by a suspected North Korean group. In addition to\nuncovering previously unknown operations and researching new campaigns\nand methods, ASERT tracked dozens of APT groups and their activity across\nthe internet using ATLAS[®].\n\n###### KEY FINDINGS INCLUDE\n\n- \u0007New nation-state APT group activity was discovered at an accelerating\nrate, while known groups evolved and expanded their capabilities.\n\n- \u0007The global diversity of APT operations resulted in a wide array\nof targeting that included academia, government, finance, and\ntelecommunications industries.\n\n- \u0007Analysis of APT malware samples in the ASERT holdings found\ncombinations of custom tools and crimeware, as well as misuse\nof legitimate software such as LoJax.\n\n- \u0007The numerous groups we tracked added additional capabilities to their\narsenal, including a few observed zero-day attacks, the malicious use of\nlegitimate bootkit software, and at least one instance of a browser plugin.\n\n\n###### NETSCOUT THREAT INTELLIGENCE\n\nTRACKED APPROXIMATELY\n\n#### 35\n\nAPT GROUPS\nIN 2H 2018\n\n\n-----\n\nHighly engaged in the South China\nSea, this group is very interested in\nboth military and commercial regional\nactivity, targeting countries and\norganizations that monitor or transit the\narea. Maritime, defense, and logistics\nindustries are commonly targeted along\nwith in-region countries, including a\nrecent attack targeting Cambodia.[1]\n\nLeviathan suspected of using\na variety of tools such as\nResponder, NetBIOS Poisoning\nTool, and exploitation\nmethods like ETERNALBLUE.\nThe use of these tools came\nonly after they’d been made\npublic, showcasing this\ngroups preference to\n“live off the land”.[2]\n\n\nAssociated with the Ministry of State\nSecurity (MSS), this group targets\nmanaged service providers (MSPs)\nas a conduit to accessing sensitive\ninformation in a variety of industries,\nespecially in Japan. They play a long\ngame of careful reconnaissance\nfollowed by intrusion into service\norganizations in order to gain access\nto the actual target, which enables\n\nthem to target entire supply chains\nand industries. ASERT observed a large\nspike in activity against logistics and\ngovernment targets in July and August\n2018, lending further credence to their\nlong-game tactics.\n\n\nThis group focuses heavily on\ndiplomats and embassies and has\ntargeted central Asian governments\nfor at least most of 2018 by accessing\na common data center. The group\nutilized that access to turn government\nwebsites into watering holes to lure\nadditional victims. The diplomatic\ntargeting is historically related to\nCentral and Western Asia’s political\n\nclimate. Because of the nature of the\ngroup’s TTPs, victims often range across\nverticals such as government, academia,\nand finance in addition to the primary\ntargets of diplomats and embassies.\n\nEmissary Panda spotted\nutilizing an in-memory\nC++ Trojan that listens\nfor incoming connections\nfrom the C2 along with\ninjecting C2 traffic into\nan RDP port.[3] The group used\na proxy tool, signed using\na stolen certificate, to\ndrop the trojan.\n\n\n###### CHINA\n\n Exfiltration of intellectual property via human \n\n and cyber means has been a fundamental component \n\n of China’s modernization. It still is carried out \n\n by Chinese APT groups, despite the fact that China\n\n has the means to purchase any patents or companies\n\n that it desires.\n\nThe majority of what ASERT observed in 2H 2018 centered on geopolitical and\nstrategic intelligence gathering, including a highly publicized hotel breach.\n\n###### Leviathan or  Stone Panda, Emissary Panda  TEMP.Periscope APT10, or Menupass or Lucky Mouse\n\nHighly engaged in the South China Associated with the Ministry of State This group focuses heavily on\nSea, this group is very interested in Security (MSS), this group targets diplomats and embassies and has\n\n\n-----\n\n###### IRAN\n\n From ASERT’s perspective, Iranian APT groups appeared\n\n to continue on steadily, although changes in their\n\n targeting sometimes made them more or less visible.\n\nThey continued to develop and evolve their malware, heavily target their neighbors, and\nclosely monitor Iranians (both in-country and out). They also targeted the usual sectors\nfor intelligence value: aerospace, technology, and governments, among others.\n\n###### Dark Hydrus\n\nThis APT group is a relative newcomer (first observed in the summer of 2018) that\ntypically targets governments in the Middle East, but ASERT also observed financial\ninstitutions in Asia being targeted. ASERT found a significant overlap in the indicators\nof compromise (IoCs) in these verticals, suggesting that the same TTPs were used.\n\nDark Hydrus added a number of anti-analysis/anti-sandbox checks\nto a malware family called RogueRobin[4]\nare not new, the adversary included a large number of checks that\ninclude known sandbox names, RAM & CPU size/number, and instructions\nto look for known analysis tools like Wireshark and SysInternals.\n\n\n-----\n\n[5]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### RUSSIA\n\n Russian APT operations largely target government \n\n or government-affiliated networks.\n\n**Specifically in the following areas:**\n\n - Geopolitical workings of its neighboring states\n\n - \u0007Western, NATO, and democratic encroachment in Eastern Europe\nand the military campaign in Syria\n\n - Russian annexation of the Crimea in Ukraine\n\n\nCannon, a custom emailbased C2 channel leveraged\nby the group, is written\nin both C# and Delphi.[7]\n\nFancy Bear’s double agent\nLoJax UEFI writing module\nwas found in the wild by\nESET researchers.[8]\n\n\nThis APT group employed legitimate UEFI rootkit software to establish a backdoor\non victim machines. The malicious files, originally classified as “unwanted software”\nby anti-virus vendors, avoided detection by minimally tweaking the software to\nphone home to the attacker C2 servers without changing any functionality within the\nsoftware itself. Notably, systems compromised by LoJax could also be monitored in\nreal time by the group. The nature of the hijacked software allowed the geo-location\nof the infected machine.\n\nThis type of targeting serves the purpose of potentially finding and following\nhigh-value targets and gaining access to potentially sensitive materials on\ncompromised computers. ASERT tracked the infrastructure using custom fingerprints\nand identified live, active attacker controlled C2 servers. We found this group heavily\ntargeting government entities around the world. In October, the U.S. Department of\nJustice issued indictments against members of this group, claiming that: “…beginning\nin or around December 2014 and continuing until at least May 2018, the conspiracy\nconducted persistent and sophisticated computer intrusions affecting U.S. persons,\ncorporate entities, international organizations, and their respective employees located\naround the world, based on their strategic interest to the Russian government.”\n\n\n###### RUSSIA\n\n Russian APT operations largely target government \n\n or government-affiliated networks.\n\n**Specifically in the following areas:**\n\n                                - Geopolitical workings of its neighboring states\n\n                              - \u0007Western, NATO, and democratic encroachment in Eastern Europe\nand the military campaign in Syria\n\n                               - Russian annexation of the Crimea in Ukraine\n\n                                - Espionage operations against major players of interest\n\nASERT also tracked some disinformation domains of known Russian origin,\nwhich tend to rise and fall as current events and priorities change. Russia stands\naccused of meddling in the elections of up to 27 countries over the past decade.\nBloomberg reports that European Union officials are already bracing for Russian\ncyberattacks and disinformation campaigns ahead of the spring 2019 elections\nof its member states.\nFancy Bear is using\nmultiple languages to\nwrite the same tools.\nZebrocy, a downloader and Fancy Bear, APT28, or Sednit\nbackdoor tool, has been\n\nThis APT group employed legitimate UEFI rootkit software to establish a backdoor\n\nseen writing in Delphi,\n\non victim machines.

Most interesting, however, was that ASERT saw substantial internal\nactivity where Vietnamese victim machines attempted to phone home to a known\nC2 infrastructure owned by Ocean Lotus, suggesting the group also focuses on\ninternal targeting.\n\n###### PoisonVine, APT-C-01, or PoisonIvy Group\n\nActive for years, this group specializes in conducting cyber espionage campaigns\nagainst key national Chinese agencies, including defense, government, science,\ntechnology, academic, and maritime. The group primarily focuses on the military\nindustry, Chinese strategic relations, cross-strait issues with Taiwan and China,\nand ocean-related fields. ASERT observed additional activity targeting government,\nacademic, finance, and non-profit sectors.\n\n\n###### VIETNAM\n\n First seen in 2012, Vietnamese APT operators \n\n have flown below the radar until recently. \n\n Vietnam currently has at least three APT groups, \n\n two of which are rarely seen operating beyond\n\n\nPoisonVine utilizes RATs that\ncan detect the presence of\nanti-virus based upon how the\nAV simulates the windows API\ncall 'GetClientRect'.[9]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### REPUBLIC OF KOREA\n\nprofessionals around the world.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CRIMEWARE\n\n###### Financially motivated threat actors rely on crimeware: malware\n\n intended to loot the victim’s bank account or steal victim data\n\n to exploit for money. For crimeware actors, the key word is more:\n\n more groups, more attack monetization, more businesslike methods,\n\n and certainly more and better tools. We are seeing new attacks\n\n from additional groups, often using increasingly sophisticated and\n\n persistent malware coupled with innovative techniques that target\n\n an expanded set of targets.\n\n KEY FINDINGS INCLUDE\n\n- \u0007Once plugged in to the internet, IoT devices are attacked within five minutes\nand targeted by specific exploits within 24 hours.\n\n- \u0007Actors grew ever more sophisticated and efficient at monetizing malicious\n\nDANABOT’S AFFILIATE\n\nattacks using modular, persistent crimeware that provides a better ROI than\n\nMODEL FUELED GLOBAL\n\na simple smash-and-grab method.\n\nPROLIFERATION IN ONLY\n\n- \u0007Crime campaigns like DanaBot increased distribution efficiency and cut labor\ncosts by using an affiliate model that encourages specialization among threat\nactors and substantially increases the pool of potential victims across the world. **8 MONTHS**\n\n- \u0007The overall lifetime of crimeware infections sometimes lasts years, long after\nan infrastructure goes offline.\n\nONCE PLUGGED INTO THE\n\n- \u0007Several strains of IoT malware showed a marked increase in design sophistication. INTERNET, IoT DEVICES\n\nARE ATTACKED WITHIN\n\n- \u0007Cyber threat actors learned from IoT malware, pivoting to add Linux\nservers to their targets.\n\n\nDANABOT’S AFFILIATE\nMODEL FUELED GLOBAL\nPROLIFERATION IN ONLY\n\n###### 8 MONTHS\n\nONCE PLUGGED INTO THE\nINTERNET, IoT DEVICES\nARE ATTACKED WITHIN\n###### 5 MINUTES\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CRIMEWARE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nIn late 2018, we saw a growing array of crimeware morph into modularized\nframeworks, adding functionality to increase the monetization of infection\nbeyond a simple smash-and-grab. Common modules include spam delivery,\npassword theft, or cryptocurrency mining. Much like the old story of the\n\ncamel with its head in the tent, that first successful incursion into a victim’s\nmachine is only the initial step. More often than not, cyber adversaries\nuse the original foothold as an avenue to leverage many different malware\npayloads to further infect and exploit their victims.\n\nCrimeware families wax and wane in popularity as features become available\nand infrastructure changes hands in underground marketplaces (Figure 1).\nAmong the hundreds of malware families tracked by ASERT, we observed\nspikes in families like IcedID, often delivered by Emotet, and DanaBot,\n[a modular malware framework first discovered in May 2018.[11] Simultaneously,](https://asert.arbornetworks.com/danabots-travels-a-global-perspective/)\nwe observed a significant decrease in established families like Panda Banker,\nan offshoot of the classic Zeus malware family.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DANABOT ZEUS\n\n EMOTET ICEDID\n\n VICTIMOLOGY\n PANDABANKER\n\nUsing telemetry from our products, we looked at the number of infections of\ncommon crimeware families during the last half of 2018. Victim geography is\nwidespread, as crime actors typically aim for broad dispersion in order to get\nmaximum effect.\n\nZeus-derived bankers like Panda Bot remained ever-present, but bankers and\ndownloaders like TrickBot and Emotet took center stage in the fall of 2018.\nLeading up to the middle of December, the noticeable drop-off in attacks likely\nrepresents computers going offline for the holiday season.\n\n\n###### TRICKBOT\n\n\n###### TRICKBOT\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CRIMEWARE GOES TO B-SCHOOL\n\nAs shown in a December blog post, the DanaBot crimeware family\nexemplifies the criminal underground’s increasing tendency to operate\nlike a regular business. For crimeware operators to make money, they\nneed to distribute their malware as widely as possible, maintain a C2\ninfrastructure, and cash out by converting banking credentials to hard\ncash. Each of these requires a separate skill set, creating an opportunity\nfor threat actors to provide specialized services to the underground.\n\nWhile the DanaBot authors maintain the centralized C2 infrastructure,\nthey outsource the distribution of the malware to third-party affiliates.\nThe affiliate model works using a tokenization method that allows\nthe owners to maintain oversight on the botnet. The affiliates handle\nmalware installation and cashing out, accepting the bulk of the\nrisk themselves.\n\nThis affiliate model promotes a much broader reach of potential\nvictims. With the distribution of labor, threat actors no longer need\nto single-handedly target bank accounts in multiple countries.\nBy outsourcing installation of the malware via affiliates, DanaBot\ngained a global foothold in the latter half of 2018 (Figure 3).\n\n|Affiliate ID|Targeted Countries|First Seen|\n|---|---|---|\n|3|Austria, Italy|9/6/2018|\n|4|Australia|9/24/2018|\n|8|Canada, US|9/11/2018|\n|9|Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland, US|9/15/2018|\n|12|Australia|9/26/2018|\n|13|Germany|9/29/2018|\n|15|Poland, US|11/21/2018|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Neverquest Infections by Day\n\n3000\n\n###### If this many  infections remain \n\n2500\n\n###### almost two years  after being shut \n\n2000 down, we can expect\n\n###### the malware we see \n\n1500 today to remain an\n\n###### ongoing problem for\n\n1000 security teams well\n\n###### into the future.\n\n500\n\n0\n\n**08/2018** **09/2018** **10/2018** **11/2018** **12/2018**\n\n_Figure 4: Neverquest Infections by Day_ _Estimated count due to gap in collection_\n\n###### CRIMEWARE: NO EXPIRATION DATE\n\nMalware infections tend to fester long past their official expiration dates.\nFor example, the Neverquest banking Trojan officially ended in 2017 when\nauthorities shut down this once-thriving criminal enterprise. And yet, it’s still\nout there. A malware sinkhole ASERT maintains continues to see almost 2,000\ndaily check-ins to Neverquest C2 sites that we registered prior to Neverquest’s\ndemise (Figure 4). As remediation or forced attrition eliminates the threat\nfrom victim machines, over time the number of infections has declined.\n\nThe longevity of these malware infections requires security defenders to\nremain vigilant long after the apparent threat subsides. Though we’ve yet\nto uncover adversaries registering expired domains to capitalize on ongoing\n\nBANKING TROJAN\n\ninfections, it is possible that attackers have leveraged this tactic, gaining\neasy access to sensitive data.\n\n###### NEVERQUEST\n\nWAS SHUT DOWN BY\nAUTHORITIES IN 2017,\nBUT MALWARE INFECTION\nSTILL LINGERS\n\n\n-----\n\nTHE TOP SOURCE\nCOUNTRIES OF BRUTE-FORCE\nIoT ACTIVITY\n\n\n###### IoT\n\nIoT devices are constant targets of DDoS malware. They can sit for months in\na warehouse or on a store shelf, waiting to be brought home and plugged into\na network. Once they are plugged in, our research shows IoT devices will be\ntargeted with a brute-force attack of common backdoor usernames and passwords\nwithin five minutes. Within hours, they will be subject to common exploits.[12]\n\nWe use our global network of IoT honeypots to monitor brute-force and exploit\nactivity. Brute-forcing happens when IoT malware continuously attacks random targets\nvia the antiquated Telnet protocol, running through lists of common factory-default\nusernames and passwords until they succeed and can deliver the malware to the victim\ndevice. The top source countries of brute-force IoT activity are Russia, China, Brazil,\n\nand the United States.\n\nAs highlighted in an October 2018 blog post, we’ve compiled a list of the most\ncommon username and password combinations used by IoT malware (Figure 6).\nWhile there is some regional affinity, the list is composed exclusively of hardcoded\ncredentials for many common classes of IoT devices, such as web-enabled cameras\nand home routers.[13]\n\nMirai remains the king of IoT malware. Since the authors of Mirai released the source\ncode in late 2016, threat actors tweaked the infection mechanisms by adding new\nusernames/passwords and exploits, as well as DDoS attack techniques.\n\n_Figure 5: Brute-Force IoT Activity by Country_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Common Username and Password Combinations\n\n user_pass: Descending Count\n\n root/xc3511 198,171\n\n support/support 159,661\n\n root/123456 152,959\n\n vstarcam2015/201 147,134\n\n e8ehomeasb/e8ehomeasb 134,808\n\n admin/admin 36,881\n\n guest/12345 30,089\n\n root/vizxv 25,783\n\n root/admin 23,800\n\n admin/1234 21,027\n\n_Figure 6: Common Username and Password Combinations_\n\n###### IoT MALWARE TRENDS\n\nThere are two trends in IoT malware we’ve seen in the latter half of 2018.\nFirst, there are several particularly interesting tactics hidden within the\nonslaught of Mirai variants. Earlier in the year, we saw an advanced threat\nactor use a malware named VPNFilter to target specific home routers.\nIt was delivered in multiple stages with a modularized payload, a level of\nsophistication not seen before in IoT malware.\n\nWe also observed Torii, which like VPNFilter, is a part of a new breed of\n\nadvanced IoT bots that deviate from using Mirai as its framework. Instead, Torii\nleverages a dropper to install and establish persistence, an unusual technique for\nIoT bots. Torii uses its own encryption scheme to communicate with its C2 and uses\nTCP port 443 as an evasion tactic. While most IoT botnets ship with pre-canned\nDDoS attacks, Torii focuses on data exfiltration. Torii is also built to be modular in\nnature, as it contains the ability to download files and execute remote commands.\n\nSecondly, threat actors are learning from their experience with IoT malware to\ntarget known vulnerabilities on Linux servers in the data center. For instance, the\nHadoop YARN vulnerability was initially used to deliver DemonBot, a DDoS malware,\nto IoT devices. Soon after, threat actors used the vulnerability to install Mirai on\nLinux servers, blurring the line between IoT and server malware.\n\n\n###### MIRAI\n\nREMAINS THE KING\nOF IoT MALWARE\n\n|user_pass: Descending|Count|\n|---|---|\n|root/xc3511|198,171|\n|support/support|159,661|\n|root/123456|152,959|\n|vstarcam2015/201|147,134|\n|e8ehomeasb/e8ehomeasb|134,808|\n|admin/admin|36,881|\n|guest/12345|30,089|\n|root/vizxv|25,783|\n|root/admin|23,800|\n|admin/1234|21,027|\n\n\n152,959\n\n147,134\n\n###### TORii\n\n134,808\n\n36,881\n\n###### +\n\n30,089\n\n###### VPNFILTER\n\n25,783\n\nARE TWO NEW BREEDS\n\n23,800\n\nOF ADVANCED IoT BOTS\n\n21,027\n\nThere are two trends in IoT malware we’ve seen in the latter half of 2018.\nFirst, there are several particularly interesting tactics hidden within the\nonslaught of Mirai variants.

The latter half of 2018 \n\n saw everything from state actors trying \n\n to influence geopolitical processes to \n\n an increasingly businesslike DDoS \n\n service-for-hire community.\n\nIn turn, that has led to a skyrocketing diversification of attack avenues, methods,\nand techniques, wiping away traditional expectations around both DDoS attack\nmechanisms and defense practices. Gone are the days where a single bot offered a\nsimplistic DDoS attack type. In today’s DDoS threat landscape, attackers increasingly\nadd diversification into their bots, allowing for a wide variation of attacks and\nprotocols to take down networks.\n\n###### KEY FINDINGS\n\n- \u0007Attack numbers were up 26 percent while attacks in the 100–200 Gbps,\n200–300 Gbps, and 300–400 Gbps exploded, up 169 percent, 2,500 percent,\nand 3,600 percent, respectively.\n\n- \u0007Capitalism is alive and well in the DDoS attack economy, which is growing ever more\nsophisticated and efficient at monetizing malicious attacks.\n\n- \u0007There was an increasing accessibility of attack vectors that were once the province of\nsophisticated attackers, such as the large increase in carpet-bombing DDoS attacks\nobserved in 2018.[14] A new variant of the reflection-type attacks, carpet-bomb attacks\ntake aim at entire subnets or CIDR blocks rather than focusing on specific target IPs.\nDue to the rapid weaponization of new attack types and inclusion into Booter/Stresser\nservices, these attacks are now becoming more prevalent.\n\n- \u0007Western governments and authorities are collaborating with private sector security\nexperts in law enforcement action against DDoS infrastructure. ASERT supported the\ninvestigation into the MedusaHTTP botnet, which ultimately led to an indictment of\nthe malware author by the US Department of Justice.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### DDoS ATTACK TRENDS\n\n\nIn our estimation, the increases across\nsuch a wide range llikely reflect the\ncontinued monetization of the threat\nlandscape. As DDoS-for-hire grows\nin accessibility and affordability, we\nexpect Booter/Stresser services to\nfurther proliferate and diversify. While\nthese tools are not necessarily new, the\n\nease of access, quick iteration of new\nattack types, and a broader range of\ninternational customers will result in lots\nof amateur cybercriminals getting hold\nof destructive malware. And it will result\nin a wider array of organizations being\ntargeted for any number of reasons.\nLaw-enforcement action against such\nservices and their users, as we’ve seen\nrecently, are the main counterbalance\nto their otherwise inexorable rise.\n\n\n###### Although the number of\n\n DDoS attacks increased\n\n year over year by about\n\n\n###### 26 percent, the dominant\n\n story continued to be\n\n\nIn this potent new strategy, threat\nactors launched strategic campaigns\nthat compromised and used a vast\narray of devices related solely by\ninternet connectivity.\n\nWhile we continued to see a steady\nuptick in attacks greater than 400\n\nGbps in the second half of 2018, it\nwas accompanied by an explosion of\nattacks at the lower end of the large\nattack range.

As the majority of enterprises (and even some internet\nservice providers) lack even the most rudimentary DDoS protection, a 15-year-old\nattack like TCP SYN flood, or a simple NTP reflection flood, is sufficient to take these\norganizations offline.\n\nHowever, as attackers often focus on high impact targets that take DDoS defense\nseriously, they constantly evolve new attack vectors designed to bypass or take\nadvantage of limitations or vulnerabilities in traditional DDoS defense solutions.\n\nOne of the attack vectors we’ve seen used since November 2017 is carpet bombing.\nThis is a new variant of the more common reflection, or flooding, attacks. Instead\nof focusing the attack on a single destination, the attacker targets every destination\nwithin a specific subnet or CIDR block (for example, a /20). Doing so makes it harder to\ndetect and mitigate the attacks, and the flood of attack traffic across network devices\nand internal links can potentially cause outages. These attacks are often fragmented,\nresulting in a flood of non-initial IP fragments (Figure 9). This will often happen when\nthe attacker is using UDP reflection attacks. This results in an attack that can be tricky\nto mitigate as the non-initial fragments don’t contain any information from the UDP\nheader, such as the source port used in the attack.\n\n###### Carpet Bombing Overview\n\n\n###### NEW ATTACK VECTOR\n CARPET BOMBING\n\nNEW VARIANT OF REFLECTION,\nOR FLOODING, ATTACKS\n\n\n###### NEW ATTACK VECTOR\n\n\n0 1472 2944 3980 **IP Payload Byte Offset**\n\n###### PAYLOAD Original 4000-byte packet in sending host IP stack\n\n**Offset = 0, More Fragments = 0**\n\nFirst fragment / initial fragment\n\n###### PAYLOAD FRAGMENT No UDP\n\nheader\n**Offset = 0** Intermediate\n**More Fragments = 1** **PAYLOAD FRAGMENT** No UDP fragment\n\nheader\n\n**Offset = 1472**\n**More Fragments = 1**\n\n###### PAYLOAD FRAGMENT Last fragment\n\n**Offset = 2928**\n**More Fragments = 0**\n\n_Figure 9: Carpet Bombing overview_\n\n|PAYLOAD UDP Offset = 0, More Fragments = 0 PAYLOAD FRAGMENT UDP No UDP header Offset = 0 More Fragments = 1 PAYLOAD FRAGMENT IP Offset = 1472 More Fragments = 1 IP|No UDP header PAYLOAD FRAGMENT|\n|---|---|\n\n\n###### PAYLOAD\n\n**Offset = 0, More Fragments = 0**\n\n###### PAYLOAD FRAGMENT No UDP\n\nheader\n**Offset = 0**\n**More Fragments = 1** **PAYLOAD FRAGMENT** No UDP\n\nheader\n\n**Offset = 1472**\n**More Fragments = 1** **PAYLOAD FRAGMENT**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 9 OUT OF 12\n\nATTACK TYPES LISTED\nSHOW A SIGNIFICANT\nINCREASE IN NUMBER\nOF ATTACKS\n\n###### mDNS AMPLIFICATION\n\nATTACKS INCREASED\n\n###### 233%\n\nMAX ATTACK SIZE\n\n###### 8.28 186 GBPS GBPS\n\nIN 2H 2017 IN 2H 2018\n\n###### SSDP AMPLIFICATION\n\nNUMBERS INCREASED\n\n###### 55%\n\n\nIn addition, the attacker will often shift their attacks from one subnet (or CIDR block)\nto another, complicating the detection and mitigation even further.\n\nDetecting carpet bombing attacks requires a slightly different technique. Traditional\nflow-based detection that focuses on specific destination IP addresses will usually\nnot work, as the attack traffic will be spread across all IP addresses in the networks\nunder attack. Instead, companies must analyze traffic volumes crossing network\nboundaries or traversing specific network devices as this will show the broader\nattack volume. Network traffic should therefore be profiled and average volumes\nmeasured on a regular basis to understand what normal traffic volumes look like,\nincluding typical spikes within them. These attacks can also be detected by profiling\ntraffic to groups of resources or larger subnets within the network and then\ndetecting anomalies over this traffic.\n\n**When it comes to mitigation, carpet bombing attacks use traditional DDoS**\n**reflection type attacks or flooding attacks, and can be mitigated using the**\n**same approaches:**\n\n- \u0007Traffic from unwanted source ports can be dropped or rate-limited using\ninfrastructure access lists (IACL) or FlowSpec.\n\n- \u0007The source IPs producing the attacks can be blocked using iACLs, FlowSpec\nor source-based, remote-triggered blackholing (S/RTBH).\n\n- \u0007Non-initial fragments can usually be safely rate-limited down to low values\n(1 percent). For DNS replies, an exemption should be made for each DNS recursive\ninfrastructure to avoid blocking large ENDS0 replies. This can in some cases block\nup to 50 percent of the attack volume when dealing with fragmented attack traffic.\n\n- \u0007Attack traffic can be diverted to IDMSs but care must be taken to not divert\ntoo large a chunk of the attack traffic. The total traffic (both legitimate and\nattack traffic) can be quite large when entire network blocks are diverted.\n\n###### DIVERSIFIED ATTACK PORTFOLIOS\n\nEverybody knows the benefits of a diversified stock portfolio — it minimizes risk\n\nwhile providing more than one revenue-generating avenue. The same principle can\napply to DDoS attacks, and it seems that many in the Booter/Stresser community are\ndoing just that. We saw a significant increase in both attack volume and size across\na slew of less widely used attack types, as it appears that attackers branched out\nfrom the usual culprits like DNS, NTP, and Chargen (Figure 10). Nine out of 14 attack\ntypes showed a significant increase in number of attacks. The number of mDNS\namplification attacks, for example, rose 233 percent, while the maximum size attack\nincreased from 8.28 Gbps to 186 Gbps. At the same time the aforementioned attacks\nall declined in both attack numbers and max size. However, SSDP, another perennial\nfavorite, bucked the decline tide with a 55 percent growth in numbers. That could\nwell be due to the arrival of a new class of SSDP attack discovered by ASERT in 2018.[1]\nAll told, this looks to us like a case of a growing community of professional DDoS-forhire services finding ways to minimize risk and optimize ROI.\n\n\n###### 233%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Reflection Amplification Stats\n\n ATTACK TYPE 2017 2H 2018 2H 2017 2H Attack Size 2018 2H Attack Size\n\n DNS Amplification 307,810 251,355 529 Gbps 388 Gbps\n\n NTP Amplification 235,550 206,586 529 Gbps 260 Gbps\n\n SSDP Amplification 51,501 79,960 528 Gbps 287 Gbps\n\n Chargen Amplification 47,223 22,150 157 Gbps 128 Gbps\n\n TCP SYN/ACK Amplification 1,546 21,628 77.9 Gbps 156 Gbps\n\n SNMP Amplification 13,293 18,523 158 Gbps 210 Gbps\n\n rpcbind Amplification 640 9,011 53.3 Gbps 121 Gbps\n\n memcached Amplification 3,700 5,125 43.9 Gbps 245 Gbps\n\n mDNS Amplification 485 1,616 8.28 Gbps 186 Gbps\n\n MS SQL RS Amplification 437 1,593 105 Gbps 75.8 Gbps\n\n NetBIOS Amplification 51 856 24.4 Gbps 121 Gbps\n\n RIPv1 Amplification 68 293 21.2 Gbps 64.7 Gbps\n\n TOTALS 658,651 716,437\n\n_Figure 10: Reflection Amplification Stats_\n\n###### CRACKDOWN ON CYBERCRIME\n\nAfter posting research on MedusaHTTP DDoS, a botnet from a hacker\nknown as stevenkings,[13] the ASERT team was able to assist the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI) during an investigation that ultimately\nled to charges being filed.[14] Such collaborative cybercrime-fighting\nefforts are on the rise.

This will also rely on collaboration with private sector\ninformation security professionals such as the ASERT team.\n\n|ATTACK TYPE|2017 2H|2018 2H|2017 2H Attack Size|2018 2H Attack Size|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|DNS Amplification|307,810|251,355|529 Gbps|388 Gbps|\n|NTP Amplification|235,550|206,586|529 Gbps|260 Gbps|\n|SSDP Amplification|51,501|79,960|528 Gbps|287 Gbps|\n|Chargen Amplification|47,223|22,150|157 Gbps|128 Gbps|\n|TCP SYN/ACK Amplification|1,546|21,628|77.9 Gbps|156 Gbps|\n|SNMP Amplification|13,293|18,523|158 Gbps|210 Gbps|\n|rpcbind Amplification|640|9,011|53.3 Gbps|121 Gbps|\n|memcached Amplification|3,700|5,125|43.9 Gbps|245 Gbps|\n|mDNS Amplification|485|1,616|8.28 Gbps|186 Gbps|\n|MS SQL RS Amplification|437|1,593|105 Gbps|75.8 Gbps|\n|NetBIOS Amplification|51|856|24.4 Gbps|121 Gbps|\n|RIPv1 Amplification|68|293|21.2 Gbps|64.7 Gbps|\n|TOTALS|658,651|716,437|||\n\n\n24.4 Gbps 121 Gbps\n\n21.2 Gbps 64.7 Gbps\n\n###### The ASERT team was able to assist the FBI during an investigation that ultimately led to charges being filed against a hacker known as stevenkings.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CONCLUSION\n\n\n###### The overall threat landscape\n\n is simultaneously lawless \n\n and frighteningly efficient.\n\n In the second half of\n\n 2018, we saw threat actors\n\n building crimeware that was\n\n cheaper and easier to deploy\n and more persistent once\n\n installed. At the same time,\n\n many groups applied business\n\n best practices that further\n\n extended the reach of\n\n attacks, while making it even\n\n easier for their customers\n\n to access and leverage\n\n malicious software and \n\n DDoS attack tools.\n\n\nMeanwhile, nation-state APT groups continued to proliferate across\nthe globe, attacking financial institutions, governments, academia, and\ntelecommunications companies, just for starters. Capable of affecting\nnational elections and crippling online access, the threat posed by these\ngroups increased daily.\n\nMoreover, these groups attacked across the entire threat spectrum, as\nattackers took advantage of increasingly effective tools and techniques\nand an ever-lower barrier to entry. Attack vectors that were once confined\nto sophisticated actors are now available from attackers for hire, widening\ntheir reach and ability to damage private and public sector organizations.\nActors that once relied on closely guarded custom tools became just as\nefficient \"living off the land.\" And these attacks generally increased in size,\nas bad actors of all types unleashed attacks that often involved hundreds of\nthousands — or even millions — of victims who largely served to amplify the\nattack or ended up as collateral damage. And in the strategic sphere, those\nlarge-scale campaigns were often aimed at highly selected targets.\n\nFurther, the internet-scale paradigm changed the frontiers for where attacks\ncan be launched, observed, and interdicted. Global threats will require global\ninterventions, involving enterprises, service providers, and governments.\n\nThis is an enormously complex scenario and solving it will involve\ncoordinated efforts across the public and private sector on a global scale.\nOrganizations must also regularly evaluate and update security technologies\nand techniques. The ASERT team will continue to monitor the threat\nlandscape and report on new groups and malware under development,\nas well as updated techniques. Although it is difficult to be fully prepared\nfor any incoming threat, regular consumption and application of threat\nintelligence is an important preparatory safeguard, as doing so provides\ninsight to inform both strategic direction and areas to address technically.\n\n\nMeanwhile, nation-state APT groups continued to proliferate across\nthe globe, attacking financial institutions, governments, academia, and\ntelecommunications companies, just for starters.
