To read the_**\n_[entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.](https://go.recordedfuture.com/redecho-insikt-group-report)_\n\n_This report details a campaign conducted by a China-linked threat activity_\n_group, RedEcho, targeting the Indian power sector. The activity was identified_\n_through a combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and_\n_expert analysis. Data sources include the Recorded Future Platform,_\n_SecurityTrails, Spur, Farsight, and common open-source tools and techniques._\n_The report will be of most interest to individuals engaged in strategic and_\n_operational intelligence relating to Indian and Chinese activity in cyberspace._\n\nRecorded Future notified the appropriate Indian government departments prior\nto publication of the suspected intrusions to support incident response and\nremediation investigations within the impacted organizations.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nRelations between India and China have deteriorated significantly following\n[border clashes in May 2020 that resulted in the first combat deaths in 45 years](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53061476)\nbetween the world’s two most populous nations. As a result, on January 12,\n[2021, India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar announced that trust](https://www.reuters.com/article/india-foreign-minister-idUSKBN29H0YZ)\n\n\n-----\n\nbetween India and China was profoundly disturbed. While diplomacy and\neconomic factors have been effective in preventing a full-blown war, notable\n[most recently with the bilateral disengagement at the border, cyber operations](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-china-ladakh-disengagement-pangong-tso-explained-7184040/)\ncontinue to provide countries with a potent asymmetric capability to conduct\nespionage or pre-position within networks for potentially disruptive reasons.\n\nSince early 2020, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group observed a large increase in\nsuspected targeted intrusion activity against Indian organizations from Chinese\nstate-sponsored groups. From mid-2020 onwards, Recorded Future’s midpoint\ncollection revealed a steep rise in the use of infrastructure tracked as\nAXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, which encompasses ShadowPad command and\ncontrol (C2) servers, to target a large swathe of India’s power sector. 10 distinct\nIndian power sector organizations, including 4 of the 5 Regional Load Despatch\nCentres (RLDC) responsible for operation of the power grid through balancing\nelectricity supply and demand, have been identified as targets in a concerted\ncampaign against India’s critical infrastructure. Other targets identified included\n2 Indian seaports.\n\nUsing a combination of proactive adversary infrastructure detections, domain\nanalysis, and Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis, we have determined\nthat a subset of these AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers share some common\ninfrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with several\n[previously reported Chinese state-sponsored groups, including APT41 and](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/apt-41-group)\nTonto Team.\n\nDespite some overlaps with previous groups, Insikt Group does not currently\nbelieve there is enough evidence to firmly attribute the activity in this particular\ncampaign to an existing public group and therefore continue to track it as a\nclosely related but distinct activity group, RedEcho.\n\n## Key Judgements\n\nThe targeting of Indian critical infrastructure offers limited economic\nespionage opportunities; however, we assess they pose significant\nconcerns over potential pre-positioning of network access to support\nChinese strategic objectives.\nPre-positioning on energy assets may support several potential\noutcomes, including geo-strategic signaling during heightened bilateral\ntensions, supporting influence operations, or as a precursor to kinetic\nescalation.\nRedEcho has strong infrastructure and victimology overlaps with Chinese\ngroups APT41/Barium and Tonto Team, while ShadowPad is used by at\nleast 5 distinct Chinese groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe high concentration of IPs resolving to Indian critical infrastructure\nentities communicating over several months with a distinct subset of\nAXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers used by RedEcho indicate a targeted\ncampaign, with little evidence of wider targeting in Recorded Future’s\nnetwork telemetry.\n\n**_Editor’s Note: This post was an excerpt of a full report.
