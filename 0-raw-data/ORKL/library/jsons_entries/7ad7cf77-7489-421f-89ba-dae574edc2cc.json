From an image and a list of folders shared with\nBleepingComputer by the attackers, it does look like files were stolen from the county.\n\n[Local media reports that Lasalle County has no plans on paying the ransom.](http://www.wspynews.com/news/local/lasalle-county-government-continuing-to-battle-apparent-ransomware-issues/article_0145e2a2-5741-11ea-8d07-47ff578191a7.html)\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Lasalle County via email for confirmation but the emails\nwere rejected. We have also left a voicemail but have not heard back at this time.\n\n**[Update 3/3/2020 8:19 AM: PwndLocker has also encrypted the network for the City of Novi](https://www.021.rs/story/Novi-Sad/Vesti/235654/Blokirani-serveri-novosadskih-sluzbi-hakeri-traze-bitkoine-da-bi-otkljucali-vredne-baze-podataka.html)**\nSad in Serbia.\n**Update 3/3/2020 7:18 PM: PwndLocker shared an image and a list of folders that they say**\nwere stolen from Lasalle County.\n\n## The PwndLocker Ransomware\n\n[In a sample shared with BleepingComputer by MalwareHunterTeam, when](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nexecuted PwndLocker will attempt to disable a variety of Windows services using the 'net\nstop' command so that their data can be encrypted.\n\nSome of the applications whose services are targeted include Veeam, Microsoft SQL\nServer, MySQL, Exchange, Acronis, Zoolz, Backup Exec, Oracle, Internet Information\nServer (IIS), and security software such as Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, Sophos, and McAfee.\n\nThe ransomware will also target various processes and terminate them if detected. Some of\nthe processes targeted include Firefox, Word, Excel, Access, and other processes related\nto security software, backup applications, and database servers.\n\nPwndLocker will now clear the Shadow Volume Copies so that they cannot be used to\nrecover files with the following commands:\n```\nvssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=D: /on=D: /maxsize=401MB\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=D: /on=D: /maxsize=unbounded\n\n```\nOnce the system has been prepped for encryption, PwndLocker will begin to encrypt the\ncomputer.\n\nWhile encrypting files, it will skip any files that contain one of the following extensions.\n```\n.exe, .dll, .lnk, .ico, .ini, .msi, .chm, .sys, .hlf, .lng, .inf, .ttf, .cmd, .bat,\n.vhd, .bac, .bak, .wbc, .bkf, .set, .win, .dsk\n\n```\nThe ransomware will also skip all files located in the following folders:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$Recycle.Bin\nWindows\nSystem Volume Information\nPerfLogs\nCommon Files\nDVD Maker\nInternet Explorer\nKaspersky Lab\nKaspersky Lab Setup Files\nWindowsPowerShell\nMicrosoft\nMicrosoft.NET\nMozilla Firefox\nMSBuild\nWindows Defender\nWindows Mail\nWindows Media Player\nWindows NT\nWindows Photo Viewer\nWindows Portable Devices\nWindows Sidebar\nWindowsApps\nAll Users\nUninstall Information\nMicrosoft\nAdobe\nMicrosoft\nMicrosoft_Corporation\nPackages\nTemp\n\n```\nWhen encrypting files, MalwareHunterTeam has seen it using the .key and .pwnd\nextensions depending on the victim. The sample BleepingComputer analyzed uses the .key\nextension as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Files encrypted by PwndLocker**\nWhen done encrypting, ransom notes named H0w_T0_Rec0very_Files.txt will be located\nthroughout the computer and on the Windows desktop.\n\nThese ransom notes will contain an email address and Tor payment site that can be used to\nget payment instructions and the ransom amount.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PwndLocker Ransom Note**\nThe PwndLocker Payment Site allows victims to decrypt two files for free, talk to the\nransomware operators and contains the ransom amount in bitcoins.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PwndLocker Tor Payment Site**\nIt is not known at this time if there are any weaknesses in the encryption algorithm.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Known Extensions:\n```\n.key\n.pwnd\n\n Associated Files:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nH0w_T0_Rec0very_Files.txt\nC:\\Programdata\\lock.xml\n\n### Ransom Note Text:\nYour network have been penetrated and encrypted with a strong algorythm\nBackups were either removed or encrypted\nNo one can help you to recover the network except us\nDo not share this link or email.
