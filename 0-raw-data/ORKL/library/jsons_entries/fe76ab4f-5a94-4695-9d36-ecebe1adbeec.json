To find a\n_walkthrough of Remcos executed via Splunk's Attack Range Local, check out part 2,_\n**_[Detecting Remcos Tool Used by FIN7 with Splunk.](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/splunk-fin7-tool-detections-remcos.html)_**\n\n\n-----\n\nFIN7 is a well-organized criminal group composed of highly-skilled individuals that target\nfinancial institutions, hospitality, restaurant, and gambling industries. Until recently, it was\nknown that high-level individuals of this criminal enterprise were arrested — specifically 3 of\nthem — and extradited to the United States.\n\nThis criminal group performed highly technical malicious campaigns which included\neffective compromise, exfiltration and fraud using stolen payment cards. Another heist\nrelated to the history of this group and actors includes withdrawing money from ATMs,\nbypassing all controls as seen in the video linked below.\n\n_[Source: Mario Mazzochi ATM Carbanak Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083s802WMw0)_\n\nCarbanak and FIN7 are usually referred to as the same group, although some security\nresearchers believe they might be two groups using the same malware and should be\ntracked separately. Without delving deeper into the assumptions of being two different\ngroups, however, we can take a look at their tools which is what we can measure via\npayload samples and research from the community.\n\n\n-----\n\nFIN7 is a particular group highly specialized in targeting specific verticals. These individuals\ncarefully and thoroughly pretexted and pursued their victims in some cases to establish\nrapport via conversations in order to lure their victims into clicking on their malicious\npayloads.\n\n_Source:_ _[DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1084581/download)_\n\n[According to the Department of Justice, FIN7 group stole approximately 15 million cards in](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1084596/download)\nthe United States. This group was significantly successful in its criminal enterprise,\nincluding the creation of an apparent Information Security Technology company where they\nkept track of their victims using off-the-shelf software like Atlassian JIRA.\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to the notoriety, extent and sophistication of this group and the tools they use, we are\ngoing to particularly focus on FIN7 tools, techniques and procedures. Recently, a specific\ntool which is a signature of this group known as the JSS loader has apparently resurfaced,\n[indicated by reports from some security research sites and mentioned in some security](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/jssloader-recoded-and-reloaded)\npublications.\n\nBased on previous arrests of what was thought to be some of the main characters of this\norganization, we need to ask ourselves: is this a splinter from a former group trying to get\nbusiness back online, or is this a copycat using the former tools, rewriting them and even\nattempting to reuse former infrastructure from past campaigns? Or basically, the group was\nindeed not affected by arrests and decided to lay low and then reappear as reported\n[recently by Recorded Future.](https://geminiadvisory.io/fin7-ransomware-bastion-secure/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=wfMw07NrLQx2J4GEcAgOHxr4m48a0HQgImZ5fUKCZcE-1636316392-0-gaNycGzNCOU)\n\nWe do not have enough information to respond to the above questions, however, we can\nprepare ourselves to defend against this group by looking at their tools.\n\nIn this two-part blog we are going to address two tools used by this group — JSS Loader\nand Remcos.\n\n## FIN7 Javascript\n\nFIN7 is well known to use a spear-phishing campaign to compromise a machine by\ndownloading or executing an obfuscated javascript as the first stage. We analyze old and\nthe latest script found in the wild to summarize all possible behavior it may execute in the\ntargeted machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Javascript Execution Using .XSL File\n\nOne interesting behavior we saw in one of these variants is how it executes the malicious\njavascript. First it will create a copy of legitimate wmic.exe in “user\\public” folder, as well as\nthe .xsl file that will be executed using command “wmic os get /format:”<malicious>.xsl”.\nThen the .xsl will execute the actual malicious javascript in the .txt file extension. Below is\nthe screenshot of that .XSL file.\n\nWe can also see how it uses the cscript.exe application to execute the malicious javascript\nby using the command “cscript //e:jscript ibivigi.txt”.\n\nThis JS is capable of gathering information to the compromised host by executing several\nWMI query commands. Below is the WMI query we saw during our analysis.\n\n**WMI Query and Shell CMD** **Information It Gather and Checks**\n\n\nselect * from\nWin32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration where\nipenabled = true\n\n\nMACAddress, DNSHostName\n\n\nSELECT * FROM Win32_BIOS SMBIOSBIOSVersion, BIOS\nSerialNumber, check virtualization\n\nWin32_process.Handle Process Handle\n\ncmd /c whoami /groups | find \"12288\" Check elevated privilege cmd instance\n\n\n-----\n\nSelect * from Win32_ComputerSystem Check if part of the domain, PC model,\nDNS hostname\n\nselect * from Win32_DesktopMonitor Check Screen size, and Monitor Type\n\nselect * from win32_process Enumerate process, check virtualization\n\nAside from the table above, it queries wmi “Win32_OperatingSystem” to check several\nitems like in the screenshot below.\n\nIt checks if the host has an enabled UAC by querying the “EnableLua” Registry and saves\nthe output as part of its data gathering.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt will also try to gather AD information by running ActiveXObject “ADSystemInfo” to check if\nthe host is part of the domain or not.\n\n### Data Exfiltration\n\nAfter gathering all that information, it will be encrypted and sent to its C2 server using the\nHTTP POST Request command.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also found some variants where it uses DNS exfiltration of data. With this feature, it will\nencrypt first all the gathered data, encode it to base64, then query the C2 DNS server using\nnslookup application with the encoded data to it. The command is shown in the figure\nbelow.\n\n## JSSLoader\n\nFIN7 also has some binary backdoor tools that will do a collection of data from the\ncompromised host and send it to its C2 server. Some variants of JSSloader are compiled to\n.NET and some are in C++.\n\n### C2 Server Communication\n\nIn both JSSloader samples, we've seen that it is capable of communicating to its C2 server\nto request for commands and exfiltrate collected data from the compromised machine.\nBelow is the user-agent it uses in those samples:\n\n\n-----\n\n_.NET compiled of JSSloader_\n\n_JSSloader compiled C++_\n\n### Collection of Data\n\nLike the obfuscated JScript it is also capable of collecting data by using WMI query in\n“Win32_ComputerSystem”, “Win32_Product” and “Win32_Process”.\n\nAdditionally, both variants have a function that will list all the files on the desktop of the\ncompromised host that will also send to its C2 server.\n\n_JSSloader Compiled .NET_\n\n\n-----\n\n_C++ compiled JSSloader_\n\nThere is also a feature in the .net version of JSSloader where it runs Windows commandline tools like ipconfig.exe and systeminfo.exe then pipe the output to another function that\ncollects and exfiltrates data.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Taking a Screenshot\n\nAnother feature identified is taking a screenshot of the compromised host. The screenshot\nimage will not be dropped on the disk; rather, it will be saved in a memory stream that will\nbe encoded to base64 and sent to its C2 server.\n\n### Parsing Browser Databases\n\nIt also has some functions that parse the browser information like history and URL visits of\nusers in both Chrome and Firefox applications. This is done by accessing the SQLite\ndatabase of those browsers and executing SQL queries to its database.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Parsing Chrome history_\n\n_Parsing Firefox URL visited_\n\n##
