    "plain_text": "# Part 3: analysing MedusaLocker ransomware\n\n**[theta.co.nz/news-blogs/cyber-security-blog/part-3-analysing-medusalocker-ransomware/](https://www.theta.co.nz/news-blogs/cyber-security-blog/part-3-analysing-medusalocker-ransomware/)**\n\n06/08/2020\n\n(Part 3 of 3) In this 3-part post, we share the tradecraft from an RDP brute force linked\nransomware event (MedusaLocker) we responded to in June 2020. We cover the business\nramifications of the attack, technical analysis and some advice based on attacks such as\nthese.\n\n_[Continued from parts 1 and](https://www.theta.co.nz/news-blogs/cyber-security-blog/part-1-analysing-medusalocker-ransomware/)_ _[2...](https://www.theta.co.nz/news-blogs/cyber-security-blog/part-2-analysing-medusalocker-ransomware/)_\n\n## ATT&CK Map\n\nWe have mapped the TTPs of this adversary to the MITRE ATT&CK framework as a\nheatmap of activity. We can see that this adversary used a limited, but powerful, selection of\nTTPs.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Access PNG of image above.](https://www.theta.co.nz/media/3966/medusa_locker_ttps__june_2020_-1.png)_\n\nUnfortunately, we’re seeing the same TTPs being used over and over again for ransomware\nattacks, even if the initial access or lateral movement exploits vary.\n\nWe keep getting asked by customers to “tell us what we don’t know about our\nvulnerabilities”. While the use of traditional defensive frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST or\nPCI serve a compliance function, thinking like an attacker can rapidly highlight blind spots in\nyour environment.\n\nPhishing attacks are a nuisance but largely a means to an end for adversaries and won’t put\nyou out of business on their own. A ransomware attack will lose reputation, money and\ncustomers.\n\nNever mind encrypting user workstations or file shares - destroying ERP and EDI systems\n(as happened here) will leave an organisation completely unable to trade and haemorrhaging\nmoney. That’s not counting the cost of restoring business systems, which is incredibly labourintensive, let alone the underlying IT infrastructure and the other parts of the Incident\nResponse process, or the intangibles like the reputational damage.\n\n\n-----\n\nWithout enough cash reserves or insurance coverage, there s a real chance of even\nmedium-sized business ending up underwater depending on time-to-recovery and the bill at\nthe end. You might be tempted to just pay the ransom – but this isn’t a great option either as\nthere’s no guarantee you’ll get what you paid for. You still need to run through the IR\n(Incident Response) process to find the intruders and kick them out of your network.\n\nWe should also pause and take note of the human cost of these operations – they are brutal.\nThe toll they take on those who suffer them is worse than intelligence motivated intrusions\nwhere “damage” is a more abstract concept. There is often a massive time crunch to restore\nsystems at the expense of well-planned incident response process.\n\n## Indicators Annex\n\n**Strange Fruit**\n\nSeveral additional folders and files were deployed by the actor.\n\nThe following 4 deleted files were able to be recovered from the filesystem of the server with\ntimestamps and other metadata suggesting they are associated with the actor.
