Famous for\n[stealing scripts from HBO’s Game of Thrones in 2017 and suspected of interfering in the](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/)\nU.S. presidential election last year, it has launched extensive campaigns against\norganizations and officials across North America and the Middle East. Public attribution has\n[associated APT35 with an Iran-based nation state threat actor.](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/apt-35)\n\n[Darktrace regularly detects attacks by many known threat actors including Evil Corp and](http://10.10.0.46/blog/evil-corp-intrusions-wasted-locker-ransomware-detected-by-darktrace)\n[APT41, alongside large amounts of malicious but uncategorized activity from sophisticated](http://10.10.0.46/blog/catching-apt-41-exploiting-a-zero-day-vulnerability)\nattack groups. As [Cyber AI doesn’t rely on pre-defined rules, signatures, or threat](http://10.10.0.46/cyber-ai)\nintelligence to detect cyber-attacks, it often detects new and previously unknown threats.\n\nThis blog post examines a real-world instance of APT35 activity in an organization in the\nEMEA region. Darktrace observed this activity last June, but due to ongoing investigations,\ndetails are only now being released with the wider community. It represents an interesting\ncase for the value of self-learning AI in two key ways:\n\n**Identifying ‘low and slow’ attacks: How do you spot an attacker that is lying low and**\nconducts very little detectable activity?\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detecting pre-existing infections without signatures: What if a threat actor is**\nalready inside the system when Cyber AI is activated?\n\n## Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) lying low\n\nAPT35 had already infected a single corporate device, likely via a spear phishing email,\nwhen Cyber AI was deployed in the company’s digital estate for the first time.\n\nThe infected device exhibited no other signs of malicious activity beyond continued\ncommand and control (C2) beaconing, awaiting instructions from the attackers for several\ndays. This is what we call ‘lying low’ – where the hacker stays present within a system, but\nremains under the radar, avoiding detection either intentionally, or because they’re focusing\non another victim while being content with backdoor access into the organization.\n\nEither way, this is a nightmare scenario for a security team and any security vendor: an APT\nwhich has established a foothold and is lying in wait to continue their attack – undetected.\n\n## Finding the infected device\n\nWhen Darktrace’s AI was first activated, it spent five business days learning the unique\n‘patterns of life’ for the organization. After this initial, short learning period, Darktrace\nimmediately flagged the infected device and the C2 activity.\n\nAlthough the breach device had been beaconing since before Darktrace was implemented,\nCyber AI automatically clusters devices into ‘peer groups’ based on similar behavioral\npatterns, enabling Darktrace to identify the continued C2 traffic coming from the device as\nhighly unusual in comparison to the wider, automatically identified peer group. None of its\nbehaviorally close neighbors were doing anything remotely similar, and Darktrace was\ntherefore able to determine that the activity was malicious, and that it represented C2\nbeaconing.\n\nDarktrace detected the APT35 C2 activity without the use of any signatures or threat\nintelligence on multiple levels. Responding to the alerts, the internal security team quickly\nisolated the device and verified with the Darktrace system that no further reconnaissance,\nlateral movement, or data exfiltration had taken place.\n\n## APT35 ‘Charming Kitten’ analysis\n\nOnce the C2 was detected, [Cyber AI Analyst immediately began analyzing the infected](http://10.10.0.46/cyber-ai-analyst)\ndevice. The Cyber AI Analyst only highlights the most severe incidents in any given\nenvironment and automates many of the typical level one and level two SOC tasks. This\nincludes reviewing all alerts, investigating the scope and nature of each event, and reducing\ntime to triage by 92%.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Similar Cyber AI Analyst report observing C2 communications\n\nNumerous factors made the C2 activity stand out strongly to Darktrace. Combining all those\nsmall anomalies, Darktrace was able to autonomously prioritize this behavior and classify it\nas the most significant security incident in the week.\n\nFigure 2: Example list of C2 detections for an APT35 attack\n\nSome of the command and control destinations were known to threat intelligence and opensource intelligence (OSINT) – for instance, the domain cortanaservice[.]com is a known C2\ndomain for APT35.\n\nHowever, the presence of a known malicious domain does not guarantee detection. In fact,\nthe organization had a very mature security stack, yet they failed to discover the existing\nAPT35 infection until Darktrace was activated in their environment.\n\n## Assessing the impact of the intrusion\n\nOnce an intrusion has been identified, it is important to understand the extent of it – such as\nwhether lateral movement is occurring and what connectivity the infected device has in\ngeneral. Asset management is never perfect, so it can be very hard for organizations to\ndetermine what damage a compromised device is capable of inflicting.\n\nDarktrace presents this information in real time, and from a bird’s-eye perspective, making\nthe assessment very simple. It immediately highlights which subnet the device is located in\nand any further context.\n\nFigure 3: Darktrace’s Threat Visualizer displaying the connectivity of a device\n\nBased on this information, the organization confirmed that it was a corporate device that had\nbeen infected by APT35. As Darktrace shows any credentials associated with the device, a\nquick assessment could be made of potentially compromised accounts.\n\nFigure 4: Similar and associated credentials of a device\n\nLuckily, only a single local user account was associated with the device.\n\nThe exact level of privileges and connectivity which the infected device had, as well as the\nextent to which the intrusion might have spread from the initially infected device, was still\nuncertain. By looking at the device’s event log, this became rapidly clear within minutes.\n\nFiltering first for internal connections only (excluding any connections going to the Internet)\ngave a good idea of the level of connectivity of the device. A cursory glance showed that the\ndevice did indeed have some level of internal connectivity. It made DNS requests to the\n\n\n-----\n\ninternal domain controller and was making successful NetBIOS connections over ports 135\nand 139 internally.\n\nBy filtering further in the event log, it quickly became clear that in this time the device had not\nused any administrative channels, such as RDP, SSH, Telnet, or SMB. This is a strong\nindicator that no lateral movement over common channels had taken place.\n\nIt is more difficult to assess whether the device was performing any other suspicious activity,\nlike stealthy reconnaissance or staging data from other internal devices. Darktrace provided\nanother capability to assess this quickly – filtering the device’s network connections to show\nonly unusual or new connections.\n\nFigure 5: Event device log filtered to show unusual connections only\n\nDarktrace assesses each individual connection for every entity observed in context, using its\nunsupervised machine learning to evaluate how unusual a given connection is. This could be\na single new failed internal connection attempt, indicating stealthy reconnaissance, or a\nconnection over SMB at an unusual time to a new internal destination, implying lateral\nmovement or data staging.\n\nBy filtering for only unusual or new connections, Darktrace’s AI produces further leads that\ncan be pursued extremely quickly, thanks to the context and added visibility.\n\nNo further suspicious internal connections were observed, strengthening the hypothesis that\nAPT35 was lying low at that time.\n\n## Unprecedented but not unpreventable\n\nDarktrace’s 24/7 monitoring service, Proactive Threat Notifications, would have alerted on\n[and escalated the incident. Darktrace Antigena would have responded autonomously and](http://10.10.0.46/network)\nenforced normal activity for the device, preventing the C2 traffic without interrupting regular\nbusiness workflows.\n\nIt is impossible to predefine where the next attack will come from. APT35 is just one of the\nmany sophisticated threat actors on the scene, and with such a diverse and volatile threat\nlandscape, unsupervised machine learning is crucial in spotting and defending against\nanomalies, no matter what form they take.\n\nThis case study helps illustrate how Darktrace detects pre-existing infections and ‘low and\nslow’ attacks, and further shows how Darktrace can be used to quickly understand the scope\nand extent of an intrusion.\n\n[Learn how Cyber AI Analyst detected APT41 two weeks before public attribution](http://10.10.0.46/blog/catching-apt-41-exploiting-a-zero-day-vulnerability)\n\n**Shortened list of C2 detections over four days on the infected device:**\n\n\n-----\n\nCompromise / Sustained TCP Beaconing Activity To Rare Endpoint\nCompromise / Beaconing Meta Model\nCompromise / Beaconing Activity To External Rare\nCompromise / SSL Beaconing To Rare Destination\nCompromise / Slow Beaconing To External Rare\nCompromise / High Volume of Connections with Beacon Score\nCompromise / Unusual Connections to Rare Lets Encrypt\nCompromise / Beacon for 4 Days\nCompromise / Agent Beacon\n\n**Observed C2 destinations:**\n\nCortanaservice[.]com, port 443, beacon intervals at 100 seconds\n\n## Max Heinemeyer\n\nMax is a cyber security expert with over a decade of experience in the field, specializing in a\nwide range of areas such as Penetration Testing, Red-Teaming, SIEM and SOC consulting\nand hunting Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups.
