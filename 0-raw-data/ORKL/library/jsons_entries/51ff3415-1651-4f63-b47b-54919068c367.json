The campaigns delivered PupyRAT, an open-source](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy)\ncross-platform remote access trojan (RAT). CTU™ researchers observed likely unsuccessful\nphishing campaigns being followed by highly targeted spearphishing and social engineering\nattacks from a threat actor using the name Mia Ash. Further analysis revealed a wellestablished collection of fake social media profiles that appear intended to build trust and\nrapport with potential victims. The connections associated with these profiles indicate the\nthreat actor began using the persona to target organizations in April 2016.\n\nCTU researchers assess that COBALT GYPSY (formerly known as [TG-2889), a threat group](https://www.secureworks.com/research/suspected-iran-based-hacker-group-creates-network-of-fake-linkedin-profiles)\nassociated with Iranian government-directed cyber operations, is likely responsible for these\ncampaigns and the Mia Ash persona. COBALT GYPSY has used spearphishing to target\ntelecommunications, government, defense, oil, and financial services organizations based in\nor affiliated with the MENA region, identifying individual victims through social media sites.\n\n## Key points\n\nCTU researchers assess it highly likely that the Mia Ash persona is a fake identity used\nto perform reconnaissance on and establish relationships with employees of targeted\norganizations.\nBased on perceived targeting, observed victims, and tactics used in this campaign,\nCTU researchers consider it likely that the COBALT GYPSY threat group manages the\nMia Ash persona.\nCOBALT GYPSY uses well-established social media personas and correspondence via\nmultiple platforms to establish rapport with victims.\nValidating a user's authenticity prior to accepting social media connection requests can\nmitigate threats posed by threat actors leveraging fake personas.\n\n## Observed activity\n\nBetween December 28, 2016 and January 1, 2017, CTU researchers observed a phishing\ncampaign targeting Middle Eastern organizations. The emails used various themes, but they\nall contained shortened URLs leading to a macro-enabled Word document. The macro ran a\nPowerShell command that attempted to download additional PowerShell loader scripts for\nPupyRAT, a research and penetration-testing tool that has been used in attacks. If installed,\nPupyRAT gives the threat actor full access to the victim's system.\n\nOn January 13, 2017, the purported London-based photographer \"Mia Ash\" used LinkedIn to\ncontact an employee at one of the targeted organizations, stating that the inquiry was part of\nan exercise to reach out to people around the world. Over the next several days, the\nindividuals exchanged messages about their professions photography and travels\n\n\n-----\n\nSometime before January 21, Mia encouraged the employee to add her as a friend on\nFacebook and continue their conversation there, noting that it was her preferred\ncommunication method. The correspondence continued via email, WhatsApp, and likely\nFacebook until February 12, when Mia sent a Microsoft Excel document, \"Copy of\nPhotography Survey.xlsm,\" to the employee's personal email account. Mia encouraged the\nvictim to open the email at work using their corporate email account so the survey would\nfunction properly. The survey contained macros that, once enabled, downloaded PupyRAT.\n\nCTU researchers determined that the COBALT GYPSY threat group orchestrated this activity\ndue to the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in both campaigns. The group has\nrepeatedly used social media, particularly LinkedIn, to identify and interact with employees at\ntargeted organizations, and then used weaponized Excel documents to deliver RATs such as\nPupyRAT. The threat actors likely leveraged the Mia Ash persona to gain access to the\ntargeted organization because the initial phishing campaign was unsuccessful.\n\n## \"Mia Ash\" persona\n\nCTU researchers consider it highly likely that Mia Ash is a fake persona. It is associated with\nLinkedIn, Facebook, Blogger, and WhatsApp accounts, as well as several email addresses.\nA timeline of Mia Ash activity and correspondence indicates the persona was established in\nApril 2016 or earlier (see Appendix B). CTU analysis of these accounts revealed that most of\nthe supporting material and content in the profiles originated from other sources.\n\n### Job description\n\nMia Ash's LinkedIn page contains a description of employment at Mia's Photography that is\nalmost identical to a job description posted on the LinkedIn account of a U.S.-based\nphotographer (see Figure 1). It is highly likely that the threat actor copied the job description\nfrom the legitimate profile.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Comparison of Mia Ash job description (top) to legitimate user's job description_\n_(bottom). (Source: LinkedIn)_\n\n### Images\n\nImages of \"Mia Ash\" were consistent across the various accounts and profiles. They were\nlikely taken from several social media accounts belonging to a Romanian photographer (see\nAppendix C). For example, the profile photograph used on the Mia Ash LinkedIn page is\nidentical to a photograph uploaded on October 22, 2016 to the bittersweetvenom24\nInstagram account, which is likely owned by the legitimate photographer. On October 30, the\nsame photograph was uploaded to the Mia Ash Facebook account (see Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. The same image appears on the Mia Ash LinkedIn page (top) (Source: LinkedIn),_\n_bittersweetvenom24's Instagram account (middle) (Source:_\n_https://www.instagram.com/bittersweetvenom24/), and Mia Ash's Facebook account (bottom)_\n_(Source: Facebook)._\n\nIn another example, the first image uploaded to Mia Ash's Blogger site on April 2, 2016 also\nappears on the photographer's DeviantArt site (bittersweetvenom) (see Figure 3). The text\nfor all of the blog posts are quotes copied from various sources. The threat actor likely\n\n\n-----\n\ncreated the blog to make the Mia Ash persona seem more authentic.\n\n_Figure 3. Image from the photographer's DeviantArt site (top) compared to an image posted_\n_to the Mia's Photography Blogger site (bottom). (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\n## Attribution\n\nCTU researchers categorized connections associated with the Mia Ash LinkedIn profile into\nphotography versus non-photography profiles. Several of the LinkedIn connections matched\nnames of people associated with the Mia Ash Facebook page, which aligns with the threat\nactor's pattern of contacting individuals on LinkedIn and then encouraging them to move\ncommunications to Facebook. The threat actor likely used the photography connections to\nproject authenticity. The non-photography endorsers were located in Saudi Arabia, United\nStates Iraq Iran Israel India and Bangladesh (see Figure 4) and worked for technology\n\n\n-----\n\noil/gas, healthcare, aerospace, and consulting organizations. They were mid-level\nemployees in technical (mechanical and computer) or project management roles with job\ntitles such as technical support engineer, software developer, and system support. These job\ntitles imply elevated access within the corporate network. By compromising a user account\nthat has administrative or elevated access, threat actors can quickly access a targeted\nenvironment to achieve their objectives. The individuals' locations and industries align with\nprevious COBALT GYPSY targeting and Iranian ideological, political, and military intelligence\nobjectives. These characteristics suggest that COBALT GYPSY executed the January and\nFebruary phishing campaigns and that it created the Mia Ash persona.\n\n_Figure 4.

(Source:_\n_SecureWorks)_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCTU researchers have observed multiple COBALT GYPSY campaigns since 2015 and\nconsider it highly likely that the group is associated with Iranian government-directed cyber\noperations. This threat group has launched espionage campaigns against organizations that\nare of strategic, political, or economic importance to Iranian interests.\n\nThe use of the Mia Ash persona demonstrates the creativity and persistence that threat\nactors employ to compromise targets. CTU researchers conclude that COBALT GYPSY\ncreated the persona to gain unauthorized access to targeted computer networks via social\nengineering. It is likely one of many personas managed by the threat actor. The persistent\nuse of social media to identify and manipulate victims indicates that COBALT GYPSY\nsuccessfully achieves its objectives using this tactic.\n\nCOBALT GYPSY's continued social media use reinforces the importance of recurring social\nengineering training. Organizations must provide employees with clear social media\nguidance and instructions for reporting potential phishing messages received through\n\n\n-----\n\ncorporate email, personal email, and social media platforms. Guidance should include\nrecommendations for reporting inquiries by an unknown third party about an employer,\nbusiness systems, or the corporate network, or requests to perform actions such as opening\na document or visiting a website. CTU researchers recommend that organizations disable\nmacros in Microsoft Office products to mitigate the threat posed by weaponized Microsoft\n[Office documents. Organizations should also incorporate advanced malware prevention](https://www.secureworks.com/capabilities/managed-security/network-security/advanced-malware-protection)\n[technology and endpoint threat detection tools as part of their security strategies.](https://www.secureworks.com/capabilities/managed-security/endpoint-security/endpoint-threat-detection)\n\n## Appendix A — Identifying attribution\n\nIn most cases, CTU researchers do not have intelligence to directly attribute a threat group,\nso attribution relies on circumstantial evidence and is an assessment rather than a fact. CTU\nresearchers draw on three distinct intelligence bases for evidence of attribution:\n\nObserved activity is gathered from CTU researchers' observation and investigation of a\nthreat group's activity on a target network and across SecureWorks data, and analysis\nof tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) the threat group employs.\nThird-party intelligence is gained from trusted relationships within the security industry\nand with other private and public sector organizations, as well as analysis of open\nsource intelligence.\nContextual analysis compares threat group targets against intelligence requirements of\ngovernment agencies and other threat actors and compares tradecraft employed by a\nthreat group to tradecraft of known threat actors.\n\n## Appendix B — Sample activity for Mia Ash persona\n\nThe timeline in Figure 5 highlights sample activity involving the Mia Ash persona, including\nactivity associated with two victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Timeline of Mia Ash activity. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\n### Victim A\n\nVictim A has many social media accounts, and the profiles divulge numerous personal\ndetails. These accounts span multiple platforms; for example:\n\nIt is highly likely that Victim A is a legitimate user who operates these accounts. According to\nseveral of the profiles, Victim A has more than ten years of experience in industries such as\noil/gas, aviation, and telecommunications. Victim A's location, stated areas of expertise, and\nlisted job titles align with CTU analysis of COBALT GYPSY's interests and targets.\n\nCTU researchers are unclear why domains were registered using a combination of Mia Ash\nand Victim A's information. The following are possible explanations:\n\nVictim A registered a domain for Mia Ash as a gesture, and the threat actor\nreciprocated by registering a domain for Victim A to keep Victim A as an active\nunknown participant in the threat actor's operations.\nThe threat actor compromised Victim A's accounts.\nVictim A registered both domains as a romantic or friendly gesture.\nDomains were registered using fraudulent information.\nVictim A works for the threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nCTU researchers do not know what date Mia Ash and Victim A established contact, but the\ntimeline of associated activity indicates it was prior to the domain registrations in June 2016.\nThe CTU research team has limited visibility into communications between the individuals,\nbut they are likely in contact as of this publication.\n\n### Victim B\n\nVictim B received the February 12, 2017 phishing email containing the malicious Microsoft\nExcel document (see the Observed activity section).\n\n## Appendix C — The Photographer\n\nThe images used in the Mia Ash profile likely belong to a student and photographer whose\nDeviantArt profile indicates is based in Romania (see Figure 6). She has uploaded hundreds\nof photographs of herself to social media sites such as DeviantArt, Instagram, and\nFacebook, leading CTU researchers to conclude that she is who she claims to be and that\nthe photographs on the bittersweetvenom social media profiles are of her. The threat actors\noperating the Mia Ash persona likely stole images from the photographer's social media\naccounts to create Mia Ash's various accounts. CTU researchers attempted to contact the\nphotographer but have not received a response as of this publication.\n\n_Figure 6.
