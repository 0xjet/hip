In early 2020, CyCraft curtailed a year-long attack campaign targeting](https://medium.com/cycraft/taiwan-high-tech-ecosystem-targeted-by-foreign-apt-group-5473d2ad8730)\nTaiwan’s semiconductor ecosystem; this attack was attributed to another China-based threat\n[group, Chimera. Again, in April 2020, a CyCraft incident response (IR) investigation into a](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0114/)\n[government agency breach uncovered Waterbear malware — malware designed and](https://medium.com/cycraft/taiwan-government-targeted-by-multiple-cyberattacks-in-april-2020-1980acde92b0)\n[distributed by the China-based threat group BlackTech.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0098/)\n\n**The frequency of cyberattacks targeting Taiwan institutions surged by 38% in 2021,**\n[reaching an average of 2,644 attacks per week, Taiwan News reports. The global average is](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4416673)\n925 attacks per week. This disparity is due to Taiwan’s unique geopolitical situation, hightech economy, and mature communications infrastructure.\n\n## First Attack Wave, November 2021\n\n[At 5:27 p.m. on Thursday, November 25 of last year, a number of Taiwan financial institutions](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/202111260178.aspx)\nand securities traders informed the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TWSE) and the\nFinancial Supervisory Commission (FSC) that they would be suspending online transactions\ndue to suspicious behavior — large, unusual purchases of Hong Kong stocks on consumer\ntrading accounts — as a result of a cyberattack.\n\nAfter several weeks, the IR investigations theorized that the November attacks were most\nlikely due to password mismanagement and credential stuffing; however, the findings were\nnot conclusive and suggested there may have been other causes.\n\nCredential stuffing attacks leverage poor cyber hygiene habits (i.e., users reusing the same\nusername/password combinations across multiple platforms and websites). Several security\ncountermeasures were taken, including forced password updates and multi-factor\nauthentication.\n\n## Second Attack Wave, February 2022\n\nOnce again, in mid-February 2022, a number of Taiwan financial institutions and securities\ntraders were targeted — some being victims of the November 2021 attacks and others\nCyCraft customers. CyCraft MDR/EDR cybersecurity solutions observed suspicious files and\nlogin events on customer servers and immediately began investigating. After three days,\n**CyCraft completed their IR investigations.**\n\n\n-----\n\nCyCraft MDR’s first detection, auto triage, and alert sent for malicious executable\nPresentationCache[.]exe\nCyCraft’s three-day IR investigation uncovered that neither the February 2022 nor the\nNovember 2021 attacks were solely a direct result of credential stuffing. A more thorough\ninvestigation revealed evidence suggesting credential stuffing was purposely left behind by\nAPT10 — credential stuffing was just a smokescreen.\n\n**Both attacks were the result of a supply chain attack targeting specific financial**\n**software. A vulnerability existing in financial software with a majority market share among**\nTaiwan securities traders was exploited by the attackers, granting them high-level access to\nmultiple firms. Further investigation showed that what was initially presumed to be two\nseparate waves of cyberattacks was actually one prolonged attack campaign in which the\nattackers leveraged advanced obfuscation techniques not previously observed.\n\nThis isn’t the first “smokescreen attack” by a China-based threat group. In April 2020,\nCyCraft observed a China-based threat group use ransomware as a smokescreen for a\ntargeted attack on the CPC Corporation, as reported by CyCraft and Bloomberg.\n\n“For more than a decade, Chinese hackers have waged a persistent cyber offensive\nagainst Taiwanese government, non-government and corporate targets. Taiwan also\nhappens to be home to some of the electronics, semiconductor, and military\ntechnology that China desperately wants to get its hands on.”\n\n[Bloomberg on smokescreen cyberattack targeting the CPC Corporation](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-17/what-a-chinese-ransomware-attack-tells-us-about-the-future-of-cyber-warfare)\n\n## Attack Attribution\n\nAnalysis of the attacker C2 domain, the Quasar backdoor malware, and the attacker\nbehavior used in the attacks has led to a high degree of confidence in attributing the attacks\nto a Chinese threat actor. In the second wave of attacks observed by CyCraft, there is a\n[medium degree of confidence in the attribution of APT10 — a China-based threat group.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**The objective of these attacks does not appear to have solely been financial gain but**\n**rather the exfiltration of brokerage information, the scraping of high-value PII data,**\n**damaging the reputation of Taiwan financial institutions, and the disruption of investor**\n**confidence during a period of economic growth for Taiwan.**\n\nOne of the many attack techniques utilized by APT10 was the new technique “Reflective\n[Code Loading”, which was incorporated into the MITRE ATT&CK framework just last](https://attack.mitre.org/)\nOctober.\n\nCyberTotal Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform Detecting APT10 Activity\n\n## ABOUT APT10\n\nThis [Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), known as APT10 by](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/) [MITRE ATT&CK nomenclature,](https://attack.mitre.org/)\nhas been active since at least 2006. Common targets of APT10 include healthcare, defense,\nfinance, maritime, biotechnology, energy, and governmental organizations, with an emphasis\non targets in Japan and Taiwan. APT10 is believed to be associated with the Chinese\nIntelligence Agency, the [Ministry of State Security (MSS).](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/china-mss-guangdong-state-security-department-hackers)\n\nIn 2018, the [U.S. Department of Justice charged two members of APT10, Zhu Hua and](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\nZhang Jianguo, with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire\nfraud, and aggravated identity theft. The Department of Justice charges that these\nindividuals acted in association with the Tianjin State Security Bureau and had been\nengaging in global computer intrusions for more than a decade.\n\n## Three-Day Incident Response\n\nThe fast, accurate, and thorough response of CyCraft’s three-day IR investigation is due to\ntheir autonomous ML-driven security technology.
