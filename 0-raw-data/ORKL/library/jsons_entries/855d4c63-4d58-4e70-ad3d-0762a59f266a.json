The hardware maker recommends users reset their gateways to factory settings\nto flush away any configurations added by an intruder, change the login password, make\nsure remote management access from the WAN is disabled, and ensure the latest firmware\nis installed to be safe.\n\nCyclops Blink has ties to Kremlin-backed Sandworm, the criminal gang behind the nasty\n[VPNFilter malware that in 2018 targeted routers and storage devices. The crew also carried](https://www.theregister.com/2018/09/27/fancy_bear_modules/)\nout several high-profile attacks including the 2015 and 2016 cyber-assaults on Ukraine's\n\n\n-----\n\nelectrical grid, NotPetya in 2017, and the French presidential campaign email leak that same\nyear.\n\nA Trend Micro [warning about the router hijackings follows a joint advisory last month from the](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/c/cyclops-blink-sets-sights-on-asus-routers--.html)\nFBI, CISA, the US Department of Justice, and the UK National Cyber Security Centre about\nCyclops Blink, which the agencies said looked to be Sandworm's replacement for VPNFilter.\nAt the time, the botnet had its sights set on [WatchGuard firewall appliances.](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-news/blog/important-detection-and-remediation-actions-cyclops-blink-state-sponsored-botnet)\n\n\"Our data also shows that although Cyclops Blink is a state-sponsored botnet, its C&C\nservers and bots affect WatchGuard Firebox and Asus devices that do not belong to critical\norganizations, or those that have an evident value on economic, political, or military\nespionage,\" Trend Micro said. \"Hence, we believe that it is possible that the Cyclops Blink\nbotnet's main purpose is to build an infrastructure for further attacks on high-value targets.\"\n\nAnd while Cyclops Blink has infected routers from these two hardware providers, \"we have\nevidence that the routers of at least one vendor other than Asus and WatchGuard are\nconnecting to Cyclops Blink C&Cs as well, but so far we have been unable to collect\nmalware samples for this router brand,\" the security shop said.\n\nIt's not clear exactly right now how the malware gets onto a device, though it probably\ninvolves exploiting a default admin password to gain access via an enabled remote\nmanagement service. According to Trend Micro's Cyclops Blink technical analysis, once the\nmodular malware, written in C, has been injected into the gateway and is running, it sets\nitself up and renames its process to \"[ktest]\" presumably to appear as a Linux kernel thread.\n\nNext, it waits for 37 seconds and decides on the hard-coded command-and-control (C2)\nserver to talk to along with the rate at which it communicates with the box. Then it begins\ncommunicating with its C2 server using an OpenSSL-encrypted channel to join the Cyclops\nBlink botnet. Among the commands it can receive, the compromised router can be given\nmore malware to run, allowing the botnet's controllers to do whatever they like on the\nhijacked gateways. ®\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n\n-----\n\nStolen university credentials up for sale by Russian crooks, FBI warns\n\nForget dark-web souks, thousands of these are already being traded on public bazaars\n\n[Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 22:34 UTC](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Jessica-Lyons-Hardcastle)\nRussian crooks are selling network credentials and virtual private network access for a\n\"multitude\" of US universities and colleges on criminal marketplaces, according to the\nFBI.\n\nAccording to a warning issued on Thursday, these stolen credentials sell for thousands\nof dollars on both dark web and public internet forums, and could lead to subsequent\ncyberattacks against individual employees or the schools themselves.\n\n\"The exposure of usernames and passwords can lead to brute force credential stuffing\ncomputer network attacks, whereby attackers attempt logins across various internet\nsites or exploit them for subsequent cyber attacks as criminal actors take advantage of\nusers recycling the same credentials across multiple accounts, internet sites, and\n[services,\" the Feds' alert [PDF] said.](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220526.pdf)\n\n[Continue reading](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/27/fbi_warning_stolen_university_credentials/?td=keepreading-btm)\nBig Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation\n\nStudy claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules\n\n[Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC 2](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Thomas-Claburn)\nAmazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public\nstatements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common\norganizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.\n\n[That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2022/05/26/tech-industry-groups-are-watering-down-attempts-at-privacy-regulation-one-state-at-a-time)\ncorporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown\nstate privacy bills.\n\nThe report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy\nlegislation and identified 445 lobbyists and lobbying firms working on behalf of Amazon,\nApple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, along with industry groups like TechNet and the\nState Privacy and Security Coalition.\n\n[Continue reading](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/27/big_tech_privacy/?td=keepreading-btm)\n\n\n-----\n\nSEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake\n\nMeanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors\n\n[Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC 3](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Katyanna-Quach)\nAmerica's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed\nhis purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media\ncompany hangs in the balance.\n\n[A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he \"[did] not appear\"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000000000022003713/filename1.pdf)\n[to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter \"required 10 days](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/04/elon_musk_twitter/)\nfrom the date of acquisition,\" and asked him to provide more information.
