New malicious activity is flowing smoothly, commandand-control servers appear, everything works like Swiss watch. Are there any weak points in\nsuch a construction?\n\nTo answer this question we may think about a race car. It’s a masterpiece crafted for\nmaximum speed, however, the more speed it has, the less chances it has to make a sharp\nturn. Malware infrastructure has the same weakness of inertia. When every joint works fine,\nyou should have a strong reason to change something in it.\n\nWe can use it for our benefit just like movie detectives do. Take a city map, mark the spots of\nprevious crimes ─ and you will likely understand the pattern and even get a probable place\nof next crime activity, it will likely follow the determined template. In this research we show\nhow to transform these actions to the world of malware. We take one of the most prevalent\ncontemporary botnets called Dridex, mark its previous crime scenes, build the map and draw\n\n\n-----\n\nconclusions helping us to catch the next strike. We show evidence of success of such an\napproach measured in strict numbers and explain how to use this idea in other real world\ncases.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Dridex Banking Trojan first appeared in 2014 and is still one of the most prevalent\n[malware families. In March 2020, Dridex topped the list of most wanted malware.](https://www.checkpoint.com/press/2020/march-2020s-most-wanted-malware-dridex-banking-trojan-ranks-on-top-malware-list-for-first-time/)\n\nDridex was created by a cyber-crime group called “Evil Corp” which has caused an\nestimated damage of $100 million to the banking system worldwide. A lot of research has\nbeen issued already covering different aspects of the malware details and how the cybercrime group functions.\n\nIn this article we provide a summary of key details known about Dridex to date. We explore\npre-history of Dridex development, give an overview and show its key technical features and\nmethods of spreading. We explain how we can intercept this malware at the earliest stages\nof the infection chain. We also provide graphs that show evidence of the success of our\napproach and how our customers are protected against this malware.\n\n## Background\n\nDridex has a famous lineage. Let’s take a step back in history to find out more about the time\nperiod when its earliest version appeared.\n\nThe key names in this story:\n\n**Evgeniy Bogachev ─ Creator of the infamous ZeuS malware.**\n**Maksim Yakubets ─ Alleged leader of Evil Corp cyber-crime group which is**\nresponsible for Dridex operations.\n\n## Pre-Dridex era – It all starts with ZeuS\n\nZeus is a Trojan Horse malware. Its capabilities include turning an infected machine into a\nbotnet node, stealing banking credentials, downloading and executing separate malicious\nmodules. The members of cyber crime group attempted to steal around 220 million USD\n[worldwide utilizing ZeuS according to FBI investigation.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-11457611)\n\nThe timeline below shows key points in ZeuS evolution:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – Chronology of ZeuS evolution._\n\nWhen ZeuS source code was leaked in 2011, various branches of this malware started to\nappear. It was very popular malware and gave rise to lots of different malware branches.\n[ZeuS versions may be in a ZeuS online museum. At the time of this writing, ZeuS was](https://zeusmuseum.com/)\nassociated with 29 different malware families, featuring around 490 versions in total.\n\nIn May 2014, the FBI issued a bulletin with description of Evgeniy Bogachev and the\npromised reward of 3 million USD “for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction.”\n\n\n_Figure 1 – Chronology of ZeuS evolution._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – Description of Evgeniy Bogachev on the FBI site._\n\n## Dridex era\n\nAfter the botnets of direct ZeuS successors were taken down, Dridex’s time came. This\nmalware is a result of Bugat evolution (which appeared in 2010). Bugat v5 was recognized\nas Dridex in 2014.\n\n[More names appear on the stage at this time.](https://boingboing.net/2019/12/05/feds-charge-evil-corp-russia.html)\n\nAndrey Ghinkul (from Moldova) was allegedly one of the administrators behind Dridex\nbotnets in 2015.\nIgor Turashev was allegedly one of the administrators behind Dridex botnets as well.\nDenis Gusev was one of the key investors behind EvilCorp.\n\n\n_Figure 2 – Description of Evgeniy Bogachev on the FBI site._\n\n\n-----\n\n[More names connected to Dridex can be found in US treasury sanctions statement.](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845)\n\nThe timeline below shows some milestones in Dridex evolution:\n\n_Figure 3 – Chronology of Dridex evolution._\n\nDridex in turn gave rise to a number of ransomwares starting with Bitpaymer in 2017. This\nbranch continued with DoppelPaymer, which was developed in 2019, and WastedLocker,\nwhich was developed in 2020.\n\n## Recent past\n\nIn 2019, Dridex had at least 14 active botnets, some of which had already been spotted\npreviously, and others newly developed. Botnets are differentiated by their ID numbers.\nThese are among the most active at this time: 10111, 10222, 10444, 40200, 40300.\n\nAt the end of 2019, the FBI issued a bulletin with a description of the author of Dridex and a\npromised reward of 5 million USD (compared with 3 million USD previously for E. Bogachev).\n\n\n_Figure 3 – Chronology of Dridex evolution._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – Description of Maksim Yakubets on the FBI site._\n\n[There is also evidence of Maksim’s luxurious lifestyle, undoubtedly due to income from his](https://www.businessinsider.com/millionaire-russian-hackers-evil-corp-car-pictures-video-2019-12)\nmalicious activities.\n\n\n_Figure 4 – Description of Maksim Yakubets on the FBI site._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 – Cars, girls, money; the luxurious lifestyle of Maksim Yakubets._\n\nTo date, Maksim Yakubets has not been apprehended by law enforcement.\n\nAs mentioned previously, in 2020, Dridex topped the lists of the most prevalent malware\nfamilies in the world.\n\n## Infection chain\n\nBefore we start the analysis of Dridex samples themselves, we want to understand the\ninfrastructure behind the malware. How is it delivered? What are the targets? What is the\ninitial detection rate of supporting files? We will find the answers to all of these questions\nbelow.\n\n## Flow\n\nWhen the operators want to spread Dridex, they use established spambots from different\ncyber-crime groups to send malicious documents attached to handily crafted e-mails. At\ndifferent times of the Dridex lifecycle, Necurs, Cutwail and Andromeda botnets have all\nbeen involved in spreading Dridex.\n\nWhen a user downloads and opens such a document (it may be Word or Excel), the\nembedded macros are launched with the aim of downloading and executing the Dridex\npayload.\n\n\n_Figure 5 – Cars, girls, money; the luxurious lifestyle of Maksim Yakubets._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – Dridex infection chain execution flow._\n\n## Targets\n\nDridex targets different high-profile entities from various parts of the world:\n\nU.S. bank accounts.\nU.S. credit card companies.\nU.S. financial investment corporations.\nEuropean bank accounts.\nGovernmental agencies in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman.\n\n## Lures\n\nTo increase the successful rate at which Dridex is spread, malicious actors disguise their\nspam e-mails to look like legitimate ones. We can name examples of UPS, FedEx and DHL\nas companies whose logos and mailing style are used as bait in such e-mails.\n\n_Figure 7 – Examples of lures._\n\n\n_Figure 6 – Dridex infection chain execution flow._\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the victim clicks the link, either the archive with the malicious document or the\nmalicious document itself is opened.\n\n## Initial detection rate\n\nWhen first seen in the wild, Dridex delivery files show a very low detection rate. In the\nscreenshot below we see the initial detection rate of the Excel document which delivers\nDridex:\n\n_Figure 8 – Initial detection rate of the Dridex delivery file._\n\nThe same is true for other delivery files.\n\n## Loader and Payload\n\nThe Dridex sample consists of the loader and the payload. We discuss key points of each\npart below.\n\n## Anti-debug technique\n\nThe Dridex loader utilizes the OutputDebugStringW function to make malware analysis\nmore difficult. Different loaders produce different outputs (with the “Installing…” string being\nvery popular) but the idea is the same everywhere: making a long loop that contains a lot of\nmeaningless debug messages. In the figure below, we see the example of such a loop with\nan iteration of around 200 million:\n\n\n_Figure 8 – Initial detection rate of the Dridex delivery file._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 – Loop with 0xBEBBE7C (around 200 million) iterations calling OutputDebugStringW._\n\nThe output looks like this in the log:\n\n_Figure 10 – Dridex debug messages that overwhelm the analysis log._\n\n## Obfuscation\n\n\n_Figure 10 – Dridex debug messages that overwhelm the analysis log._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload is heavily obfuscated; almost no function is called directly. Call resolutions are\nperformed with the help of hash values identifying the library and the function it contains. An\nexample of such a resolution is shown in the screenshot below:\n\n_Figure 11 – Example of the call resolution in the Dridex payload._\n\nAll the functions important for key Dridex’ tasks are called this way.\n\n_Figure 12 – Example of resolved calls to Internet functions._\n\n[We used the Labeless tool to resolve obfuscated function calls.](https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/labeless-an-introduction/)\n\nStrings in the malware are obfuscated using the RC4 algorithm and the decryption key\nstored inside the sample.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe main point of interest inside the payload is its configuration. It contains the following\nimportant details:\n\nBot ID.\nNumber of C&C servers.\nList of the C&C servers themselves.\n\nAn example of the configuration:\n\n_Figure 13 – Example of the Dridex configuration inside the payload._\n\nThe bot ID in this example is 12333. The Command and Control servers are:\n\n\n_Figure 11 – Example of the call resolution in the Dridex payload._\n\n\n_Figure 13 – Example of the Dridex configuration inside the payload._\n\n\n-----\n\n92.222.216.44:443\n69.55.238.203:3389\n66.228.47.181:443\n198.199.106.229:5900\n104.247.221.104:443\n178.254.38.200:884\n152.46.8.148:884\n\n## Network activity\n\nDridex sends POST requests to the servers from the configuration to get further commands,\nwaiting for 200 OK responses. Please note that these servers are not real C&C servers but\nrather proxies for connecting to the real ones.\n\n_Figure 14 – The Dridex botnet infrastructure._\n\nThe information which is sent by the malware to the C&C servers contains the following data:\n\nComputer name\nBotnet ID number\nType of request\nOS architecture\nList of installed software\n\nThis data is encrypted with the RC4 algorithm, the key for which is stored among encrypted\nstrings inside the malware.\n\n\n_Figure 14 – The Dridex botnet infrastructure._\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are at least 6 different types of request; among them are the following ones:\n\n“list” – gets configuration\n“bot” – receives bot module\n\n## Putting IOCs together\n\nThe earlier the infection is caught, the better the chances of mitigation. To catch the infection\nas quickly as possible while spending the minimum amount of resources, we want to focus\non the initial delivery stage.\n\nHowever, detection is only one aspect. We may confidently say that something is malicious,\nbut we also want to classify the threat. To do so, we have to be sure that this particular\nmalware is indeed Dridex.\n\nLet’s take a look at the Dridex infection chain again and determine the different stages which\nwe can use for its detection and identification:\n\n_Figure 15 – Different stages of Dridex detection._\n\nAt different stages of the Dridex infection, we can use the following indicators for its\ndetection.\n\n1 stage, malicious documents:st\n\n\n_Figure 15 – Different stages of Dridex detection._\n\n\nHashes of the documents\nImages inside documents\nInternal structure of the document\nMacros used inside\n2nd stage, servers:\n\nDomains\nURLs\n\n\n-----\n\n3 stage, loaders and payloads:\n\nHashes of the samples\nIP addresses in the configuration file\n\n## Why are so many factors important?\n\nWe have seen a correlation between infrastructures and indicators of Dridex and other\nprevalent malware families such as Emotet and Ursnif. Malicious documents share common\nindicators when used for the delivery of all the malware mentioned above. Some C2 servers\n– or to be precise, proxy servers – are used both by Dridex and Emotet, though ports and\nconnection types are different.\n\nThat’s why we have to analyze a lot of details before we draw a conclusion of what malware\nwe’re dealing with. The more unique factors related to a particular botnet we have, the easier\nit is to say if another attack has the same patterns.\n\nThe ideal way to classify malware is of course getting and analyzing the final payload: if it’s\nDridex, then everything that was launched before it is classified as Dridex as well. However,\nit may take some time (sometimes a significant amount after the initial malicious document is\nobtained) before the result is known. We can do the classification faster, with high\nconfidence, by analyzing all the indicators we get at the earliest stages of infection chain.\n\n## IP addresses to draw a map\n\nAnother interesting note is utilizing the same network for downloading Dridex samples. We\nanalyzed domains used for this purpose, resolved their IPs and discovered that quite a few\nof them reside in the same network 84.38.180.0/22 with less than 1024 addresses available\nin total. Network belongs to Russian ASN Selectel that rarely takes down the malicious\ncontent or spam.\n\nWe saw the following IP addresses linked to Dridex domains in the 84.38.180.0/22 network\n(and other networks within the same ASN). Dates show the first time the Dridex domain\npointed to the corresponding IPs:\n\n**IPs** **Date** **Domains**\n\n84.38.182.248 May 10 rokadorc.com\nnrokadorc.com\n\n84.38.183.77 June 17 juneusdousigninc.com\nusdousigninc.com\n\n\n84.38.182.236\n84.38.183.213\n\n\nJune 22 marutoba.com\nterrasimonad.com\nenterassimonad.com\n\n\n-----\n\n**IPs** **Date** **Domains**\n\n84.38.181.195 June 28 caranatrium.com\n\n\n84.38.183.114\n84.38.183.237\n\n\nJuly 06 menodlap.com\nturendong.com\nmadustag.com\n\n\nWhile this factor alone is not enough to identify Dridex, this is a good auxiliary detail to refer\nto when dealing with Dridex IOCs.\n\n## Detection\n\nThe graphs below show Dridex spikes on different dates when we caught the incoming\nthreats at its earliest stages.\n\n_Figure 16 – Dridex infection spike on June 29._\n\n_Figure 17 – Dridex infection spike between July 6 – July 8._\n\n\n_Figure 17 – Dridex infection spike between July 6 – July 8._\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is crucial to be able to intercept Dridex infection as early as possible. In many cases, if the\nspam is not being sent for several days consecutively, like it was between July 6 and July 8,\nthe botnet activity slows down the next day and we do not get as many IOC matches as\nduring its spike. Given that new infections appear at around afternoon UTC+3, we have less\nthan 12 hours to react to the incoming threat.\n\n## Dridex development\n\nSince July 22 we haven’t observed any fresh Dridex spam samples. Dridex made a reappearance on September 7, showing a massive increase in its activity spike for 2\nconsecutive days:\n\n_Figure 18 – Recent September spike in Dridex activity._\n\nDridex operators updated the 1 stage of Dridex execution: they have added more URLsst\nfrom where payload may be downloaded – as opposed to the single URL in the earliest\nversions of malicious documents. Now their number may be as high as 50 within the single\ndocument.\n\nWe’re constantly monitoring this botnet and detecting its payload at different stages of\nexecution.\n\nWe hope this publication provided useful insights on different variants and methods to deal\nwith this threat. We also believe that these methods may be applied when encountering\nother threats as well.\n\nAs cyber attacks become increasingly evasive, more controls are added, making security\nmore complicated and tedious to the point that user workflows are affected. Until now.\n\nFueled by the Power of ThreatCloud, the Most Powerful Threat Intelligence and AI\ntechnologies to prevent unknown cyber threats\n\n[SandBlast Network provides the best zero-day protection while reducing security overhead](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/advanced-network-threat-prevention/)\n\n\n_Figure 18 – Recent September spike in Dridex activity._\n\n\n-----\n\nand ensuring business productivity.\n\n## Protection signatures\n\nBanker.Win.Dridex.A\n\nBanker.Win.Dridex.B\n\nBanker.Win.Dridex.С\n\nBanker.Win.Dridex.D\n\nBanker.Win.Dridex.E\n\nBanker.Win.Dridex.F\n\nBanker.Win.Dridex.gl.H\n\nBanker.Win.Dridex.J\n\nBanker.Win.Dridex.K\n\n## IOCs\n\nBelow we list some of the indicators linked to Dridex.
