BlackBerry ThreatVector Blog](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en.html)\n2. Threat Thursday: Dr. REvil Ransomware Strikes Again, Employs Double Extortion Tactics\n\n### Summary\n\n[The FBI has named the Russia-affiliated Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group REvil (also known as Sodin](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/06/blackberry-prevents-revil-ransomware)\nor [Sodinokibi) as the culprits behind attacks on the world’s largest meat supplier, JBS. These attacks](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2019/07/threat-spotlight-sodinokibi-ransomware)\nthreatened the global food supply chain and serve as a reminder of the vulnerable state of critical\ninfrastructure worldwide.\n\nGiven the success of the REvil attacks and other similar malware, it is crucial for organizations to learn how to\nprevent ransomware threats. This blog offers a brief overview of how REvil operates and offers effective\nsolutions for stopping these kinds of attacks in the future.\n\nThe malware acts as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and became prolific after another RaaS\n[group, GandCrab, shut down their operations. Security researchers have identified many similarities and code](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2018/03/cylance-vs-gandcrab-ransomware)\nreuse between REvil and GandCrab. REvil was first advertised on Russian language cybercrime forums and is\nassociated with the threat actor “Unknown” or “UNKN”.\n\n\n-----\n\n[REvil is most famously associated with recent attacks on Travelex,](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/unpatched-vpn-makes-travelex-latest-victim-of-revil-ransomware/) [Acer, and Apple supplier Quanta](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security)\nComputer. Acting as a RaaS, REvil relies on affiliates or partners to perform its attacks. The REvil developers\nreceive a percentage of all proceeds from ransom payments. Because the ransomware is distributed by\ndifferent entities, the initial infection vector can vary; typically, this is either via phishing campaigns, brute force\nattacks to compromise RDP, or through software vulnerabilities. REvil is also known to be distributed by other\n[malware such as IcedID.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/02/blackberry-cylance-vs-icedid-banking-trojan)\n\n_[Read our previous deep dive on Sodinokibi.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2019/07/threat-spotlight-sodinokibi-ransomware)_\n\n### Operating System\n\n Risk and Impact\n\n Technical Analysis\n\nREvil stores its configuration as an encoded resource. The first 32 bytes are the key used to decode the\nconfiguration, which is contained in the remaining bytes:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: REvil’s key is contained in the first 32 bytes._\n\nInitially, REvil will fingerprint the target machine and gather system information. Before beginning the\nencryption routine, REvil will kill certain processes such as email clients, SQL or other database servers,\nbrowsers and Microsoft® Office applications to ensure it can encrypt important files belonging to the victim. It\nwill also remove shadow copies to prevent easy recovery.\n\nFor persistence, the ransomware creates a registry key to execute with Windows startup under:\n\n**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\aDTFUAIa7j**\n**:**\n\n_Figure 2: Registry key created._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample analyzed also creates registry entries under HKLM\\BlackLivesMatter\\ containing hex values:\n\n_Figure 3: Hex values._\n\nThe malware creates a mutex: \"Global\\8C39F091-3A8D-46F4-DBC5-DDA17B3C63C2\", to ensure it is the\nonly running instance. If another instance is executed, it will prompt an error message:\n\n_Figure 4: REvil error message._\n\nREvil will enumerate files on the system and during the encryption process appends a random alpha numeric\nextension between 5 and 10 characters in length, E.G.: “.oh24o8”.\n\nA ransom note, with the same alpha-numeric name as that used for the file extensions, followed by\n“readme.txt”, is dropped in all affected directories, E.G.: “oh24o8-readme.txt”:\n\n_Figure 5: REVil ransom note text file._\n\nScreenshot of the ransom note belonging to REvil:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: REvil ransom note._\n\nFor file encryption, REvil uses curve25519/Salsa20; key encryption utilizes curve25519/AES-256-CTR. The\ndevelopers of REvil pride themselves as having created the best data encryption and decryption system\ncurrently available.\n\nA custom .bmp image is dropped to the %Temp% directory and this is set as the desktop wallpaper via a\nregistry setting. The wallpaper image informs the user that their files have been encrypted:\n\n_Figure 7: REvil wallpaper ransom note._\n\nTo pay the ransom, two URLs are provided, one accessible with the TOR browser and a secondary site which\ncan be used if TOR is blocked in the user’s location:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: REvil URL for key input._\n\nThe ransom note provides the key to enter after navigating to either website. The ransom can be paid in either\nMonero or Bitcoin, although if the user chooses to pay in Bitcoin, this increases the cost by 10%:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: REvil warning re. price increase._\n\nREvil also benefits from employing the effective tactic of double extortion. To encourage the victim to pay the\nransom in a timely manner, the attacker threatens to publicly disclose or sell confidential stolen information on\nthe dark web:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: REvil double extortion tactics._\n\nThe following Yara rule was authored by the BlackBerry Threat Research Team to catch the threat described\nin this document:\n\n### Yara Rule:\n\n\n-----\n\nimport \"pe\"\n\nrule Mal_Win_Ransom_REvil\n\n{\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"REvil sample April 2021\"\n\nauthor = \"Blackberry Threat Research\"\n\ndate = \"2021-04\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$s1 = \"bootcfg /raw /a /safeboot:network /id 1\" nocase ascii\n\n$s2 = \"bcdedit /set\" nocase ascii\n\n$s3 = \"safeboot network\" nocase ascii\n\n$s4 = \"Domain\" nocase wide\n\n$s5 = \"StopService\" nocase wide\n\n$s6 = \"GetOwner\" nocase wide\n\n$s7 = \"ERR0R D0UBLE RUN!\" nocase wide\n\n$s8 = \"k-Err-\" nocase wide\n\n$s9 = \"Win32_Service\" nocase wide\n\ncondition:\n\n//PE File\n\nuint16(0) == 0x5A4D and\n\n// Filesize\n\nfilesize < 130KB and\n\n// Import Hash\n\npe.imphash() == \"031931d2f2d921a9d906454d42f21be0\" and\n\n// Five PE Sections\n\npe.number_of_sections == 5 and\n\n// All Strings\n\nall of them\n\n}\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n\nAt BlackBerry, we take a [prevention-first and AI-driven approach to cybersecurity.
