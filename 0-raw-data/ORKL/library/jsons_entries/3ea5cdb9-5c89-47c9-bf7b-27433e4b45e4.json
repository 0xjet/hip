    "plain_text": "# Attacking the Heart of the German Industry\n\n**web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/**\n\n**Have you kept count?**\n\nSo far, ten companies have been affected, most of them in Germany.\n\nThis tool hit pay dirt at Covestro and Bostik. Many IT companies are taking the same route to\nfind Winnti infected computers; some of the results have been leaked to us—in the strictest\nconfidence. Thanks to this tool, we found out back in March 2019 that the Bayer\npharmaceutical group had been hacked by Winnti.\n\nThe tool was written by staff of Thyssenkrupp, because the industrial giant—company\nnumber eleven—had been spied on by Winnti. In 2016, the corporation allowed a reporter\nfrom “Wirtschaftswoche” to watch the attackers being pushed back. The magazine later\n[wrote of a “six-month defensive battle.” The hackers had succeeded in extracting small data](https://www.wiwo.de/my/technologie/digitale-welt/attacke-auf-thyssenkrupp-schon-2016-griff-winnti-an-exklusiver-report-aus-dem-auge-des-sturms/14949912.html)\nsets of importance for the construction of plants. The company mentions “data fragments”\nand believes that the hackers have missed their actual target, tapping into the corporation’s\nresearch results.\n\n## The trail leading to China\n\nAt Gameforge, the Winnti hackers had already been removed from the networks when a staff\nmember noticed a Windows start screen with Chinese characters. Presumably, the hackers\nwere using tools in their native language, which would have made their work easier. But they\nforgot to cover up their tracks. Just another mistake they made, one of many.\n\nIn October 2016, several DAX corporations, including BASF and Bayer, founded the German\nCyber Security Organization (DCSO). The job of DCSO’s IT security experts is to observe\nand recognize hacker groups like Winnti and to get to the bottom of their motives. In Winnti’s\ncase, DCSO speaks of a “mercenary force” which is said to be closely linked with the\nChinese government. They have been tracking the group for a long time: “We can, based on\nmany, many indicators, say with high confidence that Winnti is being directed by the\nChinese.”\n\nWe can, based on many, many indicators, say with high confidence that Winnti is being\ndirected by the Chinese\n\nDror-John Röcher, DCSO\n\nMany of the experts we talked to believe that the group is operating out of mainland China. “I\ndon’t care if the hackers work in green uniforms or are commissioned by people wearing\ngreen uniforms ” says an IT security expert alluding to a suspected proximity to the country’s\n\n\n-----\n\nmilitary intelligence service.\n\nIt would seem that in the early days, Winnti hackers were still quite careless. One of them left\nmany traces on the Internet. In 2013, the Kaspersky team was able to follow clues in their\ncode. This is how Costin Raiu and his colleagues came across a person using the alias\n“Mer4en7y.” This individual was active in hacker forums where he commented in Chinese on\na job offer for recruiting hackers. There was mention of a “powerful background.” “And\n‘Mer4en7y’ replied that the job was too far away for him, but that he was in full support of the\nwork,” says Raiu.\n\n[On 30 October 2018, the US government brought charges against ten Chinese nationals.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-intelligence-officers-and-their-recruited-hackers-and-insiders-conspired-steal)\nTwo of them are believed to be working for one of China’s intelligence services. Hackers are\ncharged with spying on a manufacturer of gas turbines. Also charged in connection with the\ncrime: “Mer4en7y”, who is believed to have been acting on behalf of the intelligence service\nand to have used the Winnti software for the hack. IT security experts attribute the\ncyberattack to a different Chinese group. But the charges filed are testimony to the close\nlinks between at least one Winnti hacker and the government.\n\nThe US government is accusing the individual going by the alias Mer4en7y of using the\nWinnti software\n\nJanka Oertel of the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) in Berlin has been\nkeeping a close eye on China. Oertel considers it “very unlikely that large-scale cyber\noperations could be happening without at least parts of the Chinese party-state knowing\nabout them.” Oertel, a political scientist, emphasizes that China wants to play a “significant\nmarket role” in key industries such as materials research by 2025 and to dominate the world\nmarket by 2035. “In some of these areas, however, China has not yet managed to achieve its\ngoals without technology transfers—including transfers from Germany ” Oertel adds\n\n\n-----\n\nA government official familiar with the hacking cases agrees: Cyber incidents allow us to\ndraw conclusions as to a nation’s true priorities.” The point, he believes, is to understand\none’s own industry and to figure out what cannot be produced fast enough. The missing\nmaterials are then procured by hacking operations.\n\nBut a former staffer of a European intelligence agency warns: “If I wanted to hack anyone\nright now, I’d make it look like a Chinese group.” He warns against underestimating the\nproficiency of hackers working for governments. After all, he says, laying false trails is their\njob.\n\nPeople working for the German intelligence agencies tell us that, although all current findings\nsuggest that Winnti originates from China, much of the evidence is based on data that is\nseveral years old. “We have a knowledge gap for the past two to three years,” says one\nindividual familiar with the incidents.”\n\nIf I wanted to hack anyone right now, I’d make it look exactly like a Chinese group.\n\nFormer staffer of a European intelligence agency\n\nWhile Germany does address industrial espionage in direct talks with the Chinese\nleadership, these attempts are considered a waste of time. “Fruitless,” says one individual\nwho knows how these meetings work. The other side denies everything, he says, and what’s\nleft at the end of the day are meaningless declarations of intent. And the Germans are\nhesitant to provide concrete evidence—for fear of revealing to the Chinese leadership what\nthey know— for example, from the work of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe BND is trawling the internet for specific groups of attackers. The agency received 300\nmillion Euros to set up a powerful surveillance system, among other things. The idea is to\nfind hacker groups suspected of being government backed and likely to cause damage to the\nFederal Republic. There is also talk of starting an “intelligence offensive” against Chinese\ngroups of attackers. This means: Hacking into the networks. Spies watching spies.\n\n## Political espionage?\n\nCorporations like Bayer, Covestro, Roche and Bostik share a single common denominator:\nthe chemical sector. However, analyses also show that a number of targets now affected are\ndeviating from the known pattern. We are talking about the possibility of political espionage.\nWe have come across several indicators corroborating this suspicion.\n\nThe Hong Kong government was spied on by the Winnti hackers. We found four infected\nsystems thanks to the network scan, and proceeded to inform the government by email.\nThey confirm our findings: “Recently, it was found that six Internet facing computers of two\ngovernment departments returned positive results from a test for Winnti malware.” The\naffected computers did not contain any classified information or citizens’ personal data, and\nthere was “no evidence” that any data have been copied out, we are being told.\n\nThe network scan also sniffs out a telecommunications provider from India, which happens to\nbe located precisely in the region where the Tibetan government in exile (the “Central\nTibetan Administration”) has its headquarters. Incidentally, the relevant identifier in the\nmalware is called “CTA.” A file which ended up on Virustotal in 2018 contained a pretty\nstraightforward keyword: “tibet”. The CTA didn’t respond to our requests for comment.\n\n**Podcast (in German): How we deciphered the code**\n\nOn top of this there are campaigns which don’t seem to make a lot of sense unless you\nconsider political espionage. Take Marriott, the hotel chain based in Maryland, USA. The\ncorporation manages more than one million rooms worldwide. While Marriott hotels may be\nstate-of-the-art, who would want to hack Marriott for cutting-edge technologies or innovative\nideas? Who would want to spy on the Indonesian airline Lion Air for the same reasons?\nProbably nobody. But hotels and airlines collect data. If you know how to access these data,\nyou know where people travel and where they spend the night. And if you also hack into\ntelecommunications companies you know where these people are located at any given time.\nThe Winnti hackers managed to penetrate the networks of Lion Air and several\ntelecommunications companies, and they at least did take Marriott into their sights. We have\nthe relevant coded file in our hands.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the German government tells us that the security authorities\nhave established “multiple platforms and discussion groups” for that matter. If required,\naffected companies can request “appropriate advice and assistance for cleaning up their\nsystems and further prevention.” In July 2019 the Federal Office for Information Security\n\n\n-----\n\nreached out to a company, whose name was included in a Winnti implant. We were told that\n“generally speaking foreign intelligence agencies have established cyberattacks as a vital\nmode of acquiring more information.” According to the government, these hackers usually\ndon’t have to fear political or economical risks, “due to various obfuscation methods.\"\n\nThe German government’s response is elusive, when asked whether there is a connection\nbetween the Winnti hackers and the Chinese Government. They tell us that cyberattacks are\ntaken seriously, no matter who is responsible. We reached out to the Foreign Ministry of\nChina and the embassy in Berlin with this and other questions. We didn't hear back.\n\n## Phase 1: Cybercrime\n\nIt would seem that during the early stages, the hackers were concerned mainly about making\nmoney. Gameforge is a case in point: a gaming company based in the German town of\nKarlsruhe. During its heyday, the company had a staff of 700 working hard at conquering the\nglobal gaming market, and boasted annual sales to the tune of 140 million Euros. Gameforge\noffers so-called “freemium” games. While playing the games is free, those who want more\neither have to earn virtual money by completing certain tasks, which takes a long time, or\nshell out real money.\n\nWe are told that in 2011, an email message found its way into Gameforge’s mailbox in\nKarlsruhe. A staff member opened the attached file and unbeknownst to him started the\nhackers’ Winnti program. Shortly afterwards, a few players became virtual rich persons.\n\nThe administrators became aware that someone was directly accessing Gameforge’s\ndatabases and raising the account balance. They started getting worried. How could this be\nhappening? The technicians used the next maintenance interval to reinstall the servers of the\naffected game. The players didn’t have a clue about what’s going on. No sooner were the\nservers back up than the manipulations continued.\n\nGameforge was using Kaspersky antivirus software, which didn't cause any alarm bells to\nring. Gameforge arranged for Kaspersky's IT security experts to come directly to Karlsruhe.\nBecause obviously there was something weird going on. Nobody informed the State Bureau\nof Criminal Investigation or the local police. The year was 2011, and many investigators were\nbarely familiar with the term or concept of cybercrime.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile keeping an eye on Gameforge’s corporate network, the IT security experts did find\nsuspicious files and decided to analyze them. They noticed that the system had in fact been\ninfiltrated by hackers—who were acting like Gameforge’s administrators most of the time.\nWhich allowed them to remain invisible. It turned out that the hackers have taken over a total\nof 40 servers.\n\n**Persistent:**\n\nIt is very hard to permanently remove the hackers from the network.\n\nThis mode of operation is typical of many hacker groups—and especially of Winnti. “They are\na very, very persistent group,” says Costin Raiu, who has been watching Winnti since 2011.\nRaiu is in charge of Kaspersky’s malware analysis team. “Once the Winnti hackers are inside\na network, they take their sweet time to really get a feel for the infrastructure,” he says.\n\nThe hackers will map a company’s network and look for strategically favorable locations for\nplacing their malware. They keep tabs on which programs are used in a company and then\nexchange a file in one of these programs. The modified file looks like the original, but was\nsecretly supplemented by a few extra lines of code. From now on, this manipulated file does\nthe attackers’ bidding.\n\nWinnti is very specific to Germany. It is the attacker group that's being encountered most\nfrequently.\n\nAnonymous government official\n\n\n-----\n\nRaiu and his team have followed the digital tracks left behind by some of the Winnti hackers.\n“Nine years ago, things were much more clear-cut. There was a single team, which\ndeveloped and used Winnti. It now looks like there is at least a second group that also uses\nWinnti.” This view is shared by many IT security companies. And it is this second group\nwhich is getting the German security authorities so worried. One government official puts it\nvery matter-of-factly: “Winnti is very specific to Germany. It is the attacker group that's being\nencountered most frequently.\"\n\n## Phase 2: Industrial espionage\n\nBy 2014, the Winnti malware code was no longer limited to game manufacturers. The\nsecond group’s job is mainly industrial espionage. Hackers are targeting high-tech\ncompanies as well as chemical and pharmaceutical companies. We find evidence going as\nfar as mid-2019. Cases of espionage which were probably still ongoing when we discovered\nthem. Winnti is attacking companies in Japan, France, the U.S. and Germany. Or more\nprecisely: in Düsseldorf.\n\nMost people probably know the DAX company Henkel as a manufacturer of detergents and\nshampoos. But Henkel offers a huge range of other products, including adhesives for\nindustrial applications. Modern cars are glued instead of welded. In a commercial on\nYoutube, Henkel shows staff members successfully joining two metal plates with just three\ngrams of adhesive and then using the plates to pull a 280-ton train. Nearly half of Henkel’s\nannual sales of 20 billion Euros are generated by Henkel’s so-called “adhesive\ntechnologies\".\n\nThe Winnti hackers broke into Henkel’s network in 2014. We have three files showing that\nthis happened. Each of these files contains the same website belonging to Henkel and the\nname of the hacked server. For example, one starts with the letter sequence DEDUSSV. We\nrealize that server names can be arbitrary, but it is highly probable that DE stands for\nGermany and DUS for Düsseldorf, where the company headquarters are located. The\nhackers were able to monitor all activities running on the web server. And they also seemed\nto be able to reach systems which didn't have direct internet access: Internal storage files\nand possibly even the intranet.\n\nThe corporation confirms the Winnti incident and issues the following statement: “The\ncyberattack was discovered in the summer of 2014 and Henkel promptly took all necessary\nprecautions.” Henkel claims that a “very small portion” of its worldwide IT systems had been\naffected— the systems in Germany. According to Henkel, there was no evidence suggesting\nthat any sensitive data had been diverted.\n\n### How we worked\n\n\n-----\n\nBR and NDR reporters, in collaboration with several IT security experts, have analyzed the\nWinnti malware. It was notably Moritz Contag of Ruhr University Bochum who managed to\nextract information from different varieties of the malware. Contag wrote a script for this\nanalysis. You can find it [here. Silas Cutler, an IT security expert with US-based Chronicle](https://github.com/br-data/2019-winnti-analyse)\nSecurity, has confirmed Contag’s analyses.\n\nFar from attacking Henkel and the other companies arbitrarily, Winnti takes a highly strategic\napproach. Which is perfectly evident from the other cases. Take Covestro, for example, also\na manufacturer of adhesives, lacquers and paints. This chemical corporation, a Bayer spinoff, is now listed on the DAX. Covestro is regarded as Germany’s most successful spin-off in\nthe recent past. Up until June 2019, they had at least two systems on which the Winnti\nmalware had been installed. Although there is no concrete evidence of data loss, Covestro\nconsiders “this evidence of infection to be a serious attack on our company.” Another\nmanufacturer of adhesives, Bostik of France, was infected with Winnti in early 2019.\n\nThe hackers behind Winnti have also set their sights on Japan’s biggest chemical company,\nShin-Etsu Chemical. We have in our hands several varieties of the 2015 malware which was\nmost likely used for the attack. In the case of another Japanese company, Sumitomo Electric,\nWinnti apparently penetrated their networks during the summer of 2016. And consider\nRoche, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world: the sheer number of files,\n25 in total, gives you an idea of the degree of network penetration by the hackers. Winnti\nhackers also penetrated the BASF and Siemens networks. Both corporations have confirmed\nour research data.\n\nA BASF spokeswoman tells us in an email that in July 2015, hackers had successfully\novercome “the first levels” of defense. “When our experts discovered that the attacker was\nattempting to get around the next level of defense, the attacker was removed promptly and in\na coordinated manner from BASF’s network.” She added that no business relevant\ninformation had been lost at any time. According to Siemens, they were penetrated by the\nhackers in June 2016. “We quickly discovered and thwarted the attack,” Siemens told us in a\nwritten reply. Siemens claims that even after detailed analyses, no evidence suggesting data\nloss from the attack has been found to date.\n\n### Targeted companies\n\n**Gaming: Gameforge, Valve**\n**Software: Teamviewer**\n**Technology: Siemens, Sumitomo, Thyssenkrupp**\n**Pharma: Bayer, Roche**\n**Chemical: BASF, Covestro, Shin-Etsu**\n\nBostik, Sumitomo and Shin-Etsu didn’t respond to our requests for comments at all. Roche\nchose to keep their response neutral. A spokesperson replied that “information security and\ndata protection are taken very seriously.” Nearly all major corporations now emphasize that\n\n\n-----\n\nthere is no such thing as one hundred percent protection. Hacking attacks on large\ncompanies have become almost commonplace. And yet: No company really likes to talk\nabout having hackers in its own networks. In many cases, customers are not informed. They\nare justifiably scared of damage to their reputation.\n\nTeamviewer is a case in point. A company based in the southwest of Germany, a bona fide\nSilicon Valley contender, and a true showpiece enterprise. It was quickly traded at a ninedigit valuation, the highest accolade for a newly incorporated enterprise. Then came the\n[Winnti hackers. “Spiegel” magazine was the first to report about it.](https://www.spiegel.de/plus/teamviewer-wie-hacker-das-deutsche-vorzeige-start-up-ausspionierten-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000163955857)\n\nThe corporation offers a remote maintenance software solution which, according to\nTeamviewer, is installed on two billion devices. To imagine the mayhem a hacker might\ncause by infiltrating the end users’ devices via the Teamviewer application—it boggles the\nmind. But things didn’t get that far for Teamviewer, the company assures us. They add that\nthey replaced their entire IT infrastructure and spent millions on removing the hackers from\ntheir networks in 2016.\n\n## The second way to find Winnti\n\nFor the IT departments, the infected computers are extremely difficult to detect. That is\nbecause a new variety of this malware remains perfectly passive as long as it is left alone.\nHow can you find something that’s playing dead? Since 2018 there’s a public tool available\ndesigned to systematically trawl the Internet for these infected systems. This network scan\nworks by luring the software out of its hiding spot.\n\n\n-----",
