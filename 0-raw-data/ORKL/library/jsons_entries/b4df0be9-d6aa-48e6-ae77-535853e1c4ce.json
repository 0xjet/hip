The Ursnif family of](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0386/)\nmalware has been active for years, and current samples generate distinct traffic patterns.\n\nThis tutorial reviews packet captures (pcaps) of infection Ursnif traffic using [Wireshark.](https://www.wireshark.org/)\nUnderstanding these traffic patterns can be critical for security professionals when detecting\nand investigating Ursnif infections.\n\nThis tutorial covers the following:\n\nUrsnif distribution methods\n\n\n-----\n\nCategories of Ursnif traffic\nFive examples of pcaps from Ursnif infections\n\nNote: This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of Wireshark, and it uses a\n[customized column display shown in this tutorial. You should also have experience with](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-customizing-wireshark-changing-column-display/)\n[Wireshark display filters as described in this additional tutorial.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/using-wireshark-display-filter-expressions/)\n\n## Ursnif Distribution Methods\n\nUrsnif can be distributed through web-based infection chains and malicious spam\n(malspam). In some cases, Ursnif is a follow-up infection caused by different malware\n[families like Hancitor, as reported in this recent example.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-compromised-servers-fraud-accounts-recent-hancitor-attacks/)\n\nWe frequently find examples of Ursnif from malspam-based distribution campaigns, such as\nthe example in Figure 1.\n\n_Figure 1. Flowchart from one of the more common Ursnif distribution campaigns._\n\n## Categories of Ursnif Traffic\n\nThis tutorial covers two categories of Ursnif infection traffic:\n\nUrsnif without HTTPS post-infection traffic\nUrsnif with HTTPS post-infection traffic\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware samples from either of these categories create the same type of artifacts on an\ninfected Windows host. For example, both types of Ursnif remain persistent on a Windows\nhost by updating the Windows registry, such as the example shown in Figure 2.\n\n_Figure 2. Example of Windows registry updates caused by samples of Ursnif, either with or_\n_without HTTPS post-infection traffic._\n\n## Example 1: Ursnif without HTTPS\n\n[The first pcap for this tutorial, Ursnif-traffic-example-1.pcap, is available here. The chain of](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/training/examining-ursnif.html)\n[events behind this traffic was tweeted here. Example 1 has been stripped of all traffic not](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic/status/1203071348941246464)\ndirectly related to the Ursnif infection.\n\nOpen the pcap in Wireshark and filter on http.request as shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. The pcap for example 1 filtered in Wireshark._\n\nIn this example, the Ursnif-infected host generates post-infection traffic to 8.208.24[.]139\nusing various domain names ending with .at. This category of Ursnif causes the following\ntraffic:\n\nHTTP GET requests caused by the initial Ursnif binary\nHTTP GET request for follow-up data, with the URL ending in .dat\nHTTP GET and POST requests after Ursnif is persistent in the Windows registry\n\nThe following HTTP data is used during the traffic in our first example:\n\nDomain for initial GET requests: w8.wensa[.]at\nRequest for follow-up data: hxxp://api2.casys[.]at/jvassets/xI/t64.dat\nDomain for GET and POST requests after Ursnif is persistent: h1.wensa[.]at\n\nFollow the TCP stream for the very first HTTP GET request at 20:13:09 UTC. The TCP\nstream window shows the full URL. Note how the GET request starts with /api1/ and is\nfollowed by a long string of alpha-numeric characters with backslashes and underscores.\nFigure 4 highlights the GET request.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Example of an HTTP GET request caused by our first Ursnif example._\n\nWe can find the same pattern from Ursnif activity caused by a Hancitor infection on\n[December 10,2019. The pcap is available here. Mixed with the other malware activity, this](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/12/10/index.html)\nDecember 10th example contains the following indicators for Ursnif:\n\nDomain for initial GET requests: foo.fulldin[.]at\nRequest for follow-up data: hxxp://one.ahah100[.]at/jvassets/o1/s64.dat\nDomain for GET and POST requests after Ursnif is persistent: api.ahah100[.]at\n\nNote how patterns from Ursnif traffic in the December 10th example are similar to the\npatterns we find in example 1. These patterns are commonly seen from Ursnif samples that\ndo not use HTTPS traffic.\n\n## Example 2: Ursnif with HTTPS\n\n[The second pcap for this tutorial, Ursnif-traffic-example-2.pcap, is available here. Like our](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/training/examining-ursnif.html)\nfirst pcap, this one has also been stripped of any traffic not related to the Ursnif infection.\n\n\n-----\n\nOpen the pcap in Wireshark and filter on http.request or ssl.handshake.type == 1 as\nshown in Figure 5. If you are using Wireshark 3.0 or newer, filter on http.request or\n**_tls.handshake.type == 1 for the correct results._**\n\n_Figure 5. The pcap for our second example filtered in Wireshark._\n\nThis example has the following sequence of events:\n\nHTTP GET request that returns an initial Ursnif binary\nHTTP GET requests caused by the initial Ursnif binary\nHTTPS traffic after Ursnif is persistent in the Windows registry\n\nFollow the TCP stream for the first HTTP GET request to ghinatronx[.]com. This TCP stream\nreveals a Windows executable or DLL file as shown in Figure 6. We can export the Ursnif\n[binary from the pcap as described in this previous tutorial.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/using-wireshark-exporting-objects-from-a-pcap/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. The first HTTP GET request returning a binary for Ursnif._\n\nThe next four HTTP requests to bjanicki[.]com were caused by the Ursnif binary. Follow the\nTCP stream for the first HTTP GET request to bjanicki[.]com at 18:46:21 UTC. This TCP\nstream shows the full URL. Note how the GET request starts with /images/ and is followed by\na long string of alpha-numeric characters with backslashes and underscores before ending\nwith .avi. This URL pattern is somewhat similar to Ursnif traffic from our first pcap. Figure 7\nhighlights a GET request from our second pcap.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Example of an HTTP GET request from our second Ursnif example._\n\nUnlike our first example, Ursnif in this second pcap generates HTTPS traffic after it becomes\npersistent on an infected Windows host. Use your basic web filter as described in this\nprevious tutorial for a quick review of the HTTPS traffic. Note the HTTPS traffic to\nprodrigo29lbkf20[.]com as shown in Figure 8.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Filtering on web traffic in Wireshark, highlighting the HTTPS traffic generated by_\n_Ursnif._\n\nHTTPS traffic generated by this Ursnif variant reveals distinct characteristics in certificates\nused to establish encrypted communications. To get a closer look, filter on\n**_ssl.handshake.type == 11 (or tls.handshake.type == 11 in Wireshark 3.0 or newer). Select_**\nthe first frame in the results and go to the frame details window. There we can expand lines\nand work our way to the certificate issuer data. Figure 9 shows how to begin.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Finding our way to the certificate issuer data._\n\nAs shown in Figure 9, we expand the line for Secure Sockets Layer in the frame details\nwindow. For Wireshark 3.0, this line shows as Transport Layer Security. Then we expand\nthe line labeled TLSv1.2 Record Layer: Handshake Protocol: Certificate. Then we\nexpand the line labeled Handshake Protocol: Certificate.\n\nWe keep expanding, until we find our way to the certificate issuer data as shown in Figure\n10.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Certificate issuer data from HTTPS traffic caused by Ursnif._\n\nIn Figure 10 shown under the Handshake Protocol: Certificate line, we work our way down\nthrough the following items:\n\nCertificates (615 bytes)\nCertificate: 30820260308201c9a003020102020900c692c94106d77dfc...\nsignedCertificate\nIssuer: rdnSequence (6)\nrdnSequence: 6 items (id-at-commonName=*,id-at-organizationalUnitN...\n\nIndividual items under the rdnSequence line show properties of the certificate issuer. These\nreveal the following characteristics:\n\ncountryName=XX\nstateOrProvinceName=1\nlocalityName=1\norganizationName=1\norganizationalUnitName=1\ncommonName=*\n\n\n-----\n\nThis issuer data is not valid, and these patterns are commonly seen in Ursnif infections. But\nwhat does legitimate certificate data look like? Figure 11 shows valid data from a certificate\nissued by DigiCert.\n\n_Figure 11. Valid certificate issuer data._\n\nOne last thing about Ursnif is the IP address check by an Ursnif-infected host. This happens\nover DNS using a resolver at opendns[.]com. Like other IP address identifiers, this is a\nlegitimate service. However, these services are commonly used by malware.\n\nTo see this IP address check, filter on dns.qry.name contains opendns.com and review\nthe results as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. IP address check by an Ursnif-infected Windows host._\n\nAs shown in Figure 12, the Window host generated a dns query for resolver1.opendns[.]com\nfollowed by a DNS query to 208.67.222[.]222 for myip.opendns[.]com. The DNS query to\nmyip.opendns[.]com returned the public IP address of the infected Windows host.\n\n## Example 3: Ursnif with Follow-up Malware\n\n[Our third pcap, Ursnif-traffic-example-3.pcap, is available here. This pcap also has](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/training/examining-ursnif.html)\nunrelated activity stripped from the traffic, but it builds on our last example. Our third pcap\nincludes what appears to be decoy traffic, and it also includes an HTTP GET request for\nfollow-up malware. The sequence of events is:\n\nHTTP GET request that returns an initial Ursnif binary\nHTTP GET requests caused by the initial Ursnif binary, including decoy URLs\nHTTPS traffic after Ursnif is persistent in the Windows registry\nHTTP GET request for follow-up malware\n\n[Use your basic web filter as described in this previous tutorial for a quick review of the web-](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/using-wireshark-display-filter-expressions/)\nbased traffic as shown in Figure 13.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13. Filtering our third pcap for web traffic in Wireshark._\n\nIn Figure 13, the initial HTTP request to sinicaleer[.]com returned a Windows executable for\nUrsnif. The remaining traffic visible Figure 13 was caused by the Ursnif executable until it\nbecame persistent.\n\nThree HTTP requests to google[.]com follow similar URL patterns as Ursnif traffic to an\nactual malicious domain of ghdy656262oe[.]com. These HTTP GET requests to\ngoogle[.]com appear to be decoy traffic, because they do not assist the infection. HTTPS\ntraffic over TCP port 443 to gmail[.]com and www.google[.]com also serves no direct purpose\nfor the infection, and that activity could also be classified as decoy traffic. Figure 14 shows\nan example of the decoy HTTP GET requests to google[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14. Decoy HTTP GET request by the Ursnif-infected host to a Google domain._\n\nNote the HTTP traffic to ghdy656262oe[.]com. The first two GET requests to\nghdy656262oe[.]com return a 404 Not Found response as shown in Figure 15. The third\nHTTP GET request returns a 200 OK response, and the infection continues as shown in\nFigure 16.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15. First two HTTP GET requests to malicious Ursnif domain return a 404 Not Found_\n_response._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16. Some false starts before the Ursnif infection continues._\n\nSince the first HTTP GET request to ghdy656262oe[.]com was not a 200 OK, the infected\nWindows host cycled through other malicious domains to continue the infection. These two\ndomains are tnzf3380au[.]top and xijamaalj[.]com. However, the DNS queries for these\ndomains returned a “No such name” in response, so the infected Windows host went back to\ntrying ghdy656262oe[.]com.\n\nUse the following Wireshark filter to better see this sequence of events:\n\n**_((http.request or http.response) and ip.addr eq 194.1.236.191) or dns.qry.name_**\n**_contains tnzf3380au or dns.qry.name contains xijamaalj_**\n\nThe results should appear similar to the column display in Figure 17.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17. Filtering to show how the infected Windows host tries Ursnif-related domains_\n_before it hits a 200 OK in HTTP traffic._\n\nTo review the rest of the infection, use your basic web filter and scroll to the end of the\nresults. Figure 18 shows the post-infection traffic after Ursnif becomes persistent.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18. Post-infection traffic after Ursnif becomes persistent on the victim’s Windows host._\n\nIn Figure 18, after five HTTP GET requests to ghdy656262oe[.]com, we find traffic generated\nby the infected Windows host after Ursnif becomes persistent. This includes HTTPS traffic to\ngoogle[.]com and gmail[.]com.\n\nTraffic to vnt69tnjacynthe[.]com should have the same type of certificate issuer data we\nwitnessed in our second pcap. But this traffic includes an HTTP GET request to\ncarresqautomotive[.]com ending with .rar.\n\nThis URL ending in .rar returned follow-up malware. However, this follow-up malware is\nencoded or otherwise encrypted when sent over the network. The binary decoded on the\ninfected Windows host, which is not seen in the infection traffic. Follow the TCP stream for\nthe HTTP GET request to carresqautomotive[.]com, and you should see the same data as\nshown in Figure 19.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19. Follow-up malware sent to an Ursnif-infected Windows host._\n\nThis data is encrypted, so we cannot export a copy of the follow-up malware from the pcap.\nTherefore, we must rely on other post-infection traffic to determine what type of malware was\nsent to the Ursnif-infected host.\n\n[We have seen various types of follow-up malware from Ursnif infections, including Dridex,](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/12/02/index.html)\n[IcedID,](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/10/21/index.html) [Nymain,](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/05/03/index.html) [Pushdo, and](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/07/29/index.html) [Trickbot.](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/09/04/index.html)\n\nOur next example is an Ursnif infection with Dridex as the follow-up malware.\n\n## Example 4: Ursnif Infection with Dridex\n\n[Our fourth pcap, Ursnif-traffic-example-4.pcap, is available here. Unlike our first three](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/training/examining-ursnif.html)\nexamples, this pcap does not have unrelated activity stripped from the traffic.\n\nUse your basic web filter to get a better idea of the traffic. Your results should appear similar\nto Figure 20.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20. Traffic from our fourth pcap filtered in Wireshark._\n\nThis pcap has the same sequence of events as our previous example, but it adds postinfection activity from the follow-up malware:\n\nHTTP GET request that returns an initial Ursnif binary\nHTTP GET requests caused by the initial Ursnif binary, including decoy URLs\nHTTPS traffic after Ursnif is persistent in the Windows registry\nHTTP GET request for follow-up malware\nPost-infection activity from the follow-up malware\n\nIn this fourth example, the HTTP GET request for an initial Ursnif binary is to\noklogallem[.]com. Ursnif causes HTTP GET requests to kh2714ldb[.]com before the infection\nbecomes persistent.\n\nFigure 21 shows activity after Ursnif is persistent, where Ursnif causes HTTPS traffic to\ns9971kbjjessie[.]com. We then see an HTTP GET request to startuptshirt[.]my for the followup malware. Finally we find post-infection traffic caused by the follow-up malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21. Activity from the infection after Ursnif is persistent._\n\nOur fourth example follows the same infection patterns as our third pcap, but now we also\nhave HTTPS/SSL/TLS traffic to 94.140.114[.]6 and 5.61.34[.]51 without any associated\ndomain name. This is Dridex post-infection traffic.\n\nCertificate issuer data for Dridex is different than certificate issuer data for Ursnif. Use the\nfollowing filter to review the Dridex certificate data in our fourth pcap:\n\n**_(ip.addr eq 94.140.114.6 or ip.addr eq 5.61.34.51) and ssl.handshake.type eq 11_**\n\nNote: if you are using Wireshark 3.0 or newer, use tls.handshake.type instead of\n**_ssl.handshake.type._**\n\nSelect the first frame in the results, go to the frame details window, and expand the\ncertificate-related lines as shown by our second example in Figures 9 and 10. Examining\ncertificate issuer data from our fourth pcap should look similar to Figures 22 and 23.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 22. Working our way to the certificate issuer data in the Dridex traffic._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 23. Reaching the certificate issuer data from one of the Dridex IP addresses._\n\nUnder the rdnSequence line, we find properties of the certificate issuer. Certificate issuer\ncharacteristics for HTTPS/SSL/TLS traffic at 94.140.114[.]6 follows:\n\ncountryName=NP\nlocalityName=Kathmandu\norganizationName=Buvecoww Fftaites O.V.E.E.\norganizationalUnitName=Olfo Dusar Latha\ncommonName=ndltman-dsamutb.spiegel\n\nCertificate issuer data is different for 5.61.34[.]51, but it follows a similar style:\n\ncountryName=MU\nlocalityName=Port Louis\norganizationName=Ppoffi Sourinop Cooperative\norganizationalUnitName=ipeepstha and thicioi\ncommonName=plledsaprell.Byargt9wailen.voting\n\nThis type of issuer data is commonly seen for Dridex post-infection traffic. In our next\nexample, you can further practice reviewing certificate issuer data for Dridex.\n\n## Example 5: Evaluation\n\n\n-----\n\n[The fifth pcap for this tutorial, Ursnif-traffic-example-5.pcap, is available here. Like our](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/training/examining-ursnif.html)\nprevious example, this pcap has an Ursnif infection followed by Dridex, so we can practice\nthe skills described so far in this tutorial.\n\nBased on what we have learned so far, open the fifth pcap in Wireshark, and answer the\nfollowing questions:\n\nFor the initial Ursnif binary, which URL returned a Windows executable file?\nAfter the initial Ursnif binary was sent, the infected Windows host contacted different\ndomains for the HTTP GET requests. Which domain was the traffic successful and\nallowed the infection to proceed?\nWhat domain was used in HTTPS traffic after Ursnif became persistent on the infected\nWindows host?\nWhat URL ending in .rar was used to send follow-up malware to the infected Windows\nhost?\nWhat IP addresses were used for the Dridex post-infection traffic?\n\nAnswers follow.\n\n**Q: For the initial Ursnif binary, which URL returned a Windows executable file?**\n\n**A: hxxp://ritalislum[.]com/obedle/zarref.php?l=sopopf8.cab**\n\nThe only Windows executable file in this pcap is the initial Windows executable file for Ursnif.\nUse the following Wireshark search filter to quickly find this executable:\n\n**_ip contains \"This program\"_**\n\nThis filter should provide only one frame in the results. Follow the TCP stream for this frame\nas shown in Figure 24.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24. Filtering to find a frame with the Windows executable file and following the TCP_\n_stream._\n\nThe TCP stream window contains the domain and URL from the GET request as shown in\nFigure 25.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 25. URL info from the TCP stream._\n\n**Q: After the initial Ursnif binary was sent, the infected Windows host contacted different**\ndomains for the HTTP GET requests. Which domain was the traffic successful and allowed\nthe infection to proceed?\n\n**A: k55gaisi[.]com**\n\nUse your basic web filter for an overview of the web traffic. HTTP requests caused by this\nvariant of Ursnif start with GET /images/ as already seen in examples two, three, and four of\nthis tutorial. The first HTTP request to k55gaisi[.]com at 15:36 UTC is noted in Figure 26. But\nif you follow the TCP stream, it shows a 404 Not Found as the response.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 26. Searching web traffic for HTTP GET requests caused by Ursnif._\n\nAlso shown in Figure 26, the next HTTP GET request for an Ursnif-style URL is to\nbon11ljgarry[.]com at 15:37 UTC. The HTTP stream for that request reveals a redirect to a\nURL at www.search-error[.]com.\n\nScroll down further, and for similar traffic to leinwqoa[.]com as noted in Figure 27.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 27. Finding another Ursnif-style URL that redirects to a search error page._\n\nScroll down further to find four HTTP GET requests to k55gaisi[.]com that return 200 OK\nresponses. From this point, the Ursnif infection proceeds, and we find no further Ursnif-style\nHTTP requests that start with GET /images/.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 28. Finding the Ursnif-style HTTP GET requests that return a 200 OK._\n\n**Q: What domain was used in HTTPS traffic after Ursnif became persistent on the infected**\nWindows host?\n\n**A: n9maryjanef[.]com**\n\nWhen Ursnif is persistent, we no longer see Ursnif-style HTTP requests starting with GET\n/images/. Instead, we find Ursnif-related HTTPS traffic. Shortly after the final Ursnif-style\nHTTP GET request, HTTPS traffic to n9maryjanef[.]com begins on 185.118.165[.]109 as\nhighlighted in Figure 29. This is Ursnif traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 29. HTTPS traffic caused by Ursnif._\n\nYou can confirm this is Ursnif traffic by filtering on ip.addr eq 185.118.165.109 and\n**_ssl.handshake.type == 11 and reviewing the certificate issuer data. The certificate issuer_**\ndata should look the same as our second example in Figure 10.\n\n**Q: What URL ending in .rar was used to send follow-up malware to the infected Windows**\nhost?\n\n**A: hxxps://testedsolutionbe[.]com/wp-content/plugins/apikey/uaasdqweeeeqsd.rar**\n\nHTTP GET requests caused by Ursnif for follow-up malware end in .rar, so use the following\nfilter to find this URL in our pcap:\n\n**_http.request and ip contains .rar_**\n\nThe results should be similar to what we see in Figure 30.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 30. Finding the URL for follow-up malware from this Ursnif infection._\n\nNotice in Figure 30 how the HTTP GET request in Figure 30 redirects to an HTTPS URL.\n\n**Q: What IP addresses were used for the Dridex post-infection traffic?**\n\n**A: 185.99.133[.]38 and 5.61.34[.]51**\n\nOne of these IP addresses is the same as Dridex in our fourth pcap, and it has the same\ncertificate issuer data. Dridex traffic to 185.99.133[.]38 has the same style of certificate issuer\ndata as seen in example 4. Traffic to both IP addresses does not involve a domain name.\n\nThe Dridex post-infection traffic is easy to spot in this example if we look for any\nHTTPS/SSL/TLS traffic without a domain after the HTTP GET request ending in .rar as\nshown in Figure 31.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 31. Finding the Dridex traffic in our fifth pcap._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis tutorial provided tips for examining Windows infections with Ursnif malware.
