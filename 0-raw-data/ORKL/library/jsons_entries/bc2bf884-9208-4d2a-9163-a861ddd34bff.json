This advisory provides details on the](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/)\ntop 15 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) routinely exploited by malicious cyber\nactors in 2021, as well as other CVEs frequently exploited.\n\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities assess, in 2021,\nmalicious cyber actors aggressively targeted newly disclosed critical software vulnerabilities\nagainst broad target sets, including public and private sector organizations worldwide. To a\nlesser extent, malicious cyber actors continued to exploit publicly known, dated software\nvulnerabilities across a broad spectrum of targets.\n\nThe cybersecurity authorities encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the\nMitigations section of this CSA. These mitigations include applying timely patches to systems\nand implementing a centralized patch management system to reduce the risk of compromise\nby malicious cyber actors.\n\nDownload the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: 2021 top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities (pdf,\n777kb).\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nGlobally, in 2021, malicious cyber actors targeted internet-facing systems, such as email\nservers and virtual private network (VPN) servers, with exploits of newly disclosed\nvulnerabilities. For most of the top exploited vulnerabilities, researchers or other actors\nreleased proof of concept (POC) code within two weeks of the vulnerability’s disclosure,\nlikely facilitating exploitation by a broader range of malicious actors.\n\nTo a lesser extent, malicious cyber actors continued to exploit publicly known, dated software\n[vulnerabilities—some of which were also routinely exploited in 2020 or earlier. The](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-209a)\nexploitation of older vulnerabilities demonstrates the continued risk to organizations that fail\n\n\n-----\n\nto patch software in a timely manner or are using software that is no longer supported by a\nvendor.\n\n**Top 15 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities**\n\nTable 1 shows the top 15 vulnerabilities U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK\ncybersecurity authorities observed malicious actors routinely exploiting in 2021, which\ninclude:\n\n**CVE-2021-44228. This vulnerability, known as Log4Shell, affects Apache’s Log4j**\nlibrary, an open-source logging framework. An actor can exploit this vulnerability by\nsubmitting a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system that causes that system to\nexecute arbitrary code. The request allows a cyber actor to take full control over the\nsystem. The actor can then steal information, launch ransomware, or conduct other\nmalicious activity.[1] Log4j is incorporated into thousands of products worldwide. This\nvulnerability was disclosed in December 2021; the rapid widespread exploitation of this\nvulnerability demonstrates the ability of malicious actors to quickly weaponize known\nvulnerabilities and target organizations before they patch.\n**CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-27065. These**\nvulnerabilities, known as ProxyLogon, affect Microsoft Exchange email servers.\nSuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities in combination (i.e., “vulnerability\nchaining”) allows an unauthenticated cyber actor to execute arbitrary code on\nvulnerable Exchange Servers, which, in turn, enables the actor to gain persistent\naccess to files and mailboxes on the servers, as well as to credentials stored on the\nservers. Successful exploitation may additionally enable the cyber actor to compromise\ntrust and identity in a vulnerable network.\n**CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-31207. These vulnerabilities, known**\nas ProxyShell, also affect Microsoft Exchange email servers. Successful exploitation of\nthese vulnerabilities in combination enables a remote actor to execute arbitrary code.\nThese vulnerabilities reside within the Microsoft Client Access Service (CAS), which\ntypically runs on port 443 in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) (e.g.,\nMicrosoft’s web server). CAS is commonly exposed to the internet to enable users to\naccess their email via mobile devices and web browsers.\n**CVE-2021-26084. This vulnerability, affecting Atlassian Confluence Server and Data**\nCenter, could enable an unauthenticated actor to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable\nsystems. This vulnerability quickly became one of the most routinely exploited\nvulnerabilities after a POC was released within a week of its disclosure. Attempted\nmass exploitation of this vulnerability was observed in September 2021.\n\n[Three of the top 15 routinely exploited vulnerabilities were also routinely exploited in 2020:](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-209a)\nCVE-2020-1472, CVE-2018-13379, and CVE-2019-11510. Their continued exploitation\nindicates that many organizations fail to patch software in a timely manner and remain\nvulnerable to malicious cyber actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 1: Top 15 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities in 2021_\n\n\n**CVE** **Vulnerability**\n**Name**\n\n\n**Vendor and Product** **Type**\n\n\nCVE-202144228\n\nCVE-202140539\n\nCVE-202134523\n\nCVE-202134473\n\nCVE-202131207\n\nCVE-202127065\n\nCVE-202126858\n\nCVE-202126857\n\nCVE-202126855\n\nCVE-202126084\n\nCVE-202121972\n\nCVE-20201472\n\n\nLog4Shell Apache Log4j Remote code\nexecution (RCE)\n\n\nZeroLogon Microsoft Netlogon Remote\nProtocol (MS-NRPC)\n\n\nZoho ManageEngine AD\nSelfService Plus\n\n\nRCE\n\n\nProxyShell Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of privilege\n\nProxyShell Microsoft Exchange Server RCE\n\nProxyShell Microsoft Exchange Server Security feature\nbypass\n\nProxyLogon Microsoft Exchange Server RCE\n\nProxyLogon Microsoft Exchange Server RCE\n\nProxyLogon Microsoft Exchange Server RCE\n\nProxyLogon Microsoft Exchange Server RCE\n\n\nAtlassian Confluence Server and\nData Center\n\n\nArbitrary code\nexecution\n\n\nVMware vSphere Client RCE\n\n\nElevation of privilege\n\n\n-----\n\n**CVE** **Vulnerability**\n**Name**\n\nCVE-20200688\n\nCVE-201911510\n\nCVE-201813379\n\n\n**Vendor and Product** **Type**\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server RCE\n\n\nPulse Secure Pulse Connect\nSecure\n\n\nArbitrary file reading\n\n\nFortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy Path traversal\n\n\n**Additional Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities**\n\nIn addition to the 15 vulnerabilities listed in table 1, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand,\nand UK cybersecurity authorities identified vulnerabilities, listed in table 2, that were also\nroutinely exploited by malicious cyber actors in 2021.\n\nThese vulnerabilities include multiple vulnerabilities affecting internet-facing systems,\nincluding Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA), Windows Print Spooler, and Pulse Secure\n[Pulse Connect Secure.

Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities, especially those](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\nCVEs identified in this CSA, and then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for\nremote code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment. For patch\ninformation on CVEs identified in this CSA, refer to the appendix.\n\nIf a patch for a known exploited or critical vulnerability cannot be quickly applied,\nimplement vendor-approved workarounds.\nUse a centralized patch management system.\nReplace end-of-life software, i.e., software that is no longer supported by the vendor.\nFor example, Accellion FTA was retired in April 2021.\nOrganizations that are unable to perform rapid scanning and patching of internet-facing\nsystems should consider moving these services to mature, reputable cloud service\nproviders (CSPs) or other managed service providers (MSPs). Reputable MSPs can\npatch applications—such as webmail, file storage, file sharing, and chat and other\nemployee collaboration tools—for their customers. However, as MSPs and CSPs\nexpand their client organization's attack surface and may introduce unanticipated risks,\norganizations should proactively collaborate with their MSPs and CSPs to jointly\nreduce that risk. For more information and guidance, see the following resources.\n\nCISA Insights [Risk Considerations for Managed Service Provider Customers](https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/cisa-insights_risk-considerations-for-msp-customers_508.pdf)\nCISA Insights Mitigations and Hardening Guidance for MSPs and Small- and Midsized Businesses\nACSC advice on How to Manage Your Security When Engaging a Managed\nService Provider\n\n**Identity and Access Management**\n\nEnforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users, without exception.\nEnforce MFA on all VPN connections. If MFA is unavailable, require employees\nengaging in remote work to use strong passwords.\nRegularly review, validate, or remove privileged accounts (annually at a minimum).\nConfigure access control under the concept of least privilege principle.\n\nEnsure software service accounts only provide necessary permissions (least\nprivilege) to perform intended functions (non-administrative privileges).\n\n**Note: see** [CISA Capacity Enhancement Guide – Implementing Strong Authentication and](https://cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_CEG_Implementing_Strong_Authentication_508_1.pdf)\n[ACSC guidance on Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication for more information on](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/implementing-multi-factor-authentication)\nhardening authentication systems.\n\n**Protective Controls and Architecture**\n\n\n-----\n\nProperly configure and secure internet-facing network devices, disable unused or\nunnecessary network ports and protocols, encrypt network traffic, and disable unused\nnetwork services and devices.\n\nHarden commonly exploited enterprise network services, including Link-Local\nMulticast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),\nCommon Internet File System (CIFS), Active Directory, and OpenLDAP.\nManage Windows Key Distribution Center (KDC) accounts (e.g., KRBTGT) to\nminimize Golden Ticket attacks and Kerberoasting.\nStrictly control the use of native scripting applications, such as command-line,\nPowerShell, WinRM, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and\nDistributed Component Object Model (DCOM).\nSegment networks to limit or block lateral movement by controlling access to\napplications, devices, and databases. Use private virtual local area networks.\nContinuously monitor the attack surface and investigate abnormal activity that may\nindicate lateral movement of a threat actor or malware.\n\nUse security tools, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security\ninformation and event management (SIEM) tools. Consider using an information\ntechnology asset management (ITAM) solution to ensure your EDR, SIEM,\nvulnerability scanner etc., are reporting the same number of assets.\nMonitor the environment for potentially unwanted programs.\nReduce third-party applications and unique system/application builds; provide\nexceptions only if required to support business critical functions.\nImplement application allowlisting.\n\n## Resources\n\nFor the top vulnerabilities exploited in 2020, see joint CSA Top Routinely Exploited\nVulnerabilities\nFor the top exploited vulnerabilities 2016 through 2019, see joint CSA Top 10 Routinely\nExploited Vulnerabilities.\nSee the appendix for additional partner resources on the vulnerabilities mentioned in\nthis CSA.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.
