The report follows our Cyber Events Summary Report of 2018 and\npresents changes and developments in the political and economic scenes as well, as these has had a crucial impact on the\n\ncyber arena.\n\nIn recent months we have observed multiple targeted ransomware attacks against major companies, including\ninternational corporations – undoubtfully, this is the most significant attack vector of the first half of 2019. The main\npenetration vector in these attacks includes the use of decoy email carrying malicious content and RDP (Remote Desktop\nProtocol) attack. In our assessment, this year RDP has become a significant vector through which computer systems are\n\ninfected worldwide.\n\nThe most notable example of targeted ransomware operation is the Norsk Hydro Attack which we classified as the most\nsignificant attack of the first half of 2019. Forensic investigations covering the attack on Norsk Hydro, as well as other\n\ncompanies who suffered from similar incidents, revealed an extensive attack infrastructure aided by sophisticated, evasive\ntools and designated zero-day vulnerabilities. And indeed, the LockerGoga ransomware infrastructure has managed to\ninfiltrate hundreds of companies worldwide and extort tens of millions of USD. Norsk Hydro alone stated that the damage\n\ncaused by the attack is estimated at around 75 million USD.\n\n###### Significant increase of targeted ransomware attacks on large companies and organizations globally\n\nBehind several of these attacks are nation-state actors that execute ransomware attacks with the end goal of causing harm\n\nrather than financial gain. Several of the most notable ransomware attacks so far are – Norsk Hydro, ASCO, SonAngol and\n\nVerint. In contrast to the rising popularity of targeted ransomware, destructive ransomware attacks – in which the files are\ncorrupted without a recovery option – were not reported during the first half of 2019. This could be the result of intense\n\nhindering collaborations between agencies worldwide.\n\n###### Increase of BEC (Business Email Compromise) attacks\n\nThis type of an attack, in which the attacker traditionally impersonates an executive in the company or a third-party\n\nprovider, is the most common type of attack globally. According to the latest data from the FBI, as of June 2018, BEC scams\nhave compromised over 12 Billion dollars globally.[1] This figure is expected to continue rising in 2019. On the past two\nmonths, attackers begun leveraging AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems to impersonate senior employees' voices and\nexecute financial transactions, resulting in immediate losses of millions of euros.\n\n###### More Attacks against financial institutions\n\nIn 2019, financial institutes and banking users are still a desirable target for tailored cyber-attacks aimed at financial\nrevenue. However, while the trend continues, we did not see a sharp increase in the attack rate. This appears to be a direct\nresult of the considerable effort and resources invested by the banks in mitigating cyber threat conjunction with attackers\ntargeting more profitable and less secure targets such as crypto-currency platforms. In 2019 these platforms continue\n\nsuffering hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, being the most targeted financial platform to date. Alongside that, a\n\n1 https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180712.aspx\n\n\n-----\n\nnotable decrease in the rate of attacks targeting SWIFT system was observed – most likely as a result of the great effort\ninvested by the security industry into protecting these systems.\n\n###### Social media platforms combat the fake news phenomena\n\nWe have seen over the last six months considerble efforts by social media platforms to identify and take down fake-news\nsources and actors, by conducting both vast investigative efforts and routine take down actions, little by little. While this\nactions don't fully neutralize the phenomena, they do play a crucial role in raising awareness.\n\n###### Attack attempts against Internet of Things (IoT) systems and SCADA Systems\n\nOver the last six months we have seen alarming rise of threats to industrial IoT (Internet of Things) or ICS systems. Of note,\nvarious threat actors targeting power-grids. The most prominent actors in this regard are the USA and Russia. For example,\nTriton malware which was used in the attack on the Saudi oil refineries is currently being attributed to Russia\n\n###### Escalation of the Digital Cold War between the US, Russia and China\n\nThe recent developments of a \"digital cold war\" between the US, China and Russia - amongst others - were a key event on\n\nthe global cyber arena during the first half of 2019. Political conflicts resulted in immediate actions in the cyber landscape\n\nand led to parallel efforts by many power countries to possess designated SCADA malware, as well as the ability to cripple\ntheir adversaries' power facilities in preparation for a time of need. For the first time, Trump administration employees\n\nreported that a payload developed in the US was planted in Russia's power network .\n\nOne of the most outstanding results of this state his can be seen in the continued weaponization of social media platforms\n\nto propagate disinformation on a massive scale, and rapid proliferation of advanced malware. The latter in particular has\nfacilitated new threats against service providers, alongside critical infrastructure.\n\nAccordingly, these nations and their allies have begun taking major mitigation actions; be them economic such as\nembargoes and global trade restrictions, or technological such as new plans to implement an \"internet kill-switch\".[2] These\n\nand other developments are largely reactionary backlash following large-scale campaigns on numerous industries and\nsectors, including critical infrastructure, large industrial operations, and military organizations.\n\n###### More and more countries are claiming almost direct responsibility for major attacks\n\nThis is likely in an attempt to create deterrence and signals the next stage in the digital cold war – \"who is a bigger\n\nthreat/can cause the most amount of damage\". Alongside the deterrence efforts we continue to see exposures of Critical\nzero-day vulnerabilities that pose a threat to global computer networks, such as the BlueKeep flaw. We believe that Russia\nwill likely attempt exploiting these vulnerbilities to execute a massive cyber attack in the vain of NotPetya.\n\n###### Increase in Iranian cyber capabilities alongside the expansion of their cyber operations against foreign countries\n\nWith this regard, we also saw Iran expanding their operation into new regions. The increase in Iranian offensive operations\nin the cyber arena is aligned with the escalation of the conflict between Iran and the United States, concerning the Nuclear\ndeal violation, the US sanctions and more.\n\n2 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/russia-passes-bill-internet-cut-off-foreign-servers\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\n**The Most Prominent Attack of 2019 – Norsk Hydro Corporation and Other Companies Attacked by the LockerGoga**\n\n**Ransomware** **6**\n\n**Cyber Attacks On The Global Finacial Sector** **8**\n\nCentral Bank of Malta Breached - likely a SWIFT Attack;

The attack took place in the firm's factories in the US and\nled to a shutdown of all their computer systems. It also partially damaged the manufacturing systems in additional\n\nlocations around the world. As a result, some factories had to switch to manual operation, slowing the manufacturing\n\nprocess and resulting in significant financial losses.\n\nThis is the first LockerGoga ransomware attack to gain global public attention. Recent findings indicate that the over 1,200\n\ncompanies were attacked by the ransomware to this point, most of them global corporations with multiple R&D and\n\nmanufacturing centers. Prior to these attacks, the known use of LockerGoga took place on January 24, 2019, against the\nFrance-based engineering firm Altran.[3]\n\nIt should be noted that while the ransomware has successfully infected multiple targets, it was not always activated.\n\nNevertheless, infected companies may still be in danger as the attackers have gain access to their networks, and could\nleverage it for additional malware infection or offer it for sale to the highest bidder on underground forums. The damages\n\ncould me immense. The companies whose files were encrypted by Locker Goga suffered direct losses tens of millions of\n\nUSD and additional indirect losses. In the case of Norsk Hydro, for example, the estimated damage caused by the attack as\nof the end of July is 75 million USD.\n\n###### Attack Vector\n\nAccording to the Norwegian Cert, \"NorCert\", the Norsk Hydro ransomware infection was probably conducted manually,\nafter the attackers gained access and achieved persistency on the company network – an operation which probably took\nseveral months to complete. On March 19, probably several minutes after midnight, the encryption process of multiple\n\ncomputers and servers had begun.\n\nAs a result, some 9,000 machines were encrypted and ceased to function. The initial intrusion vector appears to have\nincluded a large number of actions including Brute Force attacks on the company's RDP servers, SQL Injection attacks on\ncompany sites, exploiting a number of zero-day vulnerabilities and privilege escalation on sensitive systems, obtained\nthrough sophisticated phishing attacks. Part of the attack included logging out of vital control systems and locking\n\nemployees' accounts. Consequently, the IT staff was unable to mitigate the event. The firm probably physically\n\n3 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-lockergoga-ransomware-allegedly-used-in-altran-attack/\n\n\n-----\n\ndisconnected part of the network in an attempt to slow down the attack, which made it more difficult to realize the full\nextent of the damage.\n\nAccording to analysis by Nozomi Network Labs[4] the ransomware is capable of encrypting the following type of files: DLL,\nppt, pot, pps, pptx, potx, ppsx, sldx and pdf. Similar cyber-attacks using other ransomware families, such as Ryuk and\n\nMegaCortex, had also been observed.\n\n###### Cloud Email Services enabled Functional Survivability\n\nThe firm's email services remained protected throughout the attack because the Norsk Hydro email system is based on\nMicrosoft 365, a cloud service. Consequently, they were able to continue basic operations and maintain contact with\nclients. The employees logged in to their email accounts via personal smartphones and tablets, so some work flow was\nmaintained, and recent orders could be retrieved from the clients. The manufacturing systems were disconnected from\nthe computers and were operated manually.\n\n###### The Attackers \n\nAs of early mid-July 2019, the common estimation is that a well-funded Russian threat group is responsible for the attack.\nAn initial analysis released by Kaspersky[5] states that some parts of the ransomware file can be affiliated to Russian\n\ncybercrime group called GrimSpider. The investigation is still in process, however based on the attack stages – which\nincluded preliminary network research, zero-day vulnerability exploit and neutralization of security systems – there is no\n\ndoubt this was a targeted attack.\n\nAccording to an estimation of a research team for the Dutch government, at least two threat groups collaboration together\nare behind the attack. Their findings offer three possible motives for the attack. The first motive is financial, because after\n\nthe attack victims were prompted to pay the ransom demand, and were threatened to have the access obtained by the\n\nattackers sold to other attackers. Another assessment suggests an espionage motive, relying on the fact that some of the\nattacks contained internal information. The third assessment is that this campaign was carried out for the purpose of\n\ndestroying and damaging critical infrastructure. It is important to note that currently there are no definite findings\n\nsupporting this, but at this stage it cannot be ruled out.\n\nSeveral days after the attack on Norsk Hydro was reported, American chemicals companies Hexion and Momentive\n\nrevealed that they too fell victim to a LockerGoga ransomware attack. The two companies, who are controlled by the same\ninvestment fund \"Apollo Global Management\"[6] both suffered an attack on March 12; six days before the attack on Norsk\nHydro.\n\n4 https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3072839/norsk-recovers-some-systems-following-confirmed-ransomware-breach,https://www.nozominetworks.com/pressrelease/nozomi-networks-expands-ics-cyber-security-research-with-labs-launch/\n\n5 https://twitter.com/JusticeRage/status/1109065147186847745?s=08\n\n6 https://www.apollo.com/\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Cyber Attacks On The Global Finacial Sector\n\n##### Central Bank of Malta Breached - likely a SWIFT Attack; Loss of 13 Million Euro\n\nOn February 13, 2019, the central bank of Malta (BOV), which also operates as a commercial bank for half of Malta's\n\npopulation, identified that it fell victim to a cyber attack, which resulted in a loss of €13 million.[7] Note that the attack was\n\ndetected by anti-fraud systems, and not by the security systems. Immediately after detecting the theft, the bank decided\n\nto shut down all of its systems: ATMS, credit card payment terminals, business owners' equipment, email and telephone\n\nservices, their website, even shutting down all of their branches in Malta. The shut-down was in effect until the attack was\nneutralized and the affected systems were recovered.\n\nThe exact date during which the attack was executed is unclear as of early March. Nevertheless, it should be noted that\n\nsince the bank did not report that it was able to retrieve the stolen funds, the attack was most likely carried out at least\nthree days prior to the reveal (On February 10th, when the bank is closed). During the attack, 11 transactions were carried\n\nout, most likely via the SWIFT system, to accounts in the US, UK, Czech Republic and Hong Kong. The sum of the\n\ntransactions amounted to 13 million euros. Also, worth mentioning is that the finds were transferred to Western countries.\nThis is interesting as usually attackers try to transfer money to countries with less adequate monitoring systems.\n\nThe indirect damage included total shutdown of the bank's services for over 24 hours – a situation which hurt all its clients\n\nand credit card companies. Also, a significant amount of business owners use the bank's services, and their systems were\nshut down as well. The bank stated that its clients were not affected, as their funds and accounts remained unchanged. It\nalso stated that it is working to \"clean\" its systems, and to bring back its services back to normal. On February 14th, the\napp and website returned to full activity. This attack (the first of its kind in 2019) is reminiscent of Russian and North\nKorean attack groups' ongoing attacks on core banking systems. Similar to other cases, these groups choose to attack\nbanks in countries with inadequate security systems.\n\n##### Large-Scare Spoofing Campaign Impersonating Major US Banks' IP addresses\n\nA report published in late April revealed a large-scale spoofing campaign targeting US banks. According to the researchers,\nthis campaign was detected due to heavy internet traffic caused by broad scans of the internet. More interesting however\n\n7 https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/92964/bank_of_valletta_shuts_down_operations_following_cyber_attack_#.XGew2yuWXDu\n\n\n-----\n\nis that the scans were conducted via spoofed IP addresses of big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America\nand SunTrust.[8] Currently the reason behind this is unknown, but CyberScoop conjectures that this was executed in order\nto disrupt the banks' security teams and cyber security companies' ability in mitigating malicious activity.\n\nThe campaign appears to have taken place between April 19, 2019 – April 23, 2019. The spike in traffic-spoofing started on\n\nFriday the 19[th] and continued until late Tuesday the 23[rd].\n\n###### Analysis of the attack\n\nAccording to Security researcher Andrew Morris, the volume of traffic is too low to be a DDoS attack. Instead he claims that\nit is possible that a malicious actor attempted to fool firewalls and other security products into blocking traffic originating\n\nfrom the banks, with the purpose of embarrassing security vendors. Further, while Traffic spoofing are common attacks,\nthey rarely target specific entities, as was in this case. A list of the spoofed IP addresses was uploaded to Pastebin but has\nsince been removed.[9]\n\nInitial investigation, conducted by BRICA (Business Risk Intelligence & Cyberthreat Awareness), indicates that the attackers\n\nsent spoofed TCP packets, but made no attempt to complete the three-way-handshake. This was because they only\nattempted to flood security vendor with false positive. With that in mind, based on this incident, security vendors could\nuse this attack in order to better their monitoring and blocking rules for each of their clients.[10]\n\nMitigating such attacks is problematic and complex. If a security service or product blocks internet scans, you should verify\nthat the blocked IP addresses are the source of the scan. Note however that this is not an option with of SYN() and FIN()\n\npackets. It is possible to create whitelists in order to prevent false positive, however it should be taken in to account that it\n\nis impossible to create a global whitelist.\n\n##### Chile-based Interbank Network Redbanc Attacked \n\nRedbanc is a Chile-based company responsible for connecting the ATMs of all the banks in Chile. On December 2018, the\ncompany was attacked using the PowerRatankba malware, affiliated with the North Korean APT group Lazarus. Findings\nabout the malware family were published on January 15[th] by Flashpoint.[11]\n\nThe Lazarus APT group is commonly associated with Bureau 121 – the cyber warfare unit of the North Korean regime. The\ngroup gained publicity thanks to its aggressive worldwide campaigns on 2009. It specializes in attacks targeting financial\ninstitutions and services, including banks and cryptocurrency exchange platforms, many of them in South America and\n\nEast Asia.\n\nThe attack begun when in IT expert at Redbanc was infected by malware after opening on a message that was sent to him\nvia a social media platform, probably LinkedIn, allegedly containing a job offer. Upon clicking the link to apply for the job,\nthe IT expert was referred to a decoy job application page. To gain the victim’s trust, a Lazarus representative had a job\ninterview in Spanish with the expert. A day later the company announced it had been breached.\n\nApparently, while attempting to apply for the job the victim downloaded a file called ApplicationPDF.exe’ seemingly a\nrecruiting software. The executable is included in ThreadProc and SendUrl processes, which process parameters encoded\nin Base64 and run the malicious code. The downloaded file decoded the parameter code encoded in Base64,\ncommunicated with the server and run the PowerShell code in a hidden window. During the infection process, another PS\n\n8 https://www.cyberscoop.com/spoofed-bank-ip-address-greynoise-andrew-morris-bank-of-america/\n\n9 https://web.archive.org/web/20190422210240/https://pastebin.com/LrKKam3y\n\n10 https://brica.de/alerts/alert/public/1256953/recent-bank-ip-address-spoofing-exposes-problem-with-how-some-threat-feeds-are-generated/\n\n11 https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/disclosure-chilean-redbanc-intrusion-lazarus-ties/\n\n\n-----\n\nscript is executed that decrypts a script created by PowerRatankba. The malware serves as a both a downloader and a\nspyware, in charge of collecting information to be used in further attacks by Lazarus.\n\n##### Attack on British Metro Bank Exploiting a Vulnerability in the Two-factor Authentication System\n\nOn February 1[st], it was reported that UK’s Metro Bank has fallen victim to a sophisticated attack that bypassed the twofactor authentication (2FA) by exploiting a SS7 vulnerability. The authentication system sends SMS messages with codes\n\nfor confirming clients' financial transactions. It appears that the attackers reached clients' devices by remotely tracking\n**devices and monitoring clients' SMS messages that request confirmation for transactions.**\n\nSS7 protocol is used for routing calls and SMS and is used by telecommunication firms worldwide. By exploiting a\nvulnerability on the protocol, attackers are able to intercept messages and thus obtain clients' location and personal\n\ninformation through their cellphones. Metro Bank stated that only a few clients were affected, and no one lost money\nfrom their accounts. Metro Bank is cooperating with the relevant communication providers and the authorities to\n\ninvestigate the attack. The bank advises its clients to be alert and report any activity which seems suspicious.\n\n##### European Banking Authority Report on SMS 2FA-Based Financial Transactions\n\nFollowing the attack the UK National Cyber Security Center stated that exploiting such vulnerabilities is a known method\n\nwhich has already been used previously. It is a common attack vector used in fraud campaigns and in cellphone espionage\nattacks. The website InfoSecurity reviewed a similar attack which took place in May 2017, and assessed that using SMS\n\nmessages for 2-Factor authentication is no longer reliable identification method. It is recommended to use authenticator\napps or Time-based One-time Password algorithm (TOTP) for 2-Factor Authentication in order to avoid such attacks[12].\n\nFurthermore, in June the European Banking Authority (EBA) recently published an opinion report on the elements of\n\nstrong customer authentication systems for financial transactions. Below is an excerpt regarding SMS-based 2FA\n\nauthentication.\n\n\"As stated in the EBA Opinion on the implementation of the RTS (paragraph 35), a device could be used as evidence of\npossession, provided that there is a ‘reliable means to confirm possession through the generation or receipt of a dynamic\n\nvalidation element on the device’. Evidence could, in this context, be provided through the generation of a one-time\npassword (OTP), whether generated by a piece of software or by hardware, such as a token, text message (SMS) or push\nnotification. In the case of an SMS, and as highlighted in Q&A 4039, the possession element ‘would not be the SMS\n**itself, but rather, typically, the SIM-card associated with the respective mobile number’\"**\n\nBelow are the 2FA alternatives suggested by the EBA (note – most relay on biometric identifiers).\n\n12 https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/flaw-in-ss7-lets-attackers-empty/\n\n\n-----\n\nDespite this report, several large banks in Germany have already began implementing stronger 2FA authentication process\nfor financial transactions, phasing out the less secure SMS-based systems.[13] These new measures have been strongly\npushed by European regulators in recent years.\n\nSMS Transaction Authentication Number (aka SMS-TAN, or mTAN) is the most commonly used method by banks to\nauthenticate financial transactions by issuing temporary passwords via SMS messages.[14] Attackers however have been\nmanipulating this procedure to unlawfully execute transactions from bank customers. Cryptocurrency companies have\n\nalso suffered from these attacks, losing tens of millions of dollars in recent months alone.\n\nAccordingly, over the last few years various governing bodies (such as the German BSI - Federal Office for Information\nSecurity) have warned financial institutions and customers from using this technology. The most attack vectors are\n\nphishing or sim swapping.\n\n###### New verification methods\n\nBelow are the new methods employed by German banks to verify transactions:\n\n  - ChipTAN – issuing Tokens by the bank to verify transactions.\n\n  - PhotoTAN – mobile apps that provide a unique barcode to work in conjunction with the SMS messages.\n\n  - PushTAN – verification via an app operating as a Token. For example, Google authenticator and Microsoft\nauthenticator. It is unclear whether this method meets the European Banking Authority standards.\n\n  - Digital Signature – using smart encrypted cards.\n\n##### 65 Million USD From a Bank in Kuwait\n\nIn late March, rumors began spreading on Twitter about a 65 million USD theft from a bank in Kuwait via its SWIFT system.\nHowever, as of early July, no official announcement had been published by any bank. Over the course of the last few\nweeks we have been tracking the case via social media, bank portals and VirusTotal, in which we used to detect malicious\nfiles uploaded from Kuwait. Related indicators and rumors that the bank in question is the Gulf Bank of Kuwait were\nrevealed in Twitter. The bank published a statement on March 27 claiming its systems had run into technical difficulties\nthat damages its international money transfer system (probably the SWIFT system). No cyber-attack was mentioned.\n\n13 https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2019/07/12/german-banks-sms-tan/\n\n14 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_authentication_number\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Cyber Attacks On The Fin-Tech and Crypto Firms\n\n##### Advanced Spy-Malware Campaign Targeting FinTech Companies \n\nOn March 19[th], Palo Alto's research team Unit42 revealed a new attack campaign against FinTech firms via an espionage\n\nmalware (RAT) named Cardinal RAT. The campaign probably occurred over the last two years and was first detected in\nJanuary 2019.\n\n###### Malware Analysis\n\nCardinal RAT malware family was first identified in 2017 when Unit42 exposed a limited attack campaign (27 known\nsamples). Since then, the research team continued to monitor the malware and recently identified a new version (1.7.2)\n\nwith several changes, including advanced obfuscation functions which hinder detection and analysis.\n\nThe main obfuscation technique is based on steganography which obfuscates malicious content inside an embedded\nBitmap (BMP) image file. When the .NET based malware is executed, it extracts a malicious DLL file from the image's pixels.\n\nIt then deciphers it with a single-bit XOR encryption key.\n\nLike previous versions, Cardinal RAT has many capabilities:\n\n  - Data collection on the infected system.\n\n  - Changing system settings.\n\n  - Executing commands remotely in the infected system.\n\n  - Downloading and executing files without permissions.\n\n  - Exploiting the infected system as a reverse proxy.\n\n  - Downloading updates to the malware.\n\n  - Retrieving passwords.\n\n  - Keylogging and screenshot capturing.\n\n  - Erasing cookies from browsers.\n\n  - Deleting the malware from the infected system.\n\n###### Possible link to EVILNUM malware & attack vector\n\nWhen the researchers examined the samples uploaded to VirusTotal, they identified a possible connection to a malware\nfamily named EVILNUM; a JavaScript based malware that collects information and achieves a foothold in the systems and\n\n\n-----\n\nnetworks before using Cardinal RAT. Note that this malware was identified in only a small number of firms, similarly to\nCardinal RAT.\n\nIn the campaigns of both of the malwares, the infection vector was carried out with a malicious phishing document which\nwere very similar to one another. This document usually contained lists of names and numbers (the type of numbers was\n\nnot mentioned, but possibly telephone numbers) of people who work in the forex and cryptocurrency sector.\n\n##### Cryptocurrency Attacks 2.0\n\nIn late 2017, the cyber security community watched in awe as Crypto Mining malware, most notably web-based scripts,\ntook the world by storm and climbed to the top of various Global Top malware charts. The frenzy begun with the infamous\ncase of The Pirate Bay. The Pirate Bay is the world’s largest BitTorrent indexer – it is a massive online source for digital\ncontent including movies, games and software.\n\nShortly after the first web-based Crypto Miners spurred, it has been discovered that The Pirate Bay had planted a crypto\nmining JavaScript that secretly utilizes the website visitors' computer resources to mine the Monero Cryptocurrency while\nvisiting the portal.[15]\n\nWebsite owners nowadays depend on advertising revenue to survive; however the user experience can be highly\ninterrupted by the appearance of multiple advertisements on the content page. The birth of JavaScript-based crypto\n\nminers offered another solution – instead of burdening the users with flashy ads, a website owner can simply embed a\n\nJavaScript within the website html page which mines a cryptocurrency using the visitor's CPU power and generate a\nrespectful revenue. While this tactic sounds effective, to separate it from malicious activities carried out on the user\n\nbrowser unknowingly such as browser hijacking, transparency is required.\n\nIt is expected of a website owner to notify its visitors that an alternative process is taking place in order to spare them the\ninconvenience of online advertisements. Unfortunately, the simplicity of the use of the script, which only required\n\nembedding, rather than distribution and infection, led to giant wave of hackers that exploited legitimate, high profile\n\nwebsites to embed a web-based Crypto Miner without the website owner's knowledge.\n\nUnlike website owners, attackers use as much as 90% of the user's CPU power to mine cryptocurrency. Top websites\n\nexploited for mining in the past include a Los Angeles Times website and a Jerusalem Post website, as well as 4,000\n\ngovernment websites in the US, UK and Australia.\n\nThe success of web-based crypto miners was boosted by two key trends:\n\n1. The sharp rise in the value of many cryptocurrencies. The first cryptocurrency that gained popularity and led to a\n[significant market growth was BitCoin. Its popularity led to the development of many additional digital currencies](http://pages.checkpoint.com/cryptocurrency-cyber-security.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=cp%20website&utm_term=crypto&utm_campaign=CM_WR_17Q3_WW_Cryptocurrency%20Hero)\nsuch as Ethereum, Monero and Litecoin. Monero is often preferred by attackers due to the relatively lights\nresources required to mine it.\n\n2. The rise in the required resources. As time passed and crypto mining gained popularity, the computational\n\nresources needed to mine new crypto coins grew higher. Specialized hardware, or a mass number of personal\ncomputers combined became a necessity.\n\nAfter a long period of Crypto Mining malware, especially web-based scripts, dominating the cyber landscape, it seems safe\nto say that the golden age of this type of attack is behind us. As 2018 progressed, the prices of BitCoin and along with it\n\n15 https://thehackernews.com/2017/09/pirate-bay-cryptocurrency-mining.html\n\n\n-----\n\nmost other coins, fell significantly, rendering the process of mining it unprofitable. As always, cyber criminals found\nanother way to leverage the cryptocurrency market for monetization, taking the attack to the next level.\n\nLately, we have been observing a new vector of attack leveraging cryptocoins - Cryptocurrency exchange attacks.\nProminent attack vectors used recently to target Cryptocurrency Exchanges are the following –\n\n1. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, capable of shutting down the entire trading activity of the exchange\nfor a limited time thus preventing transactions, lowering the value of the coins and damaging the reputation of\nthe portal. In June 2018, one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges suffered a DDoS attack that ceased\nthe activity of the exchange for three hours.\n\n2. Phishing attacks – simple yet effective, phishing attacks can be useful in this case as well. Using tailored content,\n\nattackers could lure an employee into granting them access to the exchange network, thus enabling information\nand credential theft.\n\n3. Transaction malleability attacks, in which the attacker alters the transaction ID of a BTC transaction and uses it to\n\ncarry out a transaction of his wish. If attackers are able to change a transaction ID without invalidating it, they\ncould perform a transaction of their own from the sender's wallet. The sender would think that the transaction\n\nhas failed, when in fact, it had already taken place before the failure.\n\n4. Online Wallet attacks – wallets that are connected to the internet are often offered by exchange portals for\n\nsecured storage of private keys of cryptocurrencies. while many of them state they use offline resources to store\n\nthe keys it is not always the case, making them a tempting target.\n\n###### Binance Data Breach leads to Theft of 40 million USD\n\nIn May 2019, some 40 million USD worth of BitCoins were stolen from one of the most popular coin exchange portals,\n\nBinance. The company admitted that 7,000 BitCoins were stolen from its storage, and that the attackers managed to\n\nbypass two-factor authentication processes. Binance is considered as the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in\nterms of trading volume.\n\nShortly after in June 2019, the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange, Bitrue, reported a massive data breach which\n\nled to losses of 4.5 million USD from customer funds. The hacker exploited a vulnerability in the company's security\nprocedures to steal private wallet information and to collect coins from approximately 90 wallets.\n\n###### 32 million USD Stolen in a Breach of the Japanese Exchange BitPoint \n\nJust recently one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchange hacks took place as 32 million USD worth of cryptocurrency were\nstolen from the Japanese exchange BitPoint in July. At least 23 million USD worth of coins were customers funds, and the\ncompany admitted that coins were stolen from both its \"hot wallets\", used for trading, and its \"cold\"; wallets, which are\nused for secured storage and should be much less accessible.\n\nLastly, as of May 2019 ClearSky has been investigating a newly-discovered extensive operation which targets\nCryptocurrency exchange portals using quality spear-phishing techniques. The attackers use misspelled domains carrying\nthe names of Google and Amazon services to lure its targets into visiting their pages, as well as well-written and designed\n\nWord documents with the logo of the attacked exchange and matching content, or alternatively, some general information\nabout cryptocurrency trading.\n\nThe Word files we found were password protected, but the password was attached inside the zip folder in a txt file. Upon\nexecution, the Word file reaches out to a URL shortened via the bit.ly service. Then, after gaining access to machines within\nthe cryptocurrency exchange network, we believe that multiple actions are conducted to steal as much funds as possible\nfrom the exchange, causing immense damage to the company.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ClearSky Investigation – Operation CryptoCore: Attack Infrastructure Targeting Crypto Firms\n\nAs part of our ongoing investigations we detected in May a password protected word file that references the\n\ncryptocurrency exchange HitBtc[16]. We found that it is most likely part of an infrastructure that contains numerous\naddresses, domains, and sub domains with similar properties:\n\n  - All the domains we detected in the infrastructure are disguised as Google services (drive, mail, sheets, docs) and\nare written with spelling mistakes.\n\n  - Most of the Doc files communicate with the URL shortening service bit.ly, most likely in order to try to conceal the\ncommunication attempts.\n\n  - In the address line, after the TLD this routing always appears: -*. 8080/open?id\n\nAt this stage the penetration vector is unknown. When we pivoted the domain and the address it is stored on, we reached\nother domains and addresses which share identical properties.\n\nAs of now analysis of the files did not reveal the attack vector, but we can infer that it is based on a large and dedicated\n\ninfrastructure. We recommend adding the attached indicators into the organization's monitoring systems. Moreover, since\nthe domains have names that appear legitimate but are actually malicious, we recommend presenting them to\n\nemployees, and make sure they are mindful of the links they open.\n\n###### Additional files\n\nIn early July we identified new IP addresses attributed to this infrastructure. After carrying out additional investigation, we\ndetected an empty word file sample that communicates to the domain named service[.]amzonnews[.]club, which is\n\nhosted on a server with the address 75[.]133[.]9[.]84. The file named \"Introduction to the World Blockchain\nAssociation.doc\", was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil on June 26[th], and was identified as malicious by 5 antivirus\nengines.[17]\n\n16 https://hitbtc.com/\n\n17 https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/583cf86894e47a81fa914fdc46fa6587807cf17f9196160625b149d47560f9b0/submissio\n\n\n-----\n\n#### The Digital Cold War\n\nThe Deterrence theory, which gained prominence during the Cold War, states that an inferior force, with lower destructive\ncapabilities, could deter a more powerful adversary as long as it maintains the ability to protect itself against a surprise\nattack. It is based on the fear from reprisal, and as such, the deterrent weapon must be ready, but not necessarily used in\n\nfull force.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, a unique malware has hit the industrial safety systems of a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia.[18]\nThe malware was designed to manipulate the Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) – by altering the system\n\ncontrollers to a failed safe state the entire industrial system automatically shuts down.\n\nThe SIS controllers are the last line of defense against physical disasters in Industrial Control Systems, meant to kick in if\n\ndanger is detected. Therefore, their proper detection capabilities are a key to the function of the entire system, and if they\nare not intact, real danger is posed to the facility employees and surrounding. Considering the dangers petrochemical\n\nplant poses, makes the malware even more of a milestone in the cyber threat timeline. Dubbed Triton, in late 2018 the\n\nmalware was attributed to a Russian Government-Owned institution – The Central Scientific Research Institute of\nChemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM).[19]\n\nWhile the security community had been made aware of the threats posed to Industrial control systems, Triton follows a\n\nsmall number of publicly exposed incidents in which a malicious software successfully infected an Industrial Control\nSystem. The most recent one would be Industroyer, which targeted Ukraine’s power grid and deprived a part of Kiev of\n\npower for an hour. Some believe that the implementation of the malware was a test, in preparation a real need.\n\nIndustroyer followed the Notorious Stuxnet, that in 2010 damaged Iran's centrifuges in the process of separating nuclear\nmaterial.\n\nThe first half of 2019 demonstrates that The Deterrence theory is now more relevant than ever, with a new weapon in its\ncore – a full-power SCADA attack; the ability to cripple a national infrastructure by sabotaging its core systems, thus\npreventing its civilians and leaders from accessing vital services and perform, daily functions.\n\nIn March 2019, it has been reported that the authors of the Triton malware are now on researching additional targets in\nNorth America and other parts of the world.[20] While a big SCADA attack has not been observed, the attack timeline detailed\nabove makes it clear that it is only a matter of time until a radical move in the global political sphere will lead to a\nprecedent. It is now clear that an expanding number of entities, most of them government-backed, are possessing or in the\ndevelopment process of malware capable of affecting such infrastructure.\n\n18 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/12/attackers-deploy-new-ics-attack-framework-triton.html\n\n19 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/10/triton-attribution-russian-government-owned-lab-most-likely-built-tools.html\n\n20 [https://dragos.com/resource/xenotime/](https://dragos.com/resource/xenotime/)\n\n\n-----\n\nJust like the nuclear deterrence theory, we believe that powerful countries – notably Russia and the United States – are\nnow realizing that possessing such abilities, mainly on the systems used by their adversaries', as a key part of the up-todate global deterrence equation.\n\n###### The escalation of the digital cold war\n\nCyber espionage capabilities have been a key part of silent, under the radar battles between power countries, including\nthe United States and Russia, for quite a few years now. For example, the infamous Stuxnet malware uncovered in 2010 is\nsaid to be a part of a joint Operation between The Unites States and Israel against Iran's nuclear program. In 2014, Ukraine\nsuffered a massive cyber-attack targeting its government networks, as well as a cyber attack against Ukrainian Army's\nRocket Forces and Artillery. Both of these attacks have been attributed to Russian actors.\n\n###### Russia\n\nRussia is known for its use of cyber espionage, Denial of Service (DoS) and destruction tools as part of its territorial and\npolitical conflicts – the diplomatic row with Estonia in 2007, the Russo-Georgian War in 2008 and the Russian military\n\nintervention in Ukraine as of 2014.\n\nThere is no doubt that the key turning point in the Russia-United States cyber dispute was the 2016 United States\npresidential elections. In 2015 an attack against the American Democratic National Committee (NDC) led to the leakage of\nalmost 20,000 private emails.[21] It was shortly followed by additional exfiltration attacks to the Democratic Congressional\n\nCampaign Committee (DCCC), and Clinton campaign officials. These acts is affiliated with Russia's Main Intelligence\nDirectorate, commonly known as the GRU. Russian institutions are known for their vast interference in the 2016 elections\n\nwith the goal of harming the leading democratic candidate, Hilary Clinton, and boosting the president Donald Trump.\n\nThe main vector of intervention observed around the elections is undoubtfully disinformation campaigns, mostly referred\nto as 'fake news'. On the months prior to the elections, Russian companies and activists carried out an immense operation\n\nsocial media campaign meant to distribute their propaganda. The campaigns used thousands of designated fraudulent\n\nsocial media accounts and online advertising space to promote events in support of Trump, radical political groups and\nClinton opponents. These accounts were managed by a troll farm disguised under the name The Internet Research Agency\n\n(IRA), most likely linked to the Kremlin.\n\nAlthough the Russian interference actions were widely investigated by the United States Congress and the FBI, similar acts\ntook place again on the 2018 presidential mid-term elections. However, this time, the United Scape Cyber Command\nresponded with an offensive campaign against the IRA.[22] The operation rendered the farm entirely offline during Election\n\nDay and is considered one of the most aggressive publicly reported campaigns launched by the Cyber Command.\n\nIn late 2018, ClearSky investigators revealed an extensive and well-managed Iranian disinformation infrastructure used by\nthe to distribute modified content in over 28 countries[23]. The Russian disinformation campaign filled an important role in\nthe global cyber landscape, as it raised great awareness to the unprecedented impact of fake news campaigns. In 2019, we\ncan clearly state that the public knowledge of the presence of fake news on all social media channels is as high as it could\n\nbe.\n\nThe Cyber Command's takedown on the IRA marks a milestone in the history of cyber. However, the first half of 2019 marks\nin ever greater escalation in the use of cyber warfare as part of the United States-Russia tension. For the first time, Trump\nadministration officials reported that US software code was deployed inside Russia's power grid and other targets.[24] While\n\n21 https://www.wired.com/2016/07/heres-know-russia-dnc-hack/\n\n22 https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/26/18241600/us-cyber-command-russian-troll-farm-attack-election-day-2018\n\n23 [https://www.clearskysec.com/global-iranian-disinformation-operation/](https://www.clearskysec.com/global-iranian-disinformation-operation/)\n\n24 https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/us-russia-cyber-attacks-trump-power-grid-putin-kremlin-a8960681.html\n\n\n-----\n\nthe operation is meant to display power and warn President Vladimir V. Putin, the Kremlin states that this act means there\nis a hypothetical possibility of a cyber war.\n\nTo conclude, the below examination of the change in the United States-Russia cyber conflict demonstrates that cyber\nwarfare acts, whether committed by hacktivists or nation-sponsored groups, have become an actual possibility, and an\n\nintegral part of the civilians' everyday lives.\n\n###### China\n\nChina has been implementing aggressive political and economic moves in recent years with the aim of becoming the\nworld's leading power country within the next decade. Three prominent Chinese programs in this regard are the following:\n\n  - Made in China 2025 – An aggressive government program that promotes the development to a China as a hightech power country by developing, manufacturing and purchasing local technologies.[25]\n\n  - Belt and Road (aka ‘One Belt, One Road’) – A government program that promotes the development of road and\n\nrail infrastructure across 152 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. This project has been criticized\nby many parties around the world who claim corruption and exploitative conditions affecting long-term\n\ncountries, as well as blatant use of the project to promote Chinese interests around the world at the expense of\n\nvarious countries. For this reason, this program was called Debt-trap diplomacy.\n\n  - World Leading Programs in the development and supply of 5th Generation Mobile Internet Technologies - 5G.\n\nIn light of these plans, we have seen a spike in Chinese APT attack campaigns targeting the private, political and security\n\nsectors worldwide as of 2018. In this context, we must mention the infamous supply chain attack against HP and IBM\ncarried out by APT10, the theft of sensitive British and US government military documents from military suppliers and the\n\ntheft of advanced commercial developments from technology companies and academic institutions around the world.\n\nIn October 2018 a long-term espionage campaign which took place from 2010 to 2015 was unveiled by the Chinese\ngovernment's intelligence agency - MSS (Ministry of State Security).[26] During the campaign at least 12 aerospace\n\ntechnology companies were hacked. Among other things, intellectual property had been stolen with the aim of assisting\n\nChinese government companies in developing a new jet engine. This incident is one of many industrial espionage activities\ncarried out by Chinese actors in an attempt to gain intellectual property from Western companies to promote Chinese\n\nproduce.\n\nOne of the major events, which is still ongoing, is the confrontation between the US government and the Chinese\ntelecommunications company Huawei. This confrontation includes the arrest of Meng Wangzhuo - CFO and daughter of\n\nthe company's founder. This happened in tandem with the imposition of trade restrictions with Huawei, which could\ndisrupt the international operations of a company's cellular and computer divisions, and lead to 30 billion USD in losses. In\nparallel to these events, both countries have declared protective tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in import and\nexport. As of mid-July 2019, these restrictions are planned to be removed, but the company's future is still unclear. [27]\n\nIt is important to remember that most large Chinese companies have close ties to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).\nWhen it comes to Huawei, founder and CEO of Ren Zhengfei is a party member and is closely related to state president Xi\nJinping. Accordingly, every action Huawei does is primarily aimed at promoting China. Although officially Huawei and\nother Chinese companies such as ZTE are private companies, the US government has defined them as \"an arm of the\nChinese government\".\n\n25 https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcoannunziata/2018/08/10/seven-steps-to-success-or-failure-for-made-in-china-2025/\n\n26 https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1106491/download\n\n27 https://gizmodo.com/huawei-still-on-commerce-department-blacklist-reporte-1836359551\n\n\n-----\n\nIn October 2018, Bloomberg Businessweek magazine published an article stating that China has installed spyware on 30\nmajor Western technology companies, among them Amazon and Apple.[28] All companies involved have denied this claim\nand at the same time no additional evidence has been revealed. Due to the vast dependency of Western companies in\nmanufacturing in China, this concern seems to be pointing to a probable espionage vector. In light of this, in August 2018,\n\nthe US government banned operational civilians and soldiers from wearing wearable technology, including smart\nwatches, which could collect information such as location, record Audio or take pictures.[29]\n\n###### Middle East and Gulf Countries\n\nThe escalation in the use of cyber warfare tactics by power countries can also be observed in other regions of the world,\nand is integrated in political conflicts worldwide. An example of this is the crash of a UAE military spy satellite launched by\n\nthe European Space Agency (ESA). This incident, which occurred last July, is still under investigation. However, preliminary\nfindings suggest possible tampering.\n\nAdditionally, Russian military activity in Syria involving GPS jamming has begun to hit the Middle East and Israel airspace\nover the past year. Intelligence agencies estimate that Russian cyber operations are not aimed at Israel, but still pose a\n\nsecurity risk due to its proximity to the conflict area and tensed status with Syria. It should be noted that, as of July 2019,\n\nthese disruptions only affect civil systems and do not affect Israeli military frequencies operating used by secure and\nencrypted networks.\n\n###### Conclusions\n\nTo summarize, the escalation of the cyber conflict between the United States, Russia and China may lay the foundations\n\nfor a future cyberspace war. Whether it is a state-of-the-art technology institute or highly motivated hackers, the beginning\n\nof 2019 introduces a rise in the use of cyber warfare tools and an increase in the rate of the references to this arena in the\nglobal daily discourse.\n\n28 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies\n\n29 https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/08/06/devices-and-apps-that-rely-on-geolocation-restricted-for-deployed-troops/\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Russian and Chinese APT Cyber Activity\n\n##### Russian APT activities\n\n###### Law Enforcement Operations - What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger\n\nOne of the most notorious APT groups of our time is the FIN7 hacking group, and for a good reason. It is estimated that the\n\nactor has managed to collect over a billion USD from companies worldwide, and over 12 million credit card numbers from\n\nthousands of businesses. Top countries impacted by the theft operations are the United States, Australia, the United\nKingdom and France, and among the hacking group's victims are major companies such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Arby's.\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue and Emerald Queen Casino.\n\nThe FIN7 group has been around since at least 2015 and has been conducting large-scale, quality payment card data theft\noperation. Their monetization technique is based mainly on a prominent card shop. Attacks carried out by the group\n\nusually target Point-of-Sale (PoS) systems, however, when a targeted organization uses systems secured with end-to-end\nor point-to-point encryption layers, the group often attacks the finance department within the organization network.\n\nFIN7's persistence and prominence in the cyber landscape can be credited to their innovative and adaptive nature – the\ngroup often alters its attack techniques, such as the file type of the attachments sent as part of phishing campaigns, or the\nfile extension of the files launched afterwards as part of the infection. Their malware campaigns are usually initiated by a\ntailored phishing email sent to a company employee, which includes an attachment. The email would include businessrelation content that would require the recipient to open the attachment in order to receive details about the inquiry.\nEmails are sometimes accompanied by supporting phone calls.\n\nAnother key step taken by the group to ensure the success of their campaigns is the use of digital certificates. By signing\ntheir decoy documents with legitimate certificates, the group is able to bypass many security controls. This supports\n\nmultiple evasion techniques taken by the group, such as changing obfuscation types, AV engines coverages tests and\n\nmore.\n\nSurprisingly, on August 1[st], 2018, the United States District Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington\nuncovered that several individuals suspected of being in leadership positions within the FIN7 cybercrime group had been\narrested. All three of them - Dmytro Fedorov, 44; Fedir Hladyr, 33 and Andrii Kolpakov, 30, are Ukrainian nationals. They\n\n\n-----\n\nwere charged with 26 felony counts of alleged aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, computer hacking, access device fraud\nand conspiracy.\n\nDespite the major takedown step taken by the United States authorities against the alleged group leaders, it appears that\nthe group has not ceased action. Researchers reported recently that since the arrest, FIN7 has targeted approximately 130\n\ncompanies worldwide using spear-phishing campaigns and delivering the GRIFFON malware, a JavaScript backdoor. In\nthis case as well, campaigns operations were able to gain the trust of their victims using well-written, business-related\ncontent.\n\nThe group runs a seemingly-legitimate operation which includes the of fake companies to hire professionals such as\nvulnerability researchers and penetration testers. Evidently, their procedures are organized enough to enable them to\n\ncontinue functioning even without their leaders. It has a clear purpose, a successful record and a drive – to generate the\ngreatest revenue, keep avoiding detection and utilize new social engineering tactics, unfamiliar to the business sector\nemployees.\n\nAnother notable case demonstrating the persistence of APT groups is revolving around the OilRig group. In March 2019, the\nactor suffered a great data leak as part of which hacking and espionage tools, as well as C&C components, target lists and\n\nstrategies. However, no signs of an operation shutdown were observed, and researchers believe that the group will\n\ncontinue acting against targets in the middle east and worldwide, while developing a brand-new toolset.\n\nBoth cases teach us in the cyber security community that sometimes, separating the leaders from the group is not enough\n\nto stop a powerful cybercrime infrastructure from functioning. Over the past few years, professional APT group such as the\n\nRussia-oriented APT28 (Sofacy), the Iran-oriented OilRig and FIN7, have established their presence in the cyber landscape,\ngenerating massive damages to businesses and government organizations worldwide. While we expect to see more\n\ntakedown attempts by state authorities against these groups during 2019, we also believe that these arrests alone are not\n\nenough.\n\n###### Threat groups APT28 and Sandstorm Targeting European Governments\n\nRussia's interference with political procedures worldwide in the cyberspace is on the rise. The first notable incident, which\nmade headline and raised public awareness as for the Russian involvement in the political landscape, was the infamous\n\ndata leak from the Democratic National Committee prior to the 2016 presidential elections on the United States. The hack,\n\nin which almost 20,000 sensitive emails were made public, is attributed to the Sofacy group, also known as APT28 – a\ngroup linked to the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. This hack was followed by aggressive fake news campaigns\nspread throughout the social media, which promoted the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.\n\nAnother noteworthy attack targeting a political entity is the NotPetya ransomware attack which took place in June 2017. In\nthis attack, government offices, banks, a city airport and even the power utility of Kiev were severely attacked by a new,\nfast-spreading type of ransomware later dubbed NotPetya. The malware features were significantly based on the NSA\ntools leak. The attackers, most likely the Russian government-backed group Sandworm, infected the update servers of a\npopular software business in Ukraine and propagated via its software updates.[30]\n\nIn the first half of 2019, we are witnessing the continuance of this line of action, as both APT28 and Sandworm had targeted\nEuropean government-related institutions with spear-phishing emails ahead of the European Parliament elections in May\n2019. Researchers reported that emails containing links to seemingly-legitimate websites were sent to government\npersonnel across Europe in order to lure them into changing their passwords and thus providing their credentials to the\nattackers. Similarly to the United States attack, the attacks primarily targeted democratic institutions in Europe, but\n\n30 https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2019/90643/\n\n\n-----\n\nelection campaigns, think tanks and non-profit organizations promoting agendas related to democracy and public policy\nwere also attacked.\n\n###### Fake Software Update Used in a Turla APT Campaign Against Government Targets\n\nIn January this year, ESET investigators tracked a new espionage campaign by Turla, a government-backed Russian group\nthat has been operating since at least 2014 against former USSR countries.[31] As part of the campaign, the group used social\nengineering to convince its targets to download and run a supposedly legitimate Adobe Flash Player containing a\nBackdoor. The victims think they are referred to the official Adobe site to download a legitimate update, but in reality the\ntraffic is redirected to the attacker’s server and behind the scenes a malicious file is downloaded. According to the report,\nmost of the targets were political factors.\n\nResearchers ruled out the option that Adobe's official servers were hacked and used for malware download. They\nspeculate that MitM (Man in the Middle) attacks were used as part of the attack chain. There are several ways that may\nconstitute Turla's attack vector:\n\n  - Local MitM - Using enterprise machines that are already under the Turla’s control as an intermediary between the\n\nvictim machines and the server that stores the malware, by performing ARP Spoofing.\n\n  - MitM on the gateway of the attacked organization - Interception of the entire organization's traffic through\nutilization of the corporate gateway rather than through specific stations.\n\n  - MitM at the ISP level - the group's intervention takes place outside of the attacked organization’s network. There\n\nhave been previously reported cases of malware distribution using this attack vector.\n\n  - BGP Hijacking attack – redirection of traffic by manipulating the routing table, thus altering the route to the\n\nADOBE official servers so that communication passes through a point that belongs to the group.\n\nOnce control of the victim machine is obtained, the collected information is translated to Base64 and sent to a domain\nunder the attacker’s control. Collected information includes a username, a list of security software installed on the\n\nmachine and the routing table. Parallel to the malicious activity, inquiries of legitimate Adobe addresses and domains\n\noccur, as a means of disguise. Once the infection process is complete, a legitimate Adobe Flash Player version is\ndownloaded and installed, coming from an unofficial source like Google Drive.\n\nIn recent months Turla has begun to develop new advanced malware and attack techniques. According to recent findings\nfrom July, the group distributes a new Dropper called Topinambour, which performs further malware downloads. It also\n\nfeatures data exfiltration capabilities. Turla implements a number of evasion and defense mechanisms. For example, it\ndevelops versions of the malware in several different coding languages (JavaScript, .NET, and PowerShell) – Thus, if one\nversion fails another one is executed.\n\n###### Financial Institutions Attacked by Russian Attack Groups via Cloud Services \n\nAt the end of January, Netskope researchers discovered a wave of attacks aimed at some 42 entities linked to the financial\nsector and government agencies around the world. The attacker, most likely Cobalt Strike[32], used Google Cloud Platform\n\n(GCP) to distribute malware through PDF files that were created using Adobe Acrobat 18.0 and then emailed. The company\nalerted Google on January.\n\n31 https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ESET_Turla_Mosquito.pdf\n\n32 https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/multiple-cobalt-personality-disorder.html\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the first stage of the attack, the victims received malicious emails that contained PDF files that were automatically\nuploaded to legitimate cloud services (Google Drive, for example). The emails were sent from legitimate and reliable\nsources to lure the victim to open the email and file. The victims then shared the PDF with other users who received it\nthrough the cloud services, and therefore found it reliable. The PDF files contained a link to a Word file called “Doc102018\n\n[.] Doc” which contained macros. When the Word file is run, a message pops up that asks the user to enable editing. After\nthe message is approved, a macro file downloads a file named fr.txt is downloaded from the transef [.] Biz / fr.txt address.\n\n##### Chinese APT activities\n\n###### The International Civil Aviation Organization Concealed a Major Cyber Attack by APT27\n\nJust recently it was revealed that during 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) experienced a cyber\nattack caused by poor management and negligence in the face of the event[33]. The attackers achieved a foothold in ICAO's\nnetwork for several months, and by attacking ICAO, the attackers were able to reach a Turkish government website. The\n\nattackers planted a malware which targets governments and airlines was in two servers. Researchers discovered security\n\nloopholes in the network which were neglected. Four employees from the IT department hid evidence and mishandled the\nincident.\n\nThe incident was discovered in November 2016, when a researcher from Lockheed Martin contacted the information Security\n\nofficer at ICAO to alert them about two infected severs. The researcher stated in his alert that it was a significant event with\n\na high risk against the aviation sector. The ICAO Information Security Officer (CISO) received the alert and instructed to shut\ndown the infected servers. However, the IT team refused to do so, and ignored the request for a long time. The firm\n\nauthorized a forensic investigation on the severs only after two weeks.\n\nDuring the whole time since the discovery of the attack, the IT employees did not cooperate with the officer's instructions,\n\nand even took out classified information to their homes. A high-ranking official in the company rejected the\nrecommendations to investigate the IT team's performance, and they were even reemployed. The attackers were able to\n\nattack foreign government websites through ICAO because of the security loopholes.\n\n###### The attackers’ identity\n\nThe researchers assume that the Chinese attack group APT27 (also known as Emissary Panda) is responsible for the attack.\n\nThe group is known for espionage and attacks against foreign governments, embassies, and technology and defense\norganizations. They are also known for watering hole attacks by injecting malicious code into government websites.\n\n  - The attackers gained 2000 critical systems passwords like email servers and accounts with high permissions\n(domain admin and sys admin).\n\n  - They could read, send, and delete emails from every user in the organization.\n\n  - They obtained personal information about all present and past employees.\n\n  - They obtained medical information of anyone who used ICAO's health clinic.\n\n  - They stole personal and financial information from anyone who visited the ICAO building, or that was even\nsubscribed to the website.\n\n33 https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1155312/oaci-onu-virus-hacker-cyberattaque-montreal-organisation-aviation\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Norwegian Cloud Service Firm Visma Hacked by Chinese Group APT10\n\nTecherati posted details about an attack by the Chinese attack group APT10, which is a part of the CloudHopper attack\ncampaign[34]. The Norwegian firm Visma, which provides cloud solutions for over 850,000 clients around the world,\n\nexperienced a breach in their network already in August 2018. According to a report posted by Rapid7 and Recorded\nFuture, the attack was carried out by the Chinese attack group APT10[35]. We express doubts about attributing the attack to\nthis group with full certainty.\n\nThe attack was designed to attack cloud services to obtain user's information. The attackers stole the login details from\nCitrix and LogMeIn (used by Visma employees) about two weeks after the first propagation in the firm's network. They then\n\nused these login details to distribute a malware which spread to several computers in the firm's network and enabled\naccess to sensitive information.\n\nThe attackers used the attack tool Mimikatz (named pd.exe) in order to steal login details. They made use of scheduled\ntasks via the Microsoft BITSAdmin utility to transfer files from their C&C to the Visma network. Examination of network logs\n\nrevealed an employee’s credentials were stolen and used to authenticate to the network outside of his normal working\n\nhours. Throughout August 2018, the attackers regularly logged in to the Visma network during typical Chinese working\nhours.\n\nTwo weeks after the initial intrusion into the network, APT10 implanted their malware, Tochilus. In order to this, they used\n\na C&C server that communicates with Salsa20 and RC4 encryption. After entering into the system, the attackers reached\n\ninformation on the Visma systems by using WinRAR files which were transferred to a Dropbox account. APT10 has already\nused Dropbox previously.\n\nThis attack method raises concerns amongst many companies in the Western world, since they rely on cloud services.\n\nVisma’s operations and securities manager Espen Johansen told Reuters that the attack was halted before client networks\n\nwere breached.\n\n34 https://techerati.com/news-hub/chinese-state-hackers-attack-norwegian-cloud-computing-firm/\n\n35 https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0206.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ClearSky Investigations – Analysis of Iranian Cyber Operations \n\nOn March 7, 2019, a malicious email was sent to an employee of an Israeli security company which provides products and\nservices to the military and aerospace industries in Israel. The attack was investigated by us in collaboration with\nadditional security researchers. The investigation led us to conclude that the actor behind the attack is the North Korean\nAPT group Lazarus. Lazarus is a threat group operating under the support and supervision of the North Korean regime. The\nmain goal of the group is financial gain and intellectual property theft – Lazarus APT is constantly trying to steal foreign\nmoney to make up for the economic difficulties the country has encountered following the imposition of sanctions by\nWestern countries.\n\nThe most prominent attacks associated with Lazarus include the Sony Pictures breach on 2014 and the WannaCry\ndestruction attack on 2017, in which the networks and services of giant companies around the world were shut down due\nto a ransomware. Affected companies include Honda, the Spanish Telephone Network, the UK's NHS (National Health\nService) network and the Russian Ministry of the Interior.\n\n###### The Attack Chain \n\nBelow is the malicious email sent to the employee:\n\nThe message was sent between two employees via organization’s internal email system. This meant that the attackers\nalready had gained access to at least one internal email account in the company - and that they were trying to exploit the\naccess he had gained for spreading and infecting computers within the company network. It should be noted that the\ncompany's internal network is not connected to its external network, making it even more difficult for an attacker to gain\naccess to the internal system.\n\n###### Exploiting RARLAB WinRaR – CVE-2018-20250\n\nThe email contained the following attachment – SysAid-Documentation.rar\n###### (062801F6FDBDA4DD67B77834C62E82A4)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file exploits the vulnerability assigned CVE-2018-20250[36], which was revealed by Check Point in February 2019. If the\narchive file is opened using a vulnerable version of WinRaR software, the vulnerability lead to the installation of an\nexecutable file (exe) on the machine that could allow an attacker to run a malicious file on a machine using remote access.\nIn the case in question, when the file is opened a Backdoor is installed, which allows the attacker to access the computer.\n\n###### Malware Analysis\n\nThe malware (96986B18A8470F4020EA78DF0B3DB7D4) is a backdoor which functions as a payload on the infected\ncomputer. It is a relatively small executable file - 96.5 KB in size. The malware attempts to communicate with a number of\nC&C servers hardcoded in its code. A malware sample can be found in the following link [https://app.any.run/tasks/64b8f3a9-0c58-4583-8605-78f4faa9ea37/](https://app.any.run/tasks/64b8f3a9-0c58-4583-8605-78f4faa9ea37/)\n\nThe following is the list of addresses contacted by the malware to obtain additional commands or to download a second\nstage malware:\n\nThe reaches out to a domain in many cases and to an IP address directly in others. We assess that the attackers did not\nestablish a designated attack infrastructure. Instead, they hacked these addresses and utilized them for the attack. This\n\n36 [https://research.checkpoint.com/extracting-code-execution-from-winrar/](https://research.checkpoint.com/extracting-code-execution-from-winrar/)\n\n\n-----\n\ncould be a demonstration of the attack method adopted by the group. Using this method, the attackers are spared the\nneed to invest resources in acquiring infrastructure.\n\nThe User Agent used by the malware appears to be fake, as it does not match a genuine User Agent - and can therefore be\nused as an indicator of the malware's malicious traffic:\n\n###### Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727;\n SLCC&C; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E) Attribution to the Lazarus APT\n\nBased on overlap in code snippets, file structure and file behavior, we believe the malware in question is linked to the\nLazarus attack group.\n\n###### Code Overlap\n\nAn examination of the malware in the Intezer system allowed us to detect similarities in the executable code files. The\nexamination revealed a 10% overlap in the code of our malware with a malware known to be used by the Lazarus group.[37]\n\nIntezer also pointed out an overlap between the following two malware samples:\n\nf3bd9e1c01f2145eb475a98c87f94a25\n\n2e17b048c7e317da9024a86d9439c74b\n\nThese samples appear in the McAfee report about the Lazarus Group released in December 2018.[38] The report sheds light\non an operation dubbed \"Operation Sharpshooter\" that targeted the security, telecommunications and critical\ninfrastructure sectors worldwide. The campaign took place during October and November 2018 during which 87\norganizations from 24 countries were attacked. The purpose of the campaign according to the report is espionage and\ndata theft from the above-mentioned sectors. These attacks were based on the distribution of a maliciously crafted Word\n\n37 [https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/7f80d1ad-a4ea-4eb9-8aea-cac5fec03161](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/7f80d1ad-a4ea-4eb9-8aea-cac5fec03161)\n\n38 [https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-operation-sharpshooter.pdf](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-operation-sharpshooter.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nfile that impersonated a resume, using Dropbox. Although the content was written in English, it is edited in Korean a Word\nversion. After opening the document a Shellcode is run.\n\n###### Overlap in Meta Data and Behavior\n\nInvestigating possible similar malware samples revealed that the malicious file properties are similar and that there are no\nother similar files. To verify this hypothesis, we performed a VirusTotal search that included some of the file properties and\ntwo additional ones: loading the ‘ObtainUserAgentString’ function, and a file size smaller than one MB. The query results\nconfirmed our hypothesis that the files were uniquely similar, as the query detected only two files - the file reviewed in this\nreport and the file reviewed in the McAfee report.\n\nWe detected further similarities in the structure and style of the C&C servers, their location at the end of the executable file,\nand similar properties surrounding them, as can be seen in the text strings of the malicious files. To the right is the file\nreviewed in the McAfee report and to the left is the file reviewed in the current report:\n\n###### The Lazarus APT\n\nThe North Korean group Lazarus (also known as APT38 and Hidden Cobra) is one of the most active APT groups of the last\ndecade. Among its most notable attacks are the 2016 attack on the Bangladesh Central Bank and the attacks against the\nBithumb and Coincheck cryptographic exchange portals during 2018.\n\nThe group is associated with the North Korean government, and thus possess many resources and uses sophisticated and\naggressive methods and self-developed tools. Unlike many other APT groups, Lazarus does not hesitate to carry out\ndestruction operations in order to destroy evidence. Among the group’s most famous malware families are\nPowerRatankba, Hangman and Positron.\n\nWhile Lazarus attacks many sectors to achieve different goals, most of its attacks aimed at the financial sector are carried\nout by the subgroup Bluenoroff. Based only on the publicly exposed incidents, the extent of the theft attempts exceeds a\nbillion and a half USD. According to a Group-IB analysis, Lazarus had stolen at least 571 million USD between January 2017\nand October 2018, on 14 attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Cyber-attacks Targeting Israel in the First Half of 2019\n\n##### Smart Kangaroo - Phishing Campaign Targeted at Financial Institutions around the World\n\n###### Background\n\nSince March 2019, a group operating a sophisticated phishing infrastructure has been targeting banking clients in the\nMiddle East and worldwide. We assess hundreds of thousands of USD worth of various currencies were stolen from several\n\nbank accounts. Our initial findings led us to believe that the campaign primarily targets Israeli users. However, in recent\n\nmonths the attacks against financial institutes in Israel have declined. Instead, the attacks have shifted to well-known\nfirms in the media and financial sectors.\n\nThe name of the campaign \"Clever Kangaroo\" stems from the fact that the attackers are able to transfer their entire\n\nphishing infrastructure to new IP addresses in a short time span. In addition, they are able to bypass the two-factor\nauthentication mechanism (an SMS message from the bank to the client). We detected hundreds of domain names and\n\ndozens of IP addresses most likely connected to the attacker's infrastructure. Most of the domain names and phishing\n\npages that the attackers created are disguised as financial organizations.\n\n###### The Targets\n\nWe believe that the attack group is a skilled international criminal group from Eastern Europe, possibly Russia, that\nrecruited \"money mules\". These mules carry out money laundering operations for the group, often without knowing that\nthey are taking part in illegal activity.\n\nDuring April 2019, the campaign focused on phishing attempts against Israeli banks. However, recently the group has\nexpanded its scope and begun targeting international companies from the financial and telecommunication sectors,\n\namong them PayPal, Vodaphone and Scotiabank.\n\n###### Properties\n\nThroughout the course of our investigation, we were able to identify key characteristics of the campaign:\n\n  - Utilizing fake hosting and internet services disguised as Amazon, Akamai, Google and more.\n\n  - Disguising IP addresses of the attack infrastructure as to known internet services, media and porn websites.\n\n  - Obfuscating the attack infrastructure with Fast Flux - a DNS technique used by mainly by botnets to hide phishing\nand malware delivery sites behind an ever-changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies. Thus, the\nservers' IP addresses are constantly replaced so they can sustain counterattacks by the victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n- Setting up the infrastructure in Russia – hundreds of the registered domains use identical Nameserver servers –\nns1[.]parens[.]ru, ns2[.]parens[.]ru – and approximately 70 domains were registered with NameSilo.\n\n- Registering domains that resemble the targeted company's names (misspelled or phrased differently) and\nbuilding a fake website based on the company's current portal and branding, all in a short time span.\n\n- Generic domain names containing relevant keywords and targeting a broader audience. Below here is a mapping\nof the terms used by the attackers and their popularity within the domains registered by the attackers:\n\n**Domain Keyword** **Number of Domains using the Word**\n\nonline **350**\n\nbank **200**\n\nverification **90**\n\nlogin **90**\n\naccount **60**\n\nsecure **50**\n\nprotect **30**\n\nvalidation **20**\n\n- The live fake websites were scanned several times via URLScan[.]io. This was done first in either parking mode or\nredirection mode to Bing. After adding fraudulent content they were scanned again.\n\n- A collection of key IP addresses have been used throughout the campaign:\n\n`o` 124[.]156[.]115[.]52\n\n`o` 47[.]254[.]128[.]246\n\n`o` 5[.]189[.]224[.]208\n\n`o` 47[.]254[.]129[.]11\n\n`o` 185[.]244[.]150[.]0/24 (A range that was used often – note that the entire range was not used).\n\n- Propagation via SMS – the most common distribution vector of the phishing websites was via SMS messages. In\naddition, fake websites were built so that they would look like the mobile platform of some of the targeted banks.\nBelow here are a few examples:\n\n- Bypassing the OTP technology via SMS message – Research by some of the victims shed light on the attack\nmethod:\n\n`o` When the client inputs his login details in his bank portal, the attacker connects to the bank website.\n\n|Domain Keyword|Number of Domains using the Word|\n|---|---|\n|online|350|\n|bank|200|\n|verification|90|\n|login|90|\n|account|60|\n|secure|50|\n|protect|30|\n|validation|20|\n\n\n-----\n\n`o` He then makes a financial transaction that is usually followed by an OTP message from the bank.\n\n`o` Afterwards the victim receives another phishing message to his phone with a link for inputting the OTP\ncode that he got from the bank.\n\n`o` The attacker completes the transaction after receiving the legitimate code.\n\n  - Money Mules – The money was transferred to citizens who were persuaded to make financial transactions from\ntheir accounts. Most of them did not know where the money came from and that they were part of a fraud\ncampaign. They were recruited with 'wanted ads' in English that they saw on employee recruiting websites,\nwithout knowing that the employer was actually a cybercrime gang. We recommend investigating the receivers of\n\nthe financial transactions in order to check for similar methods of operation.\n\nBelow here is a Money Mules recruiting ad:\n\nA report about money mule recruitment has been spotted already in January:\n\nOn January 4, 2019, I saw a part time employment ad on gumtree for a flexible admin job which requires just\nsurveying the supermarkets within 2km of your house residence. i was to be paid $28/hr, with a maximum\ncommitment of 20 hours/ week. and so given that i lack the time but was in need of money, i applied.\n\nI first got into contact with \"arnold smith\" who claims to be a human resource manager then got into contact\nwith \"erika andersen\", the order support manager once i was \"accepted\". i also got into contact with \"christian\nmarkovic\" who claimed to be the hr director, asking for my bank details where you want the salary to be\ntransferred.\n\nI was four days into doing the \"order reports\" when they asked me to register in an e-currency website.\nthat's when i started doubting their legitimacy, and started to search for derby f&b. to my horror, this company\nhas been scamming people from different parts of the world, targeting people to be their money mules.\n\n###### Outline of the Attacks and SMS Verification Bypass Attempts by the Group\n\n First case – Attacking the Verification Process of Financial Transactions\n\nThe normal verification process for a financial transaction is as follows:\n\n1. The client logins from the mobile app or from the computer on the bank's website.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. He accesses the financial transaction section from the interface.\n\n3. He requests to carry out a transaction.\n\n4. The bank's computers send the client a verification message via SMS.\n\n5. The client inputs the verification code and the transaction is carried out.\n\n###### Attack Process\n\n**Stage** **Actor** **Action** **Result**\n\n**1** attacker Builds an attack infrastructure including Fake website infrastructure.\n\nwebsites disguised as the banks he wants to\nattack.\n\n**2** attacker Sends SMS message to potential clients An SMS message is received in the\nwith a link to the fake website client's cellphone.\n\n**3** client Believes the message and presses the link of A fake website appears on the client's\nthe SMS message. phone.\n\n**4** client Decides it is a fake website.

Note that this feature was eventually cancelled to prevent attacks.\n\nThe attackers exploited this feature by planting a cookie in the client's device after authentication of a mobile device or\n\ncomputer, in order not to prevent the bank from sending a verification code for financial transactions. The normal\nregistration process is as follows:\n\n1. The client logs in on a mobile app or on the computer.\n\n|Stage|Actor|Action|Result|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|attacker|Builds an attack infrastructure including websites disguised as the banks he wants to attack.|Fake website infrastructure.|\n|2|attacker|Sends SMS message to potential clients with a link to the fake website|An SMS message is received in the client's cellphone.|\n|3|client|Believes the message and presses the link of the SMS message.|A fake website appears on the client's phone.|\n|4|client|Decides it is a fake website.|Exits the website.

The message explains that a change of number request has been received and\nwarns the client before further verification.\n\n###### • Research and investigation efforts meant to detect the infrastructure and attackers.\n\n##### OpIsrael and OpJerusalem 2019 –Anti-Israeli Hacktivism OUT, Targeted Operations IN \n\n**Continuing the tendencies of the last years, the latest anti-Israel activism campaign was characterized by lowering**\n**of quality and reach of the activities. Organizers of the campaign have failed, this year especially, to gain**\n**momentum, and so the operation came to an end without any significant activities. Despite the social networks**\n**being full of publications calling for activists to attack Israel, very few of those activists have conducted actual**\n**attacks.**\n\nThe only anti-Israeli hacktivist effort worthy of any notice this year has been operation OpJerusalem – an attack conducted\n\non March the 2[nd] and enfolded the targeting of hundreds of Israeli internet sites for the purpose of infecting them with\nransomware and showing defacement messages. Among the affected and defaced sites were \"ynet\", \"Calcalist\", and\n\nseveral other prominent sites.\n\nThe defacement message came after the attackers were able to gain control over the DNS registry of sites using a third\nparty accessibility addon and redirected the viewers to a malicious site containing a pro-Palestinian message and a\nransomware. These affected sites load a JavaScript library from an address of a third-party service called \"Nagish Beklik\",\n\nwhich adds accessibility options for people with special needs in terms of vision, hearing, or mobility. From a check we\n\nhave conducted, there were 1600 Israeli sites which use this addon.\n\nThe primary intrusion vector had been, apparently, a phishing email against the sites' owners, through which the attackers\n\nwere able to get the credentials for the site containing the DNS registries and change them. The attackers have performed\n\nDNS Hijacking – gaining access to the manager of DNS entries of nagish.co.il. They have done so through gaining access to\nthe Nameserver manager of the registrar, a company named \"Box\". The attackers have changed the IP address of one of\n\nthe subdomains to point to their own, malicious IP address.\n\nBoth redirects to the subdomains of the \"Nagish\" site were changed: js.nagich[.]co.il and yad2-js.nagich[.]co.il. As a result,\nthe attackers were able to serve the sites a different, malicious JavaScript instead of the original accessibility.js. The\n\nattackers have also produced an SSL certificate, which allowed them to serve the file without HTTPS alerts from the site\nthey have prepared.\n\nThe malicious code was written to check the operational system of the computer, and if it's not Windows – the defacement\nmessage \"Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine #OpJerusalem\" is shown. Otherwise, a message prompting the user to\nupdate the Flash program would appear.\n\nClicking on \"Update\" will result in downloading a file hosted on another server under the attackers' control. The file does\n\nnot run automatically, but rather waits for the user to run it after downloading. It is important to notice, that the systemchecking script did not work during the analysis.\n\n###### OpJerusalem 2019 Results \n\nThousands of internet users received a pop-up message declaring that Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine. However, due\n\nto a malfunction in the infection code, no actual damage to the was caused. In our estimation, if the script had worked,\ntens of hundreds of users would have been infected with ransomware. At this point, it is unclear who is behind the incident\n\n\n-----\n\nand whether these are activists. Investigator Yuval Adam (@yuvadm) thinks that the actor behind the operation is\n@LulzSec[39], but @ZHacker claims it was @Th3Falcon.[40]\n\n###### ‘Nagish’ OpJerusalem Investigation \n\nThe company published an investigation into the incident. In the investigation, the security manager stated that after\nidentifying the change of records in the box.co.il storage services, the company did the following:\n\n1. The DNS records were soon updated to the correct IP addresses. It should be noted that a certain period of time\nis required between the update and its actual release and update on the DNS servers, both in Israel and around\nthe world.\n\n2. The box and the login information for the DNS records user interface has been replaced with the help if the BOX\n\ntechnical service.\n\n###### 3. Change of DNS servers and 2-step verification (2FA) of the management account.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/yuvadm/status/1101887294242476033 39\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ZHacker13/statuses/1102585591517118469 40\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Iranian Global Cyber Operations \n\n##### A Review of Recent Events – Nuclear Enrichment and Cyber Activities\n\nIn July 2019, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Iran has breached the limit of its enriched\n\nuranium stockpile set in the 2015 nuclear deal. This confirmation followed the statement published by Iran Foreign\n\nMinister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. This violation of the deal, as well as an explicit warning by European co-signatories,\nfollows an escalation of the economic sanctions by the United States which was set on last May by President Donald\n\nTrump, after the latter has decided to quit the nuclear deal and urged its alley countries worldwide to cease the purchase\n\nof Iranian oil.\n\nEarlier, in June, the United States carried out a high-profile attack on Iranian assets tied to the Revolutionary Guard Corps'\n\nmissile launch systems. This move was initiated following a retaliatory military move that was called off but was originally\nset as a reaction to Iran's attack of an American RQ-4A Global Hawk surveillance drone that flew over southern Iran.\n\nAlongside the deterioration of Iran's geo-political status in the international arena, the country has expanded its cyber\n\nactivities targeting western entities – notably United States and Israeli targets – as well as continued its ongoing aggressive\n\nattacks against its usual targets, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iranian minorities and anti-regime groups.\nClearly, Iran is constantly translating its political activities and the global moves of the western countries against her to\n\ncyber-attacks. Thus, in the past few months the campaigns carried out by Iranian APT groups are becoming more and\nmore aggressive and unconcealed.\n\nA prominent example of the nature of the Iranian activities is the profile of APT33, also known as Elfin. The group has been\nactively targeting organizations in the research, chemical, engineering, manufacturing, finance and other sectors as of\nearly 2016. Its prime targets are located in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Some 18 American organizations were\nattacked by APT33 in the past three years, including several Fortune 500 companies as well as healthcare providers and\norganizations targeted for the purpose of carrying out supply chain attacks.\n\nIt appears that despite the constant efforts, organizations and groups in the targeted countries put up a decent fight –\nthroughout the past few months highly sensitive information about the activities of government-backed groups was\nleaked, exposing abilities, strategies, and attack tools. The main medium for this leak was a telegram channel, as well as\nGitHub. The first leak uncovered hacking tools, espionage tools, WebShells and target list of APT34, also Known as OilRig.\nAPT34 has been attacking worldwide targets with an emphasis on the Middle-East. Another group that suffered from the\n\nleaks is the MuddyWater APT. The leaked information included previously unknown C&C servers used by the group, as well\nas attack tools that are offered for sale on underground forums.\n\nTo summarize, in the first half of 2019 there has been considerable escalation in the Iranian activity profile, from all\naspects. Politically, the country is responding to the United States sanctions escalation with several bold moves, including\n\n\n-----\n\nenlarging the enriched Uranium stockpile above the limit set in the nuclear deal, drop down of an American surveillance\ndrone and most likely, sabotaging oil tanks on four trade ships in the Persian Gulf. Nevertheless, western governments and\norganizations are responding with full power, successfully sabotaging Iranian activities on a timely basis. These powerful\nreactions include the American cyberattack against the missile launch systems of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. The\n\nconstant leaks of Iranian attack infrastructure and naturally, the extensive, in depth research of Iranian APT groups carried\nout by the security community.\n\n##### The Citrix Hack\n\nOn March 8[th], Citrix, a software company which provides multiple computing services, issued a statement that on March 6[th]\nit had received an alert from the FBI intelligence agency that the company's systems had been hacked by \"international\ncyber-attackers\"[41] using a Password Spraying attack – a Brute Force technique that leverages week passwords and\nexamines them against a large number of accounts in the attacked organization.[42] It is important to note that the extent of\nthe breach is still unclear and at this stage the nature of the documents and information stolen has not been confirmed.\n\nHowever, it is estimated that financial information and sensitive identification information (such as SSNs) relating to\n\nemployees, suppliers and customers were stolen.\n\nFollowing the incident, the security company Resecurity has claimed that it has uncovered findings linking the attack to\n\nIranian entities that have previously attacked government organizations and energy companies around the world.\n\nAccording to them, the stolen database was 6 to 10 GB in size, and included email communications, files, business\ndocuments and internal corporate documents.\n\nWhile the security community remained baffled with Resecurity’s publication, on March 11, the company updated its\n\nreporting and provided a number of indicators - 3 IP addresses in Iran and 7 IP addresses from Canada, USA, Germany and\nFrance.\n\n##### Iranian APT33 Exploitation of Outlook Vulnerability\n\nOn July 3[rd], FireEye issued an update alert to an APT33 campaign from December 2018. The recent alert provides\nadditional findings further supporting the attribution of the campaign to the group.[43] In this campaign the group executes\nattacks by exploiting an old Outlook vulnerability that was first reported in 2017 (CVE-2017-11774).[44]\n\nAccording to the recent FireEye report, the campaign continued its activity throughout June and July 2019, and targeted\ngovernmental and federal organizations, financial firms, academic establishments, and media companies in the US. As a\nreminder in our follow up investigation we detected an overlap between APT33's attacks and another Iranian group –\nOilRig.\n\n41 https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2019/03/08/citrix-investigating-unauthorized-access-to-internal-network/\n\n42 https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/password-spraying/\n\n43 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/12/overruled-containing-a-potentially-destructive-adversary.html\n\n44 https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/apt33/he/OUTLOOK-CERT-IL-W-967.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Sea Turtle – DNS Record Hijacking Campaign Against Government Organizations in the Middle East and North Africa\n\nTalos exposed a new DNS record hijacking campaign named Sea Turtle[45]. We recently posted a breaking alert on a new\n\nattack tool and C&C server by OilRig. There are connections and overlaps between the Talos indicators and the servers\nused by OilRig, which could indicate that OilRig are responsible for the attack.\n\n**Main targets: military, defense, and intelligence organizations, governmental departments and offices including foreign,**\nenergy and critical infrastructure departments.\n\n**Secondary targets leveraged to compromise the main targets** – telecom companies, ISPs and DNS registers, and IT\ncompanies.\n\nMost of the targets were located in the Middle East and North Africa. The attackers obtain initial access to the targets' DNS\nrecord management, and then changed the addresses under their control. By doing this, they were able to intercept traffic\nand act as a MITM (Man in the middle). Consequently, they could gather login information that passes from the end user to\n\nthe targets' servers through the malicious server. Moreover, the attackers exploited several known vulnerabilities for initial\n\npenetration and/or propagation in the target's network.\n\n45 https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/04/seaturtle.html\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ClearSky Investigations – Analysis of Iranian Cyber Operations\n\n##### Iranian Nation-State APT Groups - Confidential Documents Leak\n\n###### Analysis of Targets, Plans, and Attack Vectors\n\nOver the past few weeks, Iranian APT groups have suffered several significant data leaks. After analyzing and investigating\n\nthe documents we conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, the loss of data causes considerable harm these\n\ngroups and their ongoing cyber operations.\n\nMost of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels that were created specifically for this purpose. The identity of the actor\n\nbehind the leak is currently unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the exposed documents it appears\n\nthat this is the work of professionals. We estimate that the leak will hamstring the groups' upcoming operations and\n\nminimize the risk posed by their attacks in the near future.\n\nThe documents were released to the public via three main Telegram groups:\n\n  - **Lab Dookhtegam pseudonym** (\"The people whose lips are stitched and sealed\" – translation from Persian) – this\n\nchannel featured attack tools attributed to the OilRig group, as well as a WebShell that was inserted into the\nTechnion, tools used for DNS attacks and more.\n\n  - **Green Leakers** – this channel was used to leak attack tools attributed to the MuddyWater group. The group's\nname and its symbol are identified with the \"green movement\", which led the protests in Iran after the\nPresidential elections in 2009. These protests were heavily repressed by the revolutionary guards (IRGC)\n\n  - **Black Box** – a long existing channel, unlike the above-mentioned ones. On May 5[th], dozens of confidential\ndocuments classified as 'Secret' (the second highest classification rank) concerning Iranian APT groups' activity\nwere posted on this channel.\n\nAmong the leaked data are documents by the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence that uncover information about a group\ncalled \"Rana\". At this stage, we cannot attribute the group to any known Iranian actor. Activities conducted by the group,\naccording to the exposed documents, include Iranian citizens monitoring, both in Iran and abroad. The documents also\nreveal victim lists, cyber-attack strategies, alleged areas of access, employee list and screenshots from internal espionage\nsystem portals. A document related to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) reveals details about the\ndevelopment of a malware aimed at attacking SCADA systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Iranian Ministry of Intelligence Documents\n\n Rana team\n\nDocuments about the \"Rana\" group, classified as 'Secret', appear to have been written by a hacking and penetration team\n\nwithin the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence's cyber operations department.\n\nA yearly report summarizing the year of 1394 (March 2015 – March 2016) was partially leaked. The report reveals a strategic\ndata exfiltration operation targeting airline companies. Based on the report, we believe that hacking attempts against\nairline companies were indeed carried out. The operation is meant to allow monitoring of important Iranian personnel, as\naccording to the report, such people use international airline services.\n\nThe information that should be collected as part of the operation includes the following data types:\n\n1. Flight information, such as airline routes that might be under foreign surveillance, passenger identification and\nscenarios and detection of passengers that might have boarded a flight in disguise, for the purpose of arriving to\nan Enemy State.\n\n2. Aircrew information, including personal credentials and the number of professionals in specific flights.\n\n3. Information about high ranking professionals in a specific airline.\n4. Equipment information, including suppliers, number of devices used in a specific flight, plane number and type\n\nand computer equipment.\n\nAnother report for the year of 1395 (in this case, only March 2016\n\n– August 2016) enlists several successful espionage projects that\n\ntargeted airline databases. Affected organizations include the\nIsraeli airline \"Israir\", a Qatar-based airline and a Saudi Arabian\n\ninsurance company. The databases of the Turkish police\n\ndepartment and Emirates Roads and Transport Authority were\nexamined.\n\nThe preliminary research for these attacks included meetings\n\nwith airline employees of 'Mehrabad' airport in Tehran, attack\nvector collection, asset mapping and database Query Language\n\nresearch, covering Oracle and SQL.\n\nAmongst the documents there was also an image which,\naccording to the leakers, proves an attempt to conceal currency\nprocurement – perhaps due to the sanctions on Iran – via a\nVMware server.\n\n###### Targets\n\nAnother leaked document provides information about attack\n\ncampaigns meant to hack Israeli insurance companies, including multiple top firms – Ayalon, Altshuler Shaham, Clal,\nMenorah, Herel, Migdal, Phoenix, Direct Insurance and more. Nevertheless, the status of these attacks remains unclear.\nFurther hacking targets are Israeli hotel reservation portals, for the purpose of credit card data theft. One successful hack\nlead to the theft of 86,000 credit card credentials. Among the government sector, the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture was\n\nattacked.\n\nThe leaked documents revealed Iranian attack plans against multiple additional targets worldwide, for example,\ngovernmental institutes in Kuwait. The goal of the attack was to obtain access to a Kuwaiti email service and leverage it for\na data theft operation against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A strategic report from the first half of 1396 (March – August\n\n\n-----\n\n2017) describes activity carried out against Kuwait. According to a report from 2017, two teams were in charge of the attack\noperation – the Hacking team and the Social Engineering team.\n\nThe Hacking team's work precedes that of the social engineering team. In the attack against the Kuwaiti ministry, the team\nbegun with penetration tests on the ministry's systems. They then mapped the network and infrastructure and collected IP\n\naddresses, the domains, the websites and applications. They found out that they could obtain the highest level of control\nof the targeted servers. The hacking team also obtained access to the ministry's employee database in order to send spam\nmessages to everyone within the ministry and validate the emails using Mail Tracker.\n\nThe Social Engineering team's responsibilities include mainly phishing and spear-phishing operations. As part of this\nscope, the team sent phishing emails to a hospital called 'Atam Ananya' and the Qatari oil company. The team also carries\n\nour spear-phishing attack. Thus, the team communicated directly personnel related to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in\nKuwait. According to the documentation of the attack, it was successful.\n\n###### Iran Revoltionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Documents\n\nA document carrying the IRGC's logo contains a details about a plan\nnamed Project 910, which revolved around the development of a\n\nmalware intended to damage SCADA systems. It is a botnet that features\n\nspyware capabilities, such as remote connection. As of the time of\nwriting, February 2016, the project did not achieve its goals despite its\n\nhigh budget.\n\n##### MuddyWater APT Attack Infrastructure Targeting Turkish and Kurdish Organizations Exposed\n\nAs part of our ongoing monitoring of the Iranian attack groups, in April 2019 we found documents we linked to previous\ninfrastructure of the Iranian APT group MuddyWater. In previous research, we detected two domains that were hacked by\nthe group (one of them Israeli) and used to store malicious code snippet of the POWERSTATS malware affiliated with the\n\ngroup. For more information on the outline of the attack, please visit the ClearSky blog.[46]\n\nUnlike the previous attack vector, we did not identify the use of hacked servers' infrastructure in which the malicious code\nsnippet was stored, but a malware that comes with a built-in snippet. In addition to the bait file of the first attack vector,\nwe found five additional files that function the same but contain no content. We estimate that the attackers performed\nmalware tests to determine whether the document was classified as malicious by the various Anti-Virus engines.\n\n46 https://www.clearskysec.com/muddywater-operations-in-lebanon-and-oman/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attack Techniques and Targets\n\nMost of the victims of the current wave of attacks are part of Kurdish groups (such as the Komala Organization - a Kurdish\nIranian party in Iraq) and various organizations in Turkey affiliated with the security sector and the Turkish army. The\ninitial distribution vector is distribution by an email containing a malicious Office document. Below are screenshots from\ndecoy documents we obtained.\n\nThe document contains a blurry image of the Kurdistan Regional Government:\n\n###### First Attack Vector\n\nAs you can see, the first decoy document contains a blurry image disguised as an official Kurdistan government document.\nThe attacker lures the victim into clicking the Enable Editing or Enable Content and thus running a malicious macro\ncommand embedded in the Office Word file.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis Macro is called Gladiator_CRK. The attackers used this name in the OLE data as well under the name of the file editor.\n\nWe pivoted the name, and it returned several documents that perform partial actions of the malware, most of them\n\nwithout any impersonating content. These files may have been uploaded to VirusTotal as a test to see if they are caught by\nthe Anti-Virus engines. It should be noted that all of the empty files were uploaded to VirusTotal from Germany, while the\n\nmalicious decoy document was uploaded from Iraq - this strengthens our assessment that files uploaded from Germany\nare tests.\n\nLike previous cases, this Macro also uses an embedded com object in the macro code that allows the Excel process to run\n\nand run various commands under it. After running the malicious Macro, Registry entries are changed in order for the\nmalicious code to run even after booting the infected station, thus ensuring persistency. In addition, two files were created\nin the Temp folder which contained the code snippets that extract the POWERSTATS malware, similar to the previous\nattack vectors. The PowerShell uses Windows Script Host (WScript.exe) to extract a VBE code from the first image file\n\n(icon.ico) and is encoded in VBScript. This code runs a JavaScript code in the file which is embedded in the second file\n\n(picture.jpg) and encoded in base64.\n\nUnlike the previous files, we did not identify any additional servers used to download the above malware and they were\n\ncreated automatically.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Second Attack Vector\n\nIn this vector, we found that after the victim allowed the Macro to run, an encrypted txt file called Win32ApiSyncLog.txt\nwas created on the computer in which the backdoor was encoded in base64. In addition, a file called Win32ApiSync.bat\n(Batch type) - which contains the script that executes the code snippet - was compiled.[47] This script creates a scheduled\nprocess on your computer (schtasks) which creates, reads, and extracts the contents of the Win32ApiSync file every hour.\nDespite the request to enable content in the document, no malicious macro command is installed (unlike the first file).\n\nThis may explain why, unlike the previous file, a PowerShell was not installed on the computer via the excel process. The\nOLE data shows that the document was recently edited by a man named Babak Amiri. In this case, too, we found several\nother documents under this name, but they also did not contain a Macro. These documents share identical properties:\n\n47 https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/bef9051bb6e85d94c4cfc4e03359b31584be027e87758483e3b1e65d389483e6?environmentId=120\nhttps://twitter.com/h4ckak/status/1108290593862475776\n\n\n-----\n\nVia further searches we performed we identified that in previous attacks the use of the Routing 46.105.84 [.] 146: 443 /\n\nWordOffice.jpg was noted for downloading images containing the malicious code snippet. Here are the two servers that\nwere identified in our Shodan scan as having the same characteristics and are probably part of the same infrastructure:\n\n\n-----\n\n|Timeline – Events and Attacks in 2019 H1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Notes Sector Country Attack Target Vector|||||\n|January|||||\n|The ticket order platform was hacked, resulting in the theft of 5 million passenger records, later offered for sale.|Transportation|China|Hacking and Data Leak|China Railway48|\n|Credentials of over 3,000 passengers were stolen, and the company website was shut down.|Transportation|Ireland|Hacking and Data Leak|Luas Trams49|\n|Two major attacks in the past two years, leading to client data theft.|Manufacturing|United States|Hacking and Infection|OXO International50|\n|Election systems and computer network hacked.|Government|Ukraine|Hacking|Servers and computers of election staff in Ukraine51|\n|IT systems were taken down.
