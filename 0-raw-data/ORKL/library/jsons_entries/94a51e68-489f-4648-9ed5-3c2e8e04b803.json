In this post, we dive deeply into this campaign.\nFor a brief overview of this threat, see “Global Malware Campaign Pilfers Data from\n\nCritical Infrastructure, Entertainment, Finance, Health Care, and Other Industries.”\n\nOur investigation into this campaign reveals that the actor used multiple malware\n\nimplants, including an unknown implant with capabilities similar to Bankshot. From\n\nMarch 18 to 26 we observed the malware operating in multiple areas of the world. This\n\nnew variant resembles parts of the Destover malware, which was used in the 2014 Sony\n\nPictures attack.\n\nFurthermore, the Advanced Threat Research team has discovered Proxysvc, which\n\nappears to be an undocumented implant. We have also uncovered additional control\n\nservers that are still active and associated with these new implants. Based on our\n\nanalysis of public and private information from submissions, along with product\n\ntelemetry, it appears Proxysvc was used alongside the 2017 Destover variant and has\n\noperated undetected since mid-2017.\n\nThe attackers behind Operation GhostSecret used a similar infrastructure to earlier\n\nthreats, including SSL certificates used by FakeTLS in implants found in the Destover\nbackdoor variant known as Escad, which was used in the Sony Pictures attack. Based on\n\nour technical analysis, telemetry, and data from submissions, we can assert with high\n\nconfidence that this is the work of the Hidden Cobra group. The Advanced Threat\n\nResearch team uncovered activity related to this campaign in March 2018, when the\n\nactors targeted Turkish banks. These initial findings appear to be the first stage of\n\nOperation GhostSecret. For more on the global aspect of this threat, see “Global Malware\n\nCampaign Pilfers Data from Critical Infrastructure of Entertainment, Finance, Health Care,\n\nand Other Industries.”\n\n\nCountry *\n\n|--Please Select--|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n## McAfee on Twitter\n\n[ Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/McAfee)\n\n\n[mcafee_labs](https://www.twitter.com/mcafee_labs)\n\nOperation GhostSecret is\ntargeting a number of industries\n\nusing implants, tools, and\n\n[#malware variants associated w…](https://twitter.com/#search?q=malware)\n\n[https://t.co/t8nkOe4sSg](https://t.co/t8nkOe4sSg)\n\n4 hours ago\n[Reply · Retweet · Favorite](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=989028776091815938)\n\n\n[mcafee_labs](https://www.twitter.com/mcafee_labs)\n\n[RT @WSJ: Data-theft offensive with](https://twitter.com/WSJ)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe McAfee Advanced Threat Research team discovered a previously unknown data\ngathering implant that surfaced in mid-February 2018. This implant appears to be a\n\nderivative of implants authored before by Hidden Cobra and contains functionality\nsimilar to that of Bankshot, with code overlaps from other Hidden Cobra implants.\n\nHowever, the variant is not based on Bankshot. Our analysis of the portable executable’s\n\nrich-header data reveals that the two implants were compiled in different development\n\nenvironments. (The PE rich header is an undocumented part of a Windows executable\n\nthat reveals unique information to identify the Microsoft compiler and linker used to\n\ncreate the program. It is helpful for identifying similarities between malware variants to\n\nestablish common development environments.) Our analysis of the code and PE rich\n\nheader indicates that Bankshot, Proxysvc, and the Destover-like implant are distinct\n\nfamilies, but also contain overlapping code and functionality with current tools of Hidden\n\nCobra.\n\n_PE rich header data from the 2018 Bankshot implant._\n\n\nhttps://t.…\n\n5 hours ago\n[Reply · Retweet · Favorite](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=989002347333365760)\n\n\n[mcafee_labs](https://www.twitter.com/mcafee_labs)\n\n[.@timothywmartin shares the](https://twitter.com/timothywmartin)\n\nevolution of North Korea’s cyber\n\n[army.

The Destover-like variant is 83% similar in code to\n\na 2015 variant and contains the same rich PE header signature as the Backdoor.Escad\n\nvariant we analyzed. Thus the new implant is likely a derivative of components of\n\nDestover. We determined that the implant is not a direct copy of well-known previous\n\nsamples of Destover; rather, Hidden Cobra created a new hybrid variant using\n\nfunctionality present in earlier versions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_2014 Backdoor.Escad (hash: 8a7621dba2e88e32c02fe0889d2796a0c7cb5144)._\n\n_2015 Destover variant (7fe373376e0357624a1d21cd803ce62aa86738b6)._\n\nThe February implant fe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c was obtained from\n\nan unknown submitter in the United States on February 14, two days after it was\n\ncompiled. This Korean-language file used the control server IP address 203.131.222.83.\n\nThe implant is nearly identical to an unknown 2017 sample\n\n(8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35) except that the control server addresses\n\nare different. The 2017 sample used address 14.140.116.172. Both implants specifically\n\nuse FakeTLS with PolarSSL, which we saw in previous Hidden Cobra implants. PolarSSL\n\nlibraries have appeared in implants since the Sony Pictures incident and were used\n\nexclusively in the implant Backdoor.Destover. This implant incorporated a custom\n\ncontrol server protocol that sends traffic over port 443. The implementation does not\n\nformat the packets in standard SSL, but rather in a custom format and transmitted over\n\n\n-----\n\n_TLS traffic in Backdoor.Destover, the 2018 Destover-like variant._\n\n\n-----\n\np y\n\nhardcoded IP addresses, including the preceding address, all located in India. Despite the\n\nname, this component is not an SSL proxy, but rather a unique data-gathering and\n\nimplant-installation component that listens on port 443 for inbound control server\n\nconnections.\n\nProxysvc was first collected by public and private sources on March 22 from an unknown\n\nentity in the United States. The executable dropper for the component was submitted\n\nfrom South Korea on March 19. McAfee telemetry analysis from March 16 to 21 reveals\n\nthat Proxysvc components were active in the wild. Our research shows this listener\n\ncomponent appeared mostly in higher education organizations. We suspect this\n\ncomponent is involved in core control server infrastructure. These targets were chosen\n\nintentionally to run Proxysvc because the attacker would have needed to know which\n\nsystems were infected to connect to them. This data also indicates this infrastructure\n\nhad been operating for more than a year before its discovery. The Advanced Threat\n\nResearch team found this component running on systems in 11 countries. Given the\n\nlimited capabilities of Proxysvc, it appears to be part of a covert network of SSL listeners\n\nthat allow the attackers to gather data and install more complex implants or additional\n\ninfrastructure. The SSL listener supports multiple control server connections, rather than\n\na list of hardcoded addresses. By removing the dependency on hardcoded IP addresses\n\nand accepting only inbound connections, the control service can remain unknown.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The number of infected systems by country in which Proxysvc.dll was operating in March. Source:_\n\n_McAfee Advanced Threat Research._\n\nThe 2018 Destover-like implant appeared in organizations in 17 countries between March\n14 and March 18. The impacted organizations are in industries such as\n\ntelecommunications, health, finance, critical infrastructure, and entertainment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The_ _number of infected systems by country in which the Destover variant was operating in March._\n_Source: McAfee Advanced Threat Research._\n\n### Control Servers\n\nFurther investigation into the control server infrastructure reveals the SSL certificate\n\nd0cb9b2d4809575e1bc1f4657e0eb56f307c7a76, which is tied to the control server\n203.131.222.83, used by the February 2018 implant. This server resides at Thammasat\n\nUniversity in Bangkok, Thailand. The same entity hosted the control server for the Sony\n\n\n-----\n\naddresses that are active, two within the same network block as the 2018 Destover-like\nimplant.\n\n_Number of infections by Thammasat University–hosted control servers from March 15–19, 2018._\n\n\n-----\n\nMcAfee Advanced Threat Research determined that the Destover-like variant originated\nfrom code developed in 2015. The code reappeared in variants surfacing in 2017 and\n\n2018 using nearly the same functionality and with some modifications to commands,\nalong with an identical development environment based on the rich PE header\n\ninformation.\n\nBoth implants (fe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c and\n8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35) are based on the 2015 code. When\n\ncomparing the implant 7fe373376e0357624a1d21cd803ce62aa86738b6, compiled on\nAugust 8, 2015, we found it 83% similar to the implant from 2018. The key similarities and\n\ndifferences follow.\n\n### Similarities\n\nBoth variants build their API imports dynamically using GetProcAddress, including\nwtsapi32.dll for gathering user and domain names for any active remote sessions\n\nBoth variants contain a variety of functionalities based on command IDs issued by the\ncontrol servers\n\nCommon capabilities of both malware:\n\nListing files in directory\n\nCreating arbitrary processes\nWriting data received from control servers to files on disk\n\nGathering information for all drives\nGathering process times for all processes\n\nSending the contents of a specific file to the control server\nWiping and deleting files on disk\n\nSetting the current working directory for the implant\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth variants run commands on the system, log output to a temporary file, and send\nthe contents of the file to their control servers\n\n### Differences\n\nThe following capabilities in the 2015 implant are missing from the 2018 variant:\n\nCreating a process as a specific user\n\nTerminating a specific process\nDeleting a specific file\n\nSetting file times for a specific file\nGetting current system time and sending it to the control server\n\nReading the contents of a file on disk. If the filepath specified is a directory, then listing\nthe directory’s contents.\n\nSetting attributes on files\n\nThe 2015 implant does not contain a hardcoded value of the IP address it must connect\nto. Instead it contains a hardcoded sockaddr_in data structure (positioned at 0x270 bytes\n\nbefore the end of the binary) used by the connect() API to specify port 443 and control\nserver IP addresses:\n\n193.248.247.59\n\n196.4.67.45\n\nBoth of these control servers used the PolarSSL certificate\nd0cb9b2d4809575e1bc1f4657e0eb56f307c7a76.\n\n### P\n\n\n-----\n\nyet another implant using HTTP over SSL to receive commands from the control server.\n\nProxysvc appears to be a downloader whose primary capability is to deliver additional\npayloads to the endpoint without divulging the control address of the attackers. This\n\nimplant contains a limited set of capabilities for reconnaissance and subsequent payload\ninstallations. This implant is a service DLL that can also run as a standalone process.\n\n_The ServiceMain() sub function of Proxysvc._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Proxysvc binding itself to the specified port._\n\n_Proxysvc begins accepting incoming requests to process_\n\n\n-----\n\nconnection is not from any of the following addresses. If the incoming request does come\nfrom one of these, the implant offers a zero response (ASCII “0”) and shuts down the\n\nconnection.\n\n121.240.155.74\n121.240.155.76\n\n121.240.155.77\n121.240.155.78\n\n223.30.98.169\n223.30.98.170\n\n14.140.116.172\n\n### SSL Listener Capabilities\n\nThe implant receives HTTP-based commands from a control server and parses the HTTP\n\nContent-Type and Content-Length from the HTTP header. If the HTTP Content-Type\nmatches the following value, then the implant executes the command specified by the\n\ncontrol server:\n\nContent-Type: 8U7y3Ju387mVp49A\n\n_HTTP Content-Type comparison with a custom implant value._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Proxysvc writing a binary to a temp directory and executing it._\n\nGathering system information and sending it to the control server.

Given the extensive\n\ncommand structure that the implant can receive from the control server, this is an\nextensive framework for data reconnaissance and exfiltration, and indicates advanced\n\nuse. For example, the implant can wipe and delete files, execute additional implants, read\n\ndata out of files, etc.\n\nThe implant begins execution by dynamically loading APIs to perform malicious activities.\n\nLibraries used to load the APIs include:\n\nKernel32.dll\nApvapi32.dll\n\nOleaut32.dll\n\nIphlpapi.dll\n\nWs2_32.dll\nWtsapi32.dll\n\nUserenv.dll\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_The main implant dynamically loading APIs._\n\nAs part of its initialization, the implant gathers basic system information and sends it to\n\nits hardcoded control server 203.131.222.83 using SSL over port 443:\n\nCountry name from system’s locale\n\nOperating system version\n\nProcessor description from\n\nHKLM\\HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System\\CentralProcessor\\0\n\nProcessorNameString\n\nComputer name and network adapters information\nDisk space information for disks C: through Z: including total memory in bytes, total\n\navailable memory in bytes, etc.\n\nCurrent memory status including total physical memory in bytes, total available\n\nmemory etc\n\n\n-----\n\n_Domain name and username extraction using Win32 WTS APIs._\n\n### Data Reconnaissance\n\nThe implant receives commands over SSL as encoded data. This data is decoded, and the\n\ncorrect command ID is derived. Valid command IDs reside between 0 and 0x1D.\n\n_Switch case handling command execution based on command IDs._\n\nBased on the command ID the implant can perform the following functions:\n\n\n-----\n\nGet volume information for all drives on the system (A: through Z:) and exfiltrate to the\ncontrol server\n\n_Gathering volume information._\n\nList files in a directory The directory path is specified by the control server\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Reading file contents and sending it the control server._\n\nWrite data sent by the control server to a specified file path\n\n_Open handle to a file for writing with no shared permissions._\n\n_Writing data received from control server to file._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Creating a new process for a binary specified by the control server._\n\nWipe and delete files specified by the control server\n\n\n-----\n\n_Wiping and deleting files._\n\nExecute a binary on the system using cmd.exe and log the results into a temp file,\n\nwhich is then read and the logged results are sent to the control server.

The evolution in complexity of these data-gathering\n\nimplants reveals an advanced capability by an attacker that continues its development of\n\ntools. Our investigation uncovered an unknown infrastructure connected to recent\n\noperations with servers in India using an advanced implant to establish a covert network\n\nto gather data and launch further attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fighting cybercrime is a global effort best undertaken through effective partnerships between the_\n\n_public and private sectors. McAfee is working with Thai government authorities to take down the_\n\n_control server infrastructure of Operation GhostSecret, while preserving the systems involved for_\n\n_further analysis by law enforcement authorities. By creating and maintaining partnerships with_\n\n_worldwide law enforcement, McAfee demonstrates that we are stronger together._\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\nMcAfee detection\n\nTrojan-Bankshot2\n\n[MITRE ATT&CK techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page)\n\nExfiltration over control server channel: data is exfiltrated over the control server\n\nchannel using a custom protocol\n\nCommonly used port: the attackers used common ports such as port 443 for control\n\nserver communications\n\nService execution: registers the implant as a service on the victim’s machine\n\nAutomated collection: the implant automatically collects data about the victim and\n\nsends it to the control server\nData from local system: local system is discovered and data is gathered\n\nProcess discovery: implants can list processes running on the system\n\nSystem time discovery: part of the data reconnaissance method, the system time is\n\nalso sent to the control server\n\nFile deletion: malware can wipe files indicated by the attacker\n\n\n-----\n\n14.140.116.172\n\n203.131.222.109\n\n203.131.222.83\n\nHashes\n\nfe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c\n\n8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35\n\n33ffbc8d6850794fa3b7bccb7b1aa1289e6eaa45\n\n[ Previous Article](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/mobile-security/national-telephone-day-2018/) [Next Article ](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/global-malware-campaign-pilfers-data-from-critical-infrastructure-entertainment-finance-health-care-and-other-industries/)\n\n[ Categories: McAfee Labs](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/mcafee-labs/)\n\n[ Tags:  advanced persistent threats, cybercrime, cybersecurity, malware](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/advanced-persistent-threats/)\n\n## Leave a reply\n\nFacebook Comments (0) Comments (0) G+ Comments\n\n\n-----\n\nAdd a comment...\n\n\nFacebook Comments Plugin\n\n## Leave a Comment\n\nComment\n\nName * Email *\n\nPlease enter an answer in digits:\n\n\nPost CommentPost Comment\n\n\n[About | Subscribe | Contact & Media Requests | Privacy Policy | Legal](https://www.mcafee.com/us/about-us.aspx)\n[](https://www.facebook.com/McAfee) [](https://www.youtube.com/user/McAfee)\n\n\n-----\n\nSearch \n\n[Business](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/business/)\n\n[Consumer](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/consumer/)\n\n[Executive Perspectives](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/executive-perspectives/)\n\n[McAfee Partners](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/mcafee-partners/)\n\n[McAfee Labs](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/mcafee-labs/)\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish\n\nFollow us\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/McAfee) [](https://twitter.com/McAfee) [](https://www.youtube.com/user/McAfee) [](https://plus.google.com/101523649521491717960) [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mcafee) [](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/feed/)\n\n[About](https://www.mcafee.com/us/about-us.aspx)\n\n[Subscribe](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/feed/)\n\n[Contact & Media Requests](https://www.mcafee.com/us/about/contact-us.aspx#ht=tab-publicrelations)\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.mcafee.com/common/privacy/english/index.htm)\n\n[Legal](https://www.mcafee.com/us/about/legal/legal-notices.aspx)\n\n© McAfee LLC\n\n|English|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----",
