In 2017, the group added a new\ninfection method to its toolkit, using malicious documents which are likely circulated using\nspear-phishing emails sent to individuals working in targeted organizations.\n\nThese documents were Excel spreadsheets. When opened, they downloaded a malicious\nVBS file that in turn ran a PowerShell script. Several hours later, a dropper would appear on\nthe compromised computer. This would install three files on the computer, an information\nstealer, a screen capture utility, and an empty executable.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe screen capture utility appeared to be used for initial information gathering, as it was only\nused briefly at the beginning of each infection and not seen again. The information stealer\nwas capable of stealing the contents of the clipboard, taking screenshots, recording\nkeystrokes and stealing files and user credentials. After this initial activity, the attackers\nusually downloaded more of their tools to the computer using a PowerShell downloader and\nbegan moving across the victim’s network.\n\n## New tools used to compromise networks\n\nSymantec has seen Chafer use seven new tools in its more recent campaigns, in addition to\nmalware it is previously known to have used. Most of the new tools are freely available, offthe-shelf tools, put to a malicious use. The new tools include:\n\n**Remcom: An open-source alternative to PsExec, which is a Microsoft Sysinternals tool**\nused for executing processes on other systems.\n**Non-sucking Service Manager (NSSM): An open-source alternative to the Windows**\nService Manager which can be used to install and remove services and will restart\nservices if they crash.\n**A custom screenshot and clipboard capture tool.**\n**SMB hacking tools: Used in conjunction with other tools to traverse target networks.**\nThese tools include the EternalBlue exploit (which was previously used by WannaCry\nand Petya).\n**GNU HTTPTunnel: An open-source tool that can create a bidirectional HTTP tunnel on**\nLinux computers, potentially allowing communication beyond a restrictive firewall.\n**UltraVNC: An open-source remote administration tool for Microsoft Windows.**\n**NBTScan: A free tool for scanning IP networks for NetBIOS name information.**\n\nChafer has also continued to use tools previously associated with the group, including its\n[own custom backdoor Remexi (Backdoor.Remexi); the aforementioned PsExec; Mimikatz](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-110911-3433-99)\n[(Hacktool.Mimikatz), a free tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-042615-3731-99)\n[certificates, and recovering Windows passwords in plaintext; Pwdump (Pwdump) a tool that](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2005-032616-0025-99)\nis used to grab Windows password hashes from a remote Windows computer; and Plink\n(PuTTY Link) a command-line utility used to create reverse SSH sessions.\n\nChafer has used these tools in concert to traverse targeted networks. The group has recently\nadopted NSSM to maintain persistence and install the service which runs Plink on the\ncompromised computer. Plink is then used to open reverse SSH sessions from the attacker's\nserver to the RDP port on the victim computer. This presumably gives them RDP access to\nthe compromised computer.\n\nOnce a foothold is established, the attackers use PsExec, Remcom, and SMB hacking tools\nto begin moving across the victim’s network.\n\n\n-----\n\n## New infrastructure in use\n\nChafer has also begun using new infrastructure. The domain win7-updates[.]com is being\nused by the group as a command and control address. The domain has been referenced\nseveral times in command lines, e.g:\n\ns224.win7-update[.]com\ns5060.win7-update[.]com\ns21.win7-update[.]com\n\nIt has also been embedded in a dropper:\n\nhxxp://wsus65432.win7-update[.]com\n\nSymantec also discovered multiple IP addresses that were used as infrastructure by the\nattackers. It is unclear whether these were leased or hijacked, but the fact that many of them\nappear to follow a pattern—with the latter three numbers of each address often running in\nsequence—makes it likely they were deliberately selected by the attackers.\n\n107.191.62[.]45\n94.100.21[.]213\n89.38.97[.]112\n148.251.197[.]113\n83.142.230[.]113\n87.117.204[.]113\n89.38.97[.]115\n87.117.204[.]115\n185.22.172[.]40\n92.243.95[.]203\n91.218.114[.]204\n86.105.227[.]224\n91.218.114[.]225\n134.119.217[.]84\n\nIn one case, Symantec found what appeared to be a staging server used by the attackers.\nThe server belonged to one of the targeted organizations. Copies of many of the tools used\nby the group were discovered on the server. The attackers didn’t even bother hiding their\nactivity and saved items to the desktop, often without renaming them.\n\n## Links to Crambus?\n\nChafer’s activities have some links to another group known as Crambus (aka Oilrig). Both\ngroups have been observed using the same IP address for command and control purposes.\nIn addition to this, both groups have been seen using a similar infection vector, namely an\n\n\n-----\n\nExcel document which drops a malicious VBS file. Both VBS files reference the same file\npath, containing the same misspelling:\n\n“schtasks.exe /create/ F /sc minute /mo 2 /tn \"UpdatMachine\" /tr\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\microsoft\\Feed\\Y658123.vbs”\n\nAre the two groups one and the same? While this may be a possibility, at present there isn’t\nenough evidence to support that hypothesis. What is more likely is that the two groups are\nknown to each other and enjoy access to a shared pool of resources.\n\n## Growing threat to organizations in the Middle East\n\nChafer’s recent activities indicate that the group remains highly active, is continuing to hone\nits tools and tactics, and has become more audacious in its choice of targets. Although a\nregional actor, the group has followed two trends seen globally among targeted attack\ngroups. The first is a greater reliance on freely available software tools, also known as “living\noff the land.” By limiting their use of malware, groups such as Chafer hope to be less\nconspicuous on a victim’s network and, if discovered, make their attack more difficult to\nattribute.\n\nThe second trend is towards attacks on the supply chain, compromising organizations with\nthe goal of then attacking the customers, or even the customers of the customers, of those\norganizations. These attacks require more “steps” to reach their ultimate target, which adds\nadditional time and risk for attackers to reach their targets. However these attacks also\nleverage trusted channels into the eventual target, e.g., through a trusted supplier, allowing\nattackers to potentially circumvent security systems at the organization they ultimately wish\nto compromise. These attacks are riskier but come with a potentially higher reward and, if\nsuccessful, could give the attackers access to a vast pool of potential targets.\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
