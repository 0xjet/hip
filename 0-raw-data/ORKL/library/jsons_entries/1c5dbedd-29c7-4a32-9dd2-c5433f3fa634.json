See the ATT&CK for Enterprise version 7 for all referenced threat actor tactics and](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/enterprise/)_\n_techniques._\n\nThis joint cybersecurity advisory was coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n(CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the U.S. Cyber Command Cyber National Mission\nForce (CNMF). This advisory describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by North\n[Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group Kimsuky—against worldwide targets—to gain intelligence on](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\nvarious topics of interest to the North Korean government. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber\nactivity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA\nactivity, visit [https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea)\n\nThis advisory describes known Kimsuky TTPs, as found in open-source and intelligence reporting through\nJuly 2020. The target audience for this advisory is commercial sector businesses desiring to protect their\nnetworks from North Korean APT activity.\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/TLP-WHITE_AA20-301A_North_Korean_APT_Focus_Kimsuky.pdf)\n\n**Key Findings**\n\nThis advisory’s key findings are:\n\nThe Kimsuky APT group has most likely been operating since 2012.\nKimsuky is most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering mission.\nKimsuky employs common social engineering tactics, spearphishing, and watering hole attacks to\n[exfiltrate desired information from victims.[1],[2]](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\n[Kimsuky is most likely to use spearphishing to gain initial access into victim hosts or networks.[3]](https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829)\nKimsuky conducts its intelligence collection activities against individuals and organizations in South\nKorea, Japan, and the United States.\nKimsuky focuses its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national security issues\nrelated to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions.\nKimsuky specifically targets:\n\nIndividuals identified as experts in various fields,\nThink tanks, and\n[South Korean government entities.[4],[5],[6],[7],[8]](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\nCISA, FBI, and CNMF recommend individuals and organizations within this target profile increase their\ndefenses and adopt a heightened state of awareness. Particularly important mitigations include\nsafeguards against spearphishing, use of multi-factor authentication, and user awareness training.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Initial Access**\n\n\n-----\n\nKimsuky uses various spearphishing and social engineering methods to obtain Initial Access [[TA0001] to](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/)\n[victim networks.[9],[10],[11] Spearphishing—with a malicious attachment embedded in the email—is the most](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/04/apts-and-covid-19-how-advanced-persistent-threats-use-the-coronavirus-as-a-lure/)\n[observed Kimsuky tactic (Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001]).[12],[13]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/001/)\n\nThe APT group has used web hosting credentials—stolen from victims outside of their usual targets—to\nhost their malicious scripts and tools. Kimsuky likely obtained the credentials from the victims via\nspearphishing and credential harvesting scripts. On the victim domains, they have created subdomains\nmimicking legitimate sites and services they are spoofing, such as Google or Yahoo mail.[14]\nKimsuky has also sent benign emails to targets, which were possibly intended to build trust in advance\nof a follow-on email with a malicious attachment or link.\n\nPosing as South Korean reporters, Kimsuky exchanged several benign interview-themed emails\nwith their intended target to ostensibly arrange an interview date and possibly build rapport. The\nemails contained the subject line “Skype Interview requests of [Redacted TV Show] in Seoul,” and\nbegan with a request to have the recipient appear as a guest on the show. The APT group invited\nthe targets to a Skype interview on the topic of inter-Korean issues and denuclearization\nnegotiations on the Korean Peninsula.\nAfter a recipient agreed to an interview, Kimsuky sent a subsequent email with a malicious\ndocument, either as an attachment or as a Google Drive link within the body. The document\nusually contained a variant of BabyShark malware (see the Execution section for information on\nBabyShark). When the date of the interview drew near, Kimsuky sent an email canceling the\ninterview.\nKimsuky tailors its spearphishing and social engineering approaches to use topics relevant to the\n[target, such as COVID-19, the North Korean nuclear program, or media interviews.[15],[16],[17]](https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829)\n\nKimsuky’s other methods for obtaining initial access include login-security-alert-themed phishing emails,\nwatering hole attacks, distributing malware through torrent sharing sites, and directing victims to install\nmalicious browser extensions (Phishing: Spearphising Link [[T1566.002], Drive-by Compromise [T1189], Man-](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002/)\n_in-the-Browser_ [[T1185]).[18]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1185/)\n\n**Execution**\n\n[After obtaining initial access, Kimsuky uses BabyShark malware and PowerShell or the Windows Command](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0414/)\nShell for Execution [[TA0002].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0002/)\n\nBabyShark is Visual Basic Script (VBS)-based malware.\n\nFirst, the compromised host system uses the native Microsoft Windows utility, `mshta.exe, to`\ndownload and execute an HTML application (HTA) file from a remote system (Signed Binary\n_Proxy Execution: Mshta_ [[T1218.005]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1218/005/)\nThe HTA file then downloads, decodes, and executes the encoded BabyShark VBS file.\n[The script maintains Persistence [TA0003] by creating a Registry key that runs on startup (Boot or](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0003/)\n_Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder_ [[T1547.001]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1547/001/)\nIt then collects system information (System Information Discovery [[T1082]), sends it to the](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1082)\n[operator’s command control (C2) servers, and awaits further commands.[19],[20],[21],[22]](https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829)\nOpen-source reporting indicates BabyShark is delivered via an email message containing a link or an\nattachment (see Initial Access section for more information) (Phishing: Spearphising Link [[T1566.002],](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002/)\n_Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment_ [[T1566.001]). Kimsuky tailors email phishing messages to match](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/001)\nits targets’ interests. Observed targets have been U.S. think tanks and the global cryptocurrency\n[industry.[23]](https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829)\n\n**Persistence**\n\n\n-----\n\nKimsuky has demonstrated the ability to establish Persistence [[TA0003] through using malicious browser](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0003/)\nextensions, modifying system processes, manipulating the `autostart execution, using Remote Desktop`\nProtocol (RDP), and changing the default file association for an application. By using these methods,\nKimsuky can gain login and password information and/or launch malware outside of some application\nallowlisting solutions.\n\nIn 2018, Kimsuky used an extension, which was available on the Google Chrome Web Store, to infect\n[victims and steal passwords and cookies from their browsers (Man-in-the-Browser [T1185]). The](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1185/)\nextension’s reviews gave it a five-star rating, however the text of the reviews applied to other\n[extensions or was negative. The reviews were likely left by compromised Google+ accounts.[28]](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\nKimsuky may install a new service that can execute at startup by using utilities to interact with services\n[or by directly modifying the Registry keys (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution [T1547]). The service](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1547)\nname may be disguised with the name from a related operating system function or by masquerading as\nbenign software. Services may be created with administrator privileges but are executed under system\nprivileges, so an adversary can also use a service to escalate privileges from Administrator to System.\n[They can also directly start services through Service Execution.[29],[30]](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\nDuring the STOLEN PENCIL operation in May 2018, Kimsuky used the GREASE malware. GREASE is\na tool capable of adding a Windows administrator account and enabling RDP while avoiding firewall\n[rules (Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol [T1021.001]).[31]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1021/001)\nKimsuky uses a document stealer module that changes the default program associated with Hangul\nWord Processor (HWP) documents ( .hwp files) in the Registry (Event Triggered Execution: Change\n_Default File Association_ [[T1546.001]). Kimsuky manipulates the default Registry setting to open a](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1546/001)\nmalicious program instead of the legitimate HWP program (HWP is a Korean word processor). The\nmalware will read and email the content from HWP documents before the legitimate HWP program\n[ultimately opens the document.[32] Kimsuky also targets Microsoft Office users by formatting their](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\ndocuments in a `.docx file rather than` `.hwp and will tailor their macros accordingly.[33]`\nKimsuky maintains access to compromised domains by uploading actor-modified versions of opensource Hypertext Processor (PHP)-based web shells; these web shells enable the APT actor to upload,\ndownload, and delete files and directories on the compromised domains (Server Software Component:\n_Web Shell_ [[T1505.003]). The actor often adds “Dinosaur” references within the modified web shell](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T505/003)\ncodes.[34]\n\n**Privilege Escalation**\n\n[Kimsuky uses well-known methods for Privilege Escalation [TA0004]. These methods include placing scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0004/)\nin the Startup folder, creating and running new services, changing default file associations, and injecting\nmalicious code in `explorer.exe .`\n\nKimsuky has used Win7Elevate—an exploit from the Metasploit framework—to bypass the User\nAccount Control to inject malicious code into `explorer.exe (Process Injection` [[T1055]). This](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1055/)\nmalicious code decrypts its spying library—a collection of keystroke logging and remote control access\ntools and remote control download and execution tools—from resources, regardless of the victim’s\noperating system. It then saves the decrypted file to a disk with a random but hardcoded name (e.g.,\n```\n   dfe8b437dd7c417a6d.tmp ) in the user’s temporary folder and loads this file as a library, ensuring the\n\n```\n[tools are then on the system even after a reboot. This allows for the escalation of privileges.[35]](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\nBefore the injection takes place, the malware sets the necessary privileges (see figure 1). The malware\nwrites the path to its malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) and ensures the remote process is loaded\nby creating a remote thread within `explorer.exe (Process Injection` [[T1055]).[36]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1055/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Privileges set for the injection_ [[37]](https://yoroi.company/research/the-north-korean-kimsuky-apt-keeps-threatening-south-korea-evolving-its-ttps/)\n\n**Defense Evasion**\n\nKimsuky uses well-known and widely available methods for Defense Evasion [[TA0005] within a network.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0005/)\n[These methods include disabling security tools, deleting files, and using Metasploit.[38],[39]](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\n\nKimsuky’s malicious DLL runs at startup to zero (i.e., turn off) the Windows firewall Registry keys (see\nfigure 2). This disables the Windows system firewall and turns off the Windows Security Center service,\nwhich prevents the service from alerting the user about the disabled firewall (see figure 2) (Impair\n_[Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall [T1562.004]).[40]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1562/004/)_\n\n_Figure 2: Disabled firewall values in the Registry_ [[41]](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\n\nKimsuky has used a keylogger that deletes exfiltrated data on disk after it is transmitted to its C2 server\n[(Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion [T1070.004]).[42]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1070/004/)\nKimsuky has used `mshta.exe, which is a utility that executes Microsoft HTAs. It can be used for proxy`\nexecution of malicious `.hta files and JavaScript or VBS through a trusted windows utility (Signed`\n_Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta_ [[T1218.005]). It can also be used to bypass application allow listing](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1218/005)\nsolutions (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Access Control [[T1548.002]).[43],[44]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1548/002)\n\n\n-----\n\nWin7Elevate—which was noted above—is also used to evade traditional security measures.\nWin7Elevatve is a part of the Metasploit framework open-source code and is used to inject malicious\n[code into explorer.exe (Process Injection [T1055]). The malicious code decrypts its spying library from](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1055)\nresources, saves the decrypted file to disk with a random but hardcoded name in the victim's temporary\n[folder, and loads the file as a library.[45],[46],[47]](https://www.securityweek.com/north-korea-suspected-cyber-espionage-attacks-against-south-korean-entities)\n\n**Credential Access**\n\nKimsuky uses legitimate tools and network sniffers to harvest credentials from web browsers, files, and\nkeyloggers (Credential Access [[TA0006]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0006/)\n\nKimsuky uses memory dump programs instead of using well-known malicious software and performs\nthe credential extraction offline. Kimsuky uses `ProcDump, a Windows command line administration`\ntool, also available for Linux, that allows a user to create crash dumps/core dumps of processes based\nupon certain criteria, such as high central processing unit (CPU) utilization (OS Credential Dumping\n\n[[T1003]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1003/) `ProcDump monitors for CPU spikes and generates a crash dump when a value is met; it`\npasses information to a Word document saved on the computer. It can be used as a general process\ndump utility that actors can embed in other scripts, as seen by Kimsuky’s inclusion of `ProcDump in the`\n[BabyShark malware.[48]](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/05/09/detecting-credential-theft-through-memory-access-modelling-with-microsoft-defender-atp/)\nAccording to open-source security researchers, Kimsuky abuses a Chrome extension to steal\npasswords and cookies from browsers (Man-in-the-Browser [[T1185]).[49],[50] The spearphishing email](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1185/)\ndirects a victim to a phishing site, where the victim is shown a benign PDF document but is not able to\nview it. The victim is then redirected to the official Chrome Web Store page to install a Chrome\nextension, which has the ability to steal cookies and site passwords and loads a JavaScript file, named\n```\n   jQuery.js, from a separate site (see figure 3).[51]\n\n```\n_Figure 3: JavaScript file, named_ `jQuery.js` [[52]](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\n\nKimsuky also uses a PowerShell based keylogger, named MECHANICAL, and a network sniffing tool,\nnamed Nirsoft SniffPass (Input Capture: Keylogging [[T1056.001], Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/001/) [[T1040]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1040/)\nMECHANICAL logs keystrokes to `%userprofile%\\appdata\\roaming\\apach.{txt,log} and is also`\na \"cryptojacker,\" which is a tool that uses a victim’s computer to mine cryptocurrency. Nirsoft SniffPass\n[is capable of obtaining passwords sent over non-secure protocols.[53]](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\n\n\n-----\n\nKimsuky used actor-modified versions of PHProxy, an open-source web proxy written in PHP, to\nexamine web traffic between the victim and the website accessed by the victims and to collect any\ncredentials entered by the victim.[54]\n\n**Discovery**\n\nKimsuky enumerates system information and the file structure for victims’ computers and networks\n(Discovery [[TA0007]). Kimsuky appears to rely on using the victim’s operating system command prompt to](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0007/)\n[enumerate the file structure and system information (File and Directory Discovery [T1083]). The information](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1083/)\nis directed to `C:\\WINDOWS\\msdatl3.inc, read by malware, and likely emailed to the malware’s command`\n[server.[55]](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\n\n**Collection**\n\nKimsuky collects data from the victim system through its HWP document malware and its keylogger\n(Collection [[TA0009]). The HWP document malware changes the default program association in the Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0009/)\nto open HWP documents (Event Triggered Execution: Change Default File Association [[T1546.001]). When a](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1546/001/)\nuser opens an HWP file, the Registry key change triggers the execution of malware that opens the HWP\ndocument and then sends a copy of the HWP document to an account under the adversary’s control. The\nmalware then allows the user to open the file as normal without any indication to the user that anything has\noccurred. The keylogger intercepts keystrokes and writes them to `C:\\Program Files\\Common`\n```\nFiles\\System\\Ole DB\\msolui80.inc and records the active window name where the user pressed keys\n\n```\n(Input Capture: Keylogging [[T1056.001]). There is another keylogger variant that logs keystrokes into](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/001/)\n```\nC:\\WINDOWS\\setup.log .[56]\n\n```\nKimsuky has also used a Mac OS Python implant that gathers data from Mac OS systems and sends it to a\nC2 server (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Python [[T1059.006]). The Python program downloads](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1059/006/)\nvarious implants based on C2 options specified after the `filedown.php (see figure 4).`\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Python Script targeting MacOS [57]_\n\n**Command and Control**\n\nKimsuky has used a modified TeamViewer client, version 5.0.9104, for Command and Control [[TA0011]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0011/)\n(Remote Access Software [[T1219]). During the initial infection, the service “Remote Access Service” is](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1219/)\ncreated and adjusted to execute `C:\\Windows\\System32\\vcmon.exe at system startup (Boot or Logon`\n_Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder_ [[T1547.001]). Every time](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1547/001/) `vcmon.exe is executed, it`\ndisables the firewall by zeroing out Registry values (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall\n\n[[T1562.004]). The program then modifies the TeamViewer Registry settings by changing the](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1562/004/) `TeamViewer`\nstrings in TeamViewer components. The launcher then configures several Registry values, including\n```\nSecurityPasswordAES, that control how the remote access tool will work. The SecurityPasswordAES\n\n```\nRegistry value represents a hash of the password used by a remote user to connect to TeamViewer Client\n[(Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash [T1550.002]). This way, the attackers set a pre-shared](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/)\nauthentication value to have access to the TeamViewer Client. The attacker will then execute the\nTeamViewer client `netsvcs.exe .[58]`\n\nKimsuky has been using a consistent format. In the URL used recently— express[.]php?op=1 —there\nappears to be an option range from 1 to 3.[59]\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\nOpen-source reporting from cybersecurity companies describes two different methods Kimsuky has used to\nexfiltrate stolen data: via email or through an RC4 key generated as an MD5 hash or a randomly generated\n[117-bytes buffer (Exfiltration [TA0010]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0010/)\n\nThere was no indication that the actor destroyed computers during the observed exfiltrations, suggesting\nKimsuky’s intention is to steal information, not to disrupt computer networks. Kimsuky’s preferred method for\nsending or receiving exfiltrated information is through email, with their malware on the victim machine\nencrypting the data before sending it to a C2 server (Archive Collected Data [[T1560]). Kimsuky also sets up](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1560)\nauto-forward rules within a victim’s email account (Email Collection: Email Forwarding Rule [[T1114.003]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1114/003/)\n\nKimsuky also uses an RC4 key generated as an MD5 hash or a randomly generated 117-bytes buffer to\nexfiltrate stolen data.
