    "plain_text": "# Iranian Spies Accidentally Leaked Videos of Themselves Hacking\n\n**wired.com/story/iran-apt35-hacking-video/**\n\nAndy Greenberg July 16, 2020\n\nWhen security researchers piece together the blow-by-blow of a state-sponsored hacking\noperation, they're usually following a thin trail of malicious code samples, network logs, and\nconnections to faraway servers. That detective work gets significantly easier when hackers\nrecord what they’re doing and upload the video to an unprotected server on the open\ninternet. Which is precisely what a group of Iranian hackers may have unwittingly done.\n\nResearchers at IBM’s X-Force security team revealed today that they've obtained roughly\nfive hours of video footage that appears to have been recorded directly from the screens of\nhackers working for a group IBM calls ITG18, and which other security firms refer to as\n[APT35 or Charming Kitten. It's one of the most active state-sponsored espionage teams](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-hacks-nuclear-deal-shamoon-charming-kitten/)\nlinked to the government of Iran. The leaked videos were found among 40 gigabytes of data\nthat the hackers had apparently stolen from victim accounts, including US and Greek military\npersonnel. Other clues in the data suggest that the hackers targeted US State Department\nstaff and an unnamed Iranian-American philanthropist.\n\nThe IBM researchers say they found the videos exposed due to a misconfiguration of\nsecurity settings on a virtual private cloud server they'd observed in previous APT35 activity.\nThe files were all uploaded to the exposed server over a few days in May, just as IBM was\nmonitoring the machine. The videos appear to be training demonstrations the Iran-backed\n\n\n-----\n\nhackers made to show junior team members how to handle hacked accounts. They show the\nhackers accessing compromised Gmail and Yahoo Mail accounts to download their contents,\nas well as exfiltrating other Google-hosted data from victims.\n\nThis sort of data exfiltration and management of hacked accounts is hardly sophisticated\nhacking. It's more the kind of labor-intensive but relatively simple work that's necessary in a\nlarge-scale phishing operation. But the videos nonetheless represent a rare artifact, showing\na first-hand view of state-sponsored cyberspying that's almost never seen outside of an\nintelligence agency.\n\n\"We don't get this kind of insight into how threat actors operate really ever,\" says Allison\nWikoff, a senior analyst at IBM X-Force whose team discovered the videos. \"When we talk\nabout observing hands-on activity, it’s usually from incident-response engagements or\nendpoint monitoring tools. Very rarely do we actually see the adversary on their own desktop.\nIt's a whole other level of 'hands-on-keyboard' observation.\"\n\n\"Nothing was off-limits.\"\n\nAllison Wikoff, IBM X-Force\n\nIn two videos IBM showed to WIRED on the condition that they not be published, the hackers\ndemonstrate the workflow for siphoning data out of a hacked account. In one video, the\nhacker logs into a compromised Gmail account—a dummy account for the demonstration—\nby plugging in credentials from a text document, and links it to the email software Zimbra,\ndesigned to manage multiple accounts from a single interface, using Zimbra to download the\naccount's entire inbox to the hacker's machine. Then the hacker quickly deletes the alert in\nthe victim's Gmail that says their account permissions have been changed. Next the hacker\ndownloads the victim's contacts and photos from their Google account too. A second video\nshows a similar workflow for a Yahoo account.\n\nA screenshot from a leaked video of Iranian hackers demonstrating how to exfiltrate emails\nfrom a Yahoo account using the email management tool Zimbra.Screenshot: IBM\n\nThe most telling element of the video, Wikoff says, is the speed the hacker demonstrates in\nexfiltrating the accounts' information in real time. The Google account's data is stolen in\naround four minutes. The Yahoo account takes less than three minutes. In both cases, of\ncourse, a real account populated with tens or hundreds of gigabytes of data would take far\nlonger to download. But the clips demonstrate how quickly that download process is set up,\nWikoff says, and suggest that the hackers are likely carrying out this sort of personal data\ntheft on a mass scale. \"To see how adept they are at going in and out of all these different\nwebmail accounts and setting them up to exfiltrate, it is just amazing,\" says Wikoff. \"It’s a\nwell-oiled machine.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nIn some cases, IBM s researchers could see in the video that the same dummy accounts\nwere also themselves being used to send phishing emails, with bounced emails to invalid\naddresses appearing in the accounts' inboxes. The researchers say those bounced emails\nrevealed some of the APT35 hackers' targeting, including American State Department staff\nas well as an Iranian-American philanthropist. It's not clear if either target was successfully\nphished. The dummy Yahoo account also briefly shows the phone number linked with it,\nwhich begins with Iran's +98 country code.\n\nIn other videos the IBM researchers declined to show to WIRED, the researchers say the\nhackers appeared to be combing through and exfiltrating data from real victims' accounts,\nrather than ones they created for training purposes. One victim was a member of the US\nNavy, and another was a two-decade veteran of the Greek Navy. The researchers say the\nAPT35 hackers appear to have stolen photos, emails, tax records, and other personal\ninformation from both targeted individuals.\n\nA file directory on an unsecured server used by the APT35 hackers, listing accounts whose\ndata they had stolen.Screenshot: IBM\n\nIn some clips, the researchers say they observed the hackers working through a text\ndocument full of usernames and passwords for a long list of non-email accounts, from phone\ncarriers to bank accounts, as well as some as trivial as pizza delivery and music-streaming\nservices. \"Nothing was off-limits,\" Wikoff says. The researchers note that they didn't see any\n[evidence that the hackers were able to bypass two-factor authentication, however. When an](https://www.wired.com/story/protect-accounts-two-factor-authentication/)\naccount was secured with any second form of authentication, the hackers simply moved on\nto the next one on their list.\n\nThe sort of targeting that IBM's findings reveal fits with previous known operations tied to\nAPT35, which has carried out espionage on behalf of Iran for years, most often with phishing\nattacks as its first point of intrusion. The group has focused on government and military\ntargets that represent a direct challenge to Iran, such as nuclear regulators and sanctions\nbodies. More recently it has aimed its phishing emails at pharmaceutical companies involved\n[in Covid-19 research and President Donald Trump's reelection campaign.](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-hackers-target-us-presidential-candidate/)\n\nIt's hardly unprecedented for hackers to accidentally leave behind revealing tools or\ndocuments on an unsecured server, points out former NSA staffer Emily Crose, who now\nworks as a researcher for the security firm Dragos. But Crose says she's not aware of any\npublic instance of actual videos of state-sponsored hackers' own operations being left for\ninvestigators, as in this case. And given that the hacked accounts likely also contain\nevidence of how they were compromised, she says the leaked videos may well force the\nIranian hackers to change some of their tactics. \"This kind of thing is a rare win for the\ndefenders,\" Crose says. \"It's like playing poker and having your opponents lay their entire\nhand out flat on the table in the middle of the last flop.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nEven so, IBM says it doesn t expect its discovery of the APT35 videos to slow down the pace\nof the hacking group's operations. After all, it had nearly a hundred of its domains seized by\nMicrosoft last year. \"They simply rebuilt and kept going,\" says Wikoff. If that sort of\ninfrastructure purge didn't slow down the Iranians, she says, don't expect a bit of videoleaked exposure to, either.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n[Behind bars, but still posting on TikTok](https://www.wired.com/story/prison-tiktok-behind-bars-still-posting/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_4&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nMy friend was struck by ALS.
