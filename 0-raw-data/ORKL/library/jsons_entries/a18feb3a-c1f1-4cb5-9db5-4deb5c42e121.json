These files compromise a host with standard rootkit functionality.\nThe main agent uses a unique custom protobuf based protocol for C2 communication.\n\n## Summary\n\nLacework Labs recently examined a new publicly shared rootkit, identifying its core\ncapabilities and level of threat it represents to Linux hosts. The rootkit was first shared by\nAvast, triggering us to confirm coverage and investigate further. Our analysis below provides\ninsight into the installer (droppers), in addition to the Kernel module and userland samples\ndropped. Our objective with this blog is to build on top of the findings from Avast, share our\nanalysis, and provide defenders with detection options in the form of Yara rules and IOCs.\n\nFor more content like this, follow us on [Twitter or](https://www.twitter.com/LaceworkLabs) [LinkedIn to keep up with our latest](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/lacework-labs?trk=affiliated-pages_result-card_full-click)\nresearch.\n\n## The Dropper\n\nThe ELF dropper\n(602c435834d796943b1e547316c18a9a64c68f032985e7a5a763339d82598915) is a\nmodified version of the coreutils “kill” binary. The majority of the “kill” binary’s core\nfunctionality remains the same, but with the addition of writing two ELF files to disk during\nexecution. One of these components is a userland binary and the other a kernel module\n(10c7e04d12647107e7abf29ae612c1d0e76a79447e03393fa8a44f8a164b723d) identified by\nAvast as the [Sutersu rookit. Notably, figure – 0 and figure 1 show the the ELF dropper and](https://github.com/mncoppola/suterusu)\nkernel rootkit had low or non-existent detection rates on VirusTotal.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 0 – VirusTotal for Dropper\n\nFigure 1 – Kernel Rootkit\nThe rootkit is written to disk first after a temporary filename has been generated via the\n_[mktemp system call. After writing 20224 bytes (0x4f00) to the temporary file, the file](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mktemp.3.html)_\n[descriptor is closed and then the insmod utility is used to install this kernel module. Errors](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/insmod.8.html)\nare subsequently ignored through stdout/stderr redirection to /dev/null. If [secure boot is](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot)\nenabled on the underlying system (which would require signed kernel modules) or the kernel\nversion is not what the kernel module was compiled for, insmod will fail. Finally, the [dmesg](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html)\n[utility is used to clear the dmesg output (T1070,) which would contain forensic artifacts of a](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/002/)\n[kernel module being installed as well as remove the underlying ELF binary via unlink](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unlink.2.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – Kernel Module Written to Disk\nAfter writing the kernel module to disk, the embedded userland component is written to either\n_/proc/.inl or /tmp/.tmp_XXXXXX depending on whether or not the open command succeeded_\nfor /proc/.inl.\n\nGiven the underlying backdoor coreutils utility is kill, it is not uncommon for the legitimate\nusage of this utility to be executed via “sudo kill” when terminating privileged processes.\nExecuting with sudo results in appropriate permissions to both install the kernel module and\nwrite to the privileged location in /proc/. After writing the file, the file descriptor is closed and\n[the binary is executed via the system syscall followed by deletion via the unlink syscall. This](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.html)\nbehavior can be seen in the following figure below.\n\n_Figure 3 – Userland ELF Written to Disk_\n\n## The Rootkit – Sutersu\n\n\n-----\n\n[The kernel module as pointed out by Avast is the open-source rootkit Sutersu . This rootkit](https://github.com/mncoppola/suterusu)\nhas wide kernel version support, as well as supporting multiple architectures including x86,\nx86_64, and ARM. Sutersu supports file, port, and process hiding, as one would expect from\na rootkit. Sutersu also supports functionality beyond process and file hiding in the form of\nadditional modules that are specified during compile time.\n\nAt the time of this writing, these additional modules include a keylogger, a module to\ndownload and execute (DLEXEC) a binary upon a given event, and an ICMP module to\nmonitor for specific “magic bytes” before triggering an event. The DLEXC and ICMP module\ncan be used together to trigger the downloading and execution of a binary when a specific\nICMP packet is received. They also can be used independently. Lacework labs identified\nmultiple Sutersu kernel modules with various modules and external IPs.\n\nOne variant of Sutersu identified within a dropper ELF containing the ICMP module that\nwatches for incoming ICMP packets to then trigger further actions is shown as hiding any\noutbound connections to a given address. Figure – 4 below shows hardcoded IPv4\naddresses identified within the Sutersu KO file. The “127.0.0.1” corresponds to a sshd server\nsetup command within the userland ELF binary shown in figure -X.\n\n_Figure 4 – Embedded IPs of Kernel Module_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 – sshd Setup from Userland Component_\n\n## The Userland ELF\n\nThe embedded userland ELF file is a dynamically linked file packed via the UPX utility. This\nis indicative based on string artifacts within the binary, but also the tell-tale sign of the two\ndistinct segments that exist within UPX created binaries (sometimes labeled UPX_0 and\n_UPX_1)._\n\n_Figure 6 – UPX Segments_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – Hexdump of Userland Binary_\n\nAs mentioned by Avast Research Labs in their tweet, the userland binary contains custom\nprotobuf files for commands. Unique file paths identified within the binary also indicate the\nusage of Poco (networking libraries), Libboost(verbose set of C++ libraries), and libssh.\n\n_Figure 8 – Hardcoded Development Paths_\n\n\n-----\n\nLacework Labs identified other variants of userland libraries embedded within Sutersu\nvariants (54b1a9338aa7df8a97fea8da863c615352368f3fc67e3caceb6ee65eb71bdbff) that\ncontained Python one-liners. Figure – 9 below shows the embedded Python one-liner that\nfetches a remote binary over FTP via credentials of “winter1qa2ws” with a username of\n“vsftp”.\n\n_Figure 9 – Python One Liner_\n\n## Initial Userland Execution Tasks\n\nUpon initial execution of the userland binary, the program attempts to remove any evidence\nof the dropper by overwriting the install location with junk data (hex value 0xff11). This code\nsnippet below was found in various Sutersu kernel modules as well.\n\n_Figure 10 – Overwriting Previously Created Files_\n\nNext, the userland binary ensures it has access to the directory of /root/ (variable pathName\nin Figure – 11), followed by reading in the current executing binary into a local buffer in order\n[to execute the binary and masquerade under the process name “[kthread]” (T1036.005).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 – Re-spawning Userland Binary as Kthread_\n\nFinally, the main execution loop involves making HTTP GET requests to several domains on\nport 65130 for a resource of “/iplist”. Notably, this port is also included in the Sutersu kernel\nmodule as a port to hide. Every 180 seconds, the binary attempts to spawn sshd on\n127.0.0.1 port 65439 as shown in the sshd Setup from Userland Component image. The\nuserland ELF was executed in an isolated environment where a subset of static domain\nentries were added to /etc/hosts to observe behavior to domain interaction. The image below\nshows the ELF attempting to launch SSH and failure messages for domains not specifically\nlisted in /etc/hosts and that are not reachable.\n\n_Figure 12 – Main Execution of ELF_\n\n## Custom Protobuf\n\n\n-----\n\nAs originally mentioned by Avast, the userland component contains a custom protobuf for\ndefining messages to its C2 server. Lacework Labs was able to carve out the protobuf\nartifacts to identify underlying functionality within the userland component. Additional\nhardcoded strings in the binary indicated that this was protobuf version 2, which allows for\nfields to be optional. This is an important consideration when thinking of whether or not a\nfield will always have data in a protobuf message being sent back to the C2 server. Figure-12\nbelow is a pseudo code representation of the extracted protobuf fields and may not represent\nthe exact protobuf definition.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n  p {\n  cmd\n  SessionInfo\n  desc\n  hide\n  uid\n  Init\n  key\n  sysinfo\n  SystemVersion\n  version\n  system\n  RequestVersion\n  app_type\n  ResponseVersion\n  size\n  app_type\n  RequestUpdateDownload\n  size\n  app_type\n  ResponseUpdateDownload\n  off\n  data\n  app_type\n  Upload_Passwd\n}\ncmd.Upload_Passwd.PasswordInfo{\n  PasswordInfo\n  address\n  port\n  username\n  password\n  Tick\n  Show_Msg\n  message\n  Forward_Data\n  src_uid\n  dest_uid\n  cmd\n  data\n  Host_List\n}\ncmd.Host_List.Host_Info {\n  Host_Info\n  ip\n  system\n  hide\n  version\n  nonlinetime\n  desc\n  Session_Connect\n  uid\n  Session_DisConnect\n  uid\n  Verify\n  username\n  password\n  CommonCommand\n  cmd\n  args\n}\ncmd.CommonCommand.Command_Info {\n  Command_Info\n  name\n  value\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n     _\n  files\n}\ncmd.List_Dir.List_Info {\n  dir\n  List_Info\n  name\n  modify_date\n  isdir\n  size\n  executable\n  readonly\n  writeable\n  Fwd_Beg\n  code\n  message\n  Fwd_Ing\n  data\n  Fwd_End\n  code\n  message\n}\nFigure 13 – Extracted Custom Protobuf\nCustom Ghidra Scripts\nTo aid in the analysis and triage of key IoCs from the malware discussed above,\nLacework Labs is releasing two Ghidra scripts to aid defenders and researchers alike.\nThe dropper ELF contains multiple embedded ELFs for both the userland and the\nSuterusu rootkit component. The HC_Dropper_ID Ghidra script identifies the location\nof these embedded binaries to aid in ELF extraction.\nFigure 14 – Dropper ID\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nThe “HCRootkit_Sutersu” identifies the “vermagic” string that reveals the kernel the\nSuterusu rootkit has been compiled for. Additionally, the script attempts to identify\nembedded IPv4 scripts as well as the ICMP module. Figure – 12 shows the output of\nthe Ghidra script execution.\nFigure 15 – HCRootkit_Sutersu\nConclusion\nUnderstanding the open source offensive utility ecosystem and leveraging those\nresources during analysis can quickly reduce the time it takes to identify critical\nIoCs for your organization. Lacework Labs continues to track evolving threats and\nrelease IoCs as well as Ghidra scripts to help defenders everywhere respond to\nincidents.
