Although not present in earlier builds,\nthe bot is capable of collecting information about the infected host and sending it back to the\ncommand and control (C2) server during registration.\n\nThe information collected seems to vary from build to build, though ZeroFox has observed\nthe following being collected:\n\nHostname\nUsername\n\n\n-----\n\nBuild ID (TEST_BUILD_ + the timestamp of the first run)\nCPU details\nGPU details\nOperating system and version\n\nIf you want to find out more about this malicious botnet and how you can better protect\nyourself against attacks, make sure you read the full ZeroFox diagnostic.\n\nAlso, be sure to also stay on top of any sort of [attacks that might come via Teams.
