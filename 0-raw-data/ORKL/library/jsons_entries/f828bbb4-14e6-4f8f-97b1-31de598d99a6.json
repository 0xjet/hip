Introduction\n\n Executive Summary\n\nDuring June-August of 2020, ClearSky’s team had investigated an offensive campaign attributed with\n\nhigh probability to North Korea, which we call “Dream Job”. This campaign has been active since the\n\nbeginning of the year and it succeeded, in our assessment, to infect several dozens of companies and\n\norganizations in Israel and globally. Its main targets include defense, governmental companies, and\nspecific employees of those companies. Throughout the campaign, the North Korean “Lazarus” group\n\n(aka HIDDEN COBRA) succeeded in manipulating the targets with a “dream job” offering, which was\n\nsent to the employees of said targets. The “dream job” is supposedly sent on behalf of some of the\n\nmost prominent defense and aerospace companies in the US, including Boeing, McDonnell Douglas,\nand BAE. The infection and infiltration of target systems had been carried out through a widespread\nand sophisticated social engineering campaign, which included: reconnaissance, creation of fictitious\nLinkedIn profiles, sending emails to the targets’ personal addresses, and conducting a continuous\ndialogue with the target – directly on the phone, and over WhatsApp. Upon infection, the attackers\ncollected intelligence regarding the company’s activity, and also its financial affairs, probably in order\nto try and steal some money from it. The double scenario of espionage and money theft is unique to\n\nNorth Korea, which operates intelligence units that steal both information and money for their\ncountry.\n\nIn recent months, two parallel investigations, by ESET and McAfee, have been published, presenting\n\nattacks by the group against similar targets in other regions of the world. These publications contain\nseveral overlaps with the attack scenarios that we present in this report. In this report, we explain how\nthe attack was conducted – with LinkedIn as the main attack and manipulation platform – and reveal\nthe main infection scenarios of “Dream Job”, including social engineering tactics and the malware\nused by the attackers. We assess this to be this year’s main offensive campaign by the Lazarus group,\nand it embodies the sum of the group’s accumulative knowledge on infiltration to companies and\n\norganizations around the globe. In our estimation, the group operates dozens of researchers and\n\nintelligence personnel to maintain the campaign globally.\n\nIn 2019, we have revealed evidence of Lazarus’ attack in Israel, whereas the North Korean espionage\ngroup had attempted to infiltrate the network of an Israeli defense company, and since this attack we\n\nhave been monitoring the group’s activity in Israel. In recent months, we have succeeded in identifying\n\nnew indications of the group’s activity in Israel. This report summarizes the investigation we have\n\nconducted, with the help of our customers, and though which we have revealed and analyzed several\nattacks conducted by the group. In the report we present the campaign’s attack scenarios, which\n\ninclude sending a bait to download a file, supposedly containing details of a “dream job” in well-known\n\norganizations, mainly in the aerospace sector.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n4 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nThis report’s main findings include:\n\n  - Social engineering chapter, which presents the stages to targets’ infection and the social\nengineering tactics used to manipulate it.\n\n  - Offensive tools’ analysis chapter, which surveys the three infection scenarios in this campaign:\n\n`o` Infection through a malicious PDF file in an open-source PDF reader, which was\n\naltered to fit the group’s needs. This is the first time this scenario is revealed publicly.\n\n`o` Infection through a Dotm file, which is downloaded from a breached server, takes the\n\nplace of the original file, and runs a malicious macro on the target\n\n`o` Infection through a Doc file containing a malicious macro.\n\n###### Lazarus / Hidden Cobra – a North Korean APT group\n\nThe Lazarus group, also tracked as APT37 and HIDDEN COBRA, and two affiliated sub-groups\nBluenoroff and Andariel[1], are North Korean espionage groups which gained notoriety for the first time\nin 2014, following the Sony breach. That breach was an act of revenge to produce a comedy movie,\n“The Interview”, which was seen by Pyongyang as a threat and humiliation for its leader[2]. As a result,\nmost of Sony’s IT infrastructure has been deleted, and the company’s activities were out of order for\nseveral months. In 2017, the group had conducted one of the most significant ransomware attacks in\nhistory; the attack, named WannaCry, halted the work of dozens of companies around the world, and\ncaused billions of dollars in direct and indirect damages. The attack placed North Korea as a prominent\n\nthreat in cyberspace[3].\n\nHowever, Lazarus’ main activity lies in the financial domain. The group’s activity appears to be a part\n\nof North Korean government’s effort to circumvent the long-standing sanctions placed mainly by the\nUnited States and the United Nations. Indeed, according to one of the UN’s reports from August 2019,\nthe group succeeded in stealing more than 2 billion dollars to finance Pyongyang’s nuclear program[4].\nThe group stands behind several significant cyber heist attempts, while the most well-known is the\nattack on the central Bangladeshi bank, resulting in theft of 81 million dollars[5]. Originally, the group\n\ntried to steal a sum as high as 950 million, but the attack was hamstringed by a human error of the\n\nattackers. Another attack, which was tied to Lazarus and is particularly interesting in the context of this\nreport, took place in 2019 against Redbanc[6], a company that connects the clearing infrastructure of\n\nChile’s banks. One of the attack’s characteristics, which was not seen in Lazarus’ attacks until then, was\n\n1 attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032/\n2 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack\n3 38north.org/2020/02/skleineahlbrandt022820/\n4 reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-cyber-un/north-korea-took-2-billion-in-cyberattacks-to-fund-weaponsprogram-u-n-report-idUSKCN1UV1ZX\n5 reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-bangladesh-northkorea/cyber-security-firm-more-evidence-north-korealinked-to-bangladesh-heist-idUSKBN1752I4\n6 zdnet.com/article/north-korean-hackers-infiltrate-chiles-atm-network-after-skype-job-interview/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n5 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\na direct contact with the target. The attackers had impersonated HR hiring personnel and conducted\ninterviews, also in Spanish, with the victims, mostly on Skype. Maintaining direct contact, beyond\nsending phishing emails, is relatively rare in nation-state espionage groups (APTs); however, as it will\nbe shown in this report, Lazarus have adopted this tactic to ensure the success of their attacks.\n\nIn 2019, the group seemed to have shifted its focus from classical financial institutions to\ncryptocurrency exchanges and development of offensive tools for Mac and Linux operational systems,\n\nin addition to the known tools for Windows. The group’s most widespread attack scenario has been\n\ncreation of an internet page for a front company which deals, supposedly, with cryptocurrency trading.\n\nAt that page, the victim could download a trading app, which was indeed installed on the victim’s\n\ncomputer, but alongside it was also installed a tool that collected information on the victim. Kaspersky\n\ncalled the campaign “AppleJeus”[7].\n\nThe group’s variety of tools and its determination attracted the attention of American intelligence and\nlaw enforcement agencies, manifested in sanctions[8] (some of which were already in effect because of\nthe group’s affiliation with North Korea) and publication of tools related to the group[9]. Lazarus is one\nof the groups, which the US focused on specifically, as part of its Cyber Command and the Department\nof Homeland Security’s effort to hamstring offensive cyber infrastructures of rival countries.\n\n###### Previous research\n\n Lazarus’ attack against an Israeli defense company in 2019\n\nOne of the group’s first targeted attacks, identified by us in March 2019 and tied to it based on similarity\n\nin technical details, targeted an Israeli security company. During the campaign, an email has been sent,\nin flawed Hebrew, to one of the company’s employees. The sender’s address was from within the\ncompany, meaning the attacker had already gained access to one internal email address at least. To\nthe email was attached a WinRAR archive, vulnerable to the CVE-2018-20250[10] vulnerability, which ran\na malicious file in parallel to the archive’s opening.\n\n7 securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/\nsecurelist.com/operation-applejeus-sequel/95596/\n8 home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm924\n9 us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea\n10 nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20250\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n6 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious email in Hebrew\n\nThe malicious executable, run in parallel to the archive file, is a small and basic backdoor, which\ncollects information on the infected computer, apparently for value assessment before further\n\ninfection, and reports to several hardcoded command-and-control (C2) servers. The tool uses a forged\nUser-Agent of the following form:\n\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727;\nSLCC2; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\n\nA code check performed with Intezer Analyzer revealed some similarity between the source code of the\n\nmalware that we have found, and known Lazarus samples, specifically those identified in another\ncampaign, from 2018. The campaign analyzed and named “Operation Sharpshooter”[11] by McAfee, had\ntargeted 87 organizations in 24 countries in the defense, communications, and energy (also nuclear)\nsectors. That campaign’s scenario was different from the one we have found, but code similarity and\nthe connection to a campaign with similar targets strengthened the connection to Lazarus.\n\n###### Operation In(ter)ception: ESET’s research on Lazarus’ attacks published in June 2020\n\nIn June 2020, ESET has published a research[12] on the group’s campaign, which attacked defense and\n\naerospace companies in Europe and the Middle East, between September and December 2019. The\n\ncampaign, which was named “In(ter)ception” after one of the malicious files downloaded by it, made\n\nwide use of social engineering and relied on a modular malware to collect reconnaissance on target\nnetworks. We present the main findings of the ESET report, because it served as a basis for our research\n\nand because it depicts one of the scenarios that we have identified in Israel as well.\n\nAccording to ESET, the attackers made initial contact with the targets through LinkedIn. The attackers\n\ncreated profiles impersonating HR recruiters from international companies in the defense and\naerospace sectors. The copycat profiles sent job offers to the targets, and if those showed interest, a\n\n11 mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-operation-sharpshooter.pdf\n12 welivesecurity.com/2020/06/17/operation-interception-aerospace-military-companies-cyberspies/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n7 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\npassword-protected archive was sent directly or through OneDrive. Upon verifying the activation of the\nfile (the target asked, “what is the password?”), the copycat profiles were deleted. In the archive was a\nLNK file, which runs several commands in the command line: first, a remote PDF is opened and\npresented to the target, for distraction; second, a new folder is created, to which a WMI command line\n\nfile is copied under a different name; finally, a scheduled task is created, in order to ensure initial\npersistence on the infected computer.\n\nUpon gaining initial access and collecting basic information on target computer – mostly network\n\nmapping through Active Directory querying – the attack continues. Through the scheduled task, an XSL\n\nscript is downloaded from an attacker-controlled server; this script downloads the data needed to\n\ncreate and load the downloader, decodes it from base64 with certutil and loads the resulting malicious\n\nDLL. The DLL, which is the downloader for the main tool, downloads the tool’s source code from the\nC2 server and loads it in memory. Because each downloader contains the unique key required to\ndecrypt the main tool, it is possible that there are several scenarios with potentially different keys and\ntools (ClearSky research indeed found additional scenarios).\n\nThe main tool, a DLL, can fingerprint the target computer, and communicate and work with the\nconfiguration file and the modules that are downloaded from the C2 server and add more capabilities\nto the tool. The tool can report the list of existent modules back to the operator, probably to allow\ncapability assessment. Each module can contain up to 4 functions, while several modules can be active\nat the same time. Also, all the tool’s capabilities are initiated as classes during the bootstrapping phase,\ntherefore the modules activate capabilities by using the corresponding classes. Finally, the collected\n\ninformation is packed in a RAR archive and uploaded to Dropbox.\n\nAlthough the main goal of the campaign appears to be espionage, the attackers were seen exploiting\nthe access and the information on the infected computers to conduct business email compromise\n(BEC) fraud. The attackers identified on infected computers information about some invoices to pay,\ncreated domains and email addresses to resemble the infected organization, and sent messages,\ndemanding to pay the invoices to the new addresses. Although this scam did not work, this\n\ncombination of information and money theft is rare and characterizes the North Koreans.\n\n###### Operation North Star: McAfee’s research on Lazarus’ attacks published in July 2020\n\nIn July 2020, another research[13] has been published, by McAfee, which presents another attack\n\nscenario of the “Dream Job” campaign. Although McAfee did not associate the scenario, they have\nfound with ESET’s research, they did attribute the campaign to Lazarus and pointed out the similarities\n\nwith the scenario ESET have found. Through the scenario identified by McAfee, job offerings in the\n\naforementioned sectors were sent as malicious Docx files, which presented the target with decoy\n\ndocuments and downloaded a malicious file template as well. The malicious template, a file with the\n\nDotm extension, injected a malicious DLL library to the target computer, in order to conduct basic\n\nreconnaissance on it.\n\n13 mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-a-job-offer-thats-too-good-to-be-true/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n8 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious library, which was hardcoded in the template, is a “doctored” version of some legitimate\nlibrary, mostly of SQLite. In other words, the injected library is originally benign, and it was altered with\nmalicious functions which, as mentioned, collect initial information on the target, for further\nevaluation. In order to load the malicious functions of the library, the template contains a VBA script.\n\nWhich not only contains the instructions to load the library, but also two of the five parameters\nrequired to do it. When two parameters form the script, and three parameters from the library’s source\n\ncode are present, the malicious functions load properly. It is interesting to note, that the library uses\n\nonly two parameters, however all five must be present. For additional camouflage, when the library\n\nconnects to the C2 server, it mimics the computer’s User-Agent, and if none found – it mimics Mozilla’s\n\ndefault User-Agent.\n\nSimultaneously with those actions, the malicious template also creates a LNK shortcut in the Startup\nfolder of the infected computer, thus ensuring persistence; this is in contrast with ESET’s findings of a\nscheduled task as persistence mechanism.\n\n###### Attack Vector – Job Seekers’ Recruitment Campaign\n\nImpersonation of recruitment managers and reaching out to job seekers is a popular practice among\nAPT groups that rely on social engineering. Since the beginning of 2020, Lazarus also operates a\ncampaign the focuses on enticing job seekers with attractive places. However, North Korea is not the\nonly state that uses this tactic: Iran – and APT33 in particular – operates a widespread campaign that\nfocuses on recruiters’ impersonation too[14].\n\nThe use of this method of reaching out to the target with a tempting offer gives the attackers several\n\nadvantages:\n\n1. Creating a personal connection with the target and creating a false feeling of benefit from the\n\nconversation.\n\n2. Approaching an employee with a tempting job offer limits the target’s ability to speak about it\n\nwith colleagues and prevents information sharing that could jeopardize the whole campaign.\n\n3. The need of discretion is an important component of this process, because the attacker can\n\nmanipulate the target to do certain actions under the pretense of discretion, for example\n\nsending an infected file to the target’s personal email address (also bypassing corporate\n\nsecurity solutions).\n\nIn recent months, and especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an uptick\nin the will of employees to join big, stable working places with better conditions (a “dream job”). This\n\ntendency characterizes periods of crisis and adds to the attackers’ ability to “press on sensitive spots”\nof their targets and persuade them to continue with the infection. Working remotely is another\n\n14 fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n9 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nimportant component of the attackers’ ability to impersonate persons that the targets have never met,\nbecause many business connections are virtual now.\n\nHowever, such social engineering tactics also have their deficiencies. For the attack to succeed, the\nattacker is almost completely dependent on the target and its cooperation. The attacker needs to\n\nemploy sophisticated manipulations of deception and persuasion, because any little suspicion may\nlead to fail and wasted means. The attackers are in risk of their infected files being opened on a\n\ncellphone or in a house network rather than the corporate, which will lead the attackers to a dead end.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n10 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Tools Used by the Espionage Group in the “Dream Job” Campaign\n\nIn “Dream Job” campaign, the group used a variety of tools to infect the target and secure a “foothold”\nin the infected organization. The main part of our review of the campaign deals with the different tools\n\nand social engineering tactics which made the target open the infected file on their computer.\n\nMost of the employed tools were developed by the group itself, and some legitimate tools have been\n\nmodified as well to fit the group’s goals. However, we saw that when the group fails to activate and\n\noperate its own tools, it turns to publicly available tools, some of which are not free. The tools used by\n\nthe group may be divided into several groups:\n\n1. Self-developed tools – tools ingeniously created for this particular campaign. In this campaign\n\nwe have identified several such tools, while most of them are files intended to infect the target\ncomputer. Following is a categorized list of those tools:\n\na. Offensive tools:\n\ni. DBLL Dropper – a DLL file suited for both 32 and 64-bit systems. Those files\n\ninstall the malicious EXE, which is the main RAT. We have called it like that\nbecause its extension is, mostly, .db.\n\nii. DRATzarus – a self-developed RAT, installed from DBLL Dropper. This file\n\nshares similarities with a RAT developed by a group called “Bankshot”, and it\nallows the attackers to install different open source tools.\n\niii. LNK file for redundancy – file which allows the attackers to re-install the\n\nmalware on target computer and maintains their “foothold” on the target.\n\nb. Attack methods:\n\ni. A malicious macro embedded in Doc and Dotm files – a malicious piece of\n\ncode that installs three files used in the second stage of the infection.\n\nii. A Docx file with a malicious template (Template injection) – a file that\n\ndownloads the malicious file from the C2 server, which is a breached site, and\n\nactivates it (the malicious file) instead of the original Docx file.\n\n2. Open source tools – tools used by the group in the fifth stage (when it fails to operate on the\n\ntarget computer). These tools are used to harvest high-privilege credentials on the target,\nmaintain persistence etc. Some of those tools were bought by the group.\n\n###### Tools and Offensive Techniques Categorized with MITRE ATT&CK\n\nThe different tools and techniques used by the group are divided in the following table into two types:\n\n1.

Attackers use\n\nsuch techniques to disguise themselves as colleagues, legitimate service providers etc. thus luring\n\nusers into disclosing private account information or granting the attackers access to machines or\n\nresources, without having to find and exploit a vulnerability. Lazarus is known for its focus on social\n\nengineering and its development of advanced fraud operations. In early 2019, the group executed an\n\nattack against Redbanc – a Chilean interbank network that connected all of the country’s ATM\n\nmachines together – by establishing direct contact with the victim. The attackers impersonated\nHuman Resources recruiters of grand corporates and conducted job interviews with their victims, over\nthe phone and even via Skype, in both English and Spanish.\n\nDuring our research we uncovered social engineering techniques utilized by the group in this\ncampaign, meant to persuade the victim to open a malicious file using his personal or corporate\ncomputer. Similar to the Redbanc campaign, we found evidence to the use of LinkedIn as part of the\nfraud operations carried out in this campaign. The attackers had long conversations with the victims,\nlasting several days to several weeks, during which they utilized techniques meant to lend them\ncredibility.\n\nThe following is a summary of all social engineering techniques used by the group:\n\n1. Creating a fictitious profile impersonating a legitimate company employee (e.g. Boeing)\n\nrelevant to the potential victim’s background.\n\n2. Joining the potential victim’s social circles by adding its friends on social media, thus\n\nestablishing trust and reliability.\n\n3. Initiating primary contact in English and having a conversation in which the victim im is offered\n\nto start a discreet recruitment process for a covered position in their company.\n\n4. An extensive correspondence with the victim, that sometimes lasts days and even weeks,\n\nincluding phone calls and WhatsApp texts. Accompanying the target throughout the actual\ninfection process, in which a malicious file is sent to the victim.\n\n###### Social Engineering methods used to Establish a Credible Attack Infrastructure\n\n First Stage – Creating a Reliable Fictitious Entity\n\nAs mentioned in the above introduction, Lazarus group usually initiates contact with its victims using\n\nfictitious accounts allegedly belonging to recruitment experts in various companies, usually\n\ncompanies affiliated with the aviation and defense sectors such as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. In\n\nthe researched campaign Lazarus uses LinkedIn accounts – an informed choice as LinkedIn is a\n\nbusiness and employment-oriented media most often used by job seekers and recruiters.\n\nFurthermore, in many cases no validation process precedes the approval of new friends. Low\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n14 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nawareness and lack of validation techniques make it easy for the attackers to create multiple fictitious\nentities and establish the impression that the attacker’s entity is part of your business-related social\ncircle. This process can easily take place using Twitter as well, unlike Facebook.\n\nUpon creating a fictitious profile, the attacker adds to its account friends from the alleged company for\nwhich he works (e.g. Boeing) as well as from the victim’s workplace to maximize its credibility and\nminimize the target’s suspicion. Fictitious entities are not created in masses – they are carefully tailored\nto the victims and the operation designed for them, based on extensive reconnaissance research.\n\nDuring our investigation we were able to identify several tailored fictitious accounts. In some cases,\nLazarus attackers create an entirely new entity whereas in others they base their account on a real\n\nprofile found on the media. In these cases, the impostor account is fully copied from the real profile.\n\nFor example, an account impersonating a Human Resources recruiter from Boeing can be created\n\nbased on a real recruiter’s account, and a simple Google search would lead to both the real and\n\nfictitious accounts. Unlike the original profile, the fictitious one would contain numbers in its URI,\ninstead of a full name, as can be seen in the below Google search screenshot.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n15 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing is an example of a profile created to attack employees of defense companies in Israel:\n\n1.

The attackers offer the victim to begin a discreet recruitment process which\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n16 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\ndiscussing the position and process in detail. Below here is a simulation of an initial correspondence\nbetween Lazarus attackers and a victim via LinkedIn.\n\n###### Third Stage – Attacker-Victim Communication\n\nThe communication about the job offer between the attacker behind the fictitious profile and the\n\nvictim can take weeks in not months. As the attackers initiate the contact, the in many cases the victim\n\nis not looking for a new job or willing to leave its current position, the collaboration is not instant.\n\nSignificant persuasion efforts may be required to get the victim to review the offer tailored for them.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n17 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike other known attack methods, in which most of the efforts are invested in the primary contact,\nin this attack scenario efforts and resources are put into both the entity creation and the\n\ncommunication with the victims. Even if the victim is not interested in the position offered by the\nattacker, he is persuaded to fully review the details of the eligible position offered exclusively for him\n\nbefore making up his mind and taking the final decision. The job offer is tailored and discreet –\nincreasing its reliability and decreasing the suspicion that a targeted attack is taking place. The\n\ndiscretion enables the attacker to negotiate with the attackers in length, as its current position is not\n\nendangered by the process.\n\nThe communication begins in the social media, but swiftly proceeds over the phone via WhatsApp, or\n\nby the victim’s personal email, allegedly to ensure discretion. In reality, the transition is meant bypass\n\nsecurity mechanisms and software implemented on the victim’s company account. The use of an\ninstant messaging application to conduct phone calls – in this case WhatsApp – as part of the attack\n\nprocess is unique to this campaign and has not been exposed before. It is a risky choice and a highly\nsensitive operation, as the use of the wrong slang or accent can expose the entire operation.

The attackers attempt to make the\nvictim download the file at his workplace – they do so by studying his daily routine and sending the file\n\nat a carefully selected time. Please note that up until this stage, the attackers avoided using the target’s\n\ncorporate email account. Upon accessing the storage server, the victim downloads an archive file from\n\nwhich the malicious files are extracted. The file names match the company and position discussed\n\nbefore, and the attackers verify with the victim that he has indeed accessed the file.\n\nAt this point, the attackers abruptly cease all communication with the victim. They also close and\n\ndelete profiles used to contact the victim.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n20 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attack Scenarios and Tools Analysis\n\n Introduction\n\nIn the last chapter we have reviewed the social engineering scenario the attackers employ to gain the\nvictim’s trust and send the infection file. During analysis conducted on our customers, we have\n\nidentified five stages to the attack – from the moment the victim receives the malicious file to the\n\ninstallation of tools on their computer. Following is the summary of the five stages:\n\n1. First Stage – at this stage, the attackers continue the social engineering and manipulate the\n\ntarget to open the malicious file on target computer. This is the only stage where we have\n\nidentified different scenarios – the three infection scenarios will be detailed further. In the first\n\ninfection scenario, the group uses malicious PDF files and a PDF reader altered for the group’s\nneeds, while in the second and third scenarios the group uses doc files with an embedded\nmalicious macro code. In ESET’s June report, a similar scenario was revealed, which uses PDF\nfiles as decoys; however, in our research we have identified new infection scenarios. Another\ncharacteristic we have seen is the variety of the decoy documents: it seems that the attackers\nfit the files for each target.\n\nDetails on the three infection scenarios:\n\na. Infection through a malicious PDF file, run with an attacker-modified PDF reader. This\n\nscenario was not revealed until today.\n\nb. Infection through a DOC file, which activates a malicious macro code.\n\nc. Infection through a DOTM file, which is downloaded from the C2 server and activates\n\na macro code.\n\n2. Second Stage – installation of a LNK file (for redundancy) and a DLL library (drops the malware\n\nitself): throughout this stage, the attackers install three new files on the target computer. The\nfirst file is a legitimate file used as a bait, the second file is a LNK file used to maintain\n\npersistence and redundancy on the target, and the third file is a DLL file – which we call DBLL\n\nDropper – the file drops the main RAT on the target.\n\n3. Third and Fourth Stages – installation of a malicious file on the target and dropping of the RAT\n\nfrom it. At this stage, the attackers gain access to the target computer.\n\n4. Fifth Stage – installation of additional tools with the access provided by the RAT; the tools\n\nallow the attacker to perform different actions on the target computer.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n21 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### First Stage – Infection\n\nThe infection process which will be described in this chapter includes three scenarios employed by the\ngroup. All the infection scenarios begin with sending a link to a file storage service, such as OneDrive\nor DropBox, after gaining the target’s trust. The link is passed to the target through WhatsApp or to the\npersonal email address, apparently in the target’s working hours, so they will be inclined to open it\nfrom the corporate working station. In the storage service, the target will find a ZIP or RAR file larger\n\nthan 30 megabytes, containing the bait file. Using archive-type files help the attacker to bypass the\n\ncorporate protection solutions, and their size help them avoid being downloaded to public sandboxes\n\nlike any.run, thus complicating the investigation.\n\nThe file itself is passed, as mentioned earlier, under the pretense of containing information on an open\nposition and includes the salary, the details on the supposed position, and official logos. Most of the\n\nsuggested positions are finance-related. After downloaded the file, the target will be asked to extract\nthe bait document and open it. The bait document does not contain information on the position – only\n\nthe company’s logo and the title of the document. The full document is revealed only after the rest of\nthe files – both malicious and innocuous – are dropped.\n\nIt is worth the note, that dropping the clean decoy document is unique and rare, because in most cases\nthe attackers who use decoy documents do not provide a legitimate file. This tactic is used to gain the\n\nvictim’s trust and dispel any suspicion of a cyber-attack.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n22 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers act with much sensitivity and with high operational security (OPSEC). The infection\nscenarios are completely compartmentalized, so that there will be no queries to the same directory at\nthe C2 server from two different files. Also, every target gets a file with a different hash value, which\nmakes blocking difficult. Analysis of the files shows, that they cannot run on computers that have the\n\nKorean, Japanese, or Chinese language preferences; this limitation resembles the Russian-speaking\ncrime groups, which generally limit their tools to countries outside of the Commonwealth of\n\nIndependent States (CIS).\n\nDuring our analysis, we have identified several main, self-developed tools with a very high level of\n\nsophistication. In addition to those, we have seen the attackers install tools which are not necessarily\n\nself-developed – some can be downloaded freely on the net (e.g. the Chrome password extractor), and\n\nsome can be purchased. If the attackers feel like they fail to operate on the infected computer, they\nseem to lower their OPSEC standards. The following describes the three infection scenarios.\n\nSeveral examples of the different bait files:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n23 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### First infection scenario – PDF files\n\nThis scenario is new and has never been publicly revealed before. In ESET’s analysis on “Operation\n\nIn(ter)ception”, they did show use of innocuous PDF files as bait or decoy documents, however those\nwere only dropped by an extracted LNK file. It should be reminded, that in the 2014 Sony breach the\ngroup used clean PDF files as well[15].The cardinal difference between this scenario and the other\nscenarios in this report is the use of PDF files and not DOC/DOCX. First, the victim will receive a PDF file\nwith the job offer. When they will try to open it on their computer with a regular viewer, they will be\npresented with the first page, containing the impersonated company’s logo, but without the offer. After\nthat, the victim will tell the attacker that they cannot see the rest of the document; the attacker will\nsend an ISO file, which is downloaded from a file storage service. The ISO file contains a special PDF\nreader, named “InternalViewer”. Based on a check we have performed, InternalViewer files can only\nrun on 64-bit systems. Following is a screenshot with the ISO file and those files (the malicious PDF and\n\nits reader):\n\nThose files have few indications on scanning systems. In VirusTotal, the group’s only ISO file is not\nidentified at all by any of the scanning engines, while the InternalViewer file is identified only by 4\n\nengines (as of writing this report). That file is an open-source PDF reader called Sumatra, which was\n\nmodified by the attackers[16].\n\n15 operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf\n16 sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n24 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is how the bait file is presented in a legitimate PDF reader:\n\nWhen run through the altered PDF reader, the file will be rewritten:\n\nThis is how the bait file will look while run through the altered PDF reader:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n25 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nThe InternalViewer file – upon running – will be substituted with a file that can adjust itself to each\ntarget, i.e. two different victims will see two different offers. Similarly to the other scenarios, in this one\nthree files are installed on the target – the legitimate bait file (a PDF file containing the job description\n– the malicious PDF is deleted), the DLL file with the “.db” extension, and a LNK file for redundancy.\n\nFollowing is a screenshot from the PDF object, which shows the extraction of the legitimate file:\n\nAs with the other bait files, this file too has different obfuscation mechanisms, for example XOR-ing the\nHEX:\n\nUsing the PDFiD tool, we investigated the PDF file before and after loading it in the customized reader,\ni.e. the clean and the infected versions. As can be seen in the next picture, the number of objects has\nincreased almost six-fold, and the number of streams has increased more than five-fold. Also, unlike\nthe original file, an additional /ObjStm has was added to the new file, which enfolds the downloading\nof the files:\n\n##### Before After\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n26 | P a g e\n\n\n##### Before\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Second infection scenario – DOC files\n\nIn our assessment, based on lower sophistication compared to the first and the third scenarios, this is\nthe earliest scenario used by the group. It can be estimated that the third scenario, which will be\npresented further on, is an expansion of this scenario. The files are named “Job Description” in this\n\nscenario; the victim receives a DOC file (as opposed to DOCX in the next scenario). After opening the\nfile, the target is requested to run macro scripts by pressing “Enable Editing” – this will download the\nsame three files described in the previous section. Following is an example of one of those macro\ncommands, which calls the desktop.dat file (which is, as will be explained later, actually a DLL file):\n\nIn this scenario, in contrast with the others, we have seen the DLL being dropped under the “.sys”\nexpansion. We estimate that Lazarus uses this tactic to maintain persistence through a service and not\n\nonly through the LNK shortcut.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n27 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Third infection scenario – DOTM files\n\nThis scenario seems to be a more developed, expanded version of the second scenario and it employs\nseveral additional evasion techniques. In late July 2020, McAfee has reported on this scenario[17]. In this\nsection, we will review the scenario and add our insights.\n\nFirst stage – the victim downloads form the storage server the archive file, which contains a DOCX-type\n\nfile; the DOCX file uses template injection to connect to a breached server and download from there a\n\nJPG or PNG-type picture, which is actually a DOTM file.\n\nThis maneuver allows the attackers to bypass corporate security solutions, as there is no apparent\nillegitimate activity: the original file only connects to a legitimate (albeit hacked) server to download a\npicture. The attackers store the files on the C2 server, while their (the files’) names are indicative of the\ncompany they try to impersonate, such as BAE Systems, Bowing, Lockheed Martin etc. Following are\nseveral examples of such tell-tale names:\n\nhxxps://www.geeks-board[.]com/images/themes/logo/boeing_gs_logo.jpg\n\nhxxps://www.fabianiarte[.]com/uploads/png/boeing_gs.png\n\nhxxps://www.paghera[.]com/img-head/thumb/lib/disney_dds_log.jpg\n\nThe dotm file oftentimes contains between one and three pages, while the first page contains the\n\nimpersonated company’s name and a title that suits the job offer, and the two other pages are\nsometimes seen (with no content) and sometimes not, and their content can only be viewed after\nclicking “Enable Editing”.\n\nSecond stage – after downloading the DOTM file, the target is presented with a request to run a\nmalicious macro, which is written in VBA and can only be ran by the target. Three additional files, which\n\nare loaded as DLLs and contacted by the macro, are wsuser.db, wsdts.db, and desktop.ini.\nOccasionally, we have seen the attackers guide the victim to “Enable Editing”, to run the macro. In\n\nsome cases, even after running the macro the victim ran into some troubles, and the attackers took\ncare of those. Generally, it can be said that the attackers are very communicative and helpful, showing\n\nwill to guide and help the victim if any problems arise.\n\n###### Second Stage – LNK and DLL Files\n\nOnce the initial infection process is complete (using one of the three mentioned methods), two types\n\nof files are deployed to the infected machine (in addition to the legitimate lure in the form of a job\n\noffer).\n\n17 mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-a-job-offer-thats-too-good-to-be-true/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n28 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n  - The first file is an LNK, meaning a shortcut file, designed to establish persistence on the\ninfected machine and enable re-installation in case the malware is removed.\n\n  - The second file is a DLL library that deploys the malware itself. This chapter will detail the DLL’s\nmain components.\n\n###### The LNK File\n\nWhen the file is activated, the DLL on the machine is executed anew. The file extensions are mostly .db,\n\nbut ClearSky analysts have identified a .sys extension for a file located in a singular incident, named\n\nPCAudit.sys. we estimate that when the attackers wish to run the DLL as a service, they utilize the .sys\n\nfile instead of .db.\n\nPresenting the relevant code segments to the DLL execution (using the mentioned shortcut):\n\n###### DBLL Dropper\n\nOnce the malicious DLL is deployed, the attackers install a designated RAT on the infected network. All\nof the DLLs used can detect whether they are on the correct network at the time of activation, and do\n\nnot activate if the lure file is opened in a different network, or a mobile device. The tools also use\n\nvarious systems to detect Sandbox or VMware services.\n\nClearSky analysts located two types of libraries during our investigation, the first intended for 64-bit\nsystems, and the second for 32-bit. We named these files “Dropper DBLL”, as the extensions are\n\nmostly .db. During our research we observed the LNK’s capability to deploy these files.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n29 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nEach file is packed using Packer Themida, evident from the _+CTRL string:\n\nThe file is downloaded to varying folders on the infected machine. For example:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\ThumbNail\\thumbnail.db\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\desktop.ini\n\nThe file is executed using rundll32.exe, similarly to the process of establishing persistence that sets the\n\npath to which the DLL is unloaded using the CtrlPanel function:\n\nC:\\windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe \"C:\\ProgramData\\ThumbNail\\thumbnail.db\", CtrlPanel S-6-813811-75432205-060098-6872 0 0 905 1\n\nWe identified a plethora of obfuscation and concealment systems in this file, designed to avoid virtual\nmachines or various Sandbox services. These systems allow the attackers to remain “under the radar”\nof security mechanisms and penetrate the organization, for example VMprotect.\n\nThese methods, in addition to the infection and social engineering processes, evidence a high level of\neffort put in to avoiding identification or detection. If the DLL detects an unwanted domain, or a mobile\n\ndevice file activation, it does not activate.\n\nFurther details regarding these files are available in a recent McAfee research.\n\n###### Third and Fourth Stages \n\n General Overview\n\nThe DLL unloads several PE EXE files, designated to install a group-developed Trojan Access Remote.\nDuring the preliminary research, we identified many resemblances to Bankshot, another self\ndeveloped RAT that was uncovered in 2018 by the US government[18]. The resemblances diminished as\nfollowing files were identified.\n\nDuring the course of researching companies which were attacked, we observed the successful\ninstallation of hacking tool in two cases, meaning that the Trojan was able to exfiltrate data from the\n\ninfected computers. The installed files only operate using specific parameters, which made the\n\ninvestigation much more challenging.\n\n###### Technical Analysis\n\nThree actions related to the RAT installation are performed at this stage:\n\n  - An EXE bearing the name of a general-purpose software is unloaded, operating as the Dropper\n\nfor the RAT.\n\n18 us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10135536-B_WHITE.PDF\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n30 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n  - The RAT itself is deployed.\n\n  - A variant of the RAT that is capable of additional operations is also deployed.\n\nInitially, a preliminary EXE is unloaded, bearing an innocuous name such as IExplorer.exe and packed\n\nusing UPX. This file has a single designation, which is to deploy two additional files. The first is the RAT\n\nand the second is designed to be a backup on the machine in addition to a few other operations. The\nRAT is sometimes named Flash.exe. We named this RAT DRATzarus.\n\nThe IExplorer file impersonates a legitimate Explorer client:\n\nThe file’s code is meager, yet encompasses many detection avoidance techniques, as detailed:\n\n  - Sleep: the capability to remotely shut down the tool or automatically shutting it down locally\nunder specific conditions.\n\n  - IsDebuggerPresent: this is one of the most familiar Anti-Debug functions in the API Calls\ncategory. The infected machine is examined using API for specific flags in PEB that are\ndesigned to detect whether a Debugger is present, and if a debugging process was initiated\n(common in Sandbox systems).\n\n  - GetTickCount: another Anti-Debug function that conducts function timing, meaning\n\nmeasuring the time necassery for different operations. In case of an elongated process time,\n\nthe operations are halted to prevent their decryption.\n\n  - GetSystemTimeAsFileTime: similar to GetTickCount.\n\nThe code is also partly encrypted with XOR.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n31 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nPlease note that the file’s header is MZ, while the header PE appears after the XOR encryption, also\n\nsignifying an executable:\n\nThe file uses Invoker privileges instead of Admin or higher to install the RAT, using the next code\n\nsegment:\n\n<requestedExecutionLevel level=\"asInvoker\" uiAccess=\"false\"></requestedExecutionLevel>\n\nThe RAT is unloaded to the desktop, according to the following PDB path located by ClearSky analysts:\n\nC:\\Users\\joe-user\\Desktop\\3zvQ751hQF.exe\n\nOur continued research of the files exposed a version of this RAT from 2019. Comparing the code, we\n\nlocated amongst the company’s clients with the code from Virus Total we identified at least 22 DIFF\n\nfunction results that attest to identical segments. Most of the code is identical apart from differing\n\nobfuscation systems.\n\nThe RAT’s main operationality is to deploy additional attack tools, while these are partly open source\n\nand partly commodity software, to enable further activity on the infected machine. Seeing as previous\niterations by the group did not utilize publicly available tools.\n\nCommunication with the C2 is performed using HTTP or HTTPS protocols (ports 80 or 443) instead of\n\nDNS queries. When comparing the later files’ source code from GitHub it becomes apparent that it\n\nmostly congregates with the APT Lazarus:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n32 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nThe executable mostly does not perform lateral movement, focusing on initially examining and\ncategorizing the infected machine. For example, the R table is scrutinized to detect whether the\n\nmachine exists in the target domain and what other machines are connected to the network (including\n\ndetecting whether other machines are accessible). Further examined details are whether Shell can be\ninstalled, which users exist on the infected machine, and an attempt to map the network is made. No\nfully active operations take place.\n\nDuring our research, we did not identify external to internal network movement (this includes the file’s\ninability to be installed on a removeable USB), however these capabilities are still in the realm of\npossibility.\n\n###### Fifth Stages – Additional Tools\n\nWhen we arrive at this phase, the attackers have installed the RAT and now have control of the infected\n\nmachine.\n\nUnlike common Trojan Access Remote applications by the group, this scenario mainly entails\ndeploying public files, partly open source and partly commodity software. Many of the files are taken\nfrom the NirSoft (an Israeli developer named Nir Sofer, that has developed dozens of different attack\ntools offered for free online) tool kit. Several examples:\n\n  - Responder: an open source tool that is used for Poisoner mDNS/LLMNR/NBT-NS, which is\ndownloadable from GitHub. The tool enables structured authentication of MSSQL servers[19]\n\namongst other capabilities.\n\n  - Wake-On-Lan: a NirSoft tool that enables remotely turning machines on and off through\n\nsending a Wake-On-Lan package to a remote machine[20].\n\n  - ChromePass: a NirSoft tool that enables the extraction of credentials from Google Chrome[21].\n\nIt is apparent that these operations are performed after unsuccessfully attempting to conduct actions\n\non the infected machine, and that the attackers are prepared to invest in attack tools in place of self\n19 github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder\nattack.mitre.org/software/S0174/\n20 nirsoft.net/utils/wake_on_lan.html\n21 nirsoft.net/utils/chromepass.html\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n33 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\ndeveloping them (possibly in an effort to save development time, or lowered OPSEC at failed instances\nof attack).\n\nWe identified that once the attackers take hold of the network, word searches are performed on the\nmachine and in documents that deal in security or financial matters, which is also the source of our\n\nassessment of the scenario’s goals.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n34 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attribution \n\n Introduction\n\n‘Dream Job’ is an extensive attack infrastructure used in an operation against tens of targets the Middle\nEast and worldwide in the past year. We affiliate the operation with high confidence to The Korean APT\n\ngroup Lazarus. The group has been actively targeting companies affiliated with the defense sector over\n\nthe past few years.\n\nIn 2019, ClearSky researchers revealed an attack attempt against an Israeli security company carried\nout by the group[22]. The attack was revealed by ClearSky researchers in collaboration with research\n\ncolleagues, by affiliating an EML file containing a malicious attachment which was uploaded to\n\nVirusTotal by an employee of a sensitive security company in Israel. The attachment contained an\narchive RAR file vulnerable to a zero-day flaw. An investigation of the source code of the malicious file\nusing the Intezer Malware Analysis engine revealed a great overlap with code used by Lazarus. ClearSky\nanalysts have been monitoring the group activity since the exposure of this operation, which marked\nthe first attack of a North Korean APT group against an Israeli target.\n\nIn June 2020 ESET published a research whose findings aided our current investigation. In the following\nchapter, we will review the attribution of the attack group from several aspects – code overlap,\noperational similarities and, TTPs and victim profiles.\n\n###### Code Overlap\n\nCode overlap can be divided into two types – an overlap in the source code of the attack tools – as well\n\nas similarities to other attack tools used by the group – and in the attack methods used in this\noperation compared to previous ones.\n\n###### Source Code Overlap\n\nIn 2019, a Lazarus campaign which focused on career job seekers was published and was dubbed\n\n‘Falsified Job Recruitment’. A comparison between the source code of the dll files found during the\n\ninvestigation of the 2019 campaign, and those analyzed by our researchers in the current research,\nreveals a great similarity between the files. Additionally, over 11.5% of the source code of the RAT found\n\nduring the current investigation is identical to a code commonly used by Lazarus.\n\n22 haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-north-korean-hackers-cited-in-rare-attack-in-israel-1.7059457\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n35 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the characteristics of the campaign covered in this report is the use of a packer – a tool designed\nto pack the source code for detection evasion – called Themida[23]. This packer is commonly used by\nLazarus[24] as well as sub-groups such as Andariel[25]. Although a packer available online can be used by\nmultiple groups is appears that Lazarus uses the Themida packer regularly. Another similarity pointed\nout by ESET researchers is a source code similarity with the NukeSped tool, previously affiliated with\n\nLazarus[26]. According to ESET, the headers and ‘code-flattening’ techniques identified in the 2019\ncampaign were also observed in several past campaigns[27] and are similar to those of the NukeSped\ntool as well.\n\n###### Similarities to known Lazarus Attack Tools and Advancement of Known Attack Methods New Attack Techniques\n\nRevealed in July 2020 by McAfee, operation North Star revolved around one out of three of the attack\nmethods presented in this report. McAfee researchers affiliated the North Star operation with the\nLazarus APT based on the great similarity in the modus operandi of the operation to that of previous\nLazarus campaigns researched by the company between 2017 and 2019. The greatest code overlap,\nhowever, can be observed in the Visual Basic code which forms the malicious macros in the first and\n\nsecond attack methods presented here, compared to that used in Lazarus campaigns between 2017\nand 2019.\n\n23 oreans.com/Themida.php\n24 us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea\n25\n\nglobal.ahnlab.com/global/upload/download/techreport/%5BAhnLab%5DAndariel_a_Subgroup_of_Lazarus%\n20(3).pdf\n26 fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/deep-analysis-nukesped-rat\n27 securelist.com/mata-multi-platform-targeted-malware-framework/97746/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n36 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Techniques, Tactics and Procedures\n\nDuring our investigation we uncovered several overlaps between the ‘Dream Job’ attack infrastructure\nand the Lazarus APT group. The similarities were found by comparing our findings to those of previous\n\nreports covering Lazarus APT activities, and to attack techniques used by group listed in the MITRE\n\nATT&CK knowledge base.\n\nIn 2018, a North Korean citizen was accused of acting as part of the attack group, while executing\nattacks against the defense sector via LinkedIn profiles among other means[28]. The use of LinkedIn by\n\nLazarus as an attack vector was also mentioned by ESET in their last report reviewing the group.\n\nAnother attack vector known to be in common use by the group and found on our investigation is the\n\nimpersonation of airlines from all around the world, among them Boeing. These two vectors assist us\n\nin the affiliation the attack covered in this report to Lazarus with high confidence.\n\nIn 2019 ClearSky researchers discovered an attack attempt by the North Korean group against an Israeli\nsecurity company. During the operation, the attackers sent the victim a malicious RAR document called\n‘SysAid-Documentation’ that contained an exploit of the vulnerability assigned CVE-2018-20250,\nassociated with the group. A file called ‘Thumbs.db.lnk’ had also been revealed in that attack – the file\nwas used to stabilize the group’s access to the victim company network. The overlap in the file names\nand types, as well as the victim company sector, are yet another proof of our attribution of the attack\ncovered in this report to Lazarus.\n\nThe following table summarizes all the overlapping TTPs between our findings and known techniques\n\nused by Lazarus covered in previous research:\n\nTTP ID – MITRE ATT&CK Name Use\n\nT1071.001 Application Layer Protocol: A Lazarus Group malware sample\n\nWeb Protocols conducts C2 over HTTP.\n\n28 justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1092091/download\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n37 | P a g e\n\n|used by Lazarus covered in|previous research:|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|TTP ID – MITRE ATT&CK|Name|Use|\n|T1071.001|Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols|A Lazarus Group malware sample conducts C2 over HTTP.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|T1560.003|Archive via Custom Method|A Lazarus Group malware sample encrypts data using a simple byte based XOR operation prior to exfiltration.|\n|---|---|---|\n|T1547.009|Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder|A Lazarus Group malware sample adds persistence on the system by creating a shortcut in the user’s Startup folder.|\n|T1543.003|Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service|Several Lazarus Group malware families install themselves as new services on victims.|\n|T1564.001|Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories|A Lazarus Group VBA Macro sets its file attributes to System and Hidden|\n|T1055.001|Process Injection: Dynamic- link Library Injection|A Lazarus Group malware sample performs reflective DLL injection.|\n\n\n###### Target Sectors \n\nDuring the past few years, Lazarus has been actively attacking financial institutions such as\n\ncryptocurrency exchanges. In the last two years, the group has also been attacking companies\naffiliated with defense and aviation sectors.\n\nLazarus is also the group behind the ‘Operation Sharpshooter’, a global campaign which targeted\nnuclear, defense, energy, and financial companies. According to McAfee, attack methods like those\n\nfound during our investigation has been observed in use by the group in 2017 and 2019[29]. In 2017 a\ncampaign targeting job seekers has taken place. Based on these findings, we conclude that the\n\ntargeted sectors in our research had also been under the group’s scope in previous campaigns.\n\nAlthough the prime goal of this campaign is espionage, it also has financial aspects. As mentioned in\n\nESET report, the attackers leveraged the information obtained during the campaign to carry out\n\ntargeted financial BEC fraud – Business Email Compromise – against the target companies’ employees\n\nand customers. During our investigation we observed that the attackers searched financial-related\n\nkeyword in the infected machines – which means that also in this attack, a financial motivation has\nalso influenced the group’s activities.\n\n29 blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/01/fake-korean-job-posting.html\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n38 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Summary and Insights\n\n About the Attacker \n\n1. We estimate that ‘Dream Job’ operation is the primary campaign of Lazarus in 2020: in the past\n\ntwo months the North Korean group’s activity was uncovered in two reports reviewing its\n\nattack methods campaigns targeting job seekers. This attack infrastructure is used primarily\n\nfor social engineering frauds tailored to the victim’s background. We believe that it is\n\nsupported by tens of activists maintaining and infrastructure and relations with the victims.\n\n2. Dual mission - Theft and Espionage: One of the top identifiers of Lazarus is their dual attack\n\nmission – money theft and espionage. This modus operandi is unique to North Korea, as other\n\nstate actors usually focus on espionage only. North Korean money theft operations are carried\nout in service of the government, as a way of funding the nuclear program.\n\n3. Advanced Social Engineering Techniques – The North Korean group has enhanced its\n\noperational toolset by establishing a new social engineering attack infrastructure. This\ninfrastructure is quite sensitive, and even a single mistake can take down an operation, unlike\na network access campaign, in which a vulnerability is exploited, which is generally a safer\nchoice. The new infrastructure includes tens of fictitious profiles which are the product of\nextensive reconnaissance work. The group invested a lot of efforts in the creation of credible\naccounts, and it appears that in the past few months a significant upgrade has been observed\nin this arena. The group representatives have improved their English skills and are not afraid\n\nto communicate with its victims directly via WhatsApp texts or phone calls. However, we must\nnote that the English level demonstrated by the attackers is far from perfect.\n\n4. Information sharing – it is possible that “Lazarus” is targeting defense companies and sharing\n\nthe data with other states, like Iran.\n\n###### Social engineering \n\n1. Securing Home Environments – Employees working remotely from home, especially during\n\nquarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic, poses new challenges for organizations aiming to\n\npreserve the same level of security even considering the changes. We estimate that attacks\n\nleveraging network vulnerabilities caused by the remote work will continue and increase.\n\n2. Attacks leveraging LinkedIn –Lazarus has been leveraging the professional oriented social\n\nnetwork as vector of attack. LinkedIn is an ideal attack platform when it comes to new career\nopportunities. It enables to attackers focus their efforts in their specific targets and create\nprofiles tailored to lure the victims into communicating with the impostor. Due to its\n\nreputation, the use of LinkedIn provides reliability to the imposter profiles and enables easy\n\ncollection of information about the victim’s professional background.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n39 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n3. LinkedIn profile Protection – we believe that LinkedIn has yet to develop sufficient security\n\nmechanisms and protect its users against impostor accounts. We find it alarming that a\nfictitious profile, copycat an existing account, can be open and use without alerting to source\nprofile from which the information was stolen, as well as profiles contacted by the new\n\nimposter profile. Furthermore, the network does not initiate a validation process upon\naffiliating an account with a registered company or describing an account as belonging to a\n\nrecruiter or a Human Resources expert. In the first stage of the fraud, Lazarus create a solid\n\nnetwork of connections around the impostor’s profile thus establishing its credibility. It seems\n\nthat for now, LinkedIn is ideal platform for professional imposter profiles.\n\n4. Leveraging Global Corporates: impersonating profile connected to large defense companies,\n\nwith thousands of employees, enabled the attackers an even easier way to gain the victim’s\ntrust, as naturally, no-one can verify all of the corporate’s employees.\n\n5. Bypass Corporate Protections – direct contact with employees via their personal profiles and\n\nprivate emails creates easy bypass of their company’s network protections, especially when\nusing both environments on company computers. It enables North Korean Lazarus group to\npenetrate to sensitive corporate networks.\n\n6. Employee Infection – a single infected employee can lead to the infection of the entire\n\ncorporate network, risking the employee’s position in the company and generally, its\nprofessional reputation.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n40 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Recommendations\n\n Social Engineering\n\nThe primary way to prevent social engineering attacks, is to raise awareness and doubt messages\n\nreceived from unknown profiles or email senders. We provide several methods for the detection and\n\nprevention of social engineering attack, specially “dream job” operations:\n\n1. Avoid receiving and opening documents containing job descriptions: we recommend that the\n\ninformation about position will provided to you via a link to a professional career portal, rather\n\nthan as a document which could potentially be leveraged for infection. We also recommend\n\ncross-referencing the information provided to you with the company’s official website.\n\n2. Take extra caution when using LinkedIn: we encourage you to thoroughly review the profile of\n\nthe person with whom you are in contact, verify that they indeed work for the company they\nrepresent and search for similar profiles with a higher level of credibility. We recommend\nreceiving job offers only from verified company-affiliated accounts – make sure that the\ncompany listed in the profile is not misspelled (e.g. ‘The Boeing Company’ instead of the\ncorrect spelling – ‘Boeing’).\n\n3. Refrain from providing your personal information – phone number and email address in\n\nparticular – prior to the verification of the person which reached out to you.\n\n4. Malicious documents – when opening the malicious file sent by Lazarus, the victim can only\n\nview the first page and to access the rest of the document, they must enable content, enable\nmacro, or install a PDF reader. When coming across a document with similar features, please\n\nbe alarmed and do not enable the content.\n\n5. Self-Expression Level – When receiving a job offer or application, we must expect a standard\n\nlevel of expression which is in line with the person’s country of origin and position in the\ncompany. In the ‘Dream Job’ operation we noticed that despite the high credibility of the\naccounts, the impostors’ level of expression was lower then expected, which indicates that this\nis not their native language.\n\n###### Attack Mitigation\n\n1. Consider disabling file download from private email accounts to company machines when the\n\nemployee is connected to the company network. Additionally, try to avoid access to personal\n\nemail accounts on machines connected to the company network. We recommend forbidding\n\nemployees to access ‘WhatsApp Web’ as well as any other web-client of instant messaging\napplication from company machines who can access sensitive resources.\n\n2. Examine the communication between desktop Office software and external servers to locate\n\nany template injection attack attempts. Additionally, disable automatic file downloads from\n\nexternal servers.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n41 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Install EDR software (Endpoint Detection and Response) and monitor the unloading of LNK\n\nand DLL files from other files on a machine under attack. In addition, monitor the DLL files\nstored on the machine to prevent DLL injection attacks. If a suspicious DLL file is found, you\ncan examine its last modification time – if the update time is recent, it means it had been\n\nreplaced. Lastly, monitor files running by the rundll32.exe application.\n\n4. Disable LNK files is possible, as can reference any original file, folder or application.\n\n5. Disable macros in all document files.\n\n6. Do not enable the download and install of any unverified PDF reader from any unknown\n\nwebsite. Furthermore, we recommend forbidding employees from installing .exe files on their\n\ncompany machines or downloading such files without the approval of an IT expert.\n\n7. Any file downloaded from a storage service must be downloaded to a designated testing\n\nenvironment and scanned prior to its transfer to the organizational network.\n\n8. We recommend using a variety of tools simulating a virtual environment, as many malicious\n\nfiles cease their activity when such environment is detected on the machine.\n\n9. Do now allow the download of ISO files.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: White – Information is provided to the recipient only, and may not be distributed outside the initial exchange**\n\n42 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Indicators of Compromise\n\n Hashes\n\nMD5 File Name Uploads to Virus Type\n\nTotal from\n\nsignificant\ncountries\n\nFirst Infection Method\n\nBoeing_GS.pdf\n48405332ee067cdf29077b317dc7c555 -
