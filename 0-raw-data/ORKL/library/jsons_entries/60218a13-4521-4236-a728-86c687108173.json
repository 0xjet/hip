    "plain_text": "# APT trends report Q2 2021\n\n**securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2021/103517**\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nFor more than four years, the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky\nhas been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity.\nThe summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative\nsnapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT\nreports. They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel\npeople should be aware of.\n\nThis is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q2 2021.\n\nReaders who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more\n[information on a specific report are encouraged to contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## The most remarkable findings\n\nInvestigating the recent Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities we and our colleagues from\nAMR found an attacker deploying a previously unknown backdoor, “FourteenHi”, in a\ncampaign that we dubbed ExCone, active since mid-March. During our investigation we\nrevealed multiple tools and variants of FourteenHi, configured with infrastructure that\n\n\n-----\n\nFireEye reported as being related to the UNC2643 activity cluster. Moreover, we saw\nShadowPad detections coincide with FourteenHi variant infections, possibly hinting at a\nshared operator between these two malware families.\n\nFourteenHi abuses the popular VLC media player to execute its loader. It is capable of\nperforming basic backdoor functions. Further investigation also revealed scripts used by\nthe actor to gain situational awareness post-exploitation, as well as previous use of the\ninfrastructure to operate Cobalt Strike Beacon.\n\nAlthough we couldn’t directly attribute this activity to any known threat actor, we found\nolder, highly similar 64-bit samples of the backdoor used in close proximity with\nShadowPad malware, mostly known for its operations involving supply-chain attacks as\nan infection vector. Notably, we also found one C2 IP used in a 64-bit sample reportedly\nused in the UNC2643 activity set, associated with the HAFNIUM threat actor, also using\nCobalt Strike, DLL side-loading and exploiting the same Exchange vulnerabilities.\n\n## Russian-speaking activity\n\nOn May 27 and 28, details regarding an ongoing email campaign against diplomatic\nentities throughout Europe and North America were released by Volexity and Microsoft.\nThese attacks were attributed to Nobelium and APT29 by Microsoft and Volexity\nrespectively. While we were able to verify the malware and possible targeting for this\ncluster of activity, we haven’t been able to make a definitive assessment at this time about\nwhich threat actor is responsible, although we found ties to Kazuar. We have designated it\nas a new threat actor and named it “HotCousin”. The attacks began with a spear-phishing\nemail which led to an ISO file container being stored on disk and mounted. From here,\nthe victim was presented with a LNK file made to look like a folder within an Explorer\nwindow. If the victim double clicked on it, the LNK then executed a loader written in\n.NET referred to as BoomBox, or a DLL. The execution chain ultimately ended with a\nCobalt Strike beacon payload being loaded into memory. According to public blogs,\ntargeting was widespread but focused primarily on diplomatic entities throughout Europe\nand North America: based on the content of the lure documents bundled with the\nmalware, this assessment appears to be accurate. This cluster of activity was conducted\nmethodically beginning in January with selective targeting and slow operational pace,\nthen ramping up and ending in May. There are indications of previous activity from this\nthreat actor dating back to at least October 2020, based on other Cobalt Strike payloads\nand loaders bearing similar toolmarks.\n\n## Chinese-speaking activity\n\nWhile investigating a recent rise of attacks against Exchange servers, we noticed a\nrecurring cluster of activity that appeared in several distinct compromised networks. This\ncluster stood out because it used a formerly unknown Windows kernel mode rootkit and a\nsophisticated multi-stage malware framework aimed at providing remote control over the\nattacked servers. The former is used to hide the user mode malware’s artefacts from\n\n\n-----\n\ninvestigators and security solutions, while demonstrating an interesting loading scheme\ninvolving the kernel mode component of an open source project named “Cheat Engine” to\nbypass the Windows Driver Signature Enforcement mechanism. We were able to\ndetermine that this toolset had been in use from as early as July 2020; and that the threat\nactor was mostly focused on Southeast Asian targets, including several governmental\nentities and telecoms companies. Since this was a long-standing operation, with highprofile victims, an advanced toolset and no affinity to a known threat actor, we decided to\nname the underlying cluster “GhostEmperor”.\n\nAPT31 (aka ZIRCONIUM) is a Chinese-speaking intrusion set. This threat actor set up an\nORB (Operational Relay Boxes) infrastructure, composed of several compromised SOHO\nrouters, to target entities based in Europe (and perhaps elsewhere). As of the publication\nof our report in May, we had seen these ORBs used to relay Cobalt Strike communications\nand for anonymization proxying purposes. It is likely that APT31 uses them for other\nimplants and ends as well (for example, exploit or malware staging). Most of the\ninfrastructure put in place by APT31 comprises compromised Pakedge routers (RK1, RE1\nand RE2). This little-known constructor specializes in small enterprise routers and\nnetwork devices. So far, we don’t know which specific vulnerability has been exploited by\nthe intrusion set to compromise the routers. Nor do we currently possess telemetry that\nwould provide further visibility into this campaign. We will, of course, continue to track\nthese activities.\n\nFollowing our previous report on EdwardsPheasant, DomainTools and BitDefender\npublished articles about malicious activities against targets in Southeast Asia which we\nbelieve, with medium to high confidence, are parts of EdwardsPheasant campaigns.\nWhile tracking the activities of this threat actor, analyzing samples discovered or\nprovided by third parties, and investigating from public IoCs, we discovered an updated\nDropPhone implant, an additional implant loaded by FoundCore’s shellcode, several\npossible new infection documents and malicious domain names, as well as additional\ntargets. While we do not believe we have a complete picture of this set of activities yet, our\nreport this quarter marks a significant step further in understanding its extent.\n\nA Chinese-speaking APT compromised a certificate authority in Mongolia and replaced\ndigital certificate management client software with a malicious downloader in February.\nWe are tracking this group as BountyGlad. Related infrastructure was identified and used\nin multiple other incidents: interesting related activity included server-side attacks on\nWebSphere and WebLogic services in Hong Kong; and on the client-side, Trojanized\nFlash Player installers. The group demonstrated an increase in strategic sophistication\nwith this supply-chain attack. While replacing a legitimate installer on a high value\nwebsite like a certificate authority requires a medium level of skill and coordination, the\ntechnical sophistication is not on par with ShadowHammer. And while the group deploys\nfairly interesting, but simplistic, steganography to cloak its shellcode, we think it was\nprobably generated with code that has been publicly available for years. Previous activity\nalso connected with this group relied heavily on spear-phishing and Cobalt Strike\nthroughout 2020. Some activity involved PowerShell commands and loader variants\n\n\n-----\n\ndifferent from the downloaders presented in our recent report. In addition to spearphishing, the group appears to rely on publicly available exploits to penetrate unpatched\ntarget systems. They use implants and C2 (Command and Control) code that are a mix of\nboth publicly available and privately shared across multiple Chinese-speaking APTs. We\nare able to connect infrastructure across multiple incidents. Some of those were focused\non Western targets in 2020. Some of the infrastructure listed in an FBI Flash alert\npublished in May 2020, targeting US organizations conducting COVID-19 research, was\nalso used by BountyGlad.\n\nWhile investigating users infected with the TPCon backdoor, previously discussed in a\nprivate report, we detected loaders which are part of a new multi-plugin malware\nframework that we named “QSC”, which allows attackers to load and run plugins inmemory. We attribute the use of this framework to Chinese-speaking groups, based on\nsome overlaps in victimology and infrastructure with other known tools used by these\ngroups. We have so far observed the malware loading a Command shell and File Manager\nplugins in-memory. We believe the framework has been used in the wild since April 2020,\nbased on the compilation timestamp of the oldest sample found. However, our telemetry\nsuggests that the framework is still in use: the latest activity we detected was in March\nthis year.\n\nEarlier this month, Rostelecom Solar and NCIRCC issued a joint public report describing\na series of attacks against networks of government entities in Russia. The report\ndescribed a formerly unknown actor leveraging an infection chain that leads to the\ndeployment of two implants – WebDav-O and Mail-O. Those, in conjunction with other\npost-exploitation activity, have led to network-wide infections in the targeted\norganizations that resulted in exfiltration of sensitive data. We were able to trace the\nWebDav-O implant’s activity in our telemetry to at least 2018, indicating government\naffiliated targets based in Belarus. Based on our investigation, we were able to find\nadditional variants of the malware and observe some of the commands executed by the\nattackers on the compromised machines.\n\nWe discovered a cluster of activity targeting telecom operators within a specific region.\nThe bulk of this activity took place from May to October 2020. This activity made use of\nseveral malware families and tools; but the infrastructure, a staging directory, and incountry target profiles tie them together. The actors deployed a previously unknown\npassive backdoor, that we call “TPCon”, as a primary implant. It was later used to perform\nboth reconnaissance within target organizations and to deploy a post-compromise toolset\nmade up mostly of publicly available tools. We also found other previously unknown\nactive backdoors, that we call “evsroin”, used as secondary implants. Another interesting\nfind was a related loader (found in a staging directory) that loaded a KABA1 implant\nvariant. KABA1 was an implant used against targets throughout the South China Sea that\nwe attributed to the Naikon APT back in 2016. On another note, on the affected hosts we\nfound additional multiple malware families shared by Chinese-speaking actors, such as\nShadowPad and Quarian backdoors. These did not seem to be directly connected to the\nTPCon/evsroin incidents because the supporting infrastructure appeared to be\n\n\n-----\n\ncompletely separate. One of the ShadowPad samples appears to have been detected in\n2020, while the others were detected well before that, in 2019. Besides the Naikon tie, we\nfound some overlaps with previously reported IceFog and IamTheKing activities.\n\n## Middle East\n\nBlackShadow is a threat group that became known after exfiltrating sensitive documents\nfrom Shirbit, an Israeli insurance company, and demanding a ransom in exchange for not\nreleasing the information in its possession. Since then, the group has made more\nheadlines, breaching another company in Israel and publishing a trove of documents\ncontaining customer related information on Telegram. Following this, we found several\nsamples of the group’s unique .NET backdoor in our telemetry that were formerly\nunknown to us, one of which was recently detected in Saudi Arabia. By pivoting on new\ninfrastructure indicators that we observed in those samples, we were able to find a\nparticular C2 server that was contacted by a malicious Android implant and shows ties to\nthe group’s activity.\n\nWe previously covered a WildPressure campaign against targets in the Middle East .\nKeeping track of the threat actor’s malware this spring, we were able to find a newer\nversion (1.6.1) of their C++ Trojan, a corresponding VBScript variant with the same\nversion and a completely new set of modules, including an orchestrator and three plugins.\nThis confirms our previous assumption that there are more last-stagers besides the C++\nones, based on one of the fields in the C2 communication protocol which contains the\n“client” programming language. Another language used by WildPressure is Python. The\nPyInstaller module for Windows contains a script named “Guard”. Perhaps the most\ninteresting finding here is that this malware was developed for both Windows and macOS\noperating systems. In this case, the hardcoded version is 2.2.1. The coding style, overall\ndesign and C2 communication protocol is quite recognisable across all programming\nlanguages used by the attackers. The malware used by WildPressure is still under active\ndevelopment in terms of versions and programming languages in use. Although we could\nnot associate WildPressure’s activity with other threat actors, we did find minor\nsimilarities in the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) used by BlackShadow,\nwhich is also active in the same region. However, we consider that these similarities serve\nas minor ties and are not enough to make any attribution.\n\nWe discovered an ongoing campaign that we attribute to an actor named WIRTE,\nbeginning in late 2019, targeting multiple sectors, focused on the Middle East. WIRTE is\na lesser-known threat actor first publicly referenced in 2019, which we suspect has\nrelations with the Gaza Cybergang threat actor group. During our hunting efforts, in\nFebruary, for threat actor groups that are using VBS/VBA implants, we came across MS\nExcel droppers that use hidden spreadsheets and VBA macros to drop their first stage\nimplant – a VBS script. The VBS script’s main function is to collect system information\nand execute arbitrary code sent by the attackers. Although we recently reported on a new\nMuddywater first stage VBS implant used for reconnaissance and profiling activities,\nthese intrusion sets have slightly different TTPs and wider targeting. To date, we have\n\n\n-----\n\nrecorded victims focused in the Middle East and a few other countries outside this region.\nDespite various industries being affected, the focus was mainly towards government and\ndiplomatic entities; however, we also noticed an unusual targeting of law firms.\n\nGoldenJackal is the name we have given to a cluster of activity, recently discovered in our\ntelemetry, that has been active since November 2019. This intrusion set consists of a set\nof .NET-based implants that are intended to control victim machines and exfiltrate\ncertain files from them, suggesting that the actor’s primary motivation is espionage.\nFurthermore, the implants were found in a restricted set of machines associated with\ndiplomatic entities in the Middle East. Analysis of the aforementioned malware, as well as\nthe accompanied detection logs, portray a capable and moderately stealthy actor. This can\nbe substantiated by the successful foothold gained by the underlying actor in the few\norganizations we came across, all the while keeping a low signature and ambiguous\nfootprint.\n\n## Southeast Asia and Korean Peninsula\n\nThe ScarCruft group is a geo-political motivated APT group that usually attacks\ngovernment entities, diplomats and individuals associated with North Korean affairs.\nFollowing our last report about this group, we had not seen its activities for almost a year.\nHowever, we observed that ScarCruft compromised a North Korea-related news media\nwebsite in January, beginning a campaign that was active until March. The attackers\nutilized the same exploit chains, CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2020-0986, also used in\n[Operation Powerfall. Based on the exploit code and infection scheme characteristics, we](https://securelist.com/operation-powerfall-cve-2020-0986-and-variants/98329/)\nsuspect that Operation PowerFall has a connection with the ScarCruft group. The exploit\nchain contains several stages of shellcode execution, finally deploying a Windows\nexecutable payload in memory. We discovered several victims from South Korea and\nSingapore. Besides this watering-hole attack, this group also used Windows executable\nmalware concealing its payload. This malware, dubbed “ATTACK-SYSTEM”, also used\nmulti-stage shellcode infection to deliver the same final payload named “BlueLight”.\nBlueLight uses OneDrive for C2. Historically, ScarCruft malware, especially RokRat, took\nadvantage of personal cloud servers as C2 servers, such as pCloud, Box, Dropbox, and\nYandex.\n\nIn May 2020, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Taiwan published an\nannouncement about an attack targeting Taiwanese legislators. Based on their\ninformation, an unknown attacker sent spear-phishing emails using a fake presidential\npalace email account, delivering malware we dubbed “Palwan”. Palwan is malware\ncapable of performing basic backdoor functionality as well as downloading further\nmodules with additional capabilities. Analysing the malware, we discovered another\ncampaign, active in parallel, targeting Nepal. We also found two more waves of attacks\nlaunched against Nepal in October 2020 and in January this year using Palwan malware\nvariants. We suspect that the targeted sector in Nepal is similar to the one reported by the\n\n\n-----\n\nCIB of Taiwan. Investigating the infrastructure used in the Nepal campaigns, we spotted\nan overlap with Dropping Elephant activity. However, we don’t deem this overlap\nsufficient to attribute this activity to the Dropping Elephant threat actor.\n\nBlueNoroff is a long-standing, financially motivated APT group that has been targeting\nthe financial industry for years. In recent operations, the group has focused on\ncryptocurrency businesses. Since the publication of our research of BlueNoroff’s\n“SnatchCrypto” campaign in 2020, the group’s strategy to deliver malware has evolved. In\nthis campaign, BlueNoroff used a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2017-0199, a\nremote template injection vulnerability. The injected template contains a Visual Basic\nscript, which is responsible for decoding the next payload from the initial Word document\nand injecting it into a legitimate process. The injected payload creates a persistent\nbackdoor on the victim’s machine. We observed several types of backdoor. For further\nsurveillance of the victim, the malware operator may also deploy additional tools.\nBlueNoroff has notably set up fake blockchain, or cryptocurrency-related, company\nwebsites for this campaign, to lure potential victims and initiate the infection process.\nNumerous decoy documents were used, which contain business and nondisclosure\nagreements as well as business introductions. When compared to the previous\nSnatchCrypto campaign, the BlueNoroff group utilized a similar backdoor and PowerShell\nagent but changed the initial infection vector. Windows shortcut files attached to spearphishing emails used to be the starting point for an infection: they have now been\nreplaced by weaponized Word documents.\n\n[We have discovered Andariel activity using a revised infection scheme and custom](https://securelist.com/andariel-evolves-to-target-south-korea-with-ransomware/102811/)\nransomware targeting a broad spectrum of industries located in South Korea. In April, we\nobserved a suspicious document containing a Korean file name and decoy uploaded to\nVirusTotal. It revealed a novel infection scheme and an unfamiliar payload. During the\ncourse of our research, Malwarebytes published a report with technical details about the\nsame series of attacks, which attributed it to the Lazarus group. After a deep analysis we\nreached a different conclusion – that the Andariel group was behind these attacks. Code\noverlaps between the second stage payload in this campaign and previous malware from\nthe Andariel group allowed for this attribution. Apart from the code similarity and the\nvictimology, we found additional connections with the Andariel group. Each threat actor\nhas a characteristic habit when they interactively work with a backdoor shell in the postexploitation phase. The way Windows commands and their options were used in this\ncampaign is almost identical to previous Andariel activity. The threat actor has been\nspreading the third stage payload since the middle of 2020 and leveraged malicious Word\ndocuments and files mimicking PDF documents as infection vectors. Notably, in addition\nto the final backdoor, we discovered one victim infected with custom ransomware. This\nransomware adds another facet to this Andariel campaign, which also sought financial\nprofit in a previous operation involving the compromise of ATMs.\n\nWe recently uncovered a large-scale and highly active attack in Southeast Asia coming\n[from a threat actor we dubbed LuminousMoth. Further analysis revealed that this](https://securelist.com/apt-luminousmoth/103332/)\nmalicious activity dates back to October 2020 and was still ongoing at the time we\n\n\n-----\n\nreported it in June. LuminousMoth takes advantage of DLL sideloading to download and\nexecute a Cobalt Strike payload. However, perhaps the most interesting part of this attack\nis its capability to spread to other hosts by infecting USB drives. In addition to the\nmalicious DLLs, the attackers also deployed a signed, but fake version of the popular\napplication Zoom on some infected systems, enabling them to exfiltrate files; and an\nadditional tool that accesses a victim’s Gmail session by stealing cookies from the Chrome\nbrowser. Infrastructure ties as well as shared TTPs allude to a possible connection\nbetween LuminousMoth and the HoneyMyte threat group, which was seen targeting the\nsame region and using similar tools in the past. Most early sightings of this activity were\nin Myanmar, but it now appears that the attackers are much more active in the\nPhilippines, where the number of known attacks has grown more than tenfold. This raises\nthe question of whether this is caused by a rapid replication through removable devices or\nby an unknown infection vector, such as a watering-hole focusing on the Philippines.\n\nWe recently reported SideCopy campaigns attacking the Windows platform together with\nAndroid-based implants. These implants turned out to be multiple applications working\nas information stealers to collect sensitive information from victims’ devices, such as\ncontact lists, SMS messages, call recordings, media and other types of data. Following up,\nwe discovered additional malicious Android applications, some of them purporting to be\nknown messaging apps like Signal or an adult chat platform. These newly discovered\napplications use the Firebase messaging service as a channel to receive commands. The\noperator is able to control if either Dropbox or another, hard coded server is used to\nexfiltrate stolen files.\n\n## Other interesting discoveries\n\nExpanding our research on the exploit targeting CVE-2021-1732, originally discovered by\nDBAPPSecurity Threat Intelligence Center and used by the Bitter APT group, we\ndiscovered another possible zero-day exploit used in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.\nInterestingly, the exploit was found in the wild as part of a separate framework, alongside\nCVE-2021-1732 as well as other previously patched exploits. We are highly confident that\nthis framework is entirely unrelated to Bitter APT and was used by a different threat\nactor. Further analysis revealed that this Escalation of Privilege (EoP) exploit has\npotentially been used in the wild since at least November 2020. Upon discovery, we\nreported this new exploit to Microsoft in February. After confirmation that we were\nindeed dealing with a new zero-day, it received the designation CVE-2021-28310.\n\nVarious marks and artifacts left in the exploit mean that we are also highly confident that\nCVE-2021-1732 and CVE-2021-28310 were created by the same exploit developer that we\ntrack as “Moses”. “Moses” appears to be an exploit developer who makes exploits\navailable to several threat actors, based on other past exploits and the actors observed\nusing them. To date, we have confirmed that at least two known threat actors have\nutilized exploits originally developed by Moses: Bitter APT and Dark Hotel. Based on\nsimilar marks and artifacts, as well as privately obtained information from third parties,\nwe believe at least six vulnerabilities observed in the wild in the last two years have\n\n\n-----\n\noriginated from “Moses”. While the EoP exploit was discovered in the wild, we are\ncurrently unable to directly tie its usage to any known threat actor that we are currently\ntracking. The EoP exploit was probably chained together with other browser exploits to\nescape sandboxes and obtain system level privileges for further access. Unfortunately, we\nweren’t able to capture a full exploit chain, so we don’t know if the exploit is used with\nanother browser zero-day, or coupled with exploits taking advantage of known, patched\nvulnerabilities.\n\nIn another, more recent investigation into the surge of attacks by APT actors against\nExchange servers following the revelation of ProxyLogon and other Exchange\nvulnerabilities, we took note of one unique cluster of activity. It attracted our attention\nbecause the actor behind it seemed to have been active in compromising Exchange\nservers since at least December 2020, all the while using a toolset that we were not able to\nassociate with any known threat group. During March, several waves of attacks on\nExchange servers were made public, partially describing the same cluster of activity that\nwe had observed. One of them, reported by ESET, contained an assessment that the actor\nbehind this activity had access to the Exchange exploits prior to their public release,\nwhich aligns with our observations of the early activity of it last year. That said, none of\nthe public accounts described sightings of the full infection chain and later stages of\nmalware deployed as part of this group’s operation. Adopting the name Websiic, given\npublicly to this cluster of activity by ESET, we reported the TTPs of the underlying threat\nactor. Namely, we focused on the usage of both commodity tools like the China Chopper\nwebshell and a proprietary .NET backdoor used by the group, which we dubbed\n“Samurai”, as well as describing a broader set of targets than the one documented thus\nfar.\n\nOn 15 April, Codecov publicly disclosed that its Bash Uploader script had been\ncompromised and was distributed to users between the 31 January and the 1 April. The\nBash Uploader script is publicly distributed by Codecov and aims to gather information\non the user’s execution environments, collect code coverage reports, and send them to the\nCodecov infrastructure. As a result, this script compromise effectively constitutes a\nsupply-chain attack. The Bash uploader script is typically executed as a trusted resource\nin development and testing environments (including as part of automated build\nprocesses, such as continuous integration or development pipelines); and its compromise\ncould enable malicious access to infrastructure or account secrets, as well as code\nrepositories and source code. While we haven’t been able to confirm the malicious script\ndeployment, retrieve any information on the compromise goals, or identify further\nassociated malicious tools yet, we were able to collect one sample of a compromised Bash\nuploader script, as well as identify some possibly associated additional malicious servers.\n\nAn e-mail sent by Click Studios to its customers on 22 April informed them that a\nsophisticated threat actor had gained access to the Passwordstate automatic updating\nfunctionality, referred to as the in-place upgrade. Passwordstate is a password\nmanagement tool for enterprises, and on 20 April, for a period of about 28 hours, a\nmalicious DLL was included in the software updates. On 24 April, an incident\n\n\n-----\n\nmanagement advisory was also released. The purpose of the campaign was to steal\npasswords stored in the password manager. Although this attack was only active for a\nshort time, we managed to obtain the malicious DLLs and reported our initial findings.\nNevertheless, it’s still unclear how the attackers gained access to the Passwordstate\nsoftware to begin with. Following a new advisory published by Click Studio on 28 April,\nwe discovered a new variant of the malicious DLL used to backdoor the Passwordstate\npassword manager. This DLL variant was distributed in a phishing campaign, most likely\nby the same actor.\n\nA few days after April’s Patch Tuesday updates from Microsoft (13 April), a number of\nsuspicious files caught our attention. These files were binaries, disguised as “April 2021\nSecurity Update Installers”. They were signed with a valid digital signature, delivering\nCobalt Strike beacon modules. It is likely that the modules were signed with a stolen\ndigital certificate. These Cobalt Strike beacon implants were configured with a hardcoded\nC2, “code.microsoft.com”. Contrary to a (now redacted) publication from the Qihoo 360\nteam revolving around this activity, we can confirm that there was no compromise of\nMicrosoft’s infrastructure. In fact, an unauthorized party took over the dangling\nsubdomain “code.microsoft.com” and configured it to resolve to their Cobalt Strike host,\nsetup around 15 April. That domain hosted a Cobalt Strike beacon payload served to\nHTTP clients using a specific and unique user agent. According to Microsoft and the\ninitial Qihoo notification, the impact in this case was very limited and didn’t affect\nunsuspecting visitors to this website because of the required unique user agent.\n\nOn April 14-15, Kaspersky technologies detected a wave of highly targeted attacks against\nmultiple companies. Closer analysis revealed that all these attacks exploited a chain of\nGoogle Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day exploits. While we were not able to\nretrieve the exploit used for Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the Chrome web-browser,\nwe were able to find and analyze an Escalation of Privilege (EoP) exploit used to escape\nthe sandbox and obtain system privileges. The EoP exploit was fine-tuned to work against\nthe latest and the most prominent builds of Windows 10 (17763 – RS5, 18362 – 19H1,\n18363 – 19H2, 19041 – 20H1, 19042 – 20H2) and it exploits two distinct vulnerabilities\nin the Microsoft Windows OS kernel. On April 20, we reported these vulnerabilities to\nMicrosoft and they assigned CVE-2021-31955 to the Information Disclosure vulnerability\nand CVE-2021-31956 to the EoP vulnerability. Both vulnerabilities were patched on June\n8, as a part of the June Patch Tuesday. The exploit-chain attempts to install malware in\nthe system through a dropper. The malware starts as a system service and loads the\npayload, a “remote shell”-style backdoor which in turns connects to the C2 to get\ncommands. So far, we haven’t been able to find any connections or overlaps with a known\n[actor. Therefore, we are tentatively calling this cluster of activity PuzzleMaker.](https://securelist.com/puzzlemaker-chrome-zero-day-exploit-chain/102771/)\n\nOn April 16, we began hearing rumors about active exploitation of Pulse Secure devices\nfrom other researchers in the community. One day prior to this, the NSA, CISA, and FBI\nhad jointly published an advisory stating that APT29 was conducting widespread\nscanning and exploitation of vulnerable systems, including Pulse Secure. For this reason,\ninitial thoughts were that the two were related; and these were just rumors circulating the\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunity about old activity that was being brought to light again. Following this, we\nwere able to at least confirm that the initial rumors were part of a separate set of activities\nthat had occurred between January and March and were not directly related to the\nadvisory mentioned above. This new activity involved the exploitation of at least two\nvulnerabilities in Pulse Secure; one previously patched and one zero-day (CVE-202122893). We also became aware of affected organizations that were notified by a third\nparty that they were potentially compromised by this activity. After exploitation, the\nthreat actor proceeded to deploy a simple webshell to maintain persistence. On May 3,\nPulse Secure delivered “out-of-cycle” update and workaround packages to provide a\nsolution for the multiple vulnerabilities.\n\nCooperating with Check Point Research, we discovered an ongoing attack targeting a\nsmall group of individuals in Xinjiang and Pakistan, in regions mostly populated by the\nUyghur minority. The attackers used malicious executables that collect information about\nthe infected system and attempt to download a second-stage payload. The actor put\nconsiderable effort into disguising the payloads, whether by creating delivery documents\nthat appear to be originating from the United Nations using up-to-date related themes, or\nby setting up websites for non-existing organizations claiming to fund charity groups. In\nour report, we examined the flow of both infection vectors and provided our analysis of\nthe malicious artifacts we came across during this investigation, even though we were\nunable to obtain the later stages of the infection chain.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nWhile the TTPs of some threat actors remain consistent over time, relying heavily on\nsocial engineering as a means of gaining a foothold in a target organisation or\ncompromising an individual’s device, others refresh their toolsets and extend the scope of\ntheir activities. Our regular quarterly reviews are intended to highlight the key\ndevelopments of APT groups.\n\nHere are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q2 2021:\n\nWe have reported several supply-chain attacks in recent months.. While some were\nmajor and have attracted worldwide attention, we observed equally successful lowtech attacks, such as BountyGlad, CoughingDown and the attack targeting Codecov.\nAPT groups mainly use social engineering to gain an initial foothold in a target\nnetwork. However, we’ve seen a rise in APT threat actors leveraging exploits to gain\nthat initial foothold – including the zero-days developed by the exploit developer we\ncall “Moses” and those used in the PuzzleMaker, Pulse Secure attacks and the\nExchange server vulnerabilities.\nAPT threat actors typically refresh and update their toolsets: this includes not only\nthe inclusion of new platforms but also the use of additional languages as seen by\nWildPressure’s macOS-supported Python malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs illustrated by the campaigns of various threat actors – including BountyGlad,\nHotCousin, GoldenJackal, Scarcruft, Palwan, Pulse Secure and the threat actor\nbehind the WebDav-O/Mail-O implants – geo-politics continues to drive APT\ndevelopments.\n\nAs always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat\nlandscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually\nimprove, there is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our\nradar.\n\nAPT trends report Q2 2021\n\nYour email address will not be published.
