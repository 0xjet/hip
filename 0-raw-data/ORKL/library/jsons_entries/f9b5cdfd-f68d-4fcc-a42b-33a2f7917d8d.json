According to current and former U.S.\nintelligence officials the operation was used to target ISIS and al-Qaeda members\n\n\n-----\n\n[On March 9, Kaspersky publicly announced a malware campaign dubbed Slingshot.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/kaspersky-slingshot-malware-apt/)\nAccording to the company’s researchers, the campaign compromised thousands of devices\nthrough breached routers in various African and Middle Eastern countries, including\nAfghanistan, Iraq, Kenya, Sudan, Somalia, Turkey and Yemen.\n\nKaspersky did not attribute Slingshot to any single country or government in its public report,\ndescribing it only as an advanced persistent threat (APT). But current and former U.S.\nintelligence officials tell CyberScoop that Slingshot represents a U.S. military program run out\nof Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), a component of Special Operations\nCommand (SOCOM).\n\nThe complex campaign, which researchers say was active for at least six years, allowed for\nthe spread of highly intrusive malware that could siphon large amounts of data from infected\ndevices.\n\nSlingshot helped the military and intelligence community collect information about terrorists\nby infecting computers they commonly used, sources told CyberScoop. Often times, these\ntargeted computers would be located within internet cafés in developing countries. ISIS and\nal-Qaeda targets would use internet cafés to send and receive messages, the sources said.\n\nThese officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a classified program,\nfear the exposure may cause the U.S. to lose access to a valuable, long-running surveillance\nprogram and put soldiers’ lives at risk.\n\nThe disclosure comes at a difficult time for Kaspersky. The company is currently fighting the\nU.S. government in court after the government claimed that the Moscow-based company’s\nsoftware poses a national security risk due to the company’s Russian government ties.\nKaspersky has consistently denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCyberScoop’s reporting of JSOC’s role in Slingshot provides the first known case of a\nSOCOM-led cyber-espionage operation. The command is better known for leading physical\nmissions that place elite soldiers on the ground in hostile territories. Over the last decade,\nSOCOM has been instrumental in the Global War on Terror, having conducted many\nsensitive missions, including the one that killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nSlingshot, CyberScoop has learned, is a complement to JSOC’s physical missions.\n\nA former intelligence official told CyberScoop that Kaspersky’s findings had likely already\ncaused the U.S. to abandon and “burn” some of the digital infrastructure that JSOC was\nusing to manage the surveillance program.\n\n“SOP [standard operating procedure] is to kill it all with fire once you get caught,” said the\nformer intelligence official. “It happens sometimes and we’re accustomed to dealing with it.\nBut it still sucks … I can tell you this didn’t help anyone.”\n\n\n-----\n\n### SOCOM has hackers?\n\nWhile not an intelligence agency by nature, SOCOM has dabbled in cyber-operations —\n[known inside the unit as “special reconnaissance” — for some time, according to multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_reconnaissance)\nacademics who have examined the use of offensive cyber tools within special operations\nunits. Most of these operations would usually combine elements of human (HUMINT) and\nsignals intelligence (SIGINT) in order to catch terrorists.\n\nAs the Global War on Terror grew, most combatant commands took visible steps and\nreceived considerable funding to build out their own espionage capabilities. One of the\nmilitary organizations which benefited most from this explosive growth in resources was\nSOCOM, a unit that many describe as the “tip of the spear” when it comes to military\noperations.\n\n“Many units within SOCOM possess independent cyber capabilities,” a senior U.S.\nintelligence official told CyberScoop.\n\nThroughout the past decade, SOCOM has used cyber operations in a very ad hoc manner. If\ncyberwarfare was used in an operation, SOCOM has either been given support from U.S.\nCyber Command or reliant on smaller squadrons within various units.\n\nFor instance, a group of hackers organized under the name “Computer Network Operations\nSquadron” (CNOS), were known to operate within JSOC command circa 2007. Though\nheadquartered in Northern Virginia, CNOS helped coordinate missions where on-the-ground\nagents in the Middle East — and sometimes undercover operatives — would infiltrate\ninternet cafés and local telecommunications firms. The squadron was first written about in\n[“Relentless Strike: The Secret History of Joint Special Operations Command,” a book by](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TDTR5ZW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)\njournalist Sean Naylor.\n\nNaylor wrote that CNOS staff could be stationed around the world, including at Fort Meade in\nMaryland and CIA’s Langley, Virginia, headquarters. CNOS had close connections to\nCIA, blurring the already fuzzy line between U.S. intel and military organizations.\n\nIn one case mentioned by Naylor’s book, CNOS infected a terrorist’s computer with\n“keystroke recognition [software], at other times it would covertly activate a webcam if the\ncomputer had one, allowing the task force to positively identify a target.”\n\nThe Slingshot program found by Kaspersky had similar capabilities.\n\nSOCOM’s exclusive structure provides an easy way to leverage long-standing intelligence\nprograms, since it is permitted to quickly organize and deploy forces globally wherever\ndefined rules of engagement exist. Teams like CNOS, as described by Naylor, are usually\nable to work closely with intelligence agencies in foreign, undefined war-zones after receiving\napproval from the appropriate regional combatant commands and Pentagon.\n\n\n-----\n\nJSOC and CIA have a history of working together and when combined, meet a similar profile\nto how Slingshot would be utilized.\n\n“The military kept CNOS in JSOC ‘because we want it to operate in areas that are not\nnecessarily … where we’re currently at war’ … we want it to operate around the globe\n\n[pursuing] national objectives,” a passage in Naylor’s book, citing an unnamed military\nintelligence officer, reads. “[CNOS] was how the pesky networks were broken in Iraq.”\n\n### Slingshot’s ties to spies\n\nOne Kaspersky researcher involved with the Slingshot report said the malware campaign\nillustrated one of the most skilled and sophisticated hacking operations ever to be publicly\ndocumented. Its creators took numerous steps to hide their identity and purpose, making\nSlingshot extremely difficult to study, explained Kurt Baumgartner, a principal security\nresearcher with Kaspersky.\n\nBaumgartner, a U.S. citizen, did not author the Slingshot report. Instead, a team of four\nresearchers based overseas, largely in Russia, are credited with writing it.\n\n“It is one of the most technically sophisticated groups we’ve ever seen,” said Baumgartner.\n“Most of the code is entirely unique, meaning that no one has ever seen it before … the only\noverlap we’ve seen, and I think there are people already discussing it, is there’s some limited\nsimilarities maybe to Equation Grayfish and White Lambert.”\n\n“Grayfish” is a software implant associated with the “Equation Group,” an entity that is widely\nattributed to the National Security Agency. The “Lamberts,” another group identified and first\ncatalogued by Kaspersky, has been separately linked to the CIA.\n\nHacking tools tied to past Equation Group and Lambert-inspired operations were written in\nEnglish, just like Slingshot. Akin to Grayfish and Lamberts, Slingshot used a distinct software\ndriver abuse technique to install malicious code onto targeted systems. They are the only\nthree documented APTs to use this exact same driver abuse method.\n\nBroadly speaking, Kaspersky’s ability to identify even the most advanced malware variants is\nwell-documented; especially within the highly competitive cybersecurity community. Most of\nthese cases are handled by Kaspersky’s heralded Global Research & Analysis Team\n(GReAT) team. The Russian company is known for employing some of the best reverse\nmalware engineers and analysts in the entire industry.\n\nIt also has a vast business presence in the Middle East. Slingshot was discovered through\nthe company’s work in that region.\n\nA source close to Kaspersky Lab told CyberScoop that while some researchers may have\nthought Slingshot was the work of a “Five Eyes” nation — a term used to describe an\nintelligence alliance between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the\n\n\n-----\n\nU.S. — they couldn t have known for sure. This source told CyberScoop that the Kaspersky\nresearchers lacked context because there’s “only so much that can be gleaned from\ntechnical evidence.”\n\nQuestions sent to the Russian company regarding if they knew about Slingshot’s U.S.\nmilitary origin went unanswered.\n\nEven so, a cursory review provides some tips that Slingshot be linked to U.S. spies.\n\nThe malware is comprised of individual modules, each carrying a different title, like “Gollum,”\n“Cahnadr” or “NeedleWatch,” according to Kaspersky. A leaked NSA memo released in\n2015 describes Gollum as a “partner implant” used by another agency aside from NSA. The\nmemo, circulated between Five Eyes nations, talks about the need to create an accessible\ndata pipeline that pulls information from infected computers where an active implant is\nhidden.\n\nIn addition to “Gollum,” the way Slingshot exploits routers made by Latvian company Mikrotik\ncould perhaps be traced back to another spy agency: the CIA. Classified documents\npublished by WikiLeaks as part of the so-called “Vault 7” dump show that the CIA has been\n[interested in compromising Mikrotik equipment since at least 2015. Mikrotik products are](https://wikileaks.org/vault7/darkmatter/document/hive-UsersGuide/)\npopular in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\n\nSpokespeople for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, NSA and Special\nOperations Command (SOCOM) all declined to comment.\n\n### Adding fuel to the fire\n\nCyberScoop spoke with several U.S. cybersecurity researchers who said they weren’t\nsurprised or angered by the fact that Kaspersky had potentially publicized a U.S. cyberespionage operation.\n\nThese experts, who asked for anonymity because they feared blowback for speaking\npublicly, said that it’s only natural for Kaspersky to attempt to stop cyberattacks aimed at its\nclients. Others who spoke to CyberScoop, however, including current U.S. officials, said they\nwere angry because publicly disclosing Slingshot may put lives in danger.\n\nComplicating the matter is the lawsuit Kaspersky has filed against the U.S. government. The\n2018 National Defense Authorization Act banned the use of Kaspersky products across the\n[federal government. Kaspersky charges that ban is unconstitutional.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/kaspersky-lawsuit-ndaa-ban/)\n\nThe ban comes after numerous reports that the company’s anti-virus engine was leveraged\nby Russian spies to remotely pilfer secret U.S. documents on systems where the software\nwas installed. In response, Kaspersky launched a transparency effort in October 2017, which\nit says proves its products are not malicious.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the moment, it s not clear if the Russian company expected that its focus on Slingshot\nwould eventually expose a sensitive U.S. counterterrorism initiative.\n\nA senior U.S. intelligence official claimed that it would be hard to believe that Kaspersky was\ntotally unaware of what it was handling.\n\n“It’s clear by the way they wrote about this that they knew what it was being used for,” said\nthe senior official. “GReAT is extremely adept at understanding the information needs of\ndifferent actors out there on the internet. They take into considering the geopolitical\ncircumstances, they’ve shown that time and time again. It would be a stretch for me to\nbelieve they didn’t know what they’re dealing with here.”\n\n_Greg Otto contributed to this report._\n\n\n-----",
