Because it uses these common sites that are visited by millions, the notion is\nthat its network traffic patterns are normally hard to detect since the traffic looks like ordinary\nend user queries of these services.\n\n## Opportunities for Malicious Acts\n\n[But hidden in these interactions are the directions for the malware to first download an image](https://securityintelligence.com/diagnosing-the-details-of-a-malware-infection/)\nfrom Github, extract encrypted instructions and then finally upload a victimized PC’s data to\nits servers. While each of these techniques isn’t new, the combination shows that someone\nwith a great deal of skill has taken the time to craft the code. For example, Hammertoss is\nable to:\n\nRetrieve legitimate commands from social media networks — again, looking like a\nnormal user’s interactions;\nUse compromised Web servers for command-and-control purposes;\nUpdate its code frequently to change its behavior and backdoor infection patterns;\nAutomatically visit different Twitter handles daily on a scheduled basis; and\nUse a schedule to do all of these communications during the local workday so as not to\nappear suspicious.\n\n## How Hammertoss Works\n\n[Fusion explained how Hammertoss operates with Twitter, Github and other images.](https://fusion.net/story/174703/russian-hacker-squad-apt-29-is-using-twitter-to-steal-valuable-data/)\n\n“Each Hammertoss-created tweet is custom-tailored with a unique hashtag and a URL that\nlinks to a seemingly innocuous image,” Charles Pulliam-Moore wrote on the site. “In reality,\nthe image itself contains a small bit of encrypted data. The hashtag tells a computer where to\nlook for the image and includes a matching bit of encrypted data that, when combined with\nthe image, unleashes a new set of malware commands that can extract data from a\ncompromised computer.”\n\n[One security researcher has tracked the origins of Hammertoss to the APT29 group, which](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2186063-apt29-hammertoss-stealthy-tactics-define-a.html)\nallegedly has nation-state ties. The group operates during the appropriate time zones and\nlocal Russian holidays, supporting this hypothesis.\n\n## What Should IT Teams Do?\n\nWhat can IT departments do about Hammertoss, given this profile? First, they should employ\n[a security product that can examine network traffic that it produces and look for unexpected](https://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/network-ips)\n[behavior. While Hammertoss connects to random Twitter and Github accounts, it is using the](https://securityintelligence.com/twitter-malware-spreading-more-than-just-ideas/)\ninformation gleaned from these accounts in an automated and programmatic fashion.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecond, part of this analysis is also examining more carefully what kinds of data are leaving\nyour network; if you don’t have any way to do this, now is the time to start looking at\nprotective tools that will allow for this kind of monitoring. Third, you should look at security\nproducts that examine file integrity and movement specifically. Finally, you should probably\n[subscribe to several security news and intelligence feeds to keep up to date on the news](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/)\nabout Hammertoss and other similar advanced threats.\n\n[Advanced Threats |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/advanced-threats/) [Malware |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/malware/) [Network Security |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/network-security/) [Security Intelligence](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/security-intelligence/)\n[David Strom](https://securityintelligence.com/author/david-strom/)\nSecurity Evangelist\n\nDavid is an award-winning writer, speaker, editor, video blogger, and online communications\nprofessional who also advises numerous startup and well-establish...\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
