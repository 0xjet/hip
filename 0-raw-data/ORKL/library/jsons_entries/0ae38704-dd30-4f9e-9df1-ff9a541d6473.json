The Duqu threat actor went dark in 2012 and was believed to have\nstopped working on this project – until now. Our technical analysis indicates the new round of\nattacks include an updated version of the infamous 2011 Duqu malware, sometimes referred\nto as the stepbrother of Stuxnet. We named this new malware and its associated platform\n“Duqu 2.0”.\n\n[Some of the new 2014-2015 Duqu infections are linked to the P5+1 events and venues](https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/foreign-policy/iran-negotiations)\nrelated to the negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal. The threat actor behind Duqu\nappears to have launched attacks at the venues for some of these high level talks. In\naddition to the P5+1 events, the Duqu 2.0 group has launched a similar attack in relation to\nthe 70th anniversary event of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the case of Kaspersky Lab, the attack took advantage of a zero-day in the Windows\nKernel, and possibly up to two other, currently patched vulnerabilities, which were zero-day\nat that time. The analysis of the attack revealed that the main goal of the attackers was to\nspy on Kaspersky Lab technologies, ongoing research and internal processes. No\ninterference with processes or systems was detected. More details can be found in our\n[technical paper.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07205202/The_Mystery_of_Duqu_2_0_a_sophisticated_cyberespionage_actor_returns.pdf)\n\nFrom a threat actor point of view, the decision to target a world-class security company must\nbe quite difficult. On one hand, it almost surely means the attack will be exposed – it’s very\nunlikely that the attack will go unnoticed. So the targeting of security companies indicates\nthat either they are very confident they won’t get caught, or perhaps they don’t care much if\nthey are discovered and exposed. By targeting Kaspersky Lab, the Duqu attackers probably\ntook a huge bet hoping they’d remain undiscovered; and lost.\n\nAt Kaspersky Lab, we strongly believe in transparency, which is why we are going public with\nthis information. Kaspersky Lab is confident that its clients and partners are safe and that\nthere is no impact on the company’s products, technologies and services.\n\n## Duqu 2.0 – Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n### MD5s\n\n**Action loaders:**\n\n089a14f69a31ea5e9a5b375dc0c46e45\n\n16ed790940a701c813e0943b5a27c6c1\n\n26c48a03a5f3218b4a10f2d3d9420b97\n\na6dcae1c11c0d4dd146937368050f655\n\nacbf2d1f8a419528814b2efa9284ea8b\n\nc04724afdb6063b640499b52623f09b5\n\ne8eaec1f021a564b82b824af1dbe6c4d\n\n10e16e36fe459f6f2899a8cea1303f06\n\n48fb0166c5e2248b665f480deac9f5e1\n\n520cd9ee4395ee85ccbe073a00649602\n\n7699d7e0c7d6b2822992ad485caacb3e\n\n84c2e7ff26e6dd500ec007d6d5d2255e\n\n856752482c29bd93a5c2b62ff50df2f0\n\n85f5feeed15b75cacb63f9935331cf4e\n\n8783ac3cc0168ebaef9c448fbe7e937f\n\n966953034b7d7501906d8b4cd3f90f6b\n\na14a6fb62d7efc114b99138a80b6dc7d\n\na6b2ac3ee683be6fbbbab0fa12d88f73\n\ncc68fcc0a4fab798763632f9515b3f92\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cores:**\n\n3f52ea949f2bd98f1e6ee4ea1320e80d\nc7c647a14cb1b8bc141b089775130834\n\n### C&C IPs\n\n182.253.220.29\n\n186.226.56.103\n\nTo check your network for Duqu’s 2.0 presence, you can also use the open IOC file available\n[here.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07205210/7c6ce6b6-fee1-4b7b-b5b5-adaff0d8022f.ioc)\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Duqu](https://securelist.com/tag/duqu/)\n[Malware](https://securelist.com/tag/malware/)\n[Nation State Sponsored Espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/nation-state-sponsored-espionage/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nThe Mystery of Duqu 2.0: a sophisticated cyberespionage actor returns\n\nYour email address will not be published.
