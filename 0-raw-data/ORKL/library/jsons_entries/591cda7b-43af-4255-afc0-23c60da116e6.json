These agencies usually carry out cyber attacks to seek a competitive edge, gain access to intellectual property, or for sheer sabotage. In other words, cyber threats have never been more pervasive and attack damages never more real.\n\n The situation is especially grim for the Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) industry. The sector is plagued by two key problems. For one, top management has traditionally not placed sufficient emphasis on information security. Also, much more focus is placed on connectivity compared to security. As a result, the ENR sector has become an enticing and relatively easy target for cyber attacks.\n\n As evidenced in recent cyber incidents “Shamoon[1]” and “Night Dragon[2]”, the resultant loss and combined damage, be it substantial or intellectual, would be far greater than the cost of preventive security measures.\n\n In this increasingly insecure environment, senior management should refresh their perspective to safeguard their key corporate assets.\n\n For many organisations in the Asia Pacific, a cyber security-oriented structural transformation might be necessary.\n\n##### “I am convinced that there are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that will be. And even they are converging into one category: companies that have been hacked and will be hacked again.”\n\nRobert S. Mueller, FBI Director\nRSA Cyber Security Conference\nMarch 2012\n\n\n1 Shamoon, also known as Disttrack, is a modular computer virus discovered in 2012 that attacks computers running the\nMicrosoft Windows \"NT\" line of operating systems. The virus is being used for cyber espionage in the energy sector. Its\ndiscovery was announced on 16 August 2012 by Symantec, Kaspersky Lab, and Seculert.\n\n2 Operation Night Dragon was a Cyber Attack against energy companies which was exposed by the security company\nMcAfee. Night Dragon attacks are designed to steal sensitive data from targeted organisations. Unlike opportunistic\nattacks, the perpetrators appear to be sophisticated, highly organised, and motivated in their pursuits.\n\n\n-----\n\n# CONTENTS\n\n###### What Is Going On\n\n The Current Global Situation............................................................................1\n\n ENR Related Security Incidents.......................................................................3\n\n – General\n\n – Shamoon\n\n – Night Dragon\n\n – Others\n\n Overview of Major Problems...........................................................................4\n\n The Who & Why of Cyber Attacks...............................................................5\n\n Industrial Control System................................................................................7\n\n Categorised Active Players..............................................................................7\n\n Various Attack Vectors.....................................................................................8\n\n Impact on companies who fall prey to such attacks.......................................9\n\n How Companies Can Cope\n\n The need for action........................................................................................ 10\n\n So are companies in the ENR industry up to the challenge?......................... 11\n\n Suggested Frameworks.................................................................................12\n\n – ICS-CERT Recommendation\n\n Real life case studies.....................................................................................13\n\n Conclusion....................................................................................................16\n\n References\n\n Internal........................................................................................................... 17\n\n External..........................................................................................................18\n\n\n-----\n\n## What is going on\n\n\n#### The Current Global Situation\n\nCyber threats and IT risks are omnipresent.\nCompared to the past when criminals\nused a scattergun approach, cyber\nattacks now are much more focused and\nintelligent. Let us first take a peek into an\nattacker’s world.\n\n\n###### An attacker’s perspective\n\n Understanding the perspective of an attacker is essential for everyone involved in fighting cybercrime. For that reason, staff in KPMG Netherlands interviewed one of their professionals – an ‘ethical hacker’. He relayed us an intriguing fictitious story. It is up to you to judge how realistic this threat would be to your organisation.\n\n“My employer insists on remaining\nanonymous, but rest assured, he is\nquite resourceful. He approached me\na few weeks ago with a job offer. The\ngoal he set was quite ambitious: steal\nas many secrets from the government\nas you can. Let me tell you about the\nsteps I took.\n\nFirst, I sat down to think about what\nI knew about the government’s IT\ninfrastructure. At a conference last fall,\nI had met an IT director of a ministry\nwho had told me that all firewalls for\nthe government were supplied by the\nsame vendor, company Y. Hacking such\na firewall was a formidable task - not\nsomething I was ready to take on directly.\nInstead, I took a more indirect approach.\n\nI logged in to LinkedIn and\nsearched for employees of software\ndevelopment companies who\nmentioned company Y as one of their\nclients on their LinkedIn profile. Many\nprofessionals mention prestigious\nclient names in their profile, even\nwhen company policy prohibits name\ndropping. Shortly after, I found multiple\nsoftware vendors which make niche\nsoftware and listed company Y as a\nclient. I visited the vendors’ websites\n\n\nand scanned their externally reachable\nIP addresses until I found one which had\nan unpatched vulnerability in their web\nserver: company X. After a day’s work,\nI was inside their network.\n\nCompany X is a small organisation and\nthey do not feel they need network\nsegmentation, so I was able to reach\nall machines on their internal network\nthrough that web server. After some\nmore work, I was able to elevate my\nprivileges to domain administrator, which\nmeant I had full access to all of their\nsystems.\n\nThis was where I hit a bump. I intended\nto change the source code of their\nproduct in such a way that it would allow\nme to connect remotely to the system of\nanyone who installed it, but I had never\ndone that before. I then decided to log on\nto a hacker forum and posted a request\nfor help. I offered 10,000 euros reward\nfor a job well done. After a while, I was\napproached by someone who was willing\nto help me. I asked around to confirm his\nreputation in this field. I enlisted his help\nin modifying the source code of the main\nproduct of company X.\n\nThe security policies of company Y were\nvery strict: only the system administrators\ncan install software on the workstations,\nand both incoming and outgoing traffic\ngoes through a proxy server. Luckily, the\nvirus which my associate hacker had\nwritten communicates through DNS,\nwhich was not actively monitored or\nfiltered. The software from company\nX was updated on a regular basis, and\nafter three weeks I received a message\nwhich indicated that I had access to their\nworkstations.\n\n\nI called on my associate hacker\nonce more, but this time for a more\nadvanced task: reprogramming the\nfirmware of the firewalls which\ncompany Y produces. He indicated\nthat he needed the help of a contact\nwho installed a backdoor in all firewalls\nfor another 20,000 euros. Now, all I\nneeded to do was wait for the next\nupdate of the firmware. I posted\nsome fake security vulnerabilities for\nthe current version of this firmware,\nto ensure that the firmware would\nbe upgraded timely. And slowly but\nsurely, I gained access to all internal\nnetworks of the government.\n\nI could then route any traffic which\nflows through any government\nnetwork through my own computer.\nI can also read all emails which are\nsent between government employees\ninternally. I can find vulnerable servers\nby scanning the networks. In almost\nall the internal networks, I have found\nat least one server which I can exploit.\nI installed backdoors on hundreds of\nworkstations which allows me the\nability to monitor email servers, so\nemails with interesting attachments\ncan be forwarded to me. Additionally,\nI have obtained login credentials\nfor almost all major government\ndatabases.\n\nEvery day, almost two hundred\ngigabytes of government secrets\nare sent to me automatically. This\namount is only limited by the amount\nof bandwidth I can get, and the\nnumber of hard disk drives I install.\nI’m being paid 100 euros per gigabyte\nof information. I will leave it to you to\ncalculate my hourly wage.”\n\n\n© 2012\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sad truth is that cybercrime is here\nto stay. A report by the Government\nAccountability Office indicated that 24\nkey government agencies in the United\nStates have logged a 650 percent\nincrease in cyber security incidents in\n2011 compared to five years ago.\n\nAccording to a survey by KPMG\nNetherlands, 49 percent of organisations\nhave experienced some form of\ncybercrime activity during the past 12\nmonths while the remaining may not even\nhave proper detection measures in place.\n\nAmong the 49 percent, 10 percent\nindicated that they have been attacked\nmore than 100 times within the past\nyear. The remaining respondents said\nthey were attacked successfully up to\nfive times last year. Most of the incidents\nwere not covered by the media and are\ntherefore not publicly known.\n\n###### Information leakage most common\nGlobally, information leakage is one of\nthe most common challenges faced by\norganisations.\n\nOpening an email containing a virus from\na hacker can allow perpetrators to seize\ncontrol of your computer, read your emails\nand record your passwords. Information\nleakage is in fact one of the most common\ntypes of incidents across the world and\ncan easily take place in your daily life.\n\n###### Figure 1: Heat map of information leaking countries\n\nVery hot     Hot     Warm\n\nSource: KPMG Cyber Vulnerability Index 2012\n\n\nTake for example that you have made a\ndonation to a local charity. In recognition\nof your contribution, the organisation\nlists your name on their website as a\nsponsor. Two days later, you receive\nan email from the Fundraising Chair\nasking you to confirm your donation.\nYou open the email, fill out the form\n(you are also careful not to include any\nbanking or sensitive information) and\nreturn it to the sender. But in reality, the\nemail didn’t come from the charity at\nall; the attachment was, in fact, a high\nquality fake containing a virus, allowing\nperpetrators to seize control of your\ncomputer, read your emails and record\nyour passwords. Everything you know or\nsee is now visible to the perpetuators.\nClearly, information leakage is rapidly\nbecoming a board-level risk.\n\nA 2012 survey by KPMG suggest\nthat more than three-quarters of the\nForbes 2000 companies leak potentially\ndangerous data (See Figure 1 below).\n\nPersonal information and financial\ndata are often lost due to hacking,\nsystem failure, human negligence and\ndisgruntled employees. Some countries\nhave already enacted legislation to\ncurb such problems. The European\nCommission’s General Data Protection\nRegulation released in 2012 states that\ncompanies have the obligation to protect\ntheir network and personal information.\n\n\nCompanies must also notify relevant\nauthorities within 24 hours after a serious\nbreach, or face a penalty of up to one\nmillion Euros or two percent of turnover.\n\nIt is worth noting that hacktivist groups\nare often the agents responsible for\ninformation leakage. For instance,\nmembers of “Anonymous”, a famous\nhacktivist group, are not only known for\nbringing down commercial systems and\nwebsites, they have also infiltrated into\ncommercial organisations’ computer\nsystems, exposing correspondence and\npersonal data to the public in the process.\n\nIn 2010, Anonymous penetrated Sony’s\nnetwork and cost the latter US$170\nmillion dollars in reparation for the\nunauthorised disclosure of customers’\nnames and credit card numbers. Another\nAnonymous’ affiliate group AntiSec\ndumped over 860,000 user credentials\nincluding 75,000 sets of personal and\nfinancial information into the open\nInternet after breaking into the firm\nStratfor’s systems.\n\nDuring the past few years, industries\nall around the globe have witnessed\nfor the first time carefully engineered\nand profoundly complex attacks such\nas Stuxnet, Night Dragon and Shamoon\n(these will be described later in the\ndocument). Cyber security has become a\ngrim issue that no one can avoid.\n\n\na hacker can allow perpetrators to seize have already enacted legislation to for the first time carefully engineered\ncontrol of your computer, read your emails curb such problems.

These incidents usually take\nthe form of cyber espionage or denial-ofservice (DoS)[3] attacks against the utilities’\nindustrial-control systems.\n\nAccording to a survey report released by\nThe Centre for Strategic and International\nStudies in 2010, “critical infrastructure\nfirms such as power grids, industrial\ncontrol networks and oil refineries are\nfacing staggering level of cyber attacks,\nand are not adequately prepared to\ndefend themselves”.\n\nIn April 2012, the US Cyber Security\nresponse team warned of attacks upon\nthe gas industry. The Industrial Control\nSystems Cyber Emergency Response\nTeam (ICS-CERT) reported a number of\ncyber intrusions targeting gas pipeline\ncompanies. Analysis of the attacks\nconfirmed they are part of an ongoing\ncampaign dating back to December 2011\nand indicated Spear Phishing was used\nto target a number of specific individuals\nacross the gas pipeline industry.\n\n\nIn another case, unidentified hackers\nhelped a manufacturer in China obtain the\nbreakthrough design of a wind turbine\nby an energy company in the United\nKingdom. The Chinese manufacturer\nsubsequently made and sold the product\nat a much lower price, driving the original\ncompany in the UK into closure.\n\nDoS attacks represent yet another form of\ncyber security attacks which cause huge\nfinancial losses and massive damage to\ncompanies in the ENR sector. A report\npublished by McAfee in 2011 stated that\nfour out of every five oil, gas and power\ncompanies have suffered at least one\nDoS attack in 2011.\n\nCyber attacks are also increasingly\nescalating into cyber warfare. In an\nOctober 2012 Wall Street Journal article,\nU.S. officials noted that “Iranian hackers\nwith government ties have mounted\ncyber attacks in 2012 against American\ntargets, escalating a low-grade cyber war\n... The Iranian effort culminated in a series\nof attacks against U.S. banks as well as\nelectronic assaults on energy companies\nin the Persian Gulf.”\n\nThese incidents clearly show the\nincreasing severity of cyber attacks and\ngive an idea on how important cyber\nsecurity will be in the future.\n\n3 A denial-of-service (DoS) attack or distributed denial-ofservice (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or\nnetwork resource unavailable to its intended users.\n\n\n###### Spear phishing is an e-mail spoofing fraud attempt that targets a specific organisation, seeking unauthorised access to confidential data.\n\n\n###### Shamoon\nOn 15 August 2012, Saudi Aramco, a\nlarge national oil and gas company with\nglobal operations, announced that they\nhad to disconnect their IT systems\nfrom the Internet while dealing with a\nserious disruption of their network. The\ndisruption, which continued for two\nweeks, was the result of a cyber attack\nthat used a computer virus to disable over\n30,000 of the company's workstations.\n\nThe virus, later named as “Shamoon”,\nwas the first significant cyber attack on a\ncommercial target to cause real damage.\nIt is also the most destructive attack the\nprivate sector has experienced to date.\n\n\nLater in the same month Rasgas, a main\nplayer in the Qatari Liquid and Natural\nGas scene, was also hit by the Shamoon\n(as per security experts) virus and\nconsequently forced to bring their entire\nnetwork offline.\n\n###### Night Dragon\nAnother series of cyber incidents in the\nENR sector were dubbed collectively\nby security company McAfee as\n“Night Dragon”. McAfee believes that\nthese attacks on global oil, energy and\npetrochemical companies may have\nstarted as early as in 2007.\n\nEvidence from McAfee has shown\nthat this series of well-coordinated and\nspecifically focused attacks involve\na myriad of different techniques and\nmethods. The primary target seems to be\nany financial information related to bids\nand oil-and-gas operations.\n\nMcAfee also pointed out that all the\nattacks took place regularly during\nweekdays from 9am to 5pm in GMT\n+8 time zone, which matched with the\nsource location as determined by the\nIP address, thus pointing at the high\npossibility of “company men” being hired\nto perform the job systematically.\n\n###### Others\nThere are many more cyber security\nincidents which have taken place in the\nENR industry.\n\nIn 2011, a Canadian-based company\nwhich supplies remote administration and\nmonitoring tools to Fortune 100 energy\ncompanies reported that it had suffered\na security breach. Upon breaching the\ncorporate network, the attackers installed\nmalicious software on computers and\nstole information related to a remote\nadministration tool which the company\nsupplies.\n\nAnother incident of more recent times\noccurred in early 2013. In February\n2013, the US Department of Energy\nconfirmed that computers and servers\nat its Washington headquarters were\ncompromised in the previous month.\nIn this attack, personally identifiable\ninformation of several hundred employees\nand contractors may have been\ncompromised. Seemingly non-critical at\nfirst glance, this information may however\nbe used to further future attacks into\nhaving serious consequences.\n\n\nThese incidents clearly show the\nincreasing severity of cyber attacks and\ngive an idea on how important cyber\n\nA denial-of-service (DoS) attack or distributed denial-of-\nservice (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or\nnetwork resource unavailable to its intended users.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Overview of Major Problems\n\nThe obvious question to ask is why these\nvarious organisations are so vulnerable in\nthe face of cyber attackers.\n\nIn 2012, Carnegie Mellon University\nconducted their yearly survey for largest\nAmerican companies. The results\nindicated that more than 70 percent of\nC-Suite executives and members of the\nboard are not actively involved in the\nprotection of their company data. They\nare also rarely involved in the inspection\nof key employees working on information\nsecurity or the revision of corporate-wide\npolicies in this aspect.\n\nA similar trend has been observed by\nthe Government Accountability Office\nin American government agencies.\nDespite receiving numerous security\nrecommendations each year, companies\nwere not implementing these properly.\nKey personnel were also not being trained\nadequately. In addition, there is a lack of\nproper monitoring on security controls or\n\n\nappropriate key performance indicators to\nassess improvement.\n\nThe ENR sector is critical as it powers\nthe growth of almost every economy\nin the world. The sector can be broadly\ndivided into three categories: electricity,\npetroleum and natural gas. In the\nelectricity category, both automation\nsystems and utilities controls of electricity\ninfrastructure are built on a complicated\nsystem known as the Supervisory\nControl and Data Acquisition (SCADA).\nSimilarly, the production and distribution\nof petroleum and natural gas are heavily\ndependent on systems similar to SCADA.\n\nUnfortunately, such industrial\ninfrastructure control systems have been\nfacing a severe legacy problem in recent\nyears. They have been rashly connected\nto the Internet for remote accessibility\nwithout implementing adequate security\nmeasures. This has in turn led to higher\nchances of such systems falling prey to\ncyber attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The who & why of cyber attacks\n\n\n###### Document meta-data is information ‘about’ a document, or information on its properties. It often informs who created a document, when and where on a device or network.\n\n\nAccording to version information\nretrieved from document meta-data,\n71 percent of the 2000 companies may\nbe using potentially vulnerable and outdated versions of Microsoft and Adobe\nsoftware.\n\nFurthermore, 16 percent of corporate\nweb servers may be vulnerable to\nattack due to missing security patches\nor out-dated server software. Many\ninstances of un-patched and unsupported\nweb server software were found to be\nserving Forbes 2000 corporate websites.\n\n###### Figure 2: Number of potentially sensitive \n\n\n4 Stuxnet is a computer worm discovered in June 2010\n\nthat is believed to have been created to attack Iran's\nnuclear facilities. Stuxnet initially spreads via Microsoft\nWindows, and targets Siemens industrial software and\nequipment. Kaspersky Lab concluded that the sophisticated\n\nattack could only have been conducted \"with nation-state\nsupport\". Different variants of Stuxnet targeted five Iranian\norganizations, with the probable target widely suspected to be\n\nuranium enrichment infrastructure in Iran\n\n\nIn this era of information and\nconnectivity, malicious hackers are able\nto easily find information assets as\ntargets in a corporate network.\n\nWhat is at stake is financially valuable\ndata such as mergers-and-acquisitions\nplans, transaction records, quarterly/\nannual reports and internet banking\ndetails. Strategic information including\nintellectual property, contact details\nof senior executives, records of legal\ndisputes and various trade secrets are\nalso at risk.\n\nIn addition, personal data like employees’\naddresses and date of birth, once\ncompromised might very well be used in\nfacilitating identity theft.\n\nLast but not least, process control\nnetworks are being increasingly favoured\nby attackers given their vast potential\nin bringing about significant impact, as\nproven in the famous Stuxnet case[4]\nand other incidents described earlier.\nGiven how the numerous production\nand exploration activities carried out by\nenergy companies are dependent on\nthese networks, this trend is of particular\nrelevance and importance to the ENR\nsector.\n\nA 2011 report by KPMG has shown that\noil and gas operations are amongst the\ntop 10 sectors which suffer from the\nmost information leakages worldwide.\nInformation leakages involving oil and gas\noperations account for six percent of all\nsecurity incidents.\n\nSome of the sources of leakage\nare within the direct control of the\ncorporation and can be prevented if\ncompanies put in the effort. These\nsources include websites, documents\nand web servers. However, there are also\nother channels such as popular search\nengines and forums which are outside of\nthe usual enterprise security curtain and\npose a much more complex challenge.\n\nThe KPMG report also revealed that\n78 percent of Forbes 2000 corporate\nwebsites leak some form of potentially\nuseful information through their\ndocument meta-data.\n\n\n-----\n\nPart of KPMG’s research focused on\nthe structure of the Forbes 2000\ncorporate websites to identify any\npotentially sensitive file locations or\nhidden functionality that may be useful\nto cyber attackers. A number of file\nlocations marked ‘private’ were also\nidentified, hosting documents that were\nnot intended for public consumption\n(See Figure 2 below).\n\nThe direct result is that out of all the\nservers used for corporate websites,\n15 percent offer hacker access to test\nfunctionality and private login portals that\npotentially allow file upload capabilities\nthat could likely lead to full take-over of\nservers by cyber attackers.\n\nOil & Gas operations have also emerged\nin the list of top 10 sectors that post\n\n\nmost information to public forums\nand newsgroups. There are as\nmany as 88,681 of such postings in\nnewsgroup alone, according to the\nreport.\n\nIf past experience has taught us\nanything, it is that cyber attackers and\norganised crime do not target one\navenue of attack. Instead, they use a\ncombination of available information\nleaks to profile a target, and map out\nthe target’s internal systems and their\ncomponents.\n\nIt is important to emphasise that\nthe processes used to gather the\ninformation leaks mentioned above are\nnot sophisticated and available to anyone\nwith access to the Internet and little\nmore than a web browser.\n\n\n######  file locations on the Forbes 2000 corporate websites by sector\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Industrial Control System\n\nThe problem is even worse when it\ncomes to control systems which are\nwidely adopted by ENR industries,\nas explained by chief cyber security\nstrategist from Computer Sciences\nCorporation (CSC ), Donald Purdy.\nPurdy, formerly a cyber official at the\nDepartment of Homeland Security,\nmentioned during a major security\nconference in San Francisco in 2012:\n\n“These are older systems so they are\nharder to control. And for convenience\nand cost savings, people have connected\nthem to the internet in order to control\nthem from remote locations. So this\nis almost a perfect storm in terms of\nvulnerability because the nation is so\ndependent on these systems… This is a\nsignificant security issue for the United\nStates and frankly for the world.”\n\nIn the monthly monitor report released\nlast September by the US Industrial\nControl Systems Cyber Emergency\nResponse Team (ICS-CERT), it was also\nmentioned that “the positive aspects of\nbetter connectivity were overshadowed\nby the introduction of significant\nvulnerabilities”.\n\nFor instance, Justin W. Clarke, a\n30-year-old cyber security researcher\nand electric utility expert discovered\ntwo major vulnerabilities in 2012 on\nSiemens’ RuggedCom equipment which\nis extensively used by companies in\ncommunicating with power stations\nsituated in different locations.\n\nThe first vulnerability is essentially a secret\n“back door” which would easily allow\nhackers remote access into the equipment.\nThe second vulnerability makes it possible\nfor hackers to intercept the network traffic\nbetween operator and devices which may\ncontain authentication credentials. Potential\nattackers could take advantage of such\nflaws to manipulate power stations or\nuse these flaws to launch another set of\nattacks on a much larger scale.\n\nThe situation is made even worse when\nindependent researchers release and\ncirculate system flaws and vulnerabilities\nfor reference and countermeasure\nstudies. While the intention behind such\ndocuments might be good, the direct\nconsequence is that many could now\neasily gain access to dangerous and\npowerful “weapons” such as the code\n\n\nof Stuxnet, which can cause immense\ndamage to critical infrastructures.\n\nIn contrast to the published vulnerabilities,\ncertain manufacturers of critical system\ncontrollers are reacting way too slowly\nwhich have resulted in research groups like\nDigital Bond, releasing exploits for these\nvulnerabilities in order to “stimulate” the\npatching and upgrading efficiency.\n\nWhen it comes to electrical power,\ntechnology is also a double-edged sword.\nWhile advances in smart grid technologies\nhave helped better detect power theft\nand reduce power loss with smart meters\nbeen recently deployed in countries such\nas in Serbia and Brazil, these technologies\nalso give rise to possibilities of their\nadvanced functionalities being used for\nshady purposes.\n\nFor instance, two demonstrations\nat Security B-Sides and Black Hat\nconferences illustrated that hackers\ncould basically tweak the smart metres\ncurrently in use to perform functionalities\nas they wish, which include changing of\ntemperature, controlling of lighting and\neven cutting of power during emergencies.\n\nAs a side note on corporate security\npolicies and procedures, the Saudi Aramco\nincident where large number of business\ncomputers were disabled, also highlighted\nimportance of monitoring network attacks\ninitiated by inside personnel and the\npotential danger of using portable storage\nmedia like thumb drives.\n\n\n#### Categorised Active Players\n\nOver the years, two major shifts in trends\nhave been observed in terms of cyber\nattacks.\n\nFirstly, the targets are shifting from\nindividual organisations to chains of\nrelated companies. Secondly, the main\ncomponents of attackers have shifted\nfrom script kiddies to criminal groups,\nwith the latter being much more\nspecialised and coordinated.\n\nSome of the major players include:\n\n- organised cyber criminals who are\n\nmost known for mass stealing of\npersonal identities and financial data,\n\n- state or corporate sponsored\n\nespionage like the Night Dragon\noperation which aims to steal critical\nintellectual and business information,\n\n- hacktivists such as Wikileaks,\n\nAnonymous and LulzSec who have\namassed a large number of supporters\nand participants,\n\n- malicious inside personnel, as in the\n\ncase of Bradley Edward Manning,\na United States Army soldier who\nwas arrested in May 2010 in Iraq on\nsuspicion of having passed classified\nmaterial to the website WikiLeaks.\n\nJust as attacks have evolved, companies\ntoo must evolve by re-evaluating their\nown ability to detect, defend and respond\nto cyber attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Various Attack Vectors\n\nCyber incidents can be loosely divided\ninto three categories. The first category\nis accidental events due to human\nerror, system failure or unanticipated\naccidents. The second category refers to\nunauthorised access into networks and\nsystems by hackers or employees. The\nthird category does not require actual\naccess as it usually causes denial of\nservice or loss of data.\n\nAttack methods could involve\ncomplicated and coordinated efforts\nto beat the cyber security protection\nmechanism and intelligence\nreconnaissance, followed by social\nengineering techniques for acquiring of\ntarget information.\n\nThere are six most common types\nof security failings. These are shared\naccounts, weak passwords, lack of\neffective network monitoring, lack of\neffective Web monitoring, absence of\nlogging and absence of log analysis.\nLack of user awareness also provides\nmore opportunities for social engineering\nattempts to succeed. Examples of such\nattempts include luring Internet users\n\n###### Figure 3: Methods of attack\n\n%\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n#### 14.7\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nCompromised\n\nweb\napplications\n\nSource: 2012 KPMG paper \"A nuanced perspective on cybercrime\"\n\n\ninto execution of malware and Spear\nPhishing. (See Figure 3 below).\n\nA group of attackers who are particularly\ngood at social engineering is Anonymous.\nThese hackers typically exploit easy-toguess passwords of users or use emails\nto trick users into revealing confidential\ninformation or into clicking links which\nlead to the download of malicious\nsoftware.\n\nHowever, Anonymous is not the only\ngroup of people who are familiar with\nthis technique. In fact, cyber criminals\nand state-sponsored attackers have\nbeen practising it for a far longer time.\nThe stakes are also bigger for them as\nthey stand to gain a whole lot more of\nimportant information.\n\nEddie Schwartz, chief security officer\nof the security firm RSA summed it up\nbest during a security conference in San\nFrancisco in 2012 when he said: “The\nattacks by them (Anonymous) pale in\ncomparison to the nation-state stuff and\nthe criminal element… The more eyes,\nthe greater chance of success (for an\nattack)”, which accurately depicts the\ncyber environment nowadays.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Impact on companies who fall prey to such attacks\n\nThe objectives of cyber attacks can be\ndivided into two distinct categories.\nThese are\n\n- misappropriation and theft of\n\nintellectual property, financial data\nor other confidential information for\nmonetary gain or to gain a competitive\nedge;\n\n- corruption or disturbance of key\n\nbusiness assets and processes for\nstrategic purposes or to make an\nactivism statement,\n\nHowever, the actual impact on victim\ncompanies could be much broader and\nmore profound.\n\nMore specifically, direct consequences\nof such attacks comprise disruption of\nbusiness and production processes,\nunauthorised access to monetary\noperation, loss of intellectual property,\ndisclosure of merger-and-acquisition\n\n\ndeals, identity theft and compromising\nof customer data. Such attacks can also\nadversely affect third party partners in the\nindustrial chain. (See Figure 4 below).\n\nBut all the above consequences are\njust the tip of the iceberg. Deeper\nfinancial and reputational impact further\nincludes loss of competitive advantage\nin accessing new fields, failure to keep\ncurrent clients and investors, losing\ndeals and disputes (or winning them on\nunfavourable terms), regulatory fines,\nliability lawsuits, share price drops, costs\ninvolved in fixing business relationships\nand even negative international publicity.\n\nIn addition, the company would very\nlikely be forced to spend more than usual\nto fix systems and repair damages. It\nis also very likely that costly fees will\nbe incurred from services of third party\nexperts and consultants for mitigation and\nrecovery services. There could also be\nforced expenditure on personnel change,\norganisational restructuring and additional\ntraining.\n\n#### 12.1\n 10.6\n\nObtaining Other\ninformation\n\nconcerning\n\nmergers &\nacquisitions\n\nSource: 2012 KPMG paper \"A nuanced perspective on cybercrime\"\n\n\n-----\n\n## How companies can cope\n\n\n#### The need for action\n\nHowever, effective awareness requires\ncontinuous effort to remain vigilant. In this\naspect the financial institutions seem to\nbe doing a better job in understanding the\npotential “enemy” compared to the other\nindustries, including the ENR sector.\n\n\nIran is to move key ministries and\nstate bodies off the worldwide\ninternet next month in an effort\nto shield them behind a secure\ncomputer wall from disruptive cyber\nattacks like the Stuxnet and Flame\nviruses. “The establishment of the\nnational intelligence network will\ncreate a situation where the precious\nintelligence of the country won’t be\naccessible to these powers.”\n\n**Iran to unplug from Web to escape ‘Internet**\n**monopoly’ [August 2012]**\n\n\nThe Obama administration submitted\na cyber security proposal to Congress\nlast May to outline its priorities for\ncyber security and to press lawmakers\nto pass comprehensive legislation to\nprotect critical U.S. infrastructure that\npowers the Internet, utilities, and other\ncontrol systems that are vulnerable to\nattack.\n\n**Feds Simulate Crippling Cyber security**\n**Attack On NYC Electricity [March 2012]**\n\n\nAdvances in technology and mounting\nconcern about the potential for a cyber\nattack to damage power stations,\nwater-treatment plants and other\ncritical systems have prompted senior\nofficials to seek a more robust role for\nthe department’s Cyber Command. For\none thing, cyber attacks can take place\nin milliseconds. The assailant may be\nunknown. The attack route may be hard\nto trace, crossing multiple countries.\n\n**Pentagon proposes more robust role for its**\n**cyber-specialists [August 2012]**\n\n\nThe key is to be able to understand the\nmotives behind a cyber attack. It must\nbe made clear the cyber world is no\nlonger playing in the “minor league”, but\nrather the “major league” with players\nwho potentially have access to unlimited\nresources and endless patience in\nachieving an aforementioned objective.\n\nOn a second note it is extremely\nnecessary to conduct thorough analysis\nof risks and have a clear understanding\nof the different asset value perception.\nWhat seems of little value to one firm\nmight be worth a lot more to attackers\nwho have a totally different perspective\nor who are planning an attack on a chain\nof companies.\n\nAs a result, consideration should be given\nto the relationship between the costs\nfor implementing detective controls and\ncosts of incidents. The latter should\ninclude indirect damages incurred on\nconsumer confidence and reputation, the\ntwo most valuable assets of a company.\n\nA 2012 survey titled ”A nuanced\nperspective on cybercrime” which was\nconducted by KPMG in Netherlands,\n\n\nstated that out of the 170 responding\norganisations under various sectors\nincluding ENR, approximately\n19 percent of them spend more than 1.5\nmillion euros on cybercrime prevention,\ndetection and response per year.\n\nThirdly, whether short term measures\nor long term controls have been\nimplemented, the upper management of\ncompanies should never be complacent\nand believe that they enjoy 100 percent\nsecurity. The IT landscape in many\nmodern organisations is simply often too\ncomplex for complete protection.\n\nThe same 2012 KPMG survey also\nrevealed that 45 percent of companies\nexperienced attempts of cybercrime\nattacks in 2011. In addition, 55 percent\nof respondents were unsure of whether\nthey can effectively respond to a\ncybercrime attack, and only 20 percent\nsaid they can respond effectively to an\nattack but unfortunately do not have an\nattack response plan in place. Among all\nthe responding corporates, approximately\n30 percent have forensic capabilities as a\ncontrol and only 55 percent have central\nincident and event monitoring capabilities.\n\n\nMost importantly, it is vital for the\nmanagement to set the correct tone.\nKPMG's experience with clients has\nshown over and over again that security\nis largely a management issue.\n\nThe survey also showed that more\nthan 75 percent of respondents believe\nthat fighting cybercrime goes beyond\ninstalling the needed technology to curb\nit. Some 90 percent of them also agree\nthat cybercrime should be discussed at\nthe board level.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### So are companies in the ENR industry up to the challenge?\n\nMost respondents from the ENR sector\nof the same KPMG survey do not think\nso. They believe that hackers are more\nlikely to win in this sector compared to\nother industries.\n\nIf a company does not consider itself to be\nready, actions must be taken. Management\nshould endorse prevention efforts and start\nseeking a structured approach.\n\nThere also has to be effective use\nof security monitoring and seamless\ncooperation between the different parties\ninvolved so that knowledge and expertise\ncan be shared among government,\nbusiness communities, IT security groups\nand even cross-border organisations.\n\nBeyond the prevention of incidents,\ntimely detection and an adequate\n\n\nresponse are also critical. If there is any\nmajor gap or deficiency in the policies,\nprocedures and tools of a company, the\nworst time to discover these would be\nwhen a cyber security incident is already\nset on its course.\n\nIn terms of short-term actions, the\ncompany could perform risk analysis from\nthe perspective of an attacker, identify\nand monitor critical assets as well as\nbegin implementing a standby incident\nresponse team.\n\nIn the long run, companies should strive\nfor cost-effective control of the cyber\nenvironment by addressing the domains\nof people, processes and technology.\n\nYet, even the most comprehensive\nsecurity control system cannot guarantee\nthe complete prevention of cyber\nincidents. An incident response plan and\nan emergency action plan is therefore\n\n\nalso of paramount value in the proper\nhandling of a security compromise and\nreducing the subsequent damage.\n\nIf a thorough and detailed plan is not\navailable, the very least an organisation\nshould do is to be familiar with some\nbasic concepts and simple primary\nactions to respond to an incident.\n(See Figure 5 below). This helps the\ncompany achieve more effective\nbusiness resilience, which is important\nespecially for the protection of the most\ncritical assets. The fundamentals of\ncybersecurity are probably best summed\nup by Ron Ross, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) Senior\nFellow, who said during a launch of NIST’s\nlatest guidance on security controls: “The\nfundamentals of cyber security … I call it\nthe physics of security … don't change\nover time … how we apply those controls\n... is a little bit different, but the same\nfundamentals.”\n\n###### Short term action prevention Perform risk analysis from perspective of attacker\n\n#### Detect\n\n###### Short term action detection Identify and monitor critical assets\n\nSource: 2012 KPMG paper \"A nuanced perspective on cybercrime\"\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Suggested frameworks\n\nGiven the shifting perspective of the\ndefence against cybercrime, a more modern\napproach to cyber security therefore also\nfocuses on the perspective of the criminals.\n\nIn terms of risk assessment, the\norganisation must not only consider itself as\nan attractive end target, but also consider\nits part in the supply chain. It should\nalso not view itself as one entity that\nshould be protected, but as a collection of\nprocesses, users and IT infrastructure.\n\nCompanies should focus on being well\ninformed of (the character) of possible\nthreats and invest in a proper defence.\nThey should not do this in an isolated\nway, but rather use the knowledge\nand experience of colleagues in both\nthe public and private sector. A joint\nresponse is essential for protection\n\n\nagainst cyber espionage, terrorism,\ncrime and disruption of information and\ncommunication systems.\n\n###### ICS-CERT Recommendation\nWith respect to the industrial control system,\nICS-CERT[5] suggests a proactive security\nmodel as depicted in the Figure 6 below.\n\nThis model can be further complemented\nwith a more detailed five-step approach in\nprotecting information and records:\n\n- Obtain executive sponsorship, establish\n\na team, and determine the team's goal,\nobjectives, and milestones - ensuring\nthat these efforts are aligned with the\ngoals of the business.\n\n- Develop a training and awareness\n\ncampaign. Policy content should\nbe comprehensive, consistent and\nimplemented with process changes\n\n\nand the introduction of appropriate\ncontrols and metrics to measure\neffectiveness and compliance.\n\n- Assess the current state of the\n\norganisation's information protection\nefforts. Classifying the sensitivity of\ninformation should be a key goal.\n\n- Design the desired state of information\n\nintegrity protection, with the goal of\nestablishing improved handling and\nprotection practices that achieve policy\nrequirements, lower business risk, and\nincrease productivity.\n\n- Implement the desired state.\n\nEnhanced process and data\nworkflows, controls, and processes\nare a key outcome. The result is\na programme that helps leaders\nensure the risk-based protection of\ninformation assets.\n\n\n5 The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) is part of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and works to reduce risks within and across all critical\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Real life case studies\n\nThere have been quite a few cases\nworldwide where KPMG applied the\nuse of frameworks and helped different\nclients with their needs in achieving the\ngoal of cyber security.\n\n\nIn the Dutch market, joint efforts\nof the financial sector are pretty\nsuccessful in boosting awareness.\nAside from cooperation between\nfinancial institutions and the\nGovernment, KPMG also actively\nshares experiences as part of the\nfocused joint efforts.\n\nGenerally, there are three types\nof security controls: prevention,\ndetection and response.\n\n\n#### KPMG in the Netherlands provides the banks with an update on the trends in cybercrime threats and potential solutions twice a year.\n\n KPMG employs a global network of hundreds of information security specialists, which reaches virtually all major financial institutions worldwide.\n\n Attack patterns observed at other banks and solutions applied by these institutions help to shape an image of upcoming attacks and solutions relevant for Company B.\n\n Knowledge of the latest cybercrime attack trends and defence measures helps Company B to update the bank’s defences on time in order to adequately respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn general, preventive controls are\nmore popular than detective controls\nwhereas detective controls are used\nmore often than responsive controls,\nas in this case of how KPMG helped\na company in the ENR industry.\n\nHowever, as discussed earlier,\nincidents cannot be avoided 100\npercent of the time. This implies that\ndetection and response are equally\nimportant and are thus the areas with\nthe biggest room for improvement.\n\n\n#### Company Z is a well-known company in the oil, gas and natural resources industry.\n\n KPMG firms’ teamed with a technology partner provider to supervise one of the largest global implementations of a security monitoring platform. The platform correlates information about thousands of security events from numerous systems spanning across the globe.\n\n A list of the most relevant cybercrime risks for Company Z\n\n was drafted in close cooperation with the organisation. For each risk, a set of detection rules was defined.\n\n The ability to adequately respond is mainly achieved by properly established processes and governance. KPMG advised on governance structure, engineered new incident response processes and established training programmes for security personnel.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is another example illustrating\nKPMG’s experience in adequate and\nsystematic response after a security\nincident has taken place:\n\n\n####    Company A was informed by a whistleblower that an attacker gained access to the company’s website and/or closed environment. In response to this news the website was taken offline and KPMG was asked to assist.\n\n • A collaboration of Forensic technology and IT security\n experts captured forensically sound images of the most critical servers to make sure no traces or evidence were lost.\n • The images were analysed for traces in system files\n and properties, logs from firewalls were secured and analysed, KPMG also analysed all traffic to and from the compromised servers.\n • The analysis showed that the perpetrator succeeded in\n creating and uploading several files to the web server that contained malicious code, allowing the perpetrator to send commands to the server from a remote location.\n • KPMG helped the client by implementing remedial\n procedures and additional security measures, thus mitigating the risk of further damage and bad publicity.\n\n\nEven if it is within an organisation itself,\none way of improving the handling\nof specific cyber incidents related to\nindustrial control systems would be\nto gather a group of staff to conduct\nbrainstorming and collaboration exercises\n\nDuring such sessions, staff from various\ndepartments will get to receive more\n\n\nadequate cyber security training, initiate\neffective inter-departmental interactions,\nand update antiquated policies and\nprocedures. They can also get to identify\nand fix any security flaws found in the\nsystem, so as to create a corporate and\norganisational environment that is more\nresistant to cyber attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nThe battle against cyber crime is one which is difficult to win.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Asia Pacific region, we understand that data security\nis not an easy concept for most business leaders to fully grasp. In part, this is\nbecause many organisations do not have a clear view on the actual value of their\ndata and as a result, tend to follow a one-size-fits-all approach to data security.\n\nAt the same time, organisations in this region have also seen a gradual migration\nof their corporate value away from physical assets (such as facilities, products\nand people) towards digital assets (such as bid information, technology designs\nor customer data). Therefore, most businesses have robust crisis plans for events\nlike floods, fires or sudden executive departures, but have very few for digital\nsecurity issues.\n\nAn organisation in the ENR industry must stay as up-to-date as possible with\nsecurity issues and set in place effective security measures. Beyond doing so, an\nENR organisation must evaluate itself through the eyes of potential attackers so\nas to identify and protect parts which represent the highest substantial value.\n\nThe importance of executive leadership and support in developing a data security\nstrategy cannot be overstated. The risk of data loss should be a board-level issue\nand not a challenge isolated to the IT department and risk managers. This means\nthat executives must not only ‘walk the walk’ when it comes to complying with\nprotocols, but also actively participate in the development of security to ensure\nthat the rules reflect the priorities of the business. Most importantly, executives\nmust strive to institutionalise continuous improvement mechanisms to ensure\nthat they learn from hard-earned lessons of the past.\n\nShould a cyber security transformation be undertaken, the five recommended\nobjectives would be to Prevent, to Prepare, to Protect, to Remediate and to\nIntegrate and Transform.\n\nHowever, given the scope and complexity of the challenge, it is not surprising\nthat most executives are left wondering how best to approach the issue without\ndampening productivity or expending scarce resources.\n\nIt is important that executives in the Asia Pacific region balance a cautious\napproach to IT security with the downside and damage that can be caused\nby the lack of being able to carry on business as normal and the loss of\nconfidential and sensitive information.\n\n\n-----\n\n## References\n\n|Internal|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|A NUANCED perspective on cybercrime – Shifting viewpoints — call for action|http://www.kpmg.com/TT/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/ Nuanced-Perspective-on-Cybercrime-Art.pdf|\n|Publish and be Damned|http://www.kpmg.com/UK/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/ PDF/Advisory/Forbes-Survey-publish-and-be-damned.pdf|\n|KPMG Global Energy Institute — Shamoon and Cyber Security in the Energy Industry|http://www.visualwebcaster.com/imageSlides/90364/GEI%20Presentation%20 110812%20(Color).pdf|\n|Information Integrity — Improving and http://www.kpmg.com/US/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/ Protecting Data Quality, Access, and information-integrity.pdf Value||\n\n\n-----\n\n|External|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|FBI — Combating Threats in the Cyber World Outsmarting Terrorists, Hackers, and Spies|http://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/combating-threats-in-the-cyber-world- outsmarting-terrorists-hackers-and-spies|\n|Fact Sheet: Safeguarding the U.S. Government's Classified Information and Networks|http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/07/fact-sheet-safeguarding-us- governments-classified-information-and-network|\n|CF Disclosure Guidance: Topic No. 2|http://sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/cfguidance-topic2.htm|\n|INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS — CYBER EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM : Monthly Monitor April 2012|http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-CERT_Monthly_Monitor_Apr2012. pdf|\n|INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS -
