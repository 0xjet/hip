We believe with\nmedium confidence that a team we call internally as \"Donot Team\" is responsible for the new\nmalware and will resume targeting of South Asia.\n\nIn a likely effort to disguise the malware and its operations, the authors coded several\nreferences into the malware for football—it is unclear whether they mean American football\nor soccer. The theme may allow the network traffic to fly under the radar.\n\nWhile we believe this framework and its components are new, it shares many Tactics,\nTechniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) with the EHDevel\n[malware framework. In September 2017, Bitdefender released a white paper describing](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/ehdevel-the-story-of-a-continuously-improving-advanced-threat-creation-toolkit/)\nEHDevel and some of the campaigns that used it. Some of the highlights of it included the\nfollowing:\n\nLabeled as an APT (advanced persistent threat) and active since at least 2016.\nModular architecture with malware functionality spread over multiple components.\nComponents used a variety of programming languages (C++, .NET, Python, VBS, and\nAutoIt).\nFunctionality included: file collection, screenshots, key logging, and gathering system\ninformation.\nCommand and control (C2) hosts stored in a document hosted on Google Docs.\nDecoy documents, timestamp analysis, and C2 server log analysis showed a focus on\nPakistan.\n\nWe assess with medium confidence that the yty framework is a replacement for the EHDevel\nframework and that the Donot Team may start using it in campaigns in a similar manner as\nEHDevel. The evolution from EHDevel to yty shows the threat actors are continually\nimproving and modifying their malware framework, adding to their sophistication.\n\n## Campaign Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nDonot Team campaigns use multiple methods to mimic legitimate applications, organizations,\nand services like Adobe, Gmail or news outlets. They also including seemingly benign\ndomains that likely raise minimal suspicion to a human observer. The following domains are\na few examples:\n\nabodeupdater[.]com\n\nAdobe update services\nqmails[.]org\n\nGmail webmail service\nserviceupports[.]com\n\nGeneric services domains\nsundayobserver[.]net\n\nMimics weekly English-language newspaper in Sri Lanka\nthebangladeshtoday[.]net\n\nEnglish version of the national daily newspaper in Bangladesh\n\nThe actors use false personas to register their domains instead of opting for privacy\nprotection services. Depending on the registrar service chosen, this could be seen as\nanother cost control measure. The actors often used typo-squatting to slightly alter a\nlegitimate domain name. In contrast, the registration information used accurate spelling,\npossibly indicating the domain naming was intentional, typos included. Each unique\nregistrant usually registered only a few domains, but mistakenly reused phone numbers or\nthe registration data portrayed a similar pattern across domains. Looking at shared IP\ninfrastructure, it was easy to see the registration patterns and expand the network used by\nthe attackers. The Donot Team relies heavily on subdomains. Nearly every domain\ndiscovered through the course of this investigation had multiple, unique subdomains and\nevery malware sample analyzed communicated to subdomains. In at least two instances,\nthe domain never resolved to an IP address. Instead, the malware used subdomains, which\nlead to active infrastructure. Many of the sub-domains only navigated to the third level, but\nother samples used overly complex subdomain structures down to the sixth or seventh level.\n\nupdate.<domain>[.]com\nservice.<domain>[.]org\nmail-live.outlook-com.332dhgka93t-veri9fjg3j-2s33gl.system.thebangladeshtoday[.]net\n\nLooking at registration patterns and passive DNS, many of these domains resolve for as little\nas three days before going offline. It is possible the attackers use these small windows to\ntest their malware operations. Although we did not observe the original distribution of the\ncore binary, we believe the group specifically targeted Pakistani individuals based on the\ndecoy documents observed. They appeared to be official Government of Pakistan memos,\nsee Figure 1, above.\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nDonot Team s TTPs, infrastructure, and the malware code are strikingly similar to the\nEHDevel malware reported by BitDefender and is likely the same group of operators.\nBitdefender noted that the EHDevel malware appeared similar to malware analyzed by Blue\n[Coat Labs in their report “Snake in the Grass”. The “Snake in the Grass” report also showed](https://github.com/aptnotes/data/files/679036/Snake.In.The.Grass.-.Python-based.Malware.Used.For.Targeted.Attacks.-.BLUE.COAT.LABS.pdf)\nmalware similarities and infrastructure overlap with Operation Hangover (also known as the\nPatchwork Group). While Arbor agrees that there are suspicious similarities between the\nDonot Team and Patchwork, we did not uncover definitive evidence to link the two groups.\n[Additionally, a malicious document associated with yty was tagged by Hybrid Analysis as](https://twitter.com/HybridAnalysis/status/968958087712460800)\n“Viceroy Tiger”, but there hasn’t been much recent public information on this group that we\ncould find to corroborate.\n\n**yty Malware Framework Analysis**\n\nOne of the TTPs associated with the Donot Team is the use of modular/plugin-based\nmalware frameworks. We call the new malware framework “yty” (based on debugging strings\nin its components). The components of the framework are shown in Figure 2:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: yty malware components.\n\n**Circular.xls Analysis**\n\nThe first piece of the framework is a malicious Excel document named “Cirular.xls”\n(9ce56e1403469fc74c8ff61dde4e83ad72597c66ce07bbae12fa70183687b32d). The content\nof the spreadsheet is an executable that is extracted and executed by macros, Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n\n-----\n\n3: Circular.xls macro script\n\nThe delivery mechanism for the XLS file is unknown, but evidence suggests it could be a test\n\ndocument as seen in Figure 4:\n\nFigure 4: XLS document properties\n\n**.exe (Downloader 1) Analysis**\n\n**SHA256:**\n\n8d7eb0b7251bc4a40ebc9142a59ed8af16fb11cf8168e76dca48a78d6d7e4595\n\n**Compilation Date: 2018-02-05 09:06:13**\n\n**PDB Path: C:\\Users\\donot\\Documents\\Visual Studio**\n2010\\Projects\\downloader\\Debug\\downloader.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to a bug in the macro code, the extracted executable is saved as .exe . This is a\nstripped down C++ program that, as its PDB path string indicates, downloads and executes\nanother executable, then removes itself. The downloader attempts to retrieve and execute\nthe following file (not active at the time of research):\n\nhttp://conf.serviceupdateres[.]com/Setup.exe\n\nThis host is a direct overlap with the EHDevel malware framework as it was also\nseen distributing payloads in Bitdefender’s analysis.\n\n**Setup.exe (Downloader 2) Analysis**\n\n**SHA256: 6bbd10ac20782542f40f78471c30c52f0619b91639840e60831dd665f9396365**\n\n**Compilation Date: 2018-01-04 09:43:28**\n\n**PDB Path: C:\\Users\\803\\Desktop\\ytyboth\\yty 2.0\\Release\\Setup.pdb**\n\nSetup.exe is another downloader written in C++ but contains more functionality than the\n“.exe” downloader. First, it checks/creates a mutex named “toptwo” so that only one copy of\nitself is running on the victim.\n\n_Evasion Techniques_\n\nTo confuse malware analysts, it mixes in junk code as seen in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Junk code contained in binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt also has some basic anti-sandbox detection that tries to detect Virtual PC, Sandboxie, and\nVMware (example in Figure 6):\n\nFigure 6: VMWare check.\n\n_Debugging Code_\n\nSimilar to some components in the EHDevel framework, it creates logs for debugging\npurposes, though the messages are not as verbose as in EHDevel’s samples, Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Debugging log\n\n_Command & Control Much like EHDevel, in order to get its C2 host, it downloads a file from_\nGoogle Docs. The document in this case was located at:\n\nhttps://drive.google[.]com/uc?authuser=0&id=1BUuYXU6bLdH_k_NWQIo7n5Uo_7…\n\nAt the time of research, the name of the document was “ip2.txt” and it contained the following\nIP address:\n\n5.135.199[.]0\n\nPer its metadata, the owner of the document is:\n\nAlfred Vilfi\n[masterplan00007@gmail.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:masterplan00007@gmail.com)\n\nAn example C2 beacon is show in Figure 8:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n\n-----\n\n8: C2 beacon\n\nBased on the “/football/goal”, “score”, “ball”, and “loose” strings they are using a football\ntheme to help disguise its traffic. The POST data contains:\n\nCPU information\nWindows version\nIs a virtual machine?\nComputer name\nUser name\nSerial number of main disk volume\n\nAt the time of analysis, we only elicited a “loose” response from the C2 server. Continued\nexecution is reliant on eliciting a “win” response. If a “win” response does not occur, the\nmalware continues beaconing until it receives the appropriate response. Once the correct\nresponse is seen, the malware downloads the next component from the same C2 using the\nfollowing URL path:\n\n/football/download/2/boothelp\n\n_Persistence Mechanism_\n\nA secondary macro in circular.xls establishes persistence for the setup.exe download as\nseen in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Persistence mechanism\n\n_Unique Strings_\n\nSetup.exe introduces three common names seen in the rest of the malware framework:\n\n“yty”, the name we use for the framework, from the PDB path string.\n“bigdata” from the schtasks /tn (taskname) parameter used in the persistence\nmechanism.\n\n\n-----\n\nA bot id consisting of computer name, user name, and volume serial number\nseparated by dashes.\n\n**boothelp.exe – Plugin Downloader**\n\n**SHA256:**\n\na2e9d9a00e7e75ab1d5e96dd327a89b55608a0319461f2866aadada5bd50e728\n\n**Compilation Date: 2018-01-03 09:42:00**\n\n**PDB Path: C:\\Users\\803\\Desktop\\ytyboth\\yty 2.0\\Release\\boothelp.pdb**\n\nAnother TTP used by the Donot Team is the transition from one programming language to\nanother. We see this with boothelp.exe, which is written in .NET--instead of C++ like the\nother components. boothelp.exe is a downloader responsible for retrieving modules/plugins\nthat contain added functionality.\n\nThe plugin downloader uses the same C2 channels as setup.exe by downloading a Google\nDoc file which contains the C2 IP address. It then continues the football theme by beaconing\nto the “/football/flag” folder on the C2 server, Figure 10.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n10: C2 communications to retrieve modules\n\nUsing an HTML <div> element labeled “pcinfo”—possibly displayed verbatim in the C2 panel\n—the malware beacon message contains various pieces of system information outlined\nbelow:\n\nUser name\nComputer name\nWindows version\nNumber of processors\nSystem directory\nDomain name\n.NET version\nInformation on drives\nCPU information\n\nThe response from the C2 is an odd string containing multiple pieces, delimited by various\ncharacters, but boils down to what plugins to download/run and their file sizes. The plugins\nfor this framework were downloaded from the same URI path (“/football/download/2/”) where\nboothelp.exe was located. As of February 2018, we observed the following plugins:\n\nvstservice.exe – document listing plugin\nabode.exe – file exfiltration plugin\nmdriver.exe – key logger plugin\ndspcheck.exe – screenshot plugin\n\n\n-----\n\nmboard.exe – system information plugin\n\nThese modules share functionality with components of the EHDevel framework, creating\nfurther overlap between the two malware frameworks. boothelp.exe has an interesting but\nunused function that takes a list of benign URLs and opens connections to them. As noted\npreviously, we believe the actors are still testing the malware framework and it’s possible\nthese URLs will become an anti-analysis feature to hide C2 communication among benign\ntraffic. Some of the interesting benign URLs listed below:\n\nhttps://www.google[.]co.in/\nhttp://www.imdb[.]com/title/tt3501632/\nhttps://www.rottentomatoes[.]com/m/thor_ragnarok_2017\n\n**vstservice.exe – File Listing Plugin**\n\n**SHA256: e3fb0ab2f3d11f12c11b3ee1e1781eaec5581def820afe7e01902f31ba9e1936**\n\n**Compilation Date: 2018-01-03 08:14:32**\n\n**PDB Path: C:\\Users\\803\\Desktop\\ytyboth\\yty 2.0\\Release\\vstservice.pdb The vstservice.exe**\nplugin is .NET file responsible for sending a list of the file system to the C2. The malware\nretrieves the C2 from a Google Docs file like the previous binaries. The file was located at\nthe following location:\n\nhttps://docs.google[.]com/uc?id=0B42CqDoBbigYM1lEamRDRjhFbGc&export=dow…\n\nAt the time of research, the Google Doc was named “domain.txt” and contained the following\nC2 host:\n\nupload.cloudsekurity[.]online\n\nPer its metadata, it is owned by the same owner as the document above. The plugin sends\ntwo file listings. The first one focuses on files with the following extensions:\n\nppt\npdf\ndoc\nxls\ndocx\nxlsx\npptx\ndocm\nrtf\ninp\nxlsm\n\n\n-----\n\ncsv\nodt\npps\nvcf\n\nThe second one contains all other files. An example is shown in Figure 11.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n11: C2 file list name exfiltration\n\nThe URL path for this C2 references the “bigdata” string observed in the macro persistence\nmechanism. Some of the POST parameters are unclear, but contain the following items:\n\nstatus – hardcoded to “Found”\npath – hardcoded to “Unknown”\npc – bot ID\ntype – unclear\nfname – file name\ncnumber – a number representative of large files broken into chunks\norname – unclear\nofid – order ID for files broken into chunks\n\nSimilar to the plugin downloader, this plugin includes an unused function that connects to\nbenign URLs. Some of the URLs are listed below:\n\n**abode.exe – File Exfiltration Plugin**\n\n**SHA256: 4d0114b1292714a13d43a4c0de3ea4498fa752354ad4f5b73a8ba441af6064ae**\n\n**Compilation Date: 2018-01-03 08:14:46**\n\n**PDB Path: C:\\Users\\803\\Desktop\\ytyboth\\yty 2.0\\Release\\abode.pdb abode.exe is a .NET**\nfile capable of file exfiltration. It uses the same Google Doc document and C2 as the\nvstservice.exe plugin. Two sets of files can be exfiltrated. The first set is a periodic sending of\n\n\n-----\n\nfiles generated by other plugins that do not include a C2 mechanism themselves. The\nsecond set of files is specified by the C2 as seen in Figure 12.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n12: C2 response specifying file for exfiltration\n\nThe “id” parameter is hardcoded and the “pc” parameter is the bot ID. The file is then sent to\nthe C2 as seen in Figure 13.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n13: File exfiltration\n\nThis plugin also includes unused, benign URLs as seen below:\n\n**mdriver.exe – Keylogger Plugin**\n\n**SHA256: 600e7cfeea0ef8bd23cf95602a6b873898aa51848909aad1a7e8d4c5403797af**\n\n**Compilation Date: 2018-01-03 08:14:19**\n\n**PDB Path: C:\\Users\\803\\Desktop\\ytyboth\\yty 2.0\\Release\\mdriver.pdb This plugin is written**\nin C++ and is a key logger. It checks/creates a mutex named “twotwo“, uses the Windows\nSetWindowsHookEx and SetWinEventHook APIs to perform its key logging, and then relies\non abobe.exe to exfiltrate the captured key strokes. Figure 14 shows an example of\nexfiltrated key log data.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n14: Key log exfiltration\n\n**dspcheck.exe – Screenshot Plugin**\n\n**SHA256: 7d893d4f077e8e76a44a7830c5c3806dc956a6ef1a06c9f2dc33477c70f8cc9b**\n\n**Compilation Date: 2018-01-09 08:33:36**\n\n**PDB Path: D:\\Soft\\DevelopedCode\\yty 2.0\\Release\\dspcheck.pdb**\n\n\n-----\n\ndspcheck.exe is a screenshot plugin written in .NET. This plugin also shows evidence that\nthe actors are continuing their testing efforts as seen in Figure 15.\n\nFigure 15: Screenshot code shows testing evidence\n\nIt has the beginnings of C2 functionality, but this sample still relies on abobe.exe to send\nscreenshots back to the C2, see Figure 16.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16: Screenshot exfiltration\n\n**mboard.exe – System Information Plugin**\n\n**Packed SHA256:**\n50281cdd1b22f2b85de5809bf69ebd10e399410f519e357c1cb941c5dc7c95e1\n\nThe last plugin seen in this framework was mboard.exe. It is written in Golang and is packed\nwith UPX. The purpose of this plugin is to gather various system information such as the\nfollowing:\n\nDrive information\nOutput of systeminfo command\nInstalled software\nOutput of ipconfig /all command\nOutput of net view command\nOutput of tasklist command\n\nThe collected is saved into multiple files with a “qr” extension appended. They are then sent\nto the C2 via abobe.exe. An example showing the running process list being sent to the C2 is\nshown in Figure 17.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n\n-----\n\n17: Running process list exfiltration\n\n**Appendix A (IOCs):**\n\n_SHA256 Hashes_\n9ce56e1403469fc74c8ff61dde4e83ad72597c66ce07bbae12fa70183687b32d\n8d7eb0b7251bc4a40ebc9142a59ed8af16fb11cf8168e76dca48a78d6d7e4595\n6bbd10ac20782542f40f78471c30c52f0619b91639840e60831dd665f9396365\na2e9d9a00e7e75ab1d5e96dd327a89b55608a0319461f2866aadada5bd50e728\ne3fb0ab2f3d11f12c11b3ee1e1781eaec5581def820afe7e01902f31ba9e1936\n4d0114b1292714a13d43a4c0de3ea4498fa752354ad4f5b73a8ba441af6064ae\n600e7cfeea0ef8bd23cf95602a6b873898aa51848909aad1a7e8d4c5403797af\n7d893d4f077e8e76a44a7830c5c3806dc956a6ef1a06c9f2dc33477c70f8cc9b\n50281cdd1b22f2b85de5809bf69ebd10e399410f519e357c1cb941c5dc7c95e1 C2 Domains\nconf[.]serviceupdateres[.]com upload[.]cloudsekurity[.]online abodeupdater[.]com qmails[.]org\nserviceupports[.]com thebangladeshtoday[.]net sundayobserver[.]net C2 IP Addresses\n5[.]135[.]199[.]0 89[.]33[.]246[.]99\n\nPosted In\n\nAdvanced Persistent Threats\nAnalysis\nBotnets\nIndicators of Compromise\nInteresting Research\nMalware\nReverse Engineering\nthreat analysis\n\n## Subscribe\n\n_Sign up now to receive the latest notifications and updates from NETSCOUT's ASERT._\n\n\n-----",
