When users open these documents and macros are\nenabled, the Emotet DLL will be downloaded and loaded into memory.\n\nOnce Emotet is loaded, the malware will sit quietly, waiting for instructions from a remote\ncommand and control server.\n\nEventually, the malware will steal victims' emails and contacts for use in future Emotet\n[campaigns or download additional payloads such as Cobalt Strike or other malware that](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-starts-dropping-cobalt-strike-again-for-faster-attacks/)\ncommonly leads to ransomware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Emotet has been considered the most distributed malware in the past, it has gradually\nslowed down, with its last spam operation seen in November 2022. However, even then, the\nspamming only lasted two weeks.\n\n## Emotet returns in 2023\n\nToday, cybersecurity firm [Cofense and the Emotet-tracking group Cryptolaemus warned that](https://cofense.com/blog/emotet-sending-malicious-emails-after-three-month-hiatus/)\nthe Emotet botnet had once again resumed sending emails.\n\n\"As of 1200UTC Ivan finally got E4 to send spam. We are seeing Red Dawn templates that\nare very large coming in at over 500MB. Currently seeing a decent flow of spam. Septet of\n[payload URLs and ugly macros,\" tweeted Cryptolaemus.](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1633099154623803394)\n\nCofense also confirmed to BleepingComputer that the spam campaign began at 7:00 AM ET,\nwith current volumes remaining low.\n\n\"The first email we saw was around 7am EST. Volume remains low at this time as they\ncontinue to rebuild and gather new credentials to leverage and address books to target,\"\nCofense told BleepingComputer.\n\nInstead of using reply-chain emails like in the previous campaign, the threat actors are\nutilizing emails that pretend to be invoices, as shown below.\n\n**Emotet phishing email**\n\n_Source: Cofense_\nAttached to these emails are ZIP archives containing inflated Word documents that are over\n500 MB in size. They are padded with unused data to make the files larger and harder for\nantivirus solutions to scan and detect them as malicious.\n\n\n-----\n\n[These Microsoft Word documents use Emotet s Red Dawn document template, prompting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malwares-new-red-dawn-attachment-is-just-as-dangerous/)\nusers to enable content on the document to see it correctly.\n\n**Malicious Microsoft Word document using the Red Dawn template**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThese documents contain a mess of macros that will download the Emotet loader as a DLL\nfrom compromised sites, many of which are hacked WordPress blogs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**A mess of malicious macros in an Emotet Word document**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nWhen downloaded, Emotet will be saved to a random-named folder under %LocalAppData%\nand launched using regsvr32.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Emotet loader launched by**\n\n**Regsvr32.exe**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nLike the Word document, the Emotet DLL has been also padded to be be 526MB to hinder\nthe ability to detect it as malicious by antivirus software.\n\n[This evasion technique shows success, as illustrated in a VirusTotal scan where the malware](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1c9be74d8f870d1218685a86a51ffb01d96524a742fe9f610eb07d9c345e3961)\nis only detected by one security vendor out of 64 engines, with that vendor only detecting it\nas 'Malware.SwollenFile'.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Large Emotet DLL to evade detection**\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nOnce running, the malware will run in the background, awaiting commands, which will likely\ninstall further payloads on the device\n\nThe payloads allow other threat actors to remotely access the device, which is then used to\nspread further in the compromised network.\n\nThese attacks commonly lead to data theft and full-blown ransomware attacks on breached\nnetworks.\n\nCofense says that they have not seen any additional payloads being dropped now, and the\nmalware is just collecting data for future spam campaigns.\n\n## Recent Microsoft changes save the day\n\nWhile Emotet is rebuilding its network, the current method may not have much success after\nrecent changes by Microsoft.\n\n[In July 2022, Microsoft finally disabled macros by default in Microsoft Office documents](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-starts-blocking-office-macros-by-default-once-again/)\ndownloaded from the Internet.\n\nDue to this change, users who open an Emotet document will be greeted with a message\nstating that the macros are disabled because the source of the file is not trusted.\n\n\n-----\n\nMacros disabled by default in Microsoft Office\n\n**_Source: BleepingComputer_**\n[ANALYGENCE senior vulnerability analyst, Will Dormann, told BleepingComputer that this](https://twitter.com/wdormann)\nchange also affects attachments saved from emails.\n\nFor most users receiving Emotet emails, this feature will likely protect them from mistakenly\nenabling macros unless they make a concerted effort to enable them.\n\nThis change has led other threat actors to move away from Word and Excel documents and\nabuse other file formats, [such as Microsoft OneNote, ISO images, and JS files.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-now-use-microsoft-onenote-attachments-to-spread-malware/)\n\nIt would not be surprising to see Emotet also move to different attachment types after this\ninitial campaign does not go as intended.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New IcedID variants shift from bank fraud to malware delivery](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-icedid-variants-shift-from-bank-fraud-to-malware-delivery/)\n\n[Emotet malware distributed as fake W-9 tax forms from the IRS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-distributed-as-fake-w-9-tax-forms-from-the-irs/)\n\n[Microsoft OneNote will block 120 dangerous file extensions](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-onenote-will-block-120-dangerous-file-extensions/)\n\n[Emotet malware now distributed in Microsoft OneNote files to evade defenses](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-now-distributed-in-microsoft-onenote-files-to-evade-defenses/)\n\n[FakeCalls Android malware returns with new ways to hide on phones](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fakecalls-android-malware-returns-with-new-ways-to-hide-on-phones/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
