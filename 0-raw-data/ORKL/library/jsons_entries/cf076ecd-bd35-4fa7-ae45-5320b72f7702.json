Metadata associated with the executable\n[(\"caddy.exe\") shows that the malware was compiled at 7:19 a.m. UTC, a little over two hours prior](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a294620543334a721a2ae8eaaf9680a0786f4b9a216d75b55cfd28f39e9430ea/details)\nto its deployment.\n\nCaddyWiper is notable for the fact that it doesn't share any similarities with previously discovered\n[wipers in Ukraine, including HermeticWiper (aka FoxBlade or KillDisk) and IsaacWiper (aka](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/new-wiper-malware-targeting-ukraine.html)\nLasainraw), the two of which have been deployed in systems belonging to government and\ncommercial entities.\n\n\n-----\n\n\"The ultimate goal of the attackers is the [same as with IsaacWiper and HermeticWiper: make the](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1503436420886712321)\nsystems unusable by erasing user data and partition information,\" Jean-Ian Boutin¸ head of threat\nresearch at ESET, told The Hacker News. \"All of the organizations targeted by the recent wiper\nattacks were either in the governmental or financial sector.\"\n\nUnlike CaddyWiper, both the HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper malware families are said to have\nbeen in development for months in advance before their release, with oldest known samples\ncompiled on December 28 and October 19, 2021, respectively.\n\nBut the newly discovered wiper shares one tactical overlap with HermeticWiper in that the malware,\nin one instance, was deployed via the Windows domain controller, indicating that the attackers had\ntaken control of the Active Directory server.\n\n\"Interestingly, CaddyWiper avoids destroying data on domain controllers,\" the company said. \"This\nis probably a way for the attackers to keep their access inside the organization while still disturbing\noperations.\"\n\nThe wiper is programmed to systematically destroy all files located in \"C:\\Users,\" before moving on\nto the next [drive letter and erasing the files until it reaches the \"Z\" drive, meaning CaddyWiper will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_letter_assignment)\nalso attempt to wipe any network mapped drive attached to the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\n\"The file destruction algorithm is composed of two stages: a first stage to overwrite files and another\nto destroy the physical disk layout and the partition tables along with it,\" Cisco Talos researchers\n[said in an analysis of the malware. \"Destroying the start of the files and the partitions tables is a](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/threat-advisory-caddywiper.html)\ncommon technique seen on other wipers, and its highly effective in preventing file recovery.\"\n\nMicrosoft, which has attributed the HermeticWiper attacks to a threat cluster tracked as DEV-0665,\nsaid the \"intended objective of these attacks is the disruption, degradation, and destruction of\ntargeted resources\" in the country.\n\nThe development also arrives as cybercriminals have opportunistically and increasingly capitalized\non the conflict to design phishing lures, including themes of humanitarian assistance and various\ntypes of fundraising, to deliver a variety of backdoors such as Remcos.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe global interest in the ongoing war in Ukraine makes it a convenient and effective news event\n[for cybercriminals to exploit,\" Cisco Talos researchers said. \"If a certain topic of lure is going to](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/ukraine-invasion-scams-malware.html)\nincrease the chances of a potential victim installing their payload, they will use it.\"\n\nBut it's not just Ukraine that's been at the receiving end of wiper attacks. Last week, cybersecurity\n[firm Trend Micro disclosed details of a .NET-based wiper called RURansom that has exclusively](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/c/new-ruransom-wiper-targets-russia.html)\ntargeted entities in Russia by encrypting the files with a randomly generated cryptographic key.\n\n\"The keys are unique for each encrypted file and are not stored anywhere, making the encryption\nirreversible and marking the malware as a wiper rather than a ransomware variant,\" the researchers\nnoted.\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
