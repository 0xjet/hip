Cloud customers\nused more than 68 million machine\nhours of CIS Hardened Images in 2017.\nOur cloud offerings have emerged\nas CIS’ fastest-growing and most\nimpactful product offering.\n\n\n###### 40[%]\n\n\n###### Welcome\n Message\n\nThis past year has been a year of\nunprecedented growth for CIS. Our\nrole as a global, independent leader\nin cybersecurity for public and private\norganizations was demonstrated\nwith expanded products and services\nacross all of our program areas. This\nexpansion enabled CIS to increase our\nimpact with best practice solutions for\nimproving cyber defense that enable\nan environment of increased trust in\ncyberspace.\n\n\nDuring 2017, the Multi-State\nInformation Sharing & Analysis\nCenter® (MS-ISAC®) added 522 new\nmembers to top the 1,800 mark.\nMS-ISAC membership organizations\nnow cover 70% of the U.S. population.\nAdditionally, the MS-ISAC ended 2017\nmonitoring 51 of the 56 U.S. States\nand Territories. Our partnerships\nwith state and local government\norganizations as well as the U.S.\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n(DHS) continue to grow stronger,\nresulting in increased depth and\nbreadth of the intelligence provided\nthrough the MS-ISAC monitoring,\ninformation sharing, and cyber\neducation missions.\n\nIn late 2017, CIS initiated work to\nhelp secure our nation’s elections\ninfrastructure in collaboration\nwith state and local elections\nofficials, federal agencies, vendors,\nacademia, and other nonprofit\norganizations. Development was\nbegun of a handbook identifying best\nsecurity practices for U.S. election\ninfrastructure security to be published\nin early 2018. In addition, working\nwith state elections officials and\nDHS, CIS initiated a pilot Elections\nInfrastructure Information Sharing\n& Analysis Center™ (EI-ISAC™) for\nelections officials and their technical\nteams.\n\n\n###### world-class innovations, support, and resources\n\n\nLast but not least, the CIS Controls\nVersion 6 remained a popular resource\nfor cyber defense, with 38,657\ndownloads in 2017 – and we plan to\nsurpass 100,000 total downloads in\nearly 2018. Development of the CIS\nControls Version 7 was initiated with\na planned release in early 2018.\n\n\nThe test of any organization is its\nability to have significant, measurable\nimpact and to remain relevant. CIS’\nstrong focus on our mission and\nmeeting the pressing cybersecurity\nneeds of the connected world fuels\nour commitment to produce worldclass innovations, support, and\nresources now and in the future.\n\n\n###### 522 New Members\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n**John M.

At CIS, we are firm believers that organizations must have an intimate knowledge of their infrastructure to know it. Consider it a form of “defensive intelligence” that focuses on internal knowledge of assets and vulnerabilities, instead of “threat intelligence” that focuses on adversaries. We realize that not every organization has the resources to stand up their own intelligence team and translate threat intel reports into defensives actions; that is why we’ve imbued our knowledge of adversaries and cyber defense into the CIS Critical Security Controls, a set of prioritized cybersecurity recommendations used by organizations worldwide to counter the most pervasive cybersecurity attacks. There are currently 20 CIS Controls, each of which is further divided into sub-controls. The CIS Controls provide the ultimate end-state organizations should seek to achieve as part of their cybersecurity efforts, while the sub-controls provide prescriptive actions organizations can take to achieve the goals. The CIS Controls cover many of the traditional areas ofwhat to protect and how best to protect ind the tools **In a world of clouds, mobile devices, BYOD, and so on, why does it matter to protect hardware? ... because data still resides still have a duty to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that data.cybersecurity, such as vulnerability management (Control 4) and malware defense (Control 8), as well as objectives that are often considered to be IT management activities. In this article, we’ll examine the importance of managing your hardware and software through Authorized and Unauthorized DevicesIn a world of clouds, mobile devices, BYOD, and so on, why does it matter to protect hardware? ... because data still resides have a duty to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that data. Therefore, we better know what is in our environment and how it is being stored, processed, and accessed. Your inventory of hardware assets should include not just a static list of assets, but also the ability to automatically detect new assets being connected to your environment, as somewhereCIS Control 1:somewhere, and we Inventory of, and we still .** well as the ability to deny those unapproved devices.There are two main reasons why you should care about maintaining an accurate inventory of hardware on your network. The first is the more classical justification in security: “I want to detect and correct when bad guys walk in and plug something into my infrastructure.” It might sound rather far-fetched to think that someone could just simply walk into your organization and plug in a device, but this has become a common part of many pentests for a reason – it works! Of course, you would hope that staff would be a little wary of an unknown and unaccounted device suddenly showing up, but what if that computer was just a small Raspberry Pi hidden in a universal power supply?If you haven’t heard of the companies that now produce pentesting tools masquerading as normal office technology, fire up your favorite browser and learn all the creative places people have stuftheir favorite pentesting operating system. Neat stufdefender’s perspective. The second reason an accurate hardware inventory matters: how can you protect something if you don’t know it’s there? In order to properly scan, fix, and secure all your assets, you need to have an accurate count of them. We’ve seen it happen all too often where a scanner was misconfigured or a single device was forgotten, leaving the door open for cyber criminals to wreak havoc. One of the classicf for a pen tester; a little more harrowing from a fed **Inventories can get complicated and it may not seem like a high pay off at first, but without knowing what to protect and how to keep rogue devices off your network, you’ll have a difficult time applying the other Controls and protecting your organization.stories about forgotten assets is the case of the university that was unable to find one of their server racks, only to discover, after physically following the Ethernet cable, that it had been walled over!
