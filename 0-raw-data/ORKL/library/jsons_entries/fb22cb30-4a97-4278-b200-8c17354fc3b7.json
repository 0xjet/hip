Over time, they formed a group that focused on distributing the banking\ntrojan and downloader called Dridex via phishing emails.\n\nAs cybergangs started to transition to highly profitable ransomware attacks, Evil Corp\nlaunched a ransomware operation called BitPaymer, which was delivered via the Dridex\nmalware in compromised corporate networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n[After being sanctioned by the US government in 2019, ransomware negotiation firms refused](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evil-corp-hackers-charged-for-stealing-over-100-million/)\nto facilitate ransom payments for Evil Corp ransomware attacks to avoid facing fines or legal\naction from the Treasury Department.\n\nEvil Corp began renaming their ransomware operations to different names such as\n[WastedLocker,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-wastedlocker-ransomware-distributed-via-fake-program-updates/) [Hades, and Phoenix to bypass these sanctions.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evil-corp-switches-to-hades-ransomware-to-evade-sanctions/)\n\n[The threat actors used Phoenix in an attack on insurance firm CNA.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/insurance-giant-cna-hit-by-new-phoenix-cryptolocker-ransomware/)\n\n## Evil Corp impersonates Payload Bin hacking group\n\nAfter [breaching the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, DC, and stealing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dc-police-confirms-cyberattack-after-ransomware-gang-leaks-data/)\n[unencrypted data, the Babuk gang said they were quitting ransomware encryption and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-quits-ransomware-encryption-focuses-on-data-theft-extortion/)\ninstead focus on data theft and extortion.\n\nAt the end of May, the Babuk data leak site had a design refresh where the ransomware\ngang rebranded as a new group called 'payload bin,' shown below.\n\n**Babuk Tor site turned into Payload Bin site**\n\n_Source:_ _[MalwareHunterTeam](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1399610423750627330)_\nOn Thursday, BleepingComputer found a new ransomware sample called PayloadBIN\n\n[[VirusTotal] that we immediately assumed was related to the rebranding of Babuk Locker.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/69775389eb0207fec3a3f5649a0ad9315856c810f595c086ac49d68cdbc1d136/detection)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen installed, the ransomware will append the .PAYLOADBIN extension to encrypted files,\nas shown below.\n\n**Files encrypted by PayloadBIN**\nFurthermore, the ransom note is named 'PAYLOADBIN-README.txt' and states that the\nvictim's \"networks is LOCKED with PAYLOADBIN ransomware.\"\n\n**PayloadBIN ransom note**\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter finding the sample, BleepingComputer thought Babuk was lying about their intentions to\nmove away from ransomware and rebranded to a new name.\n\n[However, after analyzing the new ransomware, both Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft and](https://twitter.com/fwosar) Michael\nGillespie of ID Ransomware confirmed that the ransomware is a rebranding of Evil Corp's\nprevious ransomware operations.\n\nLooks like EvilCorp is trying to pass off as Babuk this time. As Babuk releases their\nPayloadBin leak portal, EvilCorp rebrands WastedLocker once again as PayloadBin in\nan attempt to trick victims into violating OFAC regulations. Sample:\n[https://t.co/k669bbaNyV](https://t.co/k669bbaNyV)\n\n— Fabian Wosar (@fwosar) [June 5, 2021](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1401110845820747797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nWastedLocker -> Hades -> Phoenix -> PayloadBin, all same malware/group behind it.\nProbably a few in-between don't care to recall at the moment.\n\n[— Michael Gillespie (@demonslay335) June 5, 2021](https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1401256746887299075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nWhile discussing why they would have impersonated another cybercrime group, Wosar felt\nthat they saw and took an opportunity to impersonate a hacking group that is not sanctioned.\n\n\"Now they had a gang rebranding and just took the opportunity.\" - Fabian Wosar.\n\nAs the ransomware is now attributed to a sanctioned hacking group, most ransomware\nnegotiation firms will likely not help facilitate payments for victims affected by the PayloadBIN\nransomware.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
