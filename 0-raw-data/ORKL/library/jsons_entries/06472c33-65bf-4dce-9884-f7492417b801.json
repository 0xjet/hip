And if they are using it, it’s\ndefinitely not to simulate any sort of attack.\n\nCobalt Strike has become a very common second-stage payload for many malware campaigns across\nmany malware families. Access to this powerful and highly flexible tool has been limited by the\nproduct’s developers, but leaked versions have long spread across the internet. Additionally, there are\ntons of tutorials, education videos and other public documentation that can help newcomers\nunderstand how to effectively use it, lowering the bar for entry in the cybercrime world.\n\nThe cybercrime underground’s adoption of Cobalt Strike correlates with the rise in ransomware activity\nover the past few years, while also being tied to numerous other types of malware that either lead to\nransomware attacks, data exfiltration, or both. Despite all of the cybercriminal activity that can be\nlaunched with this pen testing tool, it can be difficult to figure out who is actually controlling a\nmalicious Cobalt Strike team server. Additionally, Cobalt Strike allows users to build “malleable”\ncommand and control, which allows for easy modifications of network signatures.\n\nDespite the obfuscation techniques, Intel 471 has collected a wealth of information on how the\ncybercrime underground has refashioned this security tool to its advantage. The following takes a\ndeeper look at which threat actor groups and malware families are dropping Cobalt Strike for postexploitation.\n\n## Trickbot\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Trickbot is on this list. Public reports of Trickbot operators dropping\n[Cobalt Strike go back to 2019 [1].](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware)\n\nWe recently observed Trickbot infections associated with a specific “gtag” — a tracking ID used by the\nmalware’s developers — directly dropping Cobalt Strike stagers that were code-signed by Sectigo.\n\nTrickbot operators using the “rob” gtag pushed a variety of Cobalt Strike stagers (http, https, x86, x64)\nthrough Trickbot’s download-and-execute capabilities (command 43). Each Cobalt Strike variant was\nfetched from the very same server (http[:]//107.173.49.118) and tried to connect to\nhttps[:]//olhnmn.com (http[:]//217.12.201.194) based on the preferred communication protocol. We\nnoticed that the Malleable-C2 profile was based off this public profile on Github:\n```\nhttps://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2/blob/master/jquery-c2.3.11.profile\n\n```\nOther researchers have also written about Cobalt Strike activity originating from TrickBot infections.\n[Walmart Global Tech [2] has published details from a ransomware operation involving Cobalt Strike](https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/trickbot-crews-new-cobaltstrike-loader-32c72b78e81c)\nleveraged by a group utilizing the Trickbot banking trojan. The watermark — a distinct number\nattached to the make and model of Cobalt Strike — observed in the payload is 1359593325.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Another security researcher has detailed in his blog [3] the phases that originated with an Emotet](https://www.sneakymonkey.net/2019/10/29/trickbot-analysis-part-ii/)\ninfection, a subsequent Trickbot install, plus the use of a series of plot-exploitation tools and\nframeworks that eventually took advantage of Cobalt Strike.\n\nAs an example, Cobalt Strike was loaded in an advanced stage of the operation detailed in the blog post\nabove. Our events registering Cobalt Strike as a download & execute were recorded right after Trickbot\nissued the modules that the malware fetches when initiating an infection. That may be an indicator that\ndifferent threat groups may be using the same tool, but leveraged different TTPs.\n\nAs a reference, the following table gathers the Cobalt Strike hashes collected by our tracking that were\noriginated with Trickbot “rob” gtag:\n\n**SAMPLE NAME** **SHA256**\n\ncrypt_run2.exe 246c91ac7955ba97cc3c1aaf7b35a1798b72d7a3f82dca445e2e401430697ceb\n\ncrypt_run1.exe c4b4eb963c91fb4e82b0fbe510c35212d1f59850de82b04b0916ffd0cf5ef2af\n\nhttps_444_x86.exe d67baca49193bd23451cca76ff7a08f79262bf17fb1d8eb7adaf7296dca77ad6\n\nhttps_444_x64.exe 12dd3add463863ab1f294f2038e5832ff5e0adf2a3ca28e42202a0705c6f3cec\n\nhttp_444_x86.exe 7c76a27f3f9af16b5f7872e4bb459f0d4860d295d60e5f88fdc0eec16972e093\n\nhttp_444_x64.exe 28c3f5bcedbea2c97d5baa8c12353d6c79ba0cb94512f322487dc166b54fdb27\n\nThe Cobalt Strike watermark that Intel 471 discovered from Trickbot payloads is 305419896.\n\nOther sources have also reported Cobalt Strike activity originating from the rob Trickbot infections. In\n[May 2021, The DFIR report [4] blogged their observations when discovering Cobalt Strike activity after](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/05/02/trickbot-brief-creds-and-beacons/)\nan intrusion that started with Trickbot.\n\nEven though the same gtag is behind both Cobalt Strike deployments, the configuration extracted from\nthe beacons completely differs from those observed in the DFIR Report article. This may suggest\nmultiple threat actors are performing post-infection activity that leads to ransomware and data\nexfiltration. It could also mean that the operators pay close attention to operational security and try to\navoid re-using infrastructure or methodologies across different attacks.\n\n## Hancitor\n\nThe actors behind Hancitor use Cobalt Strike, but this hasn’t always been the case. This threat actor\ngroup preferred to drop the Gozi ISFB trojan and Evil Pony credential harvester until mid-2019, when\nthe group replaced Gozi ISFB with Cobalt Strike. This switch serves as a signal of when the group may\nhave decided to pursue ransomware instead of account takeovers. As we will demonstrate later in this\nsection, the Cobalt Strike deployments from Hancitor payloads are strikingly similar. This leads us to\nbelieve one threat-actor group is managing these particular Cobalt Strike team servers, as well as the\ninfected machines.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group setting up the Cobalt Strike team servers related to Hancitor prefer to host their CS beacons\non hosts without a domain. The CS beacons will call home to the same set of IPs. Stagers are\ndownloaded from infrastructure set up via Yalishanda bulletproof hosting service.\n\nIt’s important to note that Hancitor only drops Cobalt Strike on machines that are connected to a\nWindows domain. When this condition isn’t met, Hancitor may drop SendSafe (a spambot), the\nOnliner IMAP checker, or the Ficker information stealer.\n\nStager distribution URLs (where Hancitor fetches CS stagers):\n```\nhttp://tren0[.]ru/0504.bin\nhttp://tren0[.]ru/0504s.bin\nhttp://pipopetfiu[.]ru/0104.bin\nhttp://s5iwc[.]ru/0804s.bin\nhttp://pipopetfiu[.]ru/0104s.bin\nhttp://clublifes[.]ru/2903.bin\nhttp://45des29[.]ru/1504s.bin\nhttp://bambinoska[.]ru/2104.bin\nhttp://g1smurt[.]ru/2303s.bin\nhttp://man70[.]ru/2204s.bin\nhttp://masaddrino[.]ru/1904.bin\nhttp://q17ar45[.]ru/3003s.bin\nhttp://gru77[.]ru/2704.bin\nhttp://derferper[.]ru/1204s.bin\nhttp://pirijinko[.]ru/1703s.bin\nhttp://qm30098[.]ru/1404.bin\nhttp://67xfjk[.]ru/0704.bin\n\n```\nStager download URLs (CS stagers fetch CS beacon from here):\n```\nhttp://185.172.129[.]132:80/jDEi\nhttp://192.95.16[.]245:80/OMkU\nhttp://37.1.211[.]126:80/tV9Y\nhttp://45.136.113[.]10:80/fk5V\nhttp://45.138.27[.]44:80/w9aK\nhttp://45.176.188[.]137:80/pFq5\nhttp://66.165.240[.]211:80/l9Jm\nhttp://74.121.191[.]2:80/wXY4\nhttp://74.50.60[.]96:80/9Wic\nhttp://80.92.205[.]9:80/CbKl\nhttp://82.117.252[.]78:80/zGi2\n\n```\nBeacon C2 URLs (Beacons check in here):\n```\nhttps://74.50.60[.]96/cx\nhttp://192.95.16[.]245/activity\nhttps://45.176.188[.]137/ptj\nhttps://45.136.113[.]10/dpixel\nhttp://80.92.205[.]9/cx\nhttps://80.92.205[.]9/updates.rss\nhttp://45.170.245[.]190/visit.js\nhttps://173.199.115[.]116/cm\nhttp://185.172.129[.]132/j.ad\nhttps://80.92.205[.]9/__utm.gif\n\n```\nThe public RSA key used by Hancitor team’s Cobalt Strike beacons doesn’t change often. The key we\nobserve in recent samples is:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nMIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCnOM3nXx 7HBhkbDd AwFrFisSunK999w2tM0uTpuuEiBalcJhcL QgQW\n\n## Qbot\n\n```\nWhile it has been around since 2007, the banking trojan Qbot (or Qakbot) is still being used by\ncybercriminals. Not only do the core components receive major updates every few months, but due to\nits modular design, the developers are able to push a variety of plug-ins to enhance the bot’s\ncapabilities. One of these plug-ins equips the bot with the tools to join the CobaltStrike trend.\n\nOur Qbot tracking has registered attempts to load these CobaltStrike loader binaries. The controller\ninstruction here differs from other families as the CobaltStrike loader is shipped to Qbot bots as a plugin. The download plug-in directive reveals the internal name given to the plug-in DLL by Qbot\ndevelopers: plugin_cobalt_power3.\n\nAn example of a plugin_cobalt_power3 collected from Qbot is available in the table below.\n\n**SHA256** **Controller**\n\ncd406baf24626545dc66102b593fdf70b1922d9497e95a92b1a2e5db277603e0\n\nhttps://saferem[.]com\n\nThe configuration extracted from the Qbot-related Cobalt Strike beacon doesn’t show any links to any\nother groups that we are aware of. Additionally, the CobaltStrike watermark from the beacon is\n**1580103814.**\n\nWhen comparing this activity to samples reported by other researchers, we observed different public\nmalleable-C2 profiles used, but commonalities in hosting infrastructure.\n\n## SystemBC\n\nSystemBC is malware leveraging socket secure internet protocol (SOCKS5) to hide malicious traffic and\nto evade detection. It includes download and execute functionalities and supports self-updates.\nCybersecurity firm Proofpoint published an extensive report in August 2019 about this malware family\n\n[[5].](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/systembc-christmas-july-socks5-malware-and-exploit-kits)\n\nSystemBC is often observed as one part of an extensive infection chain. Some targeted ransomware\noperators seem to use it to maintain a secondary backdoor channel into a breached network. We\nobserved SystemBC dropping Cobalt Strike during mid-to-late 2020 and early 2021. Let’s see an overall\nsummary of the SystemBC activity that leads to Cobalt Strike being dropped:\n\n\n-----\n\n**SystemBC controller** tcp[:]//80.85.84.79:4001\n\nActivity period Nov. 15, 2020 - Nov. 27, 2020\n\nNov 15 It downloaded a Cobalt Strike Beacon from:\n```\n              http[:]//activedirectorysearch.com:8000/beac_prx8.exe\n              Hash:\n              d5f3ba52e0b71e8367636d60b13722b184cc764be4af0226429fe2a656c6653c\n              Controller: https[:]//activedirectorysearch.com/api/beta/Users('\n              Watermark: 305419896\n\n```\nNov 24 It downloaded Cobalt Strike Beacon from:\n```\n              http[:]//activedirectorysearch.com:8000/beac_prx8.exe\n              Hash:\n              5e5e25a926e27bdd67ffcbace103dc5d0e0cdcf2f04c9fb17d92e3bb1a85086c\n              Controller: https[:]//activedirectorysearch.com/api/beta/Users(\n              Watermark: <unknown>\n\n```\nNov 27 It tried to download an unknown sample from:\n```\n              https[:]//activedirectorysearch.com/crypt_socks.exe\n\n```\nThe sample was not found.\n\nThis SystemBC controller was only active during that short period of time and only downloaded those\nsamples. We cannot link this IP to any known actor or infrastructure. Also, the controller configured in\nthose Cobalt Strike samples does not appear in any other sample we have in our collection.\n\nThe domain is still active and the server is up, but there is no trace to Cobalt Strike resources. The IP,\n212.47.228[.]134, which is the one hosting ‘activedirectorysearch[.]com’ responds with a ‘bad gateway’\nmessage, which means that it was an nginx reverse proxy and the endpoint is not connected anymore.\nThis IP is linked to several pieces of malware and has hosted a lot of malicious activity. By looking at all\ntraces in VirusTotal, we can see multiple domains and resources with traces to phishing attacks, APK\ndeployment, and more malicious activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SystemBC**\n**controller**\n\nActivity\nperiod\n\nNov. 29 Dec. 10\n\nDec. 10 Dec. 11\n\n\ntcp[:]//172.105.253.97:4001\n\nNov. 29, 2020 - Dec. 15, 2020\n\nIt downloaded a VBS script used for doing reconnaissance of Windows networks:\n```\nhttp[:]//172.105.253.97/systembc/exec.vbs\nHash:\ne86d3fd7a2ff1bc75d750b661dfd3ab357b611028abfbbedd4653b930160d6d2\n\n```\n**Summary: The script was an early stage reconnaissance tool aimed at adding a new**\nuser on the victim machine, making this user an administrator, enabling remote\ndesktop capability and collecting network information about the infected machine. The\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by the operator or operators of the\nVBScript tool suggested they might be operating undisclosed ransomware and using\nthe script at the initial compromise stage and to conduct reconnaissance in the system.\n\nThrough the course of our research, we identified 18 entities in Canada, Germany,\nIreland, Luxembourg, the U.K. and the U.S. where the script was deployed.\n\nIt downloaded Cobalt Strike Beacon from:\n```\nhttp[:]//172.105.253.97/coba.exe\nHash:\n45deabe9eb879879da56164dccbe7efa02f4943e691045fdee2531bd1e7ad8d3\nController:https://lsass.cloud/pixel\nWatermark: 0\n\n```\n\nDec. 15 It tried to download an unknown sample from:\n```\n        http[:]//172.105.253.97/all_xxx.exe\n        And also downloaded Cobalt Strike Loader from:\n        http[:]//172.105.253.97/artif_pp.exe\n        Hash:\n        6b3991d59e49312c4f6dc09ba900d4cff475598e6a190da340466313be48c4f3\n        Controller:\n        https[:]//lsass.cloud:443/1kxH\n\n```\nThe infrastructure used for this operation was shared between SystemBC and CobaltStrike. The IPs\nused in SystemBC and also for all CobaltStrike stages (beacon drop and controllers), including also the\ndomain ‘lsass.cloud’ - which resolved to 172.105.34.105, hosted by Linode.\n\n\n-----\n\nSomething interesting to notice here is that there are also some Cobalt Strike stager samples that\ndownload Beacon from the same IP/Domain but they are not directly dropped by SystemBC. This\ndemonstrates what other researchers have also found, that SystemBC is used as an alternative backdoor\ninto breached networks.\n```\nCobalt Strike stager: 575f230f54f769aa3a9ea3a5e76d64a8419501d16651fac0c0e2247f4a41e16e\nDownload URL:https[:]//lsass.cloud:443/2tsC\nCobalt Strike Beacon:5259695c25fa6cc27334d3c9d16a307f1762ca0aa3b0cc3e153f271b2df4e6c4\nController: \"https[:]//lsass.cloud/api/beta/Users('\n\n```\nUsing OSINT it’s possible to find some more CobaltStrike samples sharing this domain:\n```\nhttps[:]//lsass.cloud/pixel\nhttps[:]//lsass.cloud/g.pixel\nhttps[:]//lsass.cloud/dpixel\nhttps[:]//lsass.cloud/8Amv\nhttps[:]//lsass.cloud:443/1kxH\n\n## Smokeloader\n\n```\nCobalt Strike is most often selectively deployed on targets that meet a certain criteria. However, Intel\n471 found an instance where Cobalt Strike was haphazardly deployed across a range of infected\nsystems, alongside several other malware samples. This was most likely the work of a malware install\nservice, where threat actors can buy “loads” (installs) in bulk.\n\nThe nexus of this activity was an actor that maintains large botnets made up of a modular loader known\nas Smokeloader, which was revealed in 2011 and exists in resident and non-resident versions. Despite\nits age, Smokeloader still is used in the wild and received several code updates from its author,\n**Smokeldr. It includes a lot of features and accepts multiple modules. It is able to steal files, browser**\ndata and mine different cryptocurrencies. Among those features, it also can download and execute\nadditional payloads.\n\nThe typical payloads distributed by this threat actor are various stealers and RATs. However, on one\noccasion, Intel 471 uncovered a Cobalt Strike stager.\n\nThe controller which delivered the download command was:\n```\nh[tt]p://dsdett[.]com/upload/\n\n```\nThis Smokeloader controller was hosted by a bulletproof hoster known as CCweb (also known as\nFluxxy). The CS stager was downloaded from:\n```\nh[tt]p://persoonlijknab[.]com/putty.exe\n\n```\nCobalt Strike beacon was downloaded from:\n```\nh[tt]p://164.90.173[.]158:80/VYy4\n\n```\nand reported back to:\n```\nhttp://164.90.173[.]158/push\n\n```\nThis Cobalt Strike control server was hosted at Digital Ocean, and was found with a watermark of\n**1359593325.**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat this shows us is even lower-tier cybercriminals that are buying installs, rather than setting up\ntheir own dedicated infection campaigns are using Cobalt Strike\n\n## Bazar\n\nBazar is a loader and backdoor pair that emerged in April 2020. Also known as Baza, the backdoor\nallows its operators to execute commands, exfiltrate files and download additional malware onto an\ninfected system.\n\nIncidents of the Bazar backdoor downloading and executing Cobalt Strike have been documented in\nother previous reports.\n\nIn late March 2021, Intel 471’s automated tracking systems received commands to execute the\n[reconnaissance batch script below from two Bazar backdoor controllers: 3.89.160[.]167 and](https://intel471.com/glossary/reconnaissance)\n34.239.255[.]128. We believe that this stage precedes the deployment of Cobalt Strike on hosts deemed\nof interest to the operators. As such, it is also a precursor to data exfiltration and deployment of\nransomware performed by targeted ransomware operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n@echo off\necho General Info:\nsysteminfo\necho.\necho My Username:\nwhoami\necho.\necho Network Neighbourghoud:\nnet view /all\necho.\necho Domain Neighbourghoud:\nnet view /all /domain\necho.\necho Domain Trust:\nnltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\necho.\necho Installed Programs:\nreg query hklm\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall /v \"DisplayName\" /s\necho.\necho Installed Programs (wow64):\nreg query hklm\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall /v \"DisplayName\"\n/s\necho.\necho Installed Programs (current user):\nreg query hkcu\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall /v \"DisplayName\" /s\necho.\necho Installed Programs (current user, wow64):\nreg query hkcu\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall /v \"DisplayName\"\n/s\necho.\necho Process List:\ntasklist\n\n```\nIn early 2021, Bazar campaigns were distributing a Cobalt Strike loader variant instead of the\nconventional Bazar loader. The samples were signed and fully undetectable by antivirus engines on\nplatforms such as VirusTotal at the time of those campaigns. Below are some artifacts from samples of\nthis variant:\n```\nLoader URLs:\nhxxps://finderout[.]com:443/components/af.png\nhxxps://lionpick[.]com:443/image-directory/profile.jpg\nhxxps://hdhuge[.]com:443/files/remove.gif\nBeacon URLs:\nhxxps://finderout[.]com/mobile-ipad-home.css\nhxxps://lionpick[.]com:443/media.css\nhxxps://hdhuge[.]com:443/skin\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCobalt Strike is a powerful tool that’s being leveraged by people that shouldn’t be leveraging it at all: a\ngrowing number of cybercriminals. That said, not all deployments of Cobalt Strike are the same. As this\nblog has shown, some deployments demonstrate bad operational security by re-using infrastructure\nand not changing their malleable-C2 profiles. Additionally, some operators drop Cobalt Strike on many\ninfected systems, while others will only deploy the tool very selectively.\n\nCobalt Strike, while used by security practitioners to ultimately thwart cybercrime, is now a common\ntool in the arsenal of cybercriminals. For now, most threat actors are relying on open source methods\nfor deployment and configuration, but we expect cybercriminals to begin to innovate and develop new\ntactics that defenders will have to adapt to. We expect these innovations particularly from those\ncybercriminal groups that are using the tool in targeted ransomware attacks.\n\n[For more on what Intel 471 has observed, download our white paper.](https://go.intel471.com/cobalt-strike-toolkit-for-pentesters)\n\n1.
