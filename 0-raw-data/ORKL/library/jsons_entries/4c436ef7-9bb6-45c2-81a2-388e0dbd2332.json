The campaign, which we have named Operation LiberalFace,\ntargeted Japanese political entities; our investigation revealed that the members of a specific political party were of particular focus in this\n[campaign. ESET Research unmasked details about this campaign and the APT group behind it at the AVAR 2022 conference at the](https://aavar.org/cybersecurity-conference/index.php/behind-the-mirrorface-mask-lodeinfo-malware-interfering-with-japanese-elections/)\nbeginning of this month.\n\n**Key points of the blogpost:**\n\nAt the end of June 2022, MirrorFace launched a campaign, which we have named Operation LiberalFace, that targeted Japanese\npolitical entities.\nSpearphishing email messages containing the group’s flagship backdoor LODEINFO were sent to the targets.\nLODEINFO was used to deliver additional malware, exfiltrate the victim’s credentials, and steal the victim’s documents and emails.\nA previously undescribed credential stealer we have named MirrorStealer was used in Operation LiberalFace.\nESET Research performed an analysis of the post-compromise activities, which suggests that the observed actions were carried out in\na manual or semi-manual manner.\n[Details about this campaign were shared at the AVAR 2022 conference.](https://aavar.org/cybersecurity-conference/index.php/behind-the-mirrorface-mask-lodeinfo-malware-interfering-with-japanese-elections/)\n\nMirrorFace is a Chinese-speaking threat actor targeting companies and organizations based in Japan. While there is some speculation that\n[this threat actor might be related to APT10 (Macnica,](https://www.macnica.co.jp/business/security/manufacturers/files/mpressioncss_ta_report_2019_4_en.pdf) [Kaspersky), ESET is unable to attribute it to any known APT group. Therefore, we are](https://securelist.com/apt10-tracking-down-lodeinfo-2022-part-i/107742/)\ntracking it as a separate entity that we’ve named MirrorFace. In particular, MirrorFace and LODEINFO, its proprietary malware used\n[exclusively against targets in Japan, have been reported as targeting media, defense-related companies, think tanks, diplomatic](https://www.macnica.co.jp/business/security/manufacturers/files/mpressioncss_ta_report_2019_4_en.pdf)\norganizations, and academic institutions. The goal of MirrorFace is espionage and exfiltration of files of interest.\n\nWe attribute Operation LiberalFace to MirrorFace based on these indicators:\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, LODEINFO malware is exclusively used by MirrorFace.\nThe targets of Operation LiberalFace align with traditional MirrorFace targeting.\nA second-stage LODEINFO malware sample contacted a C&C server that we track internally as part of MirrorFace infrastructure.\n\nOne of the spearphishing emails sent in Operation LiberalFace posed as an official communication from the PR department of a specific\nJapanese political party, containing a request related to the House of Councillors elections, and was purportedly sent on behalf of a prominent\npolitician. All spearphishing emails contained a malicious attachment that upon execution deployed LODEINFO on the compromised\nmachine.\n\nAdditionally, we discovered that MirrorFace has used previously undocumented malware, which we have named MirrorStealer, to steal its\ntarget’s credentials. We believe this is the first time this malware has been publicly described.\n\nIn this blogpost, we cover the observed post-compromise activities, including the C&C commands sent to LODEINFO to carry out the actions.\nBased on certain activities performed on the affected machine, we think that the MirrorFace operator issued commands to LODEINFO in a\nmanual or semi-manual manner.\n\n## Initial access\n\n\n-----\n\no ace sta ted t e attac o Ju e 9, 0, d st but g spea p s g e a s t a a c ous attac e t to t e ta gets e subject o\nthe email was <redacted>SNS用動画 拡散のお願い (translation from Google Translate: [Important] <redacted> Request for spreading videos\nfor SNS). Figure 1 and Figure 2 show its content.\n\n_Figure 1. Original text of the email_\n\n_Figure 2. Translated version_\n\nPurporting to be a Japanese political party’s PR department, MirrorFace asked the recipients to distribute the attached videos on their own\nsocial media profiles (SNS – Social Network Service) to further strengthen the party’s PR and to secure victory in the House of Councillors.\nFurthermore, the email provides clear instructions on the videos’ publication strategy.\n\nSince the House of Councillors election was held on July 10, 2022, this email clearly indicates that MirrorFace sought the opportunity toth\nattack political entities. Also, specific content in the email indicates that members of a particular political party were targeted.\n\nMirrorFace also used another spearphishing email in the campaign, where the attachment was titled 【参考】220628<redacted>発・\n<redacted>選挙管理委員会宛文書（添書分）.exe (translation from Google Translate: [Reference] 220628 Documents from the Ministry of\n<redacted> to <redacted> election administration committee (appendix).exe). The attached decoy document (shown in Figure 3) references\nthe House of Councillors election as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Decoy document shown to the target_\n\nIn both cases, the emails contained malicious attachments in the form of self-extracting WinRAR archives with deceptive names\n<redacted>SNS用動画 拡散のお願い.exe (translation from Google Translate: <redacted> Request for spreading videos for SNS.exe) and\n【参考】220628<redacted>発・<redacted>選挙管理委員会宛文書（添書分）.exe (translation from Google Translate: [Reference] 220628\nDocuments from the Ministry of <redacted> to <redacted> election administration committee (appendix).exe) respectively.\n\nThese EXEs extract their archived content into the %TEMP% folder. In particular, four files are extracted:\n\nK7SysMon.exe, a benign application developed by K7 Computing Pvt Ltd vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking\nK7SysMn1.dll, a malicious loader\nK7SysMon.Exe.db, encrypted LODEINFO malware\nA decoy document\n\nThen, the decoy document is opened to deceive the target and to appear benign. As the last step, K7SysMon.exe is executed which loads\nthe malicious loader K7SysMn1.dll dropped alongside it. Finally, the loader reads the content of K7SysMon.Exe.db, decrypts it, and then\n[executes it. Note this approach was also observed by Kaspersky and described in their report.](https://securelist.com/apt10-tracking-down-lodeinfo-2022-part-i/107742/)\n\n## Toolset\n\n\n-----\n\nt s sect o, e desc be t e a a e o ace ut ed Ope at o be a ace\n\n### LODEINFO\n\nLODEINFO is a MirrorFace backdoor that is under continual development. JPCERT [reported about the first version of LODEINFO (v0.1.2),](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/02/malware-lodeinfo-targeting-japan.html)\nwhich appeared around December 2019; its functionality allows capturing screenshots, keylogging, killing processes, exfiltrating files, and\nexecuting additional files and commands. Since then, we have observed several changes introduced to each of its versions. For instance,\nversion 0.3.8 (which we first detected in June 2020) added the command ransom (which encrypts defined files and folders), and version 0.5.6\n(which we detected in July 2021) added the command config, which allows operators to modify its configuration stored in the registry. Besides\n[the JPCERT reporting mentioned above, a detailed analysis of the LODEINFO backdoor was also published earlier this year by Kaspersky.](https://securelist.com/apt10-tracking-down-lodeinfo-2022-part-ii/107745/)\n\nIn Operation LiberalFace, we observed MirrorFace operators utilizing both the regular LODEINFO and what we call the second-stage\nLODEINFO malware. The second-stage LODEINFO can be distinguished from the regular LODEINFO by looking at the overall functionality.\nIn particular, the second-stage LODEINFO accepts and runs PE binaries and shellcode outside of the implemented commands. Furthermore,\nthe second-stage LODEINFO can process the C&C command config, but the functionality for the command ransom is missing.\n\nFinally, the data received from the C&C server differs between the regular LODEINFO and the second-stage one. For the second-stage\nLODEINFO, the C&C server prepends random web page content to the actual data. See Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6 depicting the\nreceived data difference. Notice the prepended code snippet differs for every received data stream from the second-stage C&C.\n\n_Figure 4. Data received from the first-stage LODEINFO C&C_\n\n_Figure 5. Data received from the second-stage C&C_\n\n_Figure 6. Another data stream received from the second-stage C&C_\n\n### MirrorStealer\n\nMirrorStealer, internally named 31558_n.dll by MirrorFace, is a credential stealer. To the best of our knowledge, this malware has not been\npublicly described. In general, MirrorStealer steals credentials from various applications such as browsers and email clients. Interestingly, one\n[of the targeted applications is Becky!, an email client that is currently only available in Japan. All the stolen credentials are stored in](https://www.rimarts.co.jp/becky.htm)\n%TEMP%\\31558.txt and since MirrorStealer doesn’t have the capability to exfiltrate the stolen data, it depends on other malware to do it.\n\n## Post-compromise activities\n\nDuring our research, we were able to observe some of the commands that were issued to compromised computers.\n\n### Initial environment observation\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce LODEINFO was launched on the compromised machines and they had successfully connected to the C&C server, an operator started\nissuing commands (see Figure 7).\n\n_Figure 7. Initial environment observation by the MirrorFace operator via LODEINFO_\n\nFirst, the operator issued one of the LODEINFO commands, print, to capture the screen of the compromised machine. This was followed by\nanother command, ls, to see the content of the current folder in which LODEINFO resided (i.e., %TEMP%). Right after that, the operator\nutilized LODEINFO to obtain network information by running net view and net view /domain. The first command returns the list of computers\nconnected to the network, while the second returns the list of available domains.\n\n### Credential and browser cookie stealing\n\nHaving collected this basic information, the operator moved to the next phase (see Figure 8).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Flow of instructions sent to LODEINFO to deploy credential stealer, collect credentials and browser cookies, and exfiltrate them to the C&C server_\n\nThe operator issued the LODEINFO command send with the subcommand -memory to deliver MirrorStealer malware to the compromised\nmachine. The subcommand -memory was used to indicate to LODEINFO to keep MirrorStealer in its memory, meaning the MirrorStealer\nbinary was never dropped on disk. Subsequently, the command memory was issued. This command instructed LODEINFO to take\nMirrorStealer, inject it into the spawned cmd.exe process, and run it.\n\nOnce MirrorStealer had collected the credentials and stored them in %temp%\\31558.txt, the operator used LODEINFO to exfiltrate the\ncredentials.\n\nThe operator was interested in the victim’s browser cookies as well. However, MirrorStealer doesn’t possess the capability to collect those.\nTherefore, the operator exfiltrated the cookies manually via LODEINFO. First, the operator used the LODEINFO command dir to list the\ncontents of the folders %LocalAppData%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\ and %LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\. Then, the operator\ncopied all the identified cookie files into the %TEMP% folder. Next, the operator exfiltrated all the collected cookie files using the LODEINFO\ncommand recv. Finally, the operator deleted the copied cookie files from the %TEMP% folder in an attempt to remove the traces.\n\n### Document and email stealing\n\nIn the next step, the operator exfiltrated documents of various kinds as well as stored emails (see Figure 9).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Flow of the instructions sent to LODEINFO to exfiltrate files of interest_\n\nFor that, the operator first utilized LODEINFO to deliver the WinRAR archiver (rar.exe). Using rar.exe, the operator collected and archived\nfiles of interest that were modified after 2022-01-01 from the folders %USERPROFILE%\\ and C:\\$Recycle.Bin\\. The operator was interested\nin all such files with the extensions .doc*, .ppt*, .xls*, .jtd, .eml, .*xps, and .pdf.\n\nNotice that besides the common document types, MirrorFace was also interested in files with the .jtd extension. This represents documents of\n[the Japanese word processor Ichitaro developed by JustSystems.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichitaro_(word_processor))\n\n[Once the archive was created, the operator delivered the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) client from the PuTTY suite (pscp.exe) and then used](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)\nit to exfiltrate the just-created RAR archive to the server at 45.32.13[.]180. This IP address had not been observed in previous MirrorFace\nactivity and had not been used as a C&C server in any LODEINFO malware that we have observed. Right after the archive was exfiltrated,\nthe operator deleted rar.exe, pscp.exe, and the RAR archive to clean up the traces of the activity.\n\n### Deployment of second-stage LODEINFO\n\nThe last step we observed was delivering the second-stage LODEINFO (see Figure 10).\n\n_Figure 10. Flow of instructions sent to LODEINFO to deploy second-stage LODEINFO_\n\n\n-----\n\ne ope ato de e ed t e o o g b a es JS S d, JsSc p e e, a d c u t e 0 d to t e co p o sed ac e e o g a\nJsSchHlp.exe is a benign application signed by JUSTSYSTEMS CORPORATION (makers of the previously mentioned Japanese word\n[processor, Ichitaro). However, in this case the MirrorFace operator abused a known Microsoft digital signature verification issue and](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityAdvisories/2014/2915720)\nappended RC4 encrypted data to the JsSchHlp.exe digital signature. Because of the mentioned issue, Windows still considers the modified\nJsSchHlp.exe to be validly signed.\n\nJsSchHlp.exe is also susceptible to DLL side-loading. Therefore, upon execution, the planted JSESPR.dll is loaded (see Figure 11).\n\n_Figure 11. Execution flow of second-stage LODEINFO_\n\nJSESPR.dll is a malicious loader that reads the appended payload from JsSchHlp.exe, decrypts it, and runs it. The payload is the secondstage LODEINFO, and once running, the operator utilized the regular LODEINFO to set the persistence for the second-stage one. In\nparticular, the operator ran the reg.exe utility to add a value named JsSchHlp to the Run registry key holding the path to JsSchHlp.exe.\n\nHowever, it appears to us the operator didn’t manage to make the second-stage LODEINFO communicate properly with the C&C server.\nTherefore, any further steps of the operator utilizing the second-stage LODEINFO remain unknown to us.\n\n## Interesting observations\n\nDuring the investigation, we made a few interesting observations. One of them is that the operator made a few errors and typos when issuing\ncommands to LODEINFO. For example, the operator sent the string cmd /c dir “c:\\use\\” to LODEINFO, which most likely was supposed to be\ncmd /c dir “c:\\users\\”.\n\nThis suggests the operator is issuing commands to LODEINFO in a manual or semi-manual manner.\n\nOur next observation is that even though the operator performed a few cleanups to remove traces of the compromise, the operator forgot to\ndelete %temp%\\31558.txt – the log containing the stolen credentials. Thus, at least this trace remained on the compromised machine and it\nshows us that the operator was not thorough in the cleanup process.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMirrorFace continues to aim for high-value targets in Japan. In Operation LiberalFace, it specifically targeted political entities using the thenupcoming House of Councillors election to its advantage. More interestingly, our findings indicate MirrorFace particularly focused on the\nmembers of a specific political party.\n\nDuring the Operation LiberalFace investigation, we managed to uncover further MirrorFace TTPs, such as the deployment and utilization of\nadditional malware and tools to collect and exfiltrate valuable data from victims. Moreover, our investigation revealed that the MirrorFace\noperators are somewhat careless, leaving traces and making various mistakes.\n\n_For any inquiries about our research published on WeLiveSecurity, please contact us at_ _[threatintel@eset.com.](mailto:threatintel@eset.com?utm_source=welivesecurity.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=autotagging&utm_content=eset-research&utm_term=en)_\n_ESET Research also offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.
