The publication of a universal_\n_decryptor may help victims compromised prior to the shutdown. Wednesday, September 22,_\n2021 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [ransomware landscape is constantly evolving as threat actors react to law enforcement](https://www.secureworks.com/resources/rp-prevent-ransomware-attacks-ransomware-report-2021-vol1)\ninterest, excessive media scrutiny, or adverse public opinion. ‘Retirement’ claims or an\nunexplained and sudden disappearance often indicate that a threat group is rebranding,\nreorganizing, or tightening operational security. Ransomware campaigns are financially\ndriven, and the potential for profit incentivizes the threat actors to operate as long as\n[possible. As demonstrated by a shutdown of GOLD SOUTHFIELD operations and](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-southfield)\n[subsequent reemergence of a new REvil version, threat groups modify their tactics and](https://www.secureworks.com/research/revil-sodinokibi-ransomware)\nmalware as necessary to address and minimize risks to their operations.\n\n## REvil shutdown\n\nOn September 7, 2021, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers observed\nthat the ransom payment site and victim leak site for the GOLD SOUTHFIELD threat group’s\nREvil ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation had resumed responding to web requests\n[after abruptly going offline on July 13. On September 9, a newly created ‘REvil’ persona](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57826851)\nposted messages to the “exploit . in” underground forum explaining that the shutdown\noccurred because GOLD SOUTHFIELD spokesperson ‘UNKN’ (also known as Unknown)\n[may have been arrested and the clearnet ransom payment servers were compromised (see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearnet_(networking))\nFigure 1).\n\n_Figure 1. GOLD SOUTHFIELD spokesperson ‘REvil’ commenting on shutdown (translated_\n_from Russian). (Source:_ _[Bleeping Computer)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-is-back-in-full-attack-mode-and-leaking-data//)_\n\n## Reemergence with a new version\n\n[On September 9, CTU™ researchers identified a REvil sample on the VirusTotal analysis site](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ab0aa003d7238940cbdf7393677f968c4a252516de7f0699cd4654abd2e7ae83)\nthat appears to be a new version. However, it includes a version value of 2.06. REvil 2.06\nwas released in April. The latest known version as of the shutdown was REvil 2.08, which\nwas [uploaded to VirusTotal on July 10. Despite the 2.06 version value, the September](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6cc78078952e991ee591e9503aca12da1f7f4d3d9175298dc11f8efd5a199540)\n[sample has a compilation timestamp of “Sat Sep 04 10:16:49 2021,” which is almost two](https://0xc0decafe.com/malware-analyst-guide-to-pe-timestamps/)\n[months after the shutdown. While it is possible to timestomp a binary’s compilation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/)\ntimestamp, analysis of previous REvil samples indicates that GOLD SOUTHFIELD does not\nmodify this value. It is highly likely that the September sample is a new version.\n\nCTU analysis and the REvil persona’s posts suggest that GOLD SOUTHFIELD was forced to\nrestore the REvil codebase from a backup of version 2.06. Changes made in versions 2.07\nand 2.08 were reverted in the analyzed September 2021 sample. For example, the original\n\n\n-----\n\n2.06 version includes a function to terminate prohibited services that stored its strings in an\nunencoded state (see Figure 2).\n\n_Figure 2. Original REvil 2.06 use of unencoded strings. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nIn version 2.07, the malware author updated this and several other functions to store the\nstrings in an encoded state (see Figure 3). However, the September 2021 sample reverted to\nunencoded strings.\n\n_Figure 3. Implementation of encoded strings in REvil 2.07. (Source: Secureworks)_\nCTU analysis of the September 2021 sample revealed the following modifications that\ndistinguish it from previous versions:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Changes encrypted configuration storage location: Previous REvil binaries**\ncontained five sections. The text, rdata, data, and reloc sections were common across\nall versions. The fifth section was randomly named and contained the RC4-encrypted\nconfiguration structure (see Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4. Original configuration storage format with five portable executable sections._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe September 2021 sample omits the fifth section, and the encrypted configuration\nwas moved to the beginning of the existing data section (see Figure 5). The\nconfiguration remains RC4-encrypted, and the data structure still consists of the RC4\nkey, the CRC32 hash of the encrypted configuration, the length of the configuration,\nand the encrypted configuration.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Analyzed September 2021 sample’s configuration storage format with four_\n_portable executable sections. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Removes debug and prohibited region checks: Since its inception, REvil performed**\na pre-infection check to ensure that the compromised system did not reside within the\n[Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This validation was controlled by a ‘dbg’](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Commonwealth-of-Independent-States)\nelement contained within the REvil configuration. If the malware detected a CIS region\nand the dbg configuration element was set to false, REvil did not infect the system (see\nFigure 6). This behavior was one of several characteristics that suggested the threat\nactors likely reside within a CIS region.\n\n_Figure 6. Original code with debug and prohibited region checks. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nThis validation was removed in the September 2021 sample (see Figure 7) although\nthe dbg configuration element is still present in the configuration.\n\n_Figure 7. Analyzed September 2021 sample without debug and prohibited region_\n_checks. (Source: Secureworks)_\nAs of this publication, it is unclear why this validation was removed. The validation\nlikely protected the malware author, as infected systems within the CIS region could\nresult in unwanted attention from local authorities. It is possible that the malware author\n[removed this check in response to public reports that describe how organizations can](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/try-this-one-weird-trick-russian-hackers-hate/)\nleverage this feature to prevent ransomware infections. While the threat actors\nremoved this check from the code, they instituted restrictions on which types of\norganizations affiliates could target to accomplish the same goal of avoiding\norganizations in the CIS region.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Changes password and registry values for safe mode option: REvil 2.05**\nintroduced a safe mode option. This reboot feature set the current user’s password,\n[configured automatic logon, created RunOnce registry values to handle post-reboot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/user-profiles-and-logon/turn-on-automatic-logon)\noperations, and then rebooted the system. In the September 2021 sample, the current\nuser’s password was changed from ‘DTrump4ever’ to ‘U1k$NEIq3c6Q’. The RunOnce\nregistry values used for post-reboot operations were changed from ‘*AstraZeneca’ to\n‘*Ponyaz’ and from ‘*MarineLePen’ to ‘*b2I0uo’ (see Figure 8).\n\n_Figure 8. Updated safe mode registry values. (Source: Secureworks)_\n**Removes persistence: The persistence logic that resumes encryption if a victim**\nreboots the system during the encryption process was removed in the September 2021\nsample. The presence of persistence logic has been inconsistent across REvil\nversions.\n\n**Removes Network Discovery enablement: REvil 2.07 introduced functionality that**\n[attempted to enable Network Discovery by executing the following command via the](https://www.majorgeeks.com/content/page/how_to_turn_on_or_off_network_discovery.html)\n[WinExec function: netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=”Network Discovery” new](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-winexec)\nenable=Yes. It is possible that this functionality was not intentionally removed. If GOLD\nSOUTHFIELD restored the code from a version 2.06 backup, this feature had not yet\nbeen implemented.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Removes duplicate process termination functionality: Starting with version 1.03,**\nREvil implemented two redundant functions for process termination: a thread that\ncontinuously monitored for the creation of new “prohibited” processes, and an initial\none-time scan for running processes considered to be prohibited (see Figure 9).\nProhibited processes are defined in the ‘prc’ configuration element and are typically\nprocesses that could result in resource conflicts during the encryption process (e.g.,\nsql, firefox, winword). Both functions attempted to terminate detected prohibited\nprocesses.\n\n_Figure 9. Redundant process termination functions included in the original code._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe September 2021 sample does not contain the initial scan for prohibited process\ntermination. It only contains the more robust thread that continuously monitors for\nprohibited processes.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Removes C2 functionality: After REvil successfully encrypts a system, it has an**\noption to communicate basic details to one or more GOLD SOUTHFIELD command\nand control (C2) servers. If the ‘net’ configuration element is set to true, REvil sends\nencrypted data about the infected system, the malware’s encryption, and the malware\ninstance. CTU researchers refer to the encrypted data sent to the C2 servers as ‘stats’.\nFigure 10 shows an example of the stats data structure in its unencrypted form.\n\n_Figure 10. Example of the stats data structure in its unencrypted form. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nWhile the ‘net’ configuration element is present in the September 2021 sample, the C2\nlogic was removed. The ‘dmn’ configuration element that stored approximately 1,200\nC2 domains was also removed.\n\nIn the September 2021 sample, the stats data is only located within the ransom note\ndropped to disk during the file encryption process. The ransom note instructs the victim\nto submit the encrypted stats string to the ransom payment site to begin the ransom\npayment and data restoration process.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Discontinues clearnet ransom payment site: GOLD SOUTHFIELD traditionally**\nincluded both clearnet and Tor-based ransom payment domains in its ransom notes.\n[The first REvil clearnet domain was decryptor . top, which was suspended by its](https://twitter.com/dubstard/status/1219283006222929921)\nregistrar on January 20, 2020. GOLD SOUTHFIELD switched to decryptor . cc for\napproximately a year before switching to decoder . re on January 23, 2021. As of this\npublication, the decoder . re domain does not resolve to an IP address even though\nGOLD SOUTHFIELD’s infrastructure is online. The ransom note references a\n‘secondary website’ and does not include a clearnet domain (see Figure 11).\n\n_Figure 11. Ransom note without the clearnet ransom payment domain. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\n**Updates registry key and values: The registry key that stores encryption-related**\ninformation was changed from SOFTWARE\\BlackLivesMatter, which was introduced in\na beta version of REvil 2.04, to SOFTWARE\\XMT0qpW. The value names stored within\nthis key also changed, which is consistent with the author’s pattern of renaming registry\nvalues in each version. The value used to store the encrypted session private key was\nremoved, possibly to prevent unauthorized decryption of a victim’s files if the threat\nactor’s private keys are compromised. Table 1 defines the registry values in the\nSeptember 2021 sample.\n\n\nRegistry\nValue\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nJgC Threat actor’s public key in REvil’s configuration\n\nCsUQ Session public key\n\n5XB29 Session private key encrypted with the threat actor’s public key in\nREvil’s configuration\n\n6mna6tT Random extension generated at runtime and appended to encrypted\nfiles\n\nOKDigiPr Encrypted ‘stat’ JSON data structure that contains information about the\nsystem and the malware\n\n_Table 1. REvil registry values used to store encryption data in the analyzed September_\n_2021 sample._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Universal decryptor\n\n[On September 16, Bitdefender announced a universal decryption tool for REvil infections](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/bitdefender-offers-free-universal-decryptor-for-revil-sodinokibi-ransomware/)\nthat occurred prior to July 13. During CTU analysis, the tool successfully decrypted files\nencrypted by multiple REvil versions released prior to that date. This tool is not an offline\ndecryptor. The infected system must connect to the internet to download the appropriate\ndecryption key from Bitdefender’s servers. Connecting to the internet could expose the\ncompromised organization to unintended consequences such as new infections or data loss\nif additional malware is running on the infected system. Additionally, as of this publication\nBitdefender has not disclosed if telemetry is collected from the network traffic to the\ndecryption key server and how the vendor and law enforcement might use that information.\nCTU researchers highly recommend that organizations perform their own risk assessment\nbefore using this decryption tool.\n\nBitdefender’s collaboration with law enforcement on the universal decryptor and the REvil\nspokesperson’s claims that GOLD SOUTHFIELD’s infrastructure was compromised suggest\nthat law enforcement compromised the infrastructure and confiscated the threat group’s\nprivate keys. In response, GOLD SOUTHFIELD appears to be reducing its attack surface by\neliminating clearnet infrastructure and removing unnecessary features.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCTU researchers had hypothesized that GOLD SOUTHFIELD proactively shut down\noperations in response to the U.S. government’s [commitment to address the ransomware](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/09/politics/biden-putin-call-syria-ransomware/index.html)\n[threat following high-profile attacks on Colonial Pipeline,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_ransomware_attack) [JBS, and](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/business/jbs-cyberattack-11-million/index.html) [Kaseya. However, the](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3626703/the-kaseya-ransomware-attack-a-timeline.html)\nREvil spokesperson’s claims suggest that the shutdown was due to law enforcement actions\nagainst the threat group and its infrastructure. The reactivation of the group’s infrastructure,\nthe emergence of a new underground forum spokesperson, and evidence of active malware\ndevelopment indicate that GOLD SOUTHFIELD has resumed operations.\n\nRansomware attacks are often opportunistic. Threat actors search for systems that have lax\nsecurity and exposed vulnerabilities. Organizations should implement good security practices\nand controls to secure their environments. Removing initial access vectors can minimize the\nrisk of a ransomware attack. It is critical that organizations implement and routinely test a 32-1 backup strategy to ensure speedy recovery in the event of a successful ransomware\nattack.\n\n[Contact us to learn more about proactive steps.
