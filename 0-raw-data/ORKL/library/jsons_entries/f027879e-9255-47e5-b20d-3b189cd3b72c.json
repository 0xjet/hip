This campaign has been conducted by BlueAlpha, a Russian\nstate-sponsored threat activity group that overlaps with Gamaredon, a group operating out of\nSevastopol, working under the directive of the Russian Federal Security Service’s (FSB) Centre 18:\nCentre for Information Security (TsIB). BlueAlpha has been observed delivering malicious HTML\nsmuggling attachments through spearphishing to download and execute GammaDrop and GammaLoad\nmalware variants. BlueAlpha has leveraged Cloudflare Tunnels as part of its GammaDrop staging\ninfrastructure, allowing it to effectively evade traditional network detection mechanisms and further\ncomplicate efforts to identify and block its activities.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - BlueAlpha continues to target Ukrainian entities with spearphishing campaigns, leveraging HTML\nsmuggling attachments to deliver Visual Basic Script (VBScript)-based malware GammaLoad.\n\n  - BlueAlpha has recently started using Cloudflare Tunnels to conceal staging infrastructure used\nby GammaDrop, an [increasingly popular technique used by cybercriminal threat groups to](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/threat-actor-abuses-cloudflare-tunnels-deliver-rats)\ndeploy malware.\n\n  - BlueAlpha continues to use domain name system (DNS) fast-fluxing of GammaLoad\ncommand-and-control (C2) infrastructure to complicate tracking and disruption of C2\ncommunications to preserve access to compromised systems.\n\n  - This campaign has been ongoing since at least early 2024 and has remained largely consistent\nin its techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs), with only slight changes in tooling and\ninfrastructure.\n\n## Background\n\nBlueAlpha is a threat activity group that overlaps with the publicly reported groups Gamaredon,\nShuckworm, Hive0051, and UNC530. Since at least 2014, BlueAlpha has primarily targeted Ukrainian\ngovernment and military entities. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has [publicly attributed](https://ssu.gov.ua/uploads/files/DKIB/Technical%20report%20Armagedon.pdf)\nBlueAlpha to the “Office of the FSB of Russia in the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol\", an\nFSB special project focusing predominantly on Ukraine under the directive of Centre 18: Centre for\nInformation Security. BlueAlpha can be seen in Figure 1 depicting the organization of threat actors\nattributed to the FSB.\n\n1 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\nInsikt Group has observed, via recent malware sample submissions to Recorded Future Public Sandbox,\nBlueAlpha abusing Cloudflare Tunnels for GammaDrop staging infrastructure. These tunnels have been\nleveraged by malicious .lnk files to download and execute GammaDrop. Cloudflare offers this\n[tunneling service for free with the use of the TryCloudflare tool, which will allow anyone to create a](https://try.cloudflare.com/)\ntunnel using a randomly generated subdomain of trycloudflare[.]com and have all requests to that\nsubdomain proxied through the Cloudflare network to the web server running on that host. Cloudflare\nTunnels have been gaining momentum as a defense evasion technique due to their ease of setup and\nthe fact that they have no cost to the user in most cases. Security vendors have recently [reported the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/threat-actor-abuses-cloudflare-tunnels-deliver-rats)\nuse of Cloudflare Tunnels to deliver remote access trojans (RATs) such as AsyncRAT.\n\n#### Infection Chain\n\nA recent example of BlueAlpha using Cloudflare Tunnels for GammaDrop staging infrastructure was\nsubmitted to Recorded Future® Public Sandbox on August 16, 2024. This infection chain follows the\n\n2 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n3 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n4 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n5 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n6 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n7 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n8 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n9 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n10 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigations\n\n  - Implement email security solutions capable of inspecting and blocking HTML smuggling\ntechniques, particularly attachments with embedded JavaScript. Configure email gateways to\nflag files with suspicious HTML onerror or onmousemove events, which are commonly used for\nevasion.\n\n  - Deploy application control policies to restrict the execution of mshta.exe and block untrusted\n```\n   .lnk files from running. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions should monitor\n   mshta.exe activity and generate alerts for unusual command-line parameters associated with\n\n```\nexternal downloads.\n\n  - Establish network monitoring rules to flag and review traffic to TryCloudflare subdomains, as\nthese are increasingly leveraged malicious activities.\n\n  - Enable DoH traffic logging and implement monitoring policies to detect unauthorized DoH\nconnections, as these are used by GammaLoad to resolve C2 domains when DNS fails.\n\n11 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Assess suspicious email attachments with Recorded Future Malware Intelligence for instant\nanalysis to understand associated threats quickly. Upload suspicious files to Recorded Future\nPublic Sandbox for further analysis.\n\n  - Use Recorded Future [Threat Intelligence (TI),](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence) [Third-Party Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence)\nto monitor real-time output from Network Intelligence analytics to identify suspected targeted\nintrusion activity involving your organization or key vendors and partners.\n\n  - Monitor Insikt Group reporting for the latest threat actor tradecraft; tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs); targeting; and indicators of compromise (IoCs) to ensure you are informed of\nthe threat.\n\n## Outlook\n\nBlueAlpha is likely to continue refining evasion techniques by leveraging widely used, legitimate\nservices like Cloudflare, complicating detection for traditional security systems. Continued\nenhancements to HTML smuggling and DNS-based persistence will likely pose evolving challenges,\nespecially for organizations with limited threat detection capabilities. Preparedness against these\ntactics will be crucial for Ukrainian organizations as BlueAlpha’s campaign persists.\n\n12 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n## Appendix B — MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\n|Appendix B — MITRE ATT&CK Techniques|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tactic: Technique|ATT&CK Code|\n|Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment|T1566.001|\n|Execution: Visual Basic|T1059.005|\n|Execution: JavaScript|T1059.007|\n|Execution: Malicious File|T1204.002|\n|Persistence: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder|T1547.001|\n|Defense Evasion: HTML Smuggling|T1027.006|\n|Defense Evasion: Encrypted/Encoded File|T1027.013|\n|Command and Control: Web Protocols|T1071.001|\n|Command and Control: Fast Flux DNS|T1568.001|\n\n\n13 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix C — Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis\n\n\n14 CTA-RU-2024-1205 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Recorded Future reporting contains expressions of likelihood or probability consistent_\n_[with US Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203: Analytic Standards (published](https://irp.fas.org/dni/icd/icd-203.pdf)_\n_January 2, 2015).
