The group tends](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08080817/EB-YetiJuly2014-Public.pdf)_\n\n_to attack different companies with a strong focus on the energy and industrial sectors. Companies_\n\n_attacked by Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti are geographically distributed worldwide with a more obvious_\n\n_concentration in Europe and the US. In 2016-2017, the number of attacks on companies in Turkey_\n\n_increased significantly._\n\n_The main tactics of the group include sending phishing emails with malicious documents and infecting_\n\n_various servers. The group uses some of the infected servers for auxiliary purposes – to host tools and_\n\n_logs. Others are deliberately infected to use them in waterhole attacks in order to reach the group’s main_\n\n_targets._\n\n_[Recent activity of the group against US organizations was discussed in a US-CERT advisory, which linked](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)_\n\n_[the actor to the Russian government, as well as an advisory by the UK National Cyber Security Centre.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/alerts/hostile-state-actors-compromising-uk-organisations-focus-engineering-and-industrial-control)_\n\n_[This report by Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT presents information on identified servers that have been infected](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/)_\n\n_and used by the group. The report also includes the findings of an analysis of several webservers_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe table below shows the distribution of compromised servers (based on the language of website\n\ncontent and/or the origins of the company renting the server at the time of compromise) by\n\ncountries, attacked company types and the role of each server in the overall attack scheme.

In the process\n\nof analyzing infected servers, numerous websites and servers were identified that the attackers had\n\nscanned with various tools, such as nmap, dirsearch, sqlmap, etc. (tool descriptions are provided\n\nbelow).\n\nT able 2.

Even though the scanned\n\nservers do not necessarily look like potential final victims, it is likely that the attackers scanned\n\ndifferent resources to find a server that could be used to establish a foothold for hosting the\n\nattackers’ tools and, subsequently, to develop the attack.\n\nPart of the sites scanned may have been of interest to the attackers as candidates for hosting\n\nwaterhole resources.\n\nIn some cases, the domains scanned were hosted on the same server; sometimes the attackers went\n\nthrough the list of possible domains matching a given IP.\n\nIn most cases, multiple attempts to compromise a specific target were not identified – with the\n\npossible exception of sites on the Bump platform, flight tracker servers and servers of a Turkish hotel\n\nchain.\n\nCuriously, the sites scanned included a web developer’s website, kashey.ru, and resources links to\n\nwhich were found on this site. These may have been links to resources developed by the site’s owner:\n\n[www.esodedi.ru, www.i-stroy.ru, www.saledoor.ru](http://www.esodedi.ru)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Utilities\n\nUtilities found on compromised servers are open-source and publicly available on GitHub:\n\nNmap – an open-source utility for analyzing the network and verifying its security.\n\n[Dirsearch — a simple command-line tool for brute forcing (performing exhaustive searches of)](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch)\n\ndirectories and files on websites.\n\n[Sqlmap — an open-source penetration testing tool, which automates the process of identifying](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap)\n\nand exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities and taking over database servers.\n\n[Sublist3r — a tool written in Python designed to enumerate website subdomains. The tool uses](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r)\n\n[open-source intelligence (OSINT](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSINT) ). Sublist3r supports many different search engines, such as\n\nGoogle, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and Ask, as well as such services as Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd,\n\nDNSdumpster and ReverseDNS. The tool helps penetration testers to collect information on the\n\nsubdomains of the domain they are researching.\n\n[Wpscan — a WordPress vulnerability scanner that uses the blackbox principle, i.e., works without](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan)\n\naccess to the source code. It can be used to scan remote WordPress sites in search of security\n\nissues.\n\n[Impacket — a toolset for working with various network protocols, which is required by SMBTrap.](https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket)\n\n[SMBTrap — a tool for logging data received over the SMB protocol (user IP address, user name,](https://github.com/CylanceSPEAR/SMBTrap)\n\ndomain name, password NTLM hash).\n\n[Commix — a vulnerability search and command injection and exploitation tool written in Python.](https://github.com/commixproject/commix)\n\n[Subbrute – a subdomain enumeration tool available for Python and Windows that uses an open](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute)\n\nname resolver as a proxy and does not send traffic to the target DNS server.\n\n[PHPMailer – a mail sending tool.](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer)\n\nIn addition, a custom Python script named ftpChecker.py was found on one of the servers.

The log is encrypted and is located at /var/tmp/.pipe.sock.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decrypted log at /var/tmp/.pipe.sock_\n\n## Activity of the attackers on compromised servers\n\nIn addition to using compromised servers to scan numerous resources, other attacker activity was\n\nalso identified.\n\nAfter gaining access to the server, the attackers installed the tools they needed at different times.\n\nSpecifically, the following commands for third-party installations were identified on one of the\n\nservers:\n\napt install traceroute\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, the attackers installed any packages and tools for Python they needed.\n\nThe diagram below shows times of illegitimate logons to one of the compromised servers during one\n\nmonth. The attackers checked the smbtrap log file on working days. In most cases, they logged on to\n\nthe server at roughly the same time of day, probably in the morning hours:\n\n_Times of illegitimate connections with the server (GMT+3)_\n\nIn addition, in the process of performing the analysis, an active process was identified that exploited\n\nSQL i j ti d ll t d d t f d t b f f th i ti\n\n\n-----\n\nThe findings of the analysis of compromised servers and the attackers’ activity on these servers are\n\nas follows:\n\n1. With rare exceptions, the group’s members get by with publicly available tools. The use of publicly\n\navailable utilities by the group to conduct its attacks renders the task of attack attribution\n\nwithout any additional group ‘markers’ very difficult.\n\n2. Potentially, any vulnerable server on the internet is of interest to the attackers when they want to\n\nestablish a foothold in order to develop further attacks against target facilities.\n\n3. In most cases that we have observed, the group performed tasks related to searching for\n\nvulnerabilities, gaining persistence on various hosts, and stealing authentication data.\n\n4. The diversity of victims may indicate the diversity of the attackers’ interests.\n\n5. It can be assumed with some degree of certainty that the group operates in the interests of or\n\ntakes orders from customers that are external to it, performing initial data collection, the theft of\n\nauthentication data and gaining persistence on resources that are suitable for the attack’s further\n\ndevelopment.\n\n## Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Filenames and Paths\n\n##### Tools*\n\n/usr/lib/libng/ftpChecker.py\n\n/usr/bin/nmap/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/dirsearch/\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/dirsearch/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/SMBTrap/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/commix/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/subbrute-master/\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/sqlmap/\n\n\n-----\n\n*Note that these tools can also be used by other threat actors.\n\n##### PHP files:\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/sma.php\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/theme.php\n\n/root/theme.php\n\n/usr/lib/libng/media.php\n\n##### Logs\n\n/var/tmp/.pipe.sock\n\n### PHP file hashes\n\nf3e3e25a822012023c6e81b206711865\n\nc76470e85b7f3da46539b40e5c552712\n\n155385cc19e3092765bcfed034b82ccb\n\n1644af9b6424e8f58f39c7fa5e76de51\n\n2292f5db385068e161ae277531b2e114\n\n7ec514bbdc6dd8f606f803d39af8883f\n\n78c31eff38fdb72ea3b1800ea917940f\n\n### Yara rules\n\nrule Backdoored_ssh {\n\nstrings:\n\n$a1 = “OpenSSH”\n\n\n-----\n\n}\n\n## Appendix II – Shell script to check a server for tools\n\n### Shell script for Debian\n\ncd /tmp\n\nworkdir=428c5fcf495396df04a459e317b70ca2\n\nmkdir $workdir\n\ncd $workdir\n\nfind / -type d -iname smbtrap > find-smbtrap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname dirsearch > find-dirsearch.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname nmap > find-nmap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname wpscan > find-wpscan.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname sublist3r > find-sublist3r.txt 2>/dev/null\n\ndpkg -l | grep -E \\(impacket\\|pcapy\\|nmap\\) > dpkg-grep.txt\n\ncp /var/lib/dpkg/info/openssh-server.md5sums . #retrieve initial hash for sshd\n\nmd5sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.md5sum #calculate actual hash for sshd\n\n### Shell script for Centos\n\ncd /tmp\n\nworkdir=428c5fcf495396df04a459e317b70ca2\n\nmkdir $workdir\n\ncd $workdir\n\nfind / -type d -iname smbtrap > find-smbtrap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname dirsearch > find-dirsearch.txt 2>/dev/null\n\n\n-----\n\nrpm -qa –dump | grep ssh > rpm-qa-dump.txt #retrieve initial hash for sshd\n\nsha256sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.sha256sum #calculate actual sha256 hash for sshd\n\nmd5sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.md5sum #calculate actual md5 hash for sshd\n\n[Ene rge t ic Be ar/Cro uching Ye t i: at t acks o n se rve rs](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/media/EB_public_FINAL_EN_20042018.pdf)\n\n[APT CRIMINAL](https://securelist.com/all?tag=657) [BACKDOOR](https://securelist.com/all?tag=568) [HACKERS ATTACKS](https://securelist.com/all?tag=480) [TARGETED ATTACK](https://securelist.com/all?tag=954)\n\n\nShare post on:\n\n\n[VULNERABILITIES AND EXPLOITS](https://securelist.com/all?tag=41) [WATERING HOLE ATTACKS](https://securelist.com/all?tag=810)\n\n### Related Posts\n\n###### APT Trends report Q1 Operation Parliament, 2018 who is doing what?\n\n LEAVE A REPLY\nYour email address will not be published.
