Attackers targeting Far Eastern\nInternational Bank (FEIB), a commercial firm in Taiwan, moved funds from its accounts to multiple overseas beneficiaries.\nIn a story which reminds us of the Bangladesh Bank case – the culprits had compromised the bank’s system connected to\nthe SWIFT network and used this to perform the transfers.\n\nIn recent days, various malware samples have been uploaded to malware repositories which appear to originate from the\nintrusion. These include both known Lazarus group tools, as well as a rare ransomware variant called ‘Hermes’ which may\nhave been used as a distraction or cover-up for the security team whilst the heist was occurring.\n\nThe timeline below provides an overview of the key events:\n\n\n01\nOctober\n2017\n\n03\nOctober\n2017\n\n03\nOctober\n2017\n\n04\nOctober\n2017\n\n06\nOctober\n2017\n\n06\nOctober\n2017\n\n12\nOctober\n2017\n\n\nMalware compiled containing admin credentials for the FEIB network.\n\nTransfers using MT103 messages were sent from FEIB to Cambodia, the US and Sri Lanka.\nMessages to cover the funds for the payments were incorrectly created and sent.\n\nBreach discovered and ransomware uploaded to online malware repository site.\n\nIndividual in Sri Lanka cashes out a reported Rs30m (~$195,000).\n\nIndividual returns to collect more cash from account, arrested whilst doing so.\n\nPress become aware of the incident.\n\nSamples uploaded which include known Lazarus malware.\n\n\nLittle information is available at present about when or how the attackers compromised the bank, but it is likely more details\nwill emerge in the coming weeks. This blogpost seeks to summarise what is in the public domain at the moment, as well as\nanalyse the samples uploaded to malware repositories.\n\n## ANALYSIS\n\n\n-----\n\n|#|MD5|Filenames|Submitted From|First Seen|Compile Time|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|9563e2f443c3b4e1b00f25be0a30d56e|FEIB_Samples_pwd(Virus).zi_|TW|2017- 10-12 02:50:16|N/A|\n|2|d08f1211fe0138134e822e31a47ec5d4|bitsran.exe|TW|2017- 10-03 01:01:31|2017- 10-01 15:37:31|\n|3|b27881f59c8d8cc529fa80a58709db36|RSW7B37.tmp|-|2017- 10-03 01:01:37|2017- 10-01 11:34:07|\n|4|3c9e71400b72cc0213c9c3e4ab4df9df|msmpeng.exe|US|2017- 10-07 08:58:00|2017- 02-20 11:09:30|\n|5|0edbad9e6041d43f97c7369439a40138|FileTokenBroker.dll|TW|2017- 10-12 02:50:15|2017- 01-05 01:11:33|\n|6|97aaf130cfa251e5207ea74b2558293d|splwow32.exe|TW|2017- 10-12 02:50:15|2017- 02-20 11:09:30|\n|7|62217af0299d6e241778adb849fd2823|N/A|GB|2017- 10-08 03:32:47|2017- 09-21 09:27:43|\n|8|0dd7da89b7d1fe97e669f8b4156067c8|N/A|MY|2017- 03-14 02:13:01|2017- 03-06 17:32:58|\n|9|61075faba222f97d3367866793f0907b|N/A|MY|2017- 02-16 03:25:00|2017- 02-10 15:03:30|\n\n\nFile #1 is the ZIP file containing samples #2-6 inside. Samples #2-4 were also separately uploaded by users in Taiwan and\nthe US on the dates given above.\n\nSamples #7-9 are older versions of the Hermes ransomware.\n\n## Malware Analysis – Sample #2; Bitsran loader / spreader\n\nSample #2 is designed to run and spread a malicious payload on the victim's network. On execution, the malware places a\ncopy of itself into the location:\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\bitsran.exe\n\nNext, the file establishes a persistence mechanism with the registry key:\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware then enumerates all processes, searching for specific anti-virus processes and attempts to kill these using the\ncommand line tool taskkill.\n\nProcess Name Process Description\n\ntmbmsrv.exe Trend Micro Unauthorized Change Prevention Service\n\ntmccsf.exe Trend Micro OfficeScan Common Client Solution Framework\n\ncntaosmgr.exe Trend Micro OfficeScan Add-on Service Client Management Service\n\nntrtscan.exe Trend Micro OfficeScan NT RealTime Scan\n\npccntmon.exe Trend Micro OfficeScan Antivirus real-time scan monitor\n\ntmlisten.exe Trend Micro OfficeScan NT Listener\n\ntmpfw.exe Trend Micro OfficeScan NT Firewall\n\nNext, the process attempts to find an embedded ‘IMAGE’ resource with offset #110. If successful, this file is loaded into\nmemory. When manually extracting this file, it can be seen to represent a pixelated bitmap (BMP) file.\n\nHowever, further investigation reveals that the file is what is known\nas a ‘Polyglot’ file, whereby a file is contained within another file.\nUsing a HEX viewer, it is possible to see that this file also contains\na ZIP file (beginning at the ‘PK’ header), with the pixelated image\nabove referencing the bytes of the file to be RGB values.\n\n|Process Name|Process Description|\n|---|---|\n|tmbmsrv.exe|Trend Micro Unauthorized Change Prevention Service|\n|tmccsf.exe|Trend Micro OfficeScan Common Client Solution Framework|\n|cntaosmgr.exe|Trend Micro OfficeScan Add-on Service Client Management Service|\n|ntrtscan.exe|Trend Micro OfficeScan NT RealTime Scan|\n|pccntmon.exe|Trend Micro OfficeScan Antivirus real-time scan monitor|\n|tmlisten.exe|Trend Micro OfficeScan NT Listener|\n|tmpfw.exe|Trend Micro OfficeScan NT Firewall|\n\n\n-----\n\nbytes. When successfully decrypted, the file is saved into the same directory as the initial executable. This takes the\nfilename ‘RSWXXXX.tmp’, where ‘XXXX’ is randomly generated through the GetTempFileName function. Once written to\ndisk, this process is created through the CreateProcess function. Sample #3 (RSW7B37.tmp) is an example of this file.\n\nWhilst this additional payload is executing, the initial malware attempts to copy itself to other devices on the network. Two\nuser accounts are hardcoded into the malware, and are used to establish connections to the C$ SMB shares on Windows\ndevices. These are the accounts:\n\nAccount Name Account Password\n\nFEIB\\SPUSER14 #ED{REMOVED}\n\nFEIB\\scomadmin !it{REMOVED}\n\nBoth accounts clearly relate to FEIB, though we couldn’t confirm whether the credentials are valid or not. The SPUSER14\nmay be a Sharepoint user account whilst scomadmin likely corresponds to System Center Operations Manager admin –\nan account for managing machines in a data centre.\n\nInstead of enumerating all devices on the network, the malware iterates through a hardcoded list of 5357 IP addresses, in\nthe ranges:\n\n  - 10.49.*\n\n  - 10.50.*\n\n  - 10.51.*\n\n  - 10.59.*\n\nIt is assumed that previous reconnaissance was conducted by the actors on the internal network to identify active and\nresponding devices, as well as capturing admin credentials for the network.\n\nIf a device successfully responds to a SMB packet on port 445, the malware copies itself to the C$ network share using the\nprovided credentials, writing the file to the location:\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\bitsran.exe\n\nIf successful, a further command is executed using the same credentials, to create a scheduled task on the remote device\nwith the name ‘BITSRAN’. The full command executed is:\n\ncmd.exe /c schtasks /create /tn “BITSRAN” /tr /s /u /p /st 00:00 /et 23:59 /sc minute /mo\n1 /ru system /f\n\n## Malware Analysis – Sample #3, Dropped file / Hermes Ransomware\n\nThe dropped file is a variant of the Hermes ransomware.\n\nThe ransomware calls GetSystemDefaultLangID() to obtain language identifier for the system locale. It contains a list of\nthree system language codes: 0x0419 (Russian), 0x0422 (Ukrainian), and 0x0423 (Belarusian). However, it only checks\n\n|Account Name|Account Password|\n|---|---|\n|FEIB\\SPUSER14|#ED{REMOVED}|\n|FEIB\\scomadmin|!it{REMOVED}|\n\n\n-----\n\nvssadmin Delete Shadows /all\n/quiet\n\nFollowing that, it deletes all VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) backup files (which include System Restore files) and\norphaned shadows, by running commands below for the drives from C:, D:, E:, F:, G:, and H:\n\nvssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=%DRIVE% /on=%DRIVE% /maxsize=401MB vssadmin resize\nshadowstorage /for=%DRIVE% /on=%DRIVE% /maxsize=unbounded\n\n[The trick above is called \"pulling the carpet\" as it forces Windows to voluntarily dump all shadows due to lack of space.](http://backupchain.com/i/how-to-delete-all-vss-shadows-and-orphaned-shadows)\n\nThe ransomware then recursively deletes all backup files from the drives C:, D:, E:, F:, G:, and H:, having the following\nextensions:\n\n  - *.VHD\n\n  - *.bac\n\n  - *.bak\n\n  - *.wbcat\n\n  - *.bkf\n\n  - Backup*.*\n\n  - backup*.*\n\n  - *.set\n\n  - *.win\n\n  - *.dsk\n\nUsing Windows CryptoAPI platform, the malware creates an exchange key pair, and then exports the 2,048-bit public RSA\nkey into an external file called PUBLIC.\n\nThe ransomware then enumerates both local and network resources, and encrypts files using 2,048-bit RSA algorithm.\n\nEach encrypted directory will have a ransom note left in it:\n\nHERMES 2.1 RANSOMWARE radical edition\nAll your important files are encrypted\nYour files has been encrypted using RSA2048 algorithm with unique public-key stored on\nyour PC.\nThere is only one way to get your files back: contact with us, pay, and get decryptor\nsoftware.\nYou have \"UNIQUE_ID_DO_NOT_REMOVE\" file on your desktop also it duplicated in some\nfolders,\nits your unique idkey, attach it to letter when contact with us.

This malware was discovered on networks in Poland and Mexico, following a](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2017/02/lazarus-false-flag-malware.html)\nseries of watering-hole attacks.\n\nJust like before, the backdoor uses several transliterated Russian words to either indicate the state of its communication or\nissue backdoor commands:\n\nState/Command Translation from Russian Meaning\n\nNachalo beginning start communication session\n\nustanavlivat to set handshake state\n\npoluchit to receive receive data\n\npereslat to send send data\n\nderzhat to maintain maintain communication session\n\nvykhodit to exit exit communication session\n\nkliyent2podklyuchit client to connect client is ready to connect\n\nSample #6 (splwow32.exe) is the same backdoor, only it’s not packed.\n\nBoth sample #4 and #6 have the same time stamp: 20 February 2017, 11:09:30. It appears that sample #6 was actually\nobtained by packing sample #4 with Themida (potentially, to avoid detection), as code/data found in both samples is\nidentical.\n\nThe backdoor expects a command line parameter that specifies remote C&C address and port number. If it is executed\nwith no command-line parameters, it quits.\n\nThe specified command-line parameter is decrypted, using some basic character manipulations and applying XOR with 2\nkeys:\n\n0x517A4563 (“QzEc”)\n0x77506F66 (“wPof”)\n\nThe decrypted string is expected to delimit C&C address and port number with the “:” character. Multiple C&Cs can be\ndelimited with the “|” character.\n\nIf the backdoor finds no valid pair of C&C address and port number delimited with the “:” character, it quits.\n\nOtherwise, it starts polling the remote C&C for a remote task to execute. Each polling attempt starts from a state\n“Nachalo” (“start communication session”), with a 3 second delay between each attempt to connect to the C&C.\n\nEach connection attempt starts from a state called “kliyent2podklyuchit” (“client is ready to connect”).\n\nIf the backdoor fails to connect five times, or if it connects, but the task it receives is “vykhodit” (“exit communication\nsession”), then the backdoor will quit. Otherwise, it will execute the remote command, effectively giving the attackers full\ncontrol over the compromised system. After the execution, the polling cycle continues.\n\n|State/Command|Translation from Russian|Meaning|\n|---|---|---|\n|Nachalo|beginning|start communication session|\n|ustanavlivat|to set|handshake state|\n|poluchit|to receive|receive data|\n|pereslat|to send|send data|\n|derzhat|to maintain|maintain communication session|\n|vykhodit|to exit|exit communication session|\n|kliyent2podklyuchit|client to connect|client is ready to connect|\n\n\n-----\n\nFileTokenBroker.dll is a DLL, installed as a service under the svchost.exe (netsvcs) service host.\n\nOnce loaded as a service DLL, the DLL's export ServiceMain() is called. The DLL then constructs a file name that consists\nof the host process name, formatted as:\n\n%SYSTEM%\\en-US\\[HOST_PROCESS_NAME_NO_EXTENSION].dll.mui\n\nFor example, if the DLL is loaded into the address space of svchost.exe, the constructed filename will be:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\en-US\\svchost.dll.mui\n\nAnother possible name is:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\en-US\\netsvc.dll.mui\n\nThe DLL then reads this file, and decrypts it with a running XOR mask. Once decrypted, it further reads an RC4 key from it,\nand decrypts it with the RC4 algorithm.\n\nThe decrypted file will contain a hash, so the DLL checks the hash as well to make sure the integrity of the decrypted file is\nintact.\n\nA fully decrypted file is then parsed as a PE file, and loaded as a DLL.\n\nHence, FileTokenBroker.dll decrypts and executes a payload that is created by an external dropper or is implanted\nby the attackers.\n\nThe %SYSTEM%\\en-US directory will have multiple system files in it, so it is chosen to blend the encrypted payload file with\nthe other legitimate system files. Unlike other *.dll.mui files in %SYSTEM%\\en-US directory that are MZ files, the\nencrypted payload is not an MZ file.\n\n## Malware Analysis – Samples #7, #8, and #9, Further Hermes malware\n\nSamples #7, #8, and #9 relate to previous instances of Hermes ransomware.\n\nMalware of this category is typically widespread, but in the case of Hermes it seems relatively rare. This is suspicious in\nitself and reminds us of WannaCry – another rarely observed ransomware. Further analysis is on-going to understand the\nhistory of this malware variant.\n\n## Transactions\n\nThrough working with trusted partners, we have been able to get insight into the transactions made as part of the heist. The\ntransactions consisted of two common SWIFT message types, MT103 and MT202COV.\n\n**MT103 messages are used for normal, cross border, cash transfers which would typically request funds be transferred into**\na personal or company beneficiary account. MT103 messages can be used on their own, or can be coupled with a cover\nmessage; MT202COV is used to order the movement of funds to the beneficiary institution via another financial\ninstitution/Intermediary Bank.\n\n\n-----\n\nthe values in specific fields were wrong. As a result, they were received by the intermediary bank but had no further\ninfluence on the funds transferred to the beneficiary accounts.\n\nReports of $60M being stolen appear to be due to confusion over these latter messages, and the amounts actually stolen\nwere considerably lower. Most of these appear to have been recovered.\n\nFurther details of the destination accounts within Sri Lanka have emerged in open source. The money had been transferred\n[to the Bank of Ceylon in Sri Lanka on 3 October. The following day, an individual in Sri Lanka allegedly withdrew RS 30m](https://visitsrilanka.com/news/hack-on-taiwanese-bank-sri-lankan-suspect-arrested-another-in-hiding-newsfirst/)\n(about $195K). Two days after that, the same individual returned to withdraw a further RS 8m, but was arrested when he\narrived at the bank. Sri Lankan police have since arrested another individual and a further suspect is wanted by Sri Lankan\nlaw enforcement.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nIt has been over a year since the last activity on a payments system from the attackers behind the infamous Bangladesh\nBank heist. Lazarus, the prime suspects, have been busy nonetheless – targeting Bitcoin in various ways, as well as other\nintrusions into banks such as in Poland and Mexico (albeit without evidence of targeting payment systems). In one of these\n[cases we and other researchers were able to observe infrastructure in North Korea controlling the malware – further clues](https://securelist.com/lazarus-under-the-hood/77908/)\nas to the origins of these attackers.\n\nThe attack this month on Taiwanese Far Eastern International Bank has some of the hallmarks of the Lazarus group:\n\n  - Destination beneficiary accounts in Sri Lanka and Cambodia – both countries have been used previously as\ndestinations for Lazarus’ bank heist activity;\n\n  - Use of malware previously seen in Lazarus’ Poland and Mexico bank attacks. Where these files were found and\nthe context of their use needs to be confirmed, but could provide a crucial attributive link;\n\n   - Use of unusual ransomware, potentially as a distraction.\n\nDespite their continued success in getting onto payment systems in banks, the Lazarus group still struggle getting the cash\nin the end, with payments being reversed soon after the attacks are uncovered. The group may be trying new tricks to\ndisrupt victims and delay their ability to respond – such as different message formats, and the deployment of ransomware\nacross the victim’s network as a smokescreen for their other activity. It’s likely they’ll continue their heist attempts against\nbanks in the coming months and we expect they will evolve their modus operandi to incorporate new ways of disrupting\nvictims (and possibly the wider community) from responding.\n\nMore work needs to be done to identify how FEIB was attacked, whether further custom tools were involved, confirm the\ncontext of the Lazarus malware in the intrusion, and where else this Hermes ransomware has been seen.\n\nAssuming Lazarus are indeed back to targeting bank payment systems, this will serve to emphasize the importance of\n[network hardening and controls frameworks being pushed by the industry at present.](https://www.swift.com/myswift/customer-security-programme-csp)\n\n## RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nSome general network hardening and monitoring lessons can be taken from this:\n\n   - Firewall off SMB (445) for internal computers. If access to this service is required, it should be permitted only for\nthose IP’s that require access. i.e. 445 is required for SCOM to push an agent install, therefore 445 should only be\nallowed from that source server;\n\n\n-----\n\npowershell.exe and similar;\n\n   - File Integrity Monitoring should be considered and configured to monitor file creations in “trusted” locations such\nas the System32 directory. This can also be used to monitor deletes, with an alert configured to fire on excessive\ndeletes in a row;\n\n  - Windows Security Event logs should be monitored to capture Scheduled Task creation events – Event ID 4698;\n\n   - Registry Auditing should be enabled and monitored to capture any additions to\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run;\n\n   - Excessive use of known administrative privilege accounts should be alerted on – specifically in a “one to many”\nbehavioural configuration. i.e. is one specific IP connecting to a large number of devices using the same credentials\nin a short period of time;\n\n  - Ensure privileged accounts have a complex password that does not include any part of the username, or\napplication it relates to.\n\nAdditional longer term recommendations for financial institutions:\n\n  - Practice incident response scenarios which include complex attacks combining covert payment fraud and overt\nnetwork disruption through ransomware, DDoS, network downtime, etc.\n\n   - Ensure that you are progressing towards being able to attest against the SWIFT 27 controls.\nFor more information see:\nhttp://www.baesystems.com/en/cybersecurity/swift-customer-security-programme\n\n## APPENDIX A – INDICATORS OF ATTACK\n\nMD5 Hashes d08f1211fe0138134e822e31a47ec5d4\n\nb27881f59c8d8cc529fa80a58709db36\n\n3c9e71400b72cc0213c9c3e4ab4df9df\n\n0edbad9e6041d43f97c7369439a40138\n\n97aaf130cfa251e5207ea74b2558293d\n\n62217af0299d6e241778adb849fd2823\n\n0dd7da89b7d1fe97e669f8b4156067c8\n\n61075faba222f97d3367866793f0907b\n\nFile / Process name bitsran.exe\n\n## APPENDIX B – YARA RULE\n\n|MD5 Hashes|d08f1211fe0138134e822e31a47ec5d4|\n|---|---|\n||b27881f59c8d8cc529fa80a58709db36|\n||3c9e71400b72cc0213c9c3e4ab4df9df|\n||0edbad9e6041d43f97c7369439a40138|\n||97aaf130cfa251e5207ea74b2558293d|\n||62217af0299d6e241778adb849fd2823|\n||0dd7da89b7d1fe97e669f8b4156067c8|\n||61075faba222f97d3367866793f0907b|\n|File / Process name|bitsran.exe|\n\n\n-----\n\ndate = \"2017/10/11\"\nauthor = \"BAE\"\nhash = \"b27881f59c8d8cc529fa80a58709db36\"\n**strings:**\n$magic = { 4D 5A }\n//in both version 2.1 and sample in Feb\n$s1 = \"SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Nls\\\\Language\\\\\"\n$s2 = \"0419\"\n$s3 = \"0422\"\n$s4 = \"0423\"\n//in version 2.1 only\n$S1 = \"HERMES\"\n$S2 = \"vssadminn\"\n$S3 = \"finish work\"\n$S4 = \"testlib.dll\"\n$S5 = \"shadowstorageiet\"\n//maybe unique in the file\n$u1 = \"ALKnvfoi4tbmiom3t40iomfr0i3t4jmvri3tb4mvi3btv3rgt4t777\"\n$u2 = \"HERMES 2.1 TEST BUILD, press ok\"\n$u3 = \"hnKwtMcOadHwnXutKHqPvpgfysFXfAFTcaDHNdCnktA\" //RSA Key part\n**condition:**\n$magic at 0 and all of ($s*) and 3 of ($S*) and 1 of ($u*)\n}\n\n\n-----",
