This extensive operation is composed of a fullfledged marketing campaign, custom cryptocurrency-related applications and a new Remote\nAccess Tool (RAT) written from scratch.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe campaign includes: Domain registrations, websites, trojanized applications, fake social\n[media accounts and a new undetected remote access trojan that we have named](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/operation-electrorat-attacker-creates-fake-companies-to-drain-your-crypto-wallets/www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/klingon-rat-holding-on-for-dear-life/)\n**ElectroRAT. ElectroRAT is written in Golang and compiled to target multiple operating**\nsystems: Windows, Linux and MacOS.\n\nIt is rather common to see various information stealers trying to collect private keys to access\nvictims’ wallets. However, it is rare to see tools written from scratch and used to target\nmultiple operating systems for these purposes.\n\nThe attacker behind this operation has lured cryptocurrency users to download trojanized\napplications by promoting them in dedicated online forums and on social media. We estimate\nthis campaign has already infected thousands of victims—based on the number of unique\nvisitors to the pastebin pages used to locate the command and control servers.\n\n## The Operation\n\nThe attacker has created three different trojanized applications, each with a Windows, Linux\nand Mac version. The binaries are hosted on websites built specifically for this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese applications are directly related to cryptocurrency. _Jamm and_ _eTrade are_\ncryptocurrency trade management applications and “DaoPoker” is a cryptocurrency poker\napp. Figures 1 and 2 are the homepages of the “Jamm” and “eTrade” websites. Figure 3\nshows what the “eTrade” application looks like once it runs on an Ubuntu desktop.\n\n_Figure 1: “Kintum” homepage which hosts eTrade’s Windows, Linux and MacOS trojans_\n\n_Figure 2: “Jamm” homepage which hosts Jamm’s Windows, Linux and MacOS trojans_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: eTrade (Kintum) application on Ubuntu desktop_\n\nThese applications were promoted in cryptocurrency and blockchain-related forums such as\n[bitcointalk and](https://bitcointalk.org/) [SteemCoinPan. The promotional posts, published by fake users, tempted](https://www.steemcoinpan.com/)\nreaders to browse the applications’ web pages, where they could download the application\nwithout knowing they were actually installing malware.Figures 4 and 5 are examples of the\npromotions posted in these forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 4: The user “anri.rixardinh” posting in a Chinese Hive forum in PeakD promoting](https://peakd.com/c/hive-105017/)_\n_“eTrade” application_\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 5: “Jamm” application promoted in bitcointalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/)_\n\nThe attacker went the extra mile to create Twitter and Telegram personas for the “DaoPoker”\napplication, in addition to paying a social media influencer for advertisement. Figure 6 shows\nthe DaoPoker Twitter page. Figure 7 shows eTrade promoted by a social media advertiser\nwith over 25K followers on Twitter.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: DaoPoker’s Twitter_ _[page](https://twitter.com/daopoker)_\n\n## Victims of the Operation\n\nAs part of its behavioral flow, ElectroRAT contacts raw pastebin pages to retrieve the C&C IP\naddress. The pastebin pages are published by the same user called “Execmac”. Browsing\nthe user’s page, we have more visibility into the number of victims subject to this campaign.\nIn Figure 8, we can see that the amount of unique visitors to the user’s pastes is\napproximately 6.5K [at the time of this writing]. We can also see the first pastebin pages were\nposted on January 8 2020, which indicates the operation has been active for at least a year.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: https[:]//pastebin[.]com/u/execmac pastebin page_\n\nWe also saw evidence of victims who were compromised by these applications commenting\non posts related to [MetaMask. See Figures 9 and 10.](https://metamask.io/)\n\n_Figure 9: A user commenting on a MetaMask Tweet_\n\n_Figure 10: A user alerting on DaoPoker_\n\n## Opening a Can of Stealers\n\nThe above-mentioned pastebin page reveals more insights. Other pastes published by the\n[same user contain C&Cs directly tied to Amadey and](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.amadey) [KPOT. These malware are stealers](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.kpot_stealer)\nmainly purchased on the Dark Web as off-the-shelf malware. ElectroRAT shares similar\n\n\n-----\n\nfunctionalities to these well-known trojans, however, it s written from scratch in Golang. We\nassume a reason for this is to target multiple operating systems, since Golang is incredibly\nefficient for multi-platform use. Writing the malware from scratch has also allowed the\ncampaign to fly under the radar for almost a year by evading all Antivirus detections.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n[Jamm, DaoPoker and eTrade were built using Electron, an app building platform. ElectroRAT](https://www.electronjs.org/)\nis embedded inside each application. Once a victim runs the application, an innocent GUI will\nopen, while ElectroRat runs hidden in the background as “mdworker”. Figure 3 above shows\neTrade app GUI upon runtime on an infected Ubuntu desktop machine. Figure 11 shows\nwhat the infection looks like behind the scenes using Intezer’s Cloud Workload Protection\nPlatform, Intezer Protect.\n\n_Figure 11: ElectroRAT alert in Intezer Protect_\n\nThe trojanized application and the ElectroRAT binaries are either low detected or completely\nundetected in VirusTotal at the time of this writing. Figure 12 shows the signed DaoPoker\napplication’s detection rate in VirusTotal.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: DaoPoker application in VirusTotal (2c35bfabc6f441a90c8cc584e834eb59)_\n\nElectroRAT is extremely intrusive. It has various capabilities such as keylogging, taking\nscreenshots, uploading files from disk, downloading files and executing commands on the\nvictim’s console. The malware has similar capabilities for its Windows, Linux and MacOS\nvariants.\n\nFor more technical information, browse the following Tweet:\n\n[1/7] Operation [#ElectroRAT is a new campaign that takes sizable measures to steal](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ElectroRAT?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[crypto wallets.

Use Intezer Protect to gain full runtime visibility over the code in](https://www.intezer.com/)\nyour Linux-based systems and get alerted on any malicious or unauthorized code. We have\na free community edition.\n\nFigure 10 above emphasizes an Intezer Protect alert on a compromised machine. The alert\nprovides you with full context about the malicious code including threat classification, binary’s\npath on the disk, process tree, command and hash.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Windows Machines\n\nRunning Intezer’s Endpoint Scanner will provide you with visibility into the type and origin of\nall binary code that resides in your machine’s memory. Figure 13 shows an example of an\nendpoint infected with ElectroRAT.\n\n_Figure 13: Endpoint infected with ElectroRAT_\n\n## Response\n\nIf you were, or suspect that you are a victim of this scam, take the following steps:\n\n1. Kill the process and delete all files related to the malware.\n2. Make sure your machine is clean and running 100% trusted code using Intezer’s tools\n\nmentioned above.\n3. Move your funds to a new wallet.\n4. Change all of your passwords.\n\n[You can also run this YARA rule against in-memory artifacts to detect ElectroRAT.](https://github.com/intezer/yara-rules/blob/master/ElectroRAT)\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nIt is very uncommon to see a RAT written from scratch and used to steal personal\ninformation from cryptocurrency users. It is even more rare to see such a wide-ranging and\ntargeted campaign that includes various components such as fake apps/websites and\nmarketing/promotional efforts via relevant forums and social media.\n\n\n-----\n\nElectroRAT is the latest example of attackers using Golang to develop multi-platform\n[malware.
