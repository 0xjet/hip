While evaluating this alert, Thomas Rid highlighted two](https://ridt.co/) [key passages:](https://twitter.com/RidT/status/1308522850454773762?s=20)\n\nand:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe central thesis of the document and the two highlighted passages above is that\nunderlying election integrity may be unaltered and safe, but communications about such\nactivity may be modified, obscured, or perverted for malicious purposes. As argued earlier\n[here, many types of critical infrastructure attacks need not produce a substantial disruptive](https://pylos.co/2019/08/13/kicked-while-down-critical-infrastructure-amplification-and-messaging-attacks/)\nevent – they only need to create a perception of unreliability or frailty to achieve significant\nimpacts. As outlined above, the US government is clearly adopting this perspective and\nincorporating it into their risk framework for likely impacts to the 2020 elections.\n\nUnder this scenario, a likely attack could take the following route:\n\n1. Anticipate a highly-contested, close election (which is almost certainly likely in the US).\n2. Disrupt or interdict legitimate media communication surrounding election results as\n\nthey are reported.\n3. Leverage this disruption to push a variety of false or misleading narratives to sow doubt\n\nand confusion.\n4. Once “regular” avenues of reporting are restored, sufficient doubt exists that election\n\nresults are called into question by a noticeable portion of the population.\n\nThis may seem far-fetched, but as Mr. Rid [pointed out in his book](https://twitter.com/RidT/status/1308523230957887488?s=20) [Active Measures, such a](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374287269)\n[scenario has in fact](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2014/0617/Ukraine-election-narrowly-avoided-wanton-destruction-from-hackers) [already manifested – in](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/technology/election-cyberattacks-pro-russia-hackers-have-been-accused-past-n673246) [Ukraine’s 2014 Presidential elections. In this](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-cyberwars-hottest-front-1447121671)\nscenario, election authorities were repeatedly disrupted, with attackers ultimately interdicting\nofficial election result announcements – which were subsequently amplified by Russian state\nmedia.\n\nIn this specific case, Ukrainain defenders (as they have proven multiple times over the past\ndecade) were up to the task in defending networks and rapidly restoring operations. But the\ndirection of this attack – disrupting not only election operations, but election communications\n– highlighted fault lines that exist not only in Ukraine but in every modern democracy.\nEssentially, disrupting the actual machinery of modern elections – with its various systems,\nphysical safeguards, and other checks – is quite hard. This is especially the case for a\ncountry as large and diverse as the United States, where there are essentially 50 separate\nauthorities running national elections.\n\nInstead of trying to either take the difficult route of modifying results or impacting individual\n[precincts and districts piecemeal, a shortcut exists which CyberBerkut realized in 2014:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberBerkut)\ntarget the transmission of results, rather than the results themselves. In hotly contested\n\n\n-----\n\nelections – such as Ukraine s 2014 election or the US s 2020 Presidential election –\naudiences will eagerly demand results on election night, logistics and practicalities be\ndamned.\n\nIn the case of federal entities such as the US, the combination of distributed election\n[authorities, tightly contested races, and the contingencies put into place due to COVID-19, a](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\nvery unique situation emerges. The following criteria likely hold for US elections in 2020:\n\nBallots will be cast in a variety of formats depending on jurisdiction due to the impact of\nCOVID-19, almost certainly resulting in a substantial increase in mail-in and absentee\nballots.\nCurrent law in nearly all jurisdictions prohibits counting mail-in and similar ballots\nbefore the actual federal election day.\nAssuming the contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden (along with multiple\nlegislative and other positions) is close, delayed ballot counting will play a substantial\nrole in deciding the outcome of elections.\nA populace generally attuned to knowing election results at the close of election day\nwill be uniquely susceptible to messaging around results (or manipulations thereof)\ngiven delays and other artifacts surrounding current circumstances.\n\nBased on these observations, the 2020 US election is an ideal opportunity for malicious\nactors to attempt various strategies to sow discord and dissent – not through modification or\nmanipulation of any election results, but rather through disinformation and messaging\nmodification.\n\nWhile such activity may not manifest itself as bluntly as CyberBerkut’s operations in Ukraine\nin 2014, the rough playbook from that event still holds. Only in this case, the electoral system\nin the US is already disrupted by events and the doubts generated by authorities (no less\nthan the President himself) and various media outlets. So all an attacker need do in this\nsituation is ensure a false or misleading narrative is published and disseminated widely in\nconjunction with “legitimate” results to sow significant discord and discontent in the US\nprocess. Given the already fraught nature of the current US election cycle, a mere “nudge”\ntowards chaos may produce outsized results.\n\nThe most alarming aspect of the above scenario is that there is almost nothing that can be\ndone to counteract it at this time. The surest means to combat disinformation – an educated,\nquestioning, and alert public – is something almost beyond recognition given that the US\npopulace is still unsure whether or not wearing masks might be a worthwhile consideration to\nslow the spread of COVID-19. When such relatively basic items meet such resistance, trying\nto convince individuals or groups that the narrative most sympathetic to their existing\nworldview may be false seems a daunting if not outright impossible task.\n\n\n-----\n\nUltimately, malicious entities need not compromise voter databases or election systems to\nsway or disrupt the US political process. A sustained, coordinated media campaign usurping\nalready-degraded mainstream channels could very well succeed in pushing narratives that a\nvocal minority of the US population will embrace, leading to significant post-election chaos.\nAnd given the state of matters within the US and its extreme polarization, there is probably\nalmost nothing that can be done to mitigate against this threat short of shutting down the\ninternet and muzzling the press.\n\nGiven the above, I am deeply concerned and honestly quite afraid of what November 2020\nwill bring as of this writing. The preconditions for slight “nudging” existing prejudices to\nfoment outright chaos or conflict already exist. Adversaries are not stupid, and have realized\nthis. The open question at this time is not whether such adversaries will try to sow chaos in\nthe US this year, but rather whether they understand US culture and divisions well enough to\nsucceed in doing so.\n\n\n-----",
