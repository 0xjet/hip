It spreads by\ntrying to compromise administrator passwords for Remote Desktop connections on a\nnetwork.\n\nWorms automatically spread to other PCs. They can do this in a number of ways, including\nby copying themselves to removable drives, network folders, or spreading through email.\n\n[Find out ways that malware can get on your PC](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/help/infection.aspx)\n\nAdditional information for Enterprise users\n\nIn the wild, we have observed this threat infecting computers by targeting accounts that have\nweak passwords.\n\nTo help prevent infection, and consequent reinfection, make sure that your organization uses\n[strong passwords for system and user accounts, and verifying that you do not use](http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx)\npasswords like those being used by the malware in order to spread. Changing your\n**password will significantly decrease your chance of re-infection.**\n\nTo thwart this and similar threats, it helps to adhere to best password practices, defined and\nenforced by appropriate policies. Good polices include, but are not limited to:\n\nEnsuring there are rules around password complexity, so that passwords meet basic\nstrong password requirements, such as minimum length (long passwords are usually\nstronger than short ones)\n\n\n-----\n\nEnsuring passwords are not used for extended periods of time; consider setting an\nexpiry every 30 to 90 days. You might also consider enforcing password history, so that\nusers can not re-use the same password within a pre-defined time frame\nEnsuring passwords contain a combination of:\n\nUppercase letters\nLowercase letters\nNumerals, and\nSymbols\n\nFor general information about password best practices, please see the following articles:\n\nTo help prevent re-infection after cleaning, you may also want to consider changing the\npassword for every account on the network, for every user in your environment.\n\nUse the following free Microsoft software to detect and remove this threat:\n\nYou should also run a full scan. A full scan might find hidden malware.\n\nDisable Autorun\n\nThis threat tries to use the Windows Autorun function to spread via removable drives, like\nUSB flash drives. You can disable Autorun to prevent worms from spreading:\n\n[Disable Windows Autorun](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715/)\n\nScan removable drives\n\nRemember to scan any removable or portable drives. If you have Microsoft security software,\nsee this topic on our software help page:\n\n[How do I scan a removable drive, such as a USB flash drive?](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mmpc/help/security-software.aspx)\n\nUse cloud protection\n\nThe [Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS) uses cloud protection to help guard against](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2015/01/14/maps-in-the-cloud-how-can-it-help-your-enterprise/)\nthe latest malware threats. It’s turned on by default for Microsoft Security Essentials and\nWindows Defender for Windows 10.\n\n[Check if MAPS is enabled on your PC](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2015/01/14/maps-in-the-cloud-how-can-it-help-your-enterprise/)\n\nGet more help\n\n[You can also see our advanced troubleshooting page for more help.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/help/troubleshooting-infection)\n\nIf you’re using Windows XP, see our [Windows XP end of support page.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/help/winxp-support)\n\n\n-----",
