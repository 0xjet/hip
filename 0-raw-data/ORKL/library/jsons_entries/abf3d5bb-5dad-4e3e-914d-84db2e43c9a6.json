    "plain_text": "# Fake Income Tax Application Targets Indian Taxpayers\n\n**[blog.cyble.com/2021/09/07/fake-income-tax-application-targets-indian-taxpayers/](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/09/07/fake-income-tax-application-targets-indian-taxpayers/)**\n\nSeptember 7, 2021\n\nIndian taxpayers are being targeted explicitly via mobile applications, phishing emails, and smishing,\nespecially during the pandemic. A variant of a mobile app that impersonates India’s Income Tax\nDepartment (IT) was first identified by the McAfee Threat Intelligence team\nin September 2021. These apps conduct phishing activities and collect sensitive information from\ntheir victims. The attacker could later sell this information on cybercrime forums.\n\nDuring our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a [Twitter post covering the](https://twitter.com/prashant_92/status/1434441034109382661)\napplication that masquerades as an official Income Tax department app. The app has a similar icon to that\nof the IT Department of India and is named iMobile.\n\nCyble Research Labs downloaded the malware samples and performed a detailed\nanalysis. We determined that the malware performs phishing activities to steal\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) such as date of birth, PAN number, Aadhaar number, bank account\ndetails, and debit card details, including expiry date, CVV number, and PIN.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### APK Metadata Information\n\nApp Name: iMobile\nPackage Name: direct.uujgiq.imobile\nSHA256 Hash: 1e8fba3c530c3cd7d72e208e25fbf704ad7699c0a6728ab1b290c645995ddd56\n\nFigure 1 shows the metadata information of the application.\n\n_Figure 1: Metadata Information_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Application Start Flow_\nWe have outlined the flow of the application and the various activities it conducts in Figure 2.\n\nThe application has a similar icon as the IT department of India’s official logo.\nThe application asks the users to allow it as defaults SMS app. Once it becomes the default app, it\ncan handle SMS data.\nThe application asks users to input credentials like PAN number and registered mobile number.\nThe application asks users to input bank account details including debit card information.\nThe application also asks for Internet Banking credentials.\n\nUpon simulating the application, it requests that users make it their default SMS app, and\nthen the application proceeds with its malicious activity. Refer to Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Asks for Default SMS_\n\n_App Permission_\nFigure 4 shows the malware pretending to be the official Income Tax app from India’s Income\nTax department. We can also see that the app is asking for credentials such as PAN number and mobile\nnumber.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Asks for IT_\n\n_Credentials_\nThe next page of the application directs users to a portal where they are prompted to enter their bank\naccount and debit card details. Refer to Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 Asks for User’s Banking Details_\n\nThe application also uses a fake internet banking login page and requests users to\nenter their credentials, as shown below.\n\n_Figure 6 Asks for_\n\n_Netbanking Credentials_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Manifest Description\n\n**iMobile requests twenty-six different permissions, of which the attackers could abuse seven. In this**\ncase, the malware can:\n\nCollect SMS data.\nRead the information of device such as usage history and statistics.\nReceive and send SMSs.\n\nWe have listed the dangerous permissions below.\n\n**Permissions** **Description**\n\nREAD_SMS Access phone’s messages.\n\nBROADCAST_STICKY Allow the application to communicate with other apps. These broadcasts\nhappen without the user’s knowledge.\n\nDISABLE_KEYGUARD Allows applications to disable the keyguard.\n\nPACKAGE_USAGE_STATS Provides access to device usage history and statistics.\n\nREAD_PHONE_STATE Allows access to phone state, including the current cellular network\ninformation, the phone number and the serial number of this phone, the\nstatus of any ongoing calls, and a list of any Phone Accounts registered\non the device.\n\nRECEIVE_SMS Allows an application to receive SMS messages.\n\nSEND_SMS Allows an application to send SMS messages.\n\n_Table 1: Permissions’ Description_\nUpon reviewing the code of the application, the launcher activity of the malicious app was identified, as\nshown in Figure 7.\n\n_Figure 7 Launching Activity_\nThe permissions and services defined in the manifest file that were identified have the ability to replace the\ndefault Messages app. This app will then be able to handle sending and receiving SMSs and MMSs. Refer\nto Figure 8.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 Handles SMS and MMS_\nFigure 9 represents that the malware has defined customized services that\nuse the BROADCAST_WAP_PUSH service. Through this service, an application can broadcast a\nnotification that a WAP Push message has been received.\n\n_Figure 9 Using Broadcast WAP Push Permission_\nThreat Actors (TAs) may abuse this service to create could false MMS message receipts or replace the\noriginal content with malicious content. Google has instructed that it is not for use by third-party\n**applications.**\n\nFigure 10 represents that the malware has defined customized services\nthat leverage the permission SEND_RESPOND_VIA_MESSAGE. This permits the application to send a\nrequest to other messaging apps to handle respond-via-message action during incoming calls.\n\n_Figure 10 Using Send Respond VIA Message_\n\n### Source Code Description\n\nThe application uses the permission that is defined in Figure 8 to send SMSs. Upon allowing the\napplication to replace the default messaging app, it can also read incoming messages. Refer to Figure 11.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 Sending SMS_\nThe below code shows one of the multiple deobfuscation method used by the malware, which leverages a\nsimple cipher substitution. All strings are decoded using distinct classes, with each class having a unique\ntable value. Refer to Figure 12.\n\n_Figure 12 Deobfuscation Method_\nDuring our traffic analysis, we observed that the malware is uploading the banking details,\nincluding account numbers and debit card details such as card number, expiry date, CVV, and PIN to\nthe Command and Control (C2) server hxxp://jsig.quicksytes[.]com/MC/NN180521/mc.php. Refer to\nFigure 13.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13 Banking Details Being Uploaded to the Server_\nFigure 14 demonstrates that the malware is uploading internet banking credentials to the server.\n\n_Figure 14 Internet Banking Details Uploaded to the Server_\nThe below image shows that the malware has hardcoded data, i.e., a mobile\nnumber originating from India.\n\n_Figure 15 Hardcoded Data_\n\n## Conclusion \n\nThe Threat Actors behind malicious applications constantly adapt and use various sophisticated techniques\nto avoid detection and target users. Such malicious applications\nmasquerade as legitimate applications to trick users into installing them.\n\nUsers should only install applications from the official Google Play Store to secure themselves from\nattacks such as these.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:\n\nDownload and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store.\n\n\n-----\n\nEnsure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.\nUsers should be careful of the permissions they are enabling.\nIf you find this malicious application on your device, uninstall, or delete it immediately.\nUse the shared IOCs to monitor and block the malware infection.\nKeep your anti-virus software updated to detect and remove malicious software.\n\nKeep your Android device, OS, and applications updated to the latest versions.\nUse strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n**Execution** [T1204.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002) User Execution: Malicious File\n\n**Defense Evasion** [T1418](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1418) Application Discovery\n\n**Credential Access** [T1412](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1412) Capture SMS Messages\n\n**Discovery** [T1087](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087) Account Discovery\n\n**Impact** [T1565](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/) Manipulation\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) \n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n**1e8fba3c530c3cd7d72e208e25fbf704ad7699c0a6728ab1b290c645995ddd56** SHA256 Malicious\nAPK\n\n**hxxp://jsig.quicksytes[.]com/MC/NN180521/mc.php** URL C2\n\n## About Us\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves from](https://cyble.com/)\ncybercrimes and exposure in the Darkweb.
