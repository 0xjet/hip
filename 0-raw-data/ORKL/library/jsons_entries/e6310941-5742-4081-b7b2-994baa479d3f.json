We assess this activity was carried out by a\nsuspected Iranian cyber espionage threat group, whom we refer to as APT34, using a\ncustom PowerShell backdoor to achieve its objectives.\n\nWe believe APT34 is involved in a long-term cyber espionage operation largely focused on\nreconnaissance efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state interests and has been operational\nsince at least 2014. This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of\nindustries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and\nhas largely focused its operations within the Middle East. We assess that APT34 works on\nbehalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to\nIran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.\n\nAPT34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools, often conducting spear phishing operations\nusing compromised accounts, sometimes coupled with social engineering tactics. In May\n2016, we published a blog detailing a spear phishing campaign targeting banks in the Middle\nEast region that used macro-enabled attachments to distribute POWBAT malware. We now\nattribute that campaign to APT34. In July 2017, we observed APT34 targeting a Middle East\norganization using a PowerShell-based backdoor that we call POWRUNER and a\ndownloader with domain generation algorithm functionality that we call BONDUPDATER,\nbased on strings within the malware. The backdoor was delivered via a malicious .rtf file that\n[exploited CVE-2017-0199.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/cve-2017-0199-hta-handler)\n\nIn this latest campaign, APT34 leveraged the recent Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-201711882 to deploy POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER.\n\n[The full report on APT34 is available to our MySIGHT customer community. APT34 loosely](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant/threat-intelligence/threat-intelligence-subscriptions.html%23dismiss-lightbox)\n[aligns with public reporting related to the group \"OilRig\". As individual organizations may](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-malware-campaign-updates-toolset-and-expands-targets/)\ntrack adversaries using varied data sets, it is possible that our classifications of activity may\nnot wholly align.\n\n**CVE-2017-11882: Microsoft Office Stack Memory Corruption Vulnerability**\n\nCVE-2017-11882 affects several versions of Microsoft Office and, when exploited, allows a\nremote user to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user as a result of improperly\nhandling objects in memory. The vulnerability was patched by Microsoft on Nov. 14, 2017. A\nfull proof of concept (POC) was publicly released a week later by the reporter of the\nvulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the old Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE), a component of\nMicrosoft Office that is used to insert and evaluate mathematical formulas. The Equation\nEditor is embedded in Office documents using object linking and embedding (OLE)\n\n\n-----\n\ntechnology. It is created as a separate process instead of child process of Office applications.\nIf a crafted formula is passed to the Equation Editor, it does not check the data length\nproperly while copying the data, which results in stack memory corruption. As the\nEQNEDT32.exe is compiled using an older compiler and does not support address space\nlayout randomization (ASLR), a technique that guards against the exploitation of memory\ncorruption vulnerabilities, the attacker can easily alter the flow of program execution.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAPT34 sent a malicious .rtf file (MD5: a0e6933f4e0497269620f44a083b2ed4) as an\nattachment in a malicious spear phishing email sent to the victim organization. The malicious\nfile exploits CVE-2017-11882, which corrupts the memory on the stack and then proceeds to\npush the malicious data to the stack. The malware then overwrites the function address with\nthe address of an existing instruction from EQNEDT32.EXE. The overwritten instruction\n(displayed in Figure 1) is used to call the “WinExec” function from kernel32.dll, as depicted in\nthe instruction at 00430c12, which calls the “WinExec” function.\n\n\n-----\n\nDisassembly of overwritten function address\n\n\nFigure 1: Disassembly of overwritten function address\nAfter exploitation, the ‘WinExec’ function is successfully called to create a child process,\n“mshta.exe”, in the context of current logged on user. The process “mshta.exe” downloads a\nmalicious script from hxxp://mumbai-m[.]site/b.txt and executes it, as seen in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacker data copied to corrupt stack buffer\n\n\nFigure 2: Attacker data copied to corrupt stack buffer\n\n**Execution Workflow**\n\nThe malicious script goes through a series of steps to successfully execute and ultimately\nestablish a connection to the command and control (C2) server. The full sequence of events\nstarting with the exploit document is illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nCVE-2017-11882 and POWRUNER attack sequence\n\n\nFigure 3: CVE-2017-11882 and POWRUNER attack sequence\n\n1. The malicious .rtf file exploits CVE-2017-11882.\n2. The malware overwrites the function address with an existing instruction from\n\nEQNEDT32.EXE.\n3. The malware creates a child process, “mshta.exe,” which downloads a file from:\n\nhxxp://mumbai-m[.]site/b.txt.\n4. b.txt contains a PowerShell command to download a dropper from: hxxp://dns\nupdate[.]club/v.txt. The PowerShell command also renames the downloaded file from\nv.txt to v.vbs and executes the script.\n5. The v.vbs script drops four components (hUpdateCheckers.base,\n\ndUpdateCheckers.base, cUpdateCheckers.bat, and GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs) to the\ndirectory: C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\Microsoft\\java\\\n\n\n-----\n\n6. v.vbs uses CertUtil.exe, a legitimate Microsoft command-line program installed as part\n\nof Certificate Services, to decode the base64-encoded files hUpdateCheckers.base\nand dUpdateCheckers.base, and drop hUpdateCheckers.ps1 and\ndUpdateCheckers.ps1 to the staging directory.\n7. cUpdateCheckers.bat is launched and creates a scheduled task for\n\nGoogleUpdateschecker.vbs persistence.\n8. GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs is executed after sleeping for five seconds.\n9. cUpdateCheckers.bat and *.base are deleted from the staging directory.\n\nFigure 4 contains an excerpt of the v.vbs script pertaining to the Execution Workflow section.\n\n\nExecution Workflow Section of v.vbs\n\n\nFigure 4: Execution Workflow Section of v.vbs\nAfter successful execution of the steps mentioned in the Execution Workflow section, the\nTask Scheduler will launch GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs every minute, which in turn executes\nthe dUpdateCheckers.ps1 and hUpdateCheckers.ps1 scripts. These PowerShell scripts are\n\n\n-----\n\nfinal stage payloads – they include a downloader with domain generation algorithm (DGA)\nfunctionality and the backdoor component, which connect to the C2 server to receive\ncommands and perform additional malicious activities.\n\n**hUpdateCheckers.ps1 (POWRUNER)**\n\nThe backdoor component, POWRUNER, is a PowerShell script that sends and receives\ncommands to and from the C2 server. POWRUNER is executed every minute by the Task\nScheduler. Figure 5 contains an excerpt of the POWRUNER backdoor.\n\n\nPOWRUNER PowerShell script hUpdateCheckers.ps1\n\n\nFigure 5: POWRUNER PowerShell script hUpdateCheckers.ps1\nPOWRUNER begins by sending a random GET request to the C2 server and waits for a\nresponse. The server will respond with either “not_now” or a random 11-digit number. If the\nresponse is a random number, POWRUNER will send another random GET request to the\nserver and store the response in a string. POWRUNER will then check the last digit of the\n\n\n-----\n\nstored random number response, interpret the value as a command, and perform an action\nbased on that command. The command values and the associated actions are described in\nTable 1.\n\nCommand Description Action\n\n\n0 Server response string contains\nbatch commands\n\n1 Server response string is a file\npath\n\n2 Server response string is a file\npath\n\nTable 1: POWRUNER commands\n\n\nExecute batch commands and send\nresults back to server\n\nCheck for file path and upload (PUT) the\nfile to server\n\nCheck for file path and download (GET)\nthe file\n\n\nAfter successfully executing the command, POWRUNER sends the results back to the C2\nserver and stops execution.\n\nThe C2 server can also send a PowerShell command to capture and store a screenshot of a\nvictim’s system. POWRUNER will send the captured screenshot image file to the C2 server if\nthe “fileupload” command is issued. Figure 6 shows the PowerShell “Get-Screenshot”\nfunction sent by the C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\nPowerShell Screenshot Functionality\n\n\nFigure 6: PowerShell Screenshot Functionality\n\n**dUpdateCheckers.ps1 (BONDUPDATER)**\n\nOne of the recent advancements by APT34 is the use of DGA to generate subdomains. The\nBONDUPDATER script, which was named based on the hard-coded string “B007”, uses a\ncustom DGA algorithm to generate subdomains for communication with the C2 server.\n\n**DGA Implementation**\n\nFigure 7 provides a breakdown of how an example domain\n(456341921300006B0C8B2CE9C9B007.mumbai-m[.]site) is generated using\nBONDUPDATER’s custom DGA.\n\n\n-----\n\nBreakdown of subdomain created by BONDUPDATER\n\n\nFigure 7: Breakdown of subdomain created by BONDUPDATER\n\n1. This is a randomly generated number created using the following expression: $rnd = \njoin (Get-Random -InputObject (10..99) -Count (%{ Get-Random -InputObject (1..6)}));\n2. This value is either 0 or 1. It is initially set to 0. If the first resolved domain IP address\n\nstarts with 24.125.X.X, then it is set to 1.\n3. Initially set to 000, then incremented by 3 after every DNS request\n4. First 12 characters of system UUID.\n5. “B007” hardcoded string.\n6. Hardcoded domain “mumbai-m[.]site”\n\nBONDUPDATER will attempt to resolve the resulting DGA domain and will take the following\nactions based on the IP address resolution:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Create a temporary file in %temp% location\n\nThe file created will have the last two octets of the resolved IP addresses as its\nfilename.\n2. BONDUPDATER will evaluate the last character of the file name and perform the\n\ncorresponding action found in Table 2.\n\nCharacter Description\n\n0 File contains batch commands, it executes the batch commands\n\n1 Rename the temporary file as .ps1 extension\n\n2 Rename the temporary file as .vbs extension\n\nTable 2: BONDUPDATER Actions\n\nFigure 8 is a screenshot of BONDUPDATER’s DGA implementation.\n\n\n-----\n\nDomain Generation Algorithm\n\n\nFigure 8: Domain Generation Algorithm\nSome examples of the generated subdomains observed at time of execution include:\n\n143610035BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site\n\n835710065BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site\n\n376110095BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site\n\n**Network Communication**\n\nFigure 9 shows example network communications between a POWRUNER backdoor client\nand server.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample Network Communication\n\n\nFigure 9: Example Network Communication\nIn the example, the POWRUNER client sends a random GET request to the C2 server and\nthe C2 server sends the random number (99999999990) as a response. As the response is\na random number that ends with ‘0’, POWRUNER sends another random GET request to\nreceive an additional command string. The C2 server sends back Base64 encoded\nresponse.\n\nIf the server had sent the string “not_now” as response, as shown in Figure 10, POWRUNER\nwould have ceased any further requests and terminated its execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample not now server response\n\n\nFigure 10: Example \"not now\" server response\n\n**Batch Commands**\n\nPOWRUNER may also receive batch commands from the C2 server to collect host\ninformation from the system. This may include information about the currently logged in user,\nthe hostname, network configuration data, active connections, process information, local and\ndomain administrator accounts, an enumeration of user directories, and other data. An\nexample batch command is provided in Figure 11.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Batch commands sent by POWRUNER C2 server\n\n\nFigure 11: Batch commands sent by POWRUNER C2 server\n\n**Additional Use of POWRUNER / BONDUPDATER**\n\nAPT34 has used POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER to target Middle East organizations as\nearly as July 2017. In July 2017, a FireEye Web MPS appliance detected and blocked a\nrequest to retrieve and install an APT34 POWRUNER / BONDUPDATER downloader file.\nDuring the same month, FireEye observed APT34 target a separate Middle East\norganization using a malicious .rtf file (MD5: 63D66D99E46FB93676A4F475A65566D8)that\nexploited CVE-2017-0199. This file issued a GET request to download a malicious file from:\n\nhxxp://94.23.172.164/dupdatechecker.doc.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs shown in Figure 12, the script within the dupatechecker.doc file attempts to download\nanother file named dupatechecker.exe from the same server. The file also contains a\ncomment by the malware author that appears to be an apparent taunt to security\nresearchers.\n\n\nContents of dupdatechecker.doc script\n\n\nFigure 12: Contents of dupdatechecker.doc script\nThe dupatechecker.exe file (MD5: C9F16F0BE8C77F0170B9B6CE876ED7FB) drops both\nBONDUPDATER and POWRUNER. These files connect to proxychecker[.]pro for C2.\n\n**Outlook and Implications**\n\nRecent activity by APT34 demonstrates that they are capable group with potential access to\ntheir own development resources. During the past few months, APT34 has been able to\nquickly incorporate exploits for at least two publicly vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0199 and CVE2017-11882)to target organizations in the Middle East. We assess that APT34’s efforts to\n\n\n-----\n\ncontinuously update their malware, including the incorporation of DGA for C2, demonstrate\nthe group’s commitment to pursing strategies to deter detection. We expect APT34 will\ncontinue to evolve their malware and tactics as they continue to pursue access to entities in\nthe Middle East region.\n\n**IOCs**\n\n\n**Filename / Domain / IP**\n**Address**\n\nCVE-2017-11882 exploit\ndocument\n\n\n**MD5 Hash or Description**\n\nA0E6933F4E0497269620F44A083B2ED4\n\n\nb.txt 9267D057C065EA7448ACA1511C6F29C7\n\nv.txt/v.vbs B2D13A336A3EB7BD27612BE7D4E334DF\n\ndUpdateCheckers.base 4A7290A279E6F2329EDD0615178A11FF\n\nhUpdateCheckers.base 841CE6475F271F86D0B5188E4F8BC6DB\n\ncUpdateCheckers.bat 52CA9A7424B3CC34099AD218623A0979\n\ndUpdateCheckers.ps1 BBDE33F5709CB1452AB941C08ACC775E\n\nhUpdateCheckers.ps1 247B2A9FCBA6E9EC29ED818948939702\n\nGoogleUpdateschecker.vbs C87B0B711F60132235D7440ADD0360B0\n\nhxxp://mumbai-m[.]site POWRUNER C2\n\nhxxp://dns-update[.]club Malware Staging Server\n\n\nCVE-2017-0199 exploit\ndocument\n\n\n63D66D99E46FB93676A4F475A65566D8\n\n\n94.23.172.164:80 Malware Staging Server\n\n\n-----\n\ndupdatechecker.doc D85818E82A6E64CA185EDFDDBA2D1B76\n\ndupdatechecker.exe C9F16F0BE8C77F0170B9B6CE876ED7FB\n\nproxycheker[.]pro C2\n\n46.105.221.247 Has resolved mumbai-m[.]site & hpserver[.]online\n\n148.251.55.110 Has resolved mumbai-m[.]site and dns-update[.]club\n\n185.15.247.147 Has resolved dns-update[.]club\n\n145.239.33.100 Has resolved dns-update[.]club\n\n82.102.14.219 Has resolved ns2.dns-update[.]club & hpserver[.]online &\nanyportals[.]com\n\nv7-hpserver.online.hta E6AC6F18256C4DDE5BF06A9191562F82\n\ndUpdateCheckers.base 3C63BFF9EC0A340E0727E5683466F435\n\nhUpdateCheckers.base EEB0FF0D8841C2EBE643FE328B6D9EF5\n\ncUpdateCheckers.bat FB464C365B94B03826E67EABE4BF9165\n\ndUpdateCheckers.ps1 635ED85BFCAAB7208A8B5C730D3D0A8C\n\nhUpdateCheckers.ps1 13B338C47C52DE3ED0B68E1CB7876AD2\n\ngoogleupdateschecker.vbs DBFEA6154D4F9D7209C1875B2D5D70D5\n\nhpserver[.]online C2\n\nv7-anyportals.hta EAF3448808481FB1FDBB675BC5EA24DE\n\ndUpdateCheckers.base 42449DD79EA7D2B5B6482B6F0D493498\n\n\n-----\n\nhUpdateCheckers.base A3FCB4D23C3153DD42AC124B112F1BAE\n\ndUpdateCheckers.ps1 EE1C482C41738AAA5964730DCBAB5DFF\n\nhUpdateCheckers.ps1 E516C3A3247AF2F2323291A670086A8F\n\nanyportals[.]com C2\n\n\n-----",
