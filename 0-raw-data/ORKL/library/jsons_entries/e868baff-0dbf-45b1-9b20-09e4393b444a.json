Such themes have been used in previous attack campaigns waged by the Molerats\nAPT.\n\nDuring our investigation we discovered that the campaign has been active since July 2021.\nThe attackers only switched the distribution method in December 2021 with minor changes\nin the .NET backdoor. In this blog, we will share complete technical analysis of the attack\nchain, the C2 infrastructure, threat attribution, and data exfiltration.\n\nThe targets in this campaign were chosen specifically by the threat actor and they included\ncritical members of banking sector in Palestine, people related to Palestinian political\nparties, as well as human rights activists and journalists in Turkey.\n\nThreatLabz observed several similarities in the C2 communication and .NET payload\nbetween this campaign and the previous campaigns attributed to the Molerats APT group.\n\nAdditionally, we discovered multiple samples that we suspect are related to Spark backdoor.\nWe have not added the analysis of these samples in this blog, but they were all configured\nwith the same C2 server, which we have included in the IOCs section.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat attribution\n\nWe have attributed the attack to Molerats APT group based on following observations:\n\n**1. Use of open-source as well as commercial packers for the backdoor (ConfuserEx,**\nThemida)\n\n**2. Targeting middle-east region**\n\n**3. Using Dropbox API for entire C2 communication**\n\n**4. Using RAR files for backdoor delivery as well as in later stages**\n\n**5. Using other legit cloud hosting services like Google Drive to host the payloads**\n\n**6. Overlap of domain SSL Certificate thumbprint observed on current attack infrastructure**\nwith domains used by Molerats APT group in the past\n\n**7. Overlap of Passive DNS resolution of domain observed on current attack infrastructure**\nwith the IP used by Molerats APT group in the past\n\n## Attack flow\n\nFigure 1 below illustrates the new attack chain.\n\n_Figure 1: Attack chain_\n\n## Decoy content\n\n**MD5: 46e03f21a95afa321b88e44e7e399ec3**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Note: Please refer Appendix section for additional decoy contents**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nFor the purpose of technical analysis we will use the document with MD5:\n46e03f21a95afa321b88e44e7e399ec3\n\n**[+] Stage-1: Macro code**\n\nThe macro code is not complex or obfuscated. It simply executes a command using cmd.exe\nwhich in turn performs the following operations:\n\n1. Executes a PowerShell command to download and drop the Stage-2 payload from the\n\nURL “http://45.63.49[.]202/document.html” to the path\n“C:\\ProgramData\\document.htm”.\n2. Renames document.htm to servicehost.exe\n3. Executes servicehost.exe\n\nFigure 2 below shows the relevant macro code\n\n_Figure 2: Macro code_\n\n**[+] Stage-2: servicehost.exe**\n\n**# Static analysis**\n\nBased on static analysis, we can see that the binary is .NET-based and is obfuscated using\nthe ConfuserEx packer. It masquerades itself as a WinRAR application by using the icon and\nother resources (which also contains static strings) from the legit WinRAR application.\n\n_Figure 3: Shows the binary icon and other static information_\n\n**# Dynamic analysis**\n\nThe main function of the binary is the standard ConfuserEx function which is responsible\nfor loading the runtime module \"koi'' that is stored in encrypted form using a byte array.\nOnce the module is loaded, the main function resolves the module's entry point function\nusing the metadata token and invokes it by providing required parameters.\n\n_Figure 4: Code snippet loading the runtime module and invoking it’s entry point function_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe runtime module (\"koi\") on analysis is found to be a backdoor. Before calling the main\nfunction of the module, the code from within the constructor is called which creates a new\nthread that regularly monitors the presence of a debugger.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Code snippet of debugger monitoring function_\n\nOnce the debugger monitor thread is created we get the code execution flow to the main\nfunction of the module which ultimately leads to the backdoor execution. Within the main\nfunction the backdoor performs following operations:\n\n**1. Collects the machine manufacture and machine model information using WMI which is**\nused for execution environment checks and is later exfiltrated to C2 server.\n\n**2. Checks if it should execute in the current execution environment.**\n\n**3. Creates a mutex with the name of executing binary.**\n\n**4. Checks if the mutex is created successfully.**\n\n**5. Determines if it is executed for the first time using the registry key value**\n\"HKCU/Software/{name_of_executing_binary}/{name_of_executing_binary}\".\n\n**6. If the registry key doesn't exist, the code flow goes via a mouse check function which**\nexecutes the code further only if it detects a change in either of the mouse cursor\ncoordinates. In the end, the mouse check function also creates the same registry key.\n\n_Figure 6: Main function of backdoor_\n\n**[+] Network communication**\n\nFrom the main function the final code flow reaches the function which starts the network\ncommunication. Since the backdoor uses Dropbox API for entire C2 communication and\ndata exfiltration, it first extracts the primary Dropbox account token which is stored in\nencoded form within the binary. Figure 7 below describes the format and shows the encoded\nstring that contains the Dropbox account token.\n\n_Figure 7: Encoded string_\n\nExecuting further the backdoor collects the following information from victim machine:\n\n\n-----\n\n**1.** **Machine IP address: By making a network request to “https://api.ipify.org”**\n\n**2.** **UserName: From the environment variable**\n\n**3.** **HostName: Using the API call Dns.GetHostName()**\n\nThe collected information is then processed and stored inside a variable named\n**“UserInfo” by performing following operations:**\n\n**1. Concatenation (IP+UserName+HostName)**\n\n**2. Base64 string encode**\n\n**3. Substitution (Substitute “=” with “1”)**\n\n**4. String reverse**\n\nNext the backdoor sends following network requests in the specified sequence using the\nDropbox API and correspondingly performs any required operations:\n\n**1. Create Folder:**\n\n\n-----\n\nCreate a folder inside the root directory where the folder name is the value of UserInfo\nvariable\n\n**Note: The created folder acts as a unique identifier for a machine considering the fact that**\nthe machine IP remains static.\n\n**2. Create File:**\n\nCreate a file inside the newly created folder where the file name is the Machine IP and the\ndata it stores is the information collected in Step-1 of the main function.\n\n**3. List Content:**\n\nList the content of victim specific folder and delete files where the file name length is 15\n\n**4. List Content:**\n\nList the content of root directory (which is attacker controlled) and extract the following\ninformation:\n\n**a) File name of any hosted RAR archive**\n\n**b) File name of any hosted exe (Which is found to be the legitimate RAR command-line**\nutility and is used to extract the downloaded RAR archive in case the machine doesn't\nalready have any RAR archive supporting application)\n\n**c) File name of any hosted pdf or doc file (Used as decoy document)**\n\n**d) File name of any non specific file type (Based on our analysis it contains the secondary**\nDropbox account token that is used for file exfiltration from victim machine)\n\n**Note: The above extracted information is stored locally and is used wherever required.**\n\nFinally, if the backdoor executed for the first time, it downloads and opens the hosted pdf or\ndoc file and then calls two other functions where the first function creates a thread that\ncontinuously communicates with the Dropbox account to fetch and execute the C2\ncommands while the second function creates a thread that downloads and executes the RAR\narchive using the information extracted earlier.\n\n**[+] C2 Commands**\n\nThe backdoor creates a file inside the victim specific folder on Dropbox which is used to\nfetch C2 commands. The file name is a random string of 15 characters.\n\n**The C2 commands have following format:**\n\n[command code]=[Command arguments separated using “^”]\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor uses command codes instead of plaintext strings to determine the action to\nbe performed.\n\n**Table below summarizes the supported command codes:**\n\n**Command code** **Action performed**\n\n1 Run specified command\n\n2 Take snapshot and upload\n\n3 Send list of files from specified directories\n\n4 Upload files\n\n5 Download and execute the RAR archive\n\n## C2 infrastructure analysis\n\nWhile monitoring the IPs used during the current attack we observed the domain\n**\"msupdata.com\" started to resolve to the IP 45.63.49[.]202 from 27-12-2021. We**\nfound two Historical SSL Certificates associated with this domain. Pivoting on the SSL\nCertificate with thumbprint \"ec5e468fbf2483cab74d13e5ff6791522fa1081b\" we\nfound domains like \"sognostudio.com\", \"smartweb9.com\" and others which were all\nattributed to Molerats APT group during past attacks.\n\nAdditionally, the subdomain “www.msupdata.com” also has a Passive DNS resolution to\nIP 185.244.39[.]165 which is also associated with Molerats APT group in the past.\n\n**Note: We didn't observe any activity related to the domain \"msupdata.com\" or it’s**\nsubdomain “www.msupdata.com” until this blog release.\n\n## Pivot on the Dropbox accounts\n\nBased on our analysis at least five Dropbox accounts are being used by the attacker. While\ninvestigating the Dropbox accounts we found that the attacker used following information\nduring account registration.\n\n**Note: Dropbox has confirmed the takedown of these accounts associated with the Molerats**\nAPT group.\n\n**Account 1:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Name: Adham gherbawi**\n**Country: NL (Netherlands)**\n**Email: adham.gharbawi@gmail[.]com**\n\n**Account 2:**\n\n**Name: alwatan voice**\n**Country: NL (Netherlands)**\n**Email: alwatanvoiceoffice@gmail[.]com**\n\n**Account 3:**\n\n**Name: adham gharbawi**\n**Country: NL (Netherlands)**\n**Email: adham.ghar.bawi@gmail[.]com**\n\n**Account 4:**\n\n**Name: pal leae**\n**Country: PS (Palestine)**\n**Email: palinfoarabic@gmail[.]com**\n\n**Account 5:**\n\n**Name: pla inod**\n**Country: PS (Palestine)**\n**Email: palinfo.arabic@gmail[.]com**\n\nAlso, while analyzing the exfiltrated data from Dropbox accounts we found a screenshot of\nthe attacker machine which was likely uploaded while the attacker was testing the malware.\nWe correlated a number of artifacts and patterns with the file names visible from the\nsnapshot to those used during the real attack. Moreover, from the snapshot the attacker\nseems to be using a simple GUI application to sync with the Dropbox account and display\nthe victims list. In the victims list, the user name \"mijda\" is also present which matches\nwith the name of document creator “mij daf” for all the documents we found during this\nattack.\n\n_Figure 8: Screenshot of attacker machine_\n\nAdditionally, we discovered that the attacker machine was configured with the IP\n**185.244.39[.]105 which is located in the Netherlands and is associated with the VPS**\nservice provider \"SKB Enterprise B.V.\". Interestingly, this IP (185.244.39[.]105) is\nalso located in the same subnet as the IP 185.244.39[.]165 which was used for C2\ncommunication and domain hosting in the past by Molerats APT group.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivot on Google drive link\n\nSince the attacker also used Google Drive to host the payload in one of the attack chains, we\ntried to identify the associated Gmail account. Based on our analysis the attacker used\nfollowing information for Gmail account:\n\n**Account name: Faten Issa**\n\n**Email: issafaten584@gmail[.]com**\n\n## Old attack chain\n\nAs per our analysis the old attack chain was used from 13th July 2021(Start of campaign) to\n13th Dec 2021.\n\nFigure 9 below illustrates the old attack chain.\n\nFigure 9: Attack chain\n\nThe major difference between the new attack chain and the old attack chain is seen in the\nbackdoor delivery. Although we are not sure how these RAR/ZIP files were delivered but\nconsidering the past attacks they were likely delivered using Phishing PDFs. Additionally,\nwe found a minor variation in the way the backdoor extracted the primary Dropbox account\ntoken.
