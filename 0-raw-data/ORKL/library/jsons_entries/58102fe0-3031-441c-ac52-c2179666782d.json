Now, however, it also appears to simply ask\nresearchers or other experts to offer opinions or write reports.\n\nAccording to emails reviewed by Reuters, among the other issues raised were China’s\nreaction in the event of a new nuclear test; and whether a \"quieter\" approach to North\nKorean \"aggression\" might be warranted.\n\n\"The attackers are having a ton of success with this very, very simple method,\" said James\nElliott of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), who added that the new tactic first\nemerged in January. \"The attackers have completely changed the process.\"\n\nMSTIC said it had identified \"multiple\" North Korea experts who have provided information to\na Thallium attacker account.\n\nA 2020 report by U.S. government cybersecurity agencies said Thallium has been operating\nsince 2012 and \"is most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence\ngathering mission.\"\n\n[Thallium has historically targeted government employees, think tanks, academics, and](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-hackers-target-skorea-nuclear-think-tank-lawmaker-2021-06-18/)\nhuman rights organisations, according to Microsoft.\n\n\"The attackers are getting the information directly from the horse's mouth, if you will, and\nthey don't have to sit there and make interpretations because they're getting it directly from\nthe expert,\" Elliott said.\n\n\n-----\n\n## NEW TACTICS\n\nNorth Korean hackers are well-known for attacks netting millions of dollars, targeting Sony\nPictures over a film seen as insulting to its leader, and stealing data from pharmaceutical and\ndefence companies, foreign governments, and others.\n\nNorth Korea's embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment, but it has\ndenied being involved in cyber crime.\n\nIn other attacks, Thallium and other hackers have spent weeks or months developing trust\nwith a target before sending malicious software, said Saher Naumaan, principal threat\nintelligence analyst at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence.\n\nBut according to Microsoft, the group now also engages with experts in some cases without\never sending malicious files or links even after the victims respond.\n\nThis tactic can be quicker than hacking someone's account and wading through their emails,\nbypasses traditional technical security programmes that would scan and flag a message with\nmalicious elements, and allows the spies direct access to the experts' thinking, Elliott said.\n\n\"For us as defenders, it's really, really hard to stop these emails,\" he said, adding that in most\ncases it comes down to the recipient being able to figure it out.\n\nTown said some messages purporting to be from her had used an email address that ended\nin \".live\" rather than her official account, which ends in \".org\", but had copied her full\nsignature line.\n\nIn one case, she said, she was involved in a surreal email exchange in which the suspected\nattacker, posing as her, included her in a reply.\n\nDePetris, a fellow with Defense Priorities and a columnist for several newspapers, said the\nemails he has received were written as if a researcher were asking for a paper submission or\ncomments on a draft.\n\n\"They were quite sophisticated, with think tank logos attached to the correspondence to\nmake it look as if the inquiry is legitimate,\" he said.\n\nAbout three weeks after receiving the faked email from 38 North, a separate hacker\nimpersonated him, emailing other people to look at a draft, DePetris said.\n\nThat email, which DePetris shared with Reuters, offers $300 for reviewing a manuscript\nabout North Korea's nuclear programme and asks for recommendations for other possible\nreviewers. Elliot said the hackers never paid anyone for their research or responses, and\nwould never intend to.\n\n\n-----\n\n## GATHERING INFORMATION\n\nImpersonation is a common method for spies around the world, but as North Korea's\nisolation has deepened under sanctions and the pandemic, Western intelligence agencies\nbelieve Pyongyang has become particularly reliant on cyber campaigns, one security source\nin Seoul told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nIn a March 2022 report, a panel of experts that investigates North Korea's U.N. sanctions\nevasions listed Thallium's efforts as among activities that \"constitute espionage intended to\ninform and assist\" the country's sanctions avoidance.\n\nTown said in some cases, the attackers have commissioned papers, and analysts had\nprovided full reports or manuscript reviews before realising what had happened.\n\nDePetris said the hackers asked him about issues he was already working on, including\nJapan's response to North Korea's military activities.\n\nAnother email, purporting to be a reporter from Japan's Kyodo News, asked a 38 North\nstaffer how they thought the war in Ukraine factored in North Korea's thinking, and posed\nquestions about U.S., Chinese, and Russian policies.\n\n\"One can only surmise that the North Koreans are trying to get candid views from think\ntankers in order to better understand U.S. policy on the North and where it may be going,\"\nDePetris said.\n\nReporting by Josh Smith.
