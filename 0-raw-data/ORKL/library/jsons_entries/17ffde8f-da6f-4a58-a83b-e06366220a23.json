They rely on tactics\nthat can be repeated successfully, commodity tools that are easily replaced, and ransomware\nthat makes itself hard to analyse by staying in its lane and cleaning up after itself.\n\nAnd while the footprint of a targeted attack is tiny in comparison to an outbreak or spam\ncampaign, it can extract more money from one victim than all of the WannaCry ransoms put\ntogether.\n\nTargeted attacks can lock small businesses out of critical systems or bring entire\n[organisations to a grinding halt, just as a recent SamSam attack against the city of Atlanta](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/06/08/atlanta-ransomware-attack-destroyed-years-of-police-dashcam-video/)\nshowed.\n\nFor every Atlanta-style attack that hits the headlines though, many more go unreported.\nAttackers don’t care if the victims are big organisations or small ones, all that matters is how\nvulnerable they are.\n\nIn fact, the three examples of ransomware we’ve chosen for this article, Dharma, SamSam\nand BitPaymer can be thought of (allowing for considerable overlap) as ransomware aimed\nat small, medium and large businesses respectively.\n\nAll businesses are targets, not just ones that hit the headlines.\n\n[For example, a recent investigation by Sophos revealed that SamSam’s apparent preference](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical-papers/SamSam-The-Almost-Six-Million-Dollar-Ransomware.pdf?cmp=26061)\nfor the healthcare and government sectors was an illusion. The majority of the SamSam\nvictims uncovered in the investigation were actually in the private sector but none of them\nhad gone public, whereas some government and healthcare victims had.\n\n## The anatomy of a targeted attack\n\nThe specifics of targeted attacks evolve over time, vary from hacking group to hacking group,\nand can be adapted to each individual target. Despite that, they show remarkable similarity in\ntheir overall structure.\n\nIn a typical targeted attack, a criminal hacker:\n\n1. Gains entry via a weak RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) password.\n2. Escalates their privileges until they’re an administrator.\n3. Uses their powerful access rights to overcome security software.\n4. Spreads and runs ransomware that encrypts a victim’s files.\n5. Leaves a note demanding payment in return for decrypting the files.\n6. Waits for the victim to contact them via email or a dark web website.\n\nThe similarity between attacks and attackers isn’t the result of coordination, but a\nconvergence around a method that works reliably, netting the criminals using it huge payoffs.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat convergence goes as far as including details like special offers: while the ransoms they\ndemand vary significantly, Dharma, SamSam and BitPaymer attacks all offer their victims the\nopportunity to decrypt one or two files for free to prove that they can do it – ransomware’s\nequivalent of a kidnapper’s “proof of life”.\n\nAlthough the outline of each attack is very similar, scripted even, what makes targeted\nattacks so fearsome is that the attackers are on hand to adapt and improvise.\n\nIn a targeted attack the assailant’s job is to break into the victim’s network and maximise the\nchances of the ransomware succeeding in its malevolent task, and the adversary most likely\nto ruin the attacker’s day is security software operating as one of several layers of\noverlapping protection.\n\nWriting ransomware that isn’t detected by security software is no easy task, so attackers will\noften look for a way to outflank it by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities that let them\nelevate their privileges.\n\nIf they can make themselves an administrator, an attacker will be permitted to run powerful\nadministration tools, like third party kernel drivers, that can disable processes and force\ndelete files, bypassing the protections put in place to stop the attackers uninstalling security\nsoftware directly.\n\nSecurity software still isn’t helpless though. Set up correctly, it can defend itself by blocking\nthe legitimate third party utilities that might be used to undermine it.\n\n## Variations on a theme\n\nThe coup de grâce in a targeted attack comes when the attacker has manoeuvred\nthemselves into a strong enough position to run their ransomware unencumbered.\n\nNow lets look at some of the ransomware itself.\n\n### Dharma\n\nDharma (also known as Crysis) attacks seem to run to a simple, cookie cutter script with\nattackers breaking in and then downloading the things they need to execute an attack from\nthe internet as if reading from a todo list: exploits to escalate their privileges, admin or\ntroubleshooting tools to tackle security software, and finally the ransomware itself.\n\nAlthough simple, the attacks show more variability, and occur at a much greater frequency,\nthan either SamSam or BitPaymer attacks, which may indicate that Dharma is used by\nmultiple groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the attacker is inside the victim s network they place the ransomware on one or more\nof a victim’s servers manually. Consequently, attacks are often limited in scope, affecting just\na few servers.\n\nMost Dharma attacks seem to have affected small businesses of up to 150 users, although\nit’s not known if this is down to deliberate targeting or simply a side-effect of something else.\n\nRansom demands are made over email, using an address specified in the ransom note,\naway from prying eyes.\n\n### SamSam\n\n\n-----\n\nSamSam malware first appeared in December 2015 and since then more than $6 million has\nbeen deposited into SamSam Bitcoin wallets.\n\nThe pattern of attacks and the evolution of the SamSam malware suggests that it’s the work\nof one person or a small group. Attacks are infrequent (around one a day) compared to other\nkinds of ransomware, but are devastating.\n\nAfter breaking in via RDP, the attacker attempts to escalate their privileges to the level of\nDomain Admin so that they can deploy SamSam malware across an entire network, just like\na sysadmin deploying regular software.\n\nThe attacker seems to wait until victims are likely to be asleep before unleashing the\nmalware on every infected machine simultaneously, giving the victim little time to react or to\nprioritise, and potentially crippling their network.\n\nA ransom note demands payment of about $50,000 in bitcoins and directs the victims to a\ndark web site (a Tor hidden service).\n\nEach victim has their own page on the site where they can ask the attacker questions and\nreceive instructions on how to decrypt their files.\n\nTo find out more about SamSam, read Sophos’s extensive new research, SamSam: The\n(almost) six million dollar ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n### BitPaymer\n\nThe most mysterious and sophisticated malware on our list is BitPaymer. Little is known\nabout this elusive malware, or how it’s deployed (you can read about one of the tricks it uses\n[to hide itself in our article, How BitPaymer ransomware covers its tracks).](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/09/21/how-bitpaymer-ransomware-covers-its-tracks/)\n\nWhat seems certain is that this ‘high end’ ransomware has raised a lot of money for its\ncreators. Six-figure ransom demands as high as $500,000 have been reported and analysis\nof known BitPaymer Bitcoin addresses shows that it’s raised at least $1 million in the last\nmonth alone.\n\nRansom notes contain email addresses at secure email providers but the method for\nagreeing payment varies: some simply include a Bitcoin address while others list a dark web\nURL instead, like SamSam. In some attacks the victims have also been threatened with\ndoxing.\n\n## What to do?\n\nTargeted attacks may be relatively sophisticated but the criminals behind them aren’t looking\nfor a challenge, they’re looking for vulnerable organisations. The best way to get yourself off\nan attacker’s hit list is by getting the basics right: lock down RDP and follow a strict patching\nprotocol for your operating systems and the applications that run on them.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf an attacker does get on your network then make sure they re met with layers of\noverlapping defences, a well segmented network, user rights assigned according to need\nrather than convenience, and be sure that your backups are offline and out of their reach.\n\nWe recently published a detailed guide on how to defend yourself against SamSam\nransomware, that includes specifics on how to lock down RDP, suggestions on how to\norganise your user accounts and more. The advice and approach in it are applicable to all\nthe targeted ransomware mentioned in this article.\n\n\n-----",
