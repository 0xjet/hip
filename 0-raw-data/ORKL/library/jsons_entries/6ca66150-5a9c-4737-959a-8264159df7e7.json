    "plain_text": "# APT Trends Report Q2 2018\n\n**securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2018/86487**\n\nBy GReAT\n\nIn the second quarter of 2017, Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT)\nbegan publishing summaries of the quarter’s private threat intelligence reports, in an effort\nto make the public aware of the research we have been conducting. This report serves as\nthe latest installment, focusing on the relevant activities that we observed during Q2 2018.\n\nThese summaries are a representative snapshot of what has been discussed in greater\ndetail in our private reports. They aim to highlight the significant events and findings that we\nfeel people should be aware of. For brevity’s sake, we are choosing not to publish indicators\nassociated with the reports highlighted. However, readers who would like to learn more\nabout our intelligence reports or request more information on a specific report are\n[encouraged to contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com.](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Remarkable new findings\n\nWe are always interested in analyzing new techniques used by existing groups, or in finding\nnew clusters of activity that might lead us to discover new actors. Q2 2018 was very\ninteresting in terms of APT activity, with a remarkable campaign that reminds us how real\nsome of the threats are that we have been predicting over the last few years. In particular,\nwe have warned repeatedly how ideal networking hardware was for targeted attacks, and\nthat we had started seeing the first advanced sets of activity focusing on these devices.\n\nIn terms of well-known groups, Asian actors were the most active by far.\n\n[Lazarus/BlueNoroff was suspected of targeting financial institutions in Turkey as part of a](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/hidden-cobra-targets-turkish-financial-sector-new-bankshot-implant/)\nbigger cyberespionage campaign. The same actor was also suspected of a campaign against\nan online casino in Latin America that ended in a destructive attack. Based on our telemetry,\nwe further observed Lazarus targeting financial institutions in Asia. Lazarus has\naccumulated a large collection of artefacts over the last few years, in some cases with heavy\ncode reuse, which makes it possible to link many newly found sets of activity to this actor.\nOne such tool is the Manuscrypt malware, used exclusively by Lazarus in many recent\n[attacks. The US-CERT released a warning in June about a new version of Manuscrypt they](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-165A)\ncall TYPEFRAME.\n\n\n-----\n\n_US-CERT alert on Manuscrypt/TYPEFRAME malware used by Lazarus_\n\n\nEven if it is unclear what the role of Lazarus will be in the new geopolitical landscape, where\nNorth Korea is actively engaged in peace talks, it would appear that financially motivated\nactivity (through the BlueNoroff and, in some cases, the Andariel subgroup) continues\nunabated.\n\nPossibly even more interesting is the relatively intense activity by Scarcruft, also known as\n[Group123 and Reaper. Back in January, Scarcruft was found using a zero-day exploit, CVE-](https://www.krcert.or.kr/data/secNoticeView.do?bulletin_writing_sequence=26998)\n2018-4878 to target South Korea, a sign that the group’s capabilities were increasing. In the\nlast few months, the use of Android malware by this actor has been discovered, as well as a\nnew campaign where it spreads a new backdoor we call POORWEB. Initially, there was\n[suspicion that Scarcruft was also behind the CVE-2018-8174 zero day announced by](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/cve-2018-8174-en/)\nQihoo360. We were later able to confirm the zero day was actually distributed by a different\n[APT group, known as DarkHotel.](https://securelist.com/the-darkhotel-apt/66779/)\n\nThe overlaps between Scarcruft and Darkhotel go back to 2016 when we [discovered](https://securelist.com/cve-2016-4171-adobe-flash-zero-day-used-in-targeted-attacks/75082/)\nOperation Daybreak and Operation Erebus. In both cases, attacks leveraged the same\nhacked website to distribute exploits, one of which was a zero day. We were later able to\nseparate these as follows:\n\nOperation Exploit Actor\n\nDaybreak CVE-2016-4171 DarkHotel\n\nErebus CVE-2016-4117 Scarcruft\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkHotel’s Operation Daybreak relied on spear-phishing emails predominantly targeting\nChinese victims with a Flash Player zero day. Meanwhile, Scarcruft’s Operation Erebus\nfocused primarily on South Korea.\n\nAnalysis of the CVE-2018-8174 exploit used by DarkHotel revealed that the attacker was\nusing URLMoniker to invoke Internet Explorer through Microsoft Word, ignoring any default\nbrowser preferences on the victim’s computer. This is the first time we have observed this.\nIt is an interesting technique that we believe may be reused in future for different attacks.\n[For more details check our Securelist Blog: “The King is Dead. Long Live the King!“.](https://securelist.com/root-cause-analysis-of-cve-2018-8174/85486/)\n\nWe also observed some relatively quiet groups coming back with new activity. A noteworthy\n[example is LuckyMouse (also known as APT27 and Emissary Panda), which abused ISPs in](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/)\nAsia for waterhole attacks on high profile websites. We wrote about LuckyMouse targeting\nnational data centers in June. We also discovered that LuckyMouse unleashed a new wave\nof activity targeting Asian governmental organizations just around the time they had\ngathered for a summit in China.\n\nStill, the most notable activity during this quarter is the VPNFilter campaign attributed by\nthe FBI to the Sofacy and Sandworm (Black Energy) APT groups. The campaign targeted a\nlarge array of domestic networking hardware and storage solutions. It is even able to inject\nmalware into traffic in order to infect computers behind the infected networking device. We\n[have provided an analysis on the EXIF to C2 mechanism used by this malware.](https://securelist.com/vpnfilter-exif-to-c2-mechanism-analysed/85721/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis campaign is one of the most relevant examples we have seen of how networking\nhardware has become a priority for sophisticated attackers. The data provided by our\ncolleagues at Cisco Talos indicates this campaign was at a truly global level. We can confirm\nwith our own analysis that traces of this campaign can be found in almost every country.\n\n## Activity of well-known groups\n\nIt seems that some of the most active groups from the last few years have reduced their\nactivity, although this does not mean they are less dangerous. For instance, it was publicly\nreported that Sofacy started using new, freely available modules as last stagers for some\nvictims. However, we observed how this provided yet another innovation for their arsenal,\nwith the addition of new downloaders written in the Go programming language to\ndistribute Zebrocy.\n\nThere is possibly one notable exception to this supposed lack of activity. After the Olympic\nDestroyer campaign last January against the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic games, we\n[observed new suspected activity by the same actor (we tentatively called them Hades) in](https://securelist.com/olympic-destroyer-is-still-alive/86169/)\nEurope. This time, it seems the targets are financial organizations in Russia, and biological\nand chemical threat prevention laboratories in Europe and Ukraine.\n\nBut even more interesting is the resemblance between the TTPs and OPSEC of the Olympic\nDestroyer set of activity and those of Sofacy. Olympic Destroyer is a master of deception, so\nthis may be yet another false flag, but so far we connect, with low to medium confidence,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Hades group activity to Sofacy.\n\nOne of the most interesting attacks we detected was an implant from Turla (attributed to\nthis actor with medium confidence) that we call LightNeuron. This new artefact directly\ntargets Exchange Servers and uses legitimate standard calls to intercept emails, exfiltrate\ndata and even send mails on behalf of the victims. We believe this actor has been using this\ntechnique since maybe as early as 2014, and that there is a version affecting Unix servers\nrunning Postfix and Sendmail. So far we have seen victims of this implant in the Middle East\nand Central Asia.\n\n## Newcomers and comebacks\n\nEvery now and then, we are surprised to see old actors that have been dormant for months\nor even years distributing new malware. Obviously, this may be caused by a lack of visibility,\nbut regardless of that, it indicates that these actors are still active.\n\nOne good example would be WhiteWhale, an actor that has been extremely quiet since\n2016. We detected a new campaign last April where the actor was distributing both the\nTaidoor and Yalink malware families. This activity was almost exclusively targeting Japanese\nentities.\n\nFollowing the intense diplomatic activity around the North Korea peace talks and the\nsubsequent summit with the U.S. president in Singapore, Kimsuky decided to take\nadvantage of this theme to distribute its malware in a new campaign. A massive update to\nits arsenal in late 2017 and early 2018 was mobilized in a new wave of spear-phishing\nemails.\n\nWe also discovered a new low-sophistication set of activity we call Perfanly, which we couldn\n´t attribute to any known actor. It has been targeting governmental entities in Malaysia and\nIndonesia since at least 2017. It uses custom multistage droppers as well as freely available\ntools such as Metasploit.\n\nBetween June and July, we observed a battery of attacks against various institutions in\nKuwait. These attacks leverage Microsoft Office documents with macros, which drop a\ncombination of VBS and Powershell scripts using DNS for command and control. We have\nobserved similar activity in the past from groups such as Oilrig and Stonedrill, which leads\nus to believe the new attacks could be connected, though for now that connection is only\nassessed as low confidence.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\n\n-----\n\nThe combination of simple custom artefacts designed mainly to evade detection, with\npublicly available tools for later stages seems to be a well-established trend for certain sets\nof activity, like the ones found under the ‘Chinese-speaking umbrella’, as well as for many\nnewcomers who find the entry barrier into APT cyberespionage activity non-existent.\n\nThe intermittent activity by many actors simply indicates they were never out of business.\nThey might take small breaks to reorganize themselves, or to perform small operations that\nmight go undetected on a global scale. Probably one of the most interesting cases is\nLuckyMouse, with aggressive new activity heavily related to the geopolitical agenda in Asia.\nIt is impossible to know if there is any coordination with other actors who resurfaced in the\nregion, but this is a possibility.\n\nOne interesting aspect is the high level of activity by Chinese-speaking actors against\nMongolian entities over the last 10 months. This might be related to several summits\nbetween Asian countries – some related to new relations with North Korea – held in\nMongolia, and to the country’s new role in the region.\n\nThere were also several alerts from NCSC and US CERT regarding Energetic Bear/Crouching\nYeti activity. Even if it is not very clear how active this actor might be at the moment (the\nalerts basically warned about past incidents), it should be considered a dangerous, active\nand pragmatic actor very focused on certain industries. We recommend checking our latest\nanalysis on Securelist because the way this actor uses hacked infrastructure can create a lot\nof collateral victims.\n\nTo recap, we would like to emphasize just how important networking hardware has become\nfor advanced attackers. We have seen various examples during recent months and\nVPNFilter should be a wake-up call for those who didn’t believe this was an important issue.\n\nWe will continue to track all the APT activity we can find and will regularly highlight the more\ninteresting findings, but if you want to know more, please reach out to us at\nintelreports@kasperksy.com.\n\n\n-----",
