Other computers on the network had been encrypted as well.\n\n\"The encryption affected all of our server-based files and electronic data. We have a\nmechanical back up for those files and data, but the back-up was encrypted as well. Certain\ncomputers were affected in full. Others were unaffected and remain functional,\" the email\nfrom Temple Har Shalom stated.\n\nA source familiar with the matter told BleepingComputer that Sodinokibi was demanding\nclose to $500,000 ransom to receive a decryptor for their network.\n\n\n-----\n\nTemple Har Shalom states that they will be contacting congregation members for information\nneeded to recreate encrypted files. This indicates that they have no intention of paying the\nransom.\n\nLike all ransomware victims, the temple feels violated by the attack but does not think they\nwere targeted as a Jewish organization.\n\n\"The attack is violative of us as a community, though we have no reason to believe that we\nwere targeted because we are a Jewish organization.\"\n\nAs Sodinokibi is known to steal files before encrypting them, they may have gained access to\nthe personal data of congregants.\n\nThe synagogue states that this data may include a congregant's name, address, and email\naddress, but they do not believe the attackers had access to their financial information.\n\n\"Beyond names, addresses and e-mail addresses of congregants, because of the way we\nsegregate our files, we do not believe that confidential personal membership information\n(such as financial information) was accessed,\" the email stated. \"Nonetheless, as we note\nabove, be particularly mindful of phishing scams.\"\n\nTemple members, though, should be on the lookout for targeted phishing emails using their\npersonal information.\n\n[Sodinokibi has also started to publicly leak the stolen data of victims if a ransom is not paid.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-publishes-stolen-data-for-the-first-time/)\nIt is not known how much data, if any, was stolen from the temple or if they intend to publish\nit for non-payment.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted both the ransomware actors and the temple, but have not\nheard back at this time.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[REvil's TOR sites come alive to redirect to new ransomware operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revils-tor-sites-come-alive-to-redirect-to-new-ransomware-operation/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
