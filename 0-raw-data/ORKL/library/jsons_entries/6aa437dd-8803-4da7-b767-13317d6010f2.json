Although not always obvious, many missions depend on the\nunfailing functioning of ICS and therefore on the security of those systems.\n\nA mission assured today is never taken for granted as assured tomorrow. Mission assurance\ndemands constant vigilance along with proactive risk management. Risks come in myriad\nshapes and sizes—some enduring, some sporadic and situational, others appearing without\nwarning. ICS represent only one set among a vast array of mission vulnerabilities and risks, an\narray that often competes for resources and, therefore, requires prioritization of management\nactions.\n\nThis handbook is intended for use primarily by Department of Defense (DOD) installation\ncommanders, supported by staff members, as a management tool to self-assess,[1] prioritize,\nand manage mission-related vulnerabilities and risks that may be exposed or created by\nconnectivity to ICS. ICS include a variety of systems or mechanisms used to monitor and/or\noperate critical infrastructure elements, such as electricity, water, natural gas, fuels, entry and\naccess (doors, buildings, gates), heating & air-conditioning, runway lighting, etc. Other terms\n\n1 Other entities and programs are available to conduct formal and very thorough technical assessments, but those\nmust be coordinated, scheduled, and resourced (i.e., funded). This aid provides an ability to conduct selfassessments when/as necessary or desired, and thereby, also the ability to prioritize and manage the resources\nrequired to address identified vulnerabilities and risks.\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\noften heard include SCADA, DCS, or EMCS.[2] Throughout this book the term “ICS” is used as\nencompassing such variations.\n\nThis book is intentionally generic. Whatever the category of ICS, the approach to vulnerability\nassessment and risk management is similar. The applicability of actions recommended here\nmay be extended to any DOD military installation regardless of the specific categories of ICS\nencountered. In keeping with the generic approach and due primarily to the unique nature of\neach installation’s infrastructure, beyond a couple of exceptions there are no checklists,\nstandard operating procedures (SOP), or similar sets of lock-step actions provided here.\nHowever, a risk management team using the handbook likely will want to develop checklists\ntailored to their specific circumstances.\n\nAmong other purposes, this handbook is intended to increase awareness of how a threat\nrelated to the ICS itself translates into a threat to the mission, either directly through the ICS or\ncircuitously via network connections. Every military installation has numerous mission-support\nprocesses and systems controlled by, or that otherwise depend on, ICS. Every connection or\naccess point represents potential vulnerabilities and, therefore, risks to the system under\ncontrol (i.e., electrical, water, emergency services, etc.), which can escalate quickly to adverse\nimpact on mission essential functions (MEF) and mission accomplishment.\n\nFundamentally then, this handbook is provided to help the installation leadership conduct a risk\nself-assessment focused on ICS and supported missions and then implement plans to manage\nthat risk. Most of the information contained herein is not unique to this publication. Two\nunique aspects are: (1) the aggregation of disparate information into one place, distilling\nessentials, and tailoring to DOD installation leadership; and (2) bringing cyber/information\ntechnology (IT), civil engineers, public works, and mission operators together with a singular\nfocus on ICS security in support of missions. This handbook (via Appendices) also points to\nadditional resources.\n\nThe key set of activities—one exception to the “no checklists” approach—is found under the\nheading “ICS Security Assessment Process.” Succinctly the process consists of eight steps,\nwhich if implemented with deliberation and in a team environment, will set the success\nconditions for all other actions recommended or suggested within this handbook (see Figure 1).\nThis set of eight steps represents the core of the handbook. All other information herein is\nintended to support implementation of those eight steps.\n\n2 SCADA= Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition; DCS = Distributed Control System; EMCS = Energy\nManagement Control System. Other variations exist; for example, building control systems.\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore explaining the eight-step assessment process, the handbook provides introductory,\ninformative and supporting information. Closely aligned with and serving as companion to the\n“Assessment Process” is a section titled “Framework for Successful ICS Defense.” If the\ninstallation does not already have a single ICS manager and/or team, the “Framework” should\nbe considered prior to engaging on the eight-step process.\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. ICS Security Assessment Eight-Step Process\n\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n##### INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS “101”\n\nKey Point\n\n  - Understanding ICS is not difficult; the challenge is to understand the ICS relationship to\nmissions.\n\nFundamentally Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are systems and mechanisms that control flow.\nICS control flow of electricity, fluids, gases, air, traffic, and even people. They are the\ncomputer-controlled electro-mechanical systems that ensure installation infrastructure services\nare delivered when and where required to accomplish the mission. In the electric\ninfrastructure, they control actions such as opening and closing switches; for water, they open\nand close valves; for buildings, they control access to various doors as well as operation of the\nheating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.\n\nThe term “Industrial Control System” is broad; specific instances of ICS may be called\nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Distributed Control System (DCS), Energy\nManagement Control System (EMCS), Emergency Medical Service (EMS), or other terms but all\nperform the same fundamental function. Also, on DOD installations, ICS are associated\nprimarily with infrastructure elements; therefore, though not technically accurate, they may be\nreferred to as “Infrastructure” vice “Industrial” control systems. The hardware components\nthat comprise an ICS usually are classed as operational technology (OT) versus information\ntechnology (IT), which refers to (among other things) the computer equipment that sits on\nnearly every desk. Another term used in this domain is Platform Information Technology (PIT),[3]\n(and PITI, with the ‘I’ referring to interconnect, or connected to the network) although ICS are\nonly one sub-category of PIT, which also includes weapons systems, aircraft, vehicles, buildings,\netc.  Terminology is not that critical. What is important is to know that ICS are critical to the\nmission.\n\nYou frequently have used an ICS—though not by that term—in your home. It is called a\n“thermostat.” The most simple of thermostats may not be so obvious as an ICS, but the more\nsophisticated can be programmed to automatically control the flow of air (heated, cooled, or\njust fan) by day, time, room, zone, etc. The most advanced allow the owner to monitor and\noperate the system over an Internet connection or Wi-Fi, using a Smartphone or tablet.\n\nThe “Smart Grid,” once fully implemented, will allow your utility company to operate your\nthermostat remotely. The thermostat monitors temperatures (and some include humidity) and\n\n3 “PIT” is used more by the Air Force and to a lesser extent by the Navy. At the DoD level, PIT is addressed mostly\nunder information assurance (IA) guidance, such as DODI 8500.2. See the Glossary for a DOD definition of PIT.\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\nthen operates the electro-mechanical equipment (furnace, air conditioner, fan) to respond to\nthe preset conditions you have selected. If the thermostat fails—even though the mechanicals\nare in perfect operating condition—the mission (cool, heat) fails. This same concept translates\nto the installation’s missions: if the ICS fails the mission can fail, although the direct cause and\neffect may not always be so obvious.\n\nICS typically are not visible to the general population. The control devices themselves are\nbehind panels, behind walls, inside cabinets, under floors, under roads; the master control\ncomputers more often reside in a room in a civil engineer (CE) or public works (PW) facility.\nBecause they are essentially invisible to all but CE and PW, and are considered as simply\ninfrastructure elements, ICS often are overlooked when assessing mission dependencies.\nRegardless of where they physically reside or who directly operates the ICS, every person and\nevery mission on the installation is a stakeholder in their properly functioning.\n\nWhile the ICS field (vs. control room) elements consist of mostly electro-mechanical devices,\nsome are actually computers that control other field devices and communicate with other\ncomputers in the system with minimal human interaction. The most common example of this\ntype is the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).[4] PLCs (and their cousins, Remote Terminal\nUnits or RTU) are very important because they are computers, typically not under direct human\nsupervision, and offer multiple pathways (e.g., wireless, modem, Ethernet, Universal Serial Bus\n\n[USB]) for connecting to both the controlled infrastructure and the network. This combination\nof characteristics makes the PLC an especially vulnerable node in the ICS.\n\nAt the front end—the control center—is where most of the computers (servers, system\ninterfaces, etc.) and, more critically, connection to other networks reside. While PLCs/RTUs\nmay become connected (autonomously or by human intervention) for intermittent periods,\ncontrol center computers may be continuously connected[5] to the Non-secure Internet Protocol\nRouter Network (NIPRNet), other elements of the Global Information Grid (GIG), and/or an\nInternet Service Provider (ISP). It is especially at this node that ICS should be treated with the\nsame security considerations as with IT.\nWhether an ICS element is continuously or only intermittently connected presents the same\nfundamental security issue. Anytime an element is connected to a network, even if for only\n\n4 Many will recall that a Siemens PLC was the primary target for the Stuxnet code that impacted the centrifuges in\nthe Iranian nuclear processing facility at Natanz in 2010. This same PLC (or variants) can be found in the critical\ninfrastructures on numerous DOD installations. See an informative Wikipedia article on Stuxnet here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet\n5 Another term used here is PIT-I, or PIT-Interconnect—that juncture where the ICS (or OT) connects with the IT\nnetwork. For detail on PIT and PIT-I, in addition to DODI 8500.2, see: DODD 8500.01E; AFI 33-210 with AFGM2.2;\nAFCESA ETL 11-1; DON CIO Memo 02-10 and Enclosures.\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\nbrief instances, it is vulnerable to destructive attack, compromise, or manipulation. Therefore,\nwhen assessing risk the key question is not “Is it connected?” but “Is it connect-able?”\nNetwork mapping (via software) will not reveal such potential connectivity; only a physical,\nvisual inspection of an element by a knowledgeable expert (more likely an IT than a CE or PW\nperson) will yield specific information on what type of connection ports exist on what elements.\nWhere the location of an element makes visual inspection impractical or impossible, use the\nmanufacturer’s or vendor’s published manuals for that specific piece of equipment.\n\nUnderstanding the fundamentals of ICS is not difficult. The challenge is in understanding the\ndependencies of mission on ICS and therefore, appropriately managing the risks to the ICS and\nto the missions they support. This handbook is intended to assist the commander and staff in\ngaining that understanding.\n\nFigure 2. PLCs & RTUs: The Challenge of Finding the Connectivity\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\n##### HANDBOOK AUTHORITIES\n\nKey Point:\n\n  - The handbook reflects breadth and depth of ICS community expertise.\n\nThis handbook was developed based on a broad collection of authoritative sources;[6] underwent\nfield testing to validate the framework and applicability at the installation command level; was\nreviewed by a Joint Warfighter Advisory Group (JWAG[7]) to verify broad (i.e., Joint) applicability;\nand received direct input by a broad-based selection of ICS and risk management subject\nmatter experts (SME). Users of this handbook will gain even greater value by referencing\ncurrent publications of primary sources. Some of the major publications are listed in Appendix\nA, References. Note that while this handbook is advisory, many of the sources are authoritative\nand/or directive.\n\n##### DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ICS AND IT\n\nKey Point:\n\n  - ICS and IT share similarities, but also have unique characteristics.\n\nFundamentally ICS security is a combination of IA, cyber security, physical security, and\noperations security (OPSEC). This same combination is applicable to IT, so is there any\ndifference between ICS and IT? Yes. One key distinction between ICS and other IT\narchitectures is that the physical world can be impacted disastrously by malicious (or only\naccidental) manipulation of the ICS. For example, with IT there typically is linkage with only\nother IT components; with ICS the linkage can be to the electric grid, powering other critical\nassets, as well as to other infrastructure elements. This gives rise to another primary\ndistinction, namely that ICS must always be available while “pure” IT can survive downtimes.\nAnother important difference is in the “refresh” rates of the technologies: IT tends to turn over\nin three years or less while OT (ICS) can be on a 20-year cycle. Why is this important to know?\n\n6 Among sources: Idaho National Laboratory (INL); AF Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA); Department of\nHomeland Security DHS ICS-Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT); the National SCADA Test Bed (NSTB);\nDHS Center for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI); National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST); National Security Agency’s (NSA) Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS); Federal Information\nProcessing Standards (FIPS); and numerous SMEs who are members of or closely associated with the DoD.\n7 JWAG participants may differ from meeting-to-meeting, but broadly represent stakeholders in the outcome or\nproduct of a specified Joint activity or project. For this handbook the initial JWAG included representatives from\nUnited States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), Northern Command (NORTHCOM), AFCESA, INL, Sandia National\nLaboratory (SNL), and various CE and communications experts from both Army and Air Force elements of Joint\nBase San Antonio.\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\nThe long refresh cycle of ICS results in hardware, software, and operating systems no longer\nsupported by vendors. The impacts of lack of support include: woefully stale malware\ndetection programs, operating systems that cannot handle newer (and more efficient/effective)\nsoftware programs, and hardware that may be on the verge of catastrophic failure with no\nbackup or failover equipment available.\n\nThe following extract from NIST Special Publication 800-82[8] provides an excellent review of not\nonly the distinctions but also the similarities and how OT (such as ICS) and IT are converging.\n\n“Initially, ICS had little resemblance to traditional information technology (IT)\nsystems in that ICS were isolated systems running proprietary control protocols\nusing specialized hardware and software. Widely available, low-cost Internet\nProtocol (IP) devices are now replacing proprietary solutions, which increases\nthe possibility of cyber security vulnerabilities and incidents. As ICS are adopting\nIT solutions to promote corporate business systems connectivity and remote\naccess capabilities, and are being designed and implemented using industry\nstandard computers, operating systems (OS) and network protocols, they are\nstarting to resemble IT systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities, but\nit provides significantly less isolation for ICS from the outside world than\npredecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure these systems. While\nsecurity solutions have been designed to deal with these security issues in typical\nIT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same\nsolutions to ICS environments. In some cases, new security solutions are needed\nthat are tailored to the ICS environment.\n\n“Although some characteristics are similar, ICS also have characteristics that\ndiffer from traditional information processing systems. Many of these\ndifferences stem from the fact that logic executing in ICS has a direct affect on\nthe physical world. Some of these characteristics include significant risk to the\nhealth and safety of human lives and serious damage to the environment, as well\nas serious financial issues such as production losses, negative impact to a\nnation’s economy, and compromise of proprietary information. ICS have unique\nperformance and reliability requirements and often use operating systems and\napplications that may be considered unconventional to typical IT personnel.\nFurthermore, the goals of safety and efficiency sometimes conflict with security\nin the design and operation of control systems.\n\n8 NIST SP 800-82, 2011 version, Executive Summary, p.1.\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\nOriginally, ICS implementations were susceptible primarily to local threats\nbecause many of their components were in physically secured areas and the\ncomponents were not connected to IT networks or systems. However, the trend\ntoward integrating ICS systems with IT networks provides significantly less\nisolation for ICS from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a\ngreater need to secure these systems from remote, external threats. Also, the\nincreasing use of wireless networking places ICS implementations at greater risk\nfrom adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not have\ndirect physical access to the equipment. Threats to control systems can come\nfrom numerous sources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups,\ndisgruntled employees, malicious intruders, complexities, accidents, natural\ndisasters as well as malicious or accidental actions by insiders. ICS security\nobjectives typically follow the priority of availability, integrity and confidentiality,\nin that order.”\n\nDistinctions between ICS and IT aside, from a purely technical security standpoint, ICS may be\nconsidered on par with IT or IA vis-à-vis security challenges, albeit with warnings about use of\ncertain software tools on the networks.[9]\n\n##### THREATS\n\nKey Point:\n\n  - Threats are global but assessments must be local.\n\nWhat threats could be posed to an installation’s mission by or through the ICS? This is an\nessential question, but one that cannot be answered specifically in an unclassified venue or\nsimplistically in any venue. Generically, threats fall into categories similar to IT and/or cyber:\nterrorist, criminal, insider, environmental, etc. Use of this self-assessment handbook can lead\nto a deeper understanding of the infrastructure and establish mitigation conditions whereby\nspecific threats may be identified. But even without specific threats known many risks can be\n\n9 Caveat emptor with respect to software tools. Software applications that test, penetrate, scan, characterize,\nand/or defend networks should be considered equivalent to “loaded weapons” with respect to control systems.\nSome tools that are entirely “safe” when used on IT networks have been demonstrated both in the field and under\ncontrolled conditions to have negative, even catastrophic effects on ICS networks. If such tools are considered for\nuse on ICS, the decision must be an informed one and the tool operator must be a SME who understands potential\neffects of that tool on an ICS. Furthermore, any such use must be coordinated with the relevant IT agency (e.g.,\nService CERT) because tool use on the connected ICS could trip various IT network defense mechanisms (firewalls,\nintrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), etc).\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\nidentified and managed. In other words, this handbook can help to establish a more effective\nand efficient security posture to conduct formal threat assessments.\n\nThe Security Incidents Organization in a 2009 survey (not specific to DOD) assessed that roughly\n75% of ICS incidents were unintentional. Of the 25% that were intentional, over half were by\ninsiders. In other words, external threat actors were responsible for events only about 10% of\nthe time. Based on percentages alone, the hostile threat actor would appear to be of far less\nconcern than a mistake committed by a legitimate operator. However, the external threat\nactor represents a potentially far more malicious and far-reaching impact on mission than\neither the intentional insider or unintentional event. Among external threats, perhaps the most\ninsidious is the so-called Advanced Persistent Threat, or APT. The National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) (et al) assesses that the external threat actor found ways not\nonly to get “inside” but also to stay there as long as he wants or needs. The APT,[10] especially\nnation-state sponsored, is perhaps the most ominous threat to DOD networks. Open source\ninformation on threats is plentiful and readily available, but ICS security teams will need access\nto classified intelligence resources to obtain more “actionable” information.\n\n“The increasing interconnectivity and interdependence among commercial and defense infrastructures\ndemand that DOD take steps to understand and remedy or mitigate the vulnerabilities of, and threats to,\nthe critical infrastructures on which it depends for mission accomplishment.”\n\nJoint Pub 3-27 (p. VII-8)\n\n##### MISSION PRIORITIES\n\nKey Points:\n\n  - Missions are interconnected and mutually dependent in complex ways.\n\n  - Priorities tend to be situational and event-driven.\n\nThe US Navy, articulating what is essentially true for all the Services and including ICS as part of\ntheir cyber infrastructure, has stated:[11]\n“The Department of the Navy (DON) relies on a network of physical and\ncyber infrastructure so critical that its degradation, exploitation, or\ndestruction could have a debilitating effect on the DON’s ability to project,\nsupport, and sustain its forces and operations worldwide. This critical\ninfrastructure includes DON and non-DON domestic and foreign\n\n10 NIST addressed the APT in Revision 4 to SP 800-53.\n11 Critical Infrastructure Protection Program, Strategy for 2009 and Beyond, 2009\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\ninfrastructures essential to planning, mobilizing, deploying, executing, and\nsustaining U.S. military operations on a global basis. Mission Assurance is a\nprocess to ensure that assigned tasks or duties can be performed in\naccordance with the intended purpose or plan. It is made more difficult\ndue to increased interconnectivity and interdependency of systems and\nnetworks. DON critical infrastructures, both physical and cyber, even if\ndegraded, must be available to meet the requirements of multiple,\ndynamic, and divergent missions.”\n\n“Major ship systems may be impacted by SCADA network attacks ashore and\nafloat. This may impact a ship’s ability to start or stop engines remotely\ndisabling portions of the propulsion system and other engineering systems.”\n\nNavy TACMEMO NWDC 3-56.1-12\n\nWhich ICS receive greater focus for security efforts will depend in most cases on what missions\nthey support. The 262d Network Warfare Squadron (262 NWS) defines this as the “criticality”\nof the system component whereby lesser systems may receive little to no focus while very\ncritical and centralized systems are recommended to be hardened and protected significantly.\nAn example might be where it is impossible to protect every component on a network; focus\nwould be on critical servers, in essence accepting the risk of an individual personal computer\ncompromise so long as it can be isolated and secure operation of the critical server maintained.\n\nBut even on a given installation mission priorities—and the importance of the supporting\ncontrol systems—can change quickly and without advance notice. Consider the following\nhypothetical scenario highlighting such a rapid change.\n\nDaedalus Air Force Base’s primary mission is undergraduate pilot training.\nFlight operations are essential to this training. Flight operations depend\non, among other things, a well-managed fuels system and properly\nfunctioning airfield lighting—both systems controlled by ICS. Therefore\nsecuring the lighting and fuels ICS networks will be a priority over, for\nexample, automobile traffic control systems elsewhere on the installation.\nAt 1430 on Thursday, a terrorist incident results in declaration of Force\nProtection Condition (FPCON) DELTA. At 1431 the primary mission of the\ninstallation dramatically shifts from UPT to defense (of people,\ninfrastructure, and physical assets). ICS that are essential now include\nvehicular traffic control (not so critical under FPCON ALPHA) and\nemergency services (including camera systems, alarms, door controls, EMS\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\nand fire department dispatch, etc.). As a result of the incident, one of the\nICS was damaged. The ICS maintainer is a commercial contractor whose\nfacilities are not on the base. The contractor has backups of the ICS\noperating system, programs and data, but all are at the contractor facility\noff base. Because of the elevated FPCON, the contractor cannot enter the\nbase. CE can provide some limited manual operation of the system, but is\nneither capable nor prepared to operate at even 50% efficiency and\neffectiveness.\n\nIs the installation prepared for departures from the norm where ICS are part of the equation?\nDo the various existing installation plans (incident response, disaster recovery, installation\nemergency management, etc.) encompass ICS contingencies and emergencies? If so, have such\ncontingencies been exercised (not simply “white-carded” during an exercise)? These are some\nof the considerations that will prove foundational to identifying ICS security priorities relative to\nmissions and changing mission priorities.\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Mapping Mission Assurance to ICS\n\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\n##### MISSION IMPACT\n\nKey Point:\n\n  - If an element of the ICS and/or controlled infrastructure is compromised, critical mission\nfunctions may be degraded or even entirely failed.\n\nFor any installation commander, mission assurance is of utmost concern. Anything that may\nimpact the mission rises to the top of the priority list. ICS and the controlled critical\ninfrastructure are deemed to be mission enablers; damage to or compromise of ICS can\ndegrade, compromise, or even deny the mission. With mission assurance foremost in mind,\nthis handbook provides the installation commander with a generalized approach to eliminate,\nminimize, or otherwise mitigate risks to the mission as posed by ICS vulnerabilities.\n\nIt is important to note that this handbook does not attempt to achieve a level of specificity that\naddresses vulnerabilities of specific products from specific vendors in specific applications. Nor\ndoes it capture the range of threat actors who may be seeking to exploit those vulnerabilities.\nSuch level of specificity must be addressed on a case-by-case basis under the collaborative\nefforts of the installation commander, CEs or PWs, communications element, and mission\noperations representatives, and, in some cases, external experts. Specifically for the threat\npiece of the equation, intelligence and/or law enforcement entities also must be consulted.\n\nIt is vitally important to understand that some mission-impacting vulnerabilities can be created\nat nodes where it may not be intuitively obvious. For example, consider a fuels control system\ndirectly supporting an operational mission. If this mission is assessed as high-priority, then the\nfuels control system (i.e., ICS) merits a commensurately high priority for defensive measures\nand may in fact be well defended. However there may be interconnections from non-missionrelated systems linked back into those that are critical, opening paths of access to even\ndefended nodes. For instance, there may be an unclassified IT network connection to the\nvehicle traffic control system, which in turn has a connection to the EMS management system,\nwhich in turn has a connection into the fuels management system. To discover which control\nsystems may present vulnerabilities to the mission requires following the trail (virtually,\nlogically, and physically) of all nodes and elements and their potential connections[12] as well as\nactual ones.\n\nThe probability of a threat actor finding and traversing all such interconnections to create\nnegative effects on the mission may not be high at a given moment, but threat actors\n\n12 “Connection” includes wired network, wireless, radio, modem, USB port, Ethernet port….anything that enables\none element to connect to another.\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\ncontinuously develop more advanced skills.[13] Though current probability of a successful attack\nmay not be high, the advanced skill sets available to malicious actors combined with more\nfreely available advanced exploitation tools, many of which are created with ICS attack\ncomponents or even specifically for ICS, make this a serious threat. No system or sub-system\ncan be overlooked or assumed secure simply because it appears isolated. It is important to also\nnote that a vulnerability and risk assessment should consider not just primary effects on a\nsystem, but potential second—and even third—order effects. Succinctly stated, an ICS\nvulnerability and risk assessment should be supported by a thorough mission effects\nassessment.\n\nPrioritization of defense measures and resource allocation requires more than a one-to-one\nmatching with missions, but rather needs to be approached comprehensively. There is added\ncomplexity created by Joint Base administration\n\n“The purpose of the Air Force’s Critical\n\nwhere one Service’s primary mission likely is\n\nInfrastructure Program (CIP) is to ensure Air\nForce’s ability to execute missions and capabilities not the same as that of the other Services.\nthat are essential to planning, mobilizing, Take for example a fuel delivery control system\ndeploying, executing, and sustaining military on a Joint Base hosting both Air Force and Army\noperations on a global basis.”\n\nmissions. For efficiency and cost savings, the\n\nAir Force Energy Plan 2010 (p. 19) fuels delivery systems and automated control\n\nmay be consolidated. Hypothetically, for this\ninstallation the Air Force’s primary mission may be to launch sorties providing defense of the\nNorth American airspace while the Army’s may be to train vehicle maintenance and repair. If\nthe Army is lead agent for the Joint Base, do they consider the fuels system as the top priority\nICS to protect? How will this be decided where three or all Services are included in a Joint Base\nstructure? Such questions underscore the imperative for a comprehensive approach.\n\n##### THE MOST SECURE ICS\n\nKey Points:\n\n  - No ICS is 100% secure 100% of the time.\n\n  - Misconceptions � undetected or neglected vulnerabilities � unmanaged risk.\n\n13 For example, the ICS-CERT in Alert 12-046-01, February 2012, stated: “ICS-CERT is monitoring and responding to\nan increase in a combination of threat elements that increase the risk of control system attacks. These elements\ninclude Internet accessible configurations, vulnerability and exploit tool releases for ICS devices, and increased\ninterest and activity by hacktivist groups and others.”\n\n16\n\n\n-----\n\nAn absolutely 100% vulnerability-free, risk-free ICS does not exist and likely will not. To be\nnearly invulnerable,[14] an ICS must not be connected to anything other than its own\ninfrastructure elements. There also must be no potential method for external connections:\nUSB ports, Ethernet ports, wireless access points, satellite radio, modems, etc. Additionally,\nthere would have to be unassailable physical controls. However, vendors often need real-time\naccess to the infrastructure, and operators cannot be in all places all the time, which typically is\nmitigated by remote access capability. Also, the ICS manufacturing industry favors connectivity\nespecially for vendor maintenance. Further complicating the security task is DOD’s “green”\nmandate to convert the electric infrastructure to the “Smart Grid,” which depends on wireless\nconnectivity.[15]\n\nThe following “Top ICS Security Misconceptions” were presented in “318 OSS/IN SCADA Threat\nAssessment Report”.[16] Note that this list reflects ideas at a point in time and then only the top\nfive are presented; there are other relevant misconceptions, and all will most certainly change\nover time. The point is simply that there is widespread misunderstanding about ICS security\nand that such misunderstanding can result in a less-than-secure system. For brevity, the\n“misconceptions” have been edited but retain the essential message of each as presented in\nthe original report:\n\n  - Misconception 1: ICS & SCADA Systems Have a Secure Software Profile.\nDiscussion: Systems that manage the delivery of critical resources should be viewed as one of\nthe nation’s top security priorities. ICS has not yet achieved the same level of security concern\nas other cyber or IT resources. ICS typically are installed with availability as the primary driver\nand then operating efficiency and cost-effectiveness as secondary imperatives; robust security\ntypically is an after-thought and sometimes not considered at all.\n\n  - Misconception 2: ICS & SCADA Systems are Monitored by IT Professionals.\nDiscussion: To those not directly involved it may seem that ICS falls under purview of the IT\nexperts, but that typically is not the case. Most often CEs or PWs are responsible for not only\nthe hardware elements of the infrastructure, but also the software and communications\n\n14 Complete invulnerability is unachievable especially where the human element is necessary—thus the insider\nthreat is always a potential.\n15 For example, “demand-response” management by the EMCS connecting to any load (fuels, lighting, HVAC,\nwhatever, wherever, whenever) depends on dedicated Internet connectivity. Military installations are\nimplementing smart grid technology as microgrids. On the other hand and more optimistically there are a number\nof initiatives to enhance security for new (not legacy, though) systems such as the Advanced Metering\nInfrastructure (AMI).\n16 Classified report published June 2012. Portions reproduced here are marked unclassified in the source report.\n\n17\n\n\n-----\n\n(network) components. While many engineers receive IT training it is often not as extensive as\nfor an IT professional, and typically centers on operational rather than security aspects.\n\n  - Misconception 3: All ICS Systems are Air-Gapped and Therefore Secure.\nDiscussion: Not only is this not true (and actually never was even when most systems were\nisolated), but more and more systems that were air-gapped are being connected. Even airgapped[17] systems are vulnerable, as demonstrated acutely by Stuxnet. Typically air-gapped\nsystems still have connectable access points, such as the USB drive in the Stuxnet case.\nAdditionally, when upgrades are made they may be by a CD that has not been properly scanned\nfor viruses or by a vendor plugging an unscanned laptop into an Ethernet port. Not only is “air\ngapped” not necessarily secure, but dangerously can create a false sense of security (lends to\nthe “security by obscurity” fallacy). Yet another facet of this is that the “isolated” system often\nis overlooked or even intentionally ignored during security audits that focus on the IT or\nnetwork elements.\n\n  - Misconception 4: ICS & SCADA Systems are Physically Secure.\nDiscussion: Perhaps most of those directly under control of DOD are physically secure (though\nthat has been shown to be false numerous times), but those not under DOD control are less\nlikely to be secure, at least to DOD standards. The Government Accountability Office (GAO)\nestimates that 85% of energy infrastructure is “outside the fence” and that 99% of DOD’s\nenergy needs are met by commercial providers. Physical security (or lack thereof) does not end\nat the fence. In other words, no matter how physically secure the installation may be there are\nstill external risks to be addressed. DOD dependence on commercial owners and providers\ndemands a teaming approach to physical security.\n\n  - Misconception 5: Proprietary Protocols Offer Security Through Obscurity.\nDiscussion: “Proprietary” serves as an impediment only to those operating legally and ethically,\nand to a certain extent unsophisticated bad actors (only because they had not yet acquired the\nskills). To the experienced hacker and state-sponsored actor, protocols are discoverable and\nexploitable. There even have been web-published revelations of proprietary protocols by socalled independent researchers.\n\nMisconceptions abound; therefore security may never be assumed or taken for granted. Any\ngiven installation’s “most secure” ICS is fundamentally a function of continuous risk assessment\nand management relative to given missions and situationally-dependent mission priorities.\n\n17 “Air Gap” refers to having no electronic connection, requiring data to be moved “by hand” from one system to\nanother via media such as USB drives, CDs, etc.\n\n18\n\n\n-----\n\nContinuous awareness is key to recognizing vulnerabilities early and committing necessary\nresources to manage potential risks. Proactivity is fundamental.\n\n##### RISK ASSESSMENT & MANAGEMENT\n\nKey Point:\n\n  - Risk management is a continuous process.\n\nRisk is a function of the interaction among threat,[18] vulnerability, and consequence (or mission\nimpact). Risk management involves a process of understanding each element of the equation,\nhow those elements interact, and how to respond to the assessed risk. Every installation will\nface an ever-changing threat-vulnerability-consequence equation. SMEs within DOD,\nDepartment of Energy (DOE), and industry agree that even the most secure network has, or will\nhave, inherent vulnerabilities. Therefore risk management is essential and must be a\ncontinuous process rather than an event that takes place annually, quarterly, or even monthly.\nRisk management is not only continuous but is situational based on the relative uniqueness of\neach ICS infrastructure. Appendix F provides examples of risk assessment models.\n\n##### FRAMEWORK FOR SUCCESSFUL ICS DEFENSE\n\nKey Point:\n\n  - ICS defense is a team effort.\n\nWhile there is no DOD, Joint, or Service policy or directive specific to creating a security\nprogram for installation ICS, numerous publications do provide some guidance and address\nelements of ICS security. The following “best practice” framework is derived from such\nguidance.\n\n1. Appoint a full-time ICS Information Assurance Manager (IAM) specifically for installation\ncontrol systems (i.e., distinct from an IT IAM).[19] As an on-going coordinator of a team\nformed in the next step, the ICS IAM[20] will be responsible specifically for ICS and should\nfunction directly under the authority of the installation commander.\n\n18 “Threat” is further deconstructed into capability + intent + opportunity.\n19 Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 11-1, released Mar 2011 by [then] HQ AFCESA/CEO, requires USAF CEs at base\nlevel to appoint both primary and alternate IAMs with a focus on certification & accreditation (C&A) of all CEmanaged ICS. Note that AFCESA became AFCEC, of AF Civil Engineer Center, in October 2012.\n20 The ICS IAM should be officially designated, trained for the position, and delegated authority to immediately\naddress issues within a defined sphere of responsibility. The ICS IAM should not be an additional-duty position.\n\n19\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Form an ICS security team led by the ICS IAM. Securing installation ICS networks cannot\nbe fully accomplished by any single individual or necessarily by any single base entity\n(such as CEs or PWs typically considered “owners” of the infrastructure). Securing the\nICS and reducing risk to mission must be a team effort. This team of authoritative\nexperts should represent at least the CEs/PWs, the cyber unit, physical security, OPSEC,\nand missions operations. Engineers can inform the “what” and “where”; the cyber or\ncommunications experts can provide the “how”; and the mission representatives can\nexplain the “why” as well as the consequences of failure. Intelligence producers can\nhelp understand the “who” that represents the threat. The installation commander sets\npriorities in the form of “when” and makes the critical decisions on commitment and\nallocation of resources and assets. Include other stakeholders as appropriate to the\ninstallation and mission set, such as when there are tenant organizations (e.g., hospital)\nwhose missions may be distinct, but still rely on the installation ICS infrastructure.[21]\nConsider creating also as a sub-element of this team an ICS-Computer Emergency\nResponse Team (CERT),[22] modeled on that led by Department of Homeland Security\n(DHS).[23] If a network CERT already resides on the installation, coordinate to include ICS.\n3. Direct the ICS security team in identifying existing and/or developing new policies with\nrespect to key elements of the ICS security program.\n4. Promulgate policies and concurrently hold training sessions on the policies for all ICS\nusers, operators, and maintainers (analogous: IA training for anyone who touches a\nnetwork).\n5. Implement policies and hold individuals accountable for adherence.\n6. Assess effectiveness of measures undertaken (i.e., conduct risk analysis, exercise, red\nteam, or/and tabletop review).\n7. Monitor and adjust as needed.\n\nLast resort: An IT IAM could have ICS added to their “job jar” but should receive additional training specific to ICS.\nReference also ETL 11-1.\n21 (USAF) SAF/CIO A6, in a Memo dated 20 March 2012 (mandatory compliance) instructed installations to create a\nmulti-disciplined Integrated Product Team (IPT) comprised of all stakeholders to assess IA of PIT, which includes\ncontrol systems.\n22 CERT = Cyber Emergency Response Team.\n23 The DHS ICS-CERT website is found at http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/ics-cert/\n\n20\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. The ICS Security Team\n\n\n21\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ICS SECURITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS\n\nKey Point:\n\n  - Must begin with missions analysis and prioritization.\n\nThe following eight-step process is the heart of this handbook. All other included information\nis in support of preparing for and understanding the criticality of the assessment process. Best\npractice is to follow the steps as presented, but individual circumstances may warrant reversing\nsome steps and or accomplishing some in parallel. However approached, Step 1 must always\nbe accomplished first.\n\nWhile virtually every major entity engaged in ICS defense recommends some version of a “best”\nprocess for risk assessment and management, no two approaches are exactly the same. For\nexample OPNAVINST 3500.39C on Operational Risk Management presents a 5-step process.[24]\nThe approach presented here was developed by ICS SMEs working on the National SCADA Test\nBed at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and fits well with a DOD military installation focus.\n\nIn association with Step 7 of the process there is also a companion checklist of specific actions\nto consider. That checklist is found at Attachment 2 and is introduced by a textual section titled\n“Recommended Defense Actions.”\n\nStep 1. Mission analysis. For ICS defense, the task is to establish a baseline understanding\namong the stakeholders of the missions relative to the support infrastructure (both IT and\nICS). A key product of this first step is a prioritization of missions that can be linked to\nassets and then ICS dependencies. Key question: If I have to devote all of my very limited\nresources to protecting one mission, what would that be? Then the one after that?\nApplying Mission Assurance Category (MAC) levels[25] can be useful to this endeavor. Also\nincluded may be a review of Mission Essential Tasks (MET)[26] with reference to the Defense\nReadiness Reporting System (DRRS). Mission analysis and decomposition, especially to a\ngranularity useful to the rest of the steps, likely will not be a trivial process and may require\nsignificant commitment of the resource of time. A solid investment of time at this step will\nmake the follow-on steps easier to accomplish.\n\n24 The OPNAVINST 5-step ORM process: Identify, Asses, Make decisions, Implement controls and Supervise,\nremembered by the mnemonic “I AM IS”.\n25 MAC definitions found in the Glossary.\n26 MET examples in Appendix I.\n\n22\n\n\n-----\n\nStep 2. Identify assets. This includes not only direct mission assets (such as aircraft, tanks,\nships, etc.) but more pointedly the infrastructure systems (such as fuels management and\ndelivery) that support those. The key is to identify the thread from mission to asset to\nsupporting infrastructure to ICS dependencies. This thread will reveal which ICS systems\nare more critical when it comes to applying security controls.\n\n“As a network defender, it is critical to know how the network is laid out as well as\nthe hardware associated with the network. In order to defend SCADA, the\noperator needs to know what he or she has to work with.“\n\nAFTTP 3-1.CWO (para. 7.6.3.2)\n\nStep 3. Determine ICS connectivity. It is absolutely essential to identify every point of\nconnectivity because the greatest vulnerability is at any point of connection. While\nNIPRNet connectivity may take top tier on the list, any connectivity—whether currently\nconnected or could be connected later—must be identified. To leave even one potential\nconnection undiscovered possibly is to leave the entire network[27] vulnerable. Running a\nscan on the network elements will identify only what is connected and on at the moment\nof the scan. This is a key reason for conducting a physical inventory as well, setting eyes on\nany and every potential connection capability. A PLC may be inside a locked cabinet inside\na fenced compound with armed guards at a gate, but if it has an Ethernet port it is\nconnectible (e.g., for vendor maintenance) and therefore, is a potential risk.\n\nStep 4. Determine ICS dependencies. Which missions and their supporting infrastructure\nare dependent on a properly functioning control system? Are multiple control systems\ninvolved (as in the earlier example of traffic control, emergency systems, fuels delivery)?\nThis step also requires technical network mapping typically coupled with a physical\ninventory and an operational-level understanding of the missions. See Attachment 1,\nMapping Interdependencies, for an example methodology. A comprehensive approach to\nthis must be followed with collaboration among representatives from at least the cyber,\nengineering, and mission operations communities.\n\nStep 5. Assess risk. Risk is characterized as an outcome of the interaction among threat,\nvulnerability, and consequence. The goal is to gain a clear understanding of actual risks\nthat can be managed. All stakeholders need to be engaged in every step of this entire\nprocess, but here is where collaboration becomes absolutely essential. Intelligence\n\n27 Arguably extreme, but since we do not know what we do not know (in this example) one is left contemplating\n“worst case.”\n\n23\n\n\n-----\n\nanalysts help identify external threats; engineer, PWs, and comm/IT specialists provide\nunderstanding of the control infrastructure and its vulnerabilities; and operations\npersonnel can define the mission consequences or impacts of a realized threat event.\nNumerous risk analysis publications and external organizations are available to assist with\nthis step.\n\nStep 6. Prioritize risk management actions. Risk management typically entails deciding\namong a finite list of response options: avoid, share/transfer, mitigate, or accept. A\nresponse option or course of action (COA) typically is selected based on what is feasible,\npractical, and affordable (i.e., a cost-benefit analysis relative to mission impact). In most\ncases the commander, decides on a COA and then prioritizes commitment of resources to\naccomplish the actions.\n\nStep 7. Implement actions.  This step requires systematic implementation however\nsimple or complex. At the minimum, one must identify the typical who is to do what,\nwhere, and when, i.e., direction, responsibility, accountability, and resources available. The\nsine qua non of implementation is commitment of resources combined with accountability\nmechanisms.\n\nStep 8. Monitor, and reenter the cycle as required. This is never a “fire and forget”\nactivity. Any (even trivial) change to an architecture can introduce new vulnerabilities\n(emphasizing also the imperative to institute a configuration control process). Additionally,\nthreat actors are continuously on the hunt for vulnerabilities not yet discovered by\nlegitimate owners and operators. To maintain a steady state of security requires\ncontinuous monitoring. Furthermore, implementation of any plan is likely to encounter\nimpediments. This will be the phase or step to identify those and readjust as necessary.\nThe success of this step depends on existence of feedback processes and mechanisms,\nwhich should have been implemented already.\n\n24\n\n\n-----\n\n##### SOFTWARE TOOLS\n\nKey Point:\n\n  - Tools can be good or bad.\n\n  - Even a “good” tool is only as good as the expert who uses it.\n\nFor many steps in the process of assessing and defending security of ICS, there exists a broad\nselection of supporting primarily software tools. At the installation command level, it is\nimportant simply to note that while such tools are available, tools alone will not guarantee a\nsuccessful defensive posture of ICS. The human element is essential in every step.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing to understand about software tools used with or on any ICS\nis that the tool must not affect the operation of the ICS or, more specifically, the infrastructure\nit controls. The most important thing to do with respect to software tools is to defer to IT SMEs\nwho already have a set of approved tools and understand potential impacts of using those tools\non particular networks.\n\nBecause the services provided by critical infrastructure (electricity heading the list) must always\nbe available, the ICS likewise must be always available. Therefore, any software-based\nassessment or forensics action upon or through the ICS must not impede, deny, or otherwise\nalter the system, the data throughput, or the services supported.\n\nBecause of the necessity of maintaining availability, due diligence must be exercised if\nconsidering use of traditional IT tools (scanners, penetration testers, etc.) on ICS networks.\nSome IT tools introduce negative effects on the ICS as well as on the controlled infrastructure.\nExamples are plentiful. The NIST SP 800-82 (p. 3-22) relates one such example:\n\n“A natural gas utility hired an IT security consulting organization to conduct\npenetration testing on its corporate IT network. The consulting\norganization carelessly ventured into a part of the network that was\ndirectly connected to the SCADA system. The penetration test locked up\nthe SCADA system and the utility was not able to send gas through its\npipelines for four hours. The outcome was the loss of service to its\ncustomer base for those four hours.”\n\nWhile significant to those customers, this is trivial compared to impacts on national defense\nmissions. For example, consider potential consequences if the same action involved an ICS\nsupporting fuels management for a combat flying mission or life support systems at a hospital.\n\n25\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n\nKey Point:\n\n  - Outside help is available—and much of it is at no cost to the requestor.\n\nDue primarily to the ever-changing nature of the ICS security landscape, published guidance\ntends to quickly become obsolete. Fortunately, beyond the array of formal publications there\nexists a helpful offering of additional useful resources. For example:\n\n  - Numerous web sites provide detailed information on ICS security issues, current threats,\ntools, etc. Some of the more prominent are provided as Appendix B, Web Links.\n\n  - Students at the Services’ advanced Professionally Military Education (PME) schools can\nbe exceptionally good sources for current insights as many engage in fresh research and\nproduce theses specific to emerging ICS/SCADA issues.\n\n  - Industry conferences can be exceptional sources of lessons learned and/or best\npractices, as well as provide opportunity to network with experts.\n\n  - Finally, establishing a close relationship with local critical infrastructure owners (e.g., the\nelectric power company, water provider, etc.) can yield better understanding of local\nthreats and risks, and thus better security for the entire community.\n\nFor current threat assessment information, sources may include: Air Force Office of Special\nInvestigations (AFOSI), the Army Criminal Investigative Division (CID), or other Service\nequivalent; intelligence analysts (the J2/A2/G2 shop); and the ICS-CERT’s Alerts and Warnings.\n\n##### ICS SECURITY ACTIONS\n\nKey Point:\n\n  - Use this with Step 7 of the Process and with the tabular checklist provided as\n\nAttachment 2.\n\nThe following section presents a series of action recommendations for securing ICS. Numerous\nentities, to include DOD, DOE, Commerce Department, and commercial vendors have published\nsimilar lists (see the “References” appendix for some of those). These recommendations are\naugmented by the “stand-alone” tabular checklist found at Attachment 2, and most\nappropriately considered at Step 7 of the “Security Assessment Process.”\n\nThe recommendations that follow are in an outline that follows the familiar doctrine,\norganization, training, materiel, leadership & education, personnel, facilities, and policy\n\n26\n\n\n-----\n\nDOTMLPF-P[28] framework[29] but with minor modification. The two modifications are that (1)\ndoctrine (D) is not directly addressed[30] while (2) cyber security (C) has been added, resulting in\na COTMLPF-P framework that exists only in this publication. “Cyber security” is used here to\ndistinguish between those measures taken in, on and/or through the network(s) and those\nactions of a more or less physical nature (such as using access control lists). Arguably the most\ncritical set of security measures, cyber security is addressed last because such measures are\nmost effective when supported by solid implementation of actions in the other areas and in\nparticular when guided by clear policy.\n\n##### RECOMMENDED ICS DEFENSE ACTIONS\n\nPOLICY\n\n“The development of the organization’s security policy is the first and most important step in\ndeveloping an organizational security program. Security policies lay the groundwork for\nsecuring the organization’s physical, enterprise, and control system assets.” [Catalog of Control\nSystems Security, DHS, Apr 2011, p. 4.] [emphasis added]\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA), in its “Securing SCADA and Control Systems” brochure\n(referring to Sandia National Lab’s Framework for SCADA Security Policy), states: “A Security\nPolicy defines the controls, behaviors, and expectations of users and processes, and lays the\ngroundwork for securing CS[31] assets. Since the acceptable use of CS is narrower and may have\nmore demanding operational requirements than IT systems, they also demand their own\nSecurity Policy.” [emphasis added]\n\nThe installation commander must establish authoritative and directive policies with regard to\nall other aspects of the ICS, thus the rationale for starting with the Policy area.\n\n28 DOTMLPF-P: doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership & education, personnel, facilities, and policy.\nThis is borrowed from Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3170.01H, Joint Capabilities Integration and\nDevelopment System (JCIDS); and further acknowledges DoDM 3020.45 Vol 2, Defense Critical Information\nProgram (DCIP) Remediation Planning, which states that remediation planning “shall consider a full range of…\n\n[DOTMLPF] options”.\n29 Examples of other frameworks: People, processes & technology; strategic, operational & tactical; management,\noperational & technical.\n30 Any action undertaken in any other area may lead to consideration of doctrinal change. However, this handbook\nfacilitates practical application and so intentionally does not directly address doctrine. Ultimately, best practices\nmay result in recommended changes to doctrine, requiring entering the JCIDS process.\n31 CS = NSA’s abbreviation for “control systems.”\n\n27\n\n\n-----\n\nPolicy Actions\n\n- Reuse policy where appropriate. Usually it is not necessary to start from scratch on every\npolicy. Many ICS security issues are also IT and/or IA issues. Many published IT and IA\npolicies may be adapted to ICS. Also, there is increasing promulgation of Service- and DODlevel policies specific to ICS (for example, Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency[32]\n\n[AFCESA]’s ETL 11-1).\n\n- Ensure policies are promulgated to the lowest user level, and require training programs to\naddress ICS policies.\n\n- With the ICS security team (discussed previously), determine which elements of the ICS\nrequire specific policies vs. those that may be combined into a single policy document.\nExamples:\n`o` An access control policy might include password management, physical facilities control,\nand connectivity controls.\n`o` A personnel security policy likely will warrant a dedicated policy document.\n\n- Once complete, the set of policies should address at minimum:\n`o` Access control\n`o` Inventory accounting\n`o` Security of physical assets\n`o` Configuration control\n`o` Acquisition of new hardware/software\n`o` Patching of operating systems and programs\n`o` Vendor / third-party roles and responsibilities\n`o` Conduct of vulnerability and risk assessments\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nMuch is subsumed in “leadership.” With regard to ICS security it is important that leadership\nremain engaged and that operators are confident there is a “top-down” emphasis on ICS\nsecurity. Promulgation of policy is a critical start, but ongoing leadership gives life to those\npolicies. Delegate requisite authority and demand accountability, but do not retreat from\noversight.\n\nLeadership Actions\n\n- Conduct periodic awareness briefings to ICS operators and users. Recommend including\nquarterly reminders of potential threats.\n\n32 In October 2012 AFCESA merged with AFCEE and AFRPA to become AFCEC, or Air Force Civil Engineer Center.\nETL 11-1 still validly exists as an AFCESA publication.\n\n28\n\n\n-----\n\n- Participate in ICS security stakeholder events, such as DOD conferences, industry group\nseminars, and on-line discussion forums.\n\n- Establish collaborative relationships with commercial service providers (electric, water, gas,\netc.), with focus on their security programs to secure the infrastructure beyond the\ninstallation fence. Invite them to training sessions as adjunct members of the security\nteam.\n\n- Identify and mitigate the conditions whereby reliance on vendors creates potential single\npoints of failure. Vendors often are the ones most familiar with installation systems, do not\nalways have immediate access to those systems, and at times can be denied access (such as\nduring elevating FPCONs).\n\n- Add ICS information to the Commander’s Critical Information List.\n\n- Engage in the ICS acquisition process from planning through installation; include upgrades\nto existing systems as well as new systems.\n\n- Develop plans where none exist or otherwise incorporate ICS into those that do. Examples:\n`o` System Security Plan (SSP)\n`o` Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)\n`o` Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)\n`o` Contingency Plans–ICS operation under various INFOCON, FPCON, and other\nemergencies\n`o` Operations Security self-assessments and surveys\n\nPERSONNEL\n\nThe human element is necessary for the successful operation of ICS, and therefore is a critical\narea. All individuals who operate, maintain, or otherwise access ICS must understand their\nrespective roles and responsibilities and be appropriately trained to those responsibilities. The\ninsider threat (legitimate operators with legitimate access but illegitimate intent) can overcome\nmost security controls. Even an “honest broker” can make a mistake that results in the same\n(or worse) impact on mission that a true threat actor can cause.\n\nPersonnel Actions\n\n- Ensure every individual is trained for their specific responsibilities and undergoes\nmandatory periodic update/refresher training (similar to IA training).\n\n- Enforce access controls and establish consequences for violations. For example, every\nindividual has a unique logon (best practice = role-based) and is allowed access only by that\nlogon (i.e., no “guest” accounts).\n\n29\n\n\n-----\n\n- Require special background checks on individuals who have access to ICS elements that are\ncritical to mission accomplishment. Consider requiring Secret clearances at least for those\nindividuals with access to mission-critical elements and/or who have full system\nadministration privileges.\n\n- Request ICS managers and operators to sign confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements.\nTreat ICS information at the very least as unclassified but sensitive.\n\n- Maintain rosters for physical access to facilities, such as rooms where servers are\nmaintained. Require sign-in/sign-out when accessed.\n\n- Create an ICS incident response team modeled on DHS’ ICS-CERT.\n\n- Ensure that personnel who resign, retire, or are fired do not have continued access to any\nelement of the ICS. Extend this vigilance to employees of contractors and vendors.\n\n- Ensure that relevant personnel (members of ICS security team, asset owners, etc.) either\nmonitor or routinely are made aware of new vulnerabilities and incidents published by ICSCERT and ICS component vendors.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTraining includes formal, informal, and exercise. Many negative incidents involving ICS, the\ncontrolled infrastructure, and/or the missions they support are attributed to legitimate\noperators who made mistakes due to training deficiencies. A systematic program of mandatory\ntraining should be implemented for all managers, operators, and other users of the installation\ncontrol systems.\n\nTraining Actions\n\n- Ensure all operators (at minimum) have had ICS-specific training prior to granting access to\nany element or component.\n\n- Require IA and OPSEC training for every individual accessing ICS computer systems even if\n\nthose systems are not directly connected to the IT network. This training must also include\ncontractors and vendors who only sometimes connect to ICS computer systems.\n\n- Provide threat and vulnerability awareness via appropriate forums, unit security awareness\ntraining, workplace bulletin boards, etc.\n\n- Exercise plans (incident response, disaster recovery, continuity of operations, etc). Include\nwith other installation exercises where practicable and include ICS-related scenarios under\nelevating INFOCON and/or FPCON.\n\n- Document all training and ensure each individual maintains currency.\n\n30\n\n\n-----\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nIn many cases ICS tend to be “out-of-sight, out-of-mind” to all installation personnel but the CE\nor PW personnel. As long as the lights are on, water is running, and gates function properly\nthere is no need to be concerned with the systems that make that true. The downside of this\nview is that it creates a dampening effect on responsibility and accountability for the total ICS\ninfrastructure. While PW/CE accept “ownership” responsibility for the control system field\nelements, anecdotal information is that the IT side often is viewed as entirely under purview of\nthe IT organization.  Conversely, in some cases IT considers the entirety of the ICS network,\nincluding the front-end IT elements, as CE’s responsibility.[33] The ICS must be considered as a\nmission-critical system of systems and treated as such organizationally, with collaboration\namong CE, IT, and the operations’ stakeholders. Ill-defined division of labor (responsibility) can\ncreate gaps that become threat vectors, or the trade-space of threat actors (both internal and\nexternal).\n\nOrganization Actions\n\n- Create a position for an ICS IAM with functional authority and direct access to the\ninstallation commander. Ensure the IAM’s participation in key venues to provide\ncommander advocacy for ICS security and awareness.\n\n- Clarify (and document on command relationship charts) roles and responsibilities of PW/CE,\ncommunications, operations (and other stakeholders as appropriate) with respect to\noperation, maintenance, and security of installation ICS.\n\n- Fully document the ICS—hardware, software, firmware, connectivity, and physical locations\nof all. Create a topology or ICS system map reflecting connections to supported missions\nand a logic diagram depicting all information/data flows.\n\n- Assign responsibility for ICS configuration management and control. May require creation\nof a configuration control board (CCB). The key is this entity documents configuration and\nmaintains continuing control over changes.\n\n- Identify the entity/individuals responsible for developing formal plans (continuity of\noperations, disaster recovery, etc.).\n\n- Establish roles and responsibilities with regard to third-party relationships.\n\n- Ensure all ICS users and operators understand the chain of command particularly for\nincident reporting and response mechanisms.\n\n33 On a more positive note, the Air Force has made progress in resolving this issue. Implementation typically lags\npolicy and direction but four key publications have been promulgated beginning in early 2011: SAF/CIO A6 memo\nof Feb 2011 appointing Designated Accrediting Authority for PIT (includes ICS); SAF/CIO A6 memo (Feb 2011)\ndelegating Certifying Authority to AFCESA/CEO; AFCESA’s ETL 11-1 (Mar 2011) which deals with ICS information\nassurance; and SAF/CIO A6 guidance memo (AFGM2.2, Mar 2012) addressing IA of all PIT and announcing\ncommensurate changes to AFI 33-210.\n\n31\n\n\n-----\n\nFACILITIES\n\nWhile some elements of the controlled infrastructure are of necessity exposed (for example the\nwires of the electric power grid, pipelines for natural gas) most of the control system elements\nare housed in facilities ranging from guarded buildings to remote access panels. Each type of\nfacility engenders its own relatively unique security challenges, but all share the dichotomous\nrequirement to ensure that legitimate users can gain quick access when necessary while at the\nsame time exclude everyone else from any access whatsoever.\n\nFacilities Actions\n\n- Physically identify and visually inspect every facility that houses any element of the ICS,\n\nhowever seemingly insignificant. This includes fenced enclosures, buildings, rooms in\nbuildings, field huts, lockboxes, panels, etc. Often overlooked but must be included in\n“facilities” are the physical connections (e.g., coaxial cable, digital subscriber line (DSL), fiber\noptics, telephone lines). On large installations it is especially important to identify, inspect,\nand secure any facility near the perimeter fence (where feasible, relocate away from\nperimeter).\n\n- Ensure that cabling terminations and their housings are not overlooked. Threats can come\nfrom cutting, splicing, tapping, and/or intercepting.\n\n- Develop a plan of action and milestones (POA&M) for addressing physical security\ndeficiencies. An extremely high level of physical security may be achieved by placing\ncameras, alarms, and armed guards on every facility. However, this typically is neither\npractical nor cost-efficient. Focus should be on those ICS that are critical to the missions,\nand then emphasizing where the control system is most exposed to risk. Feasibility,\npracticality, and expense all will temper selected COAs.\n\n- Create a map of the facilities and the assets housed by each. Use in training, exercises, and\nactual incident response.\n\n- Ensure portable equipment (e.g., laptops) that may be in storage until required (for\nbackups, recovery, etc.) is included in the inventory and security measures.\n\n- Consider an OPSEC survey focused on ICS. In any event, OPSEC measures should be applied\nto appropriate elements.\n\nMATERIEL\n\nConsider how physical assets are acquired, maintained, and removed from service. Does policy\nor other guidance exist? Historically control systems have had a life cycle measured in decades\nas opposed to IT, which has a life cycle of three years or less. One outcome is that components\nthat have built-in vulnerabilities can remain in the network for years, often without those\n\n32\n\n\n-----\n\nvulnerabilities and their attendant risks being addressed. Replacement and maintenance of ICS\nshould be approached strategically (i.e., long-term) as well as tactically and operationally.\n\nMateriel Actions\n\n- Assign responsibility for oversight of the physical assets to a configuration control manager\nor board.\n\n- Establish a formal process for acquisition of new components.\n\n- Operationally test (including vulnerability assessment) proposed new components off-line\nbefore introducing into the live network. Collaborate with the National SCADA Test Bed\n(NSTB) entities (INL, Sandia National Laboratory [SNL]) to test components in “live” and\nsimulated environments.\n\n- Treat adjunct materials (software, tech manuals, SOPs, plans, schematics, etc.) with the\nsame level of security as the ICS.\n\n33\n\n\n-----\n\nCYBER SECURITY\n\nCyber security for ICS is in many respects the same as for IT. Most front-end elements (e.g.,\nservers, operating systems, human-machine interfaces, connectivity) are in fact information\ntechnology elements. On the other hand, since most non-IT components typically are on a 1520 year refresh (replacement) cycle and are tied to the operating system with which they\noriginally were installed, even the IT elements can “age-out” or become unsupported making\ncyber security at the front end more challenging. Differences from IT become more distinct\n“downstream” in the system, with RTUs, PLCs, and of course the field mechanisms (sensors,\ngauges, etc.) interfaced directly with the controlled infrastructure. Cyber security applies to all\nthose elements because they are still part of the network. Nearly every component in the\nsystem could provide a threat vector into the network. Of primary concern is connectivity\nfrom/into NIPRNet and/or any segment of the GIG, but any connection into the system must be\nconsidered as creating a risk to the DOD missions of the installation.\n\n“Asset owners should not assume that their control systems are secure or that\nthey are not operating with an Internet accessible configuration. Instead, asset\nowners should thoroughly audit their networks for Internet facing devices, weak\nauthentication methods, and component vulnerabilities.”\n\nICS CERT-ALERT-12-046-01 (Feb 2012)\n\nThis section reflects more actions, and more of them technology-based, than the other\n(D)OTMLPF-P areas. However, in spite of the expansion of information this listing should not be\nviewed as absolutely complete, finite, or prescriptive. Existing policies and procedures already\nin place and proven effective should not be replaced based solely on this listing. Consult other\npublications (see References), engage the IT and IA professionals, seek assistance/advice from\nother government-related ICS experts, and consider contracting for assessment services from\ncommercial providers.\n\nCyber Security Actions\n\n- Define and defend perimeters. “Defense in depth” is an operative phrase often\nencountered. Strategic approaches include creating enclaves, segmentation, and\nestablishing demilitarized zones (DMZ), typically using firewalls. NSA, DHS, and others\nrecommend total isolation of ICS networks but that is not always possible or practical.\nWhere some connectivity is required, at least secure the points where connection can be\nmade.\n\n- Control web access. Where Internet or NIPRNet connectivity is required limit access to the\nweb by turning off unnecessary web services and ports, and consider using “white” and/or\n\n34\n\n\n-----\n\n“black” lists of allowed/not allowed sites. (Note: Whitelisting is often preferred over\nblacklisting.)\n\n- Protect data. Encrypt mission-critical data in transmission and provide backups or other\nredundancies for data in stasis (files, databases, etc.). As a caveat, downstream data such\nas between a PLC and a field device cannot be encrypted.\n\n- Protect the operating system. Perimeter defense is a good start, but threat actors (insiders,\nfor example) can find ways inside the perimeter. Use defensive tools[34] (software) such as\nfor intrusion detection. Implement and update virus-checking software (may need to do\nmanually if not connected). Establish a patching protocol (typically requires testing off-line\nfirst). Enable audit logging, and review the logs frequently to detect anomalous (especially\nillegitimate) activity. Also, remove all services, programs, etc. not needed for operation of\nthe ICS.\n\n- Manage installation of new assets. Ensure hardware and software factory default or\ncontractor-enabled settings are changed. Do not allow anything that is\nconnected/connectable, new or legacy, to be accessed using default passwords. Vendors\nprefer to maintain defaults especially on field devices (e.g., PLCs) for ease of maintenance\naccess. Those same defaults typically are publically accessible, often published on vendor\ncompany web sites, and will be used by threat actors.\n\n- Disable every connection point not needed. Points include USB ports, wireless access\npoints, Ethernet jacks, satellite receivers, modems, etc. Provide positive control over all\nremaining points, ensuring no “backdoor” exists. Even one unguarded USB port can provide\na devastating threat vector. This point is demonstrated by the publically reported outcome\nof the Stuxnet infection of an Iranian nuclear processing facility’s centrifuge control system.\n\n- Control individual access to all elements. The operating system server and workstations are\nobvious control points but some field elements such as PLCs can (and do) have separate\nlogons. There are a number of operational and tactical actions to take, selectively or\ncollectively. Foremost is to require each individual to have a unique (unshared) logon ID\nand password.[35] Policy should strictly prohibit shared passwords. Institute least-privilege\nand role-based access. Absolutely nothing should be accessible via “guest” or anonymous\naccounts, in spite of very plausible rationale for such given by vendors. Administrator\nprivileges should be given to vendors only as required and then closely monitored.\n\n34 Discussed elsewhere, but a reminder is warranted: Be cautious with software tools. Some very effective tools\nfor IT networks can cause problems on ICS. Typically, passivity is the key characteristic. Tools that interact with\nthe system, such as for intrusion protection mostly, are to be avoided. If an interactive tools is determined to be\nnecessary it must first be tested off-line before use on ICS. Even if it “passes” the test, tools should be closely\nmonitored for unanticipated, undiscovered negative effects.\n35 Air Force is implementing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as widely as possible. Also, DoD-wide many logons are\naccomplished with a Common Access Card (CAC). Aside from the method of network access, the key takeaway is\nunique, linked to a vetted user, not shareable with anyone else.\n\n35\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5.

An adversary that possesses sophisticated levels of expertise and\nsignificant resources, which allow it to create opportunities to achieve its objectives by using\nmultiple attack vectors (e.g., cyber, physical, and deception). These objectives typically include\nestablishing and extending footholds within the information technology infrastructure of the\ntargeted organizations for purposes of exfiltrating information, undermining or impeding\ncritical aspects of a mission, program, or organization; or positioning itself to carry out these\nobjectives in the future. The advanced persistent threat: (i) pursues its objectives repeatedly\nover an extended period of time; (ii) adapts to defenders’ efforts to resist it; and (iii) is\ndetermined to maintain the level of interaction needed to execute its objectives. [NIST SP 80053 Rev 4]\n\n  - Advanced: The actor is adaptive and able to evade detection and is able to gain and\n\nmaintain access to protected networks and resident sensitive information.\n\n  - Persistent: The actor has a strong foothold in/on the target network and is\n\nexceptionally difficult to completely remove or deny even if detected.\n\n  - Threat: The actor has both capability and intent that is counter to the best interests of\n\nthe network and/or the legitimate users.\n\nAsset.

Applicable to DOD information systems, the mission\nassurance category reflects the importance of information relative to the achievement of DOD\n\n50\n\n\n-----\n\ngoals and objectives, particularly the warfighters' combat mission. Mission assurance\ncategories are primarily used to determine the requirements for availability and integrity. The\nDepartment of Defense has three defined mission assurance categories: [DODD 8500.01E]\n\n  - MAC I. Systems handling information that is determined to be vital to the operational\n\nreadiness or mission effectiveness of deployed and contingency forces in terms of both\ncontent and timeliness. The consequences of loss of integrity or availability of a MAC I\nsystem are unacceptable and could include the immediate and sustained loss of mission\neffectiveness. MAC I systems require the most stringent protection measures.\n\n  - MAC II. Systems handling information that is important to the support of deployed and\n\ncontingency forces. The consequences of loss of integrity are unacceptable. Loss of\navailability is difficult to deal with and can only be tolerated for a short time. The\nconsequences could include delay or degradation in providing important support\nservices or commodities that may seriously impact mission effectiveness or operational\nreadiness. MAC II systems require additional safeguards beyond best practices to\nensure adequate assurance.\n\n  - MAC III. Systems handling information that is necessary for the conduct of day-to-day\n\nbusiness, but does not materially affect support to deployed or contingency forces in\nthe short-term. The consequences of loss of integrity or availability can be tolerated or\novercome without significant impacts on mission effectiveness or operational readiness.\nThe consequences could include the delay or degradation of services or commodities\nenabling routine activities. MAC III systems require protective measures, techniques, or\nprocedures generally commensurate with commercial best practices.\n\nMission Essential Functions (MEF). The specified or implied tasks required to be performed by,\nor derived from, statute, Executive Order, or other appropriate guidance, and those\norganizational activities that must be performed under all circumstances to achieve DOD\ncomponent missions or responsibilities in a continuity threat or event.

[44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]\n\nPlatform Information Technology (PIT) and PIT-Interconnection (PITI). For DOD IA purposes,\nplatform IT interconnection refers to network access to platform IT. Platform IT\ninterconnection has readily identifiable security considerations and needs that must be\naddressed in both acquisition, and operations. Platform IT refers to computer resources, both\nhardware and software, that are physically part of, dedicated to, or essential in real time to the\nmission performance of special purpose systems such as weapons, training simulators,\ndiagnostic test and maintenance equipment, calibration equipment, equipment used in the\nresearch and development of weapons systems, medical technologies, transport vehicles,\nbuildings, and utility distribution systems such as water and electric. Examples of platform IT\ninterconnections that impose security considerations include communications interfaces for\ndata exchanges with enclaves for mission planning or execution, remote administration, and\nremote upgrade or reconfiguration.

It was\ndeveloped under the direction of the DHS National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) by\ncybersecurity experts and with assistance from the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology. This tool provides users with a systematic and repeatable approach for assessing\nthe security posture of their cyber systems and networks. It includes both high-level and\ndetailed questions related to all industrial control and IT systems. CSET is a desktop software\ntool that guides users through a step-by-step process to assess their control system and\ninformation technology network security practices against recognized industry standards. The\noutput from CSET is a prioritized list of recommendations for improving the cybersecurity\nposture of the organization's enterprise and industrial control cyber systems. The tool derives\nthe recommendations from a database of cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices.\nEach recommendation is linked to a set of actions that can be applied to enhance cybersecurity\ncontrols.\n\nA caveat provided by the ICS-CERT: CSET is only one component of the overall cyber security\npicture and should be complemented with a robust cyber security program within the\norganization. A self-assessment with CSET cannot reveal all types of security weaknesses, and\nshould not be the sole means of determining an organization’s security posture. The tool will\nnot provide an architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network hardware/software\nconfiguration review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex risk\nassessment. CSET is not intended as a substitute for in depth analysis of control system\nvulnerabilities as performed by trained professionals.\n\nSAMPLE QUESTION FROM CSET\n\nQuestion 12. Is a disaster recovery plan prepared, tested, and available in the event of a major hardware or\nsoftware failure or destruction of the facility?

When effectively applied, these programs form a comprehensive structure to secure\ncritical assets, infrastructure, and key resources for our nation. The nation’s defense and\neconomic vitality is highly dependent upon the availability and reliability of both DOD and nonDOD owned critical infrastructure (such as: power, transportation, telecommunications, water\nsupply, etc.). With limited resources to address risk to critical infrastructure, the DCIP relies on\ncontinuous analysis of changing vulnerabilities to all types of threats and hazards to effectively\nmanage risk to the nation’s most essential infrastructure.\n\nRecognizing how critical the infrastructure is to accomplishing DOD's missions and the effects of\nvulnerabilities to threats and hazards of infrastructure assets, DOD Directive 3020.40, DOD\nPolicy and Responsibility for Critical Infrastructure, established the Defense Critical\nInfrastructure Program (DCIP), a program responsible for coordinating the management of risk\nto the critical infrastructure that DOD relies upon to execute its missions.\n\nIncreased global connectivity and interdependencies create numerous and changing\nvulnerabilities. Threats to \"soft\" targets do not only occur through criminal or terrorist\nactivities, but also through national disasters, accidents, hazardous weather, and other natural\nand man-made events. Our national military strength and economic vitality is highly dependent\nupon the availability and reliability of both DOD and non-DOD owned critical infrastructure\n(such as: power, transportation, telecommunications, water supply, etc.) However, resources\nto address these vulnerabilities are limited and must be channeled to those deemed the highest\npriority. Additionally, priorities change as threats, vulnerabilities, and mission requirements\nevolve.\n\nRelevant publications include:\nDODD 3020.40, DOD Policy and Responsibilities for Critical Infrastructure\nDODI 3020.45, Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) Management\nDODM 3020.45 Vol 1, DCIP: DOD Mission-Based Critical Asset Identification Process (CAIP)\nDODI 5240.19, Counterintelligence Support to the DCIP\nCJCSI 3209.01, Defense Critical Infrastructure Program\nSECNAVINST 3501.1B, Department of the Navy Critical Infrastructure Protection Program\nMCO 3501.36A, Marine Corps Critical Infrastructure Program (MCCIP)\nAR 525-26, [Army] Infrastructure Risk Management\nAFPD 10-24, Air Force Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP)\n\n62\n\n\n-----\n\n##### APPENDIX I   UNIVERSAL JOINT TASKS\n\nUJTs Relevant to Securing Critical Infrastructure\n\nUniversal Joint Tasks (UJT) provide the foundation upon which METs are constructed.

This is merely a subset of a broader community\nengaged on ICS security.\n\nICS-CERT http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/ics-cert/\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) [Dept of Homeland\nDefense] provides a control system security focus in collaboration with US-CERT to:\n\n  - respond to and analyze control systems related incidents,\n\n  - conduct vulnerability and malware analysis,\n\n  - provide on-site support for incident response and forensic analysis,\n\n  - provide situational awareness in the form of actionable intelligence,\n\n  - coordinate the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities/mitigations, and\n\n  - share and coordinate vulnerability information and threat analysis through information\nproducts and alerts.\n\nAFCESA http://www.afcesa.af.mil/\nThe Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency (HQ USAF/A7C) [USAF-centric], CEO Division,\nprovides (on a scheduled basis) specialized ICS and IT teams to apply the ICS PIT C&A Program.\nAFCESA/CEO’s standard procedure is to apply the risk assessment program at Air Forcemanaged installations on a scheduled basis, with a goal of revisitation every three years; they\nmay visit out-of-cycle on an as-requested basis but will be constrained by already-scheduled\nassessments. As of this publication, the AFCESA C&A teams operate under authority of SAF/CIO\nA6, and in accordance with DODI 8500.01E, AFI 33-210, and AFCESA ETL 11-1.\n\n262 NWS http://washingtonairguard.org/194rsw/\nThe 262d Network Warfare Squadron (262 NWS) is an Air National Guard (ANG) unit operating\non Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington. The Washington ANG web site\nreflects: Nationally recognized as a Cyber Warfare leader, the 262 NWS conducts worldwide\nnetwork security operations to improve the DOD GiG and the Air Force's network security\nposture. Recent high-level assessments include the White House Communications Agency, US\nCentral Command, Space Command, and European Command. They also participate in ongoing responses to Air Force and DOD cyber incidents, all amidst an increasing number of\nfederal- and state-directed assessments.\n\n69\n\n\n-----\n\nNSTB http://www.inl.gov/scada/\nTo ensure the secure, reliable and efficient distribution of power, the DOE jointly established\nthe National SCADA Test Bed (NSTB) program at INL and SNL. The program works to support\nindustry and government efforts to enhance the cyber security of control systems used\nthroughout the electricity, oil, and gas industries. Among the services available: Control\nsystem security product and technology assessments to identify vulnerabilities and\ncorresponding mitigation approaches.\n\nIDART http://idart.sandia.gov/\nThe Information Design Assurance Red Team (IDART) provides independent, objective,\nadversary-based assessments of information, communication, and critical infrastructure\nsystems throughout their lifecycle (concept through retirement) in order to identify\nvulnerabilities and threats, improve design, and assist decision makers with choices in the\ndevelopment, security, and use of their systems. [Operates out of Sandia National Laboratory.]\n\n“The greatest strength of a 21st century grid—\nevolving technology—may also present\nopportunities for additional vulnerabilities.\nNetworks of computers, intelligent electronic\ndevices, software, and communication technologies\npresent greater infrastructure protection challenges\nthan those of the traditional infrastructure. Notably,\na smarter grid includes more devices and\nconnections that may become avenues for\nintrusions, error-caused disruptions, malicious\nattacks, destruction, and other threats.”\n\nA Policy Framework for the 21st Century Grid (p. 49)\n\n70\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ATTACHMENT 1   MAPPING INTERDEPENDENCIES & ASSESSING RISK\n\nWith reference to the eight-step process introduced at the beginning of this handbook, this\nsection will facilitate the following activities:\n\n  - Mission analysis\n\n  - ID assets\n\n  - Determine ICS dependencies\n\n  - Determine ICS connectivity\n\n  - Assess risk\n\n  - Prioritize risk management actions\n\nThis leaves the following activities to be addressed by the installation ICS security team.\n\n  - Implement actions\n\n  - Monitor and reenter the cycle as required\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nFacilitator\n\nThe Installation Commander should appoint a facilitator for this data collection. The results\nfrom this effort will assist in determining priorities for resource commitment decisions. The\nfacilitator will have the following responsibilities:\n\n  - Authority to gather the required data\n\n  - Assembling the experts related to infrastructures that support the missions\n\n  - Collating data related to the system dependencies\n\n  - Documenting the dependencies of systems, infrastructures, and interconnections\n(spreadsheet, database, diagrams, etc.)\n\nThe duration of this effort depends on the depth of knowledge and documentation of the\nexisting systems. Documenting processes that do not exist, have been abandoned, or were\nnever installed will diminish the value of this. Rigor should be applied to the process of\nensuring the dependencies and interconnects are characterized as precisely as possible. This\nactivity also may need to be iterative; a lightning strike knocking out power may expose a\nconnection that was unknown, at which point the diagram/table should be updated as this will\nalter the relative importance values. The initial amount of time to allocate would be one hour\nper infrastructure or one-half day for a large meeting with several infrastructures. The\nfacilitated meetings (combined) should not take more than one day for each mission.\nAdditional time can be determined based on the outcome of the first session. Incomplete\n\n71\n\n\n-----\n\ngroups of data can be collected and documented. Gaps should be noted and filled as experts or\ndata become available.\nCAVEAT: Some data may require a clearance to obtain and may result in generating classified\ndocuments. A derivative classifier or classification authority should be consulted prior to\nbeginning this effort. The documentation will be, at a minimum, “For Official Use Only.”\n\nSome data may not be obtainable. Remember, this is not documenting how the processes\nwork; this is documenting the mission dependencies on processes and systems that in turn\ndepend on one another. Here are examples of utilities and infrastructures that should be part\nof this effort:\n\n  - Electricity\n\n  - Fuel\n\n  - Water/Waste Water\n\n  - Natural Gas\n\n  - Security (gates, doors, surveillance, etc.)\n`o` If security is the mission, then ensure security and the systems/networks security\nuses are represented in the diagram. If security is a mitigating measure, then make\nnotation of this. Essentially, if the doors lock due to a power outage of the security\nsystem, can the mission still function?\n\n  - Lights (emergency, runway, search, etc.)\n\n  - Emergency Services\n\n  - Communications (networks, wired, wireless)\n\n  - People (groups, organizations, contractors, etc.)\n\n  - Control systems, SCADA systems, HVAC systems, etc.\n\nSubject Matter Experts\nThe utilities and infrastructures listed above involve people who have expert knowledge about\nhow they connect to other systems or what systems they depend on. They will be supplying\nthe data that builds the diagram/table discussed below. How the system works will sometimes\nsupply additional information on the dependencies and interdependencies.\n\nExample: If the entire water system depends on one electrical feed, then the details of how the\nwater system works will not be as useful as the fact that there is one electrical connection. If\nthe details of the water system identify which HVAC, waste water, potable water, and electrical\ngeneration systems depend on the water, then those details are indicating downstream\ndependencies that need to be documented.\n\nTo focus all participants on the objective of this activity, the facilitator may have to make\nleading statements or ask pointed questions such as:\n\n72\n\n\n-----\n\n  - “If power were cut, how long can you remain operational?”\n\n  - “If the temperature in this building reaches 90 degrees, will the equipment remain\nfunctional?”\n\n  - “If a <insert disaster> destroyed the <insert part of the building>, would that impact our\n<insert infrastructure>?”\n\nUsing the Diagram\nThe following figure (Figure Atch1-1) is a representation of a fictitious mission. Each hexagon\nrepresents a system or process boundary. The connections between the systems indicate\ndependencies. The numeric values represent the relative value to one another starting with a\nbase value of 1 for the mission and escalating with each dependency. The rules for escalating\nthe value will be discussed later in this section. Looking at this figure, what system or group of\nsystems has the highest value? Are they inside or outside of the jurisdiction boundary?\n\nFigure Atch1-1. Example Mission Interdependencies\n\n73\n\n\n-----\n\nThe figure has color coded hexagons to make finding items easier. For example, electrical\nsystems are blue with a yellow outline. The cyber systems (control systems) associated with\nthe electrical systems are indicated as their own green hexagons. The electrical systems\nlocated at the center bottom of the figure have the highest relative importance. The leased\nline, electrical supply, substation A, and their associated cyber systems (control systems) all\nhave values of 20. The quick meaning is that without electricity, the rest of the systems are\nlikely to be non-functional. The pumps will no longer work to deliver fuel or water to the\nmission. The IT equipment will no longer be powered. The only item that would remain\nfunctional would be the backup generator located to the upper left of the mission (in the\nmiddle). This would allow the mission to function at least until the fuel for the backup\ngenerator was consumed.\n\nTaking another look at the figure, in the upper-right corner there is a virtual local area network\n(VLAN) switch with quite a few connections. If there was found a vulnerability that allowed\nswitching from one VLAN to another, could an intruder from the water cyber system get into\nthe process cyber system? That VLAN switch concentrates a significant portion of the cyber\ntraffic around that mission. As such, that component is fairly significant to the successful\noperation of the mission. The numeric value of 5 indicates the relative importance.\n\nWithout prior knowledge of the mission or how the systems operate, a determination can be\nmade of the relative importance of the systems with a quick glance. Another potential\nrepresentation of this data would be as a topological map imposed on the facility. The highest\npoint would still be the electrical systems. When attempting to control or secure an area that is\non low ground surrounded by high ground, are defenses placed on the low ground or the high\nground? This diagram and method for generating this diagram should help make that decision,\nback that decision up with numeric values based on the infrastructure in place, and then apply\nresources as the installation commander sees fit.\n\nRules for the Mapping of Interdependencies\nThe following definitions will be useful:\n\n    - Missions are comprised of functions\n\n    - Functions have requirements in terms of utilities, systems, and people\n\n    - Utilities, systems, and people have requirements as they are supplied by additional\nlayers\n\n    - Systems/Process – An object/component or group of objects/components that\naccomplish a result\n\n    - Object / Component – An item or group of items that accomplish a task\n`o` A valve, PLC, temperature indicator, and computer are all components. A system\nwould be the combination of all of them together performing HVAC. A pumping\nstation may comprise of several pumps, controllers, communications, and power\ncomponents.\n`o` Sometimes an object or component is a system in and of itself. A managed\nswitch may be necessary to break out as a system boundary because it intersects\nseveral networks and segments them with VLANs.\n\n74\n\n\n-----\n\nEach layer beyond the initial layer of utilities, systems, and people may comprise a system in\nand of itself that needs to be identified by the boundaries. Two separated control systems\nrunning two segmented parts of a system would be two different representations linked by a\nprocess system physical connection. Physical and cyber systems should not be combined so the\nimpacts to one can be seen on the other. The cyber system should be attached and will inherit\nthe value from the process. An example is shown in Figure Atch1-2 below. The SCADA/ICS\ncyber systems may have several network boundaries they traverse, this is also shown in the\nfigure where the system on Substation A and the system on Electrical Supply External are using\na Leased Line to communicate. The Leased Line is owned by a different group and the\ncommunications between the two systems depends on it. It is not uncommon to have shared\ndata highways, such as a fiber optic ring, that infrastructure use to communicate. Treat shared\ninterconnects (e.g., a fiber optic ring with the associated switch gear) as a system/process.\n\nFigure Atch1-2. ICS Representation\n\nUse the following types of diagrams and drawings to assist in creating the interdependency\ndiagram:\n\n  - Network diagrams\n\n  - Cabinet drawings\n\n  - Electrical drawings\n\n  - Process diagrams\n\n  - Site location diagrams\n\nUse names or locations for tie-in points to components that are connected to multiple\ncomponents or the diagram may become overly cumbersome. An example of what to do is\nshown in Figure Atch1-3. The VLANB switch has multiple cyber connections that overlap other\nsystems. While this does represent the connections, this can make the diagram difficult to\nread.\n\n75\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure Atch1-3. Congested Dependencies\n\nAn alternative way of representing multiple connections is to make an additional object with\nthe same name and make the dependency connections. The difficulty in this solution is in\nfinding the partners. In Figure Atch1-4, both Substation A and Substation B are split in order to\nkeep the diagram cleaner. Network boundaries are also shown in Figure Atch1-4. The cyber\nsystems for the Fuel Supply have a DMZ network with which they both communicate. The DMZ\nnetwork then has an additional network that it communicates with where the data from the\nFuel Supply systems is accessed. A historian passing data to an archive server on an IT network\nis an example of this type of architecture.\n\nFigure Atch1-4. Decongested Dependencies\n\n76\n\n\n-----\n\nThe diagram itself should show the dependencies of each system relative to the mission going\noutward until the installation commander reaches a point where he/she no longer has\nownership. At that point, the system dependencies end as indicated by circles in the diagrams\nabove.\n\nThe numeric values are assigned to each process or system based on this one rule.\n\n  - A system inherits the values of all of those systems that depend on it.\n`o` The mission value is set to 1.\n`o` All other systems derive their values from the mission value.\n`o` Circular connections are handled consistently (choose to either add them or do not\nadd them)\n\nThe easiest way of generating these values is to use a database or a table in Excel. An example\ntable is shown in Table Atch1-1. Do not generate these values while determining\ndependencies. Attempting to do so will not benefit the facilitated meeting. The table should\ncontain these columns: Process/System Boundary, Zi (relative importance), Dependants, and\ngeographical information services (GIS) coordinates of the Process/System (optional).\nThe cells should be linked as indicated by the cell references depicted. The geographical\ninformation services (GIS) data are the GIS coordinates of that component, they are optional. Zi\nis the aggregated impact or importance value of the component based on dependencies.\n\nTable Atch1-1.

The lower elevations are the items of\ninterest and the areas of higher relative importance would be key locations to control the\nregion. The scope of this project prevents the creation of a graphical tool kit so the variations\nof the graphical depiction will be based on the people contributing to this activity. A white\nboard “exercise” would also work to create a physical image depicting the interdependencies.\n\nGenerating the diagram and table\n\nThe facilitator should use materials they have at hand. A large white board, poster-sized paper\nhung on the wall, or poster-sized paper on a tabletop are examples of suitable mediums.\n1. Starting with the mission, draw an object and label it “mission” or use the proper\nmission name.\n2. Describe the mission and its functions to the assembled experts and draw radial lines\noutward from the mission object to show dependencies.\n\nExample: The facilitator makes the statement, “The mission is to provide bombers; which\nrequire maintenance, fuel, runways, ordinance, and crew.” The facilitator draws radial lines\noutward connecting it to objects labeled “maintenance,” “fuel,.” “runways,” “ordinance,” and\n“crew.”\n3. The experts assembled should represent people knowledgeable about each function\nwith which the mission relies. Some experts will know about several functions. In an\n\n78\n\n\n-----\n\norderly fashion, capture everyone’s input. Drawing objects and connecting lines to\nshow the systems/processes and dependencies. Use arrows if the dependency is one\nway with the arrow pointing toward the downstream or consumer component. Resolve\nconflicts in a professional manner. Resolution may take the form of a field trip, a field\ntest, or a discussion. If the resolution must be postponed until after the facilitated\nsession, document the object with a question mark to show uncertainty.\n\nNOTE: Computer networks should be viewed in a frame of consumer/publisher. What\nsystem produces the information and what system consumes the information. The\nconsumer is dependent on the producer. The producer is not dependent on the\nconsumer.\n\n4. Document the diagram. This can be done by printing, photographing, or whatever\nmeans is suitable for the medium.\n5. Generate a table of Relative Importance of Interdependent Systems based on the\ndiagram.\n6. The table will generate values for each system/process based on the documented\ndependencies.\n\n#### Assessing the risk and prioritizing risk management actions\n\nAssessing the risk and prioritizing the risk management actions on a macro scale requires a\nhigh-level determination of cyber risk. The purpose of the high-level determination is to\nprioritize areas of focus to perform more time consuming assessments. Performing this\ncalculation will take into account how a system is used or monitored.\n\nCalculation of Priority based on Use\n\nMaintenance for mechanical devices is fairly well understood. There are differences in opinions\non how best to perform maintenance. Cyber systems require a different kind of maintenance.\nThe concern is the chance that, due to a lack of information technology maintenance, the\ncontrol system will be an easier target for hacking. A quick search using the NIST National\nVulnerability Database (http://nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search) is presented in Table Atch1-2.\nThese are the rates of reporting, not necessarily the rate of discovery. Each product has the\nvulnerabilities it was created with; products do not create new vulnerabilities by existing. As\ninterest in a system increases, the number of reported vulnerabilities increases. This is\ndifferent from a mechanical device that wears out over time. Programs do not wear out,\nthough the vendor may discontinue the product.\n\n79\n\n\n-----\n\nTable Atch1-2.

Once on the consoles, Stuxnet made use of the\nSiemens software to perform tasks it was designed to do. Any vulnerability that allows\narbitrary execution of code can allow malicious software access to control system functions\nthat are available to the user account the vulnerable program is using.\n\n80\n\n|Company|Reported over 3 months|Reported over 3 years|Avg / Month|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Oracle|185|984|27.3|\n|Microsoft|83|876|24.3|\n|Linux|121|855|23.8|\n|Adobe|29|535|14.9|\n|McAfee|1|25|0.7|\n|Symantec|20|98|2.7|\n|Invensys|7|14|0.4|\n|ABB|6|47|1.3|\n|Siemens|9|34|0.9|\n|Cisco|56|473|13.1|\n|Juniper|0|16|0.4|\n|Dlink|1|10|0.3|\n|Intel|11|138|3.8|\n|AMD|2|9|0.3|\n|NVIDIA|3|7|0.2|\n|ATI|7|68|1.9|\n|Dell|1|13|0.4|\n\n\n-----\n\nA control system uses three methods of user access control:\n1. The first is no security. The software will run as the operating system account currently\nlogged in. These types of systems often run as an administrative level user. If one can\nlog into the console, one can perform any action on the system such as opening\nbreakers or valves, adjusting set points, or downloading new configuration to the field\ncontrollers.\n2. The second method is a custom user account manager on top of the operating system\naccounts. This method can result in security being turned on/off for the control system\nand circumstances where no user accounts exist for the control system thereby locking\nthe console until it is rebuilt with an image or reinstalled. This method will typically use\nan auto-login account for the operating system and then have the operations personnel\nuse their own custom user account to gain access to the control system interfaces. The\nauto-login account is often an administrative level user.\n3. The third method is to use accounts integrated into the operating system user accounts.\nThis is more common of systems designed after 2001. This will be a mix of user\naccounts with role-based privileges. A look at the processes running on the console will\nshow a number of user accounts that are control-system specific that likely have\nadministrative rights, which are used to keep key system functions operational.\n\nThis is why software management and system monitoring is important for control systems.\nAssume that the system can be compromised then watch the system for aberrant behavior\nindicating unstable code. Achieving this level of monitoring takes resources in the form of\npeople, procedures, and technology. All of which cost money to deploy and maintain. In the\nprevious section, the interdependencies of the infrastructure were determined and a table was\nbuilt. The relative importance to the mission was determined for each system. That value does\nnot take into consideration operational conditions or mitigation measures in place. The\nfollowing columns should be added to the table of relative importance:\n\n  - Maintenance (patching, evaluating/testing patches, etc.) performed regularly for\n`o` Operating system\n`o` Hardware\n`o` Third-party software\n`o` Control system software\n`o` Customized software\n\n  - System monitoring frequency (how often is the system used/observed)\n\n  - System log (all logs) monitoring frequency\n\n  - Physical connections\n\nThe resulting table with values is shown in Table Atch1-3.\n\n81\n\n\n-----\n\nTable Atch1-3.

The checklist does not cover every last action that may be\ntaken to secure installation ICS. Additional actions may be identified during assessment or even in\nthe midst of implementation. Also, this is generic, meaning that applicability is broad rather than\nspecific. Each installation will have differences, in some cases significant, in control systems\narchitectures, security measures already in place, organizational and personnel management, and\nmissions. The “one-size-fits-all” approach offered here will indeed yield a more secure ICS, but a\ncloser fit will require tailoring (such as using other tools, requesting assistance of SMEs, etc.).\n\nActions are not listed in a particular order, except that policy should first be well-established so as to\nfacilitate implementing actions in other areas. Nor do actions need to be implemented sequentially;\nmany actions may be undertaken in parallel.\n\nNOTE: A separate table may be used for each type of ICS or by mission supported.\n\nThe columns in the table are:\n\n  - FOCUS: COTMLPF-P area\n\n  - ACTION: ICS security action to implement\n\n  - COMMENTS:  Notes/comments about that action\n\n  - PRI #: Priority assigned to the action (self-defined priority scheme and criteria)\n\n  - POC: Person or office with primary responsibility for managing that action\n\n  - ASSGND: Date assigned by installation commander or ICS security team\n\n  - DONE: Date completed\n\nBlank rows are included at the end of each “Focus” section for installation-specific additions.\n\n37 Modified by replacing the “D” with a “C” for cybersecurity.\n\n84\n\n\n-----\n\n### TITLE <name of control system, infrastructure, or mission>\n\n\n#### MISSION(S) SUPPORTED:\n\n OTHER INFORMATION:\n\n\n85\n\n\n-----\n\n86\n\n\n-----\n\n87\n\n\n-----\n\n88\n\n\n-----\n\n89\n\n\n-----\n\n90\n\n\n-----\n\n91\n\n\n-----\n\n92\n\n\n-----\n\n93\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Enclaves\n\n  - VPNs to cross defended\nboundaries when necessary\n\nControl individual access:\n\n  - Assign individual/unique logon\nIDs and passwords\n\n  - Design user access control\narchitecture based on LeastUser Access (LUA) model\n\n  - Require role-based access\ncontrol (RBAC)\n\n  - Disable all “guest” or\nanonymous accounts\n\n  - Set UAC policy for event log\nauditing\n\n  - Set timeline and threshold\nmonitoring requirements for\nUAC events\n\n  - Ensure functional UAC auditing\nand monitoring thresholds are\n\n\nFollow standard DOD practices\n\nFor existing as well as new accounts\n\nICS systems and applications are relatively\nstatic; any change to UAC configuration at\nthe operating system, application, and data\nlevels need to be identified immediately and\nreviewed for security implications\n\nEvent logs (functional and security) need to\nbe reviewed in a timely manner; it will not do\nthe teams any good if an IT IDS team reviews\nthe alerts because the IDS team will not\nunderstand ICS traffic initially\n\nSecurity-impacting changes to an ICS are\nmore likely to be detected through functional\n\n\n94\n\n\n-----\n\nput in place incident evaluation rather than through\nsecurity event monitoring; make sure ICS\nadmins are reviewing their systems for\nsecurity-impacting events\n\n\n\n  - Ensure audit configuration and\nlog monitoring on ICS systems\ncan detect unusual egress\ntraffic from privileged user\naccounts\n\nProtect operating system:\n\n  - Disable all unnecessary\nnetwork services\n\n  - Use (and keep current) viruschecking software\n\n  - Establish software lifecycle\nmanagement policy\n\n  - Enable audit logging & monitor\n\n  - Remove all unnecessary\nprograms\n\n\nAs with previous comments, egress traffic\nfrom the ICS networks to the\ncorporate/military or Internet need to be\nevaluated so a baseline of normal egress\ntraffic can be established; unusual or\nanomalous egress traffic from privileged\naccounts needs to be identified and\nevaluated as quickly as possible\n\nVirus detection programs may be difficult to\nupdate on live systems, and therefore will\nrequire diligence in maintaining currency\n\nOut-of-date software of any sort (firmware,\noperating system, third party/COTS, custom\ncode, development frameworks, etc.) should\nall be maintained and within n or n-1 releases\nof a vendor’s supported software\n\n\n95\n\n\n-----\n\n- Implement security policies per\nvendor best security practices\nlist\n\n\nSecurity configurations should be done on\neach OS in addition to the external access\ncontrols like port configuration; this means\ndisabling autorun, limiting remote registry\naccess, etc.\n\n\n\n  - Consider using IDS If consider, do so judiciously and in close\nconsultation with cybersecurity specialists\nwho probably already had implemented an\nIDS on the IT network.

The TWG was\ncomprised of Subject Matter Experts from DoD, DHS, and NIST and the JTANICS staff. The overlay was\npublished in January 2013 and incorporated into the DHS CSET 5.1 tool, released in June 2013.\n\nThe intent of the overlay was to bridge the gap between the need to have a standardized process\nacross the DoD to address the growing concern about the lack of ICS cybersecuriity and have basic\n“primer” that the engineering, information technology, and information assurance community could\nuse in preparation for the DoD issuance of the new DoDI 8500 Cybersecurity instruction and adoption\nof the NIST Risk Management Framework. The RMF is replacing the Defense Information Assurance\nCertification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP).\n\nAt the same time the CNSSI ICS Overlay was being developed, NIST was also updating the NIST SP\n800-53 Rev 3 Recommended Security Controls For Federal Information Systems and Organizations,\nand the NIST 800-82 Industrial Control Systems Security Guide. As part of the update process, NIST\nmoved the NIST SP 800-53 Rev 3 Appendix I Industrial Control Systems Security Controls,\nEnhancements, and Supplemental Guidance to the NIST 800-82 Rev 1 Appendix G. This kept the ICS\nguidance and controls in one contiguous document. NIST is in the process of updating the NIST SP\n800-82 to incorporate the new controls developed in the NSIT SP 800-53 Rev 4, with a target date of a\nspring 2014 release.\n\nThe NIST SP 800-82 writers group has incorporated a great deal of the CNSII 1253 Overlay Version 1\ncontent into the draft NIST 800-82 Rev 2, and has created a master ICS Overlay template that can be\nused by any organization.\n\nFuture versions of the CNSSI 1253 ICS Overlay may simply refer to the NIST SP 800-82 Rev 2 or will be\na very condensed version of this overlay.\n\n105\n\n\n-----\n\n## Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) No. 1253\n\n# SECURITY CONTROL OVERLAYS FOR \n\n INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS\n\n Version 1\n\n January 2013\n\nThis Draft version of the Overlay is for informational and instructional purposes only and meant\nto be used a companion to the DHS Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET). The Draft version is\nbased on the NIST SP 800-53 Rev 3 publication. The Final version is being revised to follow the\nnew format of the NIST SP 800-53 Rev 4 publication.\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 106 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\n**Forward**\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) created NIST Special Publication\n(SP) 800-53, “Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and\nOrganizations,” to establish a standardized set of information security controls for use within the\nUnited States (U.S.) Federal Government. As part of the Joint Task Force Transformation\nInitiative Working Group, the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) has worked\nwith representatives from the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence Communities to produce a unified\ninformation security framework and to ensure NIST SP 800-53 contains security controls to meet\nthe requirements of National Security Systems (NSS).\n\nSecurity control overlays are specifications of security controls and supporting guidance used to\ncomplement the security control baselines and parameter values in CNSSI No. 1253 and to\ncomplement the supplemental guidance in NIST SP 800-53. Organizations select and apply\nsecurity control overlays by using the guidance in each of the standardized, approved and CNSSpublished overlays.\n\nAn overlay is a specification of security controls and supporting guidance used to complement\nthe security control baselines and parameter values in CNSSI No. 1253 and to complement the\nsupplemental guidance in NIST SP 800-53. An overlay’s specifications may be more stringent or\nless stringent than the controls and guidance complemented. Overlays may be applied to reflect\nthe needs of different information types (e.g., personally identifiable information [PII], financial,\nor highly sensitive types of intelligence); system functionality needs (e.g., stand-alone systems,\ncross domain solutions, or controlled interface systems); or environmental or operationallydriven needs (e.g., tactical, space-based, or test environment).\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 107 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\n**Industrial Control Systems Overlay**\n\n**1.  Characteristics and Assumptions**\n\nThe Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Overlay applies to Platform IT (PIT) systems. As stated in\nDoDD 8500.01 Cybersecurity Directive, Enclosure 3, “Examples of platforms that may include\nPIT are:\n“weapons, training simulators, diagnostic test and maintenance equipment, calibration\nequipment, equipment used in the research and development of weapons systems,\nmedical technologies, vehicles and alternative fueled vehicles (e.g., electric, bio-fuel,\nLiquid Natural Gas that contain car-computers), buildings and their associated control\nsystems (building automation systems or building management systems, energy\nmanagement system, fire and life safety, physical security, elevators, etc.), utility\ndistribution systems (such as electric, water, waste water, natural gas and steam),\ntelecommunications systems designed specifically for industrial control systems to\ninclude supervisory control and data acquisition, direct digital control, programmable\nlogic controllers, other control devices and advanced metering or sub-metering, including\nassociated data transport mechanisms (e.g., data links, dedicated networks).”\n\nICSs are physical equipment oriented technologies and systems that deal with the actual running\nof plants and equipment, include devices that ensure physical system integrity and meet technical\nconstraints, and are event-driven and frequently real-time software applications or devices with\nembedded software. These types of specialized systems are pervasive throughout the\ninfrastructure and are required to meet numerous and often conflicting safety, performance,\nsecurity, reliability, and operational requirements. ICSs range from non-critical systems, such as\nthose used for building environmental controls (HVAC, lighting), to critical systems such as the\nelectrical power grid.\n\nWithin the controls systems industry, ICS systems are often referred to as Operational\nTechnology (OT) systems. Historically, the majority of OT systems were proprietary, analog,\nvendor supported, and were not internet protocol (IP) enabled. Systems key components, such as\nRemote Terminal Units (RTUs), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Physical Access\nControl Systems (PACs), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), closed circuit television (CCTV),\nfire alarm systems, and utility meters are now becoming digital and IP enabled. OT systems use\nHuman Machine Interfaces (HMIs) to monitor the processes, versus Graphical User Interfaces\nfor IT systems, and most current ICS systems and subsystems are now a combination of\nOperational Technologies (OT) and Information Technologies (IT).\n\nAn emerging concept in technology is to refer to the hybrid OT and IT ICS systems as cyberphysical systems (CPS). As defined by the National Science Foundation:\n\n“cyber-physical systems are engineered systems that are built from and depend upon the\nsynergy of computational and physical components. Emerging CPSs will be coordinated,\ndistributed, and connected, and must be robust and responsive. The CPS of tomorrow\nwill need to far exceed the systems of today in capability, adaptability, resiliency, safety,\nsecurity, and usability. Examples of the many CPS application areas include the smart\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 108 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\nelectric grid, smart transportation, smart buildings, smart medical technologies, nextgeneration air traffic management, and advanced manufacturing.”\n\nAs these new technologies are developed and implemented, this Overlay will be updated to\nreflect advances in related terminology and capabilities. This Overlay focuses on the current\ngeneration technologies already in the field, and the known technologies likely to remain in\ninventory for at least the next ten years.\n\nFigure 1 is a typical electrical supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) type system\nwhich shows the HMI at the operators console, the transmission system infrastructure, and the\nRTU in the field. At the substation and building level, the meters are monitored in a local Energy\nOperations Center (EOC) or Regional Operations Center (ROC), which use real time analytics\nsoftware to manage the energy loads and building control systems, down to the sensor or actuator\ndevice level.\n\n**Figure 1 – ICS Human Machine Interface, System, Remote Terminal Unit[38]**\n\nICSs differ significantly from traditional administrative, mission support and scientific data\nprocessing information systems, and use specialized software, hardware and protocols. ICS\nsystems are often integrated with mainstream organizational information systems to promote\nconnectivity, efficiency, and remote access capabilities. The “front end” portions of these ICSs\nresemble traditional information systems in that they use the same commercially available\nhardware and software components. While the majority of an ICS system still does not resemble\na traditional information system (IS), the integration of the ICS’s “front end” with IS introduces\nsome of the same vulnerabilities that exist in current networked information systems.\nICSs can have long life spans (in excess of 20 years) and be comprised of technology that in\naccordance with Moore’s law suffers rapid obsolescence. This introduces two issues: first,\n\n38 The pictures and devices shown in this Overlay are for illustrative purposes only and are intended to show typical\nfield devices that are the core elements of OT. This Overlay document does not endorse any specific vendor or\nproduct.\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 109 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\ndepending upon the relative age and isolation of the system, there may not be a patch or upgrade\npath for components of the system, and second, attempting to patch the component or employing\nmodern scanning methods might disrupt the system. ICSs have experienced complete system\nshutdown when an intrusion detection system (IDS) or host-based scanning system (HBSS) scan\nis performed on an otherwise operational ICS. For an ICS, updates should be delayed until after\na thorough analysis of deployment impact has been completed. This might stretch out security\nupdate timeliness and require flexibility in security control compliance measurement and\nenforcement.\n\nWhile many Information Assurance (IA) controls from the baselines can be applied to an ICS,\nhow they are implemented varies, primarily because of technical and operational constraints and\ndifferences in the evaluation of risk between ICSs and standard ISs. Interconnections between\nICSs and the organizational network and business systems expose ICSs to exploits and\nvulnerabilities, and any attempts to address these exploits and vulnerabilities must consider the\nconstraints and requirements of the ICS. These constraints can be both technical - most ICS\ncomponents have limited storage and processing capacity – or practical, as most ICSs are\nfunding and personnel constrained so resources allocated to IA are removed from other functions\n(such as maintenance), which often adversely impacts the function of the ICS. Unlike most ISs,\nICSs are driven primarily by availability, which requires a different approach to making IA\ndecisions.\n\nA comparison of IT versus OT systems is provided in the table below:\n\n**Table 1: IT vs. OT Systems Comparison**\n\n**Information Technology** **Operational Technology**\n\n\n**_Purpose_**\n\n**_Architecture_**\n\n\nEnterprise wide infrastructure\n\nand applications (generic)\n\n\nProcess transactions, provide\n\ninformation\n\n\nControl or monitor physical\n\nprocesses and equipment\n\n\nEvent-driven, real-time,\nembedded hardware and\n\nsoftware (custom)\n\n\nGUI, Web browser, terminal\n**_Interfaces_**\n\nand keyboard\n\n\nElectromechanical, sensors,\n\nactuators, coded displays,\n\nhand-held devices\n\n\n**_Ownership_**\n\n**_Connectivity_**\n\n\nControl networks, hard wired\nCorporate network, IP-based\n\ntwisted pair and IP-based\n\n\nCIO and computer grads,\nfinance and admin. depts.\n\n\nEngineers, technicians,\noperators and managers\n\n\n**_Role_** Supports people Controls machines\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 110 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\nA significant change in DoDD 8500.01 Cybersecurity Directive, Enclosure 3, is to eliminate the\nuse of the term Platform IT Interconnection (PITI), and adopt Integration and Interoperability:\n\n“All interconnections of DoD IT will be managed to minimize shared risk by ensuring that\nthe security posture of one system is not undermined by vulnerabilities of interconnected\nsystems.\n\nInterconnections between PIT systems and DoD ISs must be protected either by\nimplementation of security controls on the PIT system or the DoD IS.”\n\nIn this Overlay, the terms IT and OT are used to define the Tiers Architecture and delineate the\nboundary between the PIT and DoD IS.\n\nImplementing security controls in ICS environments should take advantage of the concept of\ncommon security controls in order to mitigate the constraints caused by the characteristics of\nthose environments. By centrally managing and documenting the development, implementation,\nassessment, authorization, and monitoring of common controls and security services,\norganizations can decrease the resources associated with implementing security controls for\nindividual systems without sacrificing the protections provided by those controls, and security\ncontrols are then implemented as part of a greater security environment. For example, a control\nimplemented within a service provided by an EOC may be inherited by a system on a mobile\nplatform (i.e. field power generation). Networked systems can, and will, depend on one another\nfor security protections or services as part of a defense in depth strategy. Controls meant to be\ncommon across connected systems – access controls, for example – can be provided once and\ninherited across many, assuming the implementation is adequate to support multiple systems.\nEvery implementation of common controls requires analysis from a risk management\nperspective, with careful communication among representatives from all interconnected systems\nand organizations. The new Advanced Meter Infrastructure shown in Figure 2 is being installed\non Department of Defense (DoD) buildings, and highlights the challenges and complexities of\nthe new hybrid OT systems. Unfortunately, due to the issues associated with implementing IA\nfor older ICSs, many older (legacy) ICSs will operate in isolation and may be unable to make use\nof many of the common controls.\n\n**Figure 2 – Advanced Meter Infrastructure (Smart Meters) for Electric, Water, Gas**\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 111 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 provides a schematic architecture and definition of tiers for ICSs that follows the\nANSI/ISA process, but includes additional components/tiers not shown in the ISA architecture.\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 112 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3 – ICS Tiers**\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 113 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ICS tier architecture is used to define the accrediation boundary for OT systems and is a\nlogical representation of the OT network. The actual physical system can span many miles; for\nexample, locks and dams, pipelines, electric transmission and distribution systems can have\nmany non-contiguous components, and there are a number of protocols commonly used by ICSs\nto allow the devices within the tiers to communicate both horizontally and vertically. Some of\nthese protocols are:\n\n  - LonWorks\n\n  - BACnet\n\n  - Modbus\n\n  - DNP 3\n\nIllustrations of the components and devices that utilize these protocols are:\n\n**5: A Tier 5 IT rack and servers located in an**\n\n**5: A Tier 5 Demarcation Point or Main** Installation Processing Node.\nPoint of Presence where the external meets .\nthe internal interface.\n\n**Figure 4 - Tier 5: \"External\" Connection and PIT Management**\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 114 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\n**4-A: A Tier 4 OT rack and servers located**\nin an Energy Operations Center, Special\nPurpose Processing Node.\n\n\n**4-B: Workstation or wall display of HMI for**\nthe UMCS.\n\n\n**4-A: A Tier 4 OT rack and servers located**\nin an Energy Operations Center, Special\nPurpose Processing Node.\n\n\n**Figure 5 - Tier 4: UMCS Front End and IP Network**\n\n**3-FS: A Tier 3 FPOC gateway (application** **3-LIP: A Tier 3 FPOC router between 3**\nlayer proxy).

There are several critical considerations to the tiered architecture:\n\n1) Not every implementation of an ICS will make use of every tier;\n\n2) The same device may reside in different tiers, depending on its configuration. For\nexample, some BACnet controllers may support different networks based on a dual inline packet (DIP) switch, and thus the same device could reside in either Tier 1 or Tier 2.\n\n3) In some cases, a single device may simultaneously fit into two principal tiers. For\nexample, a device may act as both a Tier 2 controller and a Tier 3 Facility Point of\nConnection (FPOC).\n\n4) In many cases, a device will fit multiple sub-tiers within the same principal tier, usually\nwithin Tier 2. For example, a Tier 2A BACnet controller will often act as a Tier 2C\nrouter to a Tier 1 network beneath it.\n\n5) A single device may belong in different tiers, depending on the specific architecture. For\nexample, the Tier 2A/2C controller in the example above may, in a small system, be the\nonly IP device, in which case it is also the Tier 3 FPOC. In a larger system, there would\nbe multiple IP devices and the upstream IP device (EUB switch or router) would be the\nTier 3 FPOC.\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 117 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\nInstallation Processing Node (IPN).\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 118 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\n- OT server racks\n\n- GUI and HMI displays\n\n- Fire alarm panels\n\n- Radio base stations\n\n_The OT racks, hardware and_\n_software will likely be located in_\n_an Energy Operations Center,_\n_Campus Wide Operations Center,_\n_or Regional Operations Center_\n_and designated as a Special_\n_Purpose Processing Node (SSPN)._\n\n\nTier 4 is where the ICSs most\nclosely resembles a “standard”\ninformation system, and most IA\ncontrols can be applied at this tier.\nIt’s critical to remember that ICS\nis NOT a standard IS, however,\nand that controls must be applied\nin such a way as to not hamper\nthe availability of the system. For\nexample, some ICSs require\nsoftware updates from the\nmanufacturer prior to the\nimplementation of a Java patch,\nand controls relating to the\napplication of patches must not be\nimplemented in a manner that\nrequires automatic or immediate\npatching without ensuring that\nthis won’t cause the system to go\noffline.\n\n\n**(Tier 4A and 4B) The multi-facility operator**\ninterface for the system.

Normally,\nsecuring this device protects the\nbase-wide network from the local\nfield systems (which often have a\ndifficult time meeting IA\ncontrols). Occasionally, where\nthere is a critical field control\nsystem, this device can protect the\nmore critical field control system\nfrom the less-secure base-wide\nsystem (i.e., where there are 99\nnon-critical systems and 1 critical\none, isolate the 1 from the 99\nrather than try and secure the 99).\n\n\n\n- Installation network staff\n\n- Controls contractor\n\n- System integrator when the field\ncontrol system is connected to\n(integrated with) the front end\nsystem.\n\n\nFor each field control system, the FPOC is the\nspecific single demarcation point in the OT\nsystem between that field control system and\nthe front end system. It may be a gateway that\ntranslates data from one protocol to another. It\ngenerally has IA components in that it restricts\naccess (by user, protocol, or specific\ncommands) between tiers above and tiers\nbelow. From a control architecture perspective,\nit often looks and functions identically to a Tier\n2C device. For a non-IP network (Tier 1), the\nFPOC is the device that connects the non-IP\nnetwork to IP. For an IP network (Tier 2), the\nFPOC is the device located at the single\nconnection point between the IP network in Tier\n2 and the UMCS IP network; this is typically\nthe upstream IP networking hardware (EUB\nswitch or router).\n\nIn many cases, there is a single Tier 2A\ncontroller in the system (generally with a Tier 1\nnetwork beneath it). In these cases, we may\nconsider the controller the FPOC, or we may\nconsider the upstream IP networking hardware\n(EUB switch or router) to be the FPOC.\nSimilarly, a device normally at Tier 2C could be\nthe Tier 3 FPOC.

These devices are\ndriven by cost to have the minimal functionality\nfor the application and are very constrained in\nRAM, processing power, and network I/O. In\naddition, these devices come in a vast variety of\narchitectures, processors, vendors, and\nfirmware. Aside from the fact that they use IP\nand are generally more powerful than Tier 1A\ndevices, they are otherwise identical to Tier 1A\ndevices. Many devices are available as either\nTier 1A or 2A devices, where the hardware is\nidentical except for the transceiver; some can\neven be field-configured for one or the other.\n\nThe Tier 2N network is generally Ethernet and\nthe Tier 2B network hardware is standard IT\nnetwork hardware, though generally with\nreduced functionality. For example, there may\nnot be any requirement for remotely managed\nswitches. Similarly, there is seldom a need for\nan IP router, since field control systems\ngenerally reside within a single (private) IP\nsubnet.\n\nThe Tier 2 network (2N and 2B) uses IP,\ngenerally over Ethernet, such as BACnet/IP or\nLon/IP.\n\nWhile functionally, Tier 2D components act\nsimilarly to computers at Tier 4, the fact that\nthey are local to (and dedicated to) a specific\ncontrol systems means that from an IA\nperspective, they are better addressed as Tier 2\ncomponents. Tier 2D computers will often have\nanother network logically beneath them, most\noften a non-IP network (and thus also function\nas Tier 2C devices).\n\n\np\n(Tier 2A) to computers (Tier 2D),\nthere is a variety of IA\nconsiderations for this tier. Many\nof the controllers will have the\nsame limitations as the controllers\nin Tier 1, where most IA controls\ncannot/or will not apply to them.\nSome controllers will have\nsignificantly more capability,\nhowever, and additional controls\nwill be applicable. In either case,\nthe controllers should disable any\nnetwork connections or services\nnot required for operation of the\nOT system.\n\nIn some systems, particularly\nlegacy systems, the computers at\nTier 2D may be running an older\noperating systems and may not\nsupport some of the IA controls.\nIn this case, the controls which\ncan be applied without negatively\naffecting the availability of the\nsystem should be applied, and\nmitigating controls and measures\nshould be taken when otherwise\nneeded.

A\nLow Impact ICSs addresses the “80%” non-critical systems (i.e., typical office, administrative,\nhousing, warehouse, et al. buildings control systems). Many of the Moderate and High Impact\nsystems are listed as Task Critical Assets in the Defense Critical Infrastructure Protection (DCIP)\nprogram, and are classified at the Secret level or higher. Figure 10 illustrates the conceptual\ntypes of ICSs and criticality. There are approximately 400 plus major military installations and\noperating sites. For this Overlay, the ICS systems PIT boundary is defined as the Enclave and\nInstallation Processing Node. Currently, there are 611 controls in the CNSSI 1253, of which 197\nhave been determined to apply for ICSs.\n\n**Figure 10 – ICSs Criticality**\n\nFor ICSs systems, it is extremely important to recognize that availability is often of much more\nsignificance than confidentiality or integrity. Additionally, ICS systems do not have a distinct\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 124 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\ncutoff for criticality, but rather span a range.

Supplemental Guidance**\n\nThe security controls and control enhancements are likely candidates for tailoring, with the\napplicability of scoping guidance indicated for each control/enhancement. The citation of a\ncontrol without enhancements (e.g., AC-17) refers only to the base control without any\nenhancements, while reference to an enhancement by a parenthetical number following the\ncontrol identification (e.g., AC-17(1)) refers only to the specific control enhancement.\n\nOrganizations are required to conduct a risk assessment, taking into account the tailoring and\nsupplementation performed in arriving at the agreed-upon set of security controls for the ICS, as\nwell as the risk to the organization’s operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and\nthe Nation being incurred by operation of the ICS with the intended controls. Based on an\nevaluation of the risk, the organization will further tailor the control set obtained using this\noverlay by adding or removing controls in accordance with the CNSSI 1253 process. The\naddition or removal of controls during tailoring requires justification.\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 137 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\nICS supplemental guidance provides organizations with additional information on the application\nof the security controls and control enhancements to ICSs and the environments in which these\nspecialized systems operate. The supplemental guidance also provides information as to why a\nparticular security control or control enhancement may not be applicable in some ICSs\nenvironments and may be a candidate for tailoring (i.e., the application of scoping guidance\nand/or compensating controls).\n\nThe systems controls supplemental guidance provided below is a combination of NIST 800-53\nRev 3 Appendix I, and the DoD ICSs-PIT Technical Working Group decision to include\ndefinitive text for each control as well as guidance on how to apply a control for OT and the\nunique DoD environment.

Definitions**\n\nAlternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) An AFV is a vehicle that runs on a fuel other\nthan \"traditional\" petroleum fuels (petrol or\ndiesel); and also refers to any technology of\npowering an engine that does not involve\nsolely petroleum (e.g. electric car, hybrid\nelectric vehicles, solar powered).\n\nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure Advanced metering systems are comprised of\n(AMI) state-of-the-art electronic/digital hardware and\nsoftware, which combine interval data\nmeasurement with continuously available\nremote communications. These systems enable\nmeasurement of detailed, time-based\ninformation and frequent collection and\ntransmittal of such information to various\nparties. AMI typically refers to the full\nmeasurement and collection system that\nincludes meters at the customer site,\ncommunication networks between the\ncustomer and a service provider, such as an\nelectric, gas, or water utility, and data reception and management systems\nBACnet The term BACnet is used in two ways. First\n\nmeaning the BACnet Protocol Standard - the\ncommunication requirements as defined by\nASHRAE-135 including all annexes and\naddenda. The second to refer to the overall\ntechnology related to the ASHRAE-135\nprotocol.\nBuilding Automation System (BAS) A BAS is a distributed control system. The\ncontrol system is a computerized, intelligent\nnetwork of electronic devices designed to\nmonitor and control the mechanical\nelectronics, and lighting systems in a building.\nBAS core functionality keeps the building\nclimate within a specified range, provides\nlighting based on an occupancy schedule, and\nmonitors system performance and device\nfailures and provides email and/or text\nnotifications to building engineering or\nmaintenance staff. The BAS functionality\nreduces building energy and maintenance costs\nwhen compared to a non-controlled building.\nA building controlled by a BAS is often\n\nCNSSI No. 1253 190 Attachment 1 to Appendix K\n\n\n-----\n\nreferred to as an intelligent building or a smart\nhome.\nBuilding Control System (BCS) A control system for building electrical and\nmechanical systems, typically HVAC\n(including central plants) and lighting.
