New security flaws are discovered every\nday; consequently, security teams are often pushed into patching without adequate planning\nand missing bugs that continue to represent a significant risk. The result? Cybercriminals\nand state-sponsored threat actors can often leverage unpatched vulnerabilities to get access\nto a target’s environment and conduct further malicious activity.\n\nIn an ideal world, these vulnerabilities are responsibly disclosed, giving vendors time to\nrespond publicly and roll out timely patches. Even better, critical software vulnerabilities\nwould get patched automatically! In this utopian environment, patches wouldn’t cause\neverything to break in production and conflicting interdependencies could be easily fixed.\nDoesn’t this sound dreamy? Sadly, this is not a very plausible scenario for most security\nteams out there.\n\n\n-----\n\n_We won’t judge you if you plan on turning into a Metapod when faced with patching_\n_dilemmas_\nThe current information technology (IT) landscape is a highly complex environment of old\nand new technologies that have significantly expanded the attack surface. When new\nvulnerabilities are disclosed, security teams often need to scramble to figure out how these\nwould impact their systems and what to patch first. Adopting an efficient vulnerability\nmanagement program can offset some of the traditional challenges associated with triaging\nthreats and asset management, and significantly improve your organization’s security\nposture.\n\nFor this reason, Digital Shadows has just published its latest research piece titled\n_[Vulnerability Intelligence: Do you know where your flaws are?, where we have explored the](https://resources.digitalshadows.com/whitepapers-and-reports/vulnerability-intelligence-do-you-know-where-your-flaws-are?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=vulnerability-report)_\ncybercriminal forums rabbit hole to understand how threat actors are continually exploiting\n\n\n-----\n\nsecurity teams weaknesses. The picture we obtained has convinced us that the traditional –\nand sometimes chaotic – approach to vulnerability patching is not sustainable anymore and\nthat we need a new paradigm to stay one step ahead of malicious actors.\n\n## What Does the Illegal Zero-Day Market Look Like?\n\nAs part of our investigation, we gathered extensive primary source evidence from\ncybercriminal markets and forums to better comprehend how the vulnerability criminal\nindustry looks. This environment is bursting with a variety of widespread actors who boast a\nwhole range of technical expertise and motives. The technical discussions of this eclectic\nunderground cohort have actually contributed to a pretty cohesive, crowd-sourced body of\nknowledge about vulnerabilities and exploits.\n\nThe top of the cybercriminal pyramid is represented by the market for zero-days. This market\nis an extremely expensive and competitive one, and it’s usually been a prerogative of statesponsored threat groups. However, certain high-profile cybercriminal groups (read:\n[ransomware gangs) have amassed incredible fortunes in the past years and can now](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/ransomware-q3-2021-roll-up/)\ncompete with the traditional buyers of zero-day exploits.\n\n_Threat actor offering 3,000,000 USD for a 0-click RCE zero-day_\nThis is probably why zero-day sellers have moved their auctions to cybercriminal forums: to\nfish in this large and wealthy pool. Zero-day exploits are incredibly pricey and we’ve\nobserved threat actors claiming that they could go away for up to $10,000,000. These prices\nmay look jaw-dropping but there’s a key aspect to keep in mind. Whatever legitimate bug\nbounty programs offer, cybercriminals must offer more in order to compete with them, given\nthe risks (jail time) and additional requirements needed during illicit activity (i.e. money\nlaundering).\n\nIs it clear now why this has traditionally been a state-sponsor-exclusive club? Very few\ncybercriminals have that kind of money to splash on a vulnerability. And even fewer of them\nwill be actually motivated to invest that sum when organizations still have public-facing\nremote desktop protocol (RDP) appliances in their networks (and yes, there are a lot of\nthem). But an espionage campaign of a state-sponsored APT group can easily justify sinking\nfunds into an exclusive zero-day, if it reels in invaluable information.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Rise of the Exploit-as-a-Service Model?\n\nFeel like a multi-million dollar price tag may be a bit too much for your pockets? No worries,\nthe cybercriminal community doesn’t leave anyone behind to miss out on all the zero-day\nfun! During our investigation for this research piece we’ve noticed cybercriminals discussing\nideas for an Exploit-as-a-Service business model that would inevitably lower the barrier for\naccessing sophisticated exploits.\n\nThis model would allow capable threat actors to “lease” zero-day exploits to other\ncybercriminals to conduct their attacks. In fact, while a developer can generate large profits\nwhen selling a zero-day exploit, it often takes them a significant amount of time to complete\nsuch a sale. However, this model would enable zero-day developers to generate substantial\nearnings by renting the zero-day out while waiting for a definitive buyer. Additionally, renting\nparties could test the proposed zero-day and later decide whether to purchase the exploit on\nan exclusive or non-exclusive basis.\n\nZero-day exploit developers can certainly generate large profits by selling to governmentbacked threat actors, but this process can eat up time and drive the developers to seek\nalternative revenue sources. And that’s when exploit-as-a-service becomes\nviable―generating their desired income from various interested parties. The result? More\nand more financially motivated threat actors with their hands on dangerous tools.\n\n## Old Vulnerabilities Are Still a Serious Problem\n\nZero-days and high-profile threat actors can certainly make up for great insights into the\ncybercriminal world but they do only represent a tiny fraction of this complex ecosystem. The\nwide majority of the cybercriminal community is in fact busy discussing and sharing\nknowledge on older vulnerabilities that security teams haven’t properly patched yet.\n\nApart from a few exceptions, the cybercriminal community is known for being opportunistic\nand targeting the low-hanging fruit rather than mounting highly-sophisticated offensive\ncampaigns. Overlooked security flaws in software and hardware may well provide\ncybercriminals with valuable initial access to a victim’s environment and cause some serious\nharm from there.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Nothing will ever hurt more_\nThe user base for older vulnerabilities is broad. For starters, many low-skilled cybercriminals\nneed some time before they can exploit a new vulnerability, and maybe even need support\nfrom the cybercriminal community, like tutorials or guides on how to use the latest exploit.\nThen there are the penny-pinchers. Despite the high payouts associated with cybercrime,\nwe’re all now aware that the best (zero-day) exploits don’t come cheap. It can be worthwhile\nto wait for a vulnerability to become more mainstream, with corresponding PoCs or exploits\nreleased for free or at a lower price.\n\n## Strengthen your Fortress with Vulnerability Intelligence\n\nOk, maybe the ideal world described at the beginning of this blog is still far away from our\nradar. However, security teams can still significantly improve their security posture with a few\nchanges to their habits. For example, incorporating a risk-based approach to vulnerability\nmanagement can go a long way in helping security teams navigate this sea of vulnerabilities.\nA framework based on the impact and likelihood of vulnerability exploitation can certainly\nhelp mitigate some of the triaging and asset management challenges mentioned above.\n\nHowever, making informed decisions requires a good dose of contextual knowledge around\nthe latest vulnerabilities disclosed. Identifying intelligence needs based on your threat model\nis therefore crucial to improve triaging and patching processes. Incorporating vulnerability\nintelligence will help you prevent and quickly mitigate the most relevant threats for your\nspecific organization. And once fused into your organization’s threat model, vulnerability\n\n\n-----\n\nintelligence can be used across a variety of internal functions to improve security planning,\nsuch as triaging threats, communicating them across the board, and mitigating them in a\ntimely and accurate manner.\n\n[Want to hear more about it?
