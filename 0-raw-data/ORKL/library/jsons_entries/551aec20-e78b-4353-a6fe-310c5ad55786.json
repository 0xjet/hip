    "plain_text": "# APT Threat Landscape of Taiwan in 2020\n\n**[teamt5.org/en/posts/apt-threat-landscape-of-taiwan-in-2020/](https://teamt5.org/en/posts/apt-threat-landscape-of-taiwan-in-2020/)**\n\nCharles Li\n\n5.10.2021Charles Li\n\nShare:\n**By TeamT5 CTO Charles Li**\n\n2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of\nCOVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president\nelection, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping\nnumerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) .\nIn the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities.\nCompared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them\nare reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our\nobservation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.\n\nIn this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:\n\nEvolution of APT tactic\n\n\n-----\n\nSupply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks\n\nCOVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nWe will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view,\nwhich is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion\nand suggestions to respond with APT attacks.\n\n## Evolution of APT tactic\n\nIn 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several\nenergy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized\ncampaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political\ndeterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it\nhas marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed\nTaiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but\nthe threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.\n\nAnother cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS\nplatform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with\nattempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors\nabused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5\nintelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese\nAPT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also\nverified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack. We consider both events to\nbe indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not\nobserved in the past.\n\n## Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks\n\nSupply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and\nTeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the\nmost successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500\ncompanies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the\nscope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar\nattacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to\ninfect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau\n(MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be\n\n\n-----\n\neven bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private\ncorporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct\nChina nexus group were involved in these operations.\n\n## COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the\noutbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence\nfor the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing\nCOVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In\nTaiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure\ntheme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend\nwill continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.\n\nTeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in\n2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and\nattacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are\nactive in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of\nChinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information\nTechnology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a\ndramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of\nthreat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be\ngood hopping points by actors to access various industries.\n\nThe third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at\nleast attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to\ncontrol our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime.\nEducation or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they\ntend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision\nmakings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor\nindustries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered\nby Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was\nalso adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also\ntwo industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph,\nCOVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we\nwould like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which\nwe called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related\nentities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from\nthis specific group.\n\n\n-----\n\n_2020 APT target industries distribution_\n\nTeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China.\nHUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their\nattacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost\nall the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs\nwere also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse,\nBronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are\nquite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial\nentities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their\nfootprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this\ngroup for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility\nfrom their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and\ntake control of them in case of emergency status.\n\nAMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and\nIT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft.\nBut the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what\nthey did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code\nnames for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years.\nTheir activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT\ngroup that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their\nspear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID\n\n-----\n\n19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last\ninteresting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a\nnotorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the\nvictim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But\nthe Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their\ngovernment agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese\nbank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still\nexist in Taiwan.\n\n_Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of\nTaiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective\ndefense. TeamT5 research shows that APT attacks keep evolving to become very complex\nand impossible for a security product to defend. TeamT5 has a cyber threat intelligence (CTI)\n[centered solution, ThreatVision, and we rely on a dedicated team of security experts to keep](https://teamt5.org/en/products/threatvision/)\nus steps ahead of threat actors.
