Possible use after free due to improper\nhandling of memory mapping of multiple processes simultaneously.\n\nQualcomm - Detection of Error Condition Without Action in Graphics. Improper\nhandling of address deregistration on failure can lead to new GPU address\nallocation failure.\n\nARM - Mali GPU Kernel Driver allows improper operations on GPU memory. A\nnon-privileged user can make improper operations on GPU memory to enter into\na use-after-free scenario and may be able to gain root privilege, and/or disclose\ninformation.\n\nARM - Mali GPU Kernel Driver elevates CPU RO pages to writable. A nonprivileged user can get a write access to read-only memory, and may be able to\ngain root privilege, corrupt memory and modify the memory of other processes.\n\n\nThis month's Android security updates also include patches for critical vulnerabilities in the\nSystem component that could be exploited by remote attackers using specially crafted files\nto execute arbitrary malicious code within the context of a privileged process.\n\nRegrettably, users who haven't switched to new devices that still receive monthly security\nupdates might not be able to install these patches.\n\nTo put things into perspective, more than 9% of all Android devices are still running Android\n8.1 Oreo (released in December 2017), and roughly 19% Android Pie 9.0 (released in\n[August 2018), according to StatCounter data.](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/android)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn December, Qualcomm also [addressed a high severity security vulnerability in Mobile](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qualcomm-vulnerability-impacts-nearly-40-percent-of-all-mobile-phones/)\nStation Modem (MSM) chips (including the latest 5G-capable versions) that could allow\nattackers to access smartphone users' text messages, call history, and listen in on their\nconversations.\n\nLast year, [Qualcomm fixed more vulnerabilities impacting the Snapdragon chip Digital Signal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nearly-50-percent-of-all-smartphones-affected-by-qualcomm-snapdragon-bugs/)\nProcessor (DSP) chip and enabling attackers to take control of smartphones without user\ninteraction and create unremovable malware that can evade detection.\n\nOther bugs that could allow decrypting some WPA2-encrypted wireless network\npackets, [accessing critical data, and two flaws in the Snapdragon SoC WLAN firmware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qualcomm-bug-exposes-critical-data-on-samsung-lg-phones/)\n[allowing over the air compromise of the modem and the Android kernel were also patched](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qualpwn-bugs-in-snapdragon-soc-can-attack-android-over-the-air/)\nduring the last two years.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Google: Predator spyware infected Android devices using zero-days](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-predator-spyware-infected-android-devices-using-zero-days/)\n\n[Google Chrome emergency update fixes zero-day used in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chrome-emergency-update-fixes-zero-day-used-in-attacks/)\n\n[Microsoft finds severe bugs in Android apps from large mobile providers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-finds-severe-bugs-in-android-apps-from-large-mobile-providers/)\n\n[Mozilla fixes Firefox, Thunderbird zero-days exploited at Pwn2Own](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mozilla-fixes-firefox-thunderbird-zero-days-exploited-at-pwn2own/)\n\n[CISA adds 41 vulnerabilities to list of bugs used in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-adds-41-vulnerabilities-to-list-of-bugs-used-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n\n-----",
