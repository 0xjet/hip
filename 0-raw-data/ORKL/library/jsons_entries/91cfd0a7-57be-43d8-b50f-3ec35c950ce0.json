To\n[avoid being discovered by EDR and antivirus programs, hacking groups and ransomware](https://socradar.io/suites/cyber-threat-intelligence/big-threat-share-data-search/)\noperations are switching from Cobalt Strike to the more recent Brute Ratel post-exploitation\ntoolkit.\n\n[One of the most popular toolkits in red team engagements is Cobalt Strike, which enables](https://socradar.io/dark-web-profile-avoslocker-ransomware/)\nattackers to install beacons on compromised devices to conduct remote network surveillance\nor send commands.\n\nHacker groups and ransomware attacks also use this tool to expand laterally through\ninfected corporate networks.\n\n[To replace Cobalt Strike for red team penetration testing engagements, ex-red team member](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)\n[Chetan Nayak published Brute Ratel Command and Control Center (BRc4) in 2020.](https://bruteratel.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## About Brute Ratel\n\n[Brute Ratel is the most advanced red team simulation software at the moment. It can provide](https://socradar.io/what-is-red-teaming-and-how-does-it-work/)\na structured timeline and simulate the cyber kill chain. Cybersecurity teams can use it to\nvalidate cyberattacks and strengthen their defenses. Despite being a post-exploitation tool, it\ndoes not assist in creating exploits.\n\nBrute Ratel enables the red team to deploy badgers on remote hosts. Badgers function\nsimilarly to Cobalt Strike beacons and connect to the attacker’s C2 server for RCE.\n\n[Brute Ratel’s features and more details can be found on the software’s official site.](https://bruteratel.com/tabs/features/)\n\n## Threat Actors Were Able To Acquire Licenses\n\nDespite Cobalt Strike being a legal piece of software, threat actors have been spreading\ncracked versions of it online, making it one of the most widely utilized tools by hackers\n[and ransomware operations.](https://socradar.io/%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bwhy-ransomware-is-a-major-threat-to-certain-industries/)\n\nBrute Ratel is currently only available to verified companies at a cost. Chetan Nayak, the\ndeveloper of Brute Ratel, stated that the license was leaked by a customer’s employee,\nexplaining how the attackers could use it in their operations.\n\nAlthough Nayak could revoke the license afterward, former Conti ransomware members\nwere discovered using fake company profiles to gain access to the software’s license.\n\n“In one case, they have gained access to the Brute Ratel kit used for post-exploitation in\ntargeted attacks from BumbleBee loader. The ultimate goal of the Brute Ratel usage was the\npost-exploitation framework for lateral movement and subsequent network encryption via\n[ransomware payload.” AdvIntel’s CEO said.](https://www.advintel.io/)\n\nThreat actors spread malicious ISOs that appear to include submitted resumes (CV) in\nattacks thought to be connected to the Russian state-sponsored hacking organization APT29\n(also known as CozyBear and Dukes).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Malicious ISO file’s contents (Source: Bleeping Computer)_\nHowever, as seen in the file’s properties below, the Roshan-Bandara_CV_Dialog resume file\nis a Windows shortcut that will start the included OneDriveUpdater[.]exe file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Windows shortcut_\n\n_disguised as CV to launch a program (Source: Bleeping Computer)_\nUpon clicking Roshan-Bandara_CV_Dialog, cmd[.]exe is launched:\n\n/c start OneDriveUpdater[.]exe (Using the Windows start command, the executable is\nlaunched from the current directory)\n\n[Microsoft’s executable is used to sync data to Cloud servers.

The actors**\nmodified this DLL to load an encrypted payload file (OneDrive.update).\n\nThe file is subsequently decrypted, and the modification’s first stage of the shellcode is\nloaded into memory. To preserve code capabilities, threat actors also use DLL proxying\ntechnique (vresion.dll for version.dll).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe in-memory code, Brute Ratel C4, starts to communicate with IP 174.129.157[.]251 on\nTCP port 443 as a Windows thread while running in the RuntimeBroker[.]exe process space.\n\nThe below image shows how ISOs would look if the show hidden files option were enabled.\n\n_ISOs appear_\n\n_when “Show hidden files” is enabled (Source: Unit42)_\n**OneDriveUpdater[.]exe is a legal Microsoft executable, but the version[.]dll it loads has**\nbeen altered to serve as a loader for a Brute Ratel badger that is loaded into the\n**RuntimeBroker[.]exe process.**\n\nThe threat actors can [remotely access the infected device once the Brute Ratel has been](https://socradar.io/top-5-tactics-threat-actors-use-for-initial-access/)\nloaded in order to run commands and spread farther throughout the compromised network.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Brute Ratel C4 ISO Samples:\n\n1FC7B0E1054D54CE8F1DE0CC95976081C7A85C7926C03172A3DDAA672690042C\n\n**X64 Brute Ratel C4 Windows Kernel Module:**\n\n31ACF37D180AB9AFBCF6A4EC5D29C3E19C947641A2D9CE3CE56D71C1F576C069\n\n**APT29 ISO Samples:**\n\nF58AE9193802E9BAF17E6B59E3FDBE3E9319C5D27726D60802E3E82D30D14D46\n\n**X64 Brute Ratel C4 Samples:**\n\n\n-----\n\n3ED21A4BFCF9838E06AD3058D13D5C28026C17DC996953A22A00F0609B0DF3B9\n3AD53495851BAFC48CAF6D2227A434CA2E0BEF9AB3BD40ABFE4EA8F318D37BBE\n\n973F573CAB683636D9A70B8891263F59E2F02201FFB4DD2E9D7ECBB1521DA03E\n\nDD8652E2DCFE3F1A72631B3A9585736FBE77FFABEE4098F6B3C48E1469BF27AA\n\nE1A9B35CF1378FDA12310F0920C5C53AD461858B3CB575697EA125DFEE829611\nEF9B60AA0E4179C16A9AC441E0A21DC3A1C3DC04B100EE487EABF5C5B1F571A6\n\nD71DC7BA8523947E08C6EEC43A726FE75AED248DFD3A7C4F6537224E9ED05F6F\n\n5887C4646E032E015AA186C5970E8F07D3ED1DE8DBFA298BA4522C89E547419B\n\n**Malicious DLLs:**\n\nEA2876E9175410B6F6719F80EE44B9553960758C7D0F7BED73C0FE9A78D8E669\n\n**Malicious Encrypted Payloads:**\n\nB5D1D3C1AEC2F2EF06E7D0B7996BC45DF4744934BD66266A6EBB02D70E35236E\n\n**X.509 Cert SHA1s:**\n\n55684a30a47476fce5b42cbd59add4b0fbc776a3\n\n66aab897e33b3e4d940c51eba8d07f5605d5b275\n\n**Infrastructure linked to X.509 Certs or Samples:**\n\n104.6.92[.]229\n\n137.184.199[.]17\n\n138.68.50[.]218\n\n138.68.58[.]43\n\n139.162.195[.]169\n\n139.180.187[.]179\n\n147.182.247[.]103\n\n149.154.100[.]151\n\n15.206.84[.]52\n\n159.223.49[.]16\n\n159.65.186[.]50\n\n162.216.240[.]61\n\n172.105.102[.]247\n\n172.81.62[.]82\n\n174.129.157[.]251\n\n178.79.143[.]149\n\n178.79.168[.]110\n\n178.79.172[.]35\n\n18.133.26[.]247\n\n18.130.233[.]249\n\n\n-----\n\n18.217.179[.]8\n18.236.92[.]31\n\n185.138.164[.]112\n\n194.29.186[.]67\n\n194.87.70[.]14\n\n213.168.249[.]232\n\n3.110.56[.]219\n\n3.133.7[.]69\n\n31.184.198[.]83\n\n34.195.122[.]225\n\n34.243.172[.]90\n\n35.170.243[.]216\n\n45.144.225[.]3\n\n45.76.155[.]71\n\n45.79.36[.]192\n\n52.48.51[.]67\n\n52.90.228[.]203\n\n54.229.102[.]30\n\n54.90.137[.]213\n\n89.100.107[.]65\n\n92.255.85[.]173\n\n92.255.85[.]44\n\n94.130.130[.]43\n\nds.windowsupdate.eu[.]org\n\n\n-----",
