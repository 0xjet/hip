The rapidity and volume of attacks prove that the actors behind\nBlack Basta are well-organized and well-resourced, and yet there has been no indications of\nBlack Basta attempting to recruit affiliates or advertising as a RaaS on the usual darknet\nforums or crimeware marketplaces. This has led to much speculation about the origin,\nidentity and operation of the Black Basta ransomware group.\n\nOur research indicates that the individuals behind Black Basta ransomware develop and\nmaintain their own toolkit and either exclude affiliates or only collaborate with a limited and\ntrusted set of affiliates, in similar ways to other ‘private’ ransomware groups such as Conti,\nTA505, and Evilcorp.\n\nSentinelLabs’ full report provides a detailed analysis of Black Basta’s operational TTPs,\nincluding the use of multiple custom tools likely developed by one or more FIN7 (aka\nCarbanak) developers. In this post, we summarize the report’s key findings.\n\n[Read the Full Report](https://assets.sentinelone.com/sentinellabs22/SentinelLabs-BlackBasta?lb-mode=overlay)\n\n## Black Basta’s Initial Access Activity\n\n\n-----\n\nSentinelLabs began tracking Black Basta operations in early June after noticing overlaps\n[between ostensibly different cases. Along with other researchers, we noted that Black Basta](https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/06/06/shining-the-light-on-black-basta/)\ninfections began with Qakbot delivered by email and macro-based MS Office documents,\n[ISO+LNK droppers and .docx documents exploiting the MSDTC remote code execution](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/who-needs-macros-threat-actors-pivot-to-abusing-explorer-and-other-lolbins-via-windows-shortcuts/)\nvulnerability, [CVE-2022-30190.](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/staying-ahead-of-cve-2022-30190-follina/)\n\nOne of the interesting initial access vectors we observed was an ISO dropper shipped as\n“Report Jul 14 39337.iso” that exploits a DLL hijacking in `calc.exe . Once the user clicks`\non the “Report Jul 14 39337.lnk” inside the ISO dropper, it runs the command\n```\ncmd.exe /q /c calc.exe\n\n```\ntriggering the DLL hijacking inside the calc binary and executing a Qakbot DLL,\n```\nWindowsCodecs.dll .\n\n```\nQakbot obtains a persistent foothold in the victim environment by setting a scheduled task\nwhich references a malicious PowerShell stored in the registry, acting as a listener and\nloader.\n\nThe `powershell.exe process continues to communicate with different servers, waiting for`\nan operator to send a command to activate the post-exploitation capability.\n\nWhen an operator connects to the backdoor, typically hours or days after the initial infection,\na new explorer.exe process is created and a process hollowing is performed to hide\nmalicious activity behind the legitimate process. This injection operation occurs every time a\ncomponent of the Qakbot framework is invoked or for any arbitrary process run manually by\nthe attacker.\n\n## Enter the Black Basta Operator\n\nManual reconnaissance is performed when the Black Basta operator connects to the victim\nthrough the Qakbot backdoor.\n\nReconnaissance utilities used by the operator are staged in a directory with deceptive names\nsuch as “Intel” or “Dell”, created in the root drive `C:\\ .`\n\nThe first step in a Black Basta compromise usually involves executing a uniquely obfuscated\nversion of the AdFind tool, named `AF.exe .`\n```\ncmd /C C:\\intel\\AF.exe -f objectcategory=computer -csv name cn OperatingSystem\ndNSHostName > C:\\intel\\[REDACTED].csv\n\n\n```\nThis stage also often involves the use of two custom `.NET assemblies loaded in memory to`\nperform various information gathering tasks. These assemblies are not obfuscated and the\nmain internal class names, “Processess” and “GetOnlineComputers”, provide a good clue to\n\n\n-----\n\ntheir functions. Black Basta operators have been observed using SharpHound and\nBloodHound frameworks for AD enumeration via LDAP queries. The collector is also run in\nmemory as a `.NET assembly.`\n\nFor network scanning, Black Basta uses the SoftPerfect network scanner, `netscan.exe . In`\naddition, the WMI service is leveraged to enumerate installed security solutions.\n```\nwmic /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiVirusProduct GET /value\n\nwmic /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiSpywareProduct GET /value\n\nwmic /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 PATH FirewallProduct GET /value\n\n\n## Black Basta Privilege Escalation Techniques\n\n```\nBeyond the reconnaissance stage, Black Basta attempts local and domain level privilege\nescalation through a variety of exploits. We have seen the use of ZeroLogon (CVE-20201472), NoPac (CVE-2021-42287, CVE-2021-42278) and PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527).\n\nThere are two versions of the ZeroLogon exploit in use: an obfuscated version dropped as\nzero22.exe and a non-obfuscated version dropped as `zero.exe . In one intrusion, we`\nobserved the Black Basta operator exploiting the PrintNightmare vulnerability and dropping\n[spider.dll as the payload. The DLL creates a new admin user with username “Crackenn” and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/f/black-basta-ransomware-operators-expand-their-attack-arsenal-wit.html)\npassword “*aaa111Cracke”:\n\nReversed code for spider.dll\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DLL first sets the user and password into a struct (userInfo) then calls the NetUserAdd\nWin API to create a user with a never-expiring password. It then adds “Administrators” and\n“Remote Desktop Users” groups to that account. Next, `spider.dll creates the`\n```\nRunTimeListen.exe process, which runs the SystemBC (aka Coroxy) backdoor, described\n\n```\nbelow.\n\nAt this stage, Black Basta operators cover their tracks by deleting the added user and the\nDLL planted with the PrintNightmare exploit.\n\n## Remote Admin Tools\n\nBlack Basta operators have a number of RAT tools in their arsenal.\n\nThe threat actor has been observed dropping a self-extracting archive containing all the files\nneeded to run the Netsupport Manager application, staged in the `C:\\temp folder with the`\nname `Svvhost.exe . Execution of the file extracts all installation files into:`\n```\nC:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Roaming\\MSN\\\n\n\n```\nArchive of installation files for Netsupport Manager dropped by Black Basta\nThe RAT is then executed through a `run.bat script.`\n\n\n-----\n\nContent of run.bat script\nIn other cases, we have observed the usage of Splashtop, GoToAssist, Atera Agent as well\nas SystemBC, which has been used by different ransomware operators as a SOCKS5 TOR\nproxy for communications, data exfiltration, and the download of malicious modules.\n\n## Black Basta Lateral Movement\n\nThe Black Basta actor has been seen using different methods for lateral movement,\ndeploying different batch scripts through psexec towards different machines in order to\nautomate process and services termination and to impair defenses. Ransomware has also\nbeen deployed through a multitude of machines via psexec.\n\nIn the most recent Black Basta incidents we observed, a batch file named `SERVI.bat was`\ndeployed through `psexec on all the endpoints of the targeted infrastructure. This script was`\ndeployed by the attacker to kill services and processes in order to maximize the ransomware\nimpact, delete the shadow copies and kill certain security solutions.\n\nPartial\n\ncontent of SERVI.bat\n\n## Impair Defenses\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to impair the host s defenses prior to dropping the locker payload, Black Basta\ntargets installed security solutions with specific batch scripts downloaded into the Windows\ndirectory.\n\nIn order to disable Windows Defender, the following scripts are executed:\n```\n\\Windows\\ILUg69ql1.bat\n\n\\Windows\\ILUg69ql2.bat\n\n\\Windows\\ILUg69ql3.bat\n\n\n```\nThe batch scripts found in different intrusions also appear to have a naming convention:\nILUg69ql followed by a digit.\n```\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -command \"New-ItemProperty -Path\n'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender' -Name DisableAntiSpyware -Value\n1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force\"\n\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -command \"Set-MpPreference DisableRealtimeMonitoring 1\"\n\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass Uninstall-WindowsFeature -Name Windows-Defender\n\n\n```\nAccording to the [official documentation, the DisableAntiSpyware parameter disables the](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/security-malware-windows-defender-disableantispyware)\nWindows Defender Antivirus in order to deploy another security solution. The\n**_DisableRealtimeMonitoring is used to disable real time protection and then Uninstall-_**\n**_WindowsFeature -Name Windows-Defender to uninstall Windows Defender._**\n\n## Black Basta and the FIN7 Connection\n\nIn multiple Black Basta incidents, the threat actors made use of a custom defense\nimpairment tool. Analysis showed that this tool was used in incidents from 3rd June 2022\nonwards and found exclusively in Black Basta incidents. Based on this evidence, we assess\nit is highly likely that this tool is specific to the Black Basta’s group arsenal.\n\nOur investigation led us to a further custom tool, `WindefCheck.exe, an executable packed`\nwith [UPX. The unpacked sample is a binary compiled with Visual Basic. The main](https://upx.github.io/)\nfunctionality is to show a fake Windows Security GUI and tray icon with a “healthy” system\nstatus, even if Windows Defender and other system functionalities are disabled.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fake Windows Security GUI WindefCheck.exe\nAnalysis of the tool led us to further samples, one of which was packed with an unknown\npacker. After unpacking, we identified it as the BIRDDOG backdoor, connecting to a C2\nserver at `45[.]67[.]229[.]148 . BIRDDOG, also known as` [SocksBot, is a backdoor that](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.socksbot)\n[has been used in multiple operations by the FIN7](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/fin7-pursuing-an-enigmatic-and-evasive-global-criminal-operation) [group.](https://www.accenture.com/t00010101T000000Z__w__/gb-en/_acnmedia/PDF-83/Accenture-Goldfin-Security-Alert.pdf)\n\nFurther, we note that the IP address `45[.]67[.]229[.]148 is hosted on “pq.hosting”, the`\nbullet proof hosting provider of choice used by FIN7 when targeting victims.\n\nWe discovered further samples on public malware repositories packed with the same packer\nbut compiled about two months before the BIRDDOG packed sample. Unpacking one of\nthese samples revealed it to be a Cobalt Strike DNS beacon connecting to the domain\n“jardinoks.com”.\n\nComparison of the samples suggests that the packer used for the BIRDDOG backdoor is an\nupdated version of the packer used for the Cobalt Strike DNS beacon.\n\n\n-----\n\nLeft: Cobalt Strike DNS beacon; Right: BIRDDOG backdoor\nWe assess it is likely the threat actor developing the impairment tool used by Black Basta is\nthe same actor with access to the packer source code used in FIN7 operations, thus\nestablishing for the first time a possible connection between the two groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Uncovering Further Ties Between Black Basta and FIN7\n\nFIN7 is a financially motivated group that has been active since 2012 running multiple\noperations targeting various industry sectors. The group is also known as “Carbanak”, the\nname of the backdoor they used, but there were different groups that also used the same\nmalware and which are tracked differently.\n\nInitially, FIN7 used POS (Point of Sale) malware to conduct financial frauds. However, since\n2020 they switched to ransomware operations, affiliating to REvil, Conti and also conducting\ntheir own operations: first as Darkside and later rebranded as BlackMatter.\n\nAt this point, it’s likely that FIN7 or an affiliate began writing tools from scratch in order to\ndisassociate their new operations from the old. Based on our analysis, we believe that the\ncustom impairment tool described above is one such tool.\n\nCollaboration with other third party researchers provided us with a plethora of data that\nfurther supports our hypothesis. In early 2022, the threat actor appears to have been\nconducting detection tests and attack simulations using various delivery methods for\ndroppers, Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter C2 frameworks, as well as custom tools and plugins.\nThe simulated activity was observed months later in the wild during attacks against live\nvictims. Analysis of these simulations also provided us with a few IP addresses which we\nbelieve to be attributed to the threat actor.\n\nThe SentinelLabs full report describes these activities in detail.\n\n## Attribution of the Threat Actor: FIN7\n\nWe assess it is highly likely the BlackBasta ransomware operation has ties with FIN7.\nFurthermore, we assess it is likely that the developer(s) behind their tools to impair victim\ndefenses is, or was, a developer for FIN7.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe crimeware ecosystem is constantly expanding, changing, and evolving. FIN7 (or\nCarbanak) is often credited with innovating in the criminal space, taking attacks against\nbanks and PoS systems to new heights beyond the schemes of their peers.\n\nAs we clarify the hand behind the elusive Black Basta ransomware operation, we aren’t\nsurprised to see a familiar face behind this ambitious closed-door operation. While there are\nmany new faces and diverse threats in the ransomware and double extortion space, we\nexpect to see the existing professional criminal outfits putting their own spin on maximizing\nillicit profits in new ways.\n\n[Read the Full Report](https://assets.sentinelone.com/sentinellabs22/SentinelLabs-BlackBasta?lb-mode=overlay)\n\n\n-----",
