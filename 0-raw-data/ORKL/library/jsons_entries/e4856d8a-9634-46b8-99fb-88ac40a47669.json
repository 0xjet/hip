The Geographical extent is so far unknown, so please exercise caution. The SMS /\n[MMS in question arrives with the following contents (sanitized by Heimdal Security):](https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/products/thor-premium-home)\n\nYou have received a multimedia message from +[country code] [sender number]\nFollow the link http: //www.mmsforyou [.] Net / mms.apk to view the message.\n\nIf the APK (which is a program file for Android) is run on an Android-powered smartphone,\nthen it will gain administrator rights on the victim’s device. This will allow the attackers to:\n\nSEND_SMS\nRECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED\nINTERNET\nSYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW\nWRITE_SMS\nACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\nWAKE_LOCK\nGET_TASKS\nCALL_PHONE\nRECEIVE_SMS\nREAD_PHONE_STATE\n\n\n-----\n\nREAD_SMS\nERASE_PHONE\n\n**Our team has identified the malicious APK to be the Mazar Android BOT, a threat also**\nthat [Recorded Future spotted in November 2015. The malicious packet (APK) retrieves](https://www.recordedfuture.com/mazar-android-bot/)\n**TOR and installs it on the victim’s phone via the following harmless URLs: https: //f-**\ndroid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.torproject.android https:\n//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android In the next phase of the\nattack, the infection will unpack and run the TOR application, which will then be used to\n**connect to the following server: http: // pc35hiptpcwqezgs [.] Onion. After that, an**\nautomated SMS will be sent to the number 9876543210 (+98 is the country code for Iran)\nwith the text message: “Thank you”. The catch is that this SMS also includes the device’s\n**location data.**\n[Mazar BOT – the Android #malware that can erase your phone is on the loose:](https://twitter.com/share?text=Mazar+BOT+-+the+Android+%23malware+that+can+erase+your+phone+is+on+the+loose%3A&via=heimdalsecurity&related=heimdalsecurity&url=https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/security-alert-mazar-bot-active-attacks-android-malware/)\n[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?text=Mazar+BOT+-+the+Android+%23malware+that+can+erase+your+phone+is+on+the+loose%3A&via=heimdalsecurity&related=heimdalsecurity&url=https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/security-alert-mazar-bot-active-attacks-android-malware/)\n\n## Insidious mobile malware with crippling options\n\n\n-----\n\nThis specific mobile malware opens the doors to all kinds of malicious consequences for the\nvictim. Attackers can:\n\nOpen a backdoor into Android smartphones, to monitor and control them as they\nplease;\n**Send SMS messages to premium channel numbers, seriously increasing the**\nvictim’s phone bill;\n**Read SMS messages, which means they can also read authentication codes sent**\n**as part of** **[two-factor authentication mechanisms, used also by online banking apps](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/start-using-two-factor-authentication)**\nand ecommerce websites;\nUse their full access to Android phones to basically manipulate the device to do\n**whatever they want.**\n\nAnd it gets worse.\n\n## Polipo proxy and Man-in-the-Middle Attack\n\n[The attackers behind Mazar BOT also implemented the “Polipo proxy“, which gives them](https://github.com/splondike/polipoid)\nadditional access to even more Android functionalities.\n\nPolipoid brings the Polipo HTTP proxy to Android. Polipo lets you do useful things such\nas cache web pages for offline access and should generally speed up browsing a little.\n\nSource: [Github Through this proxy, cyber criminals can change the traffic and interpose](https://github.com/splondike/polipoid)\nthemselves between the victim’s phone and a web-based service. This effectively becomes a\n**[Man-in-the-Middle attack. Here’s how it happens: Data is copied to your phone as mp3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)**\nfiles: 122.933 polipo.mp3 1,885,100 tor.mp3 Then, the proxy is configured as you can see\nbelow: 174.398 debiancacerts.bks 574 torpolipo.conf 879 torpolipo_old.conf 212 torrc 276\ntorrc_old For those technically inclined, the configuration of the TOR proxy will seem quite\nstraightforward: proxy address = “127.0.0.1” proxy port = 8118 allowedClients = 127.0.0.1\nallowedPorts = 1-65535 proxy name = “127.0.0.1” cacheIsShared = false socksParentProxy\n= “127.0.0.1:9050” socksProxyType = socks5 diskCacheRoot = “” localDocumentRoot = “”\ndisableLocalInterface = true disableConfiguration = true dnsUseGethostbyname = yes\ndisableVia = true from, accept-language, x-pad link censor referer = maybe\nmaxConnectionAge = 5m maxConnectionRequests = 120 serverMaxSlots = 8 server slots =\n2 tunnelAllowedPorts = 1-65535 chunkHighMark = 11000000 object high mark = 128\n\n## An even higher degree of compromise: Chrome injects\n\nAs if it weren’t enough that it can stop calls and launch other aggressive commands on\nthe victim’s phone, Mazar BOT is also capable of injecting itself into Chrome.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd there are several other settings and commands that Mazar BOT can trigger, as\nshowcased below. These include:\n\nControlling the phone’s keys\nEnabling the sleep mode\nSave actions in the phone’s settings, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mazar BOT won t run on Russian Android smartphones\n\nOur team was not surprised to observe that the malware cannot be installed on\n**smartphones running Android with the Russian language option. Mazar BOT will check**\nthe phone to identify the victim’s country and this will stop the malicious APK if the targeted\nphone turns out to be owned by a Russian user: locale.getCountry () equalsIgnoreCase (\n“RU”)) Process.killProcess (Process.myPid ());\n\n**Until now, Mazar BOT has been advertised for sale on several websites on the** **Dark**\n**Web, but this is the first time we’ve seen this code be abused in active attacks.**\nAttackers may be testing this new type of Android malware to see how they can improve\ntheir tactics and reach their final goals, which probably is making more money (as always).\nWe can expect this malware to expand its reach, also because of its ability to remain covert\nby using TOR to hide its communication. As you may have anticipated, antivirus\n**detection of the malicious APK is very low:** **[3/54 on VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/73c9bf90cb8573db9139d028fa4872e93a528284c02616457749d40878af8cf8/analysis/)**\n\n\n-----\n\nClick here for [the full infection rates at the time the campaign was analyzed.](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/MazarBOT-virustotal-detection-February-12-2016.png)\n\n## How to protect yourself from Mazar BOT\n\nThere are a few things you can do to keep your phone safe from Mazar BOT, and we\nrecommend you take a moment now to verify and adjust these settings. 1. First of all,\n**NEVER click on links in SMS or MMS messages on your phone. Android phones are**\nnotoriously vulnerable and current security product dedicated to this OS are not nearly as\neffective as they are on computers. 2. Go to Settings > Security and make sure this\n**option is turned OFF: „Unknown Sources – Allow installation of apps from sources other**\nthan the playstore.”\n\n\n-----\n\n**3. Install a top antivirus for Android. It may not be enough to protect your phone, but it’s**\ncertainly good to have. You can find [top-rated options in this article. 4. Do not connect to](http://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-antivirus,review-2588-7.html)\n**unknown and unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots. There are plenty of dangers lurking out there,**\n[and following some common-sense steps to keep yourself safe from them is the best thing to](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/11-security-steps-public-wi-fi-networks/)\ndo. Also, keep your Wi-Fi turned OFF when you don’t use it.\n\n[Follow these steps to protect your Android phone from the ruthless Mazar BOT #malware:](https://twitter.com/share?text=Follow+these+steps+to+protect+your+Android+phone+from+the+ruthless+Mazar+BOT+%23malware%3A&via=heimdalsecurity&related=heimdalsecurity&url=https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/security-alert-mazar-bot-active-attacks-android-malware/)\n[Click To Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?text=Follow+these+steps+to+protect+your+Android+phone+from+the+ruthless+Mazar+BOT+%23malware%3A&via=heimdalsecurity&related=heimdalsecurity&url=https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/security-alert-mazar-bot-active-attacks-android-malware/)\n\n**5. Install a VPN on your smartphone and use constantly. It’s good for both your privacy**\nand your security. 6. Maintain a cautious attitude at all times. Android security has not\nkept up with the high adoption rate of smartphones running the OS, and users may have to\nwait a long time until better security solutions appear. Until then, a careful evaluation of what\nhappens on your phone is a very good safeguard.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you liked this post, you will enjoy our newsletter.\n\nReceive new articles directly in your inbox\n\n\n-----",
