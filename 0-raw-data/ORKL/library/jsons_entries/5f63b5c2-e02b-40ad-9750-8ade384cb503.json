But it appears\nsomeone who bought the code then leaked it on a forum in December, perhaps to increase\n[his standing, wrote Limor Kessem, a cybersecurity analyst with IBM Trusteer.](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&url=https://securityintelligence.com/android-malware-about-to-get-worse-gm-bot-source-code-leaked&xcust=2-1-419717-1-0-0&sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/419717/source-code-for-powerful-android-banking-malware-is-leaked.html)\n\nThe person included an encrypted archive file containing the source code of GM Bot,\naccording to Kessem.\n\n“He indicated he would give the password to the archive only to active forum members who\napproached him,” Kessem wrote. “Those who received the password in turn passed it on to\nother, unintended users, so the actual distribution of the code went well beyond that\ndiscussion board’s member list.”\n\nThe source code of powerful banking trojans has been leaked before with apps such as\nZeus, SpyEye and Carberp, Kessem wrote.\n\n“While GM Bot may not be as prolific as the major banking Trojans mentioned here, it is\ndefinitely a game changer in the realm of mobile threats,” Kessem added.\n\nGM Bot emerged in late 2014 on Russian-speaking forums. It exploits an issue known as\n[activity hijacking in older Android devices that allow an overlay to be displayed over a](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&url=http://oasam.org/en/oasam/oasam-uir-unauthorized-intent-receipt/oasam-uir-002-activity-hijacking&xcust=2-1-419717-1-0-0&sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/419717/source-code-for-powerful-android-banking-malware-is-leaked.html)\nlegitimate application.\n\nGoogle has put in defenses against activity hijacking in Android versions higher than 5.0.\n\nThe overlay looks like what a user would expect to see after launching a legitimate banking\napp, but that app is actually running underneath the overlay. The user then inputs their\nauthentication credentials, which are sent to the attackers.\n\nSince GM Bot has full control over the device, it can also steal SMSes, such as one-time\nauthentication codes.\n\n\n-----\n\nPrevious mobile malware — before overlays became commercially available to fraudsters\n— could steal SMS codes, but those would have been meaningless without phishing\nschemes or a trojan on the victim’s PC to steal access credentials,” Kessem wrote.\n\nSince the leak of GM Bot’s code, it appears its creators have developed a second version\n“which is sold in financial fraud-themed underground boards,” Kessem wrote.\n\n_Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small_\n_commission.
