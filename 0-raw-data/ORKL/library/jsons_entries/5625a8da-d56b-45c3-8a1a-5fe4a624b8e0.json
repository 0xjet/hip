See the_ _[ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all referenced threat](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)_\n_actor techniques._\n\n**_Note: on October 20, 2020, the National Security Agency (NSA) released a cybersecurity_**\n_advisory providing information on publicly known vulnerabilities exploited by Chinese state-_\n_sponsored cyber actors to target computer networks holding sensitive intellectual property,_\n_economic, political, and military information. This Alert has been updated to include_\n_information on vulnerabilities exploited by Chinese state-sponsored actors (see Table 4)._\n\nIn light of heightened tensions between the United States and China, the Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is providing specific Chinese government and affiliated\ncyber threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and recommended mitigations\nto the cybersecurity community to assist in the protection of our Nation’s critical\ninfrastructure. In addition to the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this\nAlert, CISA recommends organizations take the following actions.\n\n1. Adopt a state of heightened awareness. Minimize gaps in personnel availability,\n\nconsistently consume relevant threat intelligence, and update emergency call trees.\n2. Increase organizational vigilance. Ensure security personnel monitor key internal\n\nsecurity capabilities and can identify anomalous behavior. Flag any known Chinese\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) and TTPs for immediate response.\n3. Confirm reporting processes. Ensure personnel know how and when to report an\n\nincident. The well-being of an organization’s workforce and cyber infrastructure\n[depends on awareness of threat activity. Consider reporting incidents to CISA to help](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report)\nserve as part of CISA’s early warning system (see the Contact Information section\nbelow).\n4. Exercise organizational incident response plans. Ensure personnel are familiar with\n\nthe key steps they need to take during an incident. Do they have the accesses they\nneed? Do they know the processes? Are various data sources logging as expected?\nEnsure personnel are positioned to act in a calm and unified manner.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**China Cyber Threat Profile**\n\n\n-----\n\nChina has a history of using national military and economic resources to leverage offensive\ncyber tactics in pursuing its national interests. The “Made in China 2025” 10-year plan\n[outlines China’s top-level policy priorities.[1],[2] China may seek to target the following](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FINAL-China-Technology-Report-6.18.18-PDF.pdf)\nindustries deemed critical to U.S. national and economic interests: new energy vehicles, next\ngeneration information technology (IT), biotechnology, new materials, aerospace, maritime\nengineering and high-tech ships, railway, robotics, power equipment, and agricultural\n[machinery.[3] China has exercised its increasingly sophisticated capabilities to illegitimately](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/made-china-2025-threat-global-trade)\nobtain U.S. intellectual property (IP), suppress both social and political perspectives deemed\ndangerous to China, and harm regional and international opponents.\n\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community and various private sector threat intelligence organizations\nhave identified the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Ministry of State Security\n(MSS) as driving forces behind Chinese state-sponsored cyberattacks–either through\ncontractors in the Chinese private sector or by the PLA and MSS entities themselves. China\ncontinues to engage in espionage-related activities that include theft of sensitive information\nsuch as innovation capital, IP, and personally identifiable information (PII). China has\ndemonstrated a willingness to push the boundaries of their activities to secure information\ncritical to advancing their economic prowess and competitive advantage.\n\n**Chinese Cyber Activity**\n\nAccording to open-source reporting, offensive cyber operations attributed to the Chinese\ngovernment targeted, and continue to target, a variety of industries and organizations in the\nUnited States, including healthcare, financial services, defense industrial base, energy,\ngovernment facilities, chemical, critical manufacturing (including automotive and aerospace),\ncommunications, IT, international trade, education, videogaming, faith-based organizations,\nand law firms.\n\nAdditionally, numerous Department of Justice (DOJ) indictments over several years provide\nevidence to suggest Chinese threat actors continuously seek to illegally obtain and exfiltrate\nU.S. IP. Their targets also include western companies with operations inside China.\n\nPublic reporting that associates Chinese actors with a range of high-profile attacks and\noffensive cyber activity includes:\n\n**February 2013 – Cyber Threat Intelligence Researchers Link Advanced Persistent**\n**Threat (APT) 1 to China: a comprehensive report publicly exposed APT1 as part of**\nChina’s military cyber operations and a multi-year effort that exfiltrated IP from roughly\n[141 companies spanning 20 major industries.[4] APT1 established access to the](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf)\nvictims’ networks and methodically exfiltrated IP across a large range of industries\nidentified in China’s 12th 5-Year Plan. A year later, the DOJ indicted Chinese cyber\nthreat actors assigned to PLA Unit 61398 for the first time (also highlighted in the\n[report).[5]](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor)\n\n\n-----\n\n**April 2017 – Chinese APTs Targeting IP in 12 Countries: CISA announced Chinese**\nstate-backed APTs carried out a multi-year campaign of cyber-enabled IP theft that\ntargeted global technology service providers and their customers. The threat actors\nleveraged stolen administrative credentials (local and domain) and placed\nsophisticated malware on critical systems in an effort to steal the IP and sensitive data\n[of companies located in at least 12 countries.[6]](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A)\n**December 2018 – Chinese Cyber Threat Actors Indicted for Compromising**\n**Managed Service Providers (MSPs): DOJ indicted two Chinese cyber threat actors**\nbelieved to be associated with APT10, who targeted MSPs and their large customer\nbase through phishing and spearphishing campaigns aimed at exfiltrating sensitive\n[business data and, possibly, PII.[7] CISA also briefed stakeholders on Chinese APT](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-rod-j-rosenstein-announces-charges-against-chinese-hackers)\ngroups who targeted MSPs and their customers to steal data and further operationalize\n[commercial and economic espionage.[8]](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Chinese-Cyber-Activity-Targeting-Managed-Service-Providers.pdf)\n**February 2020 – China’s Military Indicted for 2017 Equifax Hack: DOJ indicted**\nmembers of China’s PLA for stealing large amounts of PII and IP. The Chinese cyber\nthreat actors exploited a vulnerability in the company’s dispute resolution website to\nenter the network, conduct reconnaissance, upload malware, and steal credentials to\nextract the targeted data. The breach impacted roughly half of all American citizens\n[and stole Equifax’s trade secrets.[9]](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-announces-indictment-four-members-china-s-military)\n**May 2020 – China Targets COVID-19 Research Organizations: the Federal Bureau**\nof Investigation (FBI) and CISA reported the targeting and compromise of U.S.\norganizations conducting COVID-19-related research by cyber actors affiliated with\n[China.[10] Large-scale password spraying campaigns were a commonly observed](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/05/13/fbi-and-cisa-warn-against-chinese-targeting-covid-19-research-organizations)\ntactic in illicitly obtaining IP related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks\n[and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research.[11],[12]](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/AA20126A)\n\n**Common TTPs of Publicly Known Chinese Threat Actors**\n\nThe section below provides common, publicly known, TTPs employed by Chinese threat\nactors, which map to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Where possible, the tables include\nactions for detection and mitigation. This section is not exhaustive and does not detail all\nTTPs or detection and mitigation actions.\n\n**PRE-ATT&CK TTPs**\n\nChinese threat actors commonly use the techniques listed in table 1 to achieve\nreconnaissance (Technical Information Gathering [[TA0015]), staging (Stage Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0015/)\n\n[[TA0026]), and testing (Test Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0026/) [[TA0025]) before executing an attack. PRE-ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0025/)\ntechniques can be difficult to detect and mitigate, however, defenders should be aware of the\nuse of these techniques.\n\n_Table 1: Chinese threat actor PRE-ATT&CK techniques_\n\n**Technique** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Technique** **Description**\n\n\n_Acquire and/or Use 3rd_\n_Party Software Services_\n\n[[T1330]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1330/)\n\n_Compromise 3rd Party_\n_Infrastructure to Support_\n_Delivery_ [[T1334]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1334/)\n\n_Domain Registration_\n_Hijacking_ [[T1326]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1326/)\n\n_Acquire Open-Source_\n_Intelligence (OSINT)_\n_Data Sets and_\n_Information_ [[T1247]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1247/)\n\n_Conduct Active_\n_[Scanning [T1254]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1254/)_\n\n_Analyze Architecture and_\n_Configuration Posture_\n\n[[T1288]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1288/)\n\n_Upload, Install, and_\n_Configure_\n_Software/Tools_ [[T1362]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1362)\n\n**Enterprise ATT&CK TTPs**\n\n\nStaging and launching attacks from software as a service\nsolutions that cannot be easily tied back to the APT\n\nCompromising infrastructure owned by other parties to\nfacilitate attacks (instead of directly purchasing infrastructure)\n\nChanging the registration of a domain name without the\npermission of its original registrant and then using the\nlegitimate domain as a launch point for malicious purposes\n\nGathering data and information from publicly available sources,\nincluding public-facing websites of the target organization\n\nGathering information on target systems by scanning the\nsystems for vulnerabilities.

APT Activity**\n\nThe TTPs listed above have been repeatedly used across the spectrum of Chinese threat\nactors. The mitigations referenced in this alert can help reduce vulnerability to these TTPs;\nhowever, defenders should also maintain heightened awareness of threats actors that are\nmore innovative in their approach, making it difficult to detect and respond to compromise.\n[Publicly reported examples[13] include:](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html)\n\n**APT3 (known as UPS Team) is known for deploying zero-day attacks that target**\nInternet Explorer, Firefox, and Adobe Flash Player. The group’s custom implants and\nchanging Command and Control (C2) infrastructure make them difficult to track. APT3\nexploits use Rivest Cypher 4 (RC4) encryption to communicate and bypass address\nspace layout randomization (ASLR)/Data Execution Prevention (DEP) by using Return\n[Oriented Programming (ROP) chains.[14]](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022/)\n**APT10 (known as MenuPass Group) has established accessed to victim networks**\nthrough compromised service providers, making it difficult for network defenders to\nidentify the malicious traffic.\n**APT19 (known as Codoso and Deep Panda) is known for developing custom Rich Text**\nFormat (RTF) and macro-enabled Microsoft Office documents for both implants and\npayloads. The group has backdoored software, such as software serial generators, and\nhas an elite use of PowerShell for C2 over Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/Hyper\n[Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).[15]](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0073/)\n**APT40 (known as Leviathan) has targeted external infrastructure with success,**\nincluding internet-facing routers and virtual private networks.\n**APT41 (known as Double Dragon) has exploited vulnerabilities in Citrix**\nNetScaler/ADC, Cisco routers, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central to\n[compromise victims.[16]](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096/)\n\n## Mitigations\n\n Recommended Actions\n\nThe following list provides actionable technical recommendations for IT security\nprofessionals to reduce their organization’s overall vulnerability. These recommendations are\nnot exhaustive; rather they focus on the actions that will greatly reduce stakeholders’ attack\nsurface.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Patch systems and equipment promptly and diligently. Establishing and\n\nconsistently maintaining a thorough patching cycle continues to be the best defense\nagainst adversary TTPs. Focus on patching critical and high vulnerabilities that allow\nfor remote code execution or denial-of-service on externally-facing (i.e., internet)\nequipment. Certain vulnerabilities—including CVE-2012-0158 in Microsoft products\n\n[[17], CVE-2019-19781 in Citrix devices [18], and CVE-2020-5902 in BIG-IP Traffic](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-133a%20)\n[Management User Interface [19]—have presented APTs with prime targets to gain](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/07/04/f5-releases-security-advisory-big-ip-tmui-rce-vulnerability-cve)\ninitial access. Chinese APTs often use existing exploit code to target routinely exploited\n[vulnerabilities [20], which present an opportunistic attack that requires limited](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-133a%20)\nresources.

Implement rigorous configuration management programs. Audit configuration\n\nmanagement programs to ensure they can track and mitigate emerging threats. Review\nsystem configurations for misconfigurations and security weaknesses. Implementing a\nrobust configuration and patch management program hinders sophisticated APT\noperations by limiting the effectiveness of opportunistic attacks.\n\n2. Disable unnecessary ports, protocols, and services. Review network security\n\ndevice logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary ports and protocols.\nMonitor common ports and protocols for C2 activity. Turn off or disable any\nunnecessary services or functionality within devices (e.g., universal plug and play\n\n[UPnP], PowerShell).\n\n3. Enhance monitoring of network and email traffic. Review network signatures and\n\nindicators for focused operations activities, monitor for new phishing themes, and\nadjust email rules accordingly. Follow best practices of restricting attachments via\nemail. Ensure that log information is aggregated and correlated to enable maximum\ndetection capabilities, with a focus on monitoring for account misuse.\n\n4. Use protection capabilities to stop malicious activity. Implement antivirus software\n\nand other endpoint protection capabilities to automatically detect and prevent malicious\nfiles from executing. Use network intrusion detection and prevention systems to identify\nand prevent commonly employed adversarial malware and limit nefarious data\ntransfers.\n\n## Contact Information\n\nCISA encourages recipients of this report to contribute any additional information that they\nmay have related to this threat.
