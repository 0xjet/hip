The two advanced persistent threat (APT)\ngroups attributed to these organizations coexisted inside the DNC's networks for months and\nprovided valuable political intelligence to the Russian government, in the form of stolen files\nand emails, during the run-up to US presidential election. This audacious act of cyber[espionage brought these two APT groups, also known as FancyBear and](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/sofacy) [CozyBear (coined](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/apt_29)\nby CrowdStrike), into the spotlight and under the microscope ever since.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and these two well-known APT groups\n(among many others) have been busy launching widespread intelligence gathering intrusion\ncampaigns to support the Russian government and Russian military. This blog aims to\nleverage open source intelligence (OSINT) reports to highlight the recent publicly-known\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) leveraged by these cyber adversaries in 1H 2022\nand the significance of them. For many top enterprises, government organizations, and\npolitical entities, these hacking groups operating on behalf of the Russian GRU and SVR are\npriority threats whose capabilities is of the utmost concern.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Timeline of reports on FancyBear and CozyBear activities_\n\n**Russian GRU Unit 26165 (aka APT28, FancyBear, Strontium, Sofacy) activities in 1H**\n**2022**\n\nOn 14 January, @billyleonard from the Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) [reported](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8860294626556920790/8906270951556492055#)\nthat FancyBear was behind an ongoing credential phishing campaign focused on\nUkraine. The group leveraged *.eu3[.]biz, *.eu3[.]org, and blogspot[.]com hostnames\nas part of its phishing infrastructure.\nOn 7 March, Google TAG [disclosed that FancyBear conducted several large credential](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8860294626556920790/8906270951556492055#)\nphishing campaigns targeting ukr[.]net users (UkrNet is a Ukrainian media company).\nThis campaign included malicious links to blogspot[.]com sites that redirected\nto credential harvesting pages hosted on *.frge[.]io. These phishing links were also\nsent from email accounts that had been compromised prior by the APT group.\nOn 16 March, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) issued\nan alert that further highlighted how UAC-0028 (CERT-UA's name for FancyBear) was\nphishing UkrNet accounts, but this time the APT group used the tinyurl[.]com URLshortening service embedded inside a QR code the would lead to UkrNet credential\nhavresting sites with *.frge[.]io and *.m.pipedream[.]net hostnames.\nOn 7 April, the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and the Microsoft Digital\n[Crimes Unit obtained a court order authorizing it to take control of seven internet](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/04/07/cyberattacks-ukraine-strontium-russia/)\n[domains Strontium (Microsoft's name for FancyBear) used to conduct phishing attacks](https://twitter.com/dacuddy/status/1512193359602888725)\nagainst Ukrainian media organizations, as well as government institutions and think\ntanks in the US and the EU involved in foreign policy.\n[On 27 April, Microsoft's Special Report on Ukraine revealed additional details on](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Vwwd)\nStrontium's campaigns:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn August 2021, Microsoft recorded Strontium targeting defense-related\norganizations in Ukraine.\nOn 4 March, Microsoft specifically noted that the network of the government\nof Vinnytsia (a city in west-central Ukraine) was also compromised by Strontium\nand that sought access via phishing to other Ukrainian military personnel and\nregional Ukrainian government employee accounts.\nIn April, Microsoft observed Strontium and other suspected Russian nation state\nthreat actors launch campaigns against or expand on existing access in the\ncommunications sector, targeting the IT infrastructure that supports the sector,\nand a major internet service provider (ISP).\n[On 3 May, Google TAG provided an update on cyber activity in Eastern Europe.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-on-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe/)\nFancyBear was observed targeting users in Ukraine with a new variant of infostealer\nmalware distributed via email attachments. The new FancyBear malware is a .NET\nexecutable that when ran by the victim steals cookies and saved passwords from\nChrome, Edge and Firefox browsers. The data is then exfiltrated via email to a\ncompromised email account.\nOn 6 May, CERT-UA [issued an alert that UAC-0028 sent malicious emails posing as](https://cert.gov.ua/article/40102)\nCERT-UA and contained an attachment in the form of a password-protected RAR\narchive \"UkrScanner.rar\". Inside the RAR file was a Self-Extracting Archive (SFX) of\nthe same name, which, in turn, contains a malware dubbed CredoMap. Data collected\nby the malware was exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to *.m.pipedream[.]net\nhostnames.\n[On 20 June, CERT-UA warned of another UAC-0082 attack, this time pushing](https://cert.gov.ua/article/341128)\na malicious document called \"Nuclear Terrorism A Very Real Threat.rtf\" via email. If\nopened, the document will download an HTML file with embedded JavaScript code\n[from a *.frge[.]io hostname that exploits CVE-2022-30190, a remote code execution](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/05/30/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/)\n[(RCE) bug in the Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) (aka the \"Follina\"](https://doublepulsar.com/follina-a-microsoft-office-code-execution-vulnerability-1a47fce5629e?gi=a71dbe8951c6)\nexploit). If executed successfully by the victim, the exploit chain downloads the\nCredoMap malware. The same incident was also analysed by Malwarebytes Threat\nIntel (see [here) and Team Cymru (see here).](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2022/06/russias-apt28-uses-fear-of-nuclear-war-to-spread-follina-docs-in-ukraine/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Summary of FancyBear campaign attributes in 1H 2022_\n\n**Russian SVR (aka APT29, CozyBear, Nobelium, DarkHalo, TheDukes) activities in 1H**\n**2022**\n\n[On 27 January, CrowdStrike published a comprehensive report on the 'StellarParticle](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/observations-from-the-stellarparticle-campaign/)\nCampaign' associated with CozyBear. The report highlighted the novel tactics and\ntechniques leveraged by the Russian SVR hacking group throughout 2021. This\nincluded details from the SolarWinds supply chain attack, Browser cookie theft, and\nMicrosoft Service Principal manipulation.\n[On 18 February, the Shadow Chaser Group Tweeted a suspected sample of APT29](https://twitter.com/shadowchasing1/status/1494470323063779353?s=21)\n[malware known as EnvyScout. The attackers leveraged the HTML smuggling](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/11/html-smuggling-surges-highly-evasive-loader-technique-increasingly-used-in-banking-malware-targeted-attacks/)\ntechnique to deliver an ISO file that, if executed, runs a DLL on the victim's device. This\nincident used a COVID-19 theme and reportedly was aimed at the Embassy of the\nRepublic of Turkey.\n[On 4 March, the Telsy Threat Intelligence team disclosed several suspected spear-](https://www.telsy.com/legitimate-sites-used-as-cobalt-strike-c2s-against-indian-government/#page)\nphishing attempts against Indian government entities. The phishing attempts were\ntentatively attributed to Nobelium/APT29 due to the mutual use of a Cobalt Strike\nwatermark (\"1359593325\") and an infection chain that matches reports by Microsoft\nand Volexity on Nobelium/APT29 campaigns.\n[On 18 April, InQuest Labs discovered a malicious file belonging to Nobelium called](https://inquest.net/blog/2022/04/18/nobelium-israeli-embassy-maldoc)\n\"Ambassador_Absense.docx.\" posing as an official document from the Israeli Embassy\nin London. Opening the document downloads a HTML Application (.HTA) file with\nembedded JavaScript that decrypts and executes the payload. Once launched, the\nmalicious payload collects data about the local system and exfiltrates it to a remote\nserver using api[.]trello[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n[On 27 April, Microsoft s Special Report on Ukraine revealed additional details on](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Vwwd)\nNobelium's campaigns:\n\nIn early 2021, Microsoft observed Nobelium launching a large-scale phishing\ncampaign against Ukrainian interests involved in rallying international support\nagainst Russian actions\nBy mid-2021, Nobelium attempted to access IT firms serving government\ncustomers in predominantly NATO member states, at times successfully\ncompromising then leveraging privileged accounts to breach and steal data from\nWestern foreign policy organizations.\nAs 2021 progressed, the Nobelium group, alongside several other suspected\nRussian nation state threat actors, sought persistent access to their particular\ninterests among a total target pool that included Ukrainian defense, defense\nindustrial base, foreign policy, national and local administration, law enforcement,\nand humanitarian organizations.\n[Also on 27 April, Mandiant released a blog stating that it had gathered sufficient](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc2452-merged-into-apt29)\nevidence to assess that the activity previously tracked as UNC2452, the threat group\nresponsible for the SolarWinds compromise in December 2020, is attributable to\nAPT29.\n[On 28 April, Mandiant published a report on tracking APT29 phishing](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/tracking-apt29-phishing-campaigns)\ncampaigns targeting diplomatic organizations in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. It\nincluded the disclosure of two new APT29 malware families uncovered in 2022,\ndubbed BEATDROP and BOOMMIC, and details about APT29’s efforts to evade\ndetection through retooling and abuse of Atlassian's Trello API\nservice: api[.]trello[.]com.\n[On 2 May, Mandiant also disclosed a new campaign tracked as UNC3524 that has](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc3524-eye-spy-email)\nreportedly been active since December 2019. UNC3524 campaigns facilitate bulk email\ncollection from victim environments, especially as it relates to their support of\nsuspected espionage objectives. Notably, this threat actor leveraged a Dropbear-based\nbackdoor, dubbed QUIETEXIT, on embedded network devices (such as VPN\nappliances) to access MS Office 365 or on-premises MS Exchange emails. Another\ninteresting tactic is that UNC3524 usually accessed its victim's system from other\ncompromised devices, usually outdated and unpatched LifeSize conference IoT\n[cameras. Mandiant analysts tentatively attributed this campaign to APT29. However,](https://twitter.com/tylabs/status/1521164434344976388)\nthe technical overlaps included TTPs that had already been made public and there\nwere also some aspects aligned to APT28, which could suggest the two groups share\nsome tooling.\n[On 5 May, the Shadow Chaser Group Tweeted a suspected sample of APT29 malware](https://twitter.com/ShadowChasing1/status/1522180445789573124)\nthat leveraged DLL side-loading as a method of executing their payload by invoking a\nlegitimate Adobe application to execute their payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n[On 13 May, Cluster25 published a report analyzing several CozyBear spear-phishing](https://cluster25.io/2022/05/13/cozy-smuggled-into-the-box/)\ncampaigns involving the above mentioned use of a side-loaded DLL through signed\nsoftware (like Adobe suite) alongside the use of the legitimate Dropbox service\n**api[.]dropbox[.]com as communication vector. The Cluster25 researchers also stated**\nthat this CozyBear campaign potentially impacted at least Greece, Italy, Turkey, and\nPortugal especially in the government and foreign affairs sectors.\n[On 9 June, the Shadow Chaser Group Tweeted another suspect sample of APT29](https://twitter.com/ShadowChasing1/status/1534714528919072768)\nmalware that also leveraged DLL side-loading as a method of executing their payload\nby invoking a legitimate Hewlett Packard application to execute their payload.\nOn 22 June, Microsoft [released another report on 'Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE50KOK)\nfrom the Cyber War' and included additional details about some of the SVR's\ncampaigns. The Nobelium group has continued to target Ukrainian and NATO member\nstates diplomatic entities with password spraying and spear-phishing attacks. Microsoft\nalso reported that the SVR's influence operations include historical revisionism and the\ntargeting of think tanks and academics.\n\n_Figure 3.
