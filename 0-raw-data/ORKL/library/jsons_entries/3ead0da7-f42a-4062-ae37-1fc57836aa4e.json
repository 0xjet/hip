Most recent Russian cyber attack campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Ongoing updates on Russian cyber attack: SolarWinds/SUNBURST\n\n3. What does the Russian cyber attack threatscape look like by threat actor?\n\n## Most recent Russian cyber attack campaigns\n\n### APT29 Campaign Targeting European Diplomats with COVID-19 Lures\n\n[TLDR: ESET released a report [PDF] in early February stating that in October and November](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/eset_threat_report_t32021.pdf)\n2021, APT29 launched a spear-phishing campaign targeting European diplomatic missions\nand Ministries of Foreign Affairs.\n\nMore information: In the spearphishing emails, the APT29 threat actors impersonated the\nIranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and stated the Iranian embassy will be closed because of\nCOVID-19. The goal was to target the diplomatic missions of EU countries and a Cobalt\nStrike Beacon on compromised systems.\n\n### Ukraine DDoS attacks\n\nTLDR: On February 15, 2022, Ukraine’s Center for Strategic Communications and\nInformation Security [reported that the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine](https://www.cyberscoop.com/ukraine-banks-defense-ministry-ddos/)\nand two of the country's state-owned banks, Privatbank (Ukraine's largest bank) and\nOschadbank (the State Savings Bank), were hit by a “powerful DDoS attack on a number of\ninformation resources.”\n\n[More information: The DDoS attacks consisted of three times more traffic than typically](https://threatpost.com/ukrainian-ddos-attacks-should-put-us-on-notice-researchers/178498/)\nobserved, 99% of which were HTTPs requests. The DDoS attacks caused interruptions in the\nsites of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces, and made bank customers\nunable to login to their online banking accounts. Privatbank's web application firewall (WAF)\n[was also updated with a traffic geofencing rule, which automatically removed the site's](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukrainian-military-agencies-state-owned-banks-hit-by-ddos-attacks/)\ncontents for IP addresses outside of Ukraine and displayed a message reading: \"BUSTED!\nPRIVATBANK WAF is watching you.”\n\n[U.S. and U.K. governments recently linked the DDoS attacks to Russia’s Main Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/128174/hacking/russia-gru-ddos-ukraine.html)\nDirectorate, the GRU. They were able to attribute the attacks because GRU infrastructure\nwas observed transmitting high volumes of communications to IP addresses and domains\nbased in Ukraine. Luckily, the direct impact of these attacks are low. Though the availability\nof the data was temporarily compromised, the victims were able to quickly restore access\nwithin a few hours and no information was stolen or altered.\n\n### Russian Threat Actors Targeting U.S. Defense Contractors\n\n\n-----\n\n[TLDR: CISA, the NSA, and the FBI released an alert on February 16th that states from at](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-047a)\nleast January 2020 through February 2022, Russian state-sponsored threat actors have\nregularly targeted U.S. cleared defense contractors (CDC) who support contracts for the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) and the wider U.S. Intelligence Community.\n\nMore information: Over this two year period, the threat actors use common tactics, like\nspear-phishing, password spraying, and vulnerability exploitation, to gain access to CDC\nnetworks. They were able to maintain persistent access to numerous CDCs, in some cases for\nover six months. While having access, the threat actors were observed regularly and\nrepeatedly exfiltrating emails and data, through which they acquired “unclassified CDCproprietary and export-controlled information.” This gave the Russian actors insight into\nU.S. weapons platforms development and deployment timelines, plans for communications\ninfrastructure, and military technologies, which can be used to inform Russian military and\nintelligence strategy.\n\n### APT29 Targeting of French Organizations\n\nThe French national cybersecurity agency ANSSI (Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des\n[Systèmes d’Information) revealed that APT29 has been targeting French organizations in a](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/125342/apt/nobelium-targets-french-orgs.html?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nobelium-targets-french-orgs)\nnumber of phishing campaigns since February 2021.\n\nThe Russian threat actors compromised the email accounts of French organizations and\nleveraged the access to carry out spear-phishing campaigns aimed at foreign institutions.\nFrench government entities were also targeted by phishing emails sent from servers\nbelonging to foreign entities, which were likely compromised by the same threat actor.\nAPT29 used the spear-phishing emails to deliver a Cobalt Strike implant, and the\ninfrastructure used in the attacks against French organizations was largely created using\nvirtual private servers (VPS) from various providers.\n\n### Geopolitical\n\n[In early December, President Biden and President Putin held a virtual meeting to](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/7/putin-biden-hold-two-hours-of-talks-amid-ukraine-tensions)\ndiscuss ways to defuse the growing military crisis along Ukraine’s borders.\n\nBiden offered Putin the choice between a diplomatic solution and the severe\neconomic and political consequences that would follow a Russian invasion of\nUkraine, but there was no word of whether Putin had made any commitments.\n\n[Twitter removes a network of 16 accounts linked to the IRA that attempted to introduce](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/disclosing-state-linked-information-operations-we-ve-removed)\na pro-Russia viewpoint into Central African political discourse.\n\nTwitter also removes a network of 50 accounts that attacked the civilian Libyan\ngovernment and actors that support it, while voicing significant support for\nRussia’s geopolitical position in Libya and Syria.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In early December, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with President Putin to](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/6/india-hosts-putin-as-it-balances-ties-with-russia-us)\ndiscuss defense and trade relations as India has drawn closer to the U.S.\n\nRussia and India also signed a slew of bilateral defense agreements, including\nIndia’s procurement of more than 600,000 assault rifles from Russia.\n\n[In mid-December, Russia published draft security pacts, demanding that NATO deny](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/17/russia-demands-ukraine-ex-soviet-nations-barred-from-nato)\nmembership to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet countries and roll back the deployment of\ntroops and weapons in central and eastern Europe.\n\nThe documents also call for a ban on sending US and Russian warships and\naircraft to areas from where they can attack each other’s territory as well as a halt\nto NATO military drills near Russia’s borders.\n\n[In mid-December, President Putin and President Xi meet in a virtual summit, in which](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-says-xi-backs-putin-push-western-security-guarantees-2021-12-15/)\nthe two show solidarity in the face of contentions with the West.\n\nPutin states a new model of cooperation has been formed between the countries,\nbased, among other things, on such principles as non-interference in internal\naffairs and respect for each other's interests\n\n[In late December, it is reported that U.S. and Russian officials will hold security talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-russian-officials-set-security-talks-jan-10-us-official-2021-12-28/)\non Jan. 10 to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and confront\nrising tensions over Ukraine\n\n### Renewed cyber attack on German parliament\n\nA spokesperson for the foreign ministry in Berlin stated Russia is responsible for a renewed\ncyber attack on the German parliament. According to the EU, the attacks targeted \"numerous\nmembers of Parliaments, government officials, etc. in the EU by accessing computer systems\nand personal accounts and stealing data.\" Germany’s intelligence service warned in July that\nthere had been “intensive attacks” by the Ghostwriter group since February, speculating that\nit could be preparing for “hack and leak” operations in which information is stolen to be\npublished later on, either in its original form or doctored.\n\n### TinyTurla backdoor\n\n[TinyTurla is a “previously undiscovered” backdoor from the Turla APT group that has been](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/tinyturla.html)\nused since at least 2020. This backdoor slips past malware detection systems because it's so\nsimple. In other words, the backdoor code is extremely simple, but is efficient enough that\nit’ll usually fly under the radar. TinyTurla was found to have been targeting the previous\nAfghan government as well as deployed on systems in the US and Germany. Researchers\nwere able to spot the backdoor and attribute it to Turla because the group used the same\ninfrastructure that it has used in previous attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nTinyTurla is used as a second-chance backdoor to maintain access to the system, even if the\nprimary malware is removed. It could also be used as a second-stage dropper to infect the\nsystem with additional malware. The threat actors tried to operate under the radar by\ninstalling the backdoor as a service and naming it \"Windows Time Service.\" Sporting the\nability to upload and execute files or exfiltrate files from the infected system, the backdoor\ncontacted the C2 server via an HTTPS encrypted channel every 5 seconds to check if there\nwere new commands from the operator.\n\nTurla is pretty well-known and closely monitored by the security industry, but despite all\nthis, they managed to use this backdoor for almost two years. This can serve as an argument\nfor the need for network/behavior-based detection, such as IronNet’s IronDefense, which\nwould have detected the consistent beaconing used in this attack.\n\n### FoggyWeb Backdoor\n\n[Microsoft discovered a new piece of malware from APT29 - a post-exploitation backdoor](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/27/foggyweb-targeted-nobelium-malware-leads-to-persistent-backdoor/)\ncalled FoggyWeb. Observed in the wild as early as April 2021, this backdoor is passive, highly\ntargeted, and capable of remotely exfiltrating sensitive information from a compromised AD\nFS server. It can also receive additional commands from a C2 server and execute them on the\ncompromised server.\n\n[APT29 uses FoggyWeb to remotely exfiltrate the configuration database of compromised AD](https://threatpost.com/solarwinds-active-directory-servers-foggyweb-backdoor/175056/)\nFS servers, and the backdoor configures HTTP listeners for actor-defined URIs that mimic\nthe structure of the legitimate URIs that the target’s AD FS deployment uses. The custom\nlisteners passively monitor all incoming HTTP GET and POST requests sent to the AD FS\nserver from the internet and intercept HTTP requests that match the custom URI patterns\ndefined by the actor. Microsoft has notified all customers observed being targeted or\ncompromised by FoggyWeb, as well as has recommended some mitigation tactics.\n\n### REvil ransomware gang strikes again\n\n[As mentioned in our analysis of the REvil shutdown, in July 2, 2021, the IT management](https://www.ironnet.com/blog/russias-ransomware-and-revil-shutdown?hs_preview=jHJLuvnQ-51676300723)\nsoftware developer Kaseya Ltd. learned its VSA (Virtual System Administrator) was victim of\none of the largest ransomware attacks in history. The Kaseya VSA is a common remote\nmonitoring and management software used by MSPs (Managed Service Providers) to manage\ntheir clients’ systems. Though Kaseya stated that fewer than 60 of its customers were directly\nbreached, many of Kaseya’s customers provide IT services to other businesses, leading to an\nestimated 800 and 1,500 downstream companies across the world being impacted.\n\nThis supply chain ransomware attack was carried out by the REvil ransomware gang, which\nclaimed to have encrypted more than one million systems and demanded $50 million in\nransom for a universal decryptor. REvil is an infamous Russia-based cybercrime syndicate\nresponsible for several recent notable attack campaigns, including the recent ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\n[attacks against Quanta Computer, Sol Oriens, Acer, and JBS. Operating under a](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-gang-tries-to-extort-apple-threatens-to-sell-stolen-blueprints/)\n[ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, REvil ranks first among most common ransomware](https://www.coveware.com/blog/ransomware-attack-vectors-shift-as-new-software-vulnerability-exploits-abound)\nvariants with 14.2% of the total market share.\n\n### Influence campaign against the Polish government\n\n[In June 2021, the Polish government attributed a recent wave of cyberattacks to Russian](https://apnews.com/article/europe-russia-intelligence-agencies-technology-government-and-politics-261df587ec9f93e781be8203a083eea1)\nSecret Services in which over 100 email and social media accounts of some of the most\nimportant Polish government officials from various political parties were targeted. Officials\nsay this was part of a larger campaign that targeted over 4,350 accounts of various Polish\npublic figures and citizens. The Russian hackers leaked emails and documents (some of\nwhich were reportedly altered) from the email inbox of Michał Dworczyk, the head of the\nChancellery of the Polish Prime Minister’s. Polish officials said the goal of this campaign was\nto “hit Polish society and destabilize [the] country.“ These attacks have been attributed to\n[Russian UNC1151, which is connected to the wider Ghostwriter influence campaign, designed](https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/us-cybersecurity-firm-confirms-poland-as-subject-of-ghostwriter-op-22761)\nwith the goal of destabilizing politics in Central Europe.\n\n### APT 28 / GRU Brute Force Attacks\n\n[In July 2021, the NSA, FBI, and CISA released a cybersecurity advisory [PDF] stating that](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jul/01/2002753896/-1/-1/1/CSA_GRU_GLOBAL_BRUTE_FORCE_CAMPAIGN_UOO158036-21.PDF)\nsince at least mid-2019 through early 2021, the GRU (aka APT28 or Fancy Bear) has carried\nout widespread, distributed, and anonymized brute force access attempts against hundreds\nof government and private sector targets in the US and worldwide. In this ongoing campaign,\nAPT28 utilizes a Kubernetes cluster to conduct anonymized brute force access attempts\nrouted through TOR and commercial VPN services. This brute force capability allows the\nactors to access protected data - including emails - and acquire account credentials, which\ncan be used for many purposes, like gaining initial access, establishing persistence, escalating\nprivileges, and evading defenses.\n\n### IronNet analysis of NOBELIUM activity\n\n[Microsoft has reported in a blog post that the same group behind the SolarWinds attack,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/05/27/nobelium-cyberattack-nativezone-solarwinds/)\nrevealed in December 2020, NOBELIUM, has struck again in the U.S., targeting\nabout 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different organizations.\n\nIronNet analysis:\n\nThe exploitation of a U.S. government email supplier by a Russian intelligence agency,\nallowing the agency to masquerade as a legitimate U.S. agency, appears to represent an\nimportant shift in Russian behavior.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the tactic of using phishing emails to obtain access and install malware on\ncomputers is hardly unique, the decision by the Russian SVR to represent itself as a\nlegitimate U.S. government agency by exploiting an actual provider of services to the\ngovernment demonstrates that Russia remains undeterred when it comes to going after\nthe United States.\nThis hack, which [Microsoft reports is being conducted by the same players as the](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/05/27/nobelium-cyberattack-nativezone-solarwinds/)\nmassive [SolarWinds hack on U.S. government systems discussed over the past few](https://www.ironnet.com/blog/analysis-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack)\nmonths, could provide the Russians with sustained access to (and intelligence on) all\nsorts of third parties that the U.S. government works with through the U.S. Agency for\nInternational Development.\nThis hack once again highlights how the exploitation of an organization in a company\nor government agency’s supply chain entity can create risk not only for the company or\nagency itself but for its customers and partners as well.\nThe hack therefore should also focus our attention on the importance — as highlighted\nin the Biden Administration’s recent Executive Order — of organizations and their\nsuppliers working closely together to share cyber threats information and collaborate in\nreal-time on threats to provide for cyber collective defense of a supply chain.\n\nAdditional updates:\n\nLate-state SolarWinds / SUNBURST activity by actor dubbed NOBELIUM by the\n[Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/)\n[February 2021 exposure of new Sandworm APT attacks targeting IT companies using](https://www.zdnet.com/article/france-russian-state-hackers-targeted-centreon-servers-in-years-long-campaign/)\nCentreon.\nRussian-Linked threat group “Gamaredon” conducts supply chain malware attacks\n[against Ukraine.](https://www.securityweek.com/gamaredon-group-uses-custom-malware-ukraine-attacks)\n\nDespite lacking the national wealth and technological prowess of their Western rivals, the\nRussian intelligence services have proven to be one of the shrewdest, most effective — and\n_potentially most dangerous — threat actors in cyberspace. Indeed, as the latest on the_\n[SolarWinds hack suggests, Russian cyber attacks are a real and present threat. This summary](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-solarwinds-cyberattack-the-hack-the-victims-and-what-we-know/)\nis very helpful for navigating the whirlwind of news surrounding the\nSolarWinds/SUNBURST attack.\n\n### Late-stage SolarWinds / SUNBURST activity\n\nThree new pieces of malware being used in late-stage activity have been identified, with\nactivity seen as early as June 2020. These are tailor-made for specific networks introduced\nafter the actor has gained access. The threat actor has been observed using stolen creds to\n[access cloud services like email and storage, as well as, VPNs and remote access tools. The](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/)\n[Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has named the actor behind the attacks against](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/)\nSolarWinds, the SUNBURST backdoor, TEARDROP malware, and related components as\nNOBELIUM.\n\n\n-----\n\nGoldMax\n\nThis malware was discovered persisting on networks as a scheduled task impersonating\nsystems management software. The scheduled task was named after the software and\npointed to a subfolder in ProgramData named after that software with a similar executable\nname.\n\nMalware is written in Go and acts as a C2 backdoor\nThe C2 domains are high-reputation and are acquired from domain resellers or\npreviously compromised domains. This tactic is used for OPSEC purposes because the\npurchased domains maintain their original creation date.\n\nSibot\n\nThis dual-purpose malware was implemented in VBScript designed to achieve persistence on\nthe machine and then download and execute a payload from the C2 server. It reaches out to a\nlegitimate but compromised website and places itself in system32/drivers.\n\nGoldFinder\n\nThis malware acts as a custom HTTP tracer tool that logs the route that a packet traverses to\nreach the C2 server.\n\nThis malware was written in Go - used a a custom HTTP tracer tool that logs the route\nthat a packet traverses to reach the C2 server.\nWhen it attempts to reach the hardcoded C2 server, it will continue trying up to 99\ntimes or until the redirects stop and GoldFinder receives a 200 request - whichever\ncomes first.\n\n### SUNBURST tactics, techniques, and procedures\n\nThe threat actor used several sophisticated techniques to hide command and control traffic,\nsuch as mimicking SolarWinds’ Orion traffic and leveraging infrastructure providers to\nmasquerade as trusted geolocated environments.\n\nWhile one of the distinctive network behaviors associated with SUNBURST that has been\ndiscussed by the cybersecurity community is command and control (C2) using Domain\nGeneration Algorithm (DGA), it is our perspective at IronNet that this behavior more closely\naligns with DNS tunneling. In fact, our initial detections of the SUNBURST C2 domain in\nearly Summer 2020 were based upon our DNS tunneling analytic.\n\nMore than 18,000 SolarWinds customers downloaded the update that had the SUNBURST\nbackdoor and were exposed. The actor then chose a much smaller set of companies and\ngovernment agencies they wanted to exploit and downloaded a second set of tools and\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised those networks.\n\nYou can learn more about what we know, including analysis observations about SUNBURST\nTTPs from IronNet's SOC and threat researchers here.\n\n### Additional high-profile Russian cyber attack examples\n\nPrior to the SolarWinds/SUNBURST attack, Russian cyber attacks have included the\nfollowing:\n\nInterference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections: These operations illustrated the\nreach and power of cyber-enabled influence operations.\nDisruption of the Ukrainian power grid in 2015: Russian cyber actors are credited with\nthe first publicly identified attack on a live power grid, which impacted an estimated\n225,000 people.\n[Intrusions into the U.S. power grid: In 2018, the U.S. publicly accused Russia of](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions-energygrid/in-a-first-u-s-blames-russia-for-cyber-attacks-on-energy-grid-idUSKCN1GR2G3)\nconducting a two year long coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into the U.S. grid.\nTargeting of COVID-19 research: In July 2020, the U.S., U.K., and Canada [detailed](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development-V1-1.pdf)\nRussian-driven cyber intrusion campaigns directed against organizations conducting\nCOVID-19 vaccine development.\n\nWith these instances serving as precursors, there is now widespread concern (and mounting\nevidence) within the cybersecurity community that Russian hackers are actively developing\ndeep access into critical infrastructure networks around the globe for the purpose of\nexecuting disruptive or destructive physical attacks (should they be called upon to do so by\nregime leadership). In the case of the SolarWinds/SUNBURST attack, the gravity of this\nincident has yet to be determined.\n\nRussia also harbors a large proportion of the world’s active cyber criminals. Theft and fraud\nappear to be routinely ignored by the Russian authorities, provided the victims reside in\nthose nations the Kremlin considers its enemies. Putin’s regime offers little help in bringing\n[these criminals to justice, and may in fact be partnering with them, placing these criminal](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/evgeniy-mikhailovich-bogachev-the-growing-partnership-between-russia-government-and-cybercriminals-60-minutes/)\nactors beyond the reach of many Western law enforcement agencies.\n\nSome of the most notorious actors in the cyber threat landscape have been traced back to\nsponsorship by the Russian state. As the digital revolution has accelerated, so, too, has the\nRussian cyber attack landscape — hold-over Cold War tactics that evolved to take advantage\nof new electronic methods of communication.\n\nAcross cybersecurity communities, a deep dive into SUNBURST is ongoing and will yield\nadditional insights over time. In historical instances, though, strategic Russian interests are\nguided by Russia's desire to be recognized as a great power, to protect the Russian identity,\nand to limit global United States power. These themes are evident in components commonly\nassociated with Russian-backed cyber threat campaigns:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe weaponization of information through disinformation campaigns and propaganda\nAttempted interference in democratic processes\nStrategic positioning within critical infrastructure, perhaps as preparation for potential\nescalation of hostilities with rival nations.\n\n## What does the Russian cyber attack threatscape look like?\n\nTo summarize the threat at a more tactical level, we have scoured cybersecurity reporting in\norder to prepare an overview of cyber threat actors observed more recently, and to which\nevidence-based analysis has assigned the likelihood of Russian state-sponsorship as\nprobable. Each actor is presented with highlights of more notable campaign activity, with\nnotations on countries and sectors targeted, as well as a mention of behaviors or tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) utilized in order to enable actions on objectives.\nFootnotes provide links to further, more detailed, reading.\n\nWho are today’s major Russian adversary groups and what are the main tactics and\ntechniques of Russian cyber attack campaigns? Let’s take a closer look at some of these\nknown actors, listed here in order of threat scope and potential:\n\n## Ghostwriter\n\n[Ghostwriter represents yet another recently identified cyber influence operation likely tied to](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/blog/pdfs/Ghostwriter-Influence-Campaign.pdf)\nthe Russian intelligence apparatus. The campaign, which has been active from early 2017\nthrough at least May 2020, has focused on disseminating falsified narratives surrounding\nLithuania, Latvia, and Poland, and their relations with other NATO allies. The fake stories\nconsistently suggest tensions between the allies or wrongdoing by NATO troops stationed\nwithin the Baltic region.\n\n[In addition to the activity attributed to Ghostwriter, the Associated Press reported that](https://apnews.com/3acb089e6a333e051dbc4a465cb68ee1)\nRussian intelligence services were also using several English-language websites to spread\ndisinformation about the coronavirus pandemic and response in the United States, providing\nyet another example of concerted effort by the Russian intelligence services to influence\npublic opinion within the West.\n\nThe actors behind this campaign have successfully compromised legitimate websites\n(typically news sites) which they in turn use to post fabricated stories containing false or\ndivisive narratives surrounding the alliance NATO with a focus on Eastern Europe. Various\ncyber personas are then used to amplify and further disseminate the narratives by posting to\nblogs, sites allowing user-generated content, or social media. In April 2020, one such fake\n[letter was even posted to the official website of the Polish War Studies Academy.](https://www.gov.pl/web/sluzby-specjalne/atak-dezinformacyjny-na-polske)\n\nThe tactics and concepts observed during the Ghostwriter campaign are reminiscent of\n[Operation Secondary Infektion, an online influence operation uncovered in 2019.

The indictment also lists numerous intrusion\ncampaigns executed by these actors, to include the infamous NotPetya attacks, targeting of\nFrench politicians and government entities during the 2017 elections, and efforts to interfere\nin media and government networks in Georgia in 2018 and 2019.
