We’ve seen examples of**\n\n**this attack campaign, which we’ve named “MILE TEA” (MIcrass Logedrut Elirks TEA), appearing**\n\n**as early as 2011, and that it has since expanded the scope of targets. It involves multiple**\n\n**malware families and often tricks targets by sending purported flight e-tickets in email**\n\n**attachments. The identified targets include three separate Japanese trading companies, a**\n\n**Japanese petroleum company, a mobile phone organization based in Japan, the Beijing office of**\n\n**a public organization of Japan, and a government agency in Taiwan.**\n\n**Figure 1 shows the number of attacks considered as a part of the MILE TEA campaign since**\n\n**2011. As we can see, the volume of the threats is small in total.**\n\n**_Figure 1 Number of threats used in the attack campaign_**\n\n**In the first three years, most of the reported attacks were from Taiwan. saw infections in a few**\n\n**other countries in Asia, but the number was miniscule.

Since 2015, most of the reported attacks are from Japan.**\n\n**_Figure 2 Reports by countries_**\n\n**The primary infection vector is a spear phishing email with a malicious attachment.

The primary purpose of these families is to establish a**\n\n**bridgehead, collecting system information and downloading additional malware from a remote**\n\n**server.**\n\n**Malware** **Executable Type** **Cipher** **C2 address from**\n\n**Blog**\n\n**Elirks** **PE, PE64, DLL** **TEA, AES** **Yes**\n\n**Micrass** **PE** **TEA** **No**\n\n**Logedrut** **PE, MSIL** **DES** **Yes**\n\n**_Table 2 Malware characteristics_**\n\n**While many security vendors classify these samples as different malware families, they share**\n\n**functionality, code, and infrastructure, leading us to conclude that they in fact belong to the**\n\n**previously mentioned malware families.**\n\n**[As described in the previous blog post, one of the unique features of Elirks is that it retrieves a](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-tracking-elirks-variants-in-japan-similarities-to-previous-attacks/)**\n\n**command and control (C2) address from a public-facing blog service. When configured, the**\n\n**malware accesses a predetermined blog page, discovers a specific string, and proceeds to**\n\n**decode it with Base64 and decrypts it using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) cipher. The**\n\n**same functionality is found in Logedrut, however, instead of using the TEA cipher, it uses DES.**\n\n**A sample of Logedrut**\n\n**(afe57a51c5b0e37df32282c41da1fdfa416bbd9f32fa94b8229d6f2cc2216486) accesses a free**\n\n**blog service hosted in Japan and reads the following article posted by the threat actor.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4 Encoded C2 address posted by attacker_**\n\n**The routine called GetAddressByBlog() in Logedrut looks for text between two pre-defined**\n\n**strings. In this particular case, the malware sample will look for test between “doctor fish” and**\n\n**“sech yamatala”. The threat determines encoded text is**\n\n**“pKuBzxxnCEeN2CWLAu8tj3r9WJKqblE+” and proceeds to handle it using the following**\n\n**function.**\n\n**_Figure 5 Code finding encoded C2 address from blog_**\n\n**This code deciphers the string with BASE64 and DES. So far all Logedrut samples use exactly**\n\n**the same key, 1q2w3e4r, for decryption. The following Python code can be used to decode the**\n\n**C2 address.**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n**4**\n**5**\n**6**\n**7**\n**8**\n**9**\n**10**\n**11**\n\n\n**import base64**\n**import Crypto.Cipher.DES**\n\n**encoded_string = \"pKuBzxxnCEeN2CWLAu8tj3r9WJKqblE+\"**\n**iv = key = \"1q2w3e4r\"**\n\n**decoded_string = base64.b64decode(encoded_string)**\n**des = Crypto.Cipher.DES.new(key,** **Crypto.Cipher.DES.MODE_CBC,** **iv)**\n**decrypted_string = des.decrypt(decoded_string)**\n\n**print decrypted_string**\n\n\n**Elirks and Micrass employ exactly the same TEA cipher. TEA is a block cipher that operates**\n\n**against 64-bit (8 bytes) of data at a time to encrypt and decrypt. The author of the code added**\n\n**and extra cipher operation by XORing data when a block size is less than 64 bits. For example,**\n\n**if the encrypted data length is 248 bits (31 bytes), the code in both malware samples decrypts**\n\n**the first three blocks (64 x 3 = 192 bits) with TEA. The final block is only 56 bits (248 – 192 =**\n\n**56), so the code uses a simple XOR operation against the remaining data. This supplement to**\n\n**TEA has not been widely used, and all Elirks and Micrass samples have the same static key**\n\n**(2D 4E 51 67 D5 52 3B 75) for the XOR operation. Due to these similarities, we can conclude**\n\n**that the author of both families may be the same, or has access to the same source code.**\n\n**_Figure 6 TEA with XOR Cipher in Elirks and Micrass_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**malware samples, and yet they prefer using servers located in Hong Kong no matter where the**\n\n**target resides.**\n\n**_Figure 7 Location of C2 servers_**\n\n**We found a spear phishing email sent to a government agency in Taiwan on March 2015. The**\n\n**email sender masquerades as an airline company, and the RAR archive attachment contains**\n\n**the custom installer named Ticket.exe that drops Ticket.doc and Micrass malware.**\n\n**_Figure 8 Spear-phishing email sent to an agency in Taiwan_**\n\n**During the analysis of the email, we came across an article in a Taiwan newspaper from**\n\n**February 2014 that alerted the public about a similar email message being widely distributed**\n\n**that contained a malicious attachment. The only difference between the email messages in**\n\n**[Figure 8 and in the news article was the date. The adversary reused the email message more](http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/breakingnews/957005)**\n\n**than a year ago.**\n\n**The most interesting part of this attack campaign is that the threat actor has been using stolen**\n\n**documents from previously compromised organizations to perform additional attacks since early**\n\n**2015. These documents are not publicly available nor do they look to be created from scratch by**\n\n**the attacker. Because they contain sensitive data tying to the specific business, it is unlikely that**\n\n**a third party would be able to craft them.**\n\n**The following figure shows the decoy file installed by a sample identified in early April 2015. The**\n\n**file is a weekly report created at the end of March 2015 by a salesperson at a Japanese trading**\n\n**company. The report includes various sensitive information specific to their business.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 9 Weekly report from a Japanese trading company_**\n\n**The properties identified within the document indicate that the company name matches the**\n\n**context, and the person who last modified it is the same individual seen in the document itself.**\n\n**Because of this, the file appears legitimate and it’s very unlikely that this document would ever**\n\n**be made publicly available. The threat actor almost certainly stole this document soon after it**\n\n**was created, and reused it as the decoy for next target within a week of the theft.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 10 Property of the decoy document_**\n\n**Another installer found in Japan in May 2015 also contained sensitive information. The decoy**\n\n**looks to be a draft version of a legitimate contract addendum between the subsidiary of a**\n\n**Japanese petroleum company based in Australia, and a China-based company. The document**\n\n**provides details of the deal, including price.

One plausible explanation would be that the threat actors**\n\n**target different persons or departments within same organization or industry.**\n\n**So far, we have described two trading companies in Japan that are possibly targeted. In addition**\n\n**to these two companies, there is another company in Japan that could be involved in the attack**\n\n**campaign as well. A sample of Logedrut was identified and is capable of communicating with C2**\n\n**through an internal proxy server in the compromised organization. The sample contains an**\n\n**internal proxy address for a trading company in Japan as seen in String7 in the image below.**\n\n**Thus, the sample is specially crafted for this specific enterprise.**\n\n**_Figure 12 Internal proxy address in Logedrut_**\n\n**MILE TEA i fi** **l** **t** **t d** **tt** **k** **i** **f** **d** **b** **i** **d** **t**\n\n\n-----\n\n**from commodity products to aviation around the world.
