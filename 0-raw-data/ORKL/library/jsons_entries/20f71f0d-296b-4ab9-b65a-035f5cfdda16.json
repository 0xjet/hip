Transparent Tribe has\nalso been known to target entities in Afghanistan and social activists in Pakistan, the latter of\nwhich points towards the assumed attribution of Pakistani intelligence. Tools used by this\ngroup include CrimsonRAT, ObliqueRAT, PeppyRAT and AndroidRAT, with most campaigns\ndiscovered relying on spear-phishing and social-engineering of victims. Over the coming\nmonths Team Cymru’s S2 analytic unit will be focusing on the infrastructure behind these\nknown toolsets.\n\nThis is the first article of a two-part series on Transparent Tribe’s CrimsonRAT infrastructure.\n\nWe have been tracking CrimsonRAT, Transparent Tribe’s most ubiquitous remote access\ntool, over a number of months. This blog will present our high-level observations based on a\nstudy of 23 CrimsonRAT command and control (C2) servers. Our intention is to provide\nsupporting context to existing Transparent Tribe reporting and IOCs, to aide in future threat\nreconnaissance activities against this group.\n\nKey Observations\n\n\n-----\n\nC2s hosted with a number of different VPS providers – most commonly Contabo,\nColoCrossing, Pi Net and QuadraNet.\nPort 3389 was observed open on 83% of the CrimsonRAT C2 servers.\nA total of 62 distinct beacon ports were observed, with minimal evidence of port re-use\nacross C2s\nTraffic to ip-api[.]com, used in the IP geolocation of victims, noted from C2\n172.245.87.12\nA review of a recent Transparent Tribe campaign reveals the targeted nature of the\ngroup’s activities.\n\nFigure 1:\n\nSummary of Findings\n**Please note that details of all 23 CrimsonRAT C2 servers are provided in the technical**\n**appendix at the end of this blog.**\n\nCrimsonRAT C2 Hosting\n\nWhen examining the IP attribution of CrimsonRAT C2 servers, it is apparent that\nTRANSPARENT TRIBE actors have sought to spread their infrastructure across a number of\ndistinct providers, likely to provide some resilience to their operations. Whilst eight different\nproviders were observed (Figure 2), there was a degree of preference noted for Contabo (5\nservers), QuadraNet (4), Pi Net (4) and ColoCrossing (3).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2:\n\nSummary of Hosting Providers\nWhen actors consider which hosting provider to use, many factors likely enter their decisionmaking process; accepted payment methods, geographical diversity, local privacy laws, and\nthe probability of law enforcement disruption, to name a few.\n\nOne caveat for these findings is that whilst specific providers have been mentioned, based\non available Whois information, in some cases the ranges used by Transparent Tribe may\nhave been sub-leased to other providers.\n\n**Port 3389**\n\nWhen reviewing open ports on the CrimsonRAT C2 server set, Port 3389, commonly\nassociated with the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), was observed open in 83% of cases\n(19 of 23). Whilst this finding may be coincidental, the observed prevalence suggests it is a\npossible prerequisite for the functionality of the C2 server or it’s administration.\n\nTransparent Tribe are known to run different versions of a .NET application which acts as the\nCrimsonRAT command-and-control panel. This is a GUI application which is used to manage\ncomponents of the tool on victim hosts (see https://securelist.com/transparent-tribe-part1/98127/). As an interactive session is required to interface with this application, one\nhypothesis is that the actors require RDP access to the CrimsonRAT command-and-control\npanel.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of CrimsonRAT servers were found to be running Windows Server\n2012R2.\n\nWe are currently conducting an analysis of ongoing and historic connections to CrimsonRAT\nC2s on Port 3389. The goal of this analysis is to identify any potential uses by Transparent\nTribe actors (thus identifying higher order infrastructure), as well as separating this activity\nfrom the regular scanning of Port 3389, which takes place on the Internet every day.\n\n**Beacon Ports**\n\n\n-----\n\nA typical CrimsonRAT payload can have up to five pre-configured callback ports for\ncommunications with the C2 server. We have witnessed minimal evidence of port re-use\nacross samples and the C2s we have analyzed, with only four ports being used more than\nonce: 3878, 4586, 6818 and 8666. It’s possible these ports are seemingly randomly selected\nby the operator.\n\nIn total, 62 distinct beacon ports were identified across the 23 C2 servers, from the lower end\nof 2991 to the higher end of 54131 – although the majority of ports were clustered between\n2991 and 17443.\n\nC2 172.245.87.12 (ip-api[.]com Usage)\n\nIn addition to inbound victim traffic to C2 172.245.87.12 (AS-COLOCROSSING, US), we also\nobserved outbound connections to ip-api[.]com (208.95.112.1) on Port 80, during the period\n12 December 2020 – 06 March 2021.\n\nThis finding supports the presence of server version ‘A’ (as described in the aforementioned\n[Securelist blog) on this particular C2 – which is known to use ip-api[.]com for performing IP](https://securelist.com/transparent-tribe-part-1/98127/)\ngeolocation lookups of victims when they beacon in.\n\nOur own analysis of the CrimsonRAT server source code identifies that the ip-api[.]com\nlookup occurs automatically when a new victim calls into the controller and that these results\nare then cached so that further lookups are not required. These lookups can therefore be\nrepresented as evidence of ‘new’ victims with associated timestamp information providing an\nindication as to when an initial compromise has taken place. It is possible that multiple\nlookups could occur for the same victim when their IP address changes due to dynamic\nassignments.\n\nBased on our coverage of C2 172.245.87.12 we see victim IPs assigned to Indian providers\nbeaconing to the configured ports (as described above). Therefore, using a conversion from\nUTC to Indian Standard Time (IST) – UTC+05:30, we can see that victims have been newly\ncompromised during ‘usual’ office hours:\n\n**Time Correlation:**\n\n2020-12-12 03:39:17 UTC = 09:09:17 Local IST\n2020-12-30 07:28:02 UTC = 12:58:02 Local IST\n2021-02-04 07:53:52 UTC = 13:23:52 Local IST\n2021-02-23 03:51:31 UTC = 09:21:31 Local IST\n2021-03-04 12:10:54 UTC = 17:40:54 Local IST\n2021-03-06 04:15:27 UTC = 09:45:27 Local IST\n2021-03-14 09:59:47 UTC = 15:29:47 Local IST\n\nThese findings are caveated by the limitations of our coverage, i.e., these findings are\naccurate based on the traffic we have observed – other compromises may have taken place\noutside of these hours\n\n\n-----\n\nVictimology\n\nA recent Transparent Tribe campaign, targeting the Indian Air Force (IAF), was used to\nprovide an example of victimology.\n\n[On 24 March 2021, a Transparent Tribe lure document (Figure 4) was disclosed on Twitter,](https://twitter.com/ShadowChasing1/status/1374713017791705089)\ncomprising a PowerPoint presentation for an IAF/industry collaborative event – ‘INDISEM2021’.\n\nThe objective of this event was to purportedly identify organizations in India’s commercial\nsectors capable of undertaking maintenance contracts for the IAF fleet.\n\nFigure 3:\n\nLure Document Positioning an Indian Air Force Conference\nThe venue for the event is listed as the Air Force Auditorium in Subroto Park, New Delhi.\nOpen-source research identifies Subroto Park as the location of numerous IAF buildings,\nincluding the ‘Air Force School’ (Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Subroto Park and the Indian Air\n\nForce Buildings\nNetwork traffic data for the C2 185.136.169.155 used in this campaign was reviewed and\nvictim IP addresses connecting to the beacon ports (6128, 8761, 11214, 15882, 17443),\nwere plotted on a map using geolocation information.\n\nThis process revealed two clusters of victims in close proximity to Subroto Park (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5:\n\nSubroto Park (blue) in Relation to Victim Clusters (red)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe victim cluster to the North centered around another area containing a number of IAF\nbuildings, including an Air Force Station. The Southern cluster centered around the\nresidential area of Sarojini Nagar. Between the two clusters sits Safdarjung Airport, a site\nwhich houses a number of Government Administrative buildings, including the Airports\nAuthority of India and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. The airfield itself is still\noperational and is used for the transfer of high-value individuals to Indira Ghandi\nInternational Airport when they travel out of the country – the Presidential estate is located\njust to the North of the Air Force Station marked in Figure 4.\n\nThe available coverage of this particular campaign shows the likely targeting of individuals\nwithin Indian Government or IAF locations, as well as a nearby residential area which could\nfeasibly house some of these individuals.\n\nTechnical Appendix\n\n***Beacon Ports consist of observed network traffic to known C2’s and may not be\nrepresentative of entire CrimsonRAT configuration.\n\n**IP Address** **Whois** **Open Ports** **Beacon Ports**\n\n134.119.181.15 Pi Net, LLC, VN 3389 8861, 8561, 6818\n\n151.106.14.125 Pi Net, LLC, VN 3389 6818, 14618, 8722, 16418, 3468\n\n151.106.19.220 Pi Net, LLC, VN 3389 2682\n\n172.245.247.112 ColoCrossing 3389 3878, 5648, 8666, 11824, 14624\n\n172.245.87.12 ColoCrossing 3389 4586, 6276, 8443, 12447, 18856\n\n173.212.192.229 Contabo 3389 3364, 16564, 8264\n\n173.249.22.30 Contabo 3389 4228, 16582, 10864\n\n173.249.14.104 Contabo 3389 6630, 9808, 3312\n\n173.249.42.113 Contabo 3389 8148\n\n185.136.169.155 Pi Net, LLC, VN 3389 8761, 11214, 6128, 15882, 17443\n\n185.174.102.105 DeltaHost 80 2991, 5991, 54131\n\n198.12.90.116 ColoCrossing 3389 3691, 6582, 4684\n\n23.254.119.11 B2 Net Solutions 3389 3163, 6614, 4828, 5661\n\n23.254.119.118 ColoCrossing 11214\n\n209.127.16.126 B2 Net Solutions 3389 4768\n\n\n-----\n\n45.32.151.155 Vultr 21, 80, 3389 6126, 11427, 12835\n\n45.77.246.69 Vultr 3389 16185\n\n5.189.134.216 Contabo 5156\n\n64.188.12.126 QuadraNet 3389 9666, 12824, 6658, 49747\n\n64.188.25.143 QuadraNet 3389 4586\n\n64.188.25.206 QuadraNet 4125, 6522, 16621, 11422\n\n66.154.113.38 QuadraNet 3389 3878, 8666\n\n89.249.65.206 M247 3389 4816\n\n\n-----",
