Dropped by the Nuclear exploit kit, further investigation showed that the malware was a\nnew Trojan called Thanatos by its developers and that we refer to internally as \"Alphabot\".\n\nThanatos is being marketed as a service with both short and long-term subscriptions and\nsupport and the authors claim it is under ongoing development with new plugins and\nfunctionality being actively added.\n\nThe following analysis details what we have observed and uncovered so far.\n\n_Figure 1 : Nuclear Pack dropping “Alphabot”, first observed on February 15, 2016_\n\n[The malware sample analyzed contains the following program database (PDB) path, on](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yd4f8bd1(vs.71).aspx)\nwhich we based the bot’s name:\n\n_H:\\Alpha\\Bot\\Release\\Loader.pdb_\n\nThe malware performs HTTP requests to its command and control (C&C) server, for example\n_alpha[.]highclasssoftware[.]ru/gate.php, as shown in Figure 2. Proofpoint currently detects_\nthis malware based on this C&C communication.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: “Alphabot” calling home_\n\nFurther examination of the malware shows that it modifies the Windows Registry to start the\n[malicious binary during startup (Fig. 3). Like a number of other malware authors, the registry](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/05/krebs-krebsonsecurity-as-malware-memes/)\nkey invokes Brian Krebs in the naming convention:\n\n_Figure 3: One more Krebs malware meme_\n\n**Malware For Sale**\n\nOn March 6, we found an underground advertisement for a new Trojan. While we cannot\npublicly disclose how we connected the dots, the following advertisement is describing\n“Alphabot.” The description underscores features such as Download/Execute, Form Grabber,\nUpdate and future plugins such as HiddenVNC, HiddenFTP, SOCKS and WebInjects.\n\n**Thanatos Bot [IE/FF/Chrome/MSE]**\n\nGreetings users of [REDACTED] - I would like to introduce to you trojan \"Thanatos\".\n\nImportant aspects of Thanatos?\n\nProgramming Languages: C++, Masm, Delphi\n\nOS: Windows XP/2003, Vista/2008, 7, 8, 8.1/2012, 10\n\nAdmin Rights Required: No, Thanatos runs in user-mode\n\nUnicode Supported: Yes, Thanatos can run on any system language\n\nSize of stub: 150 - 350 kb, it varies depending on your build expectation\n\nRun-time FUD Support: Yes, i will provide updates to bypass most heuristics & proactive of\nAV\n\nScan-time FUD Support: No, this part is on you (use any crypter that you wish)\n\n\n-----\n\nCross-architecture Support: Yes, Thanatos is able to inject code into both x86 & x64\nprocesses, it is important to take note that x64 code injection on Windows 10 will not work (I\nam working on patch to re-open Heavens Gate)\n\nWhat is functionality inside Thanatos?\n\nFormgrabber Support: Yes, form grabber will inject both x86 & x64 browsers on either x86 or\nx64 versions of Windows. Currently there is support for\n\nIE (Internet Explorer), IE7/8/9/10/11, hooks will bypass Protected Mode too!\n\nFF (Firefox/Mozilla), FF, all versions are supported (both nss3/nspr)\n\nGC (Chrome/Chromium), GC30-46,48+ (working on fixing an issue in 47)\n\nMSE (Microsoft Edge), Hook into explorer.exe waits for RuntimeBroker.exe, followed by\ninjection into MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe to hook HttpSendRequestW/A (same as IE)\n\nTo-be added: Opera, Safari\n\nDownload/Execute (EXE, JAR, SCR, COM, etc) OR Inject (DLL, .PLUG = Plugins)\n\nUpdate (If you receive an update build, make an update task so your bots will live longer)\n\nAnti-hook: Removes hooks in target processes from other bots so that no one (other bots on\nsame victim) will have your logs\n\nBot-killer: AV-Module will scan for other bots on the system, and will remove them once\ndetected (scans task scheduler, registry, services (if admin), and environment variable\npaths). If the process is considered malicious (from 3-8 hardcoded flags), it will upload file to\nvirustotal.com and parse results from page, if detection on > 3 AV's then malicious file will be\nremoved from system!\n\nWatermark: All builds are watermarked with a unique customer-id, if you leak, then your\nlicense will be terminated\n\nWhat do I get with purchase of my license?\n\nInfinite rebuilds for the duration of your term\n\nPanel (web component, if you're hosting on your own servers Ioncube loader is required)\n\nUpdates of your stub whenever a change is made (by my team)\n\nRuntime patches to evade heuristic or proactive detection engines\n\nFull support (my team is located in various countries, support can be around the clock, 24/7)\n\n\n-----\n\nImportant Notes\n\nIf you are in need of an Exploit Kit (Private), Traffic (From our affiliate), or Crypt (Homemade), Bulletproof Hosting (feedback from previous customers available) then you should\nnot worry as we can offer it as well.\n\nWhat are the plans for the future?\n\nWe will be working on improving this trojan for as long as there is interest in our product. We\ncan make anything that you request, and if you have any suggestions you can always let us\nknow, and we will try our best to meet your standards to the highest degree possible!\n\nWe also have plans to write additional plugins to help you make money. In the coming\nmonths, along with everything stated above we plan to make the follows unique plugins (from\nscratch):\n\nHiddenVNC\n\n- This will not be a rip-off of Zeus like everyone before us\n\n- We plan to make ours much more stable in terms of connection speed & encoding quality\n\n- This plugin will not require admin permissions and but will require a back-connect server\n\nHiddenFTP\n\n- This will be a plugin similar to that of the Ramnit bonnet\n\n- You will be able remotely download/upload files from the victim you choose\n\n- This plugin will not require admin permissions and but will require a back-connect server\n\nSOCKS4b/5\n\n- This plugin will bypass NAT/Network Firewall\n\n- It will work with a back-connect server and not through SSH\n\nWebInjects\n\n- This will be the first plugin to be added\n\n- This plugin will be much faster than Zeus Web Injects\n\n- It will not stress the loading time of webpages and will be affective with both HTTP/HTTPS\n\n- Web Injects will have the option to be grabbed remotely (can affect loading time of\nwebpage) or they can be stored locally (will not affect the loading time of webpage)\n\n- There will also be an option to update the web injects locally from the panel (web server)\nwhen a web browser is not opened\n\nRootkit\n\n- We have already written a rootkit for Ring-3, it works on both x86/x64\n\n- We are deciding whether to make a Ring-0 rootkit or stick with the current one\n\n- It is important to take note that in our own tests some of our bots with AVs have lived\ngreater than 1 month without an update and the core component of or 4-stage dropper still\nremains FUD\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is the price for a license?\n\nThe price for Thanatos depends on the term which you wish to purchase it for, the schematic\nis as follows (each term comes with everything stated above):\n\n1 month rent = $1,700 USD\n3 month rent = $4,800 USD\n6 month rent = $9,200 USD\n\nLifetime License = $12,000 USD\n\nIf you wish to talk about the pricing/license/more-info you can contact me in jabber, please\nnote ONLY the jabbers below are used by me, every other jabber that is NOT listed below\nshould be assumed a ripper.\n\nESCROW IS ACCEPTED\n\nJabber (XMPP):\n\n#1 - [redacted]@sj.ms\n#2 - [redacted]@null.pm\n#3 - [redacted]@exploit.im\n\nThe author of the advertisement is also showing images of the C&C panel which are\nincluded below. Here are a few important takeaways from the advertisement:\n\nThe authors appear to be well-embedded in the cybercrime underground and are ready\nto make life as easy as possible for future customers. Offering private exploit kits,\naffiliate traffic, packing (crypt services), and hosting makes this something of a onestop shop for cyber criminals.\n[The malware makes use of VirusTotal to scan for other suspected malware on infected](https://www.virustotal.com/)\nmachines. While the \"bot killer\" functionality isn't new, the conditional upload to\nVirusTotal is unusual, helping to ensure that other malware doesn't have access to the\ndata on the infected PC.\nOngoing updates make this \"malware as a service\" even more attractive to prospective\ncustomers.\nThe malware supports all major versions of Microsoft Windows, and they specifically\nmention support for Microsoft's 8-month-old Edge browser.\n\n**Thanatos in action**\n\nThe following screenshot is the Thanatos home page, according to the ad.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Thanatos C&C home page_\n\nThe remaining panel pages from the advertisement are self explanatory and we present\nthem with captions only.\n\n_Figure 5: Bots Page_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Create a Task_\n\n_Figure 7: Viewing a Task_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Task Information_\n\n_Figure 9: Viewing Logs_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: User Management_\n\n_Figure 11: User Permissions_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: Panel Settings_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAlthough we have yet to see widespread use of Thanatos, it appears to be a robust, fullfeatured new Trojan. Based on the author's description in the ad, Thanatos will be a flexible\ntool for threat actors. The comparisons to Zeus give hints about expected uses. For\nThanatos/Alphabot, the authors appear to be ready to provide access to a complete\necosystem of underground tools, making this new Trojan attractive to malicious actors and\nworthy of attention from organizations and security vendors.\n\nWe will be actively watching for new developments and appearances in the wild and\nupdating protection as needed.\n\n**IOCs**\n\nThanatos :\n6b6978726960c090479ab6a67b05eb62d1d4894b89fa6d094be31b7f71c3913a\n2085db7e7764e0693fe128fa7530338af8c8c598d1f3a85a2299991248ec553a\n6043a9d69eee2994d330b891d29115e95d5466fb0673932e85c16a4c0232b81b\n\nC&C :\nalpha[.]highclasssoftware[.]ru 85.93.5.121\n\nRules :\n2816233     ETPRO TROJAN Thanatos CnC Post\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
