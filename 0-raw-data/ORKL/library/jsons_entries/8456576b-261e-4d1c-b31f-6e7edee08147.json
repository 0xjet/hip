    "plain_text": "# In The Wild: Mobile Malware Implements New Features\n\n**[blog.checkpoint.com/2016/06/17/in-the-wild-mobile-malware-implements-new-features/](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/06/17/in-the-wild-mobile-malware-implements-new-features/)**\n\nJune 17, 2016\n\nMalware developers just won’t stand still. They continue developing malware as they go,\nsometimes to adapt to the changing threat landscape, and sometimes simply to improve\ntheir capabilities. Recently, two examples of such advancements presented themselves,\none in Triada’s code and one in Viking Horde’s.\n\n**Triada’s Trident is Getting Stronger**\n\nAs if [the original malware wasn’t bad enough, Triada has now received a dangerous](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/03/11/in-the-wild-mobile-security-observations-from-the-check-point-research-team-6/)\nupdate. Triada’s main purpose is to steal money transferred over SMS messages as part of\nin-app purchases. The malware does so by leveraging its system level malicious\ncompromise to highjack the raw SMS data (PDU) and send it directly to its C&C servers.\n\nThe new module introduced by the latest strain of Triada uses a similar concept to target\nincoming URLs. The malware is capable of leveraging root access to inject code into four\nbrowsers, including Android’s default browser. Once the malware detects an incoming URL,\nit postpones it, and if the URL meets certain terms set by Triada it will replace it with any\nURL the attackers choose. The user could enter credentials in a fraudulent page, or even\ndownload additional malware, without knowing he is visiting a malicious site.\n\n**Meet the Horde: Part FOUR**\n\nNo matter how far we delve into the Viking Horde malware, we find new, innovative\nfeatures. Viking Horde is malware discovered last month on Google Play by the Check\nPoint research team. It’s the first of its kind malware in many areas including its primary\ngoal of creating a botnet through which it conducts fraud.\n\n\n-----\n\nViking Horde s newest technique is its ability to check running processes on Android s latest\nversions (Lollipop and Marshmallow) to bypass Google’s security measures. In the past,\nthis feature was used mainly by banker malware to monitor any activation of a banking app,\nupon which the malware would pop a fake overlay page.\n\nGoogle has invested some efforts in preventing such activity and blocked apps from calling\nthe getRunningTasks() API. Viking Horde manages to bypass this security measure by\nreading the “/proc/” file system, which displays running processes, from which the malware\ncan find the current running processes.\n\n**Everywhere Computing Means Everywhere, Including Your Smart TV**\n\nRecently, the Flocker mobile ransomware managed to infect smart TVs as well. This is\nadditional evidence to the ever widening phenomenon of everywhere computing. Malware\nis capable of propagating throughout every possible location in your network, no matter\nwhat connection you might use.\n\nIn the ransomware’s case, this is even truer. Ransomware attempts to encrypt any data it\ncan reach. While in this case it was merely a TV set (which can be a devastating concept\nfor some), it demonstrates how malware can cross boundaries, using your mobile device as\na starting point.\n\nMalware on your mobile device endangers not only everything on it but everything on you\nentire network, including computers. Users should make sure they close all possible\nbreaches in their security, including those on mobile.\n\n**Saudi Government Job Seekers Under Attack**\n\nA recent malware campaign targets a particular sector – Saudi governmental job seekers,\nthrough a job site. The malware itself is a full-grown surveillance tool, with vast capabilities,\nincluding stealing contacts, SMS messages, and voice calls from infected devices and\nforwards them to the attacker’s server.\n\nUsually, such malware is not widely spread, and target specific users through spear\nphishing attacks. The motive for the attack remains unclear, but the malware displays once\nagain the full potential that exists in mobile malware.\n\nUsers face an increasing number of attacks from more and different types of malware.\nMalware continuously evolves and upgrades its capabilities. To stay protected, users must\nuse security solutions that can keep them one step ahead of malware at all times.\n\n**Learn more:**\n[Check Point Mobile Threat Prevention](http://www.checkpoint.com/mobilesecurity)\n\n\n-----\n\n**See it in action:**\n[Schedule a demo of Mobile Threat Prevention](https://www.checkpoint.com/request-a-demo/index.html)\n\n_Oren Koriat is a Mobile Information Security Analyst in the Check Point Mobile Threat_\n_Prevention Research Group.
