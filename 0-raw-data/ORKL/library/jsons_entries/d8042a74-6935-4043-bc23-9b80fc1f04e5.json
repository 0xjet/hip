It predominantly targets overseas governmental,\ndiplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets for intelligence purposes. It is\ntechnologically advanced, developing capabilities to try to operate undetected against\ncountries in Europe, NATO members and its near neighbours.\n\nA compromise of SolarWinds IT services firm was discovered in December 2020.\nSolarWinds confirmed 18,000 organisations across the world including US Government\ndepartments were affected. The overall impact on the UK of the SVR’s exploitation of this\nsoftware is low. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) advice on how to protect against this\nthreat is [available](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/dealing-with-the-solarwinds-orion-compromise)\n\nThe NCSC has assessed that it is highly likely Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Services are\nresponsible for the compromise of SolarWinds software, Orion, and subsequent targeting.\nFurther details on the framework used by the UK Government for all source intelligence\n[assessments, including the probability yardstick, are available from here](https://files.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/admin/fairs/apptrack/download.cgi?SID=b3duZXI9NTA3MDAwMCZvd25lcnR5cGU9ZmFpciZkb2NfdHlwZT12YWMmZG9jX2lkPTc4NjA0NiZ2ZXJpZnk9Yjg4MDZhNmVmZjA4ZTYxYWFkMDViY2YzMGYxZTRkNjU=)\n\nSVR cyber actors are known and tracked in open source as: APT29 Cozy Bear The Dukes.\n\nThis incident is part of a pattern of behaviour by the SVR, which includes:\n\n**Date** **Incident** **Description**\n\n\nOngoing\nsince at\nleast\n2011\n\nOngoing\nsince at\nleast\n2015\n\n\nMFAs and MoD\nestablishments in\nEurope and NATO\nmember countries\n\nTargeting research\ninstitutes and think\ntanks.\n\n\nThe SVR uses their access to governmental networks\nacross Europe and NATO member countries to collect\nintelligence information, including that of ongoing\ngeopolitical issues.\n\nThe SVR targeted research institutes and think tanks\nfor intelligence collection.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date** **Incident** **Description**\n\n2020 SolarWinds 18,000 organisations across the world including US\nGovernment departments’ were affected by the SVR\ncompromising Solar Winds Orion software.\n\nThe UK government has previously exposed details of other parts of the Russia intelligence\nservice conducting cyber operations.\n\nWith the information provided today, the UK government has exposed the following parts of\nthe Russian cyber programme:\n\n**Russian Intelligence Services Cyber Structures**\n\n## Russian Intelligence Services Cyber Structures\n\nJPEG, 76.4 KB\n\nThis file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\n\nRequest an accessible format.\nIf you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader) and need a version of this\n[document in a more accessible format, please email fcdo.correspondence@fcdo.gov.uk.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:fcdo.correspondence@fcdo.gov.uk?body=Details%20of%20document%20required%3A%0A%0A%20%20Title%3A%20Russian%20Intelligence%20Services%20Cyber%20Structures%0A%20%20Original%20format%3A%20jpg%0A%0APlease%20tell%20us%3A%0A%0A%20%201.%20What%20makes%20this%20format%20unsuitable%20for%20you%3F%0A%20%202.%20What%20format%20you%20would%20prefer%3F%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20&subject=Request%20for%20%27Russian%20Intelligence%20Services%20Cyber%20Structures%27%20in%20an%20alternative%20format)\nPlease tell us what format you need.
