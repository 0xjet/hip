This was [also confirmed](https://twitter.com/ransomwarefiles/status/1498086108395360256)\nby cybersecurity firm Hold Security.\n\nIn total, there are 393 leaked JSON files containing a total of 60,694 messages since\nJanuary 21, 2021, through today. Conti launched their operation in July 2020, so while it\ncontains a big chunk of their internal conversations, it is not all of them.\n\n**Leaked Conti conversations**\n\n\n-----\n\nThese conversations contain various information about the gang s activities, including\npreviously unreported victims, private data leak URLs, bitcoin addresses, and discussions\nabout their operations.\n\nFor example, the conversation below is the Conti members wondering how\n[BleepingComputer learned of their attack on Shutterfly in December.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-services-disrupted-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n**Conversations shared with BleepingComputer about Shutterfly**\n\n_Translated by Google Translate_\nKremez also shared a snippet of conversation that he found discussing how the TrickBot\noperation was shut down, as we reported last week.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Discussion about TrickBot closing down**\n\n_Translated by Google Translate_\nThere are also conversations about Conti/TrickBot's [Diavol ransomware operation and 239](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-links-diavol-ransomware-to-the-trickbot-cybercrime-group/)\nbitcoin addresses containing $13 million in payments, which were added to the\n[Ransomwhere site.](https://ransomwhe.re/)\n\n239 Bitcoin addresses representing ~$13.1 million in payments from the Conti leak\n[have been added to https://t.co/lBxHWCQm7S. The full dataset is available to](https://t.co/lBxHWCQm7S)\n[download from the site.#ransomware](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ransomware?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Conti](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Conti?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[— Ransomwhere (@ransomwhere_) February 27, 2022](https://twitter.com/ransomwhere_/status/1498084559136645125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe leak of these messages is a severe blow to the ransomware operation, providing\nsensitive intelligence to researchers and law enforcement about their internal processes.\n\nWhile the above snippets are only a tiny piece of the leaked conversations, we can expect\nto see far more information learned from the data in the coming weeks.\n\n## Messages leaked over Conti's siding with Russia\n\nEarlier this week, the Conti ransomware operation published a blog post announcing their\nfull support for the Russian government's attack on Ukraine. They also warned that if\nanyone organized a cyberattack against Russia, the Conti gang would strike back at critical\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter Ukrainian Conti affiliates grew upset over the siding with Russia, the Conti gang\nreplaced their message with another one, stating that they \"do not ally with any\ngovernment\" and that they \"condemn the ongoing war.\"\n\nHowever, their change of heart came too late, and a Ukrainian security researcher who\nreportedly had access to Conti's backend XMPP server emailed BleepingComputer and\nother journalists tonight with a link to the leaked data.\n\nThe reason shared as to why they leaked the private conversations can be read below:\n\nHere is a friendly heads-up that the Conti gang has just lost all their sh*t. Please\nknow this is true.\n\nThe link will take you to download an 1.tgz file that can be unpacked running tar -xzvf\n1.tgz command in your terminal .\n\nThe contents of the first dump contain the chat communications (current, as of today\nand going to the past) of the Conti Ransomware gang. We promise it is very\ninteresting.\n\nThere are more dumps coming, stay tuned.\n\nYou can help the world by writing this as your top story.\n\nIt is not malware or a joke.\n\nThis is being sent to many journalists and researchers.\n\nThank you for your support\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has led to hackers, ransomware gangs, and security\n[researchers picking sides in the conflict.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-hackers-pick-sides-over-russia-invading-ukraine/)\n\n[While some ransomware gangs have sided with Russia, others, like LockBit, are staying](https://twitter.com/LawrenceAbrams/status/1498015863370358791)\nneutral.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, Ukraine has asked volunteer researchers and hackers to join their IT\nArmy\" to conduct cyberattacks on Russian targets, with many rallying to the call.\n\nAs for Conti, while this leak is embarrassing and provides immense insight into their\noperation, we are not likely to see them going away any time soon. With their recent take\nover of the stealthy BazarBackdoor malware and becoming an actual crime syndicate, they\nwill, unfortunately, continue to be a threat.\n\n_Correction 2/28/22: This story initially stated an angry Conti affiliate who leaked the data._\n_BleepingComputer later learned it was leaked by a Ukrainian security researcher. The_\n_article has been updated to clarify this information._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - April 15th 2022 - Encrypting Russia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-april-15th-2022-encrypting-russia/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[Conti ransomware shuts down operation, rebrands into smaller units](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shuts-down-operation-rebrands-into-smaller-units/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 13th 2022 - A National Emergency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-13th-2022-a-national-emergency/)\n\n[Conti](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/conti/)\n[Jabber](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/jabber/)\n[Leak](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/leak/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Russia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/russia/)\n[Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ukraine/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
