    "plain_text": "# You Bet Your Lsass: Hunting LSASS Access\n\n**splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/you-bet-your-lsass-hunting-lsass-access.html**\n\nBy [Splunk Threat Research Team April 07, 2022](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/author/secmrkt-research.html)\n\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\n\nOne of the most commonly used techniques is to dump credentials after gaining initial access. Adversaries will use one of many ways, but\n[most commonly Mimikatz is used. Whether it be with PowerShell Invoke-Mimikatz, Cobalt Strike’s Mimikatz implementation, or a custom](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki)\nversion. All of these methods have a commonality: targeting LSASS. The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a process\nin Microsoft Windows operating systems that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on the system. It verifies users logging on to a\n[Windows computer or server, handles password changes, and creates access tokens (per Wikipedia).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service)\n\nWith that, the Splunk Threat Research Team dug into how Mimikatz, and a few other tools found in Atomic Red Team, access credentials via\nLSASS memory, [T1003.001. Part of this process for the Splunk Threat Research Team is to continuously update older analytics to ensure we](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/)\nare providing up to date coverage on latest techniques and behaviors.\n\nTo begin, we’ll look at our current analytics related to LSASS memory dumping. We will then simulate T1003.001, OS Credential Dumping:\nLSASS Memory, by using [Mimikatz, Cobalt Strike, Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) [T1003.001, and](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1003.001/T1003.001.md) [Invoke-Mimikatz. Last, we will update our current](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1)\nanalytics or create new ones.\n\n## Current Content Review\n\n### Access LSASS Memory for Dump Creation\n\nOur [first analytic identifies the image load dbgcore.dll or dbghelp.dll and a TargetImage of lsass.exe. Dbgcore.dll or dbghelp.dll are two core](https://splunkresearch.com/endpoint/access_lsass_memory_for_dump_creation/)\nWindows debug DLLs that have minidump functions which provide a way for applications to produce crashdump files that contain a useful\nsubset of the entire process context.\n\nThis analytic focuses on the CallTrace and identifies whether dbgcore.dll or dbghelp.dll are loaded to dump credentials.\n```\n`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe CallTrace=*dbgcore.dll* OR CallTrace=*dbghelp.dll*\n| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, TargetImage,TargetProcessId, SourceImage,\nSourceProcessId\n| rename Computer as dest\n| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`\n| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`\n\n```\nWe found, as we’ll show in our simulation, that dbgcore.dll and dbghelp.dll are no longer utilized with the latest version of Mimikatz or Cobalt\nStrike. However, it still does capture the more basic utilities that access LSASS memory.\n\n### Detect Credential Dumping through LSASS access\n\nThis analytic looks for GrantedAccess of 0x1010 or 0x1410 against lsass.exe. These are common access types and it's probably a good time\nto understand what they are and the common values.\n```\n`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe (GrantedAccess=0x1010 OR GrantedAccess=0x1410)\n| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, SourceImage, SourceProcessId, TargetImage,\nTargetProcessId, EventCode, GrantedAccess\n| rename Computer as dest\n| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`\n| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`\n\n```\nThis query is limited to two GrantedAcess rights that are familiar to older versions of Mimikatz, but does not stand the test of time in capturing\nth l t t i ht t\n\n\n-----\n\nG a ted ccess s t e equested pe ss o s by t e Sou ce age to t e a get age c oso t deta s out t e p ocess spec c access\nrights [here. The below list highlights the most common values. Note that these may be combined to create, for example, 0x1400](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/process-security-and-access-rights?redirectedfrom=MSDN)\n(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION and PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION). You may notice some other common values\nrelated to process command-line spoofing (PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME).\n\n**Value** **Meaning**\n\nPROCESS_ALL_ACCESS (0x1fffff) All possible access rights for a process object.\n\nPROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS (0x0080) Required to create a process.\n\nPROCESS_CREATE_THREAD (0x0002) Required to create a thread.\n\nPROCESS_DUP_HANDLE (0x0040) Required to duplicate a handle using DuplicateHandle.\n\nPROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION (0x0400) Required to retrieve certain information about a process, such as its token, exit code, and\npriority class (see OpenProcessToken).\n\n\nPROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION\n(0x1000)\n\n\nRequired to retrieve certain information about a process\n\n(see GetExitCodeProcess, GetPriorityClass, IsProcessInJob,\nQueryFullProcessImageName).\n\nA handle that has the PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION access right is automatically\ngranted PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION.\n\n\nPROCESS_SET_INFORMATION (0x0200) Required to set certain information about a process, such as its priority class (see\nSetPriorityClass).\n\nPROCESS_SET_QUOTA (0x0100) Required to set memory limits using SetProcessWorkingSetSize.\n\nPROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME (0x0800) Required to suspend or resume a process.\n\nPROCESS_TERMINATE (0x0001) Required to terminate a process using TerminateProcess.\n\nPROCESS_VM_OPERATION (0x0008)\n\nRequired to perform an operation on the address space of a process\n\n(see VirtualProtectEx and WriteProcessMemory).\n\nPROCESS_VM_READ (0x0010) Required to read memory in a process using ReadProcessMemory.\n\nPROCESS_VM_WRITE (0x0020) Required to write to memory in a process using WriteProcessMemory.\n\nSYNCHRONIZE (0x00100000L) Required to wait for the process to terminate using the wait functions.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of how these two current analytics work, let's capture data and begin to test them out further.\n\n## Capture Data\n\nTo get started with capturing process access event data with Sysmon, we have provided a simple config that identifies TargetImage of\n[lsass.exe. For other EDR products, the name may be similar - Cross Process Open for Carbon Black, or CrowdStrike Falcon](https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/enterprise-response/event-forwarder/event-schema/#ingresseventcrossprocopen-cross-process-open)\nSuspiciousCredentialModuleLoad or LsassHandleFromUnsignedModule (reference Falcon Data Dictionary).\n```\n<Sysmon schemaversion=\"4.81\">\n<!-- Capture all hashes -->\n<HashAlgorithms>md5</HashAlgorithms>\n    il i\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n<ProcessCreate onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 2 == File Creation Time. -->\n<FileCreateTime onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 3 == Network Connection. -->\n<NetworkConnect onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 5 == Process Terminated. -->\n<ProcessTerminate onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 6 == Driver Loaded.-->\n<DriverLoad onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 7 == Image Loaded. -->\n<ImageLoad onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 8 == CreateRemoteThread. -->\n<CreateRemoteThread onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 9 == RawAccessRead. -->\n<RawAccessRead onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 10 == ProcessAccess. -->\n<ProcessAccess onmatch=\"include\">\n<TargetImage condition=\"is\">C:\\Windows\\system32\\lsass.exe</TargetImage>\n</ProcessAccess>\n<!-- Event ID 11 == FileCreate. -->\n<FileCreate onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 12,13,14 == RegObject added/deleted, RegValue Set, RegObject Renamed. -->\n<RegistryEvent onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 15 == FileStream Created. -->\n<FileCreateStreamHash onmatch=\"include\"/>\n<!-- Event ID 17 == PipeEvent. -->\n<PipeEvent onmatch=\"include\"/>\n</EventFiltering>\n</Sysmon>\n\n```\nThe [Sysmon Modular project by](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular) [Olaf Hartong has some filtering that may be useful to enhance the configuration. In our testing, we utilized an](https://twitter.com/olafhartong)\n[open Sysmon configuration and the latest](https://gist.github.com/MHaggis/66dd0bf532e6dee15db2af7acf57667f) [version of Sysmon.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)\n\nNow we are ready to simulate.\n\n## Simulate\n\nTo simulate LSASS Memory Access, we will start with Atomic Red Team and follow up with Mimikatz, Invoke-Mimikatz, and Cobalt Strike.\n\n### Atomic Red Team\n\nFor T1003.001, LSASS Memory access, we can run individual tests or all. In this instance, we will download all the prerequisites and then run\nthem all. There are cases where the tests may not complete and may need to be fixed or run manually (this is all based on operating\nenvironment variables).\n\n[To download Invoke-Atomicredteam and the Atomic Tests, run the following](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam)\n```\n[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol =\n[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12\n  ( 'h // i h b / d /i k i d / /i ll i d ' i i )\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nInstall prerequisites\nSome Atomic tests have prerequisites and it is very simple to get those. This may include binaries or scripts needed to simulate\nthe test.\nInvoke-AtomicTest T1003.001 -GetPrereqs\n\n```\nNow we will invoke T1003.001.\n\n**Invoke-AtomicTest T1003.00**\n\nBefore we hop into Splunk, let's run the other two simulations.\n\n**Invoke-mimikatz**\n\nFor invoke-Mimikatz, we utilized Atomic Red Team T1059.001 test number 1. This uses the 2019 version of Mimikatz. Roberto Rodriguez\n[called out the differences in his blog from 2017 as well, in that older versions request different permissions. Upon successful execution, it will](https://cyberwardog.blogspot.com/2017/03/chronicles-of-threat-hunter-hunting-for_22.html)\ninvoke Mimikatz in memory and dump credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mimikatz\n\n[Download the latest Mimikatz from GitHub. Ensure AV and other products are turned off to avoid any issues.](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases)\n\nWe will run the following variations\n```\n.\\mimikatz.exe \"privilege::debug\" \"sekurlsa::logonpasswords\" exit\n.\\mimikatz.exe SEKURLSA::Krbtgt exit\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAlright, that finishes our easy tests for Mimikatz.\n\n### Mimikatz and Cobalt Strike\n\n[Similarly, run the same commands within a session using Cobalt Strike. The behavior we will look for here is similar to most Cobalt Strike](https://research.splunk.com/stories/cobalt_strike/)\nbehavior we've identified in the past, a spawned process, default of rundll32.exe, with no command-line arguments, with a process access\nevent targeting LSASS.exe.\n\n### Notes on testing\n\nTypically, our process is to simulate 1 test at a time and validate coverage. Iterate over each test and modify our query as needed. For brevity,\nthe blog skips the thorough process and highlights a faster process.\n\n## Continuous Improvement\n\n### Access LSASS Memory for Dump Creation\n\n\n-----\n\no ou st a a yt c t at ocuses o Ca ace age oad dbgco e d o dbg e p d, e ou d t at o e t e at o ed a ay o\nthese two DLLs (dbgcore.dll or dbghelp.dll). The main DLL used by Mimikatz is now ntdll.dll. Ntdll.dll is a native Windows binary that provides\n[similar native API paths to perform credential dumping. For example in the sekurlsa module there are many ntdll exported api’s, but what](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/blob/master/mimikatz/modules/sekurlsa/kuhl_m_sekurlsa.c#L1395)\nstands out is [RtlCopyMemory which is used to execute the module related to credential dumping.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-rtlcopymemory)\n\nAfter simulating the behavior we needed, we get some results\n```\n`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe CallTrace=*dbgcore.dll* OR CallTrace=*dbghelp.dll*\n| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, TargetImage,\nTargetProcessId, SourceImage, SourceProcessId\n| rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`\n\n```\nIn our screenshot, we see some utilities that still use dbgcore.dll or dbghelp.dll when credential dumping occurs. However, we do not see\nMimikatz.exe and a few other utilities using dbgcore.dll or dbghelp.dll. Based on CallTraces, we see a pattern of ntdll.dll being used by\nvarious credential dumping utilities. If we add ntdll.dll to our current query we get the following results:\n\nWe now have a list of processes (source) targeting lsass.exe. Sometimes legitimate applications will request access to lsass.exe for\ncredential access, say to authenticate with AzureCLI or a software deployment application. What will differentiate these? This will be\nenvironment dependent based on roles and access associates may have, based on process hierarchy, or GrantedAccess. As we will dig into\nnext, filtering may be much easier once we combine GrantedAccess with CallTrace.\n\nNow we add GrantedAccess to our query to identify any patterns\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can see the permissions being requested by the SourceImage and we will begin looking at what those values mean next.\n\n### Detect Credential Dumping through LSASS access\n\nNow our second analytic is focused on GrantedAccess, which we explored earlier what the values are. Now that simulation is complete we\ncan begin digging in.\n\nThe base query looks like this with some simulated data\n```\n`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe (GrantedAccess=0x1010 OR GrantedAccess=0x1410)\n| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, SourceImage, SourceProcessId, TargetImage,\nTargetProcessId, EventCode, GrantedAccess\n| rename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`\n\n```\nWith all the simulation it was easy to spot the patterns between CallTrace and GrantedAccess, so we created a table to showcase these\nvalues:\n\n**GrantedAccess** **Process** **CallTrace**\n\n0x1010 mimikatz.exe C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll+221bd|C:\\Use\n\n0x1010 rundll32.exe C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll+221bd|UNKN\n\n0x1fffff rundll32.exe C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll+221bd|UNKN\n\n0x1410 rundll32.exe C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll+221bd|C:\\win\n\n0x1410 nanodump.x64.exe C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a5c84|C:\\Users\\ADMINI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\nanodump.x6\n\n0x1fffff procdump.exe C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+6cd1a|C:\\Windows\\Sy\n\n0x1fffff xordump.exe C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+6cd1a|C:\\Windows\\Sy\n\n\n-----\n\n0x1fffff outflank-dumpert.exe C:\\AtomicRedTeam\\atomics\\T1003.001\\bin\\Outflank-Dumpert.exe+1d32|C:\\AtomicRedTeam\\ato\n\n0x1410 createdump.exe C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll+221bd|C:\\Use\n\n0x1fffff createdump.exe C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+6cd1a|C:\\Windows\\Sy\n\n0x1010 Invoke-mimikatz C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll+221bd|UNKN\n\n0x1438 mimikatz.exe C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll+221bd|C:\\Use\n\n\n0x1410\nPasswordHashesView.exe\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll+a6144|C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll+221bd|C:\\Use\nx64\\PasswordHashesView.exe+cf2d|C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Downloads\\nirsoft\\passwordhashes\n\n\nWith all this testing, our updated Sysmon query combines the two analytics we set out to enhance by focusing on specific GrantedAccess\nrights and CallTrace DLLs. Will this catch everything? Probably not, but it will at least catch the majority of tools used and allow us to filter out\nknown good in environments and focus on the rare.\n```\n`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe GrantedAccess IN (\"0x01000\", \"0x1010\", \"0x1038\", \"0x40\", \"0x1400\", \"0x1fffff\",\n\"0x1410\", \"0x143a\", \"0x1438\", \"0x1000\") CallTrace IN (\"*dbgcore.dll*\", \"*dbghelp.dll*\", \"*ntdll.dll*\")| stats count min(_time) as\nfirstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer, TargetImage, GrantedAccess, SourceImage, SourceProcessId, SourceUser, TargetUser |\nrename Computer as dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`\n\n```\nThis will require some filtering as common system processes will access lsass.exe with GrantedAccess of 0x1400 and 0x1010.\n\nFor Mimikatz and the various items that come with it, whenever it does make contact with LSASS.exe the results are mostly the same.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs noted in our table of CallTrace and GrantedAccess, dependent upon what is being executed with the utility (MimiKatz for example) the\n[access will be different. This was also noted by Roberto Rodriguez here and Carlos Perez here.](https://cyberwardog.blogspot.com/2017/03/chronicles-of-threat-hunter-hunting-for_22.html)\n\nDoes this catch every variation of Mimikatz out there? Most likely not. However, it will be a great start to identify uncommon GrantedAccess\nrights to Lsass.exe. This may be expanded upon or converted to other utilities to assist with detecting suspicious LSASS access.\n\n## Additional Observations\n\nDuring our simulations we identified behaviors that may assist teams in identifying suspicious SourceUser accessing LSASS. Typically, we\nwill see source NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM and TargetUser NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM for normal system process behavior. However, seeing\nsource ATTACKRANGE\\administrator and Target NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM is suspicious.\n\nWhat if an adversary is already elevated? SourceUser will not be a user account, but NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. This may be a bit more\ndifficult to detect, but it’s worth a hunt.\n\nWith all this data we hope you found this informative and understand a bit of our continuous improvement for our content.\n\n## New Analytics\n\n### Windows Hunting System Account Targeting Lsass\n\nThe following hunting analytic identifies all processes requesting access into Lsass.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Windows Non-System Account Targeting Lsass\n\nThe following analytic identifies non SYSTEM accounts requesting access to lsass.exe.\n\n\n**Name** **Technique**\n**ID**\n\n\n**Tactic** **Description**\n\n\nWindows Hunting\n[System Account](https://splunkresearch.com/endpoint/windows_hunting_system_account_targeting_lsass/)\nTargeting Lsass\n\nWindows Non-System\n[Account Targeting](https://splunkresearch.com/endpoint/windows_non-system_account_targeting_lsass/)\nLsass\n\nWindows Possible\nCredential Dumping\n\n## References\n\n\nT1003.001 Credential\nAccess\n\nT1003.001 Credential\nAccess\n\nT1003.001 Credential\nAccess\n\n\nIdentifies all processes requesting access into Lsass.exe\n\nIdentifies non SYSTEM accounts requesting access to lsass.exe.\n\nThe following analytic is an enhanced version of two previous analytics that identifies\ncommon GrantedAccess permission requests and CallTrace DLLs in order to detect\ncredential dumping.\n\n\n-----\n\nPosted by\n\n**[Splunk Threat Research Team](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/author/secmrkt-research.html)**\n\nThe Splunk Threat Research Team is an active part of a customer’s overall defense strategy by enhancing Splunk security offerings with\nverified research and security content such as use cases, detection searches, and playbooks.
