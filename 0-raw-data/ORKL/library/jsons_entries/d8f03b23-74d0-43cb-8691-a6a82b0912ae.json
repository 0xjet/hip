    "plain_text": "# BlackMatter Under the Lens: An Emerging Ransomware Group Looking for Affiliates\n\n**[blog.cyble.com/2021/08/05/blackmatter-under-the-lens-an-emerging-ransomware-group-looking-for-affiliates/](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/08/05/blackmatter-under-the-lens-an-emerging-ransomware-group-looking-for-affiliates/)**\n\nAugust 5, 2021\n\nA new ransomware group is emerging on the darkweb, looking for affiliates to start its\noperations. This group calls itself BlackMatter and has posted ads on two cybercrime forums\nnamed Exploit[.]in, and XSS[.]is. The BlackMatter ransomware group is seeking\ncybercriminals already having access to the potential target’s networks. In RaaS, the\nransomware group creates ransomware and a platform to manage the possible targets and\nvictims.\n\n**Category** Surface Web\n\n**Risk Score** High\n\n**TLP Rating** White\n\n**APT Group** N/A\n\n**Threat Name** BlackMatter\n\n**Target** Firms with revenue of $100 Million and\n\nmore\n\n**Affected Region** United States of America, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain.\n\n\n**Threat**\n**Description**\n\n\nNew ransomware group looking for affiliates for ransomware\noperations.\n\n\nBlackMatter Threat Summary (Available to enterprise customers since July 21)\n\n## Technical Analysis:\n\nCyble Research Labs found the post on XSS[.]is by the threat actor named BlackMatter, as\nshown in Figure 1. In the post, the TA has mentioned the conditions required for affiliates to\njoin them, which are as follows:\n\nCorporate Networks should be from one of the following countries: the United States of\nAmerica, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain.\n\nThey are targeting all organizations except the medical industry and government\ninstitutions.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe revenue of the target organization should be more than $100 million and should be\nhaving 500-1500 hosts.\n\nThe networks on which other actors have already tried attacks are excluded from the\ntarget list.\n\nFigure 1 BlackMatter group posted an ad for affiliates posted on XSS.is\nThe TA has given two options for affiliation. The first option offers to buy network access for\nan amount ranging from $3k to $100k. In the second option, affiliates may work with the\ngroup in place of a percentage in ransom. Once the affiliates are selected, they need to\ndeposit $120,000 to the group to participate in their ransomware activity.\n\nThe TA has posted a similar threat post on another cybercrime forum named Exploit[.]in. The\nTA post is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 BlackMatter group posted an ad for affiliates posted on Exploit[.]in\nWe found that the leak website of the BlackMatter ransomware group is hosted in the TOR\nnetwork (Figure 3). The Home page shows buttons for media updates and contact. The\nHome page displays the message, “All blogs hidden for now. For a very short time.” It\nindicates that the group has started its operations.\n\nFigure 3: Home page of the BlackMatter Ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen we clicked on the button for media updates, we were redirected to the Media page, as\nshown in Figure 4. It also displays information such as excluded targets and messages to the\nmedia. Following is the list of excluded targets:\n\nHospitals.\nCritical infrastructure facilities (nuclear power plants, power plants, water treatment\nfacilities).\nOil and gas industry (pipelines, oil refineries).\nDefense industry.\nNon-profit companies.\nGovernment sector.\n\nReferring to the above list, we can say that the ransomware group is targeting private\norganizations so that they can continue their operations without getting media attention. We\ncan imply that attackers are aware of the consequences of compromising highly sensitive\ntargets. Based on rules and about us information given on the BlackMatter ransomware leak\nwebsite, we suspect that this group has close connections with the DarkSide ransomware\ngroup. We presume that the group is only interested in the money.\n\nFigure 4 Media page of the BlackMatter Ransomware group.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 shows the contact page of the BlackMatter Ransomware through which people can\ncontact the ransomware group.\n\nFigure 5 Contact page of the BlackMatter Ransomware.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe BlackMatter ransomware group tries to gain access to critical servers from other threat\nactors in order to launch its campaign. Organizations should perform security scanning and\nimmediate patching of known vulnerabilities using various processes such as Vulnerability\nAssessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT), Red teaming, and Purple teaming.\n\nCyble Research Labs is continuously monitoring BlackMatter activities. We will keep\ninforming our clients with recent updates about this campaign.\n\n## Our Recommendations:\n\nUse strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.\n\n\n-----\n\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other\nconnected devices wherever possible and pragmatic.\n\nUse a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected\ndevices, including PC, laptop, and mobile.\n\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their\nauthenticity.\n\n## About Us\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves](https://blog.cyble.com/)\nfrom cybercrimes and exposure in the Darkweb.
