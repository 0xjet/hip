We registered more than 50 domains, all in the form\n\n[[a-jm-r]{10}.com, and started investigating what we thought could be an unknown malware](https://www.debuggex.com/r/2jye7imBPjoZeJ-X)\nfamily.\n\nIn this post we'll go through a technical analysis of this unknown malware, describing how we\nwent from unknown DGA-like domains to sinkholing and emulating a fairly recent botnet that\nin the last 8 months has infected nearly 500,000 machines (2.2M unique IPs) in total, across\nat least 40 countries, and has a current estimated botnet size of around 50,000 machines.\n\n## Sample Discovery\n\n\n-----\n\nThe process of tracing back a domain to a specific malware sample that generates traffic can\nvary; It can sometimes be as easy as opening the first result on a Google search for the\ndomain, or as annoying as going through multiple search engines and ending on a Wayback\nMachine page that does not resolve. In this section we'll detail how we traced a sample for\nthis specific malware family, going from the domains and their traffic to a recent family\n[dubbed PseudoManuscrypt by Kaspersky.](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/publications/reports/2021/12/16/pseudomanuscrypt-a-mass-scale-spyware-attack-campaign/)\n\n[We were confident that we had registered DGA domains given the pattern and traffic of the](https://github.com/bitsight-research/threat_research/blob/main/pseudomanuscrypt/bitsight_owned_domains.txt)\ndomains. We also knew that the domains were generating UDP traffic on port 53 (Figure 1),\n[so we started by looking at communicating files from VirusTotal Intelligence (Figure 2) to get](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/jggrmmojcc.com/relations)\na better sense of the infection chain and hopefully reach a sample that would communicate\nwith our sinkholes.\n\n_Figure 1_\n\nOur first impression was that there were a lot of files generating traffic to the DGA (Figure 2)\nand that many were installers or archives that contained detections for multiple families,\nexplaining why our systems' classification was also reporting different families for the set of\ndomains.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2._\n\nThe large amount of bundled communicating files makes it harder to track down the exact\nsource of the traffic, so we went through some trial and error, sending multiple files to a\nsandbox and searching both for traffic to the DGA domains, as well as the uncommon UDP\n[traffic on port 53. While going through the sandbox's runs we found this sample, which](https://tria.ge/211109-qkrv3sfcg4)\ncontains UDP traffic on port 53 to toa.mygametoa[.]com. By searching for this domain on\n[Google, we found a fairly recent (by the time of the research) article from Kaspersky](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/publications/reports/2021/12/16/pseudomanuscrypt-a-mass-scale-spyware-attack-campaign/)\nmentioning a new malware family: PseudoManuscrypt.\n\nThe article's description of how PseudoManuscrypt is distributed and communicates with the\nC2 matches what we were seeing, and it filled the gap for some of our unknowns: the\n[uncommon UDP traffic we were seeing was actually KCP over UDP, and the kill chain that](https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp)\n[led to the communication was originating from a .dat and .dll file. Looking back at this](https://tria.ge/211109-qkrv3sfcg4)\nsample, we could see a call to rundll32.exe with a file ending in sqlite.dll. This file (together\nwith the .dat) was being downloaded by one of the bundled executables from\nt.gogamec[.]com (Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3._\n\nThe article gave us high confidence that we were seeing PseudoManuscrypt traffic to our\nsinkholes. There was, however, no mention of any Domain Generation Algorithm within the\nresearch.\n\n## Distribution and Execution Flow\n\nIn the previous section we found the malware family that was generating the traffic we were\nobserving, and we also identified one of the distribution methods. In this section we'll dig\nfurther into the distribution and execution flow of PseudoManuscrypt, enabling us to easily\nobtain recent samples of it, as well as giving us a starting point for a more in-depth analysis\nof the communication protocol.\n\n[We already know based on Kaspersky's work that there are multiple distribution methods for](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/publications/reports/2021/12/16/pseudomanuscrypt-a-mass-scale-spyware-attack-campaign/)\nthe PseudoManuscrypt family. For us it was obvious from the beginning that some of it is\ndone from within archive files containing many other malware families, like Socelars,\nSmokeloader or Redline (hence our DGA domains being incorrectly classified), but during\n[some parallel work we had on PrivateLoader, we noticed](https://www.bitsight.com/blog/tracking-privateloader-malware-distribution-service) [samples that included a hardcoded](https://tria.ge/220906-ajgqqahcak/behavioral1)\nURL to fetch the main PseudoManuscrypt executable (Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4._\n\nWe do not know the purpose of the hardcoded URL list that PrivateLoader has, since we\ndidn't see PrivateLoader samples fetching those URLs, but the presence of this URL hints at\nthe possibility of PrivateLoader distributing PseudoManuscrypt. At the time of writing the URL\nredirected to another domain (b.dxyzgame[.]com) that wasn't resolving to any IP, but in the\n[past it was dropping this executable.](https://tria.ge/220705-rmt9naaaen)\n\nBoth the previously mentioned executable and the executables bundled in the installers and\narchives show signs of being a dropper for the PseudoManuscrypt family. Their behavior\ncoincides with Kaspersky's description as well as with what we've seen, where the\nexecutable downloads 2 files from a domain that, as far as we've seen, always contains the\n\"game\" keyword (check IOCs for domain list).\n\nAs for the files that are downloaded:\n\nOne is a packed data file, usually pointed by the URI /X/sqlite.dat or X.html where we\nbelieve that X is the campaign number.\nThe other file is a 32-bit Windows library, pointed by the URI /sqlite.dll or login.html.\n\nMost recent droppers write both files to %APPDATA%\\Local\\Temp with the names sqlite.dll\nand sqlite.dat, and then run the following command:\n\n```\nrundll32.exe \"C:\\Users\\X\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\sqlite.dll\",global\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe global export will locate the file named sqlite.dat in the same directory, unpack it in\nmemory and then execute it (Figure 5). The unpacking algorithm includes a rolling XOR, and\na decompression routine. sqlite.dll runs the rolling XOR on sqlite.dat, and then jumps to the\nbeginning of it. The decrypted shellcode will then XOR and decompress a part of itself using\n[the LZNT1 algorithm. We've shared a Python script to unpack the .dat file here.](https://github.com/bitsight-research/threat_research/blob/main/pseudomanuscrypt/decrypt_dat.py)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5._\n\nThis execution flow would suggest that the DLL that is downloaded simply behaves as the\nunpacker for the packed core component. This claim is backed by the fact the unpacker DLL\nis always identical, whereas the packed core changes frequently.\n\nWe close this section with a better understanding of the distribution and execution flow of this\nfamily (Figure 6), and with easy access to the core component that will enable us to better\nunderstand the communication protocol.\n\n_Figure 6._\n\n## Sample Analysis\n\nIn this section we'll detail some of the analysis we did on the core component of\nPseudoManuscrypt. We won't detail every aspect of the sample, as our main focus was on\nunderstanding the basics of the communication protocol to create a custom sinkhole.\n\n### Hardcoded C2s and DGAs\n\nBy this point we had access to PseudoManuscrypt's core component, and our hypothesis\nwas that there was a main (possibly hardcoded) C2 domain (toa.mygametoa[.]com) and a\nfallback DGA that would trigger on specific conditions. To quickly test our hypothesis, we\nmanually ran the unpacker and the core, while also changing the hosts file to point\ntoa.mygametoa[.]com to 127.0.0.1. This triggered the DGA (Figure 7), confirming our\nhypothesis.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7._\n\nWe then started looking at the core component itself to find and reverse the DGA. Just by\nlooking at the strings contained in the core, we were able to identify two hardcoded C2s:\n\ntoa.mygametoa[.]com\ntob.mygametob[.]com\n\nBy looking for references to the hardcoded C2s, we identified that the client tries to connect\nto the first one, if it is not able to communicate with it, the infected machine will fallback to the\nDGA. As for the second hardcoded domain, our understanding is that it will be used only if\nthe C2 server instructs the client to use it.\n\nThe DGA uses the hardcoded C2 and a key as seeds. The algorithm is as follows (Figure 8):\n\n1. The domain and key variables are concatenated with a \",\"\n2. The string is MD5 hashed\n3. 8 bytes are retrieved from the hash, starting at index 4 and ending at position 12\n4. For the first 10 hexadecimal values of the retrieved bytes:\n\n1. If it's a number, 0x31 is added (outputs \"a\" to \"j\")\n2. If an uppercase letter, 0x2c is added (outputs \"m\" to \"r\")\n5. \".com\" is appended to the resulting string\n\nFor every call to the DGA algorithm, the previously generated domain is used as the first\nargument, while the second argument is always the same string. This makes the domains\ndependent on the previously generated domain, making a circular group of all possible\ndomains.\n\n[A Python implementation of this DGA is available here.](https://github.com/bitsight-research/threat_research/blob/main/pseudomanuscrypt/dga.py)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8._\n\nThe infected client will try to connect to each of the sequentially generated domains, and\neverytime it fails it will generate a new one.\n\nGiven the circular characteristics of the DGA and the small size of the domains, we\n[generated all possible domains for both the hardcoded C2s. Here you can see a list with all](https://github.com/bitsight-research/threat_research/blob/main/pseudomanuscrypt/toa.mygametoa.com_domains)\n[possible 585,723 unique domains for the toa.mygametoa[.]com C2, and here is a list with all](https://github.com/bitsight-research/threat_research/blob/main/pseudomanuscrypt/tob.mygametob.com_domains)\npossible 812,811 unique domains for the tob.mygametob[.]com C2.\n\nIn order to collect infection telemetry from infected machines, we needed to implement the\nprotocol the malware uses.\n\n### Communication protocol\n\nFrom Kaspersky's research and our own, we know that this family communicates using KCP\nover UDP, and TCP as a fallback. The KCP protocol has been designed as a replacement for\n[TCP, and its specification can be found on GitHub. PseudoManuscrypt's code of KCP is very](https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp/blob/master/README.en.md)\nsimilar to the linked repository, suggesting that they might be using that specific\nimplementation.\n\nAlthough the communication protocol uses UDP port 53 and TCP port 443, they implement\ntheir own messaging protocol. We focused on the first exchange between the client and the\nserver, which allowed us to map connections from the domains into infections, and also\nextract a lot of information about the infected machines.\n\nThis custom protocol can be divided into 2 layers. The first layer (L1) contains the message\nto be sent, while the second layer (L2) contains metadata about the message. Both layers\nare independent of each other.\n\n\n-----\n\nL2 has the following format:\n```\nStruct L2\n{\nBYTE header;\nBYTE compression_type;\nint32 L2_size;\nint32 L1_size;\nBYTE L1[L2_size - 10];\n}\n\n```\nWhere:\n\n`header` byte is always 0x43\n`compression_type` can be one of the following:\n\n0x0F -> no compression, no encryption\n0x1F -> no compression, L1 xored with 0x88\n0x2F -> zlib compression, no encryption\n0x3F -> zlib compression, then L1 xored with 0x88\n0x4F -> RtlCompressBuffer compression, no encryption\n0x5F -> RtlCompressBuffer compression then L1 xored with 0x88\n`L2_size` is the size of L2, which contains both the metadata and the compressed L1\n`L1_size` is the real size of L1\n`L1` is an array with L1 content\n\nThe L1 format will vary based on the type of received message. We believe that the generic\nformat is the following:\n\n```\nStruct L1\n\n```\n```\n{\n\n```\n```\nBYTE message_type;\n\n```\n```\n... varies based on message_type\n}\n\n```\n**First message**\n\nWhen the infected machine first communicates with the C2, it sends a lot of information\nabout the computer. In all samples we found, the `compression_type` was always 0x3F (zlib\ncompression, then 1-byte-xor with 0x88) for the L1 format. The following is what we believe\nis the L1 format for this initial message:\n```\nstruct L1_layer\n{\nBYTE message_type;\nBYTE padding1[3];\nint32 campaign;\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nchar client_id[33];\nBYTE padding2[3];\nint32 major_winver;\nint32 minor_winver;\nint32 build_number;\nint32 platform_id;\nint32 is_intel_amd;\nint32 is_running_wow64;\nint32 winserv_version; // Not working (always 0)\nint32 is_winserv;\nBYTE padding3[256];\nint16 number_of_proc;\nBYTE padding4[2];\nint32 proc_freq_mhz;\nint32 mem_size_mb;\nchar hostname[50];\nBYTE padding5[2];\nint32 ms_needed_to_connect;\nBYTE tbd2[100];\nwchar client_release_date[9];\nBYTE padding6[182];\nwchar client_version[9];\nBYTE padding7[22];\nint32 has_a_camera;\nchar internal_ip_port[94];\nint16 port;\nint32 tickcount;\nint32 pid;\nint32 sz_firmware_table;\nBYTE firmware_table[sz_firmware_table];\n}\n\n```\nMost of the fields are self-explanatory, we'd just like to detail that:\n\n`message_type` is 0x99 for this first message\n`paddingX` fields are always null\n`campaign` always matches the number that is seen in the URL from there the\nsqlite.dat was downloaded from\n`client_id` is the MD5 sum of the substructure containing the fields `sz_firmware_table`\nand `firmware_table`\n`client_release_date` and `client_version` are dates and are almost always the value,\nwith the exception that `client_version` has a `v` in the beginning.\n\n**First response**\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the server receives the first message, it can send various types of commands to\nexecute on the system, like: running a binary, clearing event logs, modifying registry keys,\netc. The C2 usually responds with a sleep command of 3600 seconds (`message_type`\n0x00), unless the `client_version` field in the first message isn't the most recent one, and if\nso the C2 replies with a \"binary update\" (`message_type` 0x01) command, and sends the\nmost recent version of PseudoManuscrypt's core.\n\nWe did not investigate the communication protocol any further, as at this point we had\nenough information to be able to identify and sinkhole PseudoManuscrypt infections.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the previous work we developed our own custom sinkhole for this family. We've been\ntracking it for over 8 months, seeing a daily botnet size of around 16,000 machines until the\nend of August, where a new version with a new C2 was pushed (consequently a new DGA)\nand the daily numbers dropped to around 7k.\n\nRoughly 5 days before the new version was pushed, we saw a sudden increase in infections\nthat peaked at around 51,500 unique client IDs (Figure 9). We hypothesize that the\nhardcoded C2 could have had an issue, making the bots fallback to the DGA, and\nconsequently communicate with our sinkhole.\n\n_Figure 9._\n\nAs PseudoManuscrypt seems to be a recent, but fairly large botnet, in a future post we'll\ndetail some insights about the telemetry we're getting from sinkholing the DGA domains.\nWe'll also detail the botnet's evolution and its bots.\n\n## IOCs\n\n[VT Graph](https://www.virustotal.com/graph/embed/gb050f716ba0e4782b0163e3ad5b37a639b2c0c893614442c948a640c4cf92077)\n\nsqlite.dll dd19804b5823cf2cab3afe4a386b427d9016e2673e82e0f030e4cff74ef73ce1\nsqlite.dat ecdfa028928da8df647ece7e7037bc4d492b82ff1870cc05cf982449f2c41786\n\n\n-----\n\ntoa.mygametoa[.]com\ntob.mygametob[.]com\n\nb.dxyzgame[.]com\n\n56.jpgamehome[.]com\n\ngp.gamebuy768[.]com\n\nv.xyzgamev[.]com\n\nc.xyzgamec[.]com\n\nxv.yxzgamen[.]com\n\ng.agametog[.]com\n\n## Get the Weekly Cybersecurity Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to get security news and industry ratings updates in your inbox.\n\nRead more\nBy checking this box, I consent to sharing this information with BitSight Technologies,\nInc. to receive email and phone communications for sales and marketing purposes as\n[described in our privacy policy.
