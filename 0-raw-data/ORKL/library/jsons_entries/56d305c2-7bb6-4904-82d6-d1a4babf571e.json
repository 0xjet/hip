A number of things lead us to believe the former is the more likely\nscenario.\n\nWherever we found the login page, once we’d analysed the IP addresses which used to\nhost it, we found even more SSO phishing pages.\n\nHere’s a few domains that we uncovered by following an IP chain that originated with the\nDolibarr panel:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nIt didn’t stop there. Once we’d set about mapping out the threat actors DNS infrastructure,\nwe discovered numerous other websites with the same portal attached to them:\n\nDomain - mail.getfoodz[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nDomain - lefmakeup[.]xyz\n\n## -sso and -okta domains targeting other companies\n\nThreat actors cast their nets far and wide. Social engineering is a numbers game - the more\nusers they can get in front of, the more chance they have of harvesting authentication data.\n\nThis particular threat actor also created phishing targeting other companies - Accenture,\nMicrosoft, Manpowergroup, Sykes, Telus, TTEC, iQor, and Rogers Communication.\n\nAfter we’d consolidated our results, a pattern started to emerge - all of the above\norganisations provide some sort of communication service (UCaaS, VOIP, messaging\netc.) and most of them facilitate a service that allows companies to communicate with their\ncustomer base, and vice versa.\n\nThis particular group of threat actors clearly think that online SSO portals are less likely to\nbe questioned than other forms of cloud-based authentication, and for good reason information is a commodity, and SSO login information commands top dollar.\n\nSome of the malicious -sso and -okta domains we discovered were hosted on infrastructure\n[also used by the ACTINIUM group within the same time frame - threat actors that the](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/02/04/actinium-targets-ukrainian-organizations/)\n[Ukrainian Government have publicly linked to the Russian Federal Security Service.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/02/04/actinium-targets-ukrainian-organizations/#:~:text=Since%20October%202021%2C%20ACTINIUM%20has,to%20Ukraine%20in%20a%20crisis.)\n\n\n-----\n\nTime overlap of campaign with Actinium group on the same infarstructure.\n\nWith the right security tools and search methodologies in place, threat sources aren’t\nparticularly difficult to uncover. As an example `sykes-sso[.]com is hosted on`\n```\n155.138.240[.]251 . The same IP that contains several subdomains of lotorgas[.]ru\n\n```\n- a well-known part of ACTINIUM’s DNS infrastructure.\n\nlotorgas[.]ru - part of the ACTINIUM threat feed\n\nTwilio was just one of many targeted organizations. There are numerous mini campaigns\nhere targeting different types of organization. Each category of target gives the attacker\npotential access to many other organizations. For example, one set of targets are Business\nProcess Outsourcing companies like Arise. Another is transactional email companies like\nSendgrid and Mailchimp.\n\nWe reveal some of the IOCs associated with these campaigns below. We are still tracking\nmore of this infrastructure in different categories of targeted organization. For a\ncomprehensive live feed, subscribe to the service.\n\n\n-----\n\n## How Silent Push helps companies prevent phishing attacks\n\nSilent Push’s proprietary scanning software maps out the Internet’s entire IPv4\ninfrastructure, every day - all 4,294,967,296 addresses - allowing us to provide an up-todate assessment of risk levels and malicious activity at any given time. We also re-resollve\nall DNS every day and make behavior attributes from the changes.\n\nWe have the most complete view of the entire internet every day and its changes.\n\nPublic DNS infrastructure gives you your first insight into all manner of attack vectors - not\njust SMS phishing and SSO spoofing.\n\nOrganizations need to monitor the larger extended attack surface for infrastructure targeting\nthem and take up-front blocking action on it to prevent attackers finding ways in.\n\nOur platform features a detection-focused analytics engine that provides organizations with\na top-down view of changes to their infrastructure, any domains of interest and critical DNS\nvariables - including NS and AS records - that keeps them one step ahead of threat actors,\nand ensures they don’t end up on the wrong end of a global news report.\n\nWe will provide you with daily threats that are targeting your organization.\n\n## Reference information\n\n**URLS with a compromised Dolibarr control panel**\n\n```\norderlyfashions[.]com\n\n```\n```\nmail.getfoodz[.]com\n\n```\n```\nlefmakeup[.]xyz\n\n```\n```\n*.orderlyfashions[.]com\n\n```\n```\n*.getfoodz[.]com\n\n```\n```\n*.lefmakeup[.]xyz\n\n```\n\n**Phishing domains related to the same control panel**\n\n```\ntwilio.okta-access[.]com\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.okta-teams[.]com\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.okta.com-helpdesk[.]id\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.okta.com-oauth2[.]id\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\ntwilio.okta.com-portal[.]id\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.okta.com-workspace[.]id\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.okta.com.globalchange[.]id\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.okta.com.online-procedure[.]id\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.okta.com.system-revamp[.]id\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.okta.system-revamp[.]id\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.oktaportals[.]com\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.oktaservice[.]com\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.oktasignin[.]com\n\n```\n```\ntwilio.oktaworkspace[.]com\n\n```\n```\nwww.twilio.okta.com-update[.]online\n\n```\n```\nwww.twilio.okta.com.globalchange[.]id\n\n```\n```\nwww.twilio.okta.com.online-procedure[.]id\n\n```\n```\nwww.twilio.okta.com.system-revamp[.]id\n\n```\n```\nwww.twilio.okta.system-revamp[.]id\n\n```\n\n**Phishing domains targeting other companies**\n\n```\naccenture-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\narise-okta[.]com\n\n```\n```\natt-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\nbandwith-okta[.]com\n\n```\n```\ncoin-base-okta[.]com\n\n```\n```\nconcentrix-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\niqor-duo[.]com\n\n```\n```\niqor-duo[.]net\n\n```\n```\niqor-sso[.]net\n\n```\n\nmailchimp-help[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nmanpowergroup-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\nmicrosoft-sso[.]net\n\n```\n```\nrogers-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\nrogers-help[.]net\n\n```\n```\nsitel-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\nsykes-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\nt-mobile-okta[.]net\n\n```\n```\nt-mobile-okta[.]org\n\n```\n```\nt-mobile-sso[.]net\n\n```\n```\nteleperformance-ssovcom\n\n```\n```\ntelus-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\ntmo-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\ntranscom-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\nttec-sso[.]com\n\n```\n```\ntwiiio-okta[.]com\n\n```\n```\ntwiiio-sso[.]com\n\n```\n\n**Linked IP addresses**\n\n```\n143.198.156[.]234\n\n```\n```\n146.190.42[.]89\n\n```\n```\n146.190.44[.]66\n\n```\n```\n147.182.201[.]149\n\n```\n```\n149.248.62[.]54\n\n```\n```\n155.138.240[.]251\n\n```\n```\n161.35.119[.]80\n\n```\n```\n164.92.122[.]3\n\n```\n```\n167.172.131[.]89\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n167.99.221[.]10\n\n```\n```\n45.32.212[.]77\n\n```\n```\n45.32.66[.]165\n\n```\n```\n45.63.39[.]151\n\n```\n```\n45.76.80[.]199\n\n```\n```\n66.42.91[.]138\n\n```\n```\n66.42.90[.]140\n\n```\n```\n185.173.37[.]140\n\n```\n```\n77.232.40[.]101\n\n```\n```\n185.244.181[.]186\n\n```\n```\n64.52.80[.]26\n\n```\n```\n45.61.136[.]168\n\n```\n```\n185.173.38[.]46\n\n```\n\nName\n*\nThank you!\n\n[The Team](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6081bc3c4920d358398731f8)\n\n\n-----",
