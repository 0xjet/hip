Published by McAfee in 2013, the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark)](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/phishing-threat-uses-utf-8-bom-in-zip-signature-to-evade-detection/)\nadditional bytes helped these malicious crews avoid detection.\n\nSince these campaigns depended on spear phishing to increase the victim count, the\nchallenge was to fool email scanners and use a seemingly corrupted file that lands in the\nvictim’s inbox.\n\nThe first indicator appears when the user tries to open the ZIP file with the default file\nexplorer and sees the following error:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe error message suggests the file is corrupt, but when we check its contents we see\nsomething strange in there.\n\nZip header prefixed by UTF-8 BOM\n\nInstead of having the normal ZIP header starting with the “PK” signature (0x504B), we have\nthree extra bytes (0xEFBBBF) that represent the Byte Order Mark (BOM) usually found\nwithin UTF-8 text files. Some tools will not recognize this file as being a ZIP archive format,\nbut will instead recognize it as an UTF-8 text file and fail to extract the malicious payload.\n\nHowever, utilities such as WinRAR and 7-Zip ignore this data and extract the content\ncorrectly. Once the user extracts the file with any of these utilities they can execute it and\ninfect the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file is successfully extracted by WinRAR\n\nThe malicious executable acts as a loader for the main payload which is embedded in the\nresource section.\n\nResource table showing the resource containing the encrypted data\n\nEncrypted DLL stored in resource section\n\nThe content stored inside the resource, encrypted with a XOR-based algorithm, is commonly\nseen in different malware samples from Brazil. The decrypted resource is a DLL that will load\nand execute the exported function “BICDAT”.\n\n\n-----\n\nCode used to load the extracted DLL and execute the exported function BICDAT\n\nThis library will then download a second stage payload which is a password-protected ZIP\nfile and encrypted with the same function as the embedded payload. After extracting all the\nfiles, the loader will then launch the main executable.\n\n\n-----\n\nCode executed by BICDAT function\n\n\n-----\n\nStrings related to Banking RAT malware\n\n[The final payload that’s delivered is a variant of a Banking RAT malware, which is currently](https://securelist.com/the-evolution-of-brazilian-malware/74325/#rat)\nwidespread in Brazil and Chile.\n\nKaspersky Lab products can extract and analyze compressed ZIP files containing the Byte\nOrder Mark without any problem.\n\n**Indicators of compromise**\n\n087b2d745bc21cb1ab7feb6d3284637d\n\n3f910715141a5bb01e082d7b940b3552\n\n60ce805287c359d58e9afd90c308fcc8\nc029b69a370e1f7b3145669f6e9399e5\n\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[RAT Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/rat-trojan/)\n[Spear phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/spear-phishing/)\n[Trojan Banker](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan-banker/)\n\nAuthors\n\n\n-----\n\nGReAT\n\nThe return of the BOM\n\nYour email address will not be published.

In this report we describe how the MoonBounce\nimplant works and how it is connected to APT41.\n\n### The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on\n\nIt appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to\nsolely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.\n\nSubscribe to our weekly e-mails\n\nThe hottest research right in your inbox\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
