    "plain_text": "# QBot Malware Detection: Old Dog New Tricks\n\n**[socprime.com/blog/qbot-malware-detection-old-dog-new-tricks/](https://socprime.com/blog/qbot-malware-detection-old-dog-new-tricks/)**\n\nAlla Yurchenko\n\nYou can’t teach an old dog new tricks. Yet, cybercriminals ignore common stereotypes,\n[updating QBot with new nefarious tricks to attack victims globally. This malware “veteran”](https://socprime.com/?s=QBot)\nemerged back in 2007, yet security researchers observe QBot being constantly updated to\nride the wave of malicious trends.\n\nFor instance, security researchers observe QBot maintainers increasingly abusing the\nLOLBin (Living Off the Land Binaries). Particularly, a common LOLBin is known as\nRegsvr32.exe: threat actors utilize this command-line utility to plant trojans like Lokibot and\nQBot in a victim’s system. This approach creates a lucrative environment for the operation’s\nsuccess, given that Regsvr32.exe is a tool used within multiple routine processes.\n\n## QBot Attacks\n\nQBot (QakBot, QuakBot, also Pinkslipbot) first surfaced in the late 2000s. For about 15\nyears, the trojan has been causing headaches, with the cybercrooks behind it faithfully\ncoming up with innovative ways of carrying out their malicious activity.\n\nOver the last few years, the [QBot malware has grown into a wide-ranging Windows malware](https://socprime.com/?s=QakBot)\nfamily, mostly utilized in phishing campaigns. It enables hackers to steal bank and Windows\ndomain credentials, infect other machines, and provide ransomware groups with remote\n\n\n-----\n\n[access. According to current data, QBot was employed as a delivery agent for ransomware](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/qbot/)\nto acquire initial access to corporate networks by such notorious gangs as REvil,\nPwndLocker, Egregor, ProLock, and MegaCortex.\n\n## QBot Infection Chain\n\nTypically, QBot infections stem from another malware infestation or, most commonly, a\nphishing attack. QBot targets devices running Windows, employing phishing emails as an\ninitial point of access and exploits vulnerabilities in a system’s default applications like\nMicrosoft’s email client, Outlook. Today, equipped with a module that reads email threads,\nhackers behind QBot have reached new heights in making bogus emails seem more\nlegitimate to their victims. QBot phishing attacks rely on a vast repertoire of lures, such as\nsham invoices, payment reminders, banking information, job offers, scanned documents,\nvirus detection warnings, and disturbing COVID-19 alerts, pushing a recipient to open the\ninfected file, enabling embedded macro code.\n\nIn the current campaigns, QBot operators deliver malicious Word, Excel, RTF, and composite\ndocuments. When a victim opens a document, it fuels the QBot infections’ spread. The initial\nQBot DLL loader is downloaded and the QBot process uses a Windows schedule task to\nelevate its level of access to the system. In as little as 30 minutes, the entire victim’s system\nis raided.\n\n## Preventing the QBot\n\nQBot has been on the cybersecurity radar for more than 15 years now, earning itself a\nnotorious rank of a seasoned malware old-timer, distributed via email. In the light of a\n[growing number of email phishing campaigns, Microsoft announced a default change for five](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/helping-users-stay-safe-blocking-internet-macros-by-default-in/ba-p/3071805)\nOffice applications that run macros, i.e., to block internet-obtained VBA macros, effective\nApril 2022.\n\nThe above solution will hopefully become a giant security leap for Windows-operated\n[devices.
