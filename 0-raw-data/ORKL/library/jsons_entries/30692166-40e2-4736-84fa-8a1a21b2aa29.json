While assisting the customer, we found a very interesting file in the system that is\ncompletely unrelated to China and contained no Chinese coding traces. At first look, it\npretends to be a Java related application but after a quick analysis, it was obvious this was\nsomething more than just a simple Java file. It was a targeted attack we are calling\n“Machete”.\n\n## What is “Machete”?\n\n\n-----\n\nMachete is a targeted attack campaign with Spanish speaking roots. We believe this\ncampaign started in 2010 and was renewed with an improved infrastructure in 2012. The\noperation may be still “active”.\n\nThe malware is capable of the following cyber-espionage operations:\n\nLogging keystrokes\nCapturing audio from the computer’s microphone\nCapturing screenshots\nCapturing geolocation data\nTaking photos from the computer’s web camera\nCopying files to a remote server\nCopying files to a special USB device if inserted\nHijjacking the clipboard and capturing information from the target machine\n\n## Targets of “Machete”\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of the victims are located in, Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Russia, Cuba, and\nSpain, among others. In some cases, such as Russia, the target appears to be an embassy\nfrom one of the countries of this list.\n\nTargets include high-level profiles, including intelligence services, military, embassies and\ngovernment institutions.\n\n## How does “Machete” operate?\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware is distributed via social engineering techniques, which includes spear-phishing\nemails and infections via Web by a fake Blog website. We have found no evidence of of\nexploits targeting zero-day vulnerabilities. Both the attackers and the victims appear to be\nSpanish-speaking.\n\nDuring this investigation, we also discovered many other the files installing this cyberespionage tool in what appears to be a dedicated a spear phishing campaign. These files\ndisplay a PowerPoint presentation that installs the malware on the target system once the file\nis opened. These are the names of the PowerPoint attachments:\n\nHermosa XXX.pps.rar\nSuntzu.rar\nEl arte de la guerra.rar\nHot brazilian XXX.rar\n\nThese files are in reality Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archives and have compilation dates\ngoing back to 2008.\n\nA consequence of the embedded Python code inside the executables is that these installers\ninclude all the necessary Python libraries as well as the PowerPoint file shown to the victim\nduring the installation. The result is extremely large files, over 3MB.\n\nHere are some screnshots of the mentioned files:\n\n\n-----\n\nA technical relevant fact about this campaign is the use of Python embedded into Windows\nexecutables of the malware. This is very unusual and does not have any advantage for the\nattackers except ease of coding. There is no multi-platform support as the code is heavily\nWindows-oriented (use of libraries). However, we discovered several clues that the attackers\nprepared the infrastructure for Mac OS X and Unix victims as well. In addition to Windows\ncomponents, we also found a mobile (Android) component.\n\nBoth attackers and victims speak Spanish natively, as we see it consistently in the source\ncode of the client side and in the Python code.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Web infections\n\nThe following code snippets were found into the HTML of websites used to infect victims:\n\nNote: Thanks to Tyler Hudak from Korelogic who noticed that the above HTML is copy\npasted from SET, The Social Engineering Toolkit\n(https://www.trustedsec.com/downloads/social-engineer-toolkit/).\n\nAlso the following link to one known infection artifact:\n\n_hxxp://name.domain.org/nickname/set/Signed_Update.jar_\n\n### Domains\n\nThe following are domains found during the infection campaign. Any communication with\nthem must be considered extremely suspicious\n\n\n-----\n\n_java.serveblog.net_\n_agaliarept.com_\n_frejabe.com_\n_grannegral.com_\n_plushbr.com_\n_xmailliwx.com_\n_blogwhereyou.com (sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab)_\n_grannegral.com (sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab)_\n\n### Infection artifacts\n\n**MD5** **Filename**\n\n61d33dc5b257a18eb6514e473c1495fe AwgXuBV31pGV.eXe\n\nb5ada760476ba9a815ca56f12a11d557 EL ARTE DE LA GUERRA.exe\n\nd6c112d951cb48cab37e5d7ebed2420b Hermosa XXX.rar\n\ndf2889df7ac209e7b696733aa6b52af5 Hermosa XXX.pps.rar\n\ne486eddffd13bed33e68d6d8d4052270 Hermosa XXX.pps.rar\n\ne9b2499b92279669a09fef798af7f45b Suntzu.rar\n\nf7e23b876fc887052ac8e2558f0d6c38 Hot Brazilian XXX.rar\n\nb26d1aec219ce45b2e80769368310471 Signed_Update.jar\n\n### Traces on infected machines\n\nCreates the file Java Update.lnk pointing to appdata/Jre6/java.exe\n\nMalware is installed in appdata/ MicroDes/\n\nRunning processes Creates Task Microsoft_up\n\n## Human part of “Machete”\n\n### Language\n\nThe first evidence is the language used, both for the victims and attackers, is Spanish.\n\nThe victims are all Spanish speaking according to the filenames of the stolen documents.\n\nThe language is also Spanish for the operators of the campaign, we can find all the server\nside code written in this language: reportes, ingresar, peso, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe “Machete” discovery shows there are many regional players in the world of targeted\nattacks. Unfortunately, such attacks became a part of the cyber arsenal of many nations\nlocated over the world. We can be sure there are other parallel targeted attacks running now\nin Latin America and other regions.\n\nKaspersky Lab products detect malicious samples related to this targeted attack as Trojan**Spy.Python.Ragua.**\n\n**_Note: A full analysis of the Machete attacks is available to the Kaspersky Intelligent_**\n**_[Services customers.
