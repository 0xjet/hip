After that first report, we recently\n[discovered an additional 50 files tied to spear-phishing emails that targeted 44 companies in](https://securityintelligence.com/events/webinar-new-global-phishing-campaign-targeting-the-covid-19-vaccine-cold-chain/)\n14 countries in Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Asia.\n\nThe expanded scope of precision targeting includes key organizations likely underpinning the\ntransport, warehousing, storage and ultimate distribution of vaccines. Spear-phishing\nattempts were associated with multiple executive activities and other roles, including:\n\nChief Executive Officers Global Sales Officers Purchasing Managers\n\nCompany Presidents System Administrators Sales Representatives\n\nDirectors of Finance Export Sales Managers Human Resource\nOfficers\n\n\nHeads of Marketing &\nCommunication\n\n\nHeads of Supply &\nLogistics\n\n\nHeads of Plant\nEngineering\n\n\nThe campaign impersonates an executive from Haier Biomedical, a major Chinese\nbiomedical company that is purported to be the world’s only complete cold chain provider.\nThe updated findings were made available via our Enterprise Intelligence Management\nplatform [TruSTAR in January 2021. In the same timeframe, X-Force reached out to relevant](https://station.trustar.co/constellation/reports/79103732-d7ef-4799-82be-849ad5e3d51b)\nCERTS and global entities in concert with our responsible disclosure policy.\n\n## Email Significance\n\nExploring the available emails, X-Force uncovered multiple features which likely signal the\nactor’s exceptional knowledge of the cold chain. While our previous reporting featured direct\ntargeting of supranational organizations, the energy and IT sectors across six nations, we\nbelieve this expansion to be consistent with the established attack pattern, and the campaign\nremains a deliberate and calculated threat.\n\nThe uncovered emails were sent between Sept. 7-9, several months in advance of the\napproval of any COVID-19 vaccine variant, which indicates the attacker was\nprepositioning in emerging global infrastructure.\nBoth the email subject and contents discuss requests for quotes regarding the Cold\nChain Equipment Optimization Platform (CCEOP) program and contain references to\nspecific products (a specific solar-powered vaccine refrigerator and ice-lined\nrefrigerator) from Haier Biomedical’s product line to store and transport vaccines at the\nsame temperatures of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe related HTML files mention organizations involved in the manufacturing of solar\npanels, as well as petrochemical production (dry ice as a primary byproduct), which\ndirectly aligns with the aforementioned products.\nThe English language in the email aligns with the educational background of the\nsender spoofed in the signature block.\n\n## Overlapping Infrastructure\n\n[Directly following our December publication, X-Force uncovered an additional spear-phishing](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/ibm-uncovers-global-phishing-covid-19-vaccine-cold-chain/)\nemail, remarkably similar to the original samples we found. The email was addressed to a\nGerman pharmaceutical and bioscience solutions company involved in vaccine production,\namong other specialties, who appears to be a client of one of the original targets we\nuncovered. This context to the initial targeted email prompted further investigation.\n\nThe connections between the previous and the new files we found feature overlapping\ncommand-and-control (C2) infrastructure, and appear to display the same blurred PDF with a\nlogin screen prepopulated with the user’s email address as the ID. Once a user ID and\npassword are keyed in, the credentials are sent to a C2 server. X-Force assesses that this\nactivity is aimed at obtaining user credentials for future or secondary attacks.\n\n## Most Targeted Industries\n\nThe potential targets, categorized into most targeted industries, may present various\navenues into the overall COVID-19 supply chain. They include:\n\n**Transportation — X-Force research suggests at least eight unique organizations within the**\nautomotive, aviation, maritime and transport services sectors across Italy, Korea, Japan,\nColombia and the United States may have been targeted.\n\n**Health care — Our findings indicate likely targets include organizations associated with**\nbiomedical research, medical manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and hygiene services and\nheadquartered in the Czech Republic, Germany and U.S. The corporations specialize in a\nvariety of disciplines including immunology, manufacturing of medical accessories,\nconstruction of surgical materials, the creation of pharmaceutical ingredients and online\npharmacies distributing COVID-19 rapid tests.\n\n**Information Technology & Electronics — A total of six organizations across Bulgaria,**\nFrance, Poland, Ukraine and the U.S. associated with web-hosting services, software\ndevelopment, IT operations and outsourcing and online platform providers were subject to\nactivity. Collection against these organizations could provide actors with insight into key\ntechnical requirements concerning the cold chain and vaccine storage.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to the sectors detailed above, notable clusters of uncovered email addresses\nwere found to be associated with government organizations, as well as refrigeration and\nmetal manufacturing technology. X-Force uncovered likely instances of activity directed\nagainst government ministries and departments in Europe, specifically supporting\nimport/export of special goods, transport and public health and safety. All addressees are\nspecific individuals of these organizations, including the precision targeting of (at the time of\nthe campaign) a major central European country’s department head of prevention.\n\nAs reported in the [X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2021, industries that governments](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence)\nworldwide have heavily relied on for COVID-19 response efforts were at the epicenter of\ntargeting during 2020, with attacks on manufacturing, energy and health care doubling from\nthe previous year. This serves as yet another reminder that organizations and industries on\nthe forefront of critical infrastructure and critical supply chains, such as the COVID-19 cold\nchain, are targets of high interest to adversaries.\n\n## What Are Attackers Likely Looking For?\n\nWith more than 350 logistics partners around the world, UNICEF and the COVID-19 vaccine\ncold chain will rely on seamless, multimodal transport systems to ensure that vaccines are\ntransported in a timely and safe manner around the world. Attackers could be looking to\ninfiltrate this extended supply chain to gain privileged insight into some of the following\naspects:\n\nPrivileged insight into national Advance Market Commitment (AMC) negotiations\nsurrounding the national procurement of vaccines.\nKey timetables for distribution, information regarding expedited passage of COVID-19\nvaccines through various nations and territories.\nExport controls and international property rights, government measures taken to\nfacilitate the time-sensitive cargo including pre-arrival processing.\nCollection or duplication of electronic submission of documents for pre-arrival\nprocessing.\nTransit and World Trade Organization (WTO) trade facilitation agreements, clearance\nfor transport crews and security of the cargo, border crossing regulations and physical\ninspections.\nKey technical requirements surrounding warehousing and energy/electrical component\nrequirements for maintaining temperature-controlled environments during vaccine\nstorage.\n\nWhile clear attribution remains presently unavailable, the rise of ‘vaccine nationalism’ and\nincreased global competition surrounding access to vaccines suggests the higher likelihood\nof a nation-state operation.\n\n## A Reminder to Stay Vigilant\n\n\n-----\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented race between rival nations on an\nunequal economic plane. It is almost inevitable to see this type of adversarial activity in a\nthreat landscape that is already extremely active on the nation-state attack front.\n\nAny disruption to the requisite conditions, including freight, storage and logistics, could result\nin impotent or unsafe vaccines, leading to devastating effects on global health security. A\nbetter understanding of espionage efforts that could result in actions against the supply chain\nraises the importance of staying vigilant and aware of the related risks and ramifications. For\nrecommendations on how to increase their cyber readiness, defenders can read our original\nresearch blog.\n\n[For more in-depth analysis surrounding this campaign, please access
