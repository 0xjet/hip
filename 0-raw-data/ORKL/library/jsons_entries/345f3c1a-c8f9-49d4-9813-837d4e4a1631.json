A significant amount of press reporting\nhas focused on the identification of the actor(s) involved, victim organizations, possible\ncampaign timeline, and potential impact. The US Government and cyber community have\nalso provided detailed information on how the campaign was likely conducted and some of\nthe malware used.\n\nMITRE’s ATT&CK team — with the assistance of contributors — has been mapping\ntechniques used by the actor group, referred to as UNC2452/Dark Halo by FireEye and\nVolexity respectively and more recently attributed to the existing APT29/Cozy Bear/The\nDukes threat group by Mandiant, and members of the US Intelligence Community, as well as\nSUNBURST, SUNSPOT, Raindrop, and TEARDROP malware. We have now published a\npoint release to ATT&CK, v8.2, with the information we’ve mapped and new techniques\nwe’ve spotted so far.\n\nIt’s also been difficult keeping up with all the reporting and updates while trying to track down\ndescriptions of adversary behavior, particularly as we’re looking for direct analysis of\nintrusion data rather than derivative reporting. We were originally listing reports we were\n[tracking in this blog post itself, but have moved our tracking to a GitHub repository and are](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/public-resources/blob/master/solorigate/README.md)\ncontinuing to update that in partnership with MITRE Engenuity’s Center for Threat-Informed\nDefense.\n\n\n-----\n\nA key challenge mapping current reporting is that the actor used a number of behaviors not\ncurrently described by ATT&CK Enterprise or Cloud techniques. We have added new\ntechniques, sub-techniques, and expansions of scope on existing content to improve this\ncoverage and wanted to describe what’s new in ATT&CK in v8.2.\n\n## UNC2452 Technique Analysis\n\n**First and foremost, we would like to thank the individuals and teams responsible for**\n**analyzing, publishing, and/or contributing invaluable information to help the**\n**community react and respond to this incident. This wealth of publicly available**\nintelligence has described many behaviors performed by the threat actor identified as\n_UNC2452/Dark Halo/SolarStorm. Mapping these behaviors to ATT&CK, we see a_\ncombination of very commonly used techniques (such as,, and ) as well others that are less\noften disclosed in public reporting (ex: ). You can see the techniques we currently have\nmapped in the ATT&CK Navigator [here, or grab the Navigator layer file from our repository](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/#layerURL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/public-resources/master/solorigate/UNC2452.json)\n[here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/public-resources/master/solorigate/UNC2452.json)\n\nTechniques used by UNC across multiple reports.\nSeveral behaviors were identified that weren’t previously explicitly captured within existing\ntechniques. We have now released updates that include:\n\n, such as includingUNC2452 and including them\n, such as the description being amended to include in Azure AD\n,such as those necessary to describe UNC2452 forging () and () via stolen secret keys\nand compromised signing certificates () and making ()\n\n## New Group/Software Entries\n\n\n-----\n\nAlong with new/updated techniques we have added several new group and software entries\nto ATT&CK including:\n\n, added as with associated group names of Solorigate, StellarParticle and Dark Halo.\n, including,,, and .\n, .\n\n## More to Come?\n\nWe don’t expect to add more content to ATT&CK itself before our next major release\n[(announced as planned for April 2021 in our recent State of the ATT&CK), but anticipate that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USDHmKiLNJM)\nmore reporting on this intrusion will continue to be released. We will be continuing to watch\n[and add reporting to our public report tracking, as well as any new techniques or software](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/public-resources/blob/master/solorigate/README.md)\nthat appear to the next release of ATT&CK.\n\nIf you see a technique we’re missing from existing reporting, a report with unique information\nthat we’re missing out on, or want to share a mapping of a new report you’ve done, please\nreach out to us at [attack@mitre.org.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:attack@mitre.org)\n\n\n-----\n\n©2020-2021 The MITRE Corporation.
