A\n[detailed analysis by Acronis reported that they also share some attacking techniques.](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/blog/posts/suncrypt-adopts-attacking-techniques-netwalker-and-maze-ransomware/)\n\nIn this blog post we dive further into the details of SunCrypt’s file encryption mechanism\nand discuss some unusual choices the authors made.\n\n## File Encryption\n\nSunCrypt uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography which is\ncommon in ransomware. The ChaCha20 stream cipher is used for the symmetric part:\nencrypting the victim’s files. Chacha20 supports both 128- and 256-bits keys, in this case\nthe 256-bit variant is used. A new symmetric key is generated at random for each file the\n\n\n-----\n\n[ransomware encrypts. The function RtlGenRandom, or SystemFunction036 is used to](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-rtlgenrandom)\ngenerate these keys. The nonce used by the ransomware is zero, but from a security\nperspective, this is not a problem here.\n\n[Acronis reported that the asymmetric encryption is done using RSA in two layers: a](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/blog/posts/suncrypt-adopts-attacking-techniques-netwalker-and-maze-ransomware/)\nrandomly generated session key used to encrypt symmetric keys and an embedded public\nkey to encrypt the session key. Upon closer inspection however, we concluded that\nSunCrypt uses the Curve25519 elliptic curve algorithm, and that it does not use session\nkeys.\n\nThe asymmetric part of the encryption scheme is based on the so called: Elliptic-Curve\nIntegrated Encryption Scheme, or ECIES. A public value is computed from the symmetric\nkey using the Curve25519 algorithm. This public value, often referred to as ‘R’, is stored\nwith the encrypted file. Combined with the master private key from the attackers, this\npublic value can be used to recover the correct key for the file decryption. For more details\non the ECIES scheme.\n\nAs the ransomware does not use session keys, the symmetric keys are encrypted using\nthe embedded public key. This public key is hardcoded. The screenshot below shows part\nof the SunCrypt code that performs the ECIES operations for a file, stores the R value\ndiscussed above as file extension and initializes the symmetric encryption algorithm. To\navoid leaking the key, it is erased in memory directly afterwards.\n\nSunCrypt encrypts a single block in every file, starting at the beginning. If the file is smaller\nthan 512 bytes, it is left untouched. If the file is smaller than 32 kilobytes, the entire file is\nencrypted and otherwise, the first 32 kilobytes are encrypted.\n\nRansomware commonly stores a block of information at the end of an encrypted file, called\na footer. This footer usually contains information for decryption, such as the original file\nname or size, and checksums for validating the decrypted content.\n\nA peculiar characteristic of SunCrypt is that encrypted files do not have such a footer,\nwhile the R value must be stored to facilitate decryption. The ransomware chooses to store\nthis value in the file extension of encrypted files instead. Therefore, every file has a\ndifferent, 64-character hexadecimal file extension. We have seen this referred to as a\n‘hash’ sometimes, but in the case of SunCrypt it is not a hash, but rather the ‘encrypted’\nkey for the file. Instead of checking the footer of a file that is already encrypted by\nSunCrypt, the ransomware checks whether the extension of a file on the victim’s system is\n\n\n-----\n\nexactly 64 characters long, and if so, leaves the file untouched. Moreover, the footer-less\napproach also implies that the file is rendered useless if its extension is changed. As no\nadditional information is stored with a file, we also found that SunCrypt does not provide\nintegrity checks for encrypted files. Even though this is not required for successful\ndecryption, corruption cannot be reliably detected.\n\n## Damage Control\n\n[Tesorion regularly contributes ransomware decryption tools to](https://www.tesorion.nl/en/posts/a-decryptor-for-the-nemty-ransomware-based-on-analysis-of-its-cryptography/) [NoMoreRansom. However,](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)\n[decryption of files is not always possible. Therefore, it is important to implement basic](https://www.tesorion.nl/en/posts/thunderx-ransomware-analysis-and-a-free-decryptor/)\nmeasures for securing your network. Think about offline backups, penetration testing and\nautomated detect & respond. However, these are just some examples of basic measures,\neach organization will demand specific measures. Would you like more information about\npossible measures that would fit your organization? Please feel free to contact us! We are\nhappy to help you improve security within your organization in a way that fits your\norganization best.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n - SHA256 of PowerShell loader:\n3090bff3d16b0b150444c3bfb196229ba0ab0b6b826fa306803de0192beddb80\n\n - SHA256 of SunCrypt PE file:\ne3dea10844aebc7d60ae330f2730b7ed9d18b5eec02ef9fd4a394660e82e2219\n\n[© 2022 Tesorion Cybersecurity Solutions.
