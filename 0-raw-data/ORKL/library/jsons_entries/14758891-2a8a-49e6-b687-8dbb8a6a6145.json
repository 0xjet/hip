That is why Kaspersky researchers**\n**monitor how APT groups refresh and update their toolsets. According to Kaspersky’s**\n**quarterly report, the threat landscape saw an increase in attacks against Microsoft**\n**Exchange servers in Q2 2021. In the latest APT 2021 Report, Kaspersky reveals the**\n**details of a unique long-standing operation, ‘GhostEmperor’, which uses Microsoft**\n**Exchange vulnerabilities to target high-profile victims with an advanced toolset and**\n**no affinity to any known threat actor.**\n\nGhostEmperor is a Chinese-speaking threat actor that has been discovered by Kaspersky\nresearchers. It mostly focuses on targets in Southeast Asia, including several governmental\nentities and telecoms companies.\n\nThis actor stands out because it uses a formerly unknown Windows kernel-mode rootkit.\nRootkits provide remote control access over the servers they target. Acting covertly, rootkits\nare notorious for hiding from investigators and security solutions. To bypass the Windows\nDriver Signature Enforcement mechanism, GhostEmperor uses a loading scheme involving\n\n\n-----\n\nthe component of an open-source project named Cheat Engine . This advanced toolset is\nunique and Kaspersky researchers see no affinity to already known threat actors. Kaspersky\nexperts have surmised that this toolset has been in use since at least July 2020.\n\n_“As detection and protection techniques evolve, so do APT actors. They typically refresh and_\n_update their toolsets. GhostEmperor is a clear example of how cybercriminals look for new_\n_techniques to use and new vulnerabilities to exploit. Using a previously unknown,_\n_sophisticated rootkit, they brought new problems to the already well-established trend of_\n_attacks against Microsoft Exchange servers,” comments David Emm, security expert at_\nKaspersky.\n\nBesides the growth of attacks against Microsoft Exchange servers, Kaspersky experts also\nhighlight the following trends on the APT landscape in Q2:\n\nThere has been a rise in APT threat actors leveraging exploits to gain an initial foothold\nin attacked networks – including the zero-days developed by the exploit developer\n‘Moses’ and those used in the PuzzleMaker, Pulse Secure attacks, and the Microsoft\nExchange server vulnerabilities\nAPT threat actors continue to invest in refreshing their toolsets: this includes not only\nthe inclusion of new platforms but also the use of additional languages, as seen by\nWildPressure’s macOS-supported Python malware\nWhile some of the supply-chain attacks were major and have attracted worldwide\nattention, Kaspersky experts also observed equally successful low-tech attacks, such\nas BountyGlad, CoughingDown, and the attack targeting Codecov, which signaled that\nlow-key campaigns still represent a significant threat to security\n\nTo learn more about GhostEmperor and other significant discoveries of the quarter, read the\n[APT trends report Q2 2021 on Securelist. The report summarizes the findings of Kaspersky’s](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2021/103517/)\nsubscriber-only threat intelligence reports, which also include Indicators of Compromise (IoC)\ndata and YARA rules to assist in forensics and malware hunting.

Kaspersky experts have analyzed 69\npopular third-party mobile applications designed to control connected cars and defined\nthe main threats drivers may face while using them. They found out that more than half\n(58%) of these applications use the vehicle owners’ credentials without asking for their\nconsent. On top of this, one in five of the applications have no contact information,\nwhich makes it impossible to report a problem.
