The main goal of this malware is to steal banking credentials from the victim’s\ndevice. It usually impersonates flash player updaters, android system tools, or other\nlegitimate applications. Once installed, it hides itself and then tricks the user into typing his or\nher credentials into fake bank web pages that have been injected onto the device’s screen.\n\nThe original code of BankBot was divulged on a Russian forum in late 2016, and you can\n[read more about that here.](https://blog.fortinet.com/2017/04/26/bankbot-the-prequel)\n\nOver the past few months, new strains of this infamous Android malware family have\nsurfaced in third-party APK markets, as well as in the official Google Play store. FortiGuard\nLabs decided to analyze some of them, and in this report, I will discuss its evolution over the\npast 10 months.\n\n## Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nIn most cases, the application poses as a Flash Player or some kind of Android System tool.\nUpon installation, it requires a very large number of permissions that look very suspicious.\nMoreover, from the Manifest we can see that the application is predisposed to ask for even\nmore permissions upon execution.\n\nFigure 1: Permissions\n\nIn addition, the classes in the .dex files are usually named using random words that are\nconnected in some way, as if they were picked in succession from a glossary. This is the only\nsort of obfuscation present in the application and it does not do a great job at it.\n\nFigure 2: Classes\n\n\n-----\n\nThis specific version of Bankbot has a relatively low detection rate, at around 15-20 hits on\nVirusTotal. This is in spite of the fact that it uses no obfuscation procedures to hide strings or\nfunctionalities.\n\nFigure 3: VirusTotal Detections\n\nFigure 4: Admin Request\n\nOnce installed, the application demands Device Admin privileges. In most cases, this request\nis accompanied by an explanation in Turkish, which suggests that Turkey is the targeted\nregion for this malware campaign.\n\nOnce these privileges have been obtained, the application hides by deleting its icon. It then\nsends device information to the CC server, such as like IMEI, contacts, and SMS messages\nsent and received.\n\nThe application also checks to see if any apps from Turkish financial institutions has been\ninstalled on the device. If so, it then displays a webview downloaded from the server of the\nspecific banking site spoofing-page.\n\nFigure 5: Set WebView Injection\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Bank Apps\n\nWhile the banking apps that we checked vary from sample to sample, this campaign seems\nto be primarily targeting Turkish financial institutions, with some Russian exceptions. It is\ninteresting to note that even when all of the applications are Turkish, the two apps checked in\nthe original version of BankBot (privatbank and ru.mw) never disappear. Apparently, the\nauthors of this campaign were over-excited with the Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V when copying and\npasting code from the original malware and did not think to clean the code before\nrepurposing it.\n\nIn fact, the code of this sample is very much similar to the code leaked in December 2016,\nwith very few modifications. The two biggest and most evident differences are: Firstly, the\ninjection technique supports more than the two test applications of the published tutorial. And\nsecond, it performs a check on all outgoing calls, comparing the number to a hardcoded list\nof numbers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Telephone Number List\n\nAfter a quick web search, it was easy to determine that all of these phone numbers it is\nsearching for are help-lines connected to a number of Turkish financial institutions. The\nauthor of the malware made sure to hardcode multiple ways in which a number could be\nformatted (with and without country code, and with and without multiple leading zeros).\n\nFigure 8: Numbers Format\n\nIf the number called by the victim corresponds to any number on the list, the application\nshuts down the call immediately by calling setResultData(null) on the broadcastReceiver.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Exit Call\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe BankBot family has never been famous for having advanced code. These new\ncampaigns that resurface from time to time tend to confirm that trend. However, this is not\nthe problem with this malware. The ease with which anyone can obtain and modify it to\ncreate an attack is the main reason why this family remains a real threat.\n\nThe samples analyzed for this blogpost ranged from 3 months to less than a week old,\nshowing that this malware family is still very much active and alive.\n\nThe CC servers used by this version of Bankbot are not obfuscated, and many of them were\ntaken down merely days after being set up. However, it seems that nearly every month a\nnew version of this campaign hits some new country. While it does not last long, it invariably\ncreates new victims. Over the past few months, we have detected more and more\nobfuscated versions of BankBot lurking in third-party APK stores as well as in the official\nGoogle Play store.\n\nOur customers are protected from this threat: Fortinet detects this malware as\n**Android/Bankbot.HH!tr and Android/Bankbot.AA!tr.**\n\nFortiGuard Labs has been monitoring this family since its first appearances in 2016, and will\ncontinue to track it and share its findings as new details come to light.\n-= FortiGuard Lion Team =\n## Appendix\n\n### Targeted Bank apps list\n\nru.sberbankmobile\n\nru.sberbank_sbbol\n\nru.alfabank.mobile.android\n\nru.alfabank.oavdo.amc\n\n\n-----\n\nru.mw\n\nua.privatbank.ap24\n\ncom.ziraat.ziraatmobil\n\ncom.ziraat.ziraattablet\n\ncom.tmobtech.halkbank\n\ncom.vakifbank.mobile\n\ncom.pozitron.vakifbank\n\ncom.akbank.android.apps.akbank_direkt\n\ncom.akbank.softotp\n\ncom.akbank.android.apps.akbank_direkt_tablet\n\ntr.com.sekerbilisim.mbank\n\ncom.teb\n\ncom.pozitron.iscep\n\ncom.softtech.isbankasi\n\ncom.ykb.android\n\ncom.ykb.androidtablet\n\ncom.tmob.denizbank\n\ncom.tmob.tabletdeniz\n\ncom.garanti.cepsubesi\n\nbiz.mobinex.android.apps.cep_sifrematik\n\ncom.htsu.hsbcpersonalbanking\n\ncom.ingbanktr.ingmobil\n\ncom.magiclick.odeabank\n\ncom.finansbank.mobile.cepsube\n\nfinansbank.enpara\n\n\n-----\n\ncom.pozitron.albarakaturk\n\ncom.kuveytturk.mobil\n\n## IOC\n\n### URLS\n\nhXXp://b1k51 dot gdn\n\nhXXp://b1j3aas dot life\n\nhXXp://wechaatt dot gdn\n\nhXXp://10as05 dot gdn\n\nhXXp://ch0ck4 dot life\n\nhXXp://fatur1s dot life\n\nhXXp://b5k31 dot gdn\n\nhXXp://erd0 dot gdn\n\nhXXp://b1v2a5 dot gdn\n\nhXXp://b1502b dot gdn\n\nhXXp://elsssee dot gdn\n\nhXXp://kvp41 dot life\n\nhXXp://servertestapi dot ltd\n\nhXXp://taxii dot gdn\n\nhXXp://p0w3r dot gdn\n\nhXXp://4r3a dot gdn\n\n### Hashes\n\ne5ac8b77e264c68a38be42bd16b1253b7cf96a1258444040ed6046c9096ecd08\n\n451b4cf00e36bf164b4e721d02eab366caf85690d243a539eba5a4bbd1f9e5fa\n\n48bd70850a04a26db239e47611ce7e660c2b08b2dd56d81ed7a608e2659e1d7c\n\n\n-----\n\n7960bb11e52516134774e8a262c6d78e5683ba9814015eb12b076e7d4e188c4b\n\nc5fbf3f7ddf354a99abbb7652254032d11682106d004373b509981c7a77d1bef\n\nf4db61ab1a314955e4134ec6fdcf9bd47ff8141928a1e467c052876327e4ef8b\n\nab27065953ff7329c261a27149e2ce63e9a170714df7619b011db89eb5f68069\n\n5126bd2a0e6b74178994c17102e4e18ffe1ab6f398a69225913f60eccef7a652\n\ne56acc1eedc47854c89a02b93ae5bd078e91001dd85e2c7739b649beddbee885\n\naa63ce659eb3054f00656b2a4fa4bbc14f421d7b2ccb99d333f619613d75fc8f\n\n20e838966993b73f2d65df993fb21d85ab186702a6b1732aba1ea3a98a79b22a\n\nf8de1e8ed70f77dd792035e0cdd3e5c026feece6790f6e2266f8d5f37198b8fa\n\n43c26e071d22e3e14efb669705ba9113067894e9035a051b76b3632330ef8884\n\nd7699cb3c4ec67f3cbe04701360da36622408b70b8d5ec413474d2a83b7172d9\n\na3ad2f7e3fc04db4e1c919f9df4235b8a1728ef4f4d2e5bb30905262719bbde5\n\n453ba4a1d229049b6bd415192cafda79238a4f2b1e4d1450174903284a304d33\n\nc59a2b3bdb8363d9610ed3bc5cd707ee25a2384e3e2e74bd1ad5bd16b69fa014\n\nee83ac9a851638f77693eea48ba8034c6d15e630ddb9ad19e204bfa3fe881dc6\n\n26827b3db72e07ab7649bb21b89dbb5376fcf76de1849ae41265965f80d5ecf7\n\n501e88a12be8fdba7d25472f08437308c313dd70aaeac4d162bbb6836ff4bc4a\n\n09e897341d910b44884a9e6d9d2f0bc39dcf2a50e0f35062b07c5f946e5c5b66\n\n876fa3268d5f15be13f9e6021133811062b90d6830f25b8b297be98f27d747f0\n\ne02112cf09522ee7231229dabf331bf725531945d56865416355211d45ddb849\n\n1ab4e5a08f4bf5f95b2462ee12da893851a715b5569603fb95d5f2f7bf2293de\n\n38b5f8c4ddcb2b53aaa33d19efdb6ea6e489aafa0e906da57345c3ca5f01ffa7\n\nc17cfc49391472ad0a85e0bde934bf289d1402c86cf8353ce5c9296c350a73d6\n\nef1ae5f0ed8a8216dda6ed2dec979e799bfd58fb548a8acb941407b950673ae9\n\ndb2d7ca6c1317e5697d0bc61f67bc38316888d20ee9dba32f7165bf23f177061\n\n\n-----\n\nfe26d6a0e3425d9622b2aef7c4199b0d9569f849453b12cb75ba42e5f002dd67\n\ne3b764ba2795af097efc554331bd9c8a804b5a030dfd495cc8169ce331ac5cad\n\n009220919c4ecf5e72f7be4886a454d11b951dbc488656a811cd7517ad4c0c35\n\n804fc95f250dc275e805fdabd862bcc3a2b60796915c3da575722015f64adf4e\n\n15d31751bd91ee0082f75f581f099e2f986a7c7ccc2748cdd8a0adf9320d748a\n\n8a8fe94c0e4f3fcaaf1f49aa27b13908c01a7574d31a84d55683f9cd1854d211\n\n27c4263d9030435a6f107878c0ba50998cf82d5852618b989acab9843df55d62\n\n39de72ff4b93565cd25fa303b8f17dcaabff101c138a0a5282c747d15b70053f\n\n31c33f8102669b5ffc117ebd076646cefb0ae6b7ea12d1779ebd9d64a2de70d3\n\nf532275eb109ffb5ef35ec42c5445b6e9cdaadad099c977aab8841664cdab292\n\nd2ffa12048169cf9eba113dbb47b78708e83d9b5e778276a40100617e0dbbbdc\n\n_[Sign up for weekly Fortinet FortiGuard Labs Threat Intelligence Briefs and stay on top of the](http://ftnt.net/2iT7Mcp%C2%A0)_\n_newest emerging threats._\n\n### Related Posts\n\nCopyright © 2022 Fortinet, Inc.
