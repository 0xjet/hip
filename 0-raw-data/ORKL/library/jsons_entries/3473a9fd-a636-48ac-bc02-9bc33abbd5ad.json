Security Intelligence Report (SIR) focuses on software\nvulnerabilities, software vulnerability exploits, malware, and unwanted software.\nPast reports and related resources are available for download at\n[www.microsoft.com/sir. We hope that readers find the data, insights, and](http://www.microsoft.com/sir)\nguidance provided in this report useful in helping them protect their\norganizations, software, and users.\n\n**Reporting period**\n\nThis volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report focuses on the first and\nsecond quarters of 2015, with trend data for the last several quarters presented\non a quarterly basis. Because vulnerability disclosures can be highly inconsistent\nfrom quarter to quarter and often occur disproportionately at certain times of\nthe year, statistics about vulnerability disclosures are presented on a half-yearly\nbasis.\n\nThroughout the report, half-yearly and quarterly time periods are referenced\nusing the nHyy or nQyy formats, in which yy indicates the calendar year and n\nindicates the half or quarter. For example, 1H15 represents the first half of 2015\n(January 1 through June 30), and 4Q14 represents the fourth quarter of 2014\n(October 1 through December 31). To avoid confusion, please note the reporting\nperiod or periods being referenced when considering the statistics in this report.\n\n**Conventions**\n\n[This report uses the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) naming](http://www.microsoft.com/mmpc)\nstandard for families and variants of malware. For information about this\nstandard, see “Appendix A: Threat naming conventions” on page 123. In this\nreport, any threat or group of threats that share a common unique base name is\nconsidered a family for the sake of presentation. This consideration includes\nthreats that may not otherwise be considered families according to common\nindustry practices, such as generic detections. For the purposes of this report, a\nthreat is defined as a malware or unwanted software family or variant that is\ndetected by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Foreword\n\nWelcome to Volume 19 of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report (SIR). I’ve\ncontributed to the SIR for almost ten years now. If I had to describe how the\nthreat landscape has changed during that time using only one word, I’d say it’s\n“cumulative.”\n\nTen years ago we reported on a range of threats that included trojans, worms,\ntrojan downloaders & droppers, exploits, bots (backdoor trojans), among\nothers. These types of threats were primarily motivated by a desire to disrupt\nnetworks, as worms did years earlier, or to seek profit.\n\nFast forward ten years and we still see the same categories of threats and even\nsome of the same threat families employed. During this time, attackers have had\nto evolve their tactics to get malware onto computers that have also been\nevolving with continuously elevating security levels. As vulnerabilities in\noperating systems have become harder to find and exploit, attackers have relied\nincreasingly on social engineering to compromise computer systems.\n\nIn addition to these types of attacks, we have seen more threat actors with\ndifferent motivations emerge over the years, including hacktivists and\npractitioners of military and economic espionage. Rogue security software or\nfake antivirus software that was used to trick people into installing malware and\ndisclosing credit card information to attackers has been replaced by\nransomware that seeks to extort victims by encrypting their data. Commercial\nexploit kits now dominate the list of top exploits we see trying to compromise\nunpatched computers, which means the exploits that computers are exposed to\non the Internet are professionally managed and constantly optimized at an\nincreasingly quick rate. Targeted attacks have become common as opposed to\nthe exception.\n\nAttackers continue to try to use the tactics that they did years ago, and have\nadded to their repertoire of dirty tricks. This is why I use the word “cumulative” to\ndescribe how things have changed. If I could use a second word to describe how\nthey have changed I would use “accelerated.” The focus and pace that some\nattackers have been demonstrating recently have certainly increased over time.\n\n\n-----\n\nNotice I didn’t use the word “advanced.” Although attackers have accumulated\nmore tricks and tactics and seem to be using them in a more focused, fastpaced way, they still focus on a relatively small number of ways to compromise\ncomputers, including:\n\n- Unpatched vulnerabilities\n\n- Misconfigured computers\n\n- Weak passwords\n\n- Social engineering\n\nThe great news if you are a CISO or security professional is that you’ve never\nhad so much information and so many security capabilities and tools as you do\ntoday to defend your organization’s data.\n\nPlease enjoy the report.\n\nTim Rains\nChief Security Advisor\nEnterprise Cybersecurity Group\nMicrosoft\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Featured intelligence\n\n**STRONTIUM: A profile of a persistent and motivated**\n**adversary .......................................................................................... 3**\n\n**Focus on Brazil: Win32/Banload and Banking Malware .. 21**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## STRONTIUM: A profile of a persistent and motivated adversary\n\nA research team at the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC)\nproactively monitors the threat landscape for emerging threats. Part of this job\ninvolves keeping tabs on targeted attack groups, which are often the first ones\nto introduce new exploits and techniques that are later used widely by other\nattackers. One such group, which Microsoft has code-named STRONTIUM, is of\nparticular interest because of its aggressive, persistent tactics and techniques,\nand its repeated use of new zero-day exploits to attack its targets. Microsoft is\nsharing some of the information it has gathered on this prominent attack group\nin the hope that it will raise awareness of the group’s activities and help\norganizations take immediate advantage of available mitigations that can\nsignificantly reduce the risks that they face from this and similar groups.\n\n**Adversary profile**\n\nSTRONTIUM has been active since at least 2007. Whereas most modern\nuntargeted malware is ultimately profit-oriented, STRONTIUM mainly seeks\nsensitive information. Its primary institutional targets have included government\nbodies, diplomatic institutions, and military forces and installations in NATO\nmember states and certain Eastern European countries. Additional targets have\nincluded journalists, political advisors, and organizations associated with political\nactivism in central Asia. STRONTIUM is Microsoft’s code name for this group,\nfollowing its internal practice of assigning chemical element names to activity\ngroups; other researchers have used code names such as APT28,[1] _Sednit,[2]_\n_Sofacy,[3] and Fancy Bear as labels for a group or groups that have displayed_\n\n1 _APT28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?, FireEye, Inc., October 14, 2014,_\n[https://www2.fireeye.com/apt28.html.](https://www2.fireeye.com/apt28.html)\n\n2 Loucif Kharouni et al., Operation Pawn Storm: Using Decoys to Evade Detection, Trend Micro, October 22,\n[2014, www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/pawn-storm-espionage-attacks-use-](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/pawn-storm-espionage-attacks-use-decoys-deliver-sednit)\n[decoys-deliver-sednit.](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/pawn-storm-espionage-attacks-use-decoys-deliver-sednit)\n\n3 _[Tactical Intelligence Bulletin: Sofacy Phishing, PwC, October 22, 2014, pwc.blogs.com/files/tactical-](http://pwc.blogs.com/files/tactical-intelligence-bulletin---sofacy-phishing-.pdf)_\n[intelligence-bulletin---sofacy-phishing-.pdf.](http://pwc.blogs.com/files/tactical-intelligence-bulletin---sofacy-phishing-.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nactivity similar to the activity observed from STRONTIUM. The group’s persistent\nuse of spear phishing tactics and access to previously undiscovered zero-day\nexploits have made it a highly resilient threat.\n\n**How STRONTIUM attacks a target**\n\nSTRONTIUM primarily uses two kinds of attack. It uses spear phishing—phishing\nattempts targeted at specific individuals—to perform reconnaissance and steal\n\n\n##### Whereas most\n modern untargeted\n malware is ultimately profit\n\nlogin credentials to gather information about potential highvalue targets associated with the institution under attack.\nFollowing the reconnaissance phase, it uses a variety of\nmethods to infect the computers of high-value targets with\nmalware, often by exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities\nin browser add-ons and other software.\n\nReconnaissance and target identification\n\n\n##### oriented, STRONTIUM typically begins its attack on an institution by\n\nidentifying and profiling potential victims with connections to\n\n##### STRONTIUM\n\nthe institution. Microsoft has seen indications that STRONTIUM\n\n##### mainly seeks relies on open-source intelligence (OSINT), such as email lists\n sensitive and information harvested from public forums or social\n\nnetworking sites, to identify targets for spear phishing. Microsoft\n\n##### information.\n\nalso believes that STRONTIUM relies on past successful phishing\nattacks to augment its dataset, by making use of any email\ncommunications it can identify between prior targets and the current target.\n\nSTRONTIUM casts a wide net with its reconnaissance activities, seeking login\ncredentials for email and other systems from a large number of people, which it\nthen weeds through to assess its value. Microsoft believes STRONTIUM used its\nspear phishing attacks to target several thousand individuals during the first half\nof 2015. Although STRONTIUM isn’t choosy with its targets, it is persistent. When\nSTRONTIUM identifies an individual to target, the group will repeatedly conduct\nspear phishing attacks against it over a long duration, possibly a year or more,\nuntil one of the attempts succeeds.\n\nSTRONTIUM’s spear phishing modus operandi focuses on making the recipient\nconcerned about unauthorized use of an account. A recent attack campaign\ninvolved sending messages with the subject line “Privacy alert” purporting to\noriginate from a well-known email service, informing the user that their account\n\n\n-----\n\nhas been accessed from an unrecognized device in a different country. Because\nthe targeted individuals are often professionals who have access to sensitive\ninformation, this can be an effective way to entice users to click a “change\npassword” link that actually leads to a webpage under the attacker’s control.\n\nFigure 1. An example of a credential-stealing spear phishing message sent by STRONTIUM\n\nTypically, the link will lead to a domain name that is similar to a legitimate\ndomain name used by the service in an effort to fool the user into thinking the\nmessage is legitimate. Figure 2 lists some examples.\n\nFigure 2. Examples of domain names spoofed by STRONTIUM in recent attacks\n\n**Legitimate domain name** **Spoofed domain name controlled by STRONTIUM**\n\naccounts.google.com accounts.g00qle.com\n\nus-mg6.mail.yahoo.com us-mg6mailyahoo.com\n\nprofile.live.com privacy-live.com\n\nmail.ukr.net mail-ukr.net\n\nwww.nato.int nato-news.com\n\nwww.bbc.com bbc-press.org\n\nwww.osce.org osce-press.com\n\nwww.eff.org electronicfrontierfoundation.org\n\nIf the attack is successful, STRONTIUM uses the captured credentials to access\nthe victim’s email account to identify additional targets and for additional\nanalysis and attacks. Even if the recipient doesn’t enter their login credentials\n\n|Legitimate domain name|Spoofed domain name controlled by STRONTIUM|\n|---|---|\n|accounts.google.com|accounts.g00qle.com|\n|us-mg6.mail.yahoo.com|us-mg6mailyahoo.com|\n|profile.live.com|privacy-live.com|\n|mail.ukr.net|mail-ukr.net|\n|www.nato.int|nato-news.com|\n|www.bbc.com|bbc-press.org|\n|www.osce.org|osce-press.com|\n|www.eff.org|electronicfrontierfoundation.org|\n\n\n-----\n\ninto the malicious webpage, the act of clicking the link can provide STRONTIUM\nwith valuable information. In addition to providing STRONTIUM with the\nrecipient’s IP address, clicking the link transmits a user-agent string to the web\nserver that typically includes details about the recipient’s browser and operating\nsystem versions, and sometimes includes information about the browser addons the recipient is using. This can provide STRONTIUM with insight into what\nsoftware is deployed in the organization, and possibly help it plan future driveby download activities.\n\nFigure 3. JavaScript is used to collect information about the visitor’s browser for drive-by download attacks\n\nAttacking the target\n\nThe ultimate goal of the reconnaissance phase is to compile a list of high-value\nindividuals who have information or access that STRONTIUM wants. With this list\nat hand, the group moves to the next phase of operations: installing malware on\n\n\n-----\n\nthe high-value targets’ computers, and thereby gaining access to the\ninstitution’s network.\n\nSTRONTIUM primarily uses email to deliver malware to targeted individuals,\nalthough some researchers have reported delivery through social networking\nchannels as well. Typical messages, such as the one shown in Figure 4, are tied\nto current events: an upcoming conference, for example, or a real world news\nevent in which the recipient might be interested. STRONTIUM’s email senders\nare usually associated with well-known email providers, and use plausibleseeming names and titles that are designed to give the messages credibility.\nDepending on the specific attack used, the message typically includes a link for\n“additional information,” which will launch a drive-by download or social\nengineering attack when clicked. Other messages include malicious attachments\ninstead of links, typically a document file containing an exploit.\n\nFigure 4. An example of a lure email message sent by STRONTIUM\n```\nSubject: Mission_In_Central_African_Republic\n*Dear Sir!*\nPlease be advised that The Spanish Army personnel and a large number of the\nSpanish Guardia Civil officers\ncurrently deployed in the Central African Republic (CAR) as part of the\nEuropean EUFOR RCA mission will return\nto Spain in early March as the mission draws to a close.\nVisit\nhttp://eurasiaglobalnews.com/YYY-spains-armed-forces-conclude-mission-centralafrican-republic/\nfor the addition info.\n*Best regards,*\n*Capt. John Smith, Defence Adviser, Public Diplomacy Division NATO,\nBrussels defence.adviser.smith@gmail.com <defence.adviser.smith@gmail.com>*\n\n```\nLittle is known about how and what information STRONTIUM gathers to tailor its\nattacks to specific high-value individuals. As discussed earlier, the user-agent\nand potential fingerprinting information gathered from phishing victims may\nplay a part in planning the individual attacks by giving the group insight into\nwhat software may be in widespread use within the institution. In general,\n\n\n-----\n\nSTRONTIUM can take advantage of a variety of attacks that span general tactics\nand cover a wide range of technologies, including zero-day exploits.\n\nZero-day exploits—exploits that target vulnerabilities for which the affected\nsoftware vendor has not yet released a security update—form a significant part\nof STRONTIUM’s arsenal. It is not yet clear whether the group researches\nvulnerabilities and develops the exploits themselves, or purchases them on the\nblack market.\n\nMicrosoft researchers have observed STRONTIUM moving swiftly to take\n\n\n##### Zero-day exploits\n form a significant\n part of STRONTIUM’s\n arsenal.\n\n\nadvantage of newly disclosed vulnerabilities; notably, the group\ndeployed a number of zero-day exploits disclosed in a July 2015\nleak of information from the security company Hacking Team. In\nother cases, STRONTIUM deployed exploits within days of a\nvendor releasing a security update that addressed the\nassociated vulnerability, relying on the fact that not everyone\ninstalls security updates immediately after they are published.\n\n\nThe exploits used by STRONTIUM include a wide range of\nproducts from multiple vendors, including Adobe Flash Player, the Oracle Java\nRuntime Environment (JRE), Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer, and some\ncomponents of the Windows kernel. Figure 5 lists some of the exploits used by\nSTRONTIUM in recent campaigns, including a number of zero-day exploits\n(shaded). All of the vulnerabilities listed in Figure 5 were quickly addressed by\nsecurity updates as part of the vendors’ rapid response processes. (See\n“Guidance” on page 16 for information about how organizations can use up-todate software to defend against targeted attacks.)\n\nFigure 5. Some of the exploits used by STRONTIUM in attack campaigns in 2014 and 2015\n\n\n**Security feature**\n\n**bypass**\n\n\n**Social engineering-**\n\n**based attack**\n\n|Col1|Java CVE-2015-4902 (0-day)|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n|Col1|Firefox Bootstrapped Add-on (XPI)|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n|Col1|Microsoft Word CVE-2015-2424 (0-day)|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n|Col1|ATMFD CVE-2015-2387 (0-day)|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n|Col1|Internet Explorer CVE-2014-1776 CVE-2014-6332 CVE-2014-3897|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to using zero-day exploits, STRONTIUM also makes use of exploits\nthat target older vulnerabilities for which security updates have been available\nfor a long time. Microsoft believes that in some cases, the group learns during\nthe reconnaissance phase that the targeted institution may be exposed to risks\nby running older or out-of-support platforms and software, by not testing and\napplying security updates quickly, or by not taking advantage of the latest\nmitigations and defense mechanisms shipped with more recent product\nversions—and then acts accordingly.\n\nIn a development observed in October 2015, the shellcode that executes after a\nsuccessful memory corruption exploit displayed a number of characteristics that\nresearchers had not observed from the malware previously:\n\n- API resolution: ROR 0x0D hashing, resolution made just before using the API\n\n- Downloader: usage of HttpQueryInfo and WININET to fetch remote\npayloads in memory\n\n- Compression: usage of ntdll!RtlDecompressBuffer()LZNT1 compression for\nremote payloads\n\n- Privilege escalation: executed as DLL, but in-memory (diskless)\n\nFigure 6. In-memory decompression and execution of remote payloads performed by STRONTIUM shellcode\n\nIn addition to relying on exploits, STRONTIUM also uses social engineering to\ntrick victims into installing malware. Since March of 2015, for example, Microsoft\nhas observed STRONTIUM successfully compromising Mozilla Firefox users by\nconvincing them to install a malicious browser add-on based on a publicly\navailable module (“Bootstrapped Addon Social Engineering Code Execution”)\ndeveloped for the Metasploit security testing framework.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. STRONTIUM installs malware via a malicious bootstrapped add-on in Mozilla Firefox\n\n**Establishing control**\n\nAfter gaining administrative privileges on the computer through an exploit or\nsocial engineering, STRONTIUM uses a dropper to deploy a backdoor\ncomponent, CORESHELL, which eventually downloads other modules.\n(Microsoft products sometimes detect the primary components as variants in\n[the Win32/Foosace family, although the group has used other malware in the](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Foosace)\npast.) The DLL backdoor is installed via execution of rundll32 with an export\nnamed “init” or “InitW.” The dropper deletes itself after execution, while the DLL\nbackdoor and any additional components are typically copied under the\nfollowing folders:\n\n       - C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\MSInfo\\\n\n       - C:\\Users\\<user name>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft Help\\\n\n       - C:\\ProgramData\\\n\nThe dropper also writes the command and control (C&C) configuration\ninformation to the registry or an encrypted file. This strategy complicates\nforensic discovery of the attacker’s infrastructure if the backdoor DLL is\ndiscovered, because the configuration information must be located separately.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Command & control configuration locations used by STRONTIUM\n\n**Format** **Path**\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\nRegistry\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\<path>\n\nFile (Windows XP) %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\msd\n\nFile (other Windows) %PROGRAMDATA%\\msd\n\nSTRONTIUM ensures that its backdoor will run every time the computer starts by\ncreating autostart extensibility point (ASEP) registry entries and shortcuts, which\ndiffer depending on what the attacker has chosen for the victim and which\nbackdoor variant is used. (See “Advanced Malware Cleaning Techniques for the\n[IT Professional” on page 96 of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 11](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=27605)\n_[(January–June 2011), available from the Microsoft Download Center, for](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=27605)_\nguidance on using Sysinternals tools to monitor ASEPs for signs of malware\ninfection.)

The tool lists within each category are quite extensive and\nthe distribution is actively maintained, so that STRONTIUM can always take\nadvantage of the latest open-source tools. STRONTIUM does not deploy this\nLinux distribution on an existing computer that belongs to the targeted\ninstitution; rather, it uses a VPN connection to join one of its own Kali Linux\ncomputers to the victim’s network, possibly using the tunnel component that\nwas previously deployed. This approach allows STRONTIUM to only ephemerally\nexpose its toolset to the victim’s network.\n\n**Guidance**\n\nSTRONTIUM is a very challenging adversary for a targeted institution to defend\nagainst: it possesses a broad range of technical exploitation capabilities,\nsignificant access to resources such as previously undiscovered zero-day\nexploits, and the determination to keep up an attack for months or years until it\nsucceeds.

(Encounter rates for these related threats are generally much lower than\nfor Banload, in part because Microsoft real-time security products block Banload\nvariants before they can download additional malware; therefore, examining\nBanload encounter rates is a useful proxy for understanding\nthe banking malware problem in general.)

Over the past six quarters the encounter rate for\nBanload in Brazil has fluctuated between 1.0 percent and 2.1 percent, while the\nworldwide Banload encounter rate has ranged between 0.06 percent and 0.11\npercent. Despite a generally rising trend that accelerated in 2Q15, the\nfluctuations shown in Figure 18 are fairly typical for Banload and do not\nnecessarily presage significantly increased encounter rates in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18.

Most variants\noperate in similar ways. Banload might be installed by other malware, or use\nsocial engineering to trick the user into launching it. After it is installed, it\ncontacts a remote host and downloads additional files, which then attempt to\nsteal banking credentials and transmit them back to the attacker. Banload\nvariants have been observed to connect to many different\nremote hosts, including malicious sites as well as legitimate Many Banload\nsites that have been compromised. As with many other variants attempt to\nmalware families, the hosts are not confined to any particular\n\n##### disable security\n\nregion; attackers typically establish malicious hosts wherever\na vulnerable server can be found to compromise. products installed\n\n##### on the computer.\n\nSome Banload variants check the configured system\nlanguage upon installation and only download additional\nfiles if it is set to Portuguese. Although Banload usually does not attempt to steal\nbanking credentials itself, many variants transmit other details about the\ncomputer environment to the attacker, such as the computer name, user name,\nand Windows version.\n\n\n-----\n\nMany Banload variants attempt to disable security products installed on the\ncomputer, including G-Buster Browser Defense, a browser add-on that many\nlarge Brazilian banks provide to their customers to protect banking sessions\nfrom malware. Some variants modify the registry so that Banload will\nautomatically launch each time the computer is started.\n\nWin32/Banker and credential stealers\n\nThe malware threats downloaded by Banload variants are often detected as\n[Win32/Banker and Win32/Bancos. Banker and Bancos are generic detections for](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Banker)\ndata-stealing trojans that capture online banking credentials, such as account\nnames and passwords, and relay the captured information to a remote attacker.\nAs with Banload, these threats are created by many different people who often\nhave no connection to each other apart from their common purpose of stealing\nbanking credentials. Banker and Bancos variants typically monitor browser\nactivity for banking sessions involving large and well-known Brazilian banks,\nincluding:\n\n- Banco Bradesco (bradesco.com.br)\n\n- Banco do Brasil (bb.com.br)\n\n- Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (banrisul.com.br)\n\n- Banco Itaú (itau.com.br)\n\n- Banco Safra (safra.com.br)\n\n- Banco Santander (santander.com.br)\n\n- Caixa Econômica Federal (caixa.gov.br)\n\n- Citibank (citibank.com.br)\n\n- HSBC (hsbc.com.br)\n\nAs with Banload, many Banker and Bancos variants attempt to disable security\nproducts installed on the computer, including G-Buster Browser Defense, and\nmodify the registry so the malware will automatically launch each time the\ncomputer is started.\n\nWin32/BrobanDel and boleto malware\n\nAnother type of banking malware that has affected Brazil recently targets\n_boletos bancários, a popular payment method there. A boleto bancário, usually_\nsimply called a boleto, is a payment order generated by a merchant or other\n\n\n-----\n\npayee, similar to an invoice. Boletos are popular in Brazil because they provide a\nmechanism for people to pay bills or other debts without having a bank\naccount; they can be paid in cash at a wide range of locations, including banks,\npost offices, and supermarkets. In recent years, online boletos have become\npopular: payers receive them over the Internet and can either pay them\nelectronically from a bank account or can print them out for payment like\nconventional paper boletos. It is these online boletos that have been targeted\nby a new type of banking malware.\n\nFigure 19. An example of a boleto bancário, a popular method of payment in Brazil\n\nEvery boleto has a unique identification number that specifies the bank, payee,\nand amount to be paid, among other information. The identification number is\nprinted at the top of the boleto and encoded as a barcode at the bottom. A\n[typical boleto malware variant (often detected as Win32/BrobanDel) installs itself](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/BrobanDel)\nas a browser add-on and monitors webpages for patterns that match a boleto.\nWhen it identifies a boleto, it alters the identification number so that when the\nrecipient pays it, the money will be paid into an account controlled by the\nattacker, rather than the payee’s account. The malware may re-encode the\nbarcode to match the altered number, or simply corrupt it so that it cannot be\noptically scanned, requiring the cashier to enter the identification number by\nhand.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. A malicious extension installed by Win32/BrobanDel to detect and alter boletos\n\nNew variants of Banload and the other families discussed in this section are\ndiscovered every day, and variants discovered in the future may exhibit different\nbehaviors than those described here.

The CVSS base metric\nassigns a numeric value between 0 and 10 to vulnerabilities according to\n[severity, with higher scores representing greater severity. (See A Complete](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v2-guide.pdf)\n[Guide to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2.0 at first.org for](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v2-guide.pdf)\nmore information.)\n\nFigure 22.

A research project in 2H14 uncovered\nSSL vulnerabilities in a large number of Android apps in the Google Play\nstore, explaining the rise and subsequent fall of medium-severity\nvulnerabilities. (See page 32 for more information about this project.)\n\n- By contrast, the number of disclosures of high-severity and low-severity\nvulnerabilities remained mostly stable, with both categories increasing by\nless than 2 percent from 1H14 to 2H14. High-severity vulnerabilities\naccounted for the second-highest share of vulnerability disclosures in 1H15,\nat 32.5 percent, and low-severity vulnerabilities accounted for the smallest\nshare, at 10.4 percent.\n\n\n-----\n\n- As shown in Figure 23, the highest-severity vulnerabilities—those scoring\n9.9 or higher on the CVSS scale—accounted for 7.6 percent of all\nvulnerabilities in 1H15.\n\nFigure 23.

A high-severity vulnerability that can only\nbe exploited under very specific and rare circumstances might require less\nimmediate attention than a lower-severity vulnerability that can be exploited\nmore easily.\n\nThe CVSS assigns each vulnerability a complexity ranking of Low, Medium, or\n[High.

This determination is not always simple and\nstraightforward, given the componentized nature of modern operating systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome programs (media players, for example) ship by default with some\noperating system software but can also be downloaded from the software\nvendor’s website and installed individually. Linux distributions, in particular, are\noften assembled from components developed by different teams, many of\nwhich provide crucial operating functions such as a graphical user interface\n(GUI) or Internet browsing.\n\nTo facilitate analysis of operating system and browser vulnerabilities, the\n_Microsoft Security Intelligence Report distinguishes among four different kinds of_\nvulnerabilities:\n\n- _Core operating system vulnerabilities are those with at least one operating_\nsystem platform enumeration (“/o”) in the NVD that do not also have any\napplication platform enumerations (“/a”).[12]\n\n- _Operating system application vulnerabilities are those with at least one /o_\nplatform enumeration and at least one /a platform enumeration listed in the\nNVD, except as described in the next bullet point.\n\n- _Browser vulnerabilities are those that affect components defined as part of a_\nweb browser, including web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Apple’s\nSafari that ship with operating systems, along with third-party browsers such\nas Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\n- _Other application vulnerabilities are those with at least one /a platform_\nenumeration in the NVD that do not have any /o platform enumerations,\nexcept as described in the previous bullet point.\n\nFigure 25 shows industrywide vulnerabilities for operating systems, browsers,\nand applications since 2H12.\n\n[12 See nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm for information about the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) standard for](http://nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm)\nnaming information technology systems, software, and packages.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25.

Exploits target vulnerabilities in operating systems, web browsers, applications, or software components that are installed on a computer. \n\nIn some scenarios, targeted components are add-ons that may be pre-installed\nby the computer manufacturer before the computer is sold. A user may not\neven use the vulnerable add-on or be aware that it is installed. In addition, some\nsoftware has no facility for updating itself, so even if the software vendor\npublishes an update that fixes the vulnerability, the user may not know that the\nupdate is available or how to obtain it and therefore remains vulnerable to\nattack.[13]\n\n\n##### Encounter rate is the percentage of computers running Microsoft real-time\n security products that report a mal\n\nSoftware vulnerabilities are enumerated and documented in the\n[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list (cve.mitre.org),](http://cve.mitre.org/)\na standardized repository of vulnerability information.

However, the statistics presented in this report\nshould not be interpreted as evidence of successful exploit attempts, or of the\nrelative vulnerability of computers to different exploits.\n\nFigure 27 shows the prevalence of different types of exploits detected by\nMicrosoft antimalware products from 3Q14 to 2Q15, by encounter rate.\n_Encounter rate is the percentage of computers running Microsoft real-time_\nsecurity products that report a malware encounter. For example, the encounter\nrate for Java exploit attempts in 2Q15 was 0.35 percent, meaning that 0.35\npercent of computers running Microsoft real-time security software in 2Q15\nencountered Java exploit attempts, and 99.65 percent did not. In other words, a\ncomputer selected at random would have had about a 0.35 percent chance of\nencountering a Java exploit attempt in 2Q15. Only computers whose users have\nopted in to provide data to Microsoft are considered when calculating\nencounter rates.[15] See page 58 for more information about the encounter rate\nmetric.\n\nFigure 27.

This decrease is likely caused by several important changes in the way\nweb browsers evaluate and execute Java applets:\n\n  - The IExtensionValidation interface in Internet Explorer 11, released in late\n\n\n##### IExtensionValidation in Internet Explorer\n 11 provides a mechanism for se curity software to\n validate that a webpage is safe\n before allowing\n instantiation of ActiveX controls.\n\n\n2013, provides a mechanism for security software to validate\n\nthat a webpage is safe before allowing instantiation of ActiveX\n\ncontrols, such as the control that hosts embedded Java applets.\n\nIf a webpage is determined to be malicious, the ActiveX controls\n\nare blocked from loading, and the actual Java exploit itself is\n\ntherefore never encountered. (See “Exploit detection with\n\nInternet Explorer and IExtensionValidation” on page 55 for more\n\ninformation.) Subsequent Internet Explorer security updates\n\nreleased in 2014 added an isolated heap mechanism and a\n\ndeferred-free method to mitigate use-after-free bugs, which\n\nfurther hardened Internet Explorer against Java exploitation.\n\n- Beginning with Java 7 update 51, released in January\n\n2014, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) requires Java applets\n\nrunning in web browsers to be digitally signed by default.\n\n\n\n         - In September 2014, Microsoft published updates for versions 8 through\n\n[11 of Internet Explorer to begin blocking out-of-date ActiveX controls,](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/08/06/internet-explorer-begins-blocking-out-of-date-activex-controls.aspx)\n\nincluding controls that host older versions of the JRE in the browser. As\n\nexplained in this section, the most commonly encountered Java exploits\n\nall target vulnerabilities that were addressed with security updates years\n\nago, but remain present in out-of-date Java installations. When a\n\nwebpage attempts to load one of the vulnerable versions of Java in\n\nInternet Explorer with the update applied, the control is blocked by\n\ndefault and the user is urged to update Java to a more secure version.\n\nFigure 33.

More than three-quarters of Internet-connected personal computers worldwide are protected by real-time security software that constantly monitors the computers and network traffic for threats and blocks them before they can infect the computers, if possible. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the malware landscape requires consideration of infection attempts that are blocked as well as infections that are removed. \n\nMicrosoft uses two different metrics to measure malware and unwanted\nsoftware prevalence:[16]\n\n- _Encounter rate is simply the percentage of computers running Microsoft_\nreal-time security products that report a malware encounter.[17] For example,\n[the encounter rate for the malware family JS/Bondat in Mexico in 2Q15 was](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=JS/Bondat)\n4.2 percent. This data means that, of the computers in Mexico that were\nrunning Microsoft real-time security software in 2Q15, 4.2 percent reported\nencountering the Bondat family, and 95.8 percent did not. Encountering a\nthreat does not mean the computer has been infected. Only computers\nwhose users have opted in to provide data to Microsoft are considered\nwhen calculating encounter rates.[18]\n\n16 Microsoft regularly reviews and refines its data collection methodology to improve its scope and accuracy.\nFor this reason, the statistics presented in this volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report may differ\nslightly from comparable statistics in previous volumes.\n\n17 Encounter rate does not include threats that are blocked by a web browser before being detected by\nantimalware software. In particular, IExtensionValidation in Internet Explorer 11 enables security software to\nblock pages that contain exploits from loading. (See “Exploit detection with Internet Explorer and\nIExtensionValidation” on page 55 for information about IExtensionValidation and the threats it blocks.) For this\nreason, encounter rate figures may not fully reflect all of the threats encountered by computer users.\n\n18 For information about the products and services that provide data for this report, see “Appendix B: Data\nsources” on page 129.\n\n\n-----\n\n- _Computers cleaned per mille, or CCM, is an infection rate metric that is_\ndefined as the number of computers cleaned for every 1,000 unique\ncomputers that run the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), a free tool\ndistributed through Microsoft update services that removes more than 200\nhighly prevalent or serious threats from computers. Because it is not a realtime tool, the MSRT only detects and removes threats that are already\npresent on the computer; it does not block infection attempts as they\nhappen.\n\nFigure 41 illustrates the difference between these two metrics.\n\nFigure 41. Worldwide encounter and infection rates, 2Q14–2Q15, by quarter\n\n25%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n0% 0\n\n3Q14 4Q14 1Q15 2Q15\n\nEncounter rate Infection rate\n\nFigures do not include Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout. See “Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout” on page 60 for more information.\n\nAs Figure 41 shows, and as one would expect, malware encounters are much\nmore common than malware infections. On average, about 17.0 percent of\nreporting computers worldwide encountered malware over the past four\nquarters. At the same time, the MSRT removed malware from about 7.1 out of\nevery 1,000 computers, or 0.71 percent. Together, encounter and infection rate\ninformation can help provide a broader picture of the malware landscape by\noffering different perspectives on how malware propagates and how computers\nget infected.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Brantall, Rotbrow, and Filcout**\n\n\n[Where noted, the figures in this report omit detections of Win32/Brantall,](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Brantall)\n[Win32/Rotbrow, and Win32/Filcout. These three families were involved in an](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Rotbrow)\nincident in which a rogue developer with access to commercial source code\nmodified the source code to serve as a stealth distribution method for malware\nwithout being detected by major security software vendors. When the\nmodification was discovered, it resulted in a significant installed base of\ncommercial software being reclassified as malicious, which had an outsized\neffect on infection rates. Microsoft believes that the unmodified infection and\nencounter figures do not create an accurate picture of the worldwide threat\nlandscape over the past year and a half. As a result, totals for the Brantall,\nFilcout, and Rotbrow families have been removed from the infection and\nencounter figures presented here where appropriate, as noted.\n\n[See “The Sefnit saga: a timeline” on pages 57–64 of Microsoft Security](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=44937)\n_[Intelligence Report, Volume 17 (January–June 2014), available from the Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=44937)_\nDownload Center, for a more in-depth explanation of the incident, along with\ndetection statistics and a timeline of events.\n\n**Malware and unwanted software worldwide**\n\nThe telemetry data generated by Microsoft security products from computers\nwhose administrators or users choose to opt in to provide data to Microsoft\nincludes information about the location of the computer, as determined by IP\ngeolocation.

They can then steal passwords and\ngather information about the device to send to the attacker. The Simda.AT\nvariant first appeared in 2012, and is often downloaded to a vulnerable device\nby a drive-by download. Aside from the information-stealing behavior common\nto Simda variants, Simda.AT redirects search traffic from popular websites such\nas Bing, Google, and Facebook to its own domain, and can download other\nmalware from a remote host. Simda was the 55th most commonly encountered\nmalware family worldwide in 1H15, with the overwhelming majority of\nencounters involving the Simda.AT variant.\n\nFigure 48.

The malicious webpages that\nexploit kits use to spread malware often include scripts that detect certain\naspects of the computer’s computing environment and only present their\nexploits to computers that meet criteria specified by the attacker. The Angler\nexploit kit clearly affects Windows 7 far more than other platforms, which\nmay partially be caused by the integration of Adobe Flash Player into\nInternet Explorer in Windows 8 and 8.1. The Angler exploit kit relies heavily\non exploiting vulnerabilities in old, out-of-date versions of Flash Player,\nwhich must be installed as an add-on and updated separately from Internet\nExplorer in versions of Windows prior to Windows 8. Because Flash Player is\nintegrated into Internet Explorer in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, it receives\nsecurity updates through Windows Update and Microsoft Update along with\nother operating system components, which makes it easier for users to stay\ncurrent on security updates for the component.\n\n- Apart from Axpergle, the list of the most commonly encountered malware\n[families was largely consistent from platform to platform.

Home users are more likely to connect to the Internet directly or\nthrough a home router and to use their computers for entertainment purposes,\nsuch as playing games, watching videos, shopping, and communicating with\nfriends. These different usage patterns mean that home users tend to be\nexposed to a different mix of computer threats than enterprise users.\n\nThe infection telemetry data produced by Microsoft antimalware products and\ntools includes information about whether the infected computer belongs to an\nActive Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain. Such domains are used\nalmost exclusively in enterprise environments, and computers that do not\nbelong to a domain are more likely to be used at home or in other nonenterprise contexts. Comparing the threats encountered by domain-joined\ncomputers and non-domain computers can provide insights into the different\nways attackers target enterprise and home users and which threats are more\nlikely to succeed in each environment.\n\n|Rank 2Q15|Family|Most significant category|Rank (Windows Vista SP2)|Rank Windows 7 SP1)|Rank (Windows 8 RTM)|Rank (Windows 8.1 RTM)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|Win32/CouponRuc|Browser Modifiers|2|1|1|1|\n|2|Win32/KipodToolsCby|Browser Modifiers|1|2|2|3|\n|3|Win32/InstalleRex|Software Bundlers|6|4|3|2|\n|4|Win32/SaverExtension|Adware|4|5|4|4|\n|5|Win32/AlterbookSP|Browser Modifiers|3|3|5|5|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 61.

This telemetry data makes it\npossible to analyze security software usage patterns around the world and\ncorrelate them with infection rates. Figure 65 shows the percentage of\ncomputers worldwide that the MSRT found to be protected or unprotected by\nreal-time security software each quarter in 2H14 and 1H15.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 65.

In Figure 65, “Protected”\nrepresents computers that had real-time security software active and up-todate every time the MSRT ran during a quarter; “Intermittently protected”\nrepresents computers that had security software active during one or more\nMSRT executions, but not all of them. “Unprotected” represents computers\nthat did not have security software active during any MSRT executions that\nquarter.\n\n       - Overall, about three-fourths of computers worldwide were found to be\nalways protected at every monthly MSRT execution in each of the past four\nquarters, varying between 71.4 percent and 74.3 percent.\n\n       - Computers that never reported running security software accounted for\nbetween 18.8 and 19.3 percent of computers worldwide each quarter.\nIntermittently protected computers—those that were found to be running\nreal-time security software during at least one MSRT execution in a quarter,\nbut not all of them—accounted for between 6.4 and 9.9 percent of\ncomputers each quarter.\n\nComputers that do not run real-time security software are at significantly greater\nrisk of malware infection than computers that do. Figure 66 compares infection\nrates with protection levels worldwide for each of the last four quarters.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 66.

Average quarterly security software protection state for supported client versions of Windows in 1H15\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\nWindows Vista SP2 Windows 7 SP1 Windows 8 RTM\n\nProtected Intermittent Unprotected\n\n- Only 10.0 percent of computers running Windows 8.1 reported being\nunprotected during every MSRT execution each quarter on average, about\nhalf of the rate reported by computers running any other supported client\nversion of Windows. At the same time, Windows 8.1 had a higher rate of\nintermittent protection than any other platform, primarily because of active\nsecurity products expiring during the period. In most cases, this is probably\nbecause of commercial security products pre-installed on new computers\nwith trial subscriptions that expire within a few months unless the purchaser\npays to extend the subscription.\n\n- The reasons computers go unprotected can vary significantly by platform, as\nFigure 72 illustrates.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 72. Status reported by unprotected computers running supported client versions of Windows in 1H15\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\nWindows Vista SP2* Windows 7 SP1* Windows 8 RTM Windows 8.1 RTM\n\nExpired Off Out of date No AV installed Snoozed\n\n- Windows Vista and Windows 7 do not report expired subscriptions.\n\n       - On Windows Vista and Windows 7, unprotected computers predominantly\nreport having no antimalware software installed at all. On Windows 8 and\nWindows 8.1, Windows Defender is enabled by default if no other\nantimalware software is present, so the number of computers reporting no\nantimalware software is very low.\n\n       - On Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, expired versions of commercial\nantimalware products that are no longer receiving signature updates\naccount for the largest percentage of unprotected computers.\n\n\n**Advanced Threat Protection takes malware defense to the next level**\n\n\nComputer security is a constant arms race: security professionals and\nantimalware vendors continually seek ways to better protect computers and\npeople from harm, while attackers continually look for ways to defeat those\nprotections. Conventional antimalware products offer protection against known\nthreats, but are significantly less effective against unknown and unidentifiable\nmalware. The advent of targeted attack groups, such as the one described in\n“STRONTIUM: A profile of a persistent and motivated adversary” beginning on\npage 3, has raised the bar for defenders, as these groups often have the\nresources to craft custom malware variants and test them against popular\nsecurity products to ensure that they will not be detected. Although security\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nensure that they will not be detected. By the time detection signatures are\navailable to stop such a threat, it may have already compromised the\norganization.\n\nExchange Online Advanced Threat Protection adds a new layer of defense\nagainst email-borne threats that uses behavioral analysis to detect incoming\nfiles that may be harmful, and blocks them before they can reach their intended\nrecipients. When an incoming message includes a potentially dangerous\nattached file, Exchange Online launches it in a detonation chamber—a virtual\nsandboxed environment in which potential threats can run without posing harm\nto any other resources—and monitors it for malicious behavior such as\nsuspicious registry changes, attempts to access memory dumps, changes to\nexecutables, and other actions that malware characteristically takes. This\nmonitoring makes it possible to detect and block threats that have never been\nseen before and for which no detection signatures are available. Exchange\nOnline Advanced Threat Protection includes anti-sandbox detection features\nsuch as vulnerability detection to combat advanced threats that avoid taking\nmalicious actions when they determine they are being run in a virtual machine.\n\n\nFigure 74. Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection notifies administrators when malware is detected\n\n\nAdministrators can configure how Exchange Online reacts when it determines\nthat an attachment contains malware. Exchange Online can be configured to\nblock delivery of the message, notify administrators, and include a copy of the\nblocked message so they can analyze it themselves and determine whether\nadditional action is necessary. The process of analyzing a message typically\ntakes about four to five minutes; administrators can set a 30 minute time limit for\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 76. Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection blocks malicious links in email messages\n\n\nExchange Online Advanced Threat Protection can be configured to track when\nusers clicks malicious links to help administrators monitor potential targeted\nattacks and determine which computers may have been exposed to malware.\nCustomers with privacy or compliance concerns can disable the link tracking\nfeature.\n\nAdvanced Threat Protection is available for subscribers of select Exchange or\nOffice 365 plans for an additional small per-user fee.

Malicious websites typically appear to be completely legitimate, and provide no outward indicators of their malicious nature even to experienced computer users. In many cases, these sites are legitimate websites that have been compromised by malware, SQL injection, or other techniques in efforts by attackers to take advantage of the trust users have invested in such sites. To help protect users from malicious webpages, Microsoft and other browser vendors have developed filters that keep track of sites that host malware and phishing attacks and display prominent warnings when users try to navigate to them. \n\nThe information in this section is compiled from a variety of sources, including\ntelemetry data produced by SmartScreen Filter (in Internet Explorer versions 8\nthrough 11 and pre-release versions of Microsoft Edge) and the Phishing Filter\n(in Internet Explorer 7), from a database of known active phishing and malware\nhosting sites reported by users of Internet Explorer and other Microsoft products\nand services, and from malware data provided by Microsoft antimalware\ntechnologies.

SmartScreen Filter in Internet Explorer blocks reported phishing and malware distribution sites to\nprotect users\n\n**Phishing sites**\n\nMicrosoft gathers information about phishing sites and impressions from\n_phishing impressions that are_ generated by users who choose to enable the\nPhishing Filter or SmartScreen Filter.[21] A phishing impression is a single instance\nof a user attempting to visit a known phishing site with SmartScreen Filter\nenabled and being warned, as illustrated in Figure 78.\n\n21 See “Appendix B: Data sources” on page 129 for information about the products and services used to\nprovide data for this report.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 78. How Microsoft tracks phishing impressions\n\nFigure 79 illustrates the volume of phishing impressions tracked by SmartScreen\nFilter each month from February through July of 2015, compared to the volume\nof distinct phishing URLs visited.\n\nFigure 79. Phishing sites and impressions reported by SmartScreen Filter, February–July 2015, relative to the monthly average for\neach\n\n\n-----\n\n       - Numbers of active phishing sites and phishing impressions both increased\nbetween February and July, indicative of a general increase in phishing\nactivity. Because phishers are frequently observed using campaigns to drive\nlarge amounts of traffic to a relatively small number of pages, however, the\ntwo metrics are generally not strongly correlated, and the dual increase\nthrough June and July may be largely coincidental.\n\nTarget institutions\n\nSome types of sites tend to consistently draw many more impressions per site\nthan others. Figure 80 shows the breakdown of phishing impressions by\ncategory as reported by SmartScreen Filter.\n\nFigure 80. Impressions reported by SmartScreen Filter for each type of phishing site, February–July 2015\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30% Impressions\n\nSites\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\nOnline Services Financial Sites Social Networking E-Commerce Gaming\n\n       - Financial institutions have always been popular phishing targets because of\ntheir potential for providing direct illicit access to victims’ bank accounts.\nSites that targeted financial institutions accounted for the largest number of\nactive phishing attacks during the period, as well as the second largest\nnumber of impressions. (See “Win32/Banload and Banking Malware” on\npage 21 for information about regional problems with banking malware in\nBrazil.)\n\n\n-----\n\n- Phishing sites that targeted online services received the largest share of\nimpressions during the period, and accounted for the second largest\nnumber of active phishing URLs.\n\n- The other three categories each accounted for a small percentage of both\nsites and impressions.\n\nGlobal distribution of phishing sites and clients\n\nPhishing impression information from SmartScreen Filter includes anonymized\ninformation about the IP addresses of the clients making the reports, as well as\nthe IP addresses of the phishing sites themselves. Performing geographic\nlookups on these addresses makes it possible to analyze patterns among both\nthe computers that host phishing sites and the users that they target.\n\nFigure 81. Phishing sites per 1,000 Internet hosts for locations around the world in 1H15\n\n- SmartScreen Filter detected approximately 5.0 phishing sites per 1,000\nInternet hosts worldwide in 1H15.\n\n- Locations hosting higher than average concentrations of phishing sites\ninclude Bulgaria (98.5 per 1,000 Internet hosts in 1Q15), Libya (15.6), and\nBelize (14.5). Locations with low concentrations of phishing sites include\nTaiwan (1.2), the United Arab Emirates (1.4), and Korea (1.6).\n\n**Malware hosting sites**\n\nSmartScreen Filter helps provide protection against sites that are known to host\nmalware, in addition to phishing sites. SmartScreen Filter uses file and URL\n\n\n-----\n\nreputation data and Microsoft antimalware technologies to determine whether\nsites distribute unsafe content. As with phishing sites, Microsoft collects\nanonymized data regarding how many people visit each malware hosting site\nand uses the information to improve SmartScreen Filter and to better combat\nmalware distribution.\n\nFigure 82. SmartScreen Filter in Internet Explorer displays a warning when a user attempts to download an unsafe file\n\nFigure 83 compares the volume of active malware hosting sites in the Microsoft\ndatabase each month with the volume of malware impressions tracked.\n\nFigure 83. Malware hosting sites and impressions tracked each month, February–July 2015, relative to the monthly average for each\n\n180%\n\n160%\n\n140%\n\n**Sites**\n\n120% **Impressions**\n\n100% **_Average_**\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\nFebruary March April May June July\n\n       - As with phishing sites and impressions, malware hosting sites and\nimpressions rarely correlate strongly with one another. The number of\nimpressions remained largely stable each month from February through\nJuly, while the number of active malware hosting sites tracked by\nSmartScreen Filter increased sharply from February to April, then retreated\nto lower levels for the remainder of the period.\n\n\n-----\n\nGlobal distribution of malware hosting sites and clients\n\nFigure 84 shows the geographic distribution of malware hosts and computers\nreporting impressions in 1H15.\n\nFigure 84. Malware distribution sites per 1,000 Internet hosts for locations around the world in 1H15\n\n- SmartScreen Filter detected approximately 16.7 malware hosting sites per\n1,000 Internet hosts worldwide in 1H15.\n\n- Locations with large concentrations of malware hosting sites included Brazil\n(41.0 per 1,000 Internet hosts in 1H15), Costa Rica (38.8), and Russia (23.9).\nLocations with low concentrations of malware hosting sites included Taiwan\n(2.8), Saudi Arabia (4.3), and Finland (4.4).\n\n**Drive-by download sites**\n\nA drive-by download site is a website that hosts one or more exploits that target\nvulnerabilities in web browsers and browser add-ons. Users with vulnerable\ncomputers can be infected with malware simply by visiting such a website, even\nwithout attempting to download anything.\n\nDrive-by download pages are usually hosted on legitimate websites to which an\nattacker has posted exploit code. Attackers gain access to legitimate sites\nthrough intrusion or by posting malicious code to a poorly secured web form,\nlike a comment field on a blog. Compromised sites can be hosted anywhere in\nthe world and concern nearly any subject imaginable, making it difficult for even\nan experienced user to identify a compromised site from a list of search results.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 85. One example of a drive-by download attack\n\nSearch engines such as Bing have taken a number of measures to help protect\nusers from drive-by downloads. As Bing indexes webpages, they are assessed\nfor malicious elements or malicious behavior. Because the owners of\ncompromised sites are usually victims themselves, the sites are not removed\nfrom the Bing index. Instead, clicking the link in the list of search results displays\na prominent warning, saying that the page may contain malicious software, as\nshown in Figure 86.\n\nFigure 86. A drive-by download warning from Bing\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 87 shows the concentration of drive-by download pages in countries and\nregions throughout the world at the end of 1Q15 and 2Q15, respectively.\n\nFigure 87. Drive-by download pages indexed by Bing at the end of 1Q15 (top) and 2Q15 (bottom), per 1,000 URLs in each\ncountry/region\n\n- Each map shows the concentration of drive-by download URLs tracked by\nBing in each country or region on a reference date at the end of the\nassociated quarter, expressed as the number of drive-by download URLs\nper every 1,000 URLs hosted in the country/region.\n\n- Significant locations with high concentrations of drive-by download URLs in\nboth quarters include Panama, with 8.7 drive-by URLs for every 1,000 URLs\ntracked by Bing at the end of 2Q15; Vietnam, with 3.0; and Russia, with 1.7.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Guidance: Protecting users from unsafe websites**\n\nOne of the best ways organizations can protect their users from malicious and\ncompromised websites is by mandating the use of web browsers with\nappropriate protection features built in and by promoting safe browsing\npractices. For in-depth guidance, see “Top security solutions” at\n[www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/solutions.aspx.](http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/solutions.aspx)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigating risk\n\n**Malware at Microsoft: Dealing with threats in the**\n**Microsoft environment ........................................................... 111**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Malware at Microsoft: Dealing with threats in the Microsoft environment\n\n**_Microsoft IT_**\n\n_Microsoft IT provides information technology services internally for Microsoft_\n_employees and resources. Microsoft IT manages more than 600,000 devices for_\n_more than 150,000 users across more than 100 countries and regions worldwide._\n_Safeguarding a computing infrastructure of this size requires implementation of_\n_strong security policies, technology to help keep malware off the network and_\n_away from mission-critical resources, and dealing with malware outbreaks swiftly_\n_and comprehensively when they occur._\n\nThis section of the report compares the potential impact of malware to the levels\nof antimalware compliance from more than 500,000 workstation computers and\ndevices managed by Microsoft IT between January and June 2015. This data is\ncompiled from multiple sources, including System Center Endpoint Protection\n(SCEP), Windows Defender, DirectAccess, forensics, and manual submission of\nsuspicious files. Comparing the nature and volume of the malware detected on\nthese computers to the level of protection they receive can illustrate significant\ntrends and provide insights as to the effectiveness of antimalware software and\nsecurity best practices.\n\n**Antimalware usage**\n\nReal-time antimalware software is required on all user devices that connect to\nthe Microsoft corporate network. System Center Endpoint Protection 2012\n(SCEP) and Windows Defender are the antimalware solutions that Microsoft IT\ndeploys to its users. To be considered compliant with antimalware policies and\nstandards, user computers must be running the latest version of the SCEP or\nDefender client, antimalware signatures must be no more than six days old, and\nreal-time protection must be enabled.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 88 shows the level of antimalware noncompliance in the Microsoft user\nworkstation environment for each month in 1H15.\n\nFigure 88. Percentage of computers at Microsoft running real-time antimalware software in 1H15\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\nJanuary February March April May June\n\nDespite a small drop in compliance at the beginning of the year that was mostly\nrelated to internal testing of current and future versions of Windows, the\naverage monthly compliance rate at Microsoft exceeded 98 percent during the\nfirst half of the year. In any network of this size, it is almost inevitable that a small\nnumber of computers will be in a noncompliant state at any given time. In most\ncases, these are computers that are being rebuilt or are otherwise in a state of\nchange when online, rather than computers that have had their antimalware\nsoftware intentionally disabled.\n\nMicrosoft IT believes that a compliance rate in excess of 98 percent among\napproximately half a million computers is an acceptable level of compliance. In\nmost cases, attempting to boost a large organization’s compliance rate the rest\nof the way to 100 percent will likely be a costly endeavor, and the end result—\n100 percent compliance—will be unsustainable over time.\n\n**Malware detections**\n\nFigure 89 shows the categories of malware and unwanted software that were\nmost frequently detected at Microsoft in 1H15.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 89. Top categories of malware and unwanted software detected by System Center Endpoint Protection at Microsoft in 1H15\n\n1,400,000\n\n1,200,000\n\n1,000,000\n\n800,000\n\n600,000\n\n400,000\n\n200,000\n\n0\n\nAdware Downloaders Browser Trojans Exploits Other Worms Viruses Backdoors Password\n\n& Droppers Modifiers Malware Stealers &\n\nMonitoring\n\nTools\n\nIn this section, malware detections are defined as files and processes flagged by\nSCEP, regardless of the success or failure of automated containment or\nremediation. Malware detections are a measure of attempted malware activity,\nand do not necessarily indicate that a computer has been successfully infected.\n(Note that the methodology for assessing encounters used elsewhere in this\nreport counts unique computers with detections, an approach that differs from\nthe methodology used in this section, in which individual detections are\ncounted. For example, if a computer encountered one trojan family in February\nand another one in June, it would only be counted once for the purposes of\nfigures such as Figure 49 on page 70. In the preceding Figure 89, it would be\ncounted twice, once for each detection.)\n\nAdware was the most prevalent category, with nearly one and a half times as\nmany detections as all other categories combined. The outsized number of\ninternal adware detections is caused by a pilot project that MSIT has undertaken\nwith the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) to improve detection of\nadware and other unwanted software. As this work is evaluated and found to\nproduce valid and satisfactory results, any improved detection methods will be\nincorporated into Microsoft security products for the benefit of customers and\nend users.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 90 shows the top 10 file types among threat detections at Microsoft in\n1H15.\n\nFigure 90. Top ten file types used by threats detected at Microsoft in 1H15\n\n1,400,000\n\n1,200,000\n\n1,000,000\n\n800,000\n\n600,000\n\n400,000\n\n200,000\n\n0\n\n.exe .dll .tmp .temp .xml .host .xls .htm .mp3 .lnk\n\nExecutable program files with the .exe extension were the most commonly\ndetected type of malicious file at Microsoft by a large margin. Many of these\ndetections were related to the joint effort between MSIT and the MSRC to\nimprove detection of unwanted software, as noted earlier. Malicious .dll files\nwere the next most common type of threats, followed by the .tmp and .temp\nextensions, typically used for temporary files.\n\nTransmission vectors\n\nExamining the processes targeted by malware can help illustrate the methods\nthat attackers use to propagate it. Figure 91 lists the top five transmission vectors\nused by the malware encountered at Microsoft in 1H15.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 91. The top five transmission vectors used by malware encountered at Microsoft in 1H15\n\n**Rank** **Description**\n\n1 Web browsing\n\n2 File transfers in the operating system\n\n3 Scheduled tasks in the operating system\n\n4 Cloud backup/storage\n\n5 File transfer applications\n\nThe transmission vector most commonly used by infection attempts detected on\nMicrosoft computers in 1H15 involved web browsing, followed by file transfers\nmade through Windows Explorer and scheduled operating system tasks. Cloud\nbackup and storage services were fourth, followed by file transfer applications,\nincluding peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.\n\n**Malware infections**\n\nBecause almost all of the computers at Microsoft run real-time security software\nat all times, most infection attempts are detected and blocked before they are\nable to infect the target computer. When Defender or SCEP do disinfect a\ncomputer, it is usually because the software’s signature database has been\nupdated to enable it to detect a threat that it did not recognize when the\ncomputer first encountered the threat. This lack of recognition may be because\nthe threat is a new malware family, a new variant of a known family, a known\nvariant that has been encrypted or otherwise repackaged to avoid detection, or\nbecause of some other reason. The MMPC constantly analyzes malware\nsamples submitted to it, develops appropriate detection signatures, and deploys\nthem to customers who use SCEP, Microsoft Security Essentials, and Windows\nDefender.\n\nFigure 92 shows the most commonly detected categories of malware and\nunwanted software that SCEP and Defender removed from computers at\nMicrosoft between January and June of 2015.\n\n|Rank|Description|\n|---|---|\n|1|Web browsing|\n|2|File transfers in the operating system|\n|3|Scheduled tasks in the operating system|\n|4|Cloud backup/storage|\n|5|File transfer applications|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 92.

Adware, which accounted for more than 1.2 million detections at\nMicrosoft in 1H15, was not discovered on a single computer internally during the\nperiod. Most of the other categories also show clear differences between Figure\n89 and Figure 92, although the ordering in the latter chart is significantly\ninfluenced by the low volumes involved.\n\nFigure 93 shows the top 10 file types used by malware to infect computers at\nMicrosoft in 1H15.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 93.

More than half of the malicious files\nremoved from computers at Microsoft by Defender and SCEP in 1H15 had the\nextension .exe, used by executable program files, with seven extensions\naccounting for the remaining files. The .doc extension used for Microsoft Word\nbinary files was next, followed by .bin, .scr, and “._”, an extension consisting of a\nsingle underscore. Four other file types each accounted for a single removal.\n\n**What IT departments can do to protect their users**\n\n- Evaluate commercially available management tools, develop a plan, and\nimplement a third-party update mechanism to disseminate non-Microsoft\nupdates.\n\n- Ensure that all software deployed on computers in the environment is\nupdated regularly.

The Microsoft malware naming convention\n\nWhen Microsoft analysts research a particular threat, they will determine what\neach of the components of the name will be.\n\n**Type**\n\nThe type describes what the threat does on a computer. Worms, trojans, and\nviruses are some of the most common types of threats Microsoft detects.\n\n**Platform**\n\nThe platform refers to the operating system (such as Windows, Mac OS X, and\nAndroid) that the threat is designed to work on. Platforms can also include\nprogramming languages and file formats.\n\n**Family**\n\nA group of threats with the same name is known as a family. Sometimes\ndifferent security software companies use different names.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Variant letters**\n\nVariant letters are used sequentially for each different version or member of a\nfamily. For example, the detection for the variant “.AF” would have been created\nafter the detection for the variant “.AE.”\n\n**Additional information**\n\nAdditional information is sometimes used to describe a specific file or\ncomponent that is used by another threat in relation to the identified threat. In\nthe preceding example, the !lnk indicates that the threat is a shortcut file used by\nthe Backdoor:Win32/Caphaw.D variant, as shortcut files usually use the\nextension .lnk.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B: Data sources\n\nData included in the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report is gathered from a\nwide range of Microsoft products and services whose users have opted in to\nprovide usage data.
