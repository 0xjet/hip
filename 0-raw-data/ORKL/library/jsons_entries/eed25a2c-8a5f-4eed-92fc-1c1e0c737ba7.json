We urge all organizations to join_\n_us in this essential effort and take action. By bringing together key government and private_\n_sector partners via the JCDC, including our partners at the FBI and NSA, we will ensure that_\n_our country’s strongest capabilities are brought to bear in an integrated manner against this_\n_risk.”_\n\n\n-----\n\nCISAs concerning tone is understandable: the new vulnerability is not another hidden path\nfor a malicious attack. Embedded deeply in the stack level it offers the attackers an entire\nnew dimension of offensive patterns. The depth is transferred to scale as this vulnerability\naffects core library components supporting thousands of networks, companies, and\nmachines across the world.\n\nRecorded in the vulnerability database on Friday, November 26, 2021, the Apache Log4j2\nJava-based logging library vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 has the highest possible severity\nscore of Base Score: 10.0 CRITICAL allowing direct remote code execution on the\nvulnerable machines. Due to its core component impact, this vulnerability in some way can\nbe compared to the Apache Struts vulnerability CVE-2019-0230: Apache Struts OGNL\n**Remote Code Execution that led to the breach of** **[Equifax.](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/chinese-hackers-charged-in-equifax-breach-021020)**\n\nMultiple technologies and products run Log4j2 library including popular vCenter, Kafka,\nElastic, and Minecraft presenting an attack surface for the attackers.\n\nThe current activity surrounding the vulnerability resulted in massive world scanning with the\npayloads running from miners, unix DDoS malware, and framework stagers pushed to the\ncompromised hosts.\n\n**_Conti: A Quest For Ultimate Ransomware Exploitation_**\n\nNaturally, this new attack domain became the focal point of hackers’ interests. Hacker teams\nsuspected to work for foreign governments and US adversaries were quickly spotted to\ninvestigate Log4j2. And as the new adversarial pattern seen with ProxyLogon in March 2021\nsuggests, if one day a major CVE is spotted by APTs, the next week it is weaponized by\nransomware.\n\nAnd indeed, a week after the Log4j2 vulnerability became public, AdvIntel discovered the\nmost concerning trend - the exploitation of the new CVE by one of the most prolific organized\nransomware groups - Conti.\n\n\n-----\n\nConti plays a special role in today s threat landscape, primarily due to its scale. Divided on\nseveral teams and involving tenths of full-time members, the Russian-speaking Conti made\nover $150 million USD in the last six months, according to AdvIntel research into the\nransomware logs. And they continue to expand. It is this expansion that has set Conti on a\nlong quest of searching for new attack surfaces and methods. Since August, they have\n[employed many new means: hidden RMM backdoors, new](https://www.advintel.io/post/secret-backdoor-behind-conti-ransomware-operation-introducing-atera-agent) [backup removal solutions, and,](https://www.advintel.io/post/backup-removal-solutions-from-conti-ransomware-with-love)\n[most recently, even an entire operation to revive Emotet.](https://www.advintel.io/post/corporate-loader-emotet-history-of-x-project-return-for-ransomware)\n\nMoreover, Conti already had a history of leveraging exploits as an initial attack vector and for\nlateral movement. For instance, the group leverages Fortinet VPN vulnerability CVE-201813379 to target unpatched devices for the initial attack vector. Conti favors PrintNightmare\n[privilege elevation CVE-2021-34527/CVE-2021-1675, Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472), and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/)\nms17-010 for local privilege elevation and lateral movement on the compromised hosts.\n\nAs such, Log4j2 vulnerability appears at a time for Conti: at the moment when the syndicate\nhas both the strategic intention and the capability to weaponize it for its ransomware goals.\n\n**Discovery: Conti Becomes The First Sophisticated Crimeware Ransomware Group**\n**Weaponizing Log4j2**\n\n**Ransomware Exploitation Timeline: Conti Search for Newer Attack Vectors**\n\n\n-----\n\nNovember 1, 2021 - Due to shrinking attack surfaces, Conti begins the quest to find\nnew attack vectors\n\nNovember 14, 2021 - Use of Emotet - CobaltStrike Chain for Attack\n\nNovember 19, 2021 - Conti Redesigns Their Infrastructure Aiming for New Expansion\n\nNovember 25, 2021 - Announcing New Conti Payload\n\nDecember 6, 2021 - R&D work on advancing botnet modules\n\nDecember 12, 2021 - Conti identifies Log4Shell as a novel possibility\n\nDecember 13, 2021 - Scanning activity for initial access\n\n\n-----\n\nDecember 15, 2021 - Targeting of vCenter networks for lateral movement\n\nOn December 12, through deep visibility into adversarial collections, AdvIntel discovered that\nmultiple Conti group members expressed interest in the exploitation of the vulnerability for\nthe initial attack vector resulting in the scanning activity leveraging the publicly available\nLog4J2 exploit. This is the first time this vulnerability entered the radar of a major\nransomware group.\n\nThe current exploitation led to multiple use cases through which the Conti group tested the\npossibilities of utilizing the Log4J2 exploit. Most importantly, AdvIntel confirmed that the\ncriminals pursued targeting specific vulnerable Log4J2 VMware vCenter for lateral\nmovement directly from the compromised network resulting in vCenter access affecting US\nand European victim networks from the pre-existent Cobalt Strike sessions.\n\n**Early Warning: Ransomware Exploitation of Core Vulnerability**\n\nIt is only a matter of time until Conti and possibly other groups will begin exploiting Log4j2 to\nits full capacity. It is recommended to patch the vulnerable system immediately and view the\nLog4j2 as a ransomware group exploitation vector.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdvIntel provides direct customer access to targeting datasets related to CVE-2021-44228\nLog4Shell exploitation from the Conti ransomware list. The Log4Shell dataset informs\npossible targeted devices from vulnerability scanner devices only. Targeted Searches are\navailable using TLD & IP Range in Log4Shell Exposure Collections.\n\n**Recommendations & Mitigations**\n\nThe Dutch National Cyber Security Center shared a list of the affected software and\nrecommendations linked to each one of them - https://github.com/NCSCNL/log4shell/tree/main/software\n\nCVE-2021-44228 - VMSA-2021-0028 Workaround instructions to address CVE-202144228 in vCenter Server and vCenter Cloud Gateway (87081) https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87081\n\n**Mitre ATT&CK**\n\n**Enterprise Attack - Course of Action**\n\n\n-----\n\nAccount Discovery Mitigation - T1087\n\nBrute Force Mitigation - T1110\n\nCredential Dumping Mitigation - T1003\n\nData Encrypted Mitigation - T1022\n\nData from Local System Mitigation - T1005\n\nExploitation for Defense Evasion Mitigation - T1211\n\nExploitation for Privilege Escalation Mitigation - T1068\n\nExploitation of Remote Services Mitigation - T1210\n\nNetwork Service Scanning Mitigation - T1046\n\nPowerShell Mitigation - T1086\n\nSupply Chain Compromise Mitigation - T1195\n\n**Attack Pattern**\n\nSpearphishing Attachment - T1193\n\nSupply Chain Compromise - T1195\n\nCommand-Line Interface - T1059\n\nPowerShell - T1086\n\nRundll32 - T1085\n\nRegsvr32 - T1117\n\nScripting - T1064\n\nData Encrypted for Impact - T1486\n\nData Encrypted - T1022\n\nRemote Access Tools - T1219\n\nDomain Fronting - T1172\n\nData from Local System - T1005\n\nData from Network Shared Drive - T1039\n\n\n-----\n\nEmail Collection - T1114\n\nPass the Hash - T1075\n\nPass the Ticket - T1097\n\nLogon Scripts - T1037\n\nExploitation of Remote Services - T1210\n\nKerberoasting - T1208\n\nLLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay - T1171\n\nCredentials in Files - T1081\n\nBrute Force - T1110\n\nNetwork Share Discovery - T1135\n\nFile and Directory Discovery - T1083\n\nDomain Trust Discovery - T1482\n\nProcess Hollowing - T1093\n\nProcess Doppelgänging - T1186\n\nProcess Injection - T1055\n\nNew Service - T1050\n\nExploitation for Privilege Escalation - T1068\n\n**Disrupt ransomware attacks & prevent data stealing with AdvIntel’s threat disruption**\n**solutions.
