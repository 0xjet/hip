The malicious\napplication abused sideloading vulnerabilities to load and start the Cinobi banking trojan.\n\nBy: Jaromir Horejsi, Joseph C Chen\nAugust 09, 2021\nRead time: 5 min (1477 words)\n\n\nAugust 9, 2021\n\n\n[In a previous blog entry, we reported on a campaign, which we labeled “Operation Overtrap,” that targeted Japan with a new banking trojan called](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/c/this-week-in-security-news-operation-overtrap-targets-japanese-online-banking-users-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-tax-scams.html)\nCinobi. The campaign, which was perpetrated by a group we named “Water Kappa,” delivered Cinobi via spam. It also delivered the trojan using\n[the Bottle exploit kit, which included newer Internet Explorer exploits CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 and was used for malvertising](https://twitter.com/nao_sec/status/1381100024919035908)\nattacks that was distributed only to Microsoft Internet Explorer users. Throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021, we observed limited activity\nfrom the Bottle exploit kit, with traffic decreasing during the middle of June — possibly indicating that the group was turning to new tools and\ntechniques.\n\nMeanwhile, we found a new social engineering-based malvertising campaign targeting Japan that delivered a malicious application disguised as\neither a free porn game, a reward points application, or a video streaming application. The malicious application abused sideloading\nvulnerabilities to load and start the Cinobi banking trojan. We consider this to be a new campaign from Water Kappa that is aimed at users of web\nbrowsers other than Internet Explorer.\n\nLooking into the Cinobi sample, we found that the overall functionality remained relatively the same, but the configuration had been updated to\ninclude several Japanese cryptocurrency exchange websites as part of the target list. The group started to use Cinobi to steal the credentials of its\nvictim’s cryptocurrency account.\n\nFigure 1. Timeline of Water Kappa’s activities\n\nInfection Routine\n\nThe campaign’s infection routine begins when a user received malvertisements that are disguised as advertisements of either Japanese animated\nporn games, reward points applications, or video streaming applications. While we have observed five different themes of their malvertisements,\nall of them attempt to trick victims into downloading the same archive with the same malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The landing page for downloading the malicious archive, disguised as a streaming application\n\nThese malvertisements are likely cloned from legitimate websites by the malicious actor. Minor modifications are then applied, such as the\nremoval of some buttons and the changing of certain information sections. The only buttons that are left lead to the new page — created by the\nmalicious actor — that instructs the victims how to download and execute the application.\n\nAfter clicking on the button with the text “index.clientdownload.windows” (as shown in figure 2), the landing page starts downloading the ZIP\narchive, which is followed by instructions for the victim on how to open, extract, and execute the main executable file. The other four malicious\nads look visually different, but their behavior and landing page is similar.\n\nFigure 3. Instructions for executing the streaming application\n\nIt is important to note that the access to the website is filtered based on the IP address. Non-Japanese IP addresses will see the following error\nmessage from Cloudflare.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Error shown when the application or game website is accessed from a non\nJapanese IP address\n\nAnalysis of the malware\n\nAfter extracting the ZIP archive, we noticed the listing seen in Figure 5. The files that we decided were interesting enough to be analyzed are\nmarked in red.\n\nFigure 5. Contents of the ZIP archive containing the game; malicious files are marked in red\n\n[Most files are legitimate ones taken from an older version of the “Logitech Capture” application, dated 2018. The legitimate and signed](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/capture)\nLogiCapture.exe (08FB68EB741BF68F3CFC29A4AD3033D75AD57798ED826D926344015BDB8B0EBB) is instructed in LogiCapture.exe.config\n[via custom application settings to load the Xjs.dll library. Xjs.dll loads the format.cfg file, decrypts the shellcode, and executes it.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/appsettings/appsettings-element-for-configuration)\n\nFigure 7. The encrypted format.cfg shellcode\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. The encrypted format.cfg shellcode\n\nFigure 8. The decrypted format.cfg shellcode; strings with file names\n\nand rundll32 command are visible\n\nThe shellcode embedded into format.cfg copies config.dll and cfg.config to the temporary directory %TEMP%, renames these files to a.dll and\n1.txt, and executes the export function named “a” of the a.dll library via the following command:\n\nrundll32.exe \"%TEMP%\\a.dll\",a %TEMP%\\1.txt\n\nConfig.dll (renamed to a.dll) resolves necessary APIs, loads the content of cfg.config (which is renamed to 1.txt), decrypts it with a XOR key, and\n[executes the shellcode. The decrypted cfg.config is the first stage of the Cinobi banking trojan (as explained in our initial blogpost from 2020).](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/c/this-week-in-security-news-operation-overtrap-targets-japanese-online-banking-users-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-tax-scams.html)\n\nFigure 9. Routine in config.dll that decrypts the cfg.config shellcode\n\nFigure 10. Call instruction in Config.dll that executes the decrypted cfg.config shellcode\n\nThe Cinobi banking trojan is split into four stages, with each stage downloading additional components and possibly performing environment or\nanti-virtual machine (VM) checks. There are two command-and-control (C&C) servers, with one of them returning stages 2 to 4, while the other\none returns the configuration files.\n\nThe malicious actor became more active in summer 2021 — we noticed a few more versions with slight differences from the ones described earlier.\nIn addition to the application archive with four added malicious files (as shown in Figure 5), we also notice a refactored version of the archive with\njust three files (xjs.dll, format.cfg, and a file named “ros”), only three stages, and a single C&C server serving the configuration files.\n\nIn the refactored version, Xjs.dll decrypts and loads format.cfg, which is the first stage of the Cinobi banker. This stage, unlike our description\nfrom last year’s blog entry, does not download Tor and other additional stages from the first C&C server. Instead, it reads and extracts files from\nthe file called “ros”, which is an encrypted package containing stages 2 and 3, a configuration file containing the C&C server, and an archive with\nTor.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: The refactored Cinobi banker\n\nThe most important of these is the configuration file containing websites targeted by the form-grabbing functionality. At the time of writing, we\nnoticed that the banking trojan targets users of 11 Japanese financial institutions, with at least three of these involved in cryptocurrency trading.\n\nWhen a victim using an infected machine accesses one of the websites mentioned in the configuration file and sends the filled-out form back to\nthe server, the form-grabbing feature of the banker gets activated. In the following screenshots, we show examples of login forms with filled data.\n\nAfter clicking the submit button, a text file with an encrypted request briefly appears in the folder with the installed banking trojan. After the\ndecryption of the temporary created text file, the highlighted stolen credentials can be seen.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. The targeted websites of companies dealing with cryptocurrencies\n\nFigure 13. The decrypted requests; login credentials are highlighted in blue\n\nConclusion\n\nThe new malvertising campaign shows that Water Kappa is still active and continuously evolving their tools and techniques for greater financial\ngain — this one also aims to steal cryptocurrency. In order to minimize the chances of being infected, users need to be wary of suspicious\nadvertisements on shady websites, and as much as possible, download applications only from trusted sources.\n\n[Trend Micro solutions that offer a multilayered defense system can help organizations protect their employees from these kinds of campaigns by](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection.html)\ndetecting, scanning, and blocking malicious URLs.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\n[The complete indicators for this attack can also be found in this appendix.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/h/cinobi-banking-trojan-targets-users-of-cryptocurrency-exchanges-with-new-malvertising-campaign/IOCs-Cinobi%20Banking%20Trojan%20Targets%20Cryptocurrency%20Exchange%20Users%20via%20Malvertising.txt)\n\nURLs\n\nSHA256 File name Note Analysis\n\n124FE26D53E2702B42AE07F8AEC5EE4E79E7424BCE6ECDA608536BBF0A7A2377 oneroom_setup.zip Malicious Trojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\ngame\narchive\n\n﻿E667F9C109E20900CC8BADD09EDE6CDCE0BDC77164CFD035ACE95498E90D45E7 oneroom_game.zip Malicious Trojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\n\n|SHA256|File name|Note|\n|---|---|---|\n|124FE26D53E2702B42AE07F8AEC5EE4E79E7424BCE6ECDA608536BBF0A7A2377|oneroom_setup.zip|Malicious game archive|\n|﻿E667F9C109E20900CC8BADD09EDE6CDCE0BDC77164CFD035ACE95498E90D45E7|oneroom_game.zip|Malicious game archive|\n\n\n-----\n\nTrojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\n\nTrojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\n\nTrojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\n\nTrojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\n\nTrojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\n\nTrojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\n\nTrojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\n\nTrojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\n\nTrojan.Win32.SHELLOAD\n\nTrojan.Win32.CINOBI.A\n\nTrojan.Win32.CINOBI.A\n\nTrojan.Win32.CINOBI.AC\n\nTrojan.Win32.CINOBI.AC\n\nTrojan.Win32.CINOBI.AC\n\nTrojan.Win32.CINOBI.AC\n\nTrojan.Win32.CINOBI.AC\n\n|93FFE7CF56FEB3FB541AEF91D3FC04A5CF22DF428DC0B7E5FEB8EDDDC2C72699|Magicalgirl.zip|Malicious game archive|\n|---|---|---|\n|﻿AD13BB18465D259ACC6E4CEBA24BEFF42D50843C8FD92633C569E493A075FDDC|kiplayer.zip|Malicious streaming archive|\n|A9EF18B012BD20945BB3533DEEC69D82437BF0117F83B2E9F9E7FACC5AA81255|oneroom_game_v7.zip|Malicious game archive|\n|6C1F4FFA63EE7094573B0F6D1BD51255F603BC8958757405C8C998416537D587|Xjs.dll|First shellcode loader|\n|﻿1366E2AC6365E4B76595A19760438D876E01DB40C60EC3F42849F0218B724F1B|Xjs.dll|First shellcode loader|\n|﻿0B3E5E2406490DF17A198A8340B103BB331A5277461234F3F90ED257E418C1F8|Xjs.dll|First shellcode loader|\n|3E0FAEE93F6EF572537735C7F2D82D151C5A21EB30EACC576B3B66320C74FD34|format.cfg|Encrypted shellcode|\n|﻿DB6CBE4EE82F87008B34D1D4E9AA6EE3C9CCD21CB7A0B60925D5DA8D1295A269|format.cfg|Encrypted shellcode|\n|﻿3B7FB5EC8180AD74871EB9F5B59E6E98A188CE84BA3BD6ADD9B4BCFCCB80C137|format.cfg|Encrypted shellcode|\n|52E2B9CBA4E1BEE1EB3ED9D03BC33EADB6C8D6AAC8598679AA95690E587BE7C4|config.dll|Cinobi 1st stage loader;
