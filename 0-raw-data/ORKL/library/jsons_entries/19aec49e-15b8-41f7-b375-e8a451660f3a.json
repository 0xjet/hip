Once limited to opportunistic criminals,\ncyber attacks are becoming a key weapon for\ngovernments seeking to defend national sovereignty\nand project national power.\n\nFrom strategic cyber espionage campaigns, such as\nMoonlight Maze and Titan Rain, to the destructive,\nsuch as military cyber strikes on Georgia and Iran,\nhuman and international conflicts are entering a new\nphase in their long histories. In this shadowy\nbattlefield, victories are fought with bits instead of\nbullets, malware instead of militias, and botnets\ninstead of bombs.\n\nThese covert assaults are largely unseen by the\npublic. Unlike the wars of yesteryear, this cyber\nwar produces no dramatic images of exploding\nwarheads, crumbled buildings, or fleeing civilians.\nBut the list of casualties—which already includes\nsome of the biggest names in technology, financial\nservices, defense, and government —is growing\nlarger by the day.\n\nA cyber attack is best understood not as an end in\nitself, but as a potentially powerful means to a wide\nvariety of political, military, and economic goals.\n\n“Serious cyber attacks are unlikely to be\nmotiveless,” said Martin Libicki, Senior Scientist\nat RAND Corp. “Countries carry them out to\nachieve certain ends, which tend to reflect their\nbroader strategic goals. The relationship\n\n\nbetween the means chosen and their goals will\nlook rational and reasonable to them if not\nnecessarily to us.”\n\nJust as each country has a unique political\nsystem, history, and culture, state-sponsored\nattacks also have distinctive characteristics,\nwhich include everything from motivation to\ntarget to type of attack.\n\nThis report describes the unique characteristics of\ncyber attack campaigns waged by governments\nworldwide. We hope that, armed with this knowl­\nedge, security professionals can better identify their\nattackers and tailor their defenses accordingly.\n\nHere is a quick overview:\n\n**•** **Asia-Pacific. Home to large, bureaucratic**\nhacker groups such as the “Comment Crew”\nwho pursue many goals and targets in\nhigh-frequency, brute-force attacks.\n\n**•** **Russia/Eastern Europe. These cyber attacks**\nare more technically advanced and highly\neffective at evading detection.\n\n**•** **Middle East. These hackers are dynamic,**\noften using creativity, deception, and\nsocial engineering to trick users into com­\npromising their own computers.\n\n**•** **United States. The most complex, targeted,**\nand rigorously engineered cyber attack\ncampaigns to date.\n\n\n-----\n\n**World War C: Understanding Nation-State Motives Behind Today’s Advanced Cyber Attacks**\n\n#### Introduction\nWorld War Z—a bestselling book and Holly­\nwood movie—detailed a global pandemic in\nwhich politics and culture deeply influenced\nhow the public—and by extension, govern­\nments—reacted to a zombie plague. In one\npassage, for example, an Arab boy refused to\nbelieve that the disease was real, suspecting\nthat Israel had fabricated the story. The nations\ndescribed in World War Z—the United States,\nChina, Russia, South Korea, Israel, and many\nothers—are involved in a very different type of\nconflict, but one with real and growing national\nsecurity impact: World War C, where “C”\nstands for “Cyber”. However, the same rule\napplies: each country has a unique political\nsystem, history, language, culture, and under­\nstanding of human and international conflict.\n\nCyber conflict often mirrors traditional conflict.\nFor example, China uses high-volume cyber\nattacks similar to how it used infantry during the\nKorean War. Many Chinese soldiers were sent\ninto battle with only a handful of bullets. Given\ntheir strength in numbers, they were still able to\nachieve battlefield victories. On the other end of\nthe spectrum lie Russia, the U.S., and Israel, whose\ncyber tactics are more surgical, reliant on\nadvanced technologies and the cutting-edge work\nof contractors who are driven by competition and\nfinancial incentives.\n\nWe are still at the dawn of the Internet Age. But\ncyber attacks have already proven themselves as\na low-cost, high-payoff way to defend national\nsovereignty and to project national power. Many\nof today’s headlines seem to be pulled from the\npages of a science fiction novel. Code so sophisti­\ncated it destroys a nuclear centrifuge thousands\nof miles away. Malware that secretly records\n\n\neverything a user does on a computer. A software\nprogram that steals data from any nearby device\nthat has Bluetooth connectivity. Encrypted code\nthat decrypts only on one specific, target device.\nSuch sophistication speaks volumes about the\nmaturity, size, and resources of the organizations\nbehind these attacks. With a few rare exceptions,\nthese attacks are now in the exclusive realm of\nnation-states.\n\n“The international community has developed a\nsolid understanding of cyber technology,” said\nProf. Michael N. Schmitt of the U.S. Naval War\nCollege, in an email interview. “What is missing\nis a grasp of the geopolitical context in which\nsuch technology operates. Attribution determi­\nnations made without sensitivity to the geopolit­\nical surroundings are seldom reasonable.”\n\nWorld War C, like any analogy, has its limits.\nCyber war has been compared to special\noperations forces, submarine warfare, missiles,\nassassins, nuclear weapons, Pearl Harbor, 9/11,\nKatrina, and more. Even our zombie analogy is\nnot new. Often, any compromised computer, if\nit is actively under the surreptitious control of a\ncybercriminal, is called a zombie, and botnets\nare sometimes called zombie armies. Also,\ncompared to stockpiling tanks and artillery,\nwriting cyber attack code, and compromising\nthousands if not millions of computers, is easy.\nMoreover, malware often spreads with the\nexponential growth of an infectious disease.\n\nThis report examines many publicly known\ncyber attacks. By exploring some of the\ndistinctive national or regional characteristics\nof these attacks, organizations can better\nidentify their attackers, anticipate future\nattacks, and defend themselves.\n\n\n-----\n\n**World War C: Understanding Nation-State Motives Behind Today’s Advanced Cyber Attacks**\n\n#### A Word of Warning\nThe analytical waters surrounding cyber warfare\nare inherently murky. At the strategic level,\ngovernments desire to have a degree of plausible\ndeniability. At the tactical level, military and\nintelligence organizations envelop such opera­\ntions in layers of classification and secrecy. To be\neffective, information operations rely on decep­\ntion—and the Internet offers an ideal venue for\na spy’s smoke and mirrors. In practical terms,\nhackers often run their attacks through cyber\nterrain (such as compromised, third-party\nnetworks) that present investigators with\ntechnical and jurisdictional complications. And\nfinally, cybercriminal tools, tactics, and proce­\ndures (TTPs) evolve so quickly that cyber defense,\nlegislation, and law enforcement remain behind\nthe attacker’s curve.\n\n“The biggest challenge to deterring, defending\nagainst, or retaliating for cyber attacks is the\nproblem of correctly identifying the perpetrator,”\nsaid Prof. John Arquilla, Naval Postgraduate School\nin an email interview with FireEye.® “Ballistic\nmissiles come with return addresses. But computer\nviruses, worms, and denial of service attacks often\nemanate from behind a veil of anonymity. The best\nchance to pierce this veil comes with the skillful\nblending of forensic back-hacking techniques with\ndeep knowledge of others’ strategic cultures and\ntheir geopolitical aims.”\n\nCyber “attribution”—identifying a likely culprit,\nwhether an individual, organization, or na­\ntion-state—is notoriously difficult, especially for\nany single attack. States are often mistakenly\n\n\nidentified as non-state actors, and vice versa. To\nmake matters worse, ties between the two are\nincreasing. First, a growing number of “patriotic\ncybercriminals” ostensibly wage cyber war on\nbehalf of governments (examples include Chechnya\nand Kosovo in the 1990s, China in 2001, Estonia in\n2007, Georgia in 2008, and every year in the\nMiddle East).[1] Second, cybercrime organizations\noffer anyone, including governments, cyber attack\nservices to include denial-of-service attacks and\naccess to previously compromised networks.\n\nFireEye researchers have even seen one\nnation-state develop and use a sophisticated\nTrojan, and later (after its own counter-Trojan\ndefenses were in place) sell it to cybercriminals\non the black market. Thus, some cyber attack\ncampaigns may bear the hallmarks of both state\nand non-state actors, making positive attribution\nalmost impossible. And finally, “false flag” cyber\noperations involve a hacker group behaving like\nanother to mislead cyber defense researchers.\n\n#### The FireEye Perspective\nWithin the shadowy world of cyber warfare,\nFireEye occupies a unique position. First, our threat\nprotection platform has been installed on thou­\nsands of sensitive networks around the world. This\ngives our researchers a global and embedded\npresence in the cyber domain. Second, FireEye\ndevices are placed behind traditional security\ndefenses such as firewalls, anti-virus, and intrusion\nprevention systems. This means that our “false\npositive” rate is extremely low, and that the attacks\nwe detect have already succeeded in penetrating\nexternal network defenses.\n\n\n1 Geers K.

The reasons for this\ninclude its huge population, a rapidly expanding\neconomy, and a lack of good mitigation strategies\non the part of its targets.\n\n**Chinese attacks on the U.S.**\nThe list of successful Chinese compromises is\nlong, and spans the entire globe. Here are some of\nthe most significant incidents in the U.S.:\n\n**•** **Government: By 1999, the U.S. Department**\nof Energy believed that China posed an “acute”\nthreat to U.S. nuclear security via cyber\nespionage.2 By 2009, China apparently stole\nthe plans for the most advanced U.S. fighter jet,\nthe F-35.[3].\n\n**•** **Technology: China hacked Google, Intel,**\nAdobe, and RSA’s SecureID authentication\n\n\ntechnology—with which it then targeted\nLockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and L-3\nCommunications.[4]\n\n**•** **Business and Financial Services: Morgan**\nStanley, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and\nnumerous banks have been hacked.[5]\n\n**•** **Media: The New York Times, Wall Street**\nJournal, Washington Post, and more have\nbeen targeted by advanced, persistent cyber\nattacks emanating from China.[6]\n\n**•** **Critical Infrastructure: Department of**\nHomeland Security (DHS) reported in 2013\nthat 23 gas pipeline companies were hacked\n(possibly for sabotage)[,7] and that Chinese\nhackers were seen at the U.S. Army Corps of\nEngineers’ National Inventory of Dams.[8]\n\nSome of these cyber attacks have given China\naccess to proprietary information such as\nresearch and development data. Others offer\nChinese intelligence access to sensitive commu­\nnications, from senior government officials to\nChinese political dissidents.\n\n\n2 Gerth, J. & Risen, J.

All traditional, geopolitical conflicts have\nmoved into cyberspace, and Chinese\ncompromises encompass the entire globe. But\nmany contests have been one-sided affairs, with\nall publicly known attacks emanating from China.\n\n**•** **Europe: In 2006, Chinese cybercriminals**\ntargeted the UK House of Commons;9 in\n2007, German Chancellor Angela Merkel\n\n\nraised the problem of nation-state hacking\nwith China’s President;[10] in 2010, British\nMI5 warned that undercover Chinese\nintelligence officers had given UK business\nexecutives malware-laden digital cameras\nand memory sticks.[11]\n\n**•** **India: Indian officials worry that China**\ncould disrupt their computer networks\nduring a conflict. One expert confided\nthat an exclusive reliance on Chinese\nhardware might give China a “permanent”\ndenial-of-service capability.[12] One\nsophisticated attack on an Indian Navy\nheadquarters allegedly used a USB vector\nto bridge the “air-gap” between a\ncompartmentalized, standalone network\nand the Internet.[13]\n\n**•** **South Korea: The South Korean**\ngovernment has complained for years of\nChinese activity on its official computers,\nincluding a 2010 compromise of the\npersonal computers and PDAs belonging\nto much of South Korea’s government\npower structure[14] and a 2011 assault on an\nInternet portal that held personal\ninformation for 35 million Koreans.[15].\n\n**•** **Japan: Here, the target list includes**\ngovernment, military, and high-tech\nnetworks.

The\nattack exposed data from 8,000 U.S.\nnetworks, 1,100 Australian networks, and\n230 French networks.[19]\n\n**Chinese cyber tactics**\nThe People’s Republic of China (PRC) is home to\n1.35 billion people, or more than four times the\npopulation of the United States. Therefore,\nChina often has the ability to overwhelm cyber\ndefenses with quantity over quality, just as it did\nin the Korean War and as it might do in any other\ntype of conflict.\n\nThe Chinese malware that FireEye researchers\nhave analyzed is not the most advanced or\ncreative. But in many circumstances, it has\nbeen no less effective. China employs bruteforce attacks that are often the most inexpen­\nsive way to accomplish its objectives. The\nattacks succeed due to the sheer volume of\nattacks, the prevalence and persistence of\nvulnerabilities in modern networks, and a\nseeming indifference on the part of the\ncybercriminals to being caught.\n\n\n17 Report: Plans for Australia spy HQ hacked by China », (28 mai 2013) Associated Press.\n18 « Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network », (29 mars 2009) Information Warfare Monitor.\n19 Vijayan, J.

(1er février 2013) « Operation Beebus », FireEye.\n\n\n-----\n\n**World War C: Understanding Nation-State Motives Behind Today’s Advanced Cyber Attacks**\n\nThe “Comment Crew,” [20] a prominent exam­\nple of a Chinese cyber threat actor, is\nbelieved to be a contractor to the PRC\ngovernment. The Comment Crew is behind\nmany noteworthy attacks, including Opera­\ntion Beebus, which targets U.S. aerospace\nand defense industries. [21]\n\nOne important characteristic of the Comment\nCrew—which puts it definitively in the catego­\nry of an advanced persistent threat, or APT—is\nthat it is a bureaucracy. In-depth analysis\nreveals a small group of creative and strategic\nthinkers at the top. One layer down, a larger\ngroup of specialists design and produce\nmalware in an industrial fashion. At the bottom\nare the foot soldiers—brute-force hackers who\nexecute orders and wage extended cyber\nattack campaigns, from network reconnais­\nsance to spear phishing to data exfiltration.\nThe Comment Crew is so large, in fact, that\nwhen the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) decoded one of the group’s stolen\ncaches of information, if printed out, it would\nhave created a stack of paper taller than a set\nof encyclopedias.[22]\n\nSuch a large bureaucracy helps to explain\nsometimes-incongruous cybercriminal behavior.\nA given piece of malware, for example, may have\n\n\nbeen written by an expert but incorrectly used\nlater by an inexperienced foot soldier (such as a\npoorly written spear phishing email). Under­\nstanding this cyber attack life cycle and its\ndifferent stages can help cyber defenders\nrecognize and foil an attack. In any large organi­\nzation, some processes are less mature than\nothers, and therefore easier to recognize.\n\n**Chinese cyber defense**\nIn its own defense, Chinese officials contend\nthat their country is also a target of cyber\nattacks. In 2006, the China Aerospace Science &\nIndustry Corporation (CASIC) found spyware on\nits classified network.[23] In 2007, the Chinese\nMinistry of State Security stated that foreign\ncybercriminals were stealing Chinese informa­\ntion, with 42 percent of attacks coming from\nTaiwan and 25 percent from the United States.[24]\nIn 2009, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao\nannounced that a cybercriminal from Taiwan had\nstolen his upcoming report to the National\nPeople’s Congress.[25] In 2013, Edward Snowden,\na former system administrator at the National\nSecurity Agency (NSA), published documents\nsuggesting that the U.S. conducted cyber\nespionage against China;[26] and the Chinese\nComputer Emergency Response Team (CERT)\nstated that it possessed “mountains of data” on\ncyber attacks by the U.S.[27]\n\n\n20 Sanger, D., Barboza, D. & Perlroth, N.

North\nKorea (supported by China) would seem to be\nstuck in a cyber Stone Age—especially relative\nto South Korea (supported by the U.S.)—has the\nfastest download speeds in the world[28] and will\nissue its students with computer tablets\ninstead of books by 2015.[29] Even so, the\nInternet offers anyone, and any nation, an\nasymmetric way to gather intelligence and\nproject national power in cyberspace—and\nNorth Korea appears to have acquired cyber\nattacks as a new weapon for its arsenal.\n\nIn 2009, North Korea launched its first major\nassault on South Korean and U.S. government\nwebsites. The attack did little damage, but the\nincident gained wide media exposure.[30] By\n2013, however, the threat actors had matured.\nA group dubbed the “DarkSeoul Gang” was\nresponsible for at least four years of high-pro­\nfile attacks on South Korea. The group’s\nattacks included a distributed denial-of-service\n(DDoS) attack and malicious code that wiped\ncomputer hard drives at banks, media, ISPs,\ntelcos, and financial services companies—over­\nwriting legitimate data with political messages.\nIn the Korean conflict, such incidents often\ntake place on dates of historical significance,\nincluding July 4, the U.S. Independence Day.[31]\nSuspected North Korean attacks on U.S.\ninstitutions include U.S. military elements\nbased in South Korea, the U.S.-based Commit­\ntee for Human Rights in North Korea, and even\nthe White House.\n\n\nNorth Korean defectors have described a burgeon­\ning cyberwarfare department of 3,000 personnel,\nlargely trained in China and Russia. The defectors\nstressed that North Korea has a growing fascina­\ntionwith cyber attacks as a cost-effective way to\ncompete against its conventionally superior foes.\nThey believe that North Korea is growing increas­\ningly comfortable and confident in this new warfare\ndomain, assessing that the Internet is not only\nvulnerable to attack but that this strategy can\ncreate psychological pressure on the West. Toward\nthis end, North Korea has focused on disconnecting\nits important servers from the Internet, while\nbuilding a dedicated “attack network.”[32]\n\nFireEye researchers have seen a heavy use of spear\nphishing and the construction of a “watering hole,”\nin which an important website is hacked in the hope\nof compromising the computers of its subsequent\nvisitors, who usually belong to a certain VIP-profile\nthe attacker is targeting. Some North Korean\nattacks have begun to manipulate a victim’s\noperating system settings and disable their\nanti-virus software—techniques that are normally\ncharacteristic of Russian cybercriminals. In other\nwords, North Korean hackers may have learned\nfrom or have contracted support in Russia.\n\nApart from any possible disruption or destruction\nstemming from cyber attacks, computer network\noperations are an invaluable tool for collecting\nsensitive information, especially when it resides on\ngovernment or think-tank networks normally\ninaccessible from the Internet. North Korea,\nChina, and Russia are all naturally interested in\ncollecting cyber intelligence that would increase\ntheir comparative advantage in classified informa­\ntion, diplomatic negotiating positions, or future\npolicy changes.\n\n\n28 McDonald, M.

But the quiet, border­\nless nature of cyberspace means both sides\nare free to engage in cyber warfare—even\nduring peacetime.\n\nIn 2009, India announced that Pakistani cyber­\ncriminals had placed malware on popular Indian\nmusic download sites as a clever, indirect way to\ncompromise Indian systems.[34 ]In 2010, the\n“Pakistani Cyber Army” defaced and subsequent­\nly shut down the website of the Central Bureau\nof Investigation, India’s top police agency.[35] In\n2012, over 100 Indian government websites\nwere compromised.[36]\n\nNot to be outdone, in 2013, cybercriminals in\nIndia undertook “Operation Hangover,” a largescale Indian cyber espionage campaign that hit\n\n\nPakistani IT, mining, automotive, legal, engineer­\ning, food service, military, and financial services\nnetworks.[37] Although researchers could not\ndefinitively tie the attacks to India’s government,\nmany of the targets represented the country’s\nnational security interests.[38]\n\n**Association of Southeast Asian Nations**\n**(ASEAN): emerging economies as soft targets**\nSince at least 2010, many APTs (likely China-based)\nhave targeted the governments, militaries, and\nbusinesses of ASEAN, the Southeast Asian\ngeopolitical and economic group composed of\nBrunei, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Indonesia,\nLaos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,\nand Vietnam. Although chances of any regional war\nerupting in the near term are low, a large volume of\nongoing, regional cyber espionage activity is a\nconstant. Targeted industries include telecommuni­\ncations, transportation, oil and gas, banks, and think\ntanks. The usual motivation is to gain tactical or\nstrategic advantage within the political, military,\nand economic domains.[39]\n\nFireEye researchers are following numerous\nAPT actors in this region, including BeeBus,\nMirage, Check Command, Taidoor, Seinup, and\nNaikon. Their most common tactic is spear\nphishing, often using legitimate decoy docu­\nments that are related to the target’s national\neconomy or politics, or to regional events such\nas ASEAN summits, Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation (APEC) summits, energy explora­\ntion, or military affairs.\n\n\n33 Herman, S.

Often, these organizations have\ninconsistent system administration, infrequent\nsoftware patch management, poor policy control, or\nsome combination of these issues. Thus, many of\nthese networks are “low-hanging fruit” for attackers.\nAnd to make matters worse, compromised systems\nare used as staging grounds for further attacks on\nregional targets, by installing illicit com­\nmand-and-control (CnC) servers, abusing legitimate\nemail accounts, and disseminating stolen office\ndocuments as “bait.”\n\n#### Russia/Eastern Europe\n\n**Russia—a little bit “too quiet?”**\nIn 1939, Winston Churchill declared that Russia\nwas a “riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an\nenigma …”. Seven decades later, cyber defense\nresearchers would say that not much has\nchanged. Compared with the constant attacks\ndetected from China, you can almost hear the\nsnow falling on Red Square. One of the outstand­\ning questions in cyber security today is: Where\nare the Russians? Perhaps they are simply great\nhackers. Maybe they have sufficient human\nintelligence. Whatever the reason, cyber defense\nanalysts often look in vain for the traces of\nRussian cybercriminals. As a step toward finding\nsome answers, however, consider the second half\nof Churchill’s quote: “… but perhaps there is a\n\n\nkey—that key is Russian national interest.”[40] In\nother words, where there is smoke, there is\nusually fire.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, at the very dawn of the World\nWide Web, Russia was engaged in a protracted\nstruggle over the fate of Chechnya; the Chechens\nbecame pioneers in cyber propaganda, and the\nRussians became pioneers is shutting down their\nwebsites. In 1998, when Russian ally Serbia was\nunder attack from NATO, pro-Serbian hackers\njumped in the fray, targeting NATO with DoS\nattacks and at least twenty-five strains of\nvirus-infected email. In 2007, Russia was the\nprime suspect in the most famous international\ncyber attack to date—the punitive DDoS on\nEstonia for moving a Soviet-era statue.[41]\n\nIn 2008, researchers uncovered clear evidence\nthat computer network operations played a\nsupporting role in Russian military advances\nduring its invasion of Georgia.[42] Also in 2008,\nRussia was suspected in what U.S. Deputy\nSecretary of Defense William Lynn called the\n“most significant breach of U.S. military\ncomputers ever”—an attack on Central Com­\nmand (CENTCOM), delivered through an\ninfected USB drive.[43] In 2009, Russian cyber­\ncriminals were blamed in “Climategate,” a\nbreach of university research intended to\nundermine international negotiations on climate\nchange mitigation.[44] In 2010, NATO and the\nEuropean Union warned of increased Russian\ncyber attacks, while the FBI arrested and\ndeported a possible Russian intelligence agent\nnamed Alexey Karetnikov, who had been\nworking as a software tester at Microsoft.[45]\n\n\n40 “Winston Churchill,” Wikiquote.\n41 Geers K.

In 2012, Russian security\nfirm Kaspersky Lab announced the discovery of\n“Red October,”[46] a cyber attack campaign that spied\non millions of citizens around the world, but chiefly\nwithin the former Soviet Union. Targets included\nembassies, research firms, military bases, energy\nproviders, nuclear agencies, and critical\ninfrastructure.[47] Similarly, in 2013, researchers\nfound malware on millions of Android devices in\nRussia and in Russian-speaking countries. Either or\nboth of these attacks could be partially explained as\nthe Russian government keeping an eye on its own\npopulation, and that of neighboring countries.[48]\n\n\nOn the brighter side, as a step toward cyber\ndétente, the U.S. and Russia in 2013 signed\nan agreement to build a cyber “hotline”—\nsimilar to that used for nuclear scares during\nthe Cold War—to help defuse any computerrelated crises in the future. [49] But, just to be\non the safe side, Russia is taking the extreme\ncyber defense measure of buying oldfashioned typewriters,[50 ]and the Russian\nmilitary is (like the U.S., China, and Israel)\ncreating cyber warfare-focused units. [51]\n\n**Russian tactics**\nThough relatively quiet, Russia appears to\nbe home to many of the most complex and\nadvanced cyber attacks FireEye researchers\nhave seen. More specifically, Russian exploit\ncode can be significantly stealthier than its\nChinese counterpart—which can also make it\nmore worrisome. The “Red October”\ncampaign, including its satellite software\ndubbed “Sputnik,” is a prominent example of\nlikely Russian malware.\n\nTTP often includes the delivery of\nweaponized email attachments, though\nRussian cybercriminals appear to be adept\nat changing their attack patterns, exploits,\nand data exfiltration methods to evade\ndetection. In fact, one telltale aspect of\nRussian hackers seems to be that, unlike the\nChinese, they go to extraordinary lengths to\nhide their identities and objectives. FireEye\nanalysts have even seen examples in which\nthey have run “false-flag” cyber operations,\ndesigning their attack to appear as if it came\nfrom Asia.\n\n\nRUSSIA\n\n\n46 “The ‘Red October’ Campaign—An Advanced Cyber Espionage Network Targeting Diplomatic and Government Agencies” (14 Jan 2013)\n\nGReAT, Kaspersky Lab.\n47 Lee, D.

Therefore,\n\n\nsome Middle Eastern hackers may have to rely on\ncyber tactics that emphasize novelty, creativity,\nand deception.\n\nFor example, the 2012 Mahdi campaign, which\ninfected targets in the Middle East, used\nmalicious Word documents, PowerPoint files,\nand PDFs to infect targets. That approach is\nsimilar to many other attackers. But these\nattacks were accompanied by some imaginative\nelements such as games, attractive images, and\ncustom animations specifically designed to aid\nin the attack.\n\nNot only did they trick users into executing\ncommands to install malicious code, but they\nalso distracted users from seeing malwarerelated warning messages. Furthermore,\nMahdi attacks were tailored to specific target\naudiences—for example by offering variations\nof games unique to each organization. Such\npinpoint strikes rely on prior reconnaissance,\nhelp to evade cyber defense behavioraldetection mechanisms, and dramatically\nincrease the odds of compromise. So in the\nMiddle East, the relative sophistication of an\nattack may be calculated less in the\ntechnology, and more in the clever ways in\nwhich malware is delivered and installed on a\ntarget network.\n\n\n-----\n\n**World War C: Understanding Nation-State Motives Behind Today’s Advanced Cyber Attacks**\n\n|Reconnaissance|Regional Mailing Lists, Conferences|\n|---|---|\n|Weaponization|Malicious PPT/PPS Files|\n|Delivery|Weaponized Email Attachments|\n|Exploitation|Social Engineering Mouse Clicks on Screen|\n|Installation|Primitive Collection of Custom Tools / RAT (Requires Operator For Lateral Movement)|\n|Command and Control (C2)|Plain HTTP; Hiding in Plain Sight|\n|Actions on Objectives|Intelligence Gathering (Middle East Focused), Denial of Service|\n|TTP Exemplars|Madi, LV|\n\n\n**Table 3: Characteristics of Middle Eastern cyber attacks**\n\n\n**Iran: a “hot” cyber war**\nWherever significant activity erupts in the real\nworld (including crime, espionage, and war­\nfare), parallel activity unfolds in cyberspace. It\n\n\nis therefore unsurprising that Iran—which has\ntense international relations and is on the\nverge of acquiring a nuclear bomb—has also\nexperienced the most sophisticated cyber\nattacks to date.\n\nIn 2010, Stuxnet was a “cyber missile” of sorts\ndesigned with painstaking precision to burrow\ndeep into Iran’s nuclear program and destroy\nphysical infrastructure. To some degree, this\npiece of software replaced a squadron of fighter\naircraft that would have violated foreign\nairspace, dropped laser-guided bombs, and left\na smoking crater in the Earth’s surface.[52]\nBeyond Stuxnet, other advanced espionage\nattacks have worried security experts, including\nDuqu, Flame, and Gauss, which all may have\ncome from the same threat actor.[53] And even\namateurs are successfully targeting Iran;\nalthough the “Mahdi” malware is by comparison\nfar less sophisticated than Stuxnet and its\ncousins, Mahdi has still managed to compromise\nengineering firms, government agencies,\nfinancial services firms, and academia through­\nout the Middle East.[54].\n\n\n52 Sanger, D.

Does the counter­\nstrike remain within the cyber realm, or can it\ncome in the form of a traditional military (or\nterrorist) assault? In 2012, Iran appears to have\nchosen the first option. A hacker group called the\n“Cutting Sword of Justice” used the “Shamoon”\nvirus to attack the Saudi Arabian national oil\ncompany Aramco, deleting data on three-quar­\nters of Aramco’s corporate PCs (including\ndocuments, spreadsheets, e-mails, and files) and\nreplacing them with an image of a burning\nAmerican flag.[55] And over the past year, another\ngroup called Izz ad-Din al-Qassam launched\n“Operation Ababil,” a series of DDoS attacks\nagainst many U.S. financial institutions including\nthe New York Stock Exchange.[56]\n\nOther examples of cyber attacks abound. In\n2009, the plans for a new U.S. Marine Corps 1\npresidential helicopter were found on a\nfile-sharing network in Iran.[57] In 2010, the\n“Iranian Cyber Army” disrupted Twitter and the\nChinese search engine Baidu, redirecting users\nto Iranian political messages.[58] In 2011, Iranian\nattackers compromised a Dutch digital certifi­\ncate authority, after which it issued more than\n500 fraudulent certificates for major compa­\nnies and government agencies.[59] In 2012, Iran\ndisrupted the BBC’s Persian Language Service,\nand University of Toronto researchers reported\nthat some versions of the Simurgh “proxy”\n\n\nsoftware (which is popular in countries like Iran\nand anonymizes Internet traffic) also installed a\nTrojan that collected usernames and key­\nstrokes, sending them to a likely intelligence\ncollection site.[60] Finally, in 2013 the Wall Street\nJournal reported that Iranian actors had\nincreased their efforts to compromise U.S.\ncritical infrastructure.[61]\n\n**Syria: what is the Syrian Electronic Army?**\nSyria is in the midst of a civil war, so researchers\nhave a lot of cyber activity to analyze. The most\nprominent hacker group by far is the Syrian\nElectronic Army (SEA), which is loyal to Syrian\nPresident Bashar al-Assad. SEA has conducted\nDDoS attacks, phishing, pro-Assad defacements,\nand spamming campaigns against governments,\nonline services, and media that are perceived to\nbe hostile to the Syrian government. SEA has\nhacked Al-Jazeera, Anonymous, Associated\nPress (AP), BBC, Daily Telegraph, Financial\nTimes, Guardian, Human Rights Watch, National\nPublic Radio, The New York Times, Twitter, and\nmore.[62] Its most famous exploit was a hoax\nannouncement using AP’s Twitter account that\nthe White House was bombed and President\nObama injured—after which stock markets\nbriefly dipped to the tune of $200 billion.[63].\n\n\n55 Perlroth, N.

If the\nrecipient falls for the scam, Trojan horse, remote\naccess tool (RAT) software is installed on the\nvictim’s computer that can give the attacker\nkeystrokes, screenshots, microphone and\nwebcam recordings, stolen documents, and\npasswords. And of course, the SEA likely sends\n\n\nall of this information to a computer address\nlying within Syrian government-controlled\nInternet Protocol (IP) space for intelligence\ncollection and review.[67]\n\n**Israel: old conflict, new tactics**\nEven during the Cold War, the Arab-Israeli\nconflict saw many hot wars, and it was often the\ntesting ground for new military weapons and\ntactics. Nothing has changed in the Internet era.\nSince at least 2000, pro-Israeli hackers have\ntargeted sites of political and military signifi­\ncance in the Middle East.[68] In 2007, Israel\nreportedly disrupted Syrian air defense networks\nvia cyber attack (with some collateral damage to\nits own domestic networks) to facilitate the\nIsraeli Air Force’s destruction of an alleged\nSyrian nuclear facility.[69]\n\n\n64 Khare, A.

(26 Nov 2007) “Israel’s Cyber Shot at Syria,” Defense Tech.\n\n\n-----\n\n**World War C: Understanding Nation-State Motives Behind Today’s Advanced Cyber Attacks**\n\nBut as an advanced industrial nation, Israel also\ndepends on information technology. The nation\nhas proven to be vulnerable to cyber attacks,\nwhich often target the Israeli economy. In\n2009, during Israel’s military operation in Gaza,\nhackers briefly paralyzed many government\nsites with a DDoS attack from at least 500,000\ncomputers. The 2009 attack consisted of four\nindependent waves, each stronger than the\nlast, peaking at 15 million junk mail deliveries\nper second. The Israeli “Home Front Command”\nwebsite, which plays a key role in national\ndefense communications with the public, was\ndown for three hours. Due to technical\nsimilarities with the 2008 cyber attack on\nGeorgia during its war with Russia, Israeli\nofficials surmised that the attack itself might\nhave been carried out by a criminal organiza­\ntion in the former Soviet Union, and paid for by\nHamas or Hezbollah.[70]\n\nOften, the trouble with cyber attacks is that\nthey do not need to be highly sophisticated to\nsucceed, even against security-conscious Israel.\nIn 2012, the ineptly written[71] “Mahdi” malware\ncompromised at least 54 targets in Israel.[72] Last\nbut not least, in 2013, the Iranian media\nreported that the Syrian army had carried out a\ncyber attack against the water supply of the\nIsraeli city of Haifa. Prof. Isaac Ben-Israel, a\ncyber security adviser to Prime Minister\nBenjamin Netanyahu, said that the report was\nfalse, but added that cyber attacks on critical\ninfrastructures pose a “real and present threat”\nto Israel.[73]\n\n\n#### The West\n\n**United States**\nAnalysts believe that the U.S. has conducted the\nmost highly engineered cyber attacks to date,\nincluding Stuxnet,74 Duqu, Flame, and Gauss.75\nThis family of malware is unparalleled in its\ncomplexity and targeting. Stuxnet in particular\nwas developed with a singular goal (to disrupt\nIranian nuclear enrichment) that was both\nnarrowly focused and capable of yielding strategic\ngains in the international arena. In contrast to\ncomputer worms such as Slammer and Code Red,\nStuxnet did not seek to compromise as many\ncomputers as possible, but as few as possible.\nEven more amazing, its malicious behavior was\nconcealed under a veneer of apparently legitimate\noperational data—but ultimately, the malware\ndestroyed Iranian centrifuges.\n\nThis family of malware was exquisitely designed.\nFor example, its payload can arrive at its destina­\ntion encrypted—and become decrypted and\ninstalled only on a target device. This helps the\nmalware to evade the prying eyes of cyber defend­\ners, making discovering and reverse engineering\nthe malware much more difficult.\n\nIronically, this family of malware could be a\nparagon of over-engineering. For example, it not\nonly uses multiple zero-day exploits, but also\nworld-first computational achievements such as a\n\n\n70 Pfeffer, A.

So the authors\nof Stuxnet could likely have used more conven­\ntional computer exploits and still succeeded.\n\nOne possible telling aspect of U.S. cyber attacks:\nthey require such a high level of financial\ninvestment, technical sophistication, and legal\noversight that they will stand out from the crowd.\nOn the last point, Richard Clarke, who served\nthree U.S. Presidents as a senior counterterrorism\nofficial, argued that Stuxnet was a U.S. operation\n\n\nbecause “it very much had the feel to it of having\nbeen written by or governed by a team of\nWashington lawyers.”[77] Finally, the amount of\nwork involved in these operations suggests the\nparticipation of an enormous defense\ncontractor base, with different companies\nspecializing in particular aspects of a large and\ncomplex undertaking.\n\nOn the downside (and similar to the Israeli case),\nall advanced industrial economies are vulnerable\nto cyber counterattack. In 2008, a CIA official\ninformed a conference of critical infrastructure\nproviders that unknown cybercriminals, on\nmultiple occasions, had been able to disrupt the\npower supply in various foreign cities.[78] In the\nmilitary domain, Iraqi insurgents used $26\noff-the-shelf software to intercept live video feeds\nfrom U.S. Predator drones, likely giving them the\nability to monitor and evade U.S. military\noperations.[79] In the economic sphere, the U.S.based International Monetary Fund (IMF) fell\nvictim to a phishing attack in 2011 that was\ndescribed as a “very major breach.”[80]\n\nThus, while cyber attacks are relatively a new\nphenomenon, they represent a growing national\nsecurity challenge. As part of a broader effort to\nmitigate the threat, President Obama signed a\ndirective in 2013 that the U.S. should aid allies\nwho come under foreign cyber attack.[81]\n\n\n77 Rosenbaum, R.

In 2011 alone,\nthe European Commission complained of wide­\nspread hacking before an EU summit,[90] the French\ngovernment was compromised prior to a G-20\nmeeting,[91] and at least 10 Norwegian defense and\nenergy companies were breached during largescale contract negotiations, via phishing that was\nspecifically tailored to each company.[92]\n\n\n82 Leyden, J.

This report sought to\nhighlight the same phenomenon in regard to the\nchallenges posed by national cyber insecurity\nand international cyber attacks. Behind every\nincident is an agenda—and individual human\nbeings—each unique and ultimately identifiable.\nThe bigger the cyber campaign, the more data it\ngenerates for security researchers, and the more\ndifficulty attackers will have remaining anony­\nmous and hiding their agenda.\n\nAs for crystal balls: no one knows what the next\ncyber attack will look like. But considering recent\ntrends, we can make a few educated guesses.\n\nHere are five factors that could change the\nworld’s cyber security landscape in the near- to\nmedium-term:\n\n**1.** **Outage of national critical infrastructure:**\nwe know that cyber attacks can disrupt\ngovernment networks, but most current cases\nsimply do not rise to the level of a national\nsecurity threat. Stuxnet—and Iran’s alleged\nretaliation against Saudi Aramco—has shifted\nthe thinking on cyber war from theory to\nsomething closer to reality. But have we seen\nthe limit of what cyber attacks can achieve, or\ncould cybercriminals threaten public safety by\ndowning a power grid or financial market?\n\n**2.** **Cyber arms treaty: if world leaders begin to**\nview cyber attacks as more of a liability than\nan opportunity, they may join a cyber arms\ncontrol regime or sign a non-aggression pact\nfor cyberspace. However, arms control\nrequires the ability to inspect for a prohibited\n\n\nitem. President Reagan’s favorite Russian\nproverb was доверяй, но проверяй, or\n“trust but verify.” Given that a single USB\nstick can now hold billions of bits of informa­\ntion, verifying would be easier said than done.\n\n**3.** **PRISM, freedom of speech, and privacy: we**\nare still at the dawn of the Internet era, and\nthis conversation has only just begun. It\nencompasses Daniel Ellsberg, Chelsea\nManning, and Edward Snowden, as well as\nthe Declaration of Independence, Enigma,\nand The Onion Router (TOR). Today,\npoliticians, spooks, and hippies are all aware\nof a critical debate on the horizon—just how\nmuch online privacy should we have?\n\n**4.** **New actors on the cyber stage: the**\nrevolutionary nature of computers and the\namplification power of networks are not\nexclusive to the world’s largest nations. Iran,\nSyria, North Korea, and even non-state\nactors such as Anonymous have employed\ncyber attacks as a way to conduct diplomacy\nand wage war by other means. Researchers\nhave little reason to think that other\ngovernments are not active in this domain.\nPossible candidates could be:\n\n**a. Poland: it was the Poles who first broke**\nthe German Enigma cipher—way back in\n1932!Today, with programming talent and\nwell-known rivalry with Russia, it is a\npossibility.\n\n**b. Brazil: Home to some of the world’s most**\nprolific cybercriminals, will Brazil’s govern­\nment, be angry about recent revelations of\nU.S. cyber spying, harness this talent for\ngeopolitical ends?\n\n\n-----\n\n**World War C: Understanding Nation-State Motives Behind Today’s Advanced Cyber Attacks**\n\n**c. Taiwan: with constant cyber attacks**\nemanating from Mainland China, Taipei may\nhave little choice but to react.\n\n**5.** **Stronger focus on evasion: as we have**\nseen, some nation-states know how to\nlaunch stealthy cyber attacks. But as the\ndiscipline of cyber defense matures, and\nas public awareness of the World War C\nphenomenon grows, some “noisy” cyber\nattackers such as China may be forced to\nraise their game by trying to fly under a\nmore finely tuned radar.\n\nThe analysis and conclusions drawn in this paper are\nconjectural. Cyber security, cyber espionage, and\ncyber war are new and rapidly evolving concepts.\nFurthermore, most computer network operations\nare shrouded in secrecy. Deception is a given.\n\n“A cyber attack, viewed outside of its geopolitical\ncontext, allows very little legal maneuvering room\nfor the defending state,” said Prof. Thomas\nWingfield of the Marshall Center, in a recent email\ninterview with FireEye. “False flag operations and\nthe very nature of the Internet make tactical\nattribution a losing game.”\n\nBut Wingfield adds that strategic attribution—fus­\ning all sources of intelligence on a potential\nthreat—allows a much higher level of confidence\nand more options for government decision\n\n\nmakers. “And strategic attribution begins and\nends with geopolitical analysis,” he said. With this\nin mind, we hope that an awareness of this World\nWar C dynamic helps cyber security profession­\nals better understand, identify, and combat cyber\nattacks in the future.\n\n#### About FireEye\nFireEye has invented a purpose-built, virtual\nmachine-based security platform that pro­\nvides real-time threat protection to enterpris­\nes and governments worldwide against the\nnext generation of cyber attacks. These highly\nsophisticated cyber attacks easily circumvent\ntraditional signature-based defenses, such as\nnext-generation firewalls, IPS, anti-virus, and\ngateways. The FireEye Threat Prevention Plat­\nform provides real-time, dynamic threat\nprotection without the use of signatures to\nprotect an organization across the primary\nthreat vectors, including Web, email, and files\nand across the different stages of\nan attack life cycle. The core of the FireEye\nplatform is a virtual execution engine, comple­\nmented by dynamic threat intelligence, to\nidentify and block cyber attacks in real time.\nFireEye has over 1,100 customers across\nmore than 40 countries, including over 100 of\nthe Fortune 500.\n\nFor more information on next-generation threat\n[protection, visit www.FireEye.com.](http://www.FireEye.com)\n\n\n[FireEye, Inc. | 1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035 | 408.321.6300 | 877.FIREEYE (347.3393) | info@fireeye.com | www.fireeye.com](mailto:info%40fireeye.com?subject=)\n\n© 2014 FireEye, Inc.
