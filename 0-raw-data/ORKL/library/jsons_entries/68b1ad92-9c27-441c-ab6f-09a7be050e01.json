This operation managed to remain under\nthe radar for a long time, as the associated files were not attributed to a known malware\nfamily and were only detected by a handful of security vendors.\n\nWhether it is an application that changes the device's background into ISIS-related images,\nor one that impersonates a legitimate Kurdish news agency, the malicious APKs used by\nthis actor were tailored for the use of specific ethnic groups. Those ethnic groups and\nminorities can be considered a natural enemy to the Islamic Republic of Iran: Kurds, ISIS\nsupporters, Sunni Muslims, and even Iranian citizens.\n\nOur suspicions of the attack's origin were confirmed when we were able to gain access to\nlogs that were uploaded from the victims' infected devices to the C2 servers. The\ninformation we gathered from those findings also revealed the true dimensions of the attack\nas well as its lifespan, with the earliest malicious instances dating back to 2016.\n\nIn our presentation, we will discuss the evolution of the mobile spyware, the Iranian\nfingerprints it carries, and the political motives behind the launch of such an attack. In\naddition, we will share never-before-seen insights into the data stolen from hundreds of\nvictims.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pW4pfIyfO_4\n\n## Related links\n\n[Domestic Kitten: An Iranian Surveillance Operation (Check Point)](https://research.checkpoint.com/domestic-kitten-an-iranian-surveillance-operation/)\n[Zooming In On \"Domestic Kitten\" (Check Point)](https://research.checkpoint.com/zooming-in-on-domestic-kitten/)\n[Mobile Cyberespionage Campaign ‘Bouncing Golf’ Affects Middle East (Trend Micro)](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mobile-cyberespionage-campaign-bouncing-golf-affects-middle-east/)\n\n**Aseel Kayal**\n\nAseel is a malware analyst at Check Point Research.
