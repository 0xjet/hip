Other disguised software\ninstallers include WhatsApp, Adobe Flash Player, and Google Chrome.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese packages act as a first-stage loader, triggering an infection sequence that leads to the\ndeployment of a second-stage payload from a remote server and culminating in the execution of a\nbinary that inherits its features from FatalRAT.\n\n[FatalRAT is a C++-based implant designed to run commands and exfiltrate sensitive information](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/new-sophisticated-rat-in-town-fatalrat-analysis)\nback to a remote server, with the malware authors incrementally updating the backdoor with new\nfunctionality.\n\n\"The RAT is responsible for loading and executing the auxiliary modules based on checks\nperformed on the victim systems,\" the researchers said. \"Changes can happen if specific [antivirus]\nagents are running or if registry keys are found. The auxiliary modules are intended as support for\nthe group's specific objectives.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, Purple Fox, which comes with a rootkit module, comes with support for five different\ncommands, including copying and deleting files from the kernel as well as evading antivirus engines\nby intercepting calls sent to the file system.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nThe findings also follow recent disclosures from cybersecurity firm Avast, which detailed a new\ncampaign that involved the Purple Fox exploitation framework acting as a deployment channel for\n[another botnet called DirtyMoe.](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/dirtymoe-botnet-gains-new-exploits-in.html)\n\n\"Operators of the Purple Fox botnet are still active and consistently updating their arsenal with new\nmalware, while also upgrading the malware variants they have,\" the researchers said. \"They are\nalso trying to improve their signed rootkit arsenal for [antivirus] evasion and trying to bypass\ndetection mechanisms by targeting them with customized signed kernel drivers.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
