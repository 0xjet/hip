The crisis has brought both new threats and an influx of actors\n“of varying skill,” Cisco said.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, the cyber-warzone has entailed the Conti ransomware gang s secrets getting\n[spilled (including a decryptor and TrickBot code) by a pro-Ukrainian member; furious](https://threatpost.com/conti-ransomware-decryptor-trickbot-source-code-leaked/178727/)\n[phishing campaigns launched against Ukraine and those aiding Ukrainian refugees; the](https://threatpost.com/russian-apts-phishing-ukraine-google/178819/)\n[novel FoxBlade trojan; DDoS](https://threatpost.com/microsoft-ukraine-foxblade-trojan-hours-before-russian-invasion/178702/) [attacks against Ukraine’s military and economy; campaigns](https://threatpost.com/ukrainian-ddos-attacks-should-put-us-on-notice-researchers/178498/)\n[using multiple destructive wipers; hackers affiliating themselves with the Anonymous](https://threatpost.com/destructive-wiper-ukraine/177768/)\n[collective hijacking Russian cameras; and more.](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4466470)\n\n[“Many of these changes have been brought about by the rise in attacks being outsourced to](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1497642156076511233)\nsympathetic people on the internet, which brings about its own unique challenges and\nthreats,” Cisco [outlined. The threat advisory referenced a tweet exhorting people to join an IT](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/ukraine-update.html)\narmy to fight on the cyber-front.\n\nWe are creating an IT army. We need digital talents. All operational tasks will be given\nhere: [https://t.co/Ie4ESfxoSn. There will be tasks for everyone. We continue to fight on](https://t.co/Ie4ESfxoSn)\nthe cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists.\n\n[— Mykhailo Fedorov (@FedorovMykhailo) February 26, 2022](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1497642156076511233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**See Also:** **[Kali Linux 2022.1 Release with Visual Updates, New Tools, Legacy SSH](https://www.blackhatethicalhacking.com/news/kali-linux-2022-1-release-with-visual-updates-new-tools-legacy-ssh/)**\n\nSoldiers on the frontlines get shot at, of course, and soldiers on the cyber-frontlines run the\nrisk of getting arrested. After all, no matter how noble the hacking cause, it’s still potentially\nillegal, Cisco pointed out.\n\n## ‘Legitimate’ Disbalancer Liberator DDoS Tool\n\nThe malware in the Telegram message brands itself as a “Disbalancer” .ZIP file. There is, in\nfact, a group called “disBalancer” that distributes a “legitimate” DDoS attack tool called,\nironically enough, Liberator, Cisco found – a tool for waging cyberwar against “Russian\npropaganda websites.”\n\n“A quick look at disBalancer’s website shows that the actor uses similar language to the\nmalicious message on Telegram…and promises to target Russian sites with the stated goal\nof helping to ‘liberate’ Ukraine,” according to Cisco’s writeup.\n\nThe security company offered a screenshot of the brandjacking Disbalancer Liberator\nwebsite, shown below. As Cisco pointed out, there’s a typo in the group’s name, which is\nrendered as “disBalancher.”\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot from Disbalancer Liberator website. Source: Cisco Talos.\n\ndisBalancer’s tool – Disbalancer.exe – is sincerely meant to DDoS Russia. The infostealer\ncampaign, on the other hand, is based on a dropper disguised as that tool. It’s protected with\nASProtect, Cisco said, a known packer for Windows executables.\n\n“If a researcher tries to debug the malware execution, it will be confronted with a general\nerror. The malware, after performing the anti-debug checks, will launch Regsvcs.exe, which\nis included along with the .NET framework,” according to the writeup. “In this case, the\nregsvcs.exe is not used as a living off the land binary (LoLBin). It is injected with the\nmalicious code, which consists of the Phoenix information stealer.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe actors behind this campaign aren t the newbies flocking to the front lines. Rather,\nevidence shows that they’ve been distributing infostealers since at least November, Cisco\nsaid, as evidenced by the fact that the infostealer exfiltrates stolen info to a remote IP\naddress – in this case, a Russian IP — 95[.]142.46.35 — on port 6666.\n\nThat IP/port pair “has been distributing infostealers since at least November 2021,”\nresearchers said. The longevity of the pairing enforces researchers’ belief that these are\nexperienced actors at work, taking advantage of the Ukraine calamity, rather than threat\nactors new to the scene.\n\nThe infostealer is hoovering up a broad array of information, Cisco said. “The .ZIP file\nprovided in the Telegram channel contains an executable, which is the infostealer,” according\nto the report. “The infostealer gathers information from a variety of sources, including web\nbrowsers like Firefox and Chrome and other locations on the filesystem for key pieces of\ninformation.”\n\n**See Also:** **[Offensive Security Tool: Scapy](https://www.blackhatethicalhacking.com/tools/scapy/)**\n\nThe researchers provided a deobfuscated screen capture, replicated below, showing how the\npilfered info is sent with a simple base64 encoding. The screen grab shows the breadth of\ninformation being pulled off of infected systems, including a large number of crypto wallets\nand information on MetaMask. “A .ZIP file of the stolen data is also uploaded to the server,\ncompleting the compromise,” Cisco said.\n\n\n-----\n\nSample data exfiltrated to server. Source: Cisco Talos.\n\n## Don’t Eat That: You Don’t Know Where It’s Been\n\nThe infostealer masquerading as a DDoS tool to attack Russian targets is just one example\nof the many ways cybercriminals are milking the invasion for social-engineering sustenance,\nexploiting sympathizers on both sides. “Such activity could take the form of themed email\nlures on news topics or donation solicitations, malicious links purporting to host relief funds\nor refugee support sites, malware masquerading as security defensive or offensive tools, and\nmore,” researchers suggested.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this case, cybercriminals were distributing an infostealer in an apparently profit-motivated\ncampaign. It could have been worse, though, according to the report: “It could have just as\neasily been a more sophisticated state-sponsored actor or privateer group doing work on\nbehalf of a nation-state.”\n\nExpect this type of situational exploitation to continue and to diversify, Cisco predicted: “The\nglobal interest in the conflict creates a massive potential victim pool for threat actors and also\ncontributes to a growing number of people interested in carrying out their own offensive\ncyber operations.”\n\nCisco reminded users to essentially avoid eating food that’s been dropped on the floor. You\ndon’t know where that stuff’s been, researchers warned, so be wary of installing software\n“whose origins are unknown, especially software that is being dropped into random chat\nrooms on the internet.”\n\nAs always, carefully inspect suspicious emails before opening attachments, Cisco advised,\nand validate software or other files before downloading.\n\n_Are u a security researcher?
