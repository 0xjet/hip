The company says it discovered the first clues of its existence\nlast week, around July 17.\n\n[But fellow security firm Malwarebytes, which released an adjacent report that focused](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/07/hidden-bee-miner-delivered-via-improved-drive-by-download-toolkit/)\nmainly on the coinminer malware spread by Underminer, says it tracked down earlier signs\n[of this EK's activity dating back to late 2017 when it was first mentioned by Chinese security](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fbobao.360.cn%2Finterref%2Fdetail%2F248.html&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab)\nfirm Qihoo 360.\n\nThe EK appears to have spent quite a few months operating at a smaller scale before\nexpanding its activity to other countries.\n\nAccording to Trend Micro, most of the web traffic flowing into Underminer is from Japan\n(70%), while the rest comes from Taiwan (10%), South Korea (6%), and other countries with\nsmaller percentages.\n\n\n-----\n\n## EK uses a small number of exploits\n\nAt the technical level, the exploit kit is still small in terms of the number of exploits it deploys\nto infect users with malware. Researchers have spotted only three. They are:\n\n**CVE-2015-5119 —a use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player patched in July 2015**\n**CVE-2016-0189 —a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer (IE) patched in**\nMay 2016\n**CVE-2018-4878 —a use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player patched in February**\n2018\n\nNone is specific to Underminer, and all have been used by other EKs in the past,\nsuggesting the EK authors have built their operation by copying the ones before it.\n\n## Underminer has been deploying Hidden Bee malware\n\nAs for the malware delivery mechanism used in recent campaigns, the EK has been seen\nusing encrypted TCP tunnels to deploy a bootkit first —for OS persistence— and then a\ncoinminer.\n\nTrend Micro calls this coinminer \"Hidden Mellifera,\" while Malwarebytes refers to it as\n\"Hidden Bee,\" the same name it received in the Chinese infosec community last year, when\n[it was first spotted and analyzed [1,](http://www.freebuf.com/column/174581.html) [2].](http://www.freebuf.com/column/175106.html)\n\nExploit kits have been on a downward trend in the past two-three years, and usually\n[keeping an up-to-date browser and OS is enough to safeguard users from getting infected.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/an-up-to-date-browser-should-keep-users-safe-from-most-exploit-kits/)\n\nA few new exploits pop up on the market once in a while, but all are short-lived, as they\nhave a hard time keeping their operation at profitable levels, mainly because modern\nbrowsers are harder and harder to hack, while Flash usage has gone down in recent years\n\n[[1,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chrome-flash-usage-declines-from-80-percent-in-2014-to-under-8-percent-today/) [2].](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/flash-used-on-5-percent-of-all-websites-down-from-285-percent-seven-years-ago/)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[RIG Exploit Kit drops RedLine malware via Internet Explorer bug](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rig-exploit-kit-drops-redline-malware-via-internet-explorer-bug/)\n\n[Lenovo UEFI firmware driver bugs affect over 100 laptop models](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lenovo-uefi-firmware-driver-bugs-affect-over-100-laptop-models/)\n\n[Hackers exploit critical VMware CVE-2022-22954 bug, patch now](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-critical-vmware-cve-2022-22954-bug-patch-now/)\n\n[Bootkit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bootkit/)\n[Coinminer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/coinminer/)\n[Exploit Kit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/exploit-kit/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
