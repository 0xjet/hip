CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks this activity cluster under the name\nDarkOxide.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has not yet determined the motivation of this activity cluster, but its\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and target scope indicate it is more likely focused on\nthe theft of sensitive information than on direct financial gain.\n\n## Telltale TTPs Reveal a Cluster of Activity\n\nThe DarkOxide cluster exhibits a very specific set of TTPs that have changed very little over the\nlast two years.\n\nInitially, the actor engages a target via a business-oriented social media platform under the\nguise of carrying out a recruitment drive (to read more about this technique, see\n[https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003/). The target is then encouraged to download a](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003/)\nlure document purportedly relating to a job opening. In reality, this file is a malicious executable\n\n\n-----\n\nwith a double file extension. The executables in these lures have used non-standard executable\nfile extensions such as .PIF (program information file) and .SCR (screensaver). As Windows, by\ndefault, hides the extension of known file types, these files initially appear to be legitimate\ndocument files when viewed in Windows File Explorer.\n\nTo date, the targets of the phishing attacks have included engineering staff with access to\nsensitive documents and source code, indicating that theft of intellectual property is the likely\nmotivation for these operations.\n\nThe following screenshot shows the detection that appears in the CrowdStrike Falcon UI when a\nvictim runs one of these malicious screensaver files. In this case, the customer had enabled\npreventions, allowing the pattern of activity to be recognized by the sensor and terminated\nbefore the actor could complete the installation of their remote access software.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nWhen the payload is executed, it utilizes a number of scripting interfaces, including PowerShell\nand Visual Basic Script, to download a further malicious binary executable. This second\nexecutable, also with a .PIF or .SCR extension, in turn installs a copy of the legitimate remote\naccess tool, [Remote Utilities, with a preconfigured command-and-control (C2) address. In a](https://www.remoteutilities.com/download/)\nsmall number of cases in addition to Remote Utilities, the actor also installed the Total Manager\nPro file manager. It is likely that this was in order to conduct file system searches, or to package\nfiles for exfiltration.\n\nAlthough the Remote Utilities binary, `rutserv.exe, is a legitimate signed binary, its use is`\nrelatively rare across CrowdStrike’s customer set.\n\nAs of at least March 2020, this TTP has been slightly modified, removing the first stage\ndownloader and moving directly from the initial phishing attack to the installation of the Remote\nUtilities software.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following table shows how these TTPs have been shared across a number of intrusions\nand how they map to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.\n\nIn June 2021, the cluster was observed deploying additional tooling to a host. Again these tools\nwere commercial off-the-shelf software. The tooling observed included:\n\nTotal Spy: a commercial spyware suite with capabilities including keylogging, screen\ncapture, messaging capture and social network capture\nRDP Wrapper: an open source tool allowing RDP access to the host\nDWServe: an open source tool allowing the host to be remotely controlled from a web\nbrowser\n\nIn almost all cases, the cluster’s activity has been frustrated, either by preventions enabled by\nthe customer, or by early notifications from Falcon OverWatch, allowing the affected systems to\nbe contained before the actor could take further actions on objectives. In the single case where\nfollow-up activity was observed, it consisted of modifications to the registry in order to allow\nfurther access to the host via Remote Desktop Protocol. (To read more about these techniques\nsee: [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/ and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/) [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/.)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/)\n\nSince CrowdStrike began tracking DarkOxide, the activity cluster has continued to conduct\noperations against a number of semiconductor companies, almost exclusively located within the\nSouth Asia region.\n\n## Your Best Defense Against DarkOxide\n\nOver the past two years, Falcon OverWatch, alongside CrowdStrike Intelligence, has been\ntracking an activity cluster, DarkOxide, actively targeting the semiconductor industry. Although\nthe actor’s TTPs have remained largely consistent, they have demonstrated the capacity to\n\n\n-----\n\nadapt and improve their processes, having recently streamlined their activity by removing the\nneed for a first-stage downloader in their intrusion process.\n\nDefenders in the semiconductor industry should be particularly alert to this activity, which drives\nhome the need to enlist end users as the first line of defense. The actor is actively targeting\nemployees via social media to gain initial access. Well-trained staff can be an asset in\ncombating the continued threat of phishing and related social engineering techniques.\n\nAs noted above, the Falcon platform can identify and prevent actors’ use of malicious files with\ndouble extensions, but it is crucial the sensor is rolled out across the environment with\nappropriate prevention settings turned on. Defenders can slow down malicious activity by\nemploying strict user account management based on the principle of least privilege.\n\nFinally, but most crucially, this activity shows the lengths to which threat actors go in their\nattempt to evade automated detections. Whether by gaining access through phishing activities,\nor by using legitimate tooling to achieve actions on objectives, threat actors are always looking\nfor new ways to pierce an organization’s defenses. A managed threat hunting service, like\nFalcon OverWatch, provides the continuous monitoring that is required to identify and disrupt\nmalicious activity before the damage is done.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### First Stage Payload\n\n**SHA256 Hash** **Lure**\n**Filename**\n\n48c19ad7436f3d311e9e63327801d0a2d6d25c0d7c7bbc3d2c6a32afb95a0187 Final.exe\n\n9d34f653edf948d9f46522081ff00dddf2f4b62b18d138c49e3b281ca953aeb1 Resume\npdf.pif\n\n1fcb6b54b17a6c3df0047a48280b4dcab8b2f2cad2ef4b8c802b05119cedce42 Talent\nRecruitment\nWeb meeting\nsystem.pif\n\n6d1480cd5b10739af130850f9d9bfa7ebe50024c5db68dd231bc7e4bd560ffa6 msi6.9.pif\n\n9d68049510581ff4827fd72510c59d685ce54609b07733be17492bf2403442b4 Job\ndescription\nsr.scr\n\nb414dca98e117d3755903ff27ffc07880f1fe2bfabfb49f6956cf82c06f4eab1 Job\ndescription\nsr.scr\n\n\n-----\n\n8045f3e00e52c663ab942f39ec779ffc7ac90197ece8e574e5a70c422aa32b36 Job detail\ndescription.scr\n\n49fbf9884299fbc6b09e640449fdc834f82a752908d381a68e2057a9861e3618 Job\ndescription.scr\n\n186a7abdfcc2df113148650eb1673620a11bb8bfcf3c53f8a1c7429703cda715 Job detail\ndescription.scr\n\n45e6653af40fb838eae0657a34905d5ba36052bd41819873d2afc240874b14b6 Qualcomm\nJob\ndescription\nIndia.scr\n\n041398a0d34794df5b8d22683f5be7991647416f6243c7bc0441abd7c71c7c27 Qualcomm\nJob details.scr\n\n### Second Stage Payload\n\n**SHA256 Hash** **Filename**\n\n9d34f653edf948d9f46522081ff00dddf2f4b62b18d138c49e3b281ca953aeb1 one.pif\n\n### Legitimate Binaries Observed\n\n**SHA256 Hash** **Filename**\n\n5ada6d1fd62bb1740ea80a30788e55988758acc2b835e6835d6524af1e7afcbd rutserv.exe\n\nC295bd2653d6d8752ff5805b4114eee8e4370a0f16e922d81aecc5f49fa8c9c9 rfusclient.exe\n\n966ef76fe3476d530b1b97a6f40947ed14ada378f13e44ecfe774edc998cd0b0 srvinst.exe\n\n798af20db39280f90a1d35f2ac2c1d62124d1f5218a2a0fa29d87a13340bd3e4 rdpwrap.dll\n\n07935229c213d1735655cc8453daa29718da2656546e05d5b3990cb49c248b98 RDPWInst.exe\n\n43fbae4f6637c8eaa955db7e394eebd39cd261f91f36a5bc646303f123e68f13 tsmon.exe\n\n39235102a3aeeb88678cad8d841292fc17ec3b0551cf57d755fdd523985567e8 tsmon4.exe\n\n1ad4b06e282e3c3f22c6d194dabdc272215154f004c57b93b3882c161efc5279 tsmon5.exe\n\n4515d7ee0d5e2e2e236499d35a154b427f07124e9edd379b6e9d62af2ae88c4d tsmon6.exe\n\n### Hard-Coded Command and Control for Remote Utilities\n\n54.149.69[.]226\n54.188.107[.]146\n60.254.95[.]183\n\n\n-----\n\n34.221.96[.]116\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_Download the newly released Falcon OverWatch annual report, 2021 Threat Hunting_\n_Report: Insights From the Falcon OverWatch Team._\n_Find out more about adversaries that CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks in the CrowdStrike_\n_Adversary Universe._\n_[Learn about the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/)_\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ and see for yourself how true](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_next-gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
