    "plain_text": "**When news of the Anthem breach was reported on February 4th, 2015, the security**\n\n**industry quite understandably went wild. A breach of this magnitude was certainly**\n\n**unprecedented. Naturally, many industry professionals were keenly interested in**\n\n**digging into this incident to see what could be uncovered, and the research team at**\n\n**[ThreatConnect was no exception. Thanks to our powerful API and third-party](http://www.threatconnect.com/product/threatconnect_API)**\n\n**[partner integrations, we were able to use ThreatConnect to quickly uncover a](http://www.threatconnect.com/partners)**\n\n**wealth of intelligence even when initially hindered by a relative lack of investigative**\n\n**lead information and context, a key requirement of any** **Threat Intelligence**\n\n**Platform (TIP). However, before we delve into what we were able to uncover, let’s**\n\n**briefly review the facts as they stood in the wake of the initial discovery�**\n\n**announcement.**\n\n## What We Know:                        \n\n#### On the morning of February 4th, 2015, several major news outlets broke the story that Anthem, Inc.’s network defenses had been\n\n\n**FEBRUARY 27, 2015**\n\n# The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China\n\n**[IN THREAT RESEARCH BY THREATCONNECT RESEARCH TEAM](https://www.threatconnect.com/category/threat-research-tcirt/)**\n\n**[UPDATE: Premera Latest Healthcare Insurance](http://www.threatconnect.com/news/premera-latest-healthcare-insurance-agency-to-be-breached?utm_campaign=Anthem-Hack-Blog-Post&utm_source=from-anthem-post)** **Agency to be Breached**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### a statement from Anthem’s CEO, the company fell victim to a “very sophisticated external cyber attack,” and the hackers “obtained” the personally identifiable� information (PII) of approximately 80M customers. This included social security numbers, birthdays, street addresses, phone numbers and income data – plenty of information to enable identity theft. This was a significant event for several reasons:�\n\n**Anthem, formerly known as Wellpoint, is the largest managed healthcare**\n\n**company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and by extension, one of the**\n\n**largest healthcare organizations in the United States. As such, any compromise,**\n\n**no matter how insignificant, would likely impact countless individuals.�**\n\n**Blue Cross Blue Shield provides healthcare coverage for about half the U.S.**\n\n**federal workforce. This means that their information was potentially compromised**\n\n**too.**\n\n**Unlike the Sony hack which was destructive in nature and meant to send a**\n\n**message for coercive purposes, the Anthem compromise was purportedly very**\n\n**covert, a fact which may suggest something about the adversary’s motives.**\n\n**As of late February 2015, there have not been any indications that the exfiltrated�**\n\n**PII data was immediately commoditized on the black market for the purpose of**\n\n**enabling identity theft, as was the case in the Home Depot Breach.**\n\n## Filling the Gaps:\n\n**Obviously, these high-level observations do not provide cybersecurity researchers a**\n\n**great deal of information to work with. However, when presented within the context**\n\n\n-----\n\n**analytic objectives. To this end, let’s examine what we wanted to discover in the**\n\n**context of the Anthem breach:**\n\n**Who was responsible for the attack?**\n\n**What was the objective of the attack? Was it cyber theft, an espionage operation,**\n\n**or something different?**\n\n**Who was targeted in the attack? The answer to this question, obscured as it may**\n\n**be, would likely shed some light on the objective of the breach.**\n\n**What was the timeline of the activity?**\n\n**The real power of a Threat Intelligence Platform is demonstrated when you are able**\n\n**to collect and maintain a robust dataset of threat indicators, both past and present,**\n\n**which can help orient you in the right direction in the wake of a newly discovered**\n\n**breach. Even when you do not have a good deal of information to start with (for**\n\n**example a file hash, or an IP address), you may find leads by pivoting through�**\n\n**archived datasets until you uncover key pieces of the puzzle. In the case of the**\n\n**Anthem breach, we were able to do just that.**\n\n## Anthem Themed Infrastructure & Signed Malware:\n\n**In September 2014, the** **[ThreatConnect Research Team observed a variant of the](http://threatconnect.com/why_threat_connect/threatconnect_intelligence_research_team)**\n\n**[Derusbi APT malware family, MD5: 0A9545F9FC7A6D8596CF07A59F400FD3,](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/77421106548e69e9666c538ad628918cad7cfcf8f6aa7825f71a4fc39e522a7d/analysis/)**\n\n**which was signed by a valid digital signature from the Korean company**\n\n**DTOPTOOLZ Co. Derusbi is a family of malware used by multiple actor groups but**\n\n**associated exclusively with Chinese APT. ThreatConnect Research began tracking**\n\n**the DTOPTOOLZ signature for additional signed malware samples and**\n\n**memorialized them within our Threat Intelligence Platform over time.**\n\n**_Analyst Comment: The DTOPTOOLZ signature has also been observed in_**\n\n**_association with Korean Adware that is affiliated with the actual DTOPTOOLZ Co.�_**\n\n**_This adware should not be confused with the APT malware that is abusing the same_**\n\n**_digital signature._**\n\n**Later, in mid-November we discovered another implant that was digitally signed**\n\n**with the DTOPTOOLZ signature. This implant, MD5:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**communicate with the malicious command and control (C2) domains**\n\n**extcitrix.we11point[.]com and www.we11point[.]com. Through our Farsight**\n\n**[Security passive DNS integration, we uncovered that this malicious infrastructure](http://www.threatconnect.com/news/press-releases/cyber-squared-inc-announces-expansion-data-services-powerful-domain-passive-dns-intelligence/)**\n\n**was likely named in such a way to impersonate the legitimate Wellpoint IT**\n\n**infrastructure.**\n\n**Passive DNS and historic DomainTools Whois data also provided insights that**\n\n**helped establish an initial timeline dating back to April 2014, when the faux domains**\n\n**came into existence and were later operationalized by the attackers. A Threat**\n\n**Intelligence Platform should allow for analysts to easily put together and organize**\n\n**such insights, collaborate around relevant analysis internally, and share the finished�**\n\n**analysis with external industry groups and organizations. In the hopes that our**\n\n**community members could benefit from or provide further insight into this suspicious�**\n\n**incident, we immediately shared our threat intelligence including indicators,**\n\n**signatures and analytical context to the ThreatConnect Medical and Health**\n\n**Community on November 13, 2014. This included sending out a notification to all�**\n\n**[stakeholders as well as our followers on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/threatconnect)**\n\n**When the Anthem breach later came to light in early February, we re-shared the**\n\n**signatures, indicators and context freely to the entire ThreatConnect user base. As**\n\n**we dug further, we expanded our understanding of the malicious we11point[.]com**\n\n**infrastructure, taking particular interest to the subdomains such as**\n\n**“extcitrix.we11point[.]com and “hrsolutions.we11point[.]com”. Note the “citrix” and**\n\n**“hr” (human resources) prefixes that the adversary used to mirror legitimate remote�**\n\n**infrastructure and employee benefits resources in the May 2014 timeframe. This�**\n\n**provided initial insights as to the likely targeting themes and or vectors in which the**\n\n**adversary may have used when initiating their targeting campaign.**\n\n**The fact that the malicious infrastructure closely mirrored other legitimate Wellpoint**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Possible Premera Blue Cross Infrastructure:\n\n**Retrospective analysis of other targeted malware samples using the DTOPTOOLZ**\n\n**Co. digital signature led to the identification of an “HttpBrowser” / “HttpDump”�**\n\n**[implant MD5: 02FAB24461956458D70AEED1A028EB9C (OpenOfficePlugin.exe),�](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/3fe208273288fc4d8db1bf20078d550e321d9bc5b9ab80c93d79d2cb05cbf8c2/analysis/)**\n\n**which was first observed on December 11, 2013. Although this malware sample is�**\n\n**not Derusbi / Sakula, it too is strongly believed to be associated with Chinese APT**\n\n**activity and in fact may have also been involved in a Blue Cross Blue Shield**\n\n**targeting campaign as early as December 2013.**\n\n**This particular binary is configured to connect to the static IP address�**\n\n**142.91.76[.]134.

It is believed that the prennera[.]com domain may have**\n\n**been impersonating the Healthcare provider** **[Premera Blue Cross, where the](http://www.premera.com)**\n\n**attackers used the same character replacement technique by replacing the “m” with**\n\n\n-----\n\n**five months later with the we11point[.]com command and control infrastructure.�**\n\n#### Section Summary:\n\n**The Derusbi / Sakula malware implant types are unique in that they have**\n\n**traditionally been seen within Chinese APT espionage campaigns.**\n\n**The “HttpBrowser” / “HttpDump” malware implant (while a different family of**\n\n**malware than Derusbi / Sakula) is also believed to be of Chinese origin, and was**\n\n**also digitally signed with the DTOPTOOLZ digitalsignature. This implant**\n\n**connected to a C2 node that overlapped with prennera[.]com.**\n\n**We believe that the prennera[.]com domain may be impersonating Premera Blue**\n\n**Cross (premera.com), using a similar character replacement technique seen in**\n\n**the we11point[.]com campaign.**\n\n## VAE Inc. Themed Infrastructure & Signed Malware\n\n**Another powerful attribute of ThreatConnect is the ability for analysts to logically**\n\n**group items such as atomic indicators, related documents or signatures, all of which**\n\n**may include individualized custom context enrichments and associations. Over time,**\n\n**the ability to memorialize groupings of related or like activity allows analysts to**\n\n**quickly uncover non-obvious relationships within their private datasets. This is**\n\n**exactly what happened as we continued to investigate these incidents.**\n\n**As industry analysts and media** **[speculated Chinese APT involvement in the Anthem](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/investigators-suspect-china-may-be-responsible-for-hack-of-anthem/2015/02/05/25fbb36e-ad56-11e4-9c91-e9d2f9fde644_story.html)**\n\n**breach, our focus into the Derusbi / Sakula malware signed with the DTOPTOOLZ**\n\n**Co. digital signature shifted from the we11point[.]com incident to another cluster of**\n\n**activity that occurred later in May 2014. We immediately reviewed Incident**\n\n**[20140526B: vaeit APT, an incident that we initially shared to our Subscriber](https://app.threatconnect.com/tc/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=708926)**\n\n**Community on September 29, 2014 after conducting retrospective analysis.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Just as was the case with the we11point[.]com and prennera[.]com incidents, the**\n\n**VAE, Inc. incident is also believed to be associated with Chinese APT espionage**\n\n**activity. In this case the adversary also used Derusbi / Sakula malware that was**\n\n**signed with the DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital signature and configured to communicate�**\n\n**with faux infrastructure appearing to be masquerading as internal resources for the**\n\n**Department of Defense Contractor VAE, Inc. Additionally, in response to an inquiry**\n\n**[from KrebsOnSecurity, VAE, Inc. would later confirm that it had indeed been a target�](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/anthem-breach-may-have-started-in-april-2014/)**\n\n**of a failed spearphishing attempt in May 2014 which used the malicious faux VAE,**\n\n**Inc. themed domain.**\n\n**The targeted incident relied upon the Sakula executable MD5:**\n\n**[230D8A7A60A07DF28A291B13DDF3351F which had a XOR 0x9A encoded C2](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d4be6c9117db9de21138ae26d1d0c3cfb38fd7a19fa07c828731fa2ac756ef8d/analysis/)**\n\n**callbacks to the IP address 192.199.254[.]126 (registered to Wehostwebsites[.]com**\n\n**– “Tom Yu” of Baoan, Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China) as well as a**\n\n**hardcoded callback to sharepoint-vaeit[.]com. Passive DNS of the static C2 IP**\n\n**192.199.254[.]126 revealed a single suspicious domain of interest –**\n\n**topsec2014[.]com. This domain had historic resolution around May 8, 2014 within a**\n\n**month of the first observed Sakula activity using the IP 192.199.254[.]126 as C2.�**\n\n**Using historic Whois, we discovered that topsec2014[.]com was initially registered**\n\n**by li2384826402@yahoo[.]com on May 6th, 2014. Although the**\n\n**li2384826402@yahoo[.]com registrant is likely a reseller given that it has been**\n\n**observed registering several thousands of other domains the fact that it was used**\n\n\n-----\n\n**topsec2014[.]com within the same month suggests that there may be a relationship**\n\n**between the client of the reseller for the VAE, Inc. infrastructure and the client for**\n\n**topsec2014[.]com.**\n\n**Just four minutes after the initial registration of topsec2014[.]com, the Whois**\n\n**records were updated from the initial registrant, Li Ning –**\n\n**li2384826402@yahoo[.]com to TopSec China – TopSec_2014@163[.]com. This**\n\n**domain record has been unchanged since May 7th 2014. The we11point[.]com**\n\n**infrastructure and by extension the faux VAE Inc. infrastructure is associated with**\n\n**[Cluster 2 of the ScanBox framework by PwC. The latest PwC update to ScanBox](http://pwc.blogs.com/files/cto-tib-20150223-01a.pdf)**\n\n**states that there are “links between the domain allegedly used in the Anthem hack**\n\n**_(we11point.com) to Cluster 2 through shared WHOIS details.”_**\n\n#### OPM Themed Infrastructure\n\n**One notable pattern was how the domain Whois registration information for the**\n\n**VAE, Inc. themed infrastructure was quickly updated and obfuscated with**\n\n**pseudorandom 10 character gmx.com email addresses and using the names of**\n\n**various comic book characters from the Iron Man franchise.

Rather, we**\n\n**suspect that the FBI flash report likely references the USIS breach that was�**\n\n**[announced on August 6, 2014, or the previous OPM breach, considering the](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/dhs-contractor-suffers-major-computer-breach-officials-say/2014/08/06/8ed131b4-1d89-11e4-ae54-0cfe1f974f8a_story.html)**\n\n**statement that the breach involved “compromised and stolen sensitive business**\n\n**_information and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from US commercial and�_**\n\n**_government networks through cyber espionage.”_**\n\n**The malware referenced within the FBI Report is associated with a Derusbi**\n\n**backdoor subvariant named “InfoAdmin” / “Kakfum” where the FBI specifically�**\n\n**references open source reporting of “Deep Panda” as being related to the malware**\n\n**observed in the attack. The malicious infrastructure highlighted in the report are the**\n\n**domains images.googlewebcache[.]com and smtp.outlookssl[.]com.

Additionally, an FBI Flash**\n\n**Report 0000-49MW referenced indicators that were possibly associated with the**\n\n**USIS hack and a Derusbi variant called “Kakfum” / “InfoAdmin”.

A keyword search returned several**\n\n**results for “topsec2014@163[.]com” in association with a number of academic**\n\n**institutions in Nanjing, China. Although the email address wasn’t an exact match to**\n\n**the topsec2014[.]com domain registrant (notice the absence of the underscore),**\n\n**such a similarity warranted further investigation.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**We examined the links for any relevant intelligence, and discovered that nearly all of**\n\n**the search results led to pages that contained an announcement for an information**\n\n**security competition sponsored by the Southeast University-Topsec Information**\n\n**Security and Mobile Internet Technology Joint Research Center. This entity**\n\n**appears to be a joint research venture between the University and Chinese**\n\n**networking giant Beijing Topsec Network Security Technology Co., a.k.a.

The real smoking gun,**\n\n**however, was when we began to notice a strong temporal overlap with the various**\n\n**stages of the TOPSEC Cup that Song and Beijing Topsec were organizing, and the**\n\n**registration dates of malicious infrastructure as well as the malware compilation**\n\n**dates.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Based upon the translated registration form that we obtained from Song Yubo’s**\n\n**personal Baidu document sharing account, open registration for the “TOPSEC Cup”**\n\n**began on May 4th, 2014 and would close on May 14th, 2014.**\n\n**The details of the competition that were shared on the announcement are extremely**\n\n**ambiguous, and probably for good reason.

Beijing Topsec Technology Co:\n\n#### The Company\n\n**[To enhance our open-source capabilities, we partnered up with Dr. James Mulvenon](http://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Mulvenon_Bio.pdf)**\n\n**[and his team of China experts at Defense Group, Inc. (DGI). We shared with them](http://www.defensegroupinc.com/index.html)**\n\n**everything that we knew at the time, walking through the technical details which led**\n\n**us all the way to Song Yubo and the competition announcement. From there, they**\n\n**were able to uncover a wealth of very consequential background information on**\n\n**Beijing Topsec Technology Co (Beijing Topsec), the sponsoring organization for**\n\n**Song Yubo’s information security competition.**\n\n**DGI’s research indicated that Beijing Topsec is one of the largest information**\n\n**security hardware providers in China. In 1996, they were the first Chinese company�**\n\n**to break into the market with the release of China’s first indigenously-manufactured�**\n\n**firewall. Since then, they have expanded their business to include a consulting�**\n\n**practice focused on issues such as vulnerability mining, software code analysis,**\n\n**threat intelligence, and encryption R&D, amongst other things.**\n\n**The company served as a core technical support unit for network security at the**\n\n**2008 Olympic Games – an event which was tightly controlled by the state.**\n\n**Additionally, Beijing Topsec is a known partner of the Chinese military. Since 2009,**\n\n**the company has possessed information publication credentials for military network**\n\n**procurement. Since 2013, they have been publicly recognized as the Chinese**\n\n**equivalent of a cleared defense contractor.**\n\n**The links between Beijing Topsec and the Chinese government are fairly**\n\n**substantial, highlighted by long-standing partnerships between even the most**\n\n**shadowy elements of the Chinese military.**\n\n#### The Leaked Cable\n\n**A** **lli** **i** **f** **id** **i f** **d i** **th** **t** **t** **f** **l** **k d 2009**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The cable is a daily digest of Diplomatic Security alerts – essentially a situational**\n\n**awareness primer for State Department employees to inform them of new and**\n\n**existing threats. In one section, the cable highlights that the Founder of Beijing**\n\n**Topsec, He Weidong, had openly talked about receiving directives from the PLA in**\n\n**an interview with China News Network. In the interview, the founder quite curiously**\n\n**states that Topsec is less a commercial entity, but rather a research institute, and**\n\n**that the company received about half of its start-up capital directly from the PLA.**\n\n**The cable further claims that Topsec actively recruits for the PLA cyber army.**\n\n**It would also appear that not only does Beijing Topsec have deep ties to state-run**\n\n**cyber activity, but also within the independent hacker community as well. Of note,**\n\n**the company hired the notorious hacker Lin Yong, a.k.a. “Lion” (of the Honker Union**\n\n**of China) in the early 2000s as a security service engineer and to conduct network**\n\n**training.**\n\n#### Section Summary:\n\n**It is not surprising that the Chinese government would be interested in partnering**\n\n**with a private organization such as Beijing Topsec for use as a front for state-**\n\n**sponsored activity.**\n\n**The association between Southeast University and Beijing Topsec as manifested**\n\n**in the joint information security research center highlights the possibility of**\n\n**growing links between state-sponsored activity and academic institutions,**\n\n**particularly those that receive funding from the central government.**\n\n**All in all, it would seem that China is pursuing a unified approach to cyber�**\n\n**operations, relying on all unique facets of the workforce: academia, private**\n\n**industry, and independent hackers, as well as the PLA to achieve their strategic**\n\n**goals.**\n\n## Conclusion:\n\n**The Anthem breach exposes the insidious reality of modern Chinese cyber**\n\n\n-----\n\n**American way of life. Moreover, it demonstrates the imposing yet increasingly**\n\n**common reality of conducting threat intelligence analysis without substantial threat**\n\n**intelligence to start with. Fortunately for us, we were able to deduce informed**\n\n**answers to some of the outstanding questions to this breach by scrutinizing our**\n\n**archival data troves that are efficiently stored within our Threat Intelligence Platform�**\n\n**and partner integrations. In the field of cyber security, industry professionals must�**\n\n**learn to play the long game in order to generate a proactive sense of situational**\n\n**awareness, allowing for greater efficiency and flexibility in mitigating future threats.�**\n\n**Additionally, this incident underscores the frustrating disparity of the industry when it**\n\n**comes to naming conventions. With so many threat actors and indicators floating�**\n\n**around, it is can be frustrating to keep track of all the disparate pieces of evidence,**\n\n**especially when countless naming conventions are applied. Without the use of a**\n\n**Threat Intelligence Platform to keep track of the flood of incoming threat data, this�**\n\n**task would be extraordinarily time consuming at best and crippling at worst.**\n\n**Moving forward, it is important to bear in mind that the adversary, regardless of**\n\n**country of origin, shall almost certainly leverage our every weakness against us.**\n\n**Even something as seemingly innocuous as confusion over names can easily**\n\n**consume analytical bandwidth, creating a window of opportunity to strike. We – that**\n\n**is security professionals, private industry and governments alike – must proactively**\n\n**harden our network defenses and hasten our incident responses as a united,**\n\n**synchronous entity.**\n\n**We have shared details on** **[Song Yubo and affiliated indicators within the�](https://app.threatconnect.com/tc/auth/adversary/adversary.xhtml?adversary=726175)**\n\n**ThreatConnect Common Community. This share also includes the full-text DGI**\n\n**“BLUE HERON” research which provides greater insight into Song Yubo, Southeast**\n\n**University and Beijing Topsec.**\n\n**All things considered, industry must learn to adopt a cooperative defense mindset in**\n\n**the hopes of rebuffing future attacks.
