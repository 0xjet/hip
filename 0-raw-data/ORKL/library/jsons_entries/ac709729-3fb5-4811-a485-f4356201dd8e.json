In this\narticle, DomainTools researchers provide a look at the three most prolific (by victim)\nransomware families and the current loaders they use.\n\n## Ransom-every-ware\n\nThe current cybersecurity news cycle seems entirely dominated by the ransomware scene\nas [major pipelines are interrupted, the](https://www.zdnet.com/article/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-everything-you-need-to-know/) [meat supply chain grinds to a halt, and](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ransomware-attack-roiled-meat-giant-jbs-then-spilled-over-to-farmers-and-restaurants-11623403800)\n[manufacturers across the board shutter while getting their networks in order. Ransomware](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/ransomware/fujifilm-confirms-ransomware-attack-on-systems-in-japan/)\ngangs appear to be multiplying and new groups are claiming their ties to older groups to\ngain clout and scaring their victims into payment. Affiliate programs are recruiting on hacker\n[forums while initial access brokers are selling footholds into corporate networks. There is a](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvkqb/how-ea-games-was-hacked-slack)\nvast underground economy booming around the ransomware scene today.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn all of this, it s easy to get lost when examining infections as the deluge of incidents\ncontinues. Malware families like TrickBot, Ryuk, Dridex, BazarLoader, and DoppelPaymer\ncertainly don’t make things any easier for defenders. Ransomware gangs or affiliate groups\nbeing confounded with their tooling names muddle things even further. Couple that with the\nfact that most of these hacker tools have precursor tools that lead to infections, a\npartnership where a botnet operator, after acquiring what they need from a network, then\nsells access or directly works with ransomware groups for a cut of their take. These\npartnerships are akin to partnerships in the corporate world: for example, a TrickBot\ninfection often leads to Conti or Ryuk ransomware or a Qakbot infection leads to a REvil\nransomware. These ties and alliances shift as new botnets and groups bloom and fade.\n\nThrough this article, DomainTools research will give a lay of the land, as it stands today, and\nwhich infections lead to what outcomes, properties of those infections, and how to spot\nthem. We’ll concentrate on the top three most prolific ransomware families by number of\nvictims Conti, Maze (and in turn Egregor, more on that later), and Sodinokibi (REvil) to\nprovide you with a better comprehension of what you read in the ever-evolving ransomware\nnews cycle.\n\nImage courtesy of Allan Liska\n\n\n-----\n\n## An Important Reminder On Affiliates\n\nDomainTools researchers feel that it is important to remind readers that all of these groups\nmake alliances, share tools, and sell access to one another. Nothing in this space is static\nand even though there is a single piece of software behind a set of intrusions there are\nlikely several different operators using that same piece of ransomware that will tweak its\noperation to their designs.\n\nThe playbook of the affiliate programs that many of these ransomware authors run is to\ndesign a piece of ransomware and then sell it off for a percentage of the ransom gained.\n[Think of it as a cybercrime multi-level marketing scheme. Often there is a builder tool that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing)\nallows the affiliate to customize the ransomware to their needs for a specific target which at\nthe same time tweaks the software slightly so it can evade standard, static detection\nmechanisms. This article’s intent is not to dive deep into tracking individual affiliates or into\neach of the stages of a piece of packed malware (looking at you, CobaltStrike), but just to\nthe top level of software used and their relations.\n\nLastly, we must mention that access for the ransomware is often being provided by an initial\nbackdoor or botnet, frequently called an initial access broker. These backdoors, sometimes\nreferred to as remote access trojans (RATs), are first dropped by a downloader, another\npiece of simple, obfuscated software that is usually distributed by spam emails with\nmalicious documents of varying types. Sometimes, the people behind these RATs and\n[ransomware families will also obtain access by password spraying techniques or exploiting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003/)\nold vulnerabilities that might be present on aging systems exposed on corporate networks.\nWe will include those steps in our explanations.\n\nAll in all, what this shows is that the problem space to look in for a robust defense\nsolution isn’t necessarily at the ransomware itself, but the methods of initial access\nthrough spam email campaigns, brute force attacks, and vulnerability management.\nRarely are the affiliates behind the ransomware infection actually the same entity\nacquiring initial access.\n\n### Conti\n\n[First observed in December 2019, Conti is suspected to be operated by the same group](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0575/)\n[that is behind the Ryuk ransomware, known for its rapid cycles of initial access to](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0446/)\nransomware infection. Like many groups, they operate a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\noffering and have a leak site that they leverage against victims for double extortion. While\n[distributed by the TrickBot botnet in the past, Conti is often seen now being distributed by](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0266/)\n[Bazar and](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0534/) [IcedID (aka BokBot). What’s interesting here is that IcedID was also known to be](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0483/)\n[distributed by the prolific Emotet botnet which distributed TrickBot and Ryuk in the past as](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0367/)\nwell. All of these connections lead most to believe that the groups behind all of these pieces\nof malicious software are connected and working together.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Conti is unique in that when encrypting victim data with AES256, the software uses a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)\nmultithreaded approach which makes the execution much faster than other malware\nfamilies. This can mean that by the time defenders notice the Conti infection on one\nmachine, it’s far too late to remediate. The ties to older groups such as Ryuk, having\noperated since 2018, and the improvement in capabilities and speed indicate that Conti is\nthe next iteration of software for these gangs and the most deadly of the current malware\nfamilies. Additionally, the fact that Conti is one of the few RaaS programs that sometimes\ngains initial access on its own shows a higher level of sophistication than some other\naffiliate groups.\n\nLastly, we want to call out Bazar for a piece of uniqueness uncovered by the domain name[specific research that DomainTools conducts. Bazar uses EmerDNS blockchain-based](https://emercoin.com/en/emerdns)\ndomains. This is an alternative domain registry which uses EmerCoin as the blockchain,\n[meaning the domains cannot be taken down or sinkholed to disrupt the botnet’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole)\ncommunications as this is an entirely separate DNS not under anyone’s control. Use of\nthese blockchain domains has been slowly on the rise in malicious softwares and produces\na significant problem for defenders.\n\n### Maze and Egregor\n\nThe [Maze ransomware group remains one of the most prolific ransomware affiliate](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0449/)\nprograms with such a vast number of infections that they still exist in the top ten infections\n[of all time even though the affiliate program announced their retirement in November 2020](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2020/11/maze-ransomware-gang-announces-retirement/)\nafter only forming in 2019. Maze, previously called ChaCha for its use of the ChaCha\nencryption algorithm, was also the [first RaaS to develop a leaks site and attempt to get](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2020/05/maze-the-ransomware-that-introduced-an-extra-twist/)\nvictims to pay using double extortion—something that’s common for all new ransomware\nprograms today. For that reason we couldn’t leave them off this list even though most of\n[their affiliates moved on to using the Egregor ransomware, first appearing in September](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0554/)\n2020, after Maze’s retirement.\n\n[Maze used off-the-shelf exploit kits such as Fallout or Spelevo and spam campaigns that](https://nao-sec.org/2018/09/hello-fallout-exploit-kit.html)\n[have downloaders that install Cobalt Strike Beacon. Beacon is a commercial, full-featured](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/)\nRAT that is found in almost all infection chains these days. Despite claiming to be a tool for\nred teams and penetration testers, Cobalt Strike is so full-featured, particularly its modular\ncommand and control in Beacon, that bad actors have taken the tool up without abandon.\nMost infection chains have an instance of Beacon in them somewhere, including with Conti\nabove.\n\nWhat’s important to note here is that the Egregor ransomware family departs from Maze in\nthat it follows a similar model to Conti where external exploits against RDP, similar to Conti,\n[are used as well as spam mail with malicious documents to drop the Qakbot (AKA Qbot)](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/000283381)\nworm. Qakbot is a commodity malware, available since 2007, that is available on a number\nof underground forums and used by several ransomware families. Muddying waters even\nfurther, Qakbot has been seen being dropped by Emotet in some infections and tied to\n\n\n-----\n\nseveral ransomware families in the past outside Egregor, such as ProLock and\n[LockerGoga. The Egregor attacks using RDP to gain an initial foothold lead some to believe](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0372/)\nthat some Egregor affiliates are confident in breaching networks directly while others are\nrelying on initial access brokers who are less skilled leveraging commodity malware.\n\n### REvil (Sodinokibi)\n\nThe [REvil ransomware family first appeared in April 2019 and is thought, due to code](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0496/)\n[similarities, to be the spiritual successor to GandCrab, an earlier ransomware variant that](https://www.malwarebytes.com/gandcrab)\ntargeted consumers. Similar to many other ransomware variants, REvil checks on startup if\nthe computer’s language region is set to an allowlisted country, typically a nation outside of\nthe CIS nations such as Kazakhstan and Russia. Much like other families, REvil operates a\n[leak site where they have for instance offered up stolen Apple blueprints.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-now-warns-they-will-leak-new-apple-logos-ipad-plans/)\n\nREvil also has a number of unique features that make the malware particularly sinister. For\ninstance, REvil samples will attempt to escalate privileges by constantly spamming the user\nwith an administrator login prompt or will reboot into Windows Safe Mode to encrypt files, as\nantivirus software rarely runs in safe mode. The software also uses a custom packer to\ndisguise itself which makes analysis difficult for less talented reverse engineers. Separate\n[from the previous two families discussed, REvil uses the AES or Salsa20 encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20)\nalgorithms on victim files which is a slightly unique signature. These unique features along\n[with the RaaS’ success has led to some new gangs, such as Prometheus, claiming to be a](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/prometheus-ransomware/)\npart of REvil to encourage victim payment.\n\nAs for distribution, REvil affiliates have been seen using a spam campaign to deliver\nmalicious documents and exploit kits targeting old vulnerabilities on unpatched machines as\nwell as most recently through Qakbot. This new relationship of being distributed through the\nQakbot worm brings REvil into line with the many other families that have been distributed\nby botnets in the past. With the speed at which many of these ransomware groups are now\nmoving and the money involved, purchasing access from botnet operators into valuable\nvictim networks is more effective than individual targeting of companies for most affiliates.\n\n## Ransomware Map\n\nWhile the previous three families may be the most prominent in terms of victim market\nshare, there remains an ever growing number of ransomware gangs and families to keep\ntrack of in the rapid news cycle. These three families also offer a glimpse into what most of\nthe ransomware market looks like as far as infection vectors and chains are concerned.\nWith those as a basis, we offer the was a guide below to help with interpreting any articles\nencountered on ransomware. As with any ancient map there are portions of unknown\n[territories (here be dragons) and portions that may rapidly shift from the time when this map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)\nwas made. Tactics and techniques change, relationships change, but this is the market\nslightly untangled from the DomainTools research perspective at the time of this publishing.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n[Click here to view the full Miro board.](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l_VMgCw=/)\n\n\n-----",
