Shrouded Crossbow targeted privatized agencies and government**\n\n**contractors as well as enterprises in the consumer electronics, computer, healthcare, and financial** **Your email here**\n\n**industries.**\n\n**Shrouded Crossbow employs three BIFROST-derived backdoors: BIFROSE, KIVARS, and XBOW. Like**\n**PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow uses spear-phishing emails with backdoor-laden attachments that utilize**\n\n**the RTLO technique and accompanied by decoy documents.**\n\n**BIFROSE, known for evading detection by communicating with its C&C servers via Tor protocol, also**\n\n**[has a version targeting UNIX-based operating systems which are usually used in servers](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/threat-actors-behind-shrouded-crossbow-creates-bifrose-for-unix/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n|C&C Server|PLEAD|Shrouded Crossbow|Waterbear|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|itaiwans[.]com|Yes|No|Yes|\n|microsoftmse[.]com|Yes|Yes|No|\n|211[.]72[.]242[.]120|Yes|Yes|No|\n\n|rking together:|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||PLEAD|Shrouded Crossbow|\n|Samples from the same group using the same filename|Loader component named after its target, i.e. {target name}.exe|Loader component named after its target, i.e. {target name}.exe or {target name}64.exe|\n|Backdoors using the same C&C servers|Connected to 211[.]72[.]242[.]120:53|Connected to 211[.]72[.]242[.]120:443|\n|Timeline indicating arrival order|Arrived two days after initial infection by SC|Established presence two years prior, but re-infected at a recent time|\n\n|Col1|PLEAD|Shrouded Crossbow|Waterbear|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Samples found in same machine|vmdks.exe|cfbcjtqx.dll|tpauto.dll|\n|Timeline of infection|3/16/2017|2/23/2017|3/8/2017|\n\n\n**[windows, and trigger mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.

The campaign’s name is based on its malware’s**\n**capability to equip additional functions remotely.**\n\n**Waterbear similarly employs a modular approach to its malware. A loader component executable will**\n\n**connect to the C&C server to download the main backdoor and load it in memory. A later version of this**\n\n**[malware appeared and used patched server applications as its loader component, while the main](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/attack-gains-foothold-against-east-asian-government-through-auto-start/)**\n\n**backdoor is either loaded from an encrypted file or downloaded from the C&C server.**\n\n**The tactic it later adopted required prior knowledge of their targets’ environment. It’s possible attackers**\n\n**used Waterbear as a secondary payload to help maintain presence after gaining some levels of access**\n\n**into the targets’ systems.**\n\n**_All Roads Lead to BlackTech_**\n\n**Based on the use of the same C&C servers, the campaigns’ coordinated efforts, and similarities in**\n**tools, techniques, and objectives, we can conclude that they are operated by the same group. It is not**\n\n**uncommon, for instance, for a group—especially a well-funded one—to split into teams and run**\n\n**multiple campaigns. While most of the campaigns’ attacks are conducted separately, we’ve seen**\n\n**apparently joint operations conducted in phases that entail the work of different teams at each point in**\n\n**the infection chain.**\n\n**_Use of the Same C&C Servers. In several instances, we found the campaigns’ malware_**\n\n**communicating with the same C&C servers. In targeted attacks, C&C servers are typically not shared**\n\n**with other groups. Here are some of the C&C servers we found that are shared by the campaigns:**\n\n**C&C Server** **PLEAD** **Shrouded Crossbow** **Waterbear**\n\n**itaiwans[.]com** **Yes** **No** **Yes**\n\n**microsoftmse[.]com** **Yes** **Yes** **No**\n\n**211[.]72[.]242[.]120** **Yes** **Yes** **No**\n\n**_Table 1: C&C servers shared by PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear_**\n\n**Additionally, the IP 211[.]72 [.]242[.]120 is one of the hosts for the domain microsoftmse[.]com, which**\n**has been used by several KIVARS variants.**\n\n**_Joint Operations. We also found incidents where the backdoors were used on the same targets. While_**\n\n**it’s possible for separate groups to attack at the same time, we can construe at they are at least**\n\n**working together:**\n\n**PLEAD** **Shrouded Crossbow**\n\n**_Samples from the same_** **Loader component named** **Loader component named**\n**_group using the same_** **after its target, i.e. {target** **after its target, i.e. {target**\n**_filename_** **_name}.exe_** **_name}.exe or {target_**\n\n**_name}64.exe_**\n\n**_Backdoors using the same_** **Connected to** **Connected to**\n**_C&C servers_** **211[.]72[.]242[.]120:53** **211[.]72[.]242[.]120:443**\n\n**_Timeline indicating arrival_** **Arrived two days after initial** **Established presence two**\n**_order_** **infection by SC** **years prior, but re-infected at**\n\n**a recent time**\n\n**_Table 2: Incident where PLEAD and KIVARS attack the same target_**\n\n**PLEAD** **Shrouded** **Waterbear**\n**Crossbow**\n\n**_Samples found in_** **_vmdks.exe_** **_cfbcjtqx.dll_** **_tpauto.dll_**\n\n**_same machine_**\n\n**_Timeline of infection_** **3/16/2017** **2/23/2017** **3/8/2017**\n\n**_Table 3: Incidents where PLEAD, KIVARS, and Waterbear were used on the same target_**\n\n**_Similarities between tools and techniques. PLEAD and KIVARS, for instance, share the use of_**\n**RTLO techniques to disguise their installers as documents. Both also use decoy documents to make**\n\n**the RTLO attack more convincing. Another similarity is the use of a small loader component to load**\n**encrypted backdoors into memory.**\n\n**_Similar Objectives. The ulterior motive of these campaigns is to steal important documents from their_**\n**victims; initial recipients of their attacks are not always their primary target. For instance, we saw**\n**several decoy documents stolen by the attackers that are then used against another target. This**\n\n**indicates that document theft is most likely the first phase of an attack chain against a victim with ties to**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Based on the type of documents stolen by these campaigns, we can get a clearer view of who they re**\n\n**targeting and compromising, the purpose of their campaigns, and when they take place.
