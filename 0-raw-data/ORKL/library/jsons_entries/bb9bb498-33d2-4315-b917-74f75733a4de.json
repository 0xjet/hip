We also provide details on\nIron Tiger’s possible connections to other threat actors based on similar tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs) we’ve observed. Finally, we describe some of the rootkits that Iron Tiger is using, one of which is used\nto hide files at the kernel level, and has not been previously reported as being used by this threat actor.\n\n## A Look at the Iron Tiger Threat Group\n\n[In 2019, Talent-Jump, Inc., a security service and system integration company, discovered several malware](http://www.talent-jump.com/en/)\nvariants in a gambling company during an incident response operation and sought our help for further\ninvestigation and analysis.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, Talent-Jump found new samples for malware families that are attributed to the Iron Tiger\n[threat actor, which is also referred to as LuckyMouse, EmissaryPanda, and APT27.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/luckymouse-campaign-strikes-national-data-center-to-snag-government-targets/)\n\nWhile investigating Operation DRBControl in 2019, we found several connections to multiple threat actors:\n\n[Iron Tiger, which uses the HyperBro trojan and some infrastructure links](https://thehackernews.com/2018/06/chinese-watering-hole-attack.html)\n[Winnti, which uses the same infrastructure and code-sharing links detailed in our paper](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0044/)\n[Bronze President, a threat actor that targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Back in 2019, we](https://www.securityweek.com/chinese-cyber-espionage-group-targeted-ngos-years)\nnamed a malware family, which we believed was new, as “Type 2.”\n\nHowever, after the publication of our report, we learned that the Type 2 malware family described in our\n[report was the same as the “RCSession” malware family that Dell Secureworks described in a blog that they](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-president-targets-ngos)\npublished in December 2019.\n\nAfter finding multiple tools belonging to the Iron Tiger threat actor (which we now track as Earth Smilodon),\nit is likely that the new malware families that we found during the Operation DRBControl investigation came\nfrom the same threat actor.\n\nNew Version of SysUpdate Malware\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. The old and new SysUpdate infection chains\n\nIn December 2020, we found a sample that we identified as one belonging to the SysUpdate malware family,\n[also named Soldier, FOCUSFJORD, and HyperSSL. SysUpdate was first described by the NCC Group in 2018.](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Shank-Piccolini.pdf)\n\nIn the past, SysUpdate was loaded in memory by a known method involving three files:\n\nOne legitimate executable, sometimes signed, and vulnerable to dynamic-link library (DLL) sideloading\nOne malicious DLL loaded by the legitimate file\nOne binary file usually containing obfuscated code, unpacked in memory by the malicious DLL\n\nAn additional executable that serves as a launcher is loaded in memory, which then loads the final SysUpdate\npayload. Based on our investigation, instead of the usual three files, the threat actor used five:\n\n_dlpumgr32.exe, a legitimate signed file that belongs to the DESlock+ product_\n_DLPPREM32.DLL, a malicious DLL sideloaded by dlpumgr32.exe that loads and decodes_\n_DLPPREM32.bin_\n_DLPPREM32.bin, a shellcode that decompresses and loads a launcher in memory_\ndata.res, an encrypted file decoded by the launcher and contains two SysUpdate versions: one for a 32bit architecture and another for a 64-bit architecture\nconfig.res, an encrypted file decoded by the launcher and contains the SysUpdate configuration, such as\nthe command-and-control (C&C) address\n\n## Analysis of the Updated Tool: The Launcher\n\n\n-----\n\nIn summary, the launcher acts as an installer — it will copy the malware to a fixed place and ensure that it runs\nduring the next boot of the infected host. In detail, this process involves multiple steps.\n\nThe launcher starts by instantiating the CLoadInfo object, which has the following structure:\n\nOffset Description Hardcoded values in our sample\n\n0 VTable of CLoadInfo class\n\n4 Directory to copy all files %PROGRAMDATA%\\Test\\\n\n8 Name of the legitimate executable _dlpumgr32.exe_\n\n12 Name of the sideloaded DLL _DLPPREM32.DLL_\n\n16 Name of the shellcode _DLPPREM32.bin_\n\n20 Name of the encrypted payload _data.res_\n\n24 MD5 of the encrypted payload e43e40416520dab5b4c44ac8af907078\n\n28 Name of the encrypted configuration _config.res_\n\n32 Name of the registry key value _servTest_\n\n36 Name of the service DisplayName _Servdisplay_\n\nTable 1. CLoadInfo object structure\n\nThe launcher’s behavior changes depending on the number of arguments passed to the executable. It’s\nimportant to highlight that the change of behavior only depends on the number of arguments, and not the\ncontent:\n\n**No argument. If there is no argument, a hardcoded directory will be created wherein all the files will be**\ncopied. The CreationTime, LastWriteTime, and LastAccessTime will be updated according to the\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\kernel32.dll file and their file attributes will be set to “hidden” and “system”.\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) will be used to run dlpumgr32.exe with arguments “-up\n**-run -x” and it will exit the current process.**\n**One argument. It will skip the decoding of the configuration and persistence setup, and will perform**\nthe same behavior as one with three arguments.\n\n|Offset|Description|Hardcoded values in our sample|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|VTable of CLoadInfo class||\n|4|Directory to copy all files|%PROGRAMDATA%\\Test\\|\n|8|Name of the legitimate executable|dlpumgr32.exe|\n|12|Name of the sideloaded DLL|DLPPREM32.DLL|\n|16|Name of the shellcode|DLPPREM32.bin|\n|20|Name of the encrypted payload|data.res|\n|24|MD5 of the encrypted payload|e43e40416520dab5b4c44ac8af907078|\n|28|Name of the encrypted configuration|config.res|\n|32|Name of the registry key value|servTest|\n|36|Name of the service DisplayName|Servdisplay|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Three arguments.**\n\nThe launcher first decrypts the config.res file with a hardcoded Data Encryption Standard (DES)\nkey. It encodes it using another key and writes it to the registry key\n“Software\\Classes\\scConfig” (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_CURRENT_USER\nhive, depending on the privileges of the process).\nAfter decrypting the configuration, the config.res file is deleted.\nDepending on the privileges of the process, the malware will add a value to the\n“Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” key, or it will create a service that\nruns the malware at boot time\nThe launcher decrypts the data.res file with a different hardcoded DES key. The result is a file with\nthe following structure:\n\nSize of the 32-bit shellcode\n\n32-bit shellcode\n\nSize of the 64-bit shellcode\n\n64-bit shellcode\n\nTable 2. Structure of decrypted data.res file\n\nLastly, the launcher starts a suspended process with the command line\n“C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k LocalServices,”and injects the appropriate shellcode into\nit (either 32- or 64-bit). It will then resume the newly created process and exit the current process.\n\nThe following diagram summarizes the launch procedure:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The launch procedure of the updated tool\n\nThe payload itself is a new version of SysUpdate.\n\n## Analysis of the Payload\n\nThe features of the updated SysUpdate payload look similar to its previous versions. We observed that the C++\ncode is structured around classes, many of which have self-explanatory names. Some of these classes, such as\n_CCompress, CIOStreamIF, or CTcpSocket,have been present in the older versions of SysUpdate and compiled_\nnear the end of 2015.\n\nOthers have been in existence for many years, such as TPacket, SCM Client, SystemInfo, CMD5, CIOStream,\nand CInfo. Some of them are newer and have been developed in 2020, such as ConfigReg, CWorkQueue,\n_WindowsEvent, and CEncoder or cudp._\n\nThe sample we’ve analyzed contained many new and unique classes that featured a particular naming\nconvention. The names of classes are mostly self-explanatory, and the manner in which the classes have been\norganized is probably the result of a framework developed by our threat actor.\n\nSome of the classes’ names start with “H” (HControl, HSleep, and HTrans), “I” (IAgent, ITcpAgent, and\n_IAgentListener), “T” (TCommon, TFileInfo, TFileRename, TFileUpload, TServicesInfo, TListUser, and_\n_TTransmit), “C” (CSSLAgent, CSocks5, and CTcpAgent) or “CM” (CMCapture, CMFile, CMPipeClient,_\n_CMPipeServer, CMProcess, CMServices, and CMShell)._\n\nThe communication is made via a named pipe (in our case, it’s “\\\\.\\pipe\\testPipe”). Multiple features that\nare expected of an espionage backdoor are present in the sample. These include a screenshot feature, file\nmanagement functions (such as search, delete, move, upload, and download), process and services\n\n\n-----\n\nmanagement, and command execution.\n\nIt should be noted that we also found recent samples of the SysUpdate backdoor that do not implement these\n“new” classes. This suggests that different groups (or subgroups of Iron Tiger) are also using this malware\nfamily in their attacks.\n\n## Pandora Backdoor\n\nOn two occasions (in March and October 2020), we found a kernel rootkit that had been deployed. After\nanalysis, it appears that this rootkit’s behavior is very similar to that of the NDISProxy driver and remote\naccess trojan (RAT). The version we found is slightly different — the driver isn’t digitally signed but instead\nutilizes a known exploit to bypass Windows Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) protection and load the\ndriver directly into the system.\n\nWe chose to call it “Pandora” based on the program database (PDB) path of the unpacked stage 2, which is\n“F:\\Pandora\\x\\drv(32-64)\\bin\\src\\drvx64.pdb.”\n\nThe rootkit has multiple stages before getting to the actual payload:\n\n**Stage 1**\n\nGrants system privileges via Windows services\nUses DLL sideloading technique to evade security solutions\nStarts and injects code to a new svchost process to prevent tracking\n\n**Stage 2**\n\n[Utilizes a known vulnerability (CPU-Z CVE-2017-15303) that allows it to read and write into physical](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15303)\nmemory and read CPU control registers to turn the DSE off. This is done in conjunction with the Process\nMonitor driver (procxp152.sys), both of which are dropped upon loading the rootkit, even if they are\nnot originally installed in the machine.\nLoads \"drvx64.sys,\" a crafted Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) driver\n\n**Stage 2 - Driver**\n\nRegisters WPF callback and filters incoming traffic with a predefined token\nInjects final payload into \"lsass.exe\"\n\n**Stage 3 - Final Payload**\n\nInstalls itself as a Windows service\nSets a specific keyword for communication\nExchanges messages and commands with the kernel driver\nPerforms backdoor functions\n\nEach backdoor has a different token that is encrypted in the registry. If the incoming traffic contains a token\nand is in the HTTP format, the backdoor will intercept the traffic and process the command. In the version\nthat we’ve analyzed, the installer writes the token in the registry key. We can’t trigger the backdoor without a\ncurrent token, which makes the backdoor more difficult to find and analyze.\n\n**Sample** **Token** **Mutex** **Semaphore**\n\nPandora 20200310 FHHqw@nF4Jo0vPAU180IP5h9umnd4KFi ENDnetfilter 234netfilter\n\nPandora 20201010 Qp$zo&FgPBjGhm(.LGi_&j~tmhMO08) ENDdsfsfs xwwadsfsfs\n\n|Sample|Token|Mutex|Semaphore|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Pandora 20200310|FHHqw@nF4Jo0vPAU180IP5h9umnd4KFi|ENDnetfilter|234netfilter|\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 3. Pandora backdoor samples with different tokens\n\nBased on our analysis, the Pandora backdoor contains more public code repositories compared with previous\nversions.\n\n**Feature** **Name** **Repository**\n\nDriver memory Blackbone https://github.com/DarthTon/Blackbone\ninjection\n\nNDIS network filtering WFP \"WDK\\Windows Filtering Platform Stream Edit\ndriver Sample Sample/C++/sys/stream_callout.c”\n\nParse HTTP packets HTTP https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser\nParser\n\nTurn off DSE StryKer https://github.com/hfiref0x/Stryker\n\nEncrypted D3DES https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk-vnc/-/blob/v0.1.0/src/d3des.c\nCommunication\n\nCompression QuickLZ https://github.com/robottwo/quicklz\n\nTable 4. Pandora’s public code repositories\n\nRootkit From a Public Repository\n\nWe found a rootkit that is being used for hiding processes, files, and services. It was taken from a public\nGitHub repository whose author is not associated with the threat actor.\n\nHidden.sys - https://github.com/JKornev/hidden/tree/master/\n\nThe sample was found in April 2020. The driver was not signed and used the same DSE exploit that the\nPandora backdoor uses for it to load.\n\nThe tool is used to hide the threat actors’ tools and services. The tool’s configuration was added to registry run\nkeys on a victim’s computer.\n\nHidden Registry/Folder/File\n\n|Feature|Name|Repository|\n|---|---|---|\n|Driver memory injection|Blackbone|https://github.com/DarthTon/Blackbone|\n|NDIS network filtering driver|WFP Sample|\"WDK\\Windows Filtering Platform Stream Edit Sample/C++/sys/stream_callout.c”|\n|Parse HTTP packets|HTTP Parser|https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser|\n|Turn off DSE|StryKer|https://github.com/hfiref0x/Stryker|\n|Encrypted Communication|D3DES|https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk-vnc/-/blob/v0.1.0/src/d3des.c|\n|Compression|QuickLZ|https://github.com/robottwo/quicklz|\n\n|Type|Value|\n|---|---|\n|REG|HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\HiddenService|\n|REG|HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\servTest|\n|REG|HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\TrkWkss|\n|Folder|C:\\programdata\\vlc|\n\n\n-----\n\n|File|C:\\programdata\\vlc\\vlc.exe|\n|---|---|\n|Folder|C:\\programdata\\test|\n|File|C:\\programdata\\test\\dlpumgr32.exe|\n|File|C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\Hidden.sys|\n|File|C:\\windows\\system32\\HiddenService.exe|\n\n\nTable 5. The tool’s configuration\n\nThe references to “Hidden” are related to the rootkit itself. The “dlpumgr32.exe” and “servTest” lines are\nrelated to the new version of SysUpdate which we described earlier.\n\nWe do not know which malware variant is being sideloaded by vlc.exe. It is probably installed as a service\nnamed “TrkWkss.” We found a SysUpdate sample compiled in November 2020 that abuses a DLL\nsideloading vulnerability in VLC (see IOC list). This confirms that this threat actor is abusing this legitimate\nprogram to sideload its backdoors.\n\nHyperBro Malware Family\n\nThe Iron Tiger APT group has used the HyperBro malware family since at least 2017. It is the evolved version\n[of HttpBrowser, which the group has been using since at least 2015.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0070/)\n\nWe found earlier versions of this malware that were sideloaded by malicious DLL files that unpacked and\nloaded a binary file named “thumb.db” in memory. All the requests were sent to the C&C server on port 443,\nwith “/ajax” as the uniform resource identifier (URI).\n\nWhile investigating Operation DRBControl, we found an updated version of this malware family that\n[implements some new classes. We provided a detailed analysis of this new HyperBro version in our research.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-uncovering-DRBcontrol.pdf)\n\nWe also discovered that the binary file that’s being unpacked and loaded in memory by malicious DLL files is\nnamed “thumb.dat.” We also saw that all requests sent to the C&C server were sent to the URI\n“/api/v2/ajax” on port 443.\n\nSince we analyzed that single sample, we found several new samples that matched the newer behavior, some of\nwhich have been deployed in our gambling target.\n\nHowever, we continue seeing samples that feature the “older” behaviors, which suggests that different groups\n— or possibly subgroups of Iron Tiger — are using this malware family. Some of these samples match the\n[target and behavior listed by ESET in their blog.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)\n\n### FRP Tool\n\n[We found the FRP tool being used on a Linux host, which is similar to Avast’s findings in a report that they](https://decoded.avast.io/luigicamastra/apt-group-targeting-governmental-agencies-in-east-asia/)\npublished on the Iron Tiger threat actor.\n\nThe FRP tool that we analyzed was a modified version, which was possibly copied off of Github.\n\n### Type 1 Malware Family\n\nWe found three new samples of the Type 1 malware family that abuses Dropbox as a secondary C&C channel,\nwhich we described in our Operation DRBControl whitepaper.\n\n\n-----\n\nApart from a modification in the malware sample’s configuration (which happened after we published our\npaper), the differences with the versions that we analyzed in 2019 are minor. The version numbering was at\n11.0, while the last sample we analyzed in August 2019 was at version number 9.0. This shows that the\ndevelopment is still active.\n\nOn the infrastructure side, we observed that the threat actor switched from using IP addresses hosted on the\nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP) to IP addresses hosted on Microsoft Azure.\n\nIt should be noted that after our blog publication in February 2020, the threat actor compiled new Type 1\nmalware samples using a new configuration, which prevented us from closely monitoring their operations. We\nbelieve that this was a direct reaction to our research, suggesting that the threat actor read our investigation.\n\nIt’s also important to note that the compilation timestamp of the sideloaded DLLs were set a few months in\nadvance. For example, the binaries that we found in March and April 2020 had an August 26, 2020\ncompilation date. This is consistent with the behavior that we noticed during Operation DRBControl, wherein\nsome binaries that have been found in mid-2019 had a compilation date of March 4, 2020. This shows that the\nthreat actors intended to confuse forensics investigators with incorrect timestamps, which is why it’s critical to\nanalyze timestamps with caution during investigations.\n\n### Infection Vector\n\nWe could not confirm the primary infection vector. However, traces of the exploitation of the Microsoft\nExchange vulnerability CVE-2020-0688 were found.\n\nMultiple infection vectors have been attributed to this threat actor in the past:\n\n[Watering holes](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/)\n[Weaponized documents exploiting the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) method](https://www.secureworks.com/research/a-peek-into-bronze-unions-toolbox)\n[Weaponized documents exploiting the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability in Equation Editor](https://www.anomali.com/blog/multiple-chinese-threat-groups-exploiting-cve-2018-0798-equation-editor-vulnerability-since-late-2018)\n[Exploitation of the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability in Sharepoint](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0604)\n[Supply chain attack that compromises a chat software installer, Able Desktop](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)\n[Exploitation of recent vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26855)\n[2021-27065) in Microsoft Exchange Server](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/)\n\nDuring our investigation, we found some old samples that fit in these categories but have not been reported.\nThey are unrelated to this campaign and can be found in our IOC list.\n\n### Targets\n\nThe closer look into Iron Tiger was prompted because of an incident response investigation involving a\nPhilippine-based gambling company that the group targeted. True to form, the Iron Tiger threat actor has\ntargeted the same company for 18 months.\n\nAside from targeting the same company, Iron Tiger also targeted other countries and industries. Over the past\n18 months, we observed how the group targeted governments, banks, telecommunication providers, and even\nthe energy sector in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. The countries that Iron Tiger has targeted in the past 18 months\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe following timeline shows different samples found in the same gambling company that Talent-Jump and\nTrend Micro investigated:\n\nJuly 2019: Operation DRBControl starts\n[October 2019: One HyperBro malware sample found](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0398/)\nMarch 2020: New sample of Type 1 malware variant and a rootkit called Pandora found\nApril 2020: One rootkit sample for hiding files processes, files, and services found\nOctober 2020: New HyperBro and Pandora samples found\nDecember 2020: One sample of the SysUpdate malware variant found\nJanuary 2021: Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) Linux tool found\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis investigation provides more insight into the evolution of Iron Tiger’s toolkit and shows the threat actor’s\npersistence after targeting the same company for 18 months, as well as expanding its target base to include\nother companies and sectors in different countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\n\nWe detailed how Iron Tiger threat actors have updated their tools, adding new features, and slightly changing\ntheir tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), notably by using a rootkit to hide its backdoors. The different\ncampaigns with different versions of the same tools concurrently being used suggest that there might be\nsubgroups for this threat actor, or multiple groups with access to the builders
