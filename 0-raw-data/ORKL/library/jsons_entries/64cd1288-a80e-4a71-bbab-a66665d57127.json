The Stegoloader malware family (also known as Win32/Gatak.DR and](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=Trojan:Win32/Gatak.DR&ThreatID=-2147278948#tab=1) [TSPY_GATAK.GTK](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/tspy_gatak.gtk)\ndespite not sharing any similarities with the Gataka banking trojan) was first identified at the end of 2013\nand has attracted little public attention. Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers\nhave analyzed multiple variants of this malware, which stealthily steals information from compromised\nsystems. Stegoloader's modular design allows its operator to deploy modules as necessary, limiting the\nexposure of the malware capabilities during investigations and reverse engineering analysis. This limited\nexposure makes it difficult to fully assess the threat actors' intent. The modules analyzed by CTU\nresearchers list recently accessed documents, enumerate installed programs, list recently visited websites,\nsteal passwords, and steal installation files for the IDA tool.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nStegoloader has a modular design and uses digital steganography to hide its main module's code inside a\nPortable Network Graphics (PNG) image downloaded from a legitimate website. Other malware families\n[have used this technique, including the Lurk downloader, which CTU researchers analyzed in April 2014.](https://www.secureworks.com/research/malware-analysis-of-the-lurk-downloader)\nAt the end of 2014, CTU researchers also observed the Neverquest version of the Gozi trojan using this\ntechnology to hide information on its backup command and control (C2) server.\n\n**_Deployment module_**\n\nStegoloader’s deployment module downloads and launches the main module; it does not have\npersistence. Before deploying other modules, the malware checks that it is not running in an analysis\nenvironment. For example, the deployment module monitors mouse cursor movements by making multiple\ncalls to the GetCursorPos function. If the mouse always changes position, or if it does not change position,\nthe malware terminates without exhibiting any malicious activity.\n\nIn another effort to slow down static analysis, most of the strings found in the binary are constructed on the\nprogram stack before being used. This standard malware technique ensures that strings are not stored in\nclear text inside the malware body but rather are constructed dynamically, complicating detection and\nanalysis.\n\nBefore executing its main function, Stegoloader lists the running processes on the system and terminates if\na process name contains one of the strings in Table 1. Most of the strings represent security products or\ntools used for reverse engineering. Stegoloader does not execute its main program code if it detects\nanalysis or security tools on the system.\n\nWine SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe aswVBoxClient.exe PEiD.exe\n\n\n-----\n\npr0c3xp.exe wireshark.exe dumpcap.exe HRSword.exe\n\nHipsTray.exe InCtrl5.exe anti-virus.EXE FortiTracer.exe\n\nSWIS.exe Fiddler.exe Regshot.exe procexp.exe\n\nProcmon.exe Winalysis.exe Olly pythonw.exe\n\nwscript.exe snxcmd.exe SfCmd.exe\n\n_Table 1. Strings causing Stegoloader to terminate._\n\nAt every stage of its execution, the deployment module reports its status to a C2 server using HTTP GET\nrequests. Figure 1 shows a trace of reports sent from a compromised system to its C2 server. The GET\nrequests are constructed from a list of preconfigured URLs. In the example shown in Figure 1, the first\nstring after the \"report_\" substring is the hex-encoded name of the computer where the malware is running.\nThe second substring is a hex-encoded pointer used to list files in the victim's home directory (returned by\nthe FindFirstFileA() function). Appendix A lists the status messages that can be sent by the Stegoloader\ndeployment module.\n\n_Figure 1. Fiddler trace of Stegoloader's deployment module reporting. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\nThe deployment module fetches a PNG image from a legitimate hosting website (see Figure 2). The\nimage's URL is hard-coded in the binary. After downloading the image, Stegoloader uses the gdiplus\nlibrary to decompress the image, access each pixel, and extract the least significant bit from the color of\neach pixel. The extracted data stream is decrypted using the RC4 algorithm and a hard-coded key. Neither\nthe PNG image nor the decrypted code is saved to disk, making the malware difficult to find via traditional\ndisk-based signature analysis. The image's URL and the RC4 key vary in the samples analyzed by CTU\nresearchers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Example Stegoloader image containing encrypted content. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\nAfter the main Stegoloader module is downloaded and decrypted, the deployment module transfers\nexecution to the main module, which resides in a memory area that has been allocated for this purpose.\nThe deployment module is dormant until the main module finishes executing. When the main module\nterminates, the deployment module sends a last report to its C2 server indicating the main module has\nfinished, and then it also terminates.\n\n**_Main module_**\n\nThe main Stegoloader module communicates with its C2 server via HTTP POST requests (see Figure 3)\nand executes commands sent by the malware operator. Communications are encrypted using the RC4\nalgorithm and a hard-coded 16-byte key. The POST URL is hard-coded in the body of the malware.\n\n_Figure 3. Communication dialog between Stegoloader's main module and its C2 server. (Source: Dell_\n_SecureWorks)_\nFigure 4 shows the decrypted header of an HTTP POST request performed by a compromised system.\n\n_Figure 4. Decrypted Stegoloader header sent to the C2 server. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe first 16 bytes (in red) are randomly generated and change with each request.\nThe next 16 bytes (in blue) are also randomly generated but are used as a session identifier. They\nare constant across all messages sent from a compromised system during the same execution of the\nmalware.\nThe following byte is always '01'.\nThe eight bytes (in green) are copied from the previous response received from the C2 server. They\nare used as a sequence number but are not incremental. If the compromised system is sending its\nfirst message, the bytes are initialized to '0'.\nThe byte at offset 41 (in orange) is the command that was previously sent by the C2 server and is the\ncommand that is currently being answered. This value is set to zero if the compromised system is\ncontacting its C2 server for the first time.\nThe next two bytes are flags. The first byte indicates that there was no error executing the previous\noperation, and the '01' flag indicates further data will follow the header.\nThe last four bytes (in purple) indicate the length for the rest of the message. Messages longer than\n[400 bytes are compressed using the lzma compression algorithm.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%93Ziv%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%93Markov_chain_algorithm)\n\nBefore sending this message to its C2 server, Stegoloader prepends a CRC32 (cyclic redundancy check)\nof the message and encrypts the message with its checksum using RC4. The message is then prepended\nwith 16 hard-coded bytes, which are likely associated with the RC4 key used to decrypt the message on\nthe server side.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 server s response is also RC4-encrypted. Figure 5 shows a decrypted message from the C2\nserver. The first field of the response (in red) is a CRC32 for the rest of the message. The command code\n(in blue) is located at offset 29 (0x1d). The bytes between offsets '21' and '28' (in green) are used as a\nsession identifier and are returned to the server in the next C2 request. Additional code or data sent by the\nC2 server is appended after these first 32 bytes.\n\n_Figure 5. Decrypted Stegoloader content sent from the C2 server. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\nTable 2 lists commands that can be executed by Stegoloader.\n\n\n**Command**\n**code**\n\n\n**Command description**\n\n\n0x01 Kill command, stops execution\n\n0x02 Save content from HTTP response to temporary location and execute it by calling the\nCreateProcessA function from kernel32.dll\n\n0x03 Send system information (see Appendix B)\n\n0x04 Send list of software installed on the compromised system (determined by\nenumerating registry keys used to uninstall software)\n\n\n0x05, 0x06,\n0x07\n\n0xDC, 0xDD,\n0xDE, 0xDF\n\n\nSend Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer browser history to the C2 server\n\nSleep command, no operation is performed, ping C2 server again after 3 minutes\n\n\n0x64 Execute shellcode (shellcode is passed directly after the message header)\n\n_Table 2. Stegoloader command codes and descriptions._\n\n**_Additional modules_**\n\nThe main Stegoloader module gathers information about compromised systems. If the information\nmatches specific criteria, the malware operator can deploy additional modules. Table 3 lists hashes of\nadditional modules discovered by CTU researchers. These modules are directly executed in memory and\nare never saved to disk.\n\n**SHA1 hash** **Size (in bytes)** **Module name**\n\n54001be86035d6e7adb8c027e6d32936923b02fb 217982 IDA-stealing module\n\n4dedc828d835ae6efa5740fcb640bf010303d02d 7312 List recently opened documents\n\n55a5e1015ec0fb5859b657405e7173bc7d35f056 4665 Host geolocation\n\nce354abcaa7143ea4de30d69da2edc9d359f8f2c 38407 Pony password stealer\n\n_Table 3. Additional Stegoloader modules in samples analyzed by CTU researchers._\n\n_IDA-stealing module_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [IDA interactive disassembler is frequently used by reverse engineers and malware analysts to analyze](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/)\nmalicious software. Stegoloader has a module that steals installed instances of the IDA software. If IDA is\ndetected on the compromised system, the C2 server sends and executes this module. This module uses a\ndifferent C2 server than the main Stegoloader module. Its reporting pattern is very similar to the\ndeployment module.\n\nThe IDA-stealing module searches for IDA-related entries in the registry and sends discovered files to a\nlegitimate online file-hosting website. Table 4 lists files that may be exfiltrated. When a file is uploaded, the\nfile-hosting website returns a link that can be shared with users who want to download the file. The\nmalware parses the response and sends the download links for the exfiltrated files to its C2 server.\n\nida.key plugins\\hexrays.plw plugins\\hexrays.p64 plugins\\hexarm.plw\n\nplugins\\hexarm.p64 plugins\\defs.h cfg\\hexrays.cfg plugins\\hexrays_sdk\\include\\hexrays.hpp\n\nidag.exe ida.wll ida.int idag64.exe\n\nida64.wll ida64.int\n\n_Table 4. Files uploaded to the file-hosting website if discovered on a compromised system._\n\n_List recently opened documents_\n\nThe module to list recently opened documents uses the SHGetFolderPathA function from shell32.dll with\n[the CSIDL_RECENT parameter to find the system folder used to store links for the victim's most recently](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762494(v=vs.85).aspx)\nused documents. The module parses the links, resolves their location on the local hard drive, and sends\nthe list of recently used links and files to the C2 server using the same server and protocol as the main\nmodule.\n\n_Host geographic localization_\n\nThe host geographic localization module starts an Internet Explorer instance and visits two web pages,\nip2location.com and whoer.net, which return information about the visitor's public-facing IP address. The\nwebsites also include geolocation information for the visiting IP address. The module then compresses and\nreturns the HTML content to its C2 server using the same server and protocol as the main module.\n\n_Pony password stealer_\n\nStegoloader's Pony password stealer module is a copy of the Pony Loader information stealing malware.\nSince the leak of Pony Loader's source code on underground forums at the end of 2013, it has been used\nin various operations. This module can steal passwords for most popular applications used for protocols\nsuch as POP, IMAP, FTP, and SSH. The information stolen by the Pony password stealer module is\npackaged and sent to the main module's C2 server using the same protocol as the main module.\n\n**_Additional tactics, techniques, and procedures_**\n\nThe oldest Stegoloader samples located by CTU researchers were submitted to VirusTotal at the end of\n2013. Variants have used filenames related to software piracy. One sample, which used\nAvanquest_PowerDesk_9_0_1_10_keygen.exe, was bundled with software piracy software that was\nexecuted at the same time as the Stegoloader deployment module (see Figure 6).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Stegoloader posing as a software piracy tool. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\nDell SecureWorks data indicates that this malware family has affected multiple verticals, including\nhealthcare, education, and manufacturing. The malware has the characteristics of a stealthy and\nopportunistic information stealer. It has not been observed being used with exploits or spearphishing,\nmaking it more similar to \"mass market\" commodity malware than to a tool used in targeted attacks.\n\nSome Stegoloader variants have been observed downloading and installing the Vundo (also known as\nPonmocup) malware, which displays advertisements and installs additional malware. Stegoloader\noperators may install Vundo on a compromised system for additional monetary profit after they have\nextracted all the information they deem interesting.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStegoloader is stealthy in many aspects; it evades analysis tools and deploys only necessary modules,\nwithout writing them to disk. There are likely more Stegoloader modules than CTU researchers have\nobserved, possibly used by threat actors to ensure persistence or to gain access to additional resources.\nAlthough CTU researchers have not observed Stegoloader being used in targeted attacks, it has\nsignificant information stealing capabilities. Stegoloader is the third malware family that CTU researchers\nhave observed using digital steganography. This technique might be a new trend because malware\nauthors need to adapt to improved detection mechanisms.\n\n**Threat indicators**\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 5 can be used to detect activity related to Stegoloader.\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Context**\n\n\n723ef64c6a1b1872bc84a9dc30e10c9199f5a153 SHA1\nhash\n\na48594b243f801e02066b77e46135382e890daf6 SHA1\nhash\n\nc82c3d32211ea73b884cffe66cb1a46a080c5723 SHA1\nhash\n\n68e3e19c14d2e10c67670999c77eb08221e16a08 SHA1\nhash\n\nf6bb47621183060c2cd9df5a52face6eb1d52983 SHA1\nhash\n\nb55497e02d61f059fe23cd86083eddfb0f718cdc SHA1\nhash\n\neee347e8942c1ddc603e8c1a89dacf39673c2689 SHA1\nhash\n\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\n\n-----\n\n5e1077fc19410b1dee59c11fd9cd7810c95ebaec SHA1\nhash\n\nd5d0a9ecf1601e9e50eef6b2ad25c57b56419cd1 SHA1\nhash\n\nb8db99cf9c646bad027b34a66bb74b8b0bee295a SHA1\nhash\n\n3ad4376043d1297773e808a539ec0bd2f22b200c SHA1\nhash\n\nccca1fbfdb1efaee8b6785879a4210a56e3e0d47 SHA1\nhash\n\n43e1bfd48ee72d829c17ca1e8c9ecf296830ca8a SHA1\nhash\n\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\nStegoloader deployment module\nexecutable\n\n\nAvanquest_PowerDesk_9_0_1_10_keygen.exe Filename Stegoloader deployment module\n\nAVS_Video_Converter_9_1_1_568_keygen.exe Filename Stegoloader deployment module\n\n_Table 5.
