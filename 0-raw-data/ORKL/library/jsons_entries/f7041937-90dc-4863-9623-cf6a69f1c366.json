Hackers… in China…working\nwith the MSS. Sounds right up our street. But who are Li Xiaoyu (李啸宇) and Dong Jiazhi\n(董家志)? How do they conduct their activity? The indictment also mentions an unnamed\nMSS Officer 1. Who could this be? Let’s start with the named hackers…\n\n_FBI wanted poster naming indicted hackers Li Xiaoyu (李啸宇) and Dong Jiazhi 董家志)_\n\n\n-----\n\nFormer classmates, Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi studied Computer Application Technologies\nat the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in Chengdu. Mr\nDong and Mr Li are not individuals we have come across before in our investigations into\nChinese APTs. However, we do love a challenge. So, we set about getting to work and\ndecided to start in the city Li and Dong are based: Chengdu.\n\nOur findings reveal a number of spurious science and technology companies linked to the\nindicted actors. A familiar pattern is once again emerging…\n\n## Chengdu Shirun Technology Company Ltd (成都诗润科技有限公司)\n\nLet’s start with Dong Jiazhi. There is very little to go on from the indictment. However, we\nknow Chinese APTs follow a common blueprint: One of contract hackers and specialists,\nfront companies and an intelligence officer.\n\nWe know Mr Li and Mr Dong are the contract hackers. So we set about digging into their\nconnections to front companies based in Chengdu.\n\nIt turns out Dong has been investing in a company called Chengdu Shirun Technology\nCompany Ltd. Specifically, 30,000RMB came from Dong, who invested in the company when\nit was registered. This roughly equates to $4,5000 or £3,500.\n\n_Registrant of Chengdu Shirun Technology Company Ltd: Dong Jiazhi_\nA deeper look into this company reveals its location is 16 Tongsheng Rd, Qingyang District,\nChengdu. It also provides a contact number: 18828070461.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, this is not the only company that is linked to this contact number. It seems a\nnumber of other companies in Chengdu also share this point of contact.\n\n## Chengdu Hanke Technology Company Ltd. (成都撼科科技有限公司)\n\nThis company shares the same contact number as Chengdu Shirun but lists this as an email\ncontact (18828070461@139.com). Additional contact numbers (18980738906 and\n18190696626) are also provided.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Contact details for Chengdu Hanke Technology Company Ltd._\nEven more interesting is the change record for the company. Prior to 2019, Dong Jiazhi was\nlisted as the company contact.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Change record for Chengdu Hanke listing Dong Jiazhi on line 3_\nChengdu Hanke doesn’t have much of a presence. The website domain\n51409903.1024sj.com does not exist. However, we did come across a LinkedIn profile for\nsomeone who claims to be the project manager and lead programmer – a Kevin Lynx.\nFurther digging did not reveal anything more on this person or the company. Kevin, if you are\nout there – feel free to get in touch…\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chengdu Xinglan Technology Company Ltd. (成都兴蓝科技有限公司)\n\nIt seems 18828070461 is a theme. The number from Shirun and the 139 email from Hanke\nwas also used to register another Chengdu-based technology company: Chengdu Xinglan.\n\nSo who is behind this company? Well, as we mentioned, it shares contact details with\ncompanies linked to Dong. And Mr Dong is mentioned as the company’s primary point of\ncontact.\n\n_Company registration details listing Dong Jiazhi as a contact person for Chengdu Xinglan on_\n_line 2._\nFurthermore, records show Li Xiaoyu as Chengdu Xinglan’s legal representative, CEO and\nExecutive Director, having a 99% stake in the company. It seems the pair intertwined at\nUniversity, and expanded together into their business ventures and criminal activity\nconcealed by front companies based in Chengdu.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Chengdu Xinglan, detailing the 18828070461 contact email and Li Xiaoyu as the company’s_\n_legal representative._\n\n## Chengdulzy\n\nLi and Dong haven’t learnt to mix things up – reusing the same email number for their\nmultiple front companies.\n\nAnd once again, this number (18828070461) was used as the registrant contact number for\na domain: ‘chengdulzy.com’.\n\nThe registrant of this domain? Dong Jiazhi. Unfortunately, we haven’t found out what this\ndomain was used for, and it now appears to have been deleted.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chengdu’s many Science and Technology companies\n\nWe are finding a similar pattern to previous investigations. An overlap of numbers and emails\nlinking to contract hackers (Dong and Li), and subsequently to a number of technology\ncompanies based in Chengdu. All with little to no online presence suggests – you guessed it\n– front companies.\n\nHowever, what about the individuals themselves? They clearly have been busy investing in,\nand creating multiple technology businesses within Chengdu to act as fronts for their hacking\nactivity. But what else have they left on the internet for us to find?\n\n## Oro0lxy\n\nThe handle used by Li, and named in the indictment provides a helpful starting point. A quick\nscan of the internet shows various accounts with this handle, most now defunct or empty but\nthe majority pertaining to hacking forums, such as the Chinese Software Developers Network\n\n\n-----\n\n(CSDN).\n\nIt seems oro0lxy has had a long standing interest in ColdFusion, using this knowledge\n(according to the indictment) to develop vulnerabilities in support of his APT activity.\n\n_oro0lxy posts question on CSDN ColdFusion sub forum_\nIn keeping with his interest in this vulnerability, Li was appointed moderator of a website for\nColdFusion developers, CFwindow.com, in 2012.\n\nHowever, oro0lxy was later flagged for posting scams on CSDN.\n\n\n-----\n\n## QQ account links\n\nLooking into Li and Dong’s QQ accounts, we attempted to identify their actions and any\noverlaps that were interesting or of note. According to leaked databases, QQ 3120988 was\nassociated with the display name Li Xiaoyu, whilst QQ 191956463 had historically used the\nusername Dong Jiazhi.\n\nWe also pulled out a number of QQ groups that crossed the two hackers profiles. Specifically\ntheir QQ accounts linking to university groups such as ‘Class of 2005, Class 5’ (2005 级5\n班),‘Information Security Lab’ (信息安全实验室) and ‘Computer Applications Technology\nClass 2’ (计算机应用技术 2 班).\n\nThese are historic but provide useful context for what we know about the pair. Get in touch\nwith us if you have any further information or leads pertaining to these accounts.\n\n**So… we know that Li and Dong have been indicted as hackers working to the MSS.**\n**Contract hackers – check.**\n\n**We know that they set up a number of front companies based in Chengdu to shield**\n**their APT activity. Front companies – check.**\n\n**And we know they have been working together for a number of years, having met at**\n**university and remained active on Chinese hacker forums. But who specifically is**\n**behind their activity with the Guangdong State Security Department? Who is MSS**\n**Officer 1?**\n\n**Tune in next week to find out…**\n\n#youknowwherethisleads\n\n\n-----",
