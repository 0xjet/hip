By analyzing multiple GOLD LOWELL ransomware\nincidents, CTU researchers and Secureworks incident response (IR) analysts have\ndeveloped an extensive body of knowledge about the group’s intent, tactics, and behaviors.\n\n[SamSam incidents in 2016 and](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezpzpe/the-spreading-epidemic-of-hospital-ransomware) [2018 led many people to conclude that GOLD LOWELL](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/samsam-ransomware-hits-hospitals-city-councils-ics-firms/)\ntargets healthcare organizations. However, Secureworks’ visibility into the group’s activity\nreveals that it is opportunistic and is not limited to specific industries. Since late-2015,\nSecureworks IR analysts have observed GOLD LOWELL attacks impacting organizations in\na wide range of industries; for example:\n\nIT software providers\nWaste management businesses\nAcademic organizations\nTransportation networks\nBusiness services firms\nLeisure and entertainment businesses\n\nThe threat actors typically identify and exploit vulnerable Internet-connected systems and\nprotocols such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain a foothold in a victim’s network.\nThey then use publicly available tools to steal high-value usernames and passwords,\nleverage custom scripts to survey the network, and deploy SamSam ransomware to as many\nsystems as possible.\n\nSupporting the claim that there is “no honor among thieves,” the threat actors sometimes\nattempt to capitalize on a victim’s willingness to pay the ransom by increasing the decryption\ncost after a victim submits the initial payment. GOLD LOWELL requests ransom fees in\nBitcoin, and the rise in Bitcoin values translates to higher payments to decrypt impacted\nsystems. For example, the cost to decrypt a single system in 2015 was $650 (USD),\nwhereas by late-2017 the value increased to $9,700 per system. A GOLD LOWELL\ncampaign that spanned late-2017 to early-2018 generated at least $350,000 in revenue for\nthe threat actors. These campaigns will likely be a fixture of the threat landscape as long as\nthey continue to be lucrative.\n\n\n-----",
