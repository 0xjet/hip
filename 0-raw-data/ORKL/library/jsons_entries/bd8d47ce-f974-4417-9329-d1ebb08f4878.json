This\nincludes collaboration between ransomware groups, auctioning leaked data and demanding\nnot just one ransom for the ransomware decryptor but also a second ransom to ensure\nstolen data is deleted.\n\n[The first part of this two-part blog series explored the origins of ransomware, BGH and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/double-trouble-ransomware-data-leak-extortion-part-1/)\nextortion and introduced some of the criminal adversaries that are currently dominating the\ndata leak extortion ecosystem. This blog explores operators of Ako (a fork of MedusaLocker)\ndemanding two ransoms from victims, PINCHY SPIDER’s auctioning of stolen data and\nTWISTED SPIDER’s creation of the self-named “Maze Cartel.”\n\n## Twice the Price: Ako Operators Demand Separate Ransoms\n\nIn May 2020, CrowdStrike® Intelligence observed an update to the Ako ransomware portal.\nSimilar to many other ransomware operators, the threat actors added a link to their dedicated\nleak site (DLS), as shown in Figure 1. What makes this DLS interesting is an indication that\n\n\n-----\n\nthe threat actors were likely issuing two ransom demands: one for the victim to obtain the\ndecryption key and a second to delete the exfiltrated data from the DLS.\n\nFigure 1. Updated Ako ransom portal\n\nOne of the threat actor posts (involving a U.S.-based engineering company) included the\nfollowing comment:\n\n_Got only payment for decrypt – 350,000$_\n\n_Payment for delete stolen files was not received._\n\nWhile it appears that the victim paid the threat actors for the decryption key, the exfiltrated\ndata was still published on the DLS. This inclusion of a ransom demand for the exfiltrated\ndata is not yet commonly seen across ransomware families.\n\n## Going Once, Twice — Sold!\n\nOn June 2, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed PINCHY SPIDER introduce a new\nauction feature to their REvil DLS. This feature allows users to bid for leak data or purchase\nthe data immediately for a specified “Blitz Price.” Payments are only accepted in Monero\n(XMR) cryptocurrency. These auctions are listed in a specific section of the DLS, which\nprovides a list of available and previously expired auctions. Each auction title corresponds to\nthe company the data has been exfiltrated from and contains a countdown timer providing\n\n\n-----\n\nthe time remaining before the auction expires (Figure 2). Once the auction expires, PINCHY\nSPIDER typically provides a link to the company’s data, which can be downloaded from a\npublic file distribution website.\n\nIn order to place a bid or pay the provided Blitz Price, the bidder is required to register for a\nparticular leak auction. When a leak auction title is clicked, it takes the bidder to a detailed\npage containing “Login” and “Registration” buttons, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Detailed leak auction page\n\nThe “Login” button can be used to log in as a previously registered user, and the\n“Registration” button provides a generated username and password for the auction session.\nOnce the bidder is authenticated for a particular auction, the resulting page displays auction\ndeposit amounts, starting auction price, ending auction price, an XMR address to send\ntransactions to, a listing of transactions to that address, and the time left until the auction\nexpires, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Registered user leak auction page\n\nA minimum deposit needs to be made to the provided XMR address in order to make a bid. If\nthe bidder is outbid, then the deposit is returned to the original bidder. If the bidder wins the\nauction and does not deliver the full bid amount, the deposit is not returned to the winning\nbidder. This protects PINCHY SPIDER from fraudulent bids, while providing confidence to\nlegitimate bidders that they will have their money returned upon losing a bid. In theory,\nPINCHY SPIDER could refrain from returning bids, but this would break the trust of bidders\nin the future, thus hindering this avenue as an income stream.\n\nAt the time of this writing, CrowdStrike Intelligence had not observed any of the auctions\ninitiated by PINCHY SPIDER result in payments. If users are not willing to bid on leaked\ninformation, this business model will not suffice as an income stream. Additionally, PINCHY\nSPIDER’s willingness to release the information after the auction has expired, which\neffectively provides the data for free, may have a negative impact on the business model if\nthose seeking the information are willing to have the information go public prior to accessing\nit.\n\n## Enter the Labyrinth: Maze Cartel Encourages Criminal Collaboration\n\nIn June 2020, TWISTED SPIDER, the threat actor operating Maze ransomware, introduced a\nnew twist to their ransomware operations by announcing the creation of the “Maze Cartel” —\na collaboration between certain ransomware operators that results in victims’ exfiltrated\ninformation being hosted on multiple DLSs, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Screenshot of TWISTED SPIDER’s DLS implicating the Maze Cartel\n\nTo date, the Maze Cartel is confirmed to consist of TWISTED SPIDER, VIKING SPIDER (the\noperators of Ragnar Locker) and the operators of LockBit. Data-sharing activity observed by\nCrowdStrike Intelligence is displayed in Table 1.\n\n\n**Victim** **Ransomware Variant**\n**Involved**\n\n\n**Data Hosted By (and**\n**Date)**\n\n\nU.S.-based engineering company _LockBit_ TWISTED SPIDER\n(June 1)\n\n\nU.S.-based media and marketing\ncompany\n\n\nVIKING SPIDER’s Ragnar\n_Locker_\n\n\nTWISTED SPIDER\n(June 8)\n\n\nU.S.-based engineering company TWISTED SPIDER’s Maze TWISTED SPIDER\n(June 5)\nVIKING SPIDER (June\n11)\n\n**Table 1. Maze Cartel data-sharing activity to date**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn August 2020, operators of SunCrypt ransomware claimed they were a new addition to the\nMaze Cartel — the claim was refuted by TWISTED SPIDER. Duplication of a Norway-based\nvictim’s details on both the TWISTED SPIDER DLS and SunCrypt DLS contributed to\ntheories the adversaries were collaborating, though the data was also available on criminal\nforums at the time it appeared on SunCrypt’s DLS.\n\nAlso in August 2020, details of two victims were duplicated on both TWISTED SPIDER’s\nDLS and WIZARD SPIDER’s Conti DLS, resulting in theories that WIZARD SPIDER is a new\naddition to the Maze Cartel. However, TWISTED SPIDER made no reference to the inclusion\nof WIZARD SPIDER, and the duplication is potentially the result of the victims facing two\nintrusions by separate ransomware actors, or data being sold by WIZARD SPIDER to other\nthreat actors.\n\nThe exact nature of the collaboration between Maze Cartel’s members is unconfirmed; it is\nunknown if the actors actively participate in the same operations. Some of the actors share\nsimilar tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), including an initial aversion to targeting\nfrontline healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there are indications that\nadversaries are emulating successful techniques demonstrated by other members of the\ncartel . The Maze Cartel creates benefits for the adversaries involved, and potential pitfalls1\nfor victims. Less-established operators can host data on a more-established DLS, reducing\nthe risk of the data being taken offline by a public hosting provider. TWISTED SPIDER’s\nreputation as a prolific ransomware operator arguably bolsters the reputation of the newer\noperators and could encourage the victim to pay the ransom demand. A yet-to-be-seen but\nrealistic threat is that victims whose data is hosted in multiple locations could face\nnegotiations with multiple ransomware operators, potentially increasing the price of the\nransom to ensure the data’s removal and destruction.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCollaboration between eCrime operators is not uncommon — for example, WIZARD SPIDER\nhas a historically profitable arrangement involving the distribution of TrickBot by MUMMY\nSPIDER in Emotet spam campaigns. However, the apparent collaboration between members\nof the Maze Cartel is more unusual and has the potential to alter the TTPs used in the\nransomware threat landscape. Collaboration between operators may also place additional\npressure on the victim to meet the ransom demand, as the stolen data has gained increased\npublicity and has already been shared at least once. To date, the collaboration appears to\nfocus on data sharing, but should the collaboration escalate into combined or consecutive\nransomware operations, then the fallout and impact on victims could become significantly\nhigher.\n\nThe auctioning of victim data enables the monetization of exfiltrated data when victims are\nnot willing to pay ransoms, while incentivizing the original victims to pay the ransom amount\nin order to prevent the information from going public. Double ransoms potentially increase\n\n\n-----\n\nthe amount of money a ransomware operator can collect, but should the operators demand\nthe ransoms separately, victims may be more willing to pay for the deletion of data where\nreceiving decryptors is not a concern. As eCrime adversaries seek to further monetize their\nefforts, these trends will likely continue, with the auctioning of data occurring regardless of\nwhether or not the original ransom is paid.\n\nThe collaboration between Maze Cartel members and the auction feature on PINCHY\nSPIDER’s DLS may be combined in the future. It is possible that a criminal marketplace may\nbe created for ransomware operators to sell or auction data, share techniques and even sell\naccess to victims if they don’t have the time or capability to conduct such operations.\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has previously observed actors selling access to organizations on\ncriminal underground forums. However, these advertisements do not appear to be restricted\nto ransomware operations and could instead enable espionage and other nefarious activity.\n\nThese evolutions in data leak extortion techniques demonstrate the drive of these criminal\nactors to capitalize on their capabilities and increase monetization wherever possible. The\noverall trend of exfiltrating, selling and outright leaking victim data will likely continue as long\nas organizations are willing to pay ransoms. These tactics enable criminal actors to capitalize\non their efforts, even when companies have procedures in place to recover their data and\nare able to remove the actors from their environments.\n\nCurrently, the best protection against ransomware-related data leaks is prevention. Security\n[solutions such as the CrowdStrike Falcon® endpoint protection platform come with many](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/)\npreventive features to protect against threats like those outlined in this blog series. With\nfeatures that include machine learning, behavioral preventions and executable quarantining,\nthe Falcon platform has proven to be highly effective at stopping ransomware and other\ncommon techniques criminal organizations employ.\n\n**_This blog was written by CrowdStrike Intelligence analysts Zoe Shewell, Josh_**\n**_Reynolds, Sean Wilson and Molly Lane._**\n\n1. https[:]//news.sophos[.]com/en-us/2020/09/17/maze-attackers-adopt-ragnar-locker\nvirtual-machine-technique/\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_Read the first blog in this two-part series: “Double Trouble: Ransomware with Data_\n_Leak Extortion, Part 1.”_\n_[Download the CrowdStrike 2020 Global Threat Report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2020-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/)_\n_To learn more about how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors into your security_\n_strategy, visit the_ _[Falcon X™ Threat Intelligence page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)_\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ and learn how true next-](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
