The ngrok server software is self-hosted on a VPS or a dedicated server. It has\nthe ability to bypass NAT mapping and Firewall restriction.\n\nMultiple threat actors have abused the ngrok platform to gain unauthorized access to the\ntarget for delivering the additional payload, exfiltrating financial data such as credit/debit card\ninformation, and carrying out targeted phishing attacks.\n\nThe ngrok-based cyberattacks are harder to detect since they use random subdomains of\nngrok.com, besides bypassing security devices like Firewall, thereby making it an active\ntarget for cybercriminals.\n\nSample phishing page –\n\n**History of ngrok-based attacks:**\n\n[In 2019 cybercriminals abused ngrok tunnelling hosted on AWS to deliver Lokibot](https://securityboulevard.com/2019/05/digital-criminals-abusing-secure-tunneling-service-to-deliver-lokibot/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLast year, the Fox Kitten APT group targeted the private and government sector in the\n[U.S. The threat group was known for using ngrok to intrude on-premises BIG-IP](https://securityboulevard.com/2019/05/digital-criminals-abusing-secure-tunneling-service-to-deliver-lokibot/)\ndevices.\nIn September 2020, researchers identified the Pioneer kitten APT group, an Iran-based\nThreat group abusing the ngrok platform. The group was selling compromised\ncorporate credentials on cybercrime forums.\n\n**Investigation:**\n\nSome of the new strains of malware / phishing campaign using ngrok tunnelling are:\n\nNjrat\nDarkComet\nQuasar RAT\nasynrat\nNanocore RAT\n\nRecently, Cyble found that cybercriminals are abusing ngrok.io to deliver phishing attacks.\nThe image below showcases one of the phishing links captured in Cyble’s Intelligence\nrepository.\n\nInterestingly, we found multiple ngrok.io links used in darkweb markets/leaks and cybercrime\nforums by different threat actors such as BIN CARDERS, Telegram- carder data, and\nlinlogpass. The leaks were captured by Cyble’s Threat Intelligence platform, as shown in the\nbelow image.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyble research team also came across a post in a cybercrime forum about a phishing tool\nkit, “KingFish3 (Social master). The image below showcases the threat actor’s post about the\nphishing tool in the cybercrime forum. The threat actor also shared the Github link to the\nphishing tool, which abuses ngrok.\n\nThe actor described the usage of tools as shown in the following image, thereby showcasing\nmore information about how the ngrok tunnel is being used to carry out successful phishing\nattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe post contains step-by-step instructions on how to use the publicly available GitHub code.\nThe image below shows the output of the phishing tools along with the applications targeted.\n\nBased on further investigation and analysis of the phishing tool, we were able to identify\nprecisely how the cybercriminals abuse the ngrok tunnels to carry out phishing attacks\ntowards multiple organizations. Here are the steps based on our analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The tool creates a tunnel using ngrok to the chosen phishing URL with the specified\n\nport.\n2. The hacker tracks real-time logs in the first session and waits for the victims to enter\n\ntheir phone number.\n3. The hacker then logs into the affected application’s official site with the harvested\n\ncredentials and generates an OTP (2FA).\n4. Victims then enter the received OTP in the phishing site, which the hacker captures.\n5. Finally, the hacker gains access to the victims’ official account using the OTP(2FA).\n\nThe following are some of the ngrok based phishing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) – this\nlist is not exhaustive:\n\n4f421deb219c[.]ngrok[.]io 64bdaf63996c[.]ngrok[.]io\n\nfd4a5b0113b7[.]ngrok[.]io 7f37e07fc0f9[.]ngrok[.]io\n\n8c8a73773aef[.]ngrok[.]io ed23321e00e2[.]ngrok[.]io\n\n9be055fae612[.]ngrok[.]io 232fa25e1abe[.]ngrok[.]io\n\nb36a3cf2dc0f[.]ngrok[.]io 1b96bd67151a[.]ngrok[.]io\n\n2106ef42b27b[.]ngrok[.]io 98de9202cf1d[.]ngrok[.]io\n\nc1df5c5c340e[.]ngrok[.]io 8e3d3f5d9ca3[.]ngrok[.]io\n\nfc6cbeaa8cbb[.]ngrok[.]io 9d448ee31851[.]ngrok[.]io\n\nfe7544eeda51[.]ngrok[.]io 3b6859c00864[.]ngrok[.]io\n\ndcf4820d88b8[.]ngrok[.]io 4a826717681a[.]ngrok[.]io\n\nf7e82c8b73a6[.]ngrok[.]io bd69091[.]ngrok[.]io\n\n**How to report these malicious URLs for takedowns: It’s quite straightforward, just drop a**\nnote at [contact@ngrok.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:contact@ngrok.com)\n\n**Our Recommendations:**\n\nUsers of ngrok and other tunnelling services are advised to obtain authorization from\ntheir information security teams.\nIt is advised to password-protect their tunnel access and enable IP whitelisting to\nrestrict access to only trusted IP addresses.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other\nconnected devices wherever possible and pragmatic.\nRegularly monitor your financial transactions, and if you notice any suspicious activity,\ncontact your bank immediately.\n\n\n-----\n\nUse a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected\ndevices, including PC, laptop, and mobile.\nPeople concerned about their exposure to the Dark web can register\nat [AmiBreached.com to ascertain their exposure.](https://cyble.io/amibreached)\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their\nauthenticity.\n\n**About Cyble**\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect](https://cyble.com/)\nthemselves from cybercrimes and exposure in the darkweb.
