    "plain_text": "**Project Cobra and the Carbon System were mentioned by Kaspersky in the article called**\n\n**“The Epic Turla Operation” . This malware is used by the same actors as Uroburos (aka**\n\n**Snake/Turla) and Agent.BTZ. We estimate that Carbon System was developed after**\n\n**Agent.BTZ and before Uroburos. The Carbon System shares some technical details with**\n\n**Uroburos and Agent.BTZ (encryption key, encryption algorithm, design, …) and some**\n\n**other links, such as the name of the snake-related project: Cobra. Uroburos could be**\n\n**considered as a kernel centric “snake” and Cobra Carbon System as a userland centric**\n\n**“snake”.**\n\nOne specification of the group behind this threat is the fact that when they developed new tools, the old\n\nones are not destroyed or abandoned but still maintained and used. Thanks to our collection of samples\n\nwe are able to draw the following timeline:\n\nThe Cobra can be considered as an extensible framework. This framework is generally downloaded and\n\n[dropped by a reconnaissance malware for example Tavdig, aka Wipbot (Symantec) or also Epic Backdoor](http://securelist.com/analysis/publications/65545/the-epic-turla-operation/)\n\n(Kaspersky). The following schema illustrates the “modus opandi” used by the Uroburos actors:\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing IOC (Indicators of Compromise) to detect this malware is quite complicated, because the malware\n\nauthors made efforts to randomize many factors. For example, the attackers drop the malware into\n\ndifferent directories, using the files present, also chosen randomly, to store the malware configuration.\n\nDue to these characteristics, the experts of the G DATA SecurityLabs decided to publish an analysis of the\n\nframework dropped by the file with the md5: cb1b68d9971c2353c2d6a8119c49b51f. G DATA security\n\nsolutions detect this file as Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and Win32.Trojan.Cobra.B (Engine B).\n\nWe can find the compilation path in a file embedded in the\n\ndropper:f:\\Workshop\\Projects\\cobra\\carbon_system\\x64\\Release\\carbon_system.pdb\n\nLooking at this, we can easily identify that “Carbon System” is a part of the “Cobra” project.\n\n## Dropper\n\nThe dropper is used to install four files on the infected system. The dropped files are stored in the\n\nresources of the binary. The dropper has the 32-bit and the 64-bit version of the executable files\n\nembedded. It installs the following files:\n\nminiport.dat: configuration file;\n\nstage 1: the file name is randomly chosen from ipvpn.dll,srsvc.dll or kmsvc.dll. This library is\n\nregistered as a service;\n\nstage 2: the file name is msimghlp.dll. It’s the orchestrator of the malware (called “system” by the\n\nauthor);\n\nstage 3: the file name is msximl.dll. This library (called “user” by the authors) is injected in the\n\n\n-----\n\nThe persistence is performed by the creation of a service (HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Service\\).\n\nThe service name depends on the chosen stage 1 file name:\n\n**File** **Service** **Display** **Description**\n**Name** **Name** **Name** **(Copy&Paste from the binary)**\n\nVirtual\n\nProvides enchanced network management while active VPN connection\n\nPrivate\n\nestablished.

Enforcement technologies that use virtual networks may not\n\nRouting\n\nfunction properly without this service\n\nService\n\nSystem\n\nPerforms system restore functions.

The three other\n\ndropped files are stored in an existing directory in %ProgramFiles%, randomly chosen.\n\nDuring the installation, executed in a command line, the dropper displays the following information:\n\nThe screenshot shows the string “LUCKY STRIKE!!!”, displayed in case the installation was carried out\n\n|File Name|Service Name|Display Name|Description (Copy&Paste from the binary)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|ipvpn.dll|ipvpn|Virtual Private Network Routing Service|Provides enchanced network management while active VPN connection established.

Enforcement technologies that use virtual networks may not function properly without this service|\n|srsvc.dll|srservice|System Restore Service|Performs system restore functions. To stop service, turn off System Restore from the System Restore tab in My Computer.|\n|kmsvc.dll|hkmsvc|Health Key and Certificate Management Service|Provides X.509 certificate and key management services for the Network Access Protection Agent (NAPAgent). Enforcement technologies that use X.509 certificates may not function properly without this service|\n\n\n-----\n\npath, the dropper modifies a legitimate .inf file (also chosen randomly) in %SystemRoot%\\inf\\ to add the\n\nfollowing information to the end of the file:\n\n[B8744A58]root=C:\\Program Files\\Windows NT\\Accessoiries\\en-US\n\nThe ID between the brackets is a unique ID and the root variable contains the path in which the three\n\nadditional files are installed.\n\nThe tricks put in place by the authors – random file names and random installation paths – are used to\n\nlimit the detection possible with Indicators of Compromise. Generally, security researchers use these\n\nkinds of artifacts in order to detect the compromise of systems.\n\n## Stage 1: loader\n\nMD5: 43e896ede6fe025ee90f7f27c6d376a4G DATA security solutions detect this as\n\nBackdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and   Win32.Trojan.Cobra.A (Engine B).\n\nThe first stage is rather small as the number of instructions and actions is rather small. Simply spoken, its\n\npurpose is to load the second stage. To perform this task, the first stage checks all of the files in\n\n%SystemRoot%\\inf\\ in order to find the entry with the unique ID previously mentioned and therefore to\n\ndetermine the path for stage 2. After that, the library of the second stage is loaded and, subsequently, the\n\nexported function ModuleStart() is executed:\n\n\n-----\n\nMd5: e6d1dcc6c2601e592f2b03f35b06fa8f\n\nVersion: 3.71\n\nG DATA security solutions detect this threat as Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and\n\nWin32.Trojan.Cobra.B (Engine B).\n\nThe second stage is called “system” by the authors of the malware. The internal name of the library is\n\ncarbon_system.dll.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to stay in background and orchestrate several requests and tasks made by the\n\nother .dlls or named pipe connections.\n\n### Mutex creation\n\nThe orchestrator creates several mutexes. These mutexes are used for two reasons:\n\nused by the third stage in order to detect whether the orchestrator has been launched correctly on\n\nthe infected system;\n\nused to execute the orchestrator only once.\n\nHere are the created mutexes:\n\nGlobal\\MSCTF.Shared.MUTEX.zRX\n\nGlobal\\DBWindowsBase\n\nGlobal\\IEFrame.LockDefaultBrowser\n\nGlobal\\WinSta0_DesktopSessionMut\n\nGlobal\\{5FA3BC02-920F-D42A-68BC-04F2A75BE158}\n\nGlobal\\SENS.LockStarterCacheResource\n\nGlobal\\ShimSharedMemoryLock\n\n### Working files and directories\n\nHere are the working files and directories used by the orchestrator. The orchestrator creates one single\n\nrandom path and then stores all necessary folders mentioned under this one randomly generated path:\n\n%randompath%\\Nls\\: directory related to the tasks to be executed\n\n%randompath%\\0208\\: directory related to the temporary files\n\n%randompath%\\System\\: directory related to the additional plugins\n\n%randompath%\\System\\bootmisc.sdi: seems not to be used\n\n%randompath%\\0208\\C 56743 NLS: files related to the tasks to be executed and the plugins\n\n\n-----\n\n%randompath%\\Nls\\a67ncodc.ax: file related to the tasks to be executed\n\n%randompath%\\vndkrmn.dic: log file\n\n%randompath%\\qavsrc.dat: log file\n\n%randompath%\\miniport.dat: configuration file\n\n%randompath%\\asmcerts.rs: purpose currently unknown\n\n%randompath%\\getcert.rs: purpose currently unknown\n\nThe files are not automatically created during the startup of the malware. The files are created only if the\n\norchestrator needs them.\n\n### Configuration file\n\nThe configuration file (miniport.dat) is used by the second and the third stage. The file is encrypted with\n\n[the CAST-128 algorithm, the same algorithm that has been used by Uroburos to encrypt the file systems.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAST-128)\n\nThe encryption key is:\n\n{ 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 0x9a, 0xbc, 0xde, 0xf0, 0xfe, 0xfc, 0xba, 0x98, 0x76, 0x54, 0x32, 0x10 }\n\nNote: following the logic, 0xfc would be expected to be 0xdc.\n\nHere is an example of the configuration file:\n\npaul@gdata:~/Carbon/$ ./decrypt.py miniport.dat\n\n[NAME]\n\nobject_id=acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1\n\niproc = iexplore.exe,outlook.exe,msimn.exe,firefox.exe,opera.exe,chrome.exe\n\nex = #,netscape.exe,mozilla.exe,adobeupdater.exe,chrome.exe\n\n[TIME]\n\nuser_winmin = 1800000\n\nuser_winmax = 3600000\n\nsys_winmin = 3600000\n\nsys_winmax = 3700000\n\ntask_min = 20000\n\ntask_max = 30000\n\ncheckmin = 60000\n\ncheckmax = 70000\n\nlogmin = 60000\n\nlogmax = 120000\n\nlastconnect=1419925298\n\n\n-----\n\nactive_con = 900000\n\ntime2task=3600000\n\ncheck_lastconnect=1419925298\n\n[CW_LOCAL]\n\nquantity = 0\n\n[CW_INET]\n\nquantity = 4\n\naddress1 = soheylistore.ir:80:/modules/mod_feed/feed.php\n\naddress2 = tazohor.com:80:/wp-includes/feed-rss-comments.php\n\naddress3 = jucheafrica.com:80:/wp-includes/class-wp-edit.php\n\naddress4 = 61paris.fr:80:/wp-includes/ms-set.php\n\n[CW_INET_RESULTS]\n\nquantity = 4\n\naddress1 = soheylistore.ir:80:/modules/mod_feed/feed.php\n\naddress2 = tazohor.com:80:/wp-includes/feed-rss-comments.php\n\naddress3 = jucheafrica.com:80:/wp-includes/class-wp-edit.php\n\naddress4 = 61paris.fr:80:/wp-includes/ms-set.php\n\n[TRANSPORT]\n\nsystem_pipe = comnap\n\nspstatus = yes\n\nadaptable = no\n\n[DHCP]\n\nserver = 135\n\n[LOG]\n\nlogperiod = 7200\n\nlastsend=1419924312\n\n[WORKDATA]\n\nrun_task=\n\n\n-----\n\n[VERSION]\n\nSystem=3/71\n\nUser=3/62\n\nThe websites listed in [CW_INET] and [CW_INET_RESULTS] are all compromised legitimate WordPress\n\nwebsites. By the time of writing this article, all websites have been cleaned and patched.\n\nThe file format is the same as the .ini file format from Windows. The authors use the Windows API to\n\nparse the configuration (GetPrivateProfileStringA()).The file contains:\n\nA unique ID to identify the infected machine (object_id);\n\nThe command and control server used by stage 3 (addressX);\n\nThe version of the “system” and the “user” library (in [VERSION]);\n\nThe frequency and time of execution of several internal tasks ([TIME]);\n\nThe name of the named pipe used as communication channel between the “system” and the “user”\n\n(system_pipe);\n\nThe process name where stage 3 will be injected (iproc);\n\n…\n\n### Communication via named pipes\n\nThe orchestrator creates two named pipes in order to communicate with stage 3 or to receive messages\n\nfrom an external machine:\n\n\\\\.\\\\pipe\\sdlrpc\n\n\\\\.\\\\pipe\\comnap (the name in the configuration file)\n\n### Features\n\nThe orchestrator creates nine threads in order to handle the different features. We will now have a look at\n\nthe most interesting threads.\n\nOne thread is used to check if the parameters in the configuration file have changed.\n\nA second thread is used to check the available hard disk space. If the HDD space is low, the orchestrator\n\ngenerates an entry in the log file:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe preceding screenshot reveals a rather interesting use of English, again. From what we can conclude,\n\nwe believe “Survive me” is supposed to mean something like “Rescue me” in the sense of “help me to\n\nsurvive”.\n\nA third thread is created in order to handle the tasks. A task is a command sent from the C&C that is to be\n\nexecuted. The code to be executed is stored locally on the infected machine. The orchestrator is able to\n\nexecute libraries (by executing the export start()) or to execute Windows’ command line. The command\n\nline can be execute with the current user privilege or with the privilege of another user (via\n\nCreateProcessA() or CreateProcessAsUserA()):\n\nA fourth thread is used to handle the log rotation file (vndkrmn.dic).\n\nA fifth thread is used to create and read the data sent to the named pipes.\n\nA sixth thread is used to load plugins. For the orchestrator a module is a library file with a specific export\n\ncalled ModuleStart(). The plugin list is stored in the configuration file ([PLUGINS]). This thread is very\n\nsimilar to the third thread, but is bares some minor differences. The function to execute the plugins is not\n\nthe same.\n\nFinally a seventh thread is used to inject stage 3 (msximl.dll) into the browsers and email clients. The list\n\nof the targeted processes is stored in the configuration file:\n\niproc = iexplore.exe,outlook.exe,msimn.exe,firefox.exe,opera.exe,chrome.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n### Log file\n\nThe orchestrator and stage 3 generate a shared log file. The file is encrypted with the same algorithm and\n\nthe same key as the configuration file. Here is an example of the content:\n\npaul@gdata:~/Carbon$ ./decrypt.py infected/vndkrmn.dic\n\n[LOG]\n\nstart=1\n\n30/12/14|08:28:44|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|ST|3/71|0|\n\n30/12/14|08:29:50|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|INJ|C:\\Program Files\\Windows Mail\\en\nUS\\msximl.dll|\n\n30/12/14|08:30:28|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|INJ|0|2204|\n\n30/12/14|08:30:28|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|ST|3/62|\"C:\\Program Files\\Internet\n\nExplorer\\iexplore.exe\" :2204|\n\n30/12/14|08:30:28|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|ST|2204:END|\n\n30/12/14|08:30:39|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|W|-1|0|ALL|NOINET|\n\n30/12/14|08:30:41|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|W|-1|0|ALL|NOINET|\n\n30/12/14|08:37:18|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|STOP|3/71|0|\n\n30/12/14|08:37:18|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|STOP|OK|\n\n30/12/14|08:39:45|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|ST|3/71|0|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:13|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|INJ|C:\\Program Files\\Windows Mail\\en\nUS\\msximl.dll|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:34|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|s|INJ|0|2196|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:34|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|ST|3/62|\"C:\\Program Files\\Internet\n\nExplorer\\iexplore.exe\" :2196|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:34|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|ST|2196:END|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:35|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|OPER|Wrong config: no lastconnect|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:36|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|P|0|NULL|0|Sleep:41|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:38|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|OPER|Wrong config: no lastconnect|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:39|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|W|-1|0|tazohor.com:/|nrt|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:40|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|W|-1|0|61paris.fr:/|nrt|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:40|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|W|0|NULL|0|Sleep:1816467|\n\n30/12/14|08:41:40|acce6511-ba11-fa11-f0047d1|u|P|0|NULL|0|Sleep:604\n\nThe log format is:Date|Time|Unique ID|source|message\n\n\n-----\n\nS: stands for the orchestrator (or “System”);\n\nU: stands for the injected library (or “User”).\n\nThe format of the message is not always the same. However, the first part is the executed feature:\n\nST: start (either for the orchestrator or the injected library); the second part of the message is the\n\nversion (for example 3.71 for the orchestrator and 3.62 for the injected library) and, regarding the\n\ninjected library, the name of the host process;\n\nSTOP: stop;\n\nOPER: message for the operator (for example when the disk space is low);\n\nW: web requests;\n\nINJ: injection; the second part of the message is the path of the file (lib) used to be injected into e.g.\n\nthe browser or the PID;\n\nL: load library log message;\n\nS: log rotation message;\n\nT: message linked to the task execution;\n\n## Stage 3: the injected library\n\nMd5: 554450c1ecb925693fedbb9e56702646\n\nVersion: 3.62\n\nThis threat is detected by G DATA security solutions as Backdoor.TurlaCarbon.A (Engine A) and\n\nWin32.Trojan.Cobra.B (Engine B).\n\nStage 3 is called “user” by the authors. The internal name of the library is CARBON.dll.The purpose of this\n\nstage is to communicate to the outside via web requests. The communication is used to ex-filtrate data and\n\nto receive orders (or plugins or code to execute).\n\n### Mutex check\n\nThe first task of stage 3 is to check whether the mutexes created by the orchestrator are available or not, to\n\nmake sure the orchestrator has started correctly:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Check of the Internet connection\n\nBefore communicating with the command and control server, stage 3 checks whether an Internet\n\nconnection is available by contacting:\n\nwww.google.com\n\nwww.yahoo.com\n\nwww.bing.com\n\nupdate.microsoft.com\n\nwindowsupdate.microsoft.com\n\nmicrosoft.com\n\nIn case the connection does not work, the following message is written into the log\n\nfile:|u|W|-1|0|ALL|NOINET|\n\n### Communication to the command & controls\n\nThe communication to the operators is performed via the URL stored in the configuration file.\n\nFirstly, the malware performs a GET request in order to identify whether the C&C is up and running.\n\nIf the first query is a success, a second request is sent to the C&C with the difference that some data is\n\n[included into an HTTP Cookie. The content of the cookie is catid, task, id, forumid, itemid, link, layout,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie)\n\nstart, limit (none of the parameters is mandatory). The data sent in this cookie is encrypted, using the\n\nCAST-128 algorithm, and encoded.\n\n\n-----\n\nuid=%d&context=%s&mode=text&data=%s\n\n[The malware uses the same technique as Tavdig does to receive orders. The data can be seen between the](https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/http://)\n\n<div> and the </div> field in the following screenshot:\n\n### Additional features\n\nStage 3 is able to execute tasks, exactly as the orchestrator is. The code concerning the features is exactly\n\nthe same as the code the orchestrator uses. We assume that this is the case due to copy & paste. The “user”\n\nis able to execute libraries (by executing the export start()) and to execute Windows command line. The\n\ncommand line can be executed with the current user privilege or with the privilege of another user (via\n\nCreateProcessA() or CreateProcessAsUserA()).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis analysis shows us that the actors behind Uroburos, Agent.BTZ and the Carbon System are skilled and\n\nstill active. This sample we analyzed demonstrates how the authors tried to complicate the detection and\n\nthe use of Indicators of Compromise. Summarized, some of the tricks we have encountered:\n\nuse of random service names;\n\nus of random file names;\n\nuse of random installation directory names;\n\n\n-----\n\n…\n\nCarbon System is a real extensible framework with a plugin management. As these plugins are provided by\n\nthe contacted C&C servers, it can be anything – nothing has to be pre-bundled. Due to the nature of the\n\nmalware attacks, we can imagine those plugins to be anything connected to cyber espionage, from\n\nkeyloggers to credentials stealers, eavesdropping mechanisms and much more. An attacked enterprise or\n\norganization would be an open book for the attackers.\n\nThe architecture is complex, with an orchestrator and a library injected into the browsers’ and email\n\nclients’ processes. Obviously, this approach resembles what we have seen looking at Uroburos. The\n\nframework could be considered as a “draft” but still very powerful version (in user-land only) of Uroburos.\n\nWe believe that Uroburos is the product of the Cobra malware evolution. Although Uroburos is a new\n\nbranch, not a linear follow-up.\n\nLooking at the whole picture that we can draw until now, we can say that everything regarding this whole\n\ncampaign is highly professional. We have analyzed various samples and have drawn many conclusions.\n\nEven though there are still many open questions that need to be answered, we come closer to charming\n\nthe snakes – The Cobra, the venomous animal with the deadly bite, and Uroburos, the self-sustaining\n\ncreepy mixture of a snake and a dragon. This kind of herpetology became quite interesting and we are\n\nthrilled to find out more about the campaigns.\n\n\n-----",
