Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying\nsizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and\nagriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and\ntransportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\nmodel where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools\nand infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit\nransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This\nvariance in observed ransomware TTPs presents a notable challenge for organizations working to\nmaintain network security and protect against a ransomware threat.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),\nthe Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the following international\npartners, hereafter referred to as “authoring organizations,” are releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory\n(CSA) detailing observed activity in LockBit ransomware incidents and providing recommended\nmitigations to enable network defenders to proactively improve their organization’s defenses against\nthis ransomware operation.\n\n     - Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)\n\n     - Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS)\n\n     - United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)\n\n     - National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI)\n\n     - Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)\n\n     - New Zealand’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT NZ) and National Cyber\nSecurity Centre (NCSC NZ)\n\nThe authoring organizations encourage the implementation of the recommendations found in this\nCSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of future ransomware incidents.\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nSummary ............................................................................................................................................. 2\n\nTechnical Details ................................................................................................................................. 4\n\nIntroduction ...................................................................................................................................... 4\n\nLockBit Statistics .............................................................................................................................. 5\n\nTools ................................................................................................................................................ 8\n\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) Exploited ............................................................. 14\n\nPost Detonation TTPs .................................................................................................................... 14\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques .......................................................................................... 15\n\nMitigations ......................................................................................................................................... 21\n\nInitial Access .................................................................................................................................. 21\n\nExecution ....................................................................................................................................... 23\n\nPrivilege Escalation........................................................................................................................ 24\n\nDefense Evasion ............................................................................................................................ 24\n\nCredential Access .......................................................................................................................... 24\n\nDiscovery ....................................................................................................................................... 24\n\nLateral Movement .......................................................................................................................... 24\n\nCommand and Control ................................................................................................................... 25\n\nExfiltration ...................................................................................................................................... 25\n\nImpact ............................................................................................................................................ 25\n\nImplement Mitigations for Defense-in-Depth .................................................................................. 25\n\nValidate Security Controls ................................................................................................................. 27\n\nResources ......................................................................................................................................... 27\n\nReporting ........................................................................................................................................... 29\n\nDisclaimer ......................................................................................................................................... 30\n\nReferences ........................................................................................................................................ 30\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**[Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/matrices/enterprise/)** framework, version 13.1.

In 2022, LockBit was the most active global ransomware group and RaaS provider\n[in terms of the number of victims claimed on their data leak site. [1] A RaaS cybercrime group](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-by-the-numbers/lockbit-blackcat-and-royal-dominate-the-ransomware-scene-ransomware-in-q4-2022)\nmaintains the functionality of a particular ransomware variant, sells access to that ransomware variant\nto individuals or groups of operators (often referred to as “affiliates”), and supports affiliates’\ndeployment of their ransomware in exchange for upfront payment, subscription fees, a cut of profits,\nor a combination of upfront payment, subscription fees, and a cut of profits. Some of the methods\nLockBit has used to successfully attract affiliates include, but are not limited to:\n\n     - Assuring payment by allowing affiliates to receive ransom payments before sending a cut to\nthe core group; this practice stands in stark contrast to other RaaS groups who pay\nthemselves first and then disburse the affiliates’ cut.\n\n     - Disparaging other RaaS groups in online forums.\n\n     - Engaging in publicity-generating activities stunts, such as paying people to get LockBit tattoos\nand putting a $1 million bounty on information related to the real-world identity of LockBit’s\nlead who goes by the persona “LockBitSupp.”\n\n     - Developing and maintaining a simplified, point-and-click interface for its ransomware, making\nit accessible to those with a lower degree of technical skill. [2, 3]\n\nLockBit has been successful through innovation and ongoing development of the group’s\nadministrative panel and the RaaS supporting functions. In parallel, affiliates that work with LockBit\nand other notable variants are constantly revising the TTPs used for deploying and executing\nransomware.\n\nTable 1 shows LockBit RaaS’s innovation and development.\n\n_Table 1: Evolution of LockBit RaaS_\n\n|Date|Event|\n|---|---|\n|September 2019|First observed activity of ABCD ransomware, the predecessor to LockBit.

In\nabout 13% of those cases, ANSSI was not able to confirm nor deny the breach of its constituents’\nnetworks – as the alerts were related to the threat actor’s online claims. So far, 69 confirmed incidents\nhave been handled by ANSSI. Table 2 shows the LockBit activity observed by ANSSI versus overall\nransomware activity tracked by the Computer Emergency Response Team-France (CERT-FR).\n\n_Table 2: ANSSI-Observed LockBit vs. Overall Ransomware Activity_\n\n|Year|Number of Incidents|Percentage of CERT-FR’s Ransomware-Related Activity|\n|---|---|---|\n|2020 (from July)|4|2%|\n|2021|20|10%|\n|2022|30|27%|\n|2023|15|27%|\n|Total (2020-2023)|69|11%|\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\nTable 3 shows the number of instances different LockBit strains were observed by ANSSI from July\n2020 to present.\n\n_Table 3: ANSSI-Observed LockBit Strain and Number of Instances_\n\n**Name of the Strain*** **Number of Instances**\n\nLockBit 2.0 (LockBit Red) 26\n\nLockBit 3.0 (LockBit Black) 23\n\nLockBit 21\n\nLockBit Green 1\n\nLockBit (pre-encryption) 1\n\n**Total** **72****\n\n_* Name either obtained from ANSSI’s or the victim’s investigations_\n\n_** Includes incidents with multiple strains_\n\n_Figure 1: ANSSI-Observed LockBit Strains by Year_\n\nFrom the incidents handled, ANSSI can infer that LockBit 3.0 widely took over from LockBit 2.0 and\nthe original LockBit strain from 2022. In two cases, victims were infected with as many as three\ndifferent strains of LockBit (LockBit 2.0/Red, LockBit 3.0/Black, and LockBit Green).\n\n#### Leak Sites\nThe authoring agencies observe data leak sites, where attackers publish the names and captured\ndata of victims if they do not pay ransom or hush money. Additionally, these sites can be used to\nrecord alleged victims who have been threatened with a data leak. The term 'victims' may include\nthose who have been attacked, or those who have been threatened or blackmailed (with the attack\nhaving taken place).\n\nThe leak sites only show the portion of LockBit affiliates’ victims subjected to secondary extortion.\nSince 2021, LockBit affiliates have employed double extortion by first encrypting victim data and then\nexfiltrating that data while threatening to post that stolen data on leak sites. Because LockBit only\nreveals the names and leaked data of victims who refuse to pay the primary ransom to decrypt their\ndata, some LockBit victims may never be named or have their exfiltrated data posted on leak sites. As\na result, the leak sites reveal a portion of LockBit affiliates’ total victims. For these reasons, the leak\nsites are not a reliable indicator of when LockBit ransomware attacks occurred. The date of data\npublication on the leak sites may be months after LockBit affiliates actually executed ransomware\nattacks.\n\n|Name of the Strain*|Number of Instances|\n|---|---|\n|LockBit 2.0 (LockBit Red)|26|\n|LockBit 3.0 (LockBit Black)|23|\n|LockBit|21|\n|LockBit Green|1|\n|LockBit (pre-encryption)|1|\n|Total|72**|\n\n\n_Figure 1: ANSSI-Observed LockBit Strains by Year_\n\nFrom the incidents handled, ANSSI can infer that LockBit 3.0 widely took over from LockBit 2.0 and\nthe original LockBit strain from 2022.

The date of data\npublication on the leak sites may be months after LockBit affiliates actually executed ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\nUp to the Q1 2023, a total of 1,653 alleged victims were observed on LockBit leak sites. With the\nintroduction of LockBit 2.0 and LockBit 3.0, the leak sites have changed, with some sources choosing\nto differentiate leak sites by LockBit versions and others ignoring any differentiation. Over time, and\nthrough different evolutions of LockBit, the address and layout of LockBit leak sites have changed and\nare aggregated under the common denominator of the LockBit name. The introduction of LockBit 2.0\nat the end of the Q2 2021 had an immediate impact on the cybercriminal market due to multiple RaaS\noperations shutting down in May and June 2021 (e.g., DarkSide and Avaddon). LockBit competed\nwith other RaaS operations, like Hive RaaS, to fill the gap in the cybercriminal market leading to an\ninflux of LockBit affiliates. Figure 2 shows the alleged number of victims worldwide on LockBit leak\nsites starting in Q3 2020.\n\n_Figure 2: Alleged Number of Victims Worldwide on LockBit Leak Sites_\n\n### Tools\n\nDuring their intrusions, LockBit affiliates have been observed using various freeware and open-source\ntools that are intended for legal use.. When repurposed by LockBit, these tools are then used for a\nrange of malicious cyber activity, such as network reconnaissance, remote access and tunneling,\ncredential dumping, and file exfiltration. Use of PowerShell and batch scripts are observed across\nmost intrusions, which focus on system discovery, reconnaissance, password/credential hunting, and\nprivilege escalation. Artifacts of professional penetration-testing tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt\nStrike have also been observed.\n\nTable 4 shows a list of legitimate freeware and open-source tools LockBit affiliates have repurposed\nfor ransomware operations. The legitimate freeware and open-source tools mentioned in this product\nare all publicly available and legal. The use of these tools by a threat actor should not be attributed to\nthe freeware and open-source tools, absent specific articulable facts tending to show they are used at\nthe direction or under the control of a threat actor.\n\n_Table 4: Freeware and Open-Source Tools Used by LockBit Affiliates_\n\n|Tool|Intended Use|Repurposed Use by LockBit Affiliates|MITRE ATT&CK ID|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n|7-zip|Compresses files into an archive.|Compresses data to avoid detection before exfiltration.|T1562 Impair Defenses|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|AdFind|Searches Active Directory (AD) and gathers information.|Gathers AD information used to exploit a victim’s network, escalate privileges, and facilitate lateral movement.|S0552 AdFind|\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n**Repurposed Use by**\n**Tool** **Intended Use** **MITRE ATT&CK ID**\n**LockBit Affiliates**\n\nMaps a victim’s\n\nPerforms network [T1046](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v13/techniques/T1046/)\n\nAdvanced Internet network to identify\n\nscans and shows Network Service\n\nProtocol (IP) Scanner potential access\n\nnetwork devices.

Once the primary target is hit, LockBit affiliates\nthen attempt to extort the companies that are customers of the primary target. This extortion is in the\nform of secondary ransomware that locks down services those customers consume. Additionally, the\nprimary target’s customers may be extorted by LockBit affiliates threatening to release those\ncustomers’ sensitive information.\n\n|Tool|Intended Use|Repurposed Use by LockBit

Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals)\n[Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals) for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n\nThe listed mitigations are ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactic. Mitigations that apply to multiple MITRE\nATT&CK tactics are listed under the tactic that occurs earliest in an incident’s lifecycle. For example,\naccount use polices are mitigations for initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, and credential\naccess but would be listed under initial access mitigations.\n\n### Initial Access\n\n     - **Consider implementing sandboxed browsers to protect systems from malware originating**\nfrom web browsing. Sandboxed browsers isolate the host machine from malicious code.\n\n     - **Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and**\n[domain admin accounts) to comply with NIST standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) for developing and managing\n[password policies [CPG 2.L].](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\n```\n        o Enforce use of longer passwords consisting of at least 15 characters in length [CPG\n\n```\n2.B, 2.C].\n```\n        o Store passwords in a salted and hashed format using industry-recognized password\n\n```\nhashing algorithms.\n```\n        o Prevent use of commonly used or known-compromised passwords [CPG 2.C].\n        o Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts [CPG 2.G].\n        o Disable password “hints.”\n        o Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year. \n\n```\n**Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular**\n\n|Technique Title|ID|Use|\n|---|---|---|\n|Defacement: Internal Defacement|T1491.001|LockBit 3.0 changes the host system’s wallpaper and icons to the LockBit 3.0 wallpaper and icons, respectively.|\n|Inhibit System Recovery|T1490|LockBit 3.0 deletes volume shadow copies residing on disk.|\n|Service Stop|T1489|LockBit 3.0 terminates processes and services.|\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\nand frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in\nusers developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.\n```\n        o Require administrator credentials to install software [CPG 2.Q].\n\n```\n     - **Implement filters at the email gateway to filter out emails with known malicious indicators,**\n[such as known malicious subject lines, and block suspicious IP addresses at the firewall [CPG](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\n2.M].\n\n     - **Install a web application firewall and configure with appropriate rules to protect enterprise**\nassets.\n\n     - **Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help**\nprevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—\nvarious subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. Isolate web-facing\n[applications to further minimize the spread of ransomware across a network [CPG 2.F].](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\n\n     - **Follow the least-privilege best practice by requiring administrators to use administrative**\naccounts for managing systems and use simple user accounts for non-administrative tasks\n\n[[CPG 2.E].](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\n\n     - **Enforce the management of and audit user accounts with administrative privileges.**\n[Configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege [CPG 2.E].](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\n\n     - **Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For**\nexample, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed\nand can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust\nmodel). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable\nadmin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual\nusers may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a\nspecified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain\ntask.\n\n     - **Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date. Timely patching is one of**\nthe most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to\ncybersecurity threats. Public-facing applications must be patched in a timely manner as\nvulnerabilities can often be exploited directly by the threat actor. By closely monitoring the\nthreat landscape, threat actors often take advantage of vulnerabilities before systems are\npatched. Organizations should patch vulnerable software and hardware systems within 24 to\n[48 hours from when a vulnerability is disclosed. Prioritize patching known exploited](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n[vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) [in internet-facing systems [CPG 1.E].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\n\n     - **Restrict service accounts from remotely accessing other systems. Configure group**\npolicy to Deny log on locally, Deny log on through Terminal Services, and Deny\n```\n      access to this computer from the network for all service accounts to limit the\n\n```\nability for compromised service accounts to be used for lateral movement.\n\n     - **Block direct internet access for administration interfaces (e.g., application protocol**\ninterface (API)) and for remote access.\n\n     - **Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent**\npossible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and privileged accounts that access\n[critical systems [CPG 2.H].](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n     - **Consolidate, monitor, and defend internet gateways.**\n\n     - **Install, regularly update, and enable real-time detection for antivirus software on all**\nhosts.\n\n     - **Raise awareness for phishing threats in your organization. Phishing is one of the primary**\ninfection vectors in ransomware campaigns, and all employees should receive practical\ntraining on the risks associated with the regular use of email. With the rise of sophisticated\nphishing methods, such as using stolen email communication or artificial intelligence (AI)\nsystems such as ChatGPT, the distinction between legitimate and malicious emails becomes\nmore complex. This particularly applies to employees from corporate divisions that have to\n[deal with a high volume of external email communication (e.g., staff recruitment) [CPG 2.I,](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\n2.J].\n\n     - **Consider adding an external email warning banner for emails sent to or** received from\noutside of your organization [CPG 2.M].\n\n     - **Review internet-facing services and disable any services that are no longer a business**\n**requirement to be exposed or restrict access to only those users with an explicit requirement**\nto access services, such as SSL, VPN, or RDP. If internet-facing services must be used,\n[control access by only allowing access from an admin IP range [CPG 2.X].](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\n\n     - **Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or**\nunrecognized accounts.\n\n     - **Regularly verify the security level of the Active Directory domain by checking for**\nmisconfigurations.\n\n### Execution\n\n     - **Develop and regularly update comprehensive network diagram(s) that describes systems**\n[and data flows within your organization’s network(s) [CPG 2.P].](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\n\n     - **Control and restrict network connections accordingly with a network flow matrix.**\n\n     - **[Enable enhanced PowerShell logging [CPG 2.T, 2.U].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)**\n```\n        o PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS, registry interaction, and\n\n```\npossibility of a threat actor’s PowerShell use.\n```\n        o Ensure PowerShell instances are configured to use the latest version, and have\n\n```\nmodule, script block, and transcription logging enabled (enhanced logging).\n```\n        o The two logs that record PowerShell activity are the PowerShell Windows Event Log\n\n```\nand the PowerShell Operational Log. It is recommended to turn on these two\nWindows Event Logs with a retention period of at least 180 days. These logs should be\nchecked on a regular basis to confirm whether the log data has been deleted or\nlogging has been turned off. Set the storage size permitted for both logs to as large as\nreasonably practical.\n\n     - **Configure the Windows Registry to require UAC approval for any PsExec operations**\nrequiring administrator privileges to reduce the risk of lateral movement by PsExec.\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n### Privilege Escalation\n\n     - **Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and**\nlateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat\nactors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or\n[moving laterally [CPG 2.N].](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\n\n     - **Enable Credential Guard to protect your Windows system credentials. This is enabled by**\ndefault on Windows 11 Enterprise 22H2 and Windows 11 Education 22H2. Credential Guard\nprevents credential dumping techniques of the Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets. Be\naware that enabling this security control has some downsides. In particular, you can no longer\nuse New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM) classic authentication\nsingle sign-on, Kerberos unconstrained delegation, as well as Data Encryption Standard\n(DES) encryption.\n\n     - **Implement Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) where possible if your OS is**\nolder than Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 as these versions do not have LAPS built\nin. NOTE: The authoring organizations recommend organizations upgrade to Windows Server\n2019 and Windows 10 or greater.\n\n### Defense Evasion\n\n     - **Apply local security policies to control application execution (e.g., Software Restriction**\nPolicies (SRP), AppLocker, Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)) with a strict\nallowlist.\n\n     - **Establish an application allowlist of approved software applications and binaries that are**\nallowed to be executed on a system. This measure prevents unwanted software to be run.\nUsually, application allowlist software can also be used to define blocklists so that the\nexecution of certain programs can be blocked, for example cmd.exe or PowerShell.exe\n\n[CPG 2.Q].\n\n### Credential Access\n\n     - **Restrict NTLM uses with security policies and firewalling.**\n\n### Discovery\n\n     - **Disable unused** **ports. Disable ports that are not being used for business purposes (e.g.,**\nRDP-TCP Port 3389). Close unused RDP ports.\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\n     - **Identify Active Directory control paths and eliminate the most critical among them**\naccording to the business needs and assets.\n\n     - **Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the**\n**indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the**\nransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n[movement activity on a network [CPG 1.E]. EDR tools are particularly useful for detecting](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\nlateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for\neach host.\n\n### Command and Control\n\n     - **Implement a tiering model by creating trust zones dedicated to an organization’s most**\nsensitive assets.\n\n     - **VPN access should not be considered as a trusted network zone. Organizations should**\ninstead consider moving to zero trust architectures.\n\n### Exfiltration\n\n     - **Block connections to known malicious systems by using a Transport Layer Security (TLS)**\nProxy. Malware often uses TLS to communicate with the infrastructure of the threat actor. By\nusing feeds for known malicious systems, the establishment of a connection to a C2 server\ncan be prevented.\n\n     - **Use web filtering or a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) to restrict or monitor access**\nto public-file sharing services that may be used to exfiltrate data from a network.\n\n### Impact\n\n     - **Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary**\ndata and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive,\n[storage device, the cloud) [CPG 2.R].](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cpg-report)\n\n     - **Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration (daily or**\nweekly at the minimum). By instituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be\n[severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data [CPG 2.R]. ACSC recommends](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/CISA_CPG_REPORT_v1.0.1_FINAL.pdf)\norganizations follow the 3-2-1 backup strategy in which organizations have three copies of\ndata (one copy of production data and two backup copies) on two different media, such as\ndisk and tape, with one copy kept off-site for disaster recovery.\n\n     - **Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and**\ncovers the entire organization’s data infrastructure [CPG 2.K, 2.R].\n\n### Implement Mitigations for Defense-in-Depth\n\nImplementing multiple mitigations within a defense-in-depth approach can help protect against\n[ransomware, such as LockBit. CERT NZ explains How ransomware happens and how to stop it](https://www.cert.govt.nz/it-specialists/guides/how-ransomware-happens-and-how-to-stop-it/) by\napplying mitigations, or critical controls, to provide a stronger defense to detect, prevent, and respond\nto ransomware before an organization’s data is encrypted. By understanding the most common attack\nvectors, organizations can identify gaps in network defenses and implement the mitigations noted in\nthis advisory to harden organizations against ransomware attacks. In Figure 3, a ransomware attack\nis broken into three phases:\n\n     - **Initial Access where the cyber actor is looking for a way into a network.**\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\n     - **Consolidation and Preparation when the actor is attempting to gain access to all devices.**\n\n     - **Impact on Target where the actor is able to steal and encrypt data and then demand ransom.**\n\nFigure 3 shows the mitigations/critical controls, as various colored hexagons, working together to stop\na ransomware attacker from accessing a network to steal and encrypt data. In the Initial Access\nphase, mitigations working together to deny an attacker network access include securing internetexposed services, patching devices, implementing MFA, disabling macros, employing application\nallowlisting, and using logging and alerting. In the Consolidation and Preparation phase, mitigations\nworking together to keep an attacker from accessing network devices are patching devices, using\nnetwork segmentation, enforcing the principle of least privilege, implementing MFA, and using logging\nand alerting. Finally, in the Impact on Target phase, mitigations working together to deny or degrade\nan attacker’s ability to steal and/or encrypt data includes using logging and alerting, using and\nmaintaining backups, and employing application allowlisting.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\nCritical Controls Key\n\n_Figure 3: Stopping Ransomware Using Layered Mitigations_\n\n## VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS\n\nIn addition to applying mitigations, the authoring organizations recommend exercising, testing, and\nvalidating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE\nATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring organizations recommend testing\nyour existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques\ndescribed in this advisory.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Tables 5-16).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance\n\ndata.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the\n\ndata generated by this process.\n\nThe authoring organizations recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a\nproduction environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques\nidentified in this advisory.\n\n## RESOURCES\n\n     - ACSC:\n```\n        o See 2023-03: ACSC Ransomware Profile – LockBit 3.0 for additional information.\n\n```\n     - CISA:\n\n`o` [Stopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central](https://www.stopransomware.gov/)\n\nlocation for ransomware resources and alerts.\n```\n        o Information on no-cost cyber hygiene services is available at Cyber Hygiene Services\n\n```\n[and Ransomware Readiness Assessment.](https://github.com/cisagov/cset/releases/tag/v10.3.0.0)\n\n     - CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC:\n```\n        o See the #StopRansomware Guide developed through the Joint Ransomware Task\n\n```\nForce (JRTF) to provide a one-stop resource to help organizations reduce the risk of\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** International Partnership\n\nransomware incidents through best practices to detect, prevent, respond, and recover,\nincluding step-by-step approaches to address potential attacks.\n\n     - FBI and CISA:\n```\n        o See Alert AA23-075A - #StopRansomware: LockBit 3.0 for information on IOCs and\n\n```\nTTPs identified through FBI investigations as recently as March 2023.\n\n     - MS-ISAC:\n```\n        o See the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls)\n\n```\n[https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/white-papers/cis-community-defense-model-2-0for](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/white-papers/cis-community-defense-model-2-0)\ninformation on strengthening an organization’s cybersecurity posture through\nimplementing a prescriptive, prioritized, and simplified set of best.\n`o See the CIS Community Defense Model 2.0 (CDM 2.0)` [for the effectiveness of the CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls)\n\nControls [against the most prevalent types of attacks and how CDM 2.0 can be used to](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/white-papers/cis-community-defense-model-2-0)\ndesign, prioritize, implement, and improve an organization’s cybersecurity program.\n```\n        o See Blueprint for Ransomware Defense for a clear, actionable framework for\n\n```\nransomware mitigation, response, and recovery built around the CIS Controls.\n\n     - NCSC-UK\n\n`o See guidance on` [Mitigating malware and ransomware attacks](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware-and-ransomware-attacks) for information on\n\ndefending organizations against malware or ransomware attacks.\n\n     - BSI:\n\n`o See BSI’s Ransomware – Facts and Defense Strategies` for a comprehensive\n\ncollection of resources on ransomware prevention, detection, and reaction.
