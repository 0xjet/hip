Beginning in\nJanuary 2018, the military's information security department has received complaints from\nsoldiers and commanders about attempts by suspicious people on social networks\nrecommending soldiers to download apps from the official Google Play Store. Soldiers who\ndownloaded the app immediately gave Hamas access to all the information on their phone.\n\nOne of the apps used by Hamas was a dating app and the other is called “Golden Cup,”\nwhich provides real time information on this year’s World Cup.\n\nOne of the apps used by Hamas.Credit: IDF Spokesperson's Unit\n\n[Intel Officer: Israeli Soldiers May Still Be Under Hamas Surveillance](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2018-07-03/ty-article/intel-officer-israeli-soldiers-may-still-be-under-hamas-surveillance/0000017f-da76-d938-a17f-fe7ea5860000)\n[Israeli Army Combating a New Kind of Cyber Threat](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2017-10-06/ty-article/israeli-army-combating-a-new-kind-of-cyber-threat/0000017f-e48a-d38f-a57f-e6daef480000)\n[Twitter Blocks Hamas, Hezbollah Accounts Following Israeli Pressure](https://www.haaretz.com/2018-07-03/ty-article/twitter-blocks-hamas-hezbollah-accounts-in-israel-under-pressure/0000017f-db29-db22-a17f-ffb9e2d50000)\n\nThe military began examining these apps and swiftly discovered that Hamas was behind\nthem, and that it was operating fake Facebook profiles to build trust with soldiers since 2017\nto get the soldiers to download the apps.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe operation by the unit responsible for information security was dubbed operation broken\nheart.\"\n\nHamas also used a fitness app to identify the phone numbers of soldiers who went jogging\nnear the Gaza border. The minute Hamas had these numbers, it began sending the soldiers,\nand others, requests to download their \"Trojan Horse\" apps.\n\nEven though the damage was discovered relatively quickly, only a few weeks after the\nmilitants started to hack into the soldiers' phones, Hamas still succeeded in gathering\ninformation on a number of Israeli bases and the armored vehicles on those bases.\n\nIn recent years, [Hamas has been making great efforts in the area of cyber hacking and](https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/hamas-1.5598922)\ninformation gathering and in attempting to acquire information from Israeli soldiers, sources\nin the cyber security sector say.\n\nYehiyeh Sinwar, the Hamas militant group's leader in the Gaza Strip, speaks to foreign\ncorrespondents, in his office in Gaza City, Thursday, May 10, 2018Credit: Khalil Hamra/AP\n\nThe latest attacks on smartphones, using the official apps on the Google Play Store, social\nmedia profiles testifies to Hamas’ ability to improve its tactics. Some in the industry describe\nHamas as the most developed non-state organization in cyber security.\n\n“Today, for a few tens of thousands of dollars, it is possible to get hackers from Eastern\nEuropean and Asian countries who can carry out cyber attacks on a very high level,” says\nNitzan Ziv, vice president for cyber security at Check Point. “An organization that wants to\nattack Israel and has the relevant information on soldiers can do so independently and can\nturn to people in those same countries. We know how to say with certainty today that this is\nsomething that happens,” Ziv added.\n\n## Click the alert icon to follow topics:\n\n[Gaza](https://www.haaretz.com/ty-tag/gaza-0000017f-da27-d718-a5ff-faa74c9e0000)\n[IDF](https://www.haaretz.com/ty-tag/idf-0000017f-da26-dea8-a77f-de663c140000)\n[Hamas](https://www.haaretz.com/ty-tag/hamas-0000017f-da26-d938-a17f-fe2e53320000)\n\n\n-----",
