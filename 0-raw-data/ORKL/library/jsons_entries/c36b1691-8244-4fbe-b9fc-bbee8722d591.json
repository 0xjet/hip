Multiple attack\ncampaigns have been [reported by number of security organizations in the last couple of](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/oceanlotus-new-watering-hole-attack-southeast-asia/)\nyears, [documenting the tools and tactics used by the threat actor. While OceanLotus’](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-cobalt-kitty-apt)\ntargets are global, their operations are mostly active within the APAC region which\nencompasses targeting private sectors across multiple industries, foreign governments,\nactivists, and dissidents connected to Vietnam.\n\nThis blog will cover a new custom downloader malware family we’ve named\n“KerrDown” which OceanLotus have been actively using since at least early 2018. We\nalso show how the [jaccard-index algorithm was used to quickly find similarities between](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)\nthe new KerrDown malware family within our datasets. This method has proven to be very\nuseful to extract similarities from large sample datasets and connecting attack\ncampaigns together. Given the large number of “KerrDown” samples found, we were also\nable to discern possible patterns in OceanLotus’ working hours and days of a week which\nis discussed in the later sections of this blog.\n\nWe identified two methods to deliver the KerrDown downloader to targets. One is using\nthe Microsoft Office Document with a malicious macro and the other\nis RAR archive which contains a legitimate program with [DLL side-loading. For RAR](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1073/)\narchive files, the file names used to trick targets are all in Vietnamese as shown in Figure\n11. Our analysis shows that the primary targets of the ongoing campaign discussed in this\nblog are either in Vietnam or Vietnamese speaking individuals.\n\n### Malicious Document\n\nOur analysis began with an active mime document, something we’ve seen OceanLotus\nuse before but this time involving a new payload, KerrDown. The lure hash is\n\n(SHA256:89e19df797481ae2d2c895bcf030fe19e581976d2aef90c89bd6b3408579bfc3)\n\nFigure 1 below shows a snapshot of the lure file. Once the victim opens the lure\ndocument, which includes an image file with a message in Vietnamese which that asks the\nvictim to enable macros to view the contents of the file. At first glance the document may\nlook like there is no other content other than the notification to enable macros.\nHowever, a closer look reveals two different base64 blobs inserted in the page in separate\ntables and the font size has been changed to 1 which may deceive victims to overlook the\ncontent. Another reason for this technique may be that many automated tools are able to\ndetect the presence of an embedded binary within the streams of such files and this\ntechnique may allow them to go undetected.\n\n## Delivery Document Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Lure document_\n\nOnce we increase the font size, the base64 blobs are visible in two different tables. Once\ndecoded you can see the MZ header of the PE DLL at the beginning of each table, as\nshown in Figure 2.\n\n_Figure 2: Base64 encoded pedll files embedded as text in the document._\n\nFigure 3 shows a code excerpt from the embedded macro that checks which base64 blob\nshould be decoded based on the iCheck variable, a Boolean value which is set to true if\nth i ti t i i 64 bit t d f l 32 bit t If th t\n\n\n-----\n\ndecoded otherwise the base64 encoded blob on the right is decoded.\n\n_Figure 3: Base64 blob selection based on system check_\n\nWe also noticed that the actors reused the VBS decode function published by [Motobit.](https://www.motobit.com/tips/detpg_Base64/)\nFigure 4 shows the comparison between the base64 function used in the macro code and\nthe VBS base64 decoder function published by Motobit.\n\n_Figure 4: Base64 decoder comparison_\n\n## Similarity Analysis of KerrDown Samples using Jaccard-Index\n\nOnce we decoded and extracted both DLL files from the document we used a similarity\nanalysis algorithm using the [Jaccard index to check the binaries against known set of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)\nmalware families used by OceanLotus which yielded no matches with any\n\ni O L t l f ili H bl t fi d lti l th\n\n\n-----\n\naccompanying C2 domains. Given the high number of samples found,\nwe again used a similarity analysis algorithm using [Jaccard Index to extract similarities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)\nbetween all the samples found. At this stage we were not sure if the DLL files were a\nbackdoor or had any other functionality. Hence, we included a few\nother known OceanLotus malware family samples used no earlier than 2017 to our\nsimilarity test, and in most cases samples which were final payloads dropped in victim\nmachines. One of the main objectives was to quickly discern if KerrDown could have\nbeen variants of the known malware families we have been tracking or\nwas OceanLotus employing a new malware family in their playbooks and in the recent\ncampaigns. Plotting the Jaccard index results using [networkx we can quickly visualize the](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/)\nsimilarities extracted. As you can see from Figure 5, there is a thick cluster of samples at\nthe top right of the networkx graph which did not have any similarities with the other\nknown OceanLotus malware family samples. Therefore, this observation was helpful for us\nto understand that the samples we were looking into were likely a new malware family\nbeing employed by the OceanLotus group at the time of analysis, which we have now\nnamed KerrDown.\n\n_Figure 5: Similarity analysis using Jaccard Index_\n\n## KerrDown to Cobalt Strike Beacon\n\n\n-----\n\neither of the embedded KerrDown DLLs will be dropped in the victim machine. The DLL is\ndropped in the directory location ‘Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\’ as\n‘main_background.png’. The DLL retrieves the payload from the URL, decrypts it by using\nDES algorithm and execute it in the memory. Therefore, it is observed that only\nthe KerrDown DLL downloader is saved in the system and the payload directly gets\nexecuted in the memory without being written in the system. Table 1 shows the URL the\ndownloader will attempt to download the payload from depending on the OS architecture\nof the victim machine.\n\n\n**OS Architec‐**\n**ture**\n\n\n**URL** **User Agent**\n\n\n32 bit https://syn.servebbs[.]com/kuss32.gif Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win32;\nx32; rv:60.0)\n\n64 bit https://syn.servebbs[.]com/kuss64.gif Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64;\nx64; rv:60.0)\n\n_Table 1 : Payload DLL selection based on architecture_\n\nThe link to the final payload of KerrDown was still active during the time of analysis and\nhence we were able to download a copy which turned out to be a variant of\nCobalt Strike Beacon. Cybereason also [published previously on OceanLotus using](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-cobalt-kitty-apt)\nCobalt Strike in their campaigns and it is interesting to see the use of a new downloader\nmalware family being used to still deliver the final payload of Cobalt Strike. As we can see\nin this case, the purpose of the malware is to download and execute the Cobalt Strike\nBeacon payload in memory. Though Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing\ntool, [various threat actors are known to have used it in their campaigns.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-threat-actor-group-darkhydrus-targets-middle-east-government/)\n\n## RAR Archives with KerrDown\n\nWhile investigating KerrDown we found multiple RAR files containing a variant of\nthe malware. We haven’t yet identified the delivery method or targets of this variant. The\nattacker changed the downloader code by adding more stages and hiding each stage by\ncompression and encryption. They also changed the way to execute the malicious code\nfrom an Office macro to the DLL side-loading technique through a legitimate program.\n\nThe RAR archive\n\n(SHA256:040abac56542a2e0f384adf37c8f95b2b6e6ce3a0ff969e3c1d572e6b4053ff3)\n\nhas the Vietnamese file name ‘Don khieu nai.rar’ which translates to ‘Complaint letter’ in\nEnglish. The archive contains a legitimate older version of Microsoft Word (Microsoft Word\n2007) executable file that is named ‘Noi dung\nchi tiet don khieu nai gui cong ty.exe’ which translates to ‘Learn more about how to use\nyour company’ in English. The attacker used the DLL side loading technique to load a\nmalicious DLL by the older version of Microsoft Word. When opening the executable file in\nthe archive, it loads the malicious DLL in the same directory. The DLL executes multistage shellcodes and each shellcode employs various technique to hide the next\nstage. The overall installation steps are below:\n\n\n-----\n\nfunction of the DLL.\n2. The DLL decodes base64 encoded shellcode in the body and executes it.\n3. The shellcode decompresses the second shellcode which is compressed with the\n\nopen source compression code UCL and execute it.\n4. The second shellcode decrypts the third shellcode with AES.\n5. The third shellcode retrieves the shellcode from the following remote location and\n\nexecutes it: https://cortanasyn[.]com/Avcv\n6. The fourth shellcode loads the embedded Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL in memory and\n\nexecutes it.\n\n_Figure 6: Execution flow of sideloaded malicious downloader_\n\nLooking at the compile timestamps of all the KerrDown samples in our datasets we were\nable to discern a couple of observations:\n\nOceanLotus has been using the new downloader in their campaigns since at least\nMarch 2018 and continues to actively use it in their campaigns. Figure 7 shows the\ntimeline of the KerrDown samples:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Downloader DLL compile time lines_\n\nWhile it is already widely believed that the OceanLotus group may originate from\nVietnam, we wanted to find possible working hour patterns from the samples in our\ndatasets. We plotted the compile times based on GMT +7 and found a clear pattern\nof the possible working hours of the group. The OceanLotus group has a typical 9\nAM to 6 PM working pattern with most samples compiled during this period of the\nday. Figure 8 shows the malware compilation timestamps in GMT +7 for each\nunique sample found in our dataset.\n\n_Figure 8: Malware compilation times in GMT +7_\n\nWe also observed all the samples were compiled during the weekdays – between\nMonday to Friday. Therefore, it is clear that the OceanLotus group works during\n\n\n-----\n\ncompiled during the week.\n\n_Figure 9: Malware compilation during weekdays_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOceanLotus has been an active threat actor group for a number of years and remains one\nof the most sophisticated threat actors in the APAC region. As we have seen with the\nnew KerrDown downloader being used in their recent campaigns, the group continues to\nbuild and employ new tools and techniques in their overall operations and playbooks. It is\ntherefore imperative to understand and keep a track of the group’s ongoing operations and\ncapability to better defend against such threats. Given the high number of samples\nobserved, we were also able to discern possible working hour patterns which shows us\nthat the group likely has formal working hours and operating out of a region which is like\nVietnam or nearby countries. While most of the targeting observed is towards Vietnamese\nspeaking victims, given the known broader geographic and industry wide target base\nof OceanLotus, the group may use similar tools and playbooks against other targets.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are already protected via:\n\n## Indicators of Compromise:\n\n### Lure
