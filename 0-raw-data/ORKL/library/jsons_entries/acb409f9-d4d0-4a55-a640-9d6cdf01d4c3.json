This activity\ncluster, tracked by CrowdStrike as DiplomaticOrbiter, has been observed using a delivery\nchain involving lure documents and a sophisticated loading mechanism for payloads.\n\nBased on the targeting profile, CrowdStrike Intelligence currently attributes this recent\nactivity to [COZY BEAR, an advanced threat actor acting on behalf of the Foreign](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/adversary/cozy-bear/)\nIntelligence Service of the Russian Federation, also known as SVR. The malware observed\n\n\n-----\n\nas part of this activity is also referred to as EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone and\nVaporRage by the security industry.\n\nAccording to CrowdStrike’s analysis, the DiplomaticOrbiter activity cluster has been in\noperation since at least October 2020 and is currently conducting active campaigns focused\non sensitive government organizations and Western think tanks. The campaign uses a\n[distinctive delivery chain, employing spear-phishing emails, HTML lure documents and a](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/phishing/spear-phishing/)\nmultistep loading chain for Cobalt Strike Beacon.\n\nThis adversary’s capabilities are considered to be designed around flexibility and stealth,\nenabling them to communicate via legitimate channels, conduct advanced victim\nenvironment assessment and deploy additional payloads while covering forensic artifacts\nused in investigations. We continuously track the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)\nassociated with this activity cluster, constantly updating the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform\nto protect customers against similar attacks.\n\n## How Does CrowdStrike Falcon Protect Customers?\n\nThe [Falcon platform can identify the current tooling associated with the campaign — it](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)\ncontinuously monitors TTPs associated with over 160 identified threat actors and numerous\nunnamed groups, and derives and incorporates intelligence to protect customers and their\ncritical systems.\n\nAs soon as the Falcon sensor identifies processes associated with the currently employed\ntooling, it stops an attack before it can expand. The example below demonstrates how\nFalcon detects the COZY BEAR run key and interrupts the attack chain by blocking its\nexecution.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\n\n-----\n\n[This video also demonstrates how CrowdStrike Falcon can successfully detect and block](https://crowdstrike.wistia.com/medias/x0tzjsjtpx)\nthe tools associated with the recent COZY BEAR campaign.\n\nThrough a single lightweight agent, Falcon integrates machine learning and behavioral\n[detection to detect and block malware, tools and activities operated by sophisticated](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/malware/)\nadversaries. Coupled with the power and scale of the cloud to analyze large-scale threat\ntelemetry and derive actionable intelligence, the Falcon platform can immediately detect\nand block behavior and tactics associated with sophisticated adversaries.\n\nProtecting our customers from sophisticated adversaries is something the Falcon platform\ndoes every day. The Falcon platform accurately identifies and blocks sophisticated\n[adversaries and threats. Coupled with CrowdStrike’s “1-10-60 rule” — detect a threat within](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/crowdcasts/the-1-10-60-minute-challenge-a-framework-for-stopping-breaches-faster/)\nthe first minute of intrusion, investigate and understand the threat within the first 10 minutes,\nand contain and eradicate the threat within 60 minutes — as a benchmark for swiftly\ndefeating adversaries, Falcon helps organizations secure their operations and stop\nbreaches.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Learn more about COZY BEAR in the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe.](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/adversary/cozy-bear/)_\n_[Download the CrowdStrike 2021 Global Threat Report for more information about](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-threat-report/)_\n_adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence in 2020._\n_[See how the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform protects customers](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/)_\n_from DarkSide ransomware in this blog: DarkSide Goes Dark: How CrowdStrike_\n_Falcon Customers Were Protected._\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ and learn how true next-](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n-----\n\nCompromised Docker Honeypots Used for Pro-Ukrainian DoS Attack\n\n\n-----\n\nNavigating the Five Stages of Grief During a Breach\n\nLemonDuck Targets Docker for Cryptomining Operations\n\n\n-----",
