The attackers aimed to deploy malicious downloaders for Windows and macOS to compromise website visitors\nwith MgBot and a backdoor that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been publicly documented yet; we have named it Nightdoor.\n\n**Key points in this blogpost:**\n\nWe discovered a cyberespionage campaign that leverages the Monlam Festival – a religious gathering – to target Tibetans in\nseveral countries and territories.\nThe attackers compromised the website of the organizer of the annual festival, which takes place in India, and added malicious\ncode to create a watering-hole attack targeting users connecting from specific networks.\nWe also discovered that a software developer’s supply chain was compromised and trojanized installers for Windows and macOS\nwere served to users.\nThe attackers fielded a number of malicious downloaders and full-featured backdoors for the operation, including a publicly\nundocumented backdoor for Windows that we have named Nightdoor.\nWe attribute this campaign with high confidence to the China-aligned Evasive Panda APT group.\n\n## Evasive Panda profile\n\n[Evasive Panda (also known as BRONZE HIGHLAND and Daggerfly) is a Chinese-speaking APT group, active since at least 2012. ESET](https://vb2020.vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-43.pdf)\nResearch has observed the group conducting cyberespionage against individuals in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Nigeria.\nGovernment entities were targeted in Southeast and East Asia, specifically China, Macao, Myanmar, The Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\nOther organizations in China and Hong Kong were also targeted. According to public reports, the group has also targeted unknown entities in\nHong Kong, India, and Malaysia.\n\nThe group uses its own custom malware framework with a modular architecture that allows its backdoor, known as MgBot, to receive modules\nto spy on its victims and enhance its capabilities. Since 2020 we have also observed that Evasive Panda has capabilities to deliver its\n[backdoors via adversary-in-the-middle attacks hijacking updates of legitimate software.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/04/26/evasive-panda-apt-group-malware-updates-popular-chinese-software/)\n\n## Campaign overview\n\nIn January 2024, we discovered a cyberespionage operation in which attackers compromised at least three websites to carry out watering-hole\nattacks as well as a supply-chain compromise of a Tibetan software company.\n\nThe compromised website abused as a watering hole belongs to Kagyu International Monlam Trust, an organization based in India that\npromotes Tibetan Buddhism internationally. The attackers placed a script in the website that verifies the IP address of the potential victim and if\nit is within one of the targeted ranges of addresses, shows a fake error page to entice the user to download a “fix” named certificate (with a\n.exe extension if the visitor is using Windows or .pkg if macOS). This file is a malicious downloader that deploys the next stage in the\ncompromise chain.\n\nBased on the IP address ranges the code checks for, we discovered that the attackers targeted users in India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia,\nand the United States; the attack might have aimed to capitalize on international interest in the Kagyu Monlam Festival (Figure 1) that is held\nannually in January in the city of Bodhgaya, India.\n\n_Figure 1. Kagyu Monlam’s website with the dates of the festival_\n\nInterestingly, the network of the Georgia Institute of Technology (also known as Georgia Tech) in the United States is among the identified\n[entities in the targeted IP address ranges. In the past,the university was mentioned in connection with the Chinese Communist Party’s](https://www.globalatlanta.com/pompeo-warns-of-chinese-influence-on-u-s-campuses-in-georgia-tech-speech/)\ninfluence on education institutes in the US.\n\nAround September 2023, the attackers compromised the website of a software development company based in India that produces Tibetan\nlanguage translation software. The attackers placed several trojanized applications there that deploy a malicious downloader for Windows or\nmacOS.\n\nIn addition to this, the attackers also abused the same website and a Tibetan news website called Tibetpost – tibetpost[.]net – to host the\npayloads obtained by the malicious downloads, including two full-featured backdoors for Windows and an unknown number of payloads for\nmacOS.\n\n_Figure 2. Timeline of events related to the attack_\n\nWith high confidence we attribute this campaign to the Evasive Panda APT group, based on the malware that was used: MgBot and Nightdoor.\nIn the past, we have seen both backdoors deployed together, in an unrelated attack against a religious organization in Taiwan, in which they\nalso shared the same C&C server. Both points also apply to the campaign described in this blogpost.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Watering hole\n\nOn January 14, 2024, we detected a suspicious script at https://www.kagyumonlam[.]org/media/vendor/jquery/js/jquery.js?3.6.3.th\n\n[Malicious obfuscated code was appended to a legitimate jQuery JavaScript library script, as seen in Figure 2.](https://jquery.com/)\n\n_Figure 3. The malicious code added at the end of a jQuery library_\n\nThe script sends an HTTP request to the localhost address http://localhost:63403/?callback=handleCallback to check whether the attacker’s\nintermediate downloader is already running on the potential victim machine (see Figure 3). On a previously compromised machine, the implant\nreplies with handleCallback({\"success\":true }) (see Figure 4) and no further actions are taken by the script.\n\n_Figure 4. The JavaScript code that checks in with the implant_\n\n_Figure 5. The implant answering the JavaScript check-in request_\n\nIf the machine does not reply with the expected data, the malicious code continues by obtaining an MD5 hash from a secondary server at\nhttps://update.devicebug[.]com/getVersion.php. Then the hash is checked against a list of 74 hash values, as seen in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6. An array of hashes stored in the malicious JavaScript_\n\nIf there is a match, the script will render an HTML page with a fake crash notification (Figure 7) intended to bait the visiting user into\n[downloading a solution to fix the problem. The page mimics typical “Aw, Snap!” warnings from Google Chrome.](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95669?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid)\n\n_Figure 7. A fake graphic rendered by the JavaScript_\n\nThe “Immediate Fix” button triggers a script that downloads a payload based on the user’s operating system (Figure 8).\n\n_Figure 8. Download URLs for Windows and macOS_\n\n### Breaking the hash\n\nThe condition for payload delivery requires getting the correct hash from the server at update.devicebug[.]com, so the 74 hashes are the key\nto the attacker’s victim selection mechanism. However, since the hash is computed on the server side, it posed a challenge for us to know\nwhat data is used to compute it.\n\nWe experimented with different IP addresses and system configurations and narrowed down the input for the MD5 algorithm to a formula of\nthe first three octets of the user’s IP address. In other words, by inputting IP addresses sharing the same network prefix, for example\n192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.50, will receive the same MD5 hash from the C&C server.\n\n[However, an unknown combination of characters, or a salt, is included with the string of first three IP octets before hashing to prevent the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography))\nhashes from being trivially brute-forced. Therefore, we needed to brute-force the salt to secure the input formula and only then generate\nhashes using the entire range of IPv4 addresses to find the matching 74 hashes.\n\nSometimes the stars do align, and we figured out that the salt was 1qaz0okm!@#. With all pieces of the MD5 input formula (for example,\n192.168.1.1qaz0okm!@#), we brute-forced the 74 hashes with ease and generated a list of targets. See the Appendix for a complete list.\n\nAs shown in Figure 9, the majority of targeted IP address ranges are in India, followed by Taiwan, Australia, the United States, and Hong Kong.\n[Note that most of the Tibetan diaspora lives in India.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_diaspora)\n\n_Figure 9. Geolocation of targeted IP address ranges_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Windows payload\n\nOn Windows, victims of the attack are served with a malicious executable located at https://update.devicebug[.]com/fixTools/certificate.exe.\nFigure 10 shows the execution chain that follows when the user downloads and executes the malicious fix.\n\n_Figure 10. Loading chain of certificate.exe_\n\ncertificate.exe is a dropper that deploys a side-loading chain to load an intermediate downloader, memmgrset.dll (internally named http_dy.dll).\nThis DLL fetches a JSON file from the C&C server at https://update.devicebug[.]com/assets_files/config.json, which contains the information to\ndownload the next stage (see Figure 11).\n\n_Figure 11. Content of config.json_\n\nWhen the next stage is downloaded and executed, it deploys another side-loading chain to deliver Nightdoor as the final payload. An analysis\nof Nightdoor is provided below in the Nightdoor section.\n\n### macOS payload\n\nThe macOS malware is the same downloader that we document in more detail in Supply-chain compromise. However, this one drops an\nadditional Mach-O executable, which listens on TCP port 63403. Its only purpose is to reply with handleCallback({\"success\":true }) to the\nmalicious JavaScript code request, so if the user visits the watering-hole website again, the JavaScript code will not attempt to re-compromise\nthe visitor.\n\nThis downloader obtains the JSON file from the server and downloads the next stage, just like the Windows version previously described.\n\n## Supply-chain compromise\n\nOn January 18, we discovered that the official website (Figure 12) of a Tibetan language translation software product for multiple platformsth\nwas hosting ZIP packages containing trojanized installers for legitimate software that deployed malicious downloaders for Windows and\nmacOS.\n\n_Figure 12. Windows and macOS applications are backdoored versions, hosted on the legitimate website’s_\n\n_download page_\n\nWe found one victim from Japan who downloaded one of the packages for Windows. Table 1 lists the URLs and the dropped implants.\n\n_Table 1.

Loading chain of the malicious components_\n\nThe trojanized application contains a malicious dropper called autorun.exe that deploys two components:\n\n[an executable file named MonlamUpdate.exe, which is a software component from an emulator called C64 Forever and is abused for](https://www.c64forever.com/)\nDLL side-loading, and\nRPHost.dll, the side-loaded DLL, which is a malicious downloader for the next stage.\n\nWhen the downloader DLL is loaded in memory, it creates a scheduled task named Demovale intended to be executed every time a user logs\non. However, since the task does not specify a file to execute, it fails to establish persistence.\n\n|Malicious package URL|Payload type|\n|---|---|\n|https://www.monlamit[.]com/monlam-app-store/monlam-bodyig3.zip|Win32 downloader|\n|https://www.monlamit[.]com/monlam-app-store/Monlam_Grand_Tibetan_Dictionary_2018.zip|Win32 downloader|\n|https://www.monlamit[.]com/monlam-app-store/Deutsch-Tibetisches_W%C3%B6rterbuch_Installer_Windows.zip|Win32 downloader|\n|https://www.monlamit[.]com/monlam-app-store/monlam-bodyig-mac-os.zip|macOS downloader|\n|https://www.monlamit[.]com/monlam-app-store/Monlam-Grand-Tibetan-Dictionary-for-mac-OS-X.zip|macOS downloader|\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, this DLL gets a UUID and the operating system version to create a custom User-Agent and sends a GET request to\nhttps://www.monlamit[.]com/sites/default/files/softwares/updateFiles/Monlam_Grand_Tibetan_Dictionary_2018/UpdateInfo.dat to obtain a\nJSON file containing the URL to download and execute a payload that it drops to the %TEMP% directory. We were unable to obtain a sample\nof the JSON object data from the compromised website; therefore we don’t know from where exactly default_ico.exe is downloaded, as\nillustrated in Figure 13.\n\nVia ESET telemetry, we noticed that the illegitimate MonlamUpdate.exe process downloaded and executed on different occasions at least four\nmalicious files to %TEMP%\\default_ico.exe. Table 2 lists those files and their purpose.\n\n_Table 2.

The post-installation script copies the Mach-O file to $HOME/Library/Containers/CalendarFocusEXT/ and\nproceeds to install a Launch Agent in $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.Terminal.us.plist for persistence. Figure 14 shows the script\nresponsible for installing and launching the malicious Launch Agent.\n\n_Figure 14. Post-installation script for installing and launching the malicious Launch Agent_\n\nThe malicious Mach-O, Monlam-bodyig_Keyboard_2017 in Figure 13 is signed, but not notarized, using a developer certificate (not a\n[certificate type usually used for distribution) with the name and team identifier ya ni yang (2289F6V4BN). The timestamp in the signature](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/reference/certificate-types)\nshows that it was signed January 7, 2024. This date is also used in the modified timestamp of the malicious files in the metadata of the ZIPth\narchive. The certificate was issued only three days before. The full certificate is available in the IoCs section. Our team reached out to Apple\non January 25 and the certificate was revoked the same day.th\n\n|SHA-1|Contacted URL|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|1C7DF9B0023FB97000B7 1C7917556036A48657C5|https://tibetpost[.]net/templates/ protostar/html/layouts/joomla/ system/default_fields.php|Downloads an unknown payload from the server.|\n|F0F8F60429E3316C463F 397E8E29E1CB2D925FC2||Downloads an unknown payload from the server.

The architecture (ARM or Intel), macOS version, and\nhardware UUID (an identifier unique to each Mac) are reported in the User-Agent HTTP request header. The same URL as the Windows\nversion is used to retrieve that configuration:\nhttps://www.monlamit[.]com/sites/default/files/softwares/updateFiles/Monlam_Grand_Tibetan_Dictionary_2018/UpdateInfo.dat. However, the\nmacOS version will look at the data under the mac key of the JSON object instead of the win key.\n\nThe object under the mac key should contain the following:\n\nurl: The URL to the next stage.\nmd5: MD5 sum of the payload.\nvernow: A list of hardware UUIDs. If present, the payload will only be installed on Macs that have one of the listed hardware UUIDs. This\ncheck is skipped if the list is empty or missing.\nversion: A numerical value that must be higher than the previously downloaded second stage “version”. The payload is not downloaded\n[otherwise. The value of the currently running version is kept in the application user defaults.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults?language=objc%20%22NSUserDefaults%20documentation)\n\nAfter the malware downloads the file from the specified URL using curl, the file is hashed using MD5 and compared to the hexadecimal digest\nunder the md5 key. If it matches, its extended attributes are removed (to clear the com.apple.quarantine attribute), the file is moved to\n[$HOME/Library/SafariBrowser/Safari app/Contents/MacOS/SafariBrower and is launched using execvp with the argument run](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/execvp.3.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike the Windows version, we could not find any of the later stages of the macOS variant. One JSON configuration contained an MD5 hash\n(3C5739C25A9B85E82E0969EE94062F40), but the URL field was empty.\n\n## Nightdoor\n\nThe backdoor that we have named Nightdoor (and is named NetMM by the malware authors according to PDB paths) is a late addition to\nEvasive Panda’s toolset. Our earliest knowledge of Nightdoor goes back to 2020, when Evasive Panda deployed it onto a machine of a highprofile target in Vietnam. The backdoor communicates with its C&C server via UDP or the Google Drive API. The Nightdoor implant from this\n[campaign used the latter. It encrypts a Google API OAuth 2.0 token within the data section and uses the token to access the attacker’s Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\nDrive. We have requested that the Google account associated with this token be taken down.\n\nFirst, Nightdoor creates a folder in Google Drive containing the victim’s MAC address, which also acts as a victim ID. This folder will contain all\nthe messages between the implant and the C&C server. Each message between Nightdoor and the C&C server is structured as a file and\nseparated into filename and file data, as depicted in Figure 15.\n\n_Figure 15. The conversation messages between the implant and the C&C from the victim’s folder in the_\n\n_attacker’s Google Drive_\n\nEach filename contains eight main attributes, which is demonstrated in the example below.\n\nExample:\n\n1_2_0C64C2BAEF534C8E9058797BCD783DE5_168_0_1_4116_0_00-00-00-00-00-00\n\n1_2: magic value.\n[0C64C2BAEF534C8E9058797BCD783DE5: header of pbuf data structure.](https://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_0_x/group__pbuf.html)\n168: size of the message object or file size in bytes.\n0: filename, which is always the default of 0 (null).\n1: command type, hardcoded to 1 or 0 depending on the sample.\n4116: command ID.\n0: quality of service (QoS).\n00-00-00-00-00-00: meant to be MAC address of the destination but always defaults to 00-00-00-00-00-00.\n\nThe data inside each file represents the controller’s command for the backdoor and the necessary parameters to execute it. Figure 16 shows\nan example of a C&C server message stored as file data.\n\n_Figure 16. Message from the C&C server_\n\nBy reverse engineering Nightdoor, we were able to understand the meaning of the important fields presented in the file, as shown in Figure 17.\n\nFigure 17. Nightdoor command file format\n\nWe found that many meaningful changes were added to the Nightdoor version used in this campaign, one of them being the organization of\ncommand IDs. In previous versions, each command ID was assigned to a handler function one by one, as shown in Figure 18. The numbering\nchoices, such as from 0x2001 to 0x2006, from 0x2201 to 0x2203, from 0x4001 to 0x4003, and from 0x7001 to 0x7005, suggested that\ncommands were divided into groups with similar functionalities.\n\n_Figure 18. Nightdoor’s old method of assigning command IDs to handling functions_\n\nHowever, in this version, Nightdoor uses a branch table to organize all the command IDs with their corresponding handlers. The command IDs\nare continuous throughout and act as indexes to their corresponding handlers in the branch table, as shown in Figure 19.\n\n_Figure 19. Nightdoor’s switch statement and the branch table_\n\nTable 3 is a preview of the C&C server commands and their functionalities. This table contains the new command IDs as well as the equivalent\nIDs from older versions.\n\n_Table 3.

We believe\nthat the attackers capitalized, at the time, on the upcoming Monlam festival in January and February of 2024 to compromise users when they\nvisited the festival’s website-turned-watering-hole. In addition, the attackers compromised the supply chain of a software developer of Tibetan\nlanguage translation apps.\n\nThe attackers fielded several downloaders, droppers, and backdoors, including MgBot – which is used exclusively by Evasive Panda – and\nNightdoor: the latest major addition to the group’s toolkit and which has been used to target several networks in East Asia.\n\n[A comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and samples can be found in our GitHub repository.](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/evasive_panda)\n\n[For any inquiries about our research published on WeLiveSecurity, please contact us at threatintel@eset.com.](mailto:threatintel@eset.com?utm_source=welivesecurity.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=autotagging&utm_content=eset-research&utm_term=en)\n[ESET Research offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.
