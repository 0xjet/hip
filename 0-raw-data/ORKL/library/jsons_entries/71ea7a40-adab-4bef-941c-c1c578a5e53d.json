He holds a B.S. from the U.S.\nMilitary Academy and an M.A. from the\nUniversity of Southern California.\n\n\n—Early Bird, 14 December 2007\n\nince 2005, Chinese cyber attacks against U.S. systems have increased\nat an alarming rate. However, the term “attack” carries unwanted\n\n# S\n\nconnotations; these unwarranted incursions are more likely reconnaissance\nmissions to collect intelligence on U.S. military systems, to spot vulnerabilities or plant trap-doors or viruses in our systems, and to ensure that\nChina’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has an immediate advantage in the\nevent of war involving America and China. If the incursions were “attacks,”\nthen our systems would be down and destroyed. Instead, these computer\nreconnaissance measures appear to conform to an old Chinese stratagem: “a\nvictorious army first wins and then seeks battle. A defeated army first battles\nand then seeks victory.” Reconnaissance via computer to spot vulnerabilities\nbefore the first battle fits the stratagem well.\n\nThe United States, of course, is not the only country accusing the Chinese of unwarranted incursions. Germany, England, France, Japan, Taiwan,\nAustralia, and others have also been Chinese targets. When one views these\nevents in the light of open-source accounts of Chinese information operations (IO) theory over the past several years, there is much circumstantial\nevidence to find China guilty as accused. The only actual forensic evidence,\nof course, is classified and located in the security agencies of the countries\nthat China has electronically invaded.\n\nThis article explains Chinese military thought that supports their cyberattack activities. While other articles focus on who was attacked and how many\ntimes, this article focuses more on the theory behind the attacks, especially the\nPLA’s use of electronic stratagems for their computer network operations and\nthe use of surrogates such as patriotic hacker groups. The article reviews Chinese incursions since 2005 and examines open-source assessments provided\nby some of the most important Chinese information warfare theorists.\n\nThe PLA has followed theory with practice. Computer network operations\nhave become part of the peacetime strategic activities of the PLA. More\nworrisome is the purpose of these incursions. Is it reconnaissance?

The cause of China’s attachment to new information technologies and\nthe “informatization” of their force is the dramatic\nimpact the technologies have had on military affairs,\nmost notably the U.S. use of technology in Iraq. The\neffect of these technologies on Chinese military\nthought is the Chinese belief that only countries that\ntake the initiative in an information war or establish\ninformation superiority and control ahead of time\nwill win, and that this requires reconnaissance and\nintelligence gathering before the first battle to set\nthe stage for the use of cyber forces.\n\nHistorically, the PLA based its strategic philosophy on “active defense,” meaning that China\nwould never attack someone first but would be\nready to respond if attacked. That philosophy has\nchanged over the past few years with the advent of\nthe cyber age. There has been a continuous stream\nof open-source descriptions of both cyber units\nin and offensive cyber operations by the Chinese\nmilitary. The PLA’s open recognition of a need for\noffensive operations reflects a significant break\nwith traditional military thought. Further, the PLA\nhas openly stated that U.S. reliance on computer\nsystems is a huge vulnerability ripe for exploitation. If the PLA hopes to offset America’s huge\nadvantage in practical application of IO theory (in\nKosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan), it has to exploit\nthat vulnerability. To understand this shift from\n\n\ndefensive to offensive-minded operations, we must\nbegin by looking at developments in 1999.\n\n## 1999\n\nNearly a decade ago, Chinese IO theorists were\nalready discussing offensive actions. Zhu Wenguan\nand Chen Taiyi’s Information War, published in 1999,\ncontains a section called “Conducting Camouflaged\nPreemptive Attacks.” The authors note that preemptive\nactive offense is needed to disrupt and destroy enemy\ncomputer offensive forces.[1] A part of preemption\nappears to be network surveillance, which involves\ncollecting information on the performance, purpose,\nand structure of systems related to C4I, electronic\nwarfare, and weapon systems. The authors note that, in\nthe broadest sense, computer information surveillance\nis a part of computer information attack. They state:\n\nTo conduct computer surveillance, we can\nuse computer information networks set up\nin peacetime and enter networks as different users to do the surveillance in an area\nbroader than the battlefield. We can borrow\nthe power of computer experts, especially\nhackers, to finish computer surveillance\ntasks . . . it can be seen that using hackers to\nobtain military information from computer\nnetworks is a very effective method. We\nshould be familiar with network protocols\nand accumulate network intelligence.[2]\n\nThe authors add that the PLA established small\nbrigades of offensive and defensive computer confrontation forces to conduct these attacks.[3] Offensive\ntraining includes how to design and organize virus\ninvasions and how to enter the other side’s computer\nnetworks. Offensive brigades must repeatedly study\nand analyze the enemy’s potential. They must also be\nable to sort truth and deception, pinpoint enemy computer-control centers, and jam in targeted ways.[4]\n\nIn November 1999, a Jiefanguin Bao (Liberation\n_Army Daily) article stated that China may develop_\nan information warfare branch of service—a “net\nforce”—to complement the army, navy, and air force.\n(While the article said this development was very\nlikely to become a reality, there is no evidence to confirm the creation of such a branch of service today.)\nThe force’s task would be to protect net sovereignty\nand engage in net warfare. Elements of net warfare\ninclude “offensive and defensive” technologies,\n“scanning” technologies, “masquerade” (deception)\n\n\n## …the Chinese believe that only countries that take the\n initiative in an information war or establish information\n superiority and control  ahead of time will win…\n\n\n-----\n\ntechnology, and “recovery” technology. Masquerade\ntechnology would assist a person who wanted to dissemble as a commander and take over a net.[5]\n\n## 2000\n\nThe idea of focusing on reconnaissance and\nstratagem activities arose as early as 2000. A Jiefan_guin Bao article notes that units at and above army_\nlevel should focus their study on reconnaissance\nand early warning, command coordination, and the\napplication of strategy.[6] An article substantiating\nthis thought appeared in the PLA’s authoritative\njournal China Military Science (similar in importance to Joint Force Quarterly). The latter article\nnotes that stratagems should create opportunities\nand favorable times for releasing viruses.[7]\n\nAnother China Military Science article clarified\nthe offensive posture described in 1999. In it, General\nDai Qingmin opines that offense is at least as important as active defense, and notes, “As the key to gaining the initiative in operations lies in positively and\nactively contending with an enemy for information\nsuperiority, China should establish such a view for IO\nas ‘active offense.’” His view is that active offense\nis essential for maintaining information control,\nobtaining the initiative, and offsetting an opponent’s\nsuperiority. Offensive information methods can help\nsabotage an enemy’s information system.[8]\n\nDai, who became the head of the PLA General\nStaff’s Fourth Department (Electronic Warfare), also\nnotes that IO stratagems can be formulated before\nlaunching a war to serve as “a sharp sword” that sabotages and weakens a superior enemy, while protecting or enhancing China’s fighting capacity. Information warfare can serve as a type of invisible fighting\ncapacity to evade combat with a stronger enemy.[9] If\na future information warfare goal is to defeat strong\nforces with weak forces using stratagems, then such\nmethods are one of China’s asymmetric means to\ncombat U.S. high technology.[10] Stratagems would\nthus be one of the “magic weapons” that Chinese\nstrategic culture is always stressing.\n\nFinally, Dai’s August 2000 article in _China_\n_Military Science discusses the use of electrons as_\nstratagems and the development of an integrated\nnetwork electronic warfare capability. When combined with the active-offense concept, this article\nrepresents one of the most important information\nwarfare articles written in China.\n\n\nOther less notable publications also discuss offensive operations. In a March 2000 Internet version of\n_Computer and Information Technology, analysts at_\nthe PLA’s Electronic Engineering Institute at Hefei\ndiscuss the need for network confrontation teams\nand the requirement to conduct both defensive and\noffensive operations.[11] In September 2000, the journal Guangjiao Jing noted that the PLA had recently\nestablished information warfare departments within\nits headquarters organizations.[12] Thus, the idea of\noffensive operations was not limited just to Dai.\n\n## 2001\n\nThe 2001 book _Science of Strategy, published_\nby China’s National Defense University, includes a\nsection on offensive information warfare operations.\nIt states that strategic information warfare should\n“use offense as a main strategy but be prepared for\nboth offense and defense.” Further, it states, “We\nshould use the strategy of the preemptive strike and\nseize the initiative. Actively launching an information offensive is the key to seizing information\nsuperiority and the initiative on the battlefield.”[13]\nIn this sense, the thinking appears to apply mainly\nto wartime and not peacetime action.\n\nThe Science of Strategy also describes the type\nof war to fight against networks. The book states\nthat in a war of annihilation, nodes must be attacked\nto break up the network before attacking weapons\nsystems. Information and support systems must\nalways be the first targets to offset operational\nbalance. Science of Strategy notes, “After strikes\nto damage the net and continuous operations and\npersistent weakening of the enemy, then vigorously\nlaunch an annihilating attack.” Ground information\nwarfare facilities, transmission means, reception\nplatforms, and information-flow capabilities should\nbe destroyed in that order. This type of attack\nenables one to “take away the firewood from under\nthe cauldron.”[14] While this scenario appears to apply\nto wartime conditions, it can easily be adapted to\npeacetime conditions as well.\n\nInformation technology has thus stimulated\nChinese strategic thinking; military academics now\nargue that those who do not preempt will lose the\ninitiative in what may be a very short-lived IO war.\nIn modern conflicts, they suggest, it is easier to\nobtain the objective of war through one campaign\nor one battle than at any other time in history. This\n\n\n-----\n\nline of thinking provides further impetus for the\nPLA to conduct cyber-reconnaissance activities in\npeacetime to prepare to “win victory.”[ 15]\n\n## 2002\n\nAn article from June 2002 states that PLA units\nwere prepared to tamper “with information in terms\nof order, time, flow, content, and form; deleting\ninformation in parts, in order to create fragmented\ninformation; and inserting information to include\nirrelevant information in order to confuse and mislead each other.”[16] The author adds that two sides\nin a computer confrontation may attempt to invade\neach other’s information networks by transplanting\ncomputer viruses to downloadable software that can\nbe activated when necessary in order to sabotage\neach other’s computer systems.[17]\n\nGeneral Dai Qingmin wrote in 2002 that a priority\nfor the PLA was to acquire offensive information\noperations equipment, and that the PLA must take\nand maintain the initiative.[18] Other publications\nweighed in as well on this point.\n\n_Jiefangjun Bao, for example, carried an article_\nin August of 2002 about the forms of network\nattacks. These were listed as “premeditated” (i.e.,\na persistent computer virus embedded in software),\n“contamination” (aimed at the quality of information), “strong” (refering to the forced modulation\nof computer viruses into electromagnetic waves),\nand “fission” (the strong regeneration capability\nof a virus).[19] All are capable of being inserted in\npeacetime, except perhaps the “strong” variety.\n\n## 2003\n\nAt the 2003 10th National People’s Congress,\nPLA representatives revealed that it would activate\nthe first high-tech information warfare units in\nBeijing that year. The report stated that the units\nwould eventually be in all PLA armies. Information warfare units would be outfitted with high-tech\nequipment, and have the ability to conduct network\nwarfare on the Internet and the capability to transfer\ndata via remote sensing satellites.[20] How the “first”\ninformation warfare unit differs from the information warfare brigades under discussion in the 1999\nChinese book Information War is unknown.\n\nGeneral Dai, writing in 2003, stressed once again\nthe importance of carrying out information attacks.[21]\nDai wrote that information warfare is “precursory”\n\n\n(begins before other operations) and “whole course”\n(runs throughout an entire operation). Perhaps the\ncurrent emphases on gaining the initiative and on\nshort wars are the main reasons that Dai gives the\nimpression that preemption via information warfare\nis a necessity in future war.[22] He notes:\n\nActions such as intelligence warfare,\npsychological warfare, and campaign\ndeception in advance of combat seem to\nbe even more important to the unimpeded\nimplementation of planning and ensuring\nwar. For this reason, information warfare\nmust be started in advance of other combat\nactions before making war plans and while\nmaking war plans.[23]\n\nSpecific reserve units also engage in information\nwarfare activities. For example, in late 2003 the\nmonthly journal of the PLA Academy of Military\nScience, _Guofang, gave specific instructions on_\nnetwork attack activities to reserve units. Author\nLi Mingrang says that information storm troopers\nas “first forces” must be established from the talent\nof local communications, telecommunications, and\nfinancial departments and from scientific research\ninstitutes and institutions of higher education.\nStratagems must be developed to increase system\nsurvivability.[24] Li adds:\n\nThere is no shortage of computer experts\nand network jockeys among them, any one\nof whom could become a network guerrilla\nwho could open up a gunpowderless battlefield all by himself by harassing attacks\non the network, namely by releasing large\nvolumes of data from many directions concentrated on some enemy network station\nto jam up its network router and bring the\nnetwork station to a standstill…and once\nthere is a military requirement, either enter\nthe network system to steal intelligence or\nto activate viruses or detonate ‘bombs’ to\nachieve the combat target of destroying the\nnetwork.[25]\n\nReserve forces are directed to work on offensive\nstrategies.\n\nIn his 2003 book Deciphering Information Secu_rity, China’s “father of information warfare,” retired_\nColonel Shen Weiguang, wrote about the development of an information security university with a\nmilitary information security specialty. The specialty\n\n\n-----\n\nteaches, among some twenty-plus topics, “A Study\nof Hacker Attack Methods,” “Network Intrusion\nDetection and Defending against Attack,” “Information Attack and Defense Tactics,” “Computer\nVirus Program Design and Application,” “Network\nSecurity System Structures,” and “Scanning for\nHidden Troubles in Networks.”[26] Many of these\ntopics would fit the definition of PLA’s peacetime\ncomputer network operations incursion activities.\n\n## 2005\n\nIn the 2005 book Study Guide for Information\n_Operations Theory, General Dai and his associ-_\nates defined 400 IO-related terms, many related\nto preemptive or reconnaissance activities. Only\ncomputer network warfare is described here:\n\nComputer network warfare is composed\nof computer network reconnaissance,\ncomputer network attacks, and computer\nnetwork defense. Operations mainly involve\nthe use of armed and equipped network warriors. The means of operations include various types of viruses, logic bombs, and chip\nweapons developed from computer technology. Computer network warfare will act as\nboth a deterrent and a means of warfare,\nand it can have a large and profound impact\nupon the enemy’s politics, economics, and\nmilitary. It is also an important means of\nbattle for a less well-equipped military\nagainst one with formidable strengths in\nhigh technology.[27]\n\nDai also discussed the importance of the conduct\nof warfare, focusing on information deterrence as a\nconcept to consider and develop further at the strategic level. Others who have written on the topic of\ninformation deterrence include Shen Weiguang. The\nbook Science of Military Strategy devotes an entire\nchapter to the topic. The latter source explains how\ninformation deterrence (intimidating by demonstrating one’s information power or might) can help\nachieve national and military objectives. Deterrence\nmethods include information technology (hardware\nand software innovations), information weapons\n(discursive dissimulation or disinformation), and\ninformation-resource suppression (analogous to\njamming). According to some Chinese authors,\ncounter-information deterrence theories must also\nbe considered.\n\n\nIn Warfare Strategy Theory (2005), Yao Youzhi\nasserts that strategy has developed to the point\nwhere technological considerations dominate and\nthe use of technology has become strategic. Any\nstrategy that distances itself from focusing on hightechnology weapons has no useful value, according\nto Yao. This also means that China must develop\nsound counterstrategies.[28] He writes:\n\nIt is necessary to be proficient at utilizing\nthe information superhighway, creating\nmisleading information, spreading the fog\nof war, and jamming and destroying the\nenemy’s strategic awareness, thereby using\nstrategy to control the adversary. It is necessary to be proficient at using electronic\nfeints, electronic camouflage, electronic\njamming, virus attacks, and space satellite\njamming and deception, leading the enemy\nto draw the wrong conclusion and attaining\nthe goal of strategic deception.[29]\n\nWhile designed for wartime use, several of these\ntechniques work as peacetime preventive and preemptive measures as well.\n\nIn “stovepipe” structured commands of the past,\na force calculated its strength by adding together\nall of its parts. Today, a force’s combat strength is a\nproduct of operational elements where information\ntechnologies factor into a potentially exponential\nmultiplication.[30]\n\nYao writes that “informationized” warfare has\nchanged the traditional significance of “attack, capture, control, and defend” because precision attacks\nhave made possible the destruction of the enemy’s\nentire war system. The primary attack target has\nbecome an enemy force’s strategic information\nsystem. All activities now revolve around gaining\nbattlefield supremacy, and information supremacy\nis the foundation of battlefield supremacy. Directly\ndestroying an enemy’s will has supplanted the\nannihilation of an enemy’s military capability.\nThis focus on information invites completely new\nmethods in future wars.[31]\n\n## 2007\n\nAuthor Zhang Zhibin notes in Jiefanguin Bao, 13\nMarch 2007, that the dialectical relationship between\noffense and defense in network warfare must place\nequal emphasis on each. A network deterrence\ntheory implies that both capabilities are necessary,\n\n\n-----\n\n**A computer screen displaying a military website is**\n**seen inside an army base in Tianjin, on the outskirts of**\n**Beijing, China, 30 July 2007. Computer networks have**\n**been targeted by cyber spies that media reports say are**\n**directed by China’s military, but China denies backing**\n**such attacks.**\n\noffense to scare any potential enemy force, and\ndefense to thwart any attack. Zhang says:\n\nOnly by doing a solid job of positive defense\ncan China ensure winning the initiative in\nnetwork warfare. Thus, China should make\nunremitting efforts to seek such preemptive\nopportunities through developing network\ntechnology and systems and making corresponding network defensive operations\nresearch and implementation.[32]\nOther articles from 2007 stress a need for PLA\naction to gain network control, including access, if\npossible. Two books on Chinese IO by this author,\n_Dragon Bytes and Decoding the Virtual Dragon,_\nmention this focus on control.\n\n\n## Probable Chinese Computer Attacks against America\n\nOver the past several years, Chinese information\nwarfare and IO capabilities have become more visible and troubling. China has used these capabilities\nnot only against the U.S. but reportedly against\nJapan, Taiwan, Germany, England, and Australia\nas well. Due to the nature of computer network\noperations, exactly how many Chinese information\nwarfare reconnaissance or offensive events have\ntranspired or the actual intent of these incursions\nremains unknown. Those episodes that have leaked\ninto the public domain include the following:\n\n - Espionage conducted against the U.S. Department of Defense computers, reported in _Time_\nmagazine. The report concerned a Chinese cyber\nespionage ring that federal investigators codenamed Titan Rain.[33]\n\n - Chinese attempts to blind a U.S. satellite,\nreported in Defense News. The report discussed highpowered Chinese laser attacks on a U.S. satellite.[34]\n\n - Chinese hacker attacks on the U.S. Naval\nWar College’s net capability, reported in Federal\n_Computer Week. This attack purportedly originated_\nfrom China and took systems off-line.[35]\n\n - The Chinese destruction of an old Chinese\nweather satellite with an anti-satellite missile,\nreported on National Public Radio. The report\ncited a Beijing People’s University commentator.\nHe noted, “Satellite-killing technology is logical\nin the development of missiles and an information\nwarfare capability.”[36]\n\n - A sophisticated computer attack on Tennessee’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory in October\nand November 2007. The assault was in the form of\nphony e-mails which, when opened, allowed hackers to penetrate the lab’s computer security.[37]\n\n - Hacker attacks against Japan and Taiwan,\nreported in the Japanese and Taiwanese press.[38] The\nreports noted that these attacks were retaliations for\nJapan’s anti-Chinese interpretations of history and\nfor Taiwanese claims for independence.\n\nOn 5 September 2007, the Kansas City Star carried an article in which China denied cyber-attacking any country. Foreign ministry spokesperson Jian\nYu noted, “The Chinese government has always\nopposed an Internet-wrecking crime, including\nhacking, and cracked down on it according to the\nlaw.”[39] He dismisses accusations of Chinese attacks\n\n\n## …information supremacy is the foundation of battlefield\n supremacy.…This focus on information invites completely\n\n\n## new methods in future wars.\n\n\n-----\n\non Pentagon computers as “groundless.” A Pentagon spokesperson refused to say if the perpetrator\nwas China, but Britain’s _Financial Times quotes_\nan unidentified senior U.S. official as saying the\nsource had been traced to the PLA.\n\nA week earlier, Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine\nreported that the PLA had infiltrated Germany’s\ngovernment computer systems. The report said the\nhackers had been traced back to Guangzhou and\nLanzhou.[40] Thus, circumstantial evidence continues to grow. It is difficult to believe that Germany,\nAustralia, Japan, Taiwan, and America are all\nconniving to indict China and portray it as a new\nthreat. Indeed, through unprovoked cyber operations, China seems to have indicted itself without\nanyone’s assistance.\n\n## China’s Use of Surrogates\n\nOne of China’s stratagems is to “attack with\na borrowed sword.” Perhaps the use of patriotic\nhackers fits this stratagem. A recent article in\n_Time magazine discussed the use of a “network_\ncrack program hacker” (NCPH) group initiative to\naccomplish this goal. The article said the PLA had\ndeveloped a competition for hackers and that the\nwinner would receive a monthly stipend from the\nmilitary. It noted that the NCPH group not only won\nthe competition and received the stipend, but the\nPLA also used the NCPH to teach techniques and\nprocedures to other members of the PLA’s cyberwarfare team. A U.S. branch of VeriSign, iDefense,\nhas noted that China’s NCPH created 35 programs\nto implant Trojans (which take partial control of\ncomputers) and that these programs attacked U.S.\ngovernment agencies. VeriSign’s iDefense accused\nthe NCPH of siphoning off thousands of unclassified U.S. documents. Such activity would fit the\nPLA’s preemption focus.[41]\n\nThe concept of “people’s war” also fits with\nso-called patriotic hacking. “People’s war” in the\n\n\ncyber age means that citizens get involved with\nhacking or cyber attacking an enemy’s systems.\nPresently over 250 hacker groups operate in\nChina.[42] Quantity could thus create a quality all its\nown with the variety and intensity of incursions\nthey could conduct. None could be traced directly\nto the PLA if hacker groups are private citizens\n(or for that matter, military members or military\nreservists conducting cyber operations from their\nhome computers). Again, circumstantial evidence\nis all that one has to go on, but that evidence is\nbecoming overwhelming.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nChinese theory over the last several years indicates that China wants to become proficient in active\noffense, cyber reconnaissance, cyber-stratagem, and\ncomputer exploitation activities in case the PLA has\nto go to war. If China feels it can gain the initiative\nby obtaining information superiority or by preventing cyber strikes, then the coming years may involve\nchallenges from that sector. While it remains easy\nto measure the intent of troop deployments, the\nintent of a Chinese electron is harder to measure.\nIs it inserting a virus, conducting reconnaissance,\nor disabling a system? The world will move into\nuncertain territory as nations attempt to conduct\nresponses to and develop consequence management\nactions for truly disruptive electronic intrusions.\n\nThe Chinese note that IO tactics and techniques\nallow more emphasis on the principle of offense\nthan on traditional warfare. A weaker force, for\nexample, can inflict much damage on a superior\nforce with a properly timed and precisely defined\nasymmetric information attack. China portrays itself\nregularly as the weaker side of the U.S.-Chinese\nrelationship. It thinks that offensive operations such\nas information deterrence, information blockade,\ninformation power creation (electronic camouflage,\nnetwork deception, etc.), information contamination, information harassment, nodal destruction,\nsystem paralysis, and entity destruction are key to\nvictory in a modern conflict with America.\n\nOne should remember that this analysis stems\nonly from open-source information and public\ncomments from the PLA, and that China’s understanding of the intersection of strategy and information technology, especially as it relates to actual\nconflict, is not extensive in a practical sense. The\n\n\n## One of China’s stratagems is to “attack with a borrowed sword.”\n Perhaps the use of patriotic\n hackers fits this stratagem.\n\n\n-----\n\nChinese have little recent experience with conflict. Their forces have not fought an actual war in\ndecades. From a theoretical perspective, however,\nChina has written extensively on the use of information technology and electronic preemption and\ngiven both much thought. Chinese cyber intrusions\nindicate that the Chinese are gaining a lot of practical and theoretical experience in peacetime.\n\nThe PLA’s open-source comments can be interpreted either as an attempt to work with the West or\nto vigorously oppose it. Perhaps the PLA is being\nvery open and transparent in its cyber strategies,\nperhaps more open than in any other area of military operations. (The PLA is far more open with\nits information warfare thinking, for example, than\nRussia.) If the PLA’s intent is to oppose the West,\nit may in fact be concealing rich information warfare concepts in PLA “rules and regulations” (the\nPLA’s equivalent of doctrine) within the general\nstaff directorates and research institutes. China’s\ninformation warfare rules and regulations are not\n\n\navailable to other nations, while unclassified U.S.\ndoctrine is available to anyone on the Internet. The\nPLA keeps its rules and regulations close to its\nchest. In this case, lack of transparency introduces\nunwanted ambiguity. America and other nations\nunder threat of PLA incursions may react harshly\nto some scenarios developed by the Chinese and,\nthus, unintentionally set off a conflict.\n\nHow and when China might use its activeoffensive concepts for purposes other than reconnaissance is unclear, but, as general concepts, they\nare worrisome. It does not bode well for future\ncooperation and stability if Chinese theorists really\ndo believe (as they openly state) that China can\noffset an opponent’s information superiority only\nif China strikes first. China will no doubt continue\nto use technology in conjunction with innovative\nstratagems to try to deceive our high-tech systems\nor perhaps even to force errors in the cognitive\nprocesses of U.S. decision-makers.
