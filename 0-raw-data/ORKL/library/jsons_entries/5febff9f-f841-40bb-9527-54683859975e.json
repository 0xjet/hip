Out of\nthese, the Qakbot malware has been distributed in ISO and IMG file formats, and the ASEC\nanalysis team discovered that it has recently changed its distribution to the use of VHD\nfiles. Such use of disk image files (IMG, ISO, VHD) is seen to be Qakbot’s method of\nbypassing Mark of the Web (MOTW). Disk image files can bypass the MOTW feature\nbecause when the files inside them are extracted or mounted, MOTW is not inherited to the\nfiles.\n\n[Related webpage: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/005/](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/005/)\n\nThe phishing email that distributes Qakbot is shown below. Like in previous cases, it has an\nHTML file attachment which generates a compressed file.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the attached HTML file is executed, a page that imitates Google Drive is loaded. At\nthis stage, a compressed file contained in the HTML script is automatically created by the\nscript. The compressed file is password-protected, and the password can be found on the\nHTML page.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe compressed file contains a VHD file, which is the virtual disk file.\n\nVHD files can be automatically mounted on Windows 8 and onwards, and files are created\ninternally as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe properties of the created LNK file are as below, and it executes the reserved.cmd file\ncreated alongside it.\n\nThe reserved.cmd command is shown below. It executes the resting.cmd file, parses a\ncertain string, and transmits it as an argument.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe resting.cmd command is as follows. This command combines the string received as an\nargument and loads the hogs.tmp file through rundll32. The hogs.tmp file is a DLL file and is\nthe Qakbot malware.\n\nQakbot is a banking malware that executes the normal process wermgr.exe before injecting\nmalicious data. The injected process attempts to establish a connection to the C2, and when\nthe attempt is successful, it performs additional malicious behaviors such as downloading\nmalicious modules and extorting financial information. The process tree from the execution of\nLNK to the execution of Qakbot is as follows.\n\n**C2 : 2.14.82[.]210:2222**\n\nRecently, there has been a surge in malware using disk image files and various methods of\ndistribution to bypass security features. Users should refrain from opening emails from\nunknown sources and should not execute their attachments. AhnLab’s anti-malware product,\nV3, detects and blocks the malware using the alias below.\n\n**[File Detection]**\n\nTrojan/Win.BankerX-gen.R538785 (2022.12.08.01)\n\nDropper/BIN.Generic (2022.12.14.00)\n\nDropper/HTML.Qakbot (2022.12.14.00)\n\nTrojan/CMD.Runner (2022.12.14.00)\n\n**[IOC]**\n\nab4c2e5302c44ddc16f5fe4162640bd0\n\n5bd4a0f37a6420a00e1ceb378446f8b8\n\n\n-----\n\n1c1deaa10c6beea64661e8afba6ce276\n63524b4118710e4d6d522b0165d71b71\n\n5cbd45a04efdec84a576398e8ed702e6\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information-en/)\n\n[Tagged as:Qakbot,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/qakbot-en/) [VHD](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/vhd-en/)\n\n\n-----",
