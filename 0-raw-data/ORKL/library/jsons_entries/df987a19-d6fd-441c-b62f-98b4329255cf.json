The Shadow\nBroker appears to be highly competent at its trade: all secrets that are bought and sold never\nallow one customer of the Broker to gain a significant advantage, forcing the customers to\ncontinue trading information to avoid becoming disadvantaged, allowing the Broker to remain\nin business.\"[13]\n\n## Leak history\n\n### First leak: \"Equation Group Cyber Weapons Auction - Invitation\"\n\n\n[While the exact date is unclear, reports suggest that the preparation of the leak started at](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_leak)\nleast in the beginning of August,[14] and that the initial publication occurred August 13, 2016\nwith a Tweet from a [Twitter account \"@shadowbrokerss\" announcing a Pastebin page[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) and\na [GitHub repository containing references and instructions for obtaining and decrypting the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)\n[content of a file supposedly containing tools and exploits used by the Equation Group.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group)\n\n**Publication and speculation about authenticity**\n\n\nThe Pastebin[6] introduces a section titled \"Equation Group Cyber Weapons Auction Invitation\", with the following content:\n\n\n-----\n\nEquation Group Cyber Chase Weapons Auction - Invitation\n\n   - -----------------------------------------------\n!!! Attention government sponsors of cyber warfare and those who profit from it !!!!\n\n[How much you pay for enemies cyber weapons? Not malware you find in networks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_weapon)\nBoth sides, [RAT + LP, full state sponsor tool set? We find cyber weapons made by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_access_trojan)\ncreators of [stuxnet,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) [duqu,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duqu) [flame.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_(malware)) [Kaspersky calls Equation Group. We follow Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab)\nGroup traffic. We find Equation Group source range. We hack Equation Group. We find\nmany many Equation Group cyber weapons. You see pictures. We give you some\nEquation Group files free, you see. This is good proof no? You enjoy!!! You break many\nthings. You find many intrusions. You write many words. But not all, we are auction the\nbest files. .\n\nThe Pastebin includes various references for obtaining the file, named \"EQGRP-Auction[Files.zip\". This zip file contains seven files, two of which are the GPG-encrypted archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format))\n\"eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg\" and \"eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz.gpg\". The \"eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz.gpg\"\narchive's password was revealed in the original Pastebin to be `theequationgroup . The`\n\"eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz\" archive's password was revealed in a later Medium post to be\n```\nCrDj\"(;Va.*NdlnzB9M?@K2)#>deB7mN .\n\n```\n[The Pastebin continues with instructions for obtaining the password to the encrypted auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_auction)\nfile:\n\nAuction Instructions\n\n   - -------------------\nWe auction best files to highest bidder. Auction files better than stuxnet. Auction files\nbetter than free files we already give you. The party which sends most bitcoins to\naddress: 19BY2XCgbDe6WtTVbTyzM9eR3LYr6VitWK before bidding stops is winner,\nwe tell how to decrypt. Very important!!! When you send bitcoin you add additional\noutput to transaction. You add OP_Return output. In Op_Return output you put your\n(bidder) contact info. We suggest use bitmessage or I2P-bote email address. No other\ninformation will be disclosed by us publicly. Do not believe unsigned messages. We will\ncontact winner with decryption instructions. Winner can do with files as they please, we\nnot release files to public.\n\nThe initial response to the publication was met with some skepticism,[15] as to whether or not\nthe content actually would be \"...many many Equation Group cyber weapons.\"[6]\n\n\n### Second leak: \"Message #5 - TrickOrTreat\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThis publication, made on October 31, 2016, contains a list of servers, supposedly\ncompromised by Equation Group as well as references to seven supposedly undisclosed\ntools (DEWDROP, INCISION, JACKLADDER, ORANGUTAN, PATCHICILLIN, RETICULUM,\nSIDETRACK AND STOICSURGEON) also used by the threat actor.[16]\n\n### Third leak: \"Message #6 - BLACK FRIDAY / CYBER MONDAY SALE\"\n\nMessage #6 reads as follows:\n\nTheShadowBrokers is trying auction. Peoples no like. TheShadowBrokers is trying\ncrowdfunding. Peoples is no liking. Now TheShadowBrokers is trying direct sales. Be\nchecking out ListOfWarez. If you like, you email TheShadowBrokers with name of\nWarez you want make purchase. TheShadowBrokers is emailing you back bitcoin\naddress. You make payment. TheShadowBrokers emailing you link + decryption\npassword. If not liking this transaction method, you finding TheShadowBrokers on\nunderground marketplaces and making transaction with escrow. Files as always being\nsigned.[17]\n\n\nThis leak[18] contains 60 folders named in a way to serve as reference to tools likely used by\nEquation Group. The leak doesn't contain executable files, but rather screenshots of the\ntools file structure. While the leak could be a fake, the overall cohesion between previous\nand future leaks and references as well as the work required to fake such a fabrication, gives\ncredibility to the theory that the referenced tools are genuine.\n\n### Fourth leak: \"Don't Forget Your Base\"\n\n[On April 8, 2017, the Medium account used by The Shadow Brokers posted a new update.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website))\n\n[19] The post revealed the password to encrypted files released last year to be `CrDj\"`\n```\n(;Va.*NdlnzB9M?@K2)#>deB7mN . Those files allegedly reveal more NSA hacking tools.[20]\n\n```\nThis posting explicitly stated that the post was partially in response to President Trump's\n[attack against a Syrian airfield, which was also used by Russian forces.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Shayrat_missile_strike)\n\n\nThe decrypted file, eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz, contained a collection of tools primarily for\ncompromising Linux/Unix based environments.[21]\n\n### Fifth leak: \"Lost in Translation\"\n\nOn April 14, 2017, the [Twitter account used by The Shadow Brokers posted a tweet with a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter)\nlink[22] to the Steem blockchain. Herein, a message with a link to the leak files, encrypted\nwith the password `Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee .`\n\n\nThe overall content is based around three folders: \"oddjob\", \"swift\" and \"windows\".[23] The\nfifth leak is suggested to be the \"...most damaging release yet\"[24] and CNN quoted Matthew\nHickey saying, \"This is quite possibly the most damaging thing I've seen in the last several\nyears,\".[25]\n\n\n-----\n\nThe leak includes, amongst other things, the tools and exploits codenamed:\nDANDERSPIRITZ, ODDJOB, FUZZBUNCH, DARKPULSAR, ETERNALSYNERGY,\n[ETERNALROMANCE, ETERNALBLUE, EXPLODINGCAN and EWOKFRENZY.[24][26][27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETERNALBLUE)\n\nSome of the exploits targeting the Windows operating system had been patched in a\nMicrosoft Security Bulletin on March 14, 2017, one month before the leak occurred.[28][29]\nSom[30] e speculated that Microsoft may have been tipped off about the release of the exploits.\n\n\n**Eternalblue**\n\nMain article: [EternalBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue)\nOver 200,000 machines were infected with tools from this leak within the first two weeks,[31]\n[and in May 2017, the major WannaCry ransomware attack used the ETERNALBLUE exploit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack)\non [Server Message Block (SMB) to spread itself.[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block) The exploit was also used to help carry\nout the [2017 Petya cyberattack on June 27, 2017.[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Petya_cyberattack)\n\n\n[ETERNALBLUE contains kernel shellcode to load the non-persistent DoublePulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoublePulsar)\n[backdoor.[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)) This allows for the installation of the PEDDLECHEAP payload which would\nthen be accessed by the attacker using the DanderSpritz Listening Post (LP) software.[35][36]\n\n## Speculations and theories on motive and identity\n\n### NSA insider threat\n\n\n[James Bamford along with Matt Suiche speculated[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bamford) that an insider, \"possibly someone\n[assigned to the [NSA's] highly sensitive Tailored Access Operations\", stole the hacking tools.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations)\n\n[38][39] In October 2016, _[The Washington Post reported that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post)_ [Harold T. Martin III, a former](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_T._Martin_III)\n\ncontractor for [Booz Allen Hamilton accused of stealing approximately 50 terabytes of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booz_Allen_Hamilton)\nfrom the [National Security Agency (NSA), was the lead suspect. The Shadow Brokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency)\ncontinued posting messages that were cryptographically-signed and were interviewed by\nmedia while Martin was detained.[40]\n\n\n### Theory on ties to Russia\n\n[Edward Snowden stated on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) [Twitter on August 16, 2016 that \"circumstantial evidence and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter)\n[conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility\"[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_wisdom) and that the leak \"is likely a\nwarning that someone can prove responsibility for any attacks that originated from this\nmalware server\"[42] summarizing that it looks like \"somebody sending a message that an\nescalation in the attribution game could get messy fast\".[43][44]\n\n\n_[The New York Times put the incident in the context of the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)_ Democratic National Committee\n[cyber attacks and hacking of the Podesta emails. As US intelligence agencies were](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails)\ncontemplating counter-attacks, the Shadow Brokers code release was to be seen as a\nwarning: \"Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the\n\n\n-----\n\nState Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One\n[senior official compared it to the scene in The Godfather where the head of a favorite horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather)\nis left in a bed, as a warning.\"[45]\n\nIn 2019, David Aitel, a computer scientist formerly employed by the NSA, summarized the\nsituation with: \"I don’t know if anybody knows other than the Russians. And we don’t even\nknow if it’s the Russians. We don’t know at this point; anything could be true.\"[46]\n\n## References\n\n\n1. ^ a b _Ghosh, Agamoni (April 9, 2017). \"'President Trump what the f**k are you doing'_\n\n_say Shadow Brokers and dump more NSA hacking tools\"._ _International Business Times_\n_UK.
