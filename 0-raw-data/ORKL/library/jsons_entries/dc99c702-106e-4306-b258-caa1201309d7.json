In the past, we have seen how malefactors used creative\nmethods for [stealing credentials that can later on be sold in underground markets, exploit](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/netflix-scheme-steals-passwords-bank-details)\n[vulnerabilities, and create and distribute malware that enables the theft of user information](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/high-profile-mobile-apps-at-risk-due-to-three-year-old-vulnerability/)\nfor profit. Recently, we observed the service being used as a lure, with the promise of a \"free\n[Netflix account\" as a hook for distributing ransomware.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware)\n\n**[Related:** **[Netflix users are becoming favored hacking targets]](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/netflix-and-uber-users-cybercriminals-latest-favored-hacking-targets/)**\n\nIn the last week of January, a new ransomware leveraging on the popularity of the video[distribution network was uncovered by researchers highlighting the perils of content piracy.](https://twitter.com/struppigel/status/824145989523095552)\n[Based on a sample we analyzed, this particular method lures its would-be victim with \"free](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/netflix-scam-delivers-ransomware/)\nNetflix access\" via a supposed login generator for Windows/PC users that, in turn, would\nlead to the download of a new strain of ransomware (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_\nNETIX.A).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Fake Netflix login generator_\n\n_Figure 2: Prompt window of login information from a supposed genuine Netflix account_\n\nTypically found on suspicious sites offering cracked applications and unauthorized access to\npremium membership accounts, this ransomware variant takes the form of an executable\nnamed Netflix Login Generator v1.1.exe that drops a copy of itself upon execution. The\nbogus login generator, once clicked by the victim, will prompt another window that displays\nlogin information belonging to a genuine Netflix account paired with a fake password. This is\ndone to distract its victim from the ransomware routines running stealthy in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Ransom_\n\n_note displayed as wallpaper_\n\n_Figure 4: Ransom note containing payment instructions_\n\nUsing AES-256 encryption, this variant is capable of encrypting 39 file types, appending\nthem with a .se extension once done. The ransom will then demand a payment of 0.18\nbitcoins, or an amount equivalent to over US$100. Interestingly, the malware will not carry\nout its routine if the victim's system isn't running on Windows 7 or Windows 10.\n\nDespite the number of social engineering tactics being used to distribute ransomware, these\nnon-technical methods are still proving to be very effective. According to recent [reports, a](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/police-department-loses-years-worth-of-evidence-in-ransomware-incident/)\npolice department in Cockrell Hill, Texas, admitted to being hit by a ransomware infection\nthat cost the department eight years’ worth of evidence—an incident that highlighted the\n[importance of implementing a sound backup strategy.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/world-backup-day-the-3-2-1-rule/)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn an [initial press release issued by Chief of Police Stephen Barlag, it was noted that the](https://www.scribd.com/document/337573961/Cockrell-Hill-PD-Server-Virus)\nransomware infiltrated the department’s systems early in December of 2016. Following\ninstructions made by the FBI Cybercrimes unit, servers were wiped clean “to ensure that all\naffected files were deleted”. This led to the loss of bodycam, in-car, and department\nsurveillance videos, and some archived photos dating back to 2009.\n\nA more [detailed press release dated January 25, 2017 stated that the ransomware in](https://www.scribd.com/embeds/337574421/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-zdTIPidokkaDwvBR7YPj&show_recommendations=true)\nquestion was named “Osiris”, originating from a spam email message that spoofed a\nlegitimate department-issued email address. Security experts believe that the infection was\ncarried out by a ransomware variant with the same name, but the police department could\n[have been hit by a version of Locky (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_LOCKY.EXE)—](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-recap-dec-5-to-dec-16-2016)\none that appended filenames with an .osiris extension. This version emerged shortly after\nanother version of Locky (one that used a .aesir extension) was released, continuing a line of\n[variants that has used extension names alluding to mythological characters, including Odin](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-recap-oct-24-nov-4-2016)\n[and Thor.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-recap-sept-30-2016)\n\nAccording to the statement, the ransomware demanded a ransom that amounted to almost\n$4,000 in bitcoin. In addition to the affected in-house videos and photos, all Microsoft Office\nsuite documents from Word and Excel were affected. While no evidence points to whether\nany of the affected files were extracted and taken out of the database, the files have all been\ncorrupted and lost. However, the department noted that files stored in DVD and CD format\nare still accessible.\n\nDays prior to the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, another police department\n[got hit by ransomware. According to reports, the attack paralyzed 70% of storage devices](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/hackers-hit-dc-police-closed-circuit-camera-network-city-officials-disclose/2017/01/27/d285a4a4-e4f5-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_print.html)\nthat record data for the D.C. police surveillance cameras. Between January 12 and January\n15, 123 of 187 network video recorders were affected, forcing the city technicians to wipe its\nIT systems clean and reboot the devices across the city. Network video recorders are\nconnected to as many as four cameras at each site.\n\nWashington D.C. Chief Technology Officer Archana Vemulapalli said that no ransom was\npaid. Going into the details of the infection, Vemulapalli noted that the attack impacted only\nthe installed police cameras set up to monitor public areas and did not reach and spread into\nthe D.C. computer networks. Secret Service official Brian Ebert then shared that public safety\nwasn't compromised.\n\n[Not long after this incident, in Europe, a ransomware infection forced officials of four-star](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/30/austrian_hotel_ransomware_attack/)\nAustrian hotel Romantik Seehotel Jaegerwirt to pay the demanded ransom of €1,500 (or\nUS$1,605) in bitcoins. This is the second time the 111-year-old luxury hotel has been hit by a\ncyber-attack. This is different from previous attacks that focused on extracting payment card\ndetails. This time, extortionists prevented hotel admins from programming and issuing room\nkeycards to incoming guests, and left those who left their rooms unable to re-enter.\n\n\n-----\n\nManaging director Christoph Brandstaetter admitted to caving in to the extortion demand,\nand shared that plans of reverting to old-fashioned door locks are set to be implemented.\nUltimately, the incident serves as a warning to the hotel industry about the importance of\nsecurity.\n\nHere are other notable ransomware sightings over the past two weeks:\n\n**VirLock**\n\nWhen it was [first reported, VirLock (detected by Trend Micro as PE_VIRLOCK), was a](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/virlock-combines-file-infection-and-ransomware/)\nunique ransomware variant that was not only capable of locking the computer screen but\nalso of infecting files. It targets specific file types to encrypt and infect, from executable,\ncommon document, archive, audio/video, image, and certificate files.\n\nIt will then stealthily add an .RSRC section to the infected file. This includes the resources\nused by the executable that are not considered part of the executable, such as icons,\nimages, menus, and strings. This is done to store the resources of the host file, which tricks\nunsuspecting users into executing the infected files.\n\n_Figure 5: Sample ransom note reported in 2015_\n\n[Before January drew to a close, the variant made a comeback (with samples detected by](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/virlocker-ransomware-returns-just-as-virulent-as-ever/)\nTrend Micro as PE_VIRLOCK.K and PE_VIRLOCK.K-O), with operations and routines\nsimilar to when it was first discovered and reported. This variant encrypts a victim’s files and\nrepackages them into an executable file. Because Windows installations do not normally\ndisplay file extensions, and part of VirLock’s routine is to keep the source file’s icons, an\nunsuspecting user could execute the infected files, and worse, unknowingly distribute it to\n\n\n-----\n\nother users. Interestingly, it was reported that entering a 64-zeroes code to the Transfer ID\nsection of the ransomware tricks the malware into believing that the ransom—amounting to\n$250 in bitcoins—has been paid.\n\n**Charger Android Ransomware**\n\nGoogle’s Play Store recently removed a malicious app that reportedly carried a new\nransomware variant called Charger (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_ChgLocker.A).\nAccording to [reports, EnergyRescue, an app disguised as a battery-saving application,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/charger-android-ransomware-reaches-google-play-store/)\ngained access and stole a victim’s SMS messages and contact list before locking the user’s\ndevice. A ransom note then appeared, threatening to publish collected data online if the\n[ransom is not paid—a routine characteristic of “doxware” as stated below:](http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ransomware-has-evolved-and-its-name-is-doxware/a/d-id/1327767)\n\n_You need to pay for us, otherwise we will sell portion of your personal information on black_\n_market every 30 minutes. WE GIVE 100% GUARANTEE THAT ALL FILES WILL RESTORE_\n_AFTER WE RECEIVE PAYMENT. WE WILL UNLOCK THE MOBILE DEVICE AND DELETE_\n_ALL YOUR DATA FROM OUR SERVER! TURNING OFF YOUR PHONE IS_\n_MEANINGLESS, ALL YOUR DATA IS ALREADY STORED ON OUR SERVERS! WE STILL_\n_CAN SELLING IT FOR SPAM, FAKE, BANK CRIME etc… We collect and download all of_\n_your personal data. All information about your social networks, Bank accounts, Credit Cards._\n_We collect all data about your friends and family._\n\nSome of the threats were deemed empty, as there is no evidence that it can exfiltrate\ninformation.\n\nSecurity researchers who looked into Charger note that it possesses sophisticated\ncharacteristics that make it different from other Android ransomware variants—particularly\nthe techniques it uses to mask its malicious behavior to bypass detection.\n\n**Havoc**\n\nHavoc (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_HAVOC.A) is a newly-discovered variant that\nappends affected files with the .HavocCrypt extension name. This variant performs routines\ntypical of a ransomware type that uses symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to encrypt\nits targeted files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Havoc ransom note_\n\nA ransom of $150 in bitcoins comes with a 48-hour deadline. Failure to do so would result in\nthe permanent deletion of the decryption key provided by the online criminals. Apart from a\ncountdown timer, the ransom note also indicates that any form of attempt to close or shut\ndown the ransomware application will also lead to the deletion of the decryption key.\n\n**VxLock**\n\nAlso [discovered in the last two weeks is a new ransomware (detected by Trend Micro as](https://twitter.com/jiriatvirlab/status/824048113061138432)\nRANSOM_VXLOCK.A) named after the extension name it adds to the files it encrypts. With\nattributes common to ransomware variants seen in the past, this variant targets files and\nappends the extension name .vxlock to its encrypted file, renaming a locked Word document\nwith the file name file.doc into file.doc.vxlock.\n\nWhile researchers observe that this variant is set to undergo further development, it is\nnotable that at this stage, Vxlock has AntiVM, Anti-debug and Anti-Sandbox features.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Vxlock Anti-AV checking_\n\n**Crypto1CoinBlocker**\n\nThis particular variant (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_XORIST) surfaced as an\nupdated version of an earlier released ransomware, Xorist. Using RSA-2048 cryptography, it\ntargets affected system’s files and appends random alpha-numeric numbers serving as the\nvictim’s dedicated Bitcoin wallet address to the file name of the encrypted file. Following\nencryption, it displays a fake error message, a pop-window, and a text file placed on the\ndesktop, all signaling compromised data.\n\n_Figure 8: Fake error message_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Ransom note replacing the system's wallpaper_\n\nThe fake message, appearing after the locking of files was carried out alerts the victim to pay\na hefty sum of 5 bitcoins or an amount reaching almost US $ 5,000. Clicking “OK” to the\nmessage would prompt the desktop to display a new wallpaper that interestingly asks for a\nsmaller ransom of 1 bitcoin—almost $1,000—to be settled within a given time frame.\n\nA [multi-layered approach is key to defending all possible gateways from malware. IT](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-all-in-one-solutions-guide)\nadministrators in organizations should empower the workforce with necessary education to\nkeep employees well informed of attack tactics.
