In this report we will present evidence that the cyber\n\n\n-----\n\nmercenary group Dark Caracal is still active and continues to be focused on Latin America,\nas was [reported last year. We have discovered that Dark Caracal, using the Bandook](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/07/07/bandidos-at-large-spying-campaign-latin-america/)\nspyware, is currently infecting over 700 computers in Central and South America, primarily in\nThe Dominican Republic and Venezuela.\n\nIn our original 2018 report, we described a campaign targeting thousands of Lebanese\ncitizens with several different malware families, including a brand new mobile remote access\ntrojan we named Pallas and a Windows remote access trojan called Bandook. Through our\nresearch we were able to shut down the malware campaign and notify a number of the\nvictims. Our [Operation Manul report established that the actors behind the campaign were](https://www.eff.org/files/2018/01/29/operation-manul.pdf)\nworking with the governments of Lebanon and Kazakhstan. The variety of targets and the\napparent involvement of multiple governments throughout the campaigns lead us to believe\nthat Dark Caracal is a cyber-mercenary or hack-for-hire group.\n\nSince our original Dark Caracal report, there have been multiple reports on their continued\n[activities. Checkpoint Research wrote about a campaign in 2020 and we have continued to](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/bandook-signed-delivered/)\n[follow the activities of Dark Caracal with our most recent report, also in 2020. Most recently,](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/dark-caracal-you-missed-spot)\n[ESET wrote about Dark Caracal activities in Latin America in their report Bandidos at Large.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/07/07/bandidos-at-large-spying-campaign-latin-america/)\n\nDark Caracal is far from the only malware group currently targeting Latin America. The\n[Quantum malware group targeted the Dominican Republic’s Ministry of Agriculture in 2022.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-attack-disrupts-govt-agency-in-dominican-republic/)\n[The Dominican Republic is also a reported customer of NSO group.](https://dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2019/05/14/dominican-gov-bought-spyware-from-group-hacked-whatsapp-report/)\n\nGiven Dark Caracal’s history of working with national governments — such as Kazakhstan\nand Lebanon — on politically motivated campaigns, it is possible that the new campaign\ndescribed below is also at the behest of a government actor, but without more insight into\nwho the infected computers belong to, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the motivation\nof these attacks.\n\nRegardless, we call on lawmakers and regulators in South and Central America to be vigilant\nagainst Dark Caracal's spyware since it, and other spyware like it, has been used to commit\ngross human rights violations. Time and again, nation-states and cyber-mercenaries have\n[used spyware to target activists,](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/) [human rights defenders, and](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/phish-future) [journalists whose actual work](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/hanan-elatr-phone-pegasus/)\nis to uncover governments' wrongdoing, speak truth to power and hold governments\naccountable. Such targeting has resulted in a growing list of extrajudicial killings of journalists\nand human rights defenders.\n\nGovernments should consider calling for a moratorium on the governmental use of these\nmalware technologies, support computer security research, and human rights for all,\nincluding transparency, accountability and redress for victims.\n\nGovernments must recognize that government hostility to device security is dangerous for\ntheir people. If one government can use malware against civilians under a rival government\nthere is nothing stopping the rival government from doing the same. Governments should be\n\n\n-----\n\nfocusing on improving computer security and protecting their citizens rights to freedom of\nexpression.\n\nWe hope this report will add to a body of work exposing cyber mercenaries and convince\npolicymakers that cyber mercenaries and nation-state hacking are truly a global threat to\nhuman rights and civil society.\n\n## A new campaign appears\n\nRecently we discovered a new version of the Bandook malware, which has been updated to\nhave 148 unique commands it can send the infected computer, far more than the 120\navailable in previous samples. This sample and related samples seem to be part of a\ncampaign that began in March 2022, utilizing a new command and control server (a remote\ncomputer which issues orders to the infected computers and receives data stolen from the\ninfected computers) at the domain deapproved[.]ru.\n\nIn the “Bandidos at Large” report, ESET researchers detailed a mechanism within Bandook\nfor downloading Windows DLLs (software libraries for Windows) from a domain secondary to\nthe main command and control server to gain additional functionality. On analyzing the\nsamples we obtained, we found that in this case the mechanism for downloading additional\nDLLs pointed to the domain unclesow[.]com. However, upon investigating, we realized that\nthe unclesow.com domain had not yet been registered. We figured that this domain could\n[provide information on Dark Caracal’s activities, so we registered it and set up a sinkhole (a](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/dns-sinkhole/)\nserver which hosts a domain that previously belonged to a malware campaign to protect\ninfected computers and collect information.)\n\nUnclesow[.]com is currently hosted by EFF. Since registering this domain, we have been\ncollecting aggregate information on the victims of this malware campaign. Based on daily\ntraffic logs, there appear to be between 600 and 800 infected machines at any time, mostly\nacross Central and South America. Since every Bandook infection connects to the\nsecondary domain multiple times per day, we are confident that we are seeing all infections\nfor this current campaign. Because of our concern for the privacy of the victims of this\nmalware campaign we have configured the server to delete logs after four weeks and collect\nthe [bare minimum of necessary information.](http://unclesow.com/privacy.html)\n\nThe same day that we set up DNS entries for unclesow[.]com, several other domains that\n[had been previously registered had their DNS suddenly pointed at the same server that](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/143.198.150.17/relations)\nhosted unclesow. There were 6 domains pointed automatically at our server:\n```\nsetsizee[.]com\nseconsave[.]com\nscanlostt[.]com\nsanesity[.]biz\nEmail-securlink[.]com\ngoadaaddy[ ]com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nBased on the timing and apparent phishing-related nature of these domains, we suspect this\nwas an automatic process, possibly set up by the same people running the Dark Caracal\ncampaign. A few days later, several of the domains were pointed at a new IP address not\nunder our control. However, three of the domains (seconsave[.]com scanlostt[.]com and\nsensity[.]biz) still point to our sinkhole server. We were able to identify several other related\ndomains which were hosted on other servers at the same time as these domains (when they\nwere not pointing to our sinkhole.)\n\nThe connection of these domains to the current Dark Caracal campaign is unclear. They may\nbe for a different campaign or another purpose The tactics and tools and procedures used\ndon’t match up, with the above domains being hosted on DigitalOcean registered with\nNameCheap and not mentioned in the Bandook samples, whereas the domains mentioned\nin the Bandook samples are hosted with the bulletproof hosting provider OvO [ovo.sc], and\nregistered with a company called 1984 [1984.is]. Additionally, we observed no interesting\ntraffic or traffic indicative of a Bandook infection to any of the domains pointed at our sinkhole\nother than unclesow[.]com. The only connection to this campaign for these domains is the\nfact that they were pointed at our sinkhole automatically when we set it up. For now it\nremains a mystery.\n\nSince we registered the unclesow[.]com domain, the attackers have changed the command\nand control domain twice, first to cudenpower.co and then to bomes[.]ru. However, in both\ncases and still to this day, they have not changed the secondary infection domain from\nunclesow[.]com, thus our sinkhole continues to function even for new samples of malware. It\nis unclear whether the malware operators realize that their secondary domain is controlled by\nus at this time.\n\n## Bandook Continues Evolving\n\nThe versions of Bandook this campaign uses appear to be newer than the ones used in the\nlast campaigns reported on by ESET. The first stage of the malware has switched from using\n[GOST for encryption of the payload to using DES for encryption of its second stage payload.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOST_(block_cipher))\nThe key for decryption is derived from a passphrase by hashing it with the RIPEMD-128\nalgorithm.\n\nAdditionally the malware contains 148 possible commands it can send the infected computer\nfrom the command and control server instead of the previous 132 in the samples analyzed\nby ESET. The commands include capabilities such as: turning on the webcam, adding or\nremoving files from the computer, taking control of the mouse, recording the screen, starting\na remote desktop session, and downloading other libraries for additional functionality (see\nappendix for more.)\n\nThese changes indicate a deep nexus to the Dark Caracal group as the source code for\nBandook is not public and the malware is not for sale as far as we know.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the time of this report, unpacked versions of malware were detected by 41 out of 70\nantivirus products in VirusTotal whereas a representative sample of the packed malware was\ndetected by 35 out of 71 antivirus products.\n\nThe command and control servers are more locked-down than we have seen in the past,\nwith the only open services being SSH and the command and control service listening on\nport 2222. There is no web administration interface as has been seen in the past.\n\n## Victimology\n\nFrom connections to our sinkhole we have observed victims in several Central and South\nAmerican countries. Approximately 75% of infected computers are located in The Dominican\nRepublic and 20% in Venezuela.\n\nA map of Bandook infections based on Shodan Data.\nBecause the infected computers connect to the sinkhole server and make an http GET\nrequest for the path `/flras/get.php?huln=nevi` approximately every three hours we can\nreliably estimate the number of infected machines. At its peak we suspect more than 800\ncomputers were infected in this malware campaign. However, this number may be lower if\nsome machines are changing their IP addresses in the middle of the day due to moving to a\nnew network or a dynamic IP address changing. Since all connections initiated by Bandook\nuse a standard user agent (see Appendix) we do not have a way to keep track of individual\nmachines when they change IP addresses.\n\nBecause Bandook malware samples have only ever been observed for Windows, we\nassume that the infected machines are all Windows computers. According to Shodan data,\nmany of the IP addresses belong to commodity routers on consumer ISP networks. It is our\n\n\n-----\n\nassumption that those routers have dynamic IP addresses that frequently change, thus\nincreasing the number of unique IPs connecting to our sinkhole.\n\nInfections drop off on Saturdays and especially Sundays, leading us to believe that most\ninfected machines are located at places of business. This hypothesis is also supported by\nthe number of connections from infected machines dropping on major public holidays such\nas Christmas Eve, Christmas, and New Year’s Day.\n\nNumber of infected computers connecting to our sinkhole per day\nThough we haven’t been able to contact any of the victims of this current campaign, their\nlocation opens the possibility that it is a continuation of the campaign outlined in the\nBandidos at Large Report. Because of Dark Caracal’s history of working on behalf of\ngovernments, we can’t discount that possibility here either, though the client’s identity\nremains a mystery for now.\n\n_Thanks to ESET,
