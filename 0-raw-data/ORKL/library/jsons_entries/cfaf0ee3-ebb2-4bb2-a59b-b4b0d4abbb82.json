The author (or a group) presented during my talk shows quite the\nrange, from simply repacking apps with a bespoke advertising SDK to writing a sophisticated\nrooting trojan with new techniques never seen in other harmful apps.\n\nTheir most complex creation is called “Zen”. Zen bundles exploits to gain privileged root\naccess. It then uses this access to create fake Google accounts on devices. These accounts\nare created by abusing accessibility service with additional help from code injection.\n\nApart from that, authors also wrote click fraud and spammy apps, mostly because of the\nincreasing difficulty of obtaining a reliable Android exploit and security improvements in\nnewer Android versions.\n\n**I will present all the different kinds and variations of malware coming from this group,**\n**highlighting the most interesting, complex and unusual technical details. This**\n**includes circumventing CAPTCHA images and a number of persistence mechanisms,**\n**including the modification of Android framework files.**\n\n\n-----",
