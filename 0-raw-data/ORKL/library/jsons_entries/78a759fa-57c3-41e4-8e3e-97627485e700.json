The virus called itself DarkWorld in the ransom letter.\n\nWhat to be mentioned is that, unlike the conventional ransomware method that only encrypts\nransomware in the past, the virus also plays a dual role as an information stealer while\nransoming. The information stolen by the virus author may be further sold for profit.\n\nFrom this point, the destructive mode of ransomware has changed. It is foreseeable that\ntraditional malicious software may gradually cease to be satisfied with a single malicious\nbehavior, but will enrich itself into a multi-functional malicious code integrator, causing\nmultiple destructive consequences.\n\nAfter the virus encrypts the victim’s files, it will ask for a Bitcoin ransom equivalent to $300.\nHowever, users do not need to worry, the 360 Total Security can intercept and kill the\nransomware before problems occur.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Trojan horse behavior and encryption method**\n\n1. Poisoning\n\nAfter the DarkWorld ransomware runs, it will encrypt the file using the Rijndael encryption\nalgorithm, and then add the suffix of the encrypted file “.dark”, and create “Important.txt” as a\nransom letter. The ransom letter requires the victim to send\n“1EdxGR5fxRjhWtxNSbyDHv4nVdx5BP54L2” this The wallet address remits the equivalent\nof 300 USD in Bitcoin ransom, and sends the victim id to the virus author’s mailbox\ndarksimo@protonmail.com to obtain the decryption key and decrypt the victim’s files.\n\nDarkWorld Blackmail Letter Important.txt Blackmails Bitcoin\n\n\n-----\n\nEncrypted files are added with .dark file extension\n\n1. Blackmail encryption and information theft\n\nThe Trojan pretends to be a third-party software file name and icon to induce users to\ndouble-click to run it, and then begins to traverse the file to encrypt and steal information\nthrough the Rijndael encryption algorithm.\n\nBefore starting encryption, the virus will first send the generated random encryption key and\nother information to the virus author server. Afterwards, it began to traverse the files and\nencrypt the files with the specified suffix through the Rijndael encryption algorithm. At the\nsame time, pay attention to avoiding the specified system folder to avoid affecting the\noperating system. For txt files smaller than 2M, stolen and uploaded to the author’s server\nand then encrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore starting encryption, the virus first generates an encryption key consisting of a string of\n“random number + current time”, and then obtains the victim’s machine name, plus the\nvictim’s id, and sends it to the Trojan server.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe virus also pays attention to avoiding the specified system file directory to avoid affecting\nthe operating system, and then encrypts the file with the specified extension.\n\nDarkWorld files avoid system critical directories\n\n\n-----\n\nTarget file extension\n\nIn the file encryption thread of the virus, the size of the txt file is also judged to determine\nwhether to steal the user’s local file to the server. For txt files smaller than 2M (2097200\nbyte), the encryption thread will steal it and upload it to the Trojan server.\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkWorld steals local files\n\nDarkWorld uses Rijndael encryption algorithm\n\n**Security advice**\n\n1. Go to http://www.360totalsecurity.com/ to download and install 360 Total Security, and\n\nkeep 360 Total Security process permanent, which can effectively protect against\nsimilar virus threats and prevent problems before they occur;\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Improve personal network security awareness and not easily download so-called free\n\nactivation tools and other software from various download sites. It is recommended to\ndownload and install the software from official channels such as the official software\nwebsite. For unfamiliar software blocked by 360 Total Security, do not continue to run\nand add trust.\n\n[Learn more about 360 Total Security](https://www.360totalsecurity.com/en/)\n\n\n-----",
