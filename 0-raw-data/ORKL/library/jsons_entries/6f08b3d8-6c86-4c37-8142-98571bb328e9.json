Others seem to survive year after year, with victims falling for the same tricks.\nBanking trojans such as TeaBot and FluBot and the \"Is it you in the video?\" scams are just two\nexamples of threats that adapt to remain relevant.\n\nThe impact of TeaBot and FluBot trojans became apparent last year globally. Threat actors used\nmockups of popular apps, applications posing as ad-blockers and sent SMS messages from\nalready-compromised devices to spread the malware organically. The banking trojans' functionality\nare straightforward - they steal banking, contact, SMS and other types of private data from infected\ndevices. They have an arsenal of other commands available, including sending an SMS with\ncontent provided by the command and control (CnC). This allows its operators to change targeted\nbanks and other features on the fly, depending on the countries affected.\n\nThese threats survive because they come in waves with different messages and in different time\nzones. While the malware itself remains pretty static, the message used to carry it, the domains that\nhost the droppers, and everything else is constantly changing.\n\nSince the beginning of December, Bitdefender Labs intercepted over 100,000 malicious SMS\nmessages tying to distribute FluBot malware by analyzing telemetry from the new Scam Alert\nfeature, now available by default in Bitdefender Mobile Security & Antivirus. Findings indicate\nattackers are modifying their subject lines and using older yet proven scams to entice users to click.\nAdditionally, attackers are rapidly changing the countries they are targeting in this campaign.\n\nThe following is a detailed overview of the findings:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1_\nWith the help of Scam Alert, we've seen how this malicious SMS now informs users of potential\nproblems with parcel delivery and tells users that Flash player needs an update, that they have a\nmissed voice mail or that some Android component needs upgrading.\n\n### FluBot distribution worldwide\n\nThe FluBot operators target different zones for short periods - sometimes just a few days. For\nexample, in the month between Dec. 1 of last year and Jan. 2 of this year, the malware was highly\nactive in Australia, Germany, Spain, Italy and a few other European countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2_\nStarting Jan. 3, 2022 the attackers began to look at other countries to spread their malware,\nincluding Poland, Romania and the Netherlands. In fact, Romania has been one of the main targets\nin the past few days.\n\n_Figure 3_\nThe worldwide distribution of the past couple of waves we've observed in the past couple of months\nshows Australia as a primary target.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4_\n\n### ‘Is this you in this video?’ message adapted in FluBot campaign\n\nA simple phishing campaign is still making the rounds on social media, primarily through Facebook's\nMessenger. Users receive a message from a friend in their list with a question (“Is this you in this\nvideo?“ or some variation) and a link. When the victim clicks on the link, it usually redirects them to a\nfake Facebook login that gives attackers direct access to credentials.\n\nThe phishing campaign is already a couple of years old, and it's persistent. It shows up on\nFacebook in waves and doesn't seem to disappear. We mention this campaign because FluBot\noperators have adopted a similar message for their malware. In this situation, victims receive an\nSMS message along the lines of “Is this you in this video?.”\n\nThe goal is the same - to somehow mislead people into installing the software under some pretext,\nby telling them that Flash or some Android component actually needs an upgrade after they've\nopened the link informing them they could be in a video. This new vector for banking trojans shows\nthat attackers are looking to expand past the regular malicious SMS messages.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Banker installation posing as Flash update_\n\nIn fact, Romania has been one of the main targets in the latest \"Is this you in this video?\" campaign\ndistributed through Messenger. We've intercepted over 10,000 malicious URLs just in the past 30\ndays. While the two campaigns are likely not related, it’s interesting to see how one group uses the\nmethods of another.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5_\n\n### New TeaBot campaign targeting official apps stores\n\nMost believe the official Google Play Store is completely safe to download and vetted for security\npurposes before they become available to the public. That's true most of the time but not always.\n\nSometimes malicious apps are missed and stay active on official stores accruing thousands of\ndownloads before they are noticed and taken down. We found something strange during our\ninvestigation of the new FluBot campaign. We initially believed Flubot was being installed on\ndevices without a malicious SMS being sent but discovered that a different malicious banking bot\nwas installed on the same device.\n\nWe determined it was a TeaBot variant, and further investigation led to the finding of a dropper\napplication in Google Play Store named the 'QR Code Reader - Scanner App', with over 100,000\ndownloads, that has been distributed 17 different TeaBot variants for a little over a month.\n\nBitdefender's security researchers have found that the 'QR Code Reader - Scanner App' found in\nthe Google Play Store is likely a heavily encrypted TeaBot dropper. In just 30 days, it dropped 17\nvariants of the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6_\nThe application itself is not malicious, and it does offer the promised functionality, but that's a known\ntactic. The malicious code within the app has a minimal footprint, as the authors were careful about\nnot triggering security heuristics. The path followed after installation is relevant in itself.\n\nWhen the user starts the Android app, it also starts a background service that checks the country\ncode of the current registered operator (or the cell nearby). If the country starts with a \"U\" or is\nunavailable, the app skips executing the malicious code, which means that countries like Ukraine,\nUzbekistan, Uruguay and the US are skipped.\n\nIf the app passes the check, it retrieves the context of a settings file from GitHub from the following\naddress:\n\nraw.githubusercontent[.]com/isaacluten/qrbarcode/main/settings\n\nThis file contains a different GitHub repository file link pointing to the actual payload to download.\n\n_Figure 7_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis settings file, from the QR Code Reader repository, has the URL changed whenever a different\npayload URL is needed or even removed if the authors wish to deactivate the malicious behavior\ntemporarily.\n\nIf there is a URL in the settings file, the APK is downloaded and saved to\n'/sdcard/Android/data/com.lorankey.qrcode/files/Download/addonqrapp.apk', and the installation is\ninitiated.\n\nThe app itself presents a fake UI saying that an update is required, and users are instructed to allow\nthe Android app to install third-party packages.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8_\n\nCombining our telemetry with GitHub's repositories history, we identified a minimum of 17 different\nversions of TeaBot that were deployed to victims from Dec. 6 of last year to Jan. 17 of this year.\n\n### GitHub accounts\n\nThe malware has a hardcoded GitHub URL to get the next payload (another GitHub URL). Looking\nat GitHub's history and our own analysis, we have the following accounts associated with this threat:\n\nGitHub user **Timeline** **Purpose**\n\n\ngithub.com/isaacluten Created\n2021.12.06\n\ngithub.com/lotterevich First seen\n2021.12.06\n\nLast seen\n2021.12.17\n\ngithub.com/rosamundstone393 Created\n2021.12.07\n\n\nConfiguration files storage; indicates the\npayload location\n\nHeld payloads, but was deleted\n\nFluBot payloads are currently uploaded here\n\n\nBetween the accounts, all payloads' configurations seen were as follows:\n\n**Content of raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacluten/qrbarcode/main/settings**\n\n\n-----\n\n1.0.0<<https://github.com/rosamundstone393/maina/blob/main/today.apk?raw=true\n\n1.0.0<<https://github.com/lotterevich/lott/blob/main/today.apk?raw=true\n\n1.0.0<<https://github.com/lotterevich/lott/blob/main/fullymain.apk?raw=true\n\n1.0.2\n\n1.0.1\n\n1.0.0<<https://github.com/lotterevich/lott/raw/main/maina.apk\n\n1.0.0\n\n1.0.0<<https://github.com/lotterevich/lott/raw/main/Flashlight.apk\n\nCurrently, all payloads are uploaded as\n\"1.0.0<<hxxps://github.com/rosamundstone393/maina/blob/main/today.apk?raw=true\"\n\nThere is one repository for payload configuration for the QR Code Reader app, and another\nrepository was created for an app named 2FA Authenticator, also a dropper, that was just released.\n\n_Figure 9_\n\n### Telemetry\n\n\n-----\n\nThe QR Code Reader application is available for download globally but, oddly, our telemetry shows\nthe vast majority of scans on the dropped payloads come from Great Britain. We presume that the\nauthors of the malware have made specific ad campaigns targeting that area.\n\n_Figure 10_\nBitdefender’s security researchers also found one of the ways this app manages to spread through\nthe userbase. Victims likely see an ad for this malicious app in other legitimate Android applications\nand install it through that vector. The attackers pay to appear in Google Ads, giving them screen\ntime in an app that could have millions of users.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe 2FA Authenticator we found is a similar malicious dropper currently available on the Play Store.\nFortunately, this version of the malware dropper had no chance to infect as many victims because\nwe caught it as soon as it was released.\n\n_Figure 11_\nAll countries that are excluded by the malware by ISO codes:\n\n'UG' 'UGANDA'\n\n'UA' 'UKRAINE'\n\n'US' 'UNITED STATES'\n\n'UM/UMI' 'UNITED STATES MINOR OUTLYING ISLANDS'\n\n'UY' 'URUGUAY'\n\n'UZ' 'UZBEKISTAN'\n\n\n-----\n\n### Google Play Store maybe not as safe as you think\n\nSearching for similar dropper behavior, we found other applications that used to be available on\nGoogle Play and distributed TeaBot. As far as we can tell, they've been silently removed without\nanyone noticing they were ever live.\n\n\nApp name App package name Developer Last known\ndownload count\n\n\nLast seen\non Play\n\n\nQR Scanner\nAPK\n\nQR Code\nScan\n\nSmart\nCleaner\n\n\ncom.paccinisantino861.qrscanner santino\npaccini\n\ncom.scannet.qrbar Bailey\nLeightonware\n\n\n10,000+ 2022.01.07\n\n10,000+ 2021.04.21\n\n\ncom.butkusnedas.smart.cleaner Butkusnedas 1,000+ 2021.12.17\n\n\nOne relevant feature for this malware is the complete lack of malicious code in the initial versions.\nAttackers initially submit clean apps and introduce the malicious component in subsequent updates.\nThe three apps mentioned above provide the perfect example of this behavior.\n\n\nApp\nname\n\nQR\nScanner\nAPK\n\nQR\nCode\nScan\n\nSmart\nCleaner\n\n\nVersion\ncode\n\n\nVersion name APK MD5\n\n\n4 2.4 bea21055cda8c81b4e5a46c1fac2b570\n\n0f621dbe75d1d223353e9a74209c43cb\n\n4 1.03 125a0b5013e3ef4b6a4af2d184b68a0b\n\n2 2.0 77dd1738f3109a15a9b38db2845bbb54\n\n\n3 3.0 1c486fe75688a2fd67b26c22d0f85adc\n\ndf7770114becbbee2f06be8947039c31\n\n### Rough weather we're having\n\nThe Weather Cast application by Weather Live is an active app on Google Play that also drops\nbanking malware. Determining the exact nature of the malware is challenging because threat\ngroups copy much of the code from one malware to another, following up with heavy encryption to\n\n\n-----\n\nobfuscate the code. In the end, this only makes it more difficult to pinpoint the exact version. It\ndoesn’t affect the ability of Bitdefender's Mobile Security & Antivirus to stop the malicious behavior.\n\n_Figure 12_\nThis malicious dropper retrieves the malware from its firebase (weather-live-a2756.firebaseio.com)\ndatabase:\n\n_Figure 13_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe firebase currently indicates that this banking malware has been dropped on 274 victims, but the\nactual number could be a lot bigger, given that the app is not new. It's also likely that 10,000\ndownloads indicated on Google Play are not all real user downloads.\n\nThe malicious payload is saved as SampleDownloadApp.apk on the file system and triggers the\nregular to install.\n\nCurrently, although the firebase returns the download URL is currently down\n(polarnauc.com/rm71.apk), our telemetry indicates that victims downloaded the malicious banker\ntrojan app.\n\nWeather Cast dropper

weather application we found is named Weather Daily from WeatherDaily, and it's still on\nGoogle Play, with the same malicious download capability.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14_\nThis application has the same firebase URL used in our first, thus it is also inactive at this point.\n\nWeather Daily dropper
