The group has been known to focus on government and military\norganizations.\n\nAlthough reports on Naikon’s activity were so far published only in 2015 and 2020, the\npersistent APT has been quietly operational for at least a decade, making changes to its\ninfrastructure and toolset to ensure it can stay under the radar.\n\nLast year, after its activity was exposed, Naikon made a similar move: it switched to a new\nbackdoor, although it continued to use previously known malware for the first stages of\nattack. The group has also been abusing legitimate software for nefarious purposes.\n\n[The latest campaign ran between June 2019 and March 2021, and one of the new](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/396/Bitdefender-PR-Whitepaper-NAIKON-creat5397-en-EN.pdf)\nbackdoors, dubbed RainyDay, was first used in attacks in September 2020, Bitdefender\nsays. To remain undetected, the APT would mimic legitimate software running on the\ninfected machines. The purpose of the attacks remains espionage and data exfiltration, and\nthe group continues to focus on Southeast Asian targets.\n\nThe RainyDay backdoor allows the attackers to perform reconnaissance on the infected\nmachines, deploy reverse proxies, install scanners, execute tools for password dumping,\nmove laterally on the victim’s network, and achieve persistence.\n\nNaikon has always used DLL side-loading for the RainyDay execution, “and there was\nalways a vulnerable executable along with a DLL file and the rdmin.src file containing the\nencrypted backdoor payload,” Bitdefender explains.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe same execution technique along with the use of rdmin.src are employed by China-linked\nCycldek (Goblin Panda, Conimes) for the deployment of the FoundCore RAT. Furthermore,\nthe shellcode used for payload extraction and other payload characteristics suggest a close\nconnection between the two malware families and a possible overlap in activity between the\ntwo groups.\n\nThe similarities are not surprising, considering that Chinese threat actors are known to be\nsharing infrastructure and tools, and because Naikon was previously observed using exploits\nattributed to other threat groups, in an attempt to evade detection.\n\nAs part of the latest attacks, the adversary also deployed a second new backdoor called\nNebulae, likely as a precautionary measure.\n\nAttempting to impersonate a legitimate application, the Nebulae backdoor can harvest drive\ninformation, list and modify files and directories, execute and terminate processes, and\ndownload and run files from the command and control (C&C) server.\n\n“The data we obtained so far tell almost nothing about the role of the Nebulae in this\noperation, but the presence of a persistence mechanism could mean that it is used as a\nbackup access point to victims in the case of a negative scenario for actors,” Bitdefender\nnotes.\n\nFurthermore, admin domain credentials were used for lateral movement, likely after being\nstolen at an early stage of the attack. Persistence was typically achieved manually, while\ndata of interest was exfiltrated to Dropbox.\n\n“Our research confidently points to an operation conducted by the Naikon group based on\nthe extraction of the C&C addresses from Nebulae samples. The particular domain\ndns.seekvibega.com obtained from such a sample points out to the Naikon infrastructure,”\nBitdefender concludes.\n\n**Related:** **[FireEye CEO: Reckless Microsoft Hack Unusual for China](https://www.securityweek.com/fireeye-ceo-reckless-microsoft-hack-unusual-china)**\n\n**Related:** **[Cyber Attack Tied to China Boosts Development Bank's Chief](https://www.securityweek.com/cyber-attack-tied-china-boosts-development-banks-chief)**\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\nIonut Arghire is an international correspondent for SecurityWeek.\nPrevious Columns by Ionut Arghire:\n[IBM Dives Into TrickBot Gang's Malware Crypting Operation](https://www.securityweek.com/ibm-dives-trickbot-gangs-malware-crypting-operation)\n[Nikkei Says Customer Data Likely Impacted in Ransomware Attack](https://www.securityweek.com/nikkei-says-customer-data-likely-impacted-ransomware-attack)\n\n\n-----\n\n[New Brute Force Attacks Against SQL Servers Use PowerShell Wrapper](https://www.securityweek.com/new-brute-force-attacks-against-sql-servers-use-powershell-wrapper)\n[DoJ Will No Longer Use CFAA to Charge Ethical Hackers](https://www.securityweek.com/doj-will-no-longer-use-cfaa-charge-ethical-hackers)\n[US Recovers $15 Million From Ad Fraud Group](https://www.securityweek.com/us-recovers-15-million-ad-fraud-group)\n[Virtual Event Series - Security Summit Online Events by SecurityWeek](https://www.securitysummits.com/)\n\n[2022 ICS Cyber Security Conference | USA [Hybrid: Oct. 24-27]](http://www.icscybersecurityconference.com/)\n\n[2022 Singapore/APAC ICS Cyber Security Conference]](http://www.icscybersecurityconference.com/singapore)\n\n[2022 CISO Forum: September 13-14 - A Virtual Event](http://www.cisoforum.com/)\n\nsponsored links\n\n**Tags:**\n\n[NEWS & INDUSTRY](https://www.securityweek.com/news-industry)\n[Virus & Threats](https://www.securityweek.com/virus-threats)\n\n[Copyright © 2022 Wired Business Media.
