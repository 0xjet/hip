Upon further investigation, we discovered that it’s malware\ndisguised as an Exploit. Similarly, we found a malicious sample that appears to be a fake POC of CVE2022-24500. Both the malicious samples were available on GitHub. Interestingly both repositories belong\nto the same profile, indicating the possibility that Threat Actor (TA) might be hosting a malware campaign\ntargeting Infosec Community.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show the malware hosted on GitHub.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Exploit\n\nfor CVE-2022-26809\n\nFigure 2: Exploit for CVE-2022-24500\nTA used this unique technique to lure individuals into executing the malware. In the last 24 hours, TAs\nwere also discussing these exploits on the cybercrime forum. For example, we came across a post\nwhere TAs discussed CVE-2022-24500, pointing to the fake POC GitHub repository, as shown in Figure\n3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Post on a cybercrime forum\n\n## Technical Details:\n\n[The malware is a .Net binary packed with ConfuserEX, a free, open-source protector for .NET](https://yck1509.github.io/ConfuserEx/#:~:text=ConfuserEx%20is%20an%20free%2C%20open,Graphical%20interface)\napplications. The figure below shows the file details.\n\nFigure 4: File\n\ndetails\nThe malware does not have any exploit code targeting the above vulnerabilities. Instead, it prints a fake\nmessage showing that it is trying to exploit and executes shellcode, as shown in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Prints fake message\nThe malware uses the Sleep() function to print the messages after a small interval, to appear more\nlegitimate. Figure 6 shows the code snippet of malware that print fake messages on execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Unpacked Code\nAfter printing the fake message, the malware executes the hidden PowerShell command using cmd.exe\nto deliver the actual payload. The below figure depicts the network communication to a command-andcontrol server for downloading the Cobalt-Strike Beacon.\n\nFigure 7: Network communication\nThe Cobalt-Strike Beacon can be used for other malicious activities such as downloading additional\npayloads, lateral movement, etc. This fact possibly indicates that the infosec community is also an active\ntarget of attackers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nTAs are adopting various techniques to carry out attacks. In this case, we witnessed how the TA used\nfake POCs to lure the victims into executing the malware. Usually, people working in information security\nor TAs use exploits to check for vulnerabilities. Hence, this malware might only target people from this\ncommunity. Therefore, it becomes essential for the Infosec Community members to check the credibility\nof sources before downloading any proof of concept.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:\n\nAvoid downloading files from unknown websites.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices,\nincluding PC, laptop, and mobile.\n\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their authenticity.\n\nEducate employees in terms of protecting themselves from threats like phishing’s/untrusted URLs.\nMonitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.\nEnable Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solution on the employees’ systems.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n**Execution** [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/) User Execution\n\n**Defense Evasion** [T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/) Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n\n**Command and Control** [T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/) Application Layer Protocol\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n192.10.22.112 45.197.132.72 **IP** **C2**\n\n\n7e0c8be0d03c75bbdc6fd286a796434a\n0e2e0d26caa32840a720be7f67b49d45094861cb\n6c676773700c1de750c3f8767dbce9106317396d66a004aabbdd29882435d5e0\n\nfdcf0aad080452fa14df221e74cca7d0\n7431846d707140783eea466225e872f8757533e3\nfa78d114e4dfff90a3e4ba8c0a60f8aa95745c26cc4681340e4fda79234026fd\n\n\n**MD5**\n**SHA-1**\n**SHA-**\n**256**\n\n**MD5**\n**SHA-1**\n**SHA-**\n**256**\n\n\nMalicious\nbinary\n\nMalicious\nBinary\n\n\n-----",
