Believed to be controlled by China. For the �rst time, in a joint\n\ninvestigation, German public broadcasters BR and NDR are shedding light on how the hackers\n\noperate and how widespread they are. — by Hakan Tanriverdi, Svea Eckert, Jan Strozyk, Maxim\nilian Zierer and Rebecca Ciesielski\n\n[Unser Bericht zur digitalen „Söldnertruppe“, die Industriespionage betreibt.](https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/index.html)\n\nThis investigation starts with a code: daa0 c7cb f4f0 fbcf d6d1 . If you know what to\n\nlook for, you’ll �nd Winnti. Hackers who have been spying on businesses all over the world for\n\nyears. A group, presumably China-based, has honed in on Germany and its DAX corporations.\n\nFor the �rst time ever, BR and NDR reporters have successfully analyzed hundreds of the mal\nware versions used for that unsavory purpose. The targets: At least six DAX corporations, the\n\n\n-----\n\nWinnti is a highly complex structure that is di�cult to penetrate. The term denotes both a so\nphisticated malware and an actual group of hackers. IT security experts like to call them digital\n\nmercenaries. Since at least 2011, these hackers have been using malware to spy on corporate\n\nnetworks. Their mode of operation: to collect information on the organizational charts of com\npanies, on cooperating departments, on the IT systems of individual business units, and on\n\ntrade secrets, obviously.\n\nAsked about the group an IT security expert who has been analyzing the attacks for years\n\nreplies, tongue in cheek: “Any DAX corporation that hasn’t been attacked by Winnti must have\n\ndone something wrong.” A high-ranking German o�cial says: “The numbers of cases are mind\nboggling.” And claims that the group continues to be highly active—to this very day. The o�\ncial’s name will remain undisclosed, as will names of the more than 30 people whom we were\n\nable to interview for this article: Company sta�, IT security experts, government o�cials, and\n\nrepresentatives of security authorities. They are either not willing or not allowed to speak\n\nfrankly. But they are allowed to reveal some of their tactics.\n\nThis allows us to �nd the software and to �gure out for ourselves how the attackers work.\n\nThanks to the help received from the informers, we, the reporters, are able to get on to the\n\ngroup. Part of their trail is the following code: daa0 c7cb f4f0 fbcf d6d1 .\n\nModern-day espionage operations have one big advantage: Instead of painstakingly planting\n\nagents in companies, digital spies are simply sending prepared emails. Instead of taking pic\ntures of con�dential documents while the rest of the sta� is out to lunch, hackers can remotely\n\nlog on to company computers and send their commands from their keyboard. But every hack\ning operation also comes with a huge drawback. It leaves digital traces. If you notice hackers,\n\nyou can log their every step. The hackers themselves have no clue that they are under meticu\nlous scrutiny, sometimes even for months at a time.\n\n **Logging: The hackers’ individual steps are stored in log �les.**\n\nTo decipher the traces of hackers, you need to take a closer look at the program code of the\n\nmalware itself. It can be found in databases operated by private companies like “Virustotal.”\n\nThe company is owned by Google and is a kind of malware search engine. The information\n\nstored in that database is so valuable to IT consultants and security companies that they pay\n\nthousands of Euros per month for accessing it. Anybody who is unsure whether a mail attach\nment contains a Trojan can have it checked in that database by more than 50 antivirus pro\ngrams. In return, Virustotal stores the �le with the aid of a digital �ngerprint. This digital �nger\nprint allows others to search for the �le and to analyze the codes it contains. People like\n\nourselves.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### C:\\Windows\\system32\\\n wbem\\system.dat\n\n\n##### 3047 ed57 acac 30c2 327e 7407 0b38 64b7\n\n\nEvery �le has a digital �ngerprint—which makes is clearly identi�able.\n\nIn former times, it was solely the job of intelligence agencies to uncover espionage operations.\n\nNowadays, corporations and IT security companies prefer to employ sta� earning six-�gure\n\nsalaries for that purpose. Their job is to search the corporate networks and Virustotal for evi\ndence of hacker groups. After all, it is the companies they work for which are being spied on—\n\nand the companies’ secret formulas and building plans warrant absolute protection. Profes\nsionally, these employees are on a par with the security services. It is one of those profession\nals who meets with us and hands us a piece of paper.\n\n“This might help you �nd the hackers”, the gentleman tells us. He believes that because they\n\nare spying on so many targets at the same time, they have to �gure out how to keep track. He\n\nalso believes that the hackers chose convenience over anonymity. We soon realize how incred\nibly negligent the hackers are. We are working with [Moritz Contag, an IT security expert a�liat-](https://www.syssec.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/chair/staff/mcontag/)\n\ned with Ruhr University Bochum (RUB). What we �nd: The hackers are writing the names of the\n\ncompanies they want to spy on directly into their malware. Contag has analyzed more than\n\n250 variations of the Winnti malware and found them to contain the names of global\n\ncorporations.\n\nHackers usually take precautions, which experts refer to as Opsec. The Winnti group’s Opsec\n\nwas dismal to say the least. Somebody who has been keeping an eye on Chinese hackers on\n\nbehalf of a European intelligence service believes that they didn’t really care: “These hackers\n\ndon’t care if they’re found out or not. They care only about achieving their goals.\"\n\n **Opsec: Operational Security. It is a collective term for all the steps taken by hackers to cover their tracks.**\n\nThe sheet of paper the sta� member is showing us has a code printed on it: daa0 c7cb\n\nf4f0 fbcf d6d1 . We are looking for the same string of characters in Virustotal, the gigantic\n\ndatabase of infected �les.

This is the data stream in which Winnti hackers are hiding their commands.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n#### Phase 1: Cybercrime\n\nIt would seem that during the early stages, the hackers were concerned mainly about making\n\nmoney. Gameforge is a case in point: a gaming company based in the German town of Karls\nruhe. During its heyday, the company had a sta� of 700 working hard at conquering the global\n\ngaming market, and boasted annual sales to the tune of 140 million Euros. Gameforge o�ers\n\nso-called “freemium” games. While playing the games is free, those who want more either have\n\nto earn virtual money by completing certain tasks, which takes a long time, or shell out real\n\nmoney.\n\nWe are told that in 2011, an email message found its way into Gameforge’s mailbox in Karls\nruhe. A sta� member opened the attached �le and unbeknownst to him started the hackers’\n\nWinnti program. Shortly afterwards, a few players became virtual rich persons.\n\n\n-----\n\nes and raising the account balance. They started getting worried. How could this be happen\ning? The technicians used the next maintenance interval to reinstall the servers of the a�ected\n\ngame. The players didn’t have a clue about what’s going on. No sooner were the servers back\n\nup than the manipulations continued.\n\nGameforge decided to implement Kaspersky antivirus software, which didn't cause any alarm\n\nbells to ring. Gameforge arranged for Kaspersky's IT security experts to come directly to Karls\nruhe. Because obviously there was something weird going on. Nobody thought to inform the\n\nState Bureau of Criminal Investigation or the local police. The year was 2011, and many investi\ngators were barely familiar with the term or concept of cybercrime.\n\nWhile keeping an eye on Gameforge’s corporate network, the IT security experts did �nd suspi\ncious �les and decided to analyze them. They noticed that the system had in fact been in�ltrat\ned by hackers—who were acting like Gameforge’s administrators most of the time. Which al\nlowed them to remain invisible. It turned out that the hackers have taken over a total of 40\n\nservers.\n\nThis mode of operation is typical of many hacker groups—and especially of Winnti. “They are a\n\nvery, very persistente group,” says Costin Raiu, who has been watching Winnti since 2011. Raiu\n\nis in charge of Kaspersky’s malware analysis team. “Once the Winnti hackers are inside a net\nwork, they take their sweet time to really get a feel for the infrastructure,” he says.\n\n\n-----\n\nplacing their malware. They keep tabs on which programs are used in a company and then ex\nchange a �le in one of these programs. The modi�ed �le looks like the original, but was secretly\n\nsupplemented by a few extra lines of code. From now on, this manipulated �le does the attack\ners’ bidding.\n\n**Winnti is very speci�c to Germany. It is the attacker group**\n\n**that's being encountered most frequently.**\n\n# “\nAnonymous government o�cial\n\n\nRaiu and his team have followed the digital tracks left behind by some of the Winnti hackers.\n\n“Nine years ago, things were much more clear-cut. There was a single team, which developed\n\nand used Winnti. It now looks like there is at least a second group that also uses Winnti.” This\n\nview is shared by many IT security companies. And it is this second group which is getting the\n\nGerman security authorities so worried. One government o�cial puts it very matter-of-factly:\n\n“Winnti is very speci�c to Germany. It is the attacker group that's being encountered most\n\nfrequently.\"\n\n#### Phase 2: Industrial espionage\n\nBy 2014, the Winnti malware code was no longer limited to game manufacturers. The second\n\ngroup’s job is mainly industrial espionage. Hackers are targeting high-tech companies as well\n\nas chemical and pharmaceutical companies. We �nd evidence going as far as mid-2019. Cases\n\nof espionage which were probably still ongoing when we discovered them. Winnti is attacking\n\ncompanies in Japan, France, the U.S. and Germany. Or more precisely: in Düsseldorf.\n\nMost people probably know the DAX company Henkel as a manufacturer of detergents and\n\nshampoos. But Henkel o�ers a huge range of other products, including adhesives for industrial\n\napplications. Modern cars are glued instead of welded. [In a commercial on Youtube, Henkel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bSjVFawpqs)\n\nshows sta� members successfully joining two metal plates with just three grams of adhesive\n\nand then using the plates to pull a 280-ton train. Nearly half of Henkel’s annual sales of 20 bil\nlion Euros are generated by Henkel’s so-called “adhesive technologies\".\n\nThe Winnti hackers broke into Henkel’s network in 2014. We have three �les showing that this\n\nhappened. Each of these �les contains the same website belonging to Henkel and the name of\n\nthe hacked server. For example, one starts with the letter sequence DEDUSSV. We realize that\n\nserver names can be arbitrary but it is highly probable that DE stands for Germany and DUS\n\n\n-----\n\ntor all activities running on the web server. And they also seemed to be able to reach systems\n\nwhich didn't have direct internet access: Internal storage �les and possibly even the intranet.\n\nThe corporation con�rms the Winnti incident and issues the following statement: “The cyberat\ntack was discovered in the summer of 2014 and Henkel promptly took all necessary precau\ntions.” Henkel claims that a “very small portion” of its worldwide IT systems had been a�ected\n\n— the systems in Germany. According to Henkel, there was no evidence suggesting that any\n\nsensitive data had been diverted.\n\n#### How we worked\n\nBR and NDR reporters, in collaboration with several IT security experts, have analyzed\n\nthe Winnti malware. It was notably Moritz Contag of Ruhr University Bochum who man\naged to extract information from di�erent varieties of the malware. Contag wrote a\n\nscript for this analysis. Silas Cutler, an IT security expert with US-based Chronicle Securi\nty, has con�rmed Contag’s analyses.\n\nA collaboration between and\n\nFar from attacking Henkel and the other companies arbitrarily, Winnti takes a highly strategic\n\napproach. Which is perfectly evident from the other cases. Take Covestro, for example, also a\n\nmanufacturer of adhesives, lacquers and paints. This chemical corporation, a Bayer spin-o�, is\n\nnow listed on the DAX. Covestro is regarded as Germany’s most successful spin-o� in the re\ncent past. Up until June 2019, they had at least two systems on which the Winnti malware had\n\nbeen installed. Although there is no concrete evidence of data loss, Covestro considers “this\n\nevidence of infection to be a serious attack on our company.” Another manufacturer of adhe\nsives, Bostik of France, was infected with Winnti in early 2019.\n\nThe hackers behind Winnti have also set their sights on Japan’s biggest chemical company,\n\nShin-Etsu Chemical. We have in our hands several varieties of the 2015 malware which was\n\nmost likely used for the attack. In the case of another Japanese company, Sumitomo Electric,\n\nWinnti apparently penetrated their networks during the summer of 2016. And consider Roche,\n\none of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world: the sheer number of �les, 25 in to\ntal, gives you an idea of the degree of network penetration by the hackers. Winnti hackers also\n\n\n-----\n\ndata.\n\nA BASF spokeswoman tells us in an email that in July 2015, hackers had successfully overcome\n\n“the �rst levels” of defense. “When our experts discovered that the attacker was attempting to\n\nget around the next level of defense, the attacker was removed promptly and in a coordinated\n\nmanner from BASF’s network.” She added that no business relevant information had been lost\n\nat any time. According to Siemens, they were penetrated by the hackers in June 2016. “We\n\nquickly discovered and thwarted the attack,” Siemens told us in a written reply. Siemens claims\n\nthat even after detailed analyses, no evidence suggesting data loss from the attack has been\n\nfound to date.\n\n\n#### Targeted companies\n\n**Gaming: Gameforge, Valve**\n### \n\n**Software: Teamviewer**\n### \n\n**Technology: Siemens, Sumitomo, Thyssenkrupp**\n### \n\n**Pharma: Bayer, Roche**\n### \n\n**Chemical: BASF, Covestro, Shin-Etsu**\n### \n\n\nBostik, Sumitomo and Shin-Etsu didn’t respond to our requests for comments at all. Roche\n\nchose to keep their response neutral. A spokesperson replied that “information security and\n\ndata protection are taken very seriously.” Nearly all major corporations now emphasize that\n\nthere is no such thing as one hundred percent protection. Hacking attacks on large companies\n\nhave become almost commonplace. And yet: No company really likes to talk about having\n\nhackers in its own networks. In many cases, customers are not informed. They are justi�ably\n\nscared of damage to their reputation.\n\nTeamviewer is a case in point. A company based in the southwest of Germany, a bona �de Sili\ncon Valley contender, and a true showpiece enterprise. It was quickly traded at a nine-digit val\nuation, the highest accolade for a newly incorporated enterprise. Then came the Winnti hack\ners. [“Spiegel” magazine was the �rst to report about it.](https://www.spiegel.de/plus/teamviewer-wie-hacker-das-deutsche-vorzeige-start-up-ausspionierten-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000163955857)\n\nThe corporation o�ers a remote maintenance software solution which, according to Teamview\n\n-----\n\ndidn’t get that far for Teamviewer, the company assures us. They add that they replaced their\n\nentire IT infrastructure and spent millions on removing the hackers from their networks in\n\n2016.\n\n#### The second way to �nd Winnti\n\nFor the IT departments, the infected computers are extremely di�cult to detect. That is be\ncause a new variety of this malware remains perfectly passive as long as it is left alone. How\n\ncan you �nd something that’s playing dead? Since 2018 there’s a public tool available designed\n\nto systematically trawl the Internet for these infected systems. This network scan works by lur\ning the software out of its hiding spot.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nEach company has its own IP address range. The IP address is a computers unique ad\ndress. This is how computers can be reached via the Internet.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the Winnti malware has infected a computer, it initially behaves passively. Winnti is\n\nnow waiting for control commands.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the aid of special software we send requests to di�erent company networks. The\n\nsoftware per se is harmless, but capable of simulating control commands designed to lure\n\nWinnti out of hiding.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn all cases where Winnti was installed, the malware will respond to our request. This tells\n\nus: That company has been hacked.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis tool hit pay dirt at Covestro and Bostik. Many IT companies are taking the same route to\n\n�nd Winnti infected computers; some of the results have been leaked to us—in the strictest\n\ncon�dence. Thanks to this tool, we found out back in March 2019 that the Bayer pharmaceuti\ncal group had been hacked by Winnti.\n\n **Have you kept count? So far, ten companies have been a�ected, most of them in Germany.**\n\n\n-----\n\neleven—had been spied on by Winnti. In 2016, the corporation allowed a reporter from\n\n“Wirtschaftswoche” to watch the attackers being pushed back. The magazine later wrote of a\n\n[“six-month defensive battle.” The hackers had succeeded in extracting small data sets of im-](https://www.wiwo.de/my/technologie/digitale-welt/attacke-auf-thyssenkrupp-schon-2016-griff-winnti-an-exklusiver-report-aus-dem-auge-des-sturms/14949912.html)\n\nportance for the construction of plants. The company mentions “data fragments” and believes\n\nthat the hackers have missed their actual target, tapping into the corporation’s research\n\nresults.\n\n#### The trail leading to China\n\nAt Gameforge, the Winnti hackers had already been removed from the networks when a sta�\n\nmember noticed a Windows start screen with Chinese characters. Presumably, the hackers\n\nwere using tools in their native language, which would have made their work easier. But they\n\nforgot to cover up their tracks. Just another mistake they made, one of many.\n\nIn October 2016, several DAX corporations, including BASF and Bayer, founded the German\n\nCyber Security Organization (DCSO). The job of DCSO’s IT security experts is to observe and\n\nrecognize hacker groups like Winnti and to get to the bottom of their motives. In Winnti’s case,\n\nDCSO speaks of a “mercenary force” which is said to be closely linked with the Chinese govern\nment. They have been tracking the group for a long time: “We can, based on many, many indi\ncators, say with high con�dence that Winnti is being directed by the Chinese.”\n\n**We can, based on many, many indicators, say with high con-**\n\n**�dence that Winnti is being directed by the Chinese**\n\n# “\nDror-John Röcher, DCSO\n\n\nMany of the experts we talked to believe that the group is operating out of mainland China. “I\n\ndon’t care if the hackers work in green uniforms or are commissioned by people wearing green\n\nuniforms,” says an IT security expert, alluding to a suspected proximity to the country’s military\n\nintelligence service.\n\nIt would seem that in the early days, Winnti hackers were still quite careless. One of them left\n\nmany traces on the Internet. In 2013, the Kaspersky team was able to follow clues in their\n\ncode. This is how Costin Raiu and his colleagues came across a person using the alias\n\n“Mer4en7y.” This individual was active in hacker forums where he commented in Chinese on a\n\njob o�er for recruiting hackers. There was mention of a “powerful background.” “And\n\n\n-----\n\nwork,” says Raiu.\n\nOn 30 October 2018, [the US government brought charges against ten Chinese nationals. Two](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-intelligence-officers-and-their-recruited-hackers-and-insiders-conspired-steal)\n\nof them are believed to be working for one of China’s intelligence services. Hackers are\n\ncharged with spying on a manufacturer of gas turbines. Also charged in connection with the\n\ncrime: “Mer4en7y”, who is believed to have been acting on behalf of the intelligence service\n\nand to have used the Winnti software for the hack. IT security experts attribute the cyberattack\n\nto a di�erent Chinese group. But the charges �led are testimony to the close links between at\n\nleast one Winnti hacker and the government.\n\nThe US government is accusing the individual going by the alias Mer4en7y of using the Winnti\n\nsoftware\n\nJanka Oertel of the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) in Berlin has been keep\ning a close eye on China. Oertel considers it “very unlikely that large-scale cyber operations\n\ncould be happening without at least parts of the Chinese party-state knowing about them.”\n\nOertel, a political scientist, emphasizes that China wants to play a “signi�cant market role” in\n\nkey industries such as materials research by 2025 and to dominate the world market by 2035.\n\n“In some of these areas, however, China has not yet managed to achieve its goals without tech\nnology transfers—including transfers from Germany,” Oertel adds.\n\nA government o�cial familiar with the hacking cases agrees: “Cyber incidents allow us to draw\n\nconclusions as to a nation’s true priorities.” The point, he believes, is to understand one’s own\n\n\n-----\n\nthen procured by hacking operations.\n\nBut a former sta�er of a European intelligence agency warns: “If I wanted to hack anyone right\n\nnow, I’d make it look like a Chinese group.” He warns against underestimating the pro�ciency of\n\nhackers working for governments. After all, he says, laying false trails is their job.\n\nPeople working for the German intelligence agencies tell us that, although all current �ndings\n\nsuggest that Winnti originates from China, much of the evidence is based on data that is sever\nal years old. “We have a knowledge gap for the past two to three years,” says one individual fa\nmiliar with the incidents.”\n\n**If I wanted to hack anyone right now, I’d make it look exact-**\n\n**ly like a Chinese group.**\n\n# “\nFormer sta�er of a European intelligence agency\n\n\nWhile Germany does address industrial espionage in direct talks with the Chinese leadership,\n\nthese attempts are considered a waste of time. “Fruitless,” says one individual who knows how\n\nthese meetings work. The other side denies everything, he says, and what’s left at the end of\n\nthe day are meaningless declarations of intent. And the Germans are hesitant to provide con\ncrete evidence—for fear of revealing to the Chinese leadership what they know— for example,\n\nfrom the work of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe BND is trawling the internet for speci�c groups of attackers. The agency received 300 mil\nlion Euros to set up a powerful surveillance system, among other things. The idea is to �nd\n\nhacker groups suspected of being government backed and likely to cause damage to the Fed\neral Republic. There is also talk of starting an “intelligence o�ensive” against Chinese groups of\n\nattackers. This means: Hacking into the networks. Spies watching spies.\n\n#### Political espionage?\n\nCorporations like Bayer, Covestro, Roche and Bostik share a single common denominator: the\n\nchemical sector. However, analyses also show that a number of targets now a�ected are devi\nating from the known pattern. We are talking about the possibility of political espionage. We\n\nhave come across several indicators corroborating this suspicion.\n\nThe Hong Kong government was spied on by the Winnti hackers. We found four infected sys\ntems thanks to the network scan, and proceeded to inform the government by email. They\n\ncon�rm our �ndings: “Recently, it was found that six Internet facing computers of two govern\nment departments returned positive results from a test for Winnti malware.” The a�ected com\nputers did not contain any classi�ed information or citizens’ personal data, and there was “no\n\nevidence” that any data have been copied out, we are being told.\n\nThe network scan also sni�s out a telecommunications provider from India, which happens to\n\nbe located precisely in the region where the Tibetan government in exile (the “Central Tibetan\n\nAdministration”) has its headquarters. Incidentally, the relevant identi�er in the malware is\n\ncalled “CTA.” A �le which ended up on Virustotal in 2018 contained a pretty straightforward\n\nkeyword: “tibet”. The CTA didn’t respond to our requests for comment.\n\nOn top of this there are campaigns which don’t seem to make a lot of sense unless you consid\ner political espionage. Take Marriott, the hotel chain based in Maryland, USA. The corporation\n\nmanages more than one million rooms worldwide. While Marriott hotels may be state-of-the\nart, who would want to hack Marriott for cutting-edge technologies or innovative ideas? Who\n\nwould want to spy on the Indonesian airline Lion Air for the same reasons? Probably nobody.\n\nBut hotels and airlines collect data. If you know how to access these data, you know where\n\npeople travel and where they spend the night. And if you also hack into telecommunications\n\ncompanies you know where these people are located at any given time. The Winnti hackers\n\nmanaged to penetrate the networks of Lion Air and several telecommunications companies,\n\nand they at least did take Marriott into their sights.

If required, a�ect\ned companies can request “appropriate advice and assistance for cleaning up their systems\n\nand further prevention.” In July 2019 the Federal O�ce for Information Security reached out to\n\na company, whose name was included in a Winnti implant. We were told that “generally speak\ning foreign intelligence agencies have established cyberattacks as a vital mode of acquiring\n\nmore information.” According to the government, these hackers usually don’t have to fear polit\nical or economical risks, “due to various obfuscation methods.\"\n\nThe German government’s response is elusive, when asked whether there is a connection be\ntween the Winnti hackers and the Chinese Government. They tell us that cyberattacks are tak\nen seriously, no matter who is responsible. We reached out to the Foreign Ministry of China\n\nand the embassy in Berlin with this and other questions. We didn't hear back.\n\n#### Related stories (in German):\n\n\n**Tagesschau.de: Industriespionage: Mehrere Dax-Firmen von Hackerangri�**\nbetro�en\n\n\n-----\n\n**Der Funkstreifzug: Hackerangri�e auf deutsche Dax-Unternehmen**\n\n\n**Plusminus: Deutsche Unternehmen stärker im Visier von Industriespionen (Mai**\n2019).\n\n\n-----\n\n“Winnti: Attacking the Heart of the German Industry” is a joint investigation by Bayerischer\n\n[Rundfunk (BR Recherche/BR Data) and Norddeutscher Rundfunk.](https://br.de/recherche)\n\nPublished on 24 July 2019\n\n**Reporters: Hakan Tanriverdi, Maximilian Zierer, Rebecca Ciesielski (BR), Svea Eckert, Jan Lukas**\n\nStrozyk (NDR)\n\n**Contributing: Maximilian Richt (BR)**\n\n**Editors: Uli Köppen, Verena Nierle, Robert Schö�el**\n\n**Illustrations: Anna Hunger**\n\n**Digital design: Ste�en Kühne**\n\n[Impressum |](https://www.br.de/unternehmen/service/impressum/index.html) [Datenschutz |](https://www.br.de/unternehmen/service/impressum/impressum-datenschutzerklaerung-unternehmen100.html) [Bayerischer Rundfunk 2019](https://www.br.de/)\n\n\n-----",
