MFA, particularly for remote desktop access,\ncan help prevent account takeovers. With Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as one of the most\ncommon infection vector for ransomware, MFA is a critical tool in mitigating malicious cyber\nactivity. Do not exclude any user, particularly adminstrators, from an MFA requirement.\nIncorrectly applied privileges or permissions and errors within access control lists. These\nmistakes can prevent the enforcement of access control rules and could allow unauthorized users\nor system processes to be granted access to objects.\nSoftware is not up to date. Unpatched software may allow an attacker to exploit publicly known\nvulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive information, launch a denial-of-service attack, or take\ncontrol of a system. This is one of the most commonly found poor security practices.\nUse of vendor-supplied default configurations or default login usernames and passwords.\nMany software and hardware products come “out of the box” with overly permissive factorydefault configurations intended to make the products user-friendly and reduce the troubleshooting\ntime for customer service. However, leaving these factory default configurations enabled after\ninstallation may provide avenues for an attacker to exploit. Network devices are also often preconfigured with default administrator usernames and passwords to simplify setup. These default\ncredentials are not secure—they may be physically labeled on the device or even readily available\non the internet. Leaving these credentials unchanged creates opportunities for malicious activity,\nincluding gaining unauthorized access to information and installing malicious software. Network\ndefenders should also be aware that the same considerations apply for extra software options,\nwhich may come with preconfigured default settings.\nRemote services, such as a virtual private network (VPN), lack sufficient controls to\nprevent unauthorized access. During recent years, malicious threat actors have been observed\ntargeting remote services. Network defenders can reduce the risk of remote service compromise\nby adding access control mechanisms, such as enforcing MFA, implementing a boundary firewall\nin front of a VPN, and leveraging intrusion detection system/intrusion prevention system sensors\nto detect anomalous network activity.\nStrong password policies are not implemented. Malicious cyber actors can use a myriad of\nmethods to exploit weak, leaked, or compromised passwords and gain unauthorized access to a\nvictim system. Malicious cyber actors have used this technique in various nefarious acts and\nprominently in attacks targeting RDP.\nCloud services are unprotected. Misconfigured cloud services are common targets for cyber\nactors. Poor configurations can allow for sensitive data theft and even cryptojacking.\nOpen ports and misconfigured services are exposed to the internet. This is one of the most\ncommon vulnerability findings. Cyber actors use scanning tools to detect open ports and often use\nthem as an initial attack vector. Successful compromise of a service on a host could enable\nmalicious cyber actors to gain initial access and use other tactics and procedures to compromise\nexposed and vulnerable entities. RDP, Server Message Block (SMB), Telnet, and NetBIOS are\nhigh-risk services.\n\nPage 2 of 7 | Product ID: AA22-137A\nTLP: WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-137A\n\n•\n\n•\n\nFailure to detect or block phishing attempts. Cyber actors send emails with malicious\nmacros—primarily in Microsoft Word documents or Excel files—to infect computer systems. Initial\ninfection can occur in a variety of ways, such as when a user opens or clicks a malicious\ndownload link, PDF, or macro-enabled Microsoft Word document included in phishing emails.\nPoor endpoint detection and response. Cyber actors use obfuscated malicious scripts and\nPowerShell attacks to bypass endpoint security controls and launch attacks on target devices.\nThese techniques can be difficult to detect and protect against.\n\nMITIGATIONS\nApplying the following practices can help organizations strengthen their network defenses against\ncommon exploited weak security controls and practices.\n\nControl Access\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nAdopt a zero-trust security model that eliminates implicit trust in any one element, node, or\nservice, and instead requires continuous verification of the operational picture via real-time\ninformation from multiple sources to determine access and other system responses.[9],[10] Zerotrust architecture enables granular privilege access management and can allow users to be\nassigned only the rights required to perform their assigned tasks.\nLimit the ability of a local administrator account to log in from a remote session (e.g., deny\naccess to this computer from the network) and prevent access via an RDP session. Additionally,\nuse dedicated administrative workstations for privileged user sessions to help limit exposure to all\nthe threats associated with device or user compromise.\nControl who has access to your data and services. Give personnel access only to the data,\nrights, and systems they need to perform their job. This role-based access control, also known as\nthe principle of least priviledge, should apply to both accounts and physical access. If a malicious\ncyber actor gains access, access control can limit the actions malicious actors can take and can\nreduce the impact of misconfigurations and user errors. Network defenders should also use this\nrole-based access control to limit the access of service, machine, and functional accounts, as well\nas the use of management privileges, to what is necessary. Consider the following when\nimplementing access control models:\no Ensure that access to data and services is specifically tailored to each user, with\neach employee having their own user account.\no Give employees access only to the resources needed to perform their tasks.\no Change default passwords of equipment and systems upon installation or\ncommissioning.\no Ensure there are processes in place for the entry, exit, and internal movement of\nemployees. Delete unused accounts, and immediately remove access to data and\nsystems from accounts of exiting employees who no longer require access. Deactivate\nservice accounts, and activate them only when maintenance is performed.[11]\nHarden conditional access policies. Review and optimize VPN and access control rules to\nmanage how users connect to the network and cloud services.\n\nPage 3 of 7 | Product ID: AA22-137A\nTLP: WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-137A\n\n•\n\nVerify that all machines, including cloud-based virtual machine instances do not have open\nRDP ports. Place any system with an open RDP port behind a firewall and require users to use a\nVPN to access it through the firewall.[12]\n\nImplement Credential Hardening\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nImplement MFA. In particular, apply MFA on all VPN connections, external-facing services, and\nprivileged accounts. Require phishing-resistant MFA (such as security keys or PIV cards) for\ncritical services. Where MFA is not implemented, enforce a strong password policy alongside\nother attribute-based information, such as device information, time of access, user history, and\ngeolocation data. See NSA’s Cybersecurity Information on Selecting Secure Multi-factor\nAuthentication Solutions, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Special\nPublication 800-63B – Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management, and\nCCCS’s Information Technology Security Guidance – User Authentication Guidance for\nInformation Technology Systems for additional steps to take to enable in-depth authentication\nsecurity.\nChange or disable vendor-supplied default usernames and passwords. Enforce the use of\nstrong passwords. (See guidance from NIST.)\nSet up monitoring to detect the use of compromised credentials on your systems.\nImplement controls to prevent the use of compromised or weak passwords on your network.\n\nEstablish Centralized Log Management\n•\n\nEnsure that each application and system generates sufficient log information. Log files play\na key role in detecting attacks and dealing with incidents. By implementing robust log collection\nand retention, organizations are able to have sufficient information to investigate incidents and\ndetect threat actor behavior. Consider the following when implementing log collection and\nretention:\no Determine which log files are required. These files can pertain to system logging,\nnetwork logging, application logging, and cloud logging.\no Set up alerts where necessary. These should include notifications of suspicious login\nattempts based on an analysis of log files.\no Ensure that your systems store log files in a usable file format, and that the recorded\ntimestamps are accurate and set to the correct time zone.\no Forward logs off local systems to a centralized repository or security information\nand event management (SIEM) tools. Robustly protect SIEM tools with strong account\nand architectural safeguards.\no Make a decision regarding the retention period of log files. If you keep log files for a\nlong time, you can refer to them to determine facts long after incidents occur. On the other\nhand, log files may contain privacy-sensitive information and take up storage space. Limit\naccess to log files and store them in a separate network segment. An incident\ninvestigation will be nearly impossible if attackers have been able to modify or delete the\nlogfiles.[13]\n\nPage 4 of 7 | Product ID: AA22-137A\nTLP: WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-137A\n\nEmploy Antivirus Programs\n•\n•\n\nDeploy an anti-malware solution on workstations to prevent spyware, adware, and malware as\npart of the operating system security baseline.\nMonitor antivirus scan results on a routine basis.\n\nEmploy Detection Tools and Search for Vulnerabilities\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nImplement endpoint and detection response tools. These tools allow a high degree of visibility\ninto the security status of endpoints and can help effectively protect against malicious cyber\nactors.\nEmploy an intrusion detection system or intrusion prevention system to protect network and\non-premises devices from malicious activity. Use signatures to help detect malicious network\nactivity associated with known threat activity.\nConduct penetration testing to identify misconfigurations. See the Additional Resources\nsection below for more information about CISA’s free cyber hygiene services, including remote\npenetration testing.\nConduct vulnerability scanning to detect and address application vulnerabilities.\nUse cloud service provider tools to detect overshared cloud storage and monitor for\nabnormal accesses.\n\nMaintain Rigorous Configuration Management Programs\n•\n\nAlways operate services exposed on internet-accessible hosts with secure configurations.\nNever enable external access without compensating controls such as boundary firewalls and\nsegmentation from other more secure and internal hosts like domain controllers. Continuously\nassess the business and mission need of internet-facing services. Follow best practices for\nsecurity configurations, especially blocking macros in documents from the internet.[14]\n\nInitiate a Software and Patch Management Program\n•\n\nImplement asset and patch management processes to keep software up to date. Identify and\nmitigate unsupported, end-of-life, and unpatched software and firmware by performing\nvulnerability scanning and patching activities. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n•\n•\n\nNCSC-UK Guidance – Phishing Attacks: Defending Your Organisation\nOpen Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Proactive Controls: Enforce Access\nControls\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n[2] United States Federal Bureau of Investigation\nPage 5 of 7 | Product ID: AA22-137A\nTLP: WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-137A\n\n[3] United States National Security Agency\n[4] Canadian Centre for Cyber Security\n[5] New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre\n[6] New Zealand CERT NZ\n[7] Netherlands National Cyber Security Centre\n[8] United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre\n[9] White House Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity\n[10] NCSC-NL Factsheet: Prepare for Zero Trust\n[11] NCSC-NL Guide to Cyber Security Measures\n[12] N-able Blog: Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Signature vs. Anomaly-Based\n[13] NCSC-NL Guide to Cyber Security Measures\n[14] National Institute of Standards and Technology SP 800-123 – Keeping Servers Secured\n\nCONTACT\nU.S. organizations: To report incidents and anomalous activity or to request incident response\nresources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at report@cisa.gov.
