The following is information that I’ve compiled\nusing freely available Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) information collection\nmethods.\n\n[1. Chinese-attributed APT 10 (a.k.a., “Red Apollo,” “CVNX,” “Stone Panda,” “MenuPass,”](https://www.wired.com/story/doj-indictment-chinese-hackers-apt10/)\n\n_“HOGFISH,” “POTASSIUM”) has been focusing on compromising Managed Service_\nProviders (MSP), you know the companies you pay to manage your IT services\nthat have likely have some level of privileged access into your networks. Of\ncourse, it is not difficult to understand why they are targeting MSPs. If you can\ncompromise an MSP, well just imagine all of the privileged accesses to different\norganization’s networks you will have.\n\n\n-----\n\n“Godkiller” and “Atreexp;” the 2 APT 10 Chinese nationals [indicted by the U.S. DoJ](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n\n“The indictment alleges, among other things, that by hacking into a single New York-based\nMSP, APT10 was able to compromise data from companies in a dozen countries [and 45 tech\ncompanies], from Brazil to the United Arab Emirates. With a single initial intrusion, Chinese\nspies could leapfrog to industries as varied as banking and finance, biotech, consumer\nelectronics, health care, manufacturing, oil and gas, telecommunications, and more.” ~Brian\nBarrett, Wired 12.20.18\n\nChina has been involved with over 90% of computer network espionage (CNE) cases in\nthe U.S. over the last decade or so. APT 10’s entry point into the MSP has been linked\nto a simple phishing email titled “C17 Antenna problems” that contained a malicious\nMS Word document called “12–204 Side Load Testing.” APT 10 is alleged to have stolen\n“hundreds of gigabytes” of sensitive data including tech and space and satellite\ntechnologies. APT 10 has over 1,300 unique domains registered to this CNE campaign\nand is known to use the QuasarRAT, PlugX, and RedLeaves malware among many\n[others. For more information on APT 10, check out their MITRE ATT&CK page.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/)\n\n[Considering the fact that China just landed their “Yutu 2” rover on the far side of the](https://www.space.com/42914-china-far-side-moon-landing-crewed-lunar-plans.html)\nmoon as of 2 Jan 2019, it serves to demonstrate how China’s massive CNE campaigns\nover the last two decades have leapfrogged the country into becoming a formidable\nthreat to other nuclear superpowers like the U.S. and Russia economically and\nmilitarily.\n\n2. New information released in the massive Marriott hotel Starwood reservation\nsystem data breach of over 500 million guests (later amended to 383 million after\nduplicates were discovered) now includes 5 million passports that were left\nunencrypted that were accessed over a 4-year hacking campaign attributed to Chinese\nhackers dating back to 2014. Which Chinese APT is involved is not evident or publicly\nknown at this point, but the attackers are suspected of working on behalf of China’s\nMinistry of State Security This particular interested is further complicated that Marriott\n\n\n-----\n\nacquisition that wasn’t discovered for another 2 years when Marriott noticed that\nsomeone was attempted to remove data from their systems.\n\n[Credit: Picture Joliet](http:/)\n\n[3. China’s Strategic Support Force (SSF) of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/china-behind-massive-diplomatic-cyberespionage-campaign/)\nattributed to a massive diplomatic cyber espionage campaign against the European\nUnion (EU) and more than 100 organizations that was conducted over the last 3 years\nand which resulted in the interception of thousands of diplomatic cables (i.e.,\nmessages) containing sensitive and protected information.\n\n“Initial access to the network was gained using a phishing attack against network admins and\nsenior staff to steal their login credentials.”\n\nThough we all like to think that we’re smart enough not to fall for a phishing attack,\nthey continue to be an unremarkable but highly effective method of compromise for\nmany cybercriminals. So much so, in fact, that email has become incredibly risky for\nbusinesses, governments, and organizations of all shapes and sizes. SSF teams of\nhackers exfiltrated the data by chunking it into small segments of data and then\nsilently siphoning the data out of the network to public Cloud storage services. Of the\nEU data that was stolen and compromised, the list included the following types of data:\n\nCriminal Appeal Court\nForeign Affairs Ministers\nUnited Nations\nConsular Affairs\nNon-proliferation\nSecurity\nEuropean Council\nHuman Rights\n\n\n-----\n\n(a.k.a., “Energetic Bear,” or “Dragonfly 2.0”) group continue to probe U.S. critical\ninfrastructure in an effort to map it out and locate potential cyber vulnerabilities.\n_“Isotope” prefers to use a hacking strategy known as “living off the land” whereby they_\ntry to use only native tools on the hacked operating system (OS) as much as possible to\navoid raising intrusion suspicion. However, they still use custom-built backdoors to\nmaintain persistence. “Isotope” is likely part of the same Russian APT groups that have\ntargeted Ukrainian power grids over the last few years.\n\nIndustrial Control Systems (ICS) have been adhering to the North American Electric\nReliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) best practice\nstandards for network defense ever since 2003 in the aftermath of the Northeastern\nblackout which caused a cascade failure that left 50 million Americans and a Canadian\nprovince without electrical power for nearly 2 days. Many have attributed this power\noutage to a Chinese-based cyber attack, but the analysis was inconclusive and was\ninstead attributed to a number of different factors.\n\n\n-----\n\n[2003 Northeastern [U.S.] Blackout; Credit: Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/14/2003-northeast-blackout_n_3751171.html)\n\nSome of the NERC CIP network defense standards include two-factor authentication\n(2FA), segmenting networks with firewalls, using encryption on stored data, and strict\n\n\n-----\n\nsome are privately-owned. Government-managed critical infrastructure is required to\nadhere to strict NERC CIP and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nstandards, but privately-owned critical infrastructure organizations are not required to\nadhere to the same standards. Why this is even still an option in 2019 is a pretty big\nquestion? For a country such as the U.S. that is based on democracy and freedom,\nnational security has long been used by the federal government to trample individual\ncitizen Constitutional rights. However, it seems there is still disparity amongst what the\nfederal government can get away with against corporations with big law firms\nprotecting them and Joe Schmoe, the average U.S. citizen.\n\n_“Isotope’s” activity thus far appears to be more CNE intelligence gathering-related, but_\nthere are signs that, like China, the intelligence information being collected about U.S.\npower grids is being used to further Russia’s development of their own power grid\nsystem possibly to advance it and to learn new methods of hardening their own\ninfrastructure against potential cyber attacks. At the same time, of course, this same\ninformation can be used to target U.S. power grid cyber vulnerabilities whenever they\nchoose to do so. This type of ICS probing against U.S. Critical Infrastructure and Key\nResources (CIKR) is nothing new and has seen other nation-state threat actors like\nNorth Korea, China, and Iran involved in similar activities. It is safe to assume that the\nU.S. has been involved in similar CNE activity against all of its adversaries.\n\n5. A North Korea threat actor or APT group is thought to be the culprit behind a South\nKorean data breach involving 1,000 North Korean (NK) defectors. The malware (i.e., the\nspecific type of malware is unknown) was found on a North Gyeongsang state-run\ncenter computer leaked the information of the 1,000 NK defectors. Now, of course, the\nfamilies of those defectors still living in NK could possibly be in danger if the NK regime\nis able to successfully link the defector and their family members. Attribution of\nmalware origin and specific individuals is incredibly difficult, and NK have capitalized\non this as a form of international harassment, persuasion, and even as a form of\neconomic revenue.\n\n[6. The Shamoon disk wiper malware was used in an attack that disrupted Italian](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/shamoon-disk-wiper-attack-on-saipem-signals-new-affront-against-energy-sector-middle-east-interests/)\nenergy (oil and gas) contractor Saipem S.p.A. The attack affected roughly 400 servers\nwhich impacted the company’s operations globally in countries such as U.A.E., Saudi\nArabia, Kuwait, India, and Scotland. Thanks to a robust data backup system, the\ncompany didn’t lose any data but just imagine if it didn’t have a data backup in place.\nThings could’ve been a lot worse for the firm. However, operations are still affected\ncosting the company a lot of money while it has to reimage and restore data to\nhundreds of servers globally assuming the servers can be salvaged at all. Although not\nfor certain, Shamoon (a.k.a., Disttrack) is thought to be the work of the Iranian-based\nOilRig and Rocket Kitten APT groups as well as the Greenbug APT group.\n\n[7. Operation ‘Sharpshooter’ is a global phishing campaign thought to be linked to the](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/sharpshooter-cyberespionage-campaign-scopes-out-defense-critical-infrastructure-sectors/)\nNorth Korean-based Lazarus APT group. This phishing campaign uses fake job\nrecruitment documents targeting defense contractors, government, and critical\ninfrastructure organizations that contains a malicious “fully-functional modular\n\n\n-----\n\nattributed “Duuzer” malware. Similarities in the code, library (.dll) names, and dynamic\nApplication Programming Interface (API) exist between both “Rising Sun,” and “Duuzer”\nmaking attribution to the Lazarus APT likely. Forensic analysis has determined that the\nEnglish-written fake job recruiting documents were produced in a Korean-language\nenvironment. However, there is speculation that the obvious connection to the Lazarus\nAPT may be a false positive. Other skilled APTs can emulate each other’s code and may\nhave motivations to make attacks appear to originate from another region than their\nown. The fake job recruiting phishing documents are, of course, more MS Word\ndocuments (with malicious macros) that were stored in a Dropbox container. The\nmacro contained the malware dropper which then corrupted the MS Word application\nmemory and led to the second-stage exploit code.\n\n[As with the November 2018 APT Chronicles, that’s quite a bit of APT activity for one](https://medium.com/@z3roTrust/apt-chronicles-vol-11-2018-5ae3b0cda750)\nmonth. Realize also that there is CNE and CNA activity occurring that we may never\nlearn of due to the covert nature of cyber warfare. Be safe online and use basic\ninformation security best practices to avoid becoming a victim of data breaches.\nRemember though, there is very little you can do when you give your personal data to\na company and trust them to safely store it. Most organizations have no chance of\ndefending against an APT.\n\n\n-----",
