The tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) of this threat actor have a high overlap with a previous\n[voicemail campaign that ThreatLabz analyzed in July 2020.](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/new-voicemail-themed-phishing-attacks-use-evasion-techniques-and-steal-credentials)\n\nIn this new instance of the campaign, the threat actor has targeted users in US-based\norganizations in specific verticals including software security, US military, security solution\nproviders, healthcare / pharmaceutical, and the manufacturing supply chain.\n\nAs Zscaler was one of the targeted organizations, it gave us a good insight into the full\nattack chain and motives of this threat actor.\n\n## Key points\n\nVoicemail-themed phishing campaigns continue to be a successful social engineering\ntheme used by this threat actor to lure victims in opening a malicious attachment.\nMultiple key industry verticals in the US such as military, software security vendors,\nhealthcare, pharmaceuticals, and the manufacturing supply chain were targeted by\nthis threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe goal of the threat actor is to steal credentials of Office365 and Outlook accounts,\nboth of which are widely used in large enterprises.\nA CAPTCHA is used by the threat actor to guard the final credential phishing page\nfrom automated URL analysis algorithms.\nEach URL is specifically crafted for the targeted individual and the targeted\norganization.\nThe campaign is active at the time of publishing this report.\n\n## Attack chain\n\nThe attack flow involves a voicemail-themed notification email sent to the victim. The email\ncontains an HTML attachment which, when opened, will redirect the user to a credential\nphishing site. The goal of the threat actor is to harvest Office 365 credentials of the victim.\n\nWe will describe each component of the attack-chain in more detail in this report.\n\n## Attack chain [Technical analysis]\n\n### Email analysis\n\nThe email theme is focused on a voicemail notification that tells the victim they have a\nmissed voicemail, promting the user to open the HTML attachment. This social engineering\ntechnique has worked successfully for the threat actor in previous campaigns.\n\nFigure 1 shows an example of the email sent to the victim. The \"From\" field of the email\nwas crafted specifically to align with the targeted organization's name.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Voicemail-themed email sent to a user at Zscaler_\n\nAnalysis of the email headers shows that the threat actor leveraged email servers located in\nJapan. Figure 2 shows the headers for one of the emails.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Email header_\n\n_Figure 3: Mail server details_\n\n### HTML attachment analysis\n\nFor the purpose of analysis, we will consider the HTML attachment with the MD5 hash:\ndd0ddbc951de5cad9c8ace516c514693\n\nFigure 4 shows the HTML attachment sent in the email which contains encoded JavaScript.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: HTML attachment_\n\nFigure 5 shows the resulting code after deobfuscation.\n\n_Figure 5: Decoded JavaScript from the HTML attachment_\n\nThis code redirects the user to an attacker-controlled URL using window.location.replace()\n\n## URL analysis\n\n### [Stage-1 URL] - Redirector\n\nThe URL inside the HTML attachment is a redirector URL which redirects the user to the\nfinal credential phishing page.\n\nIn each instance of the attack, the URL followed a consistent format which included the\nname of the targeted organization as well as the email address of the targeted individual.\nFigure 6 below highlights the format.\n\n_Figure 6: Stage-1 URL format_\n\n\n-----\n\nFor instance, when an individual in Zscaler was targeted, the URL used the following\nformat:\n\nzscaler.zscaler.briccorp[.]com/<base64_encoded_email>\n\nSince the format of the URL gives away critical information about the target, we used that\ninformation from our collected telemetry to enumerate the list of targeted organizations and\nindividuals.\n\nBased on analysis of this telemetry, we can conclude with a high confidence level that the\ntargets chosen by the threat actor are organizations in the US military, security software\ndevelopers, security service providers, healthcare / pharmaceutical and supply-chain\norganizations in manufacturing and shipping.\n\nIt is important to note that if the URL does not contain the base64-encoded email at the\nend; it instead redirects the user to the Wikipedia page of MS Office or to office.com.\n\n### [Stage 2 URL] CAPTCHA check\n\nThe Stage 1 URL in the HTML attachment will redirect the user to the Stage 2 URL which\nrequires the user to solve a Captcha before presenting the actual Office credential phishing\npage.\n\nFor Captcha, it uses the Google reCAPTCHA technique. This helps the threat actor evade\nautomated URL analysis tools. A similar technique was used in the July 2020 instance of a\nvoicemail-themed campaign.\n\nFigure 7 and 8 show 2 examples of captcha displayed by the Stage 2 URLs.\n\n_Figure 7: Captcha displayed by the phishing page_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Captcha displayed by the phishing page_\n\n### [Stage 3 URL] - Credential phishing page\n\nOnce the user solves the Captcha successfully, they will be redirected to the final credential\nphishing page which attempts to steal the Office 365 credentials of the user as shown in\nFigure 9.\n\n_Figure 9: Actual credential phishing page of Office 365_\n\n## Zscaler’s detection status\n\nZscaler’s multilayered cloud security platform detects indicators at various levels, as seen\nhere:\n\n\n-----\n\n[HTML.Phish.Microsoft](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=HTML.Phish.Microsoft)\n[HTML.Phish.Office365](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=HTML.Phish.Office365)\n\n[HTML.Phish.Zscaler](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=HTML.Phish.Zscaler)\n\nFigure 10 shows the detection status of Zscaler's credential phishing detection system.\n\n_Figure 10: URL detection by Zscaler's credential phishing detection system_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVoicemail-themed phishing campaigns continue to be a successful social engineering\ntechnique for attackers since they are able to lure the victims to open the email\nattachments. This combined with the usage of evasion tactics to bypass automated URL\nanalysis solutions helps the threat actor achieve better success in stealing the users'\ncredentials.\n\nAs an extra precaution, users should not open attachments in emails sent from untrusted or\nunknown sources. As a best practice, in general, users should verify the URL in the address\nbar of the browser before entering any credentials.\n\nThe Zscaler ThreatLabz team will continue to monitor this campaign, as well as others, to\nhelp keep our customers safe.\n\n## Indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n\n# attacker-registered domains\n\nbriccorp[.]com\n\nbajafulfillrnent[.]com\n\nbpirninerals[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nlovitafood-tw[.]com\ndorrngroup[.]com\n\nlacotechs[.]com\n\nbrenthavenhg[.]com\n\nspasfetech[.]com\n\nmordematx[.]com\n\nantarnex[.]com\n\n\n-----",
