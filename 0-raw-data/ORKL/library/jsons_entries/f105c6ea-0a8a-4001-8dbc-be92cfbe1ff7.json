Subsequently, two additional articles (here and](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x3B.html) [here)](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x3D.html)\nwere released by Objective-See which provide an analysis of some validated WINDSHIFT samples targeting\nOSX systems. Pivoting on specific file attributes and infrastructure indicators, Unit 42 was able to identify and\ncorrelate additional attacker activity and can now provide specific details on a targeted WINDSHIFT attack as\nit unfolded at a Middle Eastern government agency.\n\n## Summary of Aggregated WINDSHIFT Attacker Activity\n\nThe following timeline summarizes validated WINDSHIFT activity through June of 2018.\n\n_Figure 1: Known WINDSHIFT activity across main disclosure sources._\n\nAs shown within the timeline above, the WINDSHIFT activity observed by Unit 42 falls between January and\nMay of 2018.\n\n## Middle Eastern Government Agency Attack Timeline\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following is a summary of observed WINDSHIFT activity which targeted a Middle Eastern government\nagency:\n\n_Figure 2: Unit 42 Observed WINDSHIFT samples._\n\nThe first attack occurred in early January of 2018 with an inbound WINDTAIL sample (the backdoor family\nused by WINDSHIFT) originating from the remote IP address 109.235.51[.]110 to a single internal IP address\nwithin the government agency. As per the timeline in Figure 2, at the time this event occurred, the IP address\n109.235.51[.]110 was associated with the domain flux2key[.]com, a known WINDSHIFT domain. Upon further\nanalysis, Unit 42 determined the sample’s corresponding C2 server IP address was 109.235.51[.]153. At the\ntime this event occurred, that IP was associated with the domain string2me[.]com, which is a known\nWINDSHIFT domain. While Unit 42 does not have any insight into the attempted infection methodology in this\ncase, the actor’s TTPs would suggest that spearphishing was almost certainly involved.\n\nAfter the initial infection attempt, several additional WINDTAIL samples from the same external IP address,\n109.235.51[.]110, were directed at the same internal IP address from January through May of 2018 (see\nFigure 2 for additional details). All related WINDTAIL samples were Mac OSX app bundles in zip archives,\nwhich is consistent with WINDSHIFT TTPS.\n\nOne sample in particular, named “mcworker.zip” (SHA256:\ne0fdcb5e0215f9fae485fbfcd615c79b85806827e461bca2e1c00c82e83281dc) deserves particular attention.\nUpon further analysis, Unit 42 determined its C2 server IP address was 185.25.50[.]189. According to OSINT,\nat the time of the activity, the IP address 185.25.50[.]189 had one domain resolution: domforworld[.]com.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing this attack in detail, Unit 42 was able to gain valuable insight into the real-world TTPs of a known\nthreat actor group. Of particular importance are the following findings:\n\nUnit 42 assesses with high confidence that both the IP address 185.25.50[.]189 and the domain\ndomforworld[.]com is associated with WINDSHIFT activity. Additionally, the IP addresses\n109.235.51[.]110 and 109.235.51[.]153, corresponding to the previously validated WINDSHIFT domains\nflux2key[.]com and string2me[.]com, respectively, were also observed in use during this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacker-owned IP address 109.235.50[.]191 was subsequently identified in a Norman Security\n[report from as being associated with Hangover threat actor activity, and both IP addresses](http://www.thecre.com/fnews/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Unveiling_an_Indian_Cyberattack_Infrastructure.pdf)\n109.235.51[.]110 and 109.235.50[.]191 shared the name “XENEUROPE” within their organizational\nregistrant WHOIS information. This organizational name is tied to a number of IP addresses of\nHangover-associated infrastructure as per the Norman report. Collectively, this evidence serves to\nstrengthen the implication from other security researchers that Operation Hangover and WINDSHIFT\nactivity are possibly related.\nBased on Unit 42’s observations of multiple inbound WINDTAIL samples directed at the same internal IP\naddress, Unit 42 assesses with moderate confidence that the attackers were not able to establish\npersistence within the targeted environment. While Unit 42 cannot definitively determine the attempted\ndelivery vector of these samples, WINDTAIL TTPs would indicate that it was likely standard\nspearphishing chicanery.\nOne of two of the Mac OSX developer certificates tied to the WINDTAIL samples shown in DarkMatter’s\noriginal presentation, Caren Van (4F9G49SUXB), was also tied to the WINDTAIL samples within this\nblog. Additionally, a newly identified certificate, warren portman (95RKE2AA8F), was found to be directly\naffiliated with WINDSHIFT malware.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\n\n[AutoFocus customers can track these samples with the Windshift tag.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Windshift)\nWildFire detects all files mentioned in this report with malicious verdicts.\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Infrastructure:\n\n**Domain** **IP Address**\n\nflux2key[.]com 109.235.51[.]110\n\nstring2me[.]com 109.235.51[.]153\n\ndomforworld[.]com 185.25.50[.]189\n\n### File Hashes:\n\n\n**File**\n**Name(s)**\n\n\n**Apple**\n**Developer**\n**Certificate**\n\n\ntrusted.zip Caren Van\n(4F9G49SUXB)\n\nmcworker.zip Caren Van\n(4F9G49SUXB)\n\nkeybaged.zip Caren Van\n(4F9G49SUXB)\n\ntrustb.zip Caren Van\n(4F9G49SUXB)\n\nfrd.zip Caren Van\n(4F9G49SUXB)\n\n\n**SHA-256**\n\nce8e01373499b539f4746c0e68c850357476abe36b12834f507f9ba19af3d4f9\n\ne0fdcb5e0215f9fae485fbfcd615c79b85806827e461bca2e1c00c82e83281dc\n\n1fbfbaefd50627796e7f16b8cc2b81ffbc5effcb33b64cc8e349e44b5d5d3ee8\n\n1de218e45cdf069c10d1a8735d82688b8964261a5efe3b6560e0fdcfa3c44c1d\n\ndd0e0883392ffe8c72c4b13f58e5861fc2f4bc518a6abea4f81ae3a44b2eda1c\n\n\n-----\n\nsmdd.zip Caren Van\n(4F9G49SUXB)\n\nlogd.zip Caren Van\n(4F9G49SUXB)\n\nlogd.zip Caren Van\n(4F9G49SUXB)\n\nlsd.zip Caren Van\n(4F9G49SUXB)\n\ntootoo.zip warren portman\n(95RKE2AA8F)\n\n\ne2a5663584727efa396c319f7f99a12205bb05c9c678ffae130e9f86667505a6\n\nffae55894f0f31d99105b5b7bbbca79e9c1019b37b7a5a20368f50c173352fd1\n\ncb3068ee887fc2f66d3df886421d5e5fa5e31ec4ee0079a7dcf9628bd2730de0\n\n0c0fce879c8ca00a6f9feeaccf6cba64374e508cacd664682e794a4a4cc64ffb\n\n8c8b53f4d4836bd7d4574fe80039caf9f2bd4d75740f2e8e22619064c830c6d9\n\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, in this report\nwith our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.
