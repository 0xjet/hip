The group has more than $14m confirmed payments in bitcoin and has several\n\nhigh-profile victims in its portfolio. The latter is verified by the publication of the exfiltrated\n\ndata of the victims who did not pay the requested ransom. Given the modus operandi of\n\nthe group, we managed to intercept many of their negotiations, which provided us with\n\nintelligence into how they operate. The studied interactions correspond to more than a\n\nthird of their earnings and are therefore quite indicative of how they work as a group.\n\nIndex terms— Ransomware, CONTI, cybercrime, blockchain forensics\n\n# Introduction\n\nCONTI is a ransomware that uses the double extortion model to force their victims to pay\n\nthe ransom. In essence, the attackers will not only lock up a victim's files by encrypting\n\nthem and demand ransom for their decryption, but they will also steal files and threaten\n\nto publish them on a website or otherwise leak them if their initial ransom request is not\n\nmet. This model is not novel, as it has been introduced by MAZE and then used in other\n\nransomware campaigns such as REvil, Ragnar, and Egregor, to name a few.\n\nThe group is being operated in the Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) model. Therefore,\n\nthere is a group of developers who have developed the ransomware and distribute it to\n\nsome affiliates that they recruit. These affiliates will use it once they penetrate a host.\n\nEach party keeps a share of the paid ransom, which are paid in some cryptocurrency.\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nThe confirmed earnings of the CONTI group, based on a specialised Open Source\n\nIntelligence (OSINT) source that tracks ransomware - ransomwhere[1], are currently\n\n$14,740,000. These earnings position CONTI among the most highly paid ransomware\n\noperation and due to the high impact on USA-based organisations \"caused\" the Federal\n\nBureau of Investigations (FBI) to issue a dedicated flash alert[2], with the Cybersecurity and\n\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also issuing a dedicated alert more recently[3]. In what\n\nfollows, we provide an insight into the transactions of more than a third (34.96%) of\n\nCONTI earnings. According to the dedicated CONTI news site, which is currently available\n\nthrough the \"open\" web[4] and through TOR,[5] there are more than 450 organisations that\n\nhave been hacked, and some of their data are now publicly available.\n\nThe basic phases of the means of infiltration, which are utilized by CONTI, are illustrated\n\nin Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1 – Overview of the CONTI Infiltration Process\n\n1 https://ransomwhe.re/\n\n2 https://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2021/05/fbi-tlp-white-report-conti-ransomware-attacks-impact\nhealthcare-and-first-responder-networks-5-20-21.pdf\n\n3 https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a\n\n4 https://continews.click\n\n5 https://continewsnv5otx5kaoje7krkto2qbu3gtqef22mnr7eaxw3y6ncz3ad.onion\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nIn principle, infiltration starts with the attackers sending a phishing email to the\n\npotential victim. Once the victim opens the email and unbeknown to him/her runs the\n\nmalicious dropper, the attackers get initial access to the victim's network and can\n\nexecute code. Having gained initial access, the attackers try to establish a better\n\nfoothold and perform lateral movement to perform the aimed objectives, with the end\n\ngoal being to hold the victim hostage and force the victim to pay a ransom (a) to regain\n\naccess to his/her data, which at the final stage of the attack are encrypted by CONTI, (b)\n\nto prevent publication/selling of his/her data.\n\nIn this context, the attackers try to brute force credentials, perform an LSASS memory\n\ndump, or even exploit some existing vulnerabilities to elevate privileges. Once this is\n\ndone, the attackers try to turn off infected/infiltrated systems' antivirus solutions (AVs)\n\nas well as other existing security mechanisms. Subsequently, the attackers will scan the\n\nnetwork for other servers/workstations to gain additional access.\n\nThen, the infected/infiltrated host(s) is (are) attached to a Cobalt Strike C2 server\n\ncontrolled by the attackers. Afterwards, the attackers use RClone[6] to upload the\n\nexfiltrated data to a cloud service (usually Mega[7]).\n\nFinally, the attackers launch the ransomware \"encryptor\" to lock the victim's files. After\n\nthe encryption, CONTI leaves a \"README\" file in each folder that it encrypts, which\n\nnotifies the victim of the attack that his/her data have been encrypted and provides\n\nmeans to contact the CONTI team to pay the ransom and get the decryption software. In\n\nprior versions, the team used email addresses as means of communication. However,\n\nthey developed a portal later, where users could contact CONTI using an ID that they were\n\nassigned. In these cases, the template of the ransomware notice is in the form of Figure\n\n2.\n\n6 https://rclone.org/\n\n7 https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/analyst-note-conti-ransomware-tlp-white.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFigure 2 – A Sample of the Ransomware Notice Left by CONTI\n\nCONTI has been used in several attacks of high-profile organizations, has been deployed\n\nalong with BazarLoader,[8] and is considered a stakeholder of the ransomware cartel, as a\n\nmember of the Wizard Spider threat group (ClearSky Cyber Security 2021; DiMaggio 2021).\n\nUp to now, there are many detailed technical reports about several ransomware and how\n\nthey operate. Among them, many of these reports deal with CONTI.[9] Moreover, there are\n\nreports which showcase how CONTI works operates when infiltrating an organization.[10]\n\nMore generally, there are studies about ransomware payments, economics (Laszka,\n\nFarhang, and Grossklags 2017; Hernandez-Castro, Cartwright, and Cartwright 2020) or\n\n8 https://thedfirreport.com/2021/09/13/bazarloader-to-conti-ransomware-in-32-hours/\n\n9 https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/conti-unpacked-understanding-ransomware-development-as-a-response-to\ndetection/ and https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/conti-ransomware-gang/\n\n10 https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/02/16/what-to-expect-when-youve-been-hit-with-conti-ransomware/\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\ntheoretical strategies (Caporusso, Chea, and Abukhaled 2018; Cartwright, Hernandez\n\nCastro, and Cartwright 2019; Li and Liao 2020; Hofmann 2020).\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first public report about the actual negotiation\n\nprocess used in a ransomware campaign and not just about a small fragment of the\n\nprocess, e.g. (ClearSky Cyber Security 2021). The basic reason is that up to now, this\n\nintelligence was internal. Besides the perpetrator, only the victim and the delegated\n\nvictim's personnel would have access to this information, while there would not be any\n\nfurther communication of this exchange beyond perhaps the payment wallet address.\n\nTherefore, operational information, statistics about the steps of the performed\n\nnegotiations, possible ransom discounts, errors, or even other requests of both sides are\n\nnot publicly documented nor discussed. Filling this gap, this report provides a good\n\ninsight into the internal operations of such processes and can be considered rather\n\nrepresentative based on the profiles of the compromised organisations. Several patterns\n\nemerge from both negotiating sides (victims and ransomware operators) in terms of\n\nfollowed processes, existing pitfalls, and provided services.\n\nWe argue that this report sheds light on a very shady topic which, despite all technical\n\nand legal measures to counter it, remains a very thorny issue for cybersecurity\n\nprofessionals and continues to grow as ransomware groups evolve their tactics.\n\n# Data collection methodology\n\nTo collect the samples for conducting our research, we used various open malware\n\nrepositories and analysis services including, but not limited to Malware Bazaar, Triage,\n\nHybrid Analysis, CAPE, JOE Sandbox, and VirusShare. Note that in all cases, we used\n\npublicly available samples.\n\nFinally, it is worth highlighting that many web pages that discuss CONTI infections\n\ncontain images that depict the ransomware notice without obfuscating the ID (see Figure\n\n3).\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFigure 3 – An Example of a CONTI Ransomware Note Including the Victim ID (Redacted)\n\nThe latter implies that the security consultants who shared these screenshots did not\n\nunderstand how they were publicly exposing their clients for the sake of publicity. The\n\nsame applies to security consultants or internal IT/security teams, who uploaded the\n\ncollected samples to malware analysis services, to have them analysed, without realising\n\nthat in this way they put the targeted organisations at risk by revealing potentially\n\ntargeted / maybe even internal not publicly available information[11], as well as useful\n\nintelligence to any attackers, which might attempt a newer attack to the organisations,\n\non how the latter handle malware-related incidents.\n\nWhile there are several hundreds of CONTI samples online, the number of unique IDs is\n\nquite limited, which implies that during several campaigns, the spear-phishing emails\n\nmay have contained different droppers; however, the encryptor (delivered in the final\n\n11 see for example https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/new-clues-in-the-target-breach/,\n\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/POSWDS-ThreatExpert-Report.pdf and\n\nhttps://www.qualityplusconsulting.com/res/pos/2014-1-24_InsideTargetBreach_Dell.pdf, where in Target data breach\n\nincident the used POS malware, based on relevant reports, was uploaded to Symantec, and contained an internal IP\n\naddress and as believed by information security researchers, a domain name in Target’s network\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nstage of the attack - the encryption phase -) that was used contained a specific ID per\n\nvictim at a time, which we later noticed that was reused. Notably, in many of the\n\ncollected samples, one may notice that the ransomware notice asks the victim to contact\n\nthe attacker by using ProtonMail, an email service provider which is well-known for the\n\nprovided privacy and security features and provides also an \"open\" web[12] and a TOR\n\nwebsite URL.[13] [14] This is especially relevant for the first versions of CONTI.\n\nTable 1 illustrates some of these email addresses used by the earlier versions of CONTI.\n\nIn many of the most recent collected samples, the ID is hardcoded within the binary and,\n\nin most cases, can be extracted by simply collecting the strings of the binary. The same\n\napplies to the used Protonmail email addresses[15].\n\nEmail address\n\nelsleepamlen1988@protonmail.com\n\nsouthbvilolor1973@protonmail.com\n\nmaxgary777@protonmail.com\n\nranosfinger@protonmail.com\n\npolzarutu1982@protonmail.com\n\nflapalinta1950@protonmail.com\n\nxersami@protonmail.com\n\nheibeaufranin1971@protonmail.com\n\nTable 1 – Some of the ProtonMail email addresses used by CONTI\n\nIn total, we extracted 115 unique IDs that we used to connect to the CONTI negotiation\n\nplatform and extract the relevant negotiations in HTML format. From these IDs, 68 were\n\n12 https://contirecovery.info\n\n13 http://m232fdxbfmbrcehbrj5iayknxnggf6niqfj6x4iedrgtab4qupzjlaid.onion\n\n14 https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/informes/informes-ccn-cert-publicos/5759-ccn-cert-id-02-21-conti-v3-ransomware\n1/file.html\n\n15 More ProtonMail email addresses used by Conti exist in various OSINT sources, ex. https://www.pcrisk.com/removal\nguides/17011-conti-ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nvalid, and 47 contained negotiations or confirmed victims, i.e., the CONTI operators\n\nexpected input from the victims.\n\n# Negotiations\n\nThe CONTI negotiations in general are relatively short, but they may last several weeks.\n\nThe victims are communicating with the CONTI team through the provided CONTI\n\nRecovery Service links that are left in the ransomware notice and discuss the means of\n\ninfiltration and encryption of their data. Please note that in the first versions of CONTI,\n\nthe negotiations were initiated through email exchanges. Gradually, in the later versions,\n\nthe CONTI team developed a specialised platform for the negotiations. The webpage was\n\navailable on the \"open\" web with various TLDs (.top, .xyz, .best, etc.) and also through\n\nTOR. At the time of writing, it is available through web[16] and through TOR.[17]\n\nThe site’s design changes over time from the form of Figure 4 to the form of Figure 5.\n\nFigure 4 – Recovery Site of CONTI (contirecovery.best - contirecovery.info)\n\n16 https://contirecovery.ws\n\n17 https://http://contirecj4hbzmyzuydyzrvm2c65blmvhoj2cvf25zqj2dwrrqcq5oad.onion/\n\n\nFigure 4 – Recovery Site of CONTI (contirecovery.best - contirecovery.info)\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFigure 5 – Recovery Site of CONTI Accessed via TOR\n\nIn principle, each victim is assigned with an ID that consists of 64 alphanumeric\n\ncharacters, and the victim must upload the README file to the web form as displayed in\n\nFigure 5.\n\nIn most cases, the CONTI team requires the representative of the victim to identify\n\nhimself/herself as well as the victim organization. The latter implies that the people\n\nperforming the negotiations are not always the same ones who penetrated the victim as\n\nthe attacker should already know who the victim is.\n\nNevertheless, on several occasions, the chat is prepared, welcoming the victim\n\norganization with their title. If there is no interaction from the victims, the CONTI team\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nstarts issuing threats, which initially concern the publication of the collected data on the\n\nCONTI News site, with additional threats to sell access to the data. See Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6 – CONTI Team Threatening to Sell the Victim’s Data\n\nOn several occasions, the CONTI team notifies the victims, which did not give in to their\n\nthreats before the deadline provided by the CONTI team, that the publication of their\n\ndata has started/finished and/or that a buyer for the data has been found. The chat\n\nactivity is occasionally monitored by the operators, e.g., that a person logged in, see\n\nFigure 7.\n\nFigure 7 – Excerpt from the CONTI Negotiation Platform\n\nThe threats for publication/selling of the data, in the beginning, do not have a strict nor\n\nspecific deadline. Depending on the interaction of the victim with the CONTI team (or\n\nlack of it), they evolve from generic to ’soon’, ’next week’, etc. Refer to Figure 7 for an\n\nexample of a generic deadline.\n\nWhen victims decide to negotiate the price, typically, they require a guarantee that their\n\nfiles will be recovered. Therefore, CONTI operators provide a ‘data pack’ as they call it,\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nwhich shows through the contained files the name of the victim and usually 30% of the\n\ndirectory listing tree for the encrypted files. Moreover, they might ask the victim to\n\n\"provide two files for a test decryption\", which they subsequently decrypt. The decrypted\n\nfiles as well as the ’data pack’ are provided to the victims through various usually\n\n\"obscure\" file services. More precisely, for exchanging files with the victims, the CONTI\n\nteam uses the following services:\n\n  - https://qaz.im/\n\n  - https://transfer.sh/\n\n  - https://dropmefiles.com/\n\n  - https://www.sendspace.com/\n\nThe main reason for using these services is probably some of their features, e.g., the\n\nservices provide a deletion mechanism for the recipient of the uploaded files, they are\n\nfree, they do not require strong authentication.\n\nThe exchanged files are encrypted by using default mechanisms (e.g., the embedded\n\nencryption mechanism of compression programs) and simple passwords (e.g., 123123) to\n\nprevent compatibility issues for the recipients of the files.\n\nAfter the introductions, the negotiation starts with an initial ransom price from the CONTI\n\nteam. Since all the negotiations did not lead to a deal, we report in Table 2 the initially\n\nrequested ransom and the agreed one that was paid for the payments that we could\n\nverify through the bitcoin transactions.\n\nInitially requested ransom Paid ransom Steps BTC\n\n1,250,000 1,000,000 1 20.05326047\n\n3,000,000 800,000 6 17.084\n\n5,000,000 746,500 6 15.43\n\n999,000 512,000 8 10.22997602\n\n900,000 450,000 6 8.00275566\n\n1,500,000 350,000 10 9.69536871\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nInitially requested ransom Paid ransom Steps BTC\n\n900,000 325,000 15 8.90692000\n\n980,000 300,000 7 7.87000000\n\n400,000 200,000 9 5.42840261\n\n1,700,000 120,000 8 2.61000000\n\n300,000 150,000 5 2.46426081\n\n200,000 100,000 7 2.46426081\n\n150,000 100,000 3 2.65200000\n\n3607000 7 (average) 112.8912051\n\nTable 2 – Statistics from the confirmed payments of the collected negotiations.\n\nMoreover, we report in sum the negotiation steps (how many different ransom amounts\n\nwere asked by CONTI team and how many counteroffers the victims performed) as well as\n\nthe ransom amounts in Bitcoin, which were paid to the corresponding wallets.\n\nIt should be highlighted that the attackers use the financial status and public reports of\n\neach separate victim to assess the requested ransom and stress this information\n\nthrough the discussions to press for increased prices. The latter is verified by the\n\noperational/training documents of the group, which were leaked in August by a\n\n\"disgruntled employee\", who \"left\" the group.\n\nAfter the payment is made by the victims, CONTI operators provide the victim with a\n\ndecryptor. A typical issue of the decryptor, which is reported by the victims, is that many\n\nfiles, subsequent to have been decrypted, keep the added ransomware extension (e.g.,\n\n.LSNWX as in the intercepted chats and according to other sources[18]), which the victim\n\nhas to manually remove, to access the decrypted files.\n\nOn some occasions, the victims requested feedback on how the attack was made. The\n\nresponse from the operators was rather generic as, e.g., the corresponding person was\n\n\"inaccessible\". The operators notified that an employee opened a malicious\n\n18 https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/conti-threat-research-update-and-detections.html\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nlink/attachment on an email that gave them access to the host to execute malicious\n\ncode. From there, they only report the use of Mimikatz and other tools, as well as that\n\nthey performed lateral movement to extract the domain/admin passwords. The latter is\n\nalso aligned with the leaked operational/training documents of the group.\n\nIn some instances, the operators recommend their victims to use SentinelOne,\n\nKaspersky, or Symantec security solutions, see Figure 8. Note again that the leaked\n\noperational/training documents of the group contained instructions on how to turn off\n\nMicrosoft Defender and Sophos AV solutions. Apart from the decryptor, they often provide\n\nthe log file of gshred, which they used to shred the files that they exfiltrated from their\n\nvictim.\n\nFigure 8 – Security ‘Advice’ From the Negotiators After the Payment\n\nIt should be noted that in one negotiation the team admitted having lost the files during\n\nexfiltration. Therefore, since the extortion for publishing the files could not work for\n\nthem, they proposed a discount of 50% to the victim for the decryption tool, see Figure\n\n9.\n\nFigure 9 – Notification of Losing the Victim’s Files.\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nExamples have also been observed where the victims have successfully negotiated the\n\npayment of the ransom in smaller chunks, see Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10 – Request for payments in smaller chunks.\n\nWe should also highlight that some negotiators seem to be aware that people may\n\nmonitor these negotiations. Therefore, they may specifically request the deletion of\n\nthese chats, see Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11 – Request for Chat Deletion\n\nFinally, of specific interest is the very well-known case of the Irish Health Service\n\nExecutive (HSE)[19]. The initially requested price was $19,999,000. The HSE representative\n\nasked the team only for proof that they indeed had access to the data. After the proof\n\nwas provided, it is probable that the public outcry forced the CONTI team to provide the\n\n19 https://www.reuters.com/technology/irish-health-service-hit-by-ransomware-attack-vaccine-rollout-unaffected-2021\n05-14/\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\ndecryptor for free without any further discussion. Then, the HSE side proceeded with\n\nnotifying the perpetrators of the legal actions that had been initiated against them.\n\nSince there was no payment, CONTI team notified that they would try to sell the collected\n\ndata. Notably, this negotiation was trolled by another person who accessed the relevant\n\nID negotiation page.\n\n# Discussion\n\nWhile it is rather common to share malware samples, it is rather odd to have such\n\nsamples in the open. Clearly, the infected organizations or the tasked analysts opted to\n\nupload the samples as public samples without thinking of the consequences. In essence,\n\nwithout prior analysis, this is a rather lousy practice since, in targeted attacks, this may\n\nleak sensitive information.\n\nIndeed, despite the fact this allows for snooping of the negotiations, it also impedes the\n\nprocess. As observed, third parties had intervened and ’trolled’ the negotiations twice\n\n(not only in the HSE case) or made the perpetrators see that there is traffic and expect\n\ninteractions from their victims when this was not the case. In an isolated case, the\n\nnegotiations were continued in another platform since they were conducted with\n\nsomeone that according to the victim, should not have access to them. Even more, in\n\nseveral cases, the victims did not request proof of the decryption of their files or the\n\nshredding log, which shows a lack of capacity in handling such cases.\n\nWe should report that we have three cases where we do not have the full negotiations.\n\nTherefore, we do not know how they ended nor any bitcoin address to determine whether\n\nthe victims paid the requested ransom. However, the victims are not listed in the\n\nexposure web page.\n\nA very interesting finding has to do with the handling of the negotiations. As discussed,\n\none would expect that each ID is targeted to a single organization, as this would be a\n\nresult of a spear-phishing campaign. However, the latter is not actually the case as we\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nhave noticed that the same IDs are used with new victims. Therefore, previous victims\n\nmay look at the negotiations of new victims.\n\nMoreover, we have observed that the negotiation chat is occasionally cleared. More\n\nprecisely, not all chats are available continuously and not to their full extent. In fact, we\n\nhave observed the removal of fragments of the discussion, with the most noticeable\n\nbeing the removal of bitcoin addresses. This implies that the operator of each\n\nnegotiation has the option to clear part of the chat and that different operators could be\n\nassigned per ID. The reuse of IDs may imply the use of the same encryption key, so\n\ndecryptors may work for other victims; however, with the ones at hand, this claim cannot\n\nbe verified.\n\nIt should also be noted that the operators reuse a lot of wordings for, e.g., salutation,\n\nrequesting interaction, ransom bidding. For instance, the exact same wording as in\n\nFigure 12 has been intercepted more than once. Indicatively, we point out that the exact\n\nsame text with Figure 8 is used in another chat with the sole change that instead of\n\nKaspersky, it was referring to Symantec. The above implies that apart from the leaked\n\ntraining/operational manuals, there is another ‘playbook’ for the negotiations, which\n\nincludes what should be said and how.\n\nFigure 12 – Reused salutation by the CONTI team.\n\n\nFigure 12 – Reused salutation by the CONTI team.\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nDuring the negotiations, the operators try to appear as professionals, to belong to a\n\ngreater group as in a formal organization and to be friendly to the victim without\n\ninitiating further discussions. In fact, the group has been reported to be recruiting\n\npeople through advertisements[20]. The negotiation depending on the organization, may\n\ntake several iterations and immediate payments are favored and discounted. The\n\nnegotiators of the CONTI group, appearing as professionals, sometimes mention their\n\nvictims as customers/clients and not as victims.\n\nFinally, after the recent leaks of chats on the media, CONTI has introduced a CAPTCHA\n\nmechanism in the negotiation site.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe authors of this work do not by any means promote the payment of ransom. On the\n\ncontrary, we illustrate how this trend has evolved into a multi-million industry worldwide\n\nand made organizations suffer. We illustrate in this research that several practices, such\n\nas sharing malware samples without proper sanitization of the binary, may have a\n\nboomerang effect on the victim by further exposing him/her.\n\nIndeed, one can understand how such negotiations could be derailed by third parties\n\nentering the negotiations. Moreover, even if the victim paid for the ransom, third parties\n\nhad access to the sensitive data and that the exposure could be even more augmented.\n\nIn a wilder scenario, another adversary could jump in the conversation and convince the\n\nvictim of being the original adversary and luring him/her into paying the ransom in\n\nanother wallet or double encrypting the victim’s files.\n\nGiven the public leaks and their size, an obvious question that should be investigated is\n\nwhether the victim organizations have reported these attacks appropriately, as legal\n\nobligations of, e.g., GDPR, set specific deadlines for these actions. The question is even\n\n20 https://www.sekoia.io/en/an-insider-insights-into-conti-operations-part-one/\n\n\n-----\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nmore relevant for the cases of organizations that paid the ransom and whose data\n\nleakages cannot be verified through the public leaks.
