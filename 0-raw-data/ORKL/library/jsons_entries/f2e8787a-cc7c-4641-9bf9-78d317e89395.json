    "plain_text": "# China-linked TA428 Continues to Target Russia and Mongolia IT\n\n**recordedfuture.com/china-linked-ta428-threat-group**\n\nInsikt Group\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group recently identified renewed activity attributed to the\nsuspected Chinese threat activity group TA428. The identified activity overlaps with a TA428\ncampaign previously reported by Proofpoint as “Operation LagTime IT”, which targeted\nRussian and East Asian government information technology agencies in 2019. Based on the\ninfrastructure, tactics, and victim organization identified, we assess that TA428 likely\ncontinues to engage in intrusion activity targeting organizations in Russia and Mongolia.\n\n## Infrastructure and Targeting\n\nOn January 21, 2021, Insikt Group detected the PlugX C2 server 103.125.219[.]222 (Hosting\nprovider: VPSServer[.]com) hosting multiple domains spoofing various Mongolian news\nentities. One of the domains, f1news.vzglagtime[.]net, previously appeared in the\naforementioned Proofpoint Operation LagTime IT [blog. At the time of the Proofpoint blog](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/chinese-apt-operation-lagtime-it-targets-government-information-technology)\npublication in July 2019, the vzglagtime[.]net domain was hosted on 45.76.211[.]18 through\n[the hosting provider Vultr. According to passive DNS data, this IP address also hosted the](https://www.vultr.com/)\nMongolian-themed domains at the same time, further strengthening the overlaps between\nthese unreported suspected TA428 domains and Operation LagTime IT activity. The\nsubdomains appear to spoof familiar news-themed names and words, both in English and in\nMongolian languages. Insikt Group also identified two subdomains in this campaign with the\nterm “Bloomberg”, a US-based news agency. However, we have no other indication that this\ncampaign targeted US companies. The subdomains in this campaign used familiar terms to\nlure victims into trusting these sites. These unreported domains include the following:\n\naircraft.tsagagaar[.]com [Tsag agaar (цаг агаар) is a Mongolian word for “weather”](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=mn&text=weather%0A&op=translate)\n\nnubia.tsagagaar[.]com [Likely spoofing New Ulaanbaatar International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Ulaanbaatar_International_Airport)\n(NUBIA)\n\ngazar.ecustoms-mn[.]com Likely spoofing Mongolian e-customs\n\n\n-----\n\ngovi-altai.ecustomsmn[.]com\n\n\n[References the Govi-Altai region of Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Govi-Altai_Province)\n\n\ngogonews.organiccrap[.]com [Likely spoofing Mongolia news agency GoGo News](https://mongolia.gogo.mn/)\n\nniigem.olloo-news[.]com Likely spoofing Mongolian news agency Olloo\n\noolnewsmongol.ddns[.]info Likely spoofing Mongolian news-themed domain\n\nbloomberg.mefound[.]com Additional spoofed news-themed subdomain\n\nbloomberg.ns02[.]biz Additional spoofed news-themed subdomain\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\nInsikt Group identified multiple Royal Road, Poison Ivy, and PlugX samples communicating\nwith the newly identified TA428-linked infrastructure. This closely matches previous reporting\nby [Proofpoint and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/chinese-apt-operation-lagtime-it-targets-government-information-technology) [NTT Security on TA428 activity. In particular, the following PoisonIvy](https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102gr6l/ta428ncctrojan)\nsample was uploaded to a malware multi-scanning source in December 2020:\n15ce51dd036231d1ef106cd499c7539e68b195a5b199150a30aa2ba41d3076fb (filename:\nx64.dll)\n\n1145d39ce42761862eeb7c46500b3fc5cd0dcd9c0fed35623b577b01d0ec3c8e (filename:\nx86.dll)\n\nThe x86.dll is designed for a 32-bit environment and the x64.dll one for a 64-bit environment.\nOnce executed, the DLL file drops two files: PotPlayerMini.exe, a legitimate executable\nvulnerable to DLL hijacking, and PotPlayer.dll, a PoisonIvy payload. PotPlayerMini.exe is\nexecuted to load the malicious PoisonIvy DLL, which in this case is configured to\ncommunicate with the C2 domain nubia.tsagagaar[.]com. This PoisonIvy loading sequence\n[directly matches TA428 activity described by NTT Security in October 2020. NTT](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Ozawa-etal.pdf)\nresearchers found that the group used the EternalBlue exploit to move laterally and inject the\ninitial DLL files into the lsass.exe process on the target host.\n\nMalware Analysis\n**Figure 1: Malware analysis of recent TA428 sample**\n\n[Insikt Group also identified a malware sandbox upload containing the TA428-linked](https://app.any.run/tasks/3331e993-a107-4cab-a843-7484d8e9de15/)\nPoisonIvy sample seen above alongside an EternalBlue exploit tool, the WinEggDrop port\nscanner, and an MS17-010 scanning tool. The presence of file paths within the upload\nsuggests that the malware was possibly used to target the Russian IT firm ATOL. This\nvictimology also aligns with Operation Lagtime IT activity previously observed, which\nfeatured targeting of Russian and East Asian government information technology agencies.\nAdditionally, a [blog post by researcher Sebdraven from November 2020 details an additional](https://sebdraven.medium.com/actor-behind-operation-lagtime-targets-russia-f8c277dc52a9)\nRoyal Road document sample that he attributes to TA428 as a continuation of Operation\nLagtime IT The lure document spoofs the sender as Mongolian authorities and refers to the\n\n\n-----\n\nconflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in order to lure the victim to opening the document.\nAccording to Sebdraven, the file uses Version 7 of Royal Road RTF weaponizer, which\ninstalls a very simple backdoor in memory, rewriting the EQNEDT32.EXE process. After the\nbackdoor gathers initial information on the target machine’s disk, running processes,\nWindows OS version, and user privileges, it attempts to reach out to the command and\ncontrol (C2) domain custom.songuulcomiss[.]com, which was hosted on the Malaysian IP\naddress 103.106.250[.]239 at the time of discovery.\n\n## Attacker Profile\n\nTA428 is a China-linked cyber espionage group identified and named by Proofpoint\nresearchers in 2019, but some overlaps in infrastructure, victimology, and tools indicate that\n[this group may have been active as far back as 2013. TA428 is believed to use custom tool](https://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2012/NormanShark-MaudiOperation.pdf)\nsets and targets organizations of high strategic value to China, including but not limited to IT,\nscientific research, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, political processes, and financial\n[development. In February 2021, NTT researchers attributed a new campaign to TA428, this](https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102gr6l/ta428ncctrojan)\ntime targeting East Asian defense and aviation organizations in Russia and Mongolia with a\nmalware they call nccTrojan, observed between March 2019 and November 2020.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nIndicators of compromise related to this campaign can be found on the Insikt Group GitHub\nrepository [here.](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research/blob/master/TA428%20Pulse%20Report)\nC2 IPs\n\n103.125.219[.]222 103.249.87[.]72 45.76.211[.]18\nPoison Ivy\n\n1145d39ce42761862eeb7c46500b3fc5cd0dcd9c0fed35623b577b01d0ec3c8e (C2:\nnubia.tsagagaar[.]com)\n15ce51dd036231d1ef106cd499c7539e68b195a5b199150a30aa2ba41d3076fb (C2:\nnubia.tsagagaar[.]com)\n33c0be46fea3a981ae94c1ae0b23c04a763f8318706bd9f7530347f579a2282e (C2:\nbloomberg.ns02[.]biz)\nPlugX\n\n3a5828fe5e55e52f041ad8d67b12a6fc23ec2d2d37a6adde59139d523f1dfc8b (C2:\nnubia.tsagagaar[.]com)\nRoyal Road RTF\n\n4f941e1203bf7c1cb3ec93d42792f7f971f8ec923d11017902481ccf42efaf75 (C2:\n95.179.131[.]29 - previous hosted multiple vzglagtime[.]net subdomains)\nWinEggDrop Port Scanner\n\n13eaf5c0c0a22b09b9dead93c86f085b6c010e3413b0e27c0616896978871048\nEternalBlue Exploit Tool\n\n82b0488fd910fe428513813343bf3a9a62c7bf450d509f00f437766cdc0c7aea\nMS17-010 Scanner\n\n\n-----\n\n15585fd878af7d9efd6cac2984cf52371312439797ee2c8f8180ad149e3f8b07\nTA428-linked Domains\n\naircraft.tsagagaar[.]com ecustoms-mn[.]com f1news.vzglagtime[.]net gazar.ecustomsmn[.]com govi-altai.ecustoms-mn[.]com news.vzglagtime[.]net niigem.olloo-news[.]com\nnubia.tsagagaar[.]com olloo-news[.]com oolnewsmongol.ddns[.]info\nbloomberg.mefound[.]com bloomberg.ns02[.]biz nmcustoms.https443[.]org\ngogonews.organiccrap[.]com tsagagaar[.]com vzglagtime[.]net\n\n\n-----",
