Seven years after my colleagues and I encountered and began tracking](https://warontherocks.com/2016/11/trolling-for-trump-how-russia-is-trying-to-destroy-our-democracy/)\nRussian disinformation proliferating on the Internet and swirling on social media platforms,\nthe U.S. government has begun a holistic effort to disrupt Putin’s digital propaganda\nmachine.\n\n[On Thursday, April 15, 2021, the U.S. Treasury Department issued wide-ranging sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126)\nagainst many elements operating online and on-the-ground involved in U.S. election\ninterference efforts. Specifically, these sanctions revealed four additional information outlets\nto be connected to Russian intelligence services. SouthFront and NewsFront were described\nas receiving “taskings” and working with officers from Russian domestic intelligence—the\nFSB.\n\nStrategic Culture Foundation, another one of the designated outlets, is “an online journal\nregistered in Russia that is directed by the SVR and closely affiliated with the Russian\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs.” The SVR is Russia’s foreign intelligence service. And Strategic\nCulture? Well, that’s the outlet that curiously had an article placed in an online local\n[Yonkers, New York newspaper last May of 2020 —an article that derided former Department](https://www.yonkerstribune.com/2020/05/what-evelyn-farkas-trey-gowdy-and-some-others-dubiously-have-in-common-by-michael-averko)\nof Defense Assistant Secretary Evelyn Farkas and alleged a “Russiagate hoax” just before the\nlocal Democratic Congressional primary where candidate Farkas vied for the nomination\n(See Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, the Treasury designations outed news outlet InfoRos as run by the GRU—Russia’s\nmilitary intelligence. Of critical importance in this declaration was some specific text:\n\nInfoRos used a network of websites, including nominally independent websites, to spread false\nconspiracy narratives and disinformation promoted by GRU officials.\n\nFour years ago, Americans were surprised that many of the political partisans they\n[encountered on Twitter and Facebook were actually fake Russian accounts impersonating](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/04/03/522503844/how-russian-twitter-bots-pumped-out-fake-news-during-the-2016-election)\nAmericans operated from a troll farm in St. Petersburg. Hearings and investigations revealed\nthe GRU’s hacks were real and damaging, that the Kremlin’s trolls duped us with\nconversations and memes and, in some instances, even persuaded Americans to attend\n[political rallies of their own making, convincing one woman to dress up as Hillary Clinton](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/curious-case-russian-flash-mob-west-palm-beach-cheesecake-factory)\nand climb into a cage in front of a Florida Cheesecake Factory.\n\nOverlooked in the broad discussion about election interference efforts has been the payload\ndelivered by the Kremlin’s disinformation machine—the messages Putin’s minions seek to\ndisseminate inside America and where those messages are generated. The sources of\ndisinformation are not singular but many, and seek to subvert not one political or social\ngroup but all, hoping to demobilize establishment politicians, undermine elected officials and\nthe democratic institutions they represent, and generally erode trust and confidence in\ndemocracy as a system of governance. The messages mirror each other in some cases,\ncontradict each other in others, appear overtly some days and covertly in social media posts\non other days. But the goal is always the same: Shift American perceptions of Russia and U.S.\npolicies toward Russia to Putin’s advantage, while pitting Americans against each other in\nways that shake the political and social stability of the country.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome good news though: In 2020, the U.S. did much better fending off Russian interference\nin the election. U.S. government agencies, social media companies and mainstream media\noutlets all improved their game. But it’s still difficult to understand how all of the pieces fit\n[together. Fact-checking outlets like EUvsDisinfo have posted many reports over the years](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/)\nnoting Kremlin connections or suspected sponsorship to disinformation campaigns and the\n[websites that propagate them. Last week brought the Treasury Department’s sanctions. Last](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126)\nsummer, the Department of State’s Global Engagement Center (GEC) revealed Russian\nconnections to various outlets in its “Russia’s Pillars of Disinformation and Propaganda”\n[special report. Sprinkled in between were disclosures of Kremlin connections and](https://www.state.gov/russias-pillars-of-disinformation-and-propaganda-report/)\n[sponsorship in the New York Times,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/russia-disinformation-coronavirus.html) _[Washington Post,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/how-russias-military-intelligence-agency-became-the-covert-muscle-in-putins-duels-with-the-west/2018/12/27/2736bbe2-fb2d-11e8-8c9a-860ce2a8148f_story.html)_ _[Wall Street Journal,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-disinformation-campaign-aims-to-undermine-confidence-in-pfizer-other-covid-19-vaccines-u-s-officials-say-11615129200)_ [CNN,](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/tech/russia-facebook-viral-videos/index.html) NBC\n[News, and the Daily Beast. Every month, Facebook’s shutdowns of social media accounts](https://www.thedailybeast.com/grassroots-media-company-admits-kremlin-ties-after-the-daily-beast-expose)\nrevealed in dribs and drabs the expansive nature of Russia’s trolling and supporting\ninfrastructure. Examining one outlet can infer the problem is small, but when one outlines\nthe entire system, the full scope of the Kremlin disinformation effort to undermine\ndemocracy takes shape.\n\nTo keep a handle on the Kremlin’s propaganda and disinformation ecosystem, we’ve built\nFigure 5 above, which shows the range and type of Russian outlets revealed in a range of\nsources, offering a single location for researchers to connect disparate research and news\nreporting. The categories we’ll use for this diagram and future updates will be:\n\nRussian Overt Media: Openly state-sponsored outlets\n\nRussian Intelligence Linked: Websites with connections to Russian foreign (SVR),\ndomestic (FSB) or military (GRU) intelligence\n\n\n-----\n\n[Pillars of Disinformation & Propaganda: Outlets discussed in the Department of State](https://www.state.gov/russias-pillars-of-disinformation-and-propaganda-report/)\nreport from August 2020\n\nAmplifiers: Those websites consistently amplifying pro-Kremlin narratives and\ndiscussed in a range of reports from fact-checking outlets and public reporting\n\nPrigozhin & Co.: Part of the network associated with sanctioned Russian oligarch and\n[owner of the notorious Internet Research Agency (IRA), Yevgeniy Prigozhin](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1133)\n\n_As additional disclosures come in, we’ll continue to update Figure 5 and offer the sources_\n_for the disclosures._\n\nI routinely run into Americans who don’t believe they encounter Kremlin disinformation or\nthat if they did they would know it. This is unlikely. We found out four years ago that many\nAmericans of all races, ethnicities, economic strata, social causes and political parties\ninteracted with covert Russian accounts, repeated Kremlin lies, and shared Russian memes\nand propaganda.\n\nToday, much of Russia’s disinformation is drowned out by—or simply repeats—American\nmisinformation and disinformation. But during the COVID-19 pandemic and now, amid the\nglobal vaccine rollout, Kremlin disinformation and propaganda from outlets listed in Figure 5\nhas repeatedly drifted into my own social media feed. Since the pandemic started, my nextdoor neighbor from childhood posted a Global Research article claiming COVID-19 is a\nbioweapon; a high-school classmate shared a Sputnik News story proclaiming the FBI\ninvestigation into Russian interference was a hoax; a former U.S. Congresswoman posted a\nKremlin outlet pushing a conspiracy about vaccine safety; and many on my Instagram and\nTwitter feeds shared George Floyd protest content from Redfish. One might wonder why a\nRussian-funded social media venture based in Berlin, Germany makes English-language\ncontent for Americans that showcases protests, racial inequalities, and political violence in\nAmerica.\n\nTo get a better flavor for these outlets in Figure 5 and some of their popular nonsense one\nmight encounter on social media, we also created the accompanying Figure 6 to help one\nunderstand the types of readers they attract and the headlines they produce. More updates to\ncome as we learn more … the U.S. government appears to be back.\n\n_Thanks to Max, Rachel and Lukas and all of my research team for their hard work, analysis_\n_and graphic design skills._\n\n[Share](https://clintwatts.substack.com/p/russias-disinformation-ecosystem?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share)\n\n**FIGURE 6 - RUSSIA’S DISINFORMATION ECOSYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----",
