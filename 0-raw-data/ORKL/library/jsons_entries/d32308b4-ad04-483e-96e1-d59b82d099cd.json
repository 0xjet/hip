The project is curated by Trevor Giffen and](https://twitter.com/TrevorGiffen)\nreviewed by the broader Curated Intelligence community.\n\nAn \"initial access broker\" is an individual who compromises systems or user accounts with\nthe intent of gaining privileged access, to later sell. Initial access sales happen both publicly\nand privately, across many contexts. KE-LA does a great job of explaining initial access\nbrokers here; common examples include:\n\nAdvertising access sales on underground forums\nAdvertising access sales on underground marketplaces\nAdvertising access sales privately to ransomware actors (ex. 5-30% cut for initial\naccess alone)\nAdvertising access sales privately to interested third-parties (ex. information theft)\nGaining access to an internet-facing system, typically servers with an RCE\n_vulnerability or RDP_\nGaining access using an information stealer campaign\nGaining access using information sold on an underground marketplace\nGaining access using reused credentials from third-party data breaches\nGaining access using password guessing, typically bruteforcing or password spraying\nGaining access using a phishing campaign\nGaining access using an insider threat\n\nHigh resolution files are available via GitHub:\n\n🔗 PNG: https://github.com/curated-intel/Initial-Access-BrokerLandscape/blob/main/InitialAccessBrokers.png\n🔗 SVG: https://github.com/curated-intel/Initial-Access-BrokerLandscape/blob/main/InitialAccessBrokers.svg\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
