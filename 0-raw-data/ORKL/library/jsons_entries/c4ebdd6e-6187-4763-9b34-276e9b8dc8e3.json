Schwartz June 17, 2013\n\n(click image for larger view)\n\nThe Syrian Electronic Army: 9 Things We Know\n\nWho's launching online attacks against your network? How can you better detect those\nattacks and -- if an attack turns out to be successful -- identify what was stolen?\nEnabling businesses to answer those questions is the premise of a cloud-based service\nannounced Tuesday by security startup CrowdStrike. Dubbed Falcon, the big-data \"active\ndefense platform\" is designed to identify intrusions in real time, attribute attacks – correlate\nwith a known group of attackers – and help businesses block attacks or even engage in\ncounterintelligence or deception by feeding attackers fake information.\n\n\"This is the real-time damage assessment that no one is doing today,\" said Dmitri\nAlperovitch, the co-founder and CTO of CrowdStrike, speaking by phone. \"It shows you who\nthe adversary is, what did they do [on your network], what did they take, which commands\ndid they execute?\" The service works in part by running a small (400 KB) \"sensor\" on\n\n\n-----\n\nWindows 7 and Mac OS X systems, bolstered by DNS, email and API sensors on servers, to\ntrack the types of attacks that are being launched. CrowdStrike then correlates attack\ninformation with intelligence that the company gathers on attack groups.\n\n**[ NSA whistleblower's accusations deepen. Read** **Snowden Says U.S. Hacking Chinese**\n**Civilians Since 2009. ]**\n\n[As highlighted by successful spear-phishing attacks against everyone from security giant](http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/spear-phishing-attacks-on-the-rise/230500025)\nRSA to the White House, stopping every last information security attack might be impossible.\n[So-called advanced persistent threat (APT) groups often use fake emails and attachments to](http://www.informationweek.com/security/cybercrime/advanced-persistent-threats-get-more-res/232600562)\ninfect targeted PCs and steal data, oftentimes without end users or security teams being\naware. Once attackers infect a single PC, unless they're detected, they can lurk in corporate\n[networks indefinitely: telecommunications giant Nortel was compromised for 10 years,](http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/8-lessons-from-nortels-10-year-security/232601092)\n[defense contractor QinetiQ for three years.](http://www.informationweek.com/security/government/china-tied-to-3-year-hack-of-defense-con/240154064)\n\nSuch attacks are cheap to build and inexpensive to launch. Even if only one attack out of\nevery 100 or 1,000 attempts succeeds, that might equal success for attackers. Given that\nreality, CrowdStrike's play is to help businesses identify not just when they've been attacked,\nbut also who stole the information, what they stole and why they targeted the business in the\nfirst place -- what's their bigger goal?\n\n\"The problem you've had for the past six to seven years is the emergence of targeted\nattackers, and for them, it doesn't mater how many layers of defense you put in place; what\nthey want is you,\" said Alperovitch. \"They want money, national secrets, intellectual property,\nand they're going to worm their way in, because the return on that investment is gigantic.\"\n\nCould defenders gain an edge by better understanding their attackers? \"From an adversary\nperspective, we really focus on the targeted attackers,\" said Alperovitch. \"We're tracking lots\nof nation-state-sponsored groups that are working to penetrate companies,\" he said, and\n\"understanding their campaigns, and tradecraft, as well as who they're targeting.\"\n\nCrowdStrike has grouped attackers into \"adversary groups\" -- to date, about 48 in total -named for country characteristics: \"pandas\" for groups operating from China; \"cats\" as in\nPersian cats for Iran; \"bears\" for Russia; \"saints\" for Georgia; and \"tigers\" for India. \"Some in\nthe community refer to the adversary by the malware detection name from a specific\nantivirus vendor, e.g. Hydraq,\" said Adam Meyers, director of intelligence at CrowdStrike, in\na [blog post, referring to the name of the malware used in the so-called Aurora attacks](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/whois-anchor-panda/index.html)\nagainst Google. \"This is sometimes useful, but when the adversary is using a malware that is\ndetected as Generic.Downloader.234, you have a much harder time communicating,\" Meyers\nsaid.\n\nCrowdStrike recommends that businesses use its intelligence on online adversaries to\nidentify and focus on the attackers they're most likely to face. \"For example, if you're in the\nfinancial service industry, you'll care about Big Panda, which is going after financial services\n\n\n-----\n\nfirms, but not Karma Panda that s going after dissident groups, said Alperovitch. If you re\ntrying to go after everyone and defend against everything, you're really defending against\nnothing.\"\n\nFor instance, one group that CrowdStrike has been tracking -- dubbed Anchor Panda -- has\nlaunched 124 attacks over the past six months, many of which appear to be aimed in part at\n[building out deep-sea capabilities. Adam Meyers, head of intelligence for Crowdstrike,](http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/chinese-hackers-stole-us-military-secret/240155624)\nrecently told The New Yorker that the information being targeted by the group bears more\n[than a passing resemblance to China's five-year plan for modernizing its infrastructure.](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/20/130520fa_fact_seabrook)\n\nOnce businesses have identified the group behind an attack, or used new intelligence to\nidentify previously unidentified attacks that were successful as well as what was stolen, what\nhappens next? According to Alperovitch, \"if you want to work with the government, we can\n[help with that as well, on our services side,\" which is headed by Shawn Henry, whose prior](http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/china-hack-attacks-play-offense-or-defen/240150482)\njob was serving as the executive assistant director of the FBI's criminal, cyber, response and\nservices branch. \"Or you take the attribution and take legal action against that individual or\nthe company,\" he said. \"A lot of companies are multinationals, so you can actually sue them\nin the United States -- or in a jurisdiction of your choosing overseas, and get criminal\ndamages or injunctive relief for stolen information.\"\n\nAlperovitch said that when it comes to responding to hack attacks, there can be strength in\nnumbers: \"If you're one company going up against China, you're going to be afraid of\nretaliation, of your business being shut out of China. But if you're in a band of 20 or 30\nFortune 100 companies, China can't really retaliate; it needs them all.\"\n\n\"Ultimately we'll only solve this problem together, not individually trying to build castles to\nprotect ourselves,\" said Alperovitch. \"That model hasn't worked in the physical world in over\n400 years, and certainly not in cyber space.\"\n\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly-discovered vulnerabilities, data breach\ninformation, and emerging trends.
