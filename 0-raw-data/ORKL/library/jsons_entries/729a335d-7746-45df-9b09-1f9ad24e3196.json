If a machine**\n**is compromised by the malware, attackers get an opportunity to covertly control the**\n**computer. The backdoor receives commands from a remote server to create, transfer,**\n**rename, delete various files, as well as some other instructions.**\n\nThe number of malicious programs for MAC OS X is small, especially compared with the\nnumber of threats to Windows. Until recently only one backdoor program for the OS was\nknown—BackDoor.DarkHole. Versions of this malware exist for Mac OS X and for Windows.\nWhen launched, it enables hackers to open web pages in the default browser on the infected\nmachine, restart the computer remotely and perform various operations with files. Now, in the\nDr.Web virus database contains entries for both BackDoor.DarkHole and BackDoor.Olyx.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe program gets to a user s computer as an application designed for Macs featuring the\nIntel-compatible architecture, BackDoor.Olyx creates the /Library/Application\nSupport/google/ directory on the disk to which it saves a file named startp. Then\n**BackDoor.Olyx places the file /Library/ LaunchAgents/www.google.com.tstart.plist into the**\nhome directory, and uses the file to launch the malicious object after a system reboot.\n\nAfter that the program moves itself to a temporary folder named google.tmp to delete the\nexecutable from its original location. As the name implies, BackDoor.Olyx operates in an\ninfected system as a backdoor which includes downloading and running malicious files on\ninfected machines and executing various commands in the /bin/bash shell. Thus, attackers\ncan gain control over an infected computer without the user's knowledge.\n\nUsers of Dr.Web for Mac OS X can rest assured about the security of their computers, since\nthe signature of the malware has already been added to the Dr.Web virus database. To\nprevent BackDoor.Olyx from infecting systems, users of Dr.Web for Mac OS X are\nrecommended to enable automatic updating and scan their hard drives regularly.\n\n[What is the benefit of having an account?](https://www.drweb.com/user/advantages/?lng=en)\n\n## Tell us what you think\n\nTo ask Doctor Web’s site administration about a news item, enter @admin at the beginning\nof your comment.
