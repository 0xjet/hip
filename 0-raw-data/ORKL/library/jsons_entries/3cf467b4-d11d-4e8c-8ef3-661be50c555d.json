    "plain_text": "# APT Groups Moving Down the Supply Chain\n\n**[duo.com/decipher/apt-groups-moving-down-the-supply-chain](https://duo.com/decipher/apt-groups-moving-down-the-supply-chain)**\n\nIn August 2018, attackers broke into the network of Visma, a major managed services\nprovider in Norway that does more than $1 billion in business each year. Using stolen Citrix\ncredentials, the intruders made their way into the company’s network, then installed a custom\nremote-access tool on an Active Directory controller and began moving around the network.\nEventually, the attackers harvested employee usernames and password hashes, packaged\nthem up, and exfiltrated the data to a Dropbox account.\n\nThe attack was part of a recent string of operations that some researchers say is the work of\nAPT10, a group associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security. APT10 has been\noperating for many years and has drawn the attention of law enforcement and intelligence\nagencies, including the Department of Justice, which indicted two Chinese citizens it says\nare members of APT10. That group has been blamed for intrusions at a broad range of\norganizations, including other managed services providers (MSP), in dozens of countries\naround the world. Researchers consider APT10 one of the more capable and dangerous\ncyberespionage groups operating at the moment, and the intrusion at Visma fits the group’s\npattern of [targeting MSPs as a stepping stone to going after customers or other suppliers.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A)\n\nThat strategy and targeting philosophy is one that more attack groups are adopting as\nprimary targets such as defense contractors, technology vendors, and financial companies\nbecome more mature in their security programs and resilient to attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe ve seen a few groups do this, including several Chinese groups and some Russian\ngroups, too. I think there’s two reasons for it. One is that it’s a more efficient and effective\nway of conducting operations. If you target an MSP or a cloud provider, you become part of\nthis infrastructure that companies have already invested in and trust,” said Priscilla Moriuchi,\ndirector of strategic threat development at Recorded Future, a threat intelligence firm that\nhelped Visma investigate the Visma intrusion.\n\n“It’s an effective way of doing targeting. Groups are increasingly targeting the global supply\nchains and third parties because when you get in there, you have access to other targets.”\n\nAlthough Recorded Future attributes the Visma intrusion to APT10, other researchers say it\nmay be the work of a separate group in China known as APT31, or Zirconium. Benjamin\n[Koehl of Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center said on Twitter that the C2 infrastructure bore](https://twitter.com/bkMSFT/status/1093109336740642816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1093109336740642816&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberscoop.com%2Fapt10-apt31-recorded-future-rapid7-china%2F)\nthe hallmarks of APT31.\n\n\"This activity is not APT10. It is all APT31 (or ZIRCONIUM) in our terms. The C2 domains\nthat you mention were all registered and the threat actors made subsequent changes in\nspecific ways that we attribute (with other information) to ZIRCONIUM,\" he said.\n\nMoriuchi said that APT10 and APT31 are both tied to the Chinese government and they\nshare a number of attributes, tactics, and techniques.\n\n\"It’s our belief that regardless of attribution delineation between APT10 and APT31 in this\ncase, the need for defenders to take action does not change, nor do our recommendations,\"\nshe said.\n\nWe believe that APT10 and APT31 are closely linked and that Chinese state-sponsored\nactors are associated with both groups. Today, there is little information publicly available on\nAPT31 and none that meaningfully separates it from the behavior or motivations of APT10;\nAPT31 tactics, techniques, malware, victims, perpetrators, and more are largely unknown.\nWe are now actively working to unearth everything we can on APT31 and have learned that\nboth APT10 and APT31 may share very similar techniques, malware, and are likely\nattributed to the same Chinese state organization.\n\nThe August 2018 attack was a painful compromise, especially for a provider such as Visma,\nwhose business depends on customer trust. But rather than quickly contain it and kick the\ndust under the rug, Visma officials decided to use the incident to show other organizations\nthat could be targets exactly what happened and what to look for. This is rare for a number of\nreasons, mainly because of the embarrassment of the compromise and the potential effect it\ncould have on the company’s business. But Moriuchi said there’s quite a bit of value in\nexposing the details of an operation like this.\n\n“Visma is taking a stance to confront the attackers and say they’re not afraid,” she said. “We\nreally see that there’s deterrent value in this.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe operation against Visma followed a familiar pattern and used tools that researchers had\npreviously seen, including the Trochilus RAT. The team also employed an interesting\ntechnique in which operators rename a legitimate binary and then sideload a malicious\nWindows DLL onto the compromised machine. That DLL then decrypts some shellcode and\ninjects the Trochilus RAT into memory.\n\n“After almost two weeks, on August 30, 2018, APT10 attackers used their access to the\nnetwork to move laterally and made their first deployment of an RC4- and Salsa20-encrypted\nvariant of the Trochilus malware using a previously associated DLL sideloading technique.\nTwo separate infection chains leveraging this specific DLL sideloading technique were\nidentified on the Visma network using legitimate known good binaries that had DLL searchorder path issues. This means that APT10 actors had two separate access points into the\nVisma network,” the [Recorded Future analysis of the intrusion says.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/apt10-cyberespionage-campaign/)\n\nThat’s a slick technique, but it’s important to note that what enabled the attackers to get to\nthat point was stolen credentials. Sure, state-sponsored attack teams have custom malware,\nprivate C2 infrastructure, and in many cases political cover, but even with all of that, they still\nneed a way in to a target network, and nothing suits that purpose like stolen credentials.\nPilfered usernames and passwords have the advantage of giving the attackers a simple way\nin, and also let them avoid many network defenses. At least initially.\n\n\"Groups are increasingly targeting the global supply chains and third parties because\nwhen you get in there, you have access to other targets.”\n\nOne of the things the Recorded Future researchers noticed is that the attackers\nauthenticated to the Visma network outside of the typical working hours for employees.\nThat’s a classic red flag, and Moriuchi said it’s a good reminder that these attackers are\nhumans, not bots.\n\n“We miss the human element when we talk about this. There are people behind these\ncomputers. They have lives and families and vacations. They make mistakes,” she said.\n“The hours of operation are important.”\n\nThe human part of these operations also affects the targeting. APT teams generally are not\nindependent units making their own choices and selecting targets as they see fit. They have\nbosses like anyone else and get orders that they’re bound to carry out.\n\n“The reality is, for nation state groups, they’re part of the military or an intelligence agency\nand are fulfilling the requirements of their bosses. You don’t just have one job. You’re\nseeking multiple targets and multiple sources of information,” Moriuchi said.\n\nWhich explains why the attackers also targeted a law firm in the United States and an\ninternational clothing company, intrusions that both involved the use of stolen Citrix\ncredentials. The law firm handles intellectual property cases, which makes it a likely target\nfor a cyberespionage team but the apparel company is a less-obvious target at first blush\n\n\n-----\n\nBut Moriuchi stressed that APT groups continuously learn from previous operations and\nadjust their tools, tactics, and targeting as they progress. With primary targets becoming\nmore wary, moving down the supply chain becomes a more and more attractive option.\n\n“It’s an interesting problem. We’ve seen that methodology migrate from the government and\ndefense area as the ultimate target has become more difficult to get to and vendors and\nsuppliers are targeted more often. We see this as behavior that will increase in the coming\nyears,” Moriuchi said.\n\n“The Ministry of State Security and APT3 have performed attacks against MSPs and vendors\nand they understand the vulnerability of the global supply chain.”\n\n[Apt](https://duo.com/decipher/tag/apt)\n\n\n-----",
