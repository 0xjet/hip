Evidence suggests the exploitation was occurring as early as October 2022 and\nidentified targets include a European government entity and a managed service provider\nlocated in Africa.\n\nMandiant identified a new malware we are tracking as “BOLDMOVE” as part of our\ninvestigation. We have uncovered a Windows variant of BOLDMOVE and a Linux variant,\nwhich is specifically designed to run on FortiGate Firewalls. We believe that this is the latest\nin a series of Chinese cyber espionage operations that have targeted internet-facing devices\nand we anticipate this tactic will continue to be the intrusion vector of choice for wellresourced Chinese groups.\n\nOn December 12, 2022, Fortinet released a PSIRT Advisory and notified customers\nregarding CVE-2022-42475\n\nFortinet issued [instructions on how to search for Indicators of Compromise](https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-Critical-vulnerability-Protect-against-heap-based/ta-p/239420)\n[Fortinet provided additional details including IoCs from subsequent research.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/psirt-blogs/analysis-of-fg-ir-22-398-fortios-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-sslvpnd)\n\n\n-----\n\n## China Continues to Focus on Network Devices\n\nThis incident continues China’s pattern of exploiting internet facing devices, specifically those\nused for managed security purposes (e.g., firewalls, IPS\\IDS appliances etc.). These devices\nare attractive targets for multiple reasons. First, they are accessible to the internet, and if the\nattacker has an exploit, they can gain access to a network without requiring any victim\ninteraction. This allows the attacker to control the timing of the operation and can decrease\nthe chances of detection.\n\nThe exploits required to compromise these devices can be resource intensive to develop,\nand thus they are most often used in operations against hardened and high priority targets;\noften in the government and defense sectors. With BOLDMOVE, the attackers not only\ndeveloped an exploit, but malware that shows an in-depth understanding of systems,\nservices, logging, and undocumented proprietary formats. Malware running on an internetconnected device can enable lateral movement further into a network and enable command\nand control (C2) by tunneling commands in and data out of a network.\n\nIt is important to note that many of these types of devices do not offer a simple mechanism to\nview which processes are running on the device’s operating systems. These devices are\ntypically intended to inspect network traffic, searching for anomalies as well as signs of\nmalicious behavior, but are often not inherently protected themselves.\n\nManaged devices may provide only a limited admin interface that allows configuration\nand viewing/collection of logs\nManaged devices may not allow for additional security products, such as Endpoint\nDetection and Response (EDR) to be installed\nAccess to core security features may be limited to the device manufacturer\n\nPrevious examples of public reporting by Mandiant and others on operations targeting these\ndevices are here:\n\nCheck Your Pulse: Suspected APT Actors Leverage Authentication Bypass Techniques\nand Pulse Secure Zero-Day\n[NSA | APT5: Citrix ADC Threat Hunting Guidance](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Dec/13/2003131586/-1/-1/0/CSA-APT5-CITRIXADC-V1.PDF)\nSuspected Chinese Activity Exploiting Zero-Day Vulnerability, Leverages New Malware\nDesigned for Internet-Facing Devices\n[Zero-Days Exploit in SonicWall Email Security Lead to Enterprise Compromise](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/zero-days-exploited-2021)\n\n## BOLDMOVE Backdoor\n\nIn December 2022, Mandiant identified the BOLDMOVE backdoor associated with the\nexploitation of CVE-2022-49475 FortiOS vulnerability. BOLDMOVE is written in C and has\nboth Windows and Linux variants, the latter of which is intended to run (at least in part) on\nFortinet devices as it reads data from a file proprietary to Fortinet\n\n\n-----\n\nMandiant has not directly observed exploitation of the vulnerability; however, samples of the\nBOLDMOVE Linux variant have a hard coded C2 IP address that were listed by Fortinet as\nbeing involved in the exploitation, suggesting CVE-2022-49475 was exploited to deliver\nBOLDMOVE. In addition to the Linux variant, Mandiant also revealed a Windows version.\nWindows versions of BOLDMOVE appear to have been compiled as early as 2021.\nHowever, Mandiant has not seen this malware in use in the wild so it is uncertain how it was\nused. In-depth analysis of the malware is provided later in this post.\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe assess with low confidence that this operation has a nexus to the People’s Republic of\nChina. China-nexus clusters have historically shown significant interest in targeting\nnetworking devices and manipulating the operating system or underlying software which\nsupports these devices. In addition, the geographical and sector targeting is consistent with\nprevious Chinese operations.\n\nLimited technical indicators point to the development of the malware as having been\ncompiled on a machine in the UTC+8 time zone, which includes Australia, China,\nRussia, Singapore, and other Eastern Asian countries, and on a machine configured to\ndisplay Chinese characters.\nA host survey buffer which is used by the Windows variant of BOLDMOVE in order to\nprovide the C2 with information on the infected host starts with the string “gbk”. The\ncomparable survey buffer of the Linux variant starts with “utf-8”, which indicates that\nthis field designates character encoding. If we are to consider “gbk” in this context, then\nthis is an extension of a Chinese character set\nThe exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in networking devices, followed by the\ninstallation of custom implants, is consistent with previous Chinese exploitation of\nnetworking devices.\n\nMandiant has previously reported on significant campaigns impacting networking devices,\nlikely revealing a long-standing interest by China to embed cyber campaigns in the\noverarching telecommunications and networking architecture used by organizations\nworldwide:\n\nIn April 2021, Mandiant reported extensively on the exploitation of Pulse Secure.\nMandiant recently responded to multiple security incidents involving compromises of\n[Pulse Secure VPN appliances.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/updates-on-chinese-apt-compromising-pulse-secure-vpn-devices)\nIn March 2021, Mandiant identified three zero-day vulnerabilities in SonicWall’s Email\nSecurity (ES) product that were being exploited in the wild. Mandiant’s investigations\ninformed us that the adversary leveraged these vulnerabilities, with intimate knowledge\nof the SonicWall application, to install a backdoor, access files and emails, and move\nlaterally into the victim organization’s network.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Outlook\n\nMandiant has produced in depth reporting on the growing number of managed, internetfacing and connected devices targeted by Chinese threat actors. This latest campaign may\nbe a continuation of a long-standing practice by China-nexus cyber espionage actors. This\ncampaign and infection vector also should be strong reminders of the importance of keeping\nup with updates and patches, of externally facing devices or those exposed to the internet.\n\nThis campaign, and other similar campaigns, offer defenders a unique look into the\nvulnerabilities and gaps many organizations constantly face when services and networks are\nmanaged remotely. Given their configuration, it is very hard to measure the scope and extent\nof malicious activity that results from exploiting internet facing network devices, as we have\nlittle to no information that can indicate those devices are compromised.\n\nThere is no mechanism to detect malicious processes running on such devices, nor\ntelemetry to proactively hunt for malicious images deployed on them following an exploitation\nof a vulnerability. This makes network devices a blind spot for security practitioners and\nallows attackers to hide in them and maintain stealth for long periods, while also using them\nto gain foothold in a targeted network.\n\n## BOLDMOVE Linux Analysis\n\n_BOLDMOVE is a fully featured backdoor written in C and compiled with GCC 11.2.1. When_\n_executed it performs a system survey and is capable of receiving commands from a C2_\n_server that in turn allow attackers to control the file system, spawn a remote shell, or relay_\n_traffic via the infected host._\n\nBased on indicators from the original Fortinet advisory, Mandiant was able to identify multiple\nLinux versions of BOLDMOVE. There are a core set of features across all observed\ninstances of BOLDMOVE, Windows and Linux, and at least one Linux sample contained\nextended capabilities enabling it to alter specific behaviors and functionality of Fortinet\ndevices, namely FortiGate Firewalls.\n\n**Core Features**\n\nUpon execution, BOLDMOVE attempts to form a session with a hard-coded C2 server. Once\nit is established, it performs a system survey to collect information that identifies the infected\nmachine to the C2. Information collected is outlined in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: System Survey\n\n**Index** **Field Value**\n\n\n-----\n\n0 Encoding used for the strings in the survey buffer: utf-8\n\n1 Hard-coded string that seemingly identifies the sample or campaign, e.g., “Cora/c”\n\n2 OS version string. For Linux-based operating systems this string has the format\n“Linux <linux_version> <utsname.release> <utsname.machine>\n\n[<utsname.version>]”, wherein the various fields are obtained from a call to the\nuname function. For non-Linux operating systems this string has the format\n<utsname.sysname> <utsname.release> <utsname.machine> [<utsname.version>].\nThe substring <linux_version> is being constructed by reading data from one of the\nfiles /etc/system-release, /etc/os-release (looking for the values of the NAME= and\nVERSION= keys),/migadmin/ng/vpn/map/pkginfo.json (looking for the value enclosed\nby the strings ver_s\\\":\\\" and \\\",\\\"chksum), /etc/debian_version.\n\n3 Host name\n\n4 Comma-separated list of <ip>/<mask> entries that represent network interfaces on\nthe host\n\n5 The effective user ID of the backdoor's process (result of geteuid())\n\n6 The process ID of the backdoor's process\n\n7 String of the format cwd=<current_dir>\\r\\nexecutable=\n<current_image_path>\\r\\nevent=wv\\r\\nserver=139.180.128.142:443\\r\\n/proc/version=\n<proc_version_data>\n\nSubsequently, the C2 may send commands for execution that allow attackers to control the\ninfected device. Command codes across platforms and versions of BOLDMOVE may vary\nbut their core capabilities do not appear to change and include:\n\nTable 2: Supported commands\n\n\n**Major**\n**Command**\n**Code**\n\n\n**Minor**\n**Command**\n**Code**\n\n\n**Command**\n\n\n0x0 0x0 Frees all resources and terminates the backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\n0x11 0x21 Lists information on all files in the system recursively, starting\nfrom the root directory. In addition to the file's path, the\ninformation provided for each file is based on output of the stat\nfunction and includes the following fields of the stat structure\n(details on it can be found here): st_mode, st_size,\nst_mtim.tv_sec, st_uid, st_gid.\n\n0x11 0x0 Lists information on files recursively, starting from a given\ndirectory\n\n0x12 0x0 Creates new directory via mkdir\n\n0x13 0x0 Removes a directory via rmdir\n\n0x14 0x10 Given an attacker provided file path, removes an existing file (if\nsuch exists) and creates a new file instead\n\n0x14 0x21 Closes a file descriptor that was opened for writing\n\n0x14 0x32 Writes data to the created file\n\n0x15 0x10 Gets a file's size before reading from it\n\n0x15 0x21 Closes a file descriptor that was opened for reading\n\n0x15 0x40 Reads data from a formerly opened file\n\n0x20 0x0 Executes a shell command and sends back the output\n\n0x20 0x33 Executes a shell command without sending back an output\n\n\n0x21 0x10,\n0x21,\n0x43,\n0x44, 0x45\n\n\nCreates an interactive shell that leverages two pipes—one for\nprocessing shell input from the server and another for sending\nback shell outputs, thus supporting an asynchronous session\nbetween the C2 and the infected host. The various\nsubcommands handle actions involved in forming and\nmaintaining the shell session\n\n\n-----\n\n0x22 0x10,\n0x21,\n0x32,0x33\n\n0x30 0x15,\n0x16,\n0x17,\n0x18\n\n\nCreates an interactive shell that leverages a single pipe for both\npassing server sourced inputs to the shell and retrieving\ncommand outputs from it. The formed shell works in a\nsynchronous mode, wherein the pipe can be either probed to\nretrieve shell output or written with input data in each access to\nit. The various subcommands handle actions involved in\nforming and maintaining the shell session\n\n\nInitiates a network traffic relay session. The C2 sends a target\naddress as an argument and further packets passed through\nsub-commands of this command are used to pass data back\nand forth to and from the target server\n\n\n0x53 0x10 Deletes the backdoor's image and creates a new one with the\nsame name as preparation for writing an updated backdoor\nimage\n\n0x53 0x21 Closes the file descriptor opened for writing a backdoor image\nupdate\n\n0x53 0x32 Writes data sent from the C2 server to the formerly opened file\ndescriptor that corresponds to the updated backdoor image\n\n0x54 0x0 Spawns a new process of the backdoor with the argument 1,\nwhich would in turn attempt to execute an image with that\nname. The purpose of this action is unclear.\n\n0x55 0x0 Same as command 0x54\n\n0x56 0x0 Serves as an echo command; receives a command packet from\nthe server and replies back with a packet that has the same\nmajor command code and blank body. Possibly used to check\nthe infected host's connectivity\\state.\n\nThe Linux iteration of BOLDMOVE leverages several statically compiled libraries to\nimplement its functionality:\n\nAn undetermined and likely custom library used for event handling (reminiscent of\n[libevent). It operates in a single-threaded mode, wherein each action is scheduled and](https://libevent.org/)\nexecuted as an event callback. It may allude to the fact that the developers aimed for\nsupporting the infection of single core devices, among others.\n[WolfSSL (also compiled in a single-threaded mode), which facilitates SSL encrypted](https://www.wolfssl.com/)\ncommunication to the C2 server\n\n\n-----\n\n[Musl libc](https://www.musl-libc.org/)\n\nUpon failure, the malware reruns itself in a new process. In addition, if the malware is\nexecuted with a command line argument, it would not initiate the backdoor logic but rather\nattempt to execute the provided argument as a new process.\n\nPrior to starting the backdoor's logic, the malware calls the signal function in order to ignore\nthe signals SIGCHLD, SIGHUP, SIGPIPE.\n\n## Extended Features\n\nThe extended version of BOLDMOVE (MD5: 3191cb2e06e9a30792309813793f78b6)\ncontains all the aforementioned functionality but with additional features.\n\n[The extended version contains Execution Guardrails (T1480) by verifying that it is executing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/)\nfrom a specific path. It accomplishes this in the following manner:\n\n1. Retrieving its own path from /proc/self/exe\n2. Obtaining an inode from this resultant path via fstatat\n3. Obtain a secondary inode from the statically defined path /bin/wxd\n4. Comparing these two inode records\n\nFigure 1: Path Execution Guardrails\n\n\n-----\n\n[The extended version contains a command that can perform Indicator Blocking (T1562.006)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006/)\nby disabling Fortinet daemons miglogd and syslogd.It also contains a command enabling it\nto patch memory address spaces of the same logging daemons. Due to Mandiant being\nunable to obtain those executables from Fortinet devices, we are unable to accurately\ndetermine the nature of those patches. However, Mandiant assesses it is likely that they are\nintended to disable a logging capability during the backdoor’s run-time. Each patch data is\nkept in the following struct:\n```\n struct st_log_patch_struct\n {\n   char\n fortigate_version_name[24];\n   __int64 target_addr1;\n   __int64 patch_bytes1;\n   __int64 target_addr2;\n   __int64 patch_bytes2;\n }log_patch_struct;\n\n```\nTable 4 in Appendix A summarizes the targeted FortiGate Devices, their corresponding\npatched addresses, and bytes.\n\nAdditionally, the extended version of BOLDMOVE contains a command capable of modifying\nproprietary Fortinet logs on the system. It checks the following paths:\n```\n   /tmp/log\n   /var/log/log\n   /var/log\n\n```\nFor filenames matching the format:\n```\n   elog\n   offset/elog.ofs\n   offset/elog.<index>.cidx\n\n```\nOne of BOLDMOVE’s extended variant commands is capable of decompressing, parsing,\nand overwriting the undocumented structure pertaining to those proprietary log files allowing\nthe attacker to modify chosen parts of the logs.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe extended version contains a Watchdog like feature that may enable the malware to\npersist across upgrades. To accomplish this, BOLDMOVE monitors two files via the fstatat\nfunction:\n```\n /data/lib/libgif.so\n /data/lib/libips.so\n\n```\nIf the size of these files differs, BOLDMOVE performs the following actions:\n\nCreates a backup of the legitimate file /data/lib/libips.so stored at\n```\n   /data/lib/libiptcp.so\n\n```\nOverwrites the legitimate library /data/lib/libips.so with a trojanized version of it\nlocated at /data/lib/libgif.so\n\nThus, if there were to be a system patch that replaced /data/lib/libips.so and the malware\nwas still executing, it would be able to undo the patch and maintain execution.\n\nIn addition, the extended version contains a command that allows the attackers to send\nrequests to an internal Fortinet service, possibly to modify device settings or expose internal\nparts of the associated network to the internet. BOLDMOVE reads the contents of\n```\n/dev/cmdb/vdom and parses its information to retrieve a numeric value, which may be\n\n```\n[associated with a virtual domain on the device. Then it creates a connection to “127.0.0.1”,](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.2.3/administration-guide/109991/virtual-domains)\nlocalhost, over an attacker provided port. This suggests that a server is expected to run on\nthat port locally. The command handler facilitates sending attacker-chosen data over the\nestablished connection and sending back any retrieved response back to the C2.\n\nTable 3 outlines some of the differences between the Windows and Linux variants of\nBOLDMOVE that were identified by Mandiant:\n\nTable 3: Differences between the Windows and Linux variants of BOLDMOVE\n\n**Windows** **Linux**\n\n\nCompiler C and compiled with MinGW\n\n(GCC: (GNU) 10.2.1 20210227)\n\nCompile Time: 2021-08-26 07:13:04\n\n\nC and compiled with GCC 11.2.1\n20211120\n\nCompile Time: Unknown\n\n\nSSL/TLS No Yes\n\n\n-----\n\nUserAgent **curl/6.12.34**\n\n(this is a non-public version of libcurl, last\nv6 build was 6.5; also, the malware itself\ndoes not make actual use of libcurl)\n\n\n**curl/6.12.34**\n\n\nC2 Private class C IP Address Globally routable IP Address\n\n\nSupports\nlight\nweight\nsystems\n\n\n**No**\n\n\nUses an event driven model\nwherein event callbacks are used\ninstead of threads. This is facilitated\nby a library like the one leveraged\nby the Linux variant of BOLDMOVE,\nhowever the reason for using it in\nWindows is unclear.\n\n\n**Yes**\n\nUses an event driven\nmodel, wherein event\ncallbacks are used instead\nof threads\nMusl is compiled statically\ninto the malware’s binary\nimage.Musl has been\nassociated for its lighter\nutilization of resources in\ncompraison to other libc\nvariants.\nWolfSSL that is used by\nthe malware for encrypting\ntraffic to the C2 is also\ndesigned in part with\nembedded devices in mind.\n\nEstablished sessions are\nencrypted with AES128:\n\nKey:\n<8_byte_pseudorandom_nonce>\n|| “rg8P@TD(“\n\nIV:\n<8_byte_pseudorandom_nonce>\n|| “e5sm_$Gb”\n\n\nEncryption Established connection packets are\nencrypted with Salsa20:\n\nKey: <8_byte_pseudorandom_nonce> ||\n“e8dm_$Gb”\n\n\nCampaign 0.1c#2021-08-26 15:13:01 Charlotte/c\n\n(other campaign names were\nobserved in different samples of\nthe Linux variant)\n\nThe survey and commands are functionally equivalent amongst both Linux and Windows.\n\n## Windows and Linux Variant Comparison\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 3 shows the distinction between the Windows and Linux variants of BOLDMOVE. Most\nimportantly, the Windows variant appears to have been compiled a year before the Linux\nvariants. This discrepancy in time could indicate that the attackers have been developing\nBOLDMOVE and possibly using it in the wild since that time. The differences may offer\ninsight into the functionality and intended use of the malware.\n\nThere are a few differences in choices of libraries that were statically compiled into\neach of the variants. While the WolfSSL library was used in Linux in order to encrypt\ntraffic, the Windows variant does not make use of it. In addition, the Linux version\nleverages a statically compiled Musl libc library as opposed to standard libc functions\nimported as a result of compiling the Windows variant with MinGW. The usage of the\nMusl libc in the Linux variant along with a library that facilitates an event driven\ncommunication with the C2 server, could indicate that the Linux version is generally\nintended to be used on embedded devices, and devices with low processing power.\nMandiant assesses that the BOLDMOVE Linux variant was deployed on Fortinet\ndevices after a successful exploitation of CVE-2022-42475. However, the method for\ninitial infection from the Windows variant is currently unclear. With that in mind, a\nprivate class C IP address (192.168.120[.]206) that was used in the Windows variant\ncould indicate that it was used to communicate with an infected device inside the\nnetwork following lateral movement or was merely used for testing.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nMandiant would like to acknowledge Fortinet’s assistance in sharing information,\ncoordinating, and analyzing Mandiant’s findings to verify its veracity.\n\n## Appendix A: Patches\n\nTable of patches made in memory addresses of miglogd and syslogd logging daemons on\nvarious FortiGate versions by the extended Linux version of the BOLDMOVE backdoor.\nThose patches are made seemingly in order to weaken logging mechanisms during the\nmalware’s run-time.\n\nTable 4: Patches made in memory addresses of miglogd and syslogd logging daemons on\nvarious FortiGate versions\n\n\n**FortiGate**\n**Version**\n\n\n**Address 1** **Bytes Written to**\n**Address 1**\n\n\nFG100F v7.0.5 0x1E4BFA8 E0 03 02 AA 7F 0A\n00 B9\n\n\n**Address 2** **Bytes Written to**\n**Address 2**\n\n0x25A6A50 E0 03 02 AA 1F 00\n00 71\n\n\n-----\n\nFG100F v7.0.7 0x1E88B68 E0 03 02 AA 7F 0A\n00 B9\n\n\nFG101F\nv6.4.10\n\n\n0x1A5DD80 E0 03 02 AA 7F 0A\n00 B9\n\n\nFG101F v6.4.8 0x1A2FA90 E0 03 02 AA 7F 0A\n00 B9\n\n\nFG200D\nv6.0.11\n\nFG200E\nv6.0.12\n\nFG200E\nv6.4.4\n\nFG200E\nv7.0.4\n\nFG200E\nv7.0.8\n\nFG200E\nv7.2.0\n\n\n0x1E4F9CC 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n0x1DB524D 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n0x19409FD 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n0x1E65991 48 89 D0 90 90 C7 43\n08\n\n0x1ECAE81 48 89 D0 90 90 C7 43\n08\n\n0x1F3AFD1 48 89 D0 90 90 C7 43\n08\n\n\nFG201F v6.4.7 0x1AB581D 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\nFG201F v6.4.9 0x1ABF90D 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n\nFG240D\nv6.0.12\n\nFG3H0E\nv6.2.10\n\n\n0x1E5558C 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n0x2019ABD 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n\n0x2604C90 E0 03 02 AA 1F 00\n00 71\n\n0x213C154 E0 03 02 AA 1F 00\n00 71\n\n0x20F0C00 E0 03 02 AA 1F 00\n00 71\n\n0x0EC73DF 48 89 D0 90 90 49\n89 C7\n\n0x0F03262 48 89 D0 90 90 49\n89 C5\n\n0x1FABDDA 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x25D5F31 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x2665951 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x26EB5C1 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x217156A 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x218388B 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x0EC753F 48 89 D0 90 90 49\n89 C7\n\n0x1FB826B 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n\n-----\n\nFG5H0E\nv6.0.5\n\nFG6H1E\nv6.4.8\n\nFG6H1E\nv6.4.9\n\nFG6H1E\nv7.2.1\n\nFG800D\nv6.2.10\n\nFG800D\nv6.2.11\n\nFG800D\nv7.0.8\n\nFGT5HD\nv6.4.10\n\nFGT60F\nv6.4.10\n\nFGT60F\nv6.4.4\n\nFGT60F\nv6.4.8\n\nFGT60F\nv6.4.9\n\nFGT80F\nv6.4.10\n\n\n0x1CF537D 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n0x1A1E21D 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n0x1A2862D 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n0x20AFCE1 48 89 D0 90 90 C7 43\n08\n\n0x20E18ED 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n0x20E1B2D 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n0x1F61271 48 89 D0 90 90 C7 43\n08\n\n0x1A317CD 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n0x1953248 E0 03 02 AA 7F 0A\n00 B9\n\n0x1904898 E0 03 02 AA 7F 0A\n00 B9\n\n0x192D018 E0 03 02 AA 7F 0A\n00 B9\n\n0x193B0B0 E0 03 02 AA 7F 0A\n00 B9\n\n0x19F6360 E0 03 02 AA 7F 0A\n00 B9\n\n\n0x0EBD7B0 48 89 D0 90 90 49\n89 C5\n\n0x20CE65A 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x20DF7FB 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x28BF201 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x2080AEB 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x2080D2B 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 0F\n\n0x272DCF1 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x210250B 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 7F\n\n0x1FFD6A4 E0 03 02 AA 1F 00\n00 71\n\n0x1F7BF88 E0 03 02 AA 1F 00\n00 71\n\n0x1FB7450 E0 03 02 AA 1F 00\n00 71\n\n0x1FFC304 E0 03 02 AA 1F 00\n00 71\n\n0x20ADA54 E0 03 02 AA 1F 00\n00 71\n\n\n-----\n\nVM64 v6.2.3 0x1A64193 48 89 D0 90 90 83 F8\n00\n\n## Appendix B: IOCs\n\n**Basic BOLDMOVE**\n\n\n0x0F2F646 48 89 D0 90 90 85\nC0 48\n\n\nMD5: 12e28c14bb7f7b9513a02e5857592ad7\nSHA256:\n3da407c1a30d810aaff9a04dfc1ef5861062ebdf0e6d0f6823ca682ca08c37da\n**Extended BOLDMOVE**\n\nMD5: 3191cb2e06e9a30792309813793f78b6\nSHA256:\n0184e3d3dd8f4778d192d07e2caf44211141a570d45bb47a87894c68ebebeabb\n**Windows version of BOLDMOVE**\n\nMD5: 54bbea35b095ddfe9740df97b693627b\nSHA256:\n61aae0e18c41ec4f610676680d26f6c6e1d4d5aa4e5092e40915fe806b679cd4\n\n\n-----",
