    "plain_text": "# Silence group targeting Russian Banks via Malicious CHM\n\n**[reaqta.com/2019/01/silence-group-targeting-russian-banks/](https://reaqta.com/2019/01/silence-group-targeting-russian-banks/)**\n\nIn November 2018 we followed up on a tweet mentioning a potential malicious code\ndisseminated in CHM (Microsoft Compiled HTML Help). A preliminary analysis caught the\nattention of our Threat Analysis and Intelligence team as it yielded interesting data that,\namong other things, shows that the attack campaign was targeting employees from financial\nentities, specifically in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. We conclude that\nthe actor behind the attack is Silence group, a relatively new threat actor that’s been\n[operating since mid-2016. The list of targeted entities we’ve identified so far includes:](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/threat-research/silence.html)\n\n**NBD Bank Russia: Russian bank offering retail and commercial services.**\n**Zapsibkombank (Zapadno-Sibirskiy Kommercheskiy Bank): West Siberian**\nCommercial Bank (WSCB). Russia.\n**FPB (Finprombank): Russia.**\n**MSP Bank (МСП Банк): Russian Federation State Bank, focuses on providing**\nfinancing to small and medium enterprises.\n**MT Bank (МТБанк): Meridian trade Bank, the only Belarus-based bank entity in the**\nfocus of this threat.\n\n\n-----\n\nMap of targeted entities\nThe main vector is represented by a malicious CHM file. Despite being an “obsolete” format,\nCHM has been effectively used in the past to run malicious code. In this case it is used to\ndownload components that are part of the infection chain, in addition to running native OS\nbinaries to collect information related to its targets.\n\n## Silence Group Dissemination Strategy\n\nThe attack begins with the dissemination of spear-phishing emails in russian language, with\na compressed attachment called “Contract_12112018.Z” (Contract November 12, 2018).\n\nThe uncompressed file is called “Contract_12112018.chm” and its content is related to a\n_Resolution to Open Bank Accounts, its execution represents the first step of the infection_\nprocess.\n\n\n-----\n\nSpear-phishing attachment the CHM malicious file and “Contract_12112018.chm” file content\nThe spear-phishing were sent from (spoofed) official addresses belonging to different\nRussian banking entities, in our case the majority belonged to the Central Bank of the\n_Russian Federation, and the email content was related to alleged regulations “On unifying_\n_the format of electronic banking messages of the Bank of Russia“._\n\nThe email shown above translates to:\n\n_“Good day!_\n\n_I, Skurtov Andrei Vladimirovich,_\n\n_Head of Interbank Operations and_\n\n_Correspondent Relations of PJSC “FinServisBank”._\n\n_We negotiated the opening and maintenance of correspondent accounts in rubles and freely_\n_convertible currencies._\n\n_I ask you to consider the application as soon as possible to open and maintain accounts._\n\n_I attach the archive with the contract. Please fill it in and send it to me._\n\n_Thank you in advance, waiting for an answer._\n\n_Respectfully,_\n\n_Head of Interbank Operations and_\n\n_Correspondent Relations of PJSC “FinserviceBank”_\n\n_Nizhny Novgorod region, Sarov, Silkin street, 13”_\n\n## Malicious components\n\nIn the following graph we have reconstructed the complete CHM infection chain used by\nSilence group, divided in three main stages:\n\n1. Download of the initial payload (VBScript) necessary to start the infection chain.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Activities performed by the initial payload on the infected computer, and download of\n\nthe main malware component.\n3. Information gathering and delivering to C&C.\n\nCHM infection chain\nThe Compiled HTML Help file (contract_12112018.chm), whose file structure is similar to that\nof a hypertext page, is opened through the native Microsoft Windows program “hh.exe”. The\nCHM file contains a HTM file called “start.htm“ that runs once the file is opened\nand contains the malicious payload, used to start cmd.exe and mshta.exe to download a\nmalicious VBscript (called “li”) from the IP 146.0.72.139. This is the first stage of the infection\nchain.\n\nThe following image shows in detail the command line used to start mshta which downloads\nand runs the malicious VBS file:\n\n\n-----\n\nContent of the HTM file embedded in the malicious CHM file\nThe second stage of the infection chain continues with the execution of the instructions\ncontained in the “li” file, which is basically responsible for:\n\nMaking a copy of cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe, renaming them to ejpejpff.com and\n_ejpejpf.com respectively, and saving them in %TEMP% folder._\nInvoking ejpejpf.com (which is a copy of Powershell.exe) with the parameters -nop -W\n**hidden -noninteractive -c to:**\n\ndownload the “flk” payload, encoded in Base64, and save it to the %TEMP%\nfolder as “ejpejp.txt“,\ndecode and save it as “ejpejp.com”\nexecute “ejpejp.com”\n\nContent of the li file\nThe third and last stage of the infection chain continues with the execution\nof “ejpejp.com”, responsible for:\n\nDuplicating itself in \\AppData\\Roaming\\ as conhost.exe, the same filename typically\nused by the legitimate “Console Windows Host”, probably for evasion\n\n\n-----\n\nAdding the reference to\n**HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run as a**\npersistence method\nRunning System Information Discovery\n\nThe metadata description of the malicious file is “MS DefenderApplicationController”.\nWe have identified this application as a variant of the trojan used by the Silence group that\nis responsible for gathering information about each victim’s computer, collected by running\nfour Windows system binaries:\n\n**system.exe: “System Information” is executed to collect detailed information about the**\nvictim’s computer configuration and the operating system’s details, such as: product ID,\nhardware features and security information.\n**net.exe: “Net View” is used to collect information about the local area network and to**\nstart/stop the IPv6 protocol service.\n**whoami.exe: Used to obtain the user’s current domain and username**\n**ipconfig.exe: Used to collect TCP / IP network configuration settings.**\n\nAll this information is stored in the file “INFOCONTENT.TXT“, saved in %ProgramData% and\nuploaded to the server hosted at the IP 146.0.72.188 that is Silence group’s Command and\nControl (C2) for this threat. Below is the storyline of the attack reconstructed using ReaQtaHive.\n\nMalicious CHM storytline reconstructed with ReaQta-Hive (click to expand)\n[The full chain of attack is available on VirusTotal as a behavioral report (click on the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1135813663bf9c747a1cca7312aef97d345d231df5cdeb314cb8606017d26d86/behavior/ReaQta-Hive)\ndocument icon right of ReaQta-Hive).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Network Infrastructure\n\nAs shown above, the threat runs several native binaries to collect useful information for its\n_recon phase. That is, these data are processed by Silence group to produce intelligence_\nabout the infrastructure of the targeted banking entities.\nThe communication process is carried out using two IP addresses. The first one is\n**146.0.72.139 which is the direct channel for downloading different parts of the attack chain.**\nThe second one communicates with the command and control by using the IP address\n**146.0.72.188 to exfiltrate the information collected. Both IPs are hosted in Netherlands.**\n\nMalicious network request process\n\n## Attribution\n\nAs usual attribution is never easy and we would like to share the elements that lead us to\nthink Silence group is behind this attack:\n\nThe modus operandi and the infection vector (CHM) is a typical trait of Silence’s latest\noperations\nThe inner structure of CHM is common to previous attacks from Silence group\nDownloaded binaries match with those used by Silence (a variant of Truebot)\nLanguage used in the spear-phishing campaign is a match\nTargets are located in Eastern Europe and Russia\n\n\n-----\n\nType of targets (financial institutions) match with the targets usually chosen by Silence\ngroup\nThe TTPs identified in previous attacks from Silence group are a match with the attack\nanalysed here\n\nThese elements led us to the conclusion that, with high likelihood, Silence (or an affiliated\ngroup) is behind these attacks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe intelligence we have collected shows that this attack is part of a more extensive\noperation, still focused on financial institutions operating mainly on Russian territory. The\ninfection process, attack chain and the way the operation is structured, shows that Silence\ngroup, though still young, is an increasingly more organized and dangerous banking malware\ndistribution entity.\n\n[Our analysis has been conducted using ReaQta-Hive: endpoint visibility and threat hunting](https://upstream.rqt.io/hive/)\ncapabilities are a requirement for every organization that aims at mitigating the risk of cyber\nattacks. Such threats show how fast and adaptable attackers are and that a structured\nprocess to detect, contain and respond is essential to prevent damages and interruption to\nbusiness continuity.\n\n## Mitre Att&ck\n\nT1193 : Spearphishing Attachment\nT1223 : Compiled HTML File\nT1105 : Remote File Copy\nT1043 : Commonly Used Port\nT1170 : Mshta\nT1036 : Masquerading\nT1059 : Command-Line Interface\nT1086 : Powershell\nT1064 : Scripting\nT1140 : Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\nT1060 : Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\nT1082 : System Information Discovery\n\n## IOCs\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSHA1 CHM files\n20055FC3F1DB35B279F15D398914CABA11E5AD9D\nD83D27BC15E960DD50EAD02F70BD442593E92427\n2250174B8998A787332C198FC94DB4615504D771\n9D4BBE09A09187756533EE6F5A6C2258F6238773\nD167B13988AA0B277426489F343A484334A394D0\n26A8CFB5F03EAC0807DD4FD80E80DBD39A7FD8A6\nSHA1 Dropped files\n290321C1A00F93CDC55B1A22DA629B3FCF192101\n2CD620CEA310B0EDB68E4BB27301B2563191287B\nE5CB1BE1A22A7BF5816ED16C5644119B51B07837\nIPs\n146.0.72.139\n146.0.72.188\n\n```\n\n-----",
