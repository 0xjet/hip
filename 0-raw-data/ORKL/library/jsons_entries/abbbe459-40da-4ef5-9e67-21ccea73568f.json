    "plain_text": "# LokiLocker, a Ransomware Similar to BlackBit Being Distributed in Korea\n\n**asec.ahnlab.com/en/52570/**\n\nBy AhnLab_en May 15, 2023\n\nAhnLab Security Emergency response Center(ASEC) has confirmed the distribution of the\nLokiLocker ransomware in Korea. This ransomware is almost identical to the BlackBit\nransomware and their common traits have been mentioned before in a previous blog post. A\nsummary of these similarities is as follows.\n\n## Similarities Between LokiLocker and BlackBit\n\nDisguised as svchost.exe\nSame obfuscation tool used (.NET Reactor)\nRegistered to the task scheduler and registry (persistence of malware)\nRansom note and the new file icon image set after encryption\n\n[BlackBit Ransomware Being Distributed in Korea](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/51497/)\n\n**Disguised as svchost.exe**\n\nThe BlackBit ransomware, which was covered in a previous post, disguised itself as a\nsvchost.exe file. Similarly, the recently discovered LokiLocker ransomware was also found\ndisguised as a svchost.exe file.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Same packer used (.NET Reactor)**\n\nA .NET Reactor was used to obfuscate the code and deter analysis. By looking at the\nunpacked BlackBit ransomware, it becomes clear that the malware was derived from the\nLokiLocker ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Registered to the task scheduler and registry (persistence of malware)**\n\nSimilarities have also been found in their behavioral aspects. The following figure shows that\nthe LokiLocker ransomware registers itself to the task scheduler and registry under the\nname”Loki” before it starts its encryption process. The ransomware also generates its\n\n\n-----\n\nransom note before it begins encrypting. Afterward, it carries out actions such as deleting\nvolume shadows to prevent recovery, as well as behaviors aimed at obstructing detection\nand leaking information.\n\n**Ransom note and the new file icon image set after encryption**\n\nAfter successfully infecting a system, LokiLocker creates a ransom note named Restore-MyFiles.txt in each infected folder path, containing the message below. The ransom note and\nthe icon of the infected files that have been confirmed were also found to be very similar to\nthose of the BlackBit ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nAhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, detects and responds to LokiLocker ransomware with a\nvariety of detection points, including file detection and behavior-based detection. To prevent\nransomware infection, users must be cautious of running files from unknown sources and\nmake sure to scan suspicious files with an anti-malware program while also keeping the\nprogram updated to the latest version. AhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, detects and\nblocks the malware using the following aliases:\n\n[File Detection]\n\nRansomware/Win.Loki.C5421356 (2023.05.03.00)\n\n[Behavior Detection]\n\nRansom/MDP.Delete.M2117\n\n[IOC]\n\nd03823a205919b6927f3fa3164be5ac5\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n\n-----\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information-en/)\n\n[Tagged as:Ransomware](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/ransomware-en/)\n\n\n-----",
