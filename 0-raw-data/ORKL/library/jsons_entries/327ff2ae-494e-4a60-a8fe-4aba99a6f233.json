Infinitum IT\ncontacted the victims to return the stolen data.\n\nThe researchers noticed that the Conti member whose accounts they breached was using\nthe FileZilla FTP client to connect to multiple servers for uploading and downloading stolen\ndata.\n\nOne connection was to the IP address 209[.]222[.]98[.]19, which is where the Karakurt\nextortion group hosted their site where they published stolen data from non-paying victims.\n\n[BleepingComputer learned months ago from Vitali Kremez of Advanced Intelligence that](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nKarakurt is a side business of the Conti syndicate to monetize from failed encryption\nattacks.\n\nWhen Conti's ransomware payload is blocked and the attack does not enter the encryption\nstage, the hackers release the already exfiltrated information as Karakurt for data extortion.\n\n[This was confirmed today in a report from cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf stating that,](https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/karakurt-web)\nduring an investigation at a client that had previously paid Conti to unlock their data, found\nthat said client was later breached by Karakurt via a Cobalt Strike backdoor that Conti had\nleft behind.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe research from Arctic Wolf is a collaboration between its computer security service Tetra\nDefense, cybersecurity company Northwave and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis and\nit follows clues from more than a dozen Karakurt incidents and from cryptocurrency\ntransactions involving Conti and Karakurt operators.\n\nChainalysis' investigation revealed several Karakurt wallets that sent cryptocurrency to\nwallets controlled by Conti. According to the researchers, payments from victims are\nbetween $45,000 and $1 million.\n\nThe blockchain analyitics company also found Karakurt victim payment addresses hosted\nby a Conti wallet, indicating that both gangs are managed by the same party.\n\n## Accessing Karakurt servers\n\nWhile the Conti admin did not save the passwords in the FTP client, Infinitum IT\nresearchers say that they were able to obtain the SSH credentials for the Karakurt\ncommand and control (C2) server by exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in FileZilla.\n\nThe researchers also obtained this way an SSH private key that allowed connecting to the\nKarakurt gang’s web server for their leak site, which is also served over the TOR network\n\n\n-----\n\n_source: Infinitum IT_\nAccording to Infinitum IT’s analysis, members of the Karakurt gang upload stolen data to a\n“/work” folder and categorize it as public and non-public, their interest being mainly in\nfinancial information.\n\nAs Infinitum IT completely compromised the Karakurt gang’s infrastructure, they were also\nable to access the C2 server and the tools used in attacks.\n\n_source: Infinitum IT_\nBelow is an enumeration of the utilities Karakurt uses in attacks and their description:\n\n[Ligolo-ng: tunneling and pivoting tool](https://github.com/tnpitsecurity/ligolo-ng)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Metasploit: used as a C2 server in the post-exploitation phase for obtaining reverse](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework)\nshell and for brute-forcing SMB shares and RDP connections\n[Impacket: used for NTLM-relay attacks for lateral movement after getting initial access](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)\n[Danted: auto-install and management script for Danted–Socks5 Proxy Server, for](https://github.com/Lozy/danted)\nreverse tunneling\n\nInfinitum IT’s report is the first public evidence showing that Conti ransomware and the\nKarakurt data extortion gang are part of the same financially-motivated group.\n\nAfter Conti [took over the infamous TrickBot botnet and shut it down to focus on the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-gang-takes-over-trickbot-malware-operation/)\ndevelopment of BazarBackdoor and Anchor malware, researchers show that the\nsyndicate’s expansion is more aggressive.\n\nConti is now managing side businesses that either sustain its ransomware operations or\nmonetize the initial network access already available.\n\n**_Update [March 15, 11:54 EST]: Article updated with information from cybersecurity_**\ncompany Arctic Wolf confirming that Karakurt and Conti are part of the same operation.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - April 15th 2022 - Encrypting Russia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-april-15th-2022-encrypting-russia/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[Conti ransomware shuts down operation, rebrands into smaller units](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shuts-down-operation-rebrands-into-smaller-units/)\n\n[Conti](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/conti/)\n[Extortion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/extortion/)\n[Karakurt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/karakurt/)\n[ProtonMail](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/protonmail/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Server](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/server/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
