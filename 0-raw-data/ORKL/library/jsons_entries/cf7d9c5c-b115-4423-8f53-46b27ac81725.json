Unlike other ransomwares, DearCry is special in terms of its complexity. It is very simple malware,\nand it could be reverse engineered in couple of minutes as we demonstrate in this paper. The main objective\nof this document is to provide not only the analysis of DearCry ransomware, but also to provide educational\ntips and tricks, which could be useful in the cybersecurity community and students of computer science.\n\n\n## STATIC ANALYSIS\n\n\nStatic analysis is usually the initial stage of malware analysis. Commonly the samples are scanned with\nantivirus software and IOC scanners. This phase also includes the analysis of sample metadata, embedded\nstrings, resources, imports and exports (in case of Portable executable files, .EXE), presence of macros and\nauto-open or auto-close actions (in case of Office Documents).\n\n\n#### DearCry Sample\n\n\nIn this paper we analyze DearCry ransomware sample (often classified also as DoejoCrypt) obtained from\nMalware Bazaar. It is a portable executable file, and it is approximately 1.2 MB in size. This means that it\nis relatively large malware sample.\n\nFigure 1: DearCry Metadata from Malware Bazaar repository\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Strings\n\n\nDearCry is very simple ransomware, as we can see even by extraction of the embedded strings. We use\nSysinternals tool called strings.exe.\n\nFigure 2: Extracted strings with ransom note template and name of the ransomware.\n\nThere is no obfuscation, all strings are clearly visible. For example, the ransom note. The sample leaks\nsome debug information about its origin, too. From the PDB filepath we can determine the username, used\ndevelopment tools and original name of the project.\n\nFigure 3: Extracted strings with RSA public key and file extensions to be encrypted\n\nRSA Public key is visible here, and also the list of file extensions. DearCry ransomware will probably encrypt\nfiles with these extensions, as we will see later.\n\n\nDearCry is very simple ransomware, as we can see even by extraction of the embedded strings. We use\nSysinternals tool called strings.exe.\n\nFigure 2: Extracted strings with ransom note template and name of the ransomware.\n\nThere is no obfuscation, all strings are clearly visible. For example, the ransom note. The sample leaks\nsome debug information about its origin, too. From the PDB filepath we can determine the username, used\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Capabilities\n\n\nAs a next step, we can quickly identify capabilities in the analyzed sample with the capa tool. There is lot\nof cryptography, ciphers, hashes. And it is linked against OpenSSL cryptography library.\n\nFigure 4: Sample overview reported by capa tool\n\nFigure 5: Sample capabilities - file operations; OpenSSL crypto library used.\n\n\n-----\n\n## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS\n\n\nDuring behavioral analysis, the sample is executed in sandbox. This protected environment is monitored\nfor any activities performed by the sample, such as spawning new processes, network communication,\ndropping files or overwriting the existent files. By reviewing of sample’s behavior, we can often say if the\nsample is malicious and if yes, what kind of malware it is (e.g., ransomware).\n\nWith behavioral analysis we can also quickly collect lot of indicators of compromise (IOC) which could be\nused by rest of the team for effective incident response, forensic analysis, threat hunting or for monitoring\nand prevent threats in the customers’ infrastructure.\n\nFor now, in this paper we skip this step right now, because we already know that this is a DearCry\nransomware sample which encrypts files. We will rather deep dive into the DearCry internals and code. We\nwill demonstrate the process of reverse engineering the malware. However, we will later do a crosscheck\nof our findings with output from the sandbox, in this case, just for educational purposes.\n\n\n## REVERSE ENGINEERING\n\n\nReverse engineering is the phase in which we decompile or disassemble the machine instructions of\nprogram into more readable form. In this case, analyzed sample is a Portable Executable file produced by\nMicrosoft Visual Studio compiler. We use IDA, Interactive Disassembler, for reverse engineering of this\nDearCry sample.\n\n\n#### IDA Flirt Signatures\n\n\nWhen IDA finished its automatic analysis, we can see disassembled program with lot of functions. By\ndefault, almost all functions are assumed to be regular (blue color in program navigation bar), without\nknown library functions (light cyan in navigation bar). We can fix this by applying IDA's FLIRT signatures,\nfor example, Microsoft Visual C runtime signatures identified more than 600 functions. But there is still very\nsmall portion of all functions.\n\nFigure 6: Applied IDA FLIRT Signatures and Program overview in Navigation Bar\n\nRecall that capa tool identified that this sample is linked against OpenSSL, and there are many strings\ncontaining the OpenSSL term. It seems that DearCry is statically linked against OpenSSL version 1.1.\n\n\nFigure 6: Applied IDA FLIRT Signatures and Program overview in Navigation Bar\n\nRecall that capa tool identified that this sample is linked against OpenSSL, and there are many strings\ncontaining the OpenSSL term. It seems that DearCry is statically linked against OpenSSL version 1.1.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: GitHub repository with FLIRT signatures for OpenSSL\n\n\nWe can obtain the signatures for OpenSSL from the community driven collection of IDA FLIRT signature\nfiles. They are available for couple of common libraries. We will download and use two which fits most to\nour case - OpenSSL 1.1 compiled by Visual Studio 2008, as we saw in the extracted strings. With these two\nFLIRT signatures applied, we have identified more than 3000 of library functions. Now it seems that only\nsmall portion of DearCry functions is custom, developed by authors of the ransomware.\n\nFigure 8: Applied IDA FLIRT Signatures for OpenSSL library\n\nWhen we examine imports, they are mostly related to cryptography, because of dependencies of embedded\nOpenSSL library. On the other hand, there is only one exported symbol called start, which is the usual entry\npoint of portable executable files.\n\n\nFigure 8: Applied IDA FLIRT Signatures for OpenSSL library\n\nWhen we examine imports, they are mostly related to cryptography, because of dependencies of embedded\nOpenSSL library. On the other hand, there is only one exported symbol called start, which is the usual entry\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Ransomware Logic\n\n\n##### Entry Point\n\nNow we are ready to begin with analysis of disassembled code. Our objective is to understand what the\nanalyzed program does and how it works.\n\nFigure 9: Start routine of the analyzed sample\n\nThis is more less standard start routine, with checking for “MZ” (5A4Dh) and “PE” executable headers, then\nparsing command line arguments and set environment variables. After that, near to the end of start routine,\nthere is a call with three arguments. This is the main function of the programs developed in C or C++.\n\n\nthere is a call with three arguments. This is the main function of the programs developed in C or C++.\n\nFigure 10: End of the start routine with call to main function\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Main Function\n\nThe main function is simple. It starts service control dispatcher, which connects the main service thread to\nthe service control manager. The service related to this ransomware is called “msupdate”.\n\nFigure 11: Disassembled main function of the ransomware sample\n\n##### ServiceMain Function\n\nServiceMain function is also simple, it registers service control handler for this “msupdate” service. And\nthen, it calls yet unknown function sub_401D10.\n\n\nthe service control manager. The service related to this ransomware is called “msupdate”.\n\nFigure 11: Disassembled main function of the ransomware sample\n\n##### ServiceMain Function\n\n\n-----\n\nBack in main function, we can see that the same sub_401D10 function is called right after service\ndispatcher. It seems that this function is responsible for all malicious things performed by this ransomware\nsample. Hence, it will probably do some ransomware stuff.\n\n##### “Do-ransomware-stuff” Function\n\nFigure 13: \"do_ransomware_stuff\" function called from main and ServiceMain functions\n\nLet's look into the ransomware stuff function. First interesting function is sub_401000. It references the\nembedded RSA Public Key and creates string with hexadecimal representation of some values in loop. It\nactually creates a formatted string with hash value of RSA key.\n\n\nembedded RSA Public Key and creates string with hexadecimal representation of some values in loop. It\nactually creates a formatted string with hash value of RSA key.\n\nFigure 14: Obtaining the hexadecimal representation of the embedded RSA Public Key’s hash value\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the ransomware stuff function then prepares a formatted ransom note message and get list of logical\ndrives of the infected machine. It searches for drives with letters between C and Z included, and all types\nof drive except CD-ROM drive.\n\nFigure 15: Preparation of formatted ransom note message in the ransomware stuff function\n\nFigure 16: Enumeration of logical drives of the infected machine\n\nAfter that, it passes each drive to the function sub_401640, which will probably be responsible for\nencrypting drive or folder.\n\n\nFigure 15: Preparation of formatted ransom note message in the ransomware stuff function\n\nFigure 16: Enumeration of logical drives of the infected machine\n\nAfter that, it passes each drive to the function sub_401640, which will probably be responsible for\nencrypting drive or folder.\n\n\nFigure 15: Preparation of formatted ransom note message in the ransomware stuff function\n\nFigure 16: Enumeration of logical drives of the infected machine\n\nAfter that, it passes each drive to the function sub_401640, which will probably be responsible for\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: Hypothesis: function sub_401640 is responsible for encrypting drive or folder and creation of readme.txt\n\nfile with ransom note\n\nThen, this ransomware stuff function drops readme.txt file with the ransom note. And finally, the last call\nwill delete service “msupdate”, created by this ransomware previously.\n\n\nThen, this ransomware stuff function drops readme.txt file with the ransom note. And finally, the last call\nwill delete service “msupdate”, created by this ransomware previously.\n\nFigure 18: Removing msupdate service created by this ransomware previously\n\n\nFigure 17: Hypothesis: function sub_401640 is responsible for encrypting drive or folder and creation of readme.txt\n\nfile with ransom note\n\n\n-----\n\n#### File Encryption\n\n\nUntil now, we used top-down methodology for analysis of ransomware logic. Now we can change our\napproach and use bottom-up methodology instead of top-down.\n\n##### Encrypt-file Function\n\nDuring static analysis we saw string “.CRYPT”, which looks like an extension of the files encrypted by this\nransomware. Let's examine the cross references to this string in IDA. It is referenced only in one function;\nthus this function should be responsible for writing an encrypted file to disk.\n\nFigure 19:Cross references to \".CRYPT\" and creating the encrypted file by ransomware\n\nLet us examine this encrypt file function. Mode “rb+” means that the original file is opened for updating.\nTo be more specific, for reading and writing. The “wb” mode means, that file with “.CRYPT” extension is\nopened for writing. Hence, DearCry uses copy encryption instead of in-place encryption of files, and it is\nsimilar to the infamous WannaCry ransomware.\n\nIn the picture below we can see that DearCry ransomware prepends a “DEARCRY!” marker to the beginning\nof the encrypted .CRYPT files.\n\n\nFigure 19:Cross references to \".CRYPT\" and creating the encrypted file by ransomware\n\nLet us examine this encrypt file function. Mode “rb+” means that the original file is opened for updating.\nTo be more specific, for reading and writing. The “wb” mode means, that file with “.CRYPT” extension is\nopened for writing. Hence, DearCry uses copy encryption instead of in-place encryption of files, and it is\nsimilar to the infamous WannaCry ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20: DEARCRY! file marker and encryption of AES key with RSA\n\n##### OpenSSL Encryption: RSA+AES\n\nThe ransomware uses OpenSSL for generating a random key for symmetric encryption (AES-256-CBC) and\nencrypts this symmetric key with RSA using the embedded public key (2048-bit length):\n```\n -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY---- MIIBCAKCAQEA5+mVBe75OvCzCW4oZHl7vqPwV2O4kgzgfp9odcL9LZc8Gy2+NJPD\n wrHbttKI3z4Yt3G04lX7bEp1RZjxUYfzX8qvaPC2EBduOjSN1WMSbJJrINs1Izkq\n XRrggJhSbp881Jr6NmpE6pns0Vfv//Hk1idHhxsXg6QKtfXlzAnRbgA1WepSDJq5\n H08WGFBZrgUVM0zBYI3JJH3b9jIRMVQMJUQ57w3jZpOnpFXSZoUy1YD7Y3Cu+n/Q\n 6cEft6t29/FQgacXmeA2ajb7ssSbSntBpTpoyGc/kKoaihYPrHtNRhkMcZQayy5a\n XTgYtEjhzJAC+esXiTYqklWMXJS1EmUpoQIBAw==\n -----END RSA PUBLIC KEY----\n```\nFigure 21:Prime factors of 2048-bit RSA public key\n\nThen, the encrypted symmetric key is written as a part of header of the encrypted file after the “DEARCRY!”\nmarker.\n\n\nFigure 20: DEARCRY! file marker and encryption of AES key with RSA\n\n##### OpenSSL Encryption: RSA+AES\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22: OpenSSL functions for encryption. sub_402F00 has not been identified by used FLIRT signature\n\nIn the Figure 22 there are calls to OpenSSL’s functions _EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new, _EVP_CipherInit_ex and\nsub_402F00, which has not been recognized by used FLIRT signature, but this function should return the\ntype of encryption to be used. Let’s identify this function manually by quick review of OpenSSL library and\nits usage in DearCry ransomware.\n\nFrom the OpenSSL documentation, the first two parameters of EVP_CipherInit_ex are context\n(EVP_CIPHER_CTX) and type (EVP_CIPHER):\n```\n int EVP_CipherInit_ex(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx, const EVP_CIPHER *type,\n ENGINE *impl, const unsigned char *key, const unsigned char *iv, int enc);\n\n```\nExample usage of this function could look like this:\n```\n EVP_CIPHER_CTX ctx;\n EVP_CIPHER_CTX_init(&ctx);\n EVP_CipherInit_ex(&ctx, EVP_rc4(), NULL, &key, &iv, 1);\n\n```\nThe EVP_rc4() function is the example of candidate for the unknown function sub_402F00. Actually,\nfunctions such as EVP_rc4() are very simple, they contain only couple of instructions which return the\nobject describing the type of the cipher, as is depicted in the Figure 23.\n\nFigure 23: EVP_Cipher type object returned by sub_402F00\n\nThe first value (427) is something called NID, numbered value of ASN.1 object identifier. The NID value of\n427 is associated with the AES-256-CBC cipher.\n\nFigure 24: Identification of AES-256-CBC encryption used by DearCry ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Put it all together\n\n\nSo, what have we analyzed? It seems that the chain between start or main function and encrypt_file\nfunction is almost completely analyzed, except one function, sub_4015D0; see Figure 25.\n\nFigure 25: Function graph with already analyzed functions\n\n##### Check-marker Function\n\nLet’s focus on function sub_4015D0. This time, a file is opened in read mode, and handle to this file is\npassed to another function, sub_4010C0. It reads first 8 bytes and compare them with the string DearCry.\nAfter that, it performs additional checks. Therefore, it checks header and marker and verifies if file is already\nencrypted by the ransomware. After these checks by check_marker function (originally sub_4010C0), the\nactual encrypt file function is executed depending on the results of checks.\n\n\nSo, what have we analyzed? It seems that the chain between start or main function and encrypt_file\nfunction is almost completely analyzed, except one function, sub_4015D0; see Figure 25.\n\nFigure 25: Function graph with already analyzed functions\n\n##### Check-marker Function\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, we just analyzed another two functions, for checking files and “DEARCRY!” markers before encryption\nitself. But we also see now, that the encrypt drive/folder function calls itself recursively, and it seems that\nit will be rather function for encrypting folders instead of drives only.\n\nFigure 27: Function graph related to the files encryption and recursive function encrypt_drive/folder\n\n##### Encrypt-folder Function\n\nLet's dive into the encrypt_folder function. It uses Find first file and find next file API calls for searching\nfiles in current directory. For files with extension from the aforementioned list of extensions, it calls already\nanalyzed encryption function.\n\n\nit will be rather function for encrypting folders instead of drives only.\n\nFigure 27: Function graph related to the files encryption and recursive function encrypt_drive/folder\n\n\nFigure 26: Checking the “DEARCRY!” file marker in sub_4010C0, followed by encrypt_file in sub_4015D0\n\nSo, we just analyzed another two functions, for checking files and “DEARCRY!” markers before encryption\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 28: Encrypt_folder function uses Win32 API calls FindFirstFileA and FindNextFileA\n\n\nFigure 29: Checking of file extensions to encrypt\n\n##### ReportServiceStatus Function\n\nNow there is only one not yet analyzed function, sub_401C10. Quick look into it reveals that it is kind of\nreport service status for indicating the service state.\n\n\nFigure 28: Encrypt_folder function uses Win32 API calls FindFirstFileA and FindNextFileA\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 30: Last custom function - ReportServiceStatus\n\n\nNow we have analyzed every regular function written by authors of the ransomware and we have rather\ngood understanding what this ransomware does and how it works.\n\nFigure 31: Function graph of analyzed functions reveals the program logic, too\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Cross-check with behavioral analysis\n\n\nWe can cross-check our results with the results from the behavioral analysis previously performed in\nsandbox. For example, the encrypted files with the CRYPT extension and DearCry marker in its beginning\nare clearly visible in the results.\n\nFigure 32: File with .CRYPT extension and \"DEARCRY!\" file marker\n\nAlso, file readme.txt contains the formatted ransom note message including the contact emails and hash\nof the RSA key.\n\n\nWe can cross-check our results with the results from the behavioral analysis previously performed in\nsandbox. For example, the encrypted files with the CRYPT extension and DearCry marker in its beginning\nare clearly visible in the results.\n\nFigure 32: File with .CRYPT extension and \"DEARCRY!\" file marker\n\n\n-----\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n\nWe introduced several principles of malware analysis and demonstrated them during the analysis of DearCry\nransomware sample, which has been used in connection with the recent attacks on vulnerable Microsoft\nExchange servers.\n\nDuring this analysis, we spent most of the time with reverse engineering, including top-down and bottomup methodologies for analysis of unknown programs. As a result, we provided overview of DearCry\nransomware’s logic and in-depth analysis of files encryption. We also covered all of the functions written\nby authors of this ransomware.\n\nLast, but not least, if somebody is interested and wants to do his own analyze of DearCry ransomware, the\nanalyzed sample is available on Malware Bazaar website and this paper can be used as a walkthrough for\neducational purposes.\n\n\n## RESOURCES\n\n\n\n- DearCry Sample at Malware Bazaar\n\n- Analysis in Any.Run sandbox\n\n- LIFARS Video from the analysis and reverse engineering of DearCry ransomware sample\n\n- https://lifars.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Microsoft-Exchange-case-study.pdf\n\n- Sysinternals strings tool\n\n- FireEye capa tool\n\n- Hex-Rays IDA Freeware Disassembler\n\n- GitHub repository with community FLIRT signatures for IDA\n\n- OpenSSL EVP_CipherInit documentation\n\n\n-----\n\n## APPENDIX\n\n\n#### Sample Information\n\n|File Name|e044d9f2d0f1260c3f4a543a1e67f33fcac265be114a1b135fd575b860d2b8c6.bin|\n|---|---|\n|File Size|1,322,496 bytes|\n|Mime Type|application/x-dosexec|\n|File Type|PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows|\n|MD5 hash|cdda3913408c4c46a6c575421485fa5b|\n|SHA1 hash|56eec7392297e7301159094d7e461a696fe5b90f|\n|SHA256 hash|e044d9f2d0f1260c3f4a543a1e67f33fcac265be114a1b135fd575b860d2b8c6|\n|SSDeep hash|24576:C5Nv2SkWFP/529IC8u2bAs0NIzkQS+KpPbEasBY2iKDl1fpxkLVZgMCS+: oB70s9yjE62iIl1fpxkLVZgMC3|\n|Imphash|f8b8e20e844ccd50a8eb73c2fca3626d|\n\n\n#### List of File Extensions\n\n\nDearCry ransomware encrypts the files with the following extensions:\n```\n .TIF .TIFF .PDF .XLS .XLSX .XLTM .PS .PPS .PPT .PPTX .DOC .DOCX .LOG .MSG\n .RTF .TEX .TXT .CAD .WPS .EML .INI .CSS .HTM .HTML .XHTML .JS .JSP .PHP\n .KEYCHAIN .PEM .SQL .APK .APP .BAT .CGI .ASPX .CER .CFM .C .CPP .GO\n .CONFIG.CSV .DAT .ISO .PST .PGD .7Z .RAR .ZIP .ZIPX .TAR .PDB .BIN .DB\n .MDB .MDF .BAK .LOG .EDB .STM .DBF .ORA\n\n```\n\n#### RSA Public Key\n\n```\n-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY----MIIBCAKCAQEA5+mVBe75OvCzCW4oZHl7vqPwV2O4kgzgfp9odcL9LZc8Gy2+NJPD\nwrHbttKI3z4Yt3G04lX7bEp1RZjxUYfzX8qvaPC2EBduOjSN1WMSbJJrINs1Izkq\nXRrggJhSbp881Jr6NmpE6pns0Vfv//Hk1idHhxsXg6QKtfXlzAnRbgA1WepSDJq5\nH08WGFBZrgUVM0zBYI3JJH3b9jIRMVQMJUQ57w3jZpOnpFXSZoUy1YD7Y3Cu+n/Q\n6cEft6t29/FQgacXmeA2ajb7ssSbSntBpTpoyGc/kKoaihYPrHtNRhkMcZQayy5a\nXTgYtEjhzJAC+esXiTYqklWMXJS1EmUpoQIBAw==\n-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY----\n```\n\n#### Ransomnote\n\n```\nYour file has been encrypted!\n                       If you want to decrypt, please contact us.\n                       konedieyp@airmail.cc or uenwonken@memail.com\n                       And please send me the following hash!\n                       d37fc1eabc6783a418d23a8d2ba5db5a\n\n```\n\n-----",
