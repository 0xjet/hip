Now, one of these 21st-century\nmercenaries, called the NSO Group, is attempting to cloak itself in the legal immunity\nafforded its government customers, which would shield it from accountability when its\nweapons inflict harm on innocent people and businesses. The firm also contributes to the\n[urgent cybersecurity challenges discussed by our president Brad Smith last week. We](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/)\nbelieve the NSO Group’s business model is dangerous and that such immunity would enable\nit and other PSOAs to continue their dangerous business without legal rules, responsibilities\n[or repercussions. That’s why today we filed an amicus brief – along with Cisco, GitHub,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2020/12/NSO-v.-WhatsApp-Amicus-Brief-Microsoft-et-al.-as-filed.pdf)\nGoogle, LinkedIn, VMWare and the Internet Association – in a legal case brought by\nWhatsApp against the NSO Group.\n\nThe NSO Group sold governments a program called Pegasus, which could be installed on a\ndevice simply by calling the device via WhatsApp; the device’s owner did not even have to\nanswer. According to WhatsApp, the NSO Group used Pegasus to access more than 1,400\nmobile devices, including those belonging to journalists and human rights defenders. We\nbelieve companies like NSO Group selling tools like Pegasus are concerning for three\nreasons.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, their presence increases the risk that the weapons they create fall into the wrong\nhands. Previously, sophisticated nation-state hacking capabilities resided in a small number\nof governments with well-funded agencies focused on developing these weapons. Even\nthen, government-created espionage tools got into the hands of other governments who\nused them in attacks like WannaCry and NotPetya that spread like wildfire beyond the\n[targeted victims and ultimately devastated lives and disrupted businesses around the world.](https://youtu.be/QVhqNNO0DNM)\nLowering the barrier for access to these weapons would guarantee that such catastrophes\nwould be repeated.\n\nEven if the tools are sold to governments who use them for narrowly targeted attacks, there\nare a variety of ways they can still fall into the wrong hands. For example, private actors like\nthe NSO Group and their less sophisticated customers may lack the defenses some\ngovernments use to protect the weapons, making them more susceptible to cyber-theft. For\nexample, an Italian company called Hacking Team – one of NSO’s competitors – was itself\nhacked in 2015. Additionally, targets of these weapons can observe, reverse-engineer and\nthen use these tools for their own purposes.\n\nSecond, private-sector companies creating these weapons are not subject to the same\nconstraints as governments. Many governments with offensive cyber capabilities are subject\nto international laws, diplomatic consequences and the need to protect their own citizens and\neconomic interests from the indiscriminate use of these weapons. Additionally, some\ngovernments – like the United States – may share high-consequence vulnerabilities they\ndiscover with impacted technology providers so the providers can patch the vulnerability and\nprotect their customers. Private actors like the NSO Group are only incented to keep these\nvulnerabilities to themselves so they can profit from them, and the exploits they create are\nconstantly recycled by governments and cybercriminals once they get into the wild.\n\nThird, companies like the NSO Group threaten human rights whether they seek to or not. An\nanalysis of recent cyber-attacks was able to identify five countries using offensive cyber\ncapabilities between 2012 and 2015: Russia, China, North Korea, France and Israel.\nBetween 2016 and 2018, however, the cast of characters changed to include countries like\nthe United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan. And public reporting has identified clients of\ncyber-surveillance companies like the NSO Group to include Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Egypt,\nEthiopia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. Reporting\nalso shows foreign governments are using those surveillance tools, bought from PSOAs, to\nspy on human rights defenders, journalists and others, including U.S. citizens. These tools\nallow the user to track someone’s whereabouts, listen in on their conversations, read their\ntexts and emails, look at their photographs, steal their contacts list, download their data,\n[review their internet search history and more. Just yesterday The Citizen Lab reported that](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/)\nbetween July and August of this year NSO’s Pegasus program was used to hack 36 phones\nbelonging to journalists, producers, anchors and executives at Al Jazeera. Privacy is\nfundamental to the ability of journalists to report, of dissidents to speak their voices and of\ndemocracy to flourish and these tools threaten their rights and their lives.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe expansion of sovereign immunity that NSO seeks would further encourage the\nburgeoning cyber-surveillance industry to develop, sell and use tools to exploit vulnerabilities\nin violation of U.S. law. Private companies should remain subject to liability when they use\ntheir cyber-surveillance tools to break the law, or knowingly permit their use for such\npurposes, regardless of who their customers are or what they’re trying to achieve. We hope\nthat standing together with our competitors today through this amicus brief will help protect\nour collective customers and global digital ecosystem from more indiscriminate attacks.\n\nTags: [amicus brief,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/amicus-brief/) [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [NSO](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/nso/)\n\n\n-----",
