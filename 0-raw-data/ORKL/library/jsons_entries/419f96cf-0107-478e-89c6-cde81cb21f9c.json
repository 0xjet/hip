This report serves to provide a compilation_\n_of likely tactics, tools, and groups involved in a cyber-based retaliation._\n\n_This report will be of greatest interest to organizations concerned with being targeted by an_\n_Iranian state-sponsored group, especially in the wake of heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf,_\n_as well as those following Middle Eastern geopolitical events._\n\n_Insikt Group will provide updates as new findings surface surrounding these incidents or cyber_\n_threat activities related to them are detected. See these links for additional background on how_\n_[Iran manages state-directed cyber operations and on the history of some state-sponsored and](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iran-hacker-hierarchy/)_\n_patriotic hackers. Sources include intelligence surfaced in the Recorded Future® Platform and_\n_other open sources._\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n[In the early hours of January 3, Iran’s Qassem Suleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/world/middleeast/qassem-soleimani-iraq-iran-attack.html)\nGuard Corps – Quds Force (IRGC-QF), Iraq’s Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the\n[Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), and several others were killed in a U.S. missile strike near](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/world/middleeast/qassem-soleimani-iraq-iran-attack.html)\nIraq’s Baghdad International Airport. We assess that the deaths of Suleimani and al-Muhandis in\nparticular are highly likely to provoke a response from Iran and its allies, which could include a\npattern of retaliatory asymmetric measures executed by Iranian military assets and their allied\nmilitias against U.S. and partner government and business interests regionally, in the Middle East.\n\n## Key Judgments\n\nWe anticipate a measured but direct response from Iran. We assess this is in part to help\ninsulate the Iranian ruling regime, which is deeply concerned with remaining in power and\nhesitant to engage the U.S. in a direct military confrontation. Despite our expectation for a\nmeasured response from the ruling regime, we believe that Iranian proxies will likely\nretaliate more aggressively in the region.\n\n\n-----\n\nIran possesses highly capable cyber operational forces, and we believe the most likely\ntargets of cyberattacks remain the United States and partner government, military, and\ncommercial interests within the Middle East.\nBased on our observations of chatter among hacktivist forces (which we define as proregime but not government directed), we assess that attacks are likely to escalate against\nsofter targets, such as loosely protected websites, servers, and databases.\n[Recent documented instances of Russian state-sponsored groups hijacking and utilizing](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims)\nIranian infrastructure for cyber operations could cause increased uncertainty and confusion\nfor victims attempting to attribute cyber activities. It is less clear today whether operations\nusing known and tracked Iranian cyber infrastructure are actually being run and directed by\nthe Iranian government. This raises the potential for misattribution and mistaken escalation\nbecause we do not know the extent to which Russia has compromised Iranian cyber\noperational infrastructure.\n\n## Background\n\n[Late in the evening on January 2, 2020 ET, press reporting revealed that a U.S. missile strike had](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security-blast-soleimani/irans-soleimani-and-iraqs-muhandis-killed-in-air-strike-militia-spokesman-idUSKBN1Z201C)\n[occurred near Iraq’s Baghdad International Airport. The airstrike killed several people, including](https://twitter.com/AP/status/1212908026534989831)\nQassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – Quds Force (IRGCQF), and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of an Iraqi militia called the Popular\n[Mobilization Forces (PMF). Among those reportedly killed were several other representatives](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/world/middleeast/qassem-soleimani-iraq-iran-attack.html)\nfrom the PMF, including Mohammed Ridha Jabri, the group’s public relations chief. A statement\n[from the U.S. Department of Defense, as well as press reports from Iranian government outlets,](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2049534/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/)\nconfirmed the strike and that Suleimani was the target of the attack.\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\nInsikt Group assesses that the death of Suleimani in particular will likely provoke a response from\nthe Iranian government, including multiple scenarios involving retaliatory asymmetric measures\nexecuted by Iranian military assets, proxies, or their allied militias against U.S. government and\nbusiness interests in the Middle East, as well as U.S. regional partners, such as Saudi Arabia, the\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE), and Israel.\n\n[As of this writing, Recorded Future has observed a unanimous response by Iranian military,](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/01/05/iran-soleimani-khamenei-adviser-pleitgen-intv-vpx.cnn)\n[diplomatic, and political leaders that a retaliatory attack will take place, although such statements](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-03/zarif-says-iran-can-respond-any-time-by-any-means-to-us-strike)\ndid not include any specifics as to when, how, and where a response will occur. Iran’s Supreme\n[Leader Ali Khamenei declared on January 3, 2020, that a “harsh revenge” awaited those who led](https://twitter.com/FarsNews_Agency/status/1212963010353999872)\n[the strike against Suleimani and initiated three days of national mourning to commemorate the](https://twitter.com/FarsNews_Agency/status/1212966799312130048)\n[fallen IRGC-QF Commander. On January 5, the military advisor to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Major](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/05/middleeast/iran-soleimani-khamenei-adviser-intl/index.html)\nGeneral Hossein Dehghan, stated that Iran’s response would “for sure be military” and directed\nagainst U.S. “military sites.”\n\n### Reading the Need to Retaliate\n\n[Over the past few years, General Soleimani has reportedly enjoyed widespread domestic](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/qasem-soleimani-iran-s-celebrity-warlord/)\nsupport, due in part to the notion that he was responsible for the strategies that shielded the\n[country from terrorist attacks and threats posed by the Islamic State (IS) group. Several reports](https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/baghdad-airport-strike-live-intl-hnk/h_02d5a17ad0eebe80128bda0388b8be36)\n\n\n-----\n\n[have suggested that Soleimani’s death has led to a distinct call for retaliation, which is uncommon](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-hoists-red-flag-on-mosque-to-avenge-killing-of-commander-qassim-suleimani/articleshow/73106490.cms)\nin recent Iranian military history, except in cases where extreme acts of violence have impacted\ngovernment or Iranian military personnel. Examples of this include the June 2017 IS attack\nagainst the Iranian parliament, and the August 2017 beheading of an IRGC officer, Mohsen\nHojaji, by IS. The former led to a ballistic missile attack against IS, while the IRGC officer Hojaji\nbecame a symbol in the fight against IS. At the time, Soleimani, among many senior IRGC\n[officials, spearheaded the response to Hojaji’s death.](https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-praises-martyrdom-fighter-beheaded-islamic-state/28680228.html)\n\nOne historic example which we believe depicts the more calculated approach that Iran is likely to\npursue in response to Soleimani’s death was the slaying of Iranian diplomats by the Afghan\nTaliban in 1998. In 1998, almost a dozen Iranian diplomats were killed by the Afghan Taliban, an\n[incident that resulted in a popular outcry against the Taliban group and the mobilization of](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/11/world/iran-holds-taliban-responsible-for-9-diplomats-deaths.html)\n[approximately 200,000 Iranian military forces. Research from the RAND Corporation depicted a](http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9809/14/iran.afghan.border/index.html)\n[pragmatic decision-making process within the Iranian government to deal with its Afghan crisis.](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1320/MR1320.ch3.pdf)\nNotwithstanding hardline interests from the IRGC and radical political fronts to engage militarily\nagainst their ideological nemesis, Supreme Leader Khamenei instead opted for a response\n“without the risk of war.” Similarly, on January 5, 2020, IRGC general Hossein Dehgan, a top\n[adviser to Khamenei, claimed that Iran would respond militarily to the killing of Soleimani, but](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/05/middleeast/iran-soleimani-khamenei-adviser-intl/index.html)\nwould not seek war.\n\nInsikt Group assesses that Iran is likely to pursue a measured asymmetric response, as it\nbalances the need to offset the pressure of Soleimani’s death without further fueling the potential\nfor direct military engagement with the U.S.\n\n### Examples of Recent Asymmetric Retaliatory Attacks\n\nPrevious suspected retaliatory measures taken by Iran or Iranian-backed forces in the past\ninclude but are not limited to:\n\nThroughout 2019, the IRGC-QF was suspected of being behind the missile strike of Saudi\nArabia’s oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, as well as the seizure and commandeering of\nthe Swedish-owned oil tanker Stena Impero.\nIran has been accused of using its influence with Shia groups to incite rebellion in locations\n[known to be fertile grounds for sectarian and anti-government activity, such as Bahrain.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-iran-bahrain/iran-supreme-leader-peoples-will-prevail-in-bahrain-after-protests-idUSKCN1UQ1M4)\nThis kind of influence likely motivated the violent protests held at the U.S. embassy in Iraq\nbetween December 31, 2019 and January 2, 2020. Reports suggest that these protests\n[were executed by supporters of Kata’ib Hizballah, an Iranian-backed proxy force led by al-](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/us-embassy-stormed-in-baghdad)\nMuhandis.\nIran has also been accused of supporting acts of sabotage against regional oil and gas\ninfrastructure. Throughout 2019, reports have linked Iran to coordinated attacks with\nYemeni allies, the Houthi rebels (Ansar Allah), to against Saudi Arabia’s oil and gas\n[infrastructure. In Bahrain, Iran purportedly supports a slew of Shia militia groups, and was](https://jihadology.net/2014/05/05/hizballah-cavalcade-singing-hizballahs-tune-in-manama-why-are-bahrains-militants-using-the-music-of-irans-proxies/)\n[allegedly linked to a high-profile attack on Bahraini oil and gas infrastructure in November](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bahrain-pipeline/bahrain-calls-pipeline-blast-terrorism-linked-to-iran-idUSKBN1DB0NW)\n2017.\n\nIran has a number of highly capable computer network operations teams that may be involved in\na response against the United States, regional partners, and Western interests. Recorded Future\nbelieves that previous accesses gained from espionage operations will very likely facilitate these\n\n\n-----\n\nretaliatory actions. Most notably, Iranian teams have used a destructive cyber capability in prior\nescalations, which we assess demonstrates both a willingness and ability to deploy such malware\nin similar situations. Iranian actors are also known to favor web shells, password spraying, and a\ncombination of custom and commodity malware to gain access to target environments. Despite\nthe use of destructive malware in previous cyber response scenarios, the death of General\nSoleimani in a U.S. airstrike is a unique situation and injects significant uncertainty into our\nassessments regarding which cyber capabilities Iran will likely leverage against which regional\nU.S. and partner interests.\n\n[In June 2019, Recorded Future observed APT33 malware activity targeting U.S. industry, critical](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iranian-cyber-operations-infrastructure/)\ninfrastructure, and government entities. Rapidly following this, on June 22, U.S. President Donald\n[Trump stated that the administration used cyber strikes against Iran’s missile systems amid](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/with-trumps-approval-pentagon-launched-cyber-strikes-against-iran/2019/06/22/250d3740-950d-11e9-b570-6416efdc0803_story.html)\n[heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf. Iran was also accused of placing limpet mines on a](https://www.foxnews.com/world/limpet-mine-oil-tanker-striking-resemblance-iranian-mines)\nJapanese oil tanker in the Gulf, which fueled tension in the region. At that time, in June 2019, the\n[U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency reported an increase in Iran-related actors](https://www.dhs.gov/cisa/news/2019/06/22/cisa-statement-iranian-cybersecurity-threats)\ndeploying wiper malware to their targets; however, the NSA’s Threat Operations Center technical\n[director stated that Iranian actors were continuing normal intelligence-gathering operations](https://www.cyberscoop.com/nsa-iran-cyber-operations-david-hogue/)\nfocused on espionage, not destruction.\n\n## Previous Access and Tools May Tip Cyber Response\n\nRecorded Future anticipates continued targeting of U.S. industry, critical infrastructure, and\ngovernment entities by Iranian threat actors during this period of heightened tension. Although we\nassess that Iranian actors will continue to target domestic U.S. government, military, and\ncommercial entities for cyberespionage purposes, organizations in the Persian Gulf region are at\nthe greatest risk for destructive cyberattacks. Further, we judge that Iranian actors APT33, APT34\n(also known as OilRig), or MUDDYWATER will also likely target United States allies and partners\nin the Middle East in cyberespionage operations. We anticipate the continued mixture of custom\nand commodity tooling, and recommend that organizations monitor for suspicious Powershell and\nWMIC-based behavior in particular.\n\nMUDDYWATER actors have used politically flavored spearfishing and macros, or stolen\ncredentials, to drop malware and steal information. MUDDYWATER relies heavily on a\nPowershell-based backdoor called POWERSTATS. MUDDYWATER makes use of\n[compromised third-party domains that are used as proxies to distribute POWERSTATS,](https://www.clearskysec.com/muddywater-targets-kurdish-groups-turkish-orgs/)\n[and for command and control (C2) purposes.](https://reaqta.com/2017/11/muddywater-apt-targeting-middle-east/)\nAPT33 is one of the most active groups currently operating in the Middle East and has\ndemonstrated an ability to continually revise its tactics and pursue a variety of tools and\ntechniques to compromise its victims. The actor uses a wide range of tools in its custom\nmalware toolkit, including POWERTON, while also relying heavily on open source remote\naccess trojans (RATs), including njRAT, Powershell Empire, Nanocore, and PupyRAT.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT39 has primarily leveraged the Chafer and Remexi trojan families, targeting those in\nthe telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and\nsupporting IT firms. We assess that the group’s primary focus on telecommunications and\ntravel indicates an interest in both monitoring specific individuals and collecting proprietary\nor customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements\n[related to national priorities. Researchers from FireEye have noted that APT39 operations](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/apt39-iranian-cyber-espionage-group-focused-on-personal-information.html)\nare similar to that of APT34 (OilRig) in terms of Middle East targeting patterns,\ninfrastructure, and timing. More specifically, both APT39 and APT34 share the same\nmalware distribution methods, infrastructure nomenclature, and targeting overlaps.\n[The Lab Dookhtegan leaks showcased APT34’s custom tooling: PoisonFrog, Glimpse,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/behind-the-scenes-with-oilrig/)\nHypershell, HighShell, Fox Panel, and Webmask. The PoisonFrog implant is a Powershell[based downloader that pulls down a VBS backdoor. Assessments from Chronicle and Palo](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-group-exposes-iranian-apt-operations-and-members/)\nAlto show that PoisonFrog is the BONDUPDATER backdoor, previously analyzed by\n[FireEye, Booz Allen, and Palo Alto’s Unit 42. Webmask is likely part of the DNSpionage](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/12/targeted-attack-in-middle-east-by-apt34.html)\n[DNS hijacking campaign disclosed by Cisco Talos.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/11/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east.html)\n\nWe assess that previous credential-gathering activities conducted by APT33, APT34, and APT35\nmay be used to gain initial access to targeted environments. Notable recent events include:\n\n[In October 2019, APT33 reportedly took special interest in industrial control system (ICS)](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-apt33-industrial-control-systems/)\nhardware and software vendors in the United States and worldwide, conducting a focused\npassword-spraying campaign against those organizations. The actors typically targeted\nbetween 50,000 to 70,000 organizations at a time, selecting a small number of credentials\nto attempt to gain access to each organization. The breadth of this targeting was curtailed\n[significantly between October and November 2019, when APT33 purportedly targeted only](https://twitter.com/likethecoins/status/1197619169627381761)\naround 2,000 organizations per month, attempting to use various password combinations\non 18 to 20 accounts in each organization, a 900% increase. Commands used in\n[password-spraying and on-host activity can be found in this GitHub.](https://gist.github.com/MSAdministrator/7a61025263e279a740835da4b205e6d0)\n[Similarly, FireEye also found APT34 using the credential-stealing malware families](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/07/hard-pass-declining-apt34-invite-to-join-their-professional-network.html)\nLONGWATCH, VALUEVAULT, and TONEDEAF in a targeted spearphishing campaign.\nThese malware families largely sought to harvest credentials from targeted individuals. The\nactors used LinkedIn messages with malicious links to entice the victims to download a\nlegitimate datasheet that used VBA macros to download the malware families.\nData gathered from APT35 (Newscaster, PHOSPHORUS) credential harvesting via\nwatering hole attacks, phishing emails, and fake social media profiles may also be\n[leveraged. On October 4, 2019, Microsoft disclosed that, for 30 days from August to](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/04/recent-cyberattacks-require-us-all-to-be-vigilant/)\nSeptember 2019, APT35 was observed making 2,700 attempts to breach a U.S.\npresidential campaign, later identified as the Trump campaign, in addition to targeting\ncurrent and former U.S. government officials, political journalists, and “prominent” Iranian\n[expatriates. The group targeted 241 email accounts, and was successful in compromising](https://www.cyberscoop.com/iran-hacking-clearsky-microsoft-charming-kitten/)\nfour accounts that were not associated with U.S. government officials or the campaign.\n[Previous access or information gleaned from DNS hijacking activity from SeaTurtle, and the](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/04/seaturtle.html)\n[DNSpionage/APT34 cluster may also facilitate further intelligence-gathering.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/11/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east.html)\n\n### Destructive Malware\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT33 and APT34 have been linked to destructive malware attacks against the oil and gas\nsector, using Shamoon, DEADWOOD, and ZeroCleare.\n\nDuring a presentation at the CYBERWARCON conference in Arlington, VA in late 2019,\nMicrosoft analysts discussed APT33 dropping a destructive malware family called\nDEADWOOD onto a VPN server in Saudi Arabia in June 2019. Recorded Future cannot\nprovide insight into the malware family described by Microsoft. However, on June 22, 2019,\na file uploaded to VirusTotal was flagged as being a wiper; it was later flagged by the user\n“THOR scanner” as a wiper used in the Middle East. It is likely that this file\n(857ef30bf15ea3da9b94092da78ef0fc) is the wiper in question.\n[In 2012, APT33 deployed the destructive malware Shamoon, and is suspected along with](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-attacks)\n[other Iran-nexus APT groups to have participated in the December 2018 operation against](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-shamoon/saipem-says-shamoon-variant-crippled-hundreds-of-computers-idUSKBN1OB2FA)\nItalian petrochemical contractor SAIPEM.\nIn early December 2019, IBM’s X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS)\npublished their discovery of the ZeroCleare wiper malware that was observed targeting\nenergy and industrial sectors in the Middle East. According to IBM IRIS, APT34 (OilRig)\nwas likely involved with ZeroCleare’s deployment. During their discovery efforts, IBM IRIS\nresearchers found that ZeroCleare shared characteristics with the Shamoon malware,\nspecifically in that the ZeroCleare malware overwrites the master boot record (MBR) as well\nas the disk partitions on Windows machines.\n[Analysis of a recent sample that called itself “Dustman” revealed similarities to ZeroCleare](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iasrar_dustman-report-in-english-activity-6619216346083393537-NV1z/)\nand contained anti-Saudi messaging, making use of the same raw disk driver; however, the\nsample had all of the tooling needed bundled into a single executable. The sample\ncontained anti-Saudi messaging, and dropped an anti-Saudi mutex (“Down With Bin\nSalman”).\n\n### Nationalistic and Pro-Regime Hacktivism\n\nWe assess that the Iranian regime will likely take its time contemplating a response to the killing\nof General Suleimani. In stark contrast, pro-regime (but not government-directed) cyber actors will\n[likely continue to conduct disruptive activity. Recorded Future is aware of hacktivist defacement](https://urlscan.io/search/#domain%3A%22yon.ir%22%20OR%20hash%3A4a569d1a0d3834b2b7208cc7ac049203babd4ecb9efd0c1712c2da3dc40dd4bc)\n[activity occurring within hours of the news breaking of Suleimani’s death, including against U.S.](https://urlscan.io/result/d653d5e5-97ce-4a76-82cd-241528243857/)\n[government institutions. Further, we also observed the distribution of disinformation among IRGC](https://twitter.com/farnazfassihi/status/1213166276752879616?s=20)\nsupporters. Based on our observations of chatter among hacktivist forces, we assess that attacks\nare likely to escalate against softer targets, such as loosely protected websites, servers, and\ndatabases.\n\n[It is not outside the realm of possibility for actors to deploy SamSam ransomware or similar](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-iranian-men-indicted-deploying-ransomware-extort-hospitals-municipalities-and-public)\ncampaigns under the guise of criminal activity. While there is no evidence to suggest that the two\nactors were affiliated with the Iranian government, Tehran is undoubtedly aware of those\noperations and their tools.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe assess that Iran may exercise a response to the killing of General Qassem Suleimani that will\nmore aggressively rely on cyberattacks rather than kinetic ones, which will likely take the form of\nespionage or sabotage.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis cyber response — likely one of several potential asymmetric countermeasures — may be\ncarried out directly by Iranian intelligence or military groups, by their contractors, or by other\nproxies. These measures will very likely be fueled by previous accesses and information gained\nfrom espionage operations. Attributing these intrusions and distinguishing them from other\nopportunistic intrusions will likely prove difficult.\n\n[Further, the recent documented instances of Russian state-sponsored groups hijacking and](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments)\n[utilizing Iranian infrastructure for cyber operations have injected further uncertainty into tracking](https://www.recordedfuture.com/bluealpha-iranian-apts/)\nand attributing Iranian espionage or destructive activities. We assess that this infrastructure\nhijacking and increased uncertainty raises the potential that an incident could be misattributed\nand mistakenly be interpreted as an escalation. There are more sides with interests in the Middle\nEast than just the U.S. and its partners and Iran and its proxies; the injection of further uncertainty\nvia Russian operations masquerading as Iranian could contribute to an atmosphere of chaos or\nconfusion in the wake of a cyber intrusion. This raises the potential for misattribution and\nmistaken escalation because we do not know the extent to which Russia has compromised\nIranian cyber operational infrastructure.\n\n## Suggested Mitigations\n\nAPT33 continues to favor dynamic DNS (DDNS) hosting; Recorded Future’s Weaponized\nDomains Security Control Feed can be used to identify and block these domains.\nRecorded Future proactively detects and logs malicious server configurations in the\nCommand and Control Security Control Feed.\nRecorded Future recommends that organizations monitor for sequential login attempts from\nthe same IP against different accounts. This type of activity is more difficult to detect than\ntraditional brute forcing, but will help insulate organizations from a favored tactic used by\nAPT33.\nThe introduction of multi-factor authentication has proven to be a highly effective mitigation\npractice for many organizations that have historically experienced a high level of credential\nstuffing and password-spraying attacks.\nMonitor criminal underground communities for the availability of new configuration files\ntargeting your organization, acquire those files, and thoroughly analyze them for additional\nattack indicators.\nEnd users can reduce the risk of being victimized by password spraying by using a\npassword manager and setting a unique strong password for each online account.\nSocial engineering training for company employees can help mitigate threats posed to the\norganization by disclosure of information used to conduct password spraying and attacks.\nLog analysis (through an IDS) can aid in the identification of unsuccessful login attempts\nacross multiple user accounts. Cross-referencing log data may help to detect incidents\ninvolving high-frequency lockouts, unsanctioned remote access attempts, temporal attack\noverlaps across multiple user accounts, and fingerprint unique web browser agent\ninformation.\n\n\n-----",
