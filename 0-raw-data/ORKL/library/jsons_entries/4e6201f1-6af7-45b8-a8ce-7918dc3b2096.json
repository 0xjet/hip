In most of our cases, we see the\nthreat actors utilizing Cobalt Strike. Therefore, defenders should know how to detect Cobalt\nStrike in various stages of its execution. The primary purpose of this post is to expose the\nmost common techniques that we see from the intrusions that we track and provide\ndetections. Having said that, not all of Cobalt Strike’s features will be discussed.\n\nAs you have noticed from our reporting so far, Cobalt Strike is used as a post-exploitation\ntool with various malware droppers responsible for the initial infection stage. Some of the\nmost common droppers we see are IcedID (a.k.a. BokBot), ZLoader, Qbot (a.k.a. QakBot),\nUrsnif, Hancitor, Bazar and TrickBot. Cobalt Strike is chosen for the second stage of the\nattack as it offers enhanced post-exploitation capabilities. Threat actors turn to Cobalt Strike\nfor its ease of use and extensibility.\n\n[Thanks to @Kostastsale for helping put this guide together!](https://twitter.com/Kostastsale/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Cobalt Strike Capabilities\n\nCobalt Strike has many features, and it is under constant development by a team of\n[developers at Core Security by Help Systems. Raphael Mudge was the primary maintainer](https://www.coresecurity.com/products/cobalt-strike)\nfor many years before the acquisition from Core Security. Raphael has an extensive playlist\non youtube that demonstrates the many features of Cobalt Strike and step-by-step guides on\nhow to use its full potential. His videos are handy to watch if you want to get a glimpse of all\nthe features that Cobalt Strike has to offer in various phases of the intrusion. Below are some\nof the capabilities that we see being used by operators. This is not an exhaustive list of\ncommands available, but it contains most of the built-in features that we encounter in most\ncases. In the table below, the “Documented Features” correspond to the Cobalt Strike\n[execution commands via the interactive shell as per official documentation:](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-beacon)\n\n**Capabilities** **Documented features/commands**\n\n\nUpload and Download\npayloads and files\n\n\nDownload <file>\n\nUpload <file>\n\n\nRunning Commands shell <command>\n\nrun <command>\n\npowershell <command>\n\nProcess Injection inject <pid>\n\ndllinject <pid> (for reflective dll injection)\n\ndllload <pid> (for loading an on-disk DLL to memory)\n\nspawnto <arch> <full-exe-path> (for process hollowing)\n\nSOCKS Proxy socks <port number>\n\nPrivilege Escalation getsystem (SYSTEM account impersonation using named\n_pipes)_\n\nelevate svc-exe [listener] (creates a services that runs a\n_payload as SYSTEM)_\n\n\n-----\n\nCredential and Hash\nHarvesting\n\n\nhashdump\n\nlogonpasswords (Using Mimikatz)\n\nchromedump (Recover Google Chrome passwords from\n_current user)_\n\n\nNetwork Enumeration portscan [targets] [ports] [discovery method]\n\nnet <commands> (commands to find targets on the domain)\n\nLateral Movement jump psexec (Run service EXE on remote host)\n\njump psexec_psh (Run a PowerShell one-liner on remote host\n_via a service)_\n\njump winrm (Run a PowerShell script via WinRM on remote\n_host)_\n\n_remote-exec <any of the above> (Run a single command_\n_using the above methods on remote host)_\n\n## Cobalt Strike Infrastructure\n\nChanging infrastructure will always be inconvenient for the threat actors, but it is not a\ndifficult task. Additionally, Cobalt Strike is able to make use of “redirectors.” Therefore, some\nof these servers could be a redirector instead of the actual Cobalt Strike C2 server.\n[Redirectors are hosts that do what the name implies, redirect traffic to the real C2 server.](https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2014/01/14/cloud-based-redirectors-for-distributed-hacking/)\nThreat actors can hide their infrastructure behind an army of redirectors and conceal the\nactual C2 server. This makes the malicious infrastructure harder for the defenders to\ndiscover and block.\n\nImage taken from the [official cobalt strike documentation:](https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2014/01/14/cloud-based-redirectors-for-distributed-hacking/)\n\n\n-----\n\nOur Threat Feed service tracks hundreds of Cobalt Strike servers and other C2\n[infrastructure. More information on this service and others can be found here.](https://thedfirreport.com/services/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malleable C2 profiles\n\nCobalt Strike has adopted Malleable profiles and allows the threat actors to customize\nalmost every aspect of the C2 framework. This makes life harder for defenders as the\nfootprint can change with each profile modification. The threat actors have the ability to\nchange anything from the network communication (like user agent, headers, default URIs) to\nindividual post-exploitation functions such as process injection and payload obfuscation\ncapabilities.\n\nAcross many of our investigations the profiles used differ, but you can see that actors do\noften reuse or pattern emege among intrusion like in the following 3 cases:\n\nAll the above intrusions made use of the same profile that mimics a legitimate jquery request.\nThe self-signed certificates for intrusions 2 and 3 also contained the same fake attributes\ntrying to pose as regular jquery traffic.\n\nCommon Cobalt Strike config:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n| grab_beacon_config: \n| x86 URI Response: \n| BeaconType: 0 (HTTP)\n| Port: 80\n| Polling: 45000\n| Jitter: 37\n| Maxdns: 255\n| C2 Server: 195.123.217.45,/jquery-3.3.1.min.js\n| User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\n| HTTP Method Path 2: /jquery-3.3.2.min.js\n| Header1: \n| Header2: \n| PipeName: \n| DNS Idle: J}\\xC4q\n| DNS Sleep: 0\n| Method1: GET\n| Method2: POST\n| Spawnto_x86: %windir%\\syswow64\\dllhost.exe\n| Spawnto_x64: %windir%\\sysnative\\dllhost.exe\n| Proxy_AccessType: 2 (Use IE settings)\n|\n|\n| x64 URI Response: \n| BeaconType: 0 (HTTP)\n| Port: 80\n| Polling: 45000\n| Jitter: 37\n| Maxdns: 255\n| C2 Server: 195.123.217.45,/jquery-3.3.1.min.js\n| User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\n| HTTP Method Path 2: /jquery-3.3.2.min.js\n| Header1: \n| Header2: \n| PipeName: \n| DNS Idle: J}\\xC4q\n| DNS Sleep: 0\n| Method1: GET\n| Method2: POST\n| Spawnto_x86: %windir%\\syswow64\\dllhost.exe\n| Spawnto_x64: %windir%\\sysnative\\dllhost.exe\n| Proxy_AccessType: 2 (Use IE settings)\n|_\n443/tcp open https\n| grab_beacon_config: \n| x86 URI Response: \n| BeaconType: 8 (HTTPS)\n| Port: 443\n| Polling: 45000\n| Jitter: 37\n| Maxdns: 255\n| C2 Server: gloomix.com,/jquery-3.3.1.min.js\n| User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\n| HTTP Method Path 2: /jquery-3.3.2.min.js\n| Header1: \n| Header2: \n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n| PipeName: \n| DNS Idle: J}\\xC4q\n| DNS Sleep: 0\n| Method1: GET\n| Method2: POST\n| Spawnto_x86: %windir%\\syswow64\\dllhost.exe\n| Spawnto_x64: %windir%\\sysnative\\dllhost.exe\n| Proxy_AccessType: 2 (Use IE settings)\n|\n|\n| x64 URI Response: \n| BeaconType: 8 (HTTPS)\n| Port: 443\n| Polling: 45000\n| Jitter: 37\n| Maxdns: 255\n| C2 Server: gloomix.com,/jquery-3.3.1.min.js\n| User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\n| HTTP Method Path 2: /jquery-3.3.2.min.js\n| Header1: \n| Header2: \n| PipeName: \n| DNS Idle: J}\\xC4q\n| DNS Sleep: 0\n| Method1: GET\n| Method2: POST\n| Spawnto_x86: %windir%\\syswow64\\dllhost.exe\n| Spawnto_x64: %windir%\\sysnative\\dllhost.exe\n| Proxy_AccessType: 2 (Use IE settings)\n|_\n195.123.222.23\nJARM: 07d14d16d21d21d07c42d41d00041d24a458a375eef0c576d23a7bab9a9fb1\nJA3s: ae4edc6faf64d08308082ad26be60767, 649d6810e8392f63dc311eecb6b7098b\nJA3:\n72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea, 51c64c77e60f3980eea90869b68c58a8, 613e01474d42ebe48ef52dff6a20f079, 7dd50e\n112cd23734a310b90f6f44a7cd\nCertificate: [79:97:9a:e4:cb:ae:ae:32:d6:4a:e5:0e:f6:73:d0:69:e9:19:c1:54 ]\nNot Before: 2020/12/21 04:27:54\nNot After: 2021/12/21 04:27:54\nIssuer Org: jQuery\nSubject Common: jquery.com\nSubject Org: jQuery\nPublic Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n\n```\n[Examples of malleable C2 profiles can be found on the official GitHub repository of Raphael](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles)\nMudge. There are a number of GitHub repositories that allow for generation of randomized\nmalleable profiles. These randomized profiles could be either based on completely random\nvalues or values based on an existing collection of existing malleable profiles. Two of the\nmost notable repos are:\n\n[Malleable-C2-Randomizer https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/Malleable-C2-Randomizer](https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/Malleable-C2-Randomizer)\n[C2concealer – https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/C2concealer](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/C2concealer)\n\n\n-----\n\nA couple of very recent examples where threat actors used customized malleable profiles\nwere in the Solarwinds attack as well as in latest campaigns from Nobelium as attributed by\n[Microsoft.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the case of the Solarwinds attack, the threat actors used several customized Cobalt Strike\nbeacons to execute the second-stage payload on their victims. According to Microsoft, “No\n_two Beacon instances shared the same C2 domain name, Watermark, or other_\n_aforementioned configuration values. Other than certain internal fields, most Beacon_\n_configuration fields are customizable via a Malleable C2 profile.” –_ Deep dive into the\nSolorigate second-stage activation: From SUNBURST to TEARDROP and Raindrop.\n\n## Cobalt Strike in Action\n\n### Execution\n\nA lot of the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation tools are implemented as windows DLLs. This\nmeans that every time a threat actor runs these built-in tools, Cobalt Strike spawns a\ntemporary process and uses rundll32.exe to inject the malicious code into it and\ncommunicates the results back to the beacon using named pipes. Defenders should pay\nclose attention to command line events that rundll32 is executing without any arguments.\n\nExample execution:\n\n\n-----\n\nNamed pipes are used to send the output of the post-exploitation tools to the beacon. Cobalt\nStrike is using default unique pipe names, which defenders can use for detection. However,\nCobalt Strike allows the operators to change the name of the pipes to any name of their\nchoosing by configuring the malleable C2 profile accordingly. Even though this is very easy\nto create, it is an inconvenience for the average attacker, and we do not see it being done\noften. For more information Cobalt Strike has an extensive documentation on named pipes\n[here.](https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2021/02/09/learn-pipe-fitting-for-all-of-your-offense-projects/)\n\nThe default Cobalt Strike pipes are (the “*” symbolize the prefix/suffix):\n\n\\postex_*\n\\postex_ssh_*\n\\status_*\n\\msagent_*\n\\MSSE-*\n\\*-server\n\nSysmon event 17 and 18 are able to log named pipes. Note that Sysmon should be explicitly\nconfigured to log named pipes. F-Secure Labs created a great write up for detecting Cobalt\nStrike through named pipes: Detecting Cobalt Strike Default Modules via Named Pipe\nAnalysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, we commonly see three methods regularly used by threat actors to download\nand execute the Cobalt Strike beacon.\n\n1. Using PowerShell to load and inject shellcode directly into memory\n\nEncrypted PowerShell command with embedded Cobalt Strike SMB beacons from the\nreport: [From word to lateral movement in 1 hour.](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/06/20/from-word-to-lateral-movement-in-1-hour/)\n\nThe PowerShell is base64 encoded. Decoding the PowerShell command, we are presented\nwith the shellcode that will be pushed into memory.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of this PowerShell stager, you can checkout the helpful blog post from\n[@Paulsec4 here.](https://newtonpaul.com/analysing-fileless-malware-cobalt-strike-beacon/#Injecting_into_memory_with_PowerShell)\n\n1. Download to disk and execute manually on the target\n\nIn the example below, you can see the TrickBot process downloading to disk, and then\nloading the beacon into memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe event IDs in this case for Sysmon logs are:\n\n11 – File Creation\n7 – Image Loaded\n1 – Process Creation\n3 – Network Connection\n\nAnd for windows Security logs:\n\n4663 – File Creation\n4688 – Process Creation (Command Line logging should be explicitly configured as it is\n_not on by default)_\n5156 – Network Connection\n\nA recent example of this activity can be found in one of our latest reports Hancitor Continues\nto Push Cobalt Strike, where the malicious Hancitor injected process(svchost.exe)\ndownloaded the Cobalt Strike DLL beacon to disk and then proceeded with allocating a new\nmemory region inside the current rundll32.exe process and loaded it into the memory.\n\n1. Executing the beacon in memory via the initial malware infection\n\nThis case is a little bit more difficult to capture, thankfully, we have plenty of examples from\nour reporting to demonstrate the execution flow. Below is an example from the\ncase [Sodinokibi (aka REvil) Ransomware.](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/03/29/sodinokibi-aka-revil-ransomware/)\n\nIcedID reached out to two Cobalt Strike servers to download and execute the beacons in\nmemory:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Defense Evasion\n\n[In every intrusion, we see process injection taking place across the environment. It is mainly](https://thedfirreport.com/?s=process+injection)\nused to inject malicious code into a remote process and inject it into lsass.exe to extract\ncredentials from memory. By injecting the malicious payload into a remote process, the threat\nactors are spawning a new session in the user context that the injected process belongs to.\nThere are many ways in which process injection can be used. You can check out a helpful\npost by [Boschko that goes through all the various methods that Cobalt Strike uses.](https://boschko.ca/cobalt-strike-process-injection/)\n\nDetect the Cobalt Strike default process injection with Sysmon by looking for the below EIDs\nin consecutive order:\n\n10 – Process accessed\n8 – CreateRemoteThread detected\n3/22 – Network query/DNS query\n\nExample process injection on remote process (RuntimeBroker.exe):\n\nThere are other ways to detect this activity. In other methods of process injection, such as\nprocess hollowing, EID 8 will not be present. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to detect this\nprocess injection activity via security windows logs without Sysmon to monitor for the event\nIDs above.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example from the Sodinokibi report, multiple process injections across the environment\nusing Cobalt Strike Beacons (Sysmon EID 8):\n\n### Discovery\n\nIn every Cobalt Strike occasion that we report, we see threat actors executing\nreconnaissance commands with the help of the “shell” command. The commands are based\non native windows utilities such as nltest.exe, whoami.exe, and net.exe to help with\ndiscovery. Red Canary has a detailed article which goes through the reasons that\nadversaries use native windows tools for domain trust discovery, that article can be found\n[here. Below are some recent examples from the Conti infection; however, these commands](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/domain-trust-discovery/)\nremain consistent with other intrusions we track.\n\nConti operators executing reconnaissance commands through Cobalt Strike:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most used tools for discovery purposes that threat actors are dropping with the help of\n[Cobalt Strike are AdFind and BloodHound. Adfind is by far the most used among those two.](https://thedfirreport.com/category/adfind/)\nIt is also worth mentioning that PowerShell is also used for enumerating the network looking\n[for interesting targets. When it comes to PowerShell, unmodified PowerSploit](https://thedfirreport.com/?s=powersploit)\n[and PowerView modules are a very common method threat actors are using to collect](https://thedfirreport.com/?s=powerview)\ninformation.\n\n### Privilege Escalation\n\nThe most common technique that threat actors use to obtain SYSTEM level privileges is\nthe [GetSystem method via named-pipe impersonation. Example execution on a target](https://thedfirreport.com/?s=getsystem)\n[system as observed in the TrickBot Still Alive and Well report:](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/01/11/trickbot-still-alive-and-well/)\n\nThere are also other methods for elevating privileges with Cobalt Strike, such as using the\n“elevate” command. The elevate command uses two options to escalate privileges. The first\none is the svc-exe. It attempts to drop an executable under “c:\\windows” and creates a\nservice to run the payload as SYSTEM. The second one is the uac-token**duplication method, which attempts to spawn a new elevated process under the context of**\na non-privileged user with a stolen token of an existed elevated process. However, as\nmentioned above, the most used method is the name pipe impersonation escalation via\n[“getsystem” command. A detailed explanation can be found at the bottom of this Cobalt](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-beacon)\nStrike official documentation page.\n\nAs you can see below, Sysmon generates a lot more logs related to the successful privilege\nescalation using the “elevate svc-exe” option. In this case, spoolsv.exe is the executable that\nwas dropped by Cobalt Strike to run a payload.\n\nSysmon Event IDs:\n\n11 – File Created\n\n1 – Process Create\n\n\n-----\n\n25 – Process tampering\n\n12 & 13 – Registry value set\n\nWindows Event IDs:\n\nService installation: 4697(Security) and 7045(System)\n\nProcess Creation: 4688\n\n### Credential Access\n\nAfter getting access to the target using Cobalt Strike, one of the first tasks that operators\ntake is to collect credentials and hashes from LSASS. There are a couple of ways to achieve\nthis with Cobalt Strike. The first one uses the “hashdump” command to dump password\nhashes; the second one uses the command “logonpasswords” to dump plaintext\ncredentials and NTLM hashes with Mimikatz.\n\nHere’s an example of accessing LSASS to steal credentials from memory using “hashdump”\ncommand in Cobalt Strike:\n\n\n-----\n\nSysmon EIDs 1,8,10,17:(Event ID 8 will not always be present depending on the technique\n_used.)_\n\nAs you can see below, the only Event IDs that we manage to capture using this technique\nare process creation and process termination events.\n\n4688 – Process Creation (Rundll32.exe is loading the DLL payload upon execution)\n4689 – Process Termination\n\n[We have also seen Lazagne being used on two occasions to extract credentials from various](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne)\napplications on the target system.\n\n[Cobalt Strike has implemented the DCSync functionality as introduced by mimikatz. DCSync](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\nuses windows APIs for Active Directory replication to retrieve the NTLM hash for a specific\nuser or all users. To achieve this, the threat actors must have access to a privileged account\n[with domain replication rights (usually a Domain Administrator). By running the DCSync](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/2020-12-04-DCSync)\ncommand, threat actors attempt to masquerade as a domain controller to sync with another\ndomain controller to collect credentials.\n\n### Command and Control\n\nCobalt Strike is using GET and POST requests to communicate with the C2 server. The\nthreat actors can choose between HTTP, HTTPS and DNS network communication. When it\ncomes to C2, we typically see HTTP and HTTPS beacons. By default, Cobalt Strike will use\nGET requests to retrieve information and POST requests to send information back to the\nserver. As explained above, all the default configurations can change with the use of\nmalleable profiles. Even though we don’t see this very often, the beacon could also be\nconfigured to send back information with GET requests in small chunks. If you want a deep\n[dive into detecting Cobalt Strike CnC, this article from UnderDefense is a great resource.](https://underdefense.com/how-to-detect-cobaltstrike-command-control-communication/)\n\nThe metadata is encrypted with a public key that is injected into the beacon.\n\n[“Example of a get request from our latest ransomware report on Conti“](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/05/12/conti-ransomware/)\n\n_“Results of executed commands are sent to the server using POST requests.”_\n\n## Lateral Movement\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce Cobalt Strike beacons are established, usually minutes later, we see operators moving\nlaterally on servers of interest inside the network. Even though they are generally fast at\npicking their targets, we infer that their decisions are based on the results from the discovery\nphase. According to our reporting, the most frequent techniques that attackers use for\npivoting are:\n\n**SMB/WMI executable transfer and exec**\n**Pass the Hash**\n**RDP**\n**Remote service execution**\n\nCobalt Strike can facilitate all the above techniques and even RDP using SOCKS proxy.\n\n**SMB/WMI executable transfer and exec**\n\nAccording to our telemetry, this method is used the most by threat actors. We see them\nuploading their executable to their desired host with the “upload” Cobalt Strike command and\nexecute it using the “remote-exec” command as documented in the capabilities section\nabove but it can use psexec, winrm or wmi to execute a command and/or a beacon.\n\nThis is what we see when the beacon is uploaded using the upload command.\n\nThe following EIDs are created when executing remote-exec:\n\n\n-----\n\n4697: A service was installed in the system\n\n4624: Account logged on\n\n\n-----\n\n**Pass the Hash**\n\nCobalt Strike can use Mimikatz to generate and impersonate a token that can later be used\nto accomplish tasks in the context of that chosen user resource. The Cobalt Strike beacon\ncan also use this token to interact with network resources and run remote commands.\n\nAs you can see from the below execution example, executing Pass The Hash via Cobalt\nStrike will run cmd.exe to pass the token back to the beacon process via a named pipe :\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c echo 0291f1e69dd > \\\\.\\pipe\\82afc1\n\n```\nWe also see that the beacon interacts with LSASS (Sysmon EID 10). There are many\ndetection opportunities that defenders can take advantage of with the proper endpoint\nvisibility.\n\n\n-----\n\nPass the hash can also be detected by looking for:\n```\nWindows EID 4624\nLogon Type = 9\nAuthentication Package = Negotiate\nLogon Process = seclogo\n\n```\n[You can read more about detecting Pass The Hash here by Stealthbits and](https://stealthbits.com/blog/how-to-detect-pass-the-hash-attacks/) [here by Hausec.](https://hausec.com/2021/07/26/cobalt-strike-and-tradecraft/)\n\n**SMB remote service execution**\n\nIn the below example, the threat actors executed the “jump psexec” command to create a\nremote service on the remote machine (DC) and execute the service exe beacon. Cobalt\nStrike specifies an executable to create the remote service. Before it can do that, it will have\nto transfer the service executable to the target host. The name of the service executable is\n\n\n-----\n\ncreated with seven random alphanumeric -characters, e.g. <7-alphanumericcharacters>.exe”. This was changed after version 4.1 of Cobalt Strike (Getting the Bacon\nfrom the Beacon).\nThe attacker must have administrative privileges to complete this task.\n\nIn the screenshots below you can see the Windows Event IDs that are being generated as a\nresult of this execution. The first screenshot was from the security logs. However, defenders\nshould pay close attention to service creation events as they will be created and deleted\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n```\n4624: Logon\n4672: Special Logon\n4673: Sensitive Privilege Use\n4688: Process Creation\n5140: File Share\n4674: Sensitive Privilege Use\nService Creation events\n4697: A service was installed in the system. (security.evtx)\n7045: A service was installed in the system. (system.evtx)\n7034: A service terminated unexpectedly\n\n## Aggressor Scripts\n\n```\nEven though Cobalt Strike has many features out of the box, it is also highly extensible\nthanks to the [aggressor scripts. Aggressor scripts allows the operators to script and modify](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/index.html)\nmany of Cobalt Strike’s features. Operators can quickly load various scripts via the GUI\nconsole.\nIn most of the cases we are working on, we observe the execution of discovery commands\nafter the first beacon check-in with its C2 server. These events are very likely to be\nautomated by the threat actors. We have taken the below example as presented in the\nofficial Cobalt Strike documentation page to demonstrate this use case.\n```\non beacon_initial {\n$user = beacon_data($1) [\"user\"];\nbshell = ($1, \"net group \\\"Domain Admins\\\" /domain\")\n    bshell = ($1, \"nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\")\n    bshell = ($1, \"net localgroup \\\"Administrators\\\"\")\n    bshell = ($1, \"nltest /dclist\")\n}\n(NOTE: The \"$1\" argument is the id for the beacon.)\n\n```\nThe above script uses the function “on beacon_initial” to run the specified discovery\ncommands upon initial execution of the beacon. Cobalt Strike has comprehensive\n[documentation on all available functions. Another interesting function is the “alias” function. It](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#)\ncreates an alias command in the Beacon console, which can override the default Cobalt\nStrike commands.\nSearching for “Cobalt Strike aggressor scripts” on google will result in multiple GitHub\nrepositories. These repositories contain a collection of aggressor scripts to share with the\nopen-source community.

One of the most notable scripts Conti is using is the ZeroLogon BOF script](https://github.com/rsmudge/ZeroLogon-BOF/blob/master/dist/zerologon.cna)\ncreated by Raphael Mudge. The script compiles and runs the ZeroLogon exploit in memory.\nAnother file that we noticed was a collection of multiple aggressor scripts into one.
