As part of these attacks, they steal victim's Google credentials, which are\nthen used to create new YouTube Videos to distribute the malware,\" Frost told\nBleepingComputer.\n\nThe attacks start with the threat actors creating numerous YouTube channels filled with\nvideos about software cracks, licenses, how-to guides, cryptocurrency, mining, game\ncheats, VPN software, and pretty much any other popular category.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Example of a malicious YouTube channel**\nThese videos contain content that explains how to perform a task using a specific program\nor utility. Additionally, the YouTube video's description includes an alleged link to the\nassociated tool used to distribute the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malicious YouTube video pushing RedLine stealer**\nIf a video contains a bit.ly link, it will lead to another file-sharing site hosting the RedLine\npassword-stealing malware infection. However, if it includes an unshortened domain, it will\nredirect to a page on the taplink[.]cc domain to push Racoon Stealer, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Landing page for the Racoon Stealer**\nOnce a user becomes infected, the malware will proceed to scan all installed browsers and\nthe computer for cryptocurrency wallets, credit cards, passwords, and other data and\nupload it back to the attacker.\n\nGoogle told BleepingComputer that they are aware of the campaign and are taking action to\ndisrupt the activity.\n\n\"We are aware of this campaign and are currently taking action to block activity by this\nthreat actor and flagging all links to Safe Browsing. As always, we are continuously\nimproving our detection methods and investing in new tools and features that\nautomatically identify and stop threats like this one. It is also important that users\nremain aware of these types of threats and take appropriate action to further protect\nthemselves.\" - Google.\n\nGoogle also disclosed this week a phishing campaign that distributed password-stealing\ntrojans used to steal the accounts of YouTube Creators. These accounts were then sold on\ndark web markets or used to perform cryptocurrency scams.\n\n## Downloading software can be dangerous\n\n\n-----\n\nThese campaigns illustrate how important it is not to download programs from the Internet\nhaphazardly, as sites like YouTube can not vet every link added by video publishers.\n\nTherefore, a user should research a site before downloading and installing anything from it\nto determine if they have a good reputation and can be trusted. Even then, it is always\nsuggested that you first upload the program to a site like VirusTotal to confirm if it's safe to\nrun.\n\nIf you have accidentally fallen for this attack and installed a program from a similar link, it is\nstrongly suggested that you scan your computer with an antivirus program.\n\nAfter you have removed any malware detected in a virus scan, you should immediately\nchange any passwords saved in your browsers.\n\n_Update 10/21/21 7:28 PM EST: Added a statement from Google._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ZingoStealer infostealer drops more malware, cryptominers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-zingostealer-infostealer-drops-more-malware-cryptominers/)\n\n[Fake Binance NFT Mystery Box bots steal victim's crypto wallets](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-binance-nft-mystery-box-bots-steal-victims-crypto-wallets/)\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[Pixiv, DeviantArt artists hit by NFT job offers pushing malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pixiv-deviantart-artists-hit-by-nft-job-offers-pushing-malware/)\n\n[RIG Exploit Kit drops RedLine malware via Internet Explorer bug](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rig-exploit-kit-drops-redline-malware-via-internet-explorer-bug/)\n\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Password Stealing Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/password-stealing-trojan/)\n[Racoon Stealer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/racoon-stealer/)\n[RedLine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/redline/)\n[Video](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/video/)\n[YouTube](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/youtube/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
