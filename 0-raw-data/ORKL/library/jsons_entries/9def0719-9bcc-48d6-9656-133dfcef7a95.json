    "plain_text": "# The Introduction of the Jupyter InfoStealer/Backdoor\n\n**[blog.morphisec.com/jupyter-infostealer-backdoor-introduction](https://blog.morphisec.com/jupyter-infostealer-backdoor-introduction)**\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\n\n-----\n\nAn Infostealer is a trojan that is designed to gather and exfiltrate private and sensitive\ninformation from a target system. There is a large variety of info stealers active in the wild,\nsome are independent and some act as a modular part of a larger task such as a Banking\nTrojan (Trickbot) or a RAT.\n\nInfostealers are usually lightweight and stealthy payloads that do not have persistence or\npropagation (get-in and get-out) capabilities. This type of trojan is particularly difficult to\ndetect as it leaves an extremely small footprint.\n\nDuring what began as a routine incident response process, Morphisec has identified (and\nprevented) a new .NET infostealer variant called Jupyter. Morphisec discovered this variant\nas part of assisting a higher education customer in the U.S. with their incident response.\n\n**Jupyter is an infostealer that primarily targets Chromium, Firefox, and Chrome browser data.**\nHowever, its attack chain, delivery, and loader demonstrate additional capabilities for full\nbackdoor functionality. These include:\n\na C2 client\ndownload and execute malware\nexecution of PowerShell scripts and commands\nhollowing shellcode into legitimate windows configuration applications.\n\n**Jupyter’s attack chain typically starts with a downloaded zip file that contains an installer, an**\nexecutable that usually impersonates legitimate software such as Docx2Rtf. Some of these\ninstallers have maintained 0 detections in VirusTotal over the last 6 months, making it\nexceptional at bypassing most endpoint security scanning controls.\n\nUpon execution of the installer, a .NET C2 client (Jupyter **Loader) is injected into a memory.**\nThis client has a well defined communication protocol, versioning matrix, and has recently\nincluded persistence modules.\n\nThe client then downloads the next stage, a PowerShell command that executes the inmemory Jupyter .NET module. Both of the .Net components have similar code structures,\nobfuscation, and unique UID implementation. These commonalities indicate the development\nof an end to end framework for implementing the Info stealer.\n\nMorphisec has monitored a steady stream of forensic data to trace multiple versions of\n**Jupyter starting in May 2020. While many of the C2s are no longer active, they consistently**\nmapped to Russia when we were able to identify them.\n\nThis is not the only piece of evidence that this attack is likely Russian in origin. First, there is\nthe noticeable Russian to English misspelling of the planet name. Additionally, Morphisec\nresearchers ran a reverse Google Image search of the C2 admin panel image and were not\nsurprised to find the exact image on Russian-language forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Download the complete report for details on the changes and evolution of the Jupyter](https://engage.morphisec.com/threat-profile-jupyter-infostealer)\ninfostealer as well as its backdoor component.\n\n_Note: Morphisec CTO Michael Gorelik contributed to this analysis._\n\n[Contact SalesInquire via Azure](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:sales@morphisec.com)\n\n\n-----",
