Threat actors\nhad been caught targeting on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers via ProxyShell\n[vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have been dubbed, “worse than ProxyLogon”. Patches](https://doublepulsar.com/multiple-threat-actors-including-a-ransomware-gang-exploiting-exchange-proxyshell-vulnerabilities-c457b1655e9c)\nfor these vulnerabilities were made available in April & May, but many servers were still\nvulnerable.\n\nThat same day, [Morphisec Guard, our Zero Trust, Endpoint Protection Platform, successfully](https://www.morphisec.com/products/morphisec-guard-endpoint-protection)\ndetected and prevented the execution of Cobaltstrike beacons, which were delivered via a\nProxyShell exploit. Therefore, Morphisec actively protected the exchange servers of our\ncustomers.\n\nBelow is an example of one of the prevention events:\n\n\n-----\n\nCobaltstrike beacons delivered via ProxyShell exploit\n\n\nCmd execution:\n\n\n-----\n\n**cmd execution**\n\n\n**Cobalt C2:**\n\n**hxxp://at.miyazono[.]tk**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMorphisec demonstrates the vital nature of a strong prevention strategy for servers. It is our\nhope that more enterprises will move away from faulty detection-centered strategies and\nmove toward preventative, proactive solutions.\n\n### Subscribe to our blog\n\n\n-----\n\nStay in the loop with industry insight, cyber security trends, and cyber attack information and\ncompany updates.\n\n### Search Our Site\n\n Recent Posts\n\n[Contact SalesInquire via Azure](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:sales@morphisec.com)\n\n\n-----",
