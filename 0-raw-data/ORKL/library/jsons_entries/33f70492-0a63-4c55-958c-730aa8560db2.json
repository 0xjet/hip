Recently, Perception Point’s\nplatform intercepted a dangerous phishing campaign that would easily fool many users, as it\nlooks quite authentic.\n\nIn this post, we will present the attack and how Perception Point’s engines prevented it.\n\nIn this attack, we see legitimate-looking emails, spoofing the target company using name\nonly or full address, using a legitimate-looking payload in the form of an HTML attachment\n(the term payload, in this context, refers to any attack containing a file or a URL).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe HTML attachment embodies a well-made login page, spoofing the real brand login page,\nand once you type in your password, you’re redirected to the actual phished brand’s URL,\nand simultaneously your credentials are sent to the attacker.\n\n## The Mail.\n\nIn this phishing attack, the attacker tries to impersonate the targeted brand using the\nfollowing assets in the email:\n\nBrand logo\nBrand signature\nBrand email body design\nUsing the brand’s color pallet and language\n\nTo add credibility, the attacker takes advantage of typical messages that are sent by the\nbrand and mimics those messages.\n\nIn the following examples, you can see the attacker’s original emails, where he uses the\nbrand’s language and typical messages that the receiver would expect, based on past\ninteraction with known websites such as CMA CGM, Coinbase, and Indeed:\n\n## The Payload.\n\nTo complete the disguise, the attacker uses an HTML file containing a well-faked brand login\npage which upon credential submission actually redirects you to the real brand login page,\nmaking it look like it really belongs to the brand – all the while sending the submitted\ncredentials to the attacker.\n\nThe sign-in page completely spoofs the real brands. Here are our 3 examples from CMA\nCGM, Coinbase, and Indeed:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe credentials are sent to a different WordPress domain which was hacked by the same\n[attacker or bought by him (we saw in another article how attackers use compromised](https://cyberprotection-magazine.com/phisher-errors-lower-entry-barriers-for-wanna-be-phishers/?utm_content=161759375&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-10230855)\nWordPress sites to host phishing)\n\nHow did we prevent this attack?\n\nPerception Point’s [email threat protection prevents advanced anti-phishing algorithms. The](https://perception-point.io/channel-coverage/email/)\nsystem leverages image-recognition algorithms for the purpose of identifying brand\nimpersonation sites, as well as machine learning and other technologies to detect spoofing of\nnames, domains, and brands, to prevent any attack – even if highly disguised.\n\nPerception Point takes an active (“dynamic”) approach, rendering the HTML page on several\n[browsers, to ensure “zero-day” phishing attacks are intercepted well before reaching the](https://perception-point.io/detection-technology/zero-days-n-days/)\nend-user’s email box as opposed to other solutions that only use reputation and static\nengines.\n\n[For more information about our anti-phishing capabilities, we welcome you to check this link.](https://perception-point.io/detection-technology/phishing/)\n\n## Recommendations.\n\nAwareness and education of users could have helped to prevent this attack. It is important to\neducate users on the fact that an HTML attachment would never be sent by a legitimate\nbusiness, and they should never submit any personal information through such attachment.\n\nAlso, rather than clicking a link through an email to submit any requested information, it is\ngood best practice for users to actively surf to the website, in order to complete any\ntransaction that they were requested to complete in the email. And the final recommendation\nis of course to use an advanced security solution with dynamic analysis, to catch these kinds\nof attacks and others that have managed to evade users for any kind of reason.\n\n**IOCs.**\n\nSubject: CMA-CGM Receipt for [RECIPIENT ADDRESS] / Indeed account update for\n\n[RECIPIENT ADDRESS] / Unusual sign-in activity\n\n\n-----\n\n[From: Coinbase <no-reply@coinbase.com> / Indeed <employers-](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:no-reply@coinbase.com)\n[noreply@indeed.com> / CMA-CGM <it@fmx00.freemail.hu>](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:it@fmx00.freemail.hu)\nEmail server IP: 170.0.100.2 for all attacks\n\n\n-----",
