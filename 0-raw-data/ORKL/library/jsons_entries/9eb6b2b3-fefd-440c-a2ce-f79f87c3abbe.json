The Bank of Russia named Cobalt as the main threat to banks. The scale of its**\n**activities is fascinating: according to Europol, the group has been linked to thefts of**\n**approximately one billion euros from 100 banks in 40 countries: Russia, the United**\n**Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Romania, Belarus, Poland, Estonia, Bulgaria,**\n**Georgia, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Taiwan and Malaysia. But, in spite of the**\n**arrest of Cobalt's group leader, and (a little earlier) that of the head of the money**\n**mules group and several of his aides, remaining hackers continue to attack banks.**\n**Therefore, it is far too soon to dismiss Cobalt.**\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 23, 1:21 p.m (Moscow time) Group-IB tracked a new large-scale Cobalt cyberattack\non the leading banks of Russia and the CIS. It was like a challenge: phishing emails were\nsent acting as a major anti-virus vendor. Bank employees received a \"complaint\", in English,\nthat their computers allegedly violated legislation. The users were asked to carefully read the\nattached email and provide detailed explanations. If a response was not received within 48\nhours, the \"anti-virus company\" threatened to impose sanctions on the recipient's web\nresources. In order to download the email, the user was asked to follow a link, which would\nthen infect the Bank employee's computer.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nGroup-IB experts found a connection between the emails and Cobalt quite quickly: the\nunique Trojan \"Coblnt\", which has been in the inventory of the group since the end of\nDecember 2017, was involved in the attack. The emails were sent from a domain titled\n\"kaspersky-corporate[.]com. Upon review it was discovered that this domain name was\nregistered by a person with the same name as with previously registered domains for Cobalt\nattacks.\n\nHowever, there were peculiarities: the anti-virus vendor name was being used for the first\ntime, and the first wave of emails contained an empty ThreadKit exploit without any payload.\nPreviously, the Cobalt hackers did not make such mistakes. However, after finding the error,\nthe attackers corrected it.\n\nThe targets of this cyberattack might not only have been banks in Russia and the CIS: the\nphishing email was written in English, suggesting western banks as targets. The list of\npreviously targeted emails, which was analyzed by Group-IB experts, contained the\naddresses of over 80 organizations, including banks, mass media, insurance companies, IT\ncompanies all over the world.\n\nAgain, the company's experts rate the quality of phishing emails as high, the text in English is\nstylized as a \"legal complaint\", the fake website kaspersky-corporate[.]com also has a high\nlevel of quality, which is not typical of Cobalt. These and other signs again pointed to the\npossibility that the remaining members of the Cobalt group were conducting a joint operation\nwith other criminal groups, in particular, Anunak.\n\nDetailed information with technical indicators of the groups' operation is provided in the\nreport \"Cobalt: Evolution and Joint Operations\".\nTechnical overview\n\nOn May 23, 2018, phishing emails were sent from the following mailboxes:\n\n- ecive@kaspersky-corporate[.]com\n\n- nfo@kaspersky-corporate[.]com\n\n- .levis@kaspersky-corporate[.]com\n\nSubject: \"Technical Support\"\n\nThe kaspersky-corporate[.]com domain name was registered on May 21, 2018, and at the\nmoment it is resolved to the IP address 172.217.22[.]110. Previously, it was resolved to\n194.58.112[.]174 and 62.76.40[.]207.\n\nThe address of the mail server from which the emails were sent, mail.kasperskycorporate.com, has an IP address: 62.76.40[.]207.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email contains a link to the Complaint.doc file (hxxps://kasperskysecurity[.]com/Complaint.doc). After clicking the link, the user receives .doc exploit,\ngenerated by ThreadKit framework.\n\nComplaint.doc\n\nMD5 fa354151a3fc6d0dce69e8eeaa8cd197\n\nSize 192706 bytes\n\nHowever, the attacker made a mistake and forgot to configure the exploit build, which meant\nthat the exploit was empty and did not install anything in the system. Moreover, the hackers\ndid not change the standard decoy document set by the author by default. After opening an\nexploit, the error page was displayed.\n\nThe kaspersky-security.com domain name was registered on May 8 2018, and is resolved to:\n91.230.121[.]86.\n\nLater, the link led to the Complaint.scr file, CobInt.Downloader, which was the usual\nexecutable:\n\nMD5 7b55c7ae346efb428aaf63d25ca0fcc7\n\nsize 278016 bytes\n\nCompiled on May 18, 2018.\n\nThis program, classified as CobInt, is a self-developed backdoor of the Cobalt group. The\nmodular tool has capabilities to collect initial intelligence information about the compromised\nmachine and stream video from its desktop. If the operator decides that the system is of\ninterest, the backdoor will download and launch CobaltStrike framework stager.\n\nCobInt has C&C at foxsecit.com [185.86.79[.]156], and the domain was registered on May\n18, 2018.\n\nIt is worth noting that the domain names kaspersky-security[.]com and foxsecit[.]com are\nregistered by a person with the same name as with previously registered ibm-notice[.]com,\nwhich the Cobalt group used in March. And it in turn is associated with the domains\n\n\n-----\n\nspamhuas[.]com и hoteltoren[.]com.\n\nAnd the domains hoteltoren[.]com, dns-verifon[.]com, spam-huas[.]com, used by the Cobalt\ngroup to attack hotels and aggregators, confirm the fact that Cobalt hackers can diversify\nand extend their activities.\n\nConsidering that the latest attacks by the Anunak/Carbanak group were also targeting a\nnumber of hotels in order to obtain card data, the probability of a connection between these\ntwo hacker groups is high. This fact is not the main reason to link these groups, but it\nadditionally confirms our hypothesis of their joint operation in 2017.\n\nIn our new report on Cobalt activities, we revealed the relationship between these two\ncriminal groups, and carefully considered the joint attack on the banks.\nfoxsecit[.]com\n185.86.79[.]156\nkaspersky-security[.]com\n91.230.121[.]86\nibm-notice[.]com\n37.1.212[.]129\n37.1.211[.]165\n162.243.38[.]176\n162.243.38[.]178\nhoteltoren[.]com\n172.81.132[.]131\nkaspersky-corporate[.]com\n194.58.112[.]174\n62.76.40[.]207\n172.217.22[.]110\nmail.kaspersky-corporate[.]com\nibm-cert[.]com\n138.197.128[.]24\nibm-warning[.]com\nibm-notice[.]com\ndns-verifon[.]com\n107.181.160[.]16\nspamhuas[.]com\nswift-sipn[.]info\n85.143.166[.]158\nswift-fraud[.]com\n62.76.179[.]147\n185.86.78[.]139\n85.143.166[.]99\ncloud.yourdocument[.]biz\n\n\n-----\n\n31.148.219[.]177\necb-europa[.]info\n62.76.179[.]110\nsecure.n-document[.]biz\n185.180.196[.]53\napi.toshiba.org[.]kz\n31.148.219[.]195\n7b55c7ae346efb428aaf63d25ca0fcc7\nfa354151a3fc6d0dce69e8eeaa8cd197\ne5795f4418b28888a287e976f741dfbe\n\nrecive@kaspersky-corporate[.]com\ninfo@kaspersky-corporate[.]com\n[r.levis@kaspersky-corporate[.]com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:r.levis@kaspersky-corporate.com)\nv.constancio@ecb-europa[.]info\nadmin@swift-sipn[.]info\n\nJoint operations\n\n**The report, \"Cobalt: Evolution and Joint Operations\", provides an analysis of the**\ndevelopment of one of the most aggressive hacker groups responsible for financial damage\nto banks and financial services organizations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and\nSouth East Asia.\n\nCobalt has continued target internal financial services systems to steal from Card\nProcessing, ATMs, payment gateways and SWIFT systems. Group-IB experts provide\ninsights in our reporting directly from first hand incident response and covers their activity\nfrom the beginning of their operations in 2016.\n\nFirst success\n\nThe Cobalt group first committed thefts through SWIFT in Hong Kong, in the spring of 2016,\nand then in Ukraine. Millions of dollars were stolen in both cases, which required\ntechnologies and contacts with money mules that would be able to transfer large amounts of\nmoney withdrawn through SWIFT. These, and other factors, suggest that the group probably\ndid not act on its own.\n\nAfter the Ukrainian episode, attacks involving the system of interbank transfers suddenly\nceased. The Cobalt group switched to attacks on banks through card processing and ATMs,\nwhich was much simpler and safer for mules (people who deal with cash withdrawals).\nCobalt's first major independent success was the attack on First Bank in Taiwan, where the\nhackers managed to steal $2.18 million. In September 2016, Cobalt gained access to a bank\nin Kazakhstan. It took two months to prepare for the attack and explore the bank's\ninfrastructure. In November, Cobalt successfully stole about $600,000 through card\n\n\n-----\n\nprocessing. These attacks were then perfected and intensified. In 2017 the Cobalt group set\n\"personal best\" in attempting to steal EUR25 million from a European bank via card\nprocessing.\n\nCobalt only conducted new attacks on SWIFT 18 months after the April 2016 incidents. In\nDecember 2017 for the first time in Russia, they made a successful attack on a bank through\nSWIFT. This incident was the first SWIFT theft in the history of the Russian banking industry.\nFor a considerable time, Cobalt's continued success was because the hackers constantly\ntested new tools and schemes, often changing the location of attacks and familiarizing\nthemselves with how internal banking systems functioned. After gaining access to computers\non a target bank, Cobalt often spent three to four weeks to study the internal infrastructure of\nthe organization, collecting information about and observing the function of payments\nsystems, and only then conducting their attack. The average damage from each successful\nattack was 1.5 million USD based on incident response conducted by Group-IB and publicly\ndisclosed estimates from Europol.\n\nIn 2018, major strides were made to disrupt Cobalt group's operations when the leader was\narrested by Europol and local law enforcement in Alicante, Spain. Following this arrest,\nGroup-IB has continued to monitor new activity from the group, including attacks on March\n10th, March 15th and even on the day of the announced arrest, March 26th with spear\nphishing emails sent to organizations acting as SpamHaus, a non-profit organization that\nfights against spam.\nM & A\n\nGroup-IB has been investigating targeted attacks and cybercrime for over 15 years. Through\nincident response and joint investigations with law enforcement, we have monitored joint\noperations of various cybercriminal groups and the recruitment of individual hackers to\ncommit attacks on banks and other organizations. We expect that this trend will only intensify\nover the coming years. This report publicly discloses the joint operations of the Cobalt Group\nand Anunak (Carbanak) which were identified privately before arrests, and provides an\noverview of their key attacks in the period 2016 - 2017.\n\nIn 2016, Group-IB released the first public report on Cobalt providing detailed information on\ntheir attacks, which is available online. This attributed the appearance of the Cobalt group\nwith the termination of another infamous gang – Buhtrap. There was a three month break\nbetween the last Buhtrap attack and the first Cobalt attack.\n\nIn these three months, Cobalt prepared infrastructure and committed thefts through SWIFT\nin Hong Kong and Ukraine. We were confident that Cobalt was involved in these attacks\nbecause of the unique loader (stager). It was found in these incidents and has only been\nused by Cobalt. However, these attacks as well as their method of cashing out money were\nsurprisingly sophisticated. This indicated that Cobalt group did not act alone. Communication\nwith the Anunak group was discovered only 18 months later (in 2017), when during incident\n\n\n-----\n\nresponse we detected the same unique SSH backdoor that was employed by the Carbanak\ngroup in 2014.\nArms Race\n\nIn 2017, Cobalt invested heavily into their technology – from reverse engineering of malware\nsamples, it appears likely they enlisted a team of developers who created new tools for\nCobalt group, and adjusted exploits in order to evade detection by security vendors.\n\nTheir work allowed Cobalt to act more efficiently: hours after PoCs for 1-day exploits were\nposted publicly, Cobalt group began using modified versions in attacks on banks and\nupdated them in real time to avoid detection.\n\nNew tools and tactics allowed them to attack their targets - SWIFT, card processing, and\npayment gateways – with more success and set a \"personal best\" in attempting to steal over\n25 million EUR from a European bank via card processing.\nNew tools and modified programs employed by Cobalt in 2017 are described below:\n\nCobalt encrypted the network of one small bank in Russia using this now well- known\nransomware. After they failed to steal money through card processing, hackers used a selfdeveloped modification of Petya ransomware named PetrWrap. This low- level modification\nis written in C. It is worth noting that to create such modification the author should be able to\ndisassemble and clearly understand how and what they want to modify, which indicates a\nhigh level of technical skills. The majority of computers in the bank's network were disabled,\nwhich mildly complicated incident response and investigation.\n\nIn May, they began testing a new tool, the PE library (DLL), which was used as a\nreconnaissance module. However, this tool was never employed by the group, as they\nshifted to test a new JavaScript backdoor, which was designed to perform reconnaissance\nand complicate their discovery and analysis. This backdoor was used for the first time in\nattacks leveraging compromised servers of an integrator in the US. The malware was\ndelivered through high-quality phishing emails with real reports from the SWIFT system\nattached. The program was used in attacks not only in the CIS countries and Eastern\nEurope, but also for attacks on western English-speaking companies.\n\nIn September Cobalt implemented JavaScript backdoor functionality in the executable file,\nbut without the ability to load and run. In September attack they used InfoStealer 0.2. This\nonly exists in memory and does not leave traces in the file system. This tool was employed in\nattacks on insurance agencies, the media, and software developers, whose compromised\ninfrastructure was further used for attacks on banks.\n\nIn December, they started using a new Java loader, generated by the CobaltStrike\nframework, but with a unique payload that loads a unique Recon backdoor Coblnt. The\nbackdoor receives the modules from the C&C server for further execution. This complicated\n\n\n-----\n\nattack vector is very similar to the tactics used in targeted attacks by professional statesponsored attackers and the Lurk group.\n\nSupply chain attacks and non-typical targets\n\nA major change in the tactics of Cobalt was the shift towards indirect attacks. In February\n2017, we tracked the first successful attack on a system integrator, which was then used as\na vehicle by Cobalt for further attacks on companies in Russia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, as well\nas their subsidiaries in other countries. During the next 9 months, Cobalt infiltrated at least\nfour integrators located in Ukraine, the US, and Russia.\n\nIn March 2017, Cobalt began to prepare attacks on companies that provide electronic wallets\nand payment terminals. In April, they adopted an attack scheme and created a unique\nprogram to automatically generate fraudulent payments through payment gateways. In\nSeptember, the group for the first time attacked an e-wallet vendor and successfully stole\nfunds through a payment gateway. In this incident Group-IB was able to discover clear\nevidence of Carbanak involvement.\n\nMore recently, the group has begun to attack insurance agencies and the media. In these\nattacks, they obtain control of mail servers or accounts to further use the victim's\ninfrastructure for attacks on banks.\nCobalt: reboot\n\nCobalt returned in 2018 in fine form - both in terms of technology and infrastructure. The\nMarch arrest of the Cobalt gang leader in Spain has not yet led to the conclusion of attacks\nagainst financial institutions by this group. Remaining members reduced their activity in\nRussia and the CIS, temporarily focusing on other regions. It is interesting to note that\nphishing emails, which were tracked in March, purported to be from US companies, for\nexample, IBM, Verifon, Spamhaus:\n\n**On March 7-10, letters were sent from the domains ibm-cert.com, ibm-warning.com, ibm-**\nnotice.com.\n\n**On March 15, a new phishing campaign was detected – hackers employed the dns-verifon.**\ncom domain, leveraging the brand of VeriFon, the largest vendor of POS terminals.\n\n**On March 26, phishing emails were sent acting as SpamHaus, a well-known non-profit**\norganization that fights against spam and phishing. For this campaign, the attackers\nregistered the spamhuas.com domain, which is indistinguishable from the official one\n(spamhaus. org).\n\n**On April 3, emails sent from the compromised mail server of the Swedish company were**\ntracked.\n\n\n-----\n\n**On May 18, Cobalt sent emails from the name of SWIFT with JS backdoor, previously used**\nin the Cobalt's attack against USA and Europe banks.\n\n**On May 23, Group-IB tracked a new large-scale Cobalt cyberattack on the leading banks of**\nRussia and the CIS. It was like a challenge: phishing emails were sent acting as a major antivirus vendor.\n\n**On May 28, hackers sent emails as European Central Bank with JS-backdoor.**\n\nGiven the technological evolution of the group and the fact that in spite of the arrests of the\nCobalt gang leader and malware writer, Cobalt has continued to strike, the most likely\nscenario is that remaining Cobalt members will join existing groups or a fresh \"redistribution\"\nwill result in a new cybercriminal organization 'Cobalt 2.0' continuing attacks on banks\nworldwide.\n\n\"Cobalt: their evolution and joint operations\" learn about Cobalt's development and\nmodification of tools and tactics which were used to steal approximately 1 billion dollars from\nover 100 banks in 40 different countries.\n\nRequest\n\n\n-----",
