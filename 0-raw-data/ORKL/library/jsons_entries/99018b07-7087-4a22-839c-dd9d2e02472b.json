It was hard not to given that\nit ran on the front page [(Sanger, 2018) .1](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/european-diplomats-cables-hacked.html)\n\n\nBut the story caught our attention for other reasons too. It was based in large measure on a report titled\n_[Phishing Diplomacy, published by Area 1 on the same day (Area 1, 2018) . The researchers attributed2](https://cdn.area1security.com/reports/Area-1-Security-PhishingDiplomacy.pdf)_\nthe compromise of the diplomatic cables and the targeting of over 100 additional organizations\n(including foreign and finance ministries, think-tanks and trade unions) to the Chinese government’s\nStrategic Support Force (SSF), a Chinese military organization, without any explanation as to how they\narrived at that attribution assessment.\n\nEven more intriguing was the fact that, according to the Times report, Area 1 researchers provided the\ncompromised cables to the newspaper. The Times quoted extensively from the cables – a move that\nraised eyebrows and prompted interesting legal and ethical questions for both Area 1 and the Times.\n\nBut legal and ethical questions aside, there was yet another reason why we took notice of this report.\nIncluded in the Area 1 “indicators of compromise” (IoCs) was a single website/domain name they said\nthe Chinese SSF used for Command-and-Control (C2) in both targeted attacks.\n\nAs we will demonstrate in greater detail below, we connected this domain to a host of other, disparate\nChinese APT groups whose tasking, targeting, and toolsets have been literally all over the map. We\nalso found evidence suggesting that different Chinese APT groups have also been using the same\nmalware - and in some cases, the same exploit builder.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe attribution of forensic artifacts to specific threat actors, at whatever level, is an evolving, dynamic\nprocess - not a static one. Yet, much of the public research that originally defined the “known APT\ngroups” appears to be frozen in time\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen private security companies began declaring APT groups and minting an alphabet soup of threat\nactors bearing nicknames with numbers, animals, elements, demons and gods, they sketched profiles\nof nation states and their proxies by invoking the intelligence-version of a signature.\n\nPictures emerged that reflected a particular group’s choice of tactics, techniques and attack procedures\n– the so-called TTPs that shape the way we tend to think about Iranian, Chinese, Russian and North\nKorean threats. This alphabet soup of nicknames engendered consequences not just for risk\nmanagement at the enterprise level, but for national security policy as well.\n\nMany of these profiles were sketched nearly a decade ago; however, attribution is as much a function of\na given window of technical evidence as it is a function of a given window of time.\n\nIn the case of the forensic artifacts Area 1 associated with China’s SSF, evidence of shared or\noverlapping tools by Chinese groups once thought to operate separately or to employ separate targeting\nsuggests one of several potential developments:\n\nIt could indicate that Chinese government groups are expanding their reach beyond traditional\nboundaries or have been given different tasking/targeting\nIt could indicate the Chinese government cyber effort has matured enough such that different\ngroups – even at different agencies – are now comfortable sharing tools and infrastructure\nIt could indicate that the Chinese have developed some method of centralizing the activity of\ndisparate government units for the purposes of coordinating technical access outside of China\n\nKnowing which assessment is correct is probably of more interest to governments than it is to targeted\norganizations. Of course, every attack by a suspected state actor holds significance for both groups.\nThere are always tactical considerations for the target, and there are often national security\nconsiderations for governments, policy makers, and those of us trying to understand the behavior of\nnation states in cyberspace.\n\nStill, evidence of a shifting profile of Chinese APT groups offers a lesson for network defenders, as it\nimpacts the threat modeling and risk assessment of organizations who have positioned themselves\nbased on:\n\n1. A dated understanding of these groups and their preferred targets, or\n2. An explicit reliance on “indicators of compromise,” or\n3. Both.\n\nWhat follows is discussion of our findings, detailing the crossover in malware and C2 infrastructure.\nSome, though not all, of these findings were arrived at independently by Anomali Labs, who published\nthem last month [(Anomali Labs, 2019) . Anomali did not, for example, make the connection to the Area3](https://www.anomali.com/blog/analyzing-digital-quartermasters-in-asia-do-chinese-and-indian-apts-have-a-shared-supply-chain)\n1 research. And while our findings regarding some of the malware and infrastructure crossover support\nthose of Anomali, we do not share their conclusion that the crossover portends supply chains or\n“quartermasters” shared between strategic rivals China and India.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe Area 1 Phishing Diplomacy report that enabled the Times story attributed the attacks on the\nEuropean Union and other related targets to China’s Strategic Support Force. The SSF was modeled on\nAmerica’s Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), a blended unit that was initially part of Strategic Command\n(STRATCOM) before being stood up as its own combatant command\n\n\n-----\n\nThe SSF was created in 2015 following a reorganization of several disparate Chinese military units\nresponsible for space operations, electronic warfare, information operations, psychological operations,\nespionage, technical reconnaissance, and network warfare. Included in the reorganization was the Third\nDepartment of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), members of which were famously called out by the\nU.S. Justice Department as the threat actors behind the “APT 1” persona.\n\nBut while China’s Third Department has been traditionally focused on external operations, typically in\nsupport of military objectives, we found a connection via the infrastructure included in the Area 1 report\nto groups associated in other security research with Chinese government efforts to spy on and conduct\noperations against internal groups perceived as separatist or threatening to the government – a task\nnormally left either to the (relatively new) National Security Commission by way of the operations of the\nstate police or, by extension, the Ministry of State Security.\n\nThe Ministry of State Security is a Chinese civilian federal agency thought to be comprised of a\ncombination of foreign intelligence and domestic intelligence services – sort of a combination of the CIA\nand FBI, if thought of in American terms.\n\nThe MSS has recently been the target of the U.S. Justice Department, which named the group (and\npublicly associated it with APT10 / a.k.a. “menuPass”) in a couple of recent indictments (U.S. vs. Zhang\nZhang-Gui et al, 2018) (U.S. vs. Zhu Hua et al, 2018) [indictment numbers 13CR3132-H and4 5\n18CRM891, respectively]. The MSS was also named by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review\nCommission as the actor “widely believed” to be “either responsible for, or the ultimate benefactor of,\nthe OPM breach” [(USCC, 2016) .6](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/transcripts/June%2009%2C%202016%20Hearing%20Transcript.pdf)\n\n\nChief among China’s domestic security concerns, and presumably targets of the MSS, have been\ngroups known informally as the Five Poisons.\n\nThe name is a reference to five groups whose ideological, religious, or cultural differences have either\ndirectly challenged the ruling party structure or have put them at odds with the government’s singular\n“One China” concept of its national identity. Traditionally, the Five Poisons has referred to:\n\nMembers of the Muslim minority of ethnic Uyghurs\nFollowers of Falun Gong\nSupporters of Taiwanese independence\nTibetans\nActivists in support of democracy in China\n\nOperations targeting these groups have often employed the use of a malware family identified by Palo\n[Alto Networks as “Reaver” (Miller-Osborn, 2017) . Palo Alto also associated Reaver with related7](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/11/unit42-new-malware-with-ties-to-sunorcal-discovered/)\nmalware known by the names SUTR and SunOrcal in campaigns targeting the Taiwanese presidential\n[election, as researched by PWC (Yip, 2016), and the Five Poisons more broadly as reported by Citizen8](https://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/03/taiwant-election-targetting.html)\n[Lab (Hardy, 2013) . We found even newer variants and other as-yet unnamed samples as we started to9](https://citizenlab.ca/2013/08/surtr-malware-family-targeting-the-tibetan-community/)\ndive in further.\n\n\nWhether Reaver, and its predecessors, are tools wielded by Chinese groups focused internally on\nseparatist movements, or by a division of the Chinese Army re-tasked to serve the same mission, is\nunknown. However, it is clear that the group behind Reaver used some of the same infrastructure as the\ngroup behind the Area 1 attacks on the European Union and United Nations (ostensibly, the military\nSSF).\n\n\n-----\n\nIn its Phishing Diplomacy report, Area 1 published a single C2 domain, updates.organiccrap[.]com,\nwhich previously resolved to the IP address 50.117.96[.]147 between November 16, 2017 and July 27,\n2018, a period of roughly eight months.\n\nExactly one day before that “organiccrap” domain began resolving to that IP address, another domain\nwas resolving to it, for a narrow period of two weeks (October 31, 2017 – November 15, 2017). That\ndomain, tashdqdxp[.]com, was included in the Palo Alto research, where they indicated that it was used\nin conjunction with Reaver.\n\nWe found that several additional, recent Reaver C2 domains also resolved to this IP address including\n_etwefsfj[.]com, sfafgeht[.]com, and asdasfdsre[.]com. The earliest resolution occurred on May 1, 2018_\nand the latest on January 10, 2019.\n\nAs we mentioned above, Palo Alto had previously linked this Reaver domain and other Reaver samples\nvia passive DNS to a number of SunOrcal domains. They include:\n\n_www.weryhstui[.]com, www.fyoutside[.]com, and www.olinaodi[.]com._\n\nPalo Alto also linked the same SunOrcal activity set to a number of previous reports that shed light on\n[apparent Chinese government targeting of Hong Kong activists, among others (Brooks, 2016)10,](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/04/between-hong-kong-and-burma/)\n[(Wilson, 2016) .11](https://asert.arbornetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ASERT-Threat-Intelligence-Report-2016-03-The-Four-Element-Sword-Engagement.pdf)\n\n\nThe new Reaver variants we found appear to use a hybrid subset of new and old network infrastructure.\nWe break them down in the following technical section, along with a description of a new backdoor we\ndiscovered along the way.\n\n## Technical Findings: Malware\n\n**_Reaver.v4_**\n\nThe new 2018 Reaver samples continued to operate in a manner similar to what was first described by\nPalo Alto as “Reaver.v3 TCP Payload.” The only real difference was in the encoding of the relative\naddress string lookup table and configuration data.\n\nXOR decoding was abandoned in favor of a custom cipher which used an incrementing right bit shift.\nInterestingly, this cipher also did a reverse lookup for values which had previously been computed. The\ndecrypted table looked very similar to what was previously identified:\n\nRA@10016=ADVAPI32.dll\n\nRA@10017=GetUserNameA\n\n_[TRUNCATED]_\n\nRA@10313=ChangeServiceConfig2A\n\nRA@10314=QueryServiceConfig2A\n\n_Figure 1: Decoded String Look Up Table_\n\nThe configuration of the malware was also encoded similarly and contained all of the information\npreviously described by Palo Alto -- with one additional string: a network callback domain, network port,\nbeacon interval, a service name, service description, service display name, and now two hardcoded\nstrings “n-0625” and “2017-tq-s”:\n\n\n-----\n\n00003552 00 00 00 00 50 00 00 00 10 27 00 00 01 00 00 00 ....P.... ......\n00003568 00 00 00 00 00 B7 04 00 77 77 77 2E 66 68 6A 73 .....·..www.fhjs\n00003584 64 6B 6C 61 2E 63 6F 6D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 dkla.com........\n00003600 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00003696 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 6E 2D 30 36 32 35 00 00 ........n-0625..\n00003712 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00003760 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 4E 74 6D 73 53 76 63 00 ........NtmsSvc.\n00003776 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00003792 57 69 6E 64 6F 77 73 20 4D 75 6C 74 69 6D 65 64 Windows Multimed\n00003808 69 61 20 53 65 72 76 69 63 65 20 66 6F 72 20 6D ia Service for m\n00003824 65 64 69 61 20 64 65 76 69 63 65 73 00 00 00 00 edia devices....\n00003840 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n00003888 57 69 6E 64 6F 77 73 20 4D 75 6C 74 69 6D 65 64 Windows Multimed\n00003904 69 61 20 53 65 72 76 69 63 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 ia Service......\n00003920 32 30 31 37 2D 74 71 2D 73 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2017-tq-s.......\n\n_Figure 2: Decrypted Configuration Data_\n\nThe network protocol remained largely unchanged from Palo Alto’s report and will not be covered here,\nfor the sake of brevity.\n\n## Sparkle Payload\n\nDuring the investigation into the newer Reaver network infrastructure, we identified an entirely new type\nof backdoor deployed in very limited instances. BlackBerry Cylance named this payload “Sparkle” to shy\naway from the ominous military lexicon commonly “deployed” by the information security industry.\n\nAn associated dropper was also identified:\n\n295c942389ebdbf8ff9a8b1a81d3f63cb60577fa57ecaa660ce347666973b4f3\n\nThe payload attempted to read data from the file %Temp%\\wsm56d1.tmp and communicated to the\ndomain www.sfeeleyses[.]com on TCP port 443.\n\n## Reaver.v4 Downloader\n\nWe identified a unique Reaver downloader during our analysis which was coincidentally the only sample\nwhich had a valid PE checksum. This binary would download an encoded payload from\n_hxxxp://www[.]htuditey[.]com/l-0424.bmp and save it to a file named: w90sD32rS3H2jP75.bmp._\n\nOnce saved, the downloader would decode a regular executable dropper from it using an incrementing\nXOR routine starting with the value 0xFF at file offset 0x36.\n\nThis executable content would be written to disk as %Temp%\\mstk.exe, and the downloader additionally\ncreated an associated Run key with it under the current user’s registry hive to establish persistence.\nThe following python snippet can be easily adapted for other keys as well:\n\ndef inc_xor(buf,start):\nout = ''\n\nkey = int(start, 16)\n\n\n-----\n\nfor i in buf:\nif key < 256:\nout += chr(ord(i) ^ key)\nelse:\nkey = 0\nout += chr(ord(i) ^ key)\nkey +=1\nreturn out\n\ninc_xor(binary_data, 'FF')\n\n_Figure 3: Python Incrementing XOR Routine_\n\nThe downloader also contained a highly unique PDB path within it as well:\n\ne:\\VS2005 Project\\Doc_Pack\\DownloadSample\\release\\DownloadSample.pdb\n\nThe PDB path suggested that this downloader was likely only one part of a larger malicious document\nproject.\n\n## Technical Findings: Exploit\n\n**_Malicious Documents Delivering Reaver_**\n\nAfter examining the new Reaver malware, we then turned our attention to the delivery method. What we\nfound was an exploit document leveraging CVE-2017-11882:\n\n9ac09ea38c9cf11ca13a2c3dbdcfbe0fe4a15cb609be451f7159ecebdd20d311\n\nAfter analyzing this document, we were able to identify a handful of others leveraging the same exploit\nthat took advantage of the “Package” ActiveX Control to drop a temporary file to\n_%AppData%\\Local\\Temp\\8.t._\n\nThis is a particularly interesting trick that first rose to popularity in 2014 and appears to have dropped off\nalmost entirely. Simply opening an RTF document is enough to trigger the behavior if the ActiveX control\nis not disabled via:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\Common\\COM Compatibility\\{F20DA720-C02F-11CE-927B0800095AE340}\n\nUpon closing the document, the temporary file will be removed. The native Windows program\n“Wordpad.exe” is also capable of triggering this same behavior regardless of the aforementioned\nregistry key. [(Li, 2014)12.](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/dropping-files-temp-folder-raises-security-concerns/)\n\nIn cases where the exploit was successfully triggered, it would launch some shellcode to decrypt and\nexecute the content stored within “8.t”. The shellcode within the document utilized a unique custom\nXOR cipher with a seed value of “0x7BF48E63” shown in python below:\n\ndef mixer(eax):\n\necx = eax\n\necx = ecx >> 0x1B\n\n\n-----\n\necx = ecx eax\necx = ecx >> 3\necx = ecx ^ eax\neax = eax + eax\necx = ecx & 1\neax = eax | ecx\nreturn eax\n\ndef custom_loop(buf):\neax = 0x7BF48E63\nout = ''\nfor x in buf:\nedi = 7\nwhile edi !=0 :\neax = mixer(eax)\nedi -=1\nxor_key = eax & 0xFF\nout += chr(ord(x)^xor_key)\nreturn out\n\n_Figure 4: Python Code to Decrypt Contents Stored in Package Object_\n\nWe were able to locate two additional documents which operated in a similar fashion and retrieved\nencoded payloads from www.htuditey[.]com. We confirmed these documents to be directly related to the\ngroup behind the Reaver malware.\n\nWe also found several other documents which used the same executable encoding mechanism and\nseed value; however, these documents had previously been publicly attributed to “Gobelin Panda”\n[(Sebdraven, 2018)13 and dropped an entirely different payload named “Sisfader RAT”](https://medium.com/@Sebdraven/gobelin-panda-against-the-bears-1f462d00e3a4) (Humphrey,\n2018)14.\n\n\nGobelin Panda, a.k.a. Goblin Panda, is a group that has been identified by CrowdStrike as a Chinese\nthreat actor known to target defense, energy, and government organizations belonging to South Asian\ncountries - especially Vietnam. CrowdStrike observed Goblin Panda activity spike as tensions among\nSouth China Sea nations has risen.\n\nThough we are not able to determine whether Gob(e)lin Panda is associated with the MSS or the SSF, it\nis clear to us that the exploit builder used in the set of samples we have discussed above has been\nshared across multiple Chinese APT groups, including Leviathan, Temp.Periscope and Kryptonite\nPanda.\n\nAnomali also published a comprehensive report on this series of exploit documents and termed the\nReaver family “Temp.Trident” [(Anomali Labs, 2019)15. [Editor’s note: corrected on May 29, 2019].](https://www.anomali.com/blog/analyzing-digital-quartermasters-in-asia-do-chinese-and-indian-apts-have-a-shared-supply-chain)\n\n## Technical Findings: Infrastructure\n\nAll the domains we have identified in this report used random combinations of letters and were\nregistered using the e-mail address yuming[at]nuo.cn, which seems to be a generic address for the\nhosting provider (www.nuo[.]cn).\n\n\n-----\n\nThis provider has a direct link to the Chinese group or groups using or sharing this infrastructure, going\nall the way back to 2013, where it was used to register the domain, eyestouch256[.]com. The following\nsix domains were registered on November 15, 2017:\n\netwefsfj[.]com\nsfafgeht[.]com\nstrenthuy[.]com\nfhjsdkla[.]com\nhtuditey[.]com\nxuitrdgt[.]com\n\nAs a reminder, that date marked the last day in which the tashdqdxp[.]com and associated IP was used\nin connection with Reaver (according to Palo Alto, which published that information five days later), and\none day before Area 1 says the SFF started using the same IP address with a new domain for the\nattack on the European Union.\n\nWe found that six other domains were registered on two different earlier dates in 2017 and were likely\nnot operationalized to quite the same extent.

That’s because, as our analysis has shown, we assess that the Chinese threat groups\nare either sharing “Indicators of Compromise” or adopting the targets and tasking of other Chinese\ngroups.\n\nThat means that if defenders are overly reliant on blacklisting indicators of compromise, or else making\nrisk assessments based on what they perceive the interests of Chinese APT groups to be, they will\nremain vulnerable to an attacker who is changing both its tools and its targets.\n\nTo borrow an analogy from the health industry, defenders should make an effort to vaccinate themselves\nin hopes of preventing sickness, not just try to bar entry to everyone they know is sick.\n\n## Appendix\n\n**_Hashes:_**\n\n**_Reaver 2019 v.4 Backdoors_**\n\nff973e7c7a9d629011fb8c5bf766216e5e33da66656d9bf8386054fd8e99262a\n\n126f2e4d6766d901ea0cb78b8cb4827be7d6aecea0c817eef6b572cb5b4e2442\n\n1d7a3eaf48a19908f4f6cdffa596b4db1d5346b47958424b72e186af061367c6\n\n**_Reaver 2018 v.4 Backdoors_**\n\n363f7b8024efd8205ae8e74bfdc387b3a5aad8ff166cbc2475fad5d3a708dcb0\n\n78b7b0253020edc80ea31eb60b42e47dec83b7cf41c952949c80b82679ece744\n\nda9e1317ecc3cbceda45a838d954b8750d118ef1ce072b32c913819780fbb9b7\n\ne1793859b3a3136c5d816fe7300303098847894241052820429a0584eed45ed1\n\n**_Reaver 2019 v.4 Droppers_**\n\nd6305a64d45e6443bf3bad2ccc4d2144f4632aec0ae1f3dedb1e526e1790770b\n\n**_Reaver 2018 v.4 Droppers_**\n\n738d5326c48fd81d147927d6e5d43933956e8f6a36f085b2130b780ccfc3fa86\n\n538dd5cb32482a30a3676b328f275f37cbe16883a4368d3959b68e8f97fe70a1\n\n\n-----\n\nb36464ea655330b993a5fc992ddb981f503bbeb4f7cb081d5da67f83a4b49049\n\n7f5f294d96c3fb36499c9049cdb337e58f06fb8531b3eac796f8deaf88060ed2\n\n15ab48aaaabd4462ac8ba5b511879a0f4502408a500b556078ca129fc92c2628\n\n**_Reaver Downloader:_**\n\n44cda3eea271613ddfc820014c9fdd829c30ebbe57614e1a4dafaf76905301dc\n\n9aab954f9fb84c82e588b2c90b1bb7eb2a65b08c739358a320d767650b6d9453\n\n8971ac72939783d14d0ff0d4bebe1764b69e54a15627a149708f4253531a9df2\n\n**_Reaver Exploit Documents:_**\n\n1c6cb02ae9dceb3a647260f409dd837fa5c66794804623c9cf97395cf406d4df\n\n3df19abbf961a6d795362f5408d65aa5a31e34620aa3518a010d4d6d9e79c60e\n\n9ac09ea38c9cf11ca13a2c3dbdcfbe0fe4a15cb609be451f7159ecebdd20d311\n\n## Command & Control Infrastructure\n\n**_Domains:_**\n\nasdasfdsre[.]com\n\ndjstoern[.]com\n\netwefsfj[.]com\n\nfdvvbnf[.]com\n\nfhjsdkla[.]com\n\nhdjyrtuy[.]com\n\nhtuditey[.]com\n\njorehkn[.]com\n\nmenrotefit[.]com\n\nnorejike[.]com\n\npoticxny[.]com\n\nqidaterstu[.]com\n\nsfafgeht[.]com\n\nstrenthuy[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nxuitrdgt[.]com\n\n**_IP Addresses:_**\n\n_103.226.153[.]235_\n\n_103.234.99[.]74_\n\n_103.36.54[.]119_\n\n_103.61.137[.]210_\n\n_104.160.190[.]2_\n\n_104.160.191[.]10_\n\n_104.224.141[.]75_\n\n_107.161.80[.]56_\n\n_142.252.252[.]241_\n\n_182.16.118[.]91_\n\n_204.44.65[.]128_\n\n_208.77.43[.]76_\n\n_210.56.51[.]66_\n\n_45.121.48[.]12_\n\n_45.121.50[.]19_\n\n_45.121.50[.]5_\n\n_50.117.38[.]74_\n\n_50.117.47[.]129_\n\n_50.117.96[.]147_\n\n_64.32.22[.]151_\n\n_67.229.134[.]170_\n\n_67.229.159[.]218_\n\n_67.229.168[.]2_\n\n_67.229.28[.]82_\n\n_74.121.151[.]158_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Works Cited\n\n[1] Sanger, D. a.
