The company has also resorted\nto using Gmail addresses while its email systems are offline.\n\nWhen BleepingComputer reached out to ADA for comment about the attack, we were told\nthat they were just suffering technical issues and were investigating the cause of the\ndisruption.\n\nHowever, emails sent out to ADA members and seen by BleepingComputer paint a much\ngrimmer picture.\n\nLast night, the ADA began emailing its members, including state dental associations,\npractices, and organizations, with an update about the attack and information that can be\nshared with the recipient's members.\n\n\"On Friday, the ADA fell victim to a cybersecurity incident that caused a disruption to certain\nsystems, including Aptify and ADA email, telephone and Web chat. Upon discovery, the\nADA immediately responded by taking affected systems offline and commenced an\ninvestigation into the nature and scope of the disruption,\" reads an email sent to ADA\nmembers and seen by BleepingComputer.\n\nThe email says that they are working with \"third-party cybersecurity specialists\" and law\nenforcement to investigate the attack.\n\n\"Federal law enforcement has been notified and we are cooperating with them in this active\ninvestigation, so we ask for your understanding that we must limit the amount of detail that\nwe can share at this time. In the meantime, we understand you may receive questions\nabout the incident from members,\" continues the email sent by ADA to its members.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important that we provide members with accurate information regarding this incident. It\nis equally important that we respond with accurate information while also being cognizant\nthat this is an active investigation.\"\n\nThe ADA's cyberattack is not only affecting their website, but also state dental associations,\nsuch as those in [New York,](https://www.nysdental.org/news-publications/news/2022/04/25/ada-technical-issue-update) [Virginia, and](https://www.vadental.org/news-details/2022/04/25/ada-technical-issues-impacting-virginia) [Florida, who rely on ADA's online services to](https://www.floridadental.org/)\nregister an account or pay dues.\n\n**Outage message on New York's Dental Association website**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe ADA says that preliminary investigations do not indicate that member information or\nother data has been compromised. However, the description of this attack sounds like a\nransomware attack, and almost every initial press statement says the same thing, with\nstolen data later published by threat actors.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted the ADA with further questions about the attack but has\nnot heard back.\n\n## Black Basta ransomware gang leaks ADA's data\n\nA new ransomware gang known as Black Basta has claimed responsibility for the attack on\nthe American Dental Association.\n\n[Soon after publishing this story, security researcher MalwareHunterTeam told](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nBleepingComputer that the threat actors had begun leaking data allegedly stolen during the\nattack on ADA.\n\n\n-----\n\n**ADA on Black Basta ransomware data leak site**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe data leak site claims to have leaked approximately 2.8 GB of data, which the threat\nactors state is 30% of the data stolen in the attack.\n\nThis data includes W2 forms, NDAs, accounting spreadsheets, and information on ADA\nmembers from screenshots shared on the data leak page.\n\nThe leaking of dentists' information can be particularly damaging, as small dental practices\ntypically do not have dedicated security or network admins.\n\nThis lack of dedicated IT personnel typically causes their networks to be less secure than\nlarger corporations with a significant security budget.\n\nDue to the potential leak of ADA members' information to other threat actors, it is strongly\nadvised that all ADA members be on the lookout for targeted spear-phishing emails that\nattempt to steal login credentials or other sensitive information.\n\n\n-----\n\nDental practices should also ensure they are not exposing any remote desktop services or\nother potential avenues for initial access to their networks and should place them behind a\nVPN instead.\n\n_Update 4/26/22: Added information about Black Basta ransomware claiming the attack on_\n_ADA._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 13th 2022 - A National Emergency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-13th-2022-a-national-emergency/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - April 29th 2022 - New operations emerge](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-april-29th-2022-new-operations-emerge/)\n\n[ADA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ada/)\n[American Dental Association](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/american-dental-association/)\n[Black Basta](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/black-basta/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Dentist](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/dentist/)\n[Outage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/outage/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
