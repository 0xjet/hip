However, two notable 2021](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\ncampaigns attributed to this group attempted to distribute malware that could be used\nfor information gathering.\nTA406 engages in espionage, cyber crime and sextortion.\n\n## Overview\n\nThroughout 2021, Proofpoint has tracked ongoing credential theft campaigns from TA406, an\nactor associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Our analysts have\ntracked TA406 campaigns targeting customers since 2018, but the threat actor’s campaigns\nremained low in volume until the beginning of January 2021. From January through June\n2021, Proofpoint observed almost weekly campaigns targeting foreign policy experts,\njournalists and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn this report, we describe in detail many of the campaigns and behaviors associated with an\nactor operating on behalf of the North Korean government: TA406. (See Figure 1.) We begin\nby explaining how TA406 is associated with Kimsuky, a threat actor name broadly tracked by\n\n\n-----\n\nthe threat intelligence community. We then elaborate on how Proofpoint tracks the activity of\nKimsuky as three separate threat actors—TA406, TA408 and TA427. Also, we detail the\ndifferences between these actors, based on Proofpoint’s visibility.\n\nThis report also examines campaign timing and targeting by TA406, and it provides a look\n[into how TA406 conducts phishing campaigns, including the tools and services used.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/phishing)\n\nTA406 employs both malware and credential harvesting in espionage and informationgathering campaigns. This report details several examples of each, including different types\nof credential collection and two implants used by TA406 that haven’t been discussed before\nin open-source reporting. And finally, like all other North Korean state-sponsored actors that\nProofpoint tracks, we provide evidence that TA406 conducts financially motivated\ncampaigns, including the targeting of cryptocurrency and sextortion.\n\n_Figure 1.
