    "plain_text": "# NetTraveler Gets a Makeover for 10th Anniversary\n\n**[kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2014_nettraveler-gets-a-makeover-for-10th-anniversary](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2014_nettraveler-gets-a-makeover-for-10th-anniversary)**\n\nMay 26, 2021\n\n**Kaspersky Lab has observed a rise in attacks with an updated version of the “red**\n**star” APT backdoor.**\n\nIn 2014 the actors behind global cyberespionage campaign “Operation NetTraveler”\ncelebrate ten years of activity. Although the earliest samples appeared to have been\ncompiled in 2005, certain indicators point to 2004 as the year when the malicious activity\nstarted. For 10 years, NetTraveler has targeted more than 350 high-profile victims in 40\ncountries. This year Kaspersky Lab observed an uptick in the number of attacks against\nUyghur and Tibetan supporters using an updated version of the NetTraveler backdoor with a\nnew encryption scheme. During the investigation, Kaspersky Lab discovered seven C&C\nservers located in Hong Kong and one – in the USA.\n\n**Recent NetTraveler victims by industries**\n\nMost recently, the main focus of interest for cyber-espionage activities revolved around\ndiplomatic (32%), government (19%), private (11%), military (9%), industrial and\ninfrastructure (7%), airspace (6%), research (4%), activism (3%), financial (3%), IT (3%),\nhealth (2%) and press (1%).\n\n**Infection method: a “newer” backdoor**\n\n\n-----\n\nTraditionally for this malicious group, the attacks started with spear-phishing e-mails targeted\nactivists. The e-mail had two attachments, a non-malicious JPG file and a Microsoft Word\n.DOC file appeared to be a container with an exploit for the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability for\nMicrosoft Office. Kaspersky Lab determined that this malicious web archive file has been\ncreated on a system using Microsoft Office - Simplified Chinese.\n\nIf run on a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office, the exploit drops the main module – TrojanSpy. The malware configuration file has a slightly new format compared to “older”\nNetTraveler samples. Obviously, the developers behind NetTraveler have taken steps to try\nto hide the malware’s configuration.\n\nAfter the successful injection, NetTraveler exfiltrates common file types such as DOC, XLS,\nPPT, RTF and PDF.\n\n**The discovered C&C servers**\n\nKaspersky Lab identified several command-and-control (C&C) servers. Seven out of eight\nmalicious C&C servers were registered by Shanghai Meicheng Technology, and the IPs are\nlocated in Hong Kong (Trillion Company, Hongkong Dingfengxinhui Bgp Datacenter, Sun\nNetwork Limited and Hung Tai International Holdings), while the one was registered by\nTodaynic.com Inc with IP located in the USA (Integen Inc). Kaspersky Lab’s experts\n[recommend blocking all malicious hosts in the firewall.](http://securelist.com/blog/research/66272/nettraveler-apt-gets-a-makeover-for-10th-birthday/)\n\n_“While investigating the NetTraveler attacks, we calculated the amount of stolen data stored_\n_on NetTraveler’s C&C servers to be more than 22 gigabytes. This is an ongoing cyber-_\n_espionage campaign and, according to the last attacks against the activists, it will probably_\n_stay this way perhaps for another ten years. The most sophisticated threats appeared on_\n_surgical table of IT security companies not that long ago, but NetTraveler example shows_\n_that a disease could persist out of radar for long time”. - says Kurt Baumgartner, Principal_\n_Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab._\n\n**Recommendations on how to stay safe from updated NetTraveler malware**\n\nBlock [the mentioned hosts in your firewall](http://securelist.com/blog/research/66272/nettraveler-apt-gets-a-makeover-for-10th-birthday/)\nUpdate Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office to the latest versions.\nBe wary of clicking on links and opening attachments from unknown persons.\nUse a secure browser such as Google Chrome, which has a faster development and\npatching cycle than Microsoft's Internet Explorer.\n\n_Kaspersky Lab’s products detect and neutralize the malicious programs and its variants used_\n_by the NetTraveler Toolkit, including Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Agent.lifr, Trojan-_\nSpy.Win32.TravNet, Trojan-Spy.Win32.TravNet.qfr, Trojan.BAT.Tiny.b and\nDownloader.Win32.NetTraveler.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Kaspersky Lab s products detect the Microsoft Office exploits used in the spear-phishing_\n_attacks, including Exploit.MSWord.CVE-2010-333, Exploit.Win32.CVE-2012-0158,_\n**_Exploit.MSWord.CVE-2012-0158.db.._**\n\nTo learn more about the NetTraveler operation, please read the blog post available at\n[Securelist.com.](http://securelist.com/blog/research/66272/nettraveler-apt-gets-a-makeover-for-10th-birthday/)\n\n[Cyberthreat real-time map](http://cybermap.kaspersky.com/)\n\n**Additional reading**\n\nKaspersky\nKaspersky Lab has observed a rise in attacks with an updated version of the “red star” APT\nbackdoor\n\n\n-----",
