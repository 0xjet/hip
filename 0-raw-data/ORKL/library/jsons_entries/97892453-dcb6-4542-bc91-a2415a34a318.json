These sites were\ncompromised by a skimmer using the domain opendoorcdn.com for data exfiltration. With\nRiskIQ data, our researchers built on the previous reporting to identify more skimming\ndomains used by the attackers, as well as additional compromised sites. RiskIQ can also\nnow attribute all these cyberattacks to Magecart Group 12.\n\nThe obfuscation and skimming code we observed on opendoorcdn.com matches that used\nby Magecart Group 12, whose skimmer and obfuscation techniques we analyzed in our blog\n[posts, \"New Year, Same Magecart: The Continuation of Web-based Supply Chain Attacks\"](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-adverline/%22%20target=)\n[and \"Magento Attack: All Payment Platforms are Targets for Magecart Attacks.\" However,](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-beyond-magento/)\nthere are differences in the techniques employed by Group 12 in these more recent\ncompromises, which we'll break down here.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn those blog posts, we noted that Group 12 employed base64 encoded checks against the\nURL looking for the word \"checkout\" to identify the proper page on which to load their\nskimmer code. This encoding masked both the check itself and the skimmer URL. Quoting\nfrom our May 1st, 2019 report:\n\n\"Most of Group 12's injections occur with a pre-filter on the page—a small snippet of\nJavaScript that checks to see if they want to inject their skimmer on the page. Here's what it\nlooks like:\"\n\nMagecart Group 12's script tag from RiskIQ's May report\n\nHowever, in these more recent cyberattacks, the skimming JavaScript is loaded without\nobfuscation or URL checks. Instead, the script loads via a variable the attackers named\n'eventsListenerPool,' which is an alias for document.createElement('script'):\n\nThe Magecart skimmer\n\nThe variable loading the skimmer\n\n## Next Domain Up\n\n\n-----\n\n[On February 3rd, Pimental and Kersten published their followup blog detailing their efforts to](https://www.goggleheadedhacker.com/blog/post/15)\nidentify further opendoorcdn.com victims and have the skimming domain taken down by the\nChinese company through which it was registered. On February 2nd, RiskIQ observed that\nopendoorcdn.com was replaced on at least two of the victim sites named in the blog by a live\nskimmer domain, toplevelstatic.com:\n\nThe new skimmer domain\n\nNew skimmer domain\n\nRiskIQ has observed the toplevelstatic.com domain on three victim sites so far, all of which\nwere previously compromised by opendoorcdn.com, as seen through our host pairs data set\n[in RiskIQ Community:](https://community.riskiq.com/home)\n\n\n-----\n\nVictims of original skimmer domain\n\nVictims of new skimmer domain\n\nThe domain toplevelstatic.com was registered on February 1st, 2020, through Chinese\nregistrar Guangzhou Shidaihulian (now.cn) and uses the same DNS provider as\nopendoorcdn.com, DNSPod (also based in China). Both domains are hosted on NGINX\nservers and use Let's Encrypt certs. The IPs connected to toplevelstatic.com have changed\nat least once a day and sometimes more often, with each server, so far, based in Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\nResolutions for toplevelstatic.com\n\nHosting for opendoorcdn.com followed a more leisurely pace of flux. From January 2019\nthrough January 2020, it sometimes used the same IP for weeks at a time and utilized\nservers based all over the world.\n\n\n-----\n\nResolutions for opendoorcdn.com\n\n## Targets Beyond Sporting Event Ticket Re-selling\n\nRiskIQ's detection logic allowed us to identify additional domains hosting this particular\nmagecart skimmer. Two popular emergency preparedness sites, beprepared.com and\naugasonfarms.com, were affected by one of these additional skimmer domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the new victims with an Alexa ranking of 105,288\n\nBoth sites are owned by Blue Chip Group Manufacturing and appear to be similarly\nconstructed. We observed augasonfarms.com loading skimming code from\nstorefrontcdn.com on January 27th. The beprepared.com site seems to have been loading\nthe skimming code from January 16th through 29th. In these instances, the skimmer was\nadded through a simple script tag.\n\n\n-----\n\nHost pairs showing sites loading storefrontcdn.com\n\nMagecart script on beprepared.com\n\nMagecart script on beprepared.com\n\nIt appears the injections have been removed from sites, and they are currently free of\nskimming code. Additional IOCs can be viewed in our Magecart Group 12 project here:\n[https://community.riskiq.com/projects/b959cb28-d99c-b27b-bfd8-ae15d60a7e1b](https://community.riskiq.com/projects/b959cb28-d99c-b27b-bfd8-ae15d60a7e1b)\n\n## Safety in the Age of Magecart\n\nThe activity seen here demonstrates that magecart is a persistent and resilient threat. Given\nthe lucrative nature of card skimming, Magecart attacks will continue to evolve and surprise\nsecurity researchers with new capabilities They're learning from past cyberattacks to stay\n\n\n-----\n\none step ahead, so it s on us to do the same. Make sure you re staying up to date by reading\nall our findings on Magecart and stay tuned as we continue to shine a light on new\ndevelopments. Also, find out how RiskIQ protects customers by reading up on our JavaScript\nThreats Module here.\n\n***Update:**\n\nFollowing the publication of this article, we noticed further detections showing that\nbeprepared.com was also loading skimming code from wappallyzer.com, another Group 12\ndomain. Our data shows that this began on January 24th. We have communicated this to the\naffected company and are working with them to remediate.\n\n### Subscribe to Our Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to the RiskIQ newsletter to stay up-to-date on our latest content, headlines,\nresearch, events, and more.\n\nBase Editor\n\n\n-----",
