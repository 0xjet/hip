The cracking process may take a large\namount of time, up to tens of hours,\" [Avast said.](https://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/decrypted-targetcompany-ransomware/)\n\n\"The decryptor periodically saves the progress and if you interrupt it and restart the\ndecryptor later, it offers you an option to resume the previously started cracking process.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe TargetCompany ransomware decryptor works by cracking the password after\ncomparing an encrypted file with its original unencrypted version.\n\nAvast says this only has to be done once per each device encrypted by TargetCompany\nransomware since the decryptor wizard will allow you to enter previously cracked encryption\npasswords by selecting the \"I know the password for decrypting files.\"\n\n_TargetCompany decryptor (BleepingComputer)_\n**TargetCompany ransomware victims can download the decryption tool from Avast's**\n**[servers (64-bit or](https://files.avast.com/files/decryptor/avast_decryptor_targetcompany64.exe)** **[32-bit) to decrypt entire disk partitions using the instructions](https://files.avast.com/files/decryptor/avast_decryptor_targetcompany.exe)**\n**displayed within the tool's user interface.**\n\n\"On the final wizard page, you can opt-in whether you want to backup encrypted files.\nThese backups may help if anything goes wrong during the decryption process,\" Avast\nadded.\n\n\"This option is turned on by default, which we recommend. After clicking 'Decrypt,' the\ndecryption process begins. Let the decryptor work and wait until it finishes.\"\n\nYou can find additional instructions on how to use Avast's TargetCompany ransomware\n[decryptor here.](https://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/decrypted-targetcompany-ransomware/)\n\n[TargetCompany is a relatively newly discovered ransomware strain, active since mid-June](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/763499/targetcompany-ransomware-support-topic/)\n2021, that will add a .mallox, .exploit, .architek, or .brg extension to all encrypted files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_TargetCompany ransomware submissions (ID-Ransomware)_\nIt also drops a ransom note file named \"HOW TO RECOVER !!.TXT\" in all folders\ncontaining encrypted files.\n\nThis happens after it deletes volume shadow copies, reconfigures boot options, and kills\nprocesses that could lock databases of sensitive information (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, SQL\nServer).\n\n[Avast also released free decryptors for Babuk,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-ransomware-decryptor-released-to-recover-files-for-free/) [AtomSilo, and LockFile ransomware in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-atom-silo-and-lockfile-ransomware/)\nOctober 2021 to allow victims to recover their files without paying a ransom.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Free decryptor released for Yanluowang ransomware victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-yanluowang-ransomware-victims/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Avast](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/avast/)\n[Decryptor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/decryptor/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[TargetCompany](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/targetcompany/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
