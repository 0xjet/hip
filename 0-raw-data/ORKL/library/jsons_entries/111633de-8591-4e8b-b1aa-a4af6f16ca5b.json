    "plain_text": "# BlueBravo Uses Ambassador Lure to Deploy GraphicalNeutrino Malware\n\n\n-----\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nBlueBravo is a threat group tracked by Recorded Future’s Insikt Group that overlaps with the Russian\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) activity tracked as APT29 and NOBELIUM. APT29 and NOBELIUM\n[operations have been previously attributed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/) to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), an\norganization responsible for foreign espionage, active measures, and electronic surveillance. In October\n2022 we identified BlueBravo staging GraphicalNeutrino malware within a malicious ZIP file. The staging\nand deployment of this ZIP file overlaps with the previously employed dropper [EnvyScout,](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0634/) the use of\n[which is linked to APT29 and NOBELIUM.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloaked-ursa-online-storage-services-campaigns/)\n\nBlueBravo used a compromised website containing the text \"Ambassador`s schedule November 2022\"\nas part of a lure operation. Based on the theme of this lure, we suspect that the targets of this\ncampaign are related to embassy staff or an ambassador. This targeting profile aligns with previous\n[reporting](https://inquest.net/blog/2022/04/18/nobelium-israeli-embassy-maldoc) from InQuest in early 2022 that describes the group, reported as NOBELIUM, employing a lure\ndocument titled “Ambassador_Absense.docx” that displayed content relating to the Embassy of Israel.\nFollowing deployment and execution, InQuest reported that the malware, BEATDROP, employed\ntrello[.]com for command-and-control (C2) in an attempt to evade detection and create challenges in\nattributing the activity.\n\nSimilar to the use of Trello for data exchange by BEATDROP, we have found that GraphicalNeutrino uses\nthe United States (US)-based, business automation service Notion for its C2. The use of the Notion\nservice by BlueBravo is a continuation of their previous tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as\nthey have [employed](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/tracking-apt29-phishing-campaigns) multiple online services such as Trello, Firebase, and Dropbox in an attempt to\nevade detection. The abuse of legitimate services, such as those employed by BlueBravo, presents a\ncomplex issue for network defenders due to the difficulty of defending against malicious access to\nlegitimate services. The use of this technique is becoming more common and will continue to pose a\nproblem for network defenders.\n\nGraphicalNeutrino acts as a loader with basic C2 functionality and implements numerous anti-analysis\ntechniques including API unhooking, dynamically resolving APIs, string encryption, and sandbox\nevasion. It leverages Notion’s API for C2 communications and uses Notion’s database feature to store\nvictim information and stage payloads for download.\nWhile we are unable to assess the intended targets of this operation based on the data available, it is\nlikely that ambassadorial or embassy-themed lures are particularly effective during periods of\nheightened geopolitical tensions, such as is the case with the ongoing war in Ukraine. During such\nperiods, Russian APT groups are highly likely to make extensive use of diplomatically themed lures, as\nthe information potentially gathered from the compromise of entities or individuals receiving such\ncommunications is likely to have a direct impact on Russia’s foreign policy and broader Russian strategic\ndecision-making processes.\n\nBased on historical APT29 and SVR [cyber operations and active measures, we assess it is likely that](https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18122307/F-Secure_Dukes_Whitepaper.pdf)\nadditional countries at the nexus of the conflict are at risk of targeting. This targeting almost certainly\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group | CTA-RU-2023-0126\n\n\n-----\n\nrepresents an ongoing interest from threat actors affiliated with the SVR and aligns with their continued\nintent to gain access to strategic information from entities and organizations engaged in foreign policy.\nAny country with a nexus to the Ukraine crisis, particularly those with key geopolitical, economic, or\nmilitary relationships with Russia or Ukraine, are at increased risk of targeting.\n\n## Key Judgments\n\n  - We have identified new malware used by BlueBravo, which overlaps with Russian APT activity\ntracked as APT29 and NOBELIUM, which Western governments and researchers have linked to\nthe Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\n\n  - Identified staging infrastructure continues the trend of using compromised websites to deliver\nBlueBravo malware within archive files. The delivery of these files uses the same HTML\nsmuggling technique as EnvyScout.\n\n  - The malware also takes advantage of DLL search order hijacking for execution, helping to evade\ndetection on the host.\n\n  - A change to Notion as the initial C2 from Trello, Firebase, and Dropbox demonstrates BlueBravo’s\nbroadening but continued use of legitimate Western services to blend their malware traffic to\nevade detection.\n\n  - Though no second-stage malware, follow-on C2 server, or victims were identified, the initial lure\npage suggests BlueBravo’s targeting was related to unknown embassy staff or an ambassador.\n\n  - Embassy-related information is likely considered high value intelligence, especially in the midst\nof the Russian war in Ukraine.\n\n## Background\n\nBlueBravo’s targeting, its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and its targeting interests and\noperations overlap with Russian advanced persistent threat activity publicly reported as APT29 and\nNOBELIUM, which has been [previously attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/)\nSVR is responsible for foreign espionage, active measures, and electronic surveillance. APT29 has been\n[active since at least](https://blog.f-secure.com/podcast-dukes-apt29/) 2008 according to third-party reporting, engaging in espionage operations against\nentities associated with security and defense, politics, and research. APT29 was initially observed\n[surveilling Chechen and dissident organizations but expanded to target entities in the West such as the](https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18122307/F-Secure_Dukes_Whitepaper.pdf)\n[Pentagon](https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/250730-pentagon-restores-hacked-email-system) [in 2015, the Democratic National Committee](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/) (DNC) and US think tanks in 2016, and the\n[Norwegian government and several Dutch ministries in 2017.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/03/norway-accuses-group-linked-to-russia-of-carrying-out-cyber-attack)\n\nIn 2021, public reporting detailed BlueBravo’s use of various [iterations of a phishing campaign](https://twitter.com/cglyer/status/1398082383392477190) emulating\n[government entities. The various campaigns delivered ISO files via methods such as using URLs to](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/05/27/suspected-apt29-operation-launches-election-fraud-themed-phishing-campaigns/)\n[download the ISO file and execute an LNK file, and using an HTML attachment](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/) in the email to initiate\nthe download of an ISO file. This activity was used to deploy NativeZone, an umbrella term for their\ncustom Cobalt Strike loaders. NativeZone typically uses rundll32.exe to load and execute follow-on\npayload(s).\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group | CTA-RU-2023-0126\n\n\n-----\n\nBlueBravo employs a wide range of custom malware and open-source tooling. A notable facet is their\n[evolving malware families and development practices, with implants developed in various languages](https://www.epicturla.com/previous-works/vb2018)\nincluding [Python,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-technical-analysis-seaduke/) [Go,](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/cleaning-up-after-wellmess.html) [PowerShell, and](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/03/dissecting_one_ofap.html) [Assembly.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/05/20/miniduke-still-duking/)\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n\n**[Figure 1 : Screenshot of hxxps[:]//totalmassasje[.]no/schedule[.]php (Source: URLScan)](https://urlscan.io/screenshots/fda30651-2e57-48c0-9587-f7e66e84e80e.png)**\n\nContained within the HTML of the webpage is an obfuscated ZIP file that is deployed via HTML\nsmuggling as shown in Figure 2; the ZIP file is set to auto-download when the website is visited.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group | CTA-RU-2023-0126\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group | CTA-RU-2023-0126\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malware\n\n\nThe malicious ZIP file “schedule.zip” (SHA256\ncf160175c661efd4b1e1eecadf5f00f7203ef4c7445e36e3373d50b26086c552) was auto-downloaded\nfrom totalmassasje[.]no and contains three files, as shown in Table 1.\n\n**Filename** **File Type** **SHA256**\n\nnovember_schedulexe.pdf EXE 844e902977b478eace8568f49dd9e5c91db8e534f3c5410ee663d0be02bdf7e3\n\nvcruntime140.dll DLL a0c3e6cd167b93f4646a7a3f2d46ed8bd4888d861b533662a66ca9711d49db1f\n\n7za.dll DLL 381a3c6c7e119f58dfde6f03a9890353a20badfa1bfa7c38ede62c6b0692103c\n\n**Table 1 : Files contained within schedule.zip (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nFiles 7za.dll and vcruntime140.dll are hidden and won't be shown to the user by default, as seen in\n**Figure 3.**\n\n**Figure 3: Contents of schedule.zip (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n**november_schedulexe.pdf**\n\nThe masquerading executable file november_schedulexe.pdf is a renamed copy of 7-Zip version 18.06\n(Figure 4) and is benign in nature.

A side-by-side comparison of each DLL’s Properties window is shown in Figure 6 with\nthe legitimate version on the left and the modified version on the right. Notably, the modified version\nhas also removed Microsoft’s digital signature.\n\n\n**Figure 6: Comparison of the legitimate (left) and modified (right) versions of vcruntime140.dll (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n\nFurther comparison of the DLL files revealed that an additional library import for 7za.dll had been added\nto the modified version. When the file november_schedulexe.pdf is executed, it takes advantage of DLL\nsearch order hijacking to load vcruntime140.dll as a dependency, which in turn requires\nvcruntime140.dll to load 7za.dll as a dependency as well. A modified version of vcruntime140.dll to\nimport another DLL within the same folder has previously been seen and [reported](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloaked-ursa-online-storage-services-campaigns/) by Unit42, and was\nobserved alongside EnvyScout. The same file version (14.30.30704.0) was also used in the\nvcruntime140.dll file described by Unit42.\n\n\n**7za.dll**\n\n\nThe file 7za.dll is BlueBravo's intended malicious file — “GraphicalNeutrino”. This DLL leverages Notion’s\nAPI to perform C2 communications via a Notion database and to deliver additional payloads to the\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group | CTA-RU-2023-0126\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Maps a clean copy of the module into memory from the file system\n2. Locates the .text section in both the original and clean copies of the module\n3. Modifies the module’s original .text section permission to be PAGE_READWRITE_EXECUTE and\n\nstores the original permissions\n4. Copies the clean module’s .text section over the original module’s .text section, effectively\n\nremoving any API hooks\n5. Reapplies the original permissions to the original module’s .text section\n\nNext, GraphicalNeutrino checks to see if it should establish persistence. It dynamically loads the\nlegitimate Windows modules psapi.dll and advapi.dll to resolve addresses for\nGetProcessImageFileNameA, RegOpenKeyExA, RegQueryValueExA, RegSetValueExA, and RegCloseKey.\nIt then checks to see if its process filename matches “7za.exe”; if it does, then it copies 7za.exe,\n```\n7za.dll, and vcruntime140.dll to %APPDATA_LOCAL%\\7za and creates the registry key\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\7za with a value of\n%APPDATA_LOCAL%\\7za\\7za.exe. This enables GraphicalNeutrino to be executed again when the\n\n```\nvictim machine is rebooted; however, in this particular sample, persistence is not established because\nthe process filename is november_schedulexe.pdf instead of 7za.exe.\n\nThroughout GraphicalNeutrino’s runtime, strings are decrypted when needed using the decryption\nalgorithm shown in Figure 7. Each of the strings are decrypted using the key 0x2468a525676afca7.\n\n**Figure 7: String decryption algorithm (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group | CTA-RU-2023-0126\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter removing API hooks and setting up persistence, GraphicalNeutrino prepares to communicate with\nits C2 server. As part of this process, several strings are decrypted including a hardcoded user agent, a\nNotion API key, and a database identifier.\n\n**Item** **Value**\n\nUser Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/105.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/105.0.1343.53\n\nNotion API Key secret_XJGtqXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nDatabase ID d0c414a4641b42978bdf4af27e441f61\n\n**Table 2: Decrypted strings used to communicate with the Notion API (full Notion API key redacted with “X”) (Source: Recorded**\nFuture)\n\nA unique identifier is also calculated for the victim based on their username and computer name, as\nshown in Figure 8. This function identifies the victim’s username and computer name, concatenates the\n2 values together with an underscore, and then computes a “hash” value by adding together the ordinal\nvalue of each character in the string.\n\n**Figure 8: Function for calculating a unique identifier based on the victim’s user and computer name (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n|Item|Value|\n|---|---|\n|User Agent|Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/105.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/105.0.1343.53|\n|Notion API Key|secret_XJGtqXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|\n|Database ID|d0c414a4641b42978bdf4af27e441f61|\n\n\nThe computed hash value is then prepended with “ItIEQ” and used in a Notion API [database query filter](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-database-query-filter)\nto determine if the victim has previously checked in to the C2 server.
