It has been active for more than 5**\nyears already. [Check Point reported in December 2020 that Formbook affected 4% of](https://www.checkpoint.com/press/2021/december-2020s-most-wanted-malware-emotet-returns-as-top-malware-threat/)\norganizations worldwide and made it to the top 3 list of the most prevalent malware.\n\nAccording to [AnyRun Malware Trends Tracker, Formbook occupies the 4 place in a list ofth](https://any.run/malware-trends/)\nthe most prevalent malware families in 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – Formbook is in 4th place among the most prevalent malware families of the past 12 months (June 2020 – June2021) – AnyRun._\n\nFormbook is an Info Stealer that harvests credentials from various web browsers, collects\nscreenshots, monitors and logs keystrokes, and can download and execute files according to\nthe orders received from Command-and-Control (C&C) servers. The code is written in C with\nassembly inserts and contains a number of tricks to make it harder for researchers to\nanalyze it.\n\nAs stated by its author, Formbook was intended to be “a simple keylogger.” However,\ncustomers immediately saw its potential as a universal tool for use in broad spam campaigns\nthat target organizations all over the world. As this potential became a reality, the author\nstopped sales of the product without giving detailed explanations about the motives behind\nthis decision.\n\nA short time later, Formbook was reborn as XLoader, and the malware is now available for\nsale in the underground forum by a different avatar. XLoader opened up several new\nopportunities, with the ability to operate in the macOS being one of the most exciting.\nXLoader’s story is on-going, and judging by the popularity of the malware, shows no signs of\nending any time soon.\n\nLet’s take a look at how it all began.\n\n## Formbook: unintended popularity\n\nA post offering the earliest version of Formbook (what we could call a beta-version) for sale\nappeared on the underground forum on February 13, 2016.\n\n\n_Figure 1 – Formbook is in 4th place among the most prevalent malware families of the past 12 months (June 2020 – June2021) – AnyRun._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – ng-Coder offering Formbook malware for sale._\n\nAlthough the first sales thread appeared on February 13, 2016, Formbook samples were\nseen earlier as evidenced by AnyRun:\n\n_Figure 3 – First Formbook sample was seen on January 1, 2016, according to AnyRun._\n\nThe Formbook’s seller was hidden under “ng-Coder” avatar.\n\n_Note: we assume ng-Coder is a male, though we have no direct evidence, and will refer to_\n_the avatar as “he” throughout this article._\n\n\n_Figure 2 – ng-Coder offering Formbook malware for sale._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Profile**\n```\n e-mail: [email protected]\n Skype: Ng.Coder\n skills:\n * strong c\\c++ knowledge\n * strong assembly x86\\x64 knowledge\n\n```\nng-Coder joined the underground hack forum on October 27, 2015. According to his own\nstatement on the forum, he was selling exploits at that time. We cannot point to ng-Coder’s\nexact country of origin, but judging by his phrasing, English is likely not his native language.\n\nA day before creating the sales thread we saw above, ng-Coder requested a review of his\nproduct from an experienced member of the community.\n\n_Figure 4 – Formbook review requested by ng-Coder._\n\nOn May 9, 2016, three months later after publishing the first sales thread, Formbook v.0.3\nwas offered for sale.\n\n_Figure 5 – Formbook v.0.3 icon._\n\nFormbook was advertised as a product supporting multiple features:\n\n\n_Figure 4 – Formbook review requested by ng-Coder._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – Formbook v.0.3 features._\n\nWhat attracted our attention here is a strange description including the phrase “Balloon\nExecutable” and the acronyms MPIE and MEE. These terms, which do not exist in the cyber\ncommunity, were used by ng-Coder to describe how Formbook operates, i.e., uses positionindependent code (shellcode) to inject the malware into a legitimate system process and\ninitiate the shellcode execution.\n\nOther features listed include network traffic sniffing, keylogging, clipboard monitoring, and\npassword extraction for almost one hundred applications including browsers, messengers,\nFTP and email clients.\n\nThe sales pitch was a combined model, in which a customer could choose where to host the\npanel: on the host provided by the seller (thus using a “Malware-as-a-Service” scheme) or\nthe customer’s own machine (direct acquiring). If the latter was selected, the author also\nprovided the panel source code along with a pre-built binary.\n\nDifferent types of Formbook subscriptions had different prices:\n\n_Figure 7 – The Formbook pricing as offered by ng-Coder._\n\n\n_Figure 7 – The Formbook pricing as offered by ng-Coder._\n\n\n-----\n\nng-Coder offered a number different source code protectors to support Formbook. For\nexample, Net-Protector is a cross-platform crypting service with the price of $100 for a\nWindows executable and $200 for a macOS one:\n\n_Figure 8 – Net-Protector logo._\n\nng-Coder was so confident in his creation that he offered to re-crypt an executable for free if\nit was detected by any AV in the first 30 days after the encryption:\n\n_If the crypted PE file gets flagged by AV in less than 30 days after the first crypt, we will_\n_recrypt the same crypted SHA1 for free._\n\nOther examples of protectors included shared source codes of crypting solutions on .NET\nand Delphi.\n\nOn October 6, 2017, Formbook sales abruptly stopped. The reason given was its use in\nspam campaigns:\n\n_Figure 9 – ng-Coder indicates that Formbook sales have ceased._\n\nAs we stated at the beginning of this article, the Formbook author didn’t want his creation to\nbe used in email campaigns and banned all customers who did so.\n\nOn May 27, 2018, ng-Coder made his last public post on the forum where he provided a\ntechnical answer to one of the questions not related to Formbook. No further activity from\nhim has been observed since.\n\nAs we will see, although Formbook sales were stopped, its activity was continuing. Not only\ncould users who bought the malware to be hosted on their own servers continue to use it, but\nng-Coder could make use of Formbook as well.\n\n## Used for the author’s own purposes?\n\n\n_Figure 9 – ng-Coder indicates that Formbook sales have ceased._\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found evidence that ng-Coder might have his own plans for his creation. We analyzed\n[the domains linked to the ng-Coder email address “[email protected][.com” and discovered](https://research.checkpoint.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nthat these were used in Formbook configurations for particular campaigns labeled “private”,\n“list” and “zog”. We found 16 unique C&C URLs inside the Formbook malware that pointed to\n13 different sub-campaigns.\n```\n http[://www.unlimitedgiveaways.net/zog/hx/\n http[://www.unlimitedgiveaways.net/zog/hx69/\n http[://www.unlimitedgiveaways.net/zog/ab/\n http[://www.socialbumps.net/zog/ct2/\n http[://www.alienzouks.com/private/\n http[://www.adomax1.com/private/\n http[://www.ryandeby.com/private/\n http[://www.gfather.net/private/\n http[://www.surfpay.website/list/ch/\n http[://www.bingo-clicker.site/list/jo/\n http[://www.click-bingo.site/list/le/\n http[://www.click-bingo.site/list/kv/\n http[://www.click-bingo.site/list/mo/\n http[://www.jesse-list.info/list/kw/\n http[://www.wowtracking.info/list/hx47/\n http[://www.wowtracking.info/list/oz/\n\n```\nAll the listed domains share common features. They all were registered by the GoDaddy\nregistrar:\n\n_Figure 10 – GoDaddy registrar appears in domains’ details._\n\nAnd they all shared the same details about the person who registered them:\n\n\n_Figure 10 – GoDaddy registrar appears in domains’ details._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 – Details for registering domains as provided by ng-Coder._\n\nAccording to the [LocateFamily site, “Amanda George” was living at the address provided at](https://www.locatefamily.com/Street-Lists/Ireland/index-1522.html)\nthe time of registering the domains. However, we cannot link this person with ng-Coder\navatar.\n\nThe Formbook activity didn’t just stop there. For example, in May 2020 we discovered a\n[Formbook sample dropped by GuLoader. It was submitted to VirusTotal in June 2020:](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/guloader-cloudeye/)\n\n_Figure 12 – A Formbook sample dropped in May 2020 by GuLoader._\n\nThe campaign name in this sample was “private” and the main domain was registered by ngCoder (ryandeby[.com).\n\n## XLoader: the time-proved tricks re-applied in a new environment\n\nOn February 6, 2020 a new era began: the era of the Formbook successor called XLoader.\nOn this day, XLoader was advertised for sale in one of the underground groups.\n\n\n_Figure 11 – Details for registering domains as provided by ng-Coder._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13 – XLoader as advertised in the underground group._\n\nFormbook and XLoader share the same code base, and there are other connections\nbetween them as well, as we will see later.\n\n_Figure 14 – The seller confirms that Formbook’s code has contributed a lot to the development of XLoader._\n\nOn October 20, 2020, XLoader was offered for sale on the same forum which was used for\nselling Formbook.\n\n\n_Figure 13 – XLoader as advertised in the underground group._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15 – XLoader as advertised on the forum._\n\n_Note: XLoader malware for PC and Mac should not be confused with XLoader malware for_\n_Android, first discovered in 2019._\n\nOne of the most exciting things about the new malware was its ability to operate in the\nmacOS. With approximately 200 million users operating macOS in 2018 (as reported by\n[Apple), this is definitely a promising new market for the malware to enter.](https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/30/apple-passes-100m-active-mac-milestone-thanks-to-high-numbers-of-new-users)\n\n_Figure 16 – Mac sales by year, taken from_ _[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-statistics/)_\n\n\n_Figure 15 – XLoader as advertised on the forum._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Note: Apple stopped reporting Mac sales in Q4 2018. All subsequent values are estimates._\n\nThe malware now features a more lucrative economic model for the authors as compared to\nFormbook. Customers may only buy the malware for a limited time and are only able to use\na server provided by the seller; no panel sources codes are sold anymore. Thus, a “Malwareas-a-Service” scheme is used. Centralized C&C infrastructure allows the authors to control\nhow the malware is used by the customers.\n\n_Figure 17 – xloader announces the decision to stop selling panels and underlines the importance of controlling thecustomers’ actions._\n\nThe pricing for different options is listed in the table below:\n\n**Package** **Price**\n\nWindows, executable, 1 month $59\n\nWindows, executable, 3 months $129\n\nmacOS, Mach-O, 1 month $49\n\nmacOS, Mach-O, 3 months $99\n\nXLoader’s seller also released a free Java binder which is intended to create a standalone\nJAR file uniting Mach-O and exe binaries:\n\n\n_Figure 17 – xloader announces the decision to stop selling panels and underlines the importance of controlling thecustomers’ actions._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18 – Interface of the XBinder tool._\n\n## A new developer?\n\nDid the new seller also take on duties as the developer and maintainer of this version of the\noriginal Formbook malware? We believe this is not the case. A new seller is just a seller, not\na developer. There must be someone else behind the curtain to handle the technical part.\n\n_Figure 19 – XLoader’s seller states that he is an official seller, not a developer of the malware._\n\nWe already saw that ng-Coder wasn’t completely out of the picture, even though he no\nlonger operated publicly. Could he be the one continuing to develop the new malware? Apart\nfrom technical similarities, we found evidence of a connection between XLoader’s seller and\nng-Coder, namely a message from xloader to ng-Coder saying, “Thank you for the help”:\n\n\n_Figure 18 – Interface of the XBinder tool._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20 – xloader saying “thank you” to ng-Coder._\n\nWe cannot say for sure if the thanks were for a one-time helping hand or if it was for\ncontinuous support.\n\nAnother piece of evidence that points at ng-Coder’s continued participation is the statement\nby XLoader’s seller (posted on December 14, 2020) where he shared his hope that ng-Coder\ncould create a newer cross-platform crypting service:\n\n_Figure 21 – xloader sharing the hope about a new crypting service from ng-Coder._\n\n## Recap\n\nWe recap the malware activity timeline and its milestones in the diagram below.\n\n\n_Figure 20 – xloader saying “thank you” to ng-Coder._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 22 – The activity timeline of both malware versions._\n\n## Re-sellers\n\nDuring the lifecycle of Formbook/XLoader malware, a number of impersonators and resellers claimed they were the official contacts.\n\nIt began 5 years ago when ng-Coder raised a warning not to send a payment to him or\nanyone impersonating him for the exploit, as he stopped selling exploits in 2016. Note that\nthere were impersonators even before Formbook was first available for sale.\n\nIn 2021, the situation hasn’t changed much. For example, there is a site freely accessible\nfrom the Internet which offers XLoader for sale, but for a higher price than the malware is\nsold for in the Darknet:\n\n_Figure 23 – A site in the Internet offering XLoader for sale._\n\nThe biggest difference is in the 3 months package for macOS, which is $40 higher than the\nDarknet price.\n\n\n_Figure 22 – The activity timeline of both malware versions._\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother site offers XLoader for $120:\n\n_Figure 24 – Another Internet site offering XLoader for sale._\n\n## Prevalence: countries and campaigns\n\nDuring the 6 months between December 1, 2020 and June 1, 2021, we saw\nFormbook/XLoader requests from as many as 69 countries, which is more than a third of the\ntotal 195 countries recognized in the world today.\n\nThe breakdown of victims by country is presented in the diagram below:\n\n\n_Figure 24 – Another Internet site offering XLoader for sale._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 25 – Formbook requests by countries between December 1, 2020 and June 1, 2021._\n\nVictims from the United States constitute more than the half of the victims worldwide.\n\nAs we stated previously, according to AnyRun, Formbook is in 4 place among the mostth\nprevalent malware families of the last year and in 6 place for all time. This fact implies thatth\nthere should be quite a lot of Formbook\\XLoader campaigns in-the-wild. Indeed, we\nobserved more than 1400 different campaigns of the malware during several years of\nmonitoring its activity.\n\n\n_Figure 25 – Formbook requests by countries between December 1, 2020 and June 1, 2021._\n\n\nIn the upcoming articles we share the technical details of the malware’s macOS version\nwhich reveal how XLoader operates under the hood and help us to understand how the\nFormbook\\XLoader family secured its place in malware top prevalence lists.\n\nWe also describe a distinctive feature of the XLoader malware which helps it to fool\nsandboxes and researchers and keep its real C&C servers hidden. Out of almost 90,000\ndomains used in network communication by the malware, only 1,300 are the real C&C\nservers – which constitutes just 1.5% of the total. The other 88,000 domains belong to\nlegitimate sites; however, the malware sends malicious traffic to them as well. This presents\nsecurity vendors with the dilemma of how to determine which are the real C&C servers and\nnot false-positively identify legitimate sites as malicious.\n\nWe also share our methods to correctly analyze the XLoader’s communication with the\nservers and to identify the real C&C – only one out of all the 64 domains present in any\nchosen sample.\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n-----\n\n## Check Point Protections\n\n[Check Point Provides Zero-Day Protection Across Its Network, Cloud, Users and Access](https://www.checkpoint.com/infinity-vision/zero-day-protection/)\n[Security Solutions, SandBlast provides the best zero-day protection while reducing security](https://www.checkpoint.com/quantum/advanced-network-threat-prevention/)\noverhead\n\nSandBlast Network Protections:\n```\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.A\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.B\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.C\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.D\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.E\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.F\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.G\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.H\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.I\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.J\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.K\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.L\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.M\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.N\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.O\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.P\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.Q\n     Trojan.WIN32.Formbook.R\n\n```\nThreat Emulation protections:\n```\n     Infostealer.Win32.Formbook.C\n     Infostealer.Win32.Formbook.D\n     Infostealer.Win32.Formbook.E\n     Infostealer.Win32.Formbook.gl.F\n     Infostealer.Win32.Formbook.TC\n     Formbook.TC\n     Infostealer.Win32.XLoader.TC\n     XLoader.TC\n     Trojan.Mac.XLoader.B\n\n## Sources\n\n```\n1.
