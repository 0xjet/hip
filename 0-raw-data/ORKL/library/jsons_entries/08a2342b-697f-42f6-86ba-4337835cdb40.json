    "plain_text": "# Axis of REvil: What we know about the hacker collective taunting Apple\n\n**[cnbc.com/2021/04/23/axis-of-revil-inside-the-hacker-collective-taunting-apple.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/axis-of-revil-inside-the-hacker-collective-taunting-apple.html)**\n\nEamon Javers April 23, 2021\n\nKey Points\n\nA hacker group called REvil posted on the dark web it hacked an Apple supplier called\nQuanta Computer.\nIn the note, it demanded that Apple pay $50 million in ransom or else it would release\nsensitive internal documents.\nExperts say it may presage a new era of emboldened ransomware attackers who are\nprotected by Russian leader Vladimir Putin and empowered to take on the biggest\ncompanies in the world.\n\nVIDEO4:4204:42\n\nREvil: What we know about the hacker group that's holding Apple's data hostage\n\n[Squawk Box](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/)\nThe ransom note was both taunting and ominous: \"Today we, the REvil Group, will provide\ndata on the upcoming releases of the company beloved by many,\" the criminal hackers\nwrote.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In the note posted on the dark web the group told the world it hacked an Apple supplier](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL)\ncalled Quanta Computer and wanted $50 million in ransom or else it would release sensitive\ninternal documents. \"Tim Cook can say thank you Quanta,\" wrote REvil.\n\nThe extortion attempt, which came early this week, represented a significant escalation for a\nwell-known hacker collective. And experts tell CNBC it may presage a new era of\nemboldened ransomware attackers who are protected by Russian leader Vladimir Putin and\nempowered to take on the biggest companies in the world.\n\nCybersecurity experts in the U.S. say the group has a long rap sheet of criminal activity\nagainst Western companies. Their analysis suggests REvil — pronounced like the letter \"R\"\nfollowed by the word \"evil\" — is largely made up of native Russian speakers and is likely\nlocated in a former Soviet state. Whoever they are, they have a taste for dark humor: REvil\nposts its stolen documents on a site on the dark web that it calls \"Happy Blog.\"\n\n\"We know that they are protected most likely by Russian intelligence or the Russian\ngovernment, as are most ransomware groups, which has allowed them to flourish over the\nlast 18 months,\" said Marc Bleicher of Arete Incident Response, a cybersecurity firm that\nspecializes in negotiations with criminal hackers. Bleicher says his firm has dealt with REvil\n32 times in just the past 90 days.\n\n\"I think, you know, based on what we've seen so far, this may be just the tip of the iceberg\nover the last few months, and what you're going to start to see is organizations that are of the\nsame size and stature as Apple,\" Bleicher said.\n\nThat means more CEOs need to brace for ransomware impact and for REvil's shockingly\ndirect intimidation tactics. Bleicher said one signature of the group is stealing a CEO's\npersonal cellphone number from company computers and then repeatedly calling that CEO\nto taunt him or her personally about the loss of data and to demand huge payouts.\n\nBleicher's firm has analyzed 173 previous REvil attacks and says it can see some patterns in\nhow the gang operates. One thing becomes clear: Attacking Apple by name — and\ndemanding $50 million — is on a much different scale from what REvil has operated on in\nthe past. Thirty-one percent of the companies attacked by the group have been in\nprofessional services, not technology, Arete found. Nineteen percent have been in health\ncare, and 16% in manufacturing.\n\nThe average ransom demand has also been much lower in the past, Arete found, at just\nunder $728,000. After negotiations over the price, the average ransom actually paid is even\nlower than that: Just over $129,000.\n\nIt's a remarkably business-like operation, complete with customer service desks, software\nsupport teams and even a Craigslist-style marketplace to recruit new hackers to the\nenterprise.\n\n\n-----\n\nBleicher provided CNBC with one jobs posting for REvil that he found on the dark web.\nWritten in Russian, it says:\"We have 1 position for a person that gains accesses to networks,\nthat already have active accesses. Monday we'll announce one of our largest attacks. We\nwork 24x7. We are stable. We make money — a lot of money. We are waiting for you in our\ndirect message.\"\n\nCharles Carmakal, a senior vice president at the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said his rough\nestimate is the gang has collected a total of $100 million so far. That means a $50 million\nransom would be an enormous step up for the group.\n\nBut everything in this criminal underworld is negotiable.\n\n\"I have seen other organizations being asked for $50 million,\" Carmakal said. \"Nobody really\nrealistically pays that much money. They'll try to negotiate it down to a number that is a little\nbit more reasonable and doable if they do decide to pay.\"\n\nCarmakal said the huge ransom demand and high-profile target in this case may be more\nabout getting attention — and scaring future victims — than it is about this one case. One\npossibility is the high-profile taunting and ransom note were only made public after a private\nnegotiation that didn't end well from the hacker's point of view. So now they're leveraging that\nfor publicity and intimidation.\n\n\"These groups tend to amplify their messages and try to coerce victims, usually after they\ndon't feel like the victim is willing to pay,\" Carmakal said.\n\nBut why are companies sending these huge payments to criminal gangs at all? Carmakal\nsaid firms look at the scale of the potential damage and often conclude they have no choice.\n\n\"A lot of organizations feel compelled to pay because they don't want that data to get out\nthere,\" he said. \"They feel that they've got an obligation to their shareholders or partners or\nto the customer to prevent that data from making its way out onto the open market.\"\n\nThe latest REvil attack is still in play. The gang demanded payment from Apple by May 1 and\nsaid it would release more data every day. So far, though, no further Apple data has been\ndumped on the dark web.\n\nThat could be one indication, experts say, that ransom payment negotiations are already\nunderway.\n\n\n-----",
