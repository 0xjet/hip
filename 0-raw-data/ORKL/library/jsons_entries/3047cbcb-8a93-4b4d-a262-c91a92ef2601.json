The intrusion point\nand delivery method of the malware are still unclear.\n\n## Some systems are still infected, despite clean-up efforts\n\nInsikt Group researchers notified Indonesian authorities about the intrusions in June this year\nand then again in July. Officials did not provide feedback for the reports.\n\n\n-----\n\nBIN, which was the most sensitive target compromised in the campaign, did not return\nrequests for comment sent by The Record in July and August.\n\nA source familiar with the investigation told The Record last month that authorities had taken\nsteps to identify and clean the infected systems.\n\nDays after, Insikt researchers confirmed that hosts inside Indonesian government networks\nwere still communicating with the Mustang Panda malware servers.\n\n## Part of China sprawling cyber-espionage campaigns\n\nNews of this intrusive cyber-espionage effort comes as the two countries have been reestablishing close diplomatic relations after almost reaching armed conflict a few years\nbefore, [primarily due to marine territorial disputes.](https://cejiss.org/indonesia-military-power-under-the-increasing-threat-of-conflict-in-the-south-china-sea)\n\nCurrently the second-largest investor in Indonesia, China has been cozying up to Indonesian\nprovinces over the past two years to facilitate increased trade and further its implementation\nof the [Belt and Road Initiative, a foreign policy initiative to invest in neighboring countries in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative)\norder to establish lasting political ties and trade agreements.\n\nBut these investments haven’t always been welcome, with some countries seeing them as a\nTrojan horse for their economies.\n\nSince 2013, when China made its Belt and Road Initiative public, cyber-espionage groups\nhave often targeted countries where China planned to invest as part of this project.\n\nTags\n\n[APT](https://therecord.media/tag/apt/)\n[Badan Intelijen Negara](https://therecord.media/tag/badan-intelijen-negara/)\n[BIN](https://therecord.media/tag/bin/)\n[China](https://therecord.media/tag/china/)\n[Indonesia](https://therecord.media/tag/indonesia/)\n[Mustang Panda](https://therecord.media/tag/mustang-panda/)\n[nation-state](https://therecord.media/tag/nation-state-2/)\n[PlugX](https://therecord.media/tag/plugx/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
