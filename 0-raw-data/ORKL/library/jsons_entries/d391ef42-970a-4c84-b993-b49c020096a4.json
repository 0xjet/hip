Executive Summary\n\n**Ahmed Mansoor is an internationally recognized human rights defender, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and recipient of**\n\n**[the Martin Ennals Award (sometimes referred to as a “Nobel Prize for human rights”). On August 10 and 11, 2016, Mansoor](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/ahmed-mansoor-selected-as-the-2015-laureate-martin-ennals-award-for-human-rights-defenders/)**\n\n**received SMS text messages on his iPhone promising “new secrets” about detainees tortured in UAE jails if he clicked on an**\n\n**included link. Instead of clicking, Mansoor sent the messages to Citizen Lab researchers. We recognized the links as belonging to**\n\n**an exploit infrastructure connected to NSO Group, an Israel-based “cyber war” company that sells Pegasus, a government-**\n\n**exclusive “lawful intercept” spyware product. NSO Group is reportedly owned by an American venture capital firm, Francisco�**\n\n**Partners Management.**\n\n**The ensuing investigation, a collaboration between researchers from Citizen Lab and from Lookout Security, determined that the**\n\n**[links led to a chain of zero-day exploits (“zero-days”) that would have remotely jailbroken Mansoor’s stock iPhone 6 and installed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing))**\n\n**sophisticated spyware. We are calling this exploit chain Trident. Once infected, Mansoor’s phone would have become a digital spy**\n\n**in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording**\n\n**his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements.**\n\n**We are not aware of any previous instance of an iPhone remote jailbreak used in the wild as part of a targeted attack campaign,**\n\n**making this a rare find.�**\n\n**The Trident Exploit Chain:**\n\n**[CVE-2016-4657: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2016-4657)**\n**[CVE-2016-4655: An application may be able to disclose kernel memory](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2016-4655)**\n**[CVE-2016-4656: An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2016-4656)**\n\n**Once we confirmed the presence of what appeared to be iOS zero-days, Citizen Lab and Lookout quickly initiated a responsible�**\n\n**disclosure process by notifying Apple and sharing our findings. Apple responded promptly, and notified us that they would be�**\n\n**addressing the vulnerabilities. We are releasing this report to coincide with the availability of the iOS 9.3.5 patch, which blocks the**\n\n**Trident exploit chain by closing the vulnerabilities that NSO Group appears to have exploited and sold to remotely compromise**\n\n**iPhones.**\n\n**Recent Citizen Lab research has shown that many state-sponsored spyware campaigns against civil society groups and human**\n\n**[rights defenders use “just](https://targetedthreats.net/)** **[enough” technical sophistication, coupled with carefully planned deception. This case demonstrates that](https://citizenlab.org/2016/08/group5-syria/)**\n\n**not all threats follow this pattern. The iPhone has a well-deserved reputation for security. As the iPhone platform is tightly**\n\n**controlled by Apple, technically sophisticated exploits are often required to enable the remote installation and operation of iPhone**\n\n**monitoring tools. These exploits are rare and expensive. Firms that specialize in acquiring zero-days often pay handsomely for**\n\n**[iPhone exploits. One such firm, Zerodium, acquired an exploit chain similar to the Trident for �one million dollars in November 2015.](https://www.zerodium.com/ios9.html)**\n\n**The high cost of iPhone zero days the apparent use of NSO Group’s government exclusive Pegasus product andprior known**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Remarkably, this case marks the third commercial “lawful intercept” spyware suite employed in attempts to compromise Mansoor. In**\n\n**2011, he was targeted with FinFisher’s FinSpy spyware, and in 2012 he was targeted with Hacking Team’s Remote Control System.**\n\n**Both Hacking Team and FinFisher have been the object of several years of revelations highlighting the misuse of spyware to**\n\n**compromise civil society groups, journalists, and human rights workers.**\n\n**Figure 1: Ahmed Mansoor, the “Million Dollar Dissident.”**\n\n**The attack on Mansoor is further evidence that “lawful intercept” spyware has significant abuse potential, and that some�**\n\n**governments cannot resist the temptation to use such tools against political opponents, journalists, and human rights defenders.**\n\n**Our findings also highlight the continuing lack of effective human rights policies and due diligence at spyware companies, and the�**\n\n**continuing lack of incentives to address abuses of “lawful intercept” spyware.**\n\n**Our report proceeds as follows:**\n\n**Section 2 provides an overview of the attack against Ahmed Mansoor.**\n\n**Section 3 details NSO Group’s tradecraft, gleaned from what appears to be a copy of NSO Group documentation leaked in**\n\n**the Hacking Team emails.**\n\n**Section 4 summarizes our technical analysis of the attack against Mansoor (in collaboration with Lookout).**\n\n**Section 5 describes how we found what appears to be the NSO Group’s mobile attack infrastructure while working on our**\n\n**[previous Stealth Falcon report.](https://citizenlab.org/2016/05/stealth-falcon/)**\n\n**Section 6 links the spyware used in the attack on Mansoor to NSO Group.**\n\n**Section 7 outlines evidence of other individuals targeted with the infrastructure that we linked to NSO Group, including**\n\n**Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera.**\n\n**Section 8 explains how the attack on Mansoor fits into the context of ongoing attacks on UAE dissidents.�**\n\n**Section 9 concludes the report.**\n\n# 2. Ahmed Mansoor Targeted With iPhone Zero-Day\n\n**[Ahmed Mansoor is an internationally recognized human rights defender, blogger, and member of Human Rights Watch’s advisory](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/ahmed-mansoor-selected-as-the-2015-laureate-martin-ennals-award-for-human-rights-defenders/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**punishment**\n\n**On the morning of August 10, 2016, Mansoor received an SMS text message that appeared suspicious. The next day he received a**\n\n**second, similar text. The messages promised “new secrets” about detainees tortured in UAE prisons, and contained a hyperlink to**\n\n**an unfamiliar website. The messages arrived on Mansoor’s stock iPhone 6 running iOS 9.3.3.**\n\n**Figure 2: Ahmed Mansoor received suspicious text messages in August 2016. Credit: Martin Ennals Foundation.**\n\n**Mansoor quickly forwarded the messages to Citizen Lab researchers for investigation. He has good reason to be concerned about**\n\n**unsolicited messages: every year since 2011, Mansoor has been targeted with spyware attacks, including with FinFisher spyware in**\n\n**[2011 and Hacking Team spyware in 2012 (see Section 8: Ahmed Mansoor and Previous UAE Attacks).](https://citizenlab.org/2012/10/backdoors-are-forever-hacking-team-and-the-targeting-of-dissent/)**\n\n**Figure 3: SMS text messages received by Mansoor (English: “New secrets about torture of Emiratis in state prisons”). The**\n\n**sender’s phone numbers are spoofed.**\n\n**When Mansoor’s messages reached us, we recognized the links: the domain name webadv.co belongs to a network of domains**\n\n**that we believe to be part of an exploit infrastructure provided by the spyware company NSO Group (see Section 6: Linking NSO**\n\n**Group Products to the Attack on Mansoor). We had first come across the NSO Group infrastructure during the course of our�**\n\n**[earlier research into Stealth Falcon a UAE based threat actor (see Section 5: Tracking a Mobile Attack Infrastructure)](https://citizenlab.org/2016/05/stealth-falcon/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**g** **y** **g** **g** **p** **g**\n\n**previously found several public occurrences of links involving these domains on Twitter (see Section 7: Evidence of Other**\n\n**Targets), none of the links we found seemed to be active (i.e., none produced an infection when we tested them). In other exploit**\n\n**[infrastructures with which we are familiar (e.g., Hacking Team’s exploit infrastructure), we had noted that operators prefer to](https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/121783)**\n\n**deactivate such links after a single click, or after a short period of time, perhaps in order to prevent the disclosure of the exploit to**\n\n**security researchers.**\n\n**We accessed the link Mansoor provided us on our own stock factory-reset iPhone 5 (Mansoor had an iPhone 6) with iOS 9.3.3 (the**\n\n**same version as Mansoor). When we clicked the link, we saw that it was indeed active, and watched as unknown software was**\n\n**remotely implanted on our phone. This suggested that the link contained a zero-day iPhone remote jailbreak: a chain of heretofore**\n\n**unknown exploits used to remotely circumvent iPhone security measures. To verify our observations, we shared our findings with�**\n\n**Lookout Security. Both research teams determined that Mansoor was targeted with a zero-day iPhone remote jailbreak. The chain**\n\n**of exploits, which we are calling the Trident, included the following (see Section 4: The Trident iOS Exploit Chain and Payload for**\n\n**more details):**\n\n**[CVE-2016-4657: An exploit for WebKit, which allows execution of the initial shellcode](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2016-4657)**\n\n**[CVE-2016-4655: A Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) bypass exploit to find the base address of the�](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2016-4655)**\n\n**kernel**\n\n**[CVE-2016-4656: 32 and 64 bit iOS kernel exploits that allow execution of code in the kernel, used to jailbreak the phone and](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2016-4656)**\n\n**allow software installation**\n\n**The implant installed by the Trident exploit chain would have turned Mansoor’s iPhone into a digital spy in his pocket. The spyware,**\n\n**which appears to be NSO’s Pegasus spyware solution, was capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to**\n\n**eavesdrop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat**\n\n**apps, and tracking his movements.**\n\n# 3. NSO Group and the Pegasus Solution\n\n**[The attack on Mansoor appears to have used Pegasus, a remote monitoring solution sold by NSO Group Technologies Ltd (see](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/1.574805)**\n\n**Section 6: Linking NSO Group Products to the Attack on Mansoor). NSO Group, based in Herzelia, Israel (CR# 514395409),**\n\n**develops and sells mobile phone surveillance software to governments around the world. The company describes itself as a**\n\n**[“leader” in “mobile and cellular Cyber Warfare,” and has been operating for more than six years since its founding in 2010.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/815991-1276-nso-group-brochure-pegasus.html)**\n\n**NSO Group appears to be owned by a private equity firm with headquarters in San Francisco: �Francisco Partners Management**\n\n**[LLC, which reportedly acquired it in 2014 after approval from the Israeli Defense Ministry.

Pegasus Documents in Hacking Team Leak\n\n**[Much of the publicly available information about Pegasus seems to be rumor, conjecture, or unverifiable claims made to media� about](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/08/01/can-this-israeli-startup-hack-your-phone/)**\n\n**[capabilities. However, when we examined the Hacking Team emails leaked online after a 2015 breach, we found several instances](https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/)**\n\n**of Hacking Team clients or resellers sharing what appeared to be NSO Group’s product documentation and sales pitches.**\n\n**For instance, in December 2014, a reseller of surveillance technologies to the Mexican government forwarded a PDF document**\n\n**[containing detailed technical specifications of NSO Group’s Pegasus system to Hacking Team�. According to the document’s](https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/5391)**\n\n**[metadata, it appears to have been created in December 2013 by Guy Molho, who is listed on LinkedIn as the Director of Product](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guymolho)**\n\n**Management at NSO Group.**\n\n## 3.2. Device Infection\n\n**According to the purported 2013 NSO Group Pegasus documentation found in the Hacking Team materials, NSO Group offers two**\n\n**remote installation vectors for spyware onto a target’s device: a zero-click vector, and a one-click vector. The one-click vector**\n\n**involves sending the target a normal SMS text message with a link to a malicious website. The malicious website contains an**\n\n**exploit for the web browser on the target’s device, and any other required exploits to implant the spyware. In the attack against**\n\n**Mansoor, the Trident exploit chain was used.**\n\n**To use NSO Group’s zero-click vector, an operator instead sends the same link via a special type of SMS message, like a WAP**\n\n**Push Service Loading (SL) message. A WAP Push SL message causes a phone to automatically open a link in a web browser**\n\n**instance, eliminating the need for a user to click on the link to become infected. Many newer models of phones have started**\n\n**ignoring or restricting WAP Push messages. Mobile network providers may also decide to block these messages.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The documentation refers to a malicious website employed in installation of the spyware (“Agent”) as an Anonymizer, which**\n\n**communicates with a Pegasus Installation Server located on the operator’s premises. When a target visits a malicious link from**\n\n**[their device, the Anonymizer forwards the request to the Pegasus Installation Server, which examines the target device’s User-Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent)**\n\n**header to determine if Pegasus has an exploit chain, such as the Trident, that supports the device.**\n\n**If the device is supported, the Pegasus Installation Server returns the appropriate exploit to the target device through the**\n\n**Anonymizer and attempts an infection. If infection fails for any reason, the target’s web browser will redirect to a legitimate website**\n\n**specified by the Pegasus operator, in order to avoid arousing the target’s suspicion.�**\n\n**In the operation targeting Mansoor, the one-click vector was used, with anonymizer sms.webadv.co (see Section 4: The Trident**\n\n**iOS Exploit Chain and Payload for more details).**\n\n## 3.3. Data Collection\n\n**According to the purported NSO Group documentation, once successfully implanted on a phone using an exploit chain like the**\n\n**Trident, Pegasus can actively record or passively gather a variety of different data about the device. By giving full access to the**\n\n**phone’s files, messages, microphone and video camera, the operator is able to turn the device into a silent digital spy in the target’s�**\n\n**pocket.**\n\n**Figure 7: Diagram from purported NSO Group Pegasus documentation showing the range of information gathered from a**\n\n**[device infected with Pegasus. Source: Hacking Team Emails.](https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/5391)**\n\n**In the spyware used in targeting Mansoor, we confirmed many elements of this functionality, and observed indications that the�**\n\n**collection of the following types of data was supported, among others (see Section 4.2: The Payload for more details):**\n\n**Calls made by phone, WhatsApp and Viber,**\n\n**SMS messages, as well as messages and other data from popular apps like Gmail, WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook,**\n\n**KakaoTalk, Telegram, and others,**\n\n**A wide range of personal data, such as calendar data and contact lists, as well as passwords, including Wi-Fi passwords.**\n\n## 3.4. Exfiltration�\n\n**According to the purported NSO Group documentation, an infected device transmits collected information back to a Pegasus Data**\n\n**_Server at the operator’s premises, via the PATN (Pegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network). The PATN appears to be a proxy_**\n\n**[chain system similar to Hacking Team’s anonymizers and FinFisher’s relays. The chain is intended to obfuscate the identity of the](https://citizenlab.org/2014/02/mapping-hacking-teams-untraceable-spyware/)**\n\n**government client associated with a particular operation** **Once the collected information arrives on the Pegasus Data Server an**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8: A purported screenshot of NSO Group’s Pegasus Working Station software, which visualizes location data**\n\n**[collected from infected devices (as of March 2012). Source: Hacking Team Emails.](https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/5391)**\n\n**The implant in the attack targeting Mansoor communicated with two PATN nodes: aalaan.tv and manoraonline.net. The first of�**\n\n**[these, aalaan.tv, appears to be a lookalike domain for the legitimate alaan.tv, a Gulf-based satellite television channel (see Section](http://www.alaan.tv/)**\n\n**5.2 for more details on lookalike domains observed in apparent NSO Group infrastructure).**\n\n## 3.5. Prioritizing Stealth\n\n**One interesting design decision of NSO Group’s Pegasus system, according to the purported NSO Group documentation, is that it**\n\n**emphasizes stealth above almost all else. As the documentation states:**\n\n**_In general, we understand that it is more important that the source will not be exposed and the target will suspect_**\n\n**_nothing than keeping the agent alive and working._**\n\n**Certain Pegasus features are only enabled when the device is idle and the screen is off, such as “environmental sound recording”**\n\n**(hot mic) and “photo taking.” The documentation also states that the spyware implements a “self-destruct mechanism,” which may**\n\n**be activated automatically “in cases where a great probability of exposing the agent exists.” However, the documentation claims**\n\n**that sometimes Pegasus removal can result in an infected device rebooting immediately after removal.**\n\n# 4. The Trident iOS Exploit Chain and Payload\n\n**_In this section, we describe our technical analysis of the attack on Mansoor, including the Trident iOS Exploit chain and payload._**\n\n**_Given the accelerated timeframe of this case, we are publishing the results of a preliminary analysis._**\n\n**Recall that the investigation that led to the discovery of the Trident exploit chain began when UAE human rights activist Ahmed**\n\n**Mansoor forwarded to Citizen Lab two suspicious links that he received via SMS on his iPhone (Section 2). Suspecting the links to**\n\n**be iPhone spyware associated with NSO Group (Section 6), we accessed them from our own stock factory-reset iPhone 5 running**\n\n**iOS 9.3.3. Mansoor’s device is an iPhone 6, running iOS 9.3.3; we did not have an iPhone 6 available for testing. Although the**\n\n**[latest iOS version when Mansoor received the links was 9.3.4, this version had been released only one week beforehand.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207026)**\n\n**We accessed the links by opening Safari on our iPhone, and manually transcribing the links from the screenshots that Mansoor**\n\n**sent. After about ten seconds of navigating to the URL, which displayed a blank page, the Safari window closed, and we observed**\n\n**no further visual activity on the iPhone’s screen. Meanwhile, we saw that the phone was served what appeared to be a Safari**\n\n**exploit, followed by intermediate files (�final111�), and a final payload (�test111.tar). The first two payloads form the Trident exploit�**\n\n**chain, and test111.tar is the payload.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: Requests from our phone to sms.webadv.co as we clicked on the malicious link. The first request is our click on�**\n\n**the link. The requests for ntf_bed.html, ntf_brc.html, and test111.tar are conducted by a stage2 binary (in final111). All�**\n\n**previous requests are conducted by Safari.**\n\n**Suspecting what we had observed to be the work of a zero-day iPhone remote jailbreak, we shared the exploit and payloads with**\n\n**colleagues at Lookout Security, initiated a responsible disclosure process with Apple, and sent Apple the exploit and payloads.**\n\n## 4.1. The Trident Exploit Chain\n\n**_This section provides a high-level overview of the Trident exploit chain used in the attack against Mansoor. For further details, see_**\n\n**_[Lookout’s report.](https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/lookout-pegasus-technical-analysis.pdf)_**\n\n**When a user opens the links sent to Mansoor on an iPhone, a stage1 containing obfuscated JavaScript is downloaded. The**\n\n**JavaScript downloads (via XMLHttpRequest) stage2 binaries for either 32-bit (iPhone 5 and earlier) or 64-bit (iPhone 5s and later),**\n\n**depending on the type of device. The stage1 employs a previously undocumented memory corruption vulnerability in WebKit to**\n\n**execute this code within the context of the Safari browser (CVE-2016-4657).**\n\n**The stage2 exploits a function that returns a kernel memory address, from which the base address of the kernel can be mapped**\n\n**(CVE-2016-4655). The stage2 then employs a memory corruption vulnerability in the kernel (CVE-2016-4656). This last**\n\n**vulnerability is employed to disable code signing enforcement, allowing the running of unsigned binaries. The stage2 downloads**\n\n**and installs the stage3, which is the spyware payload.**\n\n## 4.2. The Payload\n\n**_[This section provides a high-level overview of the functionality of the spyware payload. For more details, see Lookout’s report.](https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/lookout-pegasus-technical-analysis.pdf)_**\n\n### 4.2.1. Persistence\n\n**The Trident is re-run locally on the phone at each boot, using the JavaScriptCore binary. To facilitate persistence, the spyware**\n\n**disables Apple’s automatic updates, and detects and removes other jailbreaks.**\n\n### 4.2.2. Recording\n\n**[The attack payload includes a renamed copy of Cydia Substrate, a third-party app developer framework, which it uses to help](http://www.cydiasubstrate.com/)**\n\n**facilitate recording of messages and phone calls from targeted apps. To record WhatsApp and Viber calls, the spyware injects**\n\n**WhatsApp and Viber using the Cydia Substrate, hooks various call status methods, and sends system-wide notifications when call�**\n\n**events occur; the spyware listens for these notifications and starts or stops recording as appropriate. It appears that the payload�**\n\n**i** **l di** **iM** **G** **il Vib** **F** **b** **k Wh** **A** **T l** **Sk** **Li** **K k** **T lk W Ch** **S**\n\n\n-----\n\n**passwords and networks.**\n\n### 4.2.3. Exfiltration�\n\n**The attack payload beacons back to command and control (C2) servers delivered in stage2 of the Trident, via HTTPS.

Tracking a Mobile Attack Infrastructure\n\n**_This section explains how we first identified what appeared to be a mobile attack infrastructure while tracking Stealth Falcon. We�_**\n\n**_then outline some basic observations about the infrastructure, including themes in the domain names used by the attackers. We_**\n\n**_link the infrastructure we found to NSO Group in Section 6._**\n\n## 5.1. Stealth Falcon Leads Us to a Mobile Attack Infrastructure\n\n**[A year or so before Ahmed Mansoor received his suspicious SMS messages, we were tracking Stealth Falcon, a threat actor](https://citizenlab.org/2016/05/stealth-falcon/)**\n\n**targeting individuals critical of the UAE government at home and abroad, several of whom were later arrested. For full details on**\n\n**[Stealth Falcon, read our May 2016 report.](https://citizenlab.org/2016/05/stealth-falcon/)**\n\n**In the course of our investigation, we traced Stealth Falcon’s spyware to dozens of different command and control (C2) domains.**\n\n**One server that matched our C2 fingerprint for Stealth Falcon’s custom spyware, �icloudcacher.com, was connected to the email**\n\n**address pn1g3p@sigaint.org, according to data in its DNS SOA record. The same email address appeared in WHOIS records for**\n\n**the following three domains:**\n\n\n**asrarrarabiya.com**\n**asrararabiya.co**\n**asrararablya.com**\n\n\n**These domains did not match our Stealth Falcon fingerprint. As we examined the domains, however, we found that the index page�**\n\n**on these domains contained an iframe pointing to the website asrararabiya.com (Asrar Arabiya, or “Arabian Secrets” in English),**\n\n**[which appears to be a benign website that takes a critical view of the Arab World’s “dictatorships.” The index page also contained a](http://asrararabiya.com/%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%86/)**\n\n**nearly invisible iframe pointing to an odd looking site, smser.net.**\n\n\n**<iframe src=\"https://smser.net/9918216t/\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\"></iframe>**\n**<iframe src=\"http://asrararabiya.com/\" style=\"width:100%; height:1200px; position:absolute; top:-5px;**\n**left:-5px;\" border=\"0\"></iframe>**\n\n\n**Figure 10: HTML content of the index page on the three fake “Asrar Arabiya” domains.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**https://smser.net/redirect.aspx.**\n\n\n**<html><head><meta http-equiv='refresh' content='0;url=http://www.google.com' /><meta http-**\n**equiv='refresh' content='1;url=http://www.google.com' /><title></title></head><body></body></html>**\n\n\n**Figure 11: HTML content of https://smser.net/redirect.aspx.

We found 237 live IP addresses, and extracted their domain names from the SSL](https://zmap.io/)**\n\n**certificates returned by the each server. The SSL certificates we found included �*.webadv.co, manoraonline.net, and aalaan.tv,**\n\n**the three domains in the spyware attack sent to Mansoor.**\n\n**We linked these IPs and domain names to what appears to be NSO Group exploit infrastructure.**\n\n## 5.2. Coding the Domain Names\n\n**We coded the domain names we found, and identified several common themes, perhaps indicating the type of bait content that�**\n\n**targets would receive. Interestingly, the most common theme among the domains we identified was “News Media,” perhaps�**\n\n**indicating the use of fake news articles to trick targets into clicking on spyware links. An example of one such attack in action is the**\n\n**targeting of Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera (Section 7.1).**\n\n**We also noted the prevalence of themes we had seen in other spearphishing attacks, e.g., online accounts, document sharing,**\n\n**shipment tracking, corporate account portals. Another common theme was ISPs, perhaps because a target may trust an SMS**\n\n**appearing to come from an ISP or Telco they subscribe to.**\n\n**Figure 12: Most commonly recurring domain name themes.**\n\n**Alarmingly some of the names suggested a willingness on the part of the operators to impersonate governments and international**\n\n\n-----\n\n**We also identified the domain� topcontactco.com which may be a lookalike for tpcontact.co.uk, a website belonging to**\n\n**Teleperformance, a company that has managed UK visa application processing in many countries.**\n\n**[Figure 13: Screenshot from an article published by the UK Government on how to apply for a visa.](https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/how-to-apply-for-a-uk-visa)**\n\n**[Visa applicants are required to visit the legitimate tpcontact.co.uk website as part of the online visa application process.

Historical Scanning Data Connects Mansoor Attack to NSO Group-linked Infrastructure\n\n**The links sent to Mansoor used the domain sms.webadv.co. The network of 237 live IP addresses we mapped (Section 5)**\n\n**included 52.8.153.44, to which sms.webadv.co resolves, and which returns an SSL certificate for �*.webadv.co. The 237 IPs also**\n\n**included 52.8.52.166 (aalaan.tv) and 162.209.103.68 (manoraonline.net), which were the two C2 servers in the spyware used in**\n\n**targeting Mansoor.**\n\n**However, the 237 IPs and related domain names that we mapped did not provide insight into the identity of the threat actor. The IP**\n\n**addresses all appeared to be associated with cloud VPS providers, which gave no clue as to the identities of the operators, and the**\n\n**WHOIS information was mostly private. We did note that several domain names had WHOIS registrants based in Israel (e.g.,**\n\n**thainews.asia, kenyasms.org).**\n\n**[We examined historical scanning data to see whether we could attribute the 237 IPs to a threat actor.

Ahmed Mansoor and Previous UAE Attacks\n\n**_In this section, we provide an overview of previous attacks we have documented against Ahmed Mansoor, and other UAE_**\n\n**_dissidents. The technical sophistication of previous attacks we observed pales in comparison to the present attack._**\n\n**Ahmed Mansoor has been a frequent target of past electronic attacks. In March 2011, he was targeted with FinFisher spyware**\n\n**disguised as a PDF of a pro-democracy petition he had previously signed. The spyware arrived in the form of an executable file�**\n\n**inside a .rar file attached to an email. Mansoor noticed that the file was an EXE file rather than a PDF, and did not open it. Mansoor�**\n\n**[and four other activists (the “UAE Five”) were imprisoned in April 2011, and charged with insulting the leaders of the UAE. Mansoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE_Five)**\n\n**and the others were pardoned in November of the same year.**\n\n**[In July of 2012, Ahmed Mansoor’s laptop was infected with Hacking Team spyware delivered via a booby-trapped Microsoft Word](https://citizenlab.org/2012/10/backdoors-are-forever-hacking-team-and-the-targeting-of-dissent/)**\n\n**document exploiting an old Microsoft Office vulnerability, CVE 2010-3333. The spyware sent information from his computer to a�**\n\n**UAE intelligence agency, apparently operating under the auspices of the office of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a son of the�**\n\n**founder of the UAE, and now the UAE Deputy National Security Advisor. Attackers broke into Mansoor’s email account shortly after**\n\n**the infection. We assisted Mansoor in recovering from the attack. Another UAE-based human rights activist, and a UAE-based**\n\n**journalist were also targeted in the same operation.**\n\n**In early 2013, Mansoor was sent a link to a website that attempted to install spyware on his computer by exploiting a public Java**\n\n**vulnerability for which no patch had yet been issued. He realized the link was suspicious and did not click on it. Throughout 2013**\n\n**[and 2014, Mansoor was unsuccessfully targeted several times with spyware, mostly XTremeRAT, SpyNet RAT, and njRAT delivered](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-marczak.pdf)**\n\n**[as executable files in attachments or through Google Drive links. In 2014, Mansoor’s �Twitter account was hacked.](https://twitter.com/AmnestyUAE/status/528909930783592449)**\n\n**[In a campaign stretching from 2012 until 2016, UAE dissidents at home and abroad were targeted by Stealth Falcon, an attacker](https://citizenlab.org/2016/05/stealth-falcon/)**\n\n**likely linked to a UAE government agency. Stealth Falcon sent out links involving a fake URL shortener that employed Javascript to**\n\n**profile targets’ computers, checked which antivirus programs they had installed, and attempted to deanonymize them if they were�**\n\n**using Tor. Stealth Falcon also sent out Microsoft Word documents containing custom spyware that was installed if a user enabled**\n\n**macros. Targets included five dissidents who were later arrested or convicted in absentia, as well as Rori Donaghy, a UK-based�**\n\n**journalist who had been publishing articles about leaked emails involving members of the UAE government.**\n\n# 9. Conclusion\n\n**In this report, we identify a highly technically sophisticated attack involving a zero-day iPhone remote jailbreak — Trident — which**\n\n**installs spyware on a phone whose user clicks just once on a malicious link. We connected the attack to NSO Group’s Pegasus**\n\n**spyware suite, sold exclusively to government agencies by Israel-based NSO Group. We made the connection based on our**\n\n**previous work tracing a group of servers that appeared to be part of an infrastructure for attacking mobile phones. Long before**\n\n**Ahmed Mansoor had forwarded us any suspicious links he received, we had mapped out a set of 237 servers (Section 5), and**\n\n**linked this set to NSO Group (Section 6). When Mansoor sent us screencaptures of the SMS messages containing the links, we**\n\n**immediately matched the links’ domain name to our list of suspected servers associated with NSO Group’s Pegasus.**\n\n**We visited the links Mansoor sent us from a colleague’s factory-reset stock iPhone, and managed to capture the exploits and**\n\n**payload, as the phone was infected. We shared these artifacts with Lookout to gain more insight into the technical capabilities of**\n\n**the exploits and spyware, and with Apple as part of a responsible disclosure process. Apple has been highly responsive, and has**\n\n**worked very quickly to develop and issue a patch in the form of iOS 9.3.5, approximately 10 days after our initial report to them.**\n\n**Once an iPhone is updated to this most recent version, it will be immediately protected against the Trident exploit chain used in this**\n\n**attack. While we assume that NSO Group and others will continue to develop replacements for the Trident, we hope that our**\n\n**experience encourages other researchers to promptly and responsibly disclose such vulnerabilities to Apple and to other vendors.**\n\n\n**What Can You Do?**\n\n**[All iPhone owners should update to the latest version of iOS (9.3.5) immediately. If you’re unsure what version you’re running,](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204)**\n**[you can check it yourself by tapping Settings > General > About > Version.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201685)**\n\n**[Citizen Lab agrees with Apple that users should avoid opening or downloading items from messages and websites unless](http://apple.com/support)**\n**they are certain that they come from a legitimate, trusted source.

If you suspect you have been the target of this attack, please contact the Citizen Lab at info@citizenlab.org.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**with carefully planned deception, the attack on Mansoor demonstrates that not all threats follow this pattern.**\n\n**This is the third time Mansoor has been targeted with “lawful intercept” spyware; Mansoor was targeted in 2011 with spyware from**\n\n**FinFisher (based in Germany and the UK), in 2012 with spyware from Hacking Team (based in Italy), and now in 2016 with what**\n\n**appears to be spyware from NSO Group (based in Israel and reportedly owned by a US firm). That the companies whose spyware�**\n\n**was used to target Mansoor are all owned and operated from democracies speaks volumes about the lack of accountability and**\n\n**effective regulation in the cross-border commercial spyware trade.**\n\n**While these spyware tools are developed in democracies, they continue to be sold to countries with notorious records of abusive**\n\n**targeting of human rights defenders. Such sales occur despite the existence of applicable export controls. For example, Israel’s**\n\n**[export regime incorporates the dual-use technology controls of the Wassenaar Arrangement, including those related to “intrusion](http://www.hfn.co.il/client-update-decided-%E2%80%93-facilitate-cyber-export-controls-much-possible)**\n\n**software.” As such, NSO Group would presumably be required to obtain a license to export its products to the UAE. If NSO Group**\n\n**did submit a license application, the human rights abuses perpetrated by the UAE, including the misuse of “lawful intercept”**\n\n**capabilities, must not have outweighed authorities’ other motivations to approve the export.**\n\n**Clearly, additional legal and regulatory scrutiny of the the “lawful intercept” market, and of NSO Group’s activities in relation to the**\n\n**attacks we have described, is essential. Citizen Lab and others have repeatedly demonstrated that advanced “lawful intercept”**\n\n**spyware enables some governments and agencies, especially those operating without strong oversight, to target and harass**\n\n**journalists, activists and human rights workers. If spyware companies are unwilling to recognize the role that their products play in**\n\n**undermining human rights, or address these urgent concerns, they will continue to strengthen the case for further intervention by**\n\n**governments and other stakeholders.**\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n**Special thanks to the team at Lookout that we collaborated with in our investigation, especially: Max Bazaliy, Andrew Blaich, Kristy**\n\n**Edwards, Michael Flossman, Seth Hardy, and Mike Murray.**\n\n**Very special thanks to our talented Citizen Lab colleagues, especially: Ron Deibert, Sarah McKune, Claudio Guarnieri, Adam Senft,**\n\n**Irene Poetranto, and Masashi Nishihata.**\n\n**Special thanks to the teams at Apple Inc. with whom we have been in contact for their prompt and forthright engagement during the**\n\n**disclosure and patching process.**\n\n**Special thanks to Nicholas Weaver for supplying the iPhone that we infected in Section 4.
