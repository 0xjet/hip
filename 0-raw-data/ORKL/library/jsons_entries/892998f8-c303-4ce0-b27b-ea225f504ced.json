    "plain_text": "# Dissecting 'Operation Ababil' - an OSINT Analysis\n\n**[ddanchev.blogspot.com.es/2012/09/dissecting-operation-ababil-osint.html](http://ddanchev.blogspot.com.es/2012/09/dissecting-operation-ababil-osint.html)**\n\nProvoked by a questionable online video posted on YouTube, Muslims from the around the\n[world united in an apparent opt-in botnet crowdsourcing campaign aiming to launch a](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/attack-of-the-opt-in-botnets/6268)\nDDoS (denial of service attack) against YouTube for keeping the video online, and against\nseveral **[major U.S banks and financial institutions.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/21/us-iran-cyberattacks-idUSBRE88K12H20120921)**\n\nDubbed \"Operation Ababil\", and operated by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam a.k.a Qassam Cyber\nFighters, the campaign appear to have had a limited, but highly visible impact on the\ntargeted web sites. Just like in every other crowdsourced opt-in botnet campaign such as the\n[\"Coordinated Russia vs Georgia cyber attack in progress\", the \"Iranian opposition](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/coordinated-russia-vs-georgia-cyber-attack-in-progress/1670)\n**launches organized cyber attack against pro-Ahmadinejad sites\", the \"Electronic Jihad**\n**[v3.0 - What Cyber Jihad Isn't\" campaign, and the \"The DDoS Attack Against CNN.com\"](http://ddanchev.blogspot.com/2008/04/ddos-attack-against-cnncom.html)**\ncampaign, political sentiments over the attribution element seem to have orbited around the\n[notion that it was nation-sponsored by the Iranian government.](http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2012/09/24/lieberman-blame-iran-for-cyber-attacks-on-bank-america-chase/)\n\nWhat's so special about this attack? Did the individuals behind it poses sophisticated hacking\nor coding abilities? Was the work of hacktivists crowdsourcing bandwidth, or was it actually\nsponsored by the Iranian government? Can we even talk about attack attribution given that\nthe group claiming responsibility for the attacks doesn't have a strong digital fingerprint?\n\nIn this post, I'll perform an OSINT (open source intelligence) analysis aiming to expose one\nof the individuals part of the group that organized the campaign, spread their propaganda\nmessage to as many Muslim Facebook groups as possible, and actually claim responsibility\n\n\n-----\n\nfor the attacks once they took place.\n\nThe campaign originally began with a message left on Pastebin.com by the Qassam Cyber\nFighters group announcing \"Operation Ababil\":\n\n**The original message left is as follows:**\n\"Operation Ababil, The second weekIn the previous announcements we stated that we will\n_not tolerate insulting exalted character of the prophet of mercy and kindness. Due to the_\n_insult, we planned and accomplished a series of cyber operations against the insulting_\n_country's credit and financial centers.Some U.S. officials tried to divert people's attention_\n_from the subject and claimed that the main aim of the operation was not deal to insults but it_\n_had other intentions._\n\n_The officials claimed that certain countries have taken these measures to solve their internal_\n_problems.We strongly reject the American officials' insidious attempts to deceive public_\n_opinion. We declare that the kindness and love of Muslims and free-minded people of the_\n_world to the great prophet of Islam is much more than their violent anger be deflected and_\n_controlled by such deceptive tricks.Insult to a prophet is not acceptable especially when it is_\n_the Last prophet Muhammad (Peace Be upon Him)._\n\n_So as we promised before, the attack will be continued until the removal of that sacrilegious_\n_movie from the Internet.Therefore, we suggest a Timetable for this week attacks. Knowing_\n_which times the banks and other targets are out of service, the customers of targeted sites_\n_also can manage to do their jobs as well and have a rest while the specific organization is_\n_under attack.We shall attack for 8 hours daily, starting at 2:30 PM GMT, every day._\n\n_We repeat again the attacks will continue for sure till the removal of that sacrilegious_\n_movie.We invite all cyberspace workers to join us in this Proper Act. If America's arrogant_\n_government do not submit, the attack will be large and larger and will include other evil_\n_countries like Israel, French and U.Kingdom indeed.Tuesday 9/25/2012 : attack to Wells_\n_Fargo site, www.wellsfargo.comWednesday 9/26/2012 : attack to U.S. Bank site,_\n_www.usbank.comThursday 9/27/2012 : attack to PNC site, www.pnc.com Weekends:_\n_planning for the next week' attacks.Mrt. Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters\"_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Periodically, the group also released update notes for the campaigns currently taking**\n**place:**\n\n**The original message published is as follows:**\n\"Operation Ababil\" started over BoA :http://pastebin.com/mCHia4W5\n_http://pastebin.com/wMma9zyGIn the second step we attacked the largest bank of the united_\n_states, the \"chase\" bank. These series of attacks will continue untill the Erasing of that nasty_\n_movie from the Internet.The site \"www.chase.com\" is down and also Online banking at_\n_\"chaseonline.chase.com\" is being decided to be Offline !Down with modern infidels.###_\n_Cyber fighters of Izz ad-din Al qassam ###\"_\n\n**Second statement released by the group:**\n\n**The original message published is as follows:**\n\"Dear Muslim youths, Muslims Nations and are noblemenWhen Arab nations rose against\n_their corrupt regimes (those who support Zionist regime) at the other hand when, Crucify_\n_infidels are terrified and they are no more supporting human rights. United States of America_\n_with the help of Zionist Regime made a Sacrilegious movie insulting all the religions not only_\n_Islam.All the Muslims worldwide must unify and Stand against the action, Muslims must do_\n_whatever is necessary to stop spreading this movie._\n\n_We will attack them for this insult with all we have.All the Muslim youths who are active in the_\n_Cyber world will attack to American and Zionist Web bases as much as needed such that_\n_they say that they are sorry about that insult.We, Cyber fighters of Izz ad-din Al qassam will_\n_attack the Bank of America and New York Stock Exchange for the first step. These Targets_\n\n\n-----\n\n_are properties of American-Zionist Capitalists. This attack will be started today at 2 pm. GMT._\n_This attack will continue till the Erasing of that nasty movie. Beware this attack can vary in_\n_type. Down with modern infidels.\"_\n\nClearly, the group behind the campaigns aimed to deliver concise propaganda to prospective\nInternet connected users who would later on be instructed on how to participate in the DDoS\nattacks. Let's assess the potential of the distributed DDoS tool that was used in the\ncampaign.\n\n**Sample screenshot of the DDoS script in Arabic:**\n\nInside the .html file, we can see that there are only three web addresses that will be targeted\nin their campaign:\n\n**Detection rate for the DDoS script:**\n[youtube.html - MD5: c3fd7601b4aefe70e4a8f6d73bf5c997](https://www.virustotal.com/file/a3be8deb4ebc8de1d0d19467da606033c8938cf74d1489761fbc9e195d7d1c75/analysis/1348697936/)\nDetected by 6 out of 43 antivirus scanners as HTool-Loic; Hacktool.Generic;\nTROJ_GEN.F47V0924\n\nOriginally, the attack relied on a static recruitment message which included links to the DIY\nDDoS script located on 4shared.com and Mediafire.com. What's particularly interesting is\nthe fact that the files were uploaded by a user going under the handle of \"Marzi Mahdavi II\".\nIt's important to point out that these static links were distributed as part of the recruitment\ncampaign across multiple Muslim-friendly Facebook groups.\nThanks to this fact, we could easily identify the user's Facebook account, and actually spot\nthe original message seeking participation in the upcoming attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Marzi Mahdavi II s Facebook account:**\n\n**Sample shared Wall post seeking participation in the upcoming DDoS campaign:**\n\nSample blog post enticing users to participate:\n\n\n-----\n\nMarzi Mahdavi II has once referenced a link pointing to the same blog, clearly indicating that\nhe's following the ongoing recruitment campaigns across multiple Web sites:\n\n**Second blog post enticing users to participate in the DDoS campaign:**\n\nThis very latest example of Iran's hacktivist community understanding of the cyber\noperations, once again lead me to the conclusion that what we've got here is either the fact\nthat Iran's hacktivist community is lacking behind with years compared to sophisticated\nEastern European hacking teams and cybercrime-friendly communities, or that Iran is on\npurposely demonstrating low cyber operation capabilities in an attempt to trick the Western\nworld into thinking that it's still in a \"catch up mode\" with the rest of the world when it comes\nto offensive cyber operations.\n\nDid these coordinated DDoS campaigns actually had any impact on the targered web sites?\nAccording to data from the Host-Tracker, they seem to have achieved limited, but visible\nresults, a rather surprising fact given the low profile DDoS script released by the\ncampaigners.\n\n**Sample Host-Tracker report for a targeted web site during the campaign:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Second Host-Tracker report for a targeted web site during the campaign:**\n\n**Third Host-Tracker report for a targeted web site during the campaign:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fourth Host-Tracker report for a targeted web site during the campaign:**\n\n**Fifth Host-Tracker report for a targeted web site during the campaign:**\n\n\n-----\n\nIs the Iranian government really behind this campaign, or was it actually the work of\namateurs with outdated and virtually irrelevant technical skills? Taking into consideration the\n[previous DDoS campaign launched by Iranian hacktivists in 2009, in this very latest one](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/iranian-opposition-launches-organized-cyber-attack-against-pro-ahmadinejad-sites/3613)\nwe once again see a rather limited understanding of cyber operations taking into\nconsideration the centralized nature of the chain of command in this group.\n\nWhat's also worth pointing out is the fact that this is the first public appearance of the group\nthat claims responsibility for these attacks. Considering this and the lack of a strong digital\nfingerprint for the group in question, virtually anyone on the Internet can engineer cyber\n**warfare tensions between Iran and the U.S, by basically impersonating a what's believed**\nto be an Iranian group.\n\n**_This post has been reproduced from_** **_[Dancho Danchev's blog.
