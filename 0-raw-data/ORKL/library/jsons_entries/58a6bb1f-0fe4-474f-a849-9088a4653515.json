    "plain_text": "# Android Spyware Targeting Tanzania Premier League\n\n**[zscaler.com/blogs/research/android-spyware-targeting-tanzania-premier-league](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/android-spyware-targeting-tanzania-premier-league)**\n\nThe Zscaler ThreatLabZ team is always hunting for malware out in the wild. Recently, there\nhave been endless cases where attackers were targeting mobile users with malware\nleveraging the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAmidst all the COVID-related malware activities, we actually came across some Android\nmalware samples that weren't COVID-19 related. Instead, they were targeting the ongoing\nTanzania Mainland Premier League football season. The Tanzania Mainland Premier\nLeague is the top-level professional football (or soccer, as it is most commonly known here\nin the United States) league in Tanzania, Africa.\n\nWe came across some of the Android Packages (APKs) that were targeting two of the most\nfamous football clubs in Africa, namely Simba SC and Yanga (Young Africans) SC.\n\n_Figure 1: Logos for the Tanzania football clubs targeted in a recent scam._\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also found some legit apps on the Google Play store that are related to these clubs. As\nseen in Figure 2, the spyware portrays itself as official apps of the above-mentioned teams.\n\n_Figure 2: Real vs. fake logos for Simba SC and Yanga SC._\n\nThese apps are basically spyware, which include the following capabilities:\n\nRead SMS messages\nFetch contacts\nRecord audio\nCalling functionality\nAccess real-time location\nRead/write external storage\nSteal photos\n\n\n-----\n\nAccess the camera\n\nThese capabilities basically sum up a perfectly developed spyware with full-fledged features\nto spy on anyone.\n\nUpon further analysis, these APKs turned out to be developed using a popular surveillance\ntool named SpyMax. Its predecessor, SpyNote, was one of the most widely used spyware\nframeworks. In the past, there were instances where SpyNote was notoriously used\nto [victimise Netflix users and a](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/spynote-rat-posing-netflix-app) [wide range of other Android users.](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/new-wave-stalkerware-apps)\n\nSpyMax seems to be new favorite among attackers in the underground forums. We found\nsome evidence where SpyMax has been developed in these underground forums with its\nmain focus on the latest Android compatibility and antivirus evasion.\n\n_Figure 3: Underground forum discussions about SpyMax._\n\nAs seen in Figure 3, many of the discussions are about trying to make SpyMax samples\nfully undetectable (FUD) from antivirus scans.\n\nThough SpyMax is free in itself, some developers claim to have developed their own\nversions that are undetected by antivirus software and are selling the samples at rates\nranging from $45 to $350 per month. The same user in Figure 3 posted about his or her\ncosts as can be seen in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: A user discussing the costs of a FUD version of SpyMax._\n\nGetting back to the campaign, we unfortunately could not track back to the command and\ncontrol (C&C) server, as it was not active during our analysis. But we were able to get hold\nof some more samples that were designed by the same attacker or group of attackers.\n(Hashes can be found in IOC section at the end of this blog.)\n\nOne such sample developed by the attacker using SpyMax was a live streaming app\nthat claimed to stream live football matches from the Tanzania Premier League. The main\npurpose behind this is likely to reach a wide range of football fans and attack their devices.\nThe icons of the app can be seen in Figure 5 (Live Stream is the first from the left).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 5: Fake (Spyware) apps_\n\nAll these apps behave in exact same way. As soon as the victim tries to open the app, it\ncrashes with message saying \"App is not installed\" before suddenly hiding the icon. This\nactivity makes victim believe that the app might be faulty and got removed implicitly\nfrom mobile device. But in reality, the app hides itself from the victim and plays it's hideous\nactivities of spying on the user and sending all the stolen data back to the attacker.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNowadays, developing high-end surveillance apps (also termed spyware or stalkerware) is\nas easy as developing a basic Android app with the help of tools, such as SpyMax. Even a\nnovice can develop spyware and attack large number of public. As seen in this case, the\nattacker used SpyMax to target Android users interested in an ongoing football season.\nFrom a user point of view, it's always advisable to take utmost care when online, especially\nin times when work-from-home has become the norm.\n\nThe precautions you take online have been covered extensively; even so, we believe this\ninformation bears repeating. Please follow these basic precautions during the current crisis\n—and at all times:\n\n\n-----\n\nInstall apps only from official stores, such as Google Play.\nNever click on unknown links received through ads, SMS messages, emails, or\nthe like.\nAlways keep the \"Unknown Sources\" option disabled in the Android device. This\ndisallows apps to be installed on your device from unknown sources.\n\nWe would also like to mention that if you come across the incident of app hiding it's icon as\nseen in case above, always try to search for the app in your device settings. ( Settings ->\n_Apps -> Search for icon that was hidden)_\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Hash** **Package Name**\n\naa67921f19809edc87f1f79237e123e9c5c67019 com.yanga.yanga\n\n2ed2d804754d83aa5de32c27b4ca767d959bf3e8 com.yellowfans.yanga\n\nbea206cf83eea30bf5d0734d94764796d956c4f5 com.livestream.livestream\n\n1cc01da09849e17f83940d9250318d248f7ab77d com.simba.simba\n\n4c7a41d7b0a225f0fa61fe7dc18695e03c2690c8 com.yellowfans.yanga\n\n\n-----",
