This is a worldwide scandal – a global web of\nsurveillance whose scope is without precedent.\n\nThe attack is invisible. Once “infected,” your phone becomes your worst enemy. From within\nyour pocket, it instantly betrays your secrets and delivers your private conversations, your\npersonal photos, nearly everything about you. This surveillance has dramatic and in some\ncases even life-threatening consequences for the ordinary men and women who have been\ntargeted for their work exposing the misdeeds of their rulers or defending the rights of their\nfellow citizens.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of these individuals were targeted by states using the same spyware tool, Pegasus,\nsold by the NSO Group.\n\nOur mission at Forbidden Stories is to pursue – collaboratively – the work of threatened,\njailed or assassinated journalists. For the Pegasus Project, we investigated this new threat\nagainst press freedom for months, working alongside more than 80 journalists from 17\nmedia organizations.\n\nThis investigation began with enormous leak of documents that Forbidden Stories and\nAmnesty International had access to. In this list of more than 50,000 selected as targets by\nclients of NSO Group, we even found the names of some of our colleagues, journalists we\nhad worked with on past investigations.\n\nBut the scale of this scandal could only be uncovered by journalists around the world\nworking together. By sharing access to this data with the other media organisations in the\nForbidden Stories consortium, we were able to develop additional sources, collect hundreds\nof documents and put together the harrowing evidence of a surveillance apparatus that has\nbeen wielded ferociously against large swaths of civil society – outside of all legal\nrestrictions.\n\nAmong the targets: human rights defenders, political opponents, lawyers, diplomats, and\nheads of state – not to mention almost 200 journalists from nearly two dozen countries.\nSome are local reporters, others renowned television anchors. Many investigate corruption\nand political scandals that threaten the highest levels of power. Most already face\ncensorship and intimidation. But few of them could have imagined having been the target of\nsuch an invisible and invasive form of surveillance.\n\nThe list of journalists hacked by Pegasus is long: award-winning Azerbaijani journalist\nKhadija Ismayilova; reporter Szabolcs Panyi from Direkt36, an Hungarian investigative\nmedia outlet, freelance Morrocan journalist Hicham Mansouri; the director of the French\ninvestigative site Mediapart Edwy Plenel; and the founders of the Indian independent media\nThe Wire, one of the few news organizations in the country that does not rely on money\nfrom private business entities.\n\nFor NSO Group’s government clients, Pegasus is the perfect weapon to “kill the story”.\nInvasive surveillance of journalists and activists is not simply an attack on those individuals\n– it is a way to deprive millions of citizens of independent information about their own\ngovernments. When they hack a journalist’s phone, they are able to extract the most\nsensitive information that it holds. What was that journalist working on? Who are their\nsources? Where are they stashing their documents? Who are their loved ones? What\nprivate information could be used to blackmail and defame them?\n\n\n-----\n\nJournalists have long thought that new technologies – the armada of encrypted\ncommunications that they rely on – were their allies, critical blockades against censorship.\nWith the existence of cyber surveillance tools as advanced as Pegasus, they have been\nbrutally awoken to the fact that the greatest threats are hiding in the places they once\nthought to be the safest. The Pegasus Project poses important questions about the\nprivatization of the surveillance industry and the lack of global safeguards for everyday\ncitizens.\n\nWhen a threat as large as this emerges, imperiling fundamental rights like the right to free\nspeech, journalists need to come together. If one reporter is threatened or killed, another\ncan take over and ensure that the story is not silenced. Forty-five years ago, the first\ncollaborative journalism project was launched after the murder of Don Bolles, a journalist in\nPhoenix, Arizona. In 2018, Forbidden Stories coordinated the Daphne Project in the wake\nof the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia in Malta. We have continued to pursue the\nwork of journalists who have been murdered for their work – whether that was investigating\nenvironmental scandals or tracking Mexican drug cartels – alongside dozens of news\norganizations.\n\nThe collaboration of journalists from around the world is without a doubt one of the best\ndefenses against these violent attacks on global democracy.\n\n## The Pegasus Project | All the articles\n\n\n-----",
