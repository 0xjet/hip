The modular software is used to model data in data science,](https://jupyter.org/)\ncomputing, and machine learning. The project supports over 40 programming languages and is used by companies including Microsoft, IBM,\nand Google, alongside numerous universities.\n\n[Aqua Security's Team Nautilus recently discovered malware that has honed in on this popular data tool.](https://blog.aquasec.com/python-ransomware-jupyter-notebook)\n\nWhile Jupyter Notebook allows users to share their content with trusted contacts, access to the app is secured through account credentials or\ntokens. However, in the same way, that businesses sometimes do not secure their AWS buckets, leaving them open for anyone to view,\nNotebook misconfigurations have also been found.\n\nThe Python ransomware targets those that have accidentally left their environments vulnerable.\n\nThe researchers set up a honeypot containing an exposed Jupyter notebook application to observe the malware's behavior. The ransomware\noperator accessed the server, opened a terminal, downloaded a set of malicious tools -- including encryptors -- and then manually generated a\nPython script that executed ransomware.\n\nWhile the assault stopped without finishing the job, Team Nautilus was able to grab enough data to simulate the rest of the attack in a lab\nenvironment. The encryptor would copy and then encrypt files, delete any unencrypted content, and delete itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nscreenshot 2022 03 30 at 09 42 24.png\n\n\nAqua Security\nIt should be noted that no ransom note was included as part of the package, which the team suspects indicate one of two things: either the\nattacker was experimenting with their creation on the honeypot, or the honeypot timed out before the ransomware attack was completed.\n\nWhile attribution isn't concrete, the cybersecurity researchers say they might be \"familiar\" with the miscreant due to their trademark checks\nbefore an attack begins.\n\nClues indicate the individual could be from Russia, and if it is the same attacker, they have been linked to cryptojacking attacks on Jupyter\nenvironments in the past.\n\nA Shodan search reveals several hundred internet-facing Jupyter Notebook environments are open and accessible (although some may also\nbe honeypots.)\n\n\n-----\n\ne attac e s ga ed t a access a sco gu ed e o e ts, t e a a a so a e sc pt t at e c ypts e e y e o a g e pat o\nthe server and deletes itself after execution to conceal the attack,\" the researchers said. \"Since Jupyter notebooks are used to analyze data\nand build data models, this attack can lead to significant damage to organizations if these environments aren't properly backed up.\"\n\n**See also**\n\n**Have a tip?
