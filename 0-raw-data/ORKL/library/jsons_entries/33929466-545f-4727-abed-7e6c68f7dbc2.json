    "plain_text": "# Android Malware Intercepts SMS 2FA: We have the Logs!\n\n**[securityboulevard.com/2018/09/android-malware-intercepts-sms-2fa-we-have-the-logs/](https://securityboulevard.com/2018/09/android-malware-intercepts-sms-2fa-we-have-the-logs/)**\n\nby Gary Warner, UAB on September 10, 2018 September 10, 2018\n\nA couple years ago I was doing some phishing investigations training at the Police School in\nSantiago, Chile. One module in my training was called “Logs Don’t Lie” which pointed out\nthat in most cases we have everything we need to prioritize a phishing response just by\nlooking at the log files, either on the compromised phishing server, or in the Financial\nInstitutions own logs.\nMalware C2 servers are another great place to apply the rule “Logs Don’t Lie.” Most security\nresearchers realize that there is a great cloud of fellow researchers on Twitter sharing little\ntips and glimpses of their investigations. @LukasStefanko and @nullcookies and I have\nbeen looking at a C2 server for a piece of Android malware. And the Logs are AMAZINGLY\nhelpful at understanding just what kind of damage such a trojan can do!\n(Sidenote: @nullcookies is a monster for finding fresh and interesting phish (and often\n_related tools), while @LukasStefanko is an awesome malware analyst for ESET, specializing_\n_in Android-based malware. You should follow both on Twitter if you care about such things._\n_Thanks to them both for the pointer that leads to what follows.)_\n\nIn this case, the malware is believed to be called “Anubis II” and likely uses the “Builder” that\n[is depicted in this YouTube video, titled “Builder Android Bot Anubis 2“](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88pn0utCAEY)\n\n\n-----\n\nLauncher the APK Builder “Android Botnet Anubis II”\n\nMalware actor chooses from his list of banking targets\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the comments section of the video, someone has shared a screen shot of the botmaster s\ncontrol panel. In this case it is demonstrating that 619 Android phones can be controlled\nfrom the botnet:\n\nPhones that can be controlled from Anubis II control panel\n\nIn the particular instance referred to by Lukas and NullCookies, the malware seems to have\nbeen active primarily in June of 2018.  The server hosting the Anubis II panel has a list of\nbanks that it can present.\n\nThe targets which have custom web inject (or phone inject) content include:\n\n7 Austrian banks\n18 Australian banks\n5 Canadian banks\n6 Czech banks\n11 German banks\n11 Spanish banks\n11 French banks\n8 Hong Kong banks\n11 Indian banks\n6 Japanese banks\n1 Kenyan bank\n4 New Zealand banks\n32 Polish banks\n4 Romanian banks\n9 Turkish banks\n\n\n-----\n\n10 UK banks (Bank of Scotland, Barclays, CSGCSDNMB, Halifax, HSBC, Natwest,\nRoyal Bank of Scotland, Santander, TSB, Ulster)\n10 US banks (Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, Fifth Third, NetTeller, Skrill,\nSunTrust, USAA, US Bank, Wells Fargo Mobile)\n\n## Fake Android Login Pages for Banks\n\nWhile each of the 190 sites has a fake login page available, we thought we would show a\nsampling from banks around the world . . .\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are also several Crypto Currency organizations listed:\n\nblockchaine\ncoinbase\nlocalbitcoin\nunocoin\n\nAs well as some Online Payment, Email, and Social Media sites:\n\neBay\nFacebook\n\n\n-----\n\nGmail\nPayPal\nZebPay\n\nEach bank on the list has the equivalent of a phishing page that can be presented if the\nowner of the android phone attempts to log in to the given bank.\n\nSome of them have silly typographical errors that will hopefully reduce success, such as this\nWells Fargo content, inviting the phone owner to “Sing In” to the bank. Perhaps there is a\nWells Fargo Choir? Hopefully that will cause victims to NOT fall for this particular malware!\n\nThe Wells Fargo Choir? Sing On!\n\n## The SMS Intercepts\n\nOne of the main benefits of having access to the server was to see so many examples of\nsuccessful SMS message intercepts! At the time of the server dump, this one contained\n32,900+ unique “keylog” entries and 52,000+ logged SMS messages from at least 47 unique\ndevices.\n\nHere’s an example showing a Bank Two Factor Authentication request being forward to the\ncriminals:\n\n_Text: Bank of Redacted: 819881 is your authorization code which expires in 10 minutes. If_\n_you didn’t request the code, call 1.800.xxx.xxxx for assistance._\n\nKeylogging was also enabled, allowing the criminal to see when a bank app was being used:\n\n\n-----\n\n_06/14/2018, 09:07:34 EDT|(FOCUSED)|[From:, REDACTED BANK, Account Number:,_\n_******6680, Date:, May 30, 2018 10:10:42 AM EDT, Status:, Canceled, Amount:, $100.00,_\n_Type:, Deposit, Transfer ID:, 25098675]_\n\nIn this example, an online payment company is sharing a message:\n\n_06/29/2018, 15:28:46 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Friendly reminderThis is Mr. XXXXXXX from_\n_REDACTED.

Happy Stashing!_\n\n_Text: Cash App: 157-578 is the sign in code you requested._\n\n_Text: Your verification code for GotHookup is: 7074_\nIn a directory called “/numers/” there were also examples of address book dumps from\nphone contacts. The small number of these seem to indicate this would be a “triggered”\nrequest, where the botnet operator would have to request the address book. In the example\nwe found, with seven area code (404) numbers, four (770) numbers and four (678) numbers,\nit is likely an Atlanta Georgia based victim\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Keylogging feature also seems to be something that is turned on or off by request of the\nbotnet operators. There were far fewer devices for which keylogs were found.  Example\nkeylog entries looked like this:\n\nA telephone prompt looked like this:\n\n_06/15/2018, 14:38:55 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Call management, •, 10m, 4 missed calls,_\n_Ashley Brown (3), Mom]_\n_06/15/2018, 14:38:59 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Call Ashley Big Cousin, Quick contact for_\n_Ashley Brown]_\n_06/15/2018, 14:39:01 EDT|(CLICKED)|[1 804-999-9999, Mobile, Call Ashley Brown]_\n\nResponding to a message looked like this:\n\n_06/15/2018, 16:02:34 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Messaging, •, now, Expand button, (804) 999-_\n_9999, Hey Terry can you send the address, REPLY]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:02:37 EDT|(FOCUSED)|[Aa]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:02:46 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Copy, Forward, Delete]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:02:50 EDT|(FOCUSED)|[]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:02:54 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Messaging]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:02:57 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Enter message]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:05:11 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Answer]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:05:29 EDT|(CLICKED)|[]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:10:50 EDT|(FOCUSED)|[]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:10:52 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Enter]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:11:01 EDT|(FOCUSED)|[2007 Their Address Ct North CityTheyTyped_\n_OK 11111]_\n_06/15/2018, 16:11:03 EDT|(FOCUSED)|[]_\n\nA YouTube session looked like this:\n\n_06/27/2018, 15:23:36 EDT|(CLICKED)|[YouTube]_\n_06/27/2018, 15:23:46 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Pause video]_\n_06/27/2018, 15:41:19 EDT|(FOCUSED)|[14:46, Go to channel, FINDING OUT THE_\n_GENDER!!!, Menu, The Rush Fam · 26K views4 hours ago, 6:12, Go to channel, TRY_\n_NOT TO CRY CHALLENGE REACTION WITH KID (SHE ACTUALLY CRIED), Menu,_\n_CJ SO COOL · 2.5M views · 1 year ago, SUBSCRIBED]_\n_06/27/2018, 15:46:38 EDT|(FOCUSED)|[]_\n_06/27/2018, 15:46:41 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Enter]_\n_06/27/2018, 15:46:53 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Play video]_\n_06/27/2018, 15:48:06 EDT|(CLICKED)|[ · 0:11]_\n_06/27/2018, 15:48:09 EDT|(CLICKED)|[ · 0:09]_\n_06/27/2018, 15:48:10 EDT|(CLICKED)|[ · 0:08]_\n\n\n-----\n\n_06/27/2018, 15:54:30 EDT|(CLICKED)|[Suggested: BREAKING UP IN FRONT OF_\n_COMPANY!!” PRANK ON PANTON SQUAD!!!]_\n\n## Distribution\n\nFrom looking for this malware in various collections, such as Virus Total Intelligence, it seems\nthat the malware is fairly common. Many new versions of the malware show up in their\ncollection every day.  The most common point of distribution seems to be from the Google\nPlay Store.\nA popularly reported stream of such apps was reported on by, well, just about everyone in\nJuly 2018. Some of the headlines included:\n[Anubis Strikes Again: Mobile Malware continues to plague users in Official App Stores –](https://securityintelligence.com/anubis-strikes-again-mobile-malware-continues-to-plague-users-in-official-app-stores/)\nfrom IBM X-Force Research’s Security Intelligence blog\nBest graphic goes to Secure Computing Magazine:\n[BankBot Anubis campaign targets Turkish Android users with fake apps in Google Play store](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/news/malware/bankbot-anubis-campaign-targets-turkish-android-users-with-fake-apps-in-google-play-store/)\n\nhttps://www.scmagazine.com/\n\nMedium.com had “Hackers Distributing Anubis Malware via Google Play Store to Steal Login\ncredentials, E-wallets, and Payment Cards Details”\nA more recent post, from AlienVault, (20 days ago): “Anubis Android Malware in the Play\nStore”\nA search in VirusTotal Intelligence reveals 62 new filehashes ONLY FROM TODAY\n(September 10, 2018) that match a definition name of “Anubis”. Some of the more popular\nnames for the trojan on VirusTotal include:\nDrWeb: Android.BankBot.1679\n\nIkarus: Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Anubis\n\nKaspersky: HEUR:Trojan-Dropper AndroidOS Hqwar bbSophos: Andr/BankSpy-AH\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky authored a special article on this banking trojan, which they call “HQWar” back in\nApril under the headline “Phantom menace: mobile banking trojan modifications reach alltime high: Mobile banking Trojans hit the list of cyber-headaches in Q2 2018”  In that article\nthey said they have documented 61,000 versions!\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky: Phantom Menace\n\nAs I mentioned Lukas at the beginning of this blog, ESET has produced an amazing number\nof articles on Android banking trojans lurking in the Google Play store.
