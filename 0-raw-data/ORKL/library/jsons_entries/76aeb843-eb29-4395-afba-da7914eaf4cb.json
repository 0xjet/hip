AT&T Cybersecurity](https://cybersecurity.att.com/)\n[2. Blog](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs)\n\nJanuary 15, 2020 | [Fernando Martinez](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/author/fmartinez)\nIn 2019, several industry analyst reports confused the threat groups Molerats and APT-C-37\ndue to their similarity, and this has led to some confusion and inaccuracy of attribution.\n\nFor example, both groups target the Middle East and North Africa region (with a special\nemphasis on Palestine territories). And, they both approach victims through the use of\nphishing emails that contain decoy documents (mostly in Arabic) and contain themes\nconcerning the political situation in the area.\n\nTo improve understanding of the differences and similarities of the two groups (as well as the\nlinks between them), we at Alien Labs™ are providing an analysis of their 2019 activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nA [recent spear-phishing document from Molerats](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5c65419951fbf2731768c9d1)\n\n## APT-C-37 Overview\n\n**APT-C-37, also known as Pat-Bear or the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), was first seen in**\nOctober 2015 targeting members of a terrorist organization. Since 2015, however, APT-C-37\nhas broadened their objectives to include government agencies, armed forces leadership,\nmedia organizations, political activists, and diplomats. The group mostly targets victims in\nWestern countries, with the intent of defacing their websites and social accounts while\nleaving a public footprint after hacking one of their victims.\n\nIn previous attacks, APT-C-37 targeted Windows and Android systems, utilizing popular\ncommercial remote access trojans (RATs) such as DroidJack, SpyNote, njRAT, SSLove, and\nH-Worm.\n\n### Technical Analysis: APT-C-37 2019\n\n June 2019: APT-C-37 released an Android app named after the instant messaging software “WhatsApp” as an espionage tool to reportedly spy on the Syrian opposition forces. The app was capable of installing the SSLove RAT to pull private information from the phone and exfiltrating it to a remote location.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Molerats Overview\n\n[Molerats has been present in the cybercriminal landscape since 2012. In an](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html) [analysis](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-group1-operation-sneakypastes/90068/)\nreleased by the Kaspersky’s GReAT (Global Research & Analysis Team) earlier this year on\nthe Gaza Hacker Team and their various subgroups, Kaspersky concluded that Molerats is\nGaza Cybergang “Group1.” The report also concluded that Molerats (i.e. Cybergang Group\n1) operates with a lower level of sophistication than other groups within the Gaza Hacker\n[Team. In addition, a 2016 article in Security Week reported that one of Molerats campaigns](https://www.securityweek.com/users-middle-east-targeted-moonlight-espionage-campaign)\n(October 2016) heavily used popular RATs like NjRat and H-Worm (aka Houdini).\n\n### Technical Analysis: Molerats 2019\n\n**[October 2019: In Molerats’ October operation, the attack was distributed as a phishing](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5da440175f66e58afbdf6cc3)**\ncampaign in the Middle East. Emails included a Microsoft Word file attachment with the title\n“Daily report on the most important Palestinian developments for the day 9-9-2019.doc” —\ncontent that spoke to the political situation in Palestine. When a victim opened the\nattachment, the malware performed the following:\n\nDisplayed the Microsoft Word document as distraction.\nUnpacked a Microsoft.vbs into the folder ‘C:\\programdata\\Micorsoft’ to confuse the\nvictim with a typo inside the folder ‘Micorsoft’.\nProgrammed itself as a scheduled task, once the previous vbs was executed.\nMade an HTTPS request to download GoogleChrome.vbs, which had an additional\nHTTPS request to GoogleChrome.msi. (This file, an additional MSI file and potentially\nthe RAT to infect the system, was not available at the time of the investigation.)\n\nDiagram of Molerats October 2019 campaign\n\n\n-----\n\n**[September-October 2019: In Molerat s September campaign, the malware propagated](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/D40DA0F53F77FC701921D2B4A56248E1)**\nthrough an executable with a fake PDF file. With the names “The case of Muath Ismail\nHaniyeh.pdf.exe” and “Interface.pdf.exe,” the executables are both signed under the name\n“FoxitReader.”\n\nWhen a victim opened the attachment, the malware performed the following:\n\nBoth documents extracted an executable and then a PDF to distract the user.\nThe executable with names FoxitReader.exe or NEG.exe contained a copy of the\nPerseus Trojan (despite both being signed by FoxitReader), which communicated with\nthe command and control (C&C) infrastructure through HTTPS.\n\nDiagram of Molerats September – October 2019 campaign\n\n**[August 2019: In August, Molerats ran another campaign, however we did not detect the use](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/1133dc37e8c7ed23f8041ba18351874df430ae38499a00f5fedc99c92097492e)**\nof phishing. Instead, Alien Labs identified a sample communicating with a new domain that\nused the same C&C pattern detected by an IDS signature. You can find details and more on\nthe [Open Threat Exchange (OTX). The domain, which has been up since 2017, has two](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/1133dc37e8c7ed23f8041ba18351874df430ae38499a00f5fedc99c92097492e)\nmalicious files associated with it:\n\n[The first file matched the same IDS signature. See additional info at OTX.](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/1133dc37e8c7ed23f8041ba18351874df430ae38499a00f5fedc99c92097492e)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second file was first uploaded to VirusTotal back in 2018, but Alien Labs recently\nrescanned the file and found the latest domain (www.freshchrysanthemum[.]com). At\nthe time of the analysis, the C&C was down or filtering the connection. Some of the\nother public sandboxes such Hybrid Analysis and JoeSandbox exhibit the same\nbehavior. An analysis of the sample by Any.run was able to resolve the domain and\n[reach to it with an IP in Norway (82.102.22.109). See additional info at OTX.](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/ADFCF81CBD2E62A55B51EAB24BD86F70)\n\n**[January 2019: In January, Molerats switched its tactics back to phishing with Word](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5c65419951fbf2731768c9d1)**\nDocuments that concealed a malicious Vbscript. The vbs contained an encoded version of\nthe malware, which was scheduled and executed after decryption. The malicious file\ncorresponded to a version of the Fraudrop Trojan, packed with Enigma as previously seen in\nother Molerats’ samples, and it used the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SMFL), which\nis commonly used for game development.\n\nDiagram of Molerats January 2019 campaign\n\n**[November 2019: In November, Alien Labs discovered a new Molerats sample. In this case,](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5c65419951fbf2731768c9d1)**\nthe group recycled the domain used in their January attack for C&C. In this campaign, an\nexecutable with an Arabic name that translates to “Winter government by names,” extracted\nand executed a modified version of the Fraudrop trojan. Molerats had attempted to hide the\npacker they were using and they modified the filename, however the C&C and Beacon they\nused were the same and they were using the SMF library for development.\n\n\n-----\n\nDiagram of Molerats November 2019 campaign\n\n## APT-C-37 vs. Molerats\n\nAPT-C-37 Molerats\n\n\n**Names** Pat-Bear\nSyrian Electronic Army\n\n\nGaza Cybergang\nGaza Hacker Team\nMolerats (Gaza Cybergang Group1)\nDesert Falcons (Gaza Cybergang\nGroup2)\nOperation Parliament (Gaza\nCybergang Group3)\nSneakyPastes (Campaign by\nMolerats)\nDustySky\nMoonlight\n\n\n-----\n\n**Targets** Armed organizations\nIsrael\nEgypt\nOccidental countries\n\n**Timelines** Since October 2015 (as the\nSyrian  Electronic Army, since\n2011)\n\n**Tactics** RATs like DroidJack, SpyNote,\nnjRAT,  or H-Worm.\n\nWindows and Android attacks.\n\nTends to leave public signatures\nfor  everyone to show they\nhacked their victims or leak\nexfiltrated data.\n\n\nMiddle East North Africa region,\nespecially Palestinian territories\n\nSince 2012\n\nPhishing campaigns with MS Word\ndocuments or PDF files with the malware\npacked inside the document or retrieved\nthrough HTTPS.\n\nPersistence is obtained through scheduled\ntasks.\n\nMalware is not a constant and malware is\nheavily rotated, but C&C are sometimes\nrecycled.\n\n\n## Is this a Molerats or APT-C-37 attack?\n\n[The three attacks below have been attributed to APT-C-37 and Molerats, however it’s our](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/anatomy-of-moonLight-attack-on-the-middle-east/)\nopinion at Alien Labs that they don’t share the clear patterns of Molerats or APT-C-37 we’ve\nseen prior to this blog.\n\n**[November 2019 (Palestinian election):](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5dd27af757b18947b0544345)** **[Attributed on Twitter by](https://twitter.com/ccxsaber/status/1191916749630783489)** **Rising Enterprise**\n**Security to APT-C-37**\n\nThis campaign tried to utilize the Palestinian elections as a theme for their phishing emails,\nand the target appeared to be the Palestinian government. We observed the use of phishing\nemails in the campaign with fake documents themed after the elections that contained at\nleast two different malicious files. The file names are (translated here):\n\nElection Committee Meeting - Northern Territory.exe\nMajdalani seriously doubts President Abbas about the presidential election.exe\n\nBoth files used a Microsoft Word icon in attempt to make the victims run the malicious\nexecutable. When executed it performed the following.\n\nExtracted and opened a relevant Word document into the temp folder to lure the target.\n\n\n-----\n\nExtracted a LNK file (a file extension for a shortcut file used by Microsoft Windows to\npoint to an executable file) and used it to achieve persistence in the system. The LNK\nfile was camouflaged under the name “HelpPane.lnk,” so it could execute the next step\nof future campaigns.\nDownloaded a script that included mshta.exe (a utility that executes Microsoft HTML\nApplications), which then downloaded an additional script that included a PowerShell.\nFinally, downloaded and executed a RAT, in particular the popular Houdini RAT (also\nknown as H-worm).\n\nDiagram of [November 2019 attributed on Twitter to APT-C-37](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5dd27af757b18947b0544345)\n\n**[August 2019:](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5dc4b4c2bada09c6a58dd516)** **[Attributed on Twitter to APT-C-37](https://twitter.com/timele9527/status/1166188375109296128?lang=en)**\n\nThis attack, attributed to APT-C-37 on Twitter, is very similar to the November 2019 attack\ndescribed above, however it did not use the Palestinian elections to lure victims. This time,\nthe threat group used another .exe which included a decoy Word document titled “A new\n\n\n-----\n\nscandal for a Hamas leader . The execution was very similar to the November 2019\ncampaign, however this time the camouflaged LNK file was “History.lnk” and it installed a\nversion of Houdini RAT.\n\nDiagram of [August 2019 campaign attributed on Twitter to APT-C-37](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5dc4b4c2bada09c6a58dd516)\n\n**[April 2019:](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5de53f5b1bfee056b62561b5)** **[Attributed on Twitter to APT-C-37](https://twitter.com/HONKONE_K/status/1118035160362913792)**\n\nIn April 2019, security researchers on Twitter [observed another phishing email with an](https://twitter.com/HONKONE_K/status/1118035160362913792)\nattached executable. When executed, the malware opened a document talking about the\nPalestinian Ministers to keep the victim entertained while it installed a LNK file\n“MsOfficee.lnk,” which is very close to the real “MsOffice.lnk.” The file allowed the Houdini\nRAT to execute and gain persistence on the targeted machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nDiagram of **[April 2019 campaign attributed on Twitter to APT-C-37](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5de53f5b1bfee056b62561b5)**\n\nThe three attacks above have the following similar characteristics:\n\nThey used phishing documents themed on Palestine.\n.exe files opened relevant documents in Arabic.\nThe first step executed mshta.exe.\nThey obtained persistence in the victim’s systems through LNK files with decoy names.\nThey used Timeout.exe to pause execution for different times before executing the\nRAT.\nC&C communication went through HTTP.\nThey executed the Houdini RAT\n\n\n-----\n\nThe above-mentioned target and the delivery methods suggest these attacks are being\nlaunched by Molerats (note: the Houdini RAT is very popular in the Middle East and cannot\nbe used for attribution). However, in the opinion of Alien Labs, the other attack patterns make\nit hard for us to tie these attacks to Molerats or APT-C-37, as they do not have a clear\npattern that aligns to the samples previously associated with Molerats or APT-C-37. In light\nof this, Alien Labs currently buckets these three attacks under an unattributed classification.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYes, indeed, we have seen similar patterns between Molerats and APT-C-37 in 2019.\nHowever, Molerats has shown to be a more active group (even beyond 2019), with a more\nadvanced tradecraft and methods that are more difficult to defend against due to the use of\nHTTPS, high rotation of malware, or even IP filtering to specific geolocations. Therefore, we\ndo not have a high level of confidence that the latest samples belong to any of these two\ngroups or have a relationship at this time. Having said this, we offer a caveat: of the samples\nwe analyzed, we left three unattributed for the moment. Through future analysis, we may find\nthat these do fall under either Molerats or APT-C-37. If that happens, we’ll keep you updated\nin OTX.\n\n### Share this with others\n\nTags: [malware,](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/tag/malware) [malware research,](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/tag/malware+research) [alien labs,](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/tag/alien+labs) [molerats,](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/tag/molerats) [apt-c-37](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/tag/apt-c-37)\n\n\n-----",
