(We\nwrote about it last week.) KitM stands for \"Kumar in the Mac\", which is our designation\nfor spyware — related to OSX/Filesteal a.k.a. OSX/HackBack — that is signed using an\nApple Developer ID in the name of Rajinder Kumar. The Developer ID has since been\nrevoked by Apple.\n\nThis latest version of OSX/KitM used a Romanian C&C server called liveapple.eu during\nthe period of attack, December 2012 to early February 2013. The spear phishing used\nan attachment called Christmas_Card.app.zip. (Remember, the attack started in\nDecember.)\n\nSo, that brings us to this bit of advice for those of you who might be targets.\n\nThis is the default \"Gatekeeper\" security setting:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mac App Store and identified developers_\n\nThis is the setting that you want, unless you're actively installing software:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mac App Store_\n\nThis is the prompt that results when OSX/KitM attempts to install with the stricter setting:\n\nIf you're running OS X Mountain Lion or Lion v10.7.5 — adjust your settings as an extra\nlayer of precaution.\n\nSHA1: 290898b23a85bcd7747589d6f072a844e11eec65\n\n\n-----",
