Moving further the malware gather system details, scans for security**\ntools running in the device and then send the hard coded C2 address.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Complete capabilities of Purple Fox malware\n\nAfter this process, Purple Fox is downloaded from the C2 in the form of an .msi file that has\nencrypted shellcode for both 64- and 32- bit systems. Once the Purple Fox is executed, the\ncompromised devices are restarted for the registry settings to work, especially the disabled User\nAccount Control (UAC).\n\nTo achieve this, the dll.dll file sets the following three registry keys to 0:\n\n1. HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\n\nConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin\n2. HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\EnableLUA\n3. HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\PromptOnSecureDesktop\n\n[Disabling bypassing UAC is vital because it deploys viruses and malware with administrator](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bypassing-windows-10-uac-with-mock-folders-and-dll-hijacking/)\nprivileges. In general, UAC prevents the installation of unauthorized apps and the change of system\nsettings, to be active on all Windows devices.\n\nWhen disabled Purple Fox will perform malicious functions like searching of file, exfiltration, deletion\nof data, process killing, downloading and running code. and even worming to other Windows\ndevices. Malware similar to Purple Fox are actively being distributed via Youtube Videos, malicious\nwebsites, and other forum sites.\n\n[Subscribe to our newsletter for daily alerts on cyber events, you can also follow us on Facebook,](https://www.facebook.com/thecybersecurittytimes/)\n[Linkedin,](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-cybersecurity-times/) [Instagram,](https://www.instagram.com/the_cybersecurity_times/) [Twitter and](https://twitter.com/the_cybertimes) [Reddit.
