Unit 42 also tracks the APT3 group using the name UPS, which\nis an intrusion set with Chinese origins that is known for having early access to zero-day vulnerabilities and delivering a\nbackdoor called Pirpi.\n\nThe UPS group has exploited several zero-day vulnerabilities, most recently using the zero-days released in the Hacking\nTeam breach that we discussed in our July 10 blog post, “APT Group UPS Targets US Government with Hacking Team\nFlash Exploit”. However, the most recent original zero-day released by this group is tracked by CVE-2015-3113, which has\n[similarities to the once zero-day vulnerabilities CVE-2014-1776 and CVE-2014-6332 exploited by UPS in May and](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/11/addressing-cve-2014-6332-swf-exploit/)\nNovember 2014, respectively. We’ll discuss here the similarities observed between the various components used to exploit\nthese two vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on the malicious Flash files and the payloads delivered.\n\n## Malicious Flash Files\n\nRecent zero-day vulnerabilities exploited by UPS exploit or leverage Adobe Flash to exploit other applications on the system.\n[Unit 42 recently analyzed malicious Flash files that exploited CVE-2015-3113, which was a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-14.html)\nFlash that was patched on June 23, 2015. During the analysis, we noticed similarities between this malicious Flash file,.\n[those that UPS used to exploit CVE-2014-1776, and the proof-of-concept code for CVE-2014-6332, albeit these two Flash](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/11/addressing-cve-2014-6332-swf-exploit/)\nfiles were used to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.\n\n**Overlaps within ActionScript**\n\nUnit 42 analyzed the ActionScript within malicious Flash files created by UPS that exploited CVE-2014-1776 and CVE-20153113 and discovered shared code between the two. First, both ActionScripts contain a function named “hexToIntArray”,\nwhich Figure 1 displays side-by-side for comparison. Not only do these files contain the same function name, but they also\nshare the same exact operation codes (opcodes) to carry out its functionality. The existence of the hexToIntArray function in\nthe CVE-2015-3113 sample is rather interesting, as it is never called or used within the ActionScript. We believe that the\nthreat actor used the CVE-2014-1776 ActionScript as the basis for the CVE-2015-3113 file and forgot to remove the unused\nhexToIntArray function.\n\n**CVE-2014-1776** **CVE-2015-3113**\n\n\n-----\n\nfunction\nprivate::hexToIntArray(String):__AS3__.vec::Vector.<int>\n\n{\n0  getlocal0\n\n1  pushscope\n\n2  pushnull\n\n3  coerce_a\n\n4  setlocal2\n\n5  getlocal1\n\n6  getproperty   length\n\n8  coerce_a\n\n9  setlocal3\n\n10  pushbyte    0\n\n12  coerce_a\n\n13  setlocal    4\n\n15  getlex     Vector\n\n17  getlex     int\n\n19  applytype    (1)\n\n21  getlocal3\n\n22  pushbyte    2\n\n24  divide\n\n25  construct    (1)\n\n27  coerce     __AS3__.vec::Vector.<int>\n\n29  setlocal    5\n\n31  pushbyte    0\n\n33  coerce_a\n\n34  setlocal    6\n\n36  jump      L1L2:\n\n40  label\n\n41  getlocal1\n\n42  getlocal    4\n\n44  callproperty\nhttp://adobe.com/AS3/2006/builtin::charAt (1)\n\n47  getlocal1\n\n48  getlocal    4\n\n50  pushbyte    1\n\n52  add\n\n53  callproperty\nhttp://adobe.com/AS3/2006/builtin::charAt (1)\n\n56  add\n\n57  coerce_a\n\n58  setlocal2\n\n59  getlocal    5\n\n61  getlocal    6\n\n63  findpropstrict parseInt\n\n65  getlocal2\n\n66  pushbyte    16\n\n68  callproperty  parseInt (2)\n\n71  setproperty   null\n\n73  getlocal    4\n\n75  pushbyte    2\n\n77  add\n\n78  coerce_a\n\n79  setlocal    4\n\n81  getlocal    6\n\n83  pushbyte    1\n\n85  add\n\n86  coerce_a\n\n87  setlocal    6L1:\n\n89  getlocal    4\n\n91  getlocal3\n\n92  iflt      L2\n96  getlocal    5\n\n98  returnvalue\n\n}\n\n\nfunction\nprivate::hexToIntArray(String):__AS3__.vec::Vector.<int>\n\n{\n0  getlocal0\n\n1  pushscope\n\n2  pushnull\n\n3  coerce_a\n\n4  setlocal2\n\n5  getlocal1\n\n6  getproperty   length\n\n8  coerce_a\n\n9  setlocal3\n\n10  pushbyte    0\n\n12  coerce_a\n\n13  setlocal    4\n\n15  getlex     Vector\n\n17  getlex     int\n\n19  applytype    (1)\n\n21  getlocal3\n\n22  pushbyte    2\n\n24  divide\n\n25  construct    (1)\n\n27  coerce     __AS3__.vec::Vector.<int>\n\n29  setlocal    5\n\n31  pushbyte    0\n\n33  coerce_a\n\n34  setlocal    6\n\n36  jump      L1L2:\n\n40  label\n\n41  getlocal1\n\n42  getlocal    4\n\n44  callproperty\nhttp://adobe.com/AS3/2006/builtin::charAt (1)\n\n47  getlocal1\n\n48  getlocal    4\n\n50  pushbyte    1\n\n52  add\n\n53  callproperty\nhttp://adobe.com/AS3/2006/builtin::charAt (1)\n\n56  add\n\n57  coerce_a\n\n58  setlocal2\n\n59  getlocal    5\n\n61  getlocal    6\n\n63  findpropstrict parseInt\n\n65  getlocal2\n\n66  pushbyte    16\n\n68  callproperty  parseInt (2)\n\n71  setproperty   null\n\n73  getlocal    4\n\n75  pushbyte    2\n\n77  add\n\n78  coerce_a\n\n79  setlocal    4\n\n81  getlocal    6\n\n83  pushbyte    1\n\n85  add\n\n86  coerce_a\n\n87  setlocal    6L1:\n\n89  getlocal    4\n\n91  getlocal3\n\n92  iflt      L2\n96  getlocal    5\n\n98  returnvalue\n\n}\n\n\nFigure 1 Side-by-side comparison of opcodes in hexToIntArray functions\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso, the Flash file exploiting CVE 2015 3113 had a main class named flappyMan . This class name was also used in the\nFlash file that Unit 42 analyzed and discussed in its November 26, 2014 blog titled “Addressing CVE-2014-6332 SWF\n[Exploit”, as well as the proof-of-concept (PoC) for CVE-2014-6332 that is now publicly available in exploit-related forums.](https://rstforums.com/forum/92300-exploit-swf-cve-2014-6332-a.rst)\n[According to FireEye's \"Operation Double Tap\", UPS exploited CVE-2014-6332 in its November 2014 attacks; however, UPS](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/11/operation_doubletap.html)\nused a VBScript to exploit the vulnerability instead of a Flash file. While purely speculation, this overlap in class names\nbetween the CVE-2014-6332 PoC and the Flash file exploiting CVE-2015-3113 may suggest that UPS also used Flash files\nto exploit CVE-2014-6332.\n\n## Shellcode Similarities\n\nAs with most remote code execution vulnerabilities, UPS’ malicious documents execute shellcode in the event of successful\nexploitation of either CVE-2014-1776 or CVE-2015-3113. The shellcode found in the UPS delivery documents exploiting\nboth of these vulnerabilities are not the same, but have similarities worth noting.\n\nFirst, the delivery documents share the same technique of locating API functions, which involves using the rotate right (ror 7\nto be specific) instruction on the function name in kernel32.dll and checking it with a specific value. The use of the same\nrotate right algorithm results in several common constants, such as 0xC917432 that both shellcodes use to locate\nLoadLibraryA. Second, both shellcodes use a similar method of creating the Unicode string “kernel32.dll”, seen in Figure 2.\nThe shellcodes use the Unicode string and the same method to find the base address of the loaded kernel32.dll module from\nthe LDR structures obtained from the process environment block (PEB). Third, both shellcodes have similar single byte XOR\nalgorithms used to decrypt and later execute the functional payload.\n\nFigure 2. Comparison of Instructions in UPS Shellcodes that Builds Kernel32.dll Unicode String\n\n## Steganography to Conceal Payloads\n\nWhile analyzing the malicious Flash file exploiting CVE-2015-3113, Unit 42 discovered that the ActionScript loaded an\nanimated GIF image. The malware author used steganography to embed an encrypted payload within this animated GIF\nimage. The payload in the CVE-2014-1776 was also embedded within an animated GIF. Ultimately, the shellcode executed\nin the event of successful exploitation of either of these vulnerabilities decrypt and execute the embedded payload, as\nmentioned in the previous section. While the animated GIFs themselves are vastly different, as seen in Figure 3 and 4\n(payloads removed), the use of steganography and animated images as the carrier of the payload is common between the\ntwo campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Animated GIF “v.gif” from UPS Campaign Exploiting CVE-2015-3113 (click to see .gif)\n\nFigure 4. Animated GIF “anyway.gif” from UPS Campaign Exploiting CVE-2014-1776\n\n## Payload Comparison\n\nWith the amount of overlap between the other components in these separate campaigns, we decided to compare the Pirpi\npayloads delivered by the UPS group using CVE-2014-1776 and CVE-2015-3113. From here on, we will refer to these two\npayloads as Pirpi.2014 (CVE-2014-1776) and Pirpi.2015 (CVE-2015-3113), whose details are listed in Table 1. Unit 42\ndiscovered several similarities between the two Pirpi variants, as well as a few equally important differences, both of which\nare worth discussing. We also compared the Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015 payloads to other known Pirpi samples in an attempt\nto determine which variant they most closely resemble.\n\n\n**File Name** **File**\n**Type**\n\n**MD5** **Compile**\n**Time**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n\n**Architecture** **Size**\n\n\nIePorxyv.dll (Pirpi.2014) PE.DLL X86 86016\n\nB48E578F030A7B5BB93A3E9D6D1E2A83 04:29:14\n00:44:04\n\n81BD203EF3924BF497E8824ED5F224561487258FF3D8EE55F1E0907155FD5333\n\n{CVE-2015-3113 payload} (Pirpi.2015) PE.DLL X86 150528\n\n1B0E6BA299A522A3B3B02015A3536F6F 06:07:15\n01:51:27\n\n0649A3DD632CDE57BC2E97B814BE81A7F45454FED2A73800DE476AA75CDBE8CD\n\nTable 1. File Details of Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015 Samples\n\n\n-----\n\n**Similarities in C2 Communications**\n\nBoth Pirpi variants perform an initial check to see if a configuration file exists at %APPDATA%\\vcl.tmp or %TEMP%\\vcl.tmp\ndepending on the operating system. If it finds one, it decodes it and uses the configuration data it finds inside for C2\ncommunication, otherwise it uses hardcoded C2 domains encoded inside the binary. The malware then creates threads to\nbegin C2 communication.\n\nThe Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015 payloads communicate with their C2 by issuing HTTP GET requests to the C2 domain\nhardcoded inside the payload or within its “vcl.tmp” configuration file. While the structure of the C2 URL differs between the\ntwo variants, both use the HTTP Cookie field to transmit data in encrypted form to the C2 domain. Figure 6 shows examples\nof C2 communications from Pirpi.2014 and Figure 7 shows communication with the C2 of Pirpi.2015 malware variants, both\ncontaining data within the Cookie field.\n\nFigure 5. Pirpi.2014 C2 Communication using Cookie Field for Exfiltration\n\nFigure 6. Pirpi.2015 C2 Communication using Cookie Field for Exfiltration\n\nThe GET request will return a web page that the malware will parse, specifically looking for encoded commands within two of\nthe HTML tags.\n\n**Command Loop Overlap**\n\nOnce the two Pirpi variants successfully communicate with their C2 server and parse the returned HTML for commands,\nPirpi enters a command loop that processes the commands and carries out the respective activities. The command loop for\nthe backdoor remains largely unchanged between Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015 with only two of the commands differing\nbetween the two. Table 2 shows the commands that each malware can accept with only the 35 and 36 commands differing\nbetween the two Pirpi variants.\n\n**Value** **Pirpi.2014 Command** **Pirpi.2015 Command**\n\n1 Launch Process\n\n2 Process Listing\n\n3 Terminate Process\n\n4 Download a file from the C2, launch it, and then delete it\n\n5 Exit the malware\n\n6 Sleep\n\n7 Update C2 configuration and save it to %APPDATA%\\vcl.tmp\n\n8 Download a file, load it into memory, then delete the file\n\n\n-----\n\n9 Load a DLL from %APPDATA% and execute one of its exported functions\n\n10 Do nothing\n\n11 Do nothing\n\n12 List all servers in the domain\n\n13 Get network adaptor information\n\n14 List TCP connection status (netstat)\n\n15 Retrieve information about connected users\n\n16 List servers in the primary domain\n\n17 Locates DCs on a domain\n\n32 Directory listing\n\n33 Upload a file to the C2\n\n34 Delete file\n\n35 Copy file and delete original Copy file\n\n36 Download and save file Do Nothing\n\n37 Echo\n\n38 Execute Process\n\n49 Get location of configuration file and set as current working directory\n\nTable 2. Commands Available within Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015\n\n**Anti-Disassembly**\n\nThe UPS threat group is a fan of one anti-disassembly trick that can be seen in both Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015. It plays upon\nthe order IDA Pro disassembles instructions. As you can see in the code sample in Figure 6 from Pirpi.2014 there is a “jump\nabove” instruction, followed by a “jump below or equal” instruction which just falls through to the next instruction. This fallthrough code path will never get executed since the jump occurs if 0x58693C96 > 0x0D7F31B4.\n\nFigure 7. Code Showing Anti-Disassembly Technique used in Pirpi Tool\n\nIDA Pro’s disassembly sequence follows the fall-through branch of conditional jumps first, and thus in the previous\ninstruction sequence, IDA keeps disassembling one instruction after another. When IDA goes back to disassemble the jump\ntarget for 0x10009133, it finds it pointing to the middle of an instruction. This stops IDA from being able to draw function\nborders, view a function in graph mode, or decompile with Hex-Rays. To solve this, undefine all of the code that will not be\nexecuted, and define code starting from the target of the conditional branch (in this case 0x1000913E), as seen in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Fixing Anti Disassembly Trick used by Pirpi Tool by Undefining Errant Instructions\n\nYou will now be able to create a function to improve your ability to do analysis. To make this easier, use an [IDA Pro script to](https://github.com/pan-unit42/public_tools/blob/master/ida_scripts/pirpi_anti_disassembly.py)\nfix these anti-disassembly tricks. Please note that this script specifically targets the anti-disassembly used in Pirpi and other\nUPS samples. It may cause issues with malware that uses other anti-disassembly tricks. Use with caution.\n\n**Notable Differences**\n\nThe first major difference between the Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015 variants is in the way the command loop is executed in\neach backdoor. In Pirpi.2014, the malware uses a simple state machine that executes code blocks that correspond to a state\nvalue, which the malware updates at the end of each code block. Many of these code blocks include sleep functions,\nhowever, if the state value is set to the correct value, the malware executes a code block that contains the command loop.\nThe purpose of this state machine is to intentionally delay the malware’s execution of the command loop.\n\nIn Pirpi.2015, the malware implements a second state machine that executes the Pirpi.2014 state machine as one of its code\nblocks. The second state machine introduces a large number of randomized sleep functions, causing the malware to take\nmuch longer to execute its command loop. The majority of code blocks in the second state machine either sleep, or create\nthreads and wait for them to finish. The malware author likely implemented these state machines as an anti-debugging\ntechnique and to defeat most modern sandbox solutions.\n\nThe second difference between the two Pirpi variants involves the encoding algorithm, which has improved greatly in the\npast year. Contained in the binary is an invertible math function for encoding and decoding of data. In Pirpi.2014 this function\nis rather simple, involving a few mathematical operations. However, in Pirpi.2015, the algorithm when decompiled is more\nthan 300 source code lines of mathematical operations.\n\n**Other Pirpi Samples**\n\nFireEye released two reports in 2014 about APT3 phishing campaigns, Operation Doubletap and Operation Clandestine\nFox. Each report containins md5s of other Pirpi samples that were available on VirusTotal. In addition, simple VirusTotal\nsearches resulted in a few more Pirpi samples that came from the same code base. Table 3 contains the file information for\neach of these Pirpi samples.\n\n\n**File Name** **File**\n**Type**\n\n**MD5** **Compile**\n**Time**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n\n**Architecture** **Size**\n\n\n{FireEye Report Sample} PE.EXE X86 102400\n\n8849538EF1C3471640230605C2623C67 09:25:14\n09:09:59\n\n854C6BA97B4BD01246AC6EF9258135D2337E6938676421131B6793ABF339FA94\n\nmsupd.dll PE.DLL X86 81920\n\nFA3578C2ABE3F37DDDA76EE40C5A1608 09:10:14\n04:54:09\n\nCE7ACAE4CDB53C2FB526624855FC8E008608343B177DF348657295578312EB49\n\nieupd.dll PE.DLL X86 86016\n\n1A4B710621EF2E69B1F7790AE9B7A288 05:27:14\n08:48:13\n\n12AE4A7072C95EAE0E433570B1D563C3D39FE3239816C04426C8E64A49BBE7D7\n\nIePorxyv.dll PE.DLL X86 86016\n\n\n-----\n\nF4884C0458176AAC848A911683D3DEF5 04:29:14\n00:45:45\n\n8C64D673CB84F76124FDBDC76941396647FF03725BDDD1D59D0CD32D8EBAD81F\n\nIePorxyv.dll PE.DLL X86 81920\n\n4CA97FF9D72B422589266AA7B532D6E6 04:29:14\n00:32:43\n\n4F677060D25A5E448BE986759FED5A325CD83F64D9FEF13FB51B18D1D0EB0F52\n\nTable 3.

Resulting Similarity and Confidence Rates of Pirpi Samples\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe UPS threat group continues to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in their campaigns, which shows that this group is quite\nsophisticated and has access to significant resources. Within their attack campaigns involving zero-days, UPS has\nconsistently reused delivery techniques and code within various components of the attack. UPS has relied on steganography\nto conceal the payloads delivered after exploitation of zero-days by embedding payloads, specifically the Pirpi backdoor\nwithin animated GIFs. This group also reuses portions of their ActionScript within their malicious Flash files used to exploit\nvulnerabilities, as well as sharing portions of shellcode that executes after exploitation.\n\nIn regards to similarities amongst payloads, UPS delivers variants of the Pirpi backdoor that are typically very similar to each\nother. The Pirpi backdoors we analyzed use the same configuration file, a common C2 communications channel and a\nsimilar command handler. Also, the author of Pirpi includes several notable fingerprints within the code, specifically using a\nunique state machine and anti-disassembly techniques.
