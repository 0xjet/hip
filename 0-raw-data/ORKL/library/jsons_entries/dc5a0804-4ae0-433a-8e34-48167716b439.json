The arrests were\n[also made possible with the help of private-public sector partnerships, which include Trend](https://therecord.media/frances-lead-cybercrime-investigator-on-the-egregor-arrests-cybercrime/)\nMicro.\n\n## About Egregor ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\n[Since its first appearance in September 2020, Egregor ransomware has been involved in](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/egregor-ransomware-launches-string-of-high-profile-attacks-to-en.html)\n[high-profile attacks against retailers,](https://threatpost.com/kmart-egregor-ransomware/161881/) [human resource service companies, and other](https://www.securityweek.com/hr-giant-randstad-hit-egregor-ransomware)\n[organizations. It operated under the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model where groups](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/ransomware-as-a-service-raas-threats/#:~:text=What%20is%20Ransomware%20as%20a,them%20to%20perform%20an%20attack.)\nsell or lease ransomware variants to affiliates, making it relatively easier even for\ninexperienced cybercriminals to launch attacks. Like some prominent ransomware variants,\nEgregor employs a “double extortion” technique where the operators threaten affected users\nwith both the loss and public exposure of the encrypted data.\n\n[The ransomware is typically distributed as a secondary payload to remote access trojans](https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2020/cc-3681)\nsuch as [QAKBOT. It also](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/qakbot) [spreads through phishing emails with malicious attachments or via](https://threatpost.com/fbi-egregor-attacks-businesses-worldwide/162885/)\nremote desktop protocol (RDP) or VPN exploits.\n\n## Further details on the arrests\n\nFrench law enforcement initiated the investigation on the Egregor operators after the latter\n[launched attacks on several France-based companies for logistics,](https://threatpost.com/egregor-ransomware-mass-media-corporate-data/159816/) [newspaper publication,](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/police-arrest-egregor-ransomware/)\n[and video game development. The three suspects were arrested after French authorities](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ubisoft-crytek-data-posted-on-ransomware-gangs-site/)\ntracked them down with the help of Ukrainian authorities. The names and the exact\ndesignations of the arrestees have not been released.\n\n[In an email interview with The Record about the incident, François B., the Head of the](https://therecord.media/frances-lead-cybercrime-investigator-on-the-egregor-arrests-cybercrime/)\nComputer Security Incident Response Team for the French Judicial Police (CSIRT-PJ), cited\npartnerships with cybersecurity and incident response companies including Trend Micro. He\nnoted that these organizations help in active investigations as they “provide us with the most\naccurate information on an ongoing case, tools, or threat intelligence data.”\n\n## Protecting systems against ransomware\n\nRansomware is a persistent security problem that unceasingly and rapidly evolves into an\neven more destructive threat. To protect systems from ransomware, users are advised to\nfollow these best practices:\n\nAvoid downloading attachments and clicking on links in emails from unverified sources.\nRegularly patch and update operating systems, programs, and software.\n[Periodically back-up files by observing the 3-2-1 rule: Create at least three copies of](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/best-practices-backing-up-data)\nthe data, store it in two different formats, and keep at least one duplicate offsite.\n\n[Security solutions such as Trend Micro XDRTM](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response/xdr.html) also offer protection across different\ncomponents of the system, including email, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and\nnetworks. By collecting and correlating data in all these layers, security and IT teams gain a\nbetter context of attacks that otherwise may seem insignificant on their own. This allows\nfaster and more accurate detections.\n\n\n-----",
