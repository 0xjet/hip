The group has](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037/)\ncompromised multiple point-of-sale (POS) environments using the [TRINITY POS (aka FrameworkPOS)](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/pos-malware-variants/frameworkpos)\nmalware. In September 2017, forensic investigations of several undisclosed entities revealed evidence that\nFIN6 actors changed to target card-not-present (CNP) data when they could not deploy their malware in\nthe POS environment. Evidence shows that FIN6 injected malicious code into the merchants’ eCommerce\nenvironment, placing skimming malware on the victims’ checkout pages. Based on Visa Payment Fraud\n**Disruption’s (PFD) analysis of eCommerce compromises throughout 2018, FIN6’s focus on the CNP**\n**environment has only amplified, suggesting that the cybercrime group has fully incorporated**\n**targeting CNP environments into their criminal methodology.**\n\nThe majority of eCommerce compromises reported in 2018 involved direct targeting of vulnerabilities\nwithin the eCommerce website itself. As one of the more sophisticated groups targeting eCommerce\nmerchants, FIN6 brings their POS compromise approach to the emerging threat landscape of CNP\nbreaches. FIN6 targets companies, using phishing emails in an attempt to infect the targeted victim’s\nnetwork. The actors then move through the network to identify POS and eCommerce environments. PFD\nassesses that the increased focus of a sophisticated cybercrime group, such as FIN6, on eCommerce\nenvironments is a broader representation of the overall cybercriminal focus on the CNP space.\n\n### Recent Activities\n\nAt the end of 2018, Visa Payment Intelligence analysts discovered that FIN6 actors targeted multiple high\nvalue eCommerce merchants with malicious documents that contained links to a malicious server that\nallowed the execution of PowerShell scripts, granting the attackers direct access to the merchants’\nnetworks. The PowerShell scripts were only present in memory, and did not download additional files to\nthe user’s machine, making it difficult for the victim to detect. The FIN6 actors were able to utilize this\naccess to move through the merchant’s networks to access the eCommerce environment, and specifically\nthe payment servers. A full investigation of these compromises show that the FIN6 actors specifically\ntargeted the eCommerce networks and did not exploit them opportunistically.\n\n\n-----\n\nVisa Public\nVisa Payment Fraud Disruption\n\n\n## Figure 1 - FIN6 eCommerce Attack Flow\n\n\n### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)\n\n Initial Compromise\nFIN6 employs a multitude of tactics within the initial phase of their operations. In the most recent\ncompromises attributed to FIN6, forensic investigators identified the use of malicious documents to infect\nvictims with malware known as More_Eggs (aka Terra Loader) that is used to launch malicious scripts on\nthe infected machine.\n\n### Maintain Access\nFIN6 establishes a foothold within a victim’s environment by leveraging various payloads, such as\n[components of the Metasploit Framework](https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/) (e.g., Meterpreter, JSPSPY and CmdSQL), or through a\n\n\n-----\n\nVisa Public\nVisa Payment Fraud Disruption\n\n[specialized version of the AMMYY remote administration tool (RAT) known as FlawedAmmyy. In the most](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/retail-threats-formjacking-pos)\nrecent cases, attackers then establish persistent access to the victim’s network using [Meterpreter related](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/payload/windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp)\n[code, allowing the attackers to maintain a remote connection to the infected system.](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/payload/windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp)\n\n### Internal Reconnaissance\nFIN6 uses legitimate publicly available tools to map the internal network and conduct reconnaissance.\nDuring the reconnaissance phase, the actors gather information on systems running SQL Database Server\ninstances and dump schemas for multiple databases and SQL user accounts. The actors also target\nnetwork credentials using a malware family known as Stealer One (see below in the section Technical\n_Analysis and Indicators of Compromise). Additionally, FIN6 employs legitimate administrative tools, such as:_\n\n### • Microsoft's built-in SQL querying tool (osql.exe)\n • Query Express (a free, portable graphical SQL client)\n • AdFind (a free command-line tool for querying Active Directory) \n • ProcDump (a Microsoft SysInternals command-line utility used to perform analysis of running processes).\n\n Escalate Privileges\nOnce FIN6’s accesses are established with preferred backdoors, they use additional public utilities, such as\nWindows Credentials Editor and Metasploit-related tools, for privilege escalation and credential harvesting.\n\n### Move Laterally/Maintain Presence\nCapitalizing on data acquired via internal reconnaissance, FIN6 relies on credentials stolen from various\nsystems (e.g. usernames and password hashes) for lateral movement. Investigations show that FIN6 relies\non PowerShell scripts and Meterpreter based shells to maintain access to and move laterally through the\nnetwork (see below in the section Technical Analysis and Indicators of Compromise).\n\n\n-----\n\nVisa Public\nVisa Payment Fraud Disruption\n\n### Technical Analysis and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n Malicious Files – Stealer One\n_Stealer One is a credential stealer, first observed by industry forensic investigators in March 2017.

Visit the Payment Card Industry Security Standards\n[Council (PCI SSC) website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) for more information.\n\n  - **Regularly scan and test eCommerce sites for vulnerabilities or malware. Hire a trusted**\nprofessional or service provider with a reputation of security to secure the eCommerce\nenvironment. Ask questions and require a report of what was done. Trust, but verify the steps\ntaken by the company you hire.\n\n  - **[Consider using a fully-hosted checkout solution where customers enter their payment details](https://www.cardinalcommerce.com/startups/online-payments/what-is-hosted-checkout)**\non another webpage hosted by that checkout solution, separate from the merchant’s site. This is\nthe most secure way to protect the merchant and their customers from eCommerce skimming\nmalware. Hosted checkout forms embedded inline on the merchant’s checkout page, such as [Visa](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/payment-technology/visa-checkout.html)\n### Checkout, are another secure option.\n\n  - **Use a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) validated third-party service**\n**provider to store, process or transmit cardholder data. Criminals commonly target merchant**\nwebsites that process payment data. When merchants use a validated and secure service provider,\nrisk exposure for CNP fraud and compromise decreases. A list of validated, registered service\n[providers is available on the Global Registry of Service Providers.](https://www.visa.com/splisting/)\n\n  - **Comply consistently with industry security standards,** [such as the Payment Card Industry Data](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/best_practices_securing_ecommerce.pdf)\n[Security Standard (PCI DSS), including the PCI Best Practices for Securing e-Commerce, January](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/best_practices_securing_ecommerce.pdf)\n### 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\nVisa Public\nVisa Payment Fraud Disruption\n\n  - **[Set up a Web Application Firewall to block suspicious and malicious requests from reaching the](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Web_Application_Firewall)**\nwebsite. There are options that are free, simple to use, and practical for small merchants.\n\n  - **Limit access to the administrative portal and accounts to those who need them.**\n\n  - **Require strong administrative passwords (use a password manager for best results) and enable**\ntwo-factor authentication.\n\n  - **Regularly ensure shopping cart, other services, and all software are upgraded or patched to**\nthe latest versions to keep attackers out.\n\n  - **Monitor for suspicious activity—create and regularly check logs and receive alerts if changes to**\nthe site are made.\n\n  - **Ensure staff are trained in security best practices and follow the designated procedures.**\n\nIf a merchant suspects a compromise, they should contact their acquiring bank immediately for guidance\non next steps and to ensure compliance with all Visa investigation and compliance guidelines.
