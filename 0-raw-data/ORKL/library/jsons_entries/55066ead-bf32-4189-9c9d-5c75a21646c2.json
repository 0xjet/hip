Of special interest are the files where few or only we have detection,\n\nbecause there is a higher probability that such files are false positives that need to be removed. However,\n\nyesterday I found an interesting file.\n\nFirts of all, it was relatively clear that it was no false positive, since sandbox and live systems confirmed\n\nthat it installed using the file name svcshost.exe. It was obviously mimicking the legitimate program\n\nsvchost.exe, which is a pretty telling hint.\n\nLooking at the file revealed out-of-the ordinary traits. It was over 750k in size, and this is somewhat\n\nunusual for trojans. It was not packed or obfuscated, so by just looking at the file image some strings\n\njumped out:\n\nThe lowermost of these URL’s appears to be a webmail front for the Palestinian National Authority. The\n\nlist shown is used as input to a function that has as purpose to grab user credentials from IntelliForms.\n\nIntelliForms is the name for the autocomplete function that exists in Internet Explorer. The full list of\n\ntargeted sites is:\n\n“https://login.live.com/”\n\n“http://facebook.com/”\n\n“http://www.facebook.com/”\n\n“http://hotmail.com/”\n\n“http://gmail.com/”\n\n“http://mail.google.com/”\n\n“https://portal.iugaza.edu.ps/”\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://www.google.com/accounts/\n\n“http://www.fatehforums.com/”\n\n“http://portal.iugaza.edu.ps/”\n\n“https://login.yahoo.com/config/login”\n\n“https://login.yahoo.com/”\n\n“https://www.google.com/accounts/service”\n\n“https://my.screenname.aol.com/_cqr/login.psp”\n\n“http://myaccount.jawwal.ps/”\n\n“http://www.myspace.com”\n\n“http://paypal.com”\n\n“http://moneybookers.com”\n\n“http://mail.mtit.pna.ps/src/login.php”\n\nDigging further into the origin of this file, I find that it is dropped by a WinRAR SFX installer which also\n\nextracts and shows the document below (excerpt):\n\nThe full text seems to be taken from an article in the Palestinian newspaper Al-Sabah (Google translated):\n\n[www.alsbah.net.](https://web.archive.org/web/20130308090454/http://translate.google.no/translate?hl=no&sl=ar&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alsbah.net%2Fnew1%2Fmodules.php%3Fname%3DNews%26file%3Dprint%26sid%3D5946)\n\nThe document, aylol.doc, contains very little metadata, so we are not talking about complete newbies in\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are apparently at least two versions of this trojan around. Norman Sandbox technology detected\n\nthese proactively as W32/Malware, but they will be renamed to Palebot.A!apt and B!apt.\n\nThe trojan is still in analysis, and further details may be published later.\n\nMD5′s of samples:\n\n7f3b74c9274f501bf0d9ded414b62f80\n\n25f758425fcea95ea07488e13f07e005\n\n1954622c1fe142200ad06eec12291fcd (RAR SFX).\n\n\n-----",
