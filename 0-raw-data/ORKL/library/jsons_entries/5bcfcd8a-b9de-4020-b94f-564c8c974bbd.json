The group is responsible for many high profile attacks in the past and has gained\nworldwide attention. The Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence team is actively monitoring its\n[activities and was able to spot a new campaign on Jan 18th 2022.](https://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1483521532433473536)\n\nIn this campaign, Lazarus conducted spear phishing attacks weaponized with malicious\n[documents that use their known job opportunities theme. We identified two decoy documents](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dream-Job-Campaign.pdf)\nmasquerading as American global security and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin.\n\nIn this blog post, we provide technical analysis of this latest attack including a clever use of\nWindows Update to execute the malicious payload and GitHub as a command and control server.\nWe have reported the rogue GitHub account for harmful content.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe two macro-embedded documents seem to be luring the targets about new job opportunities at\nLockheed Martin:\n\nLockheed_Martin_JobOpportunities.docx\nSalary_Lockheed_Martin_job_opportunities_confidential.doc\n\n\n-----\n\nThe compilation time for both of these documents is 2020-04-24, but we have enough indicators\nthat confirm that they have been used in a campaign around late December 2021 and early 2022.\nSome of the indicators that shows this attack operated recently are the domains used by the threat\nactor.\n\nBoth of the documents use the same attack theme and have some common things like embedded\nmacros but the full attack chain seems to be totally different. The analysis provided in the blog is\nmainly based on the “Lockheed_Martin_JobOpportunities.docx” document but we also provide\nbrief analysis for the second document\n(Salary_Lockheed_Martin_job_opportunities_confidential.doc) at the end of this blog.\n\nFigure 1: Document Preview\n\n### Attack Process\n\nThe below image shows the full attack process which we will discuss in detail in this article. The\nattack starts by executing the malicious macros that are embedded in the Word document. The\nmalware performs a series of injections and achieves startup persistence in the target system. In\nthe next section we will provide technical details about various stages of this attack and its\npayload capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Attack Process\n\n### Macros: Control flow hijacking through KernelCallbackTable\n\nFigure 3: Macros Snippet\n\n\n-----\n\nThe above code uses a very unusual and lesser known technique to hijack the control flow and\nexecute malicious code. The malware retrieves the address of the “WMIsAvailableOffline”\nfunction from “wmvcore.dll”, then it changes the memory protection permissions for code in\n_“WMIsAvailableOffline” and proceeds to overwrite the code in memory with the malicious base64_\ndecoded shell-code.\n\nAnother interesting thing happening in the above code is the control flow hijacking through the\n_KernelCallbackTable member of the PEB. A call to NtQueryInformationProcess is made with_\n_ProcessBasicInformation class as the parameter which helps the malware to retrieve the address_\nof PEB and thus retrieving the KernelCallbackTable pointer.\n\nFigure 4: KernelCallbackTable in memory\n\n_KernelCallbackTable is initialized to an array of callback functions when user32.dll is loaded into_\nmemory, which are used whenever a graphical call (GDI) is made by the process. To hijack the\ncontrol flow, malware replaces the USER32!_fnDWORD callback in the table with the malicious\n_WMIsAvailableOffline function. Once the flow is hijacked and malicious code is executed the rest_\nof the code takes care of restoring the KernelCallbackTable to its original state.\n\n### Shellcode Analysis\n\nThe shellcode loaded by the macro contains an encrypted DLL which is decrypted at runtime and\nthen manually mapped into memory by the shellcode. After mapping the DLL, the shellcode\njumps to the entry point of that DLL. The shellcode uses some kind of custom hashing method to\n[resolve the APIs. We used hollows_hunter to dump the DLL and reconstruct the IAT once it is](https://github.com/hasherezade/hollows_hunter)\nfully mapped into memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: API resolving\n\nThe hashing function accepts two parameters: the hash of the DLL and the hash of the function\nwe are looking for in that DLL. A very simple algorithm is used for hashing APIs. The following\ncode block shows this algorithm:\n```\ndef string_hashing(name):\n\n  hash = 0\n\n  for i in range(0, len(name)):\n\n    hash = 2 * (hash + (ord(name[i]) | 0x60))\n\n  return hash\n\n```\nThe shellcode and all the subsequent inter-process Code/DLL injections in the attack chain use\nthe same injection method as described below.\n\n### Code Injection\n\nThe injection function is responsible for resolving all the required API calls. It then opens a\nhandle to the target process by using the OpenProcess API. It uses the SizeOfImage field in the\nNT header of the DLL to be injected into allocated space into the target process along with a\nseparate space for the init_dll function. The purpose of the init_dll function is to initialize the\ninjected DLL and then pass the control flow to the entry point of the DLL. One thing to note here\nis a simple CreateRemoteThread method is used to start a thread inside the target process unlike\nthe KernelCallbackTable technique used in our macro.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Target Process Injection through CreateRemoteThread\n\n### Malware Components\n\n_stage1_winword.dll – This is the DLL which is mapped inside the Word process. This DLL_\nis responsible for restoring the original state of KernelCallbackTable and then injecting\n_stage2_explorer.dll into the explorer.exe process._\n\nFigure 7: Restoring KernelCallbackTable to original state\n\n_stage2_explorer.dll – The winword.exe process injects this DLL into the explorer.exe_\nprocess. With brief analysis we find out that the .data section contains two additional DLLs.\nWe refer to them as drops_lnk.dll and stage3_runtimebroker.dll. By analyzing\n_stage2_explorer.dll a bit further we can easily understand the purpose of this DLL._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: stage2_explorer main routine\n\nThe above code snippet shows the main routine of stage2_explorer.dll. As you can see it checks\nfor the existence of “C:\\Wíndows\\system32\\wuaueng.dll” and then if it doesn’t exist it takes its\npath to drop additional files. It executes the drops_lnk.dll in the current process and then tries to\ncreate the RuntimeBroker process and if successful in creating RuntimeBroker, it injects\n_stage3_runtimebroker.dll into the newly created process. If for some reason process creation_\nfails, it just executes stage3_runtimebroker.dll in the current explorer.exe process.\n\n\n-----\n\n_drops_lnk.dll – This DLL is loaded and executed inside the explorer.exe process, it mainly_\ndrops the lnk file (WindowsUpdateConf.lnk) into the startup folder and then it checks for\nthe existence of wuaueng.dll in the malicious directory and manually loads and executes it\nfrom the disk if it exists. The lnk file (WindowsUpdateConf.lnk) executes\n_“C:\\Windows\\system32\\wuauclt.exe” /UpdateDeploymentProvider_\n_C:\\Wíndows\\system32\\wuaueng.dll /RunHandlerComServer. This is an interesting_\ntechnique used by Lazarus to run its malicious DLL using the Windows Update Client to\nbypass security detection mechanisms. With this method, the threat actor can execute its\nmalicious code through the Microsoft Windows Update client by passing the following\narguments: /UpdateDeploymentProvider, Path to malicious dll and\n/RunHandlerComServer argument after the dll.\n\nFigure 9: Startup folder path\n\nFigure 10: WindowsUpdateConf lnk\n\n_stage3_runtimebroker.dll – This DLL is responsible for creating the malicious directory_\n(“C:\\Wíndows\\system32\\”) and then drops the wuaueng.dll in that directory, furthermore\nit sets the attributes of the directory to make it hidden.\n\nFigure 11: stage3_runtimebroker main routine\n\n_wuaueng.dll – This is one of the most important DLLs in the attack chain. This malicious_\nDLL is signed with a certificate which seems to belong to “SAMOYAJ LIMITED”, Till 20\nJanuary 2022, the DLL had (0/65) AV detections and presently only 5/65 detect it as\nmalicious. This DLL has embedded inside another DLL which contains the core module\n(core_module.dll) of this malware responsible for communicating with the Command and\nControl (C2) server. This DLL can be loaded into memory in two ways:\n\n– If drops_lnk.dll loads this DLL into explorer.exe then it loads the core_module.dll and\nthen executes it\n\n– If it is being executed from wuauclt.exe, then it retrieves the PID of explorer.exe and\ninjects the core_module.dll into that process.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: wuaueng.dll main routine\n\n### The Core module and GitHub as a C2\n\nRarely do we see malware using GitHub as C2 and this is the first time we’ve observed Lazarus\nleveraging it. Using Github as a C2 has its own drawbacks but it is a clever choice for targeted and\nshort term attacks as it makes it harder for security products to differentiate between legitimate\nand malicious connections. While analyzing the core module we were able to get the required\ndetails to access the C2 but unfortunately it was already cleaned and we were not able to get much\nexcept one of the additional modules loaded by the core_module.dll remotely (thanks to\n[@jaydinbas who shared the module with us).](https://twitter.com/jaydinbas)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: core_module.dll C2 communication loop\n\nThere seems to be no type of string encoding used so we can clearly see the strings which makes\nthe analysis easy. get_module_from_repo uses the hardcoded username, repo_name, directory,\n_token to make a http request to GitHub and retrieves the files present in the “images” directory of_\nthe repository.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: get_module_from_repo function\n\nThe HTTP request retrieves contents of the files present in the repository with an interesting\nvalidation which checks that the retrieved file is a PNG. The file that was earlier retrieved was\nnamed “readme.png”; this PNG file has one of the malicious modules embedded in it. The strings\nin the module reveal that the module’s original name is “GetBaseInfo.dll”. Once the malware\nretrieves the module it uses the map_module function to map the DLL and then looks for an\nexported function named “GetNumberOfMethods” in the malicious module. It then executes\n_GetNumberOfMethods and saves the result obtained by the module. This result is committed to_\nthe remote repo under the metafiles directory with a filename denoting the time at which the\nmodule was executed. This file committed to the repo contains the result of the commands\nexecuted by the module on the target system. To commit the file the malware makes a PUT HTTP\nrequest to Github.\n\n### Additional Modules (GetBaseInfo.dll)\n\nThis was the only module which we were able to get our hands on. Only a single module does limit\nus in finding all the capabilities this malware has. Also its a bit difficult to hunt for these modules\nas they never really touch the disk which makes them harder to detect by AVs. The only way to get\nthe modules would be to access the C2 and download the modules while they are live. Coming\nback to this module, it has very limited capabilities. It retrieves the Username, ComputerName\nand a list of all the running processes on the system and then returns the result so it can be\ncommitted to the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: GetBaseInfo module retrieving the information\n\n### GitHub Account\n\nThe account with the username “DanielManwarningRep” is used to operate the malware. The\naccount was created on January 17th, 2022 and other than this we were not able to find any\ninformation related to the account.\n\nFigure 16: Account details from the token used\n\n## Second Malicious Document used in the campaign\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malicious Document – Salary_Lockheed_Martin_job_opportunities_confidential.doc**\n(0160375e19e606d06f672be6e43f70fa70093d2a30031affd2929a5c446d07c1)\n\nThe initial attack vector used in this document is similar to the first document but the malware\ndropped by the macro is totally different. Sadly, the C2 for this malware was down by the time we\nstarted analyzing it.\n\nThis document uses KernelCallbackTable as well to hijack the control flow just like our first\nmodule, the injection technique used by the shellcode also resembles the first document. The\nmajor difference in this document is that it tries to retrieve a remote HTML page and then\nexecutes it using mshta.exe. The remote HTML page is located at\n_https[:]//markettrendingcenter[.]com/member.htm and throws a 404 Not Found which makes_\nit difficult for us to analyze this document any further.\n\nFigure 17: Shellcode\n\n## Attribution\n\nThere are multiple indicators that suggest that this campaign has been operated by the Lazarus\nthreat actor. In this section we provide some of the indicators that confirm the actor behind this\nattack is Lazarus:\n\nUsing job opportunities as template is the known method used by Lazarus to target its\nvictims. The documents created by this actor are well designed and contain a large icon for a\nknown company such as LockHeed Martin, BAE Systems, Boeing and Northrop Grumman\nin the template.\nIn this campaign the actor has targeted people that are looking for job opportunities at\nLockheed Martin. Targeting the defense industry and specifically Lockheed Martin is a\nknown target for this actor.\nThe document’s metadata used in this campaign links them to several other documents used\nby this actor in the past.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18: Attribution based on metadata\n\nUsing Frame1_Layout for macro execution and using lesser known API calls for shellcode\n[execution is known to be used by Lazarus.](https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/01/23/rift-analysing-a-lazarus-shellcode-execution-method/)\nWe also were able to find infrastructure overlap between this campaign and past campaigns\nof Lazarus (Figure 19).\n\nFigure 19: Connection with past campaigns\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLazarus APT is one of the advanced APT groups that is known to target the defense industry. The\ngroup keeps updating its toolset to evade security mechanisms. In this blog post we provided a\ndetailed analysis about the new campaign operated by this actor. Even though they have used\ntheir old job theme method, they employed several new techniques to bypass detections:\n\nUse of KernelCallbackTable to hijack the control flow and shellcode execution\nUse of the Windows Update client for malicious code execution\nUse of GitHub for C2 communication\n\n\n-----\n\n## IOCs:\n\n**Maldocs:**\n0d01b24f7666f9bccf0f16ea97e41e0bc26f4c49cdfb7a4dabcc0a494b44ec9b\nLockheed_Martin_JobOpportunities.docx\n\n0160375e19e606d06f672be6e43f70fa70093d2a30031affd2929a5c446d07c1\n\nSalary_Lockheed_Martin_job_opportunities_confidential.doc\n\n**Domains:**\n\nmarkettrendingcenter.com\n\nlm-career.com\n\n**Payloads:**\n\nName Sha256\n\nreadme.png 4216f63870e2cdfe499d09fce9caa301f9546f60a69c4032cb5fb6d5ceb9af32\n\nwuaueng.dll 829eceee720b0a3e505efbd3262c387b92abdf46183d51a50489e2b157dac3b1\n\nstage1_winword.dll f14b1a91ed1ecd365088ba6de5846788f86689c6c2f2182855d5e0954d62af3b\n\nstage2_explorer.dll 660e60cc1fd3e155017848a1f6befc4a335825a6ae04f3416b9b148ff156d143\n\ndrops_lnk.dll 11b5944715da95e4a57ea54968439d955114088222fd2032d4e0282d12a58abb\n\nstage3_runtimebroker.dll 9d18defe7390c59a1473f79a2407d072a3f365de9834b8d8be25f7e35a76d818\n\ncore_module.dll c677a79b853d3858f8c8b86ccd8c76ebbd1508cc9550f1da2d30be491625b744\n\nGetBaseInfo.dll 5098ec21c88e14d9039d232106560b3c87487b51b40d6fef28254c37e4865182\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
