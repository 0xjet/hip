Trend\n\nMicro and ClearSky continued monitoring\n\nRocket Kitten for the past months and decided\n\nto join forces to release this paper. With new\n\nattack cases that show the different tactics\n\nand techniques that Rocket Kitten uses, we\n\nwant to shed further light on the group’s\n\ndealings and come closer to understanding\n\ntheir motivations and goals and who they may\n\nbe representing.\n\nOur findings show that Rocket Kitten is still\n\nactive, retains a growing level of persistence,\n\nand acts ever more aggressively in terms of\n\nattack method. We also found that recent\n\npublications on the group’s activity have done\n\nnothing to change their behavior or reduce\n\ntheir activity. They don’t seem to bother\n\nto have to “disappear.” With this paper, we\n\nfeel fairly certain that Rocket Kitten’s prime\n\ntargets are not companies and political\n\norganizations as entire bodies but individuals\n\nthat operate in strategically interesting fields\n\nsuch as diplomacy, foreign policy research,\n\nand defense-related businesses. We believe\n\nthe espionage factor and political context\n\nmake their attacks unique and very different\n\nfrom traditional targeted attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION I\n\n# Targeted attacks and  cyber espionage\n\n\n-----\n\n## Targeted attacks and cyber espionage\n\nThe greatest source of risk in cyberspace emanates from groups with the resources and commitment to\n\nrelentlessly target a company, a government agency, an organization, or even an individual until they\n\nsucceed in breaking in and taking what the victim values most. This usually involves an unauthorized\n\nperson gaining access to a network and staying there undetected for a long period of time via a targeted\n\nattack. Typically, the purpose of a targeted attack is to monitor target systems and exfiltrate data from\n\nthese, as opposed to causing damage or disruption. Therefore, there is an innate connection between\n\ntraditional espionage and targeted attacks. One can say that a targeted attack evolved from the tradecraft\n\nof espionage. The difficulty very often lies in detecting targeted attacks in a timely manner and even more\n\nin pinpointing attackers’ identities and their financial backers, understanding their motivations, and where\n\nthe attacks are coming from.\n\nThis is also the case when it comes to political espionage carried out in the cyberrealm. Any espionage\n\nactivity does not usually go after monetary gain and it is very difficult to attribute it to a certain group or\n\nnation-state. The attackers can be anything from self-anointed cyber units with a political cause to cyber\ncapable separatist groups, state-sponsored hackers, or actual covert intelligence agents. Many times, such\n\ninstances of cyber espionage are attributed to nation-states because they are the most likely to have the\n\ngreatest motivation, they have the most to gain, and they are most capable of funding and maintaining\n\ncyber-espionage efforts without being detected.\n\nWhen we look at the Rocket Kitten case, we are not dealing with cybercriminals that conduct corporate\n\nespionage to obtain access to sensitive documents or resell confidential information and intellectual\n\nproperty. This is an obvious case of politically inspired or motivated espionage.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2\n\n# Rocket Kitten:  Persistent spies\n\n\n-----\n\n## Rocket Kitten: Persistent spies\n\n##### Attacker profile\n\nSince mid-2014, a group of attackers was observed by different computer security professionals, including\n\nTrend Micro and ClearSky. We have documented some of their moves. The set of targeted attack campaigns\n\nhave been dubbed “Rocket Kitten” and the perpetrators as the “Rocket Kitten Group.” Additional sources\n\nindicate that the group may have been active as early as 2011 and increased their activities in 2014.\n\nClearSky first monitored attacks that involved GHOLE—a malicious version of the Core Impact Pro[®]\n\npenetration-testing tool. Core Impact Pro is a legitimate commercial security product that, being a powerful\n\ninvestigative security tool, also bears some potential for misuse with malicious purposes. It is executed by\n\na malicious Microsoft[®] Office macro. Following ClearSky’s research, Gadi Evron and Tillmann Werner, in\n\na presentation at the Chaos Communication Congress (CCC), reported attacks conducted with the same\n\nmalware that according to them very strongly pointed to nation-state origin [4]. This March, Trend Micro\n\npublished a paper on Operation Woolen-Goldfish, which targeted a number of European businesses and\n\norganizations via spear phishing [5]. This finding showed a connection to the Rocket Kitten campaign seen\n\nin December 2014. The Trend Micro paper also showed the use of a new exclusive piece of malware that\n\nthreat actors called “CWoolger.”\n\nJust this June, ClearSky detected new movements from the group, which showed an attack intensity that\n\nexceeded our estimations by far. ClearSky has learned of 550 targets, most of which are located in the\n\nMiddle East. It documented some findings in “Thamar Reservoir [6].” In this paper, Trend Micro and\n\nClearSky combined research results to shed further light on Rocket Kitten’s tactics and methods, and show\n\nthat the focus right now is very much on individuals rather than on organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nIsraeli academic institution\n(first-seen attempt)\n\n\nIsraeli defense-industry-adjacent\ncompany (reported to IL-CERT)\n\n\nEuropean defense-related\ngovernment institution\n\n\nEuropean government institution\n\n\nIsraeli defense contractor\n\n\nIsraeli academic institution\n\n\nGerman government institution\n\n\nClearSky GHOLE malware\nresearch publishing\n\n\nIsraeli academic institution\n\n\nIsraeli academic institution\n\n\nGadi Evron & Tillman Werner\nCCC Presentation\n\n\nTrend Micro Operation WoolenGoldfish research publishing\n\n\nClearSky Thamar Reservoir\nresearch publishing\n\n\nIranian professor (expat)\n\n|Col1|APR 2014 MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN 2015 FEB MAR APR MAY|\n|---|---|\n\n\nJUN\n\n_Timeline of Rocket Kitten-related activities_\n\n##### What is Rocket Kitten after?\n\n\nReported victims\n\nResearch presented/\npublished\n\n\nFrom our monitoring efforts, our analysis of the attack setup, and the type of people targeted by the threat\n\nactors, we drew the conclusion that Rocket Kitten mainly targets different verticals in the Middle East.\n\nTheir favorite targets seem to be involved in policy research, diplomacy, all aspects of international affairs,\n\ndefense, security, journalism, human rights, and others. We also observed attacks targeting organizations\n\nlocated in Europe but in the bigger scheme of things this activity is marginal (about 5% of the total number\n\nof targeted attacks). The actors do not seem to be motivated by a hacktivist agenda. To us, it is not at all\n\nclear what kind of specific information Rocket Kitten is generally after but it is clear that it has to do with\n\nespionage.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we have not seen what documents or information the actors typically look for when they obtain access to\n\na computer or what were exfiltrated following a compromise, it is hard to speculate. From the facts that we\n\nhave, we can only assume what their motivation and goal may be, no evidence can support any attribution we\n\nwould claim at this point. What we know is that the individuals targeted often had strategically interesting\n\nprofessions from a political or geostrategic perspective. They are scientists, journalists, researchers, and\n\nsometimes expatriated Iranians living in Western countries. These facts suggest that Rocket Kitten may be\n\nengaging some sort of foreign political espionage campaign and may want to find regime-opponents active\n\nin driving policy in different ways. There are state actors in the region who are interested in gaining access\n\nto the information that can be found in people’s computers and emails. These people are professionally\n\naffiliated with the foreign policy and defense sectors and there is an interest in finding out who they are\n\ntalking to and what kinds of action they support.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 3\n\n# Tactics, tools,  and techniques\n\n\n-----\n\n## Tactics, tools, and techniques\n\n##### Strategy and standard operating procedure\n\nAs in any typical targeted attack, Rocket Kitten utilizes several different malware types and has a concrete\n\ntactical setup to compromise an individual or an entity. This compromise seems to mainly serve the\n\npurpose of monitoring communications and extracting information, in short, espionage. The victim may\n\nbe the desired target because the information he holds is valuable to the attacker but he may also just be a\n\nstepping stone to reach the actual target.\n\nRocket Kitten’s operating template, which remains constant in almost every case we have seen, has the\n\nfollowing components:\n\n1. **Point of entry: Rocket Kitten uses spear phishing and social engineering to establish contact with**\n\neither the primary or secondary victim. This can be done by faking accounts and identities:\n\n   - Using fake Google Drive™ or Gmail™ accounts (The Rocket Kitten Group often impersonated\n\npersons of interest and public figures such as Israeli engineers.)\n\n   - Using stolen documents that suggest a legitimate cause and sender\n\n   - Using social media accounts as in Facebook to directly contact targets, create rapport via private\n\nmessages, and log correspondence as well as consequently make users visit phishing websites\n\nThe spear-phishing email contains a link or a file that when clicked or opened unleashes a payload that\n\ntakes over the target machine.\n\n2. Command-and-control (C&C) communication: The infected computer communicates with a\n\nC&C server. It can download whatever malware is available or intended for the cause and purpose\n\nof the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs soon as the actors get the user’s password (through a request to type it sent via an email, a Facebook\n\nmessage, or a phone call), they take over the chosen account right away and any other accounts they can\n\nget their hands on (Facebook, other email accounts, and cloud accounts). They can employ a keylogger\n\n(detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_WOOLERG [7]) that logs keystrokes.\n\nThey can, for example, connect an application to your Gmail account (in the cases we’ve seen, Microsoft\n\nOutlook[®] obtained access to the Gmail account as a “connected app”) so we assume that the attackers\n\ndownloaded all of their victims’ emails for offline processing.\n\nThey can also install any other piece of malware.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n6\n\nIntelligence Point of C&C Lateral Asset Data\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Maintenance\ngathering entry communication movement discovery exfiltration\n\n_Rocket Kitten attack components_\n\n\n5\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Simple tools and lack of professionalism\n\nThe Rocket Kitten Group uses both relatively simple tools that we suspect they developed as well as more\n\nadvanced, publicly available ones, which may have been either purchased or stolen. What strikes us about\n\nthe attackers is that they don’t seem to put much effort into quality assurance when it came to content—\n\nhow emails and phishing pages are formulated—and so, make a lot of mistakes (typos and grammatical\n\nerrors). This, of course, makes patterns relatively easy to identify once we know what to look for. However,\n\nthe attackers do make up for these disadvantages with persistence. Based on our research and profiling, we\n\nbelieve the members of the Rocket Kitten Group could be former cybercriminals who ventured into a new\n\nfield for some unclear reason and so use some of the methods they used to. Many of their techniques are\n\ntypically observed in criminal endeavors.\n\n##### Persistence\n\nThe most notable Rocket Kitten strategy lies in numerous attempts to attack the same (chosen) targets for as\n\nlong as necessary, even if that means trying on a daily basis and with ever new cover stories and convincing\n\ntechniques to entice users. The idea is to barrage targets until they eventually slip and inadvertently allow\n\nthe attackers to obtain the desired information, whether primary or secondary in nature—directly stealing\n\ncredentials from or taking control of victims’ computers. Often, even if targets are aware of impending\n\nor already-occurring attacks (when they receive malicious messages on a daily basis or are repeatedly\n\nrequested to reset their passwords), it is almost impossible to defend against attempts, making professional\n\nguidance indispensable. The attackers try to overwhelm targets by executing numerous password-reset\n\nattempts, making victims believe they are losing control over their accounts.\n\n##### Work versus private accounts and devices\n\nThe Rocket Kitten Group prefers to go after victims’ private email addresses and other accounts rather\n\nthan their organizational ones. This is a clever move, taking advantage of their lack of peripheral protection\n\nat home as opposed to in an organizational setting where monitoring systems are in place and security\n\npersonnel can help as soon as alarms go off. Now, the attackers very well know that while in theory, work\n\nand private lives are completely separate; in the real world, people use personal cloud services (Gmail,\n\nGoogle Drive, Yahoo![®], etc.) and personal devices (home computers) to store and share work-related\n\ncontent. What this constellation creates for the attackers is a blissful chain reaction. First, they can gain\n\naccess to professional, work-related information by attacking and infecting unprotected, nonorganizational\n\naccess points. By extension, they are also able to use now-infected personal devices or accounts to breach\n\norganizational computers and networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Infection vectors and malicious applications\n\n###### Social engineering and spear phishing\n\nRocket Kitten primarily infects systems via spear phishing. They send spear-phishing emails, sometimes\n\npaired with social engineering techniques, to targets. They basically rely on psychological manipulation in\n\norder to convince targets that they are who they claim to be. As an added layer—to make emails even more\n\ncredible—they use stolen documents that in the victims’ mind should “prove” their identity and mission.\n\nRocket Kitten targets primary victims but also secondary ones that they steal content from to reuse to\n\nspear-phish primary targets. One interesting incident involves compromising the email account of a\n\nfamous Israeli engineer to get nonpublic documents from him. These were then used to more convincingly\n\nmimic the engineer in order to get to primary targets within his professional circle.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Rocket Kitten will keep trying to hit targets and won’t rest until they do. This can\n\nmean receiving the same email five or ten times, perhaps with slightly different words, prompting receivers\n\nto click fatal links. If one method or email content does not work, the attackers will resort to different\n\nwording. Rocket Kitten, in this sense, is not only persistent but also very agile. The attackers:\n\n- Keep finding new cover stories by making them up based on stolen information\n\n- Use various email addresses (faked or breached)\n\n- Use disguises (fake identities or usurped real ones), camouflaging as people others theoretically trust\n\n- Make phone calls and send messages, sometimes even directly corresponding with victims in order to\n\ngain genuine trust\n\n- Breach websites to set up phishing pages (Google Drive or fake Gmail pages) or register new domains\n\nsolely for phishing\n\nIn a case we analyzed, for example, one of the targets sent a message back in Hebrew, asking if the email\n\nwas real. The attackers responded right away, also in Hebrew, confirming the email’s authenticity. This\n\nconvinced the targets to open the attached files.\n\n###### Fake profiles: A case\n\nOne of Rocket Kitten’s targets was lured into communicating via a fake Facebook profile. The attacker\n\nbehind the fake profile communicated in perfect Farsi. This fake profile was closed by Facebook because it\n\ndid not conform to community standards. This prompted the attacker to just create a new account “mah.\n\nasf.xxx” where “xxx” is a random number.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile we found no evidence that these Facebook accounts were actually handled by the Rocket Kitten\n\nGroup, the conversations and additional emails from a sender with the same name strongly suggest this was\n\nindeed performed by the threat actors. The target also received emails from [REDACTED]_asf@yahoo.com.\n\nThis account’s owner attempts to build trust and/or gather information. Incidentally, this new fake\n\nFacebook profile also sent an invite request to one of ClearSky’s researchers, which we will go into detail\n\nlater on. In our experience, this is something that very rarely happens.\n\nOne more backdoor installer was found in the wild. This also communicated with a C&C server (84.11.146.62)\n\nand usurped Trend Micro HouseCall.[1] We found no traces of this backdoor installer in any spear-phishing\n\ncampaign but it may have been used by the attackers to infect the systems of targets that we are not aware\n\nof. We just found it noteworthy that this installer has the same functions and uses the same C&C server.\n\n###### Malware used\n\nRocket Kitten’s entire way of launching attacks suggests that the group is not very technically sophisticated.\n\nThe same is true about the malware they utilize. Closer analysis of their code showed deficits and mistakes\n\nthat a professional cybercriminal would not make (the keylogger was badly developed and easily leaked\n\ntheir File Transfer Protocol [FTP] credentials, for example). Modifying an existing piece of commercial\n\ncode like that of Core Impact Pro did not require a lot of skill as well.\n\nMost of the malware they use may not have been developed by the group’s members. The threat actors\n\nused off-the-shelf and low-quality tools that seem to have been self-developed or made by someone for\n\ntheir exclusive use. The malware used to infect computers often showcased many extra features like stealth\n\n(once a payload is placed in memory, any trace of the malware on the file system is erased). A more detailed\n\nanalysis of the different malware types is provided in the next chapters where we look at one specific tool\n\n(a keylogger named TSPY_WOOLERG) and analyzed malicious files used in new cases.\n\n###### A new version of TSPY_WOOLERG emerges\n\nIn Operation Woolen-Goldfish, Trend Micro revealed the existence of a previously unknown keylogger\n\ndubbed “TSPY_WOOLERG.” This seems to have been developed by the Rocket Kitten Group or bought for\n\nexclusive use from a third party. This keylogger showed the following debug string in its first-seen version:\n```\n C:\\Users\\Wool3n.H4t\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\C-CPP\\CWoolger\\Release\\\n CWoolger.pdb\n\n```\n1 Fake Trend Micro HouseCall installer: HousecallLauncher.exe (SHA-1: af364ff503da71875b6d7c401a1e98e31450a561)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe discovered a new TSPY_WOOLERG version in the wild and found different variants containing the\n\nfollowing debug strings:\n```\n D:\\Yaser Logers\\optimizer\\WoolenLoger\\obj\\x86\\Release\\windows optimizer.pdb\n D:\\Yaser Logers\\optimizer tmp\\WoolenLoger\\obj\\x86\\Release\\windows optimizer.pdb\n D:\\Yaser Logers\\CWoolger\\Release\\CWoolger.pdb\n\n```\n“Yaser” is a very common Arab first name. We couldn’t find other malware families with similar debug\n\nstrings. We suspect Yaser to be a developer who is part of the Rocket Kitten Group or from a third party\n\nwhom the group may have purchased the keylogger from. Yaser could also be the same person as “Wool3n.\n\nH4t” whom we exposed in Operation Woolen-Goldfish since the previous debug strings showed that a\n\nWool3n.H4t was also in possession of the CWoolger source code. It could, of course, also simply be fake\n\ninformation that attackers intentionally put there to lead us to a false track.\n\nThe new binaries we found were compiled between 31 May and 1 August 2015. The keylogger is basically\n\nthe same, yet a very basic layer of encryption has been added to hide the attackers’ FTP credentials.\n\n_Very basic encryption used to hide the FTP credentials in the keylogger binary_\n\nThe FTP server to which the stolen key logs are sent is currently set to _107.6.172.54/woolen/. Previous_\n\nversions of the keylogger also reported to the IP address, 107.6.181.116, which belongs to the same provider,\n\nSingleHop. We noticed that some versions of the keylogger have had the upload function removed. Instead,\n\nanother binary in the same folder that was externally executed was added.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Trend Micro detection|SHA-1 hash|Credential theft|Upload function|Key log file name|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|TSPYWOOLERG.C|db2b8f49b4e76c2f538a3a6b222c35547c802cef 29968b0c4157f226761073333ff2e82b588ddf8e eeb67e663b2fa980c6b228fc2e04304c8992401d|No Yes Yes|No Yes Yes|%TEMP%\\AdobeARM.log %TEMP%\\wlg.dat %TEMP%\\wlg.dat|\n|TSPYWOOLERG.B|c8096078f0f6c3fbb6d82c5b00211802168f9cba|No|Replaced with wsnd.exe|%TEMP%\\AdobeARMM.log|\n\n\n_New TSPY_WOOLERG variants_\n\nThe newest versions based on compilation date do not have credentials. This suggests that CWoolerg is\n\ncontinuously being developed, not for updating purposes or adding functionality but rather to enhance\n\nstealth so they will not be detected by security products.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 4\n\n# Rocket Kitten in action: New attack cases\n\n\n-----\n\n## Rocket Kitten in action:  New attack cases\n\n##### Case exploiting a ClearSky researcher’s identity\n\nWe made an interesting observation in one particular case where the attackers attempted to approach a\n\nClearSky threat researcher using a fake Facebook profile. When this attempt didn’t work, they resorted to\n\nother techniques. In the latter part of this June, the researcher received a phone call from another attack\n\ntarget whom he had been in contact with during the Thamar Reservoir investigation. This other person\n\nwanted to confirm if the researcher indeed sent him an email (which he actually never did). This is just\n\nanother example of the clever use of social engineering that the Rocket Kitten Group adopted to go after\n\ntargets. Usurping a threat researcher’s identity is something we haven’t seen until now. But it tells us a back\n\nstory. The attackers may either have had access to an email account revealing correspondence between the\n\nresearcher and the victim or they realized that they were being investigated by ClearSky and exploited that\n\nknowledge.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers used the researcher’s real email signature as camouflage in order to send this legitimate\nsounding content to the victim:\n\n##### New Message\n\n#### Malware Investigation; Final step\n\n###### Hi xxx,\n\n As per our previous conversations about virus found in your center, try to scan your computers with this online antivirus.\n\n It is from Trend Micro security company and can quickly identify and fix a wide range of threats including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware and the recent malware:\n\n   trend micro Housecall Launcher\n\n Simply download and run the file and after updating, let it scan your computer.\n\n Regards,\n\n xxx \n\n##### Send Attach Save Options\n\n_Spear-phishing email received by a target supposedly from a ClearSky researcher_\n\n##### Technical analysis\n\nIn this particular case, we can’t reveal the victim’s name or any other specific circumstances but we did find\n\nsome noteworthy technical details, including:\n\n- [The email was sent using the address, clearsky . cybersec . group @ gmail . com, which is obviously not](mailto:clearsky.cybersec.group@gmail.com)\n\nan official ClearSky address that the attackers created. Attentive recipients should realize that the\n\nimportant information here lies in the address domain—a Gmail address—but very often, they tend\n\nto intuitively only react to the first part of the name that indicates some kind of security problem with\n\ntheir machines.\n\n- The first link in the email, “Trend Micro security,” actually leads to the real Trend Micro website,\n\n_trendmicro.com._\n\n\n-----\n\n- The second link that the recipients are supposed to click in order to download HouseCall, however, leads\n\nto a malicious file (HousecallLauncher.exe [SHA-1: af364ff503da71875b6d7c401a1e98e31450a561]).\n\n- The attackers’ choice to use the Trend Micro brand as lure raised a red flag. It could have either been\n\na purely random choice or a very cleverly chosen one. Knowing that Trend Micro investigated on their\n\noperations, they could have utilized this fact to create a false sense of security and trust with victims\n\nwho would probably believe it safe to download the vendor’s product. Perhaps this is also a payback for\n\nrevealing details on one of their operations.\n\n- The malicious file (HousecallLauncher.exe) is a Flex-compressed .SFX file with a lot of obfuscation\n\nand anti-debugging code. It has three embedded files, namely:\n\n**_•_** **_Data.ini: Only contains a path to the actual file._**\n\n**_•_** **_FILE1: An official Trend Micro HouseCall launcher binary._**\n\n**_•_** **_FILE2 (SHA-1: 457f54e9a0f32f2648f95a8e339d9fd9aed23fa7): The actual malicious_**\n\npayload—a Meterpreter[2] stager.\n\n- When the .SFX file is executed, the payload is placed and ran in memory. No traces are left in the file\n\nsystem, rendering detection rather difficult.\n\n- It accesses the same IP address _(84.11.146.62),_ which belongs to IABG in Germany. This service\n\nprovider has already been used in previous Rocket Kitten operations. The malware obfuscates every\n\napplication programming interface (API) string in its body (using a simple XOR operation with the\n\nvalue, 0xC4h). It also very carefully obfuscates its strings after use.\n\n- The code is literally littered with several anti-debugging techniques (IsDebuggerPresent, GetTickCount,\n\nand ZwQueryInformationProcess tricks).\n\n- The code only has one function—to establish a connection with the IP address, 84.11.146.62, in order\n\nto download a new binary. Once connected to the C&C server, the downloaded binary is injected into a\n\nprocess, which is, in fact, metsrv.dll, from Metasploit. It has several export functions.\n\n2 Meterpreter is an advanced, dynamically extensible payload included in the Metasploit framework. It can provide complex and advanced\n\n_features that would otherwise be tedious to purely implement in assembly. Developers can write their own extensions in .DLL files that can be_\n\n_uploaded and injected into processes running on target computers after exploitation._\n\n\n-----\n\n_List of export functions in the binary_\n\nIn sum, the first binary only contains instructions to contact the handler, read the 4-byte value (the size of\n\nthe metsrv.dll file), allocate the required RWX memory in the remote host, download the metsrv.dll file,\n\nand through a process known as “reflective DLL injection,” pass the control to the metsrv.dll file.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The Thamar Gindin case: Thamar Reservoir\n\nClearSky’s Thamar Reservoir research revealed attacks against Dr. Thamar E. Gindin, an expert on Iranian\n\nlinguistics and pre-Islamic Iran, lecturer, and research fellow at the Ezri Center for Iran and Persian Gulf\n\nResearch at the University of Haifa. The attack dates back to mid-2015. In an interview with the IDF radio\n\nstation, she revealed connections to and communications with people in Iran.[3] It’s not difficult to imagine\n\nthat her pronounced opinions can make her profile disturbing in a certain context.\n\nBefore ClearSky’s publication, the attackers already attempted to victimize Dr. Gindin using different\n\ntechniques, including:\n\n- A malware-laden spear-phishing email\n\n- Three separate emails with links to fake log-in pages (including those that require two-factor\n\nauthentication), one of which was hosted on a breached website while another two had dedicated\n\ndomains\n\n- Two phone calls from the attackers designed to build rapport for the purpose of phishing\n\n- Numerous attempts to take over her cloud accounts using the providers’ account-recovery mechanisms\n\n- Numerous Facebook messages and emails\n\nIt’s interesting to note that ClearSky’s publication didn’t really deter the attackers from continuing their\n\nactions. Rather, they kept on trying to hack into Dr. Gindin’s email accounts even though she was already\n\naware that she was being targeted. This June, after the release of ClearSky’s research, Dr. Gindin received\n\nnotifications from Google that they received password-reset requests that she never made.\n\nThe attackers can be said to have taken the following steps:\n\n- They created a Gmail account with a username that only differed by one character from Dr. Gindin’s.\n\nThey used this account to send emails with an Excel spreadsheet attachment named _“Message.xlsb_\n\n(SHA-1: _46a995df8d9918ca0793404110904479b6adcb9f, detected by Trend Micro as “X2KM__\n\nMDROP.A”) to several of Dr. Gindin’s contacts.\n\n- Opening the .XLSB file asks the recipient to enable macros.\n\n_3 http://gulfc.haifa.ac.il/index.php/the-ezri-center-in-the-media/291-the-ezri-center-in-the-media_\n\n\n-----\n\n- Enabling macros results in BKDR_SWRORT.CP infection. Users see some academic content in Hebrew\n\n(a timeline of events for the faculty for 2015). What struck us is that the Excel file was created the same\n\nday the email was sent. This tells us that the attackers customized the document for this spear phishing\n\nand did not simply reuse old content. Members of the group often seemed to use stolen nonpublic\n\ndocuments as lure. This is a favorite Rocket Kitten technique.\n\n- The backdoor installation is fairly straightforward. A file called _“tmp.bat”_ is created in the infected\n\nsystems’ root folder and executed.\n\n\n_Prompt to enable macros that recipients see_\n\nEnabling macros results in BKDR_SWRORT.CP infection. Users see some academic content in Hebrew\n\n(a timeline of events for the faculty for 2015). What struck us is that the Excel file was created the same\n\nday the email was sent. This tells us that the attackers customized the document for this spear phishing\n\nand did not simply reuse old content. Members of the group often seemed to use stolen nonpublic\n\ndocuments as lure. This is a favorite Rocket Kitten technique.\n\nThe backdoor installation is fairly straightforward. A file called _“tmp.bat”_ is created in the infected\n\n```\nREG ADD “HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” /V “My\nApp” /t REG_SZ /F /D “C:\\Users\\#USERNAME#\\NTUSER.dat{GUID}.exe”\ndel tmp.bat\n\n```\n\n_Temporary script created on an infected system_\n\nThe script only has two lines of code:\n\n   - The first line adds a “run” registry key to make the file _NTUSER.dat{GUID}.exe_ persistent.\n\nThis is vital because it ensures that the backdoor will relaunch every time an infected computer\n\nis rebooted. Also, note that the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)[4] is unique for each run (for\n\nexample, _C83519C4-C8FE-4AB2-9061-A6B3D7525FC9)._ Randomizing the GUID is a way to\n\nbypass malware detection based on file name. Using the same file name makes a piece of malware\n\neasy to detect.\n\n4  GUID is a unique reference number. It’s a 128-bit value that is unique not only within an enterprise but also worldwide. Active Directory\n\n_internally uses GUID to identify objects._\n\n\n-----\n\n   - The second line deletes the script in an attempt to hide the infection.\n\n   - The file, _NTUSER.dat{GUID}.exe_ (SHA-1: _64ba130e627dd85c85d6534e769d239080e068dd,_\n\ndetected by Trend Micro as “BKDR_SWRORT.CP”) has been dropped prior to launching the tmp.\n\n_bat script._\n\n- BKDR_SWRORT.CP is a small downloader that communicates with and downloads files from the IP\n\n[address, 84.11.146.62. This IP address belongs to an IABG IP range (http://www.iabg.de/), a German](http://www.iabg.de/)\n\nsatellite communications provider that the attackers have been using for a long time.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Rocket Kitten Group has been around for a while now. Based on research done by several security\n\ncompanies, including Trend Micro and ClearSky, we can assume that their activities will continue in the\n\nnear future, as they weren’t deterred by making their existence and attack methods known.\n\nWe’ve been observing the group for about a year now. The more information we gather about their tactics\n\nand methods, the more we are convinced that what we are facing is a group of resourceful and persistent\n\nactors. Rocket Kitten doesn’t need sophisticated skills. The infection vectors that the group uses are very\n\nsimple. The malware they use are mostly purchased from third parties. But these shouldn’t fool anyone\n\ninto thinking they’re less difficult to deal with. Rocket Kitten makes up for their shortcomings by being\n\nextremely persistent and agile. The cases we analyzed in this paper show that careful planning and creativity\n\nare involved when they attempt to gain access to and gain a foothold in a target.\n\nTargeted attacks are not only used for economic advancement via stealing. Rather, they should be\n\nconsidered an evolution of the tradecraft of classic espionage, even in geopolitical relations.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Appendix\n\n###### General safety measures against targeted attacks\n\n**•** **Be vigilant; share information. First, be vigilant. The second has to do with information sharing.**\n\nIf you think or know that you are being targeted, it helps to be familiar with and conscious of the\n\nattackers’ modus operandi. Therefore, examining emails, websites, and other forms of communication\n\ncan help you identify threats and avoid infection. Ask questions like “Do you know the sender?”; “Is\n\nthis his address?”; and “Does it make sense for him to use or send macros?” When attack targets share\n\ninformation with colleagues, friends, and family members, the attackers have a harder time fooling\n\nthem. And if security analyses are available to investigate suspicious emails, files, and websites, it is\n\neven more crucial to share information. This helps you understand their tools and methods, technical\n\ninfrastructure, targets, and, perhaps, even their aims and objectives.\n\n**•** **Seek specialists’ assistance in case of an attack. Even if you know that you are being attacked,**\n\nyou still need professional guidance from specialists who can analyze incidents and provide real\ntime assistance. This is even more significant if attacks succeed. For example, attackers may execute\n\nnumerous password-reset attempts at the same time, making you believe you’re losing control of\n\nyour accounts. Without professional guidance, you can make a mistake like give your credentials\n\nto an attacker, click a malicious link, or even neglect to inform your service provider that account\n\nrestoration should be canceled. The usual initial reaction to receiving suspicious messages is to delete\n\nthem. However, reporting suspicious messages to your organization’s security team is crucial so they\n\ncan analyze attack methods, assess risks, and identify malicious content.\n\n**•** **Regularly and timely update software.** We can never repeat this enough—OSs and installed\n\nsoftware must be constantly updated with security fixes.\n\n**•** **Use up-to-date anti-malware solutions and Host Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPSs).**\n\nThese software help detect threats.\n\n**•** **Regularly run network checks. If you run a network, regularly check log files or have them checked**\n\nby a security professional. This will help you discover malicious communication with attackers and\n\nC&C servers.\n\n###### Specific measures related to Rocket Kitten\n\n**•** **Pay close attention to senders’ addresses even if they seem familiar. The fact that a message**\n\nis part of a previous conversation does not mean that it is authentic (it could be an indication that the\n\nattacker took control of someone else’s account). We have already seen email addresses with minor\n\nchanges used (one different letter in the address or domain and therefore seem identical at first sight).\n\n**•** **Do not enter your password on pages you were led to by links embedded in emails.**\n\nIt’s always better to manually type desired domain addresses, search for them on Google, or use\n\nbookmarked links.\n\n\n-----\n\n**•** **Inform acquaintances** **about attacks. They can become targets as well.**\n\n**•** **Known and “trusted” websites can be hacked and used as part of an attack infrastructure.**\n\nNever automatically trust any website. Always closely check websites and messages and look for\n\nunreasonable mistakes (grammar, typos, etc.).\n\n**•** **Immediately report suspicious incidents. You may not have adequate professional knowledge**\n\nand understanding of an attack. Therefore, it is vital to notify your organization’s cybersecurity team\n\nof any suspicious incident. An example of this is receiving Facebook messages asking you to reset your\n\npassword or informing you of unauthorized access to your email account from an unknown user.\n\n**•** **Always flag macro-laden files as “very suspicious.” Report them to your security team except if**\n\nyou regularly work with macros. Asking you to “Enable Content” is very suspicious.\n\nWhile IT and security professionals immediately understand what the message means, most users\n\ndon’t. Nonetheless, you should become familiar with this specific message (which is almost always\n\nsuspicious), as opposed to the “Protected View” message that doesn’t imply if opening a file is safe\n\nor unsafe.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### References\n\n1.
