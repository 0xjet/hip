The research\ncommunity has put considerable effort into investigating these incidents but\nhas mostly focused on detecting attacks and not delving into the reasons\nbehind these attacks.\n\nOf course, the typical cybercriminal's goal is to profit. They might compromise\nwebsites to push ransomware, or they could try and steal data—recent breaches\nshow that information is an increasingly valuable commodity. But, as this paper\ndiscusses, more emotional motivations, such as patriotism, specific real-world\nevents or simply hacktivism, can also trigger compromises.\n\nWeb defacement hacktivism is the practice of subverting a website with the\ngoal of promoting a specific agenda or political ideology. Methods may vary,\nbut when hacktivists compromise a website, the usual tactic involves replacing\nthe original page with their version—a practice that is called web defacement.\n\nHacktivism is mainly linked to web defacement, but a hacktivist (the attacker)\ncan also be involved in traffic redirection (from a legitimate site to an attacker-\nowned site), denial of service (a form of service disruption), and malware\ndistribution to support their particular cause.\n\nDedicated websites like Zone-H[1] collect evidence of web defacements and\ndefacers can voluntarily advertise their compromise by submitting a report.\n\nElaborating on the reasons behind web defacements at scale is not as easy as\nit seems. While someone could theorize that geopolitical events and conflicts\ninfluence cybercriminals’ attacks against websites and their choice of victims,\ncorroborating this phenomenon requires large-scale analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur examination of over 13 million web defacement reports against websites\nspans over 18 years, covering multiple continents. We designed an internal\nsystem that gathers, analyzes, and clusters these millions of reports. As we\nidentify the major campaigns of these defacers, we can provide further insights\ninto how geopolitical events are reflected in web defacements. We also look at\nhow different factors, such as the political beliefs and the decafers' religious\ninclination, can trigger and affect these attacks.\n\nOur first two sections provide high-level insights into our dataset of defacements,\nas well as some defining facts about the targets and tactics used by the defacers.\nOur next section on Real World Impact breaks down seven top campaigns that\nhave affected Israel, France, India, Syria, Kosovo, and countries surrounding\nthe South China Sea. We delve into specific conflicts in those areas and the\ndefacements that happened in the aftermath.\n\nThe succeeding sections cover the hacking groups' affiliations and how their\ncollectives are organized—some collectives are formed across continents, and\nsome are a loose collection of local hackers. Recruitment tools and the methods\nused to distribute hacking techniques are also discussed.\n\nThe final sections discuss other activities that defacers take part in, and\nhow the current activities may evolve. Recently, there have been incidents of\nhackers who have gone from simple web defacement to activities supporting\ncybercrime. There is a real possibility that defacers and defacement groups will\nstart to escalate their activities, move away from ideological motivations, and\nturn into cybercrime.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Our Approach to the Investigation\n\nOur objectives include exploring motivations and influences behind website defacements, focusing\n\non how geopolitical events act as triggers for web defacement activities. To better understand these\n\ndynamics globally, we gathered web defacement reports from third-party sources and processed them\n\nwith an automated system we designed specifically for this purpose.\n\nEach web defacement report consists of:\n\n1. Meta-information on the defacement, such as timestamp, website URL, the defacer's name,\n\nvulnerability, and more.\n\n2. The deface page planted by the defacer (or modified, if this is the case). The deface page comes in\n\nthe form of a source code (HTML/JS/CCS) and may contain small-sized external resources such as\n\nimages. Additional content is fetched dynamically at analysis-time.\n\nOur system automatically analyzes each deface page via two components:\n\n1. A static-code analyzer that extracts representative features (i.e., characteristics) from the page (like\n\ntitle, length, and encoding) in an offline manner.\n\n2. A dynamic-code analyzer that renders the page with a headless browser and extracts additional\n\nfeatures in an online fashion. This analyzer works better with dynamically generated pages (e.g., when\n\na link is generated via JavaScript) or pages with external content like embedded streams of songs.\n\nThe output of these components is a set of features that describe the page at high-level. These features\n\nare used as input for the following component: the campaign detector.\n\nThe campaign detector looks for defacements that—we believe—are conducted by the same actor\n\nor criminal group. This is often the case with campaigns wherein multiple actors unite and conduct\n\ndefacements that relate to each other, such as those with similar target choices or deface pages. In\n\nfact, defacers enlisted on the same campaign are usually provided with a template for rendering similar\n\n\n-----\n\ndeface pages. These templates provide consistency in promoting the criminal group and spreading the\n\ncampaign's propaganda and motivations.\n\nThis component groups similar pages accordingly, and represents them in form of clusters of web\n\ndefacement campaigns. For this process, we make use of machine learning. We apply unsupervised\n\nlearning to a set of features that well represents a summary of the pages — these are received from the\n\nstatic and dynamic analyzers mentioned before. The process automatically detects new campaigns and\n\nlabels them for inspection. The result of this processing is indexed in an elastic-search back end and\n\nvisualized via a web console. For each campaign, the console allows the analyst to inspect information\n\nlike the lifespan of the campaign, the composition of the deface pages, as well as that of their actors. The\n\nconsole also allows analysis on how criminal groups are organized and if/when a certain actor belongs\n\nto multiple groups or moves from one to another. We will discuss the details of our system in a follow-up\n\npaper that will be released later in the year.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Targets and Methods of Website Defacers\n\nAs previously stated, our work is based on a large-scale analysis of 13 million website defacements that\n\nwe collected from the following data sources:\n\n- Zone-H[2]: 12,303,240 defacement incidents\n\n- Hack-CN[3]: 386,705 defacement incidents\n\n- Mirror Zone[4] (now offline): 195,398 defacement incidents\n\n- Hack Mirror[5]: 68,980 defacement incidents\n\n- MyDeface[6] (now offline): 37,843 defacement incidents\n\n2M\n\n1.5M\n\n1M\n\n500K\n\n0\n\n1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\nFigure 1. The rate of web defacement records per year\n\nThe total number of unique defacers is 104,135, and the total number of unique compromised domains is\n\n9,929,484. Note that one domain can have multiple incidents recorded.\n\n\n-----\n\nLinux\n\nWin 2003\n\nUnknown\n\nWin 2000\n\nWin 2008\n\nApache\n\nIIS/6.0\n\nUnspecified nginx\n\nIIS/5.0\n\nUnknown\n\n\n1,548,583\n\n637,392\n\n402,076\n\n338,306\n\nFigure 2.

Web servers of defaced websites\n\n\n9,074,567\n\n8,541,048\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the metadata voluntarily provided by the defacers (which we cannot validate), here is a visual\n\nrepresentation of the class of vulnerabilities leveraged by the attackers:\n\n\nFile Inclusion Vulnerabilities\n\nSQL Injection\n\nKnown Vulnerability (i.e. unpatched system)\n\nAttack Against the Administrator/user\n(password stealing/sniffing)\n\nNot Available\n\nOther Server Intrusion\n\nOther Web Application Bug\n\nConfiguration/Administrative Error\n\nUndisclosed Vulnerability\n\nWeb Server Intrusion\n\nBrute Force Attack\n\nFTP Server Intrusion\n\nSocial Engineering\n\nURL Poisoning\n\nAccess Credentials through\nMan In the Middle Attack\n\nSSH Server Intrusion\n\nRemote Administrative Panel\nAccess through Bruteforcing\n\nShares Misconfiguration\n\nWeb Server External Module Intrusion\n\nRPC Server Intrusion\n\nOther Modes\n\n\n2,384,043\n\n\n1,268,272\n\n1,167,414\n\n1,114,541\n\n1,087,984\n\n\n842,693\n\n809,062\n\n\n493,698\n\n417,961\n\n276,443\n\n257,069\n\n252,612\n\n163,579\n\n135,700\n\n126,368\n\n114,470\n\n107,890\n\n88,403\n\n88,038\n\n80,013\n\n393,361\n\n\nFigure 4. The methods of hacking as reported by defacers, based on defacement ID Information\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Role of Social Media\n\nWe observed that defacers voluntarily leave contact information upon compromise, based on the features\n\n(i.e., characteristics) automatically extracted during the analysis of the deface pages. It seems to be\n\ncommon practice for attackers that push propaganda to advertise their beliefs and refer their “viewers” to\n\nsocial networking sites or provide contact emails of the group.\n\nOverall, we found that emails and Twitter are the primary forms of advertisement, with 25% (email) and\n\n8% (Twitter) of pages displaying at least one of these. In fact, 6% of pages have multiple contact emails.\n\nIn contrast, the telephone seems to be an unloved form of contact—only 3% of our attack records have\n\ntelephone information. Not a surprising percentage since it may expose the defacer to attribution.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of propaganda-driven attacks on websites is the addition of streaming—songs\n\nplayed in the background of the page or even visual aspects. Our data found that 32% of the defacements\n\nhave an embedded URL referencing either a streaming provider (like YouTube) or an audio file hosted on\n\nan external resource that is most likely another compromised machine. We manually investigated some\n\nof these cases and confirmed that most of these songs are related to religion.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Real-World Conflicts Reflected in Cyberspace\n\nMass attacks, or attacks that typically use automated hacking tools to compromise as many websites\n\nas possible indiscriminately, are common across the web. But in the course of our research, we noted\n\na more coordinated form of attack that we labeled “campaigns”. In a campaign, the attackers launch\n\nspecific attacks as a reaction to certain events, to push an agenda, make known their grievances, or\n\n\nspread political messages.\n\nOur system allowed us to identify the top seven campaigns connected to and motivated by real-world\n\nconflicts. In the graph below, the horizontal (X) axis pertains to the number of attackers participating in\n\na particular campaign, while the vertical (Y) axis maps the number of hacktivism-related defacements\n\non record. The data shows that the #OpIsrael campaign garnered the most number of attackers, while\n\nFree Kashmir has the most number of defacements. We will delve deeper into these campaigns in the\n\n\nsucceeding sections.\n\n20K\n\n\n15K\n\n10K\n\n\n#savesyria\n\n#antiserbs\n\n#opindia\n\n\nFree Kashmir\n\n#opisrael\n\n\n5K\n\n0\n0 100 200 300 400 500\n\n\n#opfrance\n\nSouth China Sea\n\n\nnumber of attackers\n\nFigure 5. Overview of the top seven defacement campaigns from collected data\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Conflicts Spark Anti-Israel Defacement Campaigns\n\nSo far, we've identified three major anti-Israel web defacement campaigns. The first (and the longest)\n\nis #OpIsrael, which is composed of several campaigns supported by different groups. Then there is the\n\n#OpSaveGaza campaign, which is a short, but highly effective defacement campaign in reaction to Israel's\n\nOperation Protective Edge. Last is #OpBader / #ElectronicBader / #BaderOperation, a loosely organized\n\ncampaign with multiple groups participating that has gained traction since May 2016.\n\n1,200\n\n1,000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n30/09/2011 31/05/2013 31/12/2013 30/07/2014 28/02/2015 30/09/2015 30/04/2016 31/08/2016\n\n#OpIsrael #opsavegaza #opelectronicbader...\n\nFigure 6. #OpIsrael, #opsavegaza and #opbader / #electronicbader / #baderoperation timelines\n\nThe struggle between Israel and Palestine is one of the longest modern-day conflicts, starting in 1948 and\n\ncontinuing to this day[7]. Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank and military operations in Gaza\n\nonly serve as fuel to the anger of Palestinians and other groups sympathetic to Palestine.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Target TLDs of #OpIsrael Defacements\n\nThese defacements are not random. As much as possible, the hacking groups target Israeli websites, as\n\nco.il and org.il top-level domains (TLDs) rank second and sixth respectively in the distribution of defaced\n\nwebsites carrying anti-Israel messages.\n\n6K\n\n3K\n\n0\n\ncom co.il org co.uk net ru com.au com.br de info nl fr ca it pl gov.gh hu in org.il co.za\n\nFigure 7. Target sites for #OpIsrael\n\n###### #OpIsrael\n\nThe very first #OpIsrael web defacement was made by \"imLulzPirate\" on August 26, 2012. The website\n\nmyisrael.us fell victim to the defacement, with the main page of the website altered to display a politically\n\ncharged message against Israel and Zionism. The defacement embeds a YouTube video uploaded by\n\nCanadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East, condemning the Gaza War in December 2007 –\n\nJanuary 2008.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. The first #OpIsrael defacement made by imLulzPirate\n\n#OpIsrael did not gain any traction after the initial defacement made by imLulzPirate. It took several\n\nmonths for members of the Anonymous collective to support the cause and organize a campaign against\n\nIsraeli websites.\n\nThe first organized large-scale defacement campaign happened on April 7, 2013, a date chosen because\n\nit coincides with Holocaust Remembrance Day. This attack has been repeated every year since then, with\n\n326 defacers executing 11,000 plus defacements on more than 5,400 domains.\n\n###### #OpIsrael Sub-campaigns\n\n#OpIsrael Engaged is a sub-campaign that started in 2015 and continued up to 2016. Similar to the main\n\n#OpIsrael campaign, it peaked every April 7. The AnonGhost team, a tight-knit group that claims to have\n\nmembers from Mauritania, Morocco, Malaysia, Indonesia, Tunisia, USA, and Ireland, mostly did the 2015\n\ncampaign. Anonymous Arabe, a loose group of hackers from Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle\n\nEast and North Africa, was responsible for the majority of the 2016 campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Defaced pages by AnonGhost Team and Anonymous Arabe showing identical wording for the\n#OpIsrael Engaged campaign\n\nIt is worth noting that AnonGhost seems to have either branched out to other countries or has sub\ngroups, with AnonGhost being the umbrella group. So far we've seen AnonGhostDz, which is the Algerian\n\nsub-group, AnonGhost Indonesia, AnongGhost Gaza, AnonGhost Tunisia, AnonGhost Maldives, and\n\nAnonGhost Vietnamese.\n\n#OpIsrael Decided is another sub-campaign that started around the same time as #OpIsrael Engaged,\n\nand uses a similar message. It is supported mostly by an AnonCoders team that is a loose association\n\nof hackers from Albania, Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and France, among others.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. #OpIsrael Decided defacement pages shows similar wording to #OpIsrael Engaged\n\n###### #OpBader / #ElectronicBader / #BaderOperation\n\nThis is a larger campaign with 2,759 defacement records, which is as many as the #OpIsrael Engaged\n\nand #OpIsrael Decided sub-campaigns combined. While #OpIsrael Engaged and #OpIsrael Decided had\n\nstandard templates (and the participating hackers did not do much to alter these templates), #OpBader is\n\nloosely organized, with templates and messages that vary quite significantly.\n\nThe only common identifiable string we can find related to this campaign is the use of these hashtags:\n\n#opisrael #alfallagaTeam #fallaga #fallagateam #tunisianfallagateam #opbader #electronicBader\n\n#baderoperation #hackers #fallagahackers\n\n\"Bader\" is a reference to the Battle of Badr, a significant battle won by the Prophet Muhammad in the early\n\nyears of Islam[8]. These historical references strongly indicate that these hacking groups view themselves\n\nas cyber-jihadists, viewing their actions as part of a digital jihad.\n\n###### #OpSaveGaza\n\nThe #OpSaveGaza/#SaveGaza campaign is related to #OpIsrael since both target Israel and Israeli actions\n\nin Palestinian territories, but #OpSaveGaza/#SaveGaza is mostly influenced by events in the Gaza region\n\nspecifically.\n\nOn July 2014, Israel launched Operation Protective Edge, which included airstrikes and a land invasion aimed\n\nat destroying tunnels from Gaza to Israel[9]. Not surprisingly, the first instance of #OpSaveGaza/#SaveGaza\n\nappeared in response to the land invasion. The defacements continued until October, and only when\n\nhostilities in the Gaza strip subsided significantly did the 2014 campaign die down. #OpSaveGaza had\n\n3,415 defacements within that short period, making it one of the most active web defacement campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Sample defacement pages of the #OpSaveGaza campaign\n\n###### #Save Gaza\n\n#Save Gaza started in July of 2016 as a sub-campaign under #opBader, primarily driven by Anonymous\n\nGhost Gaza. Among the sub-campaigns discussed, it has been the most vocal and the most forceful.\n\nWhile #OpIsrael Decided and #OpIsrael Engaged use relatively tame language, #Save Gaza incites\n\nviolence and puts direct pressure on Israelis, threatening to steal credit card information, bank credentials,\n\nand other website credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Forceful language in the defacement campaign #Save Gaza\n\nIt is worth noting that Anonymous Ghost Gaza followed through on their threat to steal the personal\n\ninformation of Israeli citizens. Members of Anonymous Ghost Gaza posted Israeli citizens' credit card\n\ninformation and online account credentials on their Facebook page and Pastebin.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Hacking groups publicly expose Israeli citizens’ information and financial details\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Groups behind the Campaigns\n\nHackers and hacking groups participating in #OpIsrael campaigns are mostly from Arabic-speaking\n\ncountries in the Middle East and North Africa, with other groups from Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia\n\nalso participating. Note that these are countries that do not recognize the validity of Israel as a state.\n\n\nAnonGhost\n\n\nfallaga team\n\n\nCapoO_TunisiAnoO\n\n\nAnonymous Arabe\n\n\nDr.T3rr0r Memberal_Force\n\nHitch |N|ewbieC27 VandaThe\nGod\n\n\nGAZA\n\n\nMrHax\n\n\nMohamad\nBseso\n\n\nFallaga Team\n\n\nBlack\nWorm\n\n\nDexmoD\n\n\nFigure 14. Top 15 participating hacking groups and hackers\n\nThe common use of the name \"fallaga\" by hackers and hacking groups in North Africa is a reference to\n\n\"felaghas\" or \"fellagha\", armed groups that were instrumental in driving out the French from Algeria in the\n\nAlgerian War that lasted from the 1950s to early 1960s.\n\n###### Charlie Hebdo Aftermath Results in #OpFrance\n\nOn January 7, 2015, two men attacked Charlie Hebdo, a French magazine that caused controversy\n\nseveral times in the past through its satirical cartoons about Islam and the prophet Muhammad. The\n\nattack left 12 people dead and 11 injured[10]. In the aftermath, France was a target of other attacks, this\n\ntime in cyberspace. The smaller campaigns under #OpFrance include #OpCharlie, #OPCHARLIEHEBDO,\n\nand #AntiCharlieHebdo.\n\n\n-----\n\n350\n\n175\n\n\n0\n\n\nFigure 15. Timeline of #OpFrance—activity peaked January to March 2015, right after the Charlie Hebdo\nattacks\n\n###### Target TLDs of #OpFrance Defacements\n\n\nSimilar to the attacks against Israel, #OpFrance hackers were trying to target French websites, as\n\nevidenced by .fr domains having the second-most domains that had sites defaced.\n\n\n500\n\n250\n\n\n0\n\n\ncom fr org ru dk net nl com.br de info com.ua eu co.uk pl be ca gr com.ar gouv.fr in\n\n\nFigure 16. Target sites for #OpFrance\n\nThis campaign focused on French websites, with defacers targeting sites of companies like the French\n\nsupermarket Carrefour, or sites with .fr TLDs. From our data, 36% of #OpFrance defacements have .fr\n\n\nTLDs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Defacement pages for the #OpFrance campaign\n\nHacking groups from Muslim-majority countries such as Tunisia, Syria, Mauritania, Morocco, Bangladesh\n\nand Indonesia began targeting French websites in an #OpFrance web defacement campaign that appear\n\nto be in support of the attacks. Some of the defacements even paraphrased Saudi-Australian Islamic\n\npreacher Junaid Thorne's statement on the matter, “If you want to enjoy 'freedom of speech' with no\n\nlimits, expect others to exercise 'freedom of action.'”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18. Defaced page promoting Islamic preachers’ statement on Charlie Hebdo\n\nEven though several groups were part of #OpFrance, the Middle East Cyber Army was particularly active\n\nand did the majority of the defacements. This group includes members that belong to other hacking\n\ngroups such as Anonymous Arabe and some hackers from North Africa.\n\nIt is worth noting that one suspected member of the Middle East Cyber Army was arrested several months\n\nafter the January – March #OpFrance campaign. The Bulgarian police arrested a 21-year-old Syrian\n\nstudent residing in Bulgaria, believed to be the leader of the group[11]. Based on the defacement pages of\n\nMiddle East Cyber Army, the hacker with the alias \"The Greatest\" was arrested. The group modified their\n\ndefacement pages to include #OPSaveTheGreatest after the arrest.\n\nFigure 19. Defaced page modified to support “The Greatest”, who was supposedly arrested in Bulgaria\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Groups Behind the Campaigns\n\nThe visualization below shows the Middle East Cyber Army to be the most active group behind #OpFrance.\n\nAnonGhost, which was active in the anti-Israel defacements, also widely participated, as well as hackers\n\nfrom Mauritius (Mauritania Coder), and some from Bangladesh and Indonesia.\n\n\nMiddle East Cyber Army Mauritania\ncoder\n\n\nProsox\n\n\nMrAhSan\nHaXor\n\n\nMr.bz\n\n\nHani Xavi\n\n\nOwner Dzz\n\n\nZeSn Rexal\nScooterist\n\n\nAmine\nMoodz\n\n\nAnonGhost\n\n\nCasablanca\nHaxorz\n\n\nAnoaGhost\n\n\nBL4CKT3RRORIST\n\n\nHexlook\n\n\nFigure 20.

The unresolved dispute with Pakistan regarding Kashmir and Jammu, as well as the challenges\n\nof patrolling and enforcing the border between India and Bangladesh (the fifth longest land border in the\n\nworld), makes for a volatile situation. It's further exacerbated by constant defacements between Pakistani\n\nand Indian hacking groups, and between Bangladeshi and Indian hacking groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n500\n\n250\n\n0\n\n\n###### Target TLD’s of #OpIndia\n\ncom in ac.in co.in org net org.in edu.in gov.in co info net.in biz lk ch com.ar hu Other biz.id by\n\nFigure 21.

Tharoor reportedly felt Bangladesh was a weaker team that would give\n\nIndia an easier path to the finals.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. Defacement page for #OpIndia with an image of the Bangladesh cricket team featured\n\nFigure 23. The Tharoor tweet that started the controversy\n\n###### Free Kashmir\n\nLed by Pakistani hacking groups ZCompany Hacking Crew (ZHC) and Muslim Liberation Army, Free\n\nKashmir is a long-standing campaign that started in 2011. The attacks began with the calling out of the\n\nillegal occupation and human rights abuses the Indian Armed Forces committed against Kashmiris[12].\n\nFree Kashmir has the most number of defacements out of all the campaigns studied, despite having only\n\naround half the number of attackers that #OpIsrael had.\n\n\n-----\n\nPakistan is India's rival claimant to the disputed territory of Kashmir, and the defacement pages of both\n\nZHC and Muslim Liberation Army commonly quote India's Penal Code Act No. 45 of 1860, which does\n\nnot include the State of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India. However, the ruler of Jammu and Kashmir,\n\nMaharaja Hari Singh, acceded both territories to India in 1947[13].\n\nFigure 24. Free Kashmir campaign defacements\n\nThe messages of ZHC and the Muslim Liberation Army have a Pakistani slant and do not necessarily\n\nreflect the sentiments of the Kashmiri people. However, they may gain traction with younger Kashmiris as\n\nZHC and Muslim Liberation Army also highlight the human rights abuses and disappearances of Kashmiri\n\nactivists and militants[14], an issue that has not received international attention.\n\n###### Nationalism Inspires Retaliatory Hacking\n\nIt is also quite common for hacking groups in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to start defacement\n\ncampaigns against their rival country's websites. The presence of active hacking groups in neighboring,\n\nconflicting countries makes for a volatile situation, and these \"turf wars\" or \"nationalistic defacements\"\n\ncan easily be triggered, and in a lot of cases, get out of hand.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne such incident happened in 2015 when a Pakistani hacker named Faisal 1337 hacked into multiple\n\nIndian websites. The government website of the state of Kerala was the most prominent website defaced.\n\nFigure 25. Indian local government websites hacked\n\nImmediately, hacking groups from India launched #op_pak_cyber_space, defacing hundreds of Pakistani\n\nwebsites in retaliation.\n\nFigure 26. Retaliatory attack from Indian hackers\n\nThe defacement of Mumbai Airport Customs website by Pakistani defacer Alone Injector is another\n\nexample. After the incident, Indian hackers retaliated with a campaign defacing the websites for Islamabad,\n\nPeshawar, Multan and Karachi airports in Pakistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27. Mumbai Airport Customs defacement\n\nFigure 28. The defacement page seen on Islamabad, Peshawar, Multan and Karachi airport websites\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fallout of the Attacks between India and its Neighbors\n\nAside from ongoing campaigns by Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi hackers (against or in response to\n\neach other's hacking), the real-world conflict between the three countries has significantly increased in\n\nthe past two years.\n\nOne event happened on January 2, 2016, when several terrorists attacked India's Pathankot Air Force\n\nbase, killing several Indian military men and one civilian. The attack was later claimed and attributed to\n\nJaish-e-Mohammed, a separatist group in Kashmir[15]. After the attack, Indian hacking groups retaliated by\n\ntargeting Pakistani websites.\n\nFigure 29. Retaliatory defacements made by Team Indian Black Hats aka Indian Cyber Devils\n\nOn September 18, 2016, attackers from Jaish-e-Mohammed, the same terror group responsible for the\n\nPathankot Air Base attack a few months prior, launched another attack on an Indian army headquarters in\n\nUri that left 17 army members dead, as well as all four attackers[16]. A few days later, the Indian government\n\nlaunched surgical strikes targeting locations in Kashmir.\n\nThese series of incidents sparked back and forth campaigns between Indian and Pakistani hacking\n\ngroups, with defacements containing politically charged messages, freedom slogans, or just plain hate\n\nspeech.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 30. Defacements generated by conflict with India\n\nAnother event that triggered a sizeable defacement campaign was the drafting of Nepal’s new constitution\n\nin September 2015. Some in India believed that the constitution marginalized certain ethnic groups; an\n\nissue that was highlighted when the Indian Express reported that India requested Nepal to make seven\n\namendments to its constitution[17]. The report triggered an outrage in Nepal, as the message was seen as\n\na foreign country meddling in the internal affairs of an independent sovereignty.\n\nThe outrage triggered the #BackOffIndia campaign during October 2015, supported by DQN hacker and\n\ncraXerbikash from Nepal, BloodSecurity from the Philippines, and several Pakistani hackers.\n\nFigure 31. A campaign triggered by India’s involvement with Nepalese matters\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Groups behind the Attacks\n\nThe most prominent anti-India defacements came from RiseOfTheTigers, a collective that was created just\n\nfor the #OpIndia campaign in March 2015. Several Bangladeshi hacking groups joined RiseOfTheTigers:\n\nBangladesh Grey Hat Hackers, Bangladesh Cyber Army, Team_CC, Bangladesh Script Kiddie Hackers,\n\nBlacksmith Hackers Team, 3xp1re Cyber Army, Bangladesh Black Hat Hackers, and others.\n\n\nRiseOfTheTigers Mr Anonymous\n\n\nCriminal.BD\n\n\nMr Anon\n\n\nRed Lizard\n\n\nrootheater\n\n\nXl33tX_Sn4p3R\n\n\nMrAhSan HaXor\n\n\nZero Cool\n\n\nGhost_Root\n\n\nMr.Sh4hz3b-HaXoR\n\n\nZain pk_Robot dulava!\nHaxor\n\n\ndulava!\n\n\nMr. Bangladesh\n\n\nFigure 32. Top 15 participating hacking groups and hackers\n\n###### Military Actions prompt a #SaveSyria Campaign\n\nOn April 22, 2016, the Syrian government launched airstrikes targeting residential areas in Aleppo during\n\nFriday scheduled prayers. The attacks happened despite a ceasefire agreement by both sides in February\n\n2016. There were several more airstrikes, the worst of which hit the al-Quds hospital, killing 50 people[18].\n\nThe incident inspired a #SaveSyria campaign that exposed graphic images of wounded civilians in Aleppo.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Target TLDs of #SaveSyria\n\n1,500\n\n750\n\n0\n\nru com de it net org fr gr nl com.br co.uk kz by ch com.ua pl fi eu be info\n\nFigure 33. Targeted domains of #SaveSyria\n\nMost of the #SaveSyria defacements targeted Russian websites because many suspected that Russia\n\nwas behind the April 2016 airstrikes. Russia is seen as supportive of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad,\n\nand the country has reinforced Assad's regime through air superiority assets.\n\nFigure 34. Defaced sites showing graphic images of Aleppo\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Fallaga Team formed a loose collective called the Tunisian Cyber Resistance Al Fallaga Team, composed\n\nof Tunisian hackers and actively supported by hackers from Anonymous Arabe, Algeria, and Indonesia.\n\nThey launched a defacement campaign with the hashtags #StopTheHolocaust, #AleppoIsBurning,\n\n#SaveAleppo and #SaveSyria.\n\n\n###### Campaigns Provoked by Kosovo Disputes\n\nKosovo is a disputed territory and partially recognized state that declared its independence from Serbia\n\nin 2008. The majority of its population is of Albanian descent, and the country enjoys friendly relations\n\nwith Albania stemming from common history and traditions. In Northern Kosovo, near Serbia, there\n\nare communities of Serbian descent that refuse to acknowledge Kosovo's independence. This tension\n\nreached a boiling point in 2011 when Kosovo Police clashed with ethnic Serbian rioters who refused to\n\n\nremove roadblocks going into enclaves of Serbian control[19].\n\nAlbanian hacking groups KSG-CREW, kwgdeface and AlbanianHackers launched the #AntiSerbs\n\ncampaign a few months after the initial clashes. The campaign died down before the Brussels Agreement,\n\nwhich involved the integration of Northern Kosovo into Kosovo and had Kosovo Serbs manning the police\n\n\nand judiciary, was concluded.\n\n400\n\n\n200\n\n0\n\n\nFigure 35. Timeline of anti-Serbs campaign\n\nThe defacement pages showed support for Kosovo independence, and also mentioned contested towns\n\ncommonly involved in civil unrest. They listed Serbian-controlled territories bordering Kosovo with an\n\n\nAlbanian majority and declared their desire to separate from Serbia and join Kosovo.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 36. Web defacement pages supporting Kosovo\n\n###### Disputes in the South China Sea\n\n OpPhilippines and OpTaiwan\n\nOn May 9, 2013, a maritime incident involving the Taiwanese fishing boat Guang Da Xing No. 28 and the\n\nPhilippine Coast Guard resulted in the death of Taiwanese fisherman Hung Shih-cheng (洪石成)[20]. This\n\nincident led to many consequences, including sanctions and a military drill from Taiwan government,\n\nprotests in Taiwan, and several cyberattacks.\n\nOn May 10, 2013, people in Taiwan called for DDoS attacks against .gov.ph to force the Philippine\n\ngovernment into issuing an official apology. Many hackers responded, attacking more than 30 .gov.ph\n\nsites[21].\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 37. Forum post mobilizing visitors to launch DDoS attack\n\nOn May 11, Filipino hacker \"Pinoy Vendetta\"[22] sent a warning message to Taiwanese hackers by\n\ndefacing one Taiwan government site and several commercial sites. In response, AnonTaiwan launched\n\n#OpPhilippines the next day.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 38. Web defacement page from \"PinoyVendetta\"\n\nAfter the attack, AnonTaiwan posted leaked data from .gov.ph sites on Pastebin. One noteworthy victim\n\nwas dns.gov.ph, which is the .gov.ph domain registry website. More than 2,300 accounts, which were\n\npossible admin accounts for .gov.ph domains, were leaked. These government sites faced a huge risk.\n\nPotentially, attackers could change the name servers of domain names, government domain names would\n\nhave resolved to invalid IP addresses, and important sites would have been inaccessible to the public.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 39. Information leaked on Pastebin\n\nOn May 25, 2013, Filipino hackers attacked 31 .tw sites in a campaign titled #OpTaiwan as a response to\n\n#OpPhilippines. The defaced pages displayed the messages, \"Stop attacking our cyberspace\" and \"Let\n\nour government handle this problem.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 40. Web defacement pages for #OpTaiwan\n\n###### Defacements over Territory\n\nSix countries—China, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei—are contesting several islands\n\nand features, rock outcrops, sandbars, and reefs in the South China Sea.\n\nOver the last few years, the tension between China and Vietnam, and China and Philippines has increased.\n\nChina has taken aggressive action, from coast guard patrols to building facilities and installations in\n\nvarious contested areas. This has sparked defacement activities by several groups from Philippines,\n\nVietnam, and China against their rival countries' websites.\n\n**Attacker** **Team**\n\n越南国宰相 1937cn\n\noaddah 1937cn\n\nZeSn Anonymous Philippines\n\nYoCo Smart Silic Group\n\nNama Defacer Anonymous Philippines\n\nAnonReaper Anonymous Philippines\n\nBloodSecurity BloodSecurity\n\nHukbalaHack Anonymous Philippines\n\nAnonymous Philippines Anonymous Philippines\n\nAlfabetoVirtual 1937cn\n\nFigure 41.

This incident triggered defacement attacks that started on June 3, 2011. A Vietnamese defacer\n\n'Mr.N - Cubi11' attacked Chinese government websites. The page displayed Vietnamese patriotic slogans\n\nlike \"Vietnamese People is Willing to Sacrifice to Protect the Sea, Sky, and Nation.\" More Vietnamese\n\ndefacers joined this campaign after[24].\n\nFigure 42. Vietnamese defacer page\n\nFrom June 4, 2011, Chinese defacers started to retaliate by attacking .vn websites. Hongke Union (HUC),\n\na well-known Chinese hacktivist group, mobilized its members and launched a series of attacks. Over 30\n\n.gov.vn sites were defaced.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 43. Chinese defacers retaliate\n\nAfter completing the attacks, the HUC sent out a summary reporting that their attacks were from June 4\n\nto June 5, two function groups were created (one for DDoS, one for defacement), and several QQ chat\n\ngroups and YY chat channels were created to coordinate attacks[25].\n\nSome non-HUC hackers also joined the attack, compromising over 1,000 sites. Most of the victims\n\nsuffered DDoS attacks and defacement. One popular Vietnamese search engine site was inaccessible for\n\nfive hours. During the attacks, HUC found Vietnamese defacers attacking .cn sites.\n\nChinese hacker group Silic also joined the retaliation. In their deface pages, Silic claimed that \"(Vietnamese\n\ndefacers) first stir up trouble, we just attack back.\" This group attacked 98 .vn websites on June 8. Most\n\nvictims were .gov.vn sites[26].\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 44. Silic Group defacement page\n\n###### OpChinaDown, 2012\n\nOn April 10, 2012, a standoff between the Philippine Navy and Chinese maritime surveillance ships over\n\nthe disputed Scarborough Shoal (Huangyan in Chinese) in the South China Sea caused tension between\n\nthe two countries. In response, Chinese defacers compromised the website of the University of the\n\nPhilippines on April 20, 2012, leaving a message that claimed, “We come from China! Huangyan Island\n\nis Ours”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 45. Defaced page of University of the Philippines\n\nThe defacer group \"Anonymous #OccupyPhilippines\" responded on the same day, compromising several\n\n.cn sites. The statement \"Scarborough Shoal is ours!\" was prominent on the deface page[27].\n\nThree days later, on April 23, the government of the Philippines claimed that two of its sites suffered DDoS\n\nattacks coming from Chinese IP addresses—an apparent retaliatory attack from China. Defacements\n\nescalated quickly, triggered by the DDoS attacks[28].\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 46. Page from #OccupyPhilippines\n\nOn the same day, OccupyPhilippines and PrivateX launched a joint attack operation \"#OpChinaDown\".\n\nThey attacked .gov.cn sites and posted DB schema and login credentials of victim sites on Pastebin.\n\nOn April 25, the Silic group (the same organization that attacked .vn sites in 2011) joined the web\n\ndefacement campaign and targeted .gov.ph sites. Besides derogatory statements against Philippine\n\ndefacers, the page allowed visitors to leave messages on it. Over the course of 3 hours, over 30 visitors\n\nleft messages on the defaced pages[29].\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 47. Silic defacement page, where you can leave messages\n\nChinese hacktivism group 1937cn joined the defacement war on June 1, 2012. This group created a very\n\nlong deface page to convince viewers to believe in their message. 1937cn spread that page across 173\n\nsites in five days.\n\n###### StopReclamation and OpChina, 2015\n\nChina started reclamation and building on the Spratly archipelago of the South China Sea in April 2015[30].\n\nThis action caused a wave of defacement attacks. BloodSec, a Philippine defacer group, launched a\n\n#StopReclamation campaign on April 26, 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 48. BloodSec defacement page\n\nTensions escalated a month later. Posting on Pastebin[31], defacers from the Philippines and Vietnam\n\ndeclared the beginning of an #OpChina campaign on May 28, 2015. In the announcement, they called\n\nthemselves \"the united hackers from the Philippines and Vietnam,\" aiming to \"protest your (China) unjust\n\nactions over the South China Sea\". At the end of the announcement, they left a note that read \"Expect\n\nus! 5/30/2015\".\n\nFigure 49. Joint message from Vietnamese and Filipino hackers, and their defacement pages\n\nThis is the first time defacers from the two South East Asian countries united for a common political cause.\n\nA series of attacks hit .cn sites on the date stated in their warning message—August 30, 2015. Most of\n\nthe victims were .gov.cn sites. The message left by the group Anonymous Philippines asked the Chinese\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernment to \"stop the reclamation, do not put or establish any structure in that location.\" At the same\n\ntime, \"AnonGhost\" from Vietnam put out the message, \"Stop the infringements of sovereignty island.\"\n\nFigure 50. Retaliation from Chinese hackers\n\nOn the same day, Chinese defacer team \"1937cn\" retaliated by defacing .vn sites, and blamed it on the\n\njoint action of defacers from Philippines and Vietnam. 1937cn also claimed that \"South China Sea is\n\nChina's inherent territory.\" 1937cn's response was very quick—they likely noted the joint announcement\n\nof the defacers from the Philippines and Vietnam, and carefully prepared the retaliation.\n\n###### Attacks on Vietnamese Airports, 2016\n\nOn July 12, 2016, the Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of the Philippines against\n\nChina in an arbitration case about the disputes in the South China Sea. The ruling triggered a series of\n\ncyberattacks against Vietnam[32].\n\nOn July 29, 2016, the Chinese hacker group 1937cn attacked two major airports in Vietnam and the\n\nwebsite of Vietnam Airlines[33]. They defaced the home page with the same page used in 2015 during the\n\n#OpChina defacement campaign. Then the hacker group leaked client information of Vietnam Airlines[34].\n\nThis was not the first time 1937cn attacked Vietnam Airlines; the group also launched a similar attack on\n\nMay 30, 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 51. Client information from Vietnam Airlines\n\nThe Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam reported several attacks, supposedly from 1937cn team, on\n\ntwo Vietnam airports within the same day. The IT system for the check-ins of Vietnam Airlines at Tan Son\n\nNhat International Airport was attacked and stopped working. The deface page, which was the same\n\npage used on the Vietnam Airlines website, replaced the flight information screens at Noi Bai International\n\nAirport. The speaker system at Noi Bai airport was also compromised by hackers for a few minutes,\n\nduring which the speakers broadcast an announcement against territory dispute. According to the Civil\n\nAviation Administration of Vietnam, the attack caused the delay of 100 flights, affecting thousands of\n\npassengers[35].\n\nThis incident might hint at future hacktivism trends: to reach a wider audience, hacktivists could potentially\n\nbroaden their targets from traditional websites to critical infrastructures such as airports.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Hacking Groups’ Connections and Campaigns\n\nDeface groups are formed by a loose affiliation between hackers. They can be defined as \"loose\" since\n\nhackers can be affiliated with one or more of these hacking groups, even across territories.\n\n\nIndonesian\nCode Party\n\ngunz_berry Moroccan Ethical\nHackers\n\n\nVirus Noir darkshadow-tn Albania\nAttacker\n\n\nAnonCoders Myanmar Noob\nHackers\n\n\nFallaga Team Anonymous\nAlbania\n\n\nArab Warriors\nTeam\n\n\ndr.t3rror\n\nAnonghosts\n\n\nFigure 52. The hacking group AnonCoders\n\nAs an example, see the group AnonCoders, which lists gunz_berry, Virus Noir, darkshadow-tn, Albania\n\nAttacker and dr.t3rr0r as its core members. However, gunz_berry is also affiliated with Indonesian Code\n\nParty, while Virus Noir is affiliated with Moroccan Ethical Hackers, darkshadow-tn with Fallaga Team, and\n\ndr.t3rr0r with Myanmar Noob Hackers. Albania Attacker is affiliated with three other groups—Anonymous\n\nAlbania, Arab Warriors Team, and Anonghosts. AnonCoders shows how hackers can also be members of\n\nvarious groups, and how hackers from different countries can form a group.\n\nOther examples showing the liquidity of group membership are Pakistan's two biggest hacking groups:\n\nZCompany Hacking Crew and Muslim Liberation Army. Both have fairly large teams; ZCompany Hacking\n\nCrew has at least 30 members, and Muslim Liberation Army has around 26. Below you can see seven\n\nhackers who are members of both groups simultaneously, as we've seen defacements made by both\n\nteams acknowledging the hackers in their defacement pages within the same time frame.\n\n\n-----\n\nPak Jaguars Hawk\n\n\nfAchO HyP3r-Boy Jerry Faisy AliLaghari\nHassan\n\n\nFigure 53. Members of the ZCompany Hacking Crew and the Muslim Liberation Army\n\n###### Collectives\n\nHacking groups can also band together to form bigger groups or collectives. The well-known group\n\nAnonymous is a model for this. They can rightly be considered the biggest hacking collective in the\n\nworld based on the numerous hacking groups who identify and associate themselves with the name\n\n“Anonymous”.\n\nOn a smaller scale, a collective can be formed simply to support a campaign. Take, for example, the\n\ndefacements done by Bangladeshi hackers against Indian websites, triggered by the Cricket World Cup.\n\nThe collective Rise of the Tigers was borne out of various Bangladeshi hacking groups working together:\n\n3xp1r3 Cyber Army, Blacksmith Hacker's Team, Cyb3r Command0S, Bangladesh Grey Hat Hackers,\n\nBangladesh Black HAT Hackers, Cyber Sword and Bangladesh Script Kidde Hackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Campaign Recruitment and Tools\n\nCertain individuals or groups loosely organize hacktivism campaigns. They set time frames for a particular\n\ncampaign, and even use social media to coordinate and launch these campaigns.\n\nFigure 54. Facebook calendar used to schedule defacement activities\n\nFigure 55. Social media post used to spread templates for defacement scripts\n\n\n-----\n\nThey use calendar event features like Facebook Events to organize campaigns. They also advertise\n\ncampaigns on their team pages and actively recruit other hackers and hacking groups to participate.\n\nTools, targets, and defacement page templates are also shared openly by those participating in a campaign.\n\nFigure 56. Tools spread through social media and sharing sites\n\n\n-----\n\nCertain groups also set up team websites to host content, post announcements, and facilitate discussions\n\nthrough forums. These commonly have sections for tutorials, tools, and kits.\n\nFigure 57. Different community sites hosting forums, downloads, news and more\n\n\n-----\n\n## Auxiliary Activities of Defacement Groups\n\nBesides tools and defacement templates, these groups also share attack techniques. For example, groups\n\npost hacking tutorials on GitHub and upload tutorial videos to streaming sites.\n\nFigure 58. Tools and tutorials for different hacking activities shared by defacers\n\n\n-----\n\nDefacers are also contributing to Exploit-DB, which is is an open-source database for sharing exploit codes\n\nand security papers. To find the number of defacers that are also active on Exploit-DB, we compared our\n\nlist of known defacers against this list of authors[36] from Exploit-DB:\n\n- Total defacer/hacker alias that are also listed as Exploit-DB authors: 790 of 7,858 (10.05%)\n\n- PoC submitted by possible defacers: 6,380 of 36,576 (17.44%)\n\n\nindoushka\n\nZoRLu\n\najann\n\ncr4wl3r\n\nHussin X\n\nCWH Underground\n\nt0pP8uZz\n\nAtT4CKxT3rR0r1ST\n\nJosS\n\nHACKERS PAL\n\nMr.SQL\n\nEgiX\n\nbd0rk\n\nCoBRa_21\n\nInjEctOr5\n\n\n96\n\n74\n\n69\n\n68\n\n67\n\n65\n\n64\n\n63\n\nFigure 59.

Breakdown of exploit types submitted by possible defacers\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Escalating into Real-World Terrorism Activities\n\nHackers who participate in defacement and also other forms of hacking can also segue into more serious\n\ncrimes, possibly also driven by real-world disputes and political agendas. An example would be the case\n\nof Team P0ison's founder Junaid Hussain (TriCk), who started notable defacements in 2010.\n\nFigure 61. Sample of defaced pages done by TriCk supporting Free Kashmir\n\nHussain was arrested in 2014 for hacking into Katie Kay's (special advisor to British Prime Minister Tony\n\nBlair) email account and leaking PM Blair's personal information[37]. After six months in jail, Junaid Hussain\n\ntraveled to Syria and joined ISIS. He took the name Abu Hussain al-Britani, and is believed to be the\n\nperson behind the hack of U.S. Central Command's Twitter and YouTube accounts. He is also believed to\n\nhave been killed in a US air strike in Syria in 2015[38].\n\n###### Defaced Sites as Unwitting Infection Sources\n\nAside from actively committing criminal activities, defacement pages can unwitting carriers of malware\n\ncode. In the course of our research, we saw the malware Ramnit distributed through malicious websites\n\nor packaged as fake software installers. Ramnit is an actively developed malware family whose main goal\n\nis to steal banking credentials. It also evolved to include worm propagation capabilities, as well as the\n\nability to infect files, including HTML files. Ramnit does this by appending a VBscript code at the end of\n\nthe HTML file found in the affected machine. The infected HTML file contains code to install a copy of the\n\nRamnit malware.\n\nUnfortunately, some defacers’ machines were infected by Ramnit and had their web defacement\n\ntemplates infected to include the malicious VBscript. This, in turn, made their defacement pages unwitting\n\ndistributors of the Ramnit malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our records, 9,726 defacements were seen to include the Ramnit VBscript. Below are the top 30\n\ndefacers who were infected by Ramnit and had their compromised web defacement pages distribute the\n\nmalware. Most of the defacers were either from Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle East and North\n\nAfrica or from China.

Defacers who were unknowingly spreading Ramnit through their defacement pages\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs seen in the examples above, real-world conflict can trigger web defacement on a large scale. One event\n\ncan lead to a campaign that brings hacking groups together, and large collectives can sustain defacement\n\ncampaigns for long periods of time. Most are politically or religiously motivated, and attackers are typically\n\nkeen to express fervent patriotism over specific causes. While these web defacement activities seem\n\nrelatively benign, it is plausible for defacers to move on to other hacking activities and criminal behavior.\n\n###### Web Defacements and IoT\n\nWeb defacements are going to continue in the foreseeable future, and may even become more prevalent\n\nas more Internet of Things (IoT) devices are connected online.\n\nFigure 63. Router control panel replaced with a hacker’s page\n\n\n-----\n\nThe above screenshot shows a defaced router control panel, changing the title of the HTML page to \"You\n\nhacked from iraq(fb\\arakan\".\n\nA lot of people may not realize that IoT devices have stripped down versions of web servers that host\n\ntheir control panels and management consoles. The setup is something that would be relatively easy for\n\na defacer to exploit and compromise. In the case of the router defacement above, the attacker might not\n\neven have known that he was able to deface a non-traditional/IoT website.\n\nExploits for vulnerabilities of common web applications or server components are also applicable and\n\neffective on non-traditional/IoT websites. It would be simple for a defacer to transition into compromising\n\nconnected IoT devices. With the growing number of IoT devices, it might be appealing for defacers to\n\ncontinue down that route.\n\n###### Hacktivism in the Future\n\nThere are various vulnerabilities that attackers exploit to deface websites to push their specific agenda.\n\nBut despite compromising these web sites that contain potentially sensitive data (PII, account credentials,\n\ntransaction histories, etc), most defacers have yet to abuse their access further. They are seemingly\n\ncontent just to deface the site. However, the delineation between pure web defacement and cybercriminal\n\nor cyberespionage activity is disappearing. Hackers are now increasingly involved in developing web\n\nshells (backdoors to maintain access to compromised web servers), and also delving into doxing and\n\nleaking stolen data. After defacing websites, the next step would seem to be capitalizing on the available\n\ninformation on compromised sites.\n\nApart from individuals, defacement groups have yet to monetize their activities. According to our data,\n\n99.9% of the web defacement pages are harmless. Pages found containing malicious code are mostly\n\ninfected by VBS_RAMNIT.SMC. These pages were unknowingly infected, and not intentionally put online\n\nto spread malicious code. These defacers had their templates infected by the malware and unwittingly\n\nspread the Ramnit malware.\n\nA troubling scenario is if these defacement groups decide to monetize their successful hacks by, for\n\nexample, installing malicious redirections or exploit code in the defacement pages that would then install\n\nransomware. As previously mentioned, so far these defacements have been benign and motivated by\n\nreal-world conflicts or political agendas. However, cybercriminals could easily use hacks for profit-driven\n\ncriminal activities.\n\nWe have already seen some instances of this. There were reports of Indian hackers targeting Pakistani\n\nservers and users to install ransomware for \"patriotic\" purposes[39]. If this continues and escalates, then the\n\nline between defacers, hacktivists, and cybercriminals will become even more blurred.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### How can enterprises protect their sites?\n\nBased on the major vulnerabilities used by defacers, there are simple steps\n\nthat can secure servers against these threats. If practiced and deployed\n\nconsistently, these tips can help enterprises have long-term security:\n\n- Ensure that basic security policies are employed and maintained long\nterm: strong passwords, proper administration security policies, and\n\ncorrect configuration.\n\n- Use web application firewalls to filter, monitor, and block malicious\n\ntraffic. Security is necessary at the web application level.\n\n- Practice secure coding. Organizations must implement secure coding\n\nstandards on all their sites.\n\n- Regularly use testing tools to ensure deployed codes are secure.\n\n- Make patching systems and networks a part of standard policy. This\n\nprevents cybercriminals from exploiting vulnerabilities in unpatched/\n\noutdated software.\n\n- Regularly scan web applications for vulnerabilities: Organizations need\n\nto check their web apps for vulnerabilities as these can lead to SQL\n\ninjection and cross-site scripting attacks.\n\n- Use multi-layered protection that secures vulnerable websites from\n\nthe common attacks used by defacers. Solutions like Trend Micro™\n\nDeep Security™ and Vulnerability Protection provides virtual patching\n\nthat protects servers and endpoints from threats that may abuse\n\nvulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### References\n\n1.
