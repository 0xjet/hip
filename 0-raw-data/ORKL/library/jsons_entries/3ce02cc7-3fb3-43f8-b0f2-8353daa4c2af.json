They were responsible for the compromise of security firm Bit9’s digital code-signing certificate which was used to sign malware. The Bit9 breach was part of the much larger VOHO campaign and that campaign was just one of many operations undertaken by the group over the last four years.\n\n The group likely offers a “hackers for hire” operation and is tasked with retrieving specific information from a wide range of corporate and government targets. They are a highly efficient team who can undertake multiple campaigns at once, breach some of the world’s best-protected organizations and can change their tactics quickly to achieve their goal. They usually attack using multiple customized Trojans designed for specific purposes. Backdoor.Moudoor is used for larger campaigns and has seen widespread distribution while Trojan.Naid is reserved for special operations against high value targets. The group uses cutting-edge attack techniques which makes this team stand out from other major attack groups.\n\n This paper takes an in-depth look at the Hidden Lynx group, their targets and their motivations. It will look into their capabilities and attack strategies through their attack campaigns including the Bit9 incident.\n\n\n-----\n\n### BACKGROUND\n\n## A well-known group with affiliations to “Operation Aurora” managed to break into Bit9’s network using an SQL injection attack\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Background\n\nIn February 2013, Bit9 released a statement revealing that in July 2012, their network had been compromised by\na malicious third-party. A well-known group named Hidden Lynx with affiliations to “Operation Aurora” managed\nto break into Bit9’s network using an SQL injection attack. These Trojans made their way into the defense\nindustrial sector.\n\nHowever, the Bit9 compromise was only a small piece of a much larger watering-hole operation known as the\nVOHO campaign, which impacted hundreds of organizations in the United States. Further, the VOHO campaign\nitself was just one campaign of many that is attributable to this incredibly prolific group. Each campaign is\ndesigned to access information in governmental and commercial organizations that tend to operate in the\nwealthiest and most technologically advanced countries in the world.\n\n#### Who are the Hidden Lynx group?\n\nThe Hidden Lynx group has been in operation since at least 2009 and is most likely a professional organization\nthat offers a “hackers for hire” service. They have the capability to attack many organizations with concurrently\nrunning campaigns. They operate efficiently and move quickly and methodically. Based on these factors, the\nHidden Lynx group would need to be a sizeable organization made up of between 50 and 100 individuals.\n\nThe members of this group are experts at breaching systems. They engage in a two-pronged strategy of mass\nexploitation and pay-to-order targeted attacks for intellectual property using two Trojans designed specifically\nfor each purpose:\n\n        - Team Moudoor distributes Backdoor.Moudoor, a customized version of “Gh0st RAT”, for large-scale campaigns\n\nacross several industries. The distribution of Moudoor requires a sizeable number of people to both breach\ntargets and retrieve the information from the compromised networks.\n\n         - Team Naid distributes Trojan.Naid, the Trojan found during the Bit9 incident, which appears to be reserved\n\nfor more limited attacks against high value targets. This Trojan was leveraged for a special operation during\nthe VOHO campaign and is probably used by a specific team of highly skilled attackers within the group. This\nTrojan was also found as part of “Operation Aurora” in 2009.\n\nMuch of the attack infrastructure and tools used during these campaigns originate from network infrastructure\nin China. The Hidden Lynx group makes regular use of zero-day exploits and has the ability to rework and\ncustomize exploits quickly. They are methodical in their approach and they display a skillset far in advance of\nsome other attack groups also operating in that region, such as the Comment Crew (also known as APT1). The\nHidden Lynx group is an advanced persistent threat that has been in operation for at least four years and is\nbreaking into some of the best-protected organizations in the world. With a zero-day attack already under their\nbelt in 2013, they continue to operate at the leading edge of targeted attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### WHO ARE THEIR TARGETS?\n\n## The diverse set of targets from a variety of sectors would indicate that this group is not focused on any one specific task.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Who are their targets?\n\nSince November 2011, hundreds\nof organizations worldwide have\nbeen targeted by the Hidden Lynx\ngroup. These organizations have\nremained relatively consistent during\nthis time period. The group targets\norganizations operating in both the\ncommercial sector and within all\nlevels of government. The diverse set\nof targets from a variety of sectors\nwould indicate that this group is not\nfocused on any one specific task. The\ngroup manages concurrent campaigns\nin attacks that are global in nature.\n\nThe Hidden Lynx group has most\nrecently conducted attacks against\nspecific organizations in South Korea\nand has a long history of attacking the\ndefense industrial sector of Western\ncountries.\n\nThe top 10 organizations categorized _Figure 1. Top 10 organizations targeted by the Hidden Lynx group since_\nby the verticals they belong to are _November 2011_\nshown in Figure 1.\n\nThe most targeted countries/regions\nare shown in Figure 2.\n\n#### What is their motivation?\n\nThis broad range of targeted\ninformation would indicate that the\nattackers are part of a professional\norganization. They are likely\ntasked with obtaining very specific\ninformation that could be used to\ngain competitive advantages at both\na corporate and nation state level.\nIt is unlikely that this organization\nengages in processing or using the\nstolen information for direct financial\ngain. Their mode of operation would\nsuggest that they may be a private\norganization of “hackers for hire”,\nwho are highly skilled, experienced\nprofessionals whose services are\navailable for those willing to pay.\n\n_Figure 2. Countries/regions targeted by the Hidden Lynx group since_\n_November 2011_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Corporate Espionage\n\nThe financial services sector has been identified as the most heavily targeted industry overall. There is a\ntendency to target specific companies within this sector. Investment banks and asset management agencies\naccount for the majority of organizations targeted within this industry. The absence of certain types of financial\ninstitutions, such as those operating as commercial banks, clearly indicates that the attacks are focusing on\nspecific areas. The organizations involved would have expertise in large corporate deals, such as confidential\ninformation on upcoming mergers and acquisitions, which could be used to gain a competitive edge. Targeting\nthis sector in such a concentrated fashion could provide invaluable information when negotiating large takeovers\nor trading shares on the stock exchange.\n\nAttacks on the financial sector are not limited to investment banks. Stock trading firms and one of the world’s\nlargest stock exchanges have been subjected to attacks from this group. The Hidden Lynx group has also\nundertaken indirect attacks through the supply chains. Organizations that supply hardware, secure network\ncommunications and services specific to the financial sector have also come under attack. There is almost\ncertainly a financial motivation behind these attacks.\n\n##### Attacks against government contractors\n\nIn attacks that have targeted all levels of government from local to national level, this group has repeatedly\nattempted to infiltrate these networks. Attacks against government contractors and, more specifically, the\ndefense industry indicate that the group is in pursuit of confidential information and suggests that the group\nhad been working for nation states.\n\nTargeting advanced technologies in specific areas such as aerospace would be useful in order to close\ntechnological gaps or gain knowledge of the advanced capabilities of other nation states. Attacks on\norganizations that operate in the Internet services space can provide a wealth of valuable information. The group\nhad affiliations to “Operation Aurora” (See appendix for more details), a campaign that targeted a number of\norganizations including software manufacturers and defense contractors. More recently, Microsoft claimed that\nthe target was databases containing emails marked for court order wiretaps. They believe that these attacks\nwere counter-intelligence operations, activities that would provide benefits at a nation state level.\n\n#### What are they capable of?\n\nThe group’s tools, tactics and procedures are innovative and typically cutting-edge. They use custom tools and\ntechniques that they tailor to meet their objectives and maximize their chance of success. They attack public-\nfacing infrastructure and have been observed installing highly customized Trojans that are purpose-built for\nstealth. They engineered one of the most successful watering-hole attacks to-date. They also undertake spear-\nphishing attacks and hack supply chains in order to distribute their custom Trojans. This is an established team\nwith years of experience. They are well resourced and highly skilled.\n\nThe Hidden Lynx group’s advanced capabilities are clearly demonstrated in three major campaigns. In the VOHO\ncampaign, they showed how they could subvert Bit9’s established trust models. In the FINSHO campaign, they\nmanaged to get advanced knowledge of a zero-day exploit and in the SCADEF operation, they undertook supply\nchain attacks to succeed in their campaign.\n\n##### Subverting trust protection models\n\nThe team can adapt rapidly to counter-measures that would otherwise hinder the success of a campaign. The\nattack on Bit9 showed how the group could bypass solid trust protection models to get to their targets. However,\nthis attack was only a small part of the larger VOHO campaign, where the group proved how quickly they can\nadapt and change their tactics in the face of new and unforeseen obstacles.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Bit9 incident\n\nBit9 is a security company headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. As an alternative to traditional\nsignature-based antivirus solutions, Bit9 offers a trust-based security platform that runs off of a cloud-based\n\nreputation service combined with policy-driven\napplication control and whitelisting to protect against\ncyberthreats. As a result, it is difficult for a malicious\nthird-party to install an untrusted application, such\nas a remote access Trojan (RAT), onto a system\nthat is adequately protected with the Bit9 platform.\nUndaunted by this, the elite Hidden Lynx group took\nup the challenge.\n\nOn February 8 2013, Bit9 released details revealing\nthat a malicious third-party had gained access to one\nof their digital code-signing certificates. During this\nincident, a number of Trojans and malicious scripts\nwere signed. In a follow up post on February 25, more\ndetails of the attack emerged. In July 2012, more than\nsix months earlier, a malicious third-party gained\naccess to their network using an SQL injection attack.\nDue to an operational oversight, a public-facing\nserver that wasn’t protected with the Bit9 platform\nallowed the attackers to gain unauthorized access.\n\nThe attackers installed Backdoor.Hikit, a Trojan\nthat provides extremely stealthy remote access to\ncompromised systems. This highly customized Trojan\nis typically installed onto servers in the victims’ DMZ,\nwhich was the case at Bit9. Credentials for another\nvirtual machine were then stolen. These were used\nto access the virtual machine that contained one of\n\n_Figure 3. Trojan.Naid – Bit9 digital certific ate, July 13,_\n\nBit9’s digital code-signing certificates. The attackers\n\n_2012, provided by Symantec’s CA_\n\nused this code-signing infrastructure to sign\nthirty-two malicious files. Symantec telemetry\nshows some of these files have been present\nwithin select organizations in the United States\ndefense industrial sector.\n\nThe signing of these files is significant, since\nthey could then be used to circumvent the\ntrust protection model offered by the Bit9\nplatform. The Trojans signed include variants\nof Backdoor.Hikit (the remote access Trojan\nused in the initial compromise) and another\nRAT called Trojan.Naid. Some malicious attack\nscripts were also signed. Each Trojan has a\nspecific purpose. Backdoor.Hikit was used to\ntarget public-facing infrastructure while Trojan.\nNaid was used to perform highly targeted\nattacks through email and watering-holes.\n\nBit9 was alerted to the compromise in January\n2013 and took immediate containment steps\nsuch as revoking the digital signature and\nreaching out to their entire customer base.\n\n_Figure 4. Trojans successfully acquired with command-and-_\n\nAccording to Bit9, the attacks that followed\n\n_control (C&C) servers from the Bit9 investigation_\n\n\n-----\n\nwere not financially motivated, but rather were an attempt to access information. On Bit9’s own admission,\nthree customers were impacted.\n\nIn conjunction with the Bit9 compromise, the Hidden Lynx group had another significant campaign well under\nway. They had just concluded phase one of the VOHO campaign, a watering-hole operation orchestrated to\nattack organizations in the Boston, Massachusetts area – it was a likely a distribution vector for the newly signed\nfiles.\n\n###### The VOHO campaign\n\nThe VOHO campaign, first publicized by RSA, is one of the\nlargest and most successful watering-hole attacks to date.\nThe campaign combined both regional and industry-specific\nattacks and predominantly targeted organizations that\noperate in the United States. In a rapidly spreading two-\nphase attack, which started on June 25 and finished July 18,\nnearly 4,000 machines had downloaded a malicious payload.\nThese payloads were being delivered to unsuspecting\nvictims from legitimate websites that were strategically\ncompromised.\n\nThis watering-hole infection technique was quite innovative\nat the time. In a watering-hole attack, the attacker\ncompromises a legitimate website that the target uses and\ntrusts. The attacker then lies in wait for the target to visit\nthe compromised site in order to infect them. The scale and\ntargeted nature of the VOHO campaign set it apart from\nwatering-hole attacks observed in the past. The group first\nadopted this technique in December 2011 when an exploit\nfor the Oracle Java SE Rhino Script Engine Remote Code\nExecution Vulnerability (CVE-2011-3544) was leveraged to _Figure 5. The VOHO campaign target regions and_\ndistribute their payloads. As a result of their success, many _industries_\nother strategic compromises have\nbeen adopted by other attack groups,\nas seen in a notable attack targeting\niOS developers earlier in 2013 which\nimpacted employees at Facebook,\nApple and Twitter.\n\nIn the VOHO campaign, ten legitimate\nwebsites were strategically\ncompromised. The attackers carefully\nselected these websites based on\nthe likelihood that the intended\ntarget(s) would visit them during the\nexploit delivery phase. The attackers\nlikely pre-determined who visited\nthe watering-hole in advance of the\ndistribution phase of attack. This\ncould easily be achieved by examining\nthe access logs of compromised Web\nservers. The categories of websites\ncompromised were both regional\nand industry-specific in nature and\ntargeted the following key areas _Figure 6. The VOHO campaign malicious activity timeline -_\nillustrated in Figure 5. _a two-phase attack_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Timeline of activity\n\nThe VOHO watering-hole distributed remote access Trojans in two phases. In phase one of the attack, an Internet\nExplorer zero-day vulnerability, the Microsoft XML Core Services CVE-2012-1889 Remote Code Execution\nVulnerability (CVE-2012-1889), was leveraged. On July 10, Microsoft introduced the patch for CVE-2012-1889\nand activity at the watering-hole ceased. This appears to have been a clever decision on behalf of the attackers.\nIf they continued to deliver the exploit, they risked detection and would have hurt their chances of retaining\naccess to the watering-hole for phase two of the campaign. Within six days, phase two of the distribution began,\nthis time using a malicious Java applet exploiting the Oracle Java SE CVE-2012-1723 Remote Code Execution\nVulnerability (CVE-2012-1723). This Java exploit was patched at the time. Having already used two zero-day\nexploits in quick succession (the first zero-day exploit was used in the GOTHAM campaign in May 2012, see\nappendix for more details), the Hidden Lynx group may not have had another one at their disposal.\n\nThe timeline of activity at the watering-hole is shown in Figure 6.\n\nIn each phase of the attack, two Trojans were being distributed at different intervals. The customized version\nof “Gh0st RAT”, Backdoor.Moudoor, saw large-scale distribution in comparison to Trojan.Naid, which was used\nmore selectively in these attacks.\n\nBefore being used in the second phase of the attack, Trojan.Naid was signed with the Bit9 certificate. Moudoor\nwas never observed during the attack on Bit9, which could indicate that two separate teams are at work\nhere. With Moudoor and Naid using different command-and-control (C&C) servers, each team could work\nindependently on alternative objectives. The discovery of the Naid C&C would also be less likely in comparison\nto Moudoor’s, as its large-scale distribution would inevitably create more noise as it continued to impact many\norganizations.\n\n_Figure 7. The VOHO campaign – Trojans distributed and C&C servers used to command and control_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Team Naid’s role\n\nDuring this campaign, Team Naid had a very specific objective – to gain access to information from organizations\noperating in the defense industrial sector. An unsigned version of Naid was distributed to select victims within\nthe defense industrial sector during phase one until Microsoft supplied a patch for CVE-2012-1889 on July 10. It\nmay have been during this phase of the attack when the team realized the information they sought was held by\norganizations protected by Bit9. As the team found it difficult to compromise Bit9-protected computers and had\nno viable exploit for distribution, their immediate objective focused on Bit9’s digital code-signing certificate.\n\nBy July 13, just a few days after they started their attacks on Bit9, they obtained the Bit9-signed Naid. By the\nnext day, they had built a viable Java exploit to distribute their Trojan. Armed with the newly-signed Trojan and\ndelivery vehicle, the group resumed malicious activity at the watering-hole for three days from July 16. It was\nduring this period that three organizations protected with the Bit9 platform were successfully compromised.\n\nIn this campaign, Naid was specifically reserved for special operations against high value targets. Team Naid’s\nobjective was narrow and focused and the team aimed to limit Naid’s exposure. The sophistication of the\noverall attack is typical of attackers with a very high pedigree. The team is clearly highly skilled; they operate\nmethodically and can switch objectives at a moment’s notice. They rapidly adapted to external factors that were\nhindering their specific objective and pursued a difficult prize - the Bit9 certificate - in order to achieve their\noverall goal.\n\n###### Team Moudoor’s role\n\nThe distribution of Moudoor\nduring this campaign was on a\nmuch larger scale. Organizations\noperating in the financial sector,\nall levels of government (local and\nfederal), healthcare, education\nand law were impacted during\nthis campaign. There is a wealth\nof sensitive information within\nthese organizations which would\nbe of interest to both nation states\nand entities that would benefit\nfrom information as a result of\ncorporate espionage attacks.\n\nThe top distinct infections per\norganization type are shown in\nFigure 8.\n\nA campaign distributing Moudoor\non such a large scale would\nrequire a sizeable team to\noperate and maintain remote\naccess to these compromised\ncomputers. The breach phase\nof the operation could easily\nbe handled by a smaller team,\nwhich then passes control to a\nlarger team of operators who can\n\n_Figure 8. Industries with the most Backdoor.Moudoor infections during the_\n\ntraverse networks and retrieve the\n\n_VOHO campaign_\n\ninformation they are tasked with\ngaining access to. To efficiently\n\n\n-----\n\nattack this many organizations concurrently would require an equally large number of operators. These Trojans\nrequire manual operation so it’s conceivable that tens if not hundreds of operators would be used post-breach to\nprocess and handle the stolen data.\n\nThe VOHO campaign is one of a number of campaigns attributed to this group over the last four years. It showed\nhow quickly the group could change their strategy and the lengths they would go to get to their targets. The fact\nthat the Bit9 code-signing certificate breach was only a small part of this campaign shows how adaptable and\ndetermined the group is.\n\n##### Advanced zero-day access\n\nThe group is highly organized and can gain advanced access to zero-day vulnerabilities. In February, the Hidden\nLynx group used this advanced knowledge to take advantage of the Oracle Java SE CVE-2013-1493 Remote\nCode Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2013-1493) to attack Japanese targets in the FINSHO campaign.\n\n###### FINSHO\n\nWithin two days of Bit9’s\nblog post on February\n25, the attackers began\ndistributing Moudoor\nand Naid in a campaign\nthat leveraged CVE-2013-\n1493. Interestingly, the\nC&C server configured in\nNaid (110.173.55.187)\nwas also configured in\na sample found in the\nBit9 incident. Although\nthe version used against\nBit9 was not observed\nelsewhere in the wild,\nthe group’s methodical\napproach would indicate\nthat a similar campaign\nmay have been intended\nfor that Trojan.\n\nThe timeline for exploit _Figure 9. Timeline of activity for CVE-2013-1493 distributing Moudoor and Naid_\ndevelopment and _in the FINSHO campaign_\ndistribution is illustrated\nin Figure 9.\n\nAccording to Oracle’s blog,\nCVE-2013-1493 was reported to\nthem on February 1, the same day\nthat class files exploiting it were\nadded to MightDev.jar shown in\nFigure 10. In past Java exploits\nused by this group, the code was\nalready public knowledge and a\n\n_Figure 10. MightDev.jar used to distribute Naid and subsequently Moudoor_\n\npatch was already available for the\nsoftware. In this case, they gained\nadvanced knowledge from an unknown source - a source with early access to the exploit conditions, possibly on\nthe same day as Oracle. Oracle released the fix for CVE-2013-1493 on March 4.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 illustrates the\nrelationship between FINSHO\nand the Bit9 incident through the\nshared C&C server used in both\nNaid configurations.\n\nAlternate C&C servers and separate\nwebsites for distribution provide\nfurther evidence that there are\ndistinctions between how these\nteams operate.\n\n##### Supply chain attacks\n\nThe Hidden Lynx group continued\nto attack the defense industry\npost-VOHO. In another campaign\nnamed SCADEF, manufacturers\nand suppliers of military-grade\ncomputers were observed installing\na Trojanized Intel driver application.\n\n_Figure 11. CVE-2013-1493 used to distribute Trojan.Naid and_\n\n###### SCADEF Backdoor.Moudoor (February/March 2013) in the FINSHO campaign\n\nThe attackers bundled this Intel driver application with variants of Backdoor.Moudoor using a popular Chinese\narchiving application called Haozip. The attackers likely compromised a legitimate download of this driver\napplication from a non-reputable source but the true source was never discovered in this investigation.\n\nThe technique is another\navenue into hardened\nnetworks of interest.\nThey attack not only\nhardware suppliers, but\ncontractors that may\naccess these networks\nduring their course of\nwork. The group seeks\nout the weakest link in\nthe chain and simply lies\nin wait. In these specific\nattacks, they simply\nwait for a shipment of\ncompromised computers\nto be installed into the\ntargeted network. Unique\ndetections observed\nfor these Trojanized\n\n_Figure 12. Supply chain hacking detections in the IT supply/defense/healthcare industry_ applications are\n\npresented in Figure 12.\n\nThe VOHO, FINSHO and SCADEF campaigns each showed how efficient and adaptable the group is when focusing on\ntheir targets. They use a wide range of advanced attack methods and change their strategy when required to carry\nout each operation. These three campaigns are only some of the operations undertaken by the Hidden Lynx group,\nmaking them a credible threat to several industries.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\n## From the evidence seen, it’s clear that Hidden Lynx belongs to a professional organization.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nCyberespionage campaigns are becoming increasingly common, with countless threat actors attempting to gain\nfootholds into some of the best-protected organizations. These attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated.\nThe capabilities and tactics used by these threat actors vary considerably. The Hidden Lynx group is capable\nof undertaking focused attacks against niche targets and running large-scale campaigns targeting multiple\norganizations on a global scale. They have seen action in numerous campaigns since 2009 and repeatedly attack\ntheir targets with cutting-edge techniques. They quickly adapt to security counter-measures and are highly\nmotivated. They are one of the most well-resourced and capable attack groups in the targeted threat landscape.\n\nFrom the evidence seen, it’s clear that Hidden Lynx belongs to a professional organization. They operate in a highly\nefficient manner. They can attack on multiple fronts. They use the latest techniques, have access to a diverse set\nof exploits and have highly customized tools to compromise target networks. Their attacks, carried out with such\nprecision on a regular basis over long periods of time, would require a well-resourced and sizeable organization.\nThey possess expertise in many areas, with teams of highly skilled individuals who can adapt rapidly to the changing\nlandscape. This team could easily consist of 50-100 individuals. This level of resources would be needed to build\nthese Trojans, maintain infection and C&C infrastructure and pursue confidential information on multiple networks.\nThey are highly skilled and experienced campaigners in pursuit of information of value to both commercial and\ngovernmental organizations.\n\nThe incident in Bit9, which ultimately led to successful compromises of hard-to-crack targets during the VOHO\ncampaign, only serves to highlight this fact. The evolving targeted attack landscape is becoming increasingly\nsophisticated. As organizations implement security counter-measures, the attackers are adapting at a rapid rate.\nWith a growing number of threat actors participating in these campaigns, organizations have to understand that\nsophisticated attackers are working hard to bypass each layer of security. It’s no longer safe to assume that any one\nsolution will protect a company’s assets. A variety of solutions need to be combined and, with a better understanding\nof the adversary, tailored to adequately protect the information of most interest to the attackers.\n\nThe Hidden Lynx group’s mission is large and they’re targeting a diverse set of information. The frequency and\ndiversity of these attacks would indicate that the attackers are tasked with sourcing information from many\norganizations. These tasks are likely distributed within the team. The group’s goal is to gain access to information\nwithin organizations in some of the wealthiest and most technologically advanced countries across the globe. It is\nunlikely that they can use this information for direct financial gain, and the diversity of the information and number\nof distinguishable campaigns would suggest that they are contracted by multiple clients. This leads us to believe that\nthis is a professional organization that offers a “hackers for hire” service.\n\nThe worrying knock-on effect of this group’s activities is that other threat actors are learning and adopting their\ntechniques. The Hidden Lynx group is not basking in their past glories, they are continuing to refine and streamline\ntheir operations and techniques to stay one step ahead of their competition. Organizations that are being attacked\non multiple fronts need to better protect the information that is most valuable to them. We expect these attackers\nto be involved in many more high profile campaigns in the coming years. They will continue to adapt and innovate.\nThey will continue to provide information servicing interests at both a corporate and state level. Groups like Hidden\nLynx are certainly winning some of the battles, but as organizations gain a better understanding of how these groups\noperate, they can take steps to help prevent their most valuable information from falling into attackers’ hands.\n\n\n-----\n\n### APPENDIX\n\n\n-----\n\n|Table 1.

These attackers pioneered\n\nCVE-2012-1889 Microsoft XML Core Services http://www.gothamcenter.org\n\nthe watering-hole technique,\n\nCVE-2012-1889 RCE Vulnerability http://www.torontocurling.com (VOHO)\n\nhowever they can also fall back http://ansky.hk166.cqbi.com\nto more traditional methods of\n\nCVE-2012-1723 Oracle Java SE CVE-2012-1723 RCE http://www.torontocurling.com (VOHO)\n\nattack, such as spear-phishing\n\nVulnerability\n\nemails, supply chain attacks and\n\nCVE-2013-1493 Oracle Java SE RCE Vulnerability http://www.k-sho.co.jp\n\nTrojanized software updates.\n\nhttp://www.finesis.jp\n\nSince 2011, the Hidden Lynx\ngroup has leveraged five\nbrowser-based exploits for payload distribution, three of which were zero-day exploits.\n\nThe list of browser-based\nexploits used by the Hidden\nLynx group since the\nintroduction of Moudoor is\npresented in Table 1.\n\nIn the first half of 2012,\nthere was a particularly high\ndistribution of Moudoor. There\nwas a peak in June/July as a\nresult of the VOHO campaign\nwhich is evident in the graph\nshown in Figure 13.\n\nThere is also a peak at the\nbeginning of the year which\nis a result of another high\ndistribution campaign called\nWSDHEALTHY. This campaign,\nalong with some other notable\nattacks and techniques, will\nbe discussed in the following _Figure 13. Unique infections of Moudoor and Naid (November 2011 – June 2013)_\nsections.\n\n        - GOTHAM – Shared distribution, shared C&C – yet another zero day exploit\n\n        - WSDHEALTHY – Watering-hole campaigns pre-dating VOHO by seven months\n\n        - EASYUPDATE – Trojanizing a popular P2P software’s updates\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GOTHAM – Campaigns running concurrently\n\nOn May 30th, The Hidden Lynx group used their first zero-day exploit of 2012, taking advantage of the Microsoft\nInternet Explorer CVE-2012-1875 Same ID Property Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1875) in order\nto distribute Moudoor and Naid from gothamcenter.org, a website devoted to the history of New York. This was a\ntwo-phase attack which saw Team Naid and Team Moudoor share C&C infrastructure (219.90.117.132) in a smaller\ncampaign that infected organizations in the following industries:\n\n         - Financial services\n\n        - Information communications technology\n\n       - Government\n\n        - Marketing\n\n        - Information technology\n\n        - Aerospace/defense\n\n        - Energy\n\nMany of the industries\ntargeted in this\ncampaign are similar\nto those targeted in\nthe VOHO campaign,\nso this could be\nconsidered as a\npre-cursor to that\ncampaign. Similar to\nVOHO, this was a two-\nphased attack that\nleveraged two Internet\nExplorer zero-days\nfor distribution (CVE-\n2012-1875 and CVE-\n2012-1889). Similar\nto VOHO, as Microsoft\npatched CVE-2012-\n1875, the attackers\nhalted distribution. _Figure 14. Activity timeline on gothamcenter.org_\nThis prevented\nany unnecessary\nsuspicious activity from being identified that could\nimpact future activity from the compromised website.\nA timeline for this activity is presented in Figure 14.\n\nSharing C&C infrastructure could indicate that both\nteams were working closely together and may have\ndivided up the effort during this campaign. During\nphase two of this campaign, VOHO began. The Hidden\nLynx group is clearly resourced to operate and\nmaintain distribution and C&C infrastructure across\nmultiple campaigns. This level of organization requires\ndiscipline at multiple levels within the group. This\nis not a small group of elite hackers – this is a well-\norganized professional organization.\n\nOne campaign that rivals VOHO in terms of size is\nWSDHEALTHY. This is the first campaign where we see\nthe group using Naid and Moudoor together sharing _Figure 15. Moudoor and Naid share distribution and_\ninfrastructure and the first links to the Bit9 incident _command and control servers_\n\n\n-----\n\nstart to emerge.\n\n###### WSDHEALTHY – Shared infrastructure with the Bit9 incident\n\nThe Hidden Lynx group began\nusing watering-hole attacks\nas early as December 2011.\nAlthough no zero-day exploit\nwas available, they used a\npatched Java exploit (CVE-\n2011-3544) effectively to\ndistribute Moudoor from three\ncompromised websites. This\ncampaign provided the first\nindications that the group was\nusing both Moudoor and Naid\nto attack targets and share\nC&C infrastructure. Along with\nthis, early links to the attacks\non Bit9 began to emerge.\n\nThe timeline of this activity is\nshown in Figure 16.\n\nIn these campaigns, the\nHidden Lynx group made\nheavy use of infrastructure in\nHong Kong, with the exception _Figure 16. Timeline of malicious activity associated with CVE-2011-3544_\nof yahooeast.net. This is\nthis domain that links to the\nBit9 attack, as it resolved\nto 66.153.86.14 – a C&C\nserver used by the Backdoor.\nHikit sample installed after\nthe successful SQL injection\nattack on Bit9. Moudoor was\nbeing actively distributed from\nthese websites for two, four\nand five months respectively.\nThese are exceptionally long\nperiods of time to retain access\nto compromised servers for\npayload distribution of this\nnature.\n\nThe C&C servers used and the\nlinks between the Trojans and\nBit9 are shown in Figure 17.\n\nTeam Moudoor heavily relies\non a dynamic DNS service\ncalled DTDNS to rapidly\nswitch between C&C servers.\nIn fact, they use direct IP\nconnections or DTDNS\nexclusively to establish C&C\ncommunications, with the _Figure 17. CVE-2011-3544 - the first links between Moudoor and Naid emerge_\n\n\n-----\n\nexception of yahooeast.net\nwhich is a registered domain.\nThe Hidden Lynx group uses\ntechniques which have clearly\nbeen established through\nexperience to maintain this\ninfrastructure for long periods of\ntime. They adapt quickly and likely\nhave a stockpile of C&C servers\nthat they can quickly switch to\nwhich provides maximum uptime\nduring any given operation.\n\nAlong with this, the Hidden Lynx\ngroup uses several different\nmethods to infect their targets.\nIn the SCADEF campaign, we saw\nhow the group bundled Moudoor\nwith legitimate software to infect\ntargets. They also managed to\nTrojanize software updates as\nwell, as seen in the EASYUPDATE\ncampaign where a Chinese\nP2P application was observed\nselectively installing Moudoor\nsince 2011.\n\n###### EASYUPDATE – A\n\n_Figure 18. Percentage breakdown of unique detections from VeryCD P2P client_\n\n###### Trojanized software update\n\nSince November 2011, the Hidden\nLynx group has been able to insert\nMoudoor into the distribution\nchain of one of the most popular\nChinese P2P applications provided\nby VeryCD.com. There is a very\nlow distribution of Trojanized\nupdates and it is quite likely that\nthey are somehow selectively\ninstalling Moudoor on specific\nclients. This is, without a doubt,\nthe longest running distribution\nvector for the group, which\ninfected victims predominantly in\nChina, the United States and Hong\nKong.\n\nThese are the earliest indications\nof Moudoor infections, with\n“kissnada” being one of the first\nDTDNS domains observed in use.\nThis distribution vector’s exact\npurpose is still unclear, however\nit’s certainly linked to the group, _Figure 19. Moudoor variants downloaded through P2P client updates_\n\n\n-----\n\nas we have observed Moudoor\nsamples in WSDHEALTHY\nconfigured to use kissnada58.\nchatnook.com and usa-\nmail.scieron.com for C&C\ncommunications.\n\nThe Hidden Lynx group\nhas left a clear fingerprint\nfor the past two years with\nclearly identifiable links to\nthe group’s activities. The\nuse of customized Trojans,\nshared distribution and\nC&C infrastructure, coupled\nwith repeated attacks on\na predictable set of target\norganizations has allowed\na more complete picture of\nthese attacks to be compiled. A\nsummary of the links between\nall of these attacks is presented\nin Figure 20.\n\n##### Trojans used by the Hidden Lynx group\n\nThe following section lists the\nTrojans that were used by the\nHidden Lynx group throughout\ntheir various campaigns.\n\n###### Backdoor.Moudoor\n\nIn 2011, the Hidden Lynx\ngroup began to use Backdoor.\nMoudoor. This is a customized\nversion of “Gh0st RAT”.\nGh0st RAT variants have\nbeen used in cyberespionage\ncampaigns emanating from\nChina for years. In 2009, _Figure 20. Linking the group’s activity (November 2011-March 2013)_\nInformation Warfare Monitor\npublished a detailed report,\n“Tracking GhostNet”, following an investigation\ninto a cyberespionage network of more than 1,000\ncompromised computers affecting more than 100\ncountries. Many threat actors use customized versions of\nthis RAT for cyberespionage operations.\n\n###### Trojan.Naid\n\nThe team uses Trojan.Naid for special operations. It\nfirst appeared in May 2009 and has been used in many\n\n_Figure 21. Naid/Vasport obfuscation tool_\n\nhigh profile attacks over the past four years. It shares\n\n\n-----\n\n|Table 2. Backdoor.Vasport payload from malicious Word documents|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|PE Timestamp|MD5|C&C|\n|27/04/2012 22:07|6fe1634dce1d095d6b8a06757b5b6041|svr01.passport.serveuser.com|\n\n\ntechnical similarities with other Trojans which also originate from China. All of these Trojans are potentially from\nthe same group or they may source these Trojans from the same developer. The technical similarities are based on a\nshared file creation template and C&C protocol.\n\nThe other Trojans that share these traits are:\n\n           - Backdoor.Vasport\n\n           - Backdoor.Boda\n\n###### File creation template\n```\n           %TEMP%\\uid.ax\n           %%TEMP%%\\%s.ax\n           %%TEMP%%\\%s _ p.ax\n\n Command and control template\n           POST http://%ls:%d/%x HTTP/1.1\n           Content-Length: 2\n           CONNECT %ls:%d HTTP/1.1\n           Connection: keep-alive\n           lynx\n\n```\nThere is also evidence that\nBackdoor.Vasport and Trojan.\nNaid have shared the same\npacker to obfuscate the\npayloads from AV detection.\nThe obfuscation tool used is\nalso Chinese in origin and has\na simple user interface to help\npack these Trojans.\n\nNaid also has a history of using\nstolen digital certificates to\novercome trust-based protection\nwhen attacking certain hardened\ntargets. Some of the certificates\nidentified are shown in Figure 22.\n\n###### Backdoor.Vasport\n\nBackdoor.Vasport was delivered\nby exploiting the Adobe Flash\nPlayer CVE-2012-0779 Object\nType Confusion Remote Code\nExecution Vulnerability (CVE-\n\n_Figure 22. Stolen digital certificates used by Trojan.Naid_\n\n2012-0779). This was delivered\nin malicious Word documents\nin targeted attack emails. The\nexploit component used in these\nattacks was also used in the\n\n_Table 2. Backdoor.Vasport payload from malicious Word documents_\n\nElderwood Platform.\n\nPE Timestamp MD5 C&C\n\nTable 2 shows the payload from\n\n27/04/2012 22:07 6fe1634dce1d095d6b8a06757b5b6041 svr01.passport.serveuser.com\n\nthe malicious word documents.\n\n###### Backdoor.Boda\n\nIn a more recent campaign called Ladyboyle, Backdoor.Boda was being distributed to take advantage of the Adobe\n\n\n-----\n\nFlash Player CVE-2013-0634 Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2013-0634). These files were\nsigned with a digital signature from MGAME Corporation, a tactic used previously by the attackers. Interestingly,\nBackdoor.Boda and\nBackdoor.Vasport were both\ndistributed using Flash zero-\nday exploits in embedded\ndocuments. It’s plausible\nthat the group has a team\ndedicated to distribution\nusing Flash exploits that\ncustomizes Trojans from the\nsame code base that the Naid\nuses.\n\n###### Trojan.Hydraq (Operation Aurora)\n\nThe Hidden Lynx group has\nused cutting-edge attack\ntechniques and a consistent\nmethodology. Trojan.Naid\nhas been in use since 2009\nand Hidden Lynx attacks\nbear the hallmarks of a\ncampaign that involved yet\nanother Internet Explorer\nzero-day exploit in December\n2009. Trojan.Naid was\nused in the infamous\nattacks on organizations in\nthe financial, technology,\nInternet and media sectors\ncalled “Operation Aurora”.\nThese attacks are linked\nwith another Trojan called\nTrojan.Hydraq, but Naid was\ndownloaded in stage three of\nthe operation.\n\nTrojan.Hydraq disappeared\nfrom the targeted attack\nlandscape shortly after\nOperation Aurora, most likely _Figure 23. Trojan.Naid links to Hydraq and Operation Aurora_\ndue to the close attention\nthat it was receiving from\nsecurity researchers. Trojan.Naid did not meet the same fate, as it is still being used in sophisticated targeted\nattacks to this day.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Resources\n\n           - http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hydraq-attack-mythical-proportions\n\n           - http://googleblog.blogspot.ie/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n\n           - https://blog.bit9.com/2013/02/08/bit9-and-our-customers-security/\n\n           - https://blog.bit9.com/2013/02/25/bit9-security-incident-update/\n\n           - http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-082113-5541-99\n\n           - http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-061518-4639-99\n\n           - http://blogs.rsa.com/wp-content/uploads/VOHO_WP_FINAL_READY-FOR-Publication-09242012_AC.pdf\n\n           - http://threatpost.com/why-watering-hole-attacks-work-032013\n\n           - http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/latest-java-zero-day-shares-connections-bit9-security-incident\n\n           - http://www.cio.com/article/732122/_Aurora_Cyber_Attackers_Were_Really_Running_Counter_Intelligence\n\n           - http://www.infowar-monitor.net/2009/09/tracking-ghostnet-investigating-a-cyber-espionage-network/\n\n           - http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-051606-5938-99\n\n           - http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/elderwood-project\n\n           - http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/adobe-zero-day-used-ladyboyle-attack\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Symantec Protection\n\nMany different Symantec protection technologies play a role in defending against this threat, including:\n\nSymantec Norton Norton Norton\nEndpoint Protection 360 Internet Security Anitvirus\n\n_File-based protection_\n\n_Network-based protection_\n\n_Behavior-based protection_\n\n_Reputation-based protection_\n\n_Norton Safeweb_\n\n_Download Insight_\n\n_Application & device control_\n\n_Browser protection_\n\n#### File-based protection (Traditional antivirus)\n\nTraditional antivirus protection is designed to detect and block malicious files and is effective against files\nassociated with this attack.\n\n           - Trojan.Hydraq\n\n           - Backdoor.Moudoor\n\n           - Trojan.Naid\n\n           - Backdoor.Hikit\n\n           - Backdoor.Vasport\n\n           - Backdoor.Boda\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Network-based protection (IPS)\n\nNetwork-based protection in Symantec Endpoint Protection can help protect against unauthorized network\nactivities conducted by malware threats or intrusion attempts.\n\n           - Web Attack: Oracle Java Rhino Script Engine CVE-2011-3544 (24700)\n\n           - Web Attack: Oracle Java Rhino Script Engine CVE-2011-3544 3 (24917)\n\n           - Web Attack: MSIE Same ID Property CVE-2012-1875 (25787)\n\n           - Web Attack: MSIE Same ID Property CVE-2012-1875 2 (26485)\n\n           - Web Attack: MSIE MSXML CVE-2012-1889 (25783)\n\n           - Web Attack: MSIE MSXML CVE-2012-1889 2 (50331)\n\n           - Web Attack: MSIE MSXML CVE-2012-1889 3 (25786)\n\n           - Web Attack: MSIE MSXML CVE-2012-1889 4 (25986)\n\n           - Web Attack: Java CVE-2012-1723 RCE (26051)\n\n           - Web Attack: Java CVE-2012-1723 RCE 2 (26080)\n\n           - Web Attack: Oracle Java Type Confusion Attack CVE-2012-1723 4 (25962)\n\n           - Web Attack: Oracle Java SE CVE-2012-1723 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability 3 (25934)\n\n           - Web Attack: Java CVE-2013-1493 RCE (26556)\n\n           - Web Attack: Java CVE-2013-1493 RCE 2 (26525)\n\n#### Behavior-based protection\n\nBehavior-based detection blocks suspicious processes using the Bloodhound.SONAR series of detections\n\n#### Reputation-based protection (Insight)\n\n           - Norton Safeweb blocks users from visiting infected websites.\n\n           - Insight detects and warns against suspicious files as WS.Reputation.1\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Authors\n\n###### Stephen Doherty\nSenior Threat Intelligence Analyst\n\n###### Jozsef Gegeny\nSoftware Engineer\n\n###### Branko Spasojevic\nSr Software Engineer **About Symantec**\n\nSymantec protects the world’s information and is the\nglobal leader in security, backup, and availability solutions.\n\n###### Jonell Baltazar\n\nOur innovative products and services protect people and\n\nSr Software Engineer\n\ninformation in any environment—from the smallest mobile\ndevice to the enterprise data center to cloud-based systems.\n\nOur industry-leading expertise in protecting data,\nidentities, and interactions gives our customers confidence\n\nin a connected world.
