Upon investigation we have determined the malware payload to be\nDELoader, which downloads a Zeus variant banking trojan upon execution.\n\n## E-mail Lures\n\nThe e-mails typically pretend to be from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) claiming that\nthe individual has a tax payment outstanding.\n\nThe e-mails contain an MSG attachment with an embedded OLE object. This is not a\ntechnique we see very often and is challenging for security products to detect due to the\ncomplicated MSG format. When the user opens the MSG attachment they are faced with the\nfollowing content:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe embedded object name \"case_243541.doc\" here is actually a spoofed object name.\nDouble clicking on this fake document will prompt the user as to whether they wish to run a\nJScript file. If execution is allowed then the JScript file will begin to download and execute\nmalware from the following URL:\n```\nhxxp://tradestlo.top/poll.hls\n\n## Malware Payload (DELoader)\n\n```\nThe malware downloaded by the malicious JScript files is a trojan downloader known as\nDELoader (aka Terdot). This malware has previously been used to target German\nnationals. In the sample we analysed\n(SHA1 5bfb7cbc0c79e1ce7fd4861193bd38ceeb4c8c2d) DELoader downloaded and\nexecuted a Zeus banking trojan variant from one the following URLs:\n```\nhxxps://aspecto.top/dpr.bin\nhxxps://prisectos.top/dpr.bin\n\n```\nContrary to previous research we do not believe DELoader to be a generic malware\ndownloader. DELoader seems to be solely used to distribute a specific variant of the Zeus\nbanking trojan. We unpacked the embedded DELoader DLL\n(SHA1 cad1715f0ffd32092001a14c5f8de6990c379867) and compared it with the Zeus\nvariant it downloaded (SHA1 e57362eaa240da948980c4c6133d63c2a4c07b31). As a result\nwe noticed the following connections:\n\nBoth use the same domains aspecto[.]top and prisectos[.]top\nBoth contain the string \"shared_%s\"\nBoth were compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012\nBoth were compiled within 20 seconds of each other according to the PE headers\nDELoader is hard-coded with an export to call in the Zeus DLL\n\nDELoader appears to be compiled under the name \"loader.dll\" and the Zeus variant appears\nto be compiled under the name \"client32 dll\"\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware Payload (Zeus Variant)\n\nZeus (aka ZBot) is an infamous banking trojan capable of intercepting and modifying online\nbanking traffic in order to perform fraudulent transactions. It does this by injecting itself into\nweb browsers that are running on the machine. It is also capable of stealing other credentials\nfrom the machine, enabling remote desktop access, and acting as a proxy server for an\nattacker.\n\nIn the sample we analysed the malware downloaded its main configuration file from one of\nthe following URLs:\n```\nhxxps://aspecto.top/dsr.bin\nhxxps://prisectos.top/dsr.bin\n\n```\nWe were able to decrypt the configuration to reveal its version number, command-andcontrol (C&C) and a list of banking websites to steal and modify traffic from.\n```\nVERSION\n     1.5.5.0\nCOMMAND AND CONTROL URL\n     hxxps://namoterno.top/promo.php\nALTERNATIVE CONFIG URL\n     hxxps://alecofrinse3.com/aqs.bin\n     hxxps://bielakee.xyz/cr2.bin\n     hxxps://lwowenase.top/core.bin\n...\n\n```\nThe list of banking websites were mainly Canadian banks, with some US and Australian\nbanks also targeted.\n\n## Protection Statement\n\n\n-----\n\n[Forcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following](https://www.forcepoint.com/innovation/technology/triton-ace?cmpid=slbl)\nstages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - Malicious e-mails associated with this attack are identified and\nblocked.\nStage 5 (Dropper File) - DELoader is prevented from being downloaded by the\nmalicious JScript file.\nStage 6 (Call Home) - Attempts by the Zeus variant to call home are identified and\nblocked.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe actor behind DELoader has started targeting Canadian nationals with a variant of the\nZeus banking trojan. The DELoader malware itself appears to have been designed\nspecifically for use with this Zeus variant. The Zeus code base continues to be a popular\nchoice for malware developers looking to create a quick and easy banking trojan. It is\nimportant to be careful when opening e-mail attachments and to verify that the sender is who\nthey say they are.\n\n[The Canada Revenue Agency website has additional information for recognising and](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/scrty/frdprvntn/menu-eng.html)\nprotecting against fraud.\n\n_Blog contributors: Nick Griffin, Ran Mosessco_\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### JScript Downloader (SHA1)\n```\nf4a4a2207c8c1135a7bdf819d95e9ee22d34d733\n\n DELoader (SHA1)\n5bfb7cbc0c79e1ce7fd4861193bd38ceeb4c8c2d\n\n DELoader Unpacked DLL (SHA1)\ncad1715f0ffd32092001a14c5f8de6990c379867\n\n Zeus Variant (SHA1)\ne57362eaa240da948980c4c6133d63c2a4c07b31\n\n DELoader Payload URL\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nhxxp://tradestlo.top/poll.hls\n\n### Zeus Variant Payload URL\nhxxps://aspecto.top/dpr.bin\nhxxps://prisectos.top/dpr.bin\n\n Zeus Variant Config URLs\nhxxps://aspecto.top/dsr.bin\nhxxps://prisectos.top/dsr.bin\nhxxps://alecofrinse3.com/aqs.bin\nhxxps://bielakee.xyz/cr2.bin\nhxxps://lwowenase.top/core.bin\n\n Zeus Variant C&C\nhxxps://namoterno.top/promo.php\n\n About Forcepoint\n\n```\nForcepoint is the leading user and data protection cybersecurity company, entrusted to\nsafeguard organizations while driving digital transformation and growth.
