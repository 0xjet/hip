However, as cyberthreats with political\nmotivation targeting journalists grows while nature of journalists’ work involves in receiving and opening random files and links in the name of\nreceiving tips from unknown sources, the importance of digital safety for journalists are ever imminent.\n\nOn December 7, a journalist received a message over WeChat messenger application asking to talk privately about a sensitive topic. Theth\nboth parties discuss messaging over a secure application and the sender suggests talking over an application called “Fizzle messenger” and\n\n\n-----\n\nproceeds to send a copy of the APK to lure a journalist to install.\n\nThe application “Fizzle messenger” acts as a first stage of the malware, a loader, performing various checks on the Android device to serve a\npayload. The served payload that provides malicious methods that can be called from a C2, exfiltrates sensitive data to cloud storage and\ndownloads a secondary payload. The secondary payload exfiltrates further data, registers services for continual exfiltration and provides C2\nmechanisms via Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging.\n\nThis threat report contains a breakdown of the functionality of this malware and we have shared sample hashes at the end of the report.\n\n**RambleOn Flow Summary**\n\nThe malware has multiple stages, payloads and exfiltrates data from the Android device continually. Below, we describe in simple steps how\nthe malware executes and compromises its victims.\n\n1. Adversary lures victim install installing malicious application (in this instance, this application is called Fizzle)\n2. Fizzle downloads a payload, a .Dex file, from either pCloud or Yandex cloud storage endpoints.\n3. Fizzle dynamically loads the .Dex file and calls a method that exfiltrates data to either the pCloud or Yandex cloud storage endpoints.\n\nThis also downloads a secondary payload that facilitates continuous exfiltration and C2 mechanisms.\n4. The secondary payload registers the device with Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging to provide C2 mechanisms.\n5. The secondary payload starts multiple services, that exfiltrate data to the pCloud or Yandex cloud storage endpoints.\n6. C2 commands using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) initiate services in the second payload, which dynamically load classes contained\n\nin the first payload. These classes perform C2 methods and exfiltrate any data back to the cloud storage.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Diagram of malware flow_\n\n**Stage 1: The loader**\n\nAs discussed in the introduction, the victim received a direct message over WeChat. The message relates to the sender discussing potential\nsensitive information and both parties discuss communicating over a more secure messaging app. The original sender, suggests to talk on an\napplication called “Fizzle”, proceeding to send a copy of the file with the filename “1_Fizzle.apk” and suggests the victim to install the\napplication.\n\nAt the time of writing, the application was only determined as malicious by one vendor, however this only flagged for a PUA signature.\n\n_Figure 1 VirusTotal scan results of Fizzle messaging app_\n\nThe application itself works functionally as a messaging app, prompting the user to create an account link from another device.\n\n\n-----\n\n.\n\n_Figure 2 Screenshot of the Fizzle Application home page_\n\nUpon initial inspection of the application, we can first see that it has many permissions in its manifest that are dangerous in certain contexts.\nHowever, since this application is a messaging application, all of these permissions could be deemed as something necessary for its\nfunctionality. Many of these permissions can be seen in widely used legitimate messaging applications. Due to this, a user may not think this\napplication is malicious.\n\n_Figure 3 Fizzle messaging app permissions_\n\nWhen the application runs, the process itself spawns as “ch.seme”; during analysis, we identified one file that contained payload delivery\nfunctionality. Located at “ch.seme.services.LogUService”, the class contains dynamic Dex class loading via module\n“dalvik.system.DexClassLoader”. The malicious app uses the “DexClassLoader” to dynamically load a Dex file from a cloud storage endpoint\n(either pCloud or Yandex) and execute. The application loads the Dex, which has a process name “com.personal.info” and class name\n“plugin”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Screenshot of ch.seme.LogUService’s usage of DexClassLoader_\n\nThe “LogUService” class contains multiple methods that provide capability to download the first payload from one of two endpoints located at\ncloud storage services, pCloud and Yandex. These cloud storage services are called via OAuth API calls using hard coded access tokens\nwithin the application.\n\n_Figure 5 Screenshot of the ch.seme.services.LogUService’s openConnection() usage to download the first stage payload_\n\nDepending on what configuration options are set in the “ch.seme.services.Constants.cloud” variable, the method determines which endpoint is\nused to serve the payload to the victim. If the variable is set to “P”, the class uses the pCloud endpoint, if not, it uses Yandex.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Screenshot of the ch.seme.services.LogUService cloud storage if statement_\n\nThe “LogUService” described is launched during application load through “onStart()” within the “HomeActivity” class.\n\n_Figure 7 Screenshot of service launch within ch.seme.client.HomeActivity_\n\nThe service is also checked for when the application is resumed by the user.\n\n_Figure 8 Screenshot of the onResume() method within ch.seme.client.HomeActivity_\n\nThis usage of “DexClassLoader” to dynamically load a Dex file “com.personal.info” from one of two cloud storage endpoints, provides the\napplication functionality to execute first payload on the victim’s device.\n\n**Stage 2: The first payload – Com.Personal.Info.Plugin (Plugin4.0.dex)**\n\nWhen the “LogUService” service is launched, the Dex file downloaded from either pCloud or Yandex, to the directory\n“/data/user/0/ch.seme/files/.temp/”. During our analysis, we were served the payload described below; for simplicity, we have categorised its\nfunctionality in the table shown. However, it should be noted that in our sample analysed, not all of this functionality was being used by the\npayload, as there are many methods that appear to be unutilised.\n\n\n-----\n\ne st pay oad s p a y u ct o a ty s ts t t e c ass ocated at co pe so a o p ug\n\n_Figure 9 Class structure of first payload_\n\nThis “plugin” class, contains various methods that can be called by the C2 and data uploaded back to the cloud storage account:\n\n**Method** **Functionality**\n\n\n**aesEncrypt(),**\n**aesDecrypt()**\n\n\nFile encryption/decryption with AES\n\n\n**appendCL()** Append the call log\n\n**appendLog()** Write over a specific logfile\n\n**AR(), ARStop()** Record audio start and stop\n\n**copyFile()** Copy any file and send back to C2\n\n**createFolder()** Create a new folder\n\n**downloadFile()** Download file cloud storage endpoint\n\n**encryptText()** Encrypt text with RSA key\n\n**fetchContacts()** Get all contacts and their details\n\n**fileEncrypt()** Encrypt files using AES key:“qwertyuiop456789”\n\n**getAddressNumber()** Get address from MMS\n\n**getCurrentIP()** Calls API endpoint ‘http://ip-api[.]com/json/?fields=city,country,query’ to get IP address and location of it.\n\n**getLocation()** Get latitude & longitude\n\n**getPhoneInfo()** Gets the following device\ninformation:BoardBootloaderBrandDeviceDisplayFingerprintHardwareHostIDManufacturerModelProductSerialTagsTim\nversionVersion codenameVersion incrementalVersion releaseVersion SDK INTInstall packages/applications\n\n**getPublicKey()** Get public key from device, decrypt using AES keys: “1qaz2wsx3edc4rfv5tgb6yhn7ujm8ik”“qwertyuiop456789”\n\n**getRealTimeInfo()** Gets the following device information:Current timeNetwork informationBattery powerBattery optimizationDisplay state\n\n**rec()** Provides functionality to initialize recording of the device (audio and media recording)\n\n\n-----\n\n**sendToServer()** Send files back to C2\n\n\n**sms(), send(),**\n**SMSContentObserver(),**\n**appendSM(),**\n**appendSM_R(),**\n**appendMM()**\n\n\nProvides functionality to send, intercept and append SMS & MMS\n\n\n**storage()** Provides functionality to access SD and External data files\n\n**updateCmd()** Initiate CMD\n\n\n**updateState(),**\n**LogState()**\n\n\nupdateState() Provides an update of device information back to C2. This is called by LogState() called initially by the F\n\n\n**uploadFile()** Upload file to cloud storage endpoint\n\n**uploadFile_SAF_P()** Upload a file to external cache directory\n\nHowever, the primary function of the payload is to provide functions to be called by the C2 and for the initial loader to call “LogState”. When\n“LogState” is called by the loader, this calls “updateState”, which then runs a method named “UpdateCmd()”. This method, downloads the\nsecond payload, which we will cover in the next section, titled ‘Stage 3: The second payload & C2 client – com.data.WeCoin’.\n\n_Figure 10 Screenshot of both LogState and UpdateState methods within the first payload_\n\nIt then calls the method “sendData”, which exfiltrates messaging data from the phone, encrypts the files and uploads back to the cloud storage\nC2s.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 Screenshot of sendData exfiltration function within first payload_\n\n**Cloud Storage C2 for Stages 1 & 2.**\n\nTo command and control the first two stages of the malware, the operators of RambleOn use authentication tokens to both pCloud and Yandex\ncloud service providers. In the sample we analysed, the malware was using pCloud.\n\nWhen the loader application starts, the application registers the device for Pushy.me notifications using the Android SDK. Then proceeding to\nrun the “LogUService”, which downloads the first payload from pCloud or Yandex. It then writes the Dex file to the following directory and\nfilename: /data/user/0/ch.seme/files/.temp/plugin4.0.dex. The “LogUService” then uses the DexClassLoader to load the Dex file class “plugin”\nand execute method “LogState”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12 Screenshot of LogUService DexClassLoader utilisation_\n\nThis method, contained within the first payload, proceeds to gather information about the device, exfiltrate all SMS, MMS, call logs, audio and\nmedia and then finally calls “sendToServer()”method to upload files back to the cloud storage service.\n\n_Figure 13 Screenshot of sendToServer() method contained within first payload_\n\nTo receive commands to initiate payload delivery. The registration of the device to Pushy.me allows push message to be sent to the device,\nmuch like Firebase Cloud Messaging.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14 Screenshot of the RegisterForPushNotificationsAsync method called on application start_\n\nWe see that the “com.seme.services.PushReceiver” is set with intent filter designated for the Pushy.me notifications, in addition to the\n“LogUService” class. Providing the class with file receiver functionality.\n\n_Figure 15 Screenshot of Application Manifest file showing application file receivers_\n\nIt is within the “PushReceiver” class, upon receiving a push message, the Default Shared Preferences XML file is modified with content\nrelevant to the cloud storage C2 mechanism. It then proceeds to initialise the “LogUService” service, loading the payload and calling the\nmethod within the payload required by the operator.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16 Screenshot of PushReceiver class_\n\nAs shown in the relevant examples throughout this report, the running of the “LogUService” ensures the application will periodically reach out\nto the cloud provider to download the first payload.\n\n_Figure 17 Screenshot of Burp Suite network proxy traffic from the application_\n\n\n-----\n\ns s a so e su ed by t e ogJobSe ce c ass be g a as a se ce by t e app cat o\n\n_Figure 18 Screenshot of Application Manifest showing service ch.seme.services.LogJobService_\n\nThe class ensures the “LogUService” continually runs in order to keep consistent communication & data exfiltration back to the command-andcontrol cloud service.\n\n_Figure 19 Screenshot of ch.seme.services.LogJobService_\n\n**Stage 3: The second payload & C2 client – com.data.WeCoin**\n\nAs explained in the previous section. The initial loader, in this case, the “Fizzle” application, calls “LogState” within the first payload Dex file.\nThe “LogState” method calls “updateState”, which then calls a method named “UpdateCmd()”. The method, again reaches out to the cloud\nstorage accounts via OAuth API and pulls a second payload down to the device using access tokens. This second payload, is an APK that\ngets installed to the device named “com.data.WeCoin”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20 Screenshot of first payload initiating the second payload_\n\nThis method, then proceeds to load the APK’s service which include additional C2 functionally back to the operator. This APK provides C2\nfunctionality to interact with the first payload Dex file. In order for it to function correctly, the method checks that it can still access the Dex file. If\nit isn’t there, it will redownload the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21 updateCmd() function second payload service runs & payload checks_\n\nOn creation and running of the “com.data.wecoin” application, the application assigns a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) device token and\nsends it back to the operator, allowing the use FCM to command and control the malware. The class “MyFirebaseMessagingService” facilitates\nthe operator to send commands back to the device and initiate functions within the Dex second stage payload. It should be noted that similar\nfunctionality has been described here, (https://medium.com/s2wblog/unveil-the-evolution-of-kimsuky-targeting-android-devices-with-newlydiscovered-mobile-malware-280dae5a650f). This article references functionality utilised by the APT group Kimsuky, whereby they discover the\nusage of FCM to provide C2 functionality within their Android malware. It is also interesting to highlight the importance of the class and method\nname. We noted that throughout our analysis of RambleOn malware, we identified many class and method names that correlate. This of\ncourse is not enough alone to provide solid and direct attribution leads but should be noted highly.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 22 Screenshot of the MyFirebaseMessagingService class implementation_\n\nThe payload itself then registers many services contained within the APK which perform DexClassLoading operations to the secondary\npayload stored on the device. These services can then be run continuously via the C2. These include:\n\nrecService – Executes method rec() in second payload to record audio\nsendJobService – Performs an asynchronous task to continually invoke method send() insecond payloadwhich exfiltrates SMS/MMS\ndata. This functionality is also shown in Figure 11.\nsmsJobService – Executes method sms() in second payload, which provides functionality to send or append SMS.\nupdateStateService – Performs an asynchronous task to continually invoke method updateState(), which calls both send() to exfiltrate\ndata continually & ensures payloads are downloaded. This functionality is described above.\n\n_Figure 23 Services contained in the second payload_\n\nBelow, provides an example of the “sendJobService” class which allows the C2 to trigger a data exfiltration event.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24 Screenshot of sendJobService class contained in the second payload_\n\n**Attribution**\n\nOver the last year, Interlab has been working with human rights activists and journalists to document and index digital threats. Building a\ndatabase of these threats, allow us to provide correlation between events based on categorised elements within each individual attack. To\nsupport this, we use the Diamond model to facilitate correlations for attribution. The diamond model relies upon indexing elements of an attack\nbased on four categories: Adversary attributes (source email, handles, phone numbers, network assets etc), infrastructure (IP addresses,\ndomain names, email addresses etc), victimology (modus operandi, targeted individual or organisational, personas, network assets, email\naddresses etc), capabilities (malware, exploits, hack tools, stolen certificates etc).\n\nDuring our analysis of RambleOn, we found very little data points within our dataset that support clear and direct attribution for this event.\nHowever, there are multiple aspects that should be noted that can enrich further attribution in the future:\n\n1. Victimology: The victimology of this event fits very closely with the modus operandi of groups such as APT 37 & Kimsuky.\n\n2. Infrastructure: It should also be noted that the utilisation of pCloud and Yandex storage for payload delivery and command and control\n\nhave been seen to be somewhat consistently utilised by APT 37 (reference: https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID242/images/rpt_APT37.pdf)\n\n3. Capabilities: The utilisation of Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) has recently been seen within Android malware for a\n\ncampaign attributed to Kimsuky (reference: https://medium.com/s2wblog/unveil-the-evolution-of-kimsuky-targeting-android-devices-withnewly-discovered-mobile-malware-280dae5a650f). It is also noted, that within this malware referenced, we identified a large amount of\nmethod and class name correlations which indicate some familiarity between the samples.\n\nWe believe that raising these points allows for a pragmatic approach to the potentiality of attribution by other researchers going forward.\n\n**IOC Index**\n\nTo support research across the digital rights and information security industry, we have made the samples available to all publicly on VirusTotal\n[and https://malshare.com/.](https://malshare.com/)\n\n**File Description** **Sha256**\n\n**Stage 1: Fizzle App** 97d8aed87ec78d975aaff4a63415badf95635616686a7ad4a3257e02b6ca2400\n\n**Stage 2: Dex payload** 0dadf1240fd097d15dee890d448cfab02d3ef8698bdc44e18f1b5495e500655f\n\n**Stage 3: com.data.WeCoin** 751e67116e71b0a04bce6cabfa748fc105238ed1dd5b7d72f6d3f6301bbcad17\n\n_Interlab is a non-profit organization based in Seoul with mission to create resilient digital safety net for freedom of citizens, providing free digital_\n_security consultations, trainings, incident response support and research of cyber threat toward civic society._\n\n_For any inquiries regarding on this report, please reach us through contact@interlab.or.kr_\n\n\n-----",
