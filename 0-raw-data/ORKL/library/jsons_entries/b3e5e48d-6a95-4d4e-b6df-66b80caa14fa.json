This blog article explains the details of the attack confirmed by JPCERT/CC\nand GobRAT malware, which was used in the attack.\n\n### Attack flow up to malware execution\n\nInitially, the attacker targets a router whose WEBUI is open to the public, executes scripts\npossibly by using vulnerabilities, and finally infects the GobRAT. Figure 1 shows the flow of\nthe attack until GobRAT infects the router.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Attack Flow\n\n**Loader Script works as a loader, containing functions such as generating various scripts**\nand downloading GobRAT. The SSH public key, which is assumed to be used for the\nbackdoor, is hard-coded in the script. In addition, since Loader Script uses crontab to\nregister the file path of Start Script for persistence, GobRAT does not have such function.\nThe functions of Loader Script are as follows:\n\nDisable Firewall function\nDownload GobRAT for the target machine's architecture\nCreate Start Script and make it persistent\nCreate and run Daemon Script.\nRegister a SSH public key in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nFigure 2 is the code of Start Script that executes GobRAT. The script is unique in that it\nwrites the startup time to a file named restart.log. In addition, this script executes GobRAT\nunder the file name apached to make it look like a legitimate process.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Start Script\n\nFigure 3 is the code of Daemon Script. This script checks whether Start Script is running or\nnot every 20 seconds, and if not, it starts the script. This code has been possibly prepared in\ncase Start Script is terminated unexpectedly.\n\nFigure 3: Daemon Script\n\n### GobRAT Overview\n\nGobRAT is a RAT written in Go language and communicates with C2 server via TLS and\nexecutes various commands. It is packed with UPX version 4 series, and samples for various\narchitectures such as ARM, MIPS, x86, and x86-64 have been confirmed. GobRAT performs\nthe following checks at startup and keeps the information within the sample itself.\n\nIP address and MAC address of itself\nUptime by uptime command\nNetwork communication status by /proc/net/dev\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following sections describes the GobRAT s communication method, encryption method,\nand commands to be executed.\n\n### Communication method\n\nGobRAT uses TLS to send and receive data with its C2 server. Figure 4 shows an example\nof communication with the C2 server. The first 4 bytes indicate the size of the data, and the\nrest is gob[1] data. gob is a data serialization protocol available only in Go language.\nGobRAT uses gob for receiving commands and sending the results of command execution.\n\nFigure 4: Example of communication content\n\nGobRAT defines gob data as a PACKAGE structure in the sample as follows.\n```\ntype PACKAGE struct {\n\n  Type uint8         // CommandID\n\n  BotCount uint16       // Parameter\n\n  BotList []string      // Command Parameter\n\n  ParamLength uint16     // Length of Param\n\n  Param map[string]string   // Command Parameter\n\n  Content []uint8       // Command Parameter, Command Execution Result, etc\n\n}\n\n\n```\nThe fields used are different depending on the type of command, and string arrays, maps,\nand binary data are supported so that various types of parameters can be passed. In\naddition, while binary data can be stored in Content of the PACKAGE structure, map data\nwith string is converted to binary data by encoding it with the json.Marshal function. The\nPACKAGE structure is used in various ways depending on the command, such as storing the\ndata in Content, or converting the defined structure to binary data in the same way and\nstoring it in Content.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Encryption Method\n\nStrings such as C2 and Linux commands are encrypted and stored in the sample. Figure 5\nshows the GobRAT's decryption function. AES128 CTR mode is used to decrypt strings, and\nthe key and IV are hard-coded in the sample. The same key\n(050CFE3706380723433807193E03FE2F) and IV (\"12345678abcdefgh\") are used in all\nthe confirmed samples. In addition, as shown in Figure 6, the codes that have probably been\ndeveloped by the attacker, such as this decryption function, has a unique folder structure like\n**aaa.com/bbb/me~.**\n\nFigure 5: String decryption function\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Characteristic folder structure\n\n### Commands executed\n\nGobRAT has 22 commands that are executed by the commands from the C2 server, and we\nhave identified the following commands. Since the malware targets routers, you can see that\nmost functions are related to communication, such as frpc, socks5, and reconfiguration of\nC2. See Appendix A for command details.\n\nObtain machine Information\nExecute reverse shell\nRead/write files\nConfigure new C2 and protocol\nStart socks5\nExecute file in /zone/frpc\nAttempt to login to sshd, Telnet, Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL services running on\nanother machine\n\n\n-----\n\n### GobRAT Analysis Tools\n\nSince GobRAT uses gob for communication, if you want to emulate its communication with\nC2 to check commands, you need to create a program using Go language. Our C2\nemulation tool that supports GobRAT analysis is available on GitHub. Please download it\nfrom the following webpage for your analysis.\n\n**JPCERTCC/aa-tools/GobRAT-Analysis - GitHub**\n\n[https://github.com/JPCERTCC/aa-tools/tree/master/GobRAT-Analysis](https://github.com/JPCERTCC/aa-tools/tree/master/GobRAT-Analysis)\n\n### In Closing\n\nIn recent years, different types of malware using Go language have been confirmed, and the\nGobRAT malware confirmed this time uses gob, which can only be handled by Go language,\nfor communication. Please continuously beware of malware that infects routers, not limited to\nGobRAT, since they are difficult to detect. Please refer to Appendix B for C2 of the malware,\nAppendix C for the hash value of the script, and Appendix D for the hash value of the\nmalware.\n\nYuma Masubuchi\n\nTranslated by Takumi Nakano\n\n**Appendix A: Commands**\n\nTableA: GobRAT commands\n\n**Value** **Contents**\n\n0x0 Update json data held in malware and acquire update results\n\n0x1 Retrieve json data held in malware\n\n0x3 Start reverse shell\n\n0x4 End of reverse shell connection\n\n0x6 Confirmation of reverse shell connection\n\n0x7 Execute shell command for daemon\n\n0x8 Execute shell command\n\n0xD Read/write specified file\n\n0x10,0x11 Read/write specified file\n\n0x16 Obtain various machine information such as df command\n\n\n-----\n\n**Value** **Contents**\n\n0x17 Set new communication channel for TCP\n\n0x18 Execute SOCKS5 proxy with specified port and password\n\n0x19 Execute SOCKS5 proxy on specified port\n\n0x1a New communication channel setting for UDP\n\n0x1b Execute frpc after executing SOCKS5 proxy on port 5555\n\n0x1f Check for the existence of the specified file\n\n0x25 Login attempts for SSH, telenet, redis, mysql, postgres\n\n0x27 Configuration of specified goroutine\n\n0x2a Scan to HTTP/HTTPS service of specified IP\n\n0x2D Dictionary attack to HTTP/HTTPS service of specified IP\n\n0x30 C2 configuration related\n\n0x31 DDoS attacks on SYN, TCP, UDP, HTTP, ICMP\n\n**Appendix B: C2**\n\nhttps[:]//su.vealcat[.]com\nhttp[:]//su.vealcat[.]com:58888\nhttps[:]//ktlvz.dnsfailover[.]net\nhttp[:]//ktlvz.dnsfailover[.]net:58888\nsu.vealcat[.]com\nktlvz.dnsfailover[.]net\nwpksi.mefound[.]com\n\n**Appendix C: Hash values of the scripts**\n\n060acb2a5df6560acab9989d6f019fb311d88d5511f3eda0effcbd9fc6bd12bb\nfeaef47defd8b4988e09c8b11967e20211b54e16e6df488780e2490d7c7fa02a\n3e44c807a25a56f4068b5b8186eee5002eed6f26d665a8b791c472ad154585d1\n60bcd645450e4c846238cf0e7226dc40c84c96eba99f6b2cffcd0ab4a391c8b3\n\n**Appendix D: Hash values of the malware**\n\na8b914df166fd0c94106f004e8ca0ca80a36c6f2623f87a4e9afe7d86b5b2e3a\naeed77896de38802b85a19bfcb8f2a1d567538ddc1b045bcdb29cb9e05919b60\n6748c22d76b8803e2deb3dad1e1fa7a8d8ff1e968eb340311fd82ea5d7277019\ne133e05d6941ef1c2e3281f1abb837c3e152fdeaffefde84ffe25338fe02c56d\n\n\n-----\n\n43dc911a2e396791dc5a0f8996ae77ac527add02118adf66ac5c56291269527e\naf0292e4de92032ede613dc69373de7f5a182d9cbba1ed49f589ef484ad1ee3e\n2c1566a2e03c63b67fbdd80b4a67535e9ed969ea3e3013f0ba503cfa58e287e3\n98c05ae70e69e3585fc026e67b356421f0b3d6ab45b45e8cc5eb35f16fef130c\n300a92a67940cfafeed1cf1c0af25f4869598ae58e615ecc559434111ab717cd\na363dea1efda1991d6c10cc637e3ab7d8e4af4bd2d3938036f03633a2cb20e88\n0c280f0b7c16c0d299e306d2c97b0bff3015352d2b3299cf485de189782a4e25\nf962b594a847f47473488a2b860094da45190738f2825d82afc308b2a250b5fb\n4ceb27da700807be6aa3221022ef59ce6e9f1cda52838ae716746c1bbdee7c3d\n3e1a03f1dd10c3e050b5f455f37e946c214762ed9516996418d34a246daed521\n3bee59d74c24ef33351dc31ba697b99d41c8898685d143cd48bccdff707547c0\nc71ff7514c8b7c448a8c1982308aaffed94f435a65c9fdc8f0249a13095f665e\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Gobs of data\n\n[https://go.dev/blog/gob](https://go.dev/blog/gob)\n\n[Email](mailto:?subject=GobRAT%20malware%20written%20in%20Go%20language%20targeting%20Linux%20routers&body=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.jpcert.or.jp%2Fen%2F2023%2F05%2Fgobrat.html)\n\nAuthor\n\n増渕 [維摩(Yuma Masubuchi)](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/masubuchi/)\n\nYuma has been engaged in malware analysis and coordination of cyber security incidents in\nJPCERT/CC Incident Response Group since November 2020.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\n0 people found this content helpful.\n\nIf you wish to make comments or ask questions, please use this form.\n\nThis form is for comments and inquiries.
