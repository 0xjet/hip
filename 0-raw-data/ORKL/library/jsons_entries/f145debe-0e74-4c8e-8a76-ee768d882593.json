Targeting both government mailboxes and e-commerce transactions, as_\nwell as aiding in malware distribution, this diverse class of threats operates by eavesdropping on and tampering with the server’s\ncommunications.\n\nAlong with a complete breakdown of the newly discovered families, our new paper, Anatomy of native IIS malware, provides a\ncomprehensive guide to help fellow security researchers and defenders detect, dissect and mitigate this class of server-side\nthreats. In this blogpost, we summarize the findings of the white paper.\n\nToday, we are also launching a series of blogposts where we introduce the most notable of the newly discovered IIS malware\n[families, as case studies of how this type of malware is used for cybercrime,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/06/iistealer-server-side-threat-ecommerce-transactions/) [cyberespionage and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/09/iispy-complex-server-side-backdoor-antiforensic-features/) [SEO fraud.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/11/iiserpent-malware-driven-seo-fraud-service/)\n\n[The findings of our IIS malware research were first presented at Black Hat USA 2021 and will also be shared with the community](https://www.blackhat.com/us-21/briefings/schedule/#anatomy-of-native-iis-malware-23395)\nat the [Virus Bulletin 2021 conference on October 8 .th](https://vblocalhost.com/presentations/anatomy-of-native-iis-malware/)\n\n[Anatomy of native IIS malware](https://i.blackhat.com/USA21/Wednesday-Handouts/us-21-Anatomy-Of-Native-Iis-Malware-wp.pdf)\n\n[Download Research Paper](https://i.blackhat.com/USA21/Wednesday-Handouts/us-21-Anatomy-Of-Native-Iis-Malware-wp.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nIIS is Microsoft Windows web server software with an extensible, modular architecture that, since v7.0, supports two types of\nextensions – native (C++ DLL) and managed (.NET assembly) modules. Focusing on malicious native IIS modules, we have found\nover 80 unique samples used in the wild and categorized them into 14 malware families – 10 of which were previously\nundocumented. ESET security solutions detect these families as Win{32,64}/BadIIS and Win{32,64}/Spy.IISniff.\n\n## How IIS malware operates\n\nIIS malware is a diverse class of threats used for cybercrime, cyberespionage, and SEO fraud – but in all cases, its main purpose\nis to intercept HTTP requests incoming to the compromised IIS server and affect how the server responds to (some of) these\nrequests.\n\nWith the default installation, IIS itself is persistent, so there is no need for extension-based IIS malware to implement additional\npersistence mechanisms. Once configured as an IIS extension, the malicious IIS module is loaded by the IIS Worker Process\n(w3wp.exe), which handles requests sent to the server – this is where IIS malware can interfere with the request processing.\n\nWe identified five main modes in which IIS malware operates, as illustrated in Figure 1:\n\n_IIS backdoors allow their operators to remotely control the compromised computer with IIS installed_\n_IIS infostealers allow their operators to intercept regular traffic between the compromised server and its legitimate visitors, to_\nsteal information such as login credentials and payment information. Using HTTPS doesn’t prevent this attack, as IIS\nmalware can access all data handled by the server – which is where the data is processed in its unencrypted state.\n_IIS injectors modify HTTP responses sent to legitimate visitors to serve malicious content_\n_IIS proxies turn the compromised server into an unwitting part of the C&C infrastructure for another malware family, and_\nmisuse the IIS server to relay communication between victims of that malware and the real C&C server\n_SEO fraud IIS malware modifies the content served to search engines to manipulate SERP algorithms and boost the ranking_\nfor other websites of interest to the attackers\n\n_Figure 1. Overview of IIS malware mechanisms_\n\nAll of these malware types are discussed at length in the paper.\n\n## How (and where) it spreads\n\nNative IIS modules have unrestricted access to any resource available to the server worker process – thus, administrative rights\nare required to install native IIS malware. This considerably narrows down the options for the initial attack vector. We have seen\nevidence for two scenarios:\n\nIIS malware spreading as a trojanized version of a legitimate IIS module\nIIS malware spreading through server exploitation\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, between March and June 2021, we detected a wave of IIS backdoors spread via the Microsoft Exchange pre\n[authentication RCE vulnerability chain (CVE-2021-26855,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26855) [CVE-2021-26857,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26857) [CVE-2021-26858, and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26858) [CVE-2021-27065), aka](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27065)\nProxyLogon. Targeted specifically were Exchange servers that have Outlook on the web (aka OWA) enabled – as IIS is used to\nimplement OWA, these were a particularly interesting target for espionage.\n\n[After our colleagues reported the first such case in March 2021, we have detected four more campaigns of various IIS backdoors](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/)\nspreading to Microsoft Exchange servers through the same vulnerability. To complement our telemetry, we have performed\ninternet-wide scans to detect the presence of these backdoors, which allowed us to identify and notify other victims of the malware.\n\nFigure 2 shows the geographical locations of servers affected by these five campaigns, using data from our telemetry and internetwide scans.\n\n_Figure 2. Victims of native IIS backdoors spread via the ProxyLogon vulnerability chain_\n\nThe following entities were among the victims:\n\nGovernment institutions in three countries in Southeast Asia\nA major telecommunications company in Cambodia\nA research institution in Vietnam\nDozens of private companies in a range of industries, located mostly in Canada, Vietnam and India, and others in the USA,\nNew Zealand, South Korea, and other countries\n\nNote that while IIS backdoors may be well-suited for spying on high-profile mailboxes, victims of IIS malware are not limited to\ncompromised servers – all legitimate visitors of the websites hosted by these servers are potential targets, as the malware can be\nused to steal sensitive data from the visitors (IIS infostealers) or serve malicious content (IIS injectors). Please refer to the full\n[white paper for the details on the targets of the other analyzed IIS families.](https://i.blackhat.com/USA21/Wednesday-Handouts/us-21-Anatomy-Of-Native-Iis-Malware-wp.pdf)\n\n## The insides of native IIS malware\n\nFrom the technical perspective, all types of native IIS malware are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), written using the\n[IIS C++ API. Any such DLL must:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/native-code-api-reference)\n\n[Implement a class inherited from either the CHttpModule or](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/chttpmodule-class) [CGlobalModule class (or both), and override a number of that](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/cglobalmodule-class)\nclass’s methods (event handlers)\nExport the [RegisterModule function, which is the library entry point, responsible for creating the instances of these classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/web-development-reference/native-code-api-reference/pfn-registermodule-function)\nand registering the implemented handlers for server events, as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. A typical RegisterModule function of native IIS malware_\n\n_Server events refer to the steps that the IIS server takes during request processing (see Figure 4), but also to other actions taken_\nby the server (for example, sending an HTTP response). These events generate event notifications, which are handled by event\n_handlers implemented in the server’s modules (see Figure 5)._\n\n_Figure 4. HTTP request-processing pipeline in IIS_\n\nIn short, the event handlers (or the methods of IIS module core classes) are where the IIS malware functionality is implemented\nand where any reverse engineers should focus their analysis. For a deep dive into IIS malware essentials and how to analyze such\nbinaries, refer to the _[Anatomy of native IIS malware section of our white paper.](https://i.blackhat.com/USA21/Wednesday-Handouts/us-21-Anatomy-Of-Native-Iis-Malware-wp.pdf#page=13)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Event handlers: methods of the module classes, CHttpModule and CGlobalModule_\n\n## Network communication\n\nA notable feature of IIS malware is how it communicates with its operators. Malicious IIS modules, especially IIS backdoors, don’t\nusually create new connections to their C&C servers. They work as passive implants, allowing the attackers to control them by\nproviding some “secret” in an HTTP request sent to the compromised IIS web server. That’s why IIS backdoors usually have a\nmechanism to recognize attacker requests that are used to control the server and have a predefined structure, such as:\n\nURL or request body matching a specific regex\nA specific custom HTTP header present\nAn embedded token (in the URL, request body or one of the headers) matching a hardcoded password\nA hash value of an embedded token matching a hardcoded value\nA more complex condition – for example, a relationship between all of the above\n\n_Figure 6. Passive C&C communication channel (IIS backdoors)_\n\nOn the other hand, some IIS malware categories do implement an alternative C&C channel – using protocols such as HTTP or\nDNS – to obtain the current configuration on the fly. For example, an IIS injector contacts its C&C server every time there is a new\nrequest from a legitimate visitor of the compromised website, and uses the server response to modify the content served to that\nvisitor (such as malicious code or adware).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Alternative C&C communication mechanism (IIS injectors)_\n\nTable 1 summarizes how the C&C channels, as well as other notable techniques, are implemented by the 14 analyzed IIS malware\nfamilies.\n\n_Table 1.

The following recommendations could help make their work harder:\n\nUse dedicated accounts with strong, unique passwords for the administration of the IIS server. Require multifactor\nauthentication (MFA) for these accounts. Monitor the usage of these accounts.\nRegularly patch your OS, and carefully consider which services are exposed to the internet, to reduce the risk of server\nexploitation.\nConsider using a web application firewall, and/or endpoint security solution on your IIS server.\nNative IIS modules have unrestricted access to any resource available to the server worker process; you should only install\nnative IIS modules from trusted sources to avoid downloading their trojanized versions. Be especially aware of modules\npromising too-good-to-be-true features such as magically improving SEO.\nRegularly check the IIS server configuration to verify that all the installed native modules are legitimate (signed by a trusted\nprovider, or installed on purpose).\n\n[For details on how to detect and remove IIS malware, refer to the Mitigation section of the white paper. We are also publishing a](https://i.blackhat.com/USA21/Wednesday-Handouts/us-21-Anatomy-Of-Native-Iis-Malware-wp.pdf#page=32)\nset of [YARA rules that you can leverage to detect all the 14 analyzed IIS malware families.](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/badiis)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nInternet Information Services web servers have been targeted by various malicious actors, for cybercrime and cyberespionage\nalike. The software’s modular architecture, designed to provide extensibility for web developers, can be a useful tool for attackers\nto become a part of the IIS server, and intercept or modify its traffic.\n\nIt is still quite rare for endpoint (and other) security software to run on IIS servers, which makes it easy for attackers to operate\nunnoticed for long periods of time. This should be disturbing for all serious web portals that want to protect their visitors’ data,\nincluding authentication and payment information. Organizations that use OWA should also pay attention, as it depends on IIS and\ncould be an interesting target for espionage.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile IIS server threats are not limited to native IIS malware, we believe this paper will be a helpful starting point for defenders for\nunderstanding, identifying, and removing IIS threats, and a guide to our fellow researchers to reverse engineer this class of threats\nand understand their common tactics, techniques and procedures.\n\n_Additional technical details on the malware and Indicators of Compromise can be found in our comprehensive white paper, and on_\n_[GitHub.
