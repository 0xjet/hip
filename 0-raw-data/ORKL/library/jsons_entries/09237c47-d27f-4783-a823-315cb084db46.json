Written predominantly in Python, Mythic](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver)\nprovides cross-platform payload creation options (Linux, MacOS, and Windows). With an\nactive development community, and ‘plug-n-play’ functionality for its various (also opensource) agents, the technical entry barrier for users is comparatively low.\n\nMythic is therefore attractive to threat actors of varying skill sets; for the lower-skilled actor\nthe ‘plug-n-play’ capabilities mean they can use the framework and additional agents ‘off-theshelf’. In the case of higher-skilled actors, the framework’s flexibility for customization might\nbe used to evade detection mechanisms based on ‘known’ fingerprints.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n- Although dwarfed by Cobalt Strike, the number of online internet-facing Mythic servers\noutnumbers a number of other ‘common’ C2 frameworks, including Sliver.\n\n- Mythic was observed being deployed alongside reNgine, a powerful reconnaissance tool.\n\n- Connections to an operator identified previously utilizing Sliver, potentially in Pakistanfocused activities.\n\n- Low confidence ties to e-crime operators have been identified within open source\nreporting.\n\n**Identification of Mythic Servers**\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the first quarter of 2021, the number of online Mythic servers has generally remained\nstatic; with 76 servers online at the time of writing - for ease of access we have used data\nfrom Shodan for this illustration.\n\nFigure 1: Online Mythic Servers\n\nComparing this to other C2 frameworks (including Cobalt Strike), Mythic accounts for about\n2% of the current ‘market share’ – interestingly, about 8x more prevalent than Sliver at\npresent.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: C2 Framework Market Share\n\nWhilst 76 servers may seem like a low number, this only accounts for internet-facing\ninfrastructure and likely doesn’t include many of the Mythic instances being used for red\nteam operations within closed / controlled environments.\n\nWith that being said, Cobalt Strike remains the most prevalent framework in use today.\nTherefore, the purpose of this blog series is not to suggest defenders divert resources away\nfrom the detection of Cobalt Strike as a threat vector, but merely to heighten awareness of\nemerging and plausible alternatives.\n\n**Mythic in the Wild?**\n\n\n-----\n\nReviewing the currently online Mythic servers, most of them (90%) fit a default profile, with\ndetails for the web portal port, SSL certificate, etc. having not been altered from the ‘out-ofthe-box’ settings.\n\nDefault settings:\n\n- Port - 7443\n\n- SSL certificate - Issuer: O=Mythic\n\nIn cases where these settings were modified, we have observed cases of re-use, where\nmodified configurations were seemingly copied from box to box over time. In doing this,\nactors leave behind an attributable trail which makes tracking from C2 server to C2 server\npossible.\n\nFor example, by following E-Tag information (present in HTTP headers), we were able to tie\nmultiple Mythic servers together. From this starting point we start to ‘zoom in’ on activities\nutilizing the Mythic framework, shedding light on some of the use cases.\n\nMythic + reNgine\n\nWe were able to follow this particular operator for a number of months, based on a recurring\nE-Tag value. In addition to Mythic, this operator was also observed using a reconnaissance\n[framework called ‘reNgine’.](https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Identified Operator Infrastructure\n\nBased on observed certificate information (CN = redteamtools.msfven0m[.]xyz), this\ninfrastructure was likely used by a red team operator to target multiple customer\norganizations - although the potential for a false flag cannot be ruled out.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Certificate for 47.243.104.222\n\nIn this case the scenario was quite simple, reNgine was first used to scan port 443 on the\nvictim server, seeking vulnerabilities which would allow initial compromise / exploitation. A\nMythic beacon was then dropped on a victim machine for management of the exfiltration\nstage.\n\n**As a side note, reNgine is another powerful tool which blue team operators should**\n**become familiar with. At the time of writing, approximately 920 online reNgine servers**\n**were identifiable.**\n\nMythic + Pakistani Focus\n\n[In our blog on Sliver, we identified a campaign which appeared to target both Pakistan and](https://team-cymru.com/blog/2022/05/03/sliver-case-study-assessing-common-offensive-security-tools/)\nTurkey, based on the domain names observed. Whilst hunting for Mythic servers, we\nidentified a similar domain ‘rd.mofa-pk[.]org’ - which appears to target the Pakistani Ministry\nof Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe domain mofa-pk[.]org was most recently hosted on 3.239.29.103 (assigned to AMAZONAES), amongst the other domains hosted on this IP are:\n\n- nationalhelpdesk[.]pk\n\n- sngpl.org[.]pk\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth of these domains were highlighted in our Sliver blog as being connected to the same\nactivity, as outlined below:\n\nFigure 5: Excerpt from the Sliver Blog\n\nIt would appear that the operator behind this linked infrastructure makes use of a diverse\nrange of C2 frameworks in their activities. Our investigations into this cluster continue.\n\nMythic + Bazarloader / Bazarbackdoor?\n\nIn June 2022, a researcher shared a new Mythic C2 framework on Twitter with a slightly\ndifferent web login panel. The default login panel for a Mythic C2 contains the Mythic logo,\nbut in this case, the page contained this “Botleggers Club” image:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 5: Source - https://twitter.com/benkow_/status/1542047469860683777](https://twitter.com/benkow_/status/1542047469860683777)\n\n[The “Botleggers Club” was mentioned in the Conti Leaks as a panel to manage /](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uORuVVQzZ0A)\nadministrate and interact with clients (the bots), and also to deliver malware (BazarLoader /\nBazarBackdoor).\n\n\n-----\n\nBy pivoting on E-Tag values once again, a number of IP addresses were identified, sharing\nthe same details as the Mythic C2 mentioned above (cryptolvl-rsa-check[.]com):\n\n- 139.59.72.48\n\n- 147.189.169.143\n\n- 159.223.193.246\n\n- 203.28.246.137\n\n- 34.240.115.152\n\n- 43.142.60.207\n\nHowever, after this information (the Tweet) was publicly exposed, the server configurations\nwere modified and now only one of these IPs is displaying the same E-Tag. It is likely that the\nother servers were either shut down, or moved elsewhere with updated configurations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom a technical point of view, Mythic has all of the advantages of Cobalt Strike (or any of\nthe most popular C2 frameworks). Based on the number of commits, issues, and pull\nrequests on GitHub, the community is highly active in contributing to the development of the\nframework. In other forums, such as Twitter, we also observe researchers sharing their tips\nand tools for the improvement of Mythic functionality.\n\nAs noted already, Cobalt Strike remains the most popular C2 framework, but we wouldn’t be\nsurprised to see growth in the use of Mythic in the near future. Indeed for some red team\noperators, this trend is already occurring - we would expect that malicious actors have taken\nnote and are either considering or have already adopted the use of Mythic into their TTPs.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n\n-----\n\nNote - only the most recently active Mythic C2 servers are shared.\n\nDomains\n\ncisco-update.com\n\ncorpse.sh\n\nidinfosystems.com\n\nlinux-sec.top\n\nlive-office365.com\n\nmofa-pk.org\n\nonerule.digital\n\nv56119.php-friends.de\n\nIP Addresses\n\n101.35.90.253\n\n103.134.19.126\n\n139.162.8.112\n\n139.59.144.58\n\n139.59.249.255\n\n142.93.166.252\n\n142.93.246.237\n\n159.223.234.22\n\n3.212.113.251\n\n3.96.54.147\n\n46 243 186 22\n\n\n-----\n\n47.96.177.12\n\n5.2.79.164\n\n54.173.67.191\n\nMitre Att&ck Matrix:\n\nThis Mitre Att&ck Matrix is a summary of the combined capabilities of every Mythic agent\n(Apollo, Athena, Tetanus, etc.):\n\n\n**Technique** **Technique**\n**ID**\n\n\n**Observable**\n\n\nScheduled Task/Job T1053 ​\n\nProcess Injection T1055 Spawns Processes\n\n\nObfuscated Files or\nInformation\n\n\nT1027 ​\n\n\nSoftware Packing T1027.002 ​\n\nTimestomp T1070.006 Suspicious Timestamp\n\n\nVirtualization/Sandbox\nEvasion\n\n\nT1497 ​\n\n\nDisable or Modify Tools T1562.001 Guard pages creation\n\n\nRemote System\nDiscovery\n\n\nT1018 Reads host file\n\n\nProcess Discovery T1057 Query running processes\n\n\n-----\n\nSystem Information\nDiscovery\n\nSecurity Software\nDiscovery\n\n\nT1082 Read machine GUID, software policy, volume\ninformation\n\nT1518.001 ​\n\n\nDLL Side-Loading T1574.002 Load missing DLLs\n\nNative API T1016 ​\n\n\nApplication Wide\nDiscovery\n\n\nT1010 Monitors Window changes\n\n\nSystem Time Discovery T1124 ​\n\nApplication Layer Protocol T1071 Perform DNS lookups\n\n\n-----",
