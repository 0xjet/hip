Examples include\naccessibility, audio record, read SMS, read/ write storage, get account list, disabling the keylock, making\ncalls, and accessing precise device location.\n\nEverything that the malware collects is uploaded to the C2 server, including SMS call logs, key logs,\nnotifications, and Google Authenticator codes.\n\n**Code to snatch Google Authenticator codes** _(Cyble)_\nThe above is enough to help the crooks overcome two-factor authentication obstacles when assuming\ncontrol of e-banking accounts.\n\n2FA codes arrive via SMS or are stored and rotated in HMAC software-based tools like Google's\nAuthenticator. The latter is considered safer due to not being susceptible to SIM swap attacks, but it's still\nnot protected from malware infiltrating the userspace.\n\nMoreover, the addition of VNC Viewer, a cross-platform screen sharing utility with remote control features,\ngives the threat actors a new powerful weapon to do whatever they want when the device is unattended.\n\n**VNC Viewer code in Aberebot** _(Cyble)_\nApart from the above, Aberebot can also record audio clips or take screenshots and exfiltrate both to the\nactor-controlled C2, with the complete list of supported commands listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table of commands accepted by Aberebot** _(Cyble)_\n\n## Should we be concerned?\n\nIt is still early to tell how popular the new Escobar malware will become in the cybercrime community,\nespecially at a relatively high price. Nevertheless, it's now powerful enough to entice a wider audience.\n\nAlso, its operational model, which involves random actors that can rent it, means its distribution channels\nand methods may vary greatly.\n\nIn general, you can minimize the chances of being infected with Android trojans by avoiding the installation\nof APKs outside of Google Play, using a mobile security tool, and ensuring that Google Play Protect is\nenabled on your device.\n\nAdditionally, when installing a new app from any source, pay attention to unusual requests for permissions\nand monitor the app's battery and network consumption stats for the first few days to identify any\nsuspicious patterns.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Top 10 Android banking trojans target apps with 1 billion downloads](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/top-10-android-banking-trojans-target-apps-with-1-billion-downloads/)\n\n[QBot now pushes Black Basta ransomware in bot-powered attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-now-pushes-black-basta-ransomware-in-bot-powered-attacks/)\n\n[SMSFactory Android malware sneakily subscribes to premium services](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/smsfactory-android-malware-sneakily-subscribes-to-premium-services/)\n\n[Mobile trojan detections rise as malware distribution level declines](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mobile-trojan-detections-rise-as-malware-distribution-level-declines/)\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[Aberebot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/aberebot/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Banking Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/banking-trojan/)\n[Google Authenticator](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/google-authenticator/)\n[MFA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mfa/)\n[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/multi-factor-authentication/)\n[Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/trojan/)\n[VNC](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vnc/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience working on\nvarious online publications.
