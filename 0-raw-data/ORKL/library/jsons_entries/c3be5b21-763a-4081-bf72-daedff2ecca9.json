Although Windows will likely stay the predominant leader of the pack, Mac OS\ncontinues to grow year over year, both in consumer and commercial markets. Likewise,\nmalware for Windows is also by far the most common, but malware for Mac OS is gaining\npopularity.\n\nA few weeks ago, a sample came across that was interesting – a Java dropper that had\nsupport for both Windows and Mac OS. Depending on the operating system, the dropper\nwould decrypt one of the two encrypted pieces of malware stored as a resource and run it.\nCross platform malware, using languages such as Java or Golang, is relatively uncommon,\nbut continues to gain popularity as the consumer and commercial markets diversify between\nWindows and Mac.\n\n## Java Dropper\n```\nFilename: Statement SKBMT 09818.jar\nMD5: 3f471e4079fe67cbc77f5705975d26fd\nSHA1:7f55519e3fc02feace1e4bc55d984eef6eb24353\nSHA256: 151d3313216b97f76fec2c0450d26de34aeb0c6817365fe3484a532b4443ed4a\n\n```\n[This Java Dropper was received via a phishing email attachment. Zipdump provided a](https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/zipdump.py)\npreview of the contents of the JAR file:\n\nFigure 1: Java Dropper Contents\nThe preview from zipdump details the contents inside the JAR file, namely:\n\n2 Class files\n\n\n-----\n\n3 Resources\n\nThe MANIFEST.MF file provided the main class and starting point for the JAR file,\nOBSrz.class.\n\nFigure 2: MANIFEST.MF File Contents\nJAR files/Java Class files can be analyzed using a Java Decompiler, such as [JD Project,](http://java-decompiler.github.io/)\n[Procyon and](https://github.com/ststeiger/procyon) [CFR.](https://www.benf.org/other/cfr/)\n\n## oBSrz.Class\n\nOnce decompiled using CFR, OBSrz is straightforward to read as there is no obfuscation\nhampering analysis.\n\nFigure 3: OBSrz.class (main) Decompiled\nFirst, the dropper checks for the operating system via the GetOS function to determine which\nencrypted resource to decrypt.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: GetOS Function\nNext, the dropper gets the filename based on the operating system identified from GetOS.\n\nFigure 5: Get_Crypted_Filename (mach_o vs exe)\nFinally, once the OS has been determined and the correct filename has been chosen, the\ndropper writes the file to disk and executes it (if Mac OS, it also changes the permissions to\nRWX first). Once the process is running, it will finally overwrite the file with a .ico file and\ndisplay it.\n\n## Resource Decryption\n\n\n-----\n\nThe three resources are encrypted using AES. The decryption function is quite simple. It\ntakes the first 16 bytes of a SHA1 hashed string as the key and decrypts using AES-128\n(ECB). A quick [Python script can be used to decrypt the resources. Once decrypted, the](https://github.com/MuziSec/malware_analysis_scripts/blob/main/jar_dropper_payload_extractor.py)\nfollowing files become evident:\n\nNVFFY: MS Windows icon resource – 1 icon, 32×32, 32 bits/pixel\nfI4sWHk: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows\nkIbwf02ld: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n\n## Snake Keylogger\n\nThe malware decrypted and executed if the dropper is run on a Windows machine is Snake\nKeylogger (aka 404 Keylogger), a subscription based .NET keylogger with many capabilities.\nThe infostealer can steal sensitive information, log keyboard strokes, take screenshots and\nextract information from the system clipboard.\n\nThe Snake sample analyzed in this post was packed to avoid detection by EDR and AV\nproducts. The packer starts by decoding a .NET resource using\n```\nColorTranslator.ToWin32 into a DLL and loading it with System.Reflection.Assembly\nLoad .\n\n```\nFigure 1: Decode Resource with `ColorTranslator.ToWin32 and Load Assembly in Array`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Decoded DLL Loaded with `System.Reflection.Assembly Load`\n[The decoded DLL is packed with something Hatching calls the “CustAttr .NET packer.” The](https://hatching.io/)\nDLL has a number of different decoding routines, which ultimately decode another another\nDLL (hreWg xR太太D.dll), which is then loaded.\n\nFigure 3: One of Several Decoding Routines in the CustAttr .NET Packed DLL\nhreWg xR太太D.dll, similar to the previous DLL, performs a number of decoding routines to\ndecode the packed code inside of it. This time, rather than using\n```\nSystem.Reflection.Assembly Load to load the next unpacked executable, it opts for a\n\n```\n[process injection technique called Process Hollowing. It uses the following API calls to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/)\ninject/execute the final payload:\n\nCreateProcess\nUnmapViewOfSection\nVirtualAlloc\nReadProcessMemory\nWriteProcessMemory\nVirtualProtect\nGetThreadContext\nSetThreadContext\nResumeThread\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Process Hollowing API Calls from hreWg xR太太D.dll\nDue to an error in dnSpy which caused variables not to show, the injected executable was\n[dumped via PE-sieve.](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve)\n\nFigure 5: dnSpy Error\n\nFigure 6: PE-sieve Dumping Injected Exe\nThe dumped executable is named 0DFFENDR.exe. When opened in dnSpy, it is obvious\n[that this executable is heavily obfuscated. de4dot identified the following obfuscators:](https://github.com/de4dot/de4dot)\n\nConfuserEx / Beds Protector\nBabel .NET\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7:\n\n\n-----\n\n0DFFENDR.exe Obfuscation dnSpy\nWith the 0DFFENDR.exe being heavily obfuscated, it can be easier to clean up the\n[obfuscation by first executing the original executable, then using Megadumper to dump out](https://github.com/CodeCracker-Tools/MegaDumper)\nthe process that was injected by hreWg xR太太D.dll. Once 0DFFENDR.exe is dumped,\n[de4dot will clean up the malware significantly, making the malware family apparent.](https://github.com/de4dot/de4dot)\n\nFigure 8: Snake Keylogger Identified\n[As reported by HP’s Threat Research Team, Snake sometimes copies itself to the start-up](https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/the-many-skins-of-snake-keylogger/)\nfolder as part of the unpacking process. The sample analyzed in this post did not do so, but\ndid make a registry entry to run on startup.\n\nFigure 9: Snake Keylogger AddToStartup Function\nSnake comes fully featured with a number of infostealing modules supporting a wide variety\nof applications (Browsers, Email Clients, Chat Applications, etc) including:\n\n360_China\n360_English\n7Star\nAmigo\nAvast\nBlackHawk\nBlisk\nBrave\nCent\nChedot\nChrome\nChrome_Canary\nChromium\nCitrio\nCocCoc\n\n\n-----\n\nComodo\nCoolNovo\nCoowon\nCyberfox\nDiscord\nElements\n\nEpic\nFalkon\nFileZilla\nFirefox\nFoxmail\nGhost\nIceCat\nIceDragon\nIPSurf\nIridium\nIron\nKinzaa\nKometa\nLiebao\nMicrosoft\nNichrome\nOpera\norbitum\nOutlook\nPaleMoon\nPidgin\n\nPostBox\nQQ\nSalamWeb\nSeaMonkey\nSleipnir\nSlim\nSlimjet\nSputnik\nSuperbird\nTheWiFi_Orginal\nThunderbird\nTorch\nUC\nUran\n\n\n-----\n\nVivaldi\nWaterFox\nWindowsProductKey_Orginal\nXpom\nxVast\nYandex\n\n## XLoader (Mac Variant)\n\nAccording to [Checkpoint Research, Formbook malware has been around for 5 years already.](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/top-prevalent-malware-with-a-thousand-campaigns-migrates-to-macos/)\nIn 2020, XLoader was developed as a successor of Formbook, sharing codebase and\ncapabilities but also supporting Mac. XLoader is an infostealer that harvests credentials from\nvarious web browsers and applications, collects screenshots, logs keystrokes and can\ndownload and execute files.\n```\nFilename: kIbwf02ld\nMD5: 997af06dda7a3c6d1be2f8cac866c78c \nSHA1: fb83d869f476e390277aab16b05aa7f3adc0e841 \nSHA256: 46adfe4740a126455c1a022e835de74f7e3cf59246ca66aa4e878bf52e11645d\n\n```\nThe XLoader Mach-O, similar to the Windows version, is stripped and obfuscates its data;\nrunning strings returns no results.\n\n## Static Analysis\n\n[Sentinel One has three blog posts detailing analysis tips and tricks for Mach-O binaries.](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/how-to-reverse-macos-malware-part-one/)\nThese static analysis methods were used to analyze XLoader and get a basic idea of the\nintents and capabilities of the malware.\n\nFirst, `nm -m was used to display Mach-O segment and section names in alphabetical order.`\nUnfortunately, this returns little information as the binary is stripped and functions are\nencrypted, then resolved with dlsym().\n\nFigure 10: nm -m output showing Mach-O segment and section names\nNext, `otool was used to extract both libs and methods from XLoader. This information can`\nbe extremely useful as it can identify great places to set breakpoints for debugging.\nUnfortunately, the XLoader binary once again provides little context.\n\nFigure 11: otool -L outputs only dylib\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: otool -oV Outputs Only the `Main Method\nThe final piece of static analysis is extracting stack strings. This can be done a variety of\n[ways, using tool such as Floss, manually extracting with otool, etc.](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/detecting-xloader-a-macos-malware-as-a-service-info-stealer-and-keylogger/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Example Stack String Within XLoader\n\nFigure 14: Extracting Stack Strings via otool\nFinally, using a tool that extracts hidden strings, even more information can be extracted,\nwhich provides more hints at the capabilities of the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: Strings Extracted\n\nUsing Hidden Strings Tool (Custom tool, Floss provides similar output)\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the output of our stack/hidden string extraction, it is clear that XLoader is focused\non stealing Chrome and Firefox passwords, contents from the clipboard, keystrokes\n(usernames and passwords from other applications), etc.\n\n## Dynamic Analysis\n\nExecuting the sample in a sandbox reveals the hidden app’s Info.plist as well as initial\nnetwork communications. Unfortunately the dynamic analysis was performed after\ninfrastructure was taken down, so there was not very much additional information uncovered.\n\nFigure 16: Hidden App’s Info.plist\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: XLoader Initial Network Traffic\n\n## Detection\n\nJAR Resource Unpacker/Decryptor (Auto Extract both the encrypted exe and Mach-O\nbinary)\n\n[Snake Keylogger Yara Rule](https://github.com/MuziSec/yara/blob/main/Snake_Keylogger.yar)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule Snake_Keylogger {\n  meta:\n    author = \"muzi\"\n    date = \"2021-08-20\"\n    description = \"Detects Snake Keylogger (unpacked)\"\n    hashes = \"96a6df07b7d331cd6fb9f97e7d3f2162e56f03b7f2b7cdad58193ac1d778e025\"\n  strings:\n    $s1 = \"TheSMTPEmail\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s2 = \"TheSMTPPSWD\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s3 = \"TheSMTPServer\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s4 = \"TheSMTPReciver\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s5 = \"TheFTPUsername\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s6 = \"TheFTPPSWD\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s7 = \"TheTelegramToken\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s8 = \"TheTelegramID\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s9 = \"loccle\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s10 = \"get_KPPlogS\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s11 = \"get_Scrlogtimerrr\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s12 = \"UploadsKeyboardHere\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s13 = \"get_ProHfutimer\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s14 = \"Chrome_Killer\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s15 = \"PWUploader\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s16 = \"TelSender\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s17 = \"RamSizePC\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s18 = \"ClipboardSender\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s19 = \"ScreenshotSender\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s20 = \"StartKeylogger\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s21 = \"TheStoragePWSenderTimer\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s22 = \"TheStoragePWSender\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s23 = \"TheHardDiskSpace2\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s24 = \"registryValueKind_0\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s25 = \"KeyLoggerEventArgsEventHandler\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s26 = \"decryptOutlookPassword\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s27 = \"TheWiFisOutput\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s28 = \"wifipassword_single\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s29 = \"WindowsProductKey_Orginal\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s30 = \"TheWiFi_Orginal\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s31 = \"OiCuntJollyGoodDayYeHavin\" ascii wide nocase\n    $s32 = \"de4fuckyou\" ascii wide nocase\n  condition:\n    uint16be(0) == 0x4D5A and\n    8 of ($s*)\n}\n\n```\n[CustAttr Packer Yara Rule](https://github.com/MuziSec/yara/blob/main/CustAttr_Packer.yar)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule CustAttr_Packer {\n  meta:\n    author = \"muzi\"\n    date = \"2021-08-20\"\n    description = \"Detects CustAttr/CutsAttr, a common .NET packer/crypter.\"\n  strings:\n    $s1 = \"mscoree.dll\" ascii wide nocase\n    $x1 = \"CutsAttr\" ascii wide nocase\n    $x2 = \"SelectorX\" ascii wide nocase\n    $x3 = \"CustAttr\" ascii wide nocase\n  condition:\n    uint16be(0) == 0x4D5A and\n    $s1 and\n    1 of ($x*)\n}\n\n```\n[XLoader MacOS Yara Rule](https://github.com/MuziSec/yara/blob/main/XLoader_MacOS.yar)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule XLoader_MacOS {\n  meta:\n    author = \"muzi\"\n    date = \"2021-08-20\"\n    description = \"Detects XLoader for macOS\"\n  strings:\n    /*\n    100001bf8 48 8b 93    MOV    RDX,qword ptr [RBX + 0x8b8 ]     \nlib\n         b8 08 00\n         00\n    100001bff 48 8d b3    LEA    RSI,[RBX + 0x9d0 ]          \ntarget\n         d0 09 00\n         00\n    100001c06 b9 02 00    MOV    ECX,0x2                \ncfg_buffer_id\n         00 00\n    100001c0b 41 b8 1a    MOV    R8D,0x1a                \nfunc_num\n         00 00 00\n    100001c11 48 89 df    MOV    RDI,RBX                \nxl\n    100001c14 e8 57 f3    CALL    ab_dlsym_get_func            \npthread_create\n         ff ff\n    100001c19 84 c0      TEST    AL,AL\n    100001c1b 0f 84 64    JZ     LAB_100001d85\n         01 00 00\n    100001c21 48 8b 93    MOV    RDX,qword ptr [RBX + 0x8b8 ]     \nlib\n         b8 08 00\n         00\n    100001c28 48 8d b3    LEA    RSI,[RBX + 0x918 ]          \ntarget\n         18 09 00\n         00\n    100001c2f b9 02 00    MOV    ECX,0x2                \ncfg_buf_id\n         00 00\n    100001c34 45 31 c0    XOR    R8D,R8D                \nfunc_num\n    100001c37 48 89 df    MOV    RDI,RBX                \nxl\n    100001c3a e8 31 f3    CALL    ab_dlsym_get_func            \nexit\n         ff ff\n    */\n    $dlsym_resolve_thread_create = {\n              (48|49|4c|4d) (8b|8d) ?? ?? ?? 00 00 [0-16]   // MOV\nRDX, qword ptr [RBX + 0xb8]\n              (48|49|4c|4d) 8d ?? ?? ?? 00 00 [0-16]     // LEA\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nRSI, [RBX + 0x9d0]\n              (B8|B9|BA|BB|BD|BE|BF) 02 00 00 00 [0-16]    // MOV\nECX, 0x2\n              (40|41|42|43|44|45|46|47) ?? 1a 00 00 00 [0-16] // MOV\nR8D, 0x1a\n              (48|49|4c|4d) 8? ??
