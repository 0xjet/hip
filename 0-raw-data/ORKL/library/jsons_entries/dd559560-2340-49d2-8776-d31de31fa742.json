A name once unique to a fictional character in a popular Japanese comic book and_\ncartoon series is now a name that appears in several rosters of the nastiest ransomware to\never grace the wild web.\n\n[For an incredibly young strain—only 15 months old—Ryuk ransomware gaining such](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ryuk-ransomware/)\nnotoriety is quite a feat to achieve. Unless the threat actors behind its campaigns call it quits,\n[too—Remember GandCrab?—or law enforcement collars them for good, we can only expect](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2019/07/threat-spotlight-sodinokibi-ransomware-attempts-to-fill-gandcrab-void/)\nthe threat of Ryuk to loom large over organizations.\n\nFirst discovered in mid-August 2018, Ryuk immediately turned heads after disrupting\noperations of all Tribune Publishing newspapers over the Christmas holiday that year. What\nwas initially thought of as a server outage soon became clear to those affected that it was\nactually a malware attack. It was quarantined eventually; however, Ryuk re-infected and\nspread onto connected systems in the network because the security patches failed to hold\nwhen tech teams brought the servers back.\n\n## Big game hunting with Ryuk ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore the holiday attack on Tribune Publishing, Ryuk had been seen targeting various\nenterprise organizations worldwide, asking ransom payments ranging from 15 to 50 Bitcoins\n(BTC). That translates to between US$97,000 and $320,000 at time of valuation.\n\nThis method of exclusively targeting large organizations with critical assets that almost\nalways guarantees a high ROI for criminals is called “big game hunting.” It’s not easy to pull\noff, as such targeted attacks also involve the customization of campaigns to best suit targets\nand, in turn, increase the likelihood of their effectiveness. This requires much more work than\na simple “spray-and-pray” approach that can capture numerous targets but may not net such\nlucrative results.\n\nFor threat actors engaged in big game hunting, malicious campaigns are launched in\nphases. For example, they may start with a phishing attack to gather key credentials or drop\nmalware within an organization’s network to do extensive mapping, identifying crucial assets\nto target. Then they might deploy second and third phases of attacks for extended\nespionage, extortion, and eventual ransom.\n\nTo date, Ryuk ransomware is hailed as the costliest among its peers. According to a report\nby Coveware, a first-of-its-kind incident response company specializing in ransomware,\n[Ryuk’s asking price is 10 times the average, yet they also claim that ransoms are highly](https://www.coveware.com/blog/2019/2/19/ryuk-ransomware-exploring-the-technical-and-human-connections)\nnegotiable. The varying ways adversaries work out ransom payments suggests that there\nmay be more than one criminal group who have access to and are operating Ryuk\nransomware.\n\n## The who behind Ryuk\n\nAccurately pinpointing the origin of an attack or malware strain is crucial, as it reveals as\nmuch about the threat actors behind attack campaigns as it does the payload itself. The\nname “Ryuk,” which has obvious Japanese ties, is not a factor to consider when trying to\ndiscover who developed this ransomware. After all, it’s common practice for cybercriminals to\nuse handles based on favorite anime and manga characters. These days, a malware strain\nis more than its name.\n\nInstead, similarities in code base, structure, attack vectors, and languages can point to\nrelations between criminal groups and their malware families. Security researchers from\n[Check Point found a connection between the Ryuk and Hermes ransomware strains early on](https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/ryuk-ransomware-targeted-campaign-break/)\ndue to similarities in their code and structure, an association that persists up to this day.\n[Because of this, many have assumed that Ryuk may also have ties with the Lazarus Group,](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/03/the-advanced-persistent-threat-files-lazarus-group/)\n[the same North Korean APT group that operated the Hermes ransomware in the past.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/glossary/advanced-persistent-threat-apt/)\n\n_Recommended read: Hermes ransomware distributed to South Koreans via recent Flash_\n_zero-day_\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, code likeness alone is insufficient basis to support the Ryuk/North Korean ties\nnarrative. Hermes is a ransomware kit that is frequently peddled on the underground market,\nmaking it available for other cybercriminals to use in their attack campaigns. Furthermore,\n[separate research from cybersecurity experts at CrowdStrike,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/) [FireEye,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/a-nasty-trick-from-credential-theft-malware-to-business-disruption.html) [Kryptos Logic, and](https://www.kryptoslogic.com/blog/2019/01/north-korean-apt-and-recent-ryuk-ransomware-attacks/)\n[McAfee has indicated that the gang behind Ryuk may actually be of Russian origin—and not](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/)\nnecessarily nation-state sponsored.\n\nAs of this writing, the origins of Ryuk ransomware can be attributed (with high confidence,\n[per some of our cybersecurity peers) to two criminal entities: Wizard Spider and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/) [CryptoTech.](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/)\n\n[The former is the well-known Russian cybercriminal group and operator of TrickBot; the latter](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/trojan-trickbot/)\n[is a Russian-speaking organization found selling Hermes 2.1 two months before the $58.5](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/taiwan-bank-heist-role-pseudo-ransomware/)\nmillion cyber heist that victimized the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB) in Taiwan.\n[According to reports, this version of Hermes was used as a decoy or “pseudo-ransomware,”](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/03/hermes-ransomware-distributed-to-south-koreans-via-recent-flash-zero-day/)\na mere distraction from the real goal of the attack.\n\n**Wizard Spider**\n\nRecent findings have revealed that Wizard Spider upgraded Ryuk to include a Wake-on-LAN\n(WoL) utility and an ARP ping scanner in its arsenal. WoL is a network standard that allows\ncomputing devices connected to a network—regardless of which operating system they run\n—to be turned on remotely whenever they’re turned off, in sleep mode, or hibernating.\n\n[ARP pinging, on the other hand, is a way of discovering endpoints in a LAN network that are](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/glossary/local-area-network/)\nonline. According to CrowdStrike, these new additions reveal Wizard Spider’s attempts to\nreach and infect as many of their target’s endpoints as they can, demonstrating a persistent\nfocus and motivation to increasingly monetize their victims’ encrypted data.\n\n**CryptoTech**\n\n[Two months ago, Gabriela Nicolao (@rove4ever) and Luciano Martins (@clucianomartins),](https://twitter.com/rove4ever)\nboth researchers at Deloitte Argentina, attributed Ryuk ransomware to CryptoTech, a littleknown cybercriminal group that was observed touting Hermes 2.1 in an underground forum\nback in August 2017. Hermes 2.1, the researchers say, is Ryuk ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe\n\nCryptoTech post about Hermes version 2.1 on the dark web in August 2017 (Courtesy of\nMcAfee)\n[In a Virus Bulletin conference paper and](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2019/10/vb2019-paper-shinigamis-revenge-long-tail-ryuk-malware/) [presentation entitled Shinigami’s revenge: the long](https://www.virusbulletin.com/conference/vb2019/abstracts/shinigamis-revenge-long-tail-ryuk-malware/)\n_tail of the Ryuk ransomware, Nicolao and Martins presented evidence to this claim: In June_\n2018, a couple of months before Ryuk made its first public appearance, an underground\nforum poster expressed doubt on CryptoTech being the author of Hermes 2.1, the\nransomware toolkit they were peddling almost a year ago that time. CryptoTech’s response\nwas interesting, which Nicolao and Martins captured and annotated in the screenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\nCryptoTech: Yes, we developed Hermes from scratch.\nThe Deloitte researchers also noted that after Ryuk emerged, CryptoTech went quiet.\n\nCrowdStrike has estimated that from the time Ryuk was deployed until January of this year,\ntheir operators have netted a total of 705.80 BTC, which is equivalent to US$5 million as of\npress time.\n\n## Ryuk ransomware infection vectors\n\nThere was a time when Ryuk ransomware arrived on clean systems to wreak havoc. But\n[new strains observed in the wild now belong to a multi-attack campaign that involves Emotet](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/trojan-emotet/)\n[and TrickBot. As such, Ryuk variants arrive on systems pre-infected with other malware—a](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/trojan-trickbot/)\n“triple threat” attack methodology.\n\nHow the\n\nEmotet, TrickBot, and Ryuk triple threat attack works (Courtesy of Cybereason)\nThe first stage of the attack starts with a weaponized Microsoft Office document file—\n[meaning, it contains malicious macro code—attached to a phishing email. Once the user](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2017/06/somethings-phishy-how-to-detect-phishing-attempts/)\nopens it, the malicious macro will run `cmd and execute a PowerShell command. This`\n[command attempts to download Emotet.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/botnets/2019/09/emotet-is-back-botnet-springs-back-to-life-with-new-spam-campaign/)\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce Emotet executes, it retrieves and executes another malicious payload—usually\n[TrickBot—and collects information on affected systems. It initiates the download and](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2018/11/trickbot-takes-top-business-threat/)\nexecution of TrickBot by reaching out to and downloading from a pre-configured remote\nmalicious host.\n\nOnce infected with TrickBot, the threat actors then check if the system is part of a sector they\nare targeting. If so, they download an additional payload and use the admin credentials\nstolen using TrickBot to perform lateral movement to reach the assets they wish to infect.\n\nThe threat actors then check for and establish a connection with the target’s live servers via\na [remote desktop protocol (RDP). From there, they drop Ryuk.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/glossary/remote-desktop-protocol-rdp/)\n\n## Symptoms of Ryuk infection\n\nSystems infected with the Ryuk ransomware displays the following symptoms:\n\n**Presence of ransomware notes. Ryuk drops the ransom note, RyukReadMe.html or**\n_RyukReadMe.txt, in every folder where it has encrypted files._\n\nThe HTML file, as you can see from the screenshot above, contains two private email\naddresses that affected parties can use to contact the threat actors, either to find out how\nmuch they need to pay to get access back to their encrypted files or to start the negotiation\nprocess.\n\nOn the other hand, the TXT ransom note contains (1) explicit instructions laid out for affected\nparties to read and comply, (2) two private email addresses affected parties can contact, and\n(3) a Bitcoin wallet address. Although email addresses may vary, it was noted that they are\nall accounts served at Protonmail or Tutanota. It was also [noted that a day after the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[unsealing of the indictment of two ransomware operators, Ryuk operators removed the](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-iranian-men-indicted-deploying-ransomware-extort-hospitals-municipalities-and-public)\nBitcoin address from their ransom notes, stating that it will be given to those affected once\nthey are contacted via email.\n\nThere are usually two versions of the text ransom note: a polite version, which past research\nclaims is comparable to BitPaymer’s due to certain similar phrasings; and a not-so-polite\nversion.\n\nRyuk\n\nransom notes. Left: polite version; Right: not-so-polite version\n\n\n-----\n\nBitPaymer ransom note: polite version (Courtesy of Coveware)\n\nBitPaymer ransom note: not-so-polite version (Courtesy of Symantec)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypted files with the RYK string attached to extension names. Ryuk uses a**\n[combination of symmetric (via the use of AES) and asymmetric (via the use of](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Advanced-Encryption-Standard) [RSA)](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/RSA)\nencryption to encode files. A private key, which only the threat actor can supply, is needed to\nproperly decrypt files.\n\nEncrypted files will have the .ryk file extension appended to the file names. For example, an\nencrypted sample.pdf and sample.mp4 files will have the sample.pdf.ryk and sample.mp4.ryk\nfile names, respectively.\n\nThis scheme is effective, assuming that each Ryuk strain was tailor-made for their target\norganization.\n\nWhile Ryuk encrypts files on affected systems, it avoids files with the extension .exe, .dll, and\n.hrmlog (a file type associated with Hermes). Ryuk also avoids encrypting files in the\nfollowing folders:\n\nAhnLab\nChrome\nMicrosoft\nMozilla\nRecycle.bin\nWindows\n\n## Protect your system from Ryuk\n\nMalwarebytes continues to track Ryuk ransomware campaigns, protecting our business\nusers with real-time anti-malware and anti-ransomware technology, as well as signature-less\ndetection, which stops the attack earlier on in the chain. In addition, we protect against triple\nthreat attacks aimed at delivering Ryuk as a final payload by blocking downloads of Emotet\nor TrickBot.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe recommend IT administrators take the following actions to secure and mitigate against\nRyuk ransomware attacks:\n\nEducate every employee in the organization, including executives, on how to correctly\n[handle suspicious emails.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2018/06/five-easy-ways-to-recognize-and-dispose-of-malicious-emails/)\nLimit the use of privilege accounts to only a select few in the organization.\n[Avoid using RDPs without properly terminating the session.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/business-security-world/2018/08/protect-rdp-access-ransomware-attacks/)\n[Implement the use of a password manager and single sign-on services for company-](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/awareness/2019/10/when-can-we-get-rid-of-passwords-for-good/)\nrelated accounts. Do away with other insecure password management practices.\nDeploy an authentication process that works for the company.\nDisable unnecessary share folders, so that in the event of a Ryuk ransomware attack,\nthe malware is prevented from moving laterally in the network.\nMake sure that all software installed on endpoints and servers is up to date and all\nvulnerabilities are patched. Pay particular attention to patching CVE-2017-0144, a\nremote code-execution vulnerability. This will prevent TrickBot and other malware\nexploiting this weakness from spreading.\nApply attachment filtering to email messages.\nDisable macros across the environment.\n\nFor a list of technologies and operations that have been found to be effective against Ryuk\n[ransomware attacks, you can go here.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/malware/2019/01/ryuk-ransomware-attacks-businesses-over-the-holidays/)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n-----\n\nTake note that professional cybercriminals sell Ryuk to other criminals on the black market\nas a toolkit for threat actors to build their own strain of the ransomware. As such, one\nshouldn’t be surprised by the number of Ryuk variants that are wreaking havoc in the wild.\nBelow is a list of file hashes that we have seen so far:\n\ncb0c1248d3899358a375888bb4e8f3fe\nd4a7c85f23438de8ebb5f8d6e04e55fc\n3895a370b0c69c7e23ebb5ca1598525d\n567407d941d99abeff20a1b836570d30\nc0d6a263181a04e9039df3372afb8016\n\nAs always—stay safe, everyone!\n\n\n-----",
