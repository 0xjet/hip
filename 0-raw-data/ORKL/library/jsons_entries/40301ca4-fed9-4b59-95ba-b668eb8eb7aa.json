The Helminth implant is routinely delivered through macro-enabled**\nMicrosoft Office documents requiring user interaction to execute an obfuscated Visual Basic\nScript.\n\nAdditionally, HELIX KITTEN actors have shown an affinity for creating thoroughly\n**researched and structured spear-phishing messages relevant to the interests of**\ntargeted personnel. In some instances, spear-phishing messages have been sent from\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised accounts of organizations related to the target to further enhance credibility.\nInformation technology (IT) and corporate infrastructure is a common theme of HELIX\nKITTEN spear-phishing messages.\n\nIn addition to Helminth, the ISMDoor implant is likely used by the Iran-based adversary to\nattack targets particularly those in the Middle East region. There are several infrastructure\noverlaps between ISMDoor and ISMAgent, a tool used exclusively by HELIX KITTEN. The\nimplementation of the DNS transport layer protocol is very similar in both ISMDoor and\nISMAgent. ISMDoor is able to exfiltrate data, take screenshots, and execute arbitrary\ncommands on the victim’s machine. Command and control (C2) is performed through a\ncovert channel based on DNS AAAA records. The actor uses dedicated domains to host\ntheir C2 infrastructure, as the C2 protocol requires full control over the authoritative DNS\nserver to work.\n\nDuring the summer of 2018, HELIX KITTEN actors were observed targeting entities in\n**the Middle East — of note, targets appeared to be located in Bahrain and Kuwait. These**\nincidents involved spear-phishing attacks, which characteristic of HELIX KITTEN, included\nemails containing malicious PowerShell in their macros that connects to known C2\ninfrastructure.\n\nIn early November 2018, CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™ observed activity from the\nHELIX KITTEN adversary at a customer in the telecommunications vertical. While the\nadversary leveraged known tooling as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),\nthis activity represented a shift in targeting that could allow HELIX KITTEN to support\nmultiple objectives.\n\nHELIX KITTEN’s operations against organizations in the telecommunications industry could\nallow this adversary to conduct bulk data collection of large amounts of communications\ndata that could be later leveraged in additional intelligence activities. Targeting\ntelecommunications can also allow the adversary to be able to reroute communications to\nadversary-controlled infrastructure for data collection or malware delivery. The ultimate\nobjective of this activity remains unclear at the time of this writing, but the addition of the\ntelecommunications sector to HELIX KITTEN’s target scope is a notable development.\n\nOilRig, Helminth, Clayslide, APT34, IRN2 are community or industry names associated with\nthis actor.\n\n## Other Iranian-based Adversaries\n\n[Clever Kitten](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/whois-clever-kitten/)\n\n**_Curious about other nation-state adversaries?_** _[Visit our threat actor center to learn about](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/)_\n_the new adversaries that the CrowdStrike team discovers._\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n\n-----\n\n_To learn more about how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors like HELIX_\n_KITTEN into your security strategy, please visit the_ _Falcon threat intelligence product_\n_page._\n_[Download the 2020 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2020-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/)_\n\nRelated Content\n\nWho is EMBER BEAR?\n\n\n-----\n\nA Tale of Two Cookies: How to Pwn2Own the Cisco RV340 Router\n\n\n-----\n\nPROPHET SPIDER Exploits Citrix ShareFile Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE 2021 22941 to\nDeliver Webshell\n\n\n-----",
