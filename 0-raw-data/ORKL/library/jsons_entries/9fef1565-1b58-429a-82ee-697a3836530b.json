Affiliates to the Lockbit RaaS can obtain LockBit Green\nusing the builder feature on the LockBit portal.\n\nThe release of the new version was confirmed by the vx-underground researchers:\n\n\n-----\n\nLockbit ransomware group has informed us they have acquired a 3rd ransomware\nvariant.\n\n– Lockbit Red\n\n– Lockbit Black\n\n– Lockbit Green\n\nThey also have modified their ESXI ransomware variant.\n\n[Yes, they actually wrote \"TLP:RED\" in the image. pic.twitter.com/Oacbl2ZJk7](https://t.co/Oacbl2ZJk7)\n\n[— vx-underground (@vxunderground) January 27, 2023](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1618885718839001091?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAccording to the researchers who analyzed the new version, the operators have modified\ntheir ESXI ransomware variant.\n\nAntonio Cocomazzi, a senior threat intelligence researcher from SentinelOne, reported that\n[the new variant has a significant overlap with the Conti ransomware, whose source code was](https://securityaffairs.com/129296/cyber-crime/hacker-leaked-conti-ransomware-source-code.html)\nleaked months ago.\n\n_“I conducted an analysis of the sample and found that it has significant overlap (89%_\n_[similarity) with the #Conti Ransomware, specifically its v3 version, which the source code](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=conti&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7026291707570700289)_\n_has been leaked several months ago. The commandline flags for LockBit Green are identical_\n_to those of Conti v3, making it a derivative of the original source code.” explained_\n**_Cocomazzi._**\n\nThe experts pointed out that only a small part of the source code has been modified by\nLockBit, including the ransom note which is identical to the one used by the LockBit Black\nvariant.\n\nThe ransom note filename has been changed to “!!!-Restore-My-Files-!!!.txt”.\n\nThe availability of the source code of other malware allows operators to create their own\nversion, improving it, and speeding up the development lifecycle.\n\n_“The approach of reusing and adapting the source code of reputable competitors, such as_\n_the now-defunct Conti, helps to lower the cost and time of development allowing_\n_the_ _[#RaaS maintainers to maximize their speed of release to attract new affiliates.”](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=raas&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7026291707570700289)_\n_concludes Cocomazzi._\n\nProdaft researchers shared Indicators of Compromise for the Lockbit Green variant along\nwith the Yara rule for its pattern detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n⚠️On January 27, 2023, the LockBit ransomware team made a so-called LockBit\nGreen\" version of their ransomware available.
