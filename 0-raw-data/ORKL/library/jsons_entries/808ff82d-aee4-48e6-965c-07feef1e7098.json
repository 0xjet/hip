    "plain_text": "# Joint Advisory on ALTDOS \n\nThis joint advisory is the result of a collaborative effort between the Cyber Security Agency of\nSingapore (CSA), the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) and the Singapore Police\nForce (SPF). Collectively, we have received several reports of cyber incidents involving\norganisations operating in Singapore that were reportedly targeted by the threat actor\nALTDOS.\n\nThis joint advisory highlights the observed Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)\nemployed by ALTDOS to compromise their victims’ networks and provides some\nrecommended measures for organisations to mitigate the threat posed.\n\n**Background of ALTDOS**\n\nALTDOS first emerged in late 2020 when they claimed their first victim, a securities trading\nfirm based in Thailand. Thus far, ALTDOS has claimed multiple victims in Bangladesh and\nSingapore, in addition to Thailand. The threat actor appears to operate primarily in Southeast\nAsia and Bangladesh, targeting businesses for financial gains.\n\n**Observed TTPs employed by ALTDOS**\n\n|Domain|ID|Name|Use|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Enterprise|T1595.002|Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning|ALTDOS performs active scanning to identify vulnerable public facing services and web applications|\n|Enterprise|T1588.002|Obtain Capabilities: Tool|ALTDOS leverages third-party penetration testing tools such as Cobalt Strike|\n|Enterprise|T1190|Exploit Public-Facing Application|ALTDOS exploits outdated versions of public-facing web services to gain initial access|\n|Enterprise|T1059|Command and Scripting Interpreter|ALTDOS uses interpreters to execute arbitrary code and establish backdoor access|\n|Enterprise|T1505.003|Server Software Component: Web Shell|ALTDOS deploys web shells in compromised server to execute code and establish persistence|\n|Enterprise|T1068|Exploitation for Privilege Escalation|ALTDOS exploits vulnerabilities in the software for privilege escalation|\n|Enterprise|T1055.003|Process Injection: Thread Execution Hijacking|ALTDOS hijacks legitimate processes to hide the malware|\n|Enterprise|T1095|Non-Application Layer Protocol|ALTDOS establishes communications between C2 and installed malware (usually Cobalt Strike Beacon)|\n|Enterprise|T1486|Data Encrypted for Impact|ALTDOS encrypts compromised system to extract ransom|\n\n\n-----\n\nEnterprise T1561.001 Disk Wipe: Disk ALTDOS wipes the contents of the\n\nContent Wipe compromised system\n\n_Observed TTPs (and associated IDs) employed by ALTDOS mapped to MITRE ATT&CK_\n\nALTDOS typically uses double extortion techniques to extract ransom from their victims. In\ndouble extortion, data is exfiltrated from the victim’s servers, after which the data may be\nencrypted. ALTDOS will subsequently contact the victim using an email address hosted on\nprotonmail demanding that payment be made or the exfiltrated data will be published (leakand-shame). It is currently unknown which ransomware variant is employed by ALTDOS.\nVictims have also been asked to pay a separate ransom if they wish to decrypt any encrypted\nfiles. Similar to other financially motivated threat actors, the ransom is typically paid in Bitcoin.\nIf the victim does not respond or comply to the ransom demand within the given time frame,\nALTDOS may also launch a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack on the victim’s Internet facing\nsystems to disrupt operational services and to remind them to pay the ransom.\n\n**Detection of TTPs**\n\n1. Web Server Exploitation\n\nALTDOS has been observed to exploit vulnerable instances of Apache Web Servers and\nemploy SQL injection against vulnerable targets to obtain initial access. Besides monitoring\nthe logs provided by Web Application Firewalls, incident responders can also examine host\nprocess logs for anomalies between parent web server processes and child processes.\n\nParent processes that should be monitored include those belonging to web servers such as\n_httpd.exe and_ _php-cgi.exe. Suspicious child processes include those that can be used as_\ncommand and scripting interpreters such as powershell.exe, cmd.exe or wscript.exe. When\nintruding into a victim’s network, ALTDOS has been observed to exploit the web server where\n_httpd.exe spawns cmd.exe, enabling arbitrary code execution._\n\n2. Cobalt Strike Beacons\n\nALTDOS has been observed to primarily employ default Cobalt Strike Beacons that can be\nreadily identified using open source YARA rules. Please see appended links for the YARA rules:\n\n|Enterprise|T1561.001|Disk Wipe: Disk Content Wipe|ALTDOS wipes the contents of the compromised system|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n_https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/master/yara/apt_cobaltstrike.yar_\n\n_https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/master/yara/apt_cobaltstrike_evasive.yar_\n\n\nALTDOS has also been observed to use default Cobalt Strike TLS/SSL certificates. Incident\nresponders investigating suspicious destination IP/Domains can check the certificate for\nsuspicious fields such as those appended:\n\n_Common Name_ _Major Cobalt Strike (subject)_\n_Major Cobalt Strike (issuer)_\n\n_Organisation Name_ _Cobaltstrike (subject)_\n_Cobaltstrike (subject)_\n\n_Organisation Unit_ _AdvancedPenTesting (subject)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_AdvancedPenTesting (issuer)_\n\n_Locality_ _Somewhere (subject)_\n_Somewhere (issuer)_\n\n_State/Province_ _Cyberspace (subject)_\n_Cyberspace (issuer)_\n\n_Country_ _Earth (subject)_\n_Earth (issuer)_\n\n**Recommended Mitigations**\n\n1. Regular Patching\n\nALTDOS typically exploits vulnerable instances of web servers to gain initial access to an\norganisation’s network. As such, we strongly recommend that organisations regularly update\ntheir softwares (e.g. web server application, database application, etc.) to patch known\nsecurity vulnerabilities. Source code reviews also help to detect web application\nvulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities include those in the Open Web Application Security Project\n(OWASP) “Top Ten” list.\n\n2. Regular Log Reviews\n\nALTDOS has been observed to carry out active scanning to discover vulnerable instances of\nweb servers. As such, system administrators should enable logging (e.g. server access logs)\nand review such logs regularly to spot any malicious activities (e.g. SQLi attempts). If malicious\nactivities are detected, the originating IP address(es) should be filtered with applicable\ntechnologies such as a web application firewall. Affected organisations should also scan their\ninternal corporate networks for any malicious activities.\n\n3. Network Segregation or Segmentation\n\nOrganisations using web servers are also encouraged to deploy network segregation or\nsegmentation techniques that limits communications between internet facing services and\ninternal servers such as those containing sensitive data. This will limit the impact of threat\nactors who may successfully gain initial access to vulnerable web applications and reduce the\nprobability of a data breach.\n\n4. Implement Routine Backups\n\nOrganisations should implement routine backups that creates and saves copies of important\nfiles to external and offline storage devices. This will allow for system restoration that\nmitigates the impact of a ransomware incident and minimises data loss. Backup media should\nbe regularly tested to ensure that the backup data can be recovered and restored in time to\nhelp the business recover from data corruption or destruction.\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Employ Web Application Firewalls\n\nOrganisations should also employ web application firewalls to filter malicious network traffic\n(e.g. SQLi) and “harden” their system configurations (e.g. for web server and firewalls) by\nmaking appropriate changes to settings and not rely on default settings.\n\n6. Seek External Assistance\n\nOrganisations may also wish to hire a professional firm to routinely perform web application\npenetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify vulnerabilities that may enable\nthreat actors to gain initial access to their network. Organisations should also seek\nprofessional assistance from cybersecurity service providers for incident response and\nremediation if a cybersecurity incident is confirmed.\n\n**Should you pay the ransom?**\n\nIn the event that your organisation’s systems are compromised, we do not recommend paying\nthe ransom and advise you to report the incident to the authorities. Paying the ransom does\nnot guarantee that the data will be decrypted or that your data will not be published by threat\nactors. It also encourages the threat actors to continue their criminal activities and target\nmore victims. Threat actors may also see your organisation as a soft target and may strike\nagain in the future.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\nSingCERT Ransomware Advisories:\n\n[https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/Advisories/ad-2021-006](https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/Advisories/ad-2021-006)\n[https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/Advisories/ad-2020-006](https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/Advisories/ad-2020-006)\n\nCSA Incident Response Checklist:\n\n[https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/Resources/Incident-Response-Checklist](https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/Resources/Incident-Response-Checklist)\n\nPDPC Guides to Protect Against Data Breaches:\n\n[https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Help-and-Resources/2021/05/Guard-Against-Common-Data-](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Help-and-Resources/2021/05/Guard-Against-Common-Data-Breaches)\n[Breaches](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Help-and-Resources/2021/05/Guard-Against-Common-Data-Breaches)\n[https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/guidetosecuringpersonaldatainelectronicmedium0903178d4749c8844062038829ff0000d98b0f.pdf?la=en)\n[Guides/guidetosecuringpersonaldatainelectronicmedium0903178d4749c8844062038829ff0](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/guidetosecuringpersonaldatainelectronicmedium0903178d4749c8844062038829ff0000d98b0f.pdf?la=en)\n[000d98b0f.pdf?la=en](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/guidetosecuringpersonaldatainelectronicmedium0903178d4749c8844062038829ff0000d98b0f.pdf?la=en)\n[https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/Guide-to-Data-](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/Guide-to-Data-Protection-by-Design-for-ICT-Systems-(310519).pdf?la=en)\n[Protection-by-Design-for-ICT-Systems-(310519).pdf?la=en](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/Guide-to-Data-Protection-by-Design-for-ICT-Systems-(310519).pdf?la=en)\n\nNo More Ransom Initiative:\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://www.nomoreransom.org/](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Framework:\n\n[https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)\n\nIssued by:\n\n\n-----",
