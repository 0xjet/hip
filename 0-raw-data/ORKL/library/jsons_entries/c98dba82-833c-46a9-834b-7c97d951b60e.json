Investigators have now**\n**taken control of its infrastructure in an international coordinated action.**\n\nThis operation is the result of a collaborative effort between authorities in the Netherlands,\nGermany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine,\nwith international activity coordinated by Europol and Eurojust. This operation was carried\n\n\n-----\n\nout in the framework of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats\n(EMPACT).\n\n[EMOTET has been one of the professional and long lasting cybercrime services out there.](https://www.eurojust.europa.eu/crime-types-and-cases/crime-types/cybercrime)\nFirst discovered as a banking Trojan in 2014, the malware evolved into the go-to solution for\ncybercriminals over the years. The EMOTET infrastructure essentially acted as a primary\ndoor opener for computer systems on a global scale. Once this unauthorised access was\nestablished, these were sold to other top level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities\nsuch as data theft and extortion through ransomware.\n\n**Spread via Word documents**\n\nThe EMOTET group managed to take email as an attack vector to a next level. Through a\nfully automated process, EMOTET malware was delivered to the victims’ computers via\ninfected e-mail attachments. A variety of different lures were used to trick unsuspecting users\ninto opening these malicious attachments. In the past, EMOTET email campaigns have also\nbeen presented as invoices, shipping notices and information about COVID-19.\n\nAll these emails contained malicious Word documents, either attached to the email itself or\ndownloadable by clicking on a link within the email. Once a user opened one of these\ndocuments, they could be prompted to “enable macros” so that the malicious code hidden in\nthe Word file could run and install EMOTET malware on a victim’s computer.\n\n**Attacks for hire**\n\n\n-----\n\nEMOTET was much more than just a malware. What made EMOTET so dangerous is that\nthe malware was offered for hire to other cybercriminals to install other types of malware,\nsuch as banking Trojans or ransomwares, onto a victim’s computer.\n\nThis type of attack is called a ‘loader’ operation, and EMOTET is said to be one of the\nbiggest players in the cybercrime world as other malware operators like TrickBot and Ryuk\nhave benefited from it.\n\nIts unique way of infecting networks by spreading the threat laterally after gaining access to\njust a few devices in the network made it one of the most resilient malware in the wild.\n\n**Disruption of EMOTET’s infrastructure**\n\nThe infrastructure that was used by EMOTET involved several hundreds of servers located\nacross the world, all of these having different functionalities in order to manage the\ncomputers of the infected victims, to spread to new ones, to serve other criminal groups, and\nto ultimately make the network more resilient against takedown attempts.\n\nTo severely disrupt the EMOTET infrastructure, law enforcement teamed up together to\ncreate an effective operational strategy. It resulted in this week’s action where by law\nenforcement and judicial authorities gained control of the infrastructure and took it down from\nthe inside. The infected machines of victims have been redirected towards this law\nenforcement-controlled infrastructure. This is a unique and new approach to effectively\ndisrupt the activities of the facilitators of cybercrime.\n\n**How to protect oneself against loaders**\n\nMany botnets like EMOTET are polymorphic in nature. This means that the malware\nchanges its code each time it is called up. Since many antivirus programmes scan the\ncomputer for known malware codes, a code change may cause difficulties for its detection,\nallowing the infection to go initially undetected.\n\nA combination of both updated cybersecurity tools (antivirus and operating systems) and\ncybersecurity awareness is essential to avoid falling victim to sophisticated botnets like\nEMOTET. Users should carefully check their email and avoid opening messages and\nespecially attachments from unknown senders. If a message seems too good to be true, it\nlikely is and emails that implore a sense of urgency should be avoided at all costs.\n\nAs part of the criminal investigation conducted by the Dutch National Police into EMOTET, a\ndatabase containing e-mail addresses, usernames and passwords stolen by EMOTET was\ndiscovered. You can check if your e-mail address has been compromised at\n[www.politie.nl/emocheck [unfortunately this link no longer points to an existing page at the](http://www.politie.nl/emocheck)\nexternal website]. As part of the global remediation strategy, in order to initiate the\nnotification of those affected and the cleaning up of the systems, information was distributed\nworldwide via the network of so-called Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).\n\n\n-----\n\n**The following authorities took part in this operation:**\n\nNetherlands: National Police (Politie), National Public Prosecution Office (Landelijk\n_Parket)_\nGermany: Federal Criminal Police (Bundeskriminalamt), General Public Prosecutor's\nOffice Frankfurt/Main (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft)\nFrance: National Police (Police Nationale), Judicial Court of Paris (Tribunal Judiciaire\n_de Paris)_\nLithuania: Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau (Lietuvos kriminalinės policijos biuras),\nProsecutor’s General’s Office of Lithuania\nCanada: Royal Canadian Mounted Police\nUnited States: Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice, US\nAttorney's Office for the Middle District of North Carolina\nUnited Kingdom: National Crime Agency, Crown Prosecution Service\nUkraine: National Police of Ukraine (Національна поліція України), Prosecutor\nGeneral’s Office (Офіс Генерального прокурора)\n\n© EUROJUST 2022\n\n\n-----",
