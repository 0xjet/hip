However, the process of mining compromised data for correct username and\npassword combinations requires significant computer processing power and proxy pool lists\n[to be successful — a capability that is now exhibited by the Trickbot gang.](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/?p=3013)\n\n\n-----\n\nConsidered to be the successor of the formidable Dyre banking Trojan gang, the Trickbot\nbanking Trojan gang continues to evolve by adopting new attack methods and targeting\nvarious industries. While Trickbot predominantly targeted the financial industry, it has now\nexpanded its targeting of other industries via its account checking activities; these are\nperpetrated through the backconnect SOCKS5 module enlisting victims as proxies. Enlisting\nvictims as its proxies allows the gang to perform account checking activity with the same IP\nas its victims. The gang account checking operation requires a steady stream of new and\n“clean” proxies to make sure their activities wouldn’t get automatically blocked by companies’\nautomatic IP origin anti-fraud systems. Therefore, their existing infections are turned into\naccount checking proxies.\n\n**_Image 1: The process of Trickbot’s backconnect proxy account checking activity. In the first_**\n_step, the Trickbot gang distributes email spam. In the second step, the victim opens the_\n_spam attachment. In the third step, Trickbot downloads and executes the payload from the_\n_payload server on the compromised machine. In the fourth step, the victim machine_\n_downloads the backconnect SOCKS5 proxy module from the module server. Then, the victim_\n_connects to the preconfigured gang’s backconnect server. Finally, the Trickbot gang connects_\n_to the victim enlisting their machine’s IP as its proxy for account checking activities via its_\n_backconnect SOCKS5 module._\nThe Trickbot gang continues to search for ways to monetize infections by adopting a hybrid\nattack model, which utilizes both Trickbot modular payloads and knowledgeable fraud\noperators. The Trickbot gang has also extended its operations to include account checking\nactivity; such attacks are a combination of malware expertise and knowledgeable human\noperators. This hybrid approach allows Trickbot operators to launch account checking\nattacks leveraging infected victims as proxies.\n\nDistributed through malicious Microsoft Office documents via email spam campaigns,\nTrickbot is notable for loading its backconnect SOCKS5 module bcClientDllTest onto\ncompromised machines. This module is used extensively by the gang for account checking\nactivity.\n\nFrom Aug. 17 to the present, analysts observed close to 6,000 unique compromised\nmachines associated with Trickbot SOCKS5 proxy module activities. Of these machines,\nmore than 200 of them were actively enlisted for account checking fraud activities at any one\ntime.\n\n**_Image 2: The Trickbot SOCKS5 backconnect module contains authorization backconnect_**\n_logic to check in to the backend._\nTrickbot utilizes a backconnect communication protocol maintaining the following commands,\nwhich are used for client-server communications initially with the command prefix “c”:\n\n- disconnect: Terminate the backconnect server connection\n\n- idle: Maintain the client-server connection\n\n- connect: connect to the backconnect server. The command must consist of the following\n\n\n-----\n\nparameters:\n\n- ip: Backconnect server’s IP address\n\n- auth_swith: Use authorization flag. If the value is set to “1”, the Trojan receives the\nauth_login and auth_pass parameters. If the value is “0”, the Trojan gets the auth_ip\nparameter. Otherwise, the connection will not be established.\n\n- auth_ip: Authentication IP address\n\n- auth_login: Authentication login\n\n- auth_pass: Authentication password\n\n**_Image 3: A Trickbot victim connects to the Trickbot backconnect server._**\nThere are three main Trickbot SOCKS5 server-client commands:\n\n- c=idle\n\n- c=disconnect\n\n- c=connect\n\nTrickbot victims create a sequence of GET requests to the server on gate[.]php:\n\n- client_id=&connected=&server_port=&debug=\n\nThe server responds with a POST request with the following parameters if the connection\nneeds to be established:\n\n- c=connect&ip=&auth_swith=&auth_ip=&auth_login=&auth_pass=\n\nIf the connection needs to be terminated, the server will respond with c=disconnect.\n\n**_Image 4: The Trickbot machine actively pings the server every 100 seconds._**\nMost notably, once compromised, Trickbot targets customers of financial institutions via\nwebinjects and redirection attacks. The Trojan also uses victim IPs as proxies to leverage\nusername and password combinations for account checking activity. The observed account\nchecking activity mainly targets customers of companies in nine industries, most of those in\ngaming. Notably, some of the targets appear to be Russia-based companies.\n\n**_Image 5: Trickbot account checking activities mainly target customers in nine industries._**\nTrickbot account checking activity is mainly directed to customers of U.S.- and Russia-based\ncompanies operating in the following industries:\n\n- Gaming\n\n- Technology\n\n- Financial\n\n- Entertainment\n\n- Adult\n\n- Social Media\n\n\n-----\n\n- Retail\n\n- Rewards\n\n- Cryptocurrency\n\nLikely leveraging commercial account checker tools, the Trickbot gang and its associates\nheavily utilize its victims’ IPs as proxies for account checking activity that imitates mobile\ndevice-based account logins. Their attacks leave various web applications artifacts such as\nspoofed user agent information and device information, indicating as if the activity was being\nperformed leveraging mobile devices. Such mobile logins are meant to bypass traditional\nanti-fraud controls that are largely implemented to address web-based logins. In\ncybercriminals’ pursuit of targets, their attempts at evading anti-fraud systems are thus\ndictated by a company’s anti-fraud controls, which are in turn influenced by cybercriminal\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Analysts assess with moderate confidence the\nTrickbot operators will likely continue to monetize infections by turning victims’ IPs into\nproxies that subsequently fuel account checking activities.Block has been deleted or is\nunavailable.\n\n\n-----",
