    "plain_text": "# New Findings From Our Investigation of SUNBURST\n\n**[orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/11/new-findings-from-our-investigation-of-sunburst/](https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/11/new-findings-from-our-investigation-of-sunburst/)**\n\nJanuary 11, 2021\n\nSince the cyberattack on our customers and SolarWinds, we have been working around the\n[clock to support our customers. As we shared in our recent update, we are partnering with](https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/07/our-plan-for-a-safer-solarwinds-and-customer-community/)\nmultiple industry-leading cybersecurity experts to strengthen our systems, further enhance\nour product development processes, and adapt the ways that we deliver powerful,\naffordable, and secure solutions to our customers. We are working with our counsel, DLA\nPiper, CrowdStrike, KPMG, and other industry experts to perform our root cause analysis of\nthe attack. As part of that analysis, we are examining how the SUNBURST malicious code\nwas inserted into our Orion Platform software and once inserted, how the code operated and\nremained undetected. Today we are providing an update on the investigation thus far and an\nimportant development we believe brings us closer to understanding how this serious attack\nwas carried out. We believe we have found a highly sophisticated and novel malicious code\ninjection source the perpetrators used to insert the SUNBURST malicious code into builds of\nour Orion Platform software. We recognize the software development and build process used\nby SolarWinds is common throughout the software industry, so we believe that sharing this\ninformation openly will help the industry guard against similar attacks in the future and create\nsafer environments for customers. The security of our customers and our commitment to\ntransparency continue to guide our work in these areas and going forward. Highly\n**sophisticated and complex malware designed to circumvent threat detection As we**\nand industry experts have noted previously, the SUNBURST attack appears to be one of the\nmost complex and sophisticated cyberattacks in history. The U.S. government and many\n\n\n-----\n\nprivate-sector experts have stated the belief that a foreign nation-state conducted this\nintrusive operation as part of a widespread attack against America’s cyberinfrastructure. To\ndate, our investigations have not independently verified the identity of the perpetrators.\nAnalysis suggests that by managing the intrusion through multiple servers based in the\nUnited States and mimicking legitimate network traffic, the attackers were able to circumvent\nthreat detection techniques employed by both SolarWinds, other private companies, and the\nfederal government. The SUNBURST malicious code itself appears to have been designed\nto provide the perpetrators a way to enter a customer’s IT environment. If exploited, the\nperpetrators then had to avoid firewalls and other security controls within the customer’s\nenvironment. KPMG and CrowdStrike, working together with the SolarWinds team, have\nbeen able to locate the malicious code injection source. We have reverse-engineered the\ncode responsible for the attack, enabling us to learn more about the tool that was developed\nand deployed into the build environment. This highly sophisticated and novel code was\ndesigned to inject the SUNBURST malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion Platform\nwithout arousing the suspicion of our software development and build teams. We encourage\neveryone to visit this [blog post, authored by the CrowdStrike team, which provides additional](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/)\ndetails into these findings and other technical aspects of this attack, and contains valuable\ninformation intended to help the industry better understand attacks of this nature. As we\n[discussed in our previous post, we hope that this event ushers in a new level of collaboration](https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2020/12/29/our-commitment-to-cooperation/)\nand information sharing within the technology industry to address and prevent similar attacks\nin the future. Our concern is that right now similar processes may exist in software\ndevelopment environments at other companies throughout the world. The severity and\ncomplexity of this attack has taught us that more effectively combatting similar attacks in the\nfuture will require an industry-wide approach as well as public-private partnerships that\nleverage the skills, insight, knowledge, and resources of all constituents. We want to be a\npart of that solution, which is why we are sharing this information with the broader\ncommunity, and we will continue to share progress as we assimilate this information into our\ngo-forward practices. Our investigations to date We are actively working with law\nenforcement, the intelligence community, governments, and industry colleagues in our and\n[their investigations. As we recently disclosed, we even shared all of our proprietary code](https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2020/12/17/solarwinds-update-on-security-vulnerability/)\nlibraries that we believed to have been affected by SUNBURST to give security professionals\nthe information they needed in their research.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur current timeline for this incident begins in September 2019, which is the earliest\nsuspicious activity on our internal systems identified by our forensic teams in the\ncourse of their current investigations.\nThe subsequent October 2019 version of the Orion Platform release appears to have\ncontained modifications designed to test the perpetrators’ ability to insert code into our\nbuilds\nAn updated version of the malicious code injection source that inserted the\nSUNBURST malicious code into Orion Platform releases starting on February 20,\n2020.\nThe perpetrators remained undetected and removed the SUNBURST malicious code\nfrom our environment in June 2020. During that time, through to today, SolarWinds\ninvestigated various vulnerabilities in its Orion Platform. It remediated or initiated the\nprocess of remediating vulnerabilities, a regular process that continues today. However,\nuntil December 2020, the company did not identify any vulnerabilities as what we now\nknow as SUNBURST.\nOn December 12, 2020, we were informed of the cyberattack and moved swiftly to\nnotify and protect our customers and to investigate the attack in collaboration law\nenforcement, intelligence and governments.\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to protect our customers and investigate the SUNBURST\nattack, we are reviewing historical and current customer inquiries that might contribute to a\nbetter understanding of the attack. To date, we have identified two previous customer\nsupport incidents during the timeline referenced above that, with the benefit of hindsight, we\nbelieve may be related to SUNBURST. We investigated the first in conjunction with our\ncustomer and two third-party security companies. At that time, we did not determine the root\n\n\n-----\n\ncause of the suspicious activity or identify the presence of the SUNBURST malicious code\nwithin our Orion Platform software. The second incident occurred in November, and similarly,\nwe did not identify the presence of the SUNBURST malicious code. We are still investigating\nthese incidents and are sharing information related to them with law enforcement to support\ninvestigation efforts. We will continue our investigations to help ensure our products and\ninternal systems are secure and to provide information that we hope leads to the\nidentification of the perpetrators and the prevention of these types of attacks in the future.\nWe also plan to continue to share our broader findings with the industry at large in the hope\nthat everyone is better able protect themselves and deliver more secure solutions to their\ncustomers. ********************************************************************************* This Blog\n_Post contains \"forward-looking\" statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions_\n_of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding_\n_SolarWinds’ investigation into the recent SUNBURST attack, the high-level timeline provided_\n_above and the company’s findings to date, SolarWinds’ understanding of the nature, source_\n_and duration of the attack and SolarWinds’ plans to further investigate the attack, ensure our_\n_products and internal systems are secure and provide information regarding its findings.
