It describes our\nexperience in applying the latest standard for functional safety “BS IEC 61511:\n2003 Functional Safety – Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) for the Process Industry\nSector”[1]. The main lessons learned are illustrated by real examples, changed to\npreserve confidentiality but still illustrating relevant issues.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n“Functional” and “safety” are words that have been used for centuries and, although using\n“functional safety” to describe the action of a protection system is a relatively recent\ninnovation, the meaning is clear enough. Other terms used are less obvious and are\ndefined in the standard and repeated below for those not familiar with them. This paper\ndiscusses the application of three popular methods of determining Safety Integrity\nLevel (SIL) requirements — Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA), risk graph methods\nand Layer Of Protection Analysis (LOPA) — to process industry installations. It identifies\nsome of the advantages and limitations of each method and suggests criteria for identifying\nwhich of these methods is appropriate in specific situations.\n\nDEFINITIONS\nIEC 61511 covers the whole lifecycle as shown in Figure 1, but this paper is concerned\nonly with phases 1 through 3, leading to the “Safety Requirements Specification for the\nSafety Instrumented System”.\n\nLAYERS OF PROTECTION\nThe introduction of the layers of protection concept shown in Figure 2 originates from the\nAmerican approach to Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) in ANSI ISA-SP 84.01–1996[3].\nThis American standard has been the major influence in the differences between IEC\n61508[4] and IEC 61511 and the importance of independence between layers and the implications of common cause issues between layers is emphasised. The allocation of safety\nfunctions to specific layers or systems (for example a hazard may be protected by a\ncombination of relief valves, physical barriers and bunds and a SIS); and the contribution\nrequired of each element to the overall risk reduction should be specified as part of the\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Lifecycle from IEC 61511\n\ntransfer of information from the risk analysis to those responsible for the design\nand engineering.\n\nBPCS\nThe Basic Process Control System (BPCS) is a key layer of protection “which responds to\ninput signals from the process, its associated equipment, other programmable systems\nand/or operator and generates output signals causing the process and its associated equipment to operate in the desired manner but which does not perform any safety instrumented\nfunctions with a claimed SIL �1”. Note that in IEC 61508 the BPCS is part of the\ndefinition of Equipment Under Control (EUC).\n\nSIF\nA Safety Instrumented Function (SIF) is a safety function with a specified SIL which is\nnecessary to achieve functional safety. IEC 61511 also includes a note to explain that\nthis normally refers to protection systems and that if it is applied to control systems\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Typical risk reduction methods found in process plants from IEC 61511-1 Figure 9\n\nthen “further detailed analysis may be required to demonstrate that the system is capable of\nachieving the safety requirements”.\n\nSIS\nA Safety Instrumented System (SIS) is used to implement one or more SIFs. A SIS is composed of any combination of sensor(s), logic solver(s), and final element(s).\n\nSIL\nThe two standards (IEC 61508 and IEC 61511) define Safety Integrity as “probability” of\nsuccess and then define the Safety Integrity Level (SIL) as four discrete levels (1 to 4)\n\n\n-----\n\nsuch that “level 4 has the highest safety integrity”. Although the standards concentrate on\n“Safety” and “SIL”, the principles that they address can also be applied to protection\nagainst environmental and financial risks; “EIL” and “FIL” can be applied analogously\nwith “SIL”, and Integrity Level (IL) used as a term applying to all three protection\nfunctions.\nThe definition of SIL is clear for those SIFs that are only called upon at a low\nfrequency/have a low demand rate. Elsewhere the same two standards recognise that\nsafety functions can be required to operate in quite different ways (for example, continuously) and SIL is defined as a failure rate (in units of failures/hour). These two different\nuses of the same SIL terminology have caused considerable confusion. This section of this\npaper was first presented at the Safety-Critical Systems Symposium in February 2004\n(SSS04)[2] and attempts to clarify the definition of SIL. Consider a car; examples of low\ndemand functions are:\n\n. Anti-lock braking (ABS). (It depends on the driver, of course!).\n. Secondary restraint system (air bags).\n\nOn the other hand there are functions that are in frequent or continuous use;\nexamples of such functions are:\n\n. Normal braking\n. Steering\n\nThe fundamental question is how frequently will failures of either type of function\nlead to accidents. The answer is different for the 2 types:\n\n. For functions with a low demand rate, the accident rate is a combination of 2\nparameters — i) the frequency of demands, and ii) the Probability the function Fails\non Demand (PFD). In this case, therefore, the appropriate measure of performance\nof the function is PFD, or its reciprocal, Risk Reduction Factor (RRF).\n. For functions that have a high demand rate or operate continuously, the accident rate is\nthe failure rate, l, which is the appropriate measure of performance. An alternative\nmeasure is Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) of the function. Provided failures are exponentially distributed, MTTF is the reciprocal of l.\n\nThese performance measures are, of course, related. At its simplest, provided the\nfunction can be proof-tested at a frequency that is greater than the demand rate, the\nrelationship can be expressed as:\n\nPFD ¼ lT=2 or ¼ T=(2 � MTTF), or\nRRF ¼ 2=(lT) or ¼ (2 � MTTF)=T\n\nwhere T is the proof-test interval. (Note that to significantly reduce the accident rate below\nthe failure rate of the function, the test frequency, 1/T, should be at least 2 and preferably\n�5 times the demand frequency.) They are, however, different quantities. PFD is a\n\n\n-----\n\nprobability — dimensionless; l is a rate — dimension t[2][1]. The standards, however, use the\nsame term — SIL — for both these measures, with the following definitions:\nIn low demand mode, SIL is a proxy for PFD; in high demand/continuous mode,\nSIL is a proxy for failure rate. (The boundary between low demand mode and high\ndemand/continuous mode is in essence set in the standards at one demand per year.\nThis is consistent with proof-test intervals of 3 to 6 months, which in many cases will\nbe the shortest feasible interval.)\nNow consider a function which protects against 2 different hazards, one of which\noccurs at a rate of 1 every 2 weeks, or 25 times per year, i.e. a high demand rate, and\nthe other at a rate of 1 in 10 years, i.e. a low demand rate. If the MTTF of the function\nis 50 years, it would qualify as achieving SIL1 for the high demand rate hazard. The\nhigh demands effectively proof-test the function against the low demand rate hazard.\nAll else being equal, the effective achieved SIL for the second hazard is given by:\n\nPFD ¼ 0:04=(2 � 50) ¼ 4 � 10[�][4] ; SIL3\n\nSo what is the SIL achieved by the function? Clearly it is not unique, but depends on\nthe hazard and in particular whether the demand rate for the hazard implies low or high\ndemand mode.\nIn the first case, the achievable SIL is intrinsic to the equipment; in the second case,\nalthough the intrinsic quality of the equipment is important, the achievable SIL is also\naffected by the testing regime. This is important in the process industry sector, where\nachievable SILs are liable to be dominated by the reliability of field equipment —\nprocess measurement instruments and, particularly, final elements such as shutdown\nvalves — which need to be regularly tested to achieve required SILs.\nThe difference between these two definitions of SIL often leads to mis-understandings.\n\nCONCEPTS OF RESIDUAL RISK, RISK REDUCTION AND REQUIRED SIL\nBoth IEC 61508 & 61511 imply that the only action of a SIS is to reduce the frequency or\nlikelihood of a hazard. Thus the model of risk (reproduced in Figure 3) is one-dimensional.\nAll the methods of determining SIL are based on similar principles:\n\nStep 1 Identify the “process risk” from the process and the BPCS\nStep 2 Identify the “tolerable risk” for the particular process\nStep 3 If the process risk exceeds the tolerable risk, then calculate the necessary risk\nreduction and whether the protection layers will operate in continuous or\ndemand mode\nStep 4 Identify the risk reduction factors achieved by other protection layers\nStep 5 Calculate the remaining risk reduction factor (RRF) or the failure rate that should\nbe achieved by the SIS and thus from Table 1 or 2 the required SIL\n\nThe residual risk is the process risk reduced by all the risk reduction factors and will\nnormally be less than the tolerable risk. Identifying the tolerable risk is a major issue that is\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Risk reduction model from IEC 61511\n\ndiscussed in Reducing Risks, Protecting People (R2P2)[5] and is beyond the scope of this\npaper. Identifying the frequencies of all initiating causes (or the demand rates used in\nSteps 1 & 3 above) is also difficult unless excellent records of all incidents are available.\n\nSOME METHODS OF DETERMINING SIL REQUIREMENTS\nIEC 61508 OFFERS 3 METHODS OF DETERMINING SIL REQUIREMENTS:\n. Quantitative method.\n. Risk graph, described in the standard as a qualitative method.\n. Hazardous event severity matrix, also described as a qualitative method.\n\nTable 1.

Semi-quantitative method (incorporating the use of fault and event trees).\n. Safety layer matrix method, described as a semi-qualitative method.\n. Calibrated risk graph, described in the standard as a semi-qualitative method, but by\nsome practitioners as a semi-quantitative method.\n. Risk graph, described as a qualitative method.\n. Layer of protection analysis (LOPA). (Although the standard does not assign this\nmethod a position on the qualitative/quantitative scale, it is weighted toward the\nquantitative end.)\n\nThese are developments and extensions of the methods originally outlined in IEC\n61508-5. They have all been used by various organisations in the determination of\nSILs, but with varying degrees of success and acceptability; and do not provide an exhaustive list of all the possible methods of risk assessment. All of these methods require some\ndegree of tailoring to meet the requirements of an individual company, together with training of the personnel who will apply them, before they can be used successfully. QRA, risk\ngraphs and LOPA are established methods for determining SIL requirements, particularly\nin the process industry sector, but LOPA is less well known in the UK and is the focus of\nthis paper.\n\nTYPICAL RESULTS\nAs one would expect, there is wide variation from installation to installation in the\nnumbers of functions that are assessed as requiring SIL ratings, but the numbers in\nTable 3 were assessed for a reasonably typical offshore gas platform. Typically in the\nprocess sector there might be a single SIL3 requirement in an application of this size,\nwhile identification of SIL4 requirements is very rare. If a SIL3 or SIL4 requirement is\nidentified it is reasonable to investigate the use made of the basic process design and\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 3.

Fire and gas detection and\nemergency shutdown are the principal examples of such functions. Assessment of the\nrequired SILs of such functions presents specific problems:\n\n. Because they operate after the event, there may already have been consequences that\nthey can do nothing to prevent or mitigate. The initial consequences must be separated\nfrom the later consequences.\n. The event may develop and escalate to a number of different eventual outcomes with a\nrange of consequence severity, depending on a number of intermediate events. Analysis of the likelihood of each outcome is a specialist task, often based on event trees\n(Figure 4).\n\nQRA\nQuantitative Risk Assessment is usually done with Fault Trees and Event Trees or\nReliability Block Diagrams (RBDs). Some people refer to a combination of Fault and\nEvent Tree as a Cause-Consequence Diagram. Figure 4 shows an example of an Event\nTree and Figures 5 and 6 show a Fault Tree and a RBD. Normally the “Top Event”\nwill be a particular hazard and provided that:\n\n. appropriate failure models are chosen for each basic event or block;\n. accurate data is available for the particular environment for each of the failure modes,\nrepairs and tests; and\n. all the relationships are correctly modelled; then\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Event tree for after the event protection\n\nthe frequency at which the hazard occurs, and hence the risk can be calculated (see textbooks, for example[6]). The successful outcome of a QRA is highly dependent on the\nassumptions that are made, the detail of the model developed to represent the hazardous\nevent and the data that is used. However well a QRA has been done it does not provide\nan absolute indication of the residual risk. A sensitivity analysis of the data and assumptions is a fundamental element of any QRA.\n\nRISK GRAPH METHODS\nFigure 7 shows a typical risk graph. The risk graph method is described in both IEC\n61508 & 61511 and is an excellent means of quickly assessing and screening a large\nnumber of safety functions so as to allow effort to be focused on the small percentage\nof critical functions. The advantages and disadvantages and range of applicability of\nrisk graphs are the main topic of a previous paper by W G Gulland at SSS04[2]. The\nresults of that paper are given in the conclusions below. In use the risk graph needs\ncalibration to align with a company’s corporate risk criteria.\nA serious limitation of the risk graph method is that it does not lend itself at all well\nto assessing “after the event” outcomes:\n\n. Demand rates would be expected to be very low, e.g. 1 in 1,000 to 10,000 years. This is\noff the scale of most of the risk graphs used.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Fault tree for overpressure at compressor outlet\n\n. The range of outcomes from function to function may be very large, from a single\ninjured person to major loss of life. The outcomes are also potentially random depending on a wide range of circumstances. Where large-scale consequences are possible,\nuse of such a coarse tool such as the risk graph method can hardly be considered\n“suitable” and “sufficient”.\n\nThe QRA and the LOPA methods do not have these limitations, particularly if the\nLOPA method is applied quantitatively and, as such, are more suited to analysing “after\nthe event” outcomes.\n\nLAYER OF PROTECTION ANALYSIS (LOPA)\nThe LOPA method was developed by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers as a\nmethod of assessing the SIL requirements of SIFs (see textbooks, for example[7]).\nThe method starts with a list of all the process hazards on an installation as identified\nby Hazard And Operability Studies (HAZOPs) or other hazard identification techniques.\nThe hazards are analysed in terms of:\n\n. Consequence description (“Impact Event Description”)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Reliability block diagram of compressor outlet pressure\n\nFigure 7. Typical risk graph\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 4. Example definitions of severity levels and mitigated event target frequencies\n\nSeverity Target Mitigated Event\nLevel Consequence Likelihood\n\nMinor Serious injury at worst No specific requirement\nSerious Serious permanent injury or up to,3E-6 per year, or 1 in\n3 fatalities .330,000 years\nExtensive 4 or 5 fatalities, 2E-6 per year, or 1 in\n.500,000 years\nCatastrophic .5 fatalities Use F-N curve\n\n. Estimate of consequence severity (“Severity Level”)\n. Description of all causes which could lead to the Impact Event (“Initiating Causes”)\n. Estimate of frequency of all Initiating Causes (“Initiation Likelihood”)\n\nThe Severity Level may be expressed in semi-quantitative terms, linked to target\nMitigated Event Likelihoods expressed as target frequency ranges (analogous to tolerable\nrisk levels), as shown in Table 4; or it may be expressed as a specific quantitative estimate\nof harm, which can be referenced to F-N curves.\nSimilarly, the Initiation Likelihood may be expressed semi-quantitatively, as shown\nin Table 5; or it may be expressed as a specific quantitative estimate.\nThe strength of the method is that it recognises that in the process industries there\nare usually several layers of protection against an Initiating Cause leading to an Impact\nEvent. Specifically, it identifies:\n\n. General Process Design. There may, for example, be aspects of the design that reduce\nthe probability of loss of containment, or of ignition if containment is lost, so reducing\nthe probability of a fire or explosion event.\n. Basic Process Control System (BPCS). Failure of a process control loop is likely to be\none of the main Initiating Causes. However, there may be another independent control\nloop that could prevent the Impact Event, and so reduce the frequency of that event.\n\nTable 5. Example definitions of initiation likelihood\n\nInitiation Likelihood Frequency Range\n\nLow,1 in 10,000 years\nMedium 1 in .100 to 10,000 years\nHigh 1 in �100 years\n\n\n-----\n\n. Alarms. Provided there is an alarm that is independent of the BPCS, sufficient time for\nan operator to respond, and an effective action to take (a “handle” to “pull”), credit can\nbe taken for alarms to reduce the probability of the Impact Event up to a RRF of 10.\n. Additional Mitigation, Restricted Access. Even if the Impact Event occurs, there may\nbe limits on the occupation of the hazardous area (equivalent to the F parameter in the\nrisk graph method), or effective means of escape from the hazardous area (equivalent to\nthe P parameter in the risk graph method), which reduce the Severity Level of the event.\n. Independent Protection Layers (IPLs). A number of criteria must be satisfied by an\nIPL to be assured that it is genuinely independent of other protective layers and\nachieves RRF �10. Relief valves and bursting disks usually qualify for RRF �100.\n\nBased on the Initiating Likelihood (frequency) and the PFDs of all the protection\nlayers listed above, an Intermediate Event Likelihood (frequency) for the Impact Event\nand the Initiating Event can be calculated. The process must be completed for all Initiating\nEvents, to determine a total Intermediate Event Likelihood for all Initiating Events. This\ncan then be compared with the target Mitigated Event Likelihood (frequency). So far no\ncredit has been taken for any SIF. The ratio:\n\n(Intermediate Event Likelihood)/(Mitigated Event Likelihood)\n\ngives the required RRF (or 1/PFD) of the SIF, and can be converted to a required SIL\nusing Table 1. Alternatively the inverse ratio\n\n(Mitigated Event Likelihood)/(Intermediate Event Likelihood)\n\ngives the required PFD of the SIF that can be converted to a required SIL using Table 1.\n\nEXAMPLES OF LOPA\nCOMPRESSOR (AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 8)\nKey assumptions for LOPA of overpressure protection for a compressor\ndriven by a gas turbine\nOverpressure of the piping downstream of compression could result in the release of significant quantities of flammable gas within or outside the compressor building.\nThe study team focused only on the explosion hazard as this had the more significant\nconsequences. Three cases were considered for high pressure:\n\n. Case A: a sudden increase in pressure from the source of gas.\n. Case B: closing a control, shutdown or isolation valve in the piping, or equipment\ndownstream of the compressor.\n. Case C: a failure of the BPCS.\n\nThe study team used the values for Individual Risk Per Annum (IRPA) (see R2P2)[5]\n\ndefined in the Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) safety report for the most\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Example of overpressure protection for a compressor driven by a gas turbine\n\nexposed person. The As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) region (see R2P2)[5] was\ndefined as IRPA in the range 10[2][3] to 10[2][6].\nThere are no occupied buildings on the neighbouring sites within 100 m of the\ncompressor building. Staff are required not to stay within the compressor building for\nlonger than 15 minutes at a time and for 20 minutes in one day (unless it is shutdown).\nThere may be one or two staff exposed for 10–20 minutes each day in the compressor\nbuilding (giving a severity of Serious). The compressor building is classified as a hazardous area, with explosion proof equipment and no exposed hot surfaces.\n\nResults of LOPA study\nThe study team assumed an IRPA Mitigated event target likelihood of 10[2][7]. The worst\ncase Intermediate event likelihood was 10[2][2] and thus a Safety Instrument Function\n(SIF) Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) of 10[2][5] is required. The details of the\nother figures are shown in Table 6. Severity levels are specified as C ¼ Catastrophic,\nE ¼ Extensive, S ¼ Serious, M ¼ Minor; and likelihood values are events per year.\nOther numerical values are probabilities of failure on demand average.\n\nLayer of protection analysis (LOPA)\nSome of the results of the LOPA are shown in Table 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 6.

Two of the impact events considered were Jet Fires and a Boiling\nLiquid Expanding Vapour Explosion (BLEVE). Some of the results of the LOPA are\nshown in Table 7.\n\nDISCUSSION OF ALL THREE METHODS\nQRA\nPage 31 of R2P2[5] states that “The use of numerical estimates of risk by themselves can, for\nseveral reasons . . ., be misleading and lead to decisions which do not meet adequate levels\nof safety. In general, qualitative learning and numerical estimates from QRA should be\ncombined with other information from engineering and operational analyses in making\nan overall decision.”\nFault Trees, Event Trees and RBDs are very valuable in showing relationships\nbetween different parts of the process, the BPCS and the protection systems. However,\nthere are difficulties in obtaining good data for all the relevant failure modes as many\nbusiness sector reliability databases have not been maintained. Therefore numerical estimates of risk will take the form of a range and judgement will be required to assess a\nrealistic figure.\nThe problems with the data also apply if LOPA is used for quantitative assessments.\n\nRISK GRAPHS\nThe implications of the issues highlighted by W G Gulland at SSS04[2] are:\n\n. Risk graphs are very useful but imprecise tools for assessing SIL requirements. (It is\ninevitable that a method with 5 parameters — C, F, P, W and SIL — each with a range\nof an order of magnitude, will produce a result with a range of 5 orders of magnitude.)\n. They must be calibrated on a conservative basis to avoid the danger that they underestimate the unprotected risk and the amount of risk reduction/protection required.\n. Their use is most appropriate when a number of functions protect against different\nhazards, which are themselves only a small proportion of the overall total hazards,\nso that it is very likely that under-estimates and over-estimates of residual risk will\naverage out when they are aggregated. Only in these circumstances can the method\nbe realistically described as providing a “suitable” and “sufficient”, and therefore\nlegal, risk assessment.\n. Higher SIL requirements (SIL2þ) incur significant capital costs (for redundancy and\nrigorous engineering requirements) and operating costs (for applying rigorous maintenance procedures to more equipment, and for proof-testing more equipment at\nhigher frequencies, and to rigorously gather and analyse performance data). They\nshould therefore be re-assessed using a more refined method.\n\n\n-----\n\nQRA Risk Graph LOPA\n\nAdvantages: Advantages: Advantages:\n1. Can be applied to complex systems and 1.

It can be used semi-quantitatively or quantitatively.\n\nB Used semi-quantitatively it has many of the same advantages as risk graph\nmethods.\n\nB Used quantitatively the logic of the analysis can still be developed as a team\nexercise, with the detail developed “off-line” by specialists.\n. It explicitly accounts for risk mitigating factors, such as alarms and relief valves,\nwhich have to be incorporated as adjustments into risk graph methods (e.g. by reducing\nthe W value to take credit for alarms, by reducing the SIL to take credit for relief\nvalves).\n. A semi-quantitative analysis of a high SIL function can be promoted to a quantitative\nanalysis without changing the format.\n. It can assist in all the team members obtaining and sharing a full appreciation of the\nissues and uncertainties associated with the hazardous event(s).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo summarise, the relative advantages and disadvantages of these methods are shown in\nTable 8, and as can be seen from Table 8 there is no ideal candidate to cover all requirements — an assessment has to be made as to the most appropriate method for a specific\nrequirement. Should the total number of functions requiring assessment be small (,10)\nand acceptable reliability data available then our experience would be to apply LOPA\nin a semi-quantitative manner. However on new installations the number of functions\nidentified in the HAZOP as requiring a SIF can be very large requiring the involvement\nof critical people in a team activity over a considerable period of time. Sufficient time\nfor this is a rare commodity these days and, in such a situation, we would recommend\nthe use of risk graphs initially for all required functions (approx. 25 functions assessed\nper day on average) and then repeat the assessment using LOPA for those functions\nassessed as �IL2 (approx. 5 functions assessed per day on average).\nWhatever process of analysis is applied they all require a corporate risk policy defining what risk level is deemed acceptable from both individual and societal perspectives —\na politically sensitive decision has to be agreed within any business organisation, with an\nacute awareness of the perception of risk held by the general public.\nWhilst the standards IEC 61508/61511 only relate to Safety of people there is little\ndoubt that the Environmental agencies will require businesses focus to improve the environment whilst stake-holders will require similar attention to commercial performance.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nSection 3.5 was first published by Springer[2] and we are grateful to them and the Safety\nCritical Systems Club for permission to include it.
