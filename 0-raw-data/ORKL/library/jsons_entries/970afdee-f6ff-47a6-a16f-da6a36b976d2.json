Since this time, we have](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2018-0626.pdf)\n\nminority groups in China.\n\ncontinued to observe the group engaging in mass credential\ntheft activity primarily targeting humanitarian, think tank, and\ngovernment organizations globally.\n\nOver the past 3 years, we have observed RedAlpha registering\nand weaponizing hundreds of domains spoofing organizations\nsuch as the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH),\nAmnesty International, the Mercator Institute for China Studies\n(MERICS), Radio Free Asia (RFA), the American Institute in Taiwan\n(AIT), and other global government, think tank, and humanitarian\norganizations that fall within the strategic interests of the Chinese\ngovernment. Historically, the group has also engaged in [direct](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2018-0626.pdf)\n[targeting of ethnic and religious minorities, including individuals](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/01/spying-on-a-budget-inside-a-phishing-operation-with-targets-in-the-tibetan-community/)\nand organizations within Tibetan and Uyghur communities. As\nhighlighted within this report, in recent years RedAlpha has also\ndisplayed a particular interest in spoofing political, government,\nand think tank organizations in Taiwan, likely in an effort to\ngather political intelligence.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Background\n\nAlthough it has been controlling large amounts of operational\ninfrastructure and maintaining a high operational tempo since at\nleast 2015, there has been minimal public reporting on RedAlpha\n[activity over the past several years. First identified by CitizenLab](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/01/spying-on-a-budget-inside-a-phishing-operation-with-targets-in-the-tibetan-community/)\nin 2018, the group was observed conducting credential-phishing\noperations targeting the Tibetan community and other ethnic\nminorities, as well as social movements, a media group, and\ngovernment agencies in South and Southeast Asia. In June 2018,\n[we published activity linked to 2 RedAlpha campaigns that also](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2018-0626.pdf)\ntargeted the Tibetan community to ultimately deploy the opensource malware family NjRAT. These 2 campaigns overlapped\nwith the CitizenLab reporting based on matching WHOIS\nregistrant data, common targeting of the Tibetan community,\nand hosting overlaps. RedAlpha activity explored in this report\nis also referenced in PWC’s 2021 [year in review, in which they](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-report-download.pdf)\ntrack the group under the name Red Dev 3.\n\nHistorical RedAlpha activity targeted multiple ethnic and\nreligious minority communities that have been persecuted within\nChina, including Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Falun Gong supporters.\nMore generally, organizations and individuals associated with\nethnic and religious minorities within the PRC, particularly those\n[within the so-called “Five Poisons”, have been a frequent target](https://warontherocks.com/2016/07/managing-the-power-within-chinas-state-security-commission/)\nfor cyber threat activity groups linked to Chinese intelligence\nagencies over many years. This has included RedDelta (Mustang\n[Panda, TA416) targeting the Vatican and organizations linked to](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf)\nTibetan and Hong Kong Catholic communities; Chinese Ministry\n[of State Security (MSS) contractors targeting emails belonging](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1295981/download)\n[to Chinese Christian religious figures; APT41 (Barium) conducting](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1317206/download)\n[reconnaissance on activists and other individuals associated with](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1317206/download)\nHong Kong’s pro-democracy movement; and the use of zero-day\n[vulnerabilities to target members of the Uyghur community.](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/31/china-google-iphone-uyghur/)\n\n#### Threat Analysis\n\nOver the past 3 years, Recorded Future has observed\nRedAlpha continuing to conduct credential-phishing activity\nusing large clusters of operational infrastructure to support\ncampaigns. Over this period, the group displayed a consistent\nset of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). In late\n2019 and early 2020, the group likely shifted away from older\ninfrastructure TTPs exhibited in [public](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/01/spying-on-a-budget-inside-a-phishing-operation-with-targets-in-the-tibetan-community/) [reporting, such as the](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2018-0626.pdf)\nregistration of domains through GoDaddy and hosting on Choopa\n(Vultr) and Forewin Telecom infrastructure, and toward those\ndescribed in the following section.\n\n\n##### RedAlpha Infrastructure Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nSince at least 2015, RedAlpha has consistently registered and\nweaponized large amounts of domains for use in credential-theft\ncampaigns. These domains typically imitate well-known email\nservice providers and spoof specific organizations that are either\ndirectly targeted in RedAlpha activity or that can be used to\nimpersonate those organizations in activity targeting proximate\norganizations and individuals. In 2021, we noted a significant\nuptick in the volume of domains registered by the group, totalling\nover 350. Over this period, the group’s infrastructure TTPs were\ncharacterized by the following criteria that allowed us to cluster\nthis activity together:\n\n  - Use of *resellerclub[.]com nameservers\n\n  - Use of the virtual private server (VPS) hosting provider\n\nVirtual Machine Solutions LLC (VirMach)\n\n  - Consistent domain naming conventions, such as the use\n\nof “mydrive-”, “accounts-”, “mail-”, “drive-”, and “files-”\nstrings across hundreds of domains\n\n  - Overlapping WHOIS registrant names, email addresses,\n\nphone numbers, and organizations\n\n  - The use of specific server-side technology components\n\nand fake HTTP 404 Not Found errors\n\nOutside of generic spoofing of major email and storage\nservice providers like Yahoo (135 typosquat domains), Google\n(91 typosquat domains), and Microsoft (70 typosquat domains),\nwe observed the use of large numbers of domains typosquatting\nhumanitarian, think tank, and government organizations including:\n\n  - Radio Free Asia\n\n  - Mercator Institute for China Studies\n\n  - Amnesty International\n\n  - International Federation for Human Rights\n\n  - American Chamber of Commerce (including AmCham\n\nTaiwan)\n\n  - Purdue University\n\n  - India’s National Informatics Centre\n\n  - Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party\n\n  - American Institute in Taiwan\n\n  - Ministries of foreign affairs in multiple countries globally\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Number of RedAlpha typosquat domains by spoofed organization_\n\n_Figure 2: Recorded Future typosquat risk rule for RedAlpha credential-phishing domain amcham[.]space spoofing American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM)_\n\nIn many cases highlighted over the following sections,\nobserved phishing pages mirrored legitimate email login portals\nfor the specific organizations named above. We suspect that\nthis means they were intended to target individuals directly\naffiliated with these organizations rather than simply imitating\nthese organizations to target other third parties. In other cases,\nthe phishing pages used generic login pages for popular mail\nproviders and the intended targeting was ambiguous. The\ngroup has used basic PDF files containing links to the identified\nphishing sites, typically stating that a user needs to click the link\nto preview or download files.\n\n_Figure 3: Sample PDFs linking to RedAlpha credential-phishing domains - Top: Translation_\n_(Traditional Chinese): “Preview or Download Files” with link to milfiles[.]download; Bottom: Phishing_\n_link to RedAlpha domain outlookfiles[.]download_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Targeting of Humanitarian Organizations and Think Tanks\n\nAs noted, RedAlpha has regularly registered domains imitating\nhumanitarian organizations and think tanks, including MERICS,\nFIDH, Amnesty International, RFA, and multiple Taiwanese think\ntanks. Of particular note, the registration of at least 16 domains\nspoofing MERICS from early to mid-2021 coincided with the\n[Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) imposing sanctions](https://merics.org/en/press-release/statement-sanctions-imposed-china-also-affect-merics)\non the Berlin-based think tank in March 2021.\n\n_Figure 4: Fake Roundcube login page spoofing International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)_\n_email login hosted on RedAlpha domain files-fidh[.]org_\n\n_Figure 5: Fake Zimbra login page spoofing Radio Free Asia email login hosted on RedAlpha domain_\n_my-rfa[.]org_\n\n\n##### RedAlpha’s Consistent Focus on Taiwan\n\nOver the past 3 years, we observed RedAlpha consistently\nregister domains spoofing Taiwanese or Taiwan-based\ngovernment, think tank, and political organizations. Notably, this\nincluded the registration of multiple domains imitating the AIT,\n[the de facto embassy of the United States of America in Taiwan,](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/12/619197199/de-facto-u-s-embassy-in-taiwan-dedicates-new-complex-over-chinese-objections)\n[during a time of increasing US-China tension regarding Taiwan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-says-u-s-would-intervene-militarily-if-china-invaded-taiwan-11653286228)\nover the past year. Similar to wider activity, these domains were\nused in credential-phishing activity using fake login pages for\npopular email providers such as Outlook, as well as emulating\nother email software such as Zimbra used by these particular\norganizations (see Figure 6). A sample list of typosquat domains\nseen spoofing Taiwanese organizations is included in Table 1.\n\n_Figure 6: Fake Zimbra login page spoofing Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)_\n_email login hosted on RedAlpha domain mydrive-taitra[.]link_\n\n\n-----\n\nTaiwan External Trade Development\n\nfiles-taitra[.]org Council (TAITRA)\n\nTaiwan External Trade\n\nmydrive-taitra[.]link Development Council (TAITRA)\n\nmyfiles-dpp[.]link Democratic Progressive Party\n\nmy-dpp[.]org Democratic Progressive Party\n\ndppmail[.]download Democratic Progressive Party\n\nfiles-dpp[.]org Democratic Progressive Party\n\nfiles-dpp[.]space Democratic Progressive Party\n\nChung-Hua Institution for Economic\n\nfiles-cier-edu[.]link Research (CIER)\n\nChung-Hua Institution for Economic\n\nfiles-cier[.]link Research (CIER)\n\nInstitute for National Defense and\nSecurity Research\n\nfiles-mail-indsr[.]link (國防安全研究院)\n\nMinistry of Economic Affairs\n\nmoea[.]site (MOEA)\n\n_Table 1: RedAlpha credential-phishing domains spoofing organizations in Taiwan_\n\n##### RedAlpha’s Targeting of Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Embassies\n\n_Figure 7: Fake Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs email login page seen on RedAlpha domain_\n_drive-mofa[.]com_\n\n\nAs noted in PWC’s 2021 year-in-review [report, RedAlpha’s](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-report-download.pdf)\nactivity has expanded over the past several years to include\ncredential-phishing campaigns spoofing ministries of foreign\naffairs in multiple countries. We observed phishing pages\nimitating webmail login portals for Taiwan and Portugal’s MOFAs\n(see Figures 7 and 8), as well as multiple domains spoofing Brazil\nand Vietnam’s MOFAs. The previous section also highlighted\nconsistent use of domains imitating the AIT. The group has also\nconsistently spoofed login pages for India’s National Informatics\nCentre (NIC), which manages wider IT infrastructure and services\nfor the Indian government.\n\n##### RedAlpha Domain Spoofed Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nfiles-itamaraty-gov[.]space Brazil\n\nitamaraty-gov[.]com Brazil\n\nfiles-mne[.]space Portugal\n\nmydrive-mne-pt[.]space Portugal\n\nmofa-vn[.]online Vietnam\n\nsettings-mofavn[.]online Vietnam\n\ndrive-mofa-vn[.]online Vietnam\n\nfiles-mfa[.]link\nfilesmofa-gov[.]com\nmydrive-mofa[.]space\ndrive-mofa[.]com\nmy-mofa[.]space\nfiles-mofa[.]space\nmofa-gov[.]site\nmofasec[.]site\nfiles-mofa[.]com\nfiles-mofa[.]link Generic MOFA Domains\n\n_Table 2: RedAlpha credential-phishing domains spoofing ministries of foreign affairs_\n\n|RedAlpha Domain|Spoofed Organization|\n|---|---|\n|ait-org[.]tw|American Institute in Taiwan|\n|files-ait[.]link|American Institute in Taiwan|\n|files-ait[.]org|American Institute in Taiwan|\n|my-ait[.]link|American Institute in Taiwan|\n|files-taitra[.]org|Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)|\n|mydrive-taitra[.]link|Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)|\n|myfiles-dpp[.]link|Democratic Progressive Party|\n|my-dpp[.]org|Democratic Progressive Party|\n|dppmail[.]download|Democratic Progressive Party|\n|files-dpp[.]org|Democratic Progressive Party|\n|files-dpp[.]space|Democratic Progressive Party|\n|files-cier-edu[.]link|Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER)|\n|files-cier[.]link|Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER)|\n|files-mail-indsr[.]link|Institute for National Defense and Security Research (國防安全研究院)|\n|moea[.]site|Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)|\n\n|RedAlpha Domain|Spoofed Ministry of Foreign Affairs|\n|---|---|\n|files-itamaraty-gov[.]space|Brazil|\n|itamaraty-gov[.]com|Brazil|\n|files-mne[.]space|Portugal|\n|mydrive-mne-pt[.]space|Portugal|\n|mofa-vn[.]online|Vietnam|\n|settings-mofavn[.]online|Vietnam|\n|drive-mofa-vn[.]online|Vietnam|\n|files-mfa[.]link filesmofa-gov[.]com mydrive-mofa[.]space drive-mofa[.]com my-mofa[.]space files-mofa[.]space mofa-gov[.]site mofasec[.]site files-mofa[.]com files-mofa[.]link|Generic MOFA Domains|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Fake Indian Government email login page seen on RedAlpha domain files-nic[.]online (left)_\n_and fake Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MNE) email login page seen on RedAlpha domain_\n_files-mne[.]online (right)_\n\n\n#### Attribution\n\nWe identified multiple overlaps with previous publicly\nreported RedAlpha campaigns that allowed us to assess this is\nvery likely a continuation of the group’s activity. Of note, in at\nleast 5 instances the group appeared to re-register previously\nowned domains after expiry. An alternative hypothesis we\nconsidered is whether a separate actor registered these domains\nin an attempt to emulate RedAlpha activity and conduct similar\ncredential-theft targeting in line with Chinese state interests.\nHowever, based on additional evidence linking this more recent\nactivity to historically reported campaigns, we believe that\nthis is unlikely and that it instead constitutes a continuation\nof RedAlpha activity. The re-registration of previously owned\ndomains may instead be a product of multiple factors such as\nthe sheer volume of domains registered by the group, poor\ninfrastructure management, and the repetitive nature of naming\nconventions used. Some of the attribution evidence we observed\nis summarized below and displayed in Figure 9.\n\n  - The domain mydrive-google[.]online was observed in\n\nCitizen Lab’s original reporting on the group and was\noriginally registered using the email address deepcliff@\nsina[.]com . This same domain was observed in more\n2021 RedAlpha activity and was hosted on the VirMach\nIP address 172.245.81[.]180 alongside a host of other\nRedAlpha domains spoofing entities such as MERICS and\nFIDH.\n\n  - The domain edit-yahoo[.]space was also originally\n\nreferenced in Citizen Lab and Recorded Future reporting\non RedAlpha activity, and was later hosted on VirMach\nIP address 107.172.39[.]25 in 2021 alongside additional\nRedAlpha domains spoofing organizations such as Radio\nFree Asia.\n\n  - Another domain seen in earlier RedAlpha activity,\n\nmail-protect[.]space, was reregistered and hosted on\nthen-dedicated infrastructure on 45.114.125[.]130 in\n2018. This IP concurrently hosted the similarly named\nmail-method[.]space . Mail-method[.]space was later\nhosted on the Forewin Telecom IP address 118.99.51[.]31\nin mid-2018. This IP address is used for command\nand control (C2) by the malware sample SHA256\n2c03d3f3e6d8c08db2322153d95262f6ace9288bff6d7e\n4c729517aecc2713af compiled and submitted to public\nmalware repositories during that time. We identified\n2 additional samples belonging to this same custom\n[malware family which share matching import hashes](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/tracking-malware-import-hashing)\nand use the respective C2 domains phpinfo[.]pw and\nmicrobug[.]info . Both of these domains are linked to\n[original reporting on RedAlpha activity.](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/01/spying-on-a-budget-inside-a-phishing-operation-with-targets-in-the-tibetan-community/)\n\n\n-----\n\n- Another notable aspect of the mail-protect[.]\n\nspace domain is that it was originally registered by\nevalliang@163[.]com. We associated this email address\nwith a persona using the moniker Mr. Liang (full name\nomitted for the purposes of this report), who was\nobserved registering domains seen in earlier RedAlpha\nactivity. Notably, this domain was later reregistered after\nexpiry using the email address girder1992@hotmail[.]com\n. This “girder” handle also has links to historical RedAlpha\nactivity (see next section on RedAlpha’s Links to Private\nContractor). This, coupled with the malware connection\noutlined in the previous point, provides evidence that\nthe observed cases of domain re-registration were likely\nconducted by the same actor.\n\n- The domain drive-mail[.]space was also registered using\n\nthe deepcliff@sina[.]com email address and referenced\nin public reporting on the group’s activity. This domain\nwas later hosted on 115.126.25[.]13 in 2019 alongside\nRedAlpha domains spoofing entities such as Purdue\nUniversity and Indonesia’s National Counter Terrorism\nAgency. The spoofing of Purdue University was observed\non multiple other occasions from 2019 onwards.\n\n- Other similarities observed include overlapping domain\nnaming conventions seen in historical and more recent\nactivity. An example of this is the use of domains\nspoofing Thailand’s Department of Special Investigation\n(DSI), where mail-dsi-go[.]space was identified in\n[CitizenLab’s reporting and both files-dsi-go-th[.]link and](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/01/spying-on-a-budget-inside-a-phishing-operation-with-targets-in-the-tibetan-community/)\nfiles-dsi-go[.]space were observed in more recent 2021\nactivity.\n\n- Similarly, the use of the string mg followed by 1 or 2\n\ndigits was a common trait seen in historical and more\nrecent activity spoofing Yahoo mail services, such\nas mail-mg16-yahoo[.]cf referenced in CitizenLabs’s\nreporting and mg12-mail[.]link seen in 2021 activity.\n\n- The use of non-exclusive domain-naming tendencies\n\n(such as the inclusion of the strings “mydrive-”,\n“accounts-”, “mail-”, “drive-”, and “files-”) was also\ncommon across both sets of activity.\n\n\n##### RedAlpha’s Links to Private Contractor\n\n[In our previous public reporting, we identified a link between](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2018-0626.pdf)\nRedAlpha and a Chinese information security company. A specific\nQQ email address that was used to register multiple RedAlpha\ndomains also appeared on a job listing for an “information\nsecurity engineer” for a company called “Nanjing Qinglan\nInformation Technology Co., Ltd.” (南京青苜信息技术有限公司)\nseveral years prior. This company, now known as “Jiangsu Cimer\nInformation Security Technology Co. Ltd.” (江苏君立华域信息安\n全技术股份), reportedly provides “security assessment, security\nreinforcement, penetration testing, security consulting, offensive\nand defensive drills, security training”. The associated persona\nlinked to the QQ account and on the job listing was listed as “Mr.\nLiang/Leung”. Notably, multiple email addresses used to register\nearly RedAlpha domains [referenced in CitizenLab reporting](https://github.com/citizenlab/malware-indicators/blob/master/201801_SpyingOnABudget/indicators.csv)\nfeatured the string “Liang” or ”Leung” and a full registrant name\nwhich matches the owner of the linked QQ account.\n\nWe identified 3 Chinese-language blog sites registered by\nthe Mr. Liang persona over several years, which featured frequent\nposts on information security and hacking topics. One of these\nlinked directly to Mr. Liang’s QQ page, which referenced both their\nfull-name moniker and the same QQ number. Historical versions\nof Mr. Liang’s QQ page revealed they are a “network security\nexpert” and a former member of the Chinese underground\nhacking group Green Corps (绿色兵团).\n\nNotably, one of Mr. Liang’s personal blog domains was also\nlinked to an additional registrant email address featuring the\nmoniker “girder” in 2014. At this time, the page also displayed\nthe header “girder’s blog”. In the previous section, we noted that\nthe email address girder1992@hotmail[.]com was later used to\nregister a batch of RedAlpha operational domains in 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Screenshot from one of Mr. Liang’s personal blogs in 2014 displaying “Girder” moniker_\n_(subheading translated from Simplified Chinese)_\n\nBased on these findings and wider activity examined, it\nis very likely that RedAlpha operators are located within the\nPRC. Chinese intelligence services’ use of private contractors\nis also an established trend, with groups such as APT3, APT10,\nRedBravo (APT31), and APT40 all identified as contractors\n[working for China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) (1,2,3,4).](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-three-chinese-hackers-who-work-internet-security-firm-hacking-three-corporations)\nIn the case of RedAlpha, the group’s targeting closely aligns\nwith the strategic interests of the Chinese government, such\nas the observed emphasis on China-focused think tanks, civil\nsociety organizations, and Taiwanese government and political\nentities. This targeting, coupled with the identification of likely\nChina-based operators, indicates a likely Chinese state-nexus\nto RedAlpha activity.\n\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nWe recommend that users conduct the following measures\nto detect and mitigate activity associated with RedAlpha activity:\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS),\n\nintrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network\ndefense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon\nreview, consider blocking connection attempts to and\nfrom — the external IP addresses and domains linked in\nthe Outlook section below.\n\n  - Use strong passwords, in conjunction with multi-factor\n\nauthentication (MFA) enabled where possible, to limit the\npotential damage of credential theft.\n\n  - Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat domains\n\nspoofing your organization and vendors, through the\n[Recorded Future® Brand Intelligence module.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\n\n  - Enforce strong security awareness through interactive\n\nexercises; train users to recognize phishing emails\nand exercise caution when clicking on links or opening\nattachments in emails to make accounts less susceptible\nto unauthorized logins.\n\n  - Monitor for unusual and anomalous account login\n\npatterns through methods such as monitoring for the\nunexpected use of anonymization services such as Tor or\ncommercial VPNs.\n\n  - For high-profile individuals likely to be targeted by\n\nstate-sponsored actors, such as activists, journalists,\nor human rights campaigners, consider employing extra\n[precautionary measures such as Gmail’s Advanced](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/)\n[Protection Program.](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Outlook\n\nOur research uncovered the suspected China statesponsored group RedAlpha conducting credential-harvesting\nactivity targeting individuals and organizations globally, with a\nparticular focus on civil society and government sectors. The\ngroup has used a consistent set of TTPs to register and manage\nlarge clusters of operational phishing infrastructure, using a\nmixture of pages impersonating popular email provider logins\nand custom webmail login pages to mimic specific providers and\norganizations. Since 2015, the group has engaged in consistent\ntargeting of individual citizens and groups associated with\nminority communities, many of which are subject to reported\nhuman rights abuses within China. More generally, Chinese statesponsored groups continue to aggressively target dissident and\nminority groups and individuals, both domestically through state\nsurveillance and internationally through cyber-enabled intrusion\nactivity. This targeting of sensitive and vulnerable communities,\nmany of which have security budget and resources constraints,\nis particularly concerning.\n\nReaders can access the RedAlpha indicators observed\n[through our public Insikt Group Github repository: https://github.](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research)\n[com/Insikt-Group/Research (RedAlpha Conducts Multi-year](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research)\n**Credential Theft Campaign Targeting Global Humanitarian,**\n**Think Tank, and Government Organizations - June 2022).**\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group, the company’s threat research division, comprises\n\nanalysts and security researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and\n\nintelligence agency experience.
