    "plain_text": "# Jamba Superdeal: Helo Sir, you want to buy mask? - Corona Safety Mask SMS Scam\n\n**[dissectingmalwa.re/jamba-superdeal-helo-sir-you-want-to-buy-mask-corona-safety-mask-sms-scam.html](https://dissectingmalwa.re/jamba-superdeal-helo-sir-you-want-to-buy-mask-corona-safety-mask-sms-scam.html)**\n\nFri 20 March 2020 in [Mobile](https://dissectingmalwa.re/category/mobile.html)\n\nAs if there wasn't enough pain and suffering in the world already because of COVID-19 some\ncriminals still try to piggyback on the fear of others. A quick look at an Andorid SMS \"Worm\".\n\nSince the current COVID-19 outbreak is getting masively taken advantage of by various\ncybercriminals I thought it would be a good opportunity to try out Android reverse\nengineering. Let's dive right in:\n\nThe following dynamic part of this analysis was done in VirtualBox with the most recent\nVersion of [Android-x86. For those playing along at home: The Setup is really simple (as Live](https://www.android-x86.org/)\nBooting is sufficient). Just remember to crank up the Video Memory, change the Graphics\nControler to VBoxVGA and enable 3D Acceleration as otherwise the VM will only boot to a\ncommand prompt.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the installation process there are no permissions to be granted to it.\n\nBefore finishing the installation there is a Google Play Protect warning already. I'm not sure if\nthis is a signature based detection or actually based on the expected behaviour while parsing\nthe package. I'll install it anyway.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter opening \"Corona Safety Mask\" for the first time it will ask for the permission to access\nthe user's address book.\n\nAnd secondly it requires the permission to send SMS messages as well. This should be a\nred flag to users in general if the request is made without any notice as to why this\npermission is required (e.g. a second factor authentication). Scams like this can get very\nexpensive for the user which is probably also one of the major goals of this malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow you can see the main (and only) view of the app. Questionable content, more typos...\nred flags everywhere, but some people might just be desperate enough to fall for it.\n\nFor static analysis of the apk File I'll be using jadx-GUI. Below you can find the Github\nRepository.\n\nIt works very well for my purposes here and it even has a dark mode 😎\n\nUpon tapping the \"Get Safety Mask\" button in the app it will direct you to a second website\ncalled Masksbox which might be part of a larger scam setup.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen I visited the page this morning it was displaying this downtime message. A quick\ncheck via archive.org didn't return a recent snapshot of the page.\n\nA few hours later the website was back up with a partialy configured Wordpress CMS. The\nNavbar makes it quite obvious that the page is still being built.\n\n\n-----\n\nOf course there can't be a malware sample without at least one funny typo. Here we can also\nsee that the app is using the EasyPermissions wrapper library to handle contacts and SMS\nfunctionality.\n\nThis section of the code is responsible for reading the contents of the victims address book\nand writing them to a list.\n\nDepending on the size of the contacts list it will either start at a random index and work its\nway up if there are over 100 contacts in the list or it will just send a SMS to all contacts if\nthere are less than 100 in the list\n\n\n-----\n\nLastly we can take a look at the signature of the APK. It was signed with the CN \"Hemant\nPrajapat\", but that is a fake name for sure. Other than that there's not much interesting info\nto get from this.\n\nAnd that's it! In times like this it is especially important to keep your means of communication\nsafe, so better be extra careful. Stay home, stay safe (on the interwebs) and most\nimportantly: stay healthy (applies to you and your devices).\n\n## IOCs\n\n### CoronaSafetyMask\n```\nCoronaSafetyMask.apk --> SHA256:\n8a87cfe676d177061c0b3cbb9bdde4cabee0f1af369bbf8e2d9088294ba9d3b1\n             SSDEEP:\n24576:KjQEzqDqCXaTJwv2AbxMHKR+ZCGPEmD8oJxmLaRyiLQuZgvNwN:wqDjaNcdRNw8+xm2RFEuZgvNk\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### URLs\n```\nhxxp://coronasafetymask[.]tk\nhxxp://masksbox[.]com\n\n```\n\n-----",
