    "plain_text": "# Avalanche (crimeware-as-a-service infrastructure)\n\n**us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA16-336A**\n\n## Systems Affected\n\nMicrosoft Windows\n\n## Overview\n\n“Avalanche” refers to a large global network hosting infrastructure used by cyber criminals to\nconduct phishing and malware distribution campaigns and money mule schemes. The United\nStates Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in collaboration with the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), is releasing this Technical Alert to provide further information about\nAvalanche.\n\n## Description\n\nCyber criminals utilized Avalanche botnet infrastructure to host and distribute a variety of\nmalware variants to victims, including the targeting of over 40 major financial institutions.\nVictims may have had their sensitive personal information stolen (e.g., user account\ncredentials). Victims’ compromised systems may also have been used to conduct other\nmalicious activity, such as launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or distributing malware\nvariants to other victims’ computers.\n\nIn addition, Avalanche infrastructure was used to run money mule schemes where criminals\nrecruited people to commit fraud involving transporting and laundering stolen money or\nmerchandise.\n\nAvalanche used fast-flux DNS, a technique to hide the criminal servers, behind a constantly\nchanging network of compromised systems acting as proxies.\n\nThe following malware families were hosted on the infrastructure:\n\nWindows-encryption Trojan horse (WVT) (aka Matsnu, Injector,Rannoh,Ransomlock.P)\nURLzone (aka Bebloh)\nCitadel\nVM-ZeuS (aka KINS)\nBugat (aka Feodo, Geodo, Cridex, Dridex, Emotet)\nnewGOZ (aka GameOverZeuS)\nTinba (aka TinyBanker)\nNymaim/GozNym\nVawtrak (aka Neverquest)\nMarcher\n\n\n-----\n\nPandabanker\nRanbyus\nSmart App\nTeslaCrypt\niBanking Trusteer App Trojan\nXswkit\n\nAvalanche was also used as a fast flux botnet which provides communication infrastructure\nfor other botnets, including the following:\n\nTeslaCrypt\nNymaim\nCorebot\nGetTiny\nMatsnu\nRovnix\nUrlzone\nQakBot (aka Qbot, PinkSlip Bot)\n\n## Impact\n\nA system infected with Avalanche-associated malware may be subject to malicious activity\nincluding the theft of user credentials and other sensitive data, such as banking and credit\ncard information. Some of the malware had the capability to encrypt user files and demand a\nransom be paid by the victim to regain access to those files. In addition, the malware may\nhave allowed criminals unauthorized remote access to the infected computer. Infected\nsystems could have been used to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\n## Solution\n\nUsers are advised to take the following actions to remediate malware infections associated\nwith Avalanche:\n\n_Use and maintain anti-virus software – Anti-virus software recognizes and protects your_\ncomputer against most known viruses. Even though parts of Avalanche are designed to\nevade detection, security companies are continuously updating their software to\ncounter these advanced threats. Therefore, it is important to keep your anti-virus\nsoftware up-to-date. If you suspect you may be a victim of an Avalanche malware,\nupdate your anti-virus software definitions and run a full-system scan. (See\n[Understanding Anti-Virus Software for more information.)](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-005)\n_Avoid clicking links in email – Attackers have become very skilled at making phishing_\nemails look legitimate. Users should ensure the link is legitimate by typing the link into\n[a new browser (see Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014)\ninformation).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Change your passwords – Your original passwords may have been compromised_\nduring the infection, so you should change them. (See Choosing and Protecting\nPasswords for more information.)\n_Keep your operating system and application software up-to-date – Install software_\npatches so that attackers cannot take advantage of known problems or vulnerabilities.\nYou should enable automatic updates of the operating system if this option is available.\n(See [Understanding Patches for more information.)](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-006)\n_Use anti-malware tools – Using a legitimate program that identifies and removes_\nmalware can help eliminate an infection. Users can consider employing a remediation\ntool. A non-exhaustive list of examples is provided below.
