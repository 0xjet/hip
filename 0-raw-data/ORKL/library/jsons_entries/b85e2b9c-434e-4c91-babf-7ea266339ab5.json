Usually, these\nproviders ignore abuse complaints, giving threat actors an ideal platform to conduct various\nmalicious activities.\n\nBPH providers prefer to operate in jurisdictions that have lenient laws against such conduct.\nDue to the different laws in different countries, this creates a significant gray area that allows\nBPH providers to claim immunity to what their customers (threat actors) host.\n\nIn addition to malicious activities, some of the other services enabled / hosted by BPH\nproviders include online gambling, the sharing of copyrighted materials, misinformation, etc.\n\nA number of online monikers are associated with individuals involved in the provision of BPH\n[services, and include; Yalishanda, BraZZZerS, MoreneHost, and Vicetemple.](https://medium.com/csis-techblog/inside-view-of-brazzzersff-infrastructure-89b9188fd145)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nELITETEAM, a bulletproof hosting provider registered in the Republic of Seychelles, is\nassociated with multiple malicious campaigns.\n\nMultiple distinct clusters of threat activity were noted, operating from IP addresses\nwithin a netblock associated with ELITETEAM.\n\nEach threat cluster had seemingly different “goals”, from directly stealing banking\ninformation to deploying ransomware and crypto miners. With a diverse range of\ntargets, and notable differences in attacker TTPs.\n\nEvidence was identified, based on AS announcements, linking ELITETEAM to another\nknown Russian bulletproof hosting provider.\n\n## ELITETEAM Netblock Summary\n\nELITETEAM owns four different ASNs as “1337TEAM LIMITED”: AS39770, AS60424,\n**AS56873, and AS51381, but mainly operates from AS51381, which is associated with**\nnetblock 185.215.113.0/24.\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking at the WHOIS data related to this netblock, an address in Seychelles is provided:\n\nFigure 1: ELITETEAM WHOIS Data\n\nThe address “Global Gateway 8, Rue de la Perle office “1337TEAM LIMITED”, Seychelles”\nwas previously disclosed in documents commonly referred to as the Panama Papers and\n[Offshore Leaks, indicating that ELITETEAM may use Seychelles as a front for their](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/268629)\noperations, whilst controlling them from another location.\n\nInfrastructure Summary\n\nThe identified malicious infrastructure, hosted via ELITETEAM and discussed in this blog\npost, is divided into three different clusters, as follows:\n\nCluster 1: Malvertising and info-stealing\n\nCluster 2: Phishing\n\nCluster 3: Skimming\n\nCluster 1\n\nThe first cluster, and currently the most active one, was previously observed (since\n[December 2020), targeting victims through exploitation of the Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2021-44228)\nvulnerability. However, since around February 2022, we have observed a switch to the use of\n\n\n-----\n\nmalvertising campaigns, using fake software as a lure, leading to the installation of the\nAmadey malware on victim machines.\n\nFigure 2: Malvertising Campaign\n\nFollowing the initial installation of Amadey, depending on the version number of the malware,\n(3.08 through to 3.21 was observed in this cluster) one of two payloads are then dropped;\nRedline stealer, or Smokeloader. It appears the initial goal of the threat actors is the theft of\nvictim information / credentials, however further payloads were also observed being dropped,\nincluding Djvu ransomware and crypto miners.\n\nDuring this investigation, we focused our research on five Amadey C2 servers:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Amadey C2 Servers\n\n**Note: For reasons unknown, this cluster hosts multiple different versions of Amadey,**\n**all of which are currently in use in attacks.**\n\nPivoting on URL strings associated with the Amadey C2 servers (Figure 2), we were able to\nidentify a list of tasks hosted on 185.215.113.92 (Amadey version 3.21).\n\nFigure 4: Tasks Hosted on 185.215.113.92\n\nThe payloads associated with these tasks appeared to be hosted on a Bitbucket account\nnamed ‘USASoftwareDevelopment’.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: USASoftwareDevelopment Bitbucket Account\n\nAnalysis of these payloads identify them as Redline stealer executables (botnet: IMHOTEP),\nwhich are likely loaded onto victim systems to facilitate data theft and systems\nreconnaissance. Data from victim systems is then exfiltrated to 185.215.113.217.\n\n**Note: The number of downloads recorded against each payload provides a further**\n**indication to the scale of this activity.**\n\nFigure 6: Data Exfiltration to 185.215.113.217\n\nSimilar findings were also observed for 185.215.113.205, which was not initially identified as\nan Amadey C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Tasks Hosted on 185.215.113.205\n\nIn this case, the payloads were hosted on a different Bitbucket account (‘Alex’), but again all\nof the samples analyzed were identified as Redline stealer. Of note, data exfiltration for these\npayloads was to 65.21.133.231 (assigned to AS24940 - Hetzner Online GmbH).\n\nFigure 8: Data Exfiltration to 65.21.133.231\n\nExamining threat telemetry for 65.21.133.231:47430, it is apparent that this particular\ncampaign became active on 20 August 2022, and to date has seen at least 500 victims. The\nobserved victims were dispersed globally, with the highest concentrations in Brazil, India, and\nSouth Africa, based on IP geo-location data.\n\nFinally, a third Bitbucket account (named ‘mrssoprano666’) was identified, again associated\nwith 185.215.113.92.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: ‘mrssoprano666’ Bitbucket Account\n\nIn this case, we pay witness to a potential “career” change. We identified a user called\n‘mrssoprano666’ on an underground Russian-language forum, offering ‘physical’ services\nassociated with fraudulent activity. These services included answering telephone calls,\nmaking calls to victims (posing as a bank or shop), and the rerouting of parcels.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Forum Post by mrssoprano666\n\nBased on the timeline of activity on this forum, it appears that the user ‘mrssoprano666’\ndisappeared in 2020 (having advertised their services since 2018) before subsequently reappearing as a cybercrime affiliate this year.\n\nCluster 2\n\nThe second cluster is mainly used to conduct phishing campaigns, with a particular focus on\nthe spoofing of investment and cryptocurrency platforms. This cluster is highly active,\nparticularly considering AS51381 only accounts for 256 IP addresses, ranking 8th place in\nInterisle’s [Phishing Landscape 2021 behind much larger ASs.](https://www.interisle.net/PhishingLandscape2021.pdf)\n\nFigure 11: Phishing Landscape 2021 Rankings\n\nThree IPs are used to host phishing sites:\n\n**185.215.113.100**\n\nObserved most recently in a campaign targeting Polish Credit-Agricole users.\n\n**185.215.113.201**\n\nUsed as a Redline Stealer C2 until April 2022\n\n\n-----\n\nSwitched to phishing purposes in June 2022\n\n**185.215.113.206**\n\nAs noted previously, there is a financial flavor to this cluster, in one campaign we observed\nthe targeting of Fidelity customers, in an attempt to steal credentials.\n\nFigure 12: Phishing Page Targeting Fidelity\n\nInterestingly, there was also a second stage to this attack; usually attackers are simply\nseeking credentials, but in this case it appears the attackers wanted to double up on the\nopportunity. Once a user had entered their credentials, they were directed to download a file\ncalled ‘Fidelity Protect Services’. This is a completely fictitious product offering from Fidelity,\nbut continues to be a highly convincing part of the scam.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Fidelity Protect Services\n\nThe file (hosted at cv19alert[.]com/fidelityprotect.exe) was not available for download at the\ntime of our investigation. However, a copy was uploaded to Virustotal on 28 June 2022 by a\nuser in the United States (MD5: 4532b0d0ca6330bf73e0d6f76f8cf35b).\n\nAnalysis of the sample identifies it as a Raccoon Stealer V2 payload, with the timeline\n[aligning with the malware first being spotted in the wild (and initially referred to as](https://blog.sekoia.io/raccoon-stealer-v2-part-1-the-return-of-the-dead/)\nRecordBreaker based on User Agent strings).\n\nIn the first stage, the malware pushes the ‘machineId’ and username to the C2 server, along\nwith the ‘configId’ (RC4 key).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: Initial POST Request\n\nThe RC4 key is used to decrypt the location of the C2 server, in this case 104.193.255.48\n(AS14576 - HOSTING SOLUTIONS).\n\nFigure 15: Decrypted C2 Server\n\nUnfortunately the C2 was offline at the time of our investigation, so we were not able to\nretrieve the full configuration of the malware.\n\nCluster 3\n\nThe third cluster is connected to credit and debit card skimming activity, with the earliest\nobservations occurring in November 2021.\n\n[A campaign associated with this cluster was previously reported on by the Sucuri research](https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/11/woocommerce-skimmer-spoofs-checkout-page.html)\nteam, which noted:\n\nCompromise of the victim website, with an attempt to load a malicious JavaScript file.\n\nWebsite visitors met with an unwarranted prompt for credit card information.\n\nSpoofing of the legitimate domain ‘api.jquery.com’; the attackers used a similar domain\n‘apiujquery[.]com’.\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 server used to serve the secondary payload, allowing for JavaScript injections into\npages when certain keywords were triggered, e.g., ‘checkout’, ‘my-account’, ‘order’.\n\nC2 server located at 51.178.8.230 (AS16276 - OVH).\n\nAt some stage after the publication of this blog, the C2 server was moved to 185.215.113.5.\n\nFigure 16: Current Campaign C2 Details\n\nBased on our threat telemetry for 185.215.113.5, we have observed at least 50 unique\nvictims connecting to the C2 server over the past three months.\n\nReviewing the current campaign, it appears very similar to the one reported on nearly a year\nago. The first JavaScript injection payload sends a unique hash to the C2 to register and\nidentify the victim on the admin side.\n\nHowever, some updates to the second stage payload have been noted. Firstly, the ‘triggered\nwords’ list has been updated to include several more keywords.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: Triggered Words List\n\nSecondly, an additional C2 server was identified, hosted on 185.215.113.20. Both the initial\nand the ‘new’ C2 server share the same SSH Server Host Key value.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18: SSH Server Host Key Match\n\nThe current IOCs for this campaign are therefore as follows:\n\napiujquery[.]com | 185.215.113.5\n\nC2: http://apiujquery[.]com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery-3.12.0.min.js?i\n\napigstatic[.]com | 185.215.113.20\n\nC2: https://apigstatic[.]com/ajax/libs/jquery/5.1.7/jquery-7.41.3.min.js?i\n\n## Big Picture\n\nBig Picture - Summary of Infrastructure\n\nZooming out from the clusters already discussed, a significant number of IPs within the\n**185.215.113.0/24 netblock have been linked to malicious activity in the recent past. With**\n110~ IPs categorized as malicious within VirusTotal over the past 90 days, and 80~ IPs\n[associated with entries made to ThreatFox within the past year.](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19: Malicious Activity Cluster within AS51381\n\nBig Picture - AS Details\n\nELITETEAM have been highlighted in the past by other researchers, identifying them as\n[malicious / BPH providers. To quote Spamhaus in their botnet report from 2021](https://www.spamhaus.org/news/images/botnet-report-2021-q2/spamhaus-botnet-report-2021-q2.pdf)\n“[ELITETEAM] is a bulletproof hosting company purporting to be located in Seychelles. In\nreality they more than likely operate out of Russia ”\n\n\n-----\n\nIn late 2020, when the ASs were first allocated to ELITETEAM, they were initially declared as\nRussian before being updated to reflect their status as Seychellois, as is the case today.\n\nFigure 20: ASN Description Information for AS51381 and AS60424\n\nDigging deeper into the details surrounding the ASs assigned to ELITETEAM, looking at\ninformation such as netblock announcements and peering, we were able to establish further\nties to Russia.\n\nFigure 21: ELITETEAM Peers\n\nIndeed, all ASs connected to the ELITETEAM infrastructure are owned by Russian entities:\n\nAS3555 | Crex Fex Pex Internet System Solutions LLC | Announcing AS51381 until\nJanuary 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nAS203804 | AS Infolika | Peer until February 2021\n\n[Details of the above activity have been disclosed previously by Valery Reiss-Marchive when](https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252496222/Ransomware-apercu-de-la-nebuleuse-de-linfrastructure-dEgregor)\ndiscussing the Egregor ransomware.\n\nAS213254 | OOO RAIT TELECOM | Peer until August 2022\n\nAS49612 | DDOS-GUARD LTD | Current peer as of September 2022\n\nAS3175 | Filanco LLC | Owned by Datahouse.ru, another Russian BPH provider for\nwhich ELITETEAM is an upstream peer\n\nAS213254 (OOO RAIT TELECOM) was seized by US law enforcement (ICE - Homeland\nSecurity Investigations) in early September 2022 and is currently no longer visible on the\nrouting table.\n\nFigure 22: US Law Enforcement Takedown of AS213254\n\nIt is possible that at some stage in the chain the operators were aware of the law\nenforcement action, as there was a migration observed in August 2022, where for a period\nboth AS213254 and AS49612 were observed as peers for AS51381.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs outlined throughout this blog, ELITETEAM enables malicious activity on a significant\nscale, allowing threat actors to operate with impunity against global targets, who in some\ncases appear to be individuals with surplus funds with which to invest or experiment with\ndigital currencies, and in others just your average Joe Public. We have observed varying\ncampaigns and TTPs, indicating diverse usage of ELITETEAM’s services by threat actors of\nvarying skill sets. It is not often sound advice to say, ”block all connections to a /24”, but in\nrespect of the infrastructure assigned to ELITETEAM, overwhelming evidence compels us to\nsuggest this to be the case.\n\nAll the data and information we have researched points to ELITETEAM being Russian /\nRussian-speaking, operating behind a shell organization in Seychelles. We have reason to\nbelieve that Datahouse, RU is connected to ELITETEAM and worthy of further investigation.\n\nFigure 23: Obi Wan Kenobi Encountering ELITETEAM\n\n## IOCs\n\n\n-----\n\nNetblock:\n\n​185.215.113[.]0/24\n\nAmadey C2s on 2022/09/21:\n\n​185.215.113[.]15\n\n185.215.113[.]92\n\n185.215.113[.]204\n\n185.215.113[.]35\n\n185.215.113[.]114\n\n185.215.113[.]205\n\nPhishing IPs:\n\n​185.215.113[.]100\n\n185.215.113[.]201\n\n185.215.113[.]206\n\nPhishing domains:\n\n\n-----\n\n​agricole-sms[.]org\n\nermac[.]icu\n\nbonus-agricole[.]pl\n\nreleyfi-login.comebien[.]app\n\nreleyfi-login.flipflop[.]app\n\nrelayfi-login.zenquickcash[.]net\n\nscipost-xmeta[.]org\n\ngeekgirlacademy[.]com\n\nicepapers[.]com\n\nhoamelgar[.]com\n\nwilliamsaraujo[.]com\n\nzspacelab[.]net\n\ncv19alert[.]com\n\nSkimmer IPs:\n\n​185.215.113[.]5\n\n185.215.113[.]20\n\nSkimmer domains:\n\n​apiujquery[.]com\n\napigstatic[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nFile sharing websites used to drop payloads:\n\n​uploadgram[.]me\n\nmediafire[.]com\n\npu-file[.]com\n\nhero-files[.]com\n\nRedLine Stealer payloads:\n\n​00580a4220102211f07bb54041d6f49c6995b86948fbfaf98c720e7fdfd4214c\n\n0258c677f58e13433e8aea350caa1f4643ce4fe24be6d28278915176572af3ca\n\n02b0b5d59068e9f00daa7ee2d4c3027e902c32038868f5de00b710ab7c7e9182\n\n016da58a917c5aad423db3c50cc75e351e62926c0e0c8e00a5c1de0ec6fc84af\n\n00649bad6081d82108bbde63efaab243b0d5f5f95dc99f9c46fa5ecd74c584b4\n\n02f1627f1a3e2f8531e2217ed28e420b717355ef15ca42bd9734b356f2bb2285\n\n76f4e8c50ece719c504376db8e131a8afcf8307e21ec864439452ac66f1da7ff\n\n09de0dca1123d58508f85013bfd94c764b9d0ba45bd556b7e5b9f81df471eed8\n\n3b4140faaa3828375888ca2ff1152fdf46529175ee49931ad8a20f52e0cdb058\n\n13f672297f1efe6a3eb73b8d3d7f2fa89117feef14a61054ccbde74a07ae2ef0\n\n4f3d55a6d73b630dfae91b89f98643462862a2b0264867752b802d0c1a8729e4\n\nAmadey payloads:\n\n\n-----\n\n​e49833410fea53f166523cc960fc7d60ddfcf60d0fc2024e68dbabab27ce8313\n\n232a7888f79f09c47258df130cbf4e854c7a5e0af0a534e5d918bbe7b4a9cd5a\n\n53463b214577f4ea17e629a8516b21584ceaef323880a7660b2ec6015a0da617\n\n7bc6a9edc592553dcb9250d70816f511d43a998f95f4e0b2a347dc2b66f897c4\n\nb9fa703b80c7d124148f64ae3474f1f2b01a42cd1ed6871be2bb6c9d15ecf871\n\n134ed27da9f9e727a3e6b4c551655d93f4e18969836ae94f0d59ddae09bbd0d1\n\nf6740bc4e0f17e6642dcb7343e768b0ff357c4b62508de0db21553014c3fb231\n\n## Detection mechanisms\n\nIDS Rules:\n\nMALWARE-CNC Win.Trojan.Redline variant outbound request detected\n\nET DROP Spamhaus DROP Listed Traffic Inbound group 22\n\nET DROP Spamhaus DROP Listed Traffic Inbound group 21\n\nET MALWARE Amadey CnC Check-In\n\nET INFO Executable Retrieved With Minimal HTTP Headers - Potential Second Stage\nDownload\n\nMALWARE-CNC Win.Trojan.Amadey botnet outbound connection\n\nOther Considerations:\n\nMonitor external assets and endpoints for connections to the netblock assigned to\nELITETEAM, in addition to the phishing and C2 IPs provided above.\n\n\n-----",
