While Bazar appeared to drop-off in December, new campaigns have sprung\nup recently, using similar TTP’s.\n\nIn this case, we will describe how the threat actor went from a DocuSign themed, malicious\ndocument, to domain wide compromise, using Bazar aka KEGTAP and Cobalt Strike.\n\n### Case Summary\n\nThis investigation began as many do, with a malicious document delivered via email. The\nemail and accompanying Excel file purported to be a DocuSign request, which entices the\nuser to enable macros. This lead to Bazar being dropped on the system, which created a run\nkey for persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the first day, after the initial activity, nothing else was seen. On the second day, we\nobserved DNS requests to .bazar domain names (the hallmark of the Bazar malware family).\nThe malware also executed some basic nltest domain discovery, and a short ping to a Cobalt\nStrike server, but no additional activity was observed.\n\nOn the third day, more communication was observed between the Bazar and Cobalt Strike\ninfrastructure, but again, no downloads or follow-on activity was observed.\n\nOn the fourth day, Bazar pulled down a Cobalt Strike Beacon in the form of a DLL, which\nwas executed via rundll32 and injected into various system processes. One of those\nprocesses injected into, was dllhost, which then ran various PowerSploit commands for\ndiscovery activity and dumped credentials from lsass. Shortly thereafter, the threat actors\nbegan moving laterally using multiple techniques, such as:\n\nPass the Hash\n\nSMB executable transfer and exec\n\nRDP\n\nRemote service execution\n\nThe threat actors then continued pivoting and collecting more information about the\nenvironment. About an hour after beginning their lateral movement, they had compromised a\ndomain controller. On that domain controller, they executed AdFind, and then dropped a\ncustom PowerShell script named Get-DataInfo.ps1. This script looks for all active machines\nand queries installed software, i.e., backup software, security software, etc. We first saw this\nscript about a year ago when threat actors deployed Ryuk ransomware across a domain.\nOther [public data has also linked this TTP to Ryuk threat actors.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/IR-quarterly-threat-report-spring-2020.html)\n\nHowever, in this case, about 15 minutes after running the script, the threat actor dropped\ntheir access and left the environment. We do not know what caused them to leave, but we\nhave some ideas. Based on the TTP’s of this intrusion, we assess, with medium to high\nconfidence, that Ryuk would have been the likely ransomware deployed. Total time in the\nenvironment was around 4 days.\n\n_[We recently started offering intel feeds based on different command and control](https://thedfirreport.com/services/)_\n_infrastructure such as Cobalt Strike, Qbot, Trickbot, PoshC2, PS Empire, etc. and this feed_\n_would have alerted on the Cobalt Strike C2 in this case.

The embedded macro\nin the file was using an Excel 4.0 macro, which at time of execution had a detection rate of\n[1/63 in Virustotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/571c32689719ba00f0d60918ae70a8edc185435ce3201413c75da1dbd269f88c/detection)\n\nUpon execution of the macro the file reached out to:\n```\nhttps://juiceandfilm[.]com/salman/qqum.php\n\n```\nAs seen in the contents of the macro below:\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom there a file was written:\n```\nC:\\Users\\USER\\Downloads\\ResizeFormToFit.exe\n\n```\nFrom here the executable then proceeds to create a new file and execute it via cmd.\n\nFour days post initial access, a Cobalt Strike Beacon was executed via rundll32 and cmd.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Persistence\n\n\n-----\n\nImmediately following the execution of M1E1626.exe, a persistence mechanism was created\nfor the file using a run key. This file was found to be a [BazarBackdoor sample.](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/d362c83e5a6701f9ae70c16063d743ea9fe6983d0c2b9aa2c2accf2d8ba5cb38)\n\n### Privilege Escalation\n\nThe use of the Cobalt Strike’s piped privilege escalation (Get-System) was used several\ntimes during the intrusion.\n```\ncmd.exe /c echo a3fed5b3a32 > \\\\.\\pipe\\3406c2\n\n### Defense Evasion\n\n```\nAfter loading the Cobalt Strike DLL, there was an almost instant injection by the process into\nthe Werfault process.\n\nWe also see the Cobalt Strike Beacon running in the dllhost.exe process, loading PowerShell\nto perform PowerSploit commands in the discovery section.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally via the use of YARA inspection we found Cobalt Strike running or injected into\nprocesses across the environment.\n```\nProcessName, Pid, Yara Rule, Host\n\"powershell.exe\",4008,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Endpoint2\"\n\"winlogon.exe\",532,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server1\"\n\"powershell.exe\",1340,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server1\"\n\"rundll32.exe\",564,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server8\"\n\"rundll32.exe\",3880,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server4\"\n\"powershell.exe\",2536,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server5\"\n\"rundll32.exe\",3580,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server6\"\n\"rundll32.exe\",3792,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server2\"\n\"rundll32.exe\",3708,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server3\"\n\"rundll32.exe\",3368,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server3\"\n\"rundll32.exe\",1700,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server10\"\n\"powershell.exe\",2692,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server7\"\n\"sihost.exe\",5064,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Endpoint1\"\n\"taskhostw.exe\",664,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Endpoint1\"\n\"explorer.exe\",5424,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Endpoint1\"\n\"rundll32.exe\",7692,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Endpoint1\"\n\"rundll32.exe\",2660,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"Server9\"\n\n### Credential Access\n\n```\nLsass was dumped using Cobalt Strike on multiple occasions. We were not able to recover\nany proof other than parent/child processes.\n\n### Discovery\n\nA day after initial access, Bazar initiated some discovery activity using Nltest:\n```\ncmd.exe /c nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\n\n```\nOn the forth day, a Cobalt Strike Beacon was executed and then the following discovery\ncommands were executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C net group enterprise admins /domain\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C net group \"domain admins\" /domain\n\n```\nOn the initial beachhead host, we also saw the Cobalt Strike Beacon initiate the following\nPowerShell discovery using Powersploit:\n```\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:35806/'); FindLocalAdminAccess\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:35585/'); GetNetComputer -ping -operatingsystem *server*\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:23163/'); GetNetSubnet\n\n```\nAfter beginning lateral movement, the threat actors used the following Window’s utilities for\nsystem profiling:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C systeminfo\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C ping HOST\n\n```\nOnce the threat actors had access to a domain controller, they ran the following PowerShell\ndiscovery:\n```\nRaw:\nSQBtAHAAbwByAHQALQBNAG8AZAB1AGwAZQAgAEEAYwB0AGkAdgBlAEQAaQByAGUAYwB0AG8AcgB5ADsAIABHAG\nDecoded:\nImport-Module ActiveDirectory; Get-ADComputer -Filter {enabled -eq $true} -properties\n*|select DNSHostName, IPv4Address, OperatingSystem, LastLogonDate\n\n```\nAfter running that, the threat actors used nltest again to confirm domain trusts:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\n\n```\nThe local time was also queried on the domain controller:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C time\n\n```\nAdFind was executed using adf.bat:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C C:\\Windows\\Temp\\adf\\adf.bat\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=person)\"\nadfind.exe -f \"objectcategory=computer\"\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)\"\nadfind.exe -sc trustdmp\nadfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=group)\"\nadfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp\n\n```\nFinally, the following collection of files were dropped on the domain controller:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\info\\7z.exe\nC:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\info\\comps.txt\nC:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\info\\Get-DataInfo.ps1\nC:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\info\\netscan.exe\nC:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\info\\start.bat\n\n```\nstart.bat was executed with the following:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c \"\"C:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\info\\start.bat\"\"\n\n```\nThis script contents show it to be a wrapper for the PowerShell script Get-DataInfo.ps1\n\nThe contents of Get-DataInfo.ps1 show a detailed information collector to provide the threat\nactor with very specific details of the environment. This includes things like disk size,\nconnectivity, antivirus software, and backup software. The Ryuk group has used this script\nfor at least a year as we’ve seen them use it multiple times.\n\n[This script and files are available @ https://thedfirreport.com/services/](https://thedfirreport.com/services/)\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\nThe threat actors deployed several types of lateral movements over the course of the\nintrusion.\n\nThe first observed method was the use of a remote service using PowerShell which injected\ninto winlogon.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors also leveraged SMB to send Cobalt Strike Beacon executables to $ADMIN\n[shares and again execute them on the remote systems via a service. SMB Beacon as its](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-smb-beacon)\ncalled in Cobalt Strike.\n\n\n-----\n\nPass the Hash was also used by the attackers while pivoting through the environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nRDP was also leveraged by the attacker via their Cobalt Strike Beacons.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Command and Control\n\n**Bazar:**\n\nCommunication over DNS to .bazar domains.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cobalt Strike:**\n```\n195.123.222.23\nJARM: 07d14d16d21d21d07c42d41d00041d24a458a375eef0c576d23a7bab9a9fb1\nJA3s: ae4edc6faf64d08308082ad26be60767, 649d6810e8392f63dc311eecb6b7098b\nJA3:\n72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea, 51c64c77e60f3980eea90869b68c58a8, 613e01474d42ebe48ef52dff6a20f079, 7dd50e\n112cd23734a310b90f6f44a7cd\nCertificate: [79:97:9a:e4:cb:ae:ae:32:d6:4a:e5:0e:f6:73:d0:69:e9:19:c1:54 ]\nNot Before: 2020/12/21 04:27:54\nNot After: 2021/12/21 04:27:54\nIssuer Org: jQuery\nSubject Common: jquery.com\nSubject Org: jQuery\nPublic Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n\n```\nBeacon Configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\nOther Observed Cobalt Strike IP’s:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n52.37.54.140\n52.90.110.55\n52.91.20.198\n54.151.74.109\n54.184.178.68\n54.193.45.225\n54.202.186.121\n208.100.26.238\nJA3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea\nJA3s: e35df3e00ca4ef31d42b34bebaa2f86e\n\n### Exfiltration\n\n```\nWe did not witness exfiltration in the clear during this case but we have recently become\naware of Ryuk threat actors exfiltrating information over the Cobalt Strike C2 channel.\n\n### Impact\n\nAfter finishing discovery, the threat actors disconnected from the network dropping both\nBazar and Cobalt Strike. We believe the next phase of this attack would have been domain\nwide ransomware.\n\n[Enjoy our report? Please consider donating $1 or more using Patreon.
