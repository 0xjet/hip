PIVY has been observed targeting a**\n**number of Asian countries for various purposes over the past year. Palo Alto Networks’ Unit**\n**[42 recently blogged about a new Poison Ivy variant targeting Hong Kong activists dubbed](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/04/unit42-new-poison-ivy-rat-variant-targets-hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists/)**\n**SPIVY that uses DLL sideloading and operates quite differently from a variant recently**\n**observed by ASERT that has been active for at least the past 12 months.**\n\n# T e c h n i c a l D e t a i l s\n\n**The PIVY variant that ASERT has observed has exhibited some newer behavior that we have**\n**not seen discussed previously. The samples drop a decoy doc – usually hinting clearly at the**\n**target, a DLL named ActiveUpdate.dll and the PIVY shellcode file as Active.dat. The�**\n**ActiveUpdate.dll and Active.dat files are created in a directory that follows the format�**\n**_ActiveUpdate_ [0-9]{3}. The executable copies rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe and then_**\n**executes the new file with the path to the DLL and installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk�**\n**in the Windows Startup folder. ESET identified these samples as “�Win32/Korplug.I[F-I]**\n**_variant“, possibly due to the appearance of the malware using DLL sideloading with rundll32_**\n**to load the dropped DLL and perform its malicious actions. This deployment tactic dates well**\n**into last year (and possibly before) using different executable names for the rundll32 copy and**\n**the base directory name, however this post will only cover a subset of the variant using**\n**“ActiveUpdate”.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Illustration of execution process of one PIVY Sample**\n\n**The compile times on these binaries also closely correlate to the times they were first�**\n**observed in-the-wild and some samples contained timestamp-like entities in the various**\n**campaign IDs fields in the malware configuration.�**\n\n**The decrypted configuration appears to be slightly modified in such a way as to confuse�**\n**some publicly available tools that parse the configuration data. The campaign ID is not fully�**\n**null-padded – there is now one null-byte and a string of repeating “x” characters that will**\n**cause confusion for some scripts. Additionally, the C2s are no longer null-padded – each**\n**hostname ends with a null-byte that is then followed by a string that will look something like**\n**“0.1127.0.0.1127.0.0.100000”. This string will change slightly with each Command & Control**\n**(C2) server – the portions that start with “1” will change to 2 for the second C2, 3 for the third,**\n**etc. These values end up being present elsewhere in memory without the extra items and only**\n**small tweaks are needed to fix the parsing.�**\n\n**The hostname webserver.servehttp[.]com is observed in a number of PIVY samples, some**\n**of which are covered in this post. Additionally, the IP resolved to by this hostname**\n**overlapped with fileshare.serveftp[.]com� which was used in an earlier and**\n**seemingly unrelated PIVY sample.**\n\n# D e c o y D o c u m e n t a n\n\n**A number of PIVY samples were observed to be targeting Myanmar and several other**\n**countries in Asia. While the exact targets and delivery methods are not known to ASERT at**\n**this time, the documents and submission sources provide strong hints as to the motivations**\n**and potential targets of these exploitation campaigns. The sample described in the previous**\n**section – a7d206791b1cdec616e9b18ae6fa1548ca96a321 – was observed to be targeting**\n\n\n-----\n\n**released on November 25, 2015 and it was first seen late evening in the US on November 24,�**\n**2015 which would equate to November 25 in Myanmar. The document was dropped as “STEP**\n**_Democracy Year 1 Acheivements_25112015.docx” and was also dropped by SHA1_**\n**724166261e9c2e7718be22b347671944a1e7fded with the name**\n**“Year1achievementsv2.docx“, but that sample uses a different communications password**\n**over the same set of C2s. The documents may be drafts of a final report released in�**\n**December by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), a**\n**part of the STEP Democracy initiative. The IDEA is “part of the European Union-funded**\n**project Support to Electoral Processes and Democracy (STEP Democracy)” whose goal is to**\n**support democracy worldwide. The IDEA has been working with Myanmar before and after**\n**their recent election to ensure “peaceful, transparent and credible elections.” Part of this work**\n**includes publishing reports and drafts such as those referenced above. In this case, the bait**\n**file document metadata contains a company name of “IDEA” with an author of “Sophia” –�**\n**possibly referencing a current member of the organization and a last edited date of November**\n**20, 2015. The content of the document details a debate around the democratic elections in**\n**Myanmar. This timeline would put the targeting past the elections that occurred in early**\n**November, but appears to still be focused on individuals interested in democracy inside of**\n**Myanmar. The targeting of the post-election Myanmar appears to be following the same style**\n**[as what was mentioned in the “Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger” paper by ASERT. In](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ASERT-Threat-Intelligence-Brief-2015-08-Uncovering-the-Seven-Point-Dagger.pdf)**\n**this case however it appears that threat actors began using references to the STEP**\n**organization to continue their likely spearphish tactic by leveraging content relevant to post-**\n**election Myanmar. A possible connection exists given that the C2 for these samples –**\n**jackhex.md5c[.]com – resolved to an IP contained within 103.240.203.0/22 as did a 9002**\n**RAT sample in the Seven Pointed Dagger exploitation campaign. A “LURK0” Gh0strat and**\n**another PIVY domain were also observed to have resolved to IPs contained within this range,**\n**making this subnet more suspicious from a targeted attack perspective.**\n\n**Dropped document referencing Myanmar’s democratic process**\n\n**A number of documents that appear to be economically focused were also observed recently**\n**and one of these samples also references Myanmar. This sample used a campaign ID of**\n**“mm20160405” and dropped a document named “Chairman’s Report of the 19th ASEAN**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Taw, Myanmar.doc that references an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)_**\n**meeting that took place in Myanmar in September of 2015. The timing of this sample is quite**\n**different from the earlier sample and seems to suggest at least a followup campaign due to**\n**the malware compilation timestamp of March 28, 2016, combined with an apparent timestamp**\n**value in the campaign ID of April 5, 2016 and the fact that the binary was first observed in the�**\n**wild on April 11, 2016. The mutex specified in the configuration – �20150120 – is the same**\n**mutex used in the earlier sample that dropped a document referencing the STEP program, but**\n**this mutex is also used in many other PIVY samples that use the “ActiveUpdate” directory**\n**structure and is likely not useful for identifying the campaign or a relationship between**\n**samples outside of possibly sharing a similar version. The C2 used in this sample –**\n**admin.nslookupdns[.]com – resolved to an IP contained in the subnet 118.193.218.0/24.**\n**Similar to the previous sample discussed, ASERT has observed an overlap between many**\n**other malware families including Nitol, Gh0strat, and another PIVY sample that**\n**uses “ActiveUpdate“. This sample’s C2 domain is news.tibetgroupworks[.]com which**\n**provides an obvious suggestion at targeting dynamics, however no decoy documents were**\n**dropped and no further information was discovered to help support the targeting hypothesis.**\n\n**Dropped document referencing ASEAN meeting in Myanmar**\n\n**Continuing on with the theme of campaigns targeting ASEAN, sample**\n**31756ccdbfe05d0a510d2dcf207fdef5287de285 drops a decoy document named “Robertus**\n**_Subono-REGISTRATION_FORM_ASEAN_CMCoord2016.docx” that references an ASEAN_**\n**Humanitarian Civil Military Coordination meeting that took place in Bangkok between March**\n\n\n-----\n\n**sample has a compilation date of March 10, 2016, was first observed by ASERT on March 20,�**\n**2016 and also contains an invalid digital signature claiming to be signed by Google. Coupling**\n**the campaign ID of “modth” with the purpose and location of the meeting and the email**\n**address this form is supposed to be mailed to, a possible target of this sample could be**\n**Thailand’s Ministry of Defense. The C2s used by this sample overlap with the prior sample**\n**that references the ASEAN meeting in Myanmar nearly perfectly – the first C2 uses port 80,�**\n**whereas the prior sample used 81 and they both use the same mutex and password. This**\n**overlap suggests a possible ongoing targeting towards ASEAN members and meetings that**\n**they hold.**\n\n**Decoy document dropped by 31756ccdbfe05d0a510d2dcf207fdef5287de285 referencing**\n**an ASEAN meeting in Thailand**\n\n**The decoy document “2016.02.29-03.04 -ASEM Weekly.docx” dropped by**\n**ec646c57f9ac5e56230a17aeca6523a4532ff472 was also interesting in that it was not in**\n\n**English like the other two observed documents – Google Translate identifies the language in�**\n**the document as Mongolian.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Decoy document references an Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) dropped**\n**by ec646c57f9ac5e56230a17aeca6523a4532ff472**\n\n**The decoy document 1.docx that is dropped by**\n**f389e1c970b2ca28112a30a8cfef1f3973fa82ea shows as corrupted when executed in**\n**a sandbox, but manual recovery yielded a document in Korean with a malware campaign ID**\n**of kk31. The document appears to reference Korean language schools abroad and the**\n**telephone number present yields an affiliation with the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but�**\n**the intended target is unclear at this time.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Korean language decoy document dropped by**\n\n**Sample f389e1c970b2ca28112a30a8cfef1f3973fa82ea dropped a decoy document named**\n**“Commission on Filipinos Overseas & Dubai.doc“, but this document did not render**\n**correctly in a malware sandbox or manually. VirusTotal revealed a sample from the Philippines**\n**which suggests that they, not Dubai / UAE, were the targets. The C2s for this sample**\n**used webserver.servehttp[.]com, also exhibited by many of the recent samples which**\n**suggests the same actor may be involved in this campaign activity.**\n\n# C o n c l u s i o n\n\n**As this post and other recent posts detail, PIVY continues to evolve and be used in a myriad**\n**of targeted exploitation campaigns – not unlike many other targeted malware families such as**\n**PlugX or the Dukes. This will certainly not be the last evolution of PIVY, and ASERT continues**\n**to monitor these threats as they are discovered.
