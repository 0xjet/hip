Over the years, this tool has become a part of the arsenal of several Chinese-related threat actors such as Tick,](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/tick)_ [Tonto Team](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/tonto_team)\n[and TA428, all of which employ RoyalRoad regularly for spear-phishing in targeted attacks against high-value targets.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/ta428)\n\n\n-----\n\ne a a y g e y d sco e ed oya oad sa p es obse ed t e d, t e octu us ea detected o e t at ot o y e b ts\nanomalous characteristics, but also delivers PortDoor _malware, a previously undocumented backdoor assessed to have been developed by a_\nthreat actor likely operating on behalf of Chinese state-sponsored interests.\n\n[According to the phishing lure content examined, the target of the attack was a general director working at the Rubin Design Bureau, a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_Design_Bureau)\nRussian-based defense contractor that designs nuclear submarines for the Russian Federation’s Navy.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n**RoyalRoad Variants are Under Development: The variant of the RoyalRoad weaponizer examined altered its encoded payload from**\nthe known “8.t” file to a new filename: “e.o”. More new variants are likely to be under development as well.\n**Previously Undocumented Backdoor: The newly discovered RoyalRoad RTF variant examined also drops a previously undocumented**\nand stealthy backdoor dubbed PortDoor which is designed with obfuscation and persistence in mind.\n**Highly Targeted Attack: The threat actor is specifically targeting the Rubin Design Bureau, a part of the Russian defense sector**\ndesigning submarines for the Russian Federation’s Navy.\n**Extensive Malware Capabilities: Portdoor has multiple functionalities, including the ability to do reconnaissance, target profiling,**\ndelivery of additional payloads, privilege escalation, process manipulation static detection antivirus evasion, one-byte XOR encryption,\nAES-encrypted data exfiltration and more.\n**APT Group Operating on Behalf of Chinese State Interests: The accumulated evidence such as the infection vector, social**\nengineering style, use of RoyalRoad against similar targets, and other similarities between the newly discovered backdoor sample and\nother known Chinese APT malware all bear the hallmarks of a threat actor operating on behalf of Chinese state-sponsored interests.\n\n### Analysis of the Spear-Phishing Attack: Intro to RoyalRoad\n\n[RoyalRoad is a tool that generates weaponized RTF documents that exploit the following vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.8t_dropper) [Equation Editor:](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/equation-editor-6eac7d71-3c74-437b-80d3-c7dea24fdf3f) CVE2017-11882, [CVE-2018-0798 and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0798) [CVE-2018-0802. RoyalRoad is used primarily by threat actors considered to be operating on behalf of](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0802)\n[Chinese state interests (e.g Tick,](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/tick) [Tonto Team,](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/tonto_team) [TA428,](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/ta428) [Goblin Panda,](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/hellsing) [Rancor).](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/rancor)\n\nRoyalRoad has rather consistent characteristics and most of the weaponized RTF documents usually drop an encoded file named “8.t”, which\n\n- once decoded - can deliver a variety of payloads for different threat actors.\n\nIn this report, we discuss a deviation from the “classic” RoyalRoad characteristics. The dropped object name was changed from the very\nconsistent “8.t” naming convention to the new “e.o” file name.\n\n### Spear-Phishing Email Delivers RoyalRoad RTF\n\nThe initial infection vector is a spear-phishing email addressed to the “respectful general director Igor Vladimirovich” at the Rubin Design\n[Bureau, a submarine design center from the “Gidropribor” concern in St. Petersburg, a national research center that designs underwater](https://www.gidropribor.ru/en/)\nweapons like submarines:\n\n_Content of the spear-phishing e-mail_\n\n\n-----\n\ne e a attac e t s a a c ous docu e t eapo ed t a oya oad pay oad, t co te t desc b g a ge e a e o a\n[autonomous underwater vehicle:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_underwater_vehicle)\n\n_Content of the weaponized RTF document_\n\nThe creation time of the RTF is timestomped to 2007, presumably to thwart investigation or detection efforts. [Timestomping is a known](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/)\n[technique used by threat actors to try and remain under the radar:](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/back-to-the-future-inside-the-kimsuky-kgh-spyware-suite)\n\n_Historical RTF data from VirusTotal_\n\n[Once the RTF document is opened and executed, a Microsoft Word add-in file is dropped to the Microsoft Word startup folder.

Its main capabilities include:\n\nGathering reconnaissance and profiling of the victim’s machine\n\nReceiving commands and downloading additional payloads from the C2 server\n\nCommunicating with the C2 server using raw socket as well as HTTP over port 443 with proxy authentication support\n\nPrivilege escalation and process manipulation\n\nDynamic API resolving for static detection evasion\n\nOne byte XOR encryption of sensitive data and configuration strings\n\nThe collected information is AES-encrypted before it is sent to the C2 server\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe DLL itself has multiple export functions, going from DllEntry00 to DllEntry33. Most of these exports simply return sleep loops, a likely antianalysis measure. The main functionality resides within the DllEntry28 and DllEntry18:\n\n\n-----\n\n_DLL exports of the PortDoor backdoor_\n\nIn order to get the configuration information, the backdoor first decrypts the strings using a hardcoded 0xfe XOR key:\n\n_Strings decryption routine_\n\nThe decrypted data includes the following configuration information:\n\n_The decrypted strings in memory_\n\n**Decrypted string** **Purpose**\n\n45.63.27[.]162 C2 address\n\nKr*^j4 N/A\n\nB-JDUN Victim identifier\n\n58097616.tmp Data file name written to %temp%\n\n0987654321fedcba AES-CBC key\n\nIt is worth noting that, during the analysis, the communication with the C2 was not successful and therefore some analysis information may be\nincomplete.\n\nFollowing the debugger presence check and the string decryption, the malware then creates an additional file in %temp% with the hardcoded\nname “58097616.tmp”, and writes the GetTickCount value multiplied by a random number to it:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Value written to the “58097616.tmp” file_\n\nThis can be used as an additional identifier for the target, and also as a placeholder for the previous presence of this malware.\n\nThe malware then proceeds to attempt to establish a connection with the C2 which supports the transfer of data using TCP over raw sockets,\nor HTTPS using the CONNECT method. In addition the backdoor appears to be proxy-aware, distinguishing between two HTTP response\ntypes: “200” response and “407” (Proxy Authentication Required):\n\n_Hardcoded HTTP headers with proxy support_\n\n[PortDoor also has the ability to achieve privilege escalation by applying the Access Token Theft technique to steal explorer.exe tokens and run](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001/)\nunder a privileged security context:\n\n_Access token theft from explorer.exe_\n\nEventually, the malware awaits for further instructions from the C2 to continue its execution. This is done via the following switch case:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Some of the switch case implemented methods_\n\nFor example, the get_pc_info() case gathers basic PC info to be sent to the C2, and the “B-JDUN” string is most likely being used as a unique\nidentifier for the campaign/victim:\n\n_The information gathered on the infected PC_\n\nLastly, before sending the information to the C2 server the backdoor uses AES to encrypt the stolen PC information data:\n\n_AES encrypted information gathered on the PC_\n\nThe backdoor’s main C2 command functionality is summarized in the table below:\n\n**Case** **Action**\n\n0x08 Get PC info, concat with the “B-JDUN\" identifier\n\n0x30 List running processes\n\n0x31 Open process\n\n0x41 Get free space in logical drives\n\n0x42 Files enumeration\n\n0x43 Delete file\n\n0x44 Move file\n\n0x45 Create process with a hidden window\n\n\n-----\n\n0x28 Open file for simultaneous operations\n\n0x29 Write to file\n\n0x2a Close handle\n\n0x2b Open file and write directly to disk\n\n0x01 Look for the “Kr*^j4” string\n\n0x10 Create pipe, copy data from it and AES encrypt\n\n0x11 Write data to file, append with “\\n”\n\n0x12 Write data to file, append with “exit\\n”\n\n_C2 command functionality summarized_\n\nAnother anti-analysis technique observed being used by the PortDoor backdoor is dynamic API resolving. The backdoor is able to hide most of\nits main functionality and avoid static detection of suspicious API calls by dynamically resolving its API calls instead of using static imports:\n\n_Dynamic API resolving_\n\n[The malicious execution of the PortDoor backdoor DLL is detected by the Cybereason Defense Platform:](https://www.cybereason.com/platform#graphic)\n\n_PortDoor Backdoor DLL as detected by Cybereason_\n\n### Attribution\n\nAt the time of this analysis, there was not enough information available to attribute the newly discovered backdoor to a known threat actor with\nreasonable certainty. However, there are a couple of known Chinese APT groups that share quite a few similarities with the threat actor behind\nthe new malware samples analyzed in this blog.\n\n[Based on previous work done by nao_sec, the Nocturnus Team was able to determine that the RTF file discussed in this blog was weaponized](https://nao-sec.org/2020/01/an-overhead-view-of-the-royal-road.html)\nwith RoyalRoad v7, which bears the indicative “b0747746” header encoding and was previously observed being used by the Tonto Team,\nTA428 and Rancor threat actors, as can be seen below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_RoyalRoad attribution matrix. Credit: nao_sec_\n\nBoth the Tonto Team and TA428 threat actors have been observed attacking Russian organizations in the past, and more specifically attacking\nresearch and defense related targets. For example, it was previously reported that Tonto Team is known to have attacked Russian\norganizations in the past using the [Bisonal malware.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/03/bisonal-10-years-of-play.html)\n\nWhen comparing the spear-phishing email and malicious documents in these attacks with previously examined phishing emails and lure\ndocuments used by the Tonto Team to attack Russian organizations, there are certain similarities in the linguistic and visual style used by the\nattackers in the phishing emails and documents.\n\nThe newly discovered backdoor does not seem to share significant code similarities with previously known malware used by the\nabovementioned groups, other than anecdotal similarities that are quite common to backdoors, leading us to the conclusion that it is not a\nvariant of a known malware, but is in fact novel malware that was developed recently.\n\nLastly, we are also aware that there could be other groups, known or yet unknown, that could be behind the attack and the development of the\nPortDoor backdoor. We hope that as time goes by, and with more evidence gathered, the attribution could be more concrete.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRoyalRoad has been one of the most used RTF weaponizers in the Chinese threat actors sphere in recent years. It is mostly observed in the\ninitial compromise phase of targeted attacks where spear-phishing is used to lure victims into opening malicious documents which in turn\nexploit Microsoft Equation Editor vulnerabilities to drop different malware.\n\nIn this report, we discussed the latest changes that were made to the RoyalRoad weaponizer that deviate from some of its well-documented\nand predictable indicators. It is perhaps an indication that the threat actors who are operating it are attempting to avoid “low hanging fruit”\ndetections.\n\nIn addition, we reported the discovery of the novel PortDoor backdoor, a previously undocumented and stealthy tool designed to grant the\nattackers access to their targets’ machines, collect information, and deploy additional payloads.\n\nAt the time of writing this report, it is still unclear which threat actor is behind the new backdoor, however we have identified two potential\nsuspects that fit the profile. Currently there is not enough information available to prove the stated hypothesis with a high level of certainty.\n\n**LOOKING FOR THE IOCs?
