Proofpoint has tracked this threat actor since 2017, and it has used consistent tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) in that time. Entities in the targeted sectors should be\naware of the actor's TTPs and use the information provided for hunting and detection.\n\nTA2541 uses themes related to aviation, transportation, and travel. When Proofpoint first\nstarted tracking this actor, the group sent macro-laden Microsoft Word attachments that\ndownloaded the RAT payload. The group pivoted, and now they more frequently send\nmessages with links to cloud services such as Google Drive hosting the payload. Proofpoint\nassesses TA2541 is a cybercriminal threat actor due to its use of specific commodity\n[malware, broad targeting with high volume messages, and command and control](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\ninfrastructure.\n\nWhile public reporting detailing similar threat activities exists since at least 2019, this is the\nfirst time Proofpoint is sharing comprehensive details linking public and private data under\none threat activity cluster we call TA2541.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Campaign Details \n\nUnlike many cybercrime threat actors distributing commodity malware, TA2541 does not\n[typically use current events, trending topics, or news items in its social engineering lures. In](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/social-engineering)\nnearly all observed campaigns, TA2541 uses lure themes that include transportation related\nterms such as flight, aircraft, fuel, yacht, charter, etc.\n\n_Figure 1: Email lure requesting information on aircraft parts._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Email lure requesting ambulatory flight information._\n\nTA2541 demonstrates persistent and ongoing threat activity since January 2017. Typically, its\nmalware campaigns include hundreds to thousands of messages, although it is rare to see\nTA2541 send more than 10,000 messages at one time. Campaigns impact hundreds of\norganizations globally, with recurring targets in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.\nMessages are nearly always in English.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, TA2541 briefly pivoted to adopting COVID-related lure themes\nconsistent with their overall theme of cargo and flight details. For example, they distributed\nlures associated with cargo shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE) or COVID-19\ntesting kits.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: PPE themed lure used by TA2541._\n\nThe adoption of COVID-19 themes was brief, and the threat actor quickly returned to generic\ncargo, flight, charter, etc. themed lures.\n\nMultiple researchers have published data on similar activities since 2019 including Cisco\nTalos, [Morphisec,](https://blog.morphisec.com/revealing-the-snip3-crypter-a-highly-evasive-rat-loader) [Microsoft,](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1392219299696152578) [Mandiant, and independent researchers. Proofpoint can confirm](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/dissecting-netwire-phishing-campaigns-usage-process-hollowing)\nthe activities in these reports overlap with the threat actor tracked as TA2541.\n\n## Delivery and Installation\n\nIn recent campaigns, Proofpoint observed this group using Google Drive URLs in emails that\nlead to an obfuscated Visual Basic Script (VBS) file. If executed, PowerShell pulls an\nexecutable from a text file hosted on various platforms such as Pastetext, Sharetext, and\nGitHub. The threat actor executes PowerShell into various Windows processes and queries\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for security products such as antivirus and\nfirewall software, and attempts to disable built-in security protections. The threat actor will\ncollect system information before downloading the RAT on the host.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Example attack chain._\n\nWhile TA2541 consistently uses Google Drive, and occasionally OneDrive, to host the\nmalicious VBS files, beginning in late 2021, Proofpoint observed this group begin using\nDiscordApp URLs linking to a compressed file which led to either AgentTesla or Imminent\nMonitor. Discord is an increasingly popular content delivery network (CDN) used by threat\nactors.\n\nAlthough TA2541 typically uses URLs as part of the delivery, Proofpoint has also observed\nthis actor leverage attachments in emails. For example, the threat actor may send\ncompressed executables such as RAR attachments with an embedded executable\ncontaining URL to CDNs hosting the malware payload.\n\nListed below is an example of a VBS file used in a recent campaign leveraging the\nStrReverse function and PowerShell’s RemoteSigned functionality. It is worth noting the VBS\nfiles are usually named to stay consistent with the overall email themes: fight, aircraft, fuel,\nyacht, charter, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Contents of a sample VBS file._\n\n**Deobfuscated command:**\n\nhttps://paste[.]ee/r/01f2w/0\n\nThe figure below depicts an example from a recent campaign where the PowerShell code is\nhosted on the paste.ee URL.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Paste URL example._\n\n**Persistence:**\n\nTypically, TA2541 will use Visual Basic Script (VBS) files to establish persistence with one of\ntheir favorite payloads, AsyncRAT. This is accomplished by adding the VBS file in the startup\ndirectory which points to a PowerShell script. Note: the VBS and PowerShell file names used\nare mostly named to mimic Windows or system functionality. Examples from recent\ncampaigns include:\n\n**Persistence Example:**\n\nC:\\Users[User]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\nMenu\\Programs\\Startup\\SystemFramework64Bits.vbs\n\n**Contents of VBS file:**\n\nSet Obj = CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")\n\nObj.Run \"PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -File \" & \"C:\\Users\\\n\n[User]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RemoteFramework64.ps1\", 0\n\nOther Recent VBS File Names Observed\n\nUserInterfaceLogin.vbs\n\nHandlerUpdate64Bits.vbs\n\n\n-----\n\nWindowsCrashReportFix.vbs\n\nSystemHardDrive.vbs\n\nTA2541 has also established persistence by creating scheduled tasks and adding entries in\nthe registry. For instance, in November 2021 TA2541 distributed the payload Imminent\nMonitor using both of these methods. In recent campaigns, vjw0rm and STRRAT also\nleveraged task creation and adding entries to the registry. For example:\n\n**Scheduled Task:**\n\nschtasks.exe /Create /TN \"Updates\\BQVIiVtepLtz\" /XML C:\\Users\\\n\n[User]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp7CF8.tmp\n\nschtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn Skype /tr \"C:\\Users\\\n\n[Use]\\AppData\\Roaming\\xubntzl.txt\"\n\n**Registry:**\n\nKey: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\svchost\n\nData: C:\\Users[User]\\AppData\\Roaming\\server\\server.exe\n\nKey: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\xubntzl\n\nData: C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\xubntzl.txt\n\n## Malware\n\nProofpoint has observed TA2541 using over a dozen different malware payloads since 2017.\nThe threat actor uses commodity malware available for purchase on criminal forums or\navailable in open-source repositories. Currently, TA2541 prefers AsyncRAT, but other popular\nRATs include NetWire, WSH RAT and Parallax.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Malware used by TA2541 associated with message volume._\n\nAll the malware used by TA2541 can be used for information gathering purposes and to gain\nremote control of an infected machine. At this time, Proofpoint does not know what the threat\nactor’s ultimate goals and objectives are once it achieves initial compromise.\n\nWhile AsyncRAT is the current malware of choice, TA2541 has varied its malware use each\nyear since 2017. The threat actor will typically use just one or a handful of RATs in observed\ncampaigns, however in 2020, Proofpoint observed TA2541 distributing over 10 different\ntypes of malware, all using the same initial infection chain.\n\n_Figure 8: Distribution of TA2541 malware over time._\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nTA2541 uses Virtual Private Servers as part of their email sending infrastructure and\nfrequently uses Dynamic DNS (DDNS) for C2 infrastructure.\n\nThere are multiple patterns across the C2 infrastructure and the message artifacts. For\nexample, historic campaigns have included the term “kimjoy” in the C2 domain name as well\nas in the threat actor reply-to address. Another striking TTP is the common pattern observed\nwith TA2541 C2 domains and payload staging URLs containing the keywords “kimjoy,”\n“h0pe,” and “grace”. TA2541 also regularly uses the same domain registrars including\nNetdorm and No-IP DDNS, and hosting providers including xTom GmbH and Danilenko,\nArtyom.\n\n## Victimology\n\nOften, campaigns contained several hundred to several thousand email messages to dozens\nof different organizations. Although Proofpoint has observed TA2541 targeting thousands of\norganizations, multiple entities across aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing,\nand defense industries appear regularly as targets of its campaigns. There appears to be a\nwide distribution across recipients, indicating TA2541 does not target people with specific\nroles and functions.\n\n## Conclusion \n\nTA2541 remains a consistent, active cybercrime threat, especially to entities in its most\nfrequently targeted sectors. Proofpoint assesses with high confidence this threat actor will\ncontinue using the same TTPs observed in historic activity with minimal change to its lure\nthemes, delivery, and installation. It is likely TA2541 will continue using AsyncRAT and\nvjw0rm in future campaigns and will likely use other commodity malware to support its\nobjectives.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n**C2 Domains**\n\n**Indicator** **Description** **Date Observed**\n\njoelthomas[.]linkpc[.]net AsyncRAT C2 Domain Throughout 2021\n\nrick63[.]publicvm[.]com AsyncRAT C2 Domain January 2022\n\ntq744[.]publicvm[.]com AsyncRAT C2 Domain January 2022\n\nbodmas01[.]zapto[.]org AsyncRAT C2 Domain January 2022\n\n\n-----\n\nbigdips0n[.]publicvm[.]com AsyncRAT C2 Domain December 2021\n\n6001dc[.]ddns[.]net AsyncRAT C2 Domain September 2021\n\nkimjoy[.]ddns[.]net Revenge RAT C2 Domain March 2021\n\nh0pe[.]ddns[.]net AsyncRAT C2 Domain April/May 2021\n\ne29rava[.]ddns[.]net AsyncRAT C2 Domain June 2021\n\nakconsult[.]ddns[.]net AsyncRAT C2 Domain July 2021\n\ngrace5321[.]publicvm[.]com StrRAT C2 Domain January 2022\n\ngrace5321[.]publicvm[.]com Imminent Monitor C2 Domain November 2021\n\n**VBS SHA256 Hashes**\n\nVBS SHA256 hashes observed in recent December and January campaigns.\n\nFile Name: Aircrafts PN#_ALT PN#_Desc_&_Qty Details.vbs\n\nSHA256: 67250d5e5cb42df505b278e53ae346e7573ba60a06c3daac7ec05f853100e61c\n\nFile Name: charters details.pdf.vbs\n\nSHA256: ebd7809cacae62bc94dfb8077868f53d53beb0614766213d48f4385ed09c73a6\n\nFile Name: charters details.pdf.vbs\n\nSHA256: 4717ee69d28306254b1affa7efc0a50c481c3930025e75366ce93c99505ded96\n\nFile Name: 4Pax Trip Details.pdf.vbs\n\nSHA256: d793f37eb89310ddfc6d0337598c316db0eccda4d30e34143c768235594a169c\n\n**ET Signatures**\n\n2034978 - ET POLICY Pastebin-style Service (paste .ee) in TLS SNI\n\n2034979 - ET HUNTING Powershell Request for paste .ee Page\n\n2034980 - ET MALWARE Powershell with Decimal Encoded RUNPE Downloaded\n\n\n-----\n\n2850933 - ETPRO HUNTING Double Extension VBS Download from Google Drive\n2850934 - ETPRO HUNTING Double Extension PIF Download from Google Drive\n2850936 - ETPRO HUNTING VBS Download from Google Drive\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
