This new activity appears to be a\ncontinuation of previously reported campaigns that have targeted entities associated with diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the\nChinese Communist Party, as well as entities in Myanmar. The targeting of organizations conducting diplomacy in Africa has also been\nobserved. Proofpoint researchers have identified updates to the actor’s toolset which is used to deliver PlugX malware payloads. Specifically,\nresearchers identified a new Golang variant of TA416’s PlugX malware loader and identified consistent usage of PlugX malware in targeted\ncampaigns. As this group continues to be publicly reported on by security researchers, they exemplify a persistence in the modification of their\ntoolset to frustrate analysis and evade detection. While baseline changes to their payloads do not greatly increase the difficulty of attributing\nTA416 campaigns, they do make automated detection and execution of malware components independent from the infection chain more\nchallenging for researchers. This may represent efforts by the group to continue their pursuit of espionage objectives while maintaining an\nembattled toolset and staying out of the daily Twitter conversation popular amongst threat researchers.\n\n## Renewed Phishing Activity\n\nAfter nearly a month of inactivity following publications by threat researchers, Proofpoint analysts have identified limited signs of renewed\n[phishing activity that can be attributed to the Chinese APT group TA416 (also referred to as Mustang Panda and RedDelta) . Recorded Future1](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/phishing)\nresearchers have previously noted historic periods of dormancy following disclosure of TA416’s targeted campaigns. This most recent period2\nof inactivity encompassed September 16, 2020 through October 10, 2020. Notably this time period included the Chinese National holiday\nreferred to as National Day and the following unofficial vacation period “Golden Week”. The resumption of phishing activity by TA416 included\n[a continued use of social engineering lures referencing the provisional agreement recently renewed between the Vatican Holy See and the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/cybersecurity-101-what-social-engineering)\nChinese Communist Party “CCP”. Additionally, spoofed email header from fields were observed that appear to imitate journalists from3\nthe Union of Catholic Asia News. This confluence of themed social engineering content suggests a continued focus on matters pertaining to\nthe evolving relationship between the Catholic Church and the “CCP”.\n\n## PlugX Malware Analysis\n\nProofpoint researchers identified two RAR archives which serve as PlugX malware droppers. One of these files was found to be a selfextracting RAR archive. For the purposes of this analysis the self-extracting archive file\nAdobelmdyU.exe|930b7a798e3279b7460e30ce2f3a2deccbc252f3ca213cb022f5b7e6a25a0867 was examined. The initial delivery vector for\nthese RAR archives could not be identified. However, historically TA416 has been observed including Google Drive and Dropbox URLs within\nphishing emails that deliver archives containing PlugX malware and related components. Once the RAR archive is extracted four files are\ninstalled on the host and the portable executable Adobelm.exe is executed. The installed files include:\n\nAdobelm.exe|0459e62c5444896d5be404c559c834ba455fa5cae1689c70fc8c61bc15468681\n\nA legitimate Adobe executable used in the DLL Side-Loading of Hex.dll.\n\nAdobehelp.exe|e3e3c28f7a96906e6c30f56e8e6b013e42b5113967d6fb054c32885501dfd1b7\n\nAn unused binary that has been previously observed in malicious RAR archives linked to TA416.\n\nhex.dll|235752f22f1a21e18e0833fc26e1cdb4834a56ee53ec7acb8a402129329c0cdd\n\nA Golang binary which decrypts and loads adobeupdate.dat (the PlugX payload).\n\nadobeupdate.dat|afa06df5a2c33dc0bdf80bbe09dade421b3e8b5990a56246e0d7053d5668d91\n\nThe encrypted PlugX malware payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: PlugX Malware Execution Diagram_\n\nFollowing RAR extraction, Adobelm.exe, a legitimate PE that is used for the DLL side-loading of hex.dll, is executed. It calls a PE export\nfunction of hex.dll named CEFProcessForkHandlerEx. Historically, TA416 campaigns have used the file name hex.dll and the same PE export\nname to achieve DLL side-loading for a Microsoft Windows PE DLL. These files served as loaders and decryptors of encrypted PlugX malware\npayloads. The file would read, load, decrypt, and execute the PlugX malware payload (regularly named adobeupdate.dat, as it is in this case).\n\nThe PlugX malware loader found in this case was identified as a Golang binary. Proofpoint has not previously observed this file type in use by\nTA416. Both identified RAR archives were found to drop the same encrypted PlugX malware file and Golang loader samples. The Golang\nloader has a compilation creation time that dates it to June 24, 2020. However, the command and control infrastructure discussed later in this\nposting suggests that the PlugX malware payload and Golang loader variant were used after August 24, 2020. Despite the file type of\nthe PlugX loader changing, the functionality remains largely the same. It reads the file adobeupdate.dat, retrieves the XOR key beginning at\noffset x00 and continues until it reads a null byte. It then decrypts the payload, and finally executes the decrypted adobeupdate.dat. This\nresults in the execution of the PlugX malware payload which ultimately calls out to the command and control IP 45.248.87[.]162. The following\nregistry key is also created during this process which runs at startup establishing the malware’s persistence. Notably the sample uses the\ndistinct file installation directory “AdobelmdyU”.\n\n**Registry Key** **Data**\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\AdobelmdyU \"C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\Adobelm\n402\n\n_Figure 2: PlugX malware Registry Key established for malware persistence._\n\n## Consistent TA416 Tools\n\nThe PlugX malware payload, unlike the Golang loader variant, seems to remain consistent when compared with previous versions.\n\nHistorical analysis conducted by Avira and Recorded Future has documented that the encrypted PlugX payloads, which have been\ndisguised as data and gif files, are in fact encrypted PE DLL files. These encrypted files contain a hardcoded XOR decryption key that\nbegins at offset x00 and continues until a null byte is read. In this case the Golang Binary PlugX loader reads the encryption key in the4\nsame manner from x00 to null byte, with the hardcoded key ending at offset x09. This represents continued usage of an anti-analysis\nmethod which makes the execution of PlugX payloads more complex and complicates the detection of command and\n[control infrastructure which the malware communicates with.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\n\n**Hardcoded Decryption Key / Byte Sequence**\n\n66 59 50 6C 79 73 43 46 6C 6B\n\n\n-----\n\n_gu e 3_ _ug_ _a_ _a e_ _O_ _dec ypt o_ _ey_\n\n_Figure 4: PlugX malware byte sequence and hardcoded XOR decryption key._\n\nFollowing decryption, the resulting file reflects a valid PE header for the PlugX malware payload. Shellcode appears between the MZ\nheader and the DOS message. The function of this shellcode is to write the PE DLL into RWX memory and begin execution at the\nbeginning of the file. This establishes an entry point for the payload and prevents an entry point not found error when executing the\nmalware. This is a common technique observed by many malware families and is not exclusive to TA416 PlugX variants. This shellcode\nis unlikely to appear in legitimate software DLLs.\n\n_Figure 5: PlugX malware byte sequence and XOR decryption key._\n\n## Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nThe command and control communication observed by these PlugX malware samples are consistent with previously documented versions.\nThe C2 traffic was successfully detected by an existing Proofpoint Emerging Threats Suricata signature for PlugX malware which is publicly\navailable as part of the ET OPEN public ruleset. The following IP and example command and control communication URLs were identified: 5\n\n45.248.87[.]162\n\nhxxp://45.248.87[.]162/756d1598\n\nhxxp://45.248.87[.]162/9f86852b\n\nFurther research regarding the command and control IP indicated that it was hosted by the Chinese Internet Service Provider Anchnet Asia\nLimited. It appeared to be active and in use as a command and control server from at least August 24, 2020 through September 28, 2020. It is\nnotable that this time period predates the period of dormancy discussed above that likely resulted from Recorded Future’s publication on\nTA416 activity. Additionally, it indicates that this server ceased being used during this dormancy period possibly indicating an infrastructure\noverhaul by actors during this time.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: RiskIQ data indicating TA416 command and control server’s period of activity._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nContinued activity by TA416 demonstrates a persistent adversary making incremental changes to documented toolsets so that they can remain\neffective in carrying out espionage campaigns against global targets. The introduction of a Golang PlugX loader alongside continued\nencryption efforts for PlugX payloads suggest that the group may be conscious of increased detection for their tools and it demonstrates\nadaptation in response to publications regarding their campaigns. These tool adjustments combined with recurrent command and control\ninfrastructure revision suggests that TA416 will persist in their targeting of diplomatic and religious organizations. While the specifics of the\ntools and procedures have evolved it appears their motivation and targeted sectors likely remain consistent. TA416 continues to embody the\npersistent aspect of “APT” actors and Proofpoint analysts expect to continue to detect this activity in the coming months.\n\n## IOCs\n\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n930b7a798e3279b7460e30ce2f3a2deccbc252f3ca213cb022f5b7e6a25a0867 SHA256 AdobelmdyU.exe                           RA\nArchive Containing PlugX\n\n6a5b0cfdaf402e94f892f66a0f53e347d427be4105ab22c1a9f259238c272b60 SHA256 Adobel.exe\nExtracting RAR Archive Containing PlugX\n\n0459e62c5444896d5be404c559c834ba455fa5cae1689c70fc8c61bc15468681 SHA256 Adobelm.exe                           Legiti\nPE that loads Golang PlugX Loader\n\n235752f22f1a21e18e0833fc26e1cdb4834a56ee53ec7acb8a402129329c0cdd SHA256 hex.dll\nGolang binary PlugX Loader\n\ne3e3c28f7a96906e6c30f56e8e6b013e42b5113967d6fb054c32885501dfd1b7 SHA256 AdobeHelp.exe                             U\nPE File\n\nafa06df5a2c33dc0bdf80bbe09dade421b3e8b5990a56246e0d7053d5668d917 SHA256 adobeupdate.dat\nEncrypted PlugX Payload\n\n45.248.87[.]162 C2 IP Command and control IP\n\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\n\n\\Microsoft\\ Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\AdobelmdyU\n\n**Emerging Threats Signatures**\n\n2018228 - et trojan possible plugx common header struct\n\nReferences:\n\n\nRegKey Registry Key that establishes PlugX malware persist\n\n\n1 [Chinese State-Sponsored Group ‘RedDelta’ Targets the Vatican and Catholic Organizations](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations/)\n\n2 [Back Despite Disruption: RedDelta Resumes Operations](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations/)\n\n\n-----\n\no y See a d C a e e [o s o a](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2020-10/holy-see-china-provisional-agreement-renew-appointment-bishops.html) g ee e t o yea s\n\n4 [New wave of PlugX targets Hong Kong](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/new-wave-of-plugx-targets-hong-kong)\n\n\n5 [Emerging Threats Ruleset](https://doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/2018228)\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
