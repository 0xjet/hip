    "plain_text": "## Taking Advantage of PE Metadata, or How To Complete Your Favorite Threat Actor’s Sample Collection\n\n###### Daniel Lunghi (@thehellu)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Outline\n\n#### • Introduction\n • Malware analysis and classification\n • Pivoting\n\n##### • Filenames\n • Imphash\n • RICH header\n • Stolen certificates\n • TLSH\n\n#### • Conclusion\n\n\n\n#### • Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction\n\n#### • This talk focuses on the methodology of sample pivoting\n\n • Examples are based on a real case investigation published on\n April 09, 2021 in the Trend Micro blog\n Iron Tiger APT Updates Toolkit With Evolved SysUpdate Malware\n • Goal:\n\n • Find more samples/IOCs of a particular malware\n family/threat actor\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction\n\n#### • Investigation started in December 2020, after Talent-Jump\n technologies brought an unknown sample to us\n\n • Sample was found in the same gambling company that was\n targeted during Operation DRBControl\n\n • At the time, we found links to 3 different threat actors\n\n\n-----\n\n# Malware analysis and classification\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware analysis and classification\n\n#### • 4 files:\n\n###### • dlpumgr32.exe: legitimate signed file, part of the DESlock+ product\n • DLPPREM32.DLL: malicious side-loaded DLL file loading DLPPREM32.bin\n • DLPPREM32.bin: shellcode decompressing and loading a “launcher”\n • data.res: encrypted file containing the final payload, decoded by the “launcher”\n\n##### After analysis, a fifth file is involved, config.res. It contains the C&C\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware analysis and classification\n\n#### • The unpacked code can be dumped from memory\n\n • We look for patterns to identify the malware family\n\n##### • Uncommon strings/constants\n • Noteworthy encryption/obfuscation algorithm\n\n####  There is a hardcoded user-agent which is listed in a Dell\n Secureworks blogpost\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware analysis and classification\n\n#### • The blogpost mentions multiple tools from the BRONZE\n UNION (Iron Tiger) threat actor\n\n • SysUpdate is mentioned, and as far as we know, exclusive to\n the Iron Tiger threat actor\n\n • We found a detailed description of SysUpdate in a NCC\n group blogpost that matches the behavior of the “launcher”\n\n\n-----\n\n# Pivoting\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting filenames\n\n#### • Two loading scenarios found in previous blogs\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting filenames\n\n#### • Search engines\n\n##### • Few sandbox results, but the hashes were already known\n\n#### • Malware repositories (Virus Total and internal)\n\n##### • 8 results, of which 7 were not listed in the two mentioned reports\n\n#### • Searching those new samples lead to two additional reports:\n\n##### • One published by AE.CERT on June 13[th], 2019\n • One published by Iranian private company on March 2020  History of previous targets (Iran, UAE)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting filenames\n\n#### • New loading scenarios/filenames in those reports\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting filenames\n\n#### • Pivoting on DLL filenames is trickier\n\n##### • Filenames are used by legitimate files\n • The same legitimate executables can be abused by multiple threat\n actors\n\n#### • Filtering on metadata such as file size reduces the number of\n results\n\n##### • “name:PYTHON33.DLL”: 129 results\n • “name:PYTHON33.dll size:100Kb-”: 6 results (3 FP)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting filenames\n\n#### • New filenames lead to additional reports from multiple\n companies or even researchers\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting imphash\n\n#### • “Import hashing”, or imphash, is a method disclosed by\n Mandiant/FireEye in 2014\n • It relies on the Import Address Table (IAT), which is built by\n the linker at compilation time\n • The IAT will be different depending on\n\n##### • The order in which the functions are called in the source code\n • The order in which the source files are parsed by the linker\n\n#### • The output of the imphash algorithm is an MD5 hash\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting imphash\n\n#### • Virus Total and Malware Bazaar provide a search keyword:\n\n##### • imphash: <imphash value>\n\n#### • Yara has a function to calculate it in the “pe” module:\n\n##### • pe.imphash() == <imphash value>\n\n#### • There is a stand-alone Python implementation\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting imphash\n\n#### • PYTHON33.DLL file from Iranian report has imphash\n 509a3352028077367321fbf20f39f6d9\n\n • Virus Total returns 3 files with such imphash\n\n##### • 2 files are named “GameuxInstallHelper.dll”\n\n#### • There may be false positives, especially for small files\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting RICH header\n\n#### • Metadata inserted in PE files by Microsoft compilers, first\n documented in 2010\n\n • Contains information on the building environment (Product\n ID, version, count)\n\n • XORed with a key which is a checksum of some headers\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting RICH header\n\n#### • Two files with a similar RICH header may be generated in the\n same build environment\n\n • By searching for similar RICH headers, we might find\n additional samples from the same threat actor\n\n • Simplest approach for pivoting is to calculate a MD5 hash of\n the unxored RICH header\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting RICH header\n\n#### • Virus Total has a search modifier for this\n\n##### • rich_pe_header_hash:<RICH header’s MD5>\n\n#### • For other platforms, a Yara rule can be used for this\n\n##### • hash.md5(pe.rich_signature.clear_data) == <RICH header’s MD5>\n\n#### • Or you can use a stand-alone Python implementation\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting RICH header\n\n#### • inicore_v2.3.30.dll from Palo Alto’s blogpost has RICH\n header’s hash 5503d2d1e505a487cbc37b6ed423081f\n\n • Virus Total returns 3 results for this hash\n\n##### • 2 files are named “GameuxInstallHelper.dll”\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting RICH header\n\n#### • The RICH header is not needed for proper code execution\n\n##### • It can be removed, modified, copied, forged…\n\n#### • Famous example of false flag involving RICH header in 2018\n\n##### • The RICH header from a sample attributed to Lazarus group was\n copied to a sample from the Olympic Destroyer campaign\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting Stolen certificates\n\n#### • PE files can be signed via the Authenticode technology\n\n • It identifies the publisher of the file, and guarantee that the\n code has not been tampered\n\n • It relies on certificates, managed by certification authorities\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting Stolen certificates\n\n#### • Private keys are sometimes stolen, allowing threat actors to\n sign malicious code\n\n • Certification authorities revoke the certificate once notified\n\n • Searching for all executables signed by a stolen certificate is a\n good pivot\n\n##### • Keep in mind that all results are not malicious\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting Stolen certificates\n\n#### • Virus Total has a search keyword:\n\n##### • signature: <any metadata in the certificate, thumbprint, serial, CN\n field…>\n\n#### • Malware Bazaar has a two search keywords:\n\n##### • serial_number: <certificate’ serial number>\n • issuer_cn: <certificate’s issuer>\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting Stolen certificates\n\n#### • Yara can parse certificates in the “pe” module:\n\n##### for any i in (0 .. pe.number_of_signatures): (\n\n###### pe.signatures[i].serial == <certificate’s serial number in low case> or pe.signatures[i].thumbprint == <certificate’s thumbprint in low case>\n##### )\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting Stolen certificates\n\n#### • inicore_v2.3.30.dll from Palo Alto’s blogpost is signed by a\n “Kepware Technologies” certificate\n\n • Virus Total returns 9 results with this serial number\n\n##### • All are related to Iron Tiger\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting TLSH\n\n#### • TLSH is a “fuzzy hashing” algorithm\n\n##### • Split the input in blocks of variable length and makes a hash out of it\n\n#### • Output is a 72-character long hash\n\n • Mixed results, although better than with other fuzzy hashing\n algorithms\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting TLSH\n\n#### • Virus Total and Malware Bazaar provide a search keyword:\n\n##### • tlsh: <TLSH value>\n\n#### • Yara does not have a way to calculate this hash\n\n • The code is open source and can be applied to a local\n malware repository\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pivoting TLSH\n\n#### • Wsocks32.dll from Dell SecureWorks blogpost has TLSH\n\n###### T112F21A0172A28477E1AE2A3424B592725D7F7C416AF040CB3F9916FA9FB16D0DA3C367\n\n##### • More than 200 results, some of them are related, most are not\n\n#### • PYTHON33.dll from Palo Alto blogpost has TLSH\n\n###### T17A634B327C97D8B7E1D97AB858A2DA12152F250059F588C9BF7043E70F2A6509E37F0E\n\n##### • 3 related results in Virus Total, one named “GameuxInstallHelper.dll”\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion Results\n\n#### • Started from one sample found in 2020…\n • …ended with 38 unpacked SysUpdate samples\n\n • The oldest one has a compilation timestamp of March 2015,\n some of them were uploaded in 2016\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion Takeaways\n\n#### • Many techniques enable malware sample correlation\n\n • These techniques have flaws (collisions, based on forgeable\n fields), but are still useful\n\n • Threat actors make mistakes, they improve, and so does the\n threat intelligence field\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion Takeaways\n\n#### • Confrontation with other sources (infrastructure, TTPs,\n political agenda) is mandatory to avoid false flags\n\n##### • Everyone does mistakes. Acknowledge and fix them and you will be\n fine\n\n#### • Sharing is caring, public research reports are useful if they\n contain enough actionable information\n\n\n-----\n\nAutomated hybrid cloud workload protection via calls to\nTrend Micro APIs.
