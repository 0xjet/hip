LockerGoga Straddles the Line\n\n**blog.talosintelligence.com/lockergoga/**\n\nNick Biasini March 20, 2019\n\nBy [Nick Biasini](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/author/nick-biasini/)\n\nWednesday, March 20, 2019 14:03\n\n[ransomware](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/ransomware/)\n\n## Executive Summary Ransomware attacks have been in the news with increased frequency over the past few years. This type of malware can be extremely disruptive and even cause operational impacts in critical systems that may be infected. LockerGoga is yet another example of this sort of malware. It is a ransomware variant that, while lacking in sophistication, can still cause extensive damage when leveraged against organizations or individuals. Cisco Talos has also seen wiper malware impersonate ransomware, such as the NotPetya attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nEarlier versions of LockerGoga leverage an encryption process to remove the victim s ability\nto access files and other data that may be stored on infected systems. A ransom note is\nthen presented to the victim that demands the victim pay the attacker in Bitcoin in exchange\nfor keys that may be used to decrypt the data that LockerGoga has impacted. Some of the\nlater versions of LockerGoga, while still employing the same encryption, have also been\nobserved forcibly logging the victim off of the infected systems and removing their ability to\nlog back in to the system following the encryption process. The consequence is that in\nmany cases, the victim may not even be able to view the ransom note, let alone attempt to\ncomply with any ransom demands. These later versions of LockerGoga could then be\ndescribed as destructive.\n\nWhile the initial infection vector associated with LockerGoga is currently unknown, attackers\ncan use a wide variety of techniques to gain network access, including exploiting unpatched\nvulnerabilities and phishing user credentials. Expanding initial access into widespread\ncontrol of the network is facilitated by similar techniques with stolen user credentials being\nan especially lucrative vector to facilitate lateral movement. For example, the actors behind\nthe SamSam [attacks leveraged vulnerable servers exposed to the internet as their means](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/samsam-ransomware)\nof obtaining initial access to environments they were targeting.\n\n## LockerGoga Details Several of the LockerGoga samples observed in the wild appear to have been signed using a certificate that was issued to ALISA LTD by Sectigo:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis was likely an attempt by the malware author to minimize anti-malware detection, as\nexecutables that are signed using valid certificates may not be analyzed as rigorously as\nexecutables with no signature verification. The certificate has since been revoked by the\nissuer.\n\nDuring the infection process, the LockerGoga executable is copied to the %TEMP%\ndirectory on the victim system and executed.\n\nTalos has also observed versions of the LockerGoga ransomware that attempt to clear the\nWindows Event Logs using the following command syntax:\n\nThe ransomware then creates the ransom note and begins the encryption process.\nLockerGoga supports many of the common types of files that organizations typically use to\nstore important data. As files are encrypted, the originals are deleted and replaced with the\nencrypted data, which is stored as files with the \"*.LOCKED\" file extension. Unlike many\nransomware variants commonly observed, LockerGoga also encrypts the contents of the\nvictim's Recycle Bin directory.\n\nOne other interesting aspect of the LockerGoga variant is that the files appear to be\nencrypted individually. When interacting with the sample, Talos observed commands being\nexecuted to encrypt each individual file, an example of which you can find below. This isn't\ncommonly done since it's inefficient and creates overhead.\n\n## LockerGoga Ransom Note Following a successful infection, the LockerGoga ransomware writes a ransom note to the victim's desktop as a text file called \"README_LOCKED.txt.\" Note that, in our research, we did find another campaign in January that was using a ransom note filename of \"README-NOW.txt.\" Opening the ransom note with Notepad reveals the following:\n\nInterestingly, unlike many of the more sophisticated ransomware variants seen in recent\nyears, the ransom note does not include instructions for using a payment portal to process\nthe ransom payment. It also does not include a Bitcoin or Monero wallet address and simply\nincludes instructions for contacting the malware distributor via two email addresses that are\nincluded in the note. Talos has observed different emails listed across various samples that\nwere analyzed.\n\nThere also does not appear to be a dedicated command and control (C2) structure set up to\nfacilitate remote connectivity with the attackers. The attackers are also offering to decrypt a\nsmall number of encrypted files for free as a way to further convince victims of the\n\n\n-----\n\nlegitimacy of the operation and maximize the likelihood that the victim will pay the ransom\ndemand. Additionally, Talos has observed no evidence to suggest that LockerGoga has the\nability to self propagate across hosts on a network where an infection has taken place.\n\n## Conclusion Data is a valuable resource on all of our systems, whether that data is user photos or corporate documents. Therefore, ransomware continues to be a significant threat because it enables an attacker to steal that valuable data and hold it for ransom. Talos has seen financially motivated cybercriminals using ransomware in an attempt to generate a profit while other adversaries have used ransomware as a cover (such as the Not Petya attack) to disrupt the operation of the network, and hide their tracks by making forensic analysis more difficult.\n\nBetween using active exploitation, sending a threat via email or over the web, or even using\nstolen or bought credentials the possibilities are virtually endless. This is where some of the\nbasic tenets of security come into play. Organizations increasingly need to have near realtime visibility into their endpoints in addition to the protective capabilities that products like\n[AMP provide. Additionally, having multi-factor authentication (MFA) like Duo, enabled on](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nsystems can help prevent initial infection or slow its spread by limiting lateral access.\nFollowing established best practices with regard to network architecture and proper network\nsegmentation can also help minimize operational disruption from threats such as\nransomware, wiper malware, etc. Talos will continue to monitor this threat to ensure that\ncustomers remain protected from any evolutions that will inevitably occur.\n\n_Note: This blog post discusses active research by Talos. This information should be_\n_considered preliminary and will be updated as research continues._\n\n## Coverage LockerGoga is currently detected by Cisco security products which can be used by organizations to protect their environments from this and other ransomware attacks.\n\nExample ThreatGrid Indicator Report:\n\n\n-----\n\nExample AMP Detection:\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection(AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](http://cs.co/reviewamp)\nmalware used by these threat actors.
