The attack, which mainly affected devices in\nEgypt and Latin America, where the specific routers were in widespread use, could have led\nto another major denial-of-service campaign, he said.\n\n\n-----\n\nInstead, security researchers worked with the two largest internet service providers (ISPs) in\nthe areas affected to block traffic to the server managing infected devices—known as a\ncommand-and-control (C2) server—and begin patching customers’ routers.\n\n“We were able to cooperate with the security research community very quickly, we got the\ncommand-and-control systems shut down very fast, and we pushed out notices to the two\nlargest ISPs who have those modems,” Drew said. “So the good news is—in very, very quick\norder—we were able to block scanning on our backbone.”\n\nThe quick reaction and shutdown of the botnet is significant because the Satori malware\nautomatically used any compromised router to scan and infect new systems, which qualifies\nthe code to be a worm, according to an analysis posted by Chinese security firm 360\n**Netlab on Dec. 5. The company stated that the scanning from the worm had “gotten more**\nintense” and noted the existence of the two exploits, one of which appeared to be a zero-day\nattack for a previously unknown vulnerability.\n\nFollowing the ISPs blocking the command-and-control traffic, 360 Netlab noticed that the\nscanning dropped off significantly.\n\n“[W]e observed the C2 sending kill scan command to the bots, and that explains why the\nscan activities on the two ports started to drop on a global scale,” the company wrote.\n\nMalware targeting vulnerabilities in the IoT will increasingly be a concern, said CenturyLink’s\nDrew, because a single vulnerability can be exploited globally.\n\n“Unlike any other device, a single exposure can be exploited across the entire vendor\nplatform,” he said. “With Windows devices, the attacker is hindered by how each individual\nperson has customized their environment.”\n\nWhile the Satori attacker can no longer connect to the compromised devices, the battle\nbetween malware authors and security researchers is not over, Drew said. The creator of the\nSatori malware has shown a quickness to adapt, so Drew warned that the similar attacks will\nlikely continue. Prior to Satori, the attacker created another Mirai variant that similarly\nexploited Huawei routers, but—taking a page from Mirai’s playbook—used brute-force\npassword guessing as another vector to exploit devices.\n\nYet, the system of information exchange and research collaboration worked well and holds\nout hope that such attacks in the future can be quickly blunted, Drew said.\n\n“This is one of the few times that we were able to make an event a non-event,” he said. “I’m\nvery proud of the collaborative effort.”\n\n\n-----",
