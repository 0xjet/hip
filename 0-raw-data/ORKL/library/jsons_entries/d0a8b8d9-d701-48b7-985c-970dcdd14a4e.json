Given the nature of the victim and the way they are targeted, we can draw some similarities to the Side\nCopy APT group.\n\nBoth APT groups are known to have mainly targeted India’s Defense and Government sectors in the past.\nAdditionally, both groups have used various other RAT and malware to launch campaigns via multiple modes such\nas phishing, delivering payload via mail, etc. The malware posted by the researcher on Twitter has used a\n[technique to hide the actual malware in the .vhdx file to avoid any antivirus detection. As per Wikipedia, .vhdx is the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHD_(file_format))\nsuccessor of VHD (Virtual Hard Disk).\n\nThe figure below shows the high-level execution flow of the malware. Upon execution, the malware checks for the\ncurrent time zone. If it is able to verify that the victim system’s time zone is in IST, it connects to the attacker’s URL\nfor downloading the second stager. Once downloaded, it executes the second stager payload and deletes itself.\n\nThe second stager payload checks that only one instance of the malware is running, and then it connects with the\nattacker’s Command and Control (C&C) server to start receiving the commands from Threat Actor (TA).\n\nFigure 1 High-Level Execution Flow of Malware\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nCyble Research started analysis with the malware file name AFD CSD APP.vhdx; the sample had an extension.\nvhdx. After double-clicking on the AFD CSD APP.vhdx we observed it creating a mount in the Operating System\n(OS) with the name “CSD App“. After opening the mounted drive, we got the malicious malware file which is\n_CSD_AppLaunch.exe._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 Actual Malware present in CSD APP Mount\nWhile performing a static analysis of the CSD_AppLaunch.exe malicious file, we determined that that the file is an\nx86 architecture Windows-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) Application written in .NET Language shown in the\nfigure below.\n\nFigure 3\n\nStatic Details of First Stager\nThe icon of the malicious app had the logo of the Canteen Store Department (CSD) of the Indian Armed Forces, as\nshown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 4 Application Logo Used for First Stager\n\n### Code Analysis (CSD_AppLaunch.exe)\n\nAs per the below code, once the malware has been executed, it checks whether the current OS time Zone is India\nStandard Time (IST); if the OS time is not in IST, the malware exits. This tells us that the malware has been created\nwith the explicit purpose of targeting the Indian Defense establishment and service members.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 Malware Checks for Time Zone\nInitially, the code shown below figure uses the .NET WebBrowser() class to open the URL h[tt]ps:\n\n_[//]afd.csdindia[.]gov[.]in and load the Form1_Load module to execute the malicious malware code._\n\nFigure 6 Malware Loading Indian CSD Website in Custom Browser and Execute Form1_Load\nOnce the Form1_Load method is called, the code shown in Figure 7 creates a directory in C:\\\\ProgramData as\n“Intel Wifi”. If this directory is not present, it will be created, Once the directory is present, the malware proceeds to\ndownload the next stager payload from URL https[:]//secure256[.]net/ver4.mp3. Then, the malware decrypts the\nver4.mp3 content to create IntelWifi.exe malicious binary in C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Intel Wifi as shown in the code below.\n\nFigure 7 Create Folder in ProgramData and Download Second Stager\nThe code below contains the decryption logic used by the malware to decrypt the content of ver4.mp3 file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 Decrypt Second Stager\nFinally, the first stager malware calls the Final method to create a new file name music.mp3 which contains the\ndecrypted data of ver4.mp3 in the C:\\\\ProgramData directory.\n\nAfter this step, it sleeps for 6 seconds and then uses the Move function to rename the music.mp3 file to\nIntelWifi.exe. It then sleeps for five more seconds and then executes IntelWifi.exe binary and delete\nCSD_AppLaunch.exe (first stager) binary as shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 9 Create Second Stager Binary IntelWifi.exe\n\n### Technical Analysis for IntelWifi.exe (Second Stager)\n\nStatic analysis of IntelWifi.exe tells that the binary is an x86 architecture Windows-based Graphical User Interface\n(GUI) application written in .NET language as shown in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10\n\nStatic Details of IntelWifi (Second Stager)\nAs per the below code, initially, the malware checks that only a single instance of a malware process is running.\nThen, it checks whether the current time zone is India Standard Time. Further, it calls CheckDirectory() method to\ncreate \\\\Intel Wifi directory and vmnx.dll file. Finally, it calls the Form1 module to execute the malicious codes.\n\nFigure 11 Second Stager Malware Performing Various Checks\nForm1() module calls IntializeComponent method, which in turn loads the Form1_Load method. The Form1_Load\nthen calls Run() method to start the malware activity as shown in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12 Execution Flow to Initiate the Malicious Activity\nThe Run code is shown in Figure 13. Once executed, it connects to the attacker’s C&C on address\n45[.]147[.]228[.]195[:]5434. After establishing contact with the C&C server, it calls the Run method from the Grabber\nclass to execute a series of methods to get the victim’s environment details, e.g., OS, current username, etc. Once\nthe victim’s environment details are extracted, the malware sends the details to the attacker’s C&C with key “x999”\nand then waits for commands to be received from the attacker.\n\nFigure 13 Malware Communicating to Attacker’s C&C and Waiting to receive the Command\nBelow we have listed a series of methods executed by the Run() method present in the Grabber class.\n\nFigure 14 Series of Methods Executed by Malware\n\n**Methods** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\nCreateID() Create vmvcx.dll file and Generate Victim ID based on processor detail and P-Followed by\nrandom number and write the ID is vmvcx.dll file. E.g., PXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nName() Get the Computer Name and Current Username\n\nPubIp() Get the Victim’s public IP using http://icanhazip[.]com\n\nLocIp() Get the Victim’s Local IP\n\nOSType() Get the Victim’s Operating System (OS) details\n\nAv() Get the AV’s List present in Victim’s Machine\n\nMacType() Check whether Victim’s is using desktop or Laptop\n\nCreateNonStop() Add persistence in Startup Folder\n\nTable 1 Methods Description Which Malware invokes\nThe below figure shows that the cynetcloud shortcut file is created in the startup folder using CreateNonStop()\n[method. The value file:///C:\\ProgramData\\Intel Wifi\\IntelWifi.exe executes whenever the Windows machine starts.](http://10.10.0.46/file:/C:/ProgramData/Intel%20Wifi/IntelWifi.exe)\nThis is done for the purpose of creating and maintaining persistence on the victim machine.\n\nFigure 15 Malware Created Persistent in Start-Up Folder\nOnce all the methods are executed, as shown in Table 1, the malware sends the user data to Attacker’s C&C. In the\nfigure below, the malware has connected to our fake emulated C&C.\n\nFigure 16 Malware Connected to Fake C&C\nOnce connected, the malware sends the victim’s environment details. The malware goes into a dormant stage to\nget the next command from the attacker’s C&C.\n\nFor example, in the below figure, we have sent “prc1” to the malware to get the process details of the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17 Output Received from malware\nBelow is the code used by the malware to handle the commands received from C&C.\n\nFigure 18 Various Functionalities which Malware Support basis on the Command Received from C&C\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe APT groups are evolving their tools and techniques to stay ahead of various security solutions like AV & EDR.\nBased on the fact that this malware has multiple artifacts such as the logo, the URL used in the initial code, we can\nconclude that the malware has been created specifically to target Indian Defense or Government officials.\n\nCyble Research Labs will continuously monitor security threats, whether they are ongoing or emerging.
