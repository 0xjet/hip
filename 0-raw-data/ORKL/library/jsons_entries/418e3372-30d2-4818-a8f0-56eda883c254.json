    "plain_text": "# A Hacker Tried to Poison a Florida City's Water Supply, Officials Say\n\n**wired.com/story/oldsmar-florida-water-utility-hack/**\n\nAndy Greenberg February 8, 2021\n\nAround 8 am on Friday morning, an employee of a water treatment plant in the 15,000person city of Oldsmar, Florida, noticed that his mouse cursor was moving strangely on his\ncomputer screen, out of his control, as local police would later tell it. Initially, he wasn't\nconcerned; the plant used the remote-access software TeamViewer to allow staff to share\nscreens and troubleshoot IT issues, and his boss often connected to his computer to monitor\nthe facility's systems.\n\nBut a few hours later, police say, the plant operator noticed his mouse moving out of his\ncontrol again. This time there would be no illusion of benign monitoring from a supervisor or\nIT person. The cursor began clicking through the water treatment plant's controls. Within\nseconds, the intruder was attempting to change the water supply's levels of sodium\nhydroxide, also known as lye or caustic soda, moving the setting from 100 parts per million to\n11,100 parts per million. In low concentrations the corrosive chemical regulates the PH level\nof potable water. At high levels, it severely damages any human tissue it touches.\n\nAccording to city officials, the operator quickly spotted the intrusion and returned the sodium\nhydroxide to normal levels. Even if he hadn't, the poisoned water would have taken 24 to 36\nhours to reach the city's population, and automated PH testing safeguards would have\ntriggered an alarm and caught the change before anyone was harmed, they say.\n\n\n-----\n\nDid this come from down the street or outside the country? No idea.\n\nBob Gualtieri, Pinellas County Sheriff\n\nBut if the events described by local officials are confirmed—they have yet to be corroborated\nfirsthand by external security auditors—they may well represent a rare publicly reported\ncyberintrusion aimed at actively sabotaging the systems that control a US city's critical\ninfrastructure. \"This is dangerous stuff,\" said Bob Gualtieri, the sheriff of Pinellas County,\nFlorida, of which Oldsmar is a part, in a press conference Monday afternoon. \"This is\nsomebody that is trying, it appears on the surface, to do something bad.\"\n\nIn a follow-up call with WIRED, Gualtieri said that the hacker appears to have compromised\nthe water treatment plant's TeamViewer software to gain remote access to the target\ncomputer, and that network logs confirm the operator's mouse takeover story. But the sheriff\nhad little else to share about how the hacker accessed TeamViewer or gained initial access\nto the plant's IT network. He also provided no details as to how the intruder broke into the socalled operational technology network that controls physical equipment in industrial control\nsystems and is typically segregated from the internet-connected IT network.\n\nGualteri said the city's own forensic investigators, as well as the FBI and Secret Service, are\nseeking those answers. \"That’s the million-dollar question, and it’s a point of concern,\nbecause we don’t know where the hole is and how sophisticated these people are,\" Gualteri\nsaid. \"Did this come from down the street or outside the country? No idea.\"\n\nSecurity professionals have long advised not only segregating IT and OT networks for\nmaximal security but also limiting or ideally eliminating all connections from operational\ntechnology systems to the internet. But Gualteri conceded that the plant's OT systems were\nexternally accessible, and that all evidence points to the attacker accessing them from the\ninternet. \"There is merit to the point that critical infrastructure components shouldn’t be\nconnected,\" Gualteri said. \"If you’re connected, you’re vulnerable.\"\n\nGualteri said that the water treatment facility had uninstalled TeamViewer since the attack,\nbut he couldn't otherwise comment on what other security measures the plant was taking to\nremove the intruder's access or prevent another breach. He added that officials have warned\nall government organizations in the wider Tampa Bay area to review their security protocols\nand make updates to protect themselves. \"We want to make sure that everyone realizes\nthese kind of bad actors are out there. It's happening,\" Oldmar mayor Eric Seidel said in a\npress conference. \"So really take a hard look at what you have in place.\"\n\nAs unprecedented as Oldmar's public announcement of a cybersabotage attempt on its\nwater systems may be, the attack it describes is hardly unique, says Lesley Carhart, a\nprincipal threat analyst at industrial control system security firm Dragos. She says she's seen\nincidents firsthand in which even unsophisticated hackers access software applications that\noffer control of physical equipment—such as the TeamViewer remote access tool reportedly\n\n\n-----\n\nused in Oldmar or the human-machine interfaces (HMIs) that directly control equipment—\nand start messing with them. Thousands of such systems are discoverable over the internet\nwith search tools like Shodan, she points out. It's often only the complexity and safeguards in\nindustrial control systems that prevent hacker meddling from having serious consequences.\n\n\"Do I think that on a regular basis people are logging in to HMI systems and hitting buttons?\nAbsolutely,\" says Carhart. \"Do those things have a measurable impact on the real world?\nVery rarely.\"\n\nCarhart points to a comparable incident—albeit one carried out by an insider rather than an\nexternal attacker—when a disgruntled IT consultant for a sewage treatment plant in the\nAustralian shire of Maroochy used his remote access to dump millions of gallons of raw\nsewage into local parks and rivers. On the other end of the sophistication spectrum, the\nRussian hacker group known as Sandworm in December 2015 hijacked a remote-access\nsoftware similar to the TeamViewer program used in Oldmar to open circuit breakers in\n[Ukrainian electric utilities, turning off the power to a quarter-million civilians. And there's an](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/)\n[even more direct precedent: In 2016, Verizon Security Solutions reported that hackers broke](https://www.wired.com/story/oldsmar-florida-water-utility-hack/In%202016,%20Verizon%20Security%20Solutions%20reported%20that%20hackers%20broke%20into%20an%20unidentified%20water%20utility%20and%20changed%20the%20chemical%20levels)\ninto an unidentified water utility and changed the chemical levels.\n\nWater treatment and sewage plants, Carhart says, are often some of the most digitally\nvulnerable critical infrastructure targets in the United States, made more so by the budget\ncuts and remote work scenarios imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic. She says she has dealt\nwith entire cities whose municipal water treatment plant has only a single IT person.\n\n\"They're doing whatever they have to to keep water flowing and sewage treated. If they don't\nhave the resources to do that and do cybersecurity, what are they going to do?\" she asks.\n\"They're going to keep the process running, keep society running. That's what they have to\ndo.\"\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: [Get our newsletters!](https://www.wired.com/newsletter?sourceCode=BottomStories)\n[There are spying eyes everywhere—now they share a brain](https://www.wired.com/story/there-are-spying-eyes-everywhere-and-now-they-share-a-brain/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_2&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n[Fleeing WhatsApp for better privacy?
