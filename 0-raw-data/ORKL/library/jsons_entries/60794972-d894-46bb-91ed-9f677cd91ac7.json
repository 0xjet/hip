The credentials are\nthen sent to a command-and-control (C&C server) that the attackers control.\n\nRed Alert 2.0 will block incoming calls from banks, presumably to block verification attempts.\nThe malware also intercepts SMS text messages, sending messages to the attackers for\nfuture use. By disrupting the device’s actual communication capabilities, the attackers can\nmaximize the time spent doing malicious activities.\n\nAccording to its researchers, Red Alert 2.0 is being peddled on hacking forums for $500—a\nlow price that could make it attractive to a large number of potential attackers.\n\nRed Alert 2.0 can target mobile devices that are running Android versions of up to 6.0, which\nwas released two years ago, but it is currently confined to third party app stores. No versions\nof the malicious apps carrying the malware have been detected on the official Google Play\nStore as of the time of publication.\n\nThis is not the first time that malware is being spread via third party app stores, as seen in\nlast year’s Fobus attack involving Super Mario Run. Users are advised to avoid third partyapp stores, as the lack of security regulations could expose them to malware. In addition,\nusers should also disable the “Allow installation of apps from unknown sources” as a further\n\n\n-----\n\nsecurity measure, and only enable it when they are sure of the legitimacy of the download\nsource. In general, Android users should be wary of whatever they download—whether from\nthird party app stores of even the official Google Play Store itself. If an app seems to be\nsuspicious, perhaps it is best to refrain from downloading it.\n\nHIDE\n\n**Like it? Add this infographic to your site:**\n1. Click on the box below.  2.
