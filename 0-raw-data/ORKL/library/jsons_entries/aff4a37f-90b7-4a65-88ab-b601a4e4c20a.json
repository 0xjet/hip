Similar to the commonly-used RDP, it is used to remotely access\nand control other systems.\n\nKimsuky group installs AppleSeed backdoor on the target system after the initial\ncompromise, then additionally installs VNC malware via AppleSeed to ultimately control the\ntarget system in a graphical environment. One of the VNC malware that is installed is\nTinyNuke.\n\n1. TinyNuke (HVNC)\n\nTinyNuke, also known as Nuclear Bot, is a banking malware discovered in 2016, and it\nincludes features such as HVNC (HiddenDesktop/VNC), reverse SOCKS4 proxy, and form\ngrabbing. Due to its source code revealed in 2017, TinyNuke is used by various attackers,\nand the HVNC, Reverse SOCKS4 Proxy features are partially borrowed by other malware\nsuch as AveMaria and BitRAT.\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong the various features of TinyNuke that are being distributed, only the HVNC feature is\nenabled. A difference between normal VNC and HVNC used by TinyNuke is that the user\ndoes not realize that the PC is infected and its screen is being controlled. The following\nshows the process tree when HVNC is enabled.\n\nFigure 1. Process tree upon using HVNC\n\nexplorer.exe (PID: 3140) is the child process of explorer.exe (PID: 2216), and is found in the\nprocess tree. The attacker is able to control the screen via the new explorer.exe (PID: 3140),\nand the GUI (Graphical user interface) of the process created while the attacker is controlling\nthe target PC is not visible on the target PC screen. This type of VNC remote access is\ncalled HVNC (Hidden Virtual Network Computing).\n\nAnother characteristic is that it uses the reverse VNC method. VNC consists of a server and\na client. It installs the VNC server on the control target system, and the user who wishes to\ncontrol the system remotely uses the VNC client. It gains control of the VNC client by going\nthrough the VNC server installed on the remote control target system.\n\nIn a normal VNC environment, it attempts to access the remote control target (VNC server)\nvia the VNC client. However, HVNC of TinyNuke attempts to access the client from the\nserver with the reverse VNC feature. This means that when HVNC of the infected system is\nrun, the awaiting attacker accesses the designated C&C server and uses the VNC client\n(server for HVNC) on the C&C server to gain remote control. It is assumed that this is to\nbypass firewalls such as Reverse Shell that blocks internal access from the outside and to\nsupport communication in a private IP environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n2. Attacker’s HVNC screen\nNote that TinyNuke uses “AVE_MARIA” string for verification when establishing HVNC\ncommunication between the server and the client. This means that when “AVE_MARIA”\nstring is sent from the HVNC client to the server, the server verifies the name, and HVNC\ncommunication can be enabled if “AVE_MARIA” is correct.\n\nFigure 3. AVE_MARIA string used in HVNC\nThis is identical to that of HVNC used by Kimsuky group, however, recently there have been\nHVNCs using “LIGHT’s BOMB” string.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. “LIGHT’S BOMB” string used in\n\nplace of AVE_MARIA\n**2. TightVNC (VNC)**\n\nAnother VNC malware distributed via AppleSeed backdoor is TightVNC. TightVNC is an\nopen-source VNC utility, and the attacker customizes it to use it. TightVNC can be regarded\nas a normal VNC utility, but it is different in that it supports the reverse VNC feature\ndiscussed earlier.\n\nTightVNC consists of tvnserver.exe, the server module, and tvnviewer.exe, the client module.\nIn a normal environment, it installs tvnserver on the remote control target and accesses the\ntarget using tvnviewer in the user environment. In order to use the reverse VNC feature, it\nruns tvnviewer as a listening mode on the client, then uses tvnserver that is installed as a\nservice on the access target system to set the client address using controlservice and\nconnect commands for access gain.\n\nKimsuky group distributes tvnserver, and it is customized so that the reverse VNC feature\ncan be used in the infected environment without installing a service. Simply running\ntvnserver will allow the attacker to access tvnviewer that operates on the C&C server and\ngain control of the screen of the infected system.\n\nFigure 5. Reverse VNC communication using tvnviewer\n**3. Conclusion**\n\n\n-----\n\n[As introduced in the previous blog post, Kimsuky group uses AppleSeed to install](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/26975/)\nMeterpreter, a different backdoor malware, and uses TinyNuke, TightVNC and RDP Wrapper\nfor screen control. There is also evidence of the use of Mimikatz for account info-stealing.\n\n**Feature** **Tool Name**\n\nRemote Control AppleSeed, Meterpreter\n\nScreen Control TinyNuke, TightVNC, RDP Wrapper\n\nAccount Info-stealing Powerkatz\n\nTable 1.
