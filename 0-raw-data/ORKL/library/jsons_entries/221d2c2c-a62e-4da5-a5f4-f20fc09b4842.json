    "plain_text": "# FIN7.5: the infamous cybercrime rig “FIN7” continues its activities\n\n**[securelist.com/fin7-5-the-infamous-cybercrime-rig-fin7-continues-its-activities/90703](https://securelist.com/fin7-5-the-infamous-cybercrime-rig-fin7-continues-its-activities/90703/)**\n\nBy Yury Namestnikov, Félix Aime on May 8, 2019. 10:00 am\n\nOn August 1, 2018, the US Department of Justice announced that it had arrested\nseveral individuals suspected of having ties to the FIN7 cybercrime rig. FIN7 operations\nare linked to numerous intrusion attempts having targeted hundreds of companies since\nat least as early as 2015. Interestingly, this threat actor created fake companies in order\nto hire remote pentesters, developers and interpreters to participate in their malicious\nbusiness. The main goal behind its malicious activities was to steal financial assets from\ncompanies, such as debit cards, or get access to financial data or computers of finance\ndepartment employees in order to conduct wire transfers to offshore accounts.\n\nIn 2018-2019, researchers of Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team\nanalyzed various campaigns that used the same Tactics Tools and Procedures (TTPs)\nas the historic FIN7, leading the researchers to believe that this threat actor had\nremained active despite the 2018 arrests. In addition, during the investigation, we\ndiscovered certain similarities to other attacker groups that seemed to share or copy the\nFIN7 TTPs in their own operations.\n\n## Recent FIN7 campaigns\n\nThe FIN7 intrusion set continued its tailored spear phishing campaigns throughout last\nyear. Kaspersky Lab has been able to retrieve some of these exchanges from a FIN7\ntarget. The spear phishing campaigns were remarkably sophisticated from a social\nengineering perspective. In various cases, the operators exchanged numerous\nmessages with their victims for weeks before sending their malicious documents. The\nemails were efficient social-engineering attempts that appealed to a vast number of\nhuman emotions (fear, stress, anger, etc.) to elicit a response from their victims. One of\nthe domains used by the attackers in their 2018 campaign of spear phishing contained\nmore than 130 email aliases, leading us to think that more than 130 companies had\nbeen targeted by the end of 2018.\n\n### Malicious Documents\n\nWe have seen two types of documents sent to victims in these spear phishing\ncampaigns. The first one exploits the INCLUDEPICTURE feature of Microsoft Word to\nget context information about the victim’s computer, and the availability and version\nnumber of Microsoft Word. The second one, which in many cases is an Office document\nprotected with a trivial password, such as “12345”, “1234”, etc., uses macros to execute\na GRIFFON implant on the target’s computer. In various cases, the associated macro\nalso scheduled tasks to make GRIFFON persistent.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, following some open-source publications about them, the FIN7 operators\nseems to have developed a homemade builder of malicious Office document using ideas\nfrom ThreadKit, which they employed during the summer of 2018. The new builder\ninserts random values in the Author and Company metadata fields. Moreover, the builder\nallows these to modify different IOCs, such as the filenames of wscript.exe or\nsctasks.exe copies, etc.\n\n**wscript.exe copy** **sctasks copy** **Task name** **C2**\n\n**byzNne10.exe** byzNne17.exe TaskbyzNne logitech-cdn.com\n\nc9FGG10.exe c9FGG17.exe Taskc9FGG logitech-cdn.com\n\n**zEsb10.exe** zEsb17.exe TaskzEsb servicebing-cdn.com\n\nIOCs extracted from docs which use sctasks for GRIFFON persistence\n\n**Author** **Company** **wscript.exe copy** **C2**\n\nmogjxjtvte mogjxjtvte mswmex44.exe logitech-cdn[.]com\n\nsoxvremvge soxvremvge c9FGG10.exe logitech-cdn[.]com\n\ngareljtjhvd gareljtjhvd zEsb10.exe servicebing-cdn[.]com\n\nIOCs extracted from regular documents associated to GRIFFON\n\n### GRIFFON Implant\n\n\n_Griffon Malware attack pattern_\n\n\nThe GRIFFON implant is a lightweight JScript validator-style implant without any\npersistence mechanism. The malware is designed for receiving modules to be executed\nin-memory and sending the results to C2s. We were able to obtain four different modules\n\n\n-----\n\nduring the investigation.\n\n#### Reconnaissance module\n\nThe first module downloaded by the GRIFFON malware to the victim’s computer is an\ninformation-gathering JScript, which allows the cybercriminals to understand the context\nof the infected workstation. This module mainly relies on WMI and Windows objects to\ndeliver results, which will be sent back to the operators. Interestingly, more than 20\nartifacts are retrieved from the system by this implant during the reconnaissance stage,\nfrom the date and time of operating system installation and membership in a Windows\ndomain to a list of and the resolutions of the workstation’s monitors.\n\n#### Meterpreter downloader\n\nThe second module is used by the operators to execute an obfuscated PowerShell\nscript, which contains a Meterpreter downloader widely known as “Tinymet“. This\ndownloader, seen in past FIN7 campaigns, downloads a one-byte XOR-encrypted (eg.\nwith the key equal to 0x50 or 0x51) piece of meterpreter shellcode to execute.\n\n#### Screenshot module\n\nThe third module allows the operators to take a screenshot of the remote system. To do\nthat, it also drops a PowerShell script on the workstation to execute. The script executes\nan open-source .NET class used for taking a screenshot. The resulting screenshot is\nsaved at “%TMP%/image.png”, sent back to the attackers by the GRIFFON implant and\nthen deleted.\n\n#### Persistence module\n\nThe last retrieved module is a persistence module. If the victim appears valuable to the\nattackers, a GRIFFON implant installer is pushed to the victim’s workstation. This\nmodule stores another instance of the GRIFFON implant inside the registry to achieve\npersistence. Here is a PowerLinks-style method used by the attackers to achieve\npersistence and execute the GRIFFON implant at each user logon. The new GRIFFON\nimplant is written to the hard drive before each execution, limiting the “file-less” aspect of\nthis method.\n\nThrough its light weight and modular architecture, the GRIFFON implant is the perfect\nvalidator. Even though we have been able to retrieve four different modules, it is possible\nthat the FIN7 operators have more modules in their toolsets for achieving their objectives\non the victim’s workstation.\n\n## On the hunt for GRIFFON infrastructure\n\nAttackers make mistakes, and FIN7 are no exception. The major error made by its\noperators allowed us to follow the command and control server of the GRIFFON implant\nlast year. In order to trick blue teams and other DFIR analysts, the operators created\nfake HTTP 302 redirection to various Google services on their C2s servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nServer: nginx\nDate: [retracted]\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: keep-alive\nLocation: https://cloud.google.com/cdn/\n\n\n**Returned headers for most of the GRIFFON C2s servers on port 443**\n\nThis error allowed us to follow the infrastructure week by week, until an individual\npushed on Twitter the heuristic to track their C2 at the end of December 2018. A few\ndays after the tweet, in January 2019, the operators changed their landing page in order\nto prevent this type of tracking against their infrastructure.\n\n### Fake pentest company\n\nDuring the investigation related to the GRIFFON infrastructure, we found a strange\noverlap between the WHOIS record of an old GRIFFON C2 and the website of a fake\ncompany.\n\nAccording to the website, that domain supposedly belongs to a legitimate security\ncompany “fully owned by the Russian Government” (sic.) and having offices in “Moscow,\nSaint Petersburg and Yekaterinburg”, but the address says the company is located in\nTrump Tower, in New York. Given FIN7’s previous use of false security companies, we\ndecided to look deeper into this one.\n\nAs we were looking at the content of the website, it became evident that almost all of the\ntext used was lifted from legitimate security-company websites. Phrases and sentences\nwere borrowed from at least the following companies/sites:\n\nDKSec – www.dksec.com\nOKIOK – www.okiok.com/services/tailored-solutions\nMainNerve – www.mainnerve.com\nDatics – www.datatics.com/cyber-security\nPerspective Risk – www.perspectiverisk.com\nSynack – https://www.synack.com/company\nFireEye – https://www.fireeye.com/services/penetration-testing.html\n\nThis company seems to have been used by the FIN7 threat actor to hire new people as\ntranslators, developers and pentesters. During our research, we found various job\nadvertisements associated with the company on freelance and remote-work websites.\n\nIn addition to that, various individuals have mentioned the company in their resumes. We\nbelieve that some of these individuals may not even be aware that they are working for a\ncybercrime business.\n\n## Links to other intrusion sets\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile tracking numerous threat actors on a daily basis during the final days of 2018 and\nat the beginning of 2019, we discovered various activity clusters sharing certain TTPs\nassociated with the FIN7 intrusion set. The link between these threat actors and FIN7 is\nstill weak, but we decided to disclose a few hints regarding these in this blog post.\n\n### CobaltGoblin/EmpireMonkey\n\nIn his history, FIN7 has overlapped several times with Cobalt/EmpireMonkey in terms of\nTTPs. This activity cluster, which Kaspersky Lab has followed for a few years, uses\nvarious implants for targeting mainly banks, and developers of banking and money\nprocessing software solutions. At the end of 2018, the cluster started to use not only\nCobaltStrike but also Powershell Empire in order to gain a foothold on the victims’\nnetworks. After a successful penetration, it uses its own backdoors and the CobaltStrike\nframework or Powershell Empire components to hop to interesting parts of the network,\nwhere it can monetize its access.\n\nFIN7’s last campaigns were targeting banks in Europe and Central America. This threat\nactor stole [suspected of stealing €13 million from Bank of Valetta, Malta earlier this year.](https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20190225/local/how-bov-hackers-got-away-with-13-million.702800)\n\n\nExample of malicious documents used in the end of 2018 to beginning of 2019\n\n\nA few interesting overlaps in recent FIN7 campaigns:\n\nBoth used macros to copy wscript.exe to another file, which began with “ms”\n(mses.exe – FIN7, msutil.exe – EmpireMonkey).\n\nBoth executed a JScript file named “error” in %TEMP% (Errors.txt in the case of\nFIN7, Errors.bat for EmpireMonkey).\nBoth used DocuSign decoy documents with different macros. The macros popped\nthe same “Document decryption error” error message—even if macro code remain\ntotally different.\n\nWe have a high level of confidence in a historic association between FIN7 and Cobalt,\neven though we believe that these two clusters of activity are operated by different\nteams.\n\n### AveMaria\n\n\n-----\n\nAveMaria is a new botnet, whose first version we found in September 2018, right after\nthe arrests of the FIN7 members. We have medium confidence that this botnet falls\nunder the FIN7 umbrella. In fact, AveMaria is a classic infostealer bot that collects all\npossible credentials from various types of software: browsers, email clients,\nmessengers, etc., and can act as a keylogger. Since the beginning of 2019, we have\ncollected more than 1300 samples and extracted more than 130 C2s.\n\nTo deliver their malware, the cyber criminals use spearphishing emails with various types\nof attachments: MS Office documents or spreadsheet files exploiting some known\nvulnerability like CVE-2017-11882, or documents with Ole2Link and SCT. They also use\nAutoIT droppers, password-protected EXE files and even ISO images. What is\ninteresting, in some emails, they ask targets to phone them if they have any questions,\nlike the FIN7 guys do.\n\n\nExample of AveMaria spearphing emails. Criminals suggest calling them.\n\n\nDuring the investigation into FIN7, our threat-hunting systems found an interesting\noverlap in between the infrastructure of FIN7 and AveMaria. Basically, two servers in the\nsame IP range and AS14576 (autonomous system) share a non-standard SSH port,\nwhich is 222. One of the servers is a Griffon C2, and the other one, an AveMaria C2.\n\nDistribution of targets is another factor suggesting that these two malware families may\nbe connected. We analyzed AveMaria targets during February and March of 2019. The\nspearphishing emails were sent to various kinds of businesses only and did not target\nindividuals. Thirty percent of the targets were small and medium-sized companies that\n\n\n-----\n\nwere suppliers or service providers for bigger players and 21% were various types of\nmanufacturing companies. We also spotted several typical FIN7 targets, such as\nretailers and hotels. Most AveMaria targets (72%) were in the EU.\n\n### CopyPaste\n\nAt the end of 2018, while searching for new FIN7 campaigns via telemetry, we\ndiscovered a set of activity that we temporarily called “CopyPaste” from a previously\nunknown APT. Interestingly, this actor targeted financial entities and companies in one\nAfrican country, which lead us to think that CopyPaste was associated with\ncybermercenaries or a training center.\n\nThis set of activity relied on open-source tools, such as Powershell Empire, and welldocumented red teaming techniques, in order to get a foothold within the victim’s\nnetworks and avoid detection.\n\nHere are the main similarities between CopyPaste and FIN7:\n\nBoth used the same Microsoft PowerShell argument obfuscation order:\n“powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -ExecutionPolicy Bypass”. We have only seen FIN7\nand CopyPaste use this argument list for executing their malicious Powershell\nScripts.\nBoth used decoy 302 HTTP redirections and typosquatting on their C2s\n(reminiscent of Cobalt and FIN7). The Empire C2s associated with CopyPaste had\ndecoy redirections to Digitcert and Microsoft websites and used decoy job\nemployment and tax websites with decoy redirections to host their payloads. FIN7\nand Cobalt used decoy 302 HTTP redirections too, FIN7 on its GRIFFON C2s\nbefore January 2018, and Cobalt, on its staging servers, similar to CopyPaste.\nQuite recently, FIN7 threat actors typosquatted the brand “Digicert” using the\ndomain name digicert-cdn[.]com, which is used as a command and control server\nfor their GRIFFON implants. CopyPaste, in turn, also typosquatted this brand with\ntheir domains digicertweb[.]com and digi-cert[.]org, both used as a Powershell\nEmpire C2 with decoy HTTP 302 redirects to the legitimate Digicert website.\n\nThe links between CopyPaste and FIN7 are still very weak. It is possible that the\nCopyPaste operators were influenced by open-source publications and do not have any\nties with FIN7.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring 2018, Europol and DoJ announced the arrest of the leader of the FIN7 and\nCarbanak/CobaltGoblin cybercrime groups. It was believed that the arrest of the group\nleader will have an impact on the group’s operations. However, recent data seems to\nindicate that the attacks have continued without significant drawbacks. One may say\nCobaltGoblin and FIN7 have even extended the number of groups operating under their\numbrella. We observe, with various level of confidence, that there are several\ninterconnected groups using very similar toolkits and the same infrastructure to conduct\ntheir cyberattacks.\n\nThe first of them is the well-known FIN7, which specializes in attacking various\ncompanies to get access to financial data or PoS infrastructure. They rely on a Griffon\nJS backdoor and Cobalt/Meterpreter, and in recent attacks, Powershell Empire. The\nsecond one is CobaltGoblin/Carbanak/EmpireMonkey, which uses the same toolkit,\ntechniques and similar infrastructure but targets only financial institutions and associated\nsoftware/services providers.\n\nWe link the AveMaria botnet to these two groups with medium confidence: AveMaria’s\ntargets are mostly suppliers for big companies, and the way AveMaria manages its\ninfrastructure is very similar to FIN7. The last piece is the newly discovered CopyPaste\ngroup, who targeted financial entities and companies in one African country, which lead\nus to think that CopyPaste was associated with cybermercenaries or a training center.\nThe links between CopyPaste and FIN7 are still very weak. It is possible that the\noperators of this cluster of activity were influenced by open-source publications and do\nnot have any ties with FIN7.\n\nAll of the aforementioned groups greatly benefit from unpatched systems in corporate\nenvironments. They thus continue to use effective spearphishing campaigns in\nconjunction with well-known MS Office exploits generated by the framework. So far, the\ngroups have not used any zero-days.\n\nFIN7/Cobalt phishing documents may seem basic, but when combined with their\nextensive social engineering and focused targeting, they are quite successful. As with\ntheir previous fake company “Combi Security”, we are confident that they continue to\ncreate new personas for use in either targeting or recruiting under a “new” brand, “IPC”.\n\nMore information about these and related attacks is available to customers of Kaspersky\nIntelligence Reports.
