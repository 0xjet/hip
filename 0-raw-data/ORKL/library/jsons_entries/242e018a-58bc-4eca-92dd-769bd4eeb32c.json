It comes as no surprise that Russian entities\nthemselves became an attractive target for spear-phishing campaigns that are exploiting the\nsanctions imposed on Russia by western countries. These sanctions have put enormous pressure on\nthe Russian economy, and specifically on organizations in multiple Russian industries.\n\nCheck Point Research (CPR) details a targeted campaign that has been using sanctions-related\nbaits to attack Russian defense institutes, part of the Rostec Corporation. The investigation shows\nthat this campaign is part of a larger Chinese espionage operation that has been ongoing against\nRussian-related entities for several months. CPR researchers estimate with high confidence that the\ncampaign has been carried out by an experienced and sophisticated Chinese nation-state APT. In\nthe below blog, the researchers reveal the tactics and techniques used by the threat actors and\nprovide a technical analysis of the observed malicious stages and payloads, including previously\nunknown loaders and backdoors with multiple advanced evasion and anti-analysis techniques.\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n\n-----\n\nCPR unveils a targeted campaign against at least two research institutes in Russia, whose\nprimary expertise is the research and development of highly technological defense solutions.\nResearch suggests that another target in Belarus, likely also related to the research field,\nreceived a similar spear-phishing email claiming that the US is allegedly spreading a\nbiological weapon.\nThe defense research institutes that we identified as targets of this attack belong to a holding\ncompany within the Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec Corporation. It is\nRussia’s largest holding company in the radio-electronics industry and the specific targeted\nresearch institutes’ primary focus is the development and manufacturing of electronic\nwarfare systems, military-specialized onboard radio-electronic equipment, air-based radar\nstations and means of state identification.\nThis campaign is a continuation of what CPR believes to be a long-running espionage\noperation against Russian-related entities that has been in operation since at least June 2021.\nThe operation may still be ongoing, as the most recent activity was observed in April 2022.\nThis activity was attributed with high confidence to a Chinese threat actor, with possible\nconnections to Stone Panda (aka APT10), a sophisticated and experienced nation-statebacked actor, and Mustang Panda, another proficient China-based cyber espionage threat\nactor. CPR named this campaign Twisted Panda to reflect the sophistication of the tools\nobserved and the attribution to China.\nThe hackers use new tools, which have not previously been described: a sophisticated multilayered loader and a backdoor dubbed SPINNER. These tools are in development since at\nleast March 2021 and use advanced evasion and anti-analysis techniques such as multi-layer\nin-memory loaders and compiler-level obfuscations.\n\n## Infection chain\n\nOn March 23, malicious emails were sent to several defense research institutes based in Russia.\nThe emails, which had the subject “ List of <target institute name> persons under\n```\nUS sanctions for invading Ukraine ”, contained a link to an attacker-controlled site\n\n```\nmimicking the Health Ministry of Russia `minzdravros[.]com and had a malicious document`\nattached:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Spear-phishing email sent to research institutions in Russia._\n\nOn the same day, a similar email was also sent to an unknown entity in Minsk, Belarus with the\nsubject “ US Spread of Deadly Pathogens in Belarus ”. All the attached documents are\ncrafted to look like official documents from the Russian Ministry of Health, bearing its official\nemblem and title:\n\n_Figure 2: Screenshot of the lure document sent to research institutions in Russia._\n\n\n-----\n\nEach document downloads an external template from the URLs with a similar format, such as\n```\nhttps://www.microtreely.com/support/knowledgebase/article/AIUZGAE7230Z[.]dotm .\n\n```\nThe external template contains a macro code that imports several API functions from kernel32\n( LoadLibraryA, `CreateFileA,` `WriteFile,` `ReadFile, etc) and uses them to:`\n\nWrite three files ( cmpbk32.dll, `cmpbk64.dll, and` `INIT ) to the path:`\n```\n   C:/Users/Public .\n\n```\nLoad `cmpbk32.dll or` `cmpbk64.dll (depending on the system OS architecture) and`\nexecute its exported function `R1 .`\n\nExecution of the exported function R1 finalizes the initialization of the malicious files. The\nmalware creates a working directory `%TEMP%\\\\OfficeInit and copies to it` `INIT and`\n```\ncmpbk32.dll files, as well as a legitimate 32-bit Windows executable cmdl32.exe from either\n\n```\nSystem32 or SysWOW64 folder, depending on if the operating system is 32 or 64 bit.\n\n_Figure 3: The simplified infection chain._\n\n## The Loader\n\nThe loader is a 32-bit DLL utilizing dynamic API resolving with name hashing for evasion and\nanti-analysis. The loader is not only able to hide its main functionality, but also avoid static\ndetection of suspicious API calls by dynamically resolving them instead of using static imports.\n\nThe purpose of `cmpbk32.dll is to load specific shellcode from the INIT file, depending on the`\ninfection stage, and run it. The `INIT file contains two shellcodes: the first-stage shellcode runs`\nthe persistence and cleanup script, and the second-stage shellcode is a multi-layer loader. The goal\nis to consecutively decrypt the other three fileless loader layers and eventually load the main\npayload in memory. To distinguish between the stages, the DLL entry point `DllMain performs`\ndifferent actions based on the call reason.\n\n**Setup Stage**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the malicious document is closed, a `PROCESS_DETACH event is triggered. The DLL`\nexecutes a portion of the INIT file in charge of cleaning up the files created by the malicious\ndocument and creates a scheduled task for persistence:\n\n_Figure 4: DLLMain PROCESS_DETACH event executes shellcode responsible for persistence and_\n_cleanup from INIT_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Persistence and cleanup function_\n\n**Loader stage**\n\nThe main loading process begins with the scheduled task running `cmdl32.exe which loads the`\nmalicious DLL `cmpbk32.dll . DLL sideloading by a legitimate process is a technique`\ncommonly used by threat actors; coupling it with a robust loading process can help evade modern\nanti-virus solutions as, in this case, the actual running process is valid and signed by Microsoft.\nNote that the `cmpbk64.dll is not copied into the` `%TEMP%\\\\OfficeInit folder. The 64-bit`\nversion of the DLL is only used in the initial infection stage by the 64-bit MS Word process, as the\n32-bit `cmdl32.exe can only load 32-bit` `cmpbk32.dll .`\n\nWhen the DLL is loaded, the `PROCESS_ATTACH event is triggered and starts a sequence of`\noperations. The sequence peels off multiple encrypted layers from the `INIT file and eventually`\nreveals and executes the final payload. It first reads an XOR-encrypted blob from the `INIT file`\nand decrypts it in memory using a simple XOR with the key `0x9229 . The decrypted blob is a`\nposition-independent code and the first of the encrypted layers that “protects” the main payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Layers of decryption performed by the loader to uncover the final payload._\n\nThis first layer is rather simple. It dynamically loads from Kernel32.dll the WinAPI functions that\nare essential for its work. Next, it begins a sequence of operations to uncover the second layer. It\nuses RC4 with the following hardcoded key: `0x1C, 0x2C, 0x66, 0x7C, 0x11, 0xCF,`\n```\n0xE9, 0x7A, 0x99, 0x8B, 0xA3, 0x48, 0xC2, 0x03, 0x07, 0x55 . It then\n\n```\ndecompresses the decrypted buffer using `RtlDecompressBuffer and reveals the second layer.`\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Injection to msiexec.exe_\n\nThe injected code begins by dynamically loading a PE file embedded inside and executing it from\nits entry point.\n\n## SPINNER backdoor: technical analysis\n\nThe payload uses two compiler-level obfuscations:\n\n_Control flow flattening: alters the code flow making it non-linear_\n_Opaque predicates: defines unused logic and causes the binary to perform needless_\ncalculations\n\nBoth methods make it difficult to analyze the payload, but together, they make the analysis painful,\ntime-consuming, and tedious. These two types of obfuscations were previously spotted being used\n[together in samples attributed to the Chinese-speaking group Stone Panda (APT10) and Mustang](https://www.virusbulletin.com/blog/2020/03/vb2019-paper-defeating-apt10-compiler-level-obfuscations/)\nPanda.\n\n_Figure 8: Opaque predicate and control flow flattening code obfuscations in the SPINNER sample._\n\nWhen the SPINNER backdoor starts to run, it creates a mutex called `MSR__112 to ensure there`\nis only one instance of the payload running at a time. The payload also expands the persistence\npreviously created by the loader. It creates a new registry key `OfficeInit under`\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run that points to the\ncmdl32.exe path.\n\n```\nNext, it sets up its own configuration, which contains the following fields:\n\nstruct malware_config {\n\nstd::string full_c2_url;\n\nstd::string host_name;\n\nstd::string c2_uri;\n\n\n-----\n\nDWORD use_https;\n\nDWORD port;\n\nDWORD sleep_time;\n\n}\n\nThe `full_c2_url is decrypted using XOR decryption with the key` `0x50 . After decryption,`\nthe function `InternetCrackUrlA is used to crack a URL into its component parts: the`\n```\nc2_url_without_scheme, c2_uri, port and use_https fields .\n\n```\nNext, the backdoor starts its main loop by checking if it’s the first run and therefore system\nfingerprinting has not yet occurred. If the answer is no, the backdoor creates a random 16-byte Bot\nID and saves it to the file `%TEMP%\\\\OfficeInit\\\\init.ini . It then collects data about the`\ninfected system and creates a string containing the following data:\n\nBot ID\nComputer name\nLocal IP\nWindows version\nUsername\nSleep time retrieved from the malware config\nProcess ID\nNULL appended at the end of the string\n\nWhen it has the string containing all the gathered data, the backdoor prepares a packet to be sent to\nthe C&C server, constructed in the following way:\n\n**Offset** **Field**\n\n0x0 16 null bytes\n\n0x10 4-byte command ID – `0x10010001`\n\n0x14 4 null bytes\n\n0x18 System information string length\n\n0x1C System information string\n\nNext, the backdoor generates a random 8-byte RC4 key that is used to encrypt the entire packet.\nThe final packet has this structure:\n\n**Offset** **Field**\n\n0x0 8-byte randomly generated RC4 key\n\n\n-----\n\n0x8 Packet data size\n\n0xC Packet data\n\nThe packet is sent through the HTTP/S depending on the URL retrieved from the malware\nconfiguration. Similar to the request, the response from the C&C server is encrypted with RC4 and\nhas the same structure containing the key, size, and data. The C&C response can contain one of the\nfollowing commands:\n\n\n**Command**\n**ID**\n\n\n**Action**\n\n\n0x10030001 Exit Process\n\n0x10010002 Self-update – Write data to the INIT file and create another instance of\nthe `cmdl32.exe using` `CreateProcessW .`\n\n0x10010001 Collect system information and send the data back to the C&C\n\nJudging by the supported commands, this version of the SPINNER backdoor has only basic\ncapabilities to enumerate the host system. Its main purpose is to run additional payloads received\nfrom the C&C server. While we were not able to get other payloads, based on other findings\ndescribed later in the research, we believe that selected victims likely received the full backdoor\nwith additional capabilities.\n\n## Previous campaign\n\nWhile searching VirusTotal for files similar to the loader, we encountered an additional cluster\nwhich also utilizes DLL sideloading to launch an in-memory loader that is very similar to the one\nwe discussed previously. It then loads a payload that could be an earlier variant of the SPINNER\nbackdoor. Judging by the names of the files and compilation stamps of the executables, the\ncampaign has been active since June 2021.\n\nUnlike the current campaign, which uses Microsoft Word documents as a dropper, the previous\nwave of attacks relied on executables bearing the Microsoft Word logo. This suggests these\ndroppers were intended to be delivered to the victims by the same means as the malicious\ndocuments, via spear-phishing emails, either as attachments or links to fake sites.\n\n**The Dropper**\n\nThe dropper is a 64-bit executable that has a simpler flow than the previously discussed malicious\ndocument:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: The Infection chain of the campaign starts with the executable dropper._\n\nFirst, it extracts the following files from resources: `rekeywiz.exe,` `UnityPlayer.dll and`\n```\nPIN, and drops them into the working folder C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\PublicPIN . The file\nrekeywiz.exe masquerades as a legitimate Windows executable EFS REKEY Wizard, but in\n\n```\nfact, is a Steam gaming platform interactive wallpaper called Sheep. Sheep is a digitally signed\nUnity-based application for Steam Wallpaper Engine. Therefore, it can evasively side-load the\nmalicious loader that imitates Unity dll which in turn loads, decrypts and executes the shellcode\nfrom the `PIN file.`\n\nThe dropper also decrypts from the resources, drops a decoy Word document to\n```\n%USER%\\\\Documents\\\\offic\\\\ (the typo is on the actor) and opens it for the victim. All the\n\n```\ndecoy documents we observed in different droppers used Russian government-related themes,\nsuch as the Decrees of the President of the Russian Federation, with documents’ names and\ncontent in Russian. It can be assumed that the campaign is also targeting entities in or related to\nRussia.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: A fragment of the decoy document launched by the dropper._\n\nFor persistence, the dropper creates a scheduled task called `InterSys that points to`\n```\nrekeywiz.exe . The code handling this is very similar to the “persistence and cleanup” function\n\n```\nfrom the loader we described earlier:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: Persistence set up by the dropper._\n\n**The Loader**\n\nThe older versions of the loader contain debugging information and feature an interesting PDB\npath: `C:\\\\D\\\\StageS\\\\Release\\\\HackDll2.pdb .`\n\nAs the infection chain is simpler, when it is side-loaded by `rekeywiz.exe, the loader only`\nhandles the `PROCESS_ATTACH event. The payload decryption code for the loader is similar to`\nthe one we described, and it performs the same steps as the new loader: XOR decryption for the\nfirst layer encryption, RC4 decryption for the second layer, and injection to a newly created\n```\nmsiexec.exe .\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: UnityPlayer.dll XORing bytes from the PIN file (with the keys 0x29, 0x92) vs_\n_cmpbk32.dll XORing bytes from the INIT file (with the keys 0x29, 0x92)_\n\n**Final payload – full SPINNER backdoor**\n\nMany of the functions inside the final payload share similar logic with the SPINNER variant\ndescribed above, but the payload lacks the compiler-level obfuscations observed in the newer\ncampaign making it easier to analyze. Furthermore, the previous version of the backdoor contains\nadditional features. This is another indication that the initial SPINNER backdoor version we\nobserved is only a part of the bigger payload. It’s likely the actors eventually split the payload and\nonly equipped the first stage of the main backdoor with essential functions: enumeration of the\nvictim’s machine and execution of the next stage payloads received from the C&C server.\n\nThe full version of the SPINNER backdoor contains the following capabilities:\n\nCollects information about the infected machine (enumerate disks, files).\nExfiltrates files from the infected machine and manipulates the local files.\nRuns OS commands and executes downloaded payload, as part of typical backdoor\ncapabilities.\n\nBelow is the full list of supported commands:\n\n\n**Command**\n**ID**\n\n\n**Command Description** **Arguments** **Output**\n\n\n0x10040001 Enumerate disk drives None Logical drive strings and\ntheir drive types.\n\n\n-----\n\n0x10040003 Create directory Directory\nName\n\n0x10040004 Rename file Original File\nName and\nNew File\nName\n(separated\nby ‘\\t’)\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\n0x10040005 Delete file File Name Return value\n\n\n0x10040006 Copy file Original File\nName and\nNew File\nName\n(separated\nby ‘\\t’)\n\n0x10040007 Move file Original File\nName and\nNew File\nName\n(separated\nby ‘\\t’)\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\n0x10040008 Reads file data (Max File\nSize = 0xA00000)\n\n\nFile Name File content\n\n\n0x10040009 Write to file A struct that\ncontains:\nFile Name,\nFile Name\nSize,\nContent To\nWrite,\nContent\nSize\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\n0x10050001 Run command using\ncmd.exe\n\n\ncmd line Output from Command Line\n\n\n-----\n\n0x10010001 Send User Info (same as\nthe first message to C&C)\n\n\nNone Bot ID (saved to and\nretrieved from version.dll\nfile), Computer Name, Host\nInfo, x86/x64, User Name,\nSleep Time, Process ID\n\n\n0x10000002 Update Sleep time New Sleep\nTime\n\n0x10000003 Do nothing\n\n\nReturn value\n\n\nThe communication protocol between the SPINNER backdoor and the C&C server didn’t change\nfrom one version to the next.\n\n**Campaign TTPs evolution**\n\nIn less than a year, the actors significantly improved the infection chain and made it more\ncomplex. All the functionality from the old campaign was preserved, but it was split between\nmultiple components making it harder to analyze or detect each stage. Here are some examples of\nthe split components:\n\nThe EXE dropper functionality is split between a malicious document and the loader. It’s a\nreasonable adjustment as an executable. Even one that masquerades as a document might\nraise a lot more suspicion than a carefully crafted document.\nAdding more functionality to the DLL loader. Interestingly, the actors chose not to add more\nexported functions to the DLL, but to handle different call reasons in DllMain, making some\nparts of malicious code run stealthy in the background when the document is closed.\nAlthough the loader contains some anti-analysis and evasion techniques, such as the use of\nshellcode and dynamic API resolving using hashed, in the latest campaign the actors added\nsignificant improvements by supplementing complex compiler-level obfuscations to the\nSPINNER backdoor.\nIn addition to the complex obfuscations, the SPINNER backdoor was reduced to only basic\nfunctionality. This was likely done to increase the malware’s stealth and evasion.\n\n## Attribution\n\n**SPINNER backdoor**\n\n\n-----\n\nAs with any unknown malware sample, the SPINNER loader and backdoor analysis required CPR\nto determine whether it was a known malware sample or an entirely new malware family. At first\n[glance, the payload looked similar to the PlugX/Hodur malware described by ESET in a recently](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/23/mustang-panda-hodur-old-tricks-new-korplug-variant/)\npublished report on Chinese APT Mustang Panda. The first similarity is in the ID numbering of\nC&C commands: both malware use 2 bytes to specify the command category and 2 bytes for a\nspecific command from this category. For example, the command `0x10010001 is used in the`\nSPINNER variant to send the system information data, while Hodur malware uses the command\ngroup `0x1001 and command ID` `0x1001 for the same action.`\n\nIn addition, some of the commands themselves overlap between the samples, such as those that list\nthe logical drives, get detailed information about the files in a directory, or execute commands\nusing cmd.exe. These functionalities are not unique and can usually be found in many backdoors.\nIn this case, the two malware share an even greater and more surprising similarity. After opening\nthe Hodur PlugX variant in the disassembler, it became apparent that Hodur — like SPINNER —\nwas heavily obfuscated using Control Flow Flattening (CFF). However, Hodur’s CFF is different\nfrom SPINNER’s. Hodur’s CFF relies on a dispatcher that uses a certain register to decide which\ncode block to jump to next, while in SPINNER the register is used as-is without any manipulation.\nIn the PlugX variant, additional arithmetic operations are used on the register before it is checked\nby the dispatcher. To complete the obfuscation comparison, Hodur heavily obfuscates its API calls\nand strings, a step which is absent in SPINNER.\n\n_Figure 13: Control flow flattening used in SPINNER variant (on the left) vs control flow flattening_\n_with arithmetic operations on the CFF register used in the Hodur variant (on the right)._\n\nIn terms of implementation, the malware samples are entirely different. Hodur is a multithreaded\nWindows Desktop application and communicates with the C&C through multiple threads, each\nwith its own purpose, while SPINNER is a single-threaded Console application. Hodur’s\nenumeration method is more extensive than SPINNER’s, but it does not use Bot ID which\n\n\n-----\n\nidentifies a specific infected machine. The self-delete function in Hodur might be similar in its\nlogic to SPINNER, but it uses a completely different set of commands to delete itself and its\nassociated files. Hodur’s communication logic with the C&C is more complex, drawn from\ndifferent parts of the code and from multiple threads, while SPINNER has only has one function\nthat handles the commands.\n\nWhile the differences indicate these malware belong to different families, they share “best\npractices” similarities. Here are some examples of their similarities:\n\nBoth use WS2_32 functions to retrieve the local computer IPv4 address\nThey show interest in enumeration files in certain directories by looking for specific data\nsuch as the last access time\nBoth enumerate the disk drives, searching thumb drives for interesting data\nThey execute commands from the C&C through cmd.exe using a pipe, etc.\n\nIt can be argued that those are just common techniques used by all backdoors, but it is not unlikely\nthat these tools might have the same upstream source and therefore share many best practices and\nmethods.\n\n**Chinese-based activity**\n\nThe Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of this operation enabled us to attribute it to\nChinese APT activity. In general, Chinese groups are known to reuse and share tools between\nthem. Without enough strong evidence, such as infrastructure-based connections, we couldn’t\ndirectly attribute this activity with high confidence to any specific Chinese threat actor. However,\nthe Twisted Panda campaign bears multiple overlaps with advanced and long-standing Chinese\ncyberespionage actors:\n\nThe control-flow obfuscations observed in SPINNER were previously used by the Chinese\n[group APT10 and reappeared in a recent Mustang Panda espionage campaign:](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/03/vb2019-paper-defeating-apt10-compiler-level-obfuscations/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Control-flow obfuscations in MustangPanda sample_\n_(698d1ade6defa07fb4e4c12a19ca309957fb9c40)._\n\n[APT group Mustang Panda was observed exploiting the invasion of Ukraine to target](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/bronze-president-targets-russian-speakers-with-updated-plugx)\nRussian entities around the same time as Twisted Panda.\nThe infection flow relying on DLL side-loading is a favorite evasion technique used by\nmultiple Chinese actors. Examples include the infamous PlugX malware (and its multiple\nvariants, including the aforementioned Mustang Panda’ Hodur samples), the recently\n[published APT10 global espionage campaign that used the VLC player for side-loading, and](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-china-ngo-government-attacks)\n[other APT10 campaigns.](https://securelist.com/apt10-sophisticated-multi-layered-loader-ecipekac-discovered-in-a41apt-campaign/101519/)\nIn addition to the similarities between SPINNER and Hodur that we previously mentioned,\nother practices like multi-layer in-memory loaders based on shellcodes and PEs, especially\ncombined with dynamic API resolutions via hashes, are also a signature technique for many\nChinese groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe victimology of the Twisted Panda campaign is consistent with Chinese long-term\ninterests.\n\n## Targets\n\nThe defense research institutes that we identified as targets of this attack belong to a holding\ncompany within the Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec Corporation. It is Russia’s\nlargest holding company in the radio-electronics industry and the specific targeted research\ninstitutes’ primary focus is the development and manufacturing of electronic warfare systems,\nmilitary-specialized onboard radio-electronic equipment, air-based radar stations and means of\nstate identification. The research entities are also involved in avionics systems for civil aviation,\nthe development of a variety of civil products such as medical equipment and control systems for\nenergy, transportation, and engineering industries.\n\n[The Made in China 2025 plan defines objectives for China to become a major technological and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025)\neconomic power, and also identifies the sectors in which it must become a world leader, including\nrobotics, medical equipment, and aviation. To support that, China’s five-year plan for the years\n2021-2025 outlines a steady increase in R&D budgets each year in order to expand China’s\nscientific and technical capabilities. However, multiple reports – not from the United States and\n[other countries including Russia, which is considered China’s strategic partner – reveal that](https://rt-solar.ru/analytics/reports/2203)\nalongside overt relations and measures, China employs covert tools to gather information, thus\ncombining partnerships with diverse espionage activity. Together with the previous reports of\n[Chinese APT groups conducting their espionage operations against the Russian defense and](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/portdoor-new-chinese-apt-backdoor-attack-targets-russian-defense-sector)\n[governmental sector, the Twisted Panda campaign described in this research might serve as more](https://rt-solar.ru/analytics/reports/2203)\nevidence of the use of espionage in a systematic and long-term effort to achieve Chinese strategic\nobjectives in technological superiority and military power.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this report, CPR researchers have described and exposed a Chinese espionage operation named\nTwisted Panda which targets defense research institutes in Russia and possibly also in Belarus.\nThis campaign relies on social engineering techniques and exploits recently imposed sanctions on\nRussia to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor called SPINNER to specific targets. The\npurpose of the backdoor and the operation is likely to collect information from targets inside the\nhigh-tech Russian defense industry to support China in its technological advancement.\n\nAs a part of this investigation, we uncovered the previous wave of this campaign, also likely\ntargeting Russian or Russia-related entities, active since at least June 2021. The evolution of the\ntools and techniques throughout this time period indicates that the actors behind the campaign are\npersistent in achieving their goals in a stealthy manner. In addition, the Twisted Panda campaign\nshows once again how quickly Chinese espionage actors adapt and adjust to world events, using\nthe most relevant and up-to-date lures to maximize their chances of success.\n\nTo help track and research the Twisted Panda campaign, see Appendix A for relevant Yara rules\nfor all the major components of this attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IOCs\n\n```\n email\n\n```\n```\nd723c18baea565c9263dca0eb3a1\n1904\n\n```\n```\n docx\n\n```\n```\n027845550d7a0da404f0f331178c\nb28b\n\n```\n```\n docx\n\n```\n```\n1f9a72dc91759cd06a0f05ac4486\ndda1\n\n```\n```\n docx\n\n```\n```\nd95bbe8a97d864dc40c9cf845aeb\n4e9e\n\n```\n```\n template\n\n```\n```\nce02ee477e1188f0664dd65b17e8\n3d11\n\n```\n```\n template\n\n```\n```\n3855dc19811715e15d9775a42b1a\n6c55\n\n```\n```\n template\n\n```\n```\n7dd4c80acc4dca33af0d26477efe\n2002\n\n```\n```\n90e6878ebfb3e962523f03f9d411\nb35c\n\n```\n```\n loader\n(64-bit)\n\n```\n```\n7a371437e98c546c664971370313\n4727\n\n```\n```\n loader\n(32-bit)\n\n```\n```\n www.miniboxmail[.]com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n www.minzdravros[.]com\n\n```\n```\n www.microtreely[.]com\n\n```\n**Old campaign:**\n\n```\n312dcd11c146323876079f55ca37\n1c84\n\n```\n```\ndro\nppe\nr\n\n```\n```\n443c66275e2802c00afe2cf16f14\n7737\n\n```\n```\ndro\nppe\nr\n\n```\n```\nfd73eeead785470f79536e9eb2eb\n6ef2\n\n```\n```\ndro\nppe\nr\n\n```\n```\n176d7239887a9d0dd24e2cce9042\n77bc\n\n```\n```\nloa\nder\n\n```\n```\ndaa1da9b515a32032bc621e71d4a\ne4ca\n\n```\n```\nloa\nder\n\n```\n```\ne3072cc3f99dd3a32801e523086d\n9bb1\n\n```\n```\nloa\nder\n\n```\n```\n06865195c326ff587b2c0bed1602\n1d08\n\n```\n```\nloa\nder\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n176d7239887a9d0dd24e2cce9042\n77bc\n\n```\n```\nloa\nder\n\n```\n```\n25f3da186447794de5af2fa3ff3b\ncf23\n\n```\n```\nloa\nder\n\n```\n```\n6d4bf8dd4864f9ac564d3c9661b9\n9190\n\n```\n```\nloa\nder\n\n```\n```\n img.elliotterusties[.]com\n\n```\n\n## Appendix A – YARA rules\n\nrule apt_CN_TwistedPanda_loader {\n\nmeta:\n\nauthor = \"Check Point Research\"\n\ndescription = \"Detect loader used by TwistedPanda\"\n\ndate = \"2022-04-14\"\n\nhash = \"5b558c5fcbed8544cb100bd3db3c04a70dca02eec6fedffd5e3dcecb0b04fba0\"\n\nhash = \"efa754450f199caae204ca387976e197d95cdc7e83641444c1a5a91b58ba6198\"\n\nstrings:\n\n// 6A 40 push 40h ; '@'\n\n// 68 00 30 00 00 push 3000h\n\n$seq1 = { 6A 40 68 00 30 00 00 }\n\n// 6A 00 push 0 ; lpOverlapped\n\n// 50 push eax ; lpNumberOfBytesRead\n\n// 6A 14 push 14h ; nNumberOfBytesToRead\n\n// 8D ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? lea eax, [ebp+Buffer]\n\n\n-----\n\n// 50 push eax ; lpBuffer\n\n// 53 push ebx ; hFile\n\n// FF 15 04 D0 4C 70 call ds:ReadFile\n\n$seq2 = { 6A 00 50 6A 14 8D ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 50 53 FF }\n\n// 6A 00 push 0\n\n// 6A 00 push 0\n\n// 6A 03 push 3\n\n// 6A 00 push 0\n\n// 6A 03 push 3\n\n// 68 00 00 00 80 push 80000000h\n\n$seq3 = { 6A 00 6A 00 6A 03 6A 00 6A 03 68 00 00 00 80 }\n\n// Decryption sequence\n\n$decryption = { 8B C?
