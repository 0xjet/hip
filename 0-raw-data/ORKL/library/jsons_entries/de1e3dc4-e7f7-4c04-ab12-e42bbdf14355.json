Here are just some of the\nmost recent exploits that they have used:\n\n\n## Security Response\n\n# The Elderwood Project\n\n###### Gavin O’Gorman Geoff McDonald\n\n### Overview\n\n###### Contents In 2009, we saw the start of high profile attacks by a group using the\nOverview............................................................. 1 [Hydraq (Aurora) Trojan horse.

The name “Elderwood” comes from a source code variable\nused by the attackers. This attack platform enables them to quickly\ndeploy zero-day exploits. Attacks are deployed through spear phishing\nemails and also, increasingly, through Web injections in watering hole\nattacks.\n\nAlthough there are other attackers utilizing zero-day exploits (for\n\n\n-----\n\n[• Adobe Flash Player Object Type Confusion Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-0779)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53395)\n\n[• Microsoft Internet Explorer Same ID Property Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1875)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53847)\n\n[• Microsoft XML Core Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1889)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53934)\n\n[• Adobe Flash Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1535)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/55009)\n\nIn order to discover these vulnerabilities, a large undertaking would be required by the attackers to thoroughly\nreverse-engineer the compiled applications. This effort would be substantially reduced if they had access to\nsource code. The vulnerabilities are used as needed, often within close succession of each other if exposure of\nany of the vulnerabilities is imminent.\n\nThe scale of the attacks, in terms of the number of victims and the duration of the attacks, are another\nindication of the resources available to the attackers. Victims are attacked, not for petty crime or theft, but for\nthe wholesale gathering of intelligence and intellectual property. The resources required to identify and acquire\nuseful information—let alone analyze that information—could only be provided by a large criminal organization,\nattackers supported by a nation state, or a nation state itself.\n\n### Background\n\nSerious zero-day vulnerabilities, which are exploited in the wild and affect a widely used piece of software, are\n[relatively rare; there were approximately eight in 2011. The past few months however has seen four such zero-](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_main_report_2011_21239364.en-us.pdf)\nday vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild. Two of the zero-day exploits were in Adobe Flash, the other two\nin Internet Explorer.\n\nIn April 2012, we identified seven different Trojans that were being used in conjunction with CVE-2012-0779.\nWithin one month, two more zero-day exploits were identified in the wild. These were CVE-2012-1875 and CVE2012-1889. The timing of the release of these three exploits was suspicious. As soon as one had been identified,\nthe next became active. We investigated the three exploits and found connections between them all. In the past\nfew weeks, yet another zero-day exploit was detected in the wild, CVE-2012-1535. We have tied this zero-day\nexploit back to all the others. They may only be the tip of the iceberg.\n\n[In early 2010, Google documented an attack against their infrastructure. They stated that they were attacked](http://googleblog.blogspot.ie/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html#!/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html)\n[in December 2009 and that the attacks originated in China. The attackers utilized a Trojan called Hydraq, (also](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-011114-1830-99)\n[known as Aurora), which was delivered using an Internet Explorer zero-day exploit. We believe the Hydraq attack](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hydraq-attack-mythical-proportions)\nand the recent Figure 1\nattacks that exploit Timeline of zero-day exploits attributable to the one group\nthe vulnerabilities\noutlined above are\nlinked.\n\nIn March 2011, at\nleast two Adobe\nFlash zero-day\nattacks were\n[utilized in similar](http://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Calendar/20110617)\n[attacks against](http://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Calendar/20110617)\nthe same types\nof victims. In\nSeptember 2011,\nyet another Adobe\nFlash zero-day\nexploit was used\n\n\n-----\n\nto attack visitors to the Amnesty International Hong Kong site. The very same website was again compromised\n[in the most recent set of attacks. Our analysis shows that a single group has been using these zero-day exploits,](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/cve-2012-1875-exploited-wild-part-1-trojannaid)\nalong with others over the past couple of years, in targeted attacks against individuals, companies, governments,\nand even entire sectors. A timeline for these various zero-day exploits is shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe attacks conducted by this group are carried out using several different techniques.\n\nOne of the methods used, called a watering hole attack, shown in figure 2, is a clear shift in their method of\noperations. The concept of the attack is similar to a predator waiting at a watering hole in a desert. The predator\nknows that victims will eventually have to come to the watering hole, so rather than go hunting, he waits for\nhis victims to come to him. Similarly, attackers find a Web site that caters to a particular audience in which the\nattackers are interested. For example, people who visit the Amnesty International Hong Kong website are most\n\nFigure 2\n###### Web injection process used in watering hole attacks\n\nlikely visiting because they are interested in human rights issues in Hong Kong. Having identified this website,\nthe attackers hack into it using a variety of means. For example, the site may be vulnerable to a SQL injection,\nor perhaps the attackers compromise the machine of an individual with publishing rights to the website. The\n\n\n-----\n\nattackers then inject an exploit onto public pages of the website that are hopefully visited by their ultimate\ntarget. Any visitor susceptible to the exploit is compromised and a back door Trojan is installed onto their\ncomputer. The attacker then has complete control over the victim’s computer.\n\nThree of the most recent zero-day exploits were used in watering hole attacks, an indication that this approach is\ngaining momentum.\n\nThe more traditional technique is to send a “spear-phishing” email, containing an attachment, to the target.\nThat attachment is a document containing an exploit which, when opened, then drops a Trojan onto the target\ncomputer. This works if the exploit is embeddable in a document. If not, then an alternative approach is to\nhost the exploit on a Web server and then email the target with a link to that Web server. The link used is quite\nunique, it is not hosted on a common Web site, so it will only be encountered by the chosen target. When the\ntarget clicks on the link, the exploit is triggered and a back door is installed.\n\nThe Elderwood gang has shown their resourcefulness over the past few years by leveraging a large number of\nzero-day vulnerabilities. The full list of vulnerabilities is shown below.\n\nTable 1\n###### Zero-day vulnerabilities associated with the Elderwood gang\n CVE BID Description Application\n\n[2012-0779](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53395) 53395 Object Type Confusion Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Adobe Flash Player\n\n[2012-1875](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53847) 53847 Same ID Property Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Microsoft Internet Explorer\n\n[2012-1889](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53934) 53934 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Microsoft XML Core Services\n\n[2012-1535](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/55009) 55009 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Adobe Flash Player\n\n[2011-0609](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/46860) 46860 'SWF' File Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability Adobe Flash Player\n\n[2011-0611](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/47314) 47314 'SWF' File Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability Adobe Flash Player\n\n[2011-2110](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/46268) 48268 Adobe Flash Player Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability Adobe Flash Player\n\n[2010-0249](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/37815) 37815 'srcElement()' Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Internet Explorer\n\nWe have analyzed four of the most recent exploits (CVE-2012-0779, CVE-2012-1875, CVE-2012-1889, and\nCVE-2012-1535) and their associated malicious documents, the Trojans, and the infrastructure utilized in the\nattacks. There are several common features used in the attacks. Some of these features hint at the potential\ninfrastructure, or platform, developed to support these attacks. From this analysis we have identified an\nincrease in watering hole attacks by this group and developed a theory describing the possible infrastructure the\nattackers are utilizing. We also describe the various targeted industry sectors and provide evidence that a single\ngang is most likely to be behind the attacks.\n\n### Targets\n\nThe targets of the four recent zero-day exploits were attacked through both email (CVE-2012-0779 and CVE2012-1535) and Web vectors (CVE-2012-0779, CVE-2012-1875, and CVE-2012-1889). Identifying the target\nprofile and related industry to which the target belongs is straight forward when email is used in an attack.\nIdentifying the profile of the targets when the Web is used as the attack vector is difficult. For example, if an\naeronautical website was compromised, the attackers may be trying to infect visitors from the Defense industry,\nthe aeronautical company employees themselves, or perhaps visitors from others aeronautical companies. For\nour analysis, we have had to presume that the industry sector being targeted is the same as that of the watering\nhole website, understanding that in reality this may not always be the case.\n\n|Table 1 Zero-day vulnerabilities associated with the Elderwood gang|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|CVE 2012-0779|BID 53395|Description Object Type Confusion Remote Code Execution Vulnerability|Application Adobe Flash Player|\n|2012-1875|53847|Same ID Property Remote Code Execution Vulnerability|Microsoft Internet Explorer|\n|2012-1889|53934|Remote Code Execution Vulnerability|Microsoft XML Core Services|\n|2012-1535|55009|Remote Code Execution Vulnerability|Adobe Flash Player|\n|2011-0609|46860|'SWF' File Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability|Adobe Flash Player|\n|2011-0611|47314|'SWF' File Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability|Adobe Flash Player|\n|2011-2110|48268|Adobe Flash Player Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability|Adobe Flash Player|\n|2010-0249|37815|'srcElement()' Remote Code Execution Vulnerability|Internet Explorer|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe primary targets identified are defense, or more precisely manufacturers that are in the defense supply\nchain. These are companies who manufacture electronic or mechanical components which are then sold to\ntop-tier defense companies. The attackers may use the manufacturers as a stepping stone to gain access to\ntop-tier defense contractors, or obtain intellectual property used in the production of parts that make up larger\nproducts produced by a top-tier defense company.\n\nFigure 3\n###### Target sectors\n\nThe second most common target is the general area of human rights, or Non Governmental Organizations\n(NGOs). A number of websites generally relating to religion, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China were compromised\nfor this purpose. The CVE-2012-1875 exploit is almost exclusively used in this target sector, with some crossover\nfrom the CVE-2012-1889 exploit.\n\nFigure 4\n###### Number of targeted companies (Email) and compromised websites (Web) per exploit\n\n\n-----\n\nThe remaining target sectors include Finance, Energy (Oil/Gas), Education, and Government. There are a number\nof outlier victims, such as a hotel jobs site, which may have simply been targeted in error and are collateral\ndamage. The vast majority of detections are in the United States. Figure 5 shows those detections.\n\nFigure 5\n###### Global detections of files used in the past year by the Elderwood gang\n\n### Escalation of watering hole attacks\n\nAs we have noted earlier, the number of watering hole attacks have been on the increase. The attacks begin with\nan attacker locating a vulnerability on a chosen website. This vulnerability allows the attacker to insert some\nJavaScript, or HTML, into the website. That piece of code contains a link, or iFrame, which points to another Web\npage that actually hosts exploit code for the chosen vulnerability. When a user connects to the hacked website,\nthey are automatically referred to the malicious Web page which exploits a vulnerability allowing the attacker to\ninstall malware onto the victim’s computer. Once the iFrame and malicious code are in place on the server, the\nattacker does not need to do anything but simply wait for victims to browse to the website, or visit the watering\nhole, and become infected.\n\nWeb injection attacks are not new and are commonly used in cybercrime. The difference between their use in\ncybercrime and in watering hole attacks is down to the choice of websites to compromise and use in the attacks.\nIn a mass injection attack, criminals will indiscriminately compromise any website they can, but in watering hole\nattacks, the attackers are focused. They choose websites within a particular sector so as to infect persons of\ninterest who likely work in that same sector and are likely to therefore visit related websites. Targeting a specific\nwebsite is much more difficult than merely locating websites that contain a vulnerability. The attacker has to\nresearch and probe for a weakness on the chosen website.\n\nIndeed, in watering hole attacks, the attackers may compromise a website months before they actually use\nit in an attack. Once compromised, the attackers periodically connect to the website to ensure that they still\nhave access. This way, the attackers can infect a number of websites in one stroke, thus preserving the value of\ntheir zero-day exploit. They are even in a position to inspect the website logs to identify any potential victims of\ninterest. This technique ensures that they obtain the maximum return for their valuable zero-day exploit.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough watering hole attacks have been known about since approximately March of 2011, the activity outlined\nin this report marks a substantial increase. Three zero-day exploits, CVE-2012-0779, CVE-2012-1875, and CVE2012-1889 have all been used within a 30-day period to serve up back door Trojans from compromised websites.\n\nFigure 6\n###### Elderwood platform\n\n\n-----\n\nThe increase in the use of this attack technique requires the attackers to sift through a much greater amount\nof stolen information than a targeted attack relying on email, as the number of victims compromised by a Web\ninjection attack will be much greater. Although multiple emails are often sent to numerous victims, the scale of\nsuch attacks is much smaller than the number of victims infected by visiting one of a number of compromised\nwebsites. We believe, to solve this problem, the attackers have built a system that allows them to execute new\ncampaigns by simply dropping in a new exploit and various other components, such as Trojans and hacked\nservers.\n\n### Attack platform\n\nThe attackers have leaked snippets of information that hint at the type of infrastructure that is likely to be used\nto implement these attacks. Figure 6 is a diagram of the various processes and steps that that the Elderwood\nattackers must go through to conduct their attacks.\n\nAll attacks require a Trojan to infect the target computer. This Trojan is packaged with a packer and also the\naddress of the command-and-control (C&C) server. The next step is to deliver that packaged Trojan to the target.\nDelivery is either though an email or a Web based vector. We have identified two distinct elements in the delivery\nvector that demonstrate the potential attack infrastructure.\n\n### Document creation kit\n\nThe attackers often delivered their malicious code through documents attached to email. Based on our analysis,\nwe believe the attackers have built a tool that easily allows them to automatically construct documents\ncontaining different payloads. The tool is able to take an arbitrary clean document file, specific exploit code, and\na Trojan, and bundle them together to create a malicious document ready to be used in the next attack. This tool\nis one component of the Elderwood platform. The use of such a tool can be readily seen in samples that exploit\nthe CVE-2012-0779 vulnerability where multiple document files were encoded in the same manner, but the\nTrojan payload differed.\n\n### Shared SWF file\n\nAnother component used in the attacks is a Shockwave Flash (SWF) file. Often, to ensure reliable execution\nof exploit code, code must be placed in the right areas of computer memory. In addition, exploit code often\nperforms the same task of downloading a Trojan from a remote website for execution. Instead of developing\ncode to perform these tasks for each different exploit, the attackers have developed a common SWF file that is\nused solely to create the correct conditions in memory and accepts a parameter specifying where to download\nthe Trojan. In some attacks, the parameter name was “Elderwood.” The same SWF file was seen used when\nexploiting 3 different vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-0779, CVE-2012-1875, CVE-2012-1889).\n\nBy using a common SWF file, the attackers can simply deploy a new trigger, that is, a zero-day exploit, and the\nSWF handles the rest of the work, retrieving and decoding the back door Trojan.\n\nThese various re-usable components collectively make up the Elderwood attack platform, as shown in figure 6.\nThere is no doubt that there are several other components that the attackers use in their various processes as\nwell. Other possible components of the attack platform may include:\n\n    - A tool for the automated creation of accounts on Web-based email services\n\n    - Automated registration of domain names\n\n     - Information gathering on targets – searching for, and consolidating data on, a victim to identify potential\nwebsite targets and relevant topics for email content\n\n    - An analysis platform for stolen information\n\n\n-----\n\nThe reuse of the identified components gives clues as to how the attackers may divide the labor amongst\nthemselves. Technically skilled hackers (researchers) create exploits, document creation kits, re-usable trigger\ncode (the SWF files), and compromise websites, and these are then made available to less technical attackers.\nThese attackers (attack operators) are likely responsible for identifying targets and delivering the attack payload\nusing the tools and infrastructure provided to them.\n\nOnce a target has been compromised, the less skilled attack operators can then proceed to move through\nthe compromised network, identifying data of interest. The level of technical skill required to move through a\ncompromised network is much lower than that required to establish the initial penetration.\n\n### Connecting the dots\n\nThe investigation into the various exploits began with a deep analysis of CVE-2012-0779. From this analysis, we\nidentified several Trojans which were dropped from documents utilizing the exploit. These Trojans helped us\nbegin the process of establishing links between the various zero-day exploits.\n\nThe code in one of those Trojans was obfuscated in a certain way. This same obfuscation was used on a Trojan\ndropped by CVE-2012-1875, establishing a link between the use of these two exploits. Going back in time, the\nHydraq Trojan also displayed this obfuscation.\n\nAdditional links joining the various exploits together included a shared command-and-control infrastructure.\nTrojans dropped by different exploits were connecting to the same servers to retrieve commands from the\nattackers. Some compromised websites used in the watering hole attacks had two different exploits injected into\nthem one after the other. Yet another connection is the use of similar encryption in documents and malicious\nexecutables. A technique used to pass data to a SWF file was re-used in multiple attacks. Finally, the same family\nof Trojan was dropped from multiple different exploits.\n\nFigure 7 illustrates the connections between the various exploits.\n\nFigure 7\n###### Links between different exploits\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\n[Simple targeted attacks are quite common. Most (the Taidoor attackers for example) reuse exploits and are](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/trojan_taidoor-targeting_think_tanks.pdf)\nrelatively simple to block, if one ensures that one’s network and software is regularly patched. Somewhat more\nsophisticated attackers use zero-day exploits. The Elderwood hackers use multiple zero-day exploits, multiple\nTrojans, and multiple delivery vectors. They are responsible for compromising numerous websites, corporations,\nand individuals over the past three years. This group is focused on wholesale theft of intellectual property and\nclearly has the resources, in terms of manpower, funding, and technical skills, required to implement this task.\n\nAlthough we have not conclusively established a connection between the most recent exploits and those used\nin attacks in 2011, there are similarities. Apart from the technical features in common, as mentioned previously\n(URL encoding), there is a noticeable similarity in the timing of the attacks and the types of vulnerabilities used\nbetween the 2012 and 2011 attacks. Both sets of attacks used multiple zero-day exploits one after the other,\nsometime around April to August, and both sets of attacks exploit Adobe Flash and Internet Explorer.\n\nIt may be the case that these initial “penetration” attacks are launched over a fixed period of time (several\nmonths from approximately April to August). After this initial compromise, the attackers consolidate their\nbeachhead and begin to analyze the stolen information, spreading through networks and maintaining access as\nneeded. By analyzing the information gathered, the attackers can identify yet more targets of interest. They may\nalso eventually be detected and evicted from a compromised network. In later attacks, newly identified targets\ncan be attacked and old victims can be targeted again. If this is the case, then companies and individuals need to\nbe on their guard.\n\nAny manufacturers who are in the defense supply chain need to be wary of attacks emanating from subsidiaries,\nbusiness partners, and associated companies. It is possible that those trusted companies were compromised\nby the attackers who are then using them as a stepping-stone to the true intended target. Companies and\nindividuals should prepare themselves for a new round of attacks in 2013 utilizing both Adobe Flash and Internet\nExplorer zero-day exploits. This is particularly the case for companies who have been compromised in the past\nand managed to evict the attackers. The knowledge that the attackers gained in their previous compromise will\nassist them in any future attacks.\n\n### Resources\n\nSymantec Security Response Blog\n[http://www.symantec.com/connect/symantec-blogs/sr](http://www.symantec.com/connect/symantec-blogs/sr)\n\nFollow Symantec Security Response on Twitter\n[http://twitter.com/threatintel](http://twitter.com/threatintel)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix\n\n_Malware detection names_\n\nThe Elderwood gang uses multiple different Trojans.
