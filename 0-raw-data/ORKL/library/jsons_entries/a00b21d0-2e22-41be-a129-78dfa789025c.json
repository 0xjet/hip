Bogdan\nNicolescu (aka “Masterfraud”, aka “mf”); Danet Tiberiu (aka “Amightysa”, aka “amy”); and\nRadu Miclaus (aka “Minolta”, aka “min”) were arrested by police in Romania earlier this year\nbefore being extradited to the US, where they now face multiple charges relating to fraud,\nidentity theft, money laundering, and trafficking in counterfeit goods or services.\n\nOur research shows that the Bayrob gang are career cybercriminals, earning a living from\nonline fraud. They specialize in detailed scams and go to great lengths to craft convincing\nemails and create fake websites, voice messages, and even customer support chatrooms in\norder to dupe victims.\n\nThe gang began its career running elaborate cons where it created fake vehicle auctions to\ndefraud victims out of tens of thousands of dollars. It later expanded and diversified with a\nnumber of different fraud and malware operations, ranging from credit card theft to\ncryptocurrency mining using infected computers.\n\nThe FBI believes that the Bayrob group has stolen at least US$4 million from victims over\nthe past eight years, though the actual total may be up to $35 million. It also established\nthat the group infected between 60,000 and 160,000 computers and sent out 11 million\nmalicious emails.\n\nThe arrests are the culmination of an eight-year law enforcement investigation which was\nassisted by Symantec. During this time, Symantec discovered multiple versions of Bayrob\nmalware, collected helpful intelligence data, and witnessed Bayrob as it morphed from\nonline fraud to a 300,000+ botnet for cryptocurrency mining.\n\nSymantec succeeded in exposing the gang’s operations, gaining insight into its key players,\ntactics, malware, and the potential impact and criminal activity undertaken.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Elaborate car auction scams\n\nBayrob first came to our attention in 2007, when it was discovered operating a scam that\nconned victims into believing they were buying a vehicle on eBay. Victims’ computers were\n[infected with custom designed malware (Trojan.Bayrob) which displayed fake eBay web](http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2007-030115-1234-99)\npages and misled users into thinking they were conducting a legitimate purchase on the\nauction site.\n\nThe gang identified potential victims by listing vehicles for sale on a number of websites,\nincluding eBay and classified advertising websites. It noted anyone who displayed an\ninterest in the sale, such as those who asked questions or put a bid on the vehicle. The\n\n\n-----\n\ngang would then pretend that the sale had concluded but later email potential victims,\ninforming them that the sale had fallen through and asking if they were still interested.\n\nAttached to these emails was a slideshow file, containing pictures of the vehicle supposedly\non sale. This file was infected with Trojan.Bayrob. If the victim opened it, the malware was\ninstalled on their computer.\n\n_Figure 1. Slideshow files with pictures of the vehicle supposedly on sale were infected with_\n_the Bayrob Trojan_\n\nOnce the attackers verified that the Bayrob Trojan was running on a victim’s computer, they\nmoved on to the next stage of the scam by sending an email with what they claimed was a\nlink to a new auction for the vehicle. It was at this point that the Trojan came into play. If the\nvictim clicked on the link, it would redirect them to a fake eBay page. If they decided to buy\nthe vehicle, they were asked to pay by way of a bank transfer, which was routed to an\naccount that belonged to a money mule, who would in turn transfer the proceeds of the\nfraud to the gang.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the victim s standpoint it appeared they were visiting a real eBay auction. However, if\nthe link was followed from an uninfected computer, there would be no such auction. The\ngang went to great lengths to make the scam appear realistic. Its emails were composed in\nfluent English and every iteration of the Bayrob Trojan was customized for its intended\nvictim. The fake eBay web pages even included fictitious feedback about the seller. The\nTrojan was also capable of generating fake vehicle history reports, along with fake pages\nfrom escrow and delivery services.\n\nThe fraud had a major impact on its victims, who often transferred thousands of dollars\nthinking they were paying for a new car and ended up with nothing.\n\n## Exposure and expansion\n\nBayrob’s activities were initially exposed by Symantec in 2007, when we published a series\nof blogs highlighting the eBay scam, and several media outlets reported on their activities.\nThe gang reacted angrily and, for a while, registered command and control (C&C) domain\nnames that contained abusive references to our researchers and made disparaging\nreferences to Symantec in its code.\n\n_Figure 2. One of the more polite references to Symantec made by the gang in its code_\n\nHowever, public attention didn’t deter the gang from further expanding and refining its\noperations. For example, they created a fake trucking company, which was used to\nsupposedly transport purchased vehicles to their victims. The trucking company would first\ninform the victim their vehicle was on the way and then later email them informing them of\ndelays. It even operated a phone line and fake voicemail service to appear more\nconvincing. The whole purpose of the fake trucking company was to string the victim along\nfor as long as possible in order to make sure the gang received the money before the victim\nrealized they’d been conned.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. The gang set up fake trucking companies to string the victim along for longer and_\n_make them believe their vehicle had been shipped_\n\n## Network of money mules\n\nIn order to move the proceeds of its scams back to Romania, the gang recruited a wide\nnetwork of money mules. It found potential mules by spamming classified advertising\nwebsites with fake job ads. Rather than the usual cybercriminal tactic of using “work from\n\n\n-----\n\nhome ads, the Bayrob gang often copied legitimate job ads in order appear more\nconvincing. Those who responded were told that the job had been filled but were then\noffered an alternative, work from home job.\n\nAs with its other operations, money mule recruitment was professionally executed and\nbacked up by a series of fake websites and convincing looking emails, such as one\npurporting to offer the recipient a job with a technology company. Some victims were even\ntold they’d gotten a job with a fake Yahoo subsidiary called Yahoo Transfers.\n\n_Figure 4. Some money mules were told they’d gotten a job with a fake Yahoo subsidiary_\n\nGiven that they would be handling the gang’s stolen money, mules were thoroughly vetted\nduring recruitment, using Google searches, instant messaging, and VoIP calls. The group\nrecruited mules on both sides of the Atlantic. Victims in the US were instructed to route\npayments to a bank account controlled by a mule in the US. These in turn were asked to\ntransfer the money to another mule, usually in an Eastern European country. They would\nthen presumably transfer the money on to gang members.\n\nMules in the US were often vulnerable people in difficult circumstances. They appeared to\nbe unwitting pawns of the gang, unaware of what they’d become involved with. Less is\nknown about the money mules used in Europe, but most appeared to collect transferred\nfunds using fake identities, indicating they may have been more complicit in the gang’s\nactivities.\n\n\n-----\n\nMules in the US were given two options for payment. They could keep six percent of the\nfunds they transferred or they could send the entire amount and later receive a check for 10\npercent of the total. The latter option was a scam and nobody who opted for it received any\npayment from the gang. Despite putting these money mules at risk of arrest and\nprosecution, the gang had no qualms about double crossing them and stealing from them\ntoo.\n\n## Diversification of operations\n\nOver time, the Bayrob gang expanded beyond its original auction fraud and into other areas\nof cybercrime. The group began stealing credit card information from the users of infected\ncomputers, using the stolen cards to finance the purchase of online infrastructure and\nservices that allowed it to grow its operations.\n\nIn recent years, the gang has concentrated on rapidly growing the number of infected\ncomputers in order to build a botnet. When it was exclusively involved in auction fraud, the\nnumber of infected computers was around 1,000 at any one time. However, by 2014 it had\njumped to approximately 50,000 and by mid-2016 it had grown to over 300,000 and\ncontinued to grow.\n\nOne of the main purposes of this botnet appeared to be cryptocurrency mining. A large\nnumber of infected computers provided the gang with the necessary processing power to\nprofit significantly from mining.\n\n## Breakthrough in the investigation\n\nSince 2011, Symantec has managed to progressively uncover the gang’s network, gaining a\nbroad picture of its operations. The information generated by our investigation not only\nhelped us to improve our protections against the group’s malware, but also allowed us to\nprevent future attacks and warn potential victims. What we learned assisted the FBI in its\ninvestigation and we opted not to publish what we discovered in recent years until the FBI\ninvestigation was concluded.\n\nBayrob employed a high degree of internal security. Their online communications involved\nextensive use of encryption, with email encrypted using PGP and instant messaging\nencrypted with the Off-The-Record (OTR) messaging protocol.\n\nIn order to cover its tracks, the gang hid behind a double layer of proxies, connecting first to\nproxies in Romania and then to more proxies in the US. One of our most significant\nbreakthroughs came when we discovered a weak point in their use of these proxies. Due to\nthis weakness, the gang's malicious activities were exposed, allowing us to passively\nobserve its activities on computers Symantec was protecting.\n\nOur investigation required time and patience. In one case, we observed the gang’s\nmalicious activities for a year and a half before it made an error that exposed one of its\n\n\n-----\n\nsuspected members. Over time we came to understand the group s infrastructure which\nhelped us to get see more of the gang’s operations.\nSymantec’s pursuit of Bayrob is one of many long standing investigations we currently have\nunderway, all of which are motivated by a desire to protect our customers. Today’s arrests\nillustrate the value of effective co-operation between security companies and law\nenforcement and sends a clear signal to international cybercrime gangs that they are not\nbeyond the reach of the justice system.\n\n## Protection\n\nSymantec products use multiple layers over protection against Bayrob’s malware.\nProtection has been continuously updated since 2007 to block against each new iteration of\nthe group’s malware.\n\nSymantec and Norton products block Bayrob malware with the following detections:\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n**Intrusion prevention system**\n\nIn addition to this, a range of Symantec generic detections also successfully block Bayrob\nmalware. The addition of generic detections to our defense layer makes it more difficult for\nattackers to identify which detections are designed to specifically block their malware,\nmaking it hard to test against them.\n\n## Further information\n\nSymantec has gathered full technical details and indicators of compromise for all Bayrob\nmalware variants discovered since 2007. This can be supplied to any member of the\ninformation security community upon request.\n\n\n-----",
