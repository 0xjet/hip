Locky\ntargets a large number of file extensions and is able to encrypt data on shared network\ndrives. In an attempt to further impact victims and prevent file recovery, Locky deletes all of\nthe Shadow Volume Copies on the machine.\n\nLocky uses a set of hard-coded IP addresses for C2 (command and control)\ncommunications, and once the victim has been infected, an initial HTTP POST is made\nusing a file path of `/checkupdate appended to the C2s. Locky will then continue to`\ncommunicate with the hard-coded IP addresses thereafter, or it will resort to its domain\n\n\n-----\n\ngeneration algorithm (DGA), if they become unreachable. Some variants of Locky also have\nthe ability to operate offline, meaning they do not require internet connectivity or C2s to\nencrypt a victim’s files.\n\nEach victim is assigned a personal identification number that is generated upon infection,\nsent back to the C2s, and used to provide the victim-specific decryption key should the\nransom be paid. Once infected with Locky, so-called “help files” are dropped onto the victim\nmachine, providing details of how to pay the ransom for file recovery. The Locky ransom\npayment portal URL has remained the same for some time:\n\n```\ng46mbrrzpfszonuk[.]onion/{personal ID number}.\n\n```\n\nCrowdStrike® Falcon® IntelligenceTM has not observed distribution or development of\nLocky since late 2017, with one of the last major developments being the modification of the\nransomware to use a file extension of `.diablo6 . Since Locky first came to the criminal`\nmarket in early 2016, the ransomware quickly made a name for itself when it allegedly\ninfected Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, resulting in a reported ransom payment of\n40 Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nA ransomware variant dubbed PyLocky was observed in September 2018 being distributed\nby a phishing campaign using an invoicing theme. PyLocky was found to be targeting\nentities in France and Germany. Of note is the fact that PyLocky claims to be a version of\nLocky, which as noted above, has not been active for some time.\n\nIt is Locky’s notoriety that has likely led to the operators of PyLocky choosing to appropriate\nits name and likeness; mimicking the names of successful ransomware families is a\ntechnique often used by criminal actors to gain customers. There is no evidence, as of this\nwriting, that PyLocky is at all related to either Locky ransomware or DUNGEON SPIDER,\nthe developers of Locky. However, the emergence of PyLocky and its attempt to\nmasquerade as a previously prolific and potent version of Locky indicates that adversaries\ncontinue to actively develop ransomware, and that it remains a dominant and viable threat\nvector.\n\nDUNGEON SPIDER primarily relies on broad spam campaigns with malicious attachments\nfor distribution. Locky is the community/industry name associated with this actor.\n\n## Other Known Criminal Adversaries\n\n[Cobalt Spider](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-september-cobalt-spider/)\n[Mummy Spider](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-february-mummy-spider/)\n[Salty Spider (Sality)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-salty-spider/)\n[Wicked Spider](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-july-wicked-spider/)\n\n**_Curious about other nation-state adversaries?_** _[Visit our threat actor center to learn about](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/)_\n_the new adversaries that the CrowdStrike team discovers._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Learn More:**\n\n_To learn more about how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors such as_\n_DUNGEON SPIDER into your security strategy, please visit the_ _Falcon Intelligence_\n_product page_\n_[Download the CrowdStrike 2020 Global Threat Report to get the latest insights](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2020-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/)_\n_on modern adversaries and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)_\n\nRelated Content\n\nWho is EMBER BEAR?\n\n\n-----\n\nA Tale of Two Cookies: How to Pwn2Own the Cisco RV340 Router\n\n\n-----\n\nPROPHET SPIDER Exploits Citrix ShareFile Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE 2021 22941 to\nDeliver Webshell\n\n\n-----",
