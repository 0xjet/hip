A few months ago, we published a\ngeneral research of the Lazarus Group and the Blockbuster campaign including code reuse\nand similarities throughout their malware up until the latest news regarding targeting bitcoin\nand cryptocurrency exchanges. In recent attacks, the Lazarus Group has been spreading\nmalicious documents with a RAT embedded inside that gets executed through a VBA macro.\nThese malicious documents contained a job description for different positions in various\nindustries.\n\nThrough our research, we came across a new malicious document where we have found\nchanges and a continuation to their campaign targeting potential cryptocurrency exchanges,\nFinTech, financial companies, and others who might be involved with cryptocurrencies. The\nmalicious document came embedded with an upgraded and revamped version of a RAT they\nhave added to their arsenal.\n\n### Infection Vector\n\nThe malicious document’s original creation name is “Investment Proposal.doc” and attempts to\nimpersonate an employee of an Australia based law firm for commercial and financial services\n\n\n-----\n\ncryptocurrencies and they have put together an investment proposal aimed at FinTech,\nfinancial, and other companies who might be interested in taking an investment. As can be\nseen in the photos of the document below, the document is of very low quality, meaning there\nare inconsistencies and typos everywhere in a document supposedly from a law firm.\n\nThe first page contains a basic description of what the investment proposal involves. Take note\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second page is a general description of the company Holley Nethercote which is directly\n[taken from the first page of a PDF on the company’s website.](https://www.hnlaw.com.au/site/DefaultSite/filesystem/documents/2017/Combined NEW HN-Compact-Fact Sheet 2017-12-20.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third page is a list of their employees and staff as can also be found on their\n[website. Remember Kate Harris, the director, from before? Shockingly enough, she does not](https://www.hnlaw.com.au/people)\nexist on this list.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fourth page contains a chart of various cryptocurrencies and random values associated\nwith them. The interesting point here is the date of a Bitcoin price that it mentions from\nFebruary 9th, 2018 which helps us put on a timeline of when this malicious document was\noriginally created.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fifth page states how they would like to invest $50M in the company that received this\ndocument and contains some typos like “out” instead of “our” and other grammatical errors.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sixth page is a very poorly written document supposedly signed by the CEO of Holley\nNethercote involving the investment proposition. It also contains various typos and\ngrammatical errors with the general flow not making sense.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe seventh and last page contains some fake contact information including a phone number\nfrom the UK that is from an online service that allows you to receive an SMS through the\nwebsite.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nUpon launching the document, an obfuscated VBA macro is executed to drop and execute an\nembedded remote access tool.\n\n\n-----\n\n(embedded VBA macro)\n\nThe embedded RAT is dropped to and executed from %USERPROFILE%\\RuntimeBroker.exe.\nMore evidence besides the date in the content of the document, pointing to this malware out in\nFebruary is that we can also see the compilation timestamp is from February 14, 2018 and the\nupload date was on March 2, 2018.\n\nAfter uploading the RAT to Intezer Analyze™, we found 4% of the code to have been used in\nprevious malware attributed to the Lazarus group, but 85% of the code base is completely\nunique. This says to us that they made some changes to their code.\n\n[(https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/ffb3993e-d646-42ad-8449-104d751cc17b)](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/ffb3993e-d646-42ad-8449-104d751cc17b)\n\nThe first code that gets executed within the RAT first decrypts a locally created, XOR\nencrypted buffer of names of modules and imports that it resolves via GetProcAddress.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the RAT creates a shortcut of itself to %USERPROFILE%\\Start\n_Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\RuntimeBroker.lnk in order to maintain persistence and sets the_\nattributes of itself using SetFileAttributesW to HIDDEN | SYSTEM | NORMAL. Inside of the\nfunction that is used for setting up the persistence, we can find a call to a function that is\nresponsible for decrypting a buffer containing multiple wide strings used throughout the binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs can be seen in the function, it uses a very basic decryption routine to decrypt the locally\nstored buffer. The decrypted buffer is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe parameter to the function responsible for decrypting this buffer is an offset to grab a string\nfrom this decrypted buffer by multiplying it by two, since these are wide strings.\n\nStrangely enough, a lot of these strings are not used anywhere in the binary. By the strings,\nyou can see there is an intention of including a simple anti-VM technique to detect VirtualBox.\nThere is also one more function located within the binary, responsible for the same\nfunctionality with a different buffer containing different strings.\n\nFollowing all of this, the RAT then creates a backdoor which then waits to receive commands\nfrom the various C&C servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C&C handler used to follow a pattern of command IDs but it appears to have changed to\nrandom command values and contains commands with new functionality. Their handler is able\nto handle 22 different commands and the descriptions of each can be found in the chart below.\n\n\n#### Command ID\n\n\n#### Functionality\n\n\n0xF4004A Execute cmd.exe and output results to temp file or retrieve CD via _GetCurrentDirectoryW._\nCmd.exe /c “<cmd> > <temp file>” 2>&1\n\n0x460017 Collect various information about the hard drive such as the space and volume\ninformation\n\n0x7C00E6 Collect various information about the computer such as the computer name, username,\nhost name, and more.\n\n0x6400E5 Creates new process via CreateProcessW\n\n0xBE007B Collect data about running processes by traversing the process list via\n_CreateToolhelpSnapshot32 related APIs_\n\n0x8500AF Terminates a process by name\n\n0xC004B Gets specific file(s) data such as filenames, times, and attributes\n\n0xD7007C Collects a file and sends it to the C&C\n\n0x3300E2 Zips file(s) to temp and sends archive to C&C\n\n0x9D00B0 Write a file received from the server\n\n0x200DF Write a 5mb file with random bytes\n\n\n-----\n\n0x6C00AE Overwrites entire file(s) contents with 0xCC and then deletes the file\n\n0xFD0013 Recursively traverse directory collecting file information\n\n0x3C00AB Checks if socket write access is valid to a given address\n\n0x4B00E3 Sets file(s) time via _SetFileTime_\n\n0xE50012 Configuration\n\n0x5400AC Updates socket configuration\n\n0x1B00E1 Renames file and sets attributes\n\n0x750077 Elevate process privileges\n\n0xCC0010 Inject code received by server into process\n\n0x150014 Pong response to ping\n\nThe binary uses wolfSSL to encrypt the network traffic containing two different certificates and\none private key. The certificates are stored in a local buffer of a function located within the\nbinary.\n\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----\nMIIDYjCCAkqgAwIBAgIIAT8TuSzaBG4wDQYJKoZIhvcNAQELBQAwZjELMAkGA1UE\n\nBhMCVVMxGTAXBgNVBAoMEEdsb2JhbFNpZ24gbnYtc2ExPDA6BgNVBAMMM0dsb2Jh\n\nbFNpZ24gT3JnYW5pemF0aW9uIFZhbGlkYXRpb24gQ0EgLSBTSEEyNTYgLSBHMjAi\n\nGA8yMDE3MDkyNDA3MDMzOFoYDzIwMTkwMjA3MDcwMzM4WjBmMQswCQYDVQQGEwJV\n\nUzEZMBcGA1UECgwQR2xvYmFsU2lnbiBudi1zYTE8MDoGA1UEAwwzR2xvYmFsU2ln\n\nbiBPcmdhbml6YXRpb24gVmFsaWRhdGlvbiBDQSAtIFNIQTI1NiAtIEcyMIIBIjAN\n\nBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAvwzKLRSyHoRCW804H0ryTXUQ8bY1\n\nn9/KfQOY06zeA2buKvHYsH1uB1QLEJghTYDLEiDnzE/eRX3Jcncy6sqQu2lSEAMv\n\nqPOVxfGLYlYb72dvpBBBla0Km+OlwLDScHZQMFuo6AgsfO2nonqNOCkcrMft8nyV\n\nsJWCfUlcOM13Je+9gHVTlDw9ymNbnxW10x0TLxnRPNt2Osy4fcnlwtfaQG/YIdxz\n\nG0ItU5z+Gvx9q3o2P5jehHwFZ85qFDiHqfGMtWjLaH9xICv1oGP1Vi+jJtK3b7Fa\n\nF9c4mQj+k1hv/sMTSQgWC6dNZwBSMWcjTpjtUUUduQTZC+zYKLNLve02eQIDAQAB\n\noxAwDjAMBgNVHRMEBTADAQH/MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAA4IBAQA261N1CtZuZ4Mf\n\n\n-----\n\nQ qq qj q q j y q\n\nH1LVp6ToJ+lYA0QoCxkMqe6jCWE5K8QefM/kx8WhROJTdHHUKjFXFmon/fIJUAxo\n\nSesxW3+YPeY7zzBUIjh0lYMhiyvXMDIMLo9zewR2nfi3aAa+APwAulTjm46dbH4K\n\ncn7jc8IOt954R5jakc0AhtSZUHlPqKKHZy19iDfpcoFA7L/WuiNkfYPvN6eaxAvA\n\nb3dxfi8N\n\n-----END CERTIFICATE----\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----\nMIIDgTCCAmmgAwIBAgIIAUyTG93zLTEwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQELBQAwZjELMAkGA1UE\n\nBhMCVVMxGTAXBgNVBAoMEEdsb2JhbFNpZ24gbnYtc2ExPDA6BgNVBAMMM0dsb2Jh\n\nbFNpZ24gT3JnYW5pemF0aW9uIFZhbGlkYXRpb24gQ0EgLSBTSEEyNTYgLSBHMjAi\n\nGA8yMDE3MDkyNDA3MDUyMVoYDzIwMTkwMjA3MDcwNTIxWjCBljELMAkGA1UEBhMC\n\nVVMxEDAOBgNVBAgMB05ld1lvcmsxEzARBgNVBAcMClJpdmVyIFZpZXcxIzAhBgNV\n\nBAoMGldpa2ltZWRpYSBGb3VuZGF0aW9uLCBJbmMuMRgwFgYDVQQDDA8qLndpa2lw\n\nZWRpYS5vcmcxITAfBgkqhkiG9w0BCQEWEmluZm9Ad2lraXBlZGlhLm9yZzCCASIw\n\nDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADggEPADCCAQoCggEBAMMD0Sv+OaQyRTtTyIQrKnx0mr2q\n\nKlIHR9amNrIHMo7Quml7xsNEntSBSP0taKKLZ7uhdcg2LErSG/eLus8N+e/s8YEe\n\ne5sDR5q/Zcx/ZSRppugUiVvkNPfFsBST9Wd7Onp44QFWVpGmE0KN0jxAnEzv0Ybf\n\nN1EbDKE79fGjSjXk4c6W3xt+v06X0BDoqAgwga8gC0MUxXRntDKCb42GwohAmTaD\n\nuh5AciIX11JlJHOwzu8Zza7/eGx7wBID1E5yDVBtO6M7o5lencjZDIWz2YrZVCbb\n\nbfqsu/8lTMTRefRx04ZAGBOwY7VyTjDEl4SGLVYv1xX3f8Cu9fxb5fuhutMCAwEA\n\nATANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFAAOCAQEAGjef4dfuIkF7MdfLs4x5KqzM4/5+h1lS+SWS\n\nojTaAuH2++1pGgVV4vfGB9QVxoTDkcp5wWjw184x+P19Fjio+ucUUOmFmD7BERXX\n\nV4NZMv/TwucAbRIb6/FRv13Koigi05tIhXesownpbMZq7p6I9P9GAd/Uu7XCMTPO\n\nUHpuTtNoI+tjwwBhZK0XXp5ORdHKWbXfLXQgiCXLPJntKdrRnUzJpXvYQzTeZKxf\n\n\n-----\n\np g g p\n\n-----END CERTIFICATE----\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----\nMIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAwwPRK/45pDJFO1PIhCsqfHSavaoqUgdH1qY2sgcyjtC6aXvG\n\nw0Se1IFI/S1oootnu6F1yDYsStIb94u6zw357+zxgR57mwNHmr9lzH9lJGmm6BSJ\n\nW+Q098WwFJP1Z3s6enjhAVZWkaYTQo3SPECcTO/Rht83URsMoTv18aNKNeThzpbf\n\nG36/TpfQEOioCDCBryALQxTFdGe0MoJvjYbCiECZNoO6HkByIhfXUmUkc7DO7xnN\n\nrv94bHvAEgPUTnINUG07ozujmV6dyNkMhbPZitlUJttt+qy7/yVMxNF59HHThkAY\n\nE7BjtXJOMMSXhIYtVi/XFfd/wK71/Fvl+6G60wIDAQABAoIBAQCi5thfEHFkCJ4u\n\nbdFtHoXSCrGMR84sUWqgEp5T3pFMHW3qWXvyd6rZxtmKq9jhFuRjJv+1bBNZuOOl\n\nyHIXLgyfb+VZP3ZvSbERwlouFikN3reO3EDVou7gHqH0vpfbhmOWFM2YCWAtMHac\n\nPM3miO5HknkLWgDiXl8RfH35CLcgBokqXf0AqyLh8LO8JKleJg4fAC3+IZpTW23T\n\nK6uUgmhDNtj2L8Yi/LVBXQ0zYOqkfX7oS1WRVtNcV48flBcvqt7pnqj0z4pMjqDk\n\nVnOyz0+GxWk88yQgi1yWDPprEjuaZ8HfxpaypdWSDZsJQmgkEEXUUOQXOUjQNYuU\n\nbRHej8pZAoGBAOokp/lpM+lx3FJ9iCEoL0neunIW6cxHeogNlFeEWBY6gbA/os+m\n\nbB6wBikAj+d3dqzbysfZXps/JpBSrvw4kAAUu7QPWJTnL2p+HE9BIdQxWR9OihqN\n\np1dsItjl9H4yphDLZKVVA4emJwWMw9e2J7JNujDaR49U0z2LhI2UmFilAoGBANU4\n\nG8OPxZMMRwtvNZLFsI1GyJIYj/WACvfvof6AubUqusoYsF2lB9CTjdicBBzUYo6m\n\nJoEB/86KKmM0NUCqbYDeiSNqV02ebq2TTlaQC22dc4sMric93k7wqsVseGdslFKc\n\nN2dsLe+7r9+mkDzER8+Nlp6YqbSfxaZQ3LPw+3QXAoGAXoMJYr26fKK/QnT1fBzS\n\nackEDYV+Pj0kEsMYe/Mp818OdmxZdeRBhGmdMvPNIquwNbpKsjzl2Vi2Yk9d3uWe\n\nCspTsiz3nrNrClt5ZexukU6SIPb8/Bbt03YM4ux/smkTa3gOWkZktF63JaBadTpL\n\n78c8Pvf9JrggxJkKmnO+wxkCgYEAukSTFKw0GTtfkWCs97TWgQU2UVM96GXcry7c\n\nYT7Jfbh/h/A7mwOCKTfOck4R1bHBDAegmZFKjX/sec/xObXphexi99p9vGRNIjwO\n\n\n-----\n\ng j j Q Q Q y\n\nf1/qiqs/2Spe81HSwjA34y2jdQ0eTSE01VdwXIm/cuxKbmjVzRh0M06MOkWP5pZA\n\n62P5GYY6Ud2JS7Dz+Z9dKJU4vjWrylznk1M0oUVdEzllQkahn831vw==\n\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----\n### Conclusion\n\nAs we can see, the Blockbuster campaign and the Lazarus group are still active and have\nshown a continued interest in cryptocurrencies and companies surrounding cryptocurrency.\nNumerous exchanges are believed to have been hacked by the Lazarus group and there has\nbeen a significant amount of money stolen by doing so. Since their efforts have been so\nsuccessful, it does not look like they will slow down anytime soon with these types of targets.\n\n### IoCs\n\nMalicious Document –\n6b424d75445b3dabfb9b20895d0a1ce1430066ce7f3fcd87aa41fa32260ff92d\n\n[RAT – f8b329fc1f4d50f5509a72c1f630155538f4d2c6e49b80ce4841fada6547c4bd](https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/ffb3993e-d646-42ad-8449-104d751cc17b)\n\n### C&Cs\n\n182.56.5.227\n\n222.122.31.115\n\n66.99.86.8\n\n210.61.8.12\n\n62.215.99.90\n\nBy Jay Rosenberg\nJay Rosenberg is a self-taught reverse engineer from a very young age (12 years\nold), specializing in Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis.
