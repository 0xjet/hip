For ransomware operations, the deposit is a clear\nstatement that they mean big business.\n\nTo gain the trust of potential partners and expand the operation, DarkSide deposited 22\nbitcoins on the popular hacker forum XSS. The wallet is managed by the site’s\nadministrator, which in this case acts as a guarantor for the gang and an arbitrator if a\ndispute occurs.\n\n\n-----\n\n[REvil ransomware last year deposited $1 million worth of Bitcoin to a different hacking](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-deposits-1-million-in-hacker-recruitment-drive/)\nforum to attract new recruits into the operation. This move showed that they trusted the\nforum administrator with the money and that there was plenty of money to be made.\n\nLast week, [DarkSide closed shop and informed affiliates that the decision came after losing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-servers-reportedly-seized-operation-shuts-down/)\n[access to their public-facing servers and it was \"due to the pressure from the US\" after the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-will-now-vet-targets-after-pipeline-cyberattack/)\nattack on Colonial Pipeline.\n\n## Unpaid debts\n\nDarkSide’s dissolving of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation was abrupt and\nclearly left some unfinished business. Five partners have complained that the operators\nowed them money from paid ransoms or from hacking services:\n\nThe first affiliate asking for claim states that they were the 'pentester' for an attack and\nwas owed 80% of the ransom payment. However, after the victim paid, the DarkSide\noperators stated they no longer had access to the funds and the affiliate could use the\ndeposit at XSS to receive payment\nThe second affiliate states that they had bitcoins left for them on the affiliate portal but\nhad to rush to their relatives before they could claim them\nA third affiliate states that they too were a 'pentester' and had a ransom payment right\nbefore the DarkSide operation shut down. This affiliate states they sent proof to the\nXSS admin\nA fourth affiliate states that they worked on corporate breaches but never received\ntheir last $150,000 payment\nThe fifth and final affiliate states that there was a $72,000 made to them on the\naffiliate portal but could not collect it before the operation closed due to health reasons\n\nIn the case of the first claim issued on March 14, the forum administrator who is acting as\narbitrator, approved compensation from DarkSide’s deposit. They also asked others to\ncome forward if they have cause.\n\nFour days later, the second claim appeared, followed by another three on March 19 and 20.\nNone of these received a reply from the forum administrator.\n\nDarkSide became known in August 2020 and became one of the most prolific ransomware\n[groups. In nine months, the operation made at least $90 million from ransoms.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-made-90-million-in-just-nine-months/)\n\nIn just one week, the gang collected about $9 million from two attacks: Colonial Pipeline\n[and German chemical distribution company Brenntag.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chemical-distributor-pays-44-million-to-darkside-ransomware/)\n\nEven if DarkSide shut down, there are still victims being extorted. Affiliates have received\nthe corresponding decryption keys to continue negotiations with victim companies\nseparately.\n\n\n-----\n\nh/t [3xp0rt](https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[DarkSide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/darkside/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
