Ex-Trend Micro Intern.\n\n16 minute read\n\n## RedLine in a Nutshell\n\n\nSeptember 27, 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nRedLine is a newly emerging infostealer. An infostealer malware is designed to gather\ninformation, and steal valuable assets from an infected system. The most common form of\ninfostealer is to gather login information, like usernames and passwords. RedLine was first being\nnoticed at 2020 via COVID-19 phishing emails, and has been active in 2021. RedLine is almost\neverywhere, and has appeared variously as trojanized services, games, and cracks. RedLine is\nused for extensive information stealing operations, like: credit card credentials, Crypto wallets,\nsensitive files, etc. Furthermore, RedLine also can be used as malware loader or dropper for\nextended malicious impact. For instance, it can be used to infect the victim with additional\nmalwares like ransomwares. The RedLine malware family has been distributed and sold mostly\nvia underground malware forums. Many samples of RedLine also appear with legit-looking digital\ncertificates. RedLine is considered as one of the most serious threats that are currently in the\nwild, therefore it is a must to know how it works, how to detect it, and how to protect your\norganization.\n\n## RedLine Infection Vector\n\nRedLine is extremely versatile, and has been noted being delivered by numerous mechanisms. It\nis used in multiple smaller campaigns by individuals who have purchased the malware from the\nunderground malware forums. Due to this, there are a wide range of known infection vectors.\nOnly few of them are stated below:\n\nTrojanized as popular services: Telegram, Signal, Discord (i.e. legit-looking installers).\nEmail phishing campaigns.\nAbusing Google Ads while hosting Trojanized or fake websites.\nSocial engineering campaigns to attack digital artists using Non-Fungible Tokens.\nDownloaded by malware loaders.\n\n## Technical Summary\n\n1. Configuration Extraction: RedLine comes with embedded configuration, in this variant,\n\nthe configuration is Base64 encoded plus an additional layer of XOR encryption with hardcoded key. These configuration contains the C&C server and the malware Botnet ID, which\nit will communicate with to exfiltrate gathered information, and also for further remote\ncommands.\n2. C2 Communication: After extracting the C&C and before doing anything, RedLine will\n\ncheck if there is a possibility to reach its C&C server. If there is an available connection,\nRedLine will then try to obtain the malicious Scan Settings. These scan arguments contain\nflags that will be used to determine which information to be stolen. Moreover, the obtained\nscan arguments contain tuning parameters, to specify desired data assets. For instance,\nsearch patterns to specify certain files to be exfiltrated, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Host Profiling: RedLine will gather information about the infected host, in order to decide\n\nfurther actions. Mostly relying on Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), it harvests\nand generates the following information: Hardware ID, Usernames, OS version, Installed\nlanguages, Installed programs, Current running processes, Anti-malware products,\nGraphics card info, Victim’s Location, IP address, etc. In addition to all these, RedLine\ncontains functions to exclude Blacklisted countries as well as Blocked IPs from infection.\n4. Information Stealing: Here lies the bulk of its functionality. As being an information stealer,\n\nbased on the obtained scan arguments, RedLine can exfiltrates the following information:\n\nFiles: Any specified files in the following directories: `ProgramData, Program Files,`\n```\n      Program Files (x86) .\n\n```\nBrowsers: Login credentials, Cookies, Auto-fill fields used by websites, and Credit\ncard details.\nCrypto Wallets: Credentials of: Armory, Exodus, Ethereum, Monero, Atomic,\nBinanceChain, and a lot more.\nVPN Clients: Credentials of the following VPN clients: NordVPN, ProtonVPN, and\nOpenVPN.\nGaming Clients: It’s targeting the credentials of the famous Valve’s Steam gaming\nplatform.\nInstant Messengers: Currently it’s targeting Telegram session data and Discord\ntokens.\nFTP Clients: Credentials of FileZilla FTP client.\n5. Remote Execution: After successful data exfiltration, RedLine will try to obtain additional\n\nremote commands to execute within the infected machine. Going beyond information\nstealing, RedLine is able to perform the following remote actions:\n\nDownload additional files.\nDownload and execute PE files (i.e. additional malware like ransomware).\nOpen desired links (i.e. malicious websites).\nExecute remote commands via `CMD.exe .`\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n First look & Unpacking\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure(1): Results are at 2021-09-20 18:03:15 UTC. Different results may appear.\n\nThis sample comes -in disguise- as packed C/C++ file, which will be responsible to unpack and\nexpose the real RedLine malware. However, the initial packed file as you can see in the last\n[figure is flagged malicious by 20 security vendors according to VirusTotal. For simplicity sake, I’ve](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1d91ab82e01d7682deecbeef7b441f26e405c0053e0354e92fdb5cfe61b097b0/detection/f-1d91ab82e01d7682deecbeef7b441f26e405c0053e0354e92fdb5cfe61b097b0-1632160995)\n[decided to use UnpacMe to do the unpacking process. The final unpacked file is found to a .NET](https://www.unpac.me/results/159ed23f-5cdf-4183-8131-d95e61932a9d#/)\napplication, which is the real RedLine malware that I will analyze in details. I’ve decided to focus\non RedLine data structures, to properly understand which & how data is being exfiltrated.\n\n## Configuration Extraction\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure(2): RedLine code entry point.\n\nRedLine begins with hiding its UI from the infected user. It dynamically resolves\n```\nGetConsoleWindow() and ShowWindow() APIs do that. RedLine calls ShowWindow() with\n\n```\nthe parameter `SW_HIDE=0 to effectively hide its window.`\n\nFigure(3): The function used for decrypting the embedded configuration.\n\nThen, it uses the `Decrypt() function to extract the embedded encrypted configuration. For this`\nparticular sample, the decrypted C&C is `\"188.124.36.242:25802\" and the decrypted Botnet`\nID is `\"paladin\" . The Botent ID is being used to track the malware and to better identify the`\ninfected machines.\n\n## C2 Communication\n\nAfter successfully extracting the C&C IP address, RedLine will check if it can reach the C&C\nserver using the functions `RequestConnection() and` `TryGetConnection() . If there is an`\navailable connection, RedLine will then try to obtain the malicious Scan Settings using the\nfunction `TryGetArgs() . These settings simply represents the full arsenal of RedLine, and what`\ncapabilities it possess. The available scan settings are below:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure(4): For simplicity sake, this screenshot is taken using Sublime and not dnSpy in order to\nshow only the useful code.\n\nThese scan arguments contain flags that will be used to determine which information to be\nstolen. Each flag is used in certain functions to decide whether to perform the scanning\nfunctionality or not -I will show examples in a moment. Moreover, the obtained scan arguments\ncontain tuning parameters, to specify desired data assets. For instance, they contain search\npatterns to specify files to be exfiltrated, paths for locating certain browsers, or a list of Blacklisted\ncountries to exclude from infection, etc. After getting the scanning arguments (settings), RedLine\nproceeds to preform its main purpose, which is information stealing.\n\n## Information Stealing\n\nFigure(5): The functions names & lots of code were obfuscated to make reverse engineering\nharder.\n\nRedLine contains many functions to collect and harvest almost every valuable asset in the\ninfected machine. Some of these functions are very simple, regarding the purpose and the\nimplementation. For instance, `Enumerate_username(),` `Get_Malware_Path(),`\n```\nEnumerate_OS_Version(),etc.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nYet, before proceeding to the scanning functionality once again, RedLine instantiates very\nimportant data structures, which will be populated with the stolen assets and the gathered host\nprofile. Below are the two important classes `ScanResult and` `ScanDetails :`\n\nFigure(6): The rest of the customized classes will be discussed in the coming sections.\n\nFor instance, Specified files by the scanning arguments will be populated into `ScannedFile`\nclass in order to be exfiltrated and so on. The `scannedFile class is included in the bigger`\n```\nScanDetails class, which is also included in the bigger ScanResult class. It’s very important\n\n```\nto understand the hierarchy of these nested classes, to draw a map of how the precious data\nassets are being organized and stolen from the infected machine.\n\n### Host Profiling\n\nRedLine contains more than 20 functions to perform almost full sweeping of the infected\nmachine. Some of them are fairly simple, they just perform windows registry querying or they use\ndocumented APIs. For instance, since Microsoft Edge is the default browser, the\n```\nEnumerate_Browsers() function searches the registry keys\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Clients\\StartMenuInternet and its WoW6432 twin to find\n\n```\nthe installed browsers, in order to harvest their credentials later on. The\n```\nEnumerate_Installed_Software() function uses the registry key\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall to list every installed\n\n```\nsoftware in the system. Also, RedLine uses the `Take_Screenshots() functions to take live`\nscreenshots of the infected system.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure(7): Concatinating the WMI query for the ManagementObjectSearcher class instance.\n\nMoreover, the `Enumerate_Security_Defenders() function uses the WMI to enumerate any`\ninstalled security solution. It allows it to get the installed Antivirus, AntiSpyware and Firewall (third\nparty) software using the `root\\SecurityCenter or the` `root\\SecurityCenter2`\nnamespaces.\n\nNot to forget, the `Enumerate_Running_Processess() function which also uses the`\n```\nWin32_Process WMI class that represents a process on an operating system. It gets the\n\n```\nprocess name + PID + command line arguemtns in order to build a live full view of the infected\nmachine. I think the attacker uses these information to decide further malicious actions i.e.\ncertain exploits.\n\nFigure(8): The if-statements control wether to stop the infection or not.\n\n\n-----\n\nLastly, one more interesting function is the `Send() function which contains the above method. It`\nuses the following remote API `https://api.ip.sb/geoip to gather very detailed geographical`\ninformation about the victim. The remote API returns XML data specifying many detailed\ninformation:\n```\n{\"organization\":\"XXXXXXXX\",\"longitude\":XXXXXXX,\"city\":\"XXXXXX\",\"timezone\":\"XXXXXX\",\"isp\":\"\n\n### Exfiltrating Files\n\n```\nFigure(9): The contents of the file is being automatically read when the constructor is called with\nthe filename string parameter.\n\nIt’s important to know the inner structures of the `ScannedFile class which is used to populate`\nthe exfiltrated files. As you can see in the above screenshot, once a file is being instantiated,\nnearly all of its important contents is stolen.\n\nFigure(10): The function shows the concatination of the searching paths.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the obtained scan arguments (settings) during the previous C2 communication, they\ncontain search patterns to specify desired files to be stolen. RedLine currently use the search\npatterns to locate files in the following directories only: `Program Files (X86)/,` `Program`\n```\nFiles/, and Program Data/ . The directory ProgramData/ is for user-agnostic data\n\n```\ngenerated during execution such as shared cache, shared databases, shared settings, shared\npreferences, etc.\n\nFigure(11): Once a ScannedFile instance is instantiated with a filename, all of the file contents is\nread.\n\nRedLine only needs to locate the specified files based on the search patterns then create a\n```\nScannedFile instance of the filtered filename. Once instantiated with the filename, almost all of\n\n```\nthe file contents is stolen because of the `ScannedFile constructor code.`\n\n### Harvesting Browsers\n\nFigure(12): The collected data about the targeted browser.\n\nAlso, It’s very important to know the inner structures of the `Browser class, which is used to`\npopulate the harvested browser credentials. Once a browser is targeted, RedLine steals its\naccounts credentials, credit card credentials, cookies, and auto-fill data. RedLine targets\nChromium based browsers as well as Gecko based browsers, which makes RedLine nearly\ntargets most used browsers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure(13): Notice the passed scanning settings which were obtained by the C2 communication.\n\nFigure(14): Populating the Browser class.\n\nRedLine also uses more methods like `DecryptChromium() in order to effectively harvest the`\ntargeted credentials. It’s also being noticed that for Gecko based browsers, this sample only\nsteals the cookies unlike the targeted Chromium based browsers.\n\n### Stealing Crypto Wallets\n\nA crypto wallet is an application used to both cold store and retrieve digital cryptocurrency assets.\nRedLine of course targets these valuable assets because of the rise of people’s interest in\ncryptocurrency during the past few years.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure(15): The AllWallets class is used for generic crypto wallets.\n\nRedLine comes with many classes targeting many crypto wallets like: Armory, Exodus,\nEthereum, Monero, Atomic, BinanceChain, Jaxx, Electrum, Guarda, etc. RedLine uses predefined search patterns and scan arguments to populate the wallets into `ScannedFile`\ninstances. Each class in the previous figure is just used to initialize defined search patterns to be\npassed to the regular `Search() function which is used in files exfiltration.`\n\nFigure(16): Overriding the GetScanArgs function with new search patterns.\n\nThese search patterns specify the credentials files which is being used for the specific wallet\ntype. For every wallet class, it is used to override the `GetScanArgs() function which is used`\ninternally in the `Search() function in order to filter for the appropriate wallet files. These filtered`\nfiles will be exfiltrated.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Harvesting Instant Messenger Clients\n\nInstant Messenger (IM) clients like Discord and Telegram have seen a recent rise in popularity,\nwith Discord boasting over 100 million active users. For Telegram, RedLine looks used the\n```\nGetProcessesByName() function to get the ExecutablePath for Telegram running process.\n\n```\nThen, it looks for the folder `tdata . This is where the Instant Messenger stores its session data,`\nincluding images and conversations:\n\nFigure(17): The function is passed the Telegram process name.\n\nIt’s also used to override the `GetScanArgs() function which is used internally in the` `Search()`\nfunction in order to filter for the targeted files.\n\nFor Discord, RedLine is stealing its tokens using the `Discord.GetTokens() function. A Discord`\ntoken is a phrase of letters and numbers that acts as an authorization code to access Discord’s\nservers. It effectively acts as an encryption of your username and password.\n\n### Snatching VPN Clients Credentials\n\nWith the rise in popularity in VPN services, RedLine doesn’t have any plans to miss this chance.\nRedLine targets the VPN clients of the following services: NordVPN, OpenVPN, and ProtonVPN.\nFor NordVPN client, RedLine uses obfuscated strings to locate the targeted XML files which\ncontain the VPN credentials:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure(18): This method of strings obfuscation is almost used everywhere in RedLine classes.\n\nThen, it uses decrypting functions to decipher the wanted credentials:\n\nFigure(19): The CryptoHelper class is used for various decryption and encryption operations\nwithin RedLine.\n\nYet, for OpenVPN and ProtonVPN, RedLine uses the same old method of overriding the\n```\nGetScanArgs() function which is used internally in the Search() function in order to filter for\n\n```\nthe targeted files. Then, it exfiltrates the filtered files as `ScannedFile instances which contains`\nthe VPN credentials.\n\n### Harvesting Gaming Clients\n\n[Steam is a video game digital distribution service by Valve. By 2019, the service had over 34,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation)\ngames with over 95 million monthly active users. Steam is regarded as one of the best gaming\nplatforms in the industry. Steam has an in-built store with a lot of ‘Steam accounts’ having various\nother services and banking details related to it. RedLine attempts to go after the Steam Sentry\nFile which is used to store credentials:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure(20): RedLine overrides the GetScanArgs() function with defined search patterns. Then,\nexfiltrate the targeted files.\n\nA VDF file is a data file format used by Valve’s Source game engine. It contains various kinds of\ngame metadata, including data for resources, installation scripts, configuration scripts, and\nvisualization elements.\n\n### Stealing FTP Credentials\n\nA File Transfer Protocol client (FTP client) is a software utility that establishes a connection\nbetween a host computer and a remote server, typically an FTP server. An FTP client provides\nthe dual-direction transfer of data and files between two computers over a TCP network or an\nInternet connection.\n\nFigure(21): RedLine checks the existance of two different paths to locate the targeted credentials.\n\nRedLine targets the free, open-source FileZilla application. RedLine uses the\n```\nScanCredentials() function to extract the required credentials and to populate them in\nAccount class which will contain the URL + username + password.\n\n## Remote Execution\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nRedLine extends its functionality beyond information stealing. Here, RedLine takes the role of a\nmalware loader. A malware loader is the software which drops the actual malicious content on\nthe system, then executes the first stage of the attack. Hence, RedLine is capable of delivering\nsome additional serious threats to the infected machine, like ransomwares for example. After\nsuccessfully performing the information stealing operations, RedLine uses the `TryGetTasks()`\nfunction to obtain a list of `UpdateTask class, which contains the required arguments to`\nsuccessfully perform remote execution actions:\n\nFigure(22): The availabe remote actions aka update tasks.\n\nOnce a connection with its C&C server has been established, RedLine can remotely perform the\noperations described in the above figure. Below are the inner details of the\n```\nDownloadAndExecuteUpdate class which is used -as the name suggests- to download a PE file\n\n```\nand executes it in the infected machine:\n\nFigure(23): The passed argument consists of the malicious URL + the filename.\n\nRedLine can be used effectively as malware loader or dropper for further wanted malicious\nactivities. Moreover, it can be used to open desired links for various malicious or non-malicious\npurposes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nRedLine is regarded as a true security threat to any machine. The capabilities of being able to\nsteal almost every valuable asset, and being able to load additional serious malwares or exploits\nare regarded most fatal. This threat has been sold as individual packages with several pricing\noptions, or as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) on a subscription-based pricing package. With the\nrise of Maas underground forums, RedLine threats will not fade away in the very near future.\nTherefore, it is a must to know how it works, how to detect it, and how to protect your\norganization.\n\n## IoCs\n\n**No.** **Description** **Value**\n\n\n1 Initial\npacked file\n\n2 Unpacked\nRedLine\n\n3 RedLine\nC&C server\n\n## YARA Rule\n\n\n1d91ab82e01d7682deecbeef7b441f26e405c0053e0354e92fdb5cfe61b097b0\n\ne9905446c858326e8f0fe12f6df777542180608381f1ccae4bda9a8356b04abc\n\n188.124.36.242:25802\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule redline : infostealer\n{\n     meta:\n          description = \"This is a noob rule for detecting unpacked RedLine\"\n          author = \"Nidal Fikri @cyber_anubis\"\n     strings:\n          $mz = {4D 5A} //PE File\n          $s1 = \"IRemoteEndpoint\"\n          $s2 = \"ITaskProcessor\"\n          $s3 = \"ScannedFile\"\n          $s4 = \"ScanningArgs\"\n          $s5 = \"ScanResult\"\n          $s6 = \"DownloadAndExecuteUpdate\"\n          $s7 = \"OpenUpdate\"\n          $s8 = \"CommandLineUpdate\"\n          $s9 = \"TryCompleteTask\"\n          $s10 = \"TryGetTasks\"\n          $s11 = \"TryInitBrowsers\"\n          $s12 = \"InstalledBrowsers\"\n          $s13 = \"TryInitInstalledBrowsers\"\n          $s14 = \"TryInitInstalledSoftwares\"\n          $s15 = \"TryGetConnection\"\n     condition:\n     ($mz at 0) and (10 of ($s*))\n}\n\n## References\n\n```\n[https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/threat-thursday-redline-infostealer](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/threat-thursday-redline-infostealer)\n\n\n-----",
