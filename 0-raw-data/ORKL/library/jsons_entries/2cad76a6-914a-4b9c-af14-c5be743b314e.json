During the investigation,\n\n\n-----\n\nCTU™ researchers discovered a previously unidentified BEC group that they have named\nGOLD GALLEON.\n\nUnlike other BEC groups, GOLD GALLEON does not target a wide range of businesses but\nappears to focus solely on global maritime shipping businesses and their customers. CTU\nresearchers estimate that between June 2017 and January 2018, GOLD GALLEON\nattempted to steal a minimum of $3.9 million U.S. dollars from maritime shipping businesses\nand their customers. The threat actors' theft attempts average $6.7 million per year.\n\nBEC is a social engineering scheme where threat actors gain access to a business's email\naccount. The actors typically use spearphishing emails with attached malicious payloads to\nsteal the email credentials of individuals responsible for handling business transactions.\nOnce the threat actors have obtained these credentials, they can intercept emails between\nthe two parties involved in a transaction and modify financial documents to direct funds to\nattacker-controlled bank accounts. BEC and BES scams might seem unsophisticated, but\nthey continue to account for significant losses globally. For example, the FBI [reported that](https://www.ic3.gov/media/2017/170504.aspx)\nBEC and BES accounted for estimated losses of $5.3 billion between October 2013 and\nDecember 2016.\n\n## Key points\n\nGOLD GALLEON is a BEC threat group likely based in Nigeria.\nThe group targets maritime shipping organizations, including companies that provide\nship management services, port services, and cash to master[1] services.\nCompanies involved in shipping industries are typically globally dispersed and operate\nin different time zones, meaning that they are often entirely reliant on email for\nconducting business transactions. Some maritime shipping businesses are therefore\nsusceptible to BEC fraud methods.\nThe group uses a range of commodity remote access tools that have keylogging and\npassword-stealing functionality to steal email account credentials.\nThe group routinely tests malware on its own systems and tracks detection rates via\nonline virus scanners (e.g., NoDistribute).\nAs of this publication, CTU researchers have helped to interrupt multiple GOLD\nGALLEON fraud attempts, averting losses of more than $800,000.\n\n## Who is GOLD GALLEON?\n\nOver the course of the investigation into GOLD GALLEON, CTU researchers have been able\nto develop unique and detailed insight into the threat group: how it operates, where it is\nbased, and its likely affiliations. GOLD GALLEON is a collection of at least 20 criminal\nassociates that collectively carry out BEC campaigns. The group appears to specifically\ntarget maritime organizations and their customers CTU researchers have observed GOLD\n\n\n-----\n\nGALLEON targeting firms in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Philippines, Norway, U.S.,\nEgypt, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia. The threat actors leverage tools, tactics, and procedures\n(TTPs) that are similar to those used by other BEC/BES groups that CTU researchers\n[previously investigated (e.g., GOLD SKYLINE). The groups have used the same caliber of](https://www.secureworks.com/research/wire-wire-a-west-african-cyber-threat)\npublicly available malware (inexpensive and commodity remote access trojans (RATs)),\ncrypters, and email lures.\n\nThe group appears to have a loose organizational structure, with activities coordinated by\nseveral senior individuals. Tasks are allocated to individuals in the group; for example, one\ngroup member may have responsibility for obfuscating the group's RATs with crypters, while\nothers are tasked with monitoring victims' email for business transactions that are about to\nbe invoiced. Some senior members often handle the purchasing of malware, crypters, and\ninfrastructure, and they frequently experiment with alternative tools. CTU researchers also\nobserved senior members coaching and mentoring less-experienced group members and\nliaising with external providers of related criminal services (e.g., suppliers of mule accounts\nfor transferring stolen funds and crypter sellers; see Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1. Organizational diagram of GOLD GALLEON threat group. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nGOLD GALLEON uses the [Hide My Ass! (HMA) proxy and similar privacy services to](https://www.hidemyass.com/en-us/index)\ndisguise its origin. Several data points identified by CTU researchers suggest that it is highly\nlikely that GOLD GALLEON is based in Nigeria:\n\nVisibility of the actors' systems suggest that many were regularly connecting to the\nInternet via Nigeria-based infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe GOLD GALLEON crewmembers communicate regularly using instant messenger\nservices such as Skype. Observed conversations between crewmembers were in\nNigerian Pidgin English (see Figure 2). Pidgin is a simplified form of speech that is\nusually a mixture of two or more languages, has a rudimentary grammar and\nvocabulary, and is used for communication between groups speaking different\nlanguages. Appendix A shows additional examples of Nigerian Pidgin phrases\ncommonly used by GOLD GALLEON.\n\n_Figure 2. Example of conversation between the group leader and a crewmember._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\nCTU researchers' visibility of the group's usernames, passwords, and other artifacts\nsuggest a strong link between members of GOLD GALLEON and a popular fraternity in\nNigeria dubbed the Buccaneer Confraternity (see Appendix B).\n\n\n-----\n\n### Links to the Buccaneer Confraternity\n\nMany of the GOLD GALLEON conversations observed by CTU researchers used phrases,\nusernames, and passwords that linked to the Buccaneer Confraternity group. Keywords such\nas \"awumen,\" \"alora,\" \"Sealords,\" and \"1972buccaneer\" in context reference the\nconfraternity. One GOLD GALLEON actor also used a Buccaneers Confraternity logo on an\nonline account (see Figure 3).\n\n_Figure 3. Variant of the Buccaneers Confraternity logo. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n[The Buccaneers Confraternity was originally established to support human rights and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights) social\njustice in Nigeria. Reports suggest that a small subset of the group (often referred to as a\n[cult) may engage in criminality, which offers a potential explanation for GOLD GALLEON's](https://guardian.ng/news/akwa-ibom-bans-more-than-30-cult-groups)\napparent links to the Buccaneer Confraternity movement.\n\n## How does GOLD GALLEON operate?\n\nGOLD GALLEON displays similar tradecraft to other Nigerian-based BEC groups observed\nby CTU researchers. The group follows a common operational pattern often relying on lowtier, free, or inexpensive tools. What it lacks in technical prowess is made up for in social\nengineering, agility, and persistence. Despite technical challenges and minimal investments\nin cybercrime tools, infrastructure, and automation, the group's profit margins are orders of\nmagnitude greater than its initial investment.\n\n### Reconnaissance\n\n\n-----\n\nCTU researchers assess that GOLD GALLEON identifies target email addresses by\nconducting reconnaissance of publicly available contact information (e.g., a company's\nwebsite). The actors may leverage commercially available marketing tools that scrape email\naddresses from company websites (e.g., Email Extractor, BoxxerMail). CTU researchers\nfound evidence that suggests these threat actors occasionally purchase email lists of target\nbusinesses. In order to acquire new victims after gaining entry into a target's inbox, the threat\nactors use a free tool called EmailPicky to extract the target's contacts from their address\nbook, as well as every email address with which the target has had an exchange. Many of\nthe harvested contacts are in the maritime shipping industry, so this tactic can be extremely\nfruitful for the threat actors.\n\n### Attacker TTPs/attribution\n\nSimilar to other BEC threat groups, GOLD GALLEON uses spearphishing emails with\nmalicious attachments to compromise its victims (see Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4. GOLD GALLEON crewmember crafting a phishing email. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe spearphishing emails are created with the intended recipient in mind, in this case\nfocusing on shipping topics. When opened, attachments deploy a RAT that has keylogging\nand password-stealing functionality. Tools deployed by GOLD GALLEON include the\nPredator Pain, PonyStealer, Agent Tesla, and HawkEye keyloggers. All of the malware\nleveraged by GOLD GALLEON is readily available from online hacking markets. For\nexample, the cost for the Agent Tesla RAT is between $12 and $69, depending on the\nsupport levels provided (see Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Agent Tesla malware service-level tiers. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### Actions on objectives\n\nOnce the GOLD GALLEON crew compromises the business email accounts of a company's\nemployees, crewmembers monitor the employees' inboxes to identify emails for ongoing\nbusiness transactions. In a typical BEC scam (see Figure 6), an attacker compromises a\nseller's email account to position themselves as a \"man-in-the-middle\" between the seller\nand a buyer in an existing business transaction. The threat actor then uses their control of\nthe seller's account to passively monitor the transaction. When it is time for payment details\nto be relayed to the buyer via an invoice, the threat actor intercepts the seller's email and\nchanges the destination bank account on the invoice to the attacker's money mule account. If\nthe revised payment account does not appear to be suspicious, the buyer will likely submit\nthe payment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Typical BEC process. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCTU researchers observed GOLD GALLEON threat actors successfully submitting\nfraudulent invoices to buyers while a business transaction was in progress. The altered\ninvoices were modified from genuine versions created by the seller that were available in the\nseller's email account. The threat actors were in control of the seller's email account and\nwere monitoring email traffic, but the buyer was not likely to question the invoice because it\nappeared to contain correct and familiar information. Only the bank details where the money\nwas to be wired were changed.\n\n**Cloned domains and look-alike email addresses**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to impersonate a buyer or seller in a particular transaction, GOLD GALLEON and\nother BEC groups have purchased domains that closely resemble the buyer or seller's\ncompany name, also known as \"cloning.\" CTU researchers have also observed BEC threat\nactors registering email accounts that contain a variation of the target's name (e.g., john .\ndoe @ gmail . com or jdoe @ gmail . com. With these look-alike domains and/or email\naddresses in hand, the cybercriminals can impersonate either party.\n\n## Disrupting the adversary — Incident case studies\n\nThe cybersecurity industry clearly has a role to play in disrupting these threats. While\ninvestigating the activities of GOLD GALLEON and another BEC group conducting fraud\nagainst the shipping industry, CTU researchers were able to interrupt dozens of BEC fraud\nattempts. Victim notifications prevented some fraudulent transfers, and identification of\nattacker-controlled accounts enabled banks to stop fraudulent use.\n\nThe following case studies offer additional insight into GOLD GALLEON's methods and also\nhighlight some of the challenges when disrupting these threats.\n\n### Case study 1: Thanks, but we already know… we just don't know how.\n\nOne of the companies that GOLD GALLEON compromised was a shipping company based\nin South Korea. The threat actors were able to steal credentials for eight different email\naccounts, including an account for one of the company's accountants. With this access,\nGOLD GALLEON targeted all of the company's clients. The threat actors monitored the\nSouth Korean company's business email day and night and became very familiar with the\ncompany's billing cycles, clients, and various business deals.\n\nNot long after CTU researchers began tracking GOLD GALLEON, the threat actors were\nmonitoring a business transaction where the South Korean shipping company was\nrequesting \"cash to master\" (CTM) services for a ship arriving in the U.S. The South Korean\ncompany sent an email to the U.S.-based CTM organization requesting delivery of the\napproximately $50,000 in crew's wages and clarification of the total payout fee (see Figure\n7).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Cash to master (CTM) request from the South Korean ship management company._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nTo insert themselves into the transaction, GOLD GALLEON threat actors set up an Outlook\nemail account using the name of an employee working for the CTM company and sent a\nfraudulent email. The message requested that the South Korean company submit payment\nto the CTM's \"subsidiary [bank] account,\" because the CTM was purportedly working to\nresolve an issue with their regular bank regarding extra fees (see Figure 8). The provided\naccount details were for a mule account used by GOLD GALLEON.\n\n_Figure 8. GOLD GALLEON actors impersonating a shipping agent to coerce the South_\n_Korean ship management company into diverting funds to the attacker-controlled bank_\n_account. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n\n-----\n\nAware that the South Korean company was potentially about to send $50,000 to the threat\ngroup and not to the intended provider of ship services, CTU researchers notified the U.S.\ncompany as quickly as possible. Separately, the South Korean shipping company had been\nin touch with the U.S. shipping agent to verify that the subsidiary account payment details\nwere correct, so the U.S. shipping agent was already aware of the fraud attempt. However,\nthe agent did not know how the South Korean company had received the altered bank\naccount details. CTU researchers were able to complete the picture for them.\n\n### Case study 2: If at first you don't succeed…\n\nWhen CTU researchers detected the GOLD GALLEON crew attempting to defraud another\none of the South Korean company's clients for $325,585, they notified the potential victim.\nThe client, a large Japanese company with clients in the Far East and the Southeast Asian\nregions, provides marine transportation of petroleum products, chemicals, and other liquids.\nCTU researchers notified the Japanese company and explained the ongoing fraud attempt.\nThe company was aware of the situation, as they judged that the payment request was\nsuspicious. Despite the failed attempt, the GOLD GALLEON actors repeated their attempt\nusing a forged invoice on the South Korean company's letterhead.\n\nThis was a common tactic the GOLD GALLEON crew used to try and fool the clients of the\nSouth Korean shipping company. The GOLD GALLEON threat actors were able to obtain a\ncopy of the Korean shipping company's corporate letterhead by impersonating the Japanese\nmarine transportation company. They stated in their email request that they needed to\npresent it to their bank to process payment for the South Korean company's services (see\nFigure 9). The South Korean company obliged and sent them an electronic copy, which the\nthreat actors continued using for future spoofed correspondence with many of the company's\nclients.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Spoofed email from GOLD GALLEON requesting official company letterhead of a_\n_South Korean shipping company for use in future fraud schemes. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### Case study 3: Third time's a charm\n\nA week after the fraud attempt on the Japanese marine transportation company, CTU\nresearchers detected GOLD GALLEON attempting to steal $234,834 owed to the South\nKorean shipping company by another client: a large multinational Japanese conglomerate. In\nresponse, CTU researchers notified both parties, as well as the bank where the mule\naccount due to receive the stolen funds was located.\n\nGOLD GALLEON had used the spoofed email address of the South Korean company's\naccountant and sent a request to the Japanese conglomerate on the company letterhead to\nremit payment of the $234,834 to the attacker-controlled bank account. In this particular\ninstance, the Japanese conglomerate was suspicious when they received the request to\nchange payment to an alternate bank account. However, only with the additional context\nprovided from the CTU researchers' notification were they able to understand the full nature\nof the risks they were facing.\n\nAdditionally, CTU researchers reached out to the South Korean CERT (KN-CERT) so it in\nturn could notify the South Korean company of the nefarious activity and help them mitigate\nthe threat on their network. KN-CERT also helped the South Korean shipping company\nimplement security measures to monitor and help protect their business email from being\ncompromised in a similar way in the future.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nBy disclosing details of the GOLD GALLEON threat, its capabilities, and its approach to\nconducting BEC-related fraud, CTU researchers are trying to provide a greater\nunderstanding of the BEC threat and why these campaigns continue to be so lucrative. As\nevidenced in this report, the monetary losses can be significant to the victims and the\naffected businesses. In some cases, the victims are unaware of what is happening until it is\ntoo late. Organizations in some industries (in this case shipping) may be exposed to\nheightened risk as threat actors focus their attempts toward industries that are more\nsusceptible to these techniques. CTU researchers encourage organizations to evaluate the\nBEC threat in the context of their own systems and consider the following steps to mitigate\nthe risks associated with BEC:\n\nImplement two-factor authentication (2FA) for corporate and personal email. Small and\nmedium-sized businesses (SMBs) are popular targets for BEC groups because SMBs\ntypically have limited security budgets. Most BEC threat actors rely on remote access\nto a company's email via commodity webmail programs, so 2FA would deter all but the\nmost sophisticated attackers.\nInspect the corporate email control panel for suspicious redirect rules. An unexplained\nredirect rule that sends incoming email from specific addresses to third-party systems\ncould indicate a compromise and should trigger an organization's incident response\nprocess.\nCarefully review wire transfer information in suppliers' email requests to identify\nsuspicious details.\nAlways confirm wire transfer instructions with designated suppliers using a previously\nestablished non-email mode of communication, such as a fax number or phone\nnumber. Establish this communication channel using a method other than email.\nRequire multiple approvals for wire transfers, and ensure this procedure is difficult for\ncybercriminals to discover.\nQuestion any changes to typical business practices and designated wire transfer\nactivity (e.g., a business contact suddenly asking to be contacted via their personal\nemail address or a change to an organization's designated bank account information).\nBe suspicious of pressure to take action quickly and of promises to apply large price\ndiscounts on future orders if payment is made immediately.\nThoroughly check email addresses for accuracy and watch for small changes that\nmimic legitimate addresses, such as the addition, removal, substitution, or duplication\nof single characters in the address or hostname (e.g., username@example.com versus\nusername@ examp1e.com).\nCreate detection rules that flag emails with extensions that are similar to company\nemail addresses (e.g., abc_company versus abc-company).\nLimit the information that employees post to social media and to the company website,\nespecially information about job duties and descriptions, management hierarchy, and\nout-of-office details.\n[Consider adopting the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) standards to](http://www.finra.org/)\ndeter money laundering and fraudulent wire transfers.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Consider using the free pdfxpose tool that CTU researchers developed to help detect](https://github.com/secureworks/pdfxpose)\nwire-wire fraud. CTU analysis of GOLD SKYLINE activity revealed that the threat\nactors edited PDF invoice files by redacting the original payment details with a white\nopaque rectangle and then overlaying it with the money mule account information. This\ntool searches for sub-page-sized opaque rectangles with text overlays and adjusts the\nopacity and color to reveal potentially suspicious edits.\n\n## Appendix A — Nigerian Pidgin conversations\n\n_Figure 10.

(Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## Appendix B — The Buccaneers Confraternity\n\nThe Buccaneers Confraternity is a descendant of the Pyrates Confraternity group (also\nknown as the [National Association of Seadogs). According to historical records, the Pyrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Seadogs)\nConfraternity was founded in 1952 by Nobel-prize winning author Wole Soyinka and six of\nhis friends (see Figure 13). The first chapter was formed on the campus of University College\nIbadan, a prestigious institution and one of the oldest universities in Nigeria. The\nconfraternity was conceived as a response to class privilege, elitism, and other perceived\nsocial injustices against poorer students at the university. Membership was open to male\n\n\n-----\n\nstudents who were academically bright, regardless of their tribe or religion. The anti[establishment group adopted the motto \"Against all conventions\" and the classic Jolly Roger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolly_Roger)\nskull and crossbones pirate flag as its logo. Members went by names such as \"Cap'n Blood\"\nand \"Long John Silver.\" The organization's ceremonies and customs revolve heavily around\npirate symbology. The Pyrates Confraternity became the only confraternity on Nigerian\ncampuses for almost 20 years.\n\n_Figure 13. The \"Original Seven\" founding members of the Pyrates Confraternity in pirate_\n_costumes. (Source: https://www.nas-int.org/about-nas/history)_\n\nIn 1972, a schism took place when Pyrate Bolaji Carew led a \"mutiny\" against the\nconfraternity. Dissatisfied with the conduct of the organization, he and several other\nmembers formed a rival group known as the Buccaneers Confraternity, borrowing many of\nthe structures, ceremonies, and symbology from the Pyrates Confraternity. Because of this\nfracture, the Pyrates registered the name \"National Association of Seadogs,\" while the\nBuccaneers refer to themselves as \"Sea Lords.\"\n\nOver the years, infighting led to further factions and spin-off groups, resulting in dozens of\norganizations. While some of the older confraternities focus on humanitarian efforts,\n[subsequent splinter groups have strayed from those traditional values. The groups are often](https://jamestown.org/program/nigerias-cults-and-their-role-in-the-niger-delta-insurgency/)\nreferred to as \"campus cults,\" and students are warned about the dangers of joining them.\nMany exhibit gang-like activity and align with local militant groups. They have engaged in\narmed robbery, kidnapping, operating prostitution rings, and cybercrime.\n\n[1] Cash to master services involve a representative from a cash to master company meeting\na ship upon its arrival into its destination port and paying the ship's captain, who then pays\ncrewmembers their wages, historically in cash accompanied by armed guards. In exchange,\nthe cash to master company receives a service fee.\n\n\n-----",
