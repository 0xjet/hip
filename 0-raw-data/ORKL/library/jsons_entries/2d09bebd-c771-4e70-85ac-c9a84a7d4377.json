In doing so, we can focus\nour attention on the bespoke code responsible for defining the implant’s behavior.\n\nThis time around we perform a deep dive into the same APT28 sample by analyzing its\ncapabilities and providing insight into its features.\n\n## Overview\n\n**Hash:**\nB40909AC0B70B7BD82465DFC7761A6B4E0DF55B894DD42290E3F72CB4280FA44\n\n**File Type: Windows x64 DLL**\n\n**PE Compilation Timestamp: 4 July 2018 14:38:54th**\n\n_Figure 1: APT28 sample details_\n\nAnalysis reveals the implant is a multi-threaded DLL backdoor that gives the threat actor (TA)\nfull access to, and control of, the target host. When commanded by C2, the implant can\nupload or download files, create processes, interact with the host via a command shell and\nconnect to C2 according to a defined sleep/activity schedule.\n\nAs covered in [Part 1, the implant is written in C++ and statically linked against OpenSSL and](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/flirting-with-ida-and-apt28.html)\nthe Poco C++ framework. Since the file is packaged as a DLL, the intention would be to\ninject it into a long-running process that is granted Internet access (such as a NetSvc service\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup) or one having local firewall permissions. We do not believe this DLL is intended to\noperate as a module for a larger tool.\n\n## Entry Point\n\nMalicious code entry occurs via the DllMain export. The implant’s first task is to load the\nlegitimate Microsoft npmproxy.dll found in “c:\\windows\\system32”. With this loaded, the\naddresses of the five implant exports, “DllCanUnloadNow”, “DllGetClassObject”,\n“DllRegisterServer”, “DllUnregisterServer” and “GetProxyDllInfo” are set to the addresses of\nthe same, benign exports found in the Microsoft DLL.\n\nThe reason for this is unconfirmed, but most likely serves a defensive measure to evade end\npoint protection that scans export addresses looking for code changes (when compared to a\npredetermined signature database), or against a database of known-malicious code.\nPerhaps by setting its own exports to those of the benign copy, the implant is attempting to\nremain undetected:\n\n_Figure 2: Substitution of PE export addresses_\n\nWith export addresses replaced, a thread is launched to execute the main code path. Within\nthis, a second thread is launched responsible for send and receive operations with C2. A\nglobal variable forms the basis of inter-thread synchronization for processing of C2\nmessages.\n\n## Mutex\n\nThe primary thread’s first task is the creation of a Globally Unique ID (GUID) mutex\n“1b8232f6-6806-4733-901d-62bf3ef33e6c”. The GUID string can be found as plain text\nwithin the binary, offering a potential (albeit trivially replaceable) IoC. As is customary, if\nmutex creation fails the sample terminates with no further action taken.\n\n## Machine Fingerprint\n\nFollowing mutex creation, the implant generates a unique CRC-32 host fingerprint using the\nprimary network interface’s ethernet (MAC) address, the host name, and Windows version\nstring. The final CRC-32 result is then XOR’d with fixed constant 0x64113. The generated\nhost fingerprint is used later to build the C2 beacon URL, and presumably identifies the\nimplant’s malicious use on each infected machine.\n\n## Command-and-Control (C2)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main communication protocol with the C2 server is RSA encrypted, Base64 encoded\nJSON exchanged over HTTPS (TLS, port 443), or as fallback, on plain HTTP using port 80.\nDuring our analysis the implant did not attempt to use any other application protocols.\n\nThe user-agent string for HTTP requests is populated from either the return value of the\n“ ObtainUserAgentString” API call, or if that fails, a hard-coded alternate (see IoCs below).\n\nSupport for egress proxy servers is included through a call to\n“ WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser”. The result is parsed and supplied to the Poco\nframework’s “ HTTPClientSession::setProxyConfig” prior to C2 activity.\n\nA 1024-bit RSA key pair is embedded within the implant and used to encrypt and decrypt\ncommunication between host and C2. The private key decrypts inbound traffic while the\npublic key encrypts outbound. No stream cipher(s) or session keys are negotiated.\n\nThe initial HTTPS beacon to “malaytravelgroup[.]com” is a GET request consisting of a\nrandomly selected URL path concatenation, together with a query string containing the\nparameter split count, the XOR constant 0x64113 (also used when generating the host CRC32), and the computed CRC-32 fingerprint. The query string is padded with random data to\nprevent ad-hoc analysis and finally Base64 encoded:\n\n**Field** **Name** **Bytes** **Value** **Comment**\n\n1 - 1 1-254 Parameter split count as ASCII value.\n\n2 “aid” 4 0x64113 XOR constant used when generating host CRC-32.\nPossibly a unique implant ID.\n\n3 “bid” 4 _variable_ CRC-32 host fingerprint.\n\n_Table 1: C2 beacon query parameters_\n\nThe URL path component is built as one to three strings (“/” separated), generated from a set\nof encrypted string tables. The decrypted versions are provided in the Appendix.\n\nThe Base64 encoded data is split into a random number of parameters and padded as a\nmeans of obfuscation. The query parameter’s names are randomly generated using 1-4\nupper/lower case characters:\n\n**Name** **Value** **Explanation**\n\n\n-----\n\n<rand_str> <2_rand_chars> +\nb64(<n>)\n\n<rand_str_1> <2_rand_chars> +\nb64(<rand_byte> +\n\n<data_part_1>)\n\n<rand_str_2> <2_rand_chars> +\nb64(<rand_byte> +\n\n<data_part_2>)\n\n\nSpecifies the number of parameters across\nwhich the beacon data is split\n\nValue contains first part of encoded data,\npreceded by 2 random characters\n\nValue contains second part of encoded data,\npreceded by 2 random characters\n\n\n... ... ...\n\n\n<rand_str_n> <2_rand_chars> +\nb64(<rand_byte> +\n\n<data_part_n>)\n\n_Table 2: Query parameter deconstruction_\n\nExamples of beacon request URLs:\n\n\nValue contains last part of encoded data,\npreceded by 2 random characters\n\n\nGET /pricing/training/news/?GPFi=mLMg&CYlp=Tj9RNBBg%3D%3D&JOM=uJfgAz9Zpw\n\nGET /forum/feedback/switch/?\nLnY=YNA&D=TH%2FRM%3D&rMuo=BFXUEG&cs=bkqgA%3D&HZql=bXgTP1mnA%3D\nHTTP/1.1\n\nGET /activity/?\nFLVE=JNA&Y=vKYxNB&F=Hg6wY%3D&Slq=QBuAAz&ux=lSGfWacA%3D%3D HTTP/1.1\n\n_Figure 3: Beacon URL examples_\n\nUsing the first example in Figure 3, the first query parameter indicating the beacon data split\ncount would be Base64 decoded as:\n\nGPFi=mLMg >> b64_decode(Mg) >>0x32 (\"2\")\n\nAll successive query parameters have the first two characters removed prior to Base64\ndecoding. The first byte of the decoded result is then discarded to arrive at the final value:\n\n\n-----\n\nCYlp=Tj9RNBBg== >> b64_decode(9RNBBg==) >> F5 13 41 06\nJOM=uJfgAz9Zpw >> b64_decode(fgAz9Zpw) >> 7E 00 33 F5 9A 70\n\n0x00064113 >> XOR constant/implant ID\n0x709AF533>> Host CRC-32 fingerprint\n\nOnce the beacon is received and decoded, the next phase of interaction is to issue\ncommands that drive the implant’s functions, such as the provision of an activity\nschedule/sleep interval limiting implant activity.\n\n## Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)\n\nThe primary C2 domain of “malaytravelgroup[.]com” is used for the initial beacon. Like all\nsensitive strings, it is XOR encoded and revealed only when needed.\n\nThe implant also contains a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) based algorithm for\ngenerating what appear to be backup C2 domain names. Curiously the implementation is\n100% deterministic owing to the use of a fixed seed value (0xC31) as shown in Figure 4.\nEvery invocation of the DGA will produce the same five domains:\n\nschooltillhungryprocess[.]com\n\nreasonwithusefulpolicy[.]com\n\nstreetunderrelevantpeople[.]com\n\nexperiencewithweakkid[.]com\n\nsystembeforeniceparent[.]com\n\n_Figure 4: Encoded C2 servers_\n\nOnce the domains are generated, they are XOR encoded. The LCG implementation can be\nseen here, together with its constant seed value:\n\n_Figure 5: DGA LCG using fixed seed value_\n\nDomain names are generated as the concatenation of 4 string-table lookups from 3\nencrypted string tables. Table 3 is referenced twice during generation. The Top-Level Domain\n(TLD) suffix is hardcoded to “.com”.\n\n**Table** **Number of strings**\n\n\n-----\n\n1 99\n\n2 31\n\n3 149\n\n_Table 3: String table sizes for domain generation_\n\nAssuming the continued adoption of a four-part domain name, the LCG would be capable of\ngenerating millions of unique permutations. The reason for limiting its output to the same\nfive, irrespective of date, time, host identity, or other input variable is unclear. A copy of the\ndecrypted string tables is provided in the Appendix.\n\nBy manually decreasing the delay between check-in attempts, we accelerated the amount of\nC2 activity generated by the implant. Curiously, during a 24-hour observation window, no\nattempts were made to communicate with the generated domains. Different reachability\nscenarios were tested, ranging from malformed responses to unreachable IP addresses. At\nno point did the implant generate any DNS or HTTP traffic relating to the generated domains.\n\nIt’s conceivable the backup domains are accessed via HTTP 302 redirects issued by the\nprimary site, but this would seemingly defeat the purpose of having primary and backup\ndomains to cater for failure, migration, or shutdown. It’s also possible the generated C2\ndomains are active only for certain implant commands such as file upload or download.\n\nLacking any evidence for their direct use, we can speculate the generated domains may be\noperating as a honeypot. Access to them from any Internet addresses would immediately be\nconsidered “suspicious” by virtue of their hidden existence only within the implant code. The\nsource of such requests could be directly attributable to threat researchers or analysts\ninvestigating the implant’s inner workings.\n\n## Functions\n\nThe implant lacks any modularity and is therefore limited to eight functions. Each function is\ninvoked from C2 by supplying a value from which a known CRC-32 is calculated. The\ncomputed CRC-32 value serves as a key or look-up to execute the corresponding function.\n\nParameters for each backdoor supported function are supplied with each command and\ndetailed in Table 4:\n\n**CRC-32** **Function** **Parameters** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n15512FB9 Spawn\nprocess\n\n\nfile_name,\nfile_path, args\n\n\n76BCDC67 Create file file_name,\nfile_path, body\n\n\nSpawn a process using the supplied\narguments.\n\nCreates a file with the supplied body, i.e. file\nis pushed (downloaded) from C2. Files have\nthe DOS hidden attribute set by default.\n\nDeletes file or folder. Optional recursive\nparameter for folder and contents deletion.\n\nLaunches COMSPEC (cmd.exe) shell. Stdin,\nstdout, stderr relayed over main C2 channel.\n\nRead a file, i.e. upload to C2.\n\n\nB21CEBD4 Delete\nfile/folder\n\n406C9E35 Launch\nshell\n\n\nfile_name,\nfile_path,\nrecursive\n\nstart, stop,\nstatus, bash\n\n\n72E99D37 Read file file_name,\nfile_path\n\n\n04365407 Set C2\ncheck-in\ninterval\n\n99598005 Set C2\ncheckin/activity\nschedule\n\n1E46EC18 Get status\ninformation\n\n_Table 4: Implant functions_\n\n\ntimeout Sets the interval between C2 check-in.\nDefault is 3 hours.\n\n\nday_of_month,\nday_of_week,\nhour,\n\n\nSets day of month/week and hour that implant\nshould attempt to reach C2. Default setting is\n0 for all values, meaning no exclusions;\ncheck-in would therefore be every 3 hours –\nthe default sleep interval.\n\n\n_None_ Returns Build_Id of implant, Computer_Id,\nFull_Info. Details of last command and status\n(success/fail).\n\n\nThe shell capability is perhaps the most interesting, giving the operators a full-duplex,\ninteractive COMSPEC (cmd.exe) session, with stdin (input), stdout, and stderr (output\nreturned by commands) redirected over the HTTPS C2 channel. Commands to the shell are\nissued by the TA with the resulting output being returned almost immediately.\n\nDespite the shell pipe creation taking place in (as identified by IDA signatures) the Poco\nframework’s “SMTPChannel” constructor, the implant makes no use of SMTP as a transport.\nThe “bash” parameter, synonymous with Linux environments, hints at a multi-platform\ncapability. However, in this instance it is used to send commands to the shell by writing the\n\n\n-----\n\naccompanying value to stdin. Windows 10 does offer a Linux Subsystem that would make a\nbash shell available, but we have no evidence to suggest this is what the operators are\ninstalling or using:\n\n_Figure 6: Implant function dispatch_\n\n## String Encryption\n\nThirteen unique XOR keys are used throughout the implant for runtime decoding of sensitive\nstrings. Each implant function (as listed in Table 4) is provided with its own XOR key, as are\ngeneral C2, URL/HTTP, and RSA related operations:\n\n**Key:** **Used during:**\n\nF226E34F0B64528CF0 Embedded RSA key decryption\n\n371F41ABE4C8880BC1 URL/HTTP related operations\n\n40A521B0866411BAC4 General string decryption key\n\nEFEA221C400E2D1227 C2 messaging\n\n82EF8E95992055B6B5 C2 messaging\n\n4F840D589769 Create process function\n\n6EFEAF1AAA6932 Create file/download function\n\n59938EF1C8EFBA79B Delete file/folder function\n\n722C1B76 Shell handler function\n\n1F4582D80B Read file/upload function\n\n6A39E0FC68D6 Set C2 check-in interval function\n\nA24B726DFD Set C2 activity schedule function\n\n\n-----\n\n597EB47AAD Get host/install info function\n\n_Table 5: XOR encoding/decoding keys_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnalysis shows the implant carries a feature set designed to provide the fundamental\ncapabilities of a backdoor: file download, upload, remote command execution, and\ninteractive shell access.\n\nComparing the functions of this implant to published descriptions of APT-28’s “x-tunnel”, we\nfind no tunneling, proxying, or VPN-like capabilities. It also lacks credential harvesting,\nnetwork service scanning, or Windows registry manipulation. Given the lack of modularity\nonly an updated version could provide these features. The alternative (and perhaps more\nlikely) scenario would be for such capabilities to exist in subsequent tools downloaded and\nexecuted by this implant.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**SHA256:**\n\nb40909ac0b70b7bd82465dfc7761a6b4e0df55b894dd42290e3f72cb4280fa44\n\n**C2 beacon domain:**\n\nmalaytravelgroup[.]com\n\n**DGA domains:**\n\nschooltillhungryprocess[.]com\n\nreasonwithusefulpolicy[.]com\n\nstreetunderrelevantpeople[.]com\n\nexperiencewithweakkid[.]com\n\nsystembeforeniceparent[.]com\n\n**Mutex:**\n\n1b8232f6-6806-4733-901d-62bf3ef33e6c\n\n**Hard-coded User-Agent string:**\n\n“ Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0”\n\n## Yara Signature\n\n\n-----\n\nrule apt28_backdoor_cls\n{\nstrings:\n$st1 = \"AES_256_poco\" ascii\n$st2 = \"TEncryption\" ascii\n$st3 = \"shell\" ascii\ncondition:\nall of them\n}\n\nrule apt28_backdoor_crc32\n{\nstrings:\n$xor1 = { 48 8B 07 39 48 0C 75 3A 44 8B 70 08 4C 8B 38 4D 85 C0 74\n2E 45 85 E4 74 29 }\ncondition:\n$xor1\n}\n\n## Appendix\n\n**Decrypted String Tables:**\n\n**Table 1** **Table 2** **Table 3**\n\n\ndifferent\n\nused\n\nimportant\n\nevery\n\nlarge\n\navailable\n\npopular\n\nlonely\n\nbasic\nknown\n\nvarious\n\ndifficult\n\nseveral\n\nunite\n\nhistorical\n\nhot\n\nuseful\n\nmental\n\nscare\n\nadditional\n\n\nat\non\n\nin\n\nto\ninto\n\nfrom\n\nbefore\n\nuntil\ntill\n\nabout\n\nfor\n\nof\nwith\n\nby\n\nafter\n\nsince\nduring\n\nbetween\n\nnear\n\nnearby\n\n\nstreet\n\ncompany\n\npart\n\nsystem\n\nnumber\n\nworld\n\ncase\n\nwork\n\nparty\n\ngirl\n\nhouse\n\nwoman\n\nlife\n\npeople\n\nyear\n\nday\n\nway\n\nthing\n\nchild\n\ngroup\n\n\n-----\n\nemotional\nold\npolitical\nsimilar\nhealthy\nfinancial\nmedical\ntraditional\nformer\nentire\nstrong\nactual\nsignificant\nsuccessful\nelectrical\nexpensive\npregnant\nintelligent\ninteresting\npoor\nhappy\nresponsible\ncute\nhelpful\nrecent\nwilling\nnice\nwonderful\nimpossible\nserious\nhuge\nrare\nvisible\ntypical\ncompetitive\ncritical\ndesperate\nimmediate\naware\neducational\nenvironmental\nglobal\ndecent\nrelevant\naccurate\ncapable\ndangerous\ndramatic\nefficient\npowerful\nforeign\nhungry\n\n\nbehind\nacross\nabove\nover\nunder\nbelow\nalong\nround\naround\npast\nthrough\n\n\ntime\narea\nproblem\nplace\nhand\nservice\nschool\nguy\ncountry\npoint\nweek\nrelationship\nend\nword\nfamily\nfact\nhead\nmonth\ninformation\npower\nchange\nquestion\nbusiness\ndevelopment\nhome\nside\nnight\nmoney\neye\ninterest\nbook\nteacher\nair\ncourt\nwater\nmanager\nform\nfood\nca\nmoment\nlevel\nroom\ncar\nstory\nmarket\neffect\nidea\nopportunity\nresult\nuse\nstudy\njob\n\n\n-----\n\nfriendly\npsychological\nsevere\nsuitable\nnumerous\nsufficient\nunusual\nanxious\ncultural\ncurious\nfamous\npure\ncomprehensive\nobvious\ncareful\nimpressive\nunhappy\nacceptable\naggressive\nboring\ninner\neastern\nsudden\nreasonable\nstrict\nweak\ncivil\n\n\nname\nreport\nbody\nlaw\nface\nauthority\nfriend\nparent\nminute\ndoor\nminister\nroad\nrate\nline\nhour\nwar\nmother\nright\noffice\nperson\nreason\nview\nterm\nperiod\ncentre\nmorning\nproject\nresearch\nfigure\nsociety\nhistory\ncity\npolice\nkind\nmillion\ncommunity\nneed\ntree\nprice\nteam\ngame\nfather\nkid\nstudent\nsupport\nprogram\nhealth\nfield\nman\nexample\nquality\ncontrol\n\n\n-----\n\naction\nprocess\nposition\neducation\nage\ncourse\ntype\nmanner\norder\ndecision\nindustry\nmind\ncondition\npaper\nbank\ncentury\nactivity\ntable\nsense\nbuilding\nexperience\nstaff\nlanguage\nplan\npolicy\n\n\n_Table 6: C2 DGA Strings_\n\n**Table 1**\n\n\n-----\n\nnews\nnwshp\n\nsection\n\npagead\n\nads\n\nforum\n\ngeneral\n\ntopic\n\nmaster\n\nexplore\n\nfeatures\n\nenterprise\n\npricing\n\narticle\n\ncontact\n\nsecurity\n\nabout\n\nstatus\n\nblog\n\ntraining\n\nhelp\n\nfeedback\n\nterms\n\nactivity\n\npricing\n\nswitch\n\n_Table 7: URL Path String Table_\n\nThe BlackBerry Cylance Threat Research Team\n\n## About The BlackBerry Cylance Threat Research Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Cylance Threat Research team examines malware and suspected malware\nto better identify its abilities, function and attack vectors.
