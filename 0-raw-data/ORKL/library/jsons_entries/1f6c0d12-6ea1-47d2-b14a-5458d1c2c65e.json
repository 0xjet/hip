Financial gain remains one of\nthe main goals for Lazarus, with its tactics, techniques, and procedures constantly evolving\nto avoid detection.\n\n[In the middle of 2018, we published our Operation Applejeus research, which highlighted](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/)\nLazarus’s focus on cryptocurrency exchanges utilizing a fake company with a backdoored\nproduct aimed at cryptocurrency businesses. One of the key findings was the group’s new\nability to target macOS. Since then Lazarus has been busy expanding its operations for the\nplatform.\n\nFurther tracking of their activities targeting the financial sector enabled us to discover a new\noperation, active since at least November 2018, which utilizes PowerShell to control\nWindows systems and macOS malware for Apple users.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Infection procedure_\n\nLazarus is a well-organized group, something that can be seen from their malware\npopulation: not only have we seen them build redundancy to reserve some malware in case\nof in-operation hot spare replacement of ‘burnt’ (detected) samples but they also conform to\nspecific internal standards and protocols when developing backdoors. This case is no\ndifferent. They have developed custom PowerShell scripts that communicate with malicious\nC2 servers and execute commands from the operator. The C2 server script names are\ndisguised as WordPress (popular blog engine) files as well as those of other popular open\nsource projects. After establishing the malware control session with the server, the\nfunctionality provided by the malware includes:\n\nSet sleep time (delay between C2 interactions)\nExit malware\nCollect basic host information\nCheck malware status\nShow current malware configuration\nUpdate malware configuration\nExecute system shell command\nDownload & Upload files\n\nLazarus uses different tactics to run its C2 servers: from purchasing servers to using hacked\nones. We have seen some legitimate-looking servers that are most likely compromised and\nused in malicious campaigns. According to server response headers, they are most likely\nrunning an old vulnerable instance of Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 on Microsoft\nWindows Server 2003. Another C2 server was probably purchased by Lazarus from a\nhosting company and used to host macOS and Windows payloads. The geography of the\nservers varies, from China to the European Union. But why use two different types of\nservers? The group seems to have a rule (at least in this campaign) to only host malware on\nrented servers, while hosting C2 scripts for malware communication on compromised\nservers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Infrastructure segregation by purpose_\n\nThe malware was distributed via documents carefully prepared to attract the attention of\ncryptocurrency professionals. Seeing as how some of the documents were prepared in\nKorean, we believe that South Korean businesses are a high priority for Lazarus. One\ndocument entitled ‘Sample document for business plan evaluation of venture company’\n(translated from Korean) looks like this:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Content of weaponized document from Lazarus (4cbd45fe6d65f513447beb4509a9ae3d)_\n\nAnother macro-weaponized document (e9a6a945803722be1556fd120ee81199) contains a\nbusiness overview of what seems to be a Chinese technology consulting group named\nLAFIZ. We couldn’t confirm if it’s a legitimate business or another fake company made up by\nLazarus. Their website lafiz[.]link has been parked since 2017.\n\n_Contents of another weaponized document (e9a6a945803722be1556fd120ee81199)_\n\nBased on our telemetry, we found a cryptocurrency exchange company attacked with a\nmalicious document containing the same macro. The document’s content provided\ninformation for coin listings with a translation in Korean:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Content of another weaponized document (6a0f3abd05bc75edbfb862739865a4cc)_\n\nThe payloads show that Lazarus keeps exploring more ways to evade detection to stay\nunder the radar longer. The group builds malware for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows separately\nto support both platforms and have more variety in terms of compiled code. The Windows\npayloads distributed from the server (nzssdm[.]com) hosting the Mac malware have a\nCheckSelf export function, and one of them (668d5b5761755c9d061da74cb21a8b75) has\nthe internal name ‘battle64.dll’. From that point we managed to find additional Windows\nmalware samples containing the CheckSelf export function and an internal name containing\nthe word ‘battle’.\n\nThese Windows malware samples were delivered using malicious HWP (Korean Hangul\nWord Processor format) documents exploiting a known PostScript vulnerability. It should be\nnoted that HWP documents are only popular among Korean users (Hangul Word Processor\nwas developed in South Korea) and we have witnessed several attacks using the same\nmethod.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Connection with previous HWP attacks_\n\nIt’s no secret that Apple products are now very popular among successful internet startups\nand fintech companies, and this is why the malicious actor built and used macOS malware.\nWhile investigating earlier Lazarus incidents, we anticipated this actor would eventually\nexpand its attacks to macOS.\n\nIt appears that Lazarus is using the same developers to expand to other platforms, because\nsome of the features have remained consistent as its malware evolves.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Overlap of current campaign and previous hwp-based attack cases_\n\nWe’d therefore like to ask Windows and macOS users to be more cautious and not fall victim\nto Lazarus. If you’re part of the booming cryptocurrency or technological startup industry,\nexercise extra caution when dealing with new third parties or installing software on your\nsystems. It’s best to check new software with an antivirus or at least use popular free virus[scanning services such as VirusTotal. And never ‘Enable Content’ (macro scripting) in](https://www.virustotal.com/)\nMicrosoft Office documents received from new or untrusted sources. Avoid being infected by\nfake or backdoored software from Lazarus – if you need to try out new applications, it’s\nbetter do so offline or on an isolated network virtual machine which you can erase with a few\nclicks. We’ll continue posting on Lazarus’s latest tactics and tricks in our blog. In the\nmeantime, stay safe!\n\n[For more details on this and other research, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n**File Hashes:**\n\n**Malicious office document used in real attack**\n\n4cbd45fe6d65f513447beb4509a9ae3d 샘플_기술사업계획서(벤처기업평가용).doc\n\n6a0f3abd05bc75edbfb862739865a4cc 문의_Evaluation Table.xls\n\n**Testing office document**\n\n29a37c6d9fae5664946c6607f351a8dc list.doc\n\ne9a6a945803722be1556fd120ee81199 list.doc\na18bc8bc82bca8245838274907e64631 list.doc\n\n**macOS malware**\n\n4345798b2a09fc782901e176bd0c69b6\n\n**PowerShell script**\n\ncb713385655e9af0a2fc10da5c0256f5 test.ps1\n\ne6d5363091e63e35490ad2d76b72e851 test.ps1 – It does not contain URLs.\n\nDa4981df65cc8b5263594bb71a0720a1\n\n**Windows executable payload**\n\n171b9135540f89bf727b690b9e587a4e wwtm.dat\n\n668d5b5761755c9d061da74cb21a8b75 wwtm.dat\n\nad3f966d48f18b5e7b23a579a926c7e8\n\n**Manuscrypt payload**\n\n35e38d023b253c0cd9bd3e16afc362a7\n\n72fe869aa394ef0a62bb8324857770dd\n\n86d3c1b354ce696e454c42d8dc6df1b7\n\n5182e7a2037717f2f9bbf6ba298c48fb\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malicious hwp file**\nF392492ef5ea1b399b4c0af38810b0d6 일일동향보고_180913.hwp\n0316f6067bc02c23c1975d83c659da21 국가핵심인력등록관리제등검토요청(10.16)(김경환변\n호사).hwp\n\n**Domains and IPs**\n\n**Compromised first stage C2 server**\n\nhttp://bluecreekrobotics[.]com/wp-includes/common.php\n\nhttp://dev.microcravate[.]com/wp-includes/common.php\n\nhttp://dev.whatsyourcrunch[.]com/wp-includes/common.php\n\nhttp://enterpriseheroes.com[.]ng/wp-includes/common.php\n\nhttp://hrgp.asselsolutions[.]com/wp-includes/common.php\n\nhttps://baseballcharlemagnelegardeur[.]com/wp-content/languages/common.php\n\nhttps://bogorcenter[.]com/wp-content/themes/index2.php\n\nhttps://eventum.cwsdev3.bi[.]com/wp-includes/common.php\n\nhttps://streamf[.]ru/wp-content/index2.php\n\nhttps://towingoperations[.]com/chat/chat.php\n\nhttps://vinhsake[.]com//wp-content/uploads/index2.php\n\nhttps://www.tangowithcolette[.]com/pages/common.php\n\n**Second stage C2 server**\n\nhttp://115.28.160[.]20:443 – Compromised server\n\n**Malware hosting server**\n\nhttp://nzssdm[.]com/assets/wwtm.dat – Windows payload distribution URL\n\nhttp://nzssdm[.]com/assets/mt.dat – Mac payload distribution URL\n\nCryptocurrency businesses still being targeted by Lazarus\n\nYour email address will not be published.
