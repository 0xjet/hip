And like in a game of chess, they are the set pieces that make up their\nmodus operandi.\n\nTake for instance the self-named ChessMaster, a campaign targeting Japanese academe,\ntechnology enterprises, media outfits, managed service providers, and government\nagencies. It employs various poisoned pawns in the form of malware-laden spear-phishing\nemails containing decoy documents. And beyond ChessMaster’s endgame and pawns, we\nalso found red flags that allude to its links to APT 10, also known as menuPass,\nPOTASSIUM, Stone Panda, Red Apollo, and CVNX.\n\nChessMaster’s name is from pieces of chess/checkers/draughts we found in the resource\nsection of the main backdoor they use against their targets: ChChes, which Trend Micro\ndetects as BKDR_CHCHES.\n\nWhat makes the campaign unique is its arsenal of tools and techniques:\n\n**_[Malicious shortcut (LNK) files and PowerShell. The LNK files execute Command](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/e/rising-trend-attackers-using-lnk-files-download-malware.html)_**\n[Prompt that downloads a PowerShell script, which would either directly drop or](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/security-technology/security-101-the-rise-of-fileless-threats-that-abuse-powershell)\nreflectively load ChChes into the machine. The latter method makes ChChes a fileless\nmalware.\n**_Self-extracting archive (SFX). An archive that drops an executable (EXE), a dynamic-_**\nlink library (DLL), and a binary file (.BIN). Upon their extraction, malicious code is\ninjected into the process of a legitimate file/application (DLL hijacking). ChessMaster\n[takes it up a notch via load-time dynamic linking to trigger the malicious DLL’s function.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684184(v=vs.85).aspx)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Runtime packers. Throughout its campaign, ChChes used three packers to obfuscate_**\nitself and avoid detection. The first had no encryption and a varied loader code. The\nsecond had a buggy (or anti-emulation) exclusive OR (XOR) encryption technique. The\nthird added an AES algorithm on top of XOR encryption. Their compile dates overlap,\nwhich indicates ChChes’ authors take cues and fine-tune their malware.\n**_Second-stage payloads. Additional malware are introduced to the infected system for_**\npersistence. These are actually variants of ChChes that use similar entry points but\ndifferent and encrypted C&C communication.\n**_Hacking Tools. ChessMaster draws on legitimate email and browser password_**\nrecovery and dumping tools they’ve misused and modified for their campaign. These\ncan restore forgotten passwords, which are then dumped and retrieved. Lateral\nmovement and further attacks can be worked out from here.\n**_TinyX. A version of_** [PlugX sans the plug-in functionality that allows it to adopt new](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/plugx-new-tool-for-a-not-so-new-campaign/)\ncapabilities. TinyX is bundled separately in spear-phishing emails.\n**_[RedLeaves. A second-stage backdoor that operates like the open-source and fileless](http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2017/04/redleaves---malware-based-on-open-source-rat.html)_**\nremote access Trojan (RAT) [Trochilus, which is known for enabling lateral movement in](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/trojan-variants/trochilus)\nthe infected systems. RedLeaves adopted capabilities from PlugX. In April, a\nRedLeaves variant named himawari (Japanese for sunflower) emerged capable of\nevading YARA rules released during that time.\n\n**_ChessMaster and APT 10 Plays the Same Cyberespionage Game_**\n\nAPT 10/menuPass is a cyberespionage group whose specific campaign, Operation Cloud\nHopper, attacked the intermediaries of their targets of interest—managed service providers\n(MSPs). Its notoriety stems from their prolific use of multifarious information-stealing\nbackdoors and vulnerability exploits, along with the tenacity of its subterfuges, from spearphishing emails to attack and infection chains. It also abused legitimate or open-source\nremote administration tools to steal data.\n\nIf that sounded familiar, it's because ChessMaster and APT 10 appear to be playing the\nsame cyberespionage game. Here’s a further illustration:\n\n_Figure 1: Similarities in ChessMaster and APT 10’s attack chain_\n\nWe first saw ChChes set its sights on an organization that’s long been a target of APT\n10/menuPass. As we caught and delved into more ChChes samples in the wild, however, we\nalso saw how they followed the same pattern—exclusive packers, mutual targets,\noverlapping C&C infrastructure.\n\nChChes’ packer, for instance, resembled the one used in menuPass’ old PlugX samples.\nDNS records also showed that some of their command and control (C&C) servers and\ndomains resolved to the same IP address, or resided in the same subnet. Are they operated\nby the same actors? Their commonalities make it appear so. It’s also known to happen;\n[BlackTech’s cyberespionage campaigns are a case in point.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/f/following-trail-blacktech-cyber-espionage-campaigns.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Comparison of Emdivi and ChChes_\n\nChessMaster’s ChChes also resembles another backdoor, [Emdivi, which first made waves in](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/attackers-target-organizations-in-japan-transform-local-sites-into-cc-servers-for-emdivi-backdoor/)\n2014. They have the same endgame. Both are second-stage payloads that use the system’s\nSecurity Identifier (SID) as encryption key so they execute only in their target’s machine.\nTheir difference lies in complexity—ChChes hides part of the decryption key and payload in\nregistry keys to make it harder to reverse engineer.\n\nBut that’s just one dot in several we’ve connected. In one instance, we detected PlugX and\nEmdivi on the same machine. This PlugX variant connected to an APT 10/menuPass-owned\ndomain, but the packer is similar to that used by ChChes. While it’s possible it was hit by two\ndifferent campaigns, further analysis told a different story. Both were compiled on the same\ndate, only several hours apart. We detected and acquired the samples the next day, which\nmeans both backdoors were delivered to the victim a day after they were compiled.\n\n_Figure 3: Overview of the overlaps in ChessMaster and APT 10’s campaigns_\n\n**_Take ‘Control of the Center’_**\n\nUltimately attacks like ChessMaster’s make pawns out of the systems, networks, devices\nand their users, all of which hold the organization’s crown jewels. This is why enterprises\nneed to be steps ahead of the game: prepare, respond, restore, and learn. Plan ahead—\nwhat techniques will attackers use? How can I defend against them? Don’t just pull the plug\n—understand what happened to better assess and mitigate the damage. Fine-tune your\nresponse—what worked, what didn’t, and what could’ve been done better?\n\nDefense in depth plays a crucial role especially for the IT/system administrators and\ninformation security professionals that watch over them. The network, endpoints, servers,\nmobile devices, and web/email gateways are the bishops, knights, and rooks that underpin\nthe enterprise’s crown jewels, which is why securing them is important. Reduce their attack\nsurface. Keep the systems updated and regularly patched, and enforce the principle of least\nprivilege. Employ behavior monitoring and application control. Deploy firewalls as well\nintrusion detection and prevention systems. Implement URL categorization, network\nsegmentation, and [data categorization.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/identifying-and-dividing-networks-and-users/)\n\nChessMaster’s gambit is spear-phishing, so it’s especially important to filter and safeguard\nthe email gateway. Additionally, foster a cybersecurity-aware workforce. Seemingly benign\nicons or decoy documents can still swindle the victim, for instance. More importantly, develop\nproactive incident response and remediation strategies—threat intelligence helps enterprises\nprepare and mitigate attacks. Like in chess, the more you understand your enemy’s moves,\nthe more successful you can be at thwarting them.\n\nThe Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to ChessMaster's campaigns is in this\n[appendix.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Appendix-ChessMaster-Makes-its-Move-A-Look-into-the-Campaigns-Cyberespionage-Arsenal.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n_[This has been presented in the RSA Conference 2017 Asia Pacific & Japan as](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/events/rsa-2017-asia-pacific-japan/)_\n_[“ChessMaster: A New Campaign Targeting Japan Using the New ChChes Backdoor” on July](https://www.rsaconference.com/Library/presentation/APJ/2017/chessmaster-a-new-campaign-targeting-japan-using-the-new-chches-backdoor)_\n_27, 2017, in Marina Bay Sands, Singapore._ _Updated on August 14, 2017, 11:50 PM to_\n_include IoCs related to ChessMaster._\n\nTags\n\n[Malware |](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research.html?category=trend-micro-research:threats/malware) [Endpoints |](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research.html?category=trend-micro-research:environments/endpoints) [Research](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research.html?category=trend-micro-research:article-type/research)\n\n\n-----",
