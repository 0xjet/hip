    "plain_text": "# BazarLoader Actors Initiate Contact via Website Contact Forms\n\n**abnormalsecurity.com/blog/bazarloader-contact-form**\n\nWhile most cyberattacks are launched via email, attackers are always looking for new ways\nto make contact with potential victims. Recently, the threat intelligence team at Abnormal\nSecurity observed some attacks targeting our customers that started through an online\ncontact form.\n\nBased on our analysis, we determined that these attacks were attempting to deploy\n[BazarLoader malware. BazarLoader is most closely associated with the cybercrime group](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/trickbot-gang-doubles-down-enterprise-infection/)\nknown as Wizard Spider, credited with developing the Trickbot banking trojan and Conti\nransomware.\n\n[Previous BazarLoader campaigns using customer inquiry forms were first identified in 2021,](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/trickbot-gang-doubles-down-enterprise-infection/)\nbut those attempts used attention-seeking themes to garner artificial urgency. In many cases,\nthe attackers threatened legal action for ongoing copyright violations, with malware disguised\nas evidence of the misconduct. In these recent campaigns, the actors chose a much lowerimpact theme, pretending to be a potential customer in the ordinary course of business.\n\n## Attackers Use Online Contact Form to Initiate Communication\n\n\n-----\n\nBetween December 2021 and January 2022, we identified a series of phishing campaigns\ntargeting several of our customers. At first glance, the overall volume of messages seemed\nlow; however, as we continued researching these attacks, it became clear that the volume\nwas artificially deflated because email was not the initial communication method used.\n\nRather than directly sending a phishing email, the attacker in these cases initiated a\nconversation through an organization’s website contact form. In these initial contact form\nsubmissions, the attacker posed as an employee at a Canadian luxury construction company\nlooking for a quote for a product provided by the target.\n\nThere are two primary purposes for choosing this method for initial communication.\n\n1. It disguises the communication as a request that could be reasonably expected to be\n\nreceived through an online request form.\n\n2. It circumvents potential email defenses since the request would be delivered through a\n\nlegitimate sender and does not contain any malicious content.\n\nOnce the contact form request has been submitted by the attacker, they simply wait until\nsomeone at the target company reaches out to them to follow up. From the perspective of an\nemail system, the target company is initiating conversation with the attacker rather than the\nother way around.\n\n## After Successful Contact, Attackers Send a Malicious File\n\nAfter fully establishing their cover identity via email, the threat actors continued project\nnegotiations in an effort to convince their victim to download a malicious file. Often this\ninvolved some level of social engineering to find a download method not blocked by the\nvictim’s security protocols, without arousing their suspicion.\n\n_Attacker establishing their cover identity via email._\n\nWe’ve observed the attacker in these campaigns use two different file sharing services—\nTransferNow and WeTransfer—to try to deliver the malicious file to victims. If delivery fails\nusing one of these methods, the attacker simply tries again using the other.\n\n_Link to TransferNow to download the malware._\n\n## BazarLoader Malware Analysis\n\nThe file shared by the threat actor is an .iso file with two components, both masquerading as\na different file type. At first glance, the .iso file appears to contain a shortcut to the folder with\nthe project and a .log file bearing the name of a legitimate Windows file as an anti-detection\ntechnique. In actuality, the two are a windows .lnk file and a .log file that is not\nDumpStack.log.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Malware sent via TransferNow._\n\nBecause shortcut .lnk files allow their creator to specify command-line arguments to perform\nan action on the victim’s device, cybercriminals can use them for nefarious means.\n\n_Components of the ISO file._\n\nIn this case, the .lnk file properties contain a command instruction to open a terminal window\nusing regsvr32.exe to run the so-named file DumStack.log. In reality, it's a BazarLoader\nDynamic-link library (DLL) file.\n\nWith a process injection technique, the DLL uses svchost.exe service to evade detection and\nestablish a connection with their command and control (C2) server at the IP address\n13.107.21[.]200 using port 443.\n\n_svchost.exe process._\n\n_Connection established with C2._\n\n_Connection established using port 443._\n\nAt the time of this investigation, some of the C2 IP addresses were down, and the others\nwere not able to download the second stage of the attack. This leaves some level of\nuncertainty as to the intended second stage malware payload. However, past relationships\nbetween the IP address 13[.]107[.]21[.]200 illustrated in red in the graph below reveal\nprevious links to malware.\n\n_[Threatcrowd Graph](https://www.threatcrowd.org/ip.php?ip=13.107.21.200)_\n\nMalware previously related to the IP address 13[.]107[.]21[.]200 has included the following:\n\nBased on this, it’s clear that the threat actors were attempting to execute a multi-stage attack\nwith BazarLoader as a first step.\n\n## The BazarLoader Bottom Line\n\nThe actors in this campaign attempted to improve their credibility by using customer contact\nforms to establish their identity as a trusted sender. Then, they sent emails from spoofed\ndomains to impersonate a known business. These spoofed domains were difficult to detect\ngiven that they are identical to the legitimate website other than the top-level domain, which\nwas changed from .com to .us to trick users.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter infecting their victim with the dropper malware BazarLoader, the trail unfortunately goes\ncold. However, we can make some educated guesses as to what they intended to happen\nnext. BazarLoader is usually the first stage in a more sophisticated, multi-stage malware\nattack, often used to deploy Conti ransomware or Cobalt Strike, for example.\n\nThese tools, used separately or in conjunction, help threat actors penetrate networks. At that\npoint, the possibilities for chaos are myriad. Consequences range from unauthorized\npayments and fund dispersals to total system shutdown and even persistent long-term\nnetwork intrusion.\n\n_To learn more about how Abnormal can stop these attacks before they reach you, request a_\n_demo of the platform._\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n104[.]215[.]148[.]63\n\n45[.]15[.]131[.]126\n\n148[.]163[.]42[.]203\n\n45[.]41[.]204[.]150\n\n193[.]169[.]86[.]84\n\n76[.]6[.]231[.]20\n\n131[.]253[.]33[.]200\n\n72[.]21[.]91[.]29\n\n**docs_1244.iso**\n\n97806F6DA402F135FA0556ADF5809D6D3BC629E967A0771B9FEB5BA55267D560\n\n**DumpStack.log**\n\n8395B26BE4A7D57F9B60839257C3E7B9E6756DBBEB818DE6575987D6E041C8FD\n\n**Attachments.lnk**\n\nCE6E63191588E449DE4AB45FF4D32E1BBD1C67681C74C32DE3A4DB63331278CC\n\n\n-----",
