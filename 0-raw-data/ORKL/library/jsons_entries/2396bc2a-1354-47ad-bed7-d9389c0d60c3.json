SonicWall RTDMI ™ engine has recently detected Windows shortcut file (LNK) inside\nan ISO image which downloads and executes LALALA infostealer to the victim’s machine.\nLALALA infostealer is a batch script, which takes help of PowerShell to steal and send\nvictim’s data to the server:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe LNK file copies itself to “%TEMP%\\ htn90.bat” and executes the batch script file. The\nmalware is intended to run only once on the victim’s machine. The batch script checks\npresence of “%TEMP%\\htn.txt” file, if already present then the batch script terminates and\ndeletes itself. The batch script writes “htn” into “%TEMP%\\htn.txt”. The batch script\ndownloads an archive file “%TEMP%\\htn.rar” and a WinRAR (compression tool) executable\nfile “%TEMP%\\rar.exe” from Unified Resource Locator (URL) h[t]\n\n[t]p://185.183.96.54/[filename].\n\nThe batch script extracts LALALA infostealer “htn.bat”, an image file\n_“lebenslauf_2019_11_20.jpeg” and an executable “sqlite3.exe” from “%TEMP%\\htn.rar”_\n_using WinRAR executable:_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe batch script displays “lebenslauf_2019_11_20.jpeg” image to the user which contains\n“ERROR 0x89976 IMAGE BROKEN” message, to make him feel that the LNK file has some\nissues. The batch script then executes LALALA infostealer “%TEMP%\\htn.bat”:\n\n\n-----\n\n**LALALA InfoStealer:**\n\nThe malware creates directory “%TEMP%\\jjghgjhfyt6” to store the stolen data. The\nmalware uses PowerShell command to collect and save installed programs information\ninto “%TEMP%\\jjghgjhfyt6\\proglist.txt”:\n\n**BACKDOOR ACTIVITY:**\n\nThe malware opens a backdoor to the malware author by scheduling a task which executes\nthe VBScript “%TEMP%\\[random].vbs” every minute. The VBScript takes web request\nresult from “185.183.96.54/gate990.php” as an argument and it contains the code to\nexecute the argument:\n\n**DATA EX-FILTRATION:**\n\nThe malware usually process the data on victim’s machine to extract very precise\ninformation which is sent to the malware server. But LALALA sends good amount of data to\nthe server which needs further processing at server’s end to extract the operative data. The\nmalware decrypts some application’s data (eg. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge) on\nvictim’s machine which uses Windows logon based encryption because that data can not\nbe decrypted on the other machine.\n\nThe malware steals login information from listed applications:\n\nGoogle Chrome\nMozilla Firefox\nMicrosoft Edge\nMozilla Thunderbird\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft Outlook\n\nThe malware copies Chrome data files “cookies”, “Login Data” and “Web Data” from\n“%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default” to “%TEMP%\\jjghgjhfyt6\\”. The\nmalware decrypts and saves card details, cookies and passwords\ninto “%TEMP%\\jjghgjhfyt6\\”:\n\nThe malware copies data files from Mozilla Thunderbird and Mozilla Firefox to\n_“%TEMP%\\jjghgjhfyt6”:_\n\nThe malware terminates “taskhost” and “dllhost” processes, then it decrypts and saves login\npasswords from Microsoft Edge into “%TEMP%\\jjghgjhfyt6\\edg_[randome]”:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware decrypts and saves Outlook data into %TEMP%\\jjghgjhfyt6\\outloo_[random]:\n\n**NETWORK:**\n\nThe malware compresses stolen data using WinRAR executable into “%TEMP%\\\n\n_[random].rar” and sends the compressed file to “185.183.96.54/zit.php”. The malware_\ndeletes the stolen data files and malware component files except “%TEMP%\\htn.txt”:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file is detected by only a few security vendors on popular threat intelligence sharing\nportal VirusTotal at the time of writing this blog indicates its spreading potential:\n\nEvidence of the detection by RTDMI ™ engine can be seen below in the Capture ATP\nreport for this file:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
