While the malicious VBA code\nand the dropped payloads were something we had seen before, it was the specific way in\nwhich the Excel documents themselves were created that caught our attention.\n\nThe creators of the malicious Excel documents used a technique that allows them to create\nmacro-laden Excel workbooks, without actually using Microsoft Office. As a side effect of this\nparticular way of working, the detection rate for these documents is typically lower than for\nstandard maldocs.\n\nThis blog post provides an overview of how these malicious documents came to be. In\naddition, it briefly describes the observed payloads and finally closes with recommendations\nas well as indicators of compromise to help defend your organization from such attacks.\n\n## Key Findings (TL;DR)\n\nThe malicious Microsoft Office documents are created using the EPPlus software\nrather than Microsoft Office Excel, these documents may fly under the radar as it differs\nfrom a typical Excel document;\nNVISO assesses with medium confidence that this campaign is delivered by a single\nthreat actor based on the limited number of documents uploaded to services such as\nVirusTotal, and the similarities in payloads delivery throughout this campaign;\nThe payloads that have been observed up to the date of the release of this post, have\nbeen, for the most part, so called information stealers with the intention of harvesting\npasswords from browsers, email clients, etc.;\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payloads stemming from these documents have evolved only slightly in terms of\nobfuscation and masquerading. This is another indication of a single actor who is\nslowly evolving their technical prowess.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe analysis section below is divided in two parts and refers to a specific link in the infection\nchain.\n\n### Malicious document analysis\n\n[In an earlier blog post, we wrote about “VBA Purging”[1], which is a technique to remove](https://blog.nviso.eu/2020/02/25/evidence-of-vba-purging-found-in-malicious-documents/)\ncompiled VBA code from VBA projects. We were interested to see if any malicious\ndocuments found in-the-wild were adopting this technique (it lowers the initial detection rate\nof antivirus products). This is how we stumbled upon a set of peculiar malicious documents.\n\nAt first, we thought they were created with Excel, and were then VBA purged. But closer\nexamination leads us to believe that these documents are created with a .NET library that\ncreates Office Open XML (OOXML) spreadsheets. As stated in our VBA Purging blog post,\nOffice documents can also lack compiled VBA code when they are created with tools that are\ntotally independent from Microsoft Office. EPPlus is such a tool. We are familiar with this\n.NET library, as we have been using it since a couple of years to create malicious documents\n(“maldocs”) for our red team and penetration testers.\n\nWhen we noticed that the maldocs had no compiled code, and were also missing Office\nmetadata, we quickly thought about EPPlus. This library also creates OOXML files without\ncompiled VBA code and without Office metadata.\n\nThe OOXML file format is an Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) format: a ZIP container\nwith mainly XML files, and possibly binary files (like pictures). It was first introduced by\nMicrosoft with the release of Office 2007. OOXML spreadsheets use extension .xlsx and\n.xlsm (for spreadsheets with macros).\n\nWhen a VBA project is created with EPPlus, it does not contain compiled VBA code. EPPlus\nhas no methods to create compiled code: the algorithms to create compiled VBA code are\nproprietary to Microsoft.\n\nThe very first malicious document we detected was created on 22nd of June 2020, and since\nthen 200+ malicious documents were found over a period of 2 months. The actor has\nincreased their activity in the last weeks, as now we see more than 10 new malicious\ndocuments on some days.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Unique maldocs observed per day\n\nThe maldocs discovered over the course of two months have many properties that are quite\ndifferent from the properties of documents created with Microsoft Office. We believe this is\nthe case because they are created with a tool independent from Microsoft Excel. Although\nwe don’t have a copy of the exact tool used by the threat actor to create these malicious\ndocuments, the malicious documents created by this tool have many properties that\nconvince us that they were created with the aforementioned EPPlus software.\n\nSome of EPPlus’ properties include, but are not limited to:\n\nPowerful and versatile library: not only can it create spreadsheets containing a VBA\nproject, but that project can also be password protected and/or digitally signed. It does\nnot rely on Microsoft Office. It can also run on Mono (cross platform, open-source\n.NET).\nOOXML files created with EPPlus have some properties that distinguish them from\nOOXML files created with Excel. Here is an overview:\n\nZIP Date: every file included in a ZIP file has a timestamp (DOSDATE and\nDOSTIME field in the ZIPFILE record). For documents created (or edited) with\nMicrosoft Office, this timestamp is always 1980-01-01 00:00:00 (0x0021 for\nDOSDATE and 0x0000 for DOSTIME). OOXML files created with EPPlus have a\ntimestamp that corresponds to the creation time of the document. Usually, that\ntimestamp is the same for all files inside the OOXML files, but due to execution\ndelays, there can be a difference of 2 seconds between timestamp. 2 seconds is\nthe resolution of the DOSTIME format.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – DOSTIME difference (left: EPPlus created file)\n\nExtra ZIP records: a typical ZIP file is composed of ZIP file records (magic 50 4B 03\n04) with metadata for the file, and the (compressed) file content. Then there are ZIP\ndirectory entries (magic 50 4B 01 02) followed by a ZIP end-of-directory record (magic\n50 4B 05 06). Microsoft Office creates OOXML files containing these 3 ZIP record\ntypes. EPPlus creates OOXML files containing 4 ZIP records: it also includes a ZIP\ndata description record (magic 50 4B 07 08) after each ZIP file record.\n\nFigure 3 – Extra ZIP records (left: EPPlus created file)\n\nMissing Office document metadata: an OOXML document created with Microsoft Office\ncontains metadata (author, title, …). This metadata is stored inside XML files found\ninside the docProps folder. By default, documents created with EPPlus don’t have\nmetadata: there is no docProps folder inside the ZIP container.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 – Missing metadata (left: EPPlus created file)\n\nVBA Purged: OOXML files with a VBA project created with Microsoft Office contain an\nOLE file (vbaProject.bin) with streams containing the compiled VBA code and the\ncompressed VBA source code. Documents created with EPPlus do not contain\ncompiled VBA code, only compressed VBA source code. This means that:\n\nThe module streams only contain compressed VBA code\nThere are no SRP streams (SRP streams contain implementation-specific and\nversion-dependent compile code, theire name starts with __SRP_)\nThe _VBA_PROJECT stream does not contain compiled VBA code. In fact, the\ncontent of the _VBA_PROJECT stream is hardcoded in the EPPlus source code:\nit’s always CC 61 FF FF 00 00 00.\n\nFigure 5 – Hardcoded stream content (left: EPPlus created file)\n\nIn addition to the above, we have also observed some properties of the VBA source code\nthat hints at the use of a creation tool based on a library like EPPlus.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are a couple of variants to the VBA source code used by the actor (some variants use\nPowerShell to download the payload, others use pure VBA code). But all these variants\ncontain a call to a loader function with one argument, a string with the URL (either BASE64\nor hexadecimal encoded). Like this (hexadecimal example):\n```\nLoader”68 74 74 70 …”\n\n```\nDo note that there is no space character between the function name and the argument: there\nis no space between Loader and ”68 74 74 70 …”.\n\nThis is an indication that the VBA code was not entered through the VBA EDI in Office: when\nyou type a statement like this, without space character, the VBA EDI will automatically add a\nspace character for you (even if you copy/paste the code). The absence of this space\ncharacter divulges that this code was not entered through the VBA EDI, but likely via a library\nsuch as EPPlus.\n\nTo illustrate these differences in properties, we show examples with one of our internal tools\n(ExcelVBA) using the EPPlus library. We create a vba.xlsm file with the vba code in text file\nvba.txt using our tool ExcelVBA, and show some of its properties.:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 – NVISO created XLSM file using the EPPlus library\n\nFigure 7 – Running oledump.py reveals this document was created using the EPPlus library\n\nSome of the malicious documents contain objects that clearly have been created with\nEPPlus, using some of the example code found on the EPPlus Wiki. We illustrate this with\nthe following example (the first document in this campaign):\n\n**Filename: Scan Order List.xlsm**\n\n**MD5: 8857fae198acd87f7581c7ef7227c34d**\n\n**SHA256: 8a863b5f154e1ddba695453fdd0f5b83d9d555bae6cf377963c9009c9fa6c9be**\n\n**File** **Size: 5.77 KB (5911 bytes)**\n\n**Earliest Contents Modification: 2020-06-22 14:01:46**\n\nThis document contains a drawing1.xml object (a rounded rectangle) with this name:\nname=”VBASampleRect”.\n\nFigure 8 – zipdump of maldoc\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 – Selecting the drawing1.xml object reveals the name\n\n[This was created with sample code found on the EPPlus Wiki[2]:](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus/wiki/VBA)\n\nFigure 10 – EPPlus sample code, clearly showing the similarities\n\nNoteworthy is that all maldocs we observed have their VBA project protected with a\npassword. It is interesting to note that the VBA code itself is not encoded/encrypted, it is\n[stored in cleartext (although compressed) [3]. When a document with a password protected](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2020/07/20/cracking-vba-project-passwords/)\n\n\n-----\n\nVBA project is opened, the VBA macros will execute without the password: the user does not\nneed to provide the password. The password is only required to view the VBA project inside\nthe VBA IDE (Integrated Development Environment):\n\nFigure 11 – Password prompt for viewing the VBA project\n\nWe were not able to recover these passwords. We used John the Ripper with the rockyou.txt\n[password list[4], and Hashcat with a small ASCII brute-force attack.](https://www.kaggle.com/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt)\n\nAlthough each malicious document is unique with its own VBA code, with more than 200\nsamples analyzed to date, we can generalize and abstract all this VBA code to just a handful\nof templates. The VBA code will either use PowerShell or ActiveX objects to download the\npayload. The different strings are encoded using either hexadecimal, BASE64 or XORencoding; or a combination of these encodings. A Yara rule to detect these maldocs is\nprovided at the end of this blog post for identification and detection purposes.\n\n### Payload analysis\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, via the malicious VBA code, a second-stage payload\nis downloaded from various websites. Each second-stage executable created by its\nrespective malicious document acts as dropper for the final payload. In order to thwart\ndetection mechanisms such as antivirus solutions, a variety of obfuscation techniques are\nleveraged which are however not advanced enough to hide the malicious intent. The\ninfrastructure used by the threat actor appears to mainly comprise compromised websites.\n\n\n-----\n\nPopular antivirus solutions such as those listed on VirusTotal, shown in Figure 12, commonly\nidentify the second-stage executables as “AgentTesla”. While leveraging VirusTotal for\nmalware identification is not an ideal method, it does display how simple obfuscation can\nresult in an incorrect classification. Throughout this analysis, we’ll explain how only few of\nthese popular detections turned out to be accurate.\n\nFigure 12: VirusTotal “AgentTesla” mis-identification.\n\nThe different obfuscation techniques we observed outline a pattern common to all secondstage executables of operation Epic Manchego. As can be observed in Figure 13, the\nsecond stage will dynamically load a decryption DLL. This DLL component then proceeds to\nextract additional settings and a third-stage payload before transferring the execution to the\nfinal payload, typically an information stealer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Operation Epic Manchego final stage delivery mechanism.\n\nAlthough the above obfuscation pattern is common to all samples, we have observed an\nevolution in its complexity as well as a wide variation in perhaps more opportunistic\ntechniques.\n\n**Early Variants** **Recent Variants**\n\n\n**DLL Component**\n**Obfuscation**\n\n**Final Payload**\n**Obfuscation**\n\n**Opportunistic**\n**Obfuscation**\n\n\nObfuscated base64\nencoding\n\n\nSingle-PNG encoding Multi-BMP dictionary encoding\n\nName randomisation Run-time method resolving, Goto flowcontrol, …\n\n\nEmpty fixed-size structures\n\n\nTable 1 – Variant comparison\n\n\n-----\n\nA common factor of the operation s second-stage samples is the usage of steganography to\nobfuscate their malicious intent. Figure 14 identifies a partial configuration used in recent\nvariants where a dictionary of settings, including the final payload, is encoded into hundreds\nof images as part of the second-stage’s embedded resources.\n\nFigure 14: Partial dictionary encoded in a BMP image\n\nThe image itself is part of the following second-stage sample which has the following\nproperties:\n\n**Filename: crefgyu.exe**\n\n**MD5: 7D71F885128A27C00C4D72BF488CD7CC**\n\n**SHA256:**\nC40FA887BE0159016F3AFD43A3BDEC6D11078E19974B60028B93DEF1C2F95726\n\n**File** **Size: 761 KB (779.776 bytes)**\n\n**Compilation Timestamp: 2020-03-09 16:39:33**\n\nNoteworthy is the likelihood that the obfuscation process is not built by the threat actors\nthemselves. A careful review of the second-stage steganography decoding routine uncovers\nhow most samples mistakenly contain the final payload twice. In the following representation\n(Figure 15) of the loader’s configuration we can see that its payload is indeed duplicated.\nThe complexity of the second- and third-stage payloads furthermore tend to suggest the\noperation involves different actors as the initial documents reflect a less experienced actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThroughout the multiple dictionary-based variants analyzed we furthermore noticed that,\nregardless of the final payload, similar keys were used as part of the settings. All dictionaries\ncontained the final payload as “EpkVBztLXeSpKwe” while some, as seen in Figure 15, also\ncontained the same value as “PXcli.0.XdHg”. This suggests a possible builder for payload\ndelivery, which may be used by multiple actors.\n\nFigure 15: Stage 2 decoded dictionary\n\nWithin the manually analyzed dataset of 30 distinct dictionary-based second stages, 19\nunique final payloads were observed. From these, the “Azorult” stealer accounts for 50% of\nthe variant’s delivery (Figure 16). Other payloads include “AgentTesla”, “Formbook”, “Matiex”\nand “njRat”, which are all well-documented already. Both “Azurult” and “njRAT” have a\nnoticeable reusage rate.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16: Dictionary-based payload classification and (re-)usage of samples with trimmed\nhashes\n\nOur analysis of droppers and respective payloads uncovered a common pattern in\nobfuscation routines. While opportunistic obfuscation methods may evolve, the delivered\npayloads remain part of a rather limited set of malware families.\n\n### Targeting\n\nA small number of the malicious documents we retrieved from VirusTotal were uploaded\ntogether with the phishing email itself. Analysis of these emails can shed some light on the\npotential targets of this actor. Due to the limited number of source emails retrieved, it was not\n\n\n-----\n\npossible to identify a clear pattern based on the victims. In the 6 emails we were able to\nretrieve, recipients were in the medical equipment sector, aluminium sector, facility\nmanagement and a vendor for custom made press machines.\n\nWhen looking into the sender domains, it appears most emails are sent from legitimate\n[companies. Having used the “Have I Been Pwned”[5] service to confirm if any of the email](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)\naddresses were known to be compromised, turned up with no results. This leaves us to\nwonder whether the threat actor was able to leverage these accounts during an earlier\ninfection or whether a different party supplied them. Regardless of who compromised the\naccounts, it appears the threat actor primarily uses legitimate corporate email accounts to\ninitiate the phishing campaign.\n\nLooking at both sender and recipient, there doesn’t appear to be a pattern we can deduce to\nidentify potential new targets. There does not seem to be a specific sector targeted nor are\nthe sending domains affiliated with each other.\n\nBoth body (content) and subject of the emails relate to a more classic phishing scheme, for\nexample, a request to initiate business for which the attachment provides the ‘details’. An\noverview of subjects observed can be seen below, note some subjects have been altered by\nthe respective mail gateways:\n\nRe: Quotation required/\nQuote volume and weight for preferred\n*****SPAM***** FW:Offer_10044885_[companyname]_2_09_2020.xlsx*\n\n[SUSPECTED SPAM] Alternatives for Request*\nPurchase Order Details\nQuotation Request\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17 – Sample phishing email\n\nThis method of enticing users to open the attachments is nothing new and does not provide\na lot of additional information to pinpoint the campaign targeting any specific organisation or\nverticals.\n\nHowever, leveraging public submissions of the maldocs through VirusTotal, we clustered\nover 200 documents, which allowed us to rank 27 countries by submission count without\ndifferentiating between uploads possibly performed through VPNs. As shown in Figure 18,\nareas such as the United States, Czech Republic, France, Germany, as well as China,\naccount for the majority of targeted regions.\n\nFigure 18 – Geographical distribution of VT submissions\n\nWhen analysing the initial documents for targeted regions, we primarily identified English,\nSpanish, Chinese and Turkish language-based images.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19 – Maldoc content in Chinese, Turkish, Spanish and English respectively\n\nSome images however contained an interesting detail: some of the document properties are\nin Cyrillic, and this regardless of the image’s primary language.\n\nAlthough the Cyrillic Word settings were observed in multiple images, a new maldoc detected\nat time of writing this blog post piqued our interest, as it appears to be the first one to\nexplicitly impersonate a healthcare sector member (“Ohiohealth Hardin Memorial Hospital”),\nas can be observed in Figure 20. Note also the settings as described above: СТРАНИЦА 1\n_ИЗ 1; which means page 1 of 1._\n\nFigure 20 – Maldoc content impersonating “Ohiohealth Hardin Memorial Hospital” with\nCyrillic Word settings\n\nThis Microsoft Excel document has the following details:\n\n**Filename: 새로운** 주문 _2608.xlsm (Korean: New order _2608.xlsm)\n\n**MD5: 551b5dd7aff4ee07f98d11aac910e174**\n\n**SHA256: 45cab564386a568a4569d66f6781c6d0b06a9561ae4ac362f0e76a8abfede7bb**\n\n**File** **Size: 5.77 KB (5911 bytes)**\n\n**Earliest Contents Modification: 2020-06-22 14:01:46**\n\nWhile the template from said hospital may have been simply discovered on the web and\nconsequently used by the threat actor, this surprising change in modus operandi does\nappear to align with the actor’s constant evolution observed since the start of tracking.\n\n## Assessment\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the analysis, NVISO assesses the following:\n\nThe threat actor observed has worked out a new method to create malicious Office\ndocuments with a way to at least slightly reduce detection mechanisms;\nThe actor is likely experimenting and evolving its methodology in which malicious Office\ndocuments are created, potentially automating the workflow;\nWhile the targeting seems rather limited for now, it’s possible these first runs were\nintended for testing rather than a full-fledged campaign;\nRecent uptick in detections submitted to VirusTotal confirms the actor may be ramping\nup their operations;\nWhile the approach to create malicious documents is unique, the methodologies for\npayload delivery as well as actual payloads are not, and should be stopped or detected\nby modern technologies;\nOf interest is a recent blog post published by Xavier Mertens on the SANS diary\n[Tracking A Malware Campaign Through VT[6]. It appears another security researcher](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Tracking+A+Malware+Campaign+Through+VT/26498/)\nhas also been tracking these documents, however, they have extracted the VBA code\nfrom the maldocs and uploaded that portion. These templates relate to the PowerShell\nway of downloading the next stage.\n\nIn conclusion, NVISO assesses this specific malicious Excel document creation technique is\nlikely to be observed more in the wild, albeit missed by email gateways or analysts, as\npayload analysis is often considered more interesting. However, blocking and detection of\nthese types of novelties, such as the maldoc creation described in this blog, enables\norganizations to detect and respond quicker in case an uptick or similar campaign occurs.\nThe recommendations section provides ruling and indicators as a means of detection.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nFilter email attachments and emails sent from outside your organization;\nImplement robust endpoint detect and respond defenses;\nCreate phishing awareness trainings and perform a phishing exercise.\n\n### YARA\n\nWe provide the following rule to implement in your detection mechanisms for use in further\nhunting missions.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule xlsm_without_metadata_and_with_date {\n  meta:\n    description = \"Identifies .xlsm files created with EPPlus\"\n    author = \"NVISO (Didier Stevens)\"\n    date = \"2020-07-12\"\n    reference = \"http://blog.nviso.eu/2020/09/01/epic-manchego-atypical-maldocdelivery-brings-flurry-of-infostealers\"\n    tlp = \"White\"\n  strings:\n    $opc = \"[Content_Types].xml\"\n    $ooxml = \"xl/workbook.xml\"\n    $vba = \"xl/vbaProject.bin\"\n    $meta1 = \"docProps/core.xml\"\n    $meta2 = \"docProps/app.xml\"\n    $timestamp = {50 4B 03 04 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 00 00 21 00}\n  condition:\n    uint32be(0) == 0x504B0304 and ($opc and $ooxml and $vba)\n    and not (any of ($meta*) and $timestamp)\n}\n\n```\nThis rule will match documents with VBA code created with EPPlus, even if they are not\nmalicious. We had only a couple of false positives with this rule (documents created with\nother benign software), and quite some corrupt samples (incomplete ZIP files).\n\n### INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE (IOCs)\n\n[Indicators of compromise can be found on our Github page here.](https://github.com/NVISO-BE/nviso-cti/tree/master/Epic_Manchego_IOC)\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK MAPPING\n\n**Initial Access:**\n\nT1566.001 Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\n**Execution:**\n\nT1204.002 User Execution: Malicious File\n**Defense Evasion:**\n\nT1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\nT1036.005 Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location\nT1027.001 Obfuscate Files or Information: Binary Padding\nT1027.002 Obfuscate Files or Information: Software Packing\nT1027.003 Obfuscate Files or Information: Steganography\nT1055.001 Process Injection: DLL Injection\nT1055.002 Process Injection: PE Injection\nT1497.001 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: System Checks\n\n### Authors\n\nThis blog post was created based on the collaborative effort of :\n\n\n-----",
