Cisco Talos recently discovered an interesting campaign affecting\nLinux systems employing a multi-modular botnet with several ways to spread and a payload focused on providing financial benefits for\nthe attacker by mining Monero online currency.\n\nThe actor employs various methods to spread across the network, like harvesting client-side certificates for spreading to known hosts\nusing ssh, or spreading to systems with an incorrectly configured Docker API.\n\n**What's new?**\n\nWe believe this is the first time anyone's documented Xanthe's operations. The actor is actively maintaining all the modules and has\nbeen active since March this year.\n\n**How did it work?**\n\nThe infection starts with the downloader module, which downloads the main installer module, which is also tasked with spreading to\nother systems on the local and remote networks. The main module attempts to spread to other known hosts by stealing the client-side\ncertificates and connecting to them without the requirement for a password.\n\nTwo additional bash scripts terminate security services, removing competitor's botnets and ensuring persistence by creating scheduled\ncron jobs and modifying one of the system startup scripts.\n\nThe main payload is a variant of the XMRig Monero mining program that is protected with a shared object developed to hide the\npresence of the miner's process from various tools for process enumeration.\n\n**So what?**\n\nDefenders need to be constantly vigilant and monitor the behavior of systems within their network. Attackers are like water — they look\nfor the smallest crack to seep in, like we see in Xanthe's potential to spread using systems with exposed Docker API. While\norganizations need to be focused on protecting their most valuable assets, they should not ignore threats that are not specifically\ntargeted at their infrastructure.\n\n## Technical case overview\n\n**Introduction**\n\nHoneypots are one of the most commonly used systems for collecting new threats and threat intelligence, with a number of opensource implementations. Cisco Talos and the Cisco Security & Trust organization deploy numerous honeypots tracking attacks on\nmany platforms, protocols and applications.\n\nDocker has been one of the most popular platforms for managing containers. Over time it became a de facto standard for development\nand deployment of web and cloud applications. However, anybody who has worked with Docker quickly realises that the learning curve\nis quite steep. Therefore Docker installations can be easily misconfigured and Docker daemon exposed to external networks with a\nminimal level of security.\n\nAccording to Shodan, there are over 6,000 incorrectly-configured Docker implementations exposed to the internet, and attackers have\nbeen actively finding ways to exploit those exposed servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Incorrectly configured Docker installations with exposed, unprotected APIs according to Shodan_\n\nDocker daemons have been targets of attacks for several years now, and our security teams decided to keep tracking activities related\nto various actors attempting to exploit them.\n\n**Docker honeypot**\n\n[The Cisco Security and Trust organization developed an implementation of a Docker honeypot. The Docker honeypot is a simple](https://github.com/ciscocsirt/dhp)\nserver that emulates some aspects of the Docker HTTP API. The server will respond to:\n\nHTTP GET version\nHTTP GET ping\nHTTP POST create image\nHTTP Error Code 500 in almost all other cases\n\nThe assumption is that this service is running in a cloud provider somewhere. Currently, the service is a script that runs in a shell.\nWhen a recon event or the creation of a container is detected, the server will log the event to any of the following services:\n\nWebex Teams\nSlack\nMongodb\nHTTP Collector\n\nAs a part of reconnaissance, the honeypots log suspicious activity related to the potential Docker attacks. This is where we recently\nspotted the following attempt:\n\n**Xanthe - a Docker-aware crypto miner**\n\nThe attempt belongs to a relatively unknown crypto mining botnet, which we will call Xanthe, based on the file name of the main\nspreading script. When investigating open-source information, we found earlier samples of the bot on VirusTotal detected by a very\nfew anti-malware engines. In fact, despite Xanthe having been active since March 2020, only one of the scripts had been detected.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Older Xanthe versions and the VirusTotal detections_\n\nThe initial script, pop.sh, is a simple downloader script which downloads and runs the main bot module xanthe.sh, which then\ndownloads and runs all additional modules. It is also tasked with scanning the network and spreading to other systems over SSH and\nby exploiting Docker daemon installations with exposed web API.\n\nThere are four modules that are downloaded and launched:\n\nProcess-hiding module libprocesshider.so\nShell script to disable other miners and security services\nShell script to remove Docker containers of competing Docker-targeting crypto mining trojans\nXMRig binary together with a downloaded JSON configuration file, config.json\n\n_Xanthe, its modules and the spreading vectors_\n\n**Main module - xanthe.sh**\n\n\n-----\n\nXanthe.sh, as well as most of the other Xanthe modules, is a shell script tasked to load additional modules and spread the bot to other\nsystems.\n\nThe main Xanthe module starts with an initialization procedure that attempts to download and run two additional modules: xesa.txt and\nfczyo. We describe both in detail in the next section.\n\nThe next procedure downloads a variant of the XMRig miner as java_c, its JSON configuration file and the libprocesshider shared\nlibrary used for hiding the miner process name in memory. The integrity of every downloaded file is verified with a hardcoded MD5\nchecksum value. If the MD5 checksum is not verified, the download is reattempted.\n\nThe URLs for download are hardcoded in an array per URL, with direct IP addresses 139[.]162[.]124[.]27 and 34[.]92[.]166[.]158 used\nfor download. At the moment of writing this post, the IP address 34[.]92[.]166[.]158 runs an NginX version 1.19.2, which was released\nin August this year. The address 139[.]162[.]124[.]27 runs a Debian Linux distribution with an older Apache version 2.4.10 serving the\nfiles. Both of the server directories, /files/, used to host the malicious files are open and potentially misconfigured.\n\nXanthe uses curl to download its modules and to communicate with the logging URLs. Iplogger.org is extensively used throughout the\ncode, with each procedure communicating with a unique logging URL. Curl's user agent strings are manually specified for each\nrequest depending on the phase and the functionality currently being executed.\n\n_User-agent strings and the associated functionality_\n\nThe execution of the main module continues with making sure that the /tmp directory is mounted and configured to allow execution of\nthe files within it.\n\nNext, the procedure checks if the miner is already running in memory by running the ps command. First, the loading of the\nlibprocesshider is disabled, then ps is used to make sure the java_c process is running.\n\n**sshd configuration and spreading**\n\nThe main infection vector for this variant of Xanthe seems to be SSH, which is achieved by specifying client-side certificates stored for\nknown hosts.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, Xanthe configures the SSH daemon to make its configuration less secure and enable some functionality. The daemon is\n[configured to run on ports 22 and 33768 with the root account login, password, client public key and GSSAPIAuthentication (such as](https://www.ssh.com/manuals/clientserver-product/52/Secureshell-gssapiuserauthentication.html)\n[Kerberos authentication) enabled. Once the configuration file is modified, the SSH service is restarted.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol))\n\nFinally, we come to the spreading function, localgo. The function starts with a fetch of the externally-visible IP address of the infected\nhost by connecting to icanhazip.com. Next, the script uses the find utility to search for instances of client-side certificates, which will be\nused for authentication to remote hosts. The find is used to search for any filenames starting with the string 'id_rsa' and for files with\nthe '.pem' file extension. The script also uses a combination of 'cat' and 'grep' to find other keys by parsing the SSH configuration files\nand the bash history file.\n\nOnce all possible keys have been found, the script proceeds with finding known hosts, TCP ports and usernames used to connect to\nthose hosts. Finally, a loop is entered which iterates over the combination of all known usernames, hosts, keys and ports in an attempt\nto connect, authenticate on the remote host and launch the command lines to download and execute the main module on the remote\nsystem.\n\n_SSH Xanthe-based spreading command_\n\n**Available functionality commented out**\n\nAlthough we have seen this bot hitting our Docker honeypots with an attempt to spread, at the time of the analysis the routine for\nDocker scanning and spreading was commented out. The author's programming style is similar in all scripts. First the functions are\ndefined and implemented, with all the flow defined towards the bottom of the script, where the actor can choose which functionality to\nexhibit by commenting out undesirable function calls.\n\n_Functions are enabled/disabled by commenting a line using the character #_\n\nThe Docker spreading functionality is contained within the function 'scangogo'. The function first attempts to install the mass portscanning utility masscan to scan the local network, as well as the /24 subnet of the external IP address, for the hosts with incorrectly\nconfigured Docker API exposed on TCP port 2375.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf a suitable exposed Docker API is found, Xanthe will attempt to run Docker with the parameter pointing to the remote host, create a\nnew container based on the busybox image and run the command to launch the downloader bash script pop.sh.\n\n**Auxiliary shell scripts**\n\nAs soon as the main module is launched, it downloads and runs the two auxiliary modules, xesa.txt and fczyo.\n\nXesa.txt - the killer module\n\nXesa starts initially with removing the system log file and adding a number of IP addresses to the /etc/hosts file so that they are\nresolved locally by the DNS resolver to 0.0.0.0 and blocked. The IP addresses are related to competing botnets and security services\nsuch as the [Alibaba cloud security center agent. Xesa also attempts to delete several accounts, which seem to be related to](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/security-center)\n[competing botnets such as Kinsing.](https://threatpost.com/self-propagating-malware-docker-ports/154453/)\n\nThe execution continues with running a large number of ps commands to determine if competitive miners are running on the infected\nsystem. If any of the miners are found, their processes will be terminated and files removed from the system.\n\n_Docker images of competitor's miners being removed from the infected system_\n\nOne of the main Xesa functions is terminating competitor's Docker containers if they are running and removing their images from the\nlocal Docker repository. The script finishes with another check that the java_c process is running.\n\nFczyo - persistence and remote access setup\n\nThe second auxiliary module, fczyo, is similar to xesa.txt, but it covers slightly different areas of the system for termination. The\nexecution starts with adding two of the public DNS servers, 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8, to the beginning of the /etc/resolve.conf file and\nrestarting the DNS resolver to use those public servers. It then continues with terminating competing Docker containers if they are\nrunning.\n\nThe script makes sure that the security processes are not running on the infected system and ensures that crond is running so the\nscheduled jobs can be executed.\n\nFczyo attempts to add the following users to the infected system:\n\nsysall\nsystem\nlogger\nautoupdater\n\nOnce the users are created, the script adds them to the list of sudoers so that they can run commands with administrative privileges.\nThe script also adds a public key to the SSH configuration to allow those users access to the host using the client-side private key.\nIptables are used to configure the firewall to allow connections coming from the IP address 64[.]225[.]46[.]44 and to drop all incoming\nconnections to ports 2375 and 2376, presumably to avoid reinfection of the system by other bots scanning for misconfigured Docker\nAPI installations\n\n\n-----\n\nFczyo checking if the cron job is already configured\n\nThe next major block of functions is tasked with setting up scheduled cron jobs to ensure that Xanthe modules are downloaded and\nrun from the download server every 30 minutes. It also modifies the file /etc/rc.d/rc.local so Xanthe can be downloaded and run every\ntime the system is started.\n\n[Fczyo also attempts to clear bash history, disable and remove ufw and any file belonging to the Sandfly security products.](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW)\n\n**Process-hiding module**\n\nXanthe and its auxiliary modules use a shared object, libprocesshider, which is downloaded and installed into\n/usr/local/lib/libprocesshider.so. The loading of the shared object is enabled by adding the path of the library to the file\n/etc/ld.so.preload. Ld.so.preload contains a list of user-specified ELF shared libraries to be loaded before all others. This can be used\nto selectively override functions in other shared libraries.\n\nProcess tools such as ps use the /proc file system and the readdir function to enumerate all the running processes. If a malicious\nshared object is used to implement a malicious copy of the readdir function, this function will be called before the standard library\nfunction. The malicious function then has the ability to modify the results of the readdir to omit details of some processes. The source\ncode of the library is publicly available on Github, so the attacker only had to modify a hardcoded string containing the name of the\nprocess executable that needs to be hidden, in our case java_c.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn this post, we documented the previously-undocumented Monero mining botnet Xanthe, which attempts to spread over SSH using\nexisting private keys for authentication. We discovered this botnet when it registered in a Docker honeypot system. The main module\ncontains functions, disabled in this variant, to spread by exploiting incorrectly configured Docker API installations.\n\nWhile Docker remains an essential tool for development and deployment of applications, it is worth remembering that its learning curve\nis steep. The installation is not secure by default, and it is easy to leave its API exposed to attackers on a lookout for 'free' resources\nthey can use to run custom containers and conduct attacks.\n\nWhen setting up organizations' defences, administrators and devops engineers need to make sure all components in their product\ndevelopment and deployment systems are properly configured and secure.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware used by these threat actors.
