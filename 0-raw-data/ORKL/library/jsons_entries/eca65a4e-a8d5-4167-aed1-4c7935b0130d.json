Think of an ISP or a hosting provider, but also a large corporation or a\nuniversity, many of which manage one or more autonomous systems. Each AS is assigned\na unique number, called an ASN; in practice the terms AS and ASN are often used\ninterchangeably.\n\nASNs play a crucial role in routing and thus in making the Internet work. But because each\nof them is managed by a single entity, it also makes sense to assign a reputation to them,\nbased on the amount of malicious activity hosted on the AS.\n\nSilent Push assigns a reputation to each ASN, that takes into account both the number of\nactive IP addresses within the AS and the number of these that are currently being used for\nmalicious activities.\n\nThe reputation of an ASN reflects the current state rather than a historical reputation, so\nthat ASNs that shut down malicious activity will see their reputation drop immediately.\nHistoric reputation data is available through the API.\n\nThe following are the ASNs with the worst reputation — each of them has the maximum\nreputation score of 100 — ranked by the number of IP addresses currently listed:\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, all of ASNs are all quite small, with each containing 2048 or fewer IP addresses.\nThey host a relatively large amount of malicious activity, but in absolute terms, their\ncontribution to ‘bad things on the Internet’ is pretty small.\n\nSo let’s look at those ASN with contain at least 100,000 IP addresses (active or not):\n\n\n-----\n\nNow a number of well-known companies appear in the list, including Tencent, Digital\nOcean, Alibaba and Google.\n\nEach of these cloud providers make it easy for someone to quickly and more or less\nanonymously set up a virtual server. That has many advantages for researchers and\ndevelopers but also attracts those hosting malicious infrastructure, such as malware\nauthors or those providing services to them.\n\nWe would certainly not recommend blocking something just because it is hosted at any of\nthese providers. But something unknown hosted there definitely deserves some extra\nscrutiny.\n\n## Takedown reputation\n\n\n-----\n\nIn fairness, it is unreasonable to expect a hosting provider or other network to be able to\nproactively block all malicious activity on its network. After all, it’s not like a malicious actor\nis open about their intentions when renting a server or purchasing a domain.\n\nThis is why at Silent Push, we also assign a ‘takedown reputation’ to each ASN, that\nassigns a score from 0 to 100 that measures how well (or how badly, for 0 is the best score)\nan ASN takes down malicious activity hosted on its network.\n\nIf we add the takedown reputations to the previous table, we note they are all low, but in\nsome cases not 0, leaving some room for improvement for these ASNs when it comes to\ntheir due diligence in keeping the Internet free of malware and scams.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, we can look at the ASNs with the worst takedown reputation. These are all pretty\nsmall, containing 4096 IP addresses or fewer, and have a takedown reputation higher than\n90:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSimply ranking ASNs or hosting providers by the number of IP addresses that are hosting\nor have hosted malicious content ignores both their actual size and their responsiveness\nwhen it comes to takedown requests. By including both, Silent Push provides you with a\nclearer picture of what ASNs to consider somewhat suspicious, which combined with other\ncontext can help during an investigation.\n\n[Martijn Grooten](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6085b1971ccba8696c78f75c)\n\n\n-----",
