In this edition we discuss the cyber landscape within the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\n Introduction\n\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), known in the West as North Korea, is a unique\ncountry with a military-focused society and an unconventional technology infrastructure. While\nNorth Korea was formerly on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, it was removed in 2008.[1]\nHowever, due to North Korea’s hostility toward other nations, its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and\nhuman rights violations against its own citizens, the United Nations and many Western entities\nhave placed sanctions and embargoes against North Korea.[2] [3] For example, U.S. export laws\nforbid the sale of dual-use technologies, or those that can be used or repurposed for both civilian\nand military use, to North Korea.[4] [5] Additionally, the U.S. has a military alliance with the Republic of\nKorea (ROK), known in the West as South Korea, North Korea’s primary target of conflict.[6]\n\nDue to North Korea’s global interactions, its cyber warfare capabilities are of particular interest to\nthe U.S. According to a 2009 report by Major Steve Sin, an intelligence analyst at U.S. Forces\nKorea, North Korean hackers have successfully penetrated U.S. defense networks more\nfrequently than any other country that has targeted U.S. defense assets.[7] While Major Sin may\nhave been overly optimistic about North Korea’s abilities, it is clear that they should not be\nunderestimated. Frank Cilluffo, co-director of the Cyber Center for National and Economic Security\nat George Washington University, testified before Congress that North Korea’s cyber capability\n\"poses an important 'wild card' threat, not only to the United States but also to the region and\nbroader international stability…\"[8] In an April 2014 testimony given to the House Armed Services\nCommittee, General Curtis M. Scaparrotti noted that “North Korea remains a significant threat to\nUnited States’ interests, the security of South Korea, and the international community due to its\nwillingness to use force, its continued development and proliferation of nuclear weapon and longrange ballistic missile programs, and its abuse of its citizens’ human rights, as well as the\nlegitimate interests of its neighbors and the international community.” Scaparrotti stressed that\n“While North Korea’s massive conventional forces have been declining due to aging and lack of\nresources…North Korea is emphasizing the development of its asymmetric capabilities. North\n\n1 http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/05/25/why_the_state_department_wont_put_north_korea_back_on_the_terror_list\n2 http://www.sanctionswiki.org/North_Korea\n3 https://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo/eo-13551.pdf\n4 http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/17/un-computer-shipment-to-north-korean-regime-violates-us-manufacturers-ban/\n5 http://www.state.gov/strategictrade/overview/\n6 http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20140402/101985/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-ScaparrottiUSAC-20140402.pdf\n7 http://www.nextgov.com/defense/whats-brewin/2009/07/north-koreas-hackers-in-a-luxury-hotel/51330/\n8 http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/2013/1019/In-cyberarms-race-North-Korea-emerging-as-a-power-not-a-pushover/(page)/3\n\n\n-----\n\nKorea’s asymmetric arsenal includes…an active cyber warfare capability.”[9] While one would expect\nthe regime’s digital infrastructure to also suffer from aging or lack of resources, these factors do\nnot take away from their technical abilities to wage cyber warfare.\n\nWhile the U.S. views North Korea’s cyber warfare program as the regime’s foray into modern\nasymmetrical warfare, South Korea views the regime’s cyber capabilities as a terroristic threat, -a\nbuild-up for an impending multifaceted attack. It is important to note that, to date, no such attack\nhas occurred. According to a report written by Captain Duk-Ki Kim, Republic of Korea Navy officer\nand Ph.D. “…the North Korean regime will first conduct a simultaneous and multifarious cyber\noffensive on the Republic of Korea’s society and basic infrastructure, government agencies, and\nmajor military command centers while at the same time suppressing the ROK government and its\ndomestic allies and supporters with nuclear weapons.”[10] South Korea’s view of North Korea as a\nterroristic threat may be an attempt to downgrade North Korea politically, since South Korea does\nnot recognize the regime as a legitimate state.[11] South Korean reports also claim that North\nKorea’s premier hacking unit, Unit 121, trails Russia and the U.S. as the world’s third largest cyber\nunit. [12] While this claim may be exaggerated, in 2012, South Korean reports estimated North\nKorea’s hacker forces at around 3000 personnel. In a July 2014 report from South Korea’s Yonhap\nNews Agency, that figure was upgraded to 5900 hacker elite.[13] We must stress that although\nthese claims have not been corroborated, South Korea has taken the regime’s cyber threats very\nseriously and is reportedly training 5000 personnel to defend against North Korean cyber\nattacks.[14]\n\nObtaining details on North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities is not an easy task. This paper will\nexamine the known cyber capabilities of North Korea’s regime and how the country maintains\nsecrecy in these matters. Through information obtained via open source intelligence (OSINT), we\nwill present what is known about North Korea’s cyber warfare and supporting intelligence and\npsychological operations capabilities.\n\n### Research roadblocks \n\nThe following conditions proved to be research roadblocks when gathering intelligence regarding\nNorth Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities:\n\n  - Much of the intelligence available on North Korea is dated and may not accurately reflect\nthe regime’s current capabilities.\n\n  - Much of the intelligence available on North Korea comes from U.S. or South Korean\nmilitary or agency reports. These reports omit details that are likely classified, such as\nspecific IP addresses and individual actor information.\n\n  - While South Korea is an ally of the United States, its reports on North Korean cyber\nactivity potentially contain incomplete or biased information. Cultural factors that stem\n\n9 http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20140402/101985/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-ScaparrottiUSAC-20140402.pdf\n10 https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/8e487165-a3ef-4ebc-83ce-0ddd7898e16a/The-Republic-of-Korea-s-Counter-asymmetric-Strateg\n11 http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/GA04Dg01.html\n12 http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130321000980\n13 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/07/north_korea_employs_6000_leet_hackers_source_claims/\n14 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/07/north_korea_employs_6000_leet_hackers_source_claims/\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom a history of tension and conflict between the two nations may skew perception and\nmake objectivity difficult. [15] [16]\n\n  - North Korea’s Internet infrastructure and the regime’s strict control over its use ensures\nthat there are no rogue actors and that all officially sanctioned actors exercise careful\nOPSEC and PERSEC practices in order to prevent inadvertent information leaks. In other\nwords, there was no significant identifying information in the form of an OSINT trail left\nbehind by the actors. This hinders collection of original, actionable threat intelligence and\nindividual actor attribution.\n\n  - North Korea is well-isolated from the outside world, and its strong intelligence and\npsychological operations presence effectively creates confusion via counterintelligence\nand disinformation about the regime’s capabilities.[17] For this reason, any “official” reports\nemanating from North Korea must be taken with a grain of salt. This also hinders\nattempts to obtain original, actionable threat intelligence.\n\n### Ideological and political context\n\nIn order for Westerners to understand the North Korean mindset, it is necessary to examine the\nkey components of North Korean political and ideological thought. It is also necessary to provide a\nbrief explanation of how North Korea and South Korea view one another, in order to understand\nthe basis for conflict between the two.\n\n#### Juche and Songun\n\nNorth Korea has two primary ideologies that provide context for the regime’s motivations and\nactivities: juche (ju-cheh) and songun (sun-goon). Juche is the official political ideology of North\nKorea. It was instituted in 1972 and is based on the ideologies of Kim Il-Sung, the founder of the\nDPRK. Juche emphasizes self-reliance, mastering revolution and reconstruction in one’s own\ncountry, being independent of others, displaying one’s strengths, defending oneself, and taking\nresponsibility for solving one’s own problems. North Korea’s air-gapped intranet, described below,\nexemplifies this philosophy in the country’s cyber infrastructure. The juche philosophy explains\nNorth Korea’s disdain for outside cultural and political influence. Juche challenges North Koreans\nto contribute to the regime’s chaju (ja-ju), a concept of national sovereignty and independence.[18]\nThe regime’s greatest fear is internal dissent and resulting destabilization.[19] [20] In a June 2014\nReddit AMA session, Dr. Andrei Lankov, an expert on North Korean culture and society, noted\n“there are also serious signs of public alienation and discontent. And I cannot rule out a public\noutbreak of such discontent in the near future. Of course, if it happens, it will have a serious\nimpact on the government.”[21] Despite North Korea’s strong conviction in juche, the regime\ncollaborates with and receives support from other nations. However, due to this deep-seated\n\n15 http://www.businessinsider.com/did-kim-jong-un-execute-his-ex-girlfriend-2013-8\n16 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/10554198/North-Koreas-invisible-phone-killer-dogs-and-other-such-storieswhy-the-world-is-transfixed.html\n17 http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/01/world/north-korea-provocation/index.html?iid=article_sidebar\n18 http://www.stanford.edu/group/sjeaa/journal3/korea1.pdf\n19 http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/20269/keeping_kim.html\n20 http://www.buzzfeed.com/miriamberger/the-world-as-viewed-by-north-koreas-propaganda-machine\n21 http://www.reddit.com/r/NorthKoreaNews/comments/296ryd/i_am_dr_andrei_lankov_i_studied_in_north_korea/\n\n\n-----\n\nideology, it is doubtful that North Korea fully trusts these apparent allies.[22] Later in this document,\nwe will show that North Korea relies heavily on China for Internet access. North Korea also\ncollaborates with China and Russia to train its cyber warriors and has longstanding political and\nmilitary relationships with several nations.\n\n_Songun is_ North Korea’s “military first” doctrine. Songun emphasizes the priority of the military in\nresource allocation and political and economic affairs.[ 23] This doctrine stems from the belief that\nthe military is vital for preservation of chaju.[24] Understanding songun mindset gives context for\nthis potential threat actor’s motivations. According to a 2013 Congressional report, the strategy\nestablished under former leader Kim Jong-Il focused on “internal security, coercive diplomacy to\ncompel acceptance of its diplomatic, economic and security interests, development of strategic\nmilitary capabilities to deter external attack, and challenging South Korea and the\nU.S.-South Korean alliance.\"[25] _Songun is_ North Korea’s\n\n“military first” doctrine.\n\nNorth Korea’s songun permeates the lives of all North Korean citizens. Article 58 of _Songun emphasizes the_\n\npriority of the military in\n\nthe North Korean Constitution states that the nation should base itself on a\n\nresource allocation and\n\nnationwide defense system that includes all people.[26] North Korea, with a political and economic\npopulation of 25 million, has an active duty force of 1.19 million personnel, the affairs. Understanding this\nfourth largest in the world. The country’s reserve and paramilitary units comprise mindset gives context for a\n\npotential threat actor’s\n\n7.7 million additional personnel.[27] In other words, over a third of the country’s\n\nmotivations.\n\npopulation serves in a military or paramilitary capacity.\n\nSome North Korean youth aged 7-13 are inducted into the Korean Children’s Union. The Korean\nChildren’s Union is responsible for indoctrinating youths who pledge to build up their strength to\nlater defend the regime.[28]\n\n[22 http://www.defense.gov/pubs/ReporttoCongressonMilitaryandSecurityDevelopmentsInvolvingtheDPRK.pdf](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defense.gov%2Fpubs%2FReporttoCongressonMilitaryandSecurityDevelopmentsInvolvingtheDPRK.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfhmQPPTuRKlcewmT2M5Oj7Xmg93Q)\n\n23 http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub728.pdf\n24 http://www.iar-gwu.org/sites/default/files/articlepdfs/DeRochie_-_The_Driving_Factor.pdf\n25 http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=119924\n26 http://asiamatters.blogspot.co.uk/2009/10/north-korean-constitution-april-2009.html\n27 http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/international/2014/04/29/north-korea-military-numbers.cnn.html\n28 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2307937/North-Korea-Haunting-images-indoctrination-ceremony-communist-cult-leaders-threateningnuclear-war-poisoning-generation.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 A group of North Korean children being inducted into the Korean Children’s Union.[29]\n\nFigure 2 Members of the Korean Children’s Union with the regime’s leader Kim Jong Un.[30]\n\n29 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2307937/North-Korea-Haunting-images-indoctrination-ceremony-communist-cult-leaders-threateningnuclear-war-poisoning-generation.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490\n\n\n-----\n\nChildren aged 14-16 can begin military training as members of the Young Red Guards, a\nparamilitary unit. Beginning at age 17, North Koreans are eligible to join the Reserve Military\nTraining Unit.[31] The Reserve Military Training Unit forms the core of North Korea’s reserves and is\ntypically assigned to the front or regional defense in wartime.[32] The youngest age at which a\ncitizen can be conscripted for active duty is unclear; reported ages range from 18-20. Youths can\nvolunteer for active duty service at age 16 or 17.[33] The Worker-Peasant Militia, or Red Guards,\nincludes males ages 17-60 and unmarried females ages 17-30 who are not part of active duty\nunits or the Reserve Military Training Unit.[34]\n\nThe regime has an impressive number of conventional weapons, considering the nation’s small\nland area and population size.[35] According to statistics released by CNN in 2014, North Korea’s\nground arsenal includes 4100 tanks, 2100 armored vehicles, and 8500 pieces of field artillery.\nThe regime’s sea weaponry includes 70 submarines, 420 patrol combatants, and 260 amphibious\nlanding craft. Their airpower includes 730 combat aircraft, 300 helicopters, and 290 transport\naircraft. While the limits of the regime’s ballistic missile program are unknown, North Korea is\nthought to have fewer than 100 short-range missiles and fewer than 100 medium to long-range\nmissiles.[36] However, in recent years, North Korea has suffered oil,[37] fuel,[38] electricity,[39] and food[40]\nshortages. Without aid from another entity, the regime does not have sufficient resources to\nmaintain and sustain the majority of its weapons and associated personnel for rapid deployment\nor prolonged combat.\n\n#### Tension and change on the Korean Peninsula\n\nTension between North and South Korea has continued well past the armistice meant to end the\nKorean War. Neither nation recognizes the other as a legitimate state. South Korea’s constitution\nlegally defines South Korean territory as the entire Korean peninsula and its adjacent islands, with\n“North Korea” being a part of South Korea. [41] North Korea also claims to be the sole government\nof the Korean Peninsula.[42] Each country’s claim of sovereignty and refusal to acknowledge the\nother as a legitimate state creates the condition for perpetual conflict. North Korea’s negative\nsentiment towards the U.S. stems from two major factors: the U.S. – South Korea military alliance\nand North Korea’s perception that the U.S. is imperialistic and prone to exploitative capitalism.[43]\n\n30 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2307937/North-Korea-Haunting-images-indoctrination-ceremony-communist-cult-leaders-threateningnuclear-war-poisoning-generation.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490\n31 http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/army.htm\n32 http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/army.htm\n33 https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&ved=0CFkQFjAF&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.childsoldiers.org%2Fuser_uploads%2Fpdf%2Fkoreademocraticpeoplesrepublicof2639438.pdf&ei=fcyIU_uqCMas0QXUk4DoCw&usg=AFQjCNGOnkQt5ZStqxfc\ntKrUY-5IWYSH0A&sig2=ivQLF6lHkSO8Yx9O9VlO4g&bvm=bv.67720277,d.d2k&cad=rja\n34 http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/army.htm\n35 http://www.globalfirepower.com/\n36 http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/international/2014/04/29/north-korea-military-numbers.cnn.html\n37 http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/23/299897/facing-food-and-oil-shortages-north-korea-turns-to-iran/\n38 http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2014/07/02/2014070201995.html\n39 http://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/electricity-10212013160033.html\n40 http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/09/business/north-korea-economy-explainer/\n41 http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/GA04Dg01.html\n42 http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/north_korea/north-south/index.asp?article=north_korea\n43 http://cns.miis.edu/other/pinkston_strategic_insights_sep06.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nIn recent years, two primary factors have heavily influenced the current state of North Korea’s\nrelations with South Korea and her allies: the rise of the regime’s leader Kim Jong Un and the\ninauguration of South Korean president Park Guen Hye. Kim Jong Un officially rose to power in\nApril 2012, following the death of his father Kim Jong Il in December 2011. While his age\nremained a mystery for quite some time, it was later revealed that he was born in January 1983,\nmaking him age 31 at present. This makes Kim Jong Un the world’s youngest leader of an\nestablished nation.[44] The young leader’s rise to power brought about several changes in North\nKorea. First, Kim Jong Un’s personal life is more public and more extravagant than that of his\nfather. Unlike his father, the young Kim is often accompanied by his wife when making public\nappearances.[45] Second, the young Kim, who is more high-tech than his predecessor, is reported to\nhave an affinity for luxury items[46] and is an avid gamer and basketball fan.[47] Third, Kim Jong Un is\nmore totalitarian than his father. Following his rise to power, the regime reportedly expanded its\nlabor camps, and more military resources were allocated to target those attempting to defect.\nKim also executed his own uncle, a high-ranking official who did not share his ideals. These moves\nindicate the regime’s priority to deter internal destabilization and dissent, which is perceived to be\na greater threat than outside adversity. According to Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at\nHuman Rights Watch, “The government now recognizes that the accounts of escaping North\nKoreans reveal Pyongyang’s crimes – so it is doing what it can to stop people from fleeing.”[48]\nUnder Kim Jong Un’s rule, the regime has stepped up its nuclear materials production, and the\npropaganda distributed by state media has become more menacing.[49]\n\nThe regime’s response to perceived threats has also become more volatile. Christian Whiton, a\nformer deputy envoy to North Korea, noted that following Kim Jong Un’s rise to power, “the\nregime still acts in a very belligerent manner, but it seems less predictable, and more random.”\nEllen Kim, assistant director of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International\nStudies, assessed the situation thusly: “Since [Kim Jong Un] took power he has purged almost all\nof his elder guardians ... and filled his surroundings with new faces. We are in a situation where we\nare learning about him a little bit every day through his unpredictable behavior and actions, which\nis why the current situation with North Korea is a lot more dangerous than before.”[50] The regime’s\nrecent reaction to an upcoming film supports these statements. The plot for the comedy film “The\nInterview” follows two talk show hosts who are asked to assassinate Kim Jong Un. The regime\neven sent a complaint about the movie to the UN.[51] In response to the film, a North Korean official\nstated, “The enemies have gone beyond the tolerance limit in their despicable moves to dare hurt\nthe dignity of the supreme leadership.” The official referred to the movie as \"the most undisguised\nterrorism and a war action to deprive the service personnel and people of the DPRK of their\nmental mainstay and bring down its social system.” The official also issued a threat: “If the U.S.\nadministration connives at and patronizes the screening of the film, it will invite a strong and\nmerciless countermeasure.”[52] This reaction demonstrates North Korea’s priority of preserving the\n\n44 http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/12/kim-jong-uns-age-is-no-longer-a-mystery/265983/\n45 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/10522136/Kim-Jong-un-10-ways-North-Koreas-Dear-Leader-is-different.html\n46 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/18/north-korea-luxury-goods_n_4808823.html\n47 http://nypost.com/2011/12/20/kims-007-nut-kid-in-charge/\n48 http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/01/21/north-korea-kim-jong-un-deepens-abusive-rule\n49 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/10522136/Kim-Jong-un-10-ways-North-Koreas-Dear-Leader-is-different.html\n50 http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/01/world/north-korea-provocation/index.html?iid=article_sidebar\n51 http://www.northkoreatech.org/2014/07/10/dprk-takes-the-interview-movie-complaint-to-the-un/\n52 http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/25/world/asia/north-korea-the-interview-reaction/index.html?iid=article_sidebar\n\n\n-----\n\nregime’s self-perceived dignity in the global arena and its intolerance of any disrespect directed at\nthe Kim family.\n\nWhile tensions between North and South Korea have persisted since the Korean War, these\ntensions escalated following the 2013 inauguration of South Korea’s current president, Park Geun\nHye. Her platform, in her words, is as follows: “North Korea must keep its agreements made with\nSouth Korea and the international community to establish a minimum level of trust, and second\nthere must be assured consequences for actions that breach the peace. To ensure stability,\n_trustpolitik should be applied consistently from issue to issue based on verifiable actions, and_\nsteps should not be taken for mere political expediency.”[53] Shortly after Park’s inauguration,\nNorth Korea denounced UN Security Council Resolution 2094, which is “a resolution strengthening\nand expanding the scope of United Nations sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of\nKorea by targeting the illicit activities of diplomatic personnel, transfers of bulk cash, and the\ncountry’s banking relationships, in response to that country’s third nuclear test on 12 February\n\n[2013].”[54] North Korea also responded strongly to joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises in\nMarch 2013, as is noted later in this paper.[55]\n\n### North Korean cyber capabilities and limitations\n\n#### North Korean infrastructure\n\nNorth Korea’s cyber infrastructure is divided into two major parts: an outward-facing Internet\nconnection and a regime-controlled intranet. North Korea’s outward-facing Internet connection is\nonly available to select individuals and is closely monitored for any activity that is deemed antiregime. Individuals using the outward-facing Internet connection must be authorized. In 2013,\nJean H. Lee, the Associated Press bureau chief in Pyongyang, stated that foreigners visiting North\nKorea are allowed Internet access with no firewalls.[56] Common citizens are limited to using the\nKwangmyong (gwang me-young), a nationwide intranet with no access to the world outside North\nKorea. [57] According to Lee, Kwangmyong allows citizens “access to the state media, information\nsources that are vetted by the government, and picked and pulled from the Internet and posted to\ntheir intranet site.”[58] As of May 2013, North Korea had only one “Internet café.”[59] A 2003 report\nfrom the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive stated that North Korea’s “Internet\ncafé” was “the only place in North Korea for the public to access the Internet” and that foreigners\nwere allowed to access the Internet from this café.[60] Whether citizens are allowed to access the\nInternet from this location is unknown.\n\nStar Joint Venture Co. is responsible for providing North Korea’s Internet access. Star Joint Venture\nCo. was established by the Post and Telecommunications Corporation in cooperation with Loxley\n\n53 http://www.ncnk.org/resources/briefing-papers/all-briefing-papers/an-overview-of-south-korea2019s-dprk-policy\n54 http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/sc10934.doc.htm\n55 http://www.ncnk.org/resources/briefing-papers/all-briefing-papers/an-overview-of-south-korea2019s-dprk-policy\n56 http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/sxsw/2013-03-11/social-media-in-north-korea/\n57 http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9177968/North_Korea_moves_quietly_onto_the_Internet?taxonomyId=18&pageNumber=2\n58 http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/sxsw/2013-03-11/social-media-in-north-korea/\n59 http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/01/29/north-koreans-shouldnt-count-on-using-the-new-google-maps/\n60 http://www.ncix.gov/publications/archives/docs/NORTH_KOREA_AND_FOREIGN_IT.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nPacific in Thailand.[61] In December 2009, Star Joint Venture became responsible for North Korea’s\nInternet address allocation. Previously, Internet access was provided by a German satellite link via\nKorea Computer Center Europe or via direct connections with China Netcom, which was later\nmerged into China Unicom. [62] By October 2010, North Korea had made its first known direct\nconnection to the Internet, hosting an outward-facing Korean Central News Agency website\naccessible from the global Internet. [63] However, many of North Korea’s globally accessible\nwebsites are hosted in other countries. In 2001, South Korean reports indicated that North Korea\nhad joined the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT).[64] As of April\n2012, North Korea reportedly used the Intelsat connection, which appeared in border gateway\nprotocol (BGP) announcements.[65] Some reports referred to the Intelsat connection as North\nKorea’s backup Internet connection, in case the China Unicom connection fails.[66] A March 2013\npost on the blog rdns.im showed that North Korea no longer used the Intelsat connection. In the\nblog post, the author noted his method for proving that The Pirate Bay was not hosted in North\nKorea. While his analysis of The Pirate Bay’s hosting is irrelevant to our research, he did detail that\n175.45.177.0/24 always routes through AS4837, and AS131279. AS131279 is Star-KP, North\nKorea’s Star Joint Venture Company, and AS4837 is China Unicom. The author concluded that “all\n\n[traffic] is ONLY routed through China Unicom and NOT through Intelsat.”[67] In February 2014,\nNorth Korean and South Korean officials agreed to extend Internet access to Kaesong Industrial\nZone, a jointly operated industrial complex just north of the border. However, this would likely\nrequire a major electrical and network infrastructure expansion.[68]\n\nNorth Korea’s electrical grid cannot support a large technological infrastructure.[69] Electrical\npower is reported to be unreliable and sporadic, with many citizens only receiving a few hours of\nelectricity per day.[70]\n\n61 http://www.northkoreatech.org/2011/05/19/more-details-on-star-joint-venture/\n62 http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9177968/North_Korea_moves_quietly_onto_the_Internet?taxonomyId=18&pageNumber=2\n63 http://www.northkoreatech.org/2010/10/09/the-new-face-of-kcna/\n64 http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2001/05/29/2001052961197.html\n65 http://www.northkoreatech.org/2012/04/08/dprk-gets-second-link-to-internet/\n66 http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9237652/North_Korea_39_s_Internet_returns_after_36_hour_outage\n67 https://rdns.im/the-pirate-bay-north-korean-hosting-no-its-fake-p2\n68 http://www.northkoreatech.org/2014/02/10/internet-coming-to-kaesong-industrial-zone/\n69 http://38north.org/2010/09/speak-loudly-and-carry-a-small-stick-the-north-korean-cyber-menace/\n70 http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/rick-newman/2013/04/12/heres-how-lousy-life-is-in-north-korea\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 North and South Korean power grid\n\nThe photo above (Figure 3), from the International Space Station, shows North Korea’s sparse\npower grid, in comparison with surrounding nations.[71] We have highlighted North Korea in red.\n\nKoryolink, the country’s only cellular phone network,[72] is tightly controlled by the regime.[73] Cell\nphone data plans are not available to most users. Most cellular phones cannot access the\nInternet and can only make domestic calls.[74] According to a 2013 report, North Korea has a 3G\ndata network for cellular phones. Visiting reporter Jean H. Lee purportedly used this 3G network\nto post to both Twitter and Instagram. However, citizens are not generally allowed to use the 3G\nnetwork.[75]\n\nEmail is also regulated by the regime. The first email provider in North Korea was Silibank. Silibank\nhas servers in Pyongyong and Shenyang and is a joint venture with China. The North Korean\nSilibank homepage is silibank.net, and the Chinese homepage is silibank.com. In order to use the\nemail service, users had to initially register, provide personal information, and pay a registration\nfee and monthly service fees.[76] This registration information was current as of 2001. However, it\nis unknown whether the same process still applies.\n\nWHOIS records for silibank.net show that the site was registered anonymously via a Japanese\nregistrar. This information can be found in Appendix A at the end of this paper.\n\n71 http://www.citylab.com/work/2014/02/north-korea-night-looks-big-black-hole/8484/\n72 http://www.northkoreatech.org/2014/06/24/chinese-shops-offer-cheap-cellphones-to-north-koreans/\n[73 http://www.defense.gov/pubs/ReporttoCongressonMilitaryandSecurityDevelopmentsInvolvingtheDPRK.pdf](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defense.gov%2Fpubs%2FReporttoCongressonMilitaryandSecurityDevelopmentsInvolvingtheDPRK.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfhmQPPTuRKlcewmT2M5Oj7Xmg93Q)\n[74 http://www.defense.gov/pubs/North_Korea_Military_Power_Report_2013-2014.pdf](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defense.gov%2Fpubs%2FNorth_Korea_Military_Power_Report_2013-2014.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzefeAB_L1WH_8cmtox2f9Se3GMojQ)\n75 http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/sxsw/2013-03-11/social-media-in-north-korea/\n76 http://edition.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/11/07/north.korea.email.idg/index.html\n\n\n-----\n\nKorea Computer Center (KCC) is North Korea’s leading government research center for\ninformation technology. KCC has eleven regional information centers and eight development and\nproduction centers. Other countries with KCC branch offices include China, Syria, Germany, and\nUnited Arab Emirates. KCC has a vested interest in Linux research and is responsible for the\ndevelopment of North Korea’s national operating system, Red Star OS, which is discussed in more\ndetail below. KCC’s other projects have included a proprietary search engine, a document writer, a\ngame called Jang-Gi, the Kwangmyong intranet, a food study program, a Korean input method\neditor, a pen-based English-Korean and Korean-English translator, Korean voice recognition\nsoftware, a video conferencing system, a distance education system, SilverStar Paduk software,\nHMS Player[77], and the Samjiyon tablet.[ 78] In addition to research and development, KCC also\nmonitors websites of foreign government and business entities and conducts technical\nreconnaissance to blueprint the technical specifications and vulnerabilities in foreign systems and\ntechnologies. KCC has also been involved in clandestine information and cyber operations, serving\nas a command center.[79]\n\nNorth Korea’s proprietary operating system is Red Star OS. The development of this Linux-based\noperating system started in 2002. Red Star OS is only offered in the Korean language and\nfeatures proprietary software including Naenara (a Firefox-based browser), as well as a text\neditor, email client, audio and video players, and games.[80] Red Star OS’s keyboard layouts include\nKorean, English, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese. Regime ideals extend to Red Star OS. The\nreadme file, which goes with the installation disc, reportedly includes a quote from Kim Jong-Il\nregarding the importance of North Korea having its own Linux-based operating system that is\ncompatible with Korean traditions. While prior versions of Red Star were KDE-based, version 3.0\nmimics Apple’s OS X.[81] [82] This could indicate the regime leader Kim Jong Un’s preference for the\nOS X environment, as Kim reportedly uses an iMac.[83] Citizens do not need permission to obtain\nRed Star OS. However, the purchase of computers is heavily regulated.[84] The OS’s design suggests\nit was developed with means for the regime to monitor user activity.[85]\n\nNorth Korea is known to use two IP ranges. 175.45.176.0/22 is North Korea’s own IP block.[86]\nAdditionally, North Korea’s Telecommunications Ministry is the registered user of China Unicom IP\nrange 210.52.109.0/24.[87] The country’s only autonomous system (AS) number is AS131279, and\nits only peer is AS4837, the AS for China Unicom.[88]\n\nNorth Korea’s country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is .kp.

In\nlight of this, North Korea has managed to develop both hardware and software and hosts an\nannual National Exhibition of Invention and New Technologies to promote its products.[92] However,\nthe regime has historically failed in its attempts at large-scale production of electronic\ncomponents. The country’s sparse electrical grid is one of the major obstacles hindering largescale manufacturing.[93] Additionally, the famine in the early 1990’s negatively impacted existing\nmanufacturing facilities, and the regime simply does not have the capital to modernize those\nfactories.[94] A member of the World International Property Organization (WIPO), North Korea joined\nthe WIPO Patent Cooperation Treaty that protects patents and trademarks worldwide, and\nleverages intellectual property laws to ensure Westerners do not take credit for North Korean\ninventions.[95] The regime, in its efforts to isolate its citizens from Western influence, leverages\nintellectual property laws to ensure Westerners do not take credit for North Korean inventions.[96]\nThis is ironic since foreign-made electronic components are sometimes smuggled into North\nKorea for military use and for personal use by the regime’s upper echelon.\n\n#### An analysis of developments in North Korean cyberspace since 2010\n\nA comparison of a scan[97] of North Korea’s IP ranges in November 2010, just one month after\nNorth Korea made its first direct connection to the Internet, and a series of several scans we\nconducted in May 2014, shows that North Korea has made significant headway in establishing its\nInternet presence.\n\nIn the November 2010 scan, 175.45.176.0 - 175.45.176.16 showed a variety of devices including\nD-link, Cisco, Linksys, HP, and Nokia devices, and a Juniper networks firewall. Operating systems\ndetected included FreeBSD 6.x, Linux 2.6.x, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 175.45.176.14 returned\n“Naenara” as an html-title. Most hosts in the 175.45.176.xx and 175.45.177.xx ranges were\ndown. As of 2014, IP addresses 175.45.176.0 - 175.45.177.255 appear to be used for websites,\nnameservers, databases, email, and voice over IP (VoIP). In November 2010, the 175.45.178.xx\nrange showed all hosts down,[98] and the 175.45.179.xx range showed most hosts were down.[99]\n\n90 http://www.iana.org/reports/2011/kp-report-20110401.html\n91 http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/kp.html\n92 http://yu.edu/admissions/events/yunmun/WIPO/Libenstein_WIPO_Topic1_HAHS.pdf\n93 http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/BytesAndBullets/CH4.pdf\n94 http://sinonk.com/2013/10/11/a-primer-on-north-koreas-economy-an-interview-with-andrei-lankov/\n95 http://yu.edu/admissions/events/yunmun/WIPO/Libenstein_WIPO_Topic1_HAHS.pdf\n96 http://yu.edu/admissions/events/yunmun/WIPO/Libenstein_WIPO_Topic1_HAHS.pdf\n97 http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://dprk.sipsik.net/175.45.178.txt\n98 http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://dprk.sipsik.net/175.45.178.txt\n99 http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://dprk.sipsik.net/175.45.179.txt\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2014, several webservers and nameservers were found in the 175.45.178.xx range, and\nseveral nameservers and mail servers were found in the 175.45.179.xx range. This comparison\ndemonstrates that there has been some growth in DPRK Internet infrastructure over the past four\nyears. However, it seemingly lags behind even most third world nations. The 2014 scans detected\ndated technology that is potentially susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities and consistently\nshowed the same open ports and active devices on scanned hosts. It is not clear whether the\nregime failed to notice and react to the scanning or whether the regime allows these open ports\nand devices to be detected or spoofed to serve as a distraction or possible honeypot.\n\nDomains, nameservers, and mail servers present during the May 2014 scan are listed in Appendix\nB at the end of this report.\n\nAccording to Alexa rankings, the three most visited websites in North Korea are kcna.kp, the\nofficial website of the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)[100]; rodong.rep.kp, another North\nKorean news site[101]; and naenara.com.kp, North Korea’s official web portal.[102] Naenara translates\nto “my country”.\n\nThe kcna.kp site was registered using a Loxley.co.th email address and is administrated by Star\nJoint Venture Company.

The NDC\nis also the highest branch of government and the regime’s supreme policymaking body.[ 111] Along\nwith the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea and the Cabinet, NDC is at the top of\n\n110 http://www.ournation-school.com/\n111 https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/dprk-security-apparatus/national-defense-commission/\n\n\n-----\n\nNorth Korea’s political hierarchy.[112] Article 106 of North Korea’s Constitution gives the NDC the\nfollowing powers:[113]\n\n  - The power to establish policies of the state in accordance with the military-first\nrevolutionary line.\n\n  - The power to guide the armed forces and oversee defense building.\n\n  - The power to supervise and ensure the NDC and its chairman’s orders are executed and to\nestablish necessary measures.\n\n  - The power to override any state decisions or directives that are in opposition to the NDC\nor its chairman’s decisions and directives.\n\n  - The power to create or remove central organs of the national defense sector.\n\n  - The power to create and bestow military titles above general-grade officer rank.\n\nThe NDC oversees several defense and intelligence bodies including the Ministry of State Security,\nthe Ministry of People’s Security, the Ministry of People’s Armed Forces, and the Korean People’s\nArmy. The Ministry of State Security (MSS), also known as the State Security Department, is North\nKorea’s primary counterintelligence service. It is considered an autonomous agent of the regime\nand reports directly to leader Kim Jong Un. The MSS’s duties include oversight of North Korean\nprison camps, investigation of domestic espionage, repatriation of defectors, and overseas\ncounterespionage operations.[114] The Ministry of People’s Security is also known as the Ministry of\nPublic Security (MPS). Focused on domestic order, it oversees North Korea’s national police force,\nconducts criminal investigations and preliminary examinations, and oversees correctional\nfacilities, excluding prison camps.[115] While the roles of the MSS and MPS focus more on\nintelligence than on cyber operations, the MSS also reportedly has a communications monitoring\nand computer hacking group.[116]\n\nThe Ministry of People’s Armed Forces (MPAF) administrates the Korean People’s Army (KPA) and\noversees the General Staff Department (GSD), which is responsible for Unit 121 comprises both an\noperational command and control of North Korea’s armed forces.

This group, which was\nestablished in 1955, is referred to by various names including the Chosen Soren, Chongryon, and\nthe General Association of Korean Residents in Japan.[136] The Chongryon ascribe to juche and seek\nto preserve North Korean culture while living in Japan. They operate North Korean style schools\nand refuse to assimilate with Japanese culture.[137] According to Mitsuhiro Suganuma, former\nsection head of the second intelligence department of the Japanese Public Security Intelligence\nAgency (PSIA), “Chongryon is virtually under the direct control of the Liaison Department of the\nWorkers’ Party of Korea, which has been in charge of North Korea’s covert operations and\nunderground activities against South Korea. Chongryon in Japan has been a strong support\norganization aimed at bringing a revolution in South Korea, or a red unification by force.” He also\nstated “North Korea will continue to make Chongryon serve as Pyongyang’s pawn in covert\noperations against South Korea.”[138] The Chongryon are vital to North Korea’s military budget,\nraising funds via weapons trafficking, drug trafficking, and other black market activities.[139] The\ngroup also forms “front companies” abroad that benefit the regime by generating\n\n“Chongryon is virtually\n\nhard currency.

However, based on cultural and\ntechnical observations, we may deduce that North Korea’s cyber doctrine follows the tenets of\n_juche nationalism and the songun doctrine._\n\nAlthough North Korea’s limited online presence makes a thorough analysis of their cyber warfare\ncapabilities a difficult task, it must be noted that what is known of those capabilities closely\nmirrors their kinetic warfare tactics. Cyber warfare is simply the modern chapter in North Korea’s\nlong history of asymmetrical warfare. North Korea has used various unconventional tactics in the\n\n\n-----\n\npast, such as guerilla warfare, strategic use of terrain, and psychological operations.[146] The\nregime also aspires to create viable nuclear weapons.[147] Asymmetrical warfare is defined as “a\nconflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and in the struggle, interact\nand attempt to exploit each other's characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often involve\nstrategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the ‘weaker’ combatants attempting to use\nstrategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality”. [148]\n\nAccording to the aforementioned report to the House Armed Service Committee, “Cyber warfare is\nan important asymmetric dimension of conflict that North Korea will probably continue to\nemphasize — in part because of its deniability and low relative costs.”[149] North Korea’s poor\neconomic state[150], further explains the regime’s reliance on these tactics. In 2014, the regime\nreportedly spent 16% of its budget on defense.[151] The North Korean military places a strong\nemphasis on information warfare capabilities including political and psychological warfare[152] and\ncyber or hacker warfare.[153]\n\nThe report by Capt. Duk-Ki Kim, Ph.D. highlighted North Korea’s counter-asymmetric strategy and\nranked each based on intensity and frequency:\n\nFigure 14 Threat matrix of North Korean asymmetric war capabilities.[154]\n\n#### Cyber warfare operations\n\nJust ten years ago, experts noted that North Korea was one of the “least network-ready and most\nisolated societies on the planet.”[155] Today North Korea’s air-gapped networks and prioritization of\nresources for military use provide both a secure and structured base of operations for cyber\noperations and a secure means of communications.[156] North Korea’s hermit infrastructure creates\n\n146 http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-balance/balance.htm\n147 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11813699\n148 http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Asymmetric_warfare.html\n149 http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20140402/101985/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-ScaparrottiUSAC-20140402.pdf\n150 http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/7_things_north_korea_is_really_good_at\n151 http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/04/10/north-korea-details-budget-plans/\n152 https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/8e487165-a3ef-4ebc-83ce-0ddd7898e16a/The-Republic-of-Korea-s-Counter-asymmetric-Strateg\n153 http://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/1870/information-warfare/103284\n154 https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/8e487165-a3ef-4ebc-83ce-0ddd7898e16a/The-Republic-of-Korea-s-Counter-asymmetric-Strateg\n155 http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/BytesAndBullets/CH4.pdf\n156 http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20140402/101985/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-ScaparrottiUSAC-20140402.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\na cyber-terrain that deters reconnaissance. Because North Korea has few Internet connections to\nthe outside world, anyone seeking intelligence on North Korea’s networks has to expend more\nresources for cyber reconnaissance.[157] A 2003 article by the U.S. Office of the National\nCounterintelligence Executive assessed that “Development of the nation, rather than\nempowerment of the individual, appears to be driving DPRK efforts to develop domestic IT\ninfrastructure and industry.”[158] In November 2013, Kim Jong Un referred to cyber warfare\ncapabilities as a “magic weapon” in conjunction with nuclear weapons and missiles.[159]\n\nAccording to Kim Heung-kwang, a North Korean defector and former computer science professor,\nthe regime has the following motivations for expanding its cyber warfare capabilities:[160]\n\n  - Cyber capabilities are a cost-effective way to offset North Korea’s lack of kinetic military\nprowess.\n\n  - North Korea’s school systems place a strong emphasis on math, giving the nation\nconfidence in its programmers, cryptographers, and security researchers.\n\n  - In the modern warfare landscape, cyber capabilities are potentially more utilitarian than\nheavy artillery or aircraft.\n\n  - Cyber warfare capabilities provide a platform for espionage, psychological operations,\nand other forms of non-kinetic warfare.\n\n  - Considering the separatist nature of North Korea’s infrastructure, cyber warfare provides\na strategic advantage since outbound attacks are possible, but inbound attacks would\nhave limited reach.\n\n  - Cyber warfare allows North Korea to leverage the Internet’s inherent flaws for offensive\npurposes while maintaining its defenses, primarily via air-gapping its most critical\nnetworks from the outside world.\n\nNorth Korea’s attack and defense capabilities reportedly include the following cyber warfare and\nelectronic warfare components: offensive cyber operations (OCO); computer network operations\n(CNO), which includes both computer network attack (CNA) and computer network exploitation\n(CNE); distributed denial of service (DDoS);[161] satellite monitoring; drones; GPS jamming\ncapabilities[162]; and deployment of electromagnetic pulse (EMP).[163] North Korea’s OCO and CNO\ncapabilities became apparent as early as 2004, when North Korea reportedly gained access to 33\nof 80 South Korean military wireless communication networks. In June 2006, an attack on the U.S.\nState Department originating in the East Asia-Pacific region coincided with U.S.-North Korea\nnegotiations over the regime’s nuclear missile testing.[164] A month later, a South Korean military\nreport implicated North Korea’s Unit 121 in hacking the South Korean and U.S. Defense\nDepartments. North Korea also tested a logic bomb in October 2007.

Following the logic bomb\ntest, the UN passed a resolution banning sales of certain computer hardware to North Korea.[165]\n\nNorth Korea considers its cyber warfare capabilities an important asymmetric asset in the face of\nits perceived enemies, the U.S. and South Korea. While North Korea does not have an immersive\ndigital culture, both the U.S. and South Korea are heavily dependent upon technological\ninfrastructure for social, economic, and political stability.[166] For this reason, a cyber attack that\ncripples or compromises the reliability of the U.S. or South Korea’s technological infrastructure\ncould have a far-reaching impact.\n\n#### Gaming for profit and pwnage\n\nNorth Korea has reportedly used computer games for both illegal capital gain and\n\nNorth Korea has used\n\norchestrating cyber attacks. In 2011, South Korean police arrested five individuals,\n\ncomputer games for both\n\nincluding one Chinese national, for allegedly collaborating with North Korean hackers illegal capital gain and\naffiliated with the Korea Computer Center to steal money via online games.[167] orchestrating cyber attacks.\nAccording to South Korean reports, the culprits used an auto-player to quickly\nprogress in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) “Lineage” and were\nable to use the game’s market to obtain real currency.[168] In 2013, South Korean officials released\ninformation stating they had found evidence that North Korea was using games as a medium for\ninfecting machines and launching cyber attacks. North Korea had used game downloads to infect\n100,000 South Korean machines for a botnet used to launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS)\nattack against Incheon Airport.[169] This clever tactic sought to leverage a seemingly innocent game\nas a force multiplier in order to amplify the effects of a DDoS attack on a critical infrastructure\ntarget. However, in this case, there was little impact on the target.\n\n#### Intelligence and counterintelligence\n\n\nNorth Korea’s intelligence program is one of its strongest military assets, providing foundational\nsupport for all other military operations. The regime’s cyber warfare capabilities, in particular, rely\nheavily on open-source intelligence (OSINT) collection and cyber-espionage. [170] As noted in a CIA\npublication, \"It is a significant irony of our information age that open-source intelligence is\ncontributing to the survival and development of one of the world's most secretive regimes.\"[171]\nHistorically, the primary goals of the regime’s intelligence program included collection and\ndissemination of intelligence concerning any possible political, military, or economic threat to the\nregime’s security and stability. Secondary goals have included \"acquisition of foreign military and\ncivilian technologies and equipment, support of the DPRK’s foreign policy goals, training and\n\n165 http://www.scribd.com/doc/15078953/Cyber-Threat-Posed-by-North-Korea-and-China-to-South-Korea-and-US-Forces-Korea\n166 http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/BytesAndBullets/CH2.pdf\n167 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/04/south-north-korean-hackers-china\n168 http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/05/06/2011050600827.html\n169 http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/north-korea-ships-malware-infected-games-to-south-korean-users-uses-them-to-launch-ddosattacks/12383\n170 http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20140402/101985/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-ScaparrottiUSAC-20140402.pdf\n171 https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol48no1/article04.html\n\n\n-----\n\nsupport for foreign revolutionary and terrorist organizations, and the acquisition of foreign capital\nfor state and intelligence operations.\"[172]\n\nNorth Korea has a broad reach for intelligence collection, which extends to cyber intelligence.[173]\nIn April 2013, Solutionary, a company providing managed security services, reported a marked\nincrease in both overt attacks and information gathering attempts originating from\nNorth Korean IPs. Solutionary refers to any overt external attacks on company A faction of ethnic North\n\nKoreans residing in Japan,\n\nnetworks or attempts to steal data as \"touches.” They reportedly recorded 12,473 of\n\nknown as the Chongryon,\n\nthese touches in February 2013, 11,000 of which were directed at a single financial are critical to North Korea’s\ninstitution.

Ikeguchi is one of the Chongryon‘s\nmany ties to organized crime. Ikeguchi was arrested in the past for an attempted coup against the\nJapanese government. He also has ties to the political group Nihon Seinensya, which is involved in\nillegal activities in conjunction with the yakuza syndicate Sumiyoshi-kai, which imports and sells\namphetamines made in North Korea.[177] North Korea also has black market ties to Sumiyoshi-kai’s\nrival syndicate, Yamaguchi-gumi. Many members of the Kodo-kai, Yamaguchi-gumi’s ruling\nfaction, are Korean-Japanese, with ties to North Korea.[178] Masahiro Namikawa, leader of the drug\ntrafficking Seido-kai yakuza organization, also has ties to the Chongryon.[179]\n\nThe Chongryon operate at least two websites, chongryon.com, which is in Japanese, and koreanp.co.jp.\n\nWHOIS records for chongryon.com indicate that it was registered by “guanin o” using the email\naddress park2@mac.com. The WHOIS information for korea-np.co.jp. shows that it was\nregistered by Choson Shinbo Company Inc. The WHOIS records for these sites can be found in\nAppendix A.\n\nAdditionally, the Chongryon operate a ferry called the Mangyongbong-92, the only direct transit\nfrom Japan to North Korea. In 2003, they were suspected of using the ferry to smuggle missile\nparts.[180] In 2006, the ferry was temporarily banned from Japanese waters when Japanese officials\ndiscovered the Chongryon were using it to smuggle dual-use electronics to North Korea to be\nused for military purposes.[181]\n\nNorth Korea has a global network of state-run businesses located in 30 to 40\n\nNorth Korea has a global\n\ncountries that is used for espionage activities.

Sanctions to be lifted include the ban on port calls to Japan by North Korean ships.[186]\n\nNorth Korea has also infiltrated important positions in South Korea for both intelligence and\npsychological operations purposes.[187] In 2011, South Korea’s National Intelligence\nService reportedly discovered the presence of Communist spies. These spies within their trusted\ncircles had been reporting back to North Korea for almost 10 years. The embedded spies included\na Democratic Party representative. According to the agency, the spies were on a mission to\ninfiltrate and influence the Democratic Party and to gather military intelligence.[188] The regime also\nattempts to infiltrate organizations made up of North Koreans who seek shelter in South Korea, in\norder to gain intelligence. In the past several years, South Korea has arrested at least 14 defectors\nwho were found to be spies.[189]\n\nThese intelligence collection and counterintelligence capabilities are an attempt to provide the\nregime with a strategic asymmetrical advantage. The regime leverages its human and cyber\nresources around the globe to provide an influx of intelligence, while very little credible\nintelligence about the regime’s activities and capabilities ever becomes available to the outside\nworld.\n\n#### Psychological operations\n\nNorth Korea continues to be a master of propaganda and deception and leverages the cyber\nrealm for psychological operations. Modern North Korean psychological operations tactics include\ndistribution of propaganda via traditional media outlets, websites, and social media. Many of\nthese psychological operations campaigns are politically focused.[190] According to Dr. Andrei\nLankov, the North Korean government has “very rational and highly successful manipulators who\nusually get what they want by outsmarting everybody else in the process.”[191]\n\nThe regime’s Unit 204 is responsible for cyber-psychological operations.

The YouTube\nchannel North Korea Today, operated by user rodrigorojo1, features news clips from North Korea.\nIt is unclear whether this channel is officially sanctioned.[195] The North Korea Today YouTube\nchannel also has corresponding profiles on Twitter[196] and Facebook.[197]\n\n192 http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/new-psyop.pdf\n193 http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/sxsw/2013-03-11/social-media-in-north-korea/\n194 http://instagram.com/p/WpcJs1OCkb/\n195 https://www.youtube.com/user/rodrigorojo1\n196 https://twitter.com/NorthKoreaT0day\n197 https://www.facebook.com/pages/Korean-Central-Television/380193555435568?fref=ts\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17 A screenshot of the North Korea Today YouTube Channel.[198]\n\nThe Uriminzokkiri website, known for pushing juche ideology and anti-American and anti-South\nKorean messages, has accompanying social media profiles on YouTube,[199] Google+,[200] and\nFacebook.[201] It also has Twitter profiles in both Korean[202] and English.[203]\n\n198 https://www.youtube.com/user/rodrigorojo1\n199 https://www.youtube.com/user/uriminzokkiri\n200 https://plus.google.com/u/0/112306344682887627095\n201 https://www.facebook.com/pages/Uriminzokkiri/124452740935216\n202 https://twitter.com/uriminzok\n203 https://twitter.com/uriminzok_engl\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18 A screenshot of the Uriminzokkiri YouTube channel.[204]\n\nFigure 19 A screenshot from the Uriminzokkiri Facebook page shows anti-U.S. and pro-juche\nrhetoric.[205]\n\n204 https://www.youtube.com/user/uriminzokkiri/featured\n205 https://www.facebook.com/pages/Uriminzokkiri/124452740935216\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20 A screenshot of the Uriminzokkiri Korean language Twitter profile.[206]\n\nFigure 21 A screenshot of the Uriminzokkiri English language Twitter profile.[207]\n\nNorth Korean propaganda[208] is used for several purposes: to enforce the ideals of allies\nand sympathizers, to frame North Korea in a favorable light to outsiders, to\nsensationalize the regime’s perceived self-reliance and military prowess, and to shield its\nown citizens from the outside world.[209] _Juche ideology and indoctrination of the regime’s_\nyouth ensure support of the local population. North Koreans accept military duty as an\nhonor and strive to excel in their service to the regime. In the spirit of juche, the regime\nuses disinformation to “hide lapses or tout accomplishments that may have never been\n\n206 https://www.facebook.com/pages/Uriminzokkiri/124452740935216\n207 https://twitter.com/uriminzok_engl\n208 http://www.ncix.gov/publications/archives/docs/NORTH_KOREA_AND_FOREIGN_IT.pdf\n209 http://fas.org/irp/eprint/cno-dprk.pdf\n\n\nIn the spirit of juche,\nthe regime uses\ndisinformation to “hide\nlapses or tout\naccomplishments that\nmay have never been\nachieved.”\n\n\n-----\n\nachieved.”[210] Limiting citizen access to the outside world by instituting the Kwangmyong intranet,\nNorth Korea ensures its citizens are not exposed to outside information that is counterproductive\nto citizen indoctrination or in conflict with juche ideals. North Korea portrays the West, particularly\nthe United States, as an enemy. The regime uses this strategy of shifting the population’s\nnegative sentiments toward an external entity to keep its citizens ignorant of North Korea’s own\neconomic hardship, regime brutality, and systemic incompetence.[211] For example, prior to Kim\nJong Il’s death in 2011, North Korean media altered photos of their “Dear Leader” to make him\nappear younger and healthier than he really was. This became obvious when the altered photos\nwere compared to those taken by Western media around the same time.[212]\n\nAccording to Dr. Andrei Lankov, “North Koreans now have a much better understanding of what is\ngoing on in the outside than they did before. This is largely thanks to the spread of DVDs and\nvideo content in the country, but also because some of them have been to China and talk about\nwhat they have seen…many [of] them sincerely believe that the United States remains ready to\nattack at any moment and that Japan is an incurably aggressive place…nearly all of them swallow\nthe official propaganda myths about the Korean War being started by the 'American Imperialists'\nwho invaded them. Hence, they see the outside world as an inherently dangerous place.”[213] Some\nhuman rights groups seek to reach out to North Korean citizens and break them from this\nisolation. In August 2014, the New York-based charity Human Rights Foundation sponsored a\nhackathon in San Francisco called “Hack North Korea” to find new ways to get information in, out,\nand around North Korea. The event brought together many programmers, human rights\ncampaigners, and defectors.[214]\n\nNorth Korea even uses “trolling” as a PSYOP tactic. On the Internet, “trolls” are users who post\nmessages that are often crass, controversial, inflammatory, or offensive, in order to evoke a\nstrong reaction or influence a reader’s opinion. Often, the motivation for trolling is simply for the\ntroll’s enjoyment. The rude and offensive trolling tactics are in stark contrast to traditional forms\nof persuasive rhetoric. However, North Korea reportedly utilizes over 200 military intelligence\noperatives to troll South Korean message boards and social media pages with pro-North Korean\nsentiments.[215] Matt Rhoades, director of the cyberspace and security program at the Truman\nNational Security Project, said, \"North Korea's cyber-development is almost just a new\nharassment mechanism for them, a low-cost, asymmetric method to harass its neighbor in the\nsouth…\"[216]\n\nLeveraging the cyber and intelligence resources noted above, North Korea’s psychological\noperations serve an important strategic role. The ability to influence outsiders, while effectively\nisolating its own population from most outside influence, allows North Korea to remain an\nenigma. Additionally, in line with its PSYOP tactics, North Korea may strategically take credit for\ncyber attacks that were, in reality, launched by another entity. Whether the targeted entity blames\n\n210 http://www.ists.dartmouth.edu/docs/cyberwarfare.pdf\n211 http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20140402/101985/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-ScaparrottiUSAC-20140402.pdf\n212 https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htmurph/articles/20131106.aspx\n213 http://www.reddit.com/r/NorthKoreaNews/comments/296ryd/i_am_dr_andrei_lankov_i_studied_in_north_korea/\n214 http://www.northkoreatech.org/2014/08/05/hack-north-korea-focuses-silicon-valley-on-information-flow/\n215 http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htiw/articles/20131213.aspx\n216 http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/2013/1019/In-cyberarms-race-North-Korea-emerging-as-a-power-not-a-pushover/(page)/4\n\n\n-----\n\nNorth Korea for the attacks, or the regime simply takes credit for an attack that has not yet been\nattributed, several PSYOP goals can come into play. First, to claim credit for an attack amplifies\nthe impact of a show of force, particularly if South Korea is the target. This tactic can be used to\nstir sentiments in order to provoke a reaction. Second, North Korea may lay claim to responsibility\nfor an attack that exceeds its capabilities in order to seem more technologically advanced and\nmore capable. Third, any success, or the appearance thereof, enforces the juche ideal of regime\nself-sufficiency. Finally, North Korea may act as a scapegoat and claim credit for a cyber attack of\nan ally such as China so the attack is not attributed to the real actors.[217]\n\n#### Electronic warfare\n\nNorth Korea reportedly has the electronic warfare capabilities to jam GPS and to inject false GPS\ncoordinates.[218] North Korea demonstrated these capabilities in March 2011 by jamming South\nKorea’s GPS signals during a joint U.S.-South Korea military exercise.[219] North Korea has the\ncapability to create an EMP.[220] An EMP is a sudden, extreme outburst of atmospheric electricity\ncreating an intense magnetic field that can burn out electrical equipment. [221] A report from the\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) noted North Korea’s ability to deliver a nuclear\nwarhead as a satellite over the South Pole, effectively creating the burst needed to deliver an EMP\ntargeting the United States. An EMP could effectively disrupt electronic communications including\ncritical infrastructure components such as telecommunications, financial institutions, the energy\nsector, transportation, food and water delivery, emergency services, and space systems.[222] North\nKorea reportedly acquired its EMP technology from Russia.[223]\n\nNorth Korea also has a drone program. The regime reportedly acquired its first drones in the late\n1980’s or early 1990’s. The regime’s drones are complimentary to its intelligence program and\nare primarily used for surveillance.[224] In early 2014 a North Korean drone crashed south of the\n38[th] parallel, the line dividing North Korea from the south.[225] While early reports noted that the\ndrones appeared similar to those manufactured by Chinese company Tauyuan Navigation Friend\nAviation Technology, the company denied involvement.[226]\n\n217 http://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-05-301.pdf\n218 https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/8e487165-a3ef-4ebc-83ce-0ddd7898e16a/The-Republic-of-Korea-s-Counter-asymmetric-Strateg\n219 http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/03/us-korea-north-cyber-idUSTRE7421Q520110503\n220 http://defensetech.org/2007/12/24/inside-dprks-unit-121/\n221 http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/2010-10-26-emp_N.htm\n222 http://www.wnd.com/2014/04/dhs-study-north-korea-capable-of-emp-attack-on-u-s/\n223 http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/170563-north-korea-emp\n224 http://38north.org/2014/07/jbermudez070114/?utm_source=feedly&utm_reader=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jbermudez070114\n225 http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/eastern-arsenal/north-koreas-new-drones-are-chinese-which-opens-new-mystery\n226 http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1494207/north-korean-drones-not-theirs-says-chinese-retailer\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22 A drone attributed to North Korea. [227]\n\nStressing the importance of the regime’s electronic warfare capabilities, in 1999 former regime\nleader Kim Jong Il said “The basic key to victory in modern warfare is to do well in electronic\nwarfare.”[228] Since the regime’s advanced technology lags behind that of South Korea and the U.S.,\nits capability to disrupt the communications of these perceived adversaries is a vital asymmetric\ncapability.[229]\n\n#### Training cyber warriors\n\nNorth Korea utilizes primary and secondary education and the university system to train its cyber\nwarfare operators. According to reports by defectors, the regime seeks out children who show\nmathematical talent and sends them through rigorous advanced training.[230] A vintage North\nKorean animation stresses the importance of mathematics in North Korean education. The short\nfilm follows a young boy as he does his geometry homework. The frustrated boy begins to\ndaydream then has visions of going to war with the U.S. and needing geometry to effectively\ncalculate missile trajectory during the battle.[231]\n\n227 http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/04/02/seoul-points-to-north-korea-in-crashed-drones-investigation/\n228 http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/BytesAndBullets/CH13.pdf\n229 http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/BytesAndBullets/CH5.pdf\n230 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/06/201162081543573839.html\n231 http://theweek.com/article/index/255243/how-to-kill-americans-with-geometry-a-north-korean-propaganda-film-for-kids\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23 A screenshot from the North Korean animation depicting geometry as a necessary skill\nfor battle.[232]\n\nScience and technology students are expected to learn foreign languages, which may include\nChinese, Japanese, and English.[233] Student emails, chats, and web browsing activities are heavily\nmonitored.[234] Around age twelve or thirteen, chosen students are enrolled in accelerated\ncomputer courses at First and Second Geumseong Senior-Middle Schools.\n\n232 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujtp-70zQME\n233 https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol48no1/article04.html\n234 http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/02/23/north_korea_where_the_internet_has_just_5500_sites.html#\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24 North Korean students training for cyber war.[235]\n\nThe successful students are then sent to Kim Il-sung University, Kim Chaek University of\nTechnology,[236] or the Command Automation University, traditionally known as Mirim University.\n\nKim Il-sung University’s computer center was started in 1985. Its computer courses have a heavy\nprogramming element. The university reportedly developed the Intelligent Locker hard disc\nprotection program, Worluf Antivirus, SIMNA (simulation and system analysis program), a war\ngames program, a hepatitis diagnosis and prescription system, and a C++ program development\ntool called FC 2.0.[237] Kim Il-sung University also has programs focusing on nuclear research.[238]\n\nKim Chaek University of Technology was established in 1948. In the late 1990s, it began to\nrestructure its computer-focused courses to reflect more modern technologies. As of 2002, the\nuniversity had three colleges focusing on computer science, information science and technology,\nand machine science. Software developed by the university includes Computer Fax and SGVision,\nan image-reprocessing program used for steganography.[239] Students and instructors must\nsubmit a formal request for permission in order to use the Internet for research.[240]\n\n235 http://www.courierpress.com/news/2013/apr/19/young-north-koreans-train-seek-revenge-us/\n236 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/06/201162081543573839.html\n237 http://www.ists.dartmouth.edu/docs/cyberwarfare.pdf\n238 http://www.nti.org/facilities/789/\n239 http://www.ists.dartmouth.edu/docs/cyberwarfare.pdf\n240 http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/08/north-korean-google-chief-search\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Command Automation University periodically chooses around 100 students for an intensive\nfive-year course prior to their assignment to serve in cyber intelligence and cyber warfare\ncapacities.[241] Programs at the Command Automation University include command automation,\ncomputers, programming, automated reconnaissance, and electronic warfare.[242] Other students\nattend a two-year accelerated university program, then study abroad in Russia or China before\nthey are assigned to a cyber-operator role.[243]\n\nThe elite cyber operators are given special incentives. For example, parents of students\ngraduating from the cyber program with top scores are given the opportunity to live in\nPyongyang; and married cyber operators are given housing, a food allowance, and a stipend if\noperating overseas. Due to the nature of their profession, these cyber elite are some of the only\nNorth Koreans allowed to access the outside Internet.[244]\n\n### Important political and military ties\n\nWhile this report focuses on North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities, these capabilities cannot be\nfully separated from the implications of partnerships with countries known to deal in illegal\nweapons trade with the regime. Now that cyberspace has become a legitimate arena for warfare,\nthese nations are also potential allies in the cyber realm. For this reason, the regime’s key political\nand military relationships are explored below.\n\n#### China\n\nNorth Korea has a longstanding historical relationship with China. During the Korean War (19501953), China allied with North Korea’s Communist forces. China has also provided ongoing\npolitical and economic support to the regime’s leadership and is a primary trade partner. North\nKorea is economically dependent on China. North Korea gets an estimated 90 percent of its\nenergy imports, 80 percent of its consumer goods, and 45 percent of its food supply from China.\nThis relationship is prudent – in the event of a military conflict, China can strategically use North\nKorea as a buffer zone between itself and South Korea, where many U.S. military personnel are\nstationed. Chinese aid to North Korea also deters the likelihood that the regime will collapse,\nresulting in internal destabilization that could catalyze a U.S.-China conflict.[245]\n\nNorth Korea relies heavily on China for technological resources. As noted above, North Korea\nrelies on China’s Unicom for Internet access.[246] Additionally, the regime sends some of its cyber\nwarriors to train in China[247] and stations a portion of its Unit 121 personnel in Shenyang.[248] Some\nof North Korea’s official websites are hosted in China, [249] and KCC has a branch office there.[250]\n\n241 https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/8e487165-a3ef-4ebc-83ce-0ddd7898e16a/The-Republic-of-Korea-s-Counter-asymmetric-Strateg\n242 http://www.ists.dartmouth.edu/docs/cyberwarfare.pdf\n243 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/06/201162081543573839.html\n244 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/06/201162081543573839.html\n245 http://www.cfr.org/china/china-north-korea-relationship/p11097#p1\n246 https://rdns.im/the-pirate-bay-north-korean-hosting-no-its-fake-p2\n247 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/06/201162081543573839.html\n248 http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/2013/1019/In-cyberarms-race-North-Korea-emerging-as-a-power-not-a-pushover/(page)/4\n249 http://binarycore.org/2012/05/30/investigating-north-koreas-netblock-part-3-topology/\n250 http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/kcc/\n\n\n-----\n\nNorth Korea also relies on China to provide much of its network hardware, including servers and\nrouters.[251]\n\n#### Russia\n\nNorth Korea has a long history of ties to Russia. The former Soviet Union was the major sponsor\nof the North Korean state and a major trading partner. Following the dissolution of the Soviet\nUnion, aid to North Korea was halted and trade diminished significantly. This chain of events\ncontributed to North Korea’s eventual economic collapse, as it could not survive without aid.[252]\n\nNorth Korea currently has a collaborative relationship with Russia in the cyber realm. The regime’s\nCSTIA relies on Russia as one of several sources for technical data.[253] North Korea also sends\nsome of its cyber warriors to train in Russia,[254] and the regime reportedly acquired its EMP\ntechnology from there.[255]\n\nPolitical ties between Russia and North Korea have become stronger in recent months. In 2014,\npotentially as a result of the U.S. response to the Russian-Ukranian conflict, Russia began to\nstrengthen ties with North Korea. Negotiations reportedly included promises of trade and\ndevelopment projects. Narushige Michishita, a North Korea and Asia security expert at Japan's\nNational Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, stated “By strengthening its relationship with North\nKorea, Russia is trying to enhance its bargaining position vis-à-vis the United States and Japan.”[256]\nRussia also recently forgave most of the regime’s debts.[257]\n\n#### Iran\n\nNorth Korea and Iran have longstanding political and military ties. North Korea supplied Iran with\nconventional arms during the Iran-Iraq War. Iran and North Korea reportedly collaborate closely in\nballistic missile development efforts. In the past, Iran provided the North Korean regime with\nnecessary funds and oil in exchange for missile parts and technology. [258] [259] In 2009, a North\nKorean plane transporting 35 tons of weapons and allegedly bound for Iran was seized after\nmaking an unscheduled stop in Bangkok, Thailand. That same year, United Arab Emirates seized a\nship bound for Iran that was transporting several containers of North Korean weapons, including\nrocket-propelled grenades and ammunition. Reportedly, the customer was a company affiliated\nwith Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. [260] [261]\n\nNorth Korea also has cyberwar ties with Iran. In 2012, North Korea and Iran signed a technology\ntreaty to help combat “common enemies” in cyberspace. The treaty included provisions for\ncooperation in research, student exchanges, and joint laboratories. Joint projects reportedly\n\n251 http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/2013/1019/In-cyberarms-race-North-Korea-emerging-as-a-power-not-a-pushover/(page)/4\n252 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/06/n-korea-russia-step-toward-worl-201462253320470677.html\n253 https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol48no1/pdf/v48i1a04p.pdf\n254 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/06/201162081543573839.html\n255 http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/170563-north-korea-emp\n256 http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/04/russia-bolster-ties-north-korea\n257 http://www.voanews.com/content/russia-forgives-north-korean-debt/1939188.html\n258 http://thediplomat.com/2013/10/the-iran-secret-explaining-north-koreas-rocket-success/2/\n259 http://humanities.tau.ac.il/iranian/en/previous-reviews/10-iran-pulse-en/117-10\n260 http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron\n261 http://www.irantracker.org/foreign-relations/north-korea-iran-foreign-relations\n\n\n-----\n\ninclude IT information sharing, engineering, biotechnology, renewable energy, and sustainability.\nF-Secure’s Mikko Hypponen stated, \"It's highly likely that one of the reasons for this co-operation\nis for them to work together regarding their cyber defence and cyber offense strategies\".\nHypponen cited Flame malware as a possible triggering event for the creation of this treaty.\nOthers also suspect that Iran and North Korea’s mutual interest in development of nuclear\nweapons and the need to protect refineries against malware such as Stuxnet were driving factors\nin the establishment of the treaty.[262] U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee leaders assert that the\ntreaty indicates North Korea and Iran are collaborating on a joint nuclear weapons program.[263]\n\nAdditionally, North Korea, in conjunction with Iran and Syria, reportedly supports both Hamas and\nHezbollah in procuring kinetic weaponry and communications equipment and in establishing\noperational infrastructure.[264] [265] [266]\n\n#### Syria\n\nNorth Korea has both a cyber relationship and kinetic weapons ties with Syria. KCC reportedly has\na branch in Syria.[267]\n\nIn 2007, Israel launched an airstrike, destroying a Syrian target that was allegedly a nuclear facility\nunder construction with North Korea’s assistance. U.S. officials noted the facility was modeled on\nthe North Korean nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.[268]\n\nThe North Korea-Syria relationship becomes more important in the context of both countries’ ties\nwith Iran. As noted above, Iran, North Korea, and Syria jointly provide support to extremist groups\nHamas and Hezbollah.[269] [270] [[271] Additionally, as we explored in HPSR Security Briefing Episode 11,](http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Security-Research-Blog/HPSR-Threat-Intelligence-Briefing-Episode-11/ba-p/6385243)\nIran and Syria’s military alliances extend to joint SIGINT and cyber operations.[272]\n\n#### Cuba\n\nNorth Korea also has an interesting relationship with Cuba – one that includes supplying weapons\nand apparent attempts to illegally smuggle weapons. In 2013, a North Korean cargo ship on its\nreturn voyage was stopped near the Panama Canal. The ship was carrying surface-to-air missile\nparts, disguised as containers of sugar. In an attempt to save face, Cuba’s Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs stated that the cargo included \"240 metric tons of obsolete defensive weapons -- two antiaircraft missile complexes Volga and Pechora, nine missiles in parts and spares, two Mig-21 Bis\nand 15 motors for this type of airplane, all of it manufactured in the mid-20th century -- to be\n\n262 http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2202493/iran-and-north-korea-sign-technology-treaty-to-combat-hostile-malware\n263 http://www.voanews.com/content/ties-among-north-korea-syria-iran-a-major-security-threat/1639769.html\n264http://38north.org/2014/08/aberger080514/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+38North+%2838+North%3A+\nInformed+Analysis+of+North+Korea%29\n265 http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/hamas_global_support_network_must_be_targeted\n266 http://www.ibtimes.com/north-korea-send-hamas-weapons-communication-equipment-secret-arms-deal-1640088\n267 http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/kcc/\n268 http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron\n269http://38north.org/2014/08/aberger080514/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+38North+%2838+North%3A+\nInformed+Analysis+of+North+Korea%29\n270 http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/hamas_global_support_network_must_be_targeted\n271 http://www.ibtimes.com/north-korea-send-hamas-weapons-communication-equipment-secret-arms-deal-1640088\n272 http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Security-Research-Blog/HPSR-Threat-Intelligence-Briefing-Episode-11/ba-p/6385243#.U_TiZGSwL-0\n\n\n-----\n\nrepaired and returned to Cuba.\" Experts said the cargo appeared to include a SNR-75 Fan Song\nfire-control radar system for an SA-2 missile, a Soviet-era missile system that was also used in\nCuba.[273] Following the incident, Fidel Castro credited former North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung for\nproviding Cuba with weapons near the end of the Cold War. Weapons included 100,000 AK rifles\nand necessary ammunition.[274]\n\nWhile no apparent cyber relationship exists between North Korea and Cuba at this time, their track\nrecord for weapons trade means the potential for future collaboration in the cyber realm cannot\nbe discounted.\n\n### Timeline of significant North Korean cyber activity\n\n**2004**\n\n  - North Korea gains access to 33 South Korean military wireless communication\nnetworks[275]\n**2006**\n\n  - The U.S. State Department is attacked by entities in the East Asia-Pacific region.

Strategic capabilities refer\nto the assets used in support of a long-term, overarching goal. Tactical capabilities refer to the\nmethods and maneuvers actually implemented in pursuit of the strategic goal.[304] Operational\ncapabilities refer to the potential use of these capabilities.[305]\n\nIn 2004, in response to the annual U.S. – South Korea joint military exercises, North Korea\nreportedly gained access to 33 South Korean military wireless communication networks.[306] The\nnext significant cyber attack attributed to North Korea was in June 2006. The U.S. State\nDepartment was attacked by entities in the East Asia-Pacific region. The attacks coincided with\nState Department negotiations with North Korea regarding the regime’s nuclear missile tests.[307]\nIn July 2006, North Korea’s Unit 121 reportedly breached South Korean and U.S. military\nentities.[308] This attack was concurrent with the regime’s test-fire of at least one long-range\nmissile and several medium-range missiles.[309]\n\n2007 was politically tumultuous for North Korea. Following multi-national talks, the UN’s\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ordered the shutdown of the regime’s nuclear facilities\nin Yongbyon in July.[310] Its nuclear efforts temporarily thwarted, North Korea tested a logic bomb\nin October 2007.[311]\n\nIn April 2009, North Korea ejected IAEA and U.S. nuclear compliance officials. The regime indicated\nrefusal to comply with any UN agreements regarding nuclear weaponry and announced it would\nreinstate its nuclear materials production. The next month, North Korea conducted an\nunderground nuclear test and voiced its confidence that the regime was well on its way to\nproducing viable nuclear technology. The UN called an emergency meeting condemning the\nnuclear weapons test, and South Korea joined the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). North\nKorea issued a statement via KCNA calling South Korea’s involvement in PSI an act of war.[312] In\nJune 2009, North Korea stated that it was “fully ready for any form of high-tech war.”[313] The\nfollowing month, DDoS and disk wiping malware, later known as DarkSeoul, targeted South\nKorean and U.S. government entities, media outlets, and financial websites. The attacks coincided\n\n304 http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/strategy-and-tactics-military\n305 http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/Pages/preface.aspx\n[306 http://www.scribd.com/doc/15078953/Cyber-Threat-Posed-by-North-Korea-and-China-to-South-Korea-and-US-Forces-Korea](http://www.scribd.com/doc/15078953/Cyber-Threat-Posed-by-North-Korea-and-China-to-South-Korea-and-US-Forces-Korea)\n[307 http://www.informationweek.com/state-department-releases-details-of-computer-system-attacks/d/d-id/1045112?](http://www.informationweek.com/state-department-releases-details-of-computer-system-attacks/d/d-id/1045112)\n[308 http://www.scribd.com/doc/15078953/Cyber-Threat-Posed-by-North-Korea-and-China-to-South-Korea-and-US-Forces-Korea](http://www.scribd.com/doc/15078953/Cyber-Threat-Posed-by-North-Korea-and-China-to-South-Korea-and-US-Forces-Korea)\n309\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCMQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworldasia-pacific15278612&ei=fabyU6XQLsLFigLH94GIAw&usg=AFQjCNGbrzkNZJ5tz4jmLyMPsCHEHc41WA&sig2=l8FMAdbvzFxYeBBOAMWO6Q&bvm=bv.73231344,d\n.cGE&cad=rja\n310 http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron\n[311 http://www.scribd.com/doc/15078953/Cyber-Threat-Posed-by-North-Korea-and-China-to-South-Korea-and-US-Forces-Korea](http://www.scribd.com/doc/15078953/Cyber-Threat-Posed-by-North-Korea-and-China-to-South-Korea-and-US-Forces-Korea)\n312 http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron\n[313 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/11/north-korea-army-lab-110-_n_229986.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/11/north-korea-army-lab-110-_n_229986.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nwith U.S. Independence Day.[314] [315] Other malware used for Operation Troy was also planted.\nOperation Troy would continue for several years, largely undetected.[316]\n\nIn early 2011, political and military tensions were high. In February, James Clapper, United States\nDirector of National Intelligence, testified that North Korea likely had undeclared uranium\nenrichment facilities as part of its nuclear weapons program.[317] In March 2011, South Korean\nmedia, financial, and critical infrastructure targets suffered a DDoS and disk-wiping malware\nattack later known as the “10 Days of Rain”. U.S. and South Korean military entities were also\ntargeted by DDoS during this attack. The attack used the DarkSeoul malware.[318] North Korea also\ndisrupted South Korean GPS signals. Additionally, North Korean actors reportedly attempted a\nDDoS attack against South Korea’s Incheon Airport that same month.[319] These incidents coincided\nwith the annual U.S. – South Korea joint military exercises.[320] The following month, North Korean\nactors reportedly launched a DDoS attack against South Korea’s Nonghyup bank.[321]\n\nIn 2012, an attack on South Korean Newspaper JoongAng Ilbo was attributed to North Korean\nactors. This attack also coincided with the timing of the annual joint U.S. – South Korea military\nexercises.[322] In September 2012, North Korea signed a cyber treaty with Iran, agreeing the two\nnations would collaborate to combat “common enemies” in cyberspace.[323]\n\nThe week of March 11, 2013, the U.S. and South Korea began their annual joint military exercise\nnear the Korean Peninsula. Like clockwork, attacks attributed to North Korea and now known as\nthe March 20 attacks targeted three South Korean media outlets and Shinhan, Nonghyup, and Jeju\nbanks. North Korea also exhibited other hostile activity at that time. North Korea cut\ncommunication with Seoul and announced it had scrapped the 1953 armistice between the two\nKoreas. North Korea’s foreign ministry also issued a statement that it perceived this exercise as a\nprecursor to invasion and that the regime would respond with a “strong military counteraction” if\nthe situation escalated.[324] That same week, the North Korean military conducted a drone attack\nsimulation.[325]\n\nOn March 18, the Uriminzokkiri YouTube channel posted an anti-U.S. video entitled “Firestorms\nWill Rain on the Headquarters of War” that showed a depiction of the White House in crosshairs,\nfollowed by an explosion.[326]\n\n[314 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war)\n[315 http://powerofcommunity.net/poc2009/si.pdf](http://powerofcommunity.net/poc2009/si.pdf)\n[316 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war)\n317 http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron\n[318 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war)\n319 http://threatpost.com/report-north-korea-accused-ddos-attack-south-korean-airport-060712/76664\n320 http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/03/us-korea-north-cyber-idUSTRE7421Q520110503\n[321 http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2965629](http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2965629)\n[322 http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/south-korean-newspaper-joongang-ilbo-hit-by-major-cyber-attack/story-fn3dxix6-](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/south-korean-newspaper-joongang-ilbo-hit-by-major-cyber-attack/story-fn3dxix6-1226391202749)\n[1226391202749](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/south-korean-newspaper-joongang-ilbo-hit-by-major-cyber-attack/story-fn3dxix6-1226391202749)\n[323 http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2202493/iran-and-north-korea-sign-technology-treaty-to-combat-hostile-malware](http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2202493/iran-and-north-korea-sign-technology-treaty-to-combat-hostile-malware)\n324 http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/03/20/294499/north-korea-threatens-us-over-bombers/\n325 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/20/north-koreas-drone_n_2914794.html\n[326 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyap eCiOl9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyap)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25 Uriminzokkiri YouTube video portraying anti-U.S. sentiments. [327]\n\nIn May 2013, DarkSeoul malware was used to attack several South Korean financial institutions;\nand in June, DarkSeoul DDoS attacks were launched against the South Korean government’s DNS\nserver. The latter took place on June 25, the anniversary of the start of the Korean War.[328]\n\nAs evidenced above, much of North Korea’s cyber activity coincides with the annual U.S. – South\nKorea joint military exercises. Attacks not following that pattern were typically in response to\npolitical events impacting the regime or correlated with significant dates, such as the anniversary\nof the start of the Korean War. The regime’s strategic assets and tactical capabilities in the cyber\narena seem to have evolved only slightly since 2009. Most of the attacks attributed to North\nKorea employ limited tactics, and their operational capability demonstrates an increase in the\nfrequency and volume of attacks but is otherwise unimpressive to date.\n\nIn June 2014, the regime demanded cancellation of the annual U.S. - South Korea joint military\nexercise, attempting to use participation in the upcoming Asian Games as a bargaining chip.[329] The\nregime’s demands may have had other political motivations, as they preceded the July 2014\nmeeting between South Korean president Park and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The meeting\n\n327 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyapeCiOl9A\n[328 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war)\n329 http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/north-korea-demands-cancellation-drills\n\n\n-----\n\ncentered on trade and regional security issues, including the ever-present rhetoric around\ndenuclearization of North Korea.[330] Both leaders were critical of Japan’s recent announcement to\nsoften sanctions on North Korea.[331] As this report headed to press, the annual U.S. – South Korea\njoint military exercises were underway.[332]\n\n#### DarkSeoul \n\nThe most prominent North Korean threat actor group is the group responsible for the DarkSeoul\nmalware. According to statements from the South Korean government, North Korea’s Lab 110\nwere the actors behind the DarkSeoul malware. South Korean intelligence reports\n\nAccording to statements\n\nstated that Lab 110, which is affiliated with the regime’s defense ministry, was\n\nfrom the South Korean\n\nordered by the North Korean regime to destroy South Korean communications government, North\nnetworks.[333] Although the March 20 attacks used DarkSeoul malware, it is interesting Korea’s Lab 110 were the\nto note that two groups, WhoIs Team and New Romantic Cyber Army Team, claimed actors behind the\n\nDarkSeoul malware\n\nresponsibility for the “March 20” 2013 attacks on South Korean media and financial\n\nattacks.\n\ninstitutions.[334]\n\nSome of the DarkSeoul attacks corresponded with significant dates, such as U.S. Independence\nDay or the anniversary of the start of the Korean War. DarkSeoul attacks go beyond denial of\nservice and sabotage. As early as 2009, the group responsible for the Dark Seoul attacks\nlaunched “Operation Troy”, an espionage campaign targeting the South Korean military. The\noperation was codenamed “Troy” due to the frequent use of the word “Troy” in the malware’s\ncompile path strings.[335] The malware used in these attacks sought out and exfiltrated data, based\non keyword searches. While the malware was clearly intended to search for and exfiltrate certain\ntypes of data, its true impact on the targets was never revealed. [336] The March 2011 “10 Days of\nRain” DDoS attacks on U.S. and South Korean sites have also been attributed to the actors\nassociated with DarkSeoul.[337] According to Symantec, the politically motivated attacks have\nrequired a level of intelligence, coordination, monetary support, and technical sophistication that\nsuggests state sponsorship.[338] This designation means the group can be considered an advanced\npersistent threat (APT).\n\nA March 20, 2013 attack attributed to the DarkSeoul actors targeted three South Korean media\noutlets and Shinhan, Nonghyup, and Jeju banks. The impact of the March 20 attacks included\ndisruption of service at financial institutions and data deletion. However, the targeted entities\nresumed normal operations shortly thereafter.[339] According to South Korean reports, the media\noutlets targeted corresponded with those listed by the North Korean regime in 2012 as right-wing\npress that manipulated South Korea’s public opinion. In April 2012, the regime reportedly listed\n\n\n330 http://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/02/world/asia/south-korea-xi-visit/index.html?hpt=hp_bn7\n331 http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/sinosphere/2014/07/07/q-and-a-john-delury-on-chinese-south-korean-ties/?smid=tw-share\n332 http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/140825/n-korea-urges-un-action-against-s-korea-us-military-drill\n333 http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/11/south-korea-blames-north-korea-cyber-attacks\n334 http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/2013/1019/In-cyberarms-race-North-Korea-emerging-as-a-power-not-a-pushover/(page)/2\n335 http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-and-breaches/south-korean-bank-hackers-target-us-military-secrets/d/d-id/1110674?\n336 http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-dark-seoul-hackers-were-after-south-korean-military-secrets\n337 http://blogs.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/McAfee-Labs-10-Days-of-Rain-July-2011.pdf\n338 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war\n339 http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/asia/south-korea-computer-network-crashes.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&\n\n\n-----\n\nthose entities as attack targets.[340] The malware used in the March 20, 2013 attacks were wiper\nmalware. The malware attempted to disable AhnLab and Hauri AV antivirus products then\nproceeded to overwrite the master boot record (MBR). The attack was capable of wiping both\nLinux and Windows machines.[341] McAfee found that these attacks were the culmination of the\nmalware campaign they dubbed “Operation Troy”.[342]\n\nA report from IssueMakersLab tied the actors responsible for the March 20, 2013 attacks to cyber\nattack activity occurring as early as 2007. IssueMakersLab found that these actors consistently\nused the same 16-digit password for file compression, the same stage 1 C2 protocol, the same\ncollection keywords and encryption keys, and the same development path.[343] According to South\nKorea’s Korea Internet and Security Agency, the North Korean IP address 175.45.178.xx was\nfound scanning South Korean routes the month before the attacks,[344] and the same IP was\nreportedly logged as accessing one of the targets 13 times.[345] Details of the March 20 attack also\nsuggested possible ties to China. AlienVault suspected the Chinese exploit kit GonDad was used to\nspread the malware, and the Korean domains serving the malware were registered using a\nChinese email address.

RAON_ASRT is a\nSouth Korean white hat capture the flag (CTF) team, whose members also operate under the\nname “WhoIs”.[357]\n\nl\nFigure 27 A screenshot showing that South Korea’s RAON_ASRT white hat CTF team also uses the\nmoniker WhoIs.[358]\n\nRAON_ASRT (the RaonSecure Advanced Security Research Team) and its sub-teams WhoIs Team\nand Cpark Team[359] have participated in and performed well in CTF contests such as the one\nhosted by [DefCon.](https://www.defcon.org/) [360] In 2013, a member of RAON_ASRT was invited to Blue House, the residence\nof the South Korean president, to meet with president Park and discuss the security industry.[361]\nRAON_ASRT runs the Secuinside CTF competition.[362] Their parent organization RaonSecure\noperates a whitehat training program.[363] The group also runs the Korea WhiteHat Contest, which\nis hosted by South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense and National Intelligence Service and\n\n357 https://ctftime.org/team/3206\n358 https://ctftime.org/team/3206\n359 http://ls-al.org/asrt-has-become-the-winner-of-codegate-2013/\n360 http://blog.raonsecure.com/62\n361 http://ls-al.org/asrt-researcher-meets-the-president-park-in-korea/\n362 http://ls-al.org/asrt-runs-secuinside-ctf/\n363 http://www.whitehat.co.kr/\n\n\n-----\n\nsupervised by South Korean Cyber Command.[364] For these reasons, it seems unlikely that the\nRAON_ASRT WhoIs Team would maliciously target South Korean entities.\n\n#### IsOne\n\nIsOne is the group that claimed responsibility for the June 2012 attack on the website of South\nKorean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo. The attack included an attempt to wipe JoongAng Ilbo’s servers\nas well as a defacement depicting a laughing cat. Despite efforts to wipe the target’s servers, the\ntarget only suffered defacement and temporary downtime.[365]\n\nFigure 28 Defacement by “IsOne”. [366]\n\nAlthough the groups have a similar name and both use a cat theme, it is unclear whether a CTF\nteam known as “The Cat is Number 1” and IsOne are the same actors. “The Cat is Number 1”\nmembers claim to hail from North Korea, but there is no hard evidence linking team members to\n\n364 http://ls-al.org/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD-%ED%99%94%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8%ED%96%87%EC%BD%98%ED%85%8C%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8korea-whitehat-contest-%EA%B0%9C%EC%B5%9C/\n365 http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2965629\n366 http://bad-bytes.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/joongang-ilbo-cyber-attack.html\n\n\n-----\n\nthe region.[367] Again, it seems that the actors responsible for the attack borrowed the moniker of\nanother group.\n\nFigure 29 A screenshot of “The Cat is Number One” profile on CTF Time [368]\n\nAccording to South Korea’s National Police Agency, the attack on JoongAng Ilbo shares\ncharacteristics with previous attacks attributed to North Korean actors. An investigation\nconducted by the agency’s Cyber Terror Response Center found that the actors targeting\nJoongAng Ilbo used two North Korean servers and 17 servers in 10 other countries. One server\nmaintained a constant connection to an IP address belonging to Joson Telecommunication\nCompany, which is affiliated with North Korea’s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.\nInvestigators found that one of the servers used in the attack on JoongAng Ilbo was also used in\nthe March 2011 DDoS attacks on South Korean critical infrastructure sites and the April 2011\nattack on Nyongyup Bank.[369]\n\nKnown tactics, techniques and procedures\n\n  - Wiper malware\n\n  - Defacements\n\nTargets\n\n  - Took credit for defacing JoongAng Ilbo.\n\n367 https://ctftime.org/team/2538\n368 https://ctftime.org/team/2538\n369 http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2965629\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Kimsukyang\n\nThe Kimsuky malware, which targeted South Korean think tanks, is loosely attributed to an actor\nreferred to as Kimsukyang.

Analysis of this malware is included in](http://info.hpenterprisesecurity.com/register_hpenterprisesecurity_cyber_risk_report_2013?src=blogs)\nAppendix C. Analysis of additional malware used in these campaigns produced no new findings\nand only corroborated what was found by external security researchers. These publicly available\nanalyses have been cited throughout the report. Some of the malware samples were no longer\npublicly available. However, CrowdStrike obtained these missing samples before they\ndisappeared from the wild and conducted thorough analysis, which was released in their\nsubscription-only reports. While we cannot divulge detailed information from those reports, an\noverview of the findings is provided below.\n\n374 http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-and-breaches/south-korean-bank-hackers-target-us-military-secrets/d/d-id/1110674?\n375 http://www.roman-empire.net/army/army.html#earlylegion\n376 http://eromang.zataz.com/2013/04/02/dark-south-korea-total-war-review/\n377 http://eromang.zataz.com/2013/04/02/dark-south-korea-total-war-review/\n378 http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-dissecting-operation-troy.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nThe majority of the malware used in cyber incidents attributed to North Korea were variations of\nthree types of malware: dropper, wiper, and IRC remote access trojan (RAT). CrowdStrike’s\nattribution of this malware to North Korean actors stemmed from two primary factors: Korean\nlanguage characters found in the binaries and the propensity to specifically target South Korean\nentities.[379]\n\nDropper samples consistently targeted AhnLab Policy Center as a propagation method. This\ninformation is corroborated in a Black Hat Asia 2014 presentation by Fortinet researcher Kyle\nYang.[380] CrowdStrike’s report also briefly noted the use of an update server vector.[381] Yang\nanalyzed the malware's update config metadata and matched its format to the AhnLab Policy\nCenter. To test its payload, Yang set up a server/client and executed the update through the\nserver. As Yang had predicted, it wiped the client.[382] While the method for initial compromise of\nthe update server is not noted in detail, CrowdStrike’s report cites “collateral information” that\nsuggests targeted email attacks were used to gain initial entry, and policy servers were then\ncompromised. The upload server vector included a time-based logic bomb that allowed the wiper\nto target a large number of systems, on a set time and date, with full permissions on all of the\ntargeted systems.[383]\n\nAccording to CrowdStrike, the wiper malware was dropped on the systems as AgentBase.exe. The\nwiper used the Windows utility 'taskkill' to kill the processes pasvc.exe and clisvc.exe, which are\nthe main processes for the Ahnlab and Hauri antivirus applications.[384] [385] The wiper then\nperformed system reconnaissance, gathering drive information and operating system version.\nDepending on the OS used, the wiper recursively deleted files on the file system, deleting the\nWindows folder last. It then overwrote the MBR with the strings \"HASTATI\", \"PRINCPES\",\n\"PRINCIPES\", or \"PR!NCPES”.[386]\n\nWhile there are several variants of the wiper, all seem to have been used on the same date. It is\nunclear why multiple wiper variants with slightly differing behavior were used for the same\ncampaign. One possible explanation is that multiple variants were used to minimize the\noperational damage to the mission in the case of an early detection of one of the variants. For\nexample, if one wiper variant was compromised or detected by antivirus or IDS signatures, the\nother variants may have differed enough to remain undetected, still resulting in mission success.\n\nAccording to CrowdStrike, a third malware component downloaded an IRC RAT from various\ncompromised websites. This RAT is detected by Symantec as Backdoor.Prioxer. Prioxer has been\nlinked to other 2011 attacks on South Korea. It is unclear whether these downloaders were\n\n379 CrowdStrike Intelligence Report CSIR-13013\n380 Yang, Kyle. Z:\\Make Troy\\, Not War: Case Study of the Wiper APT in Korea, and Beyond.

However, the two malware types both\nuse the same packer 'Jokra' and both contain the strings “HASTATI\" and \"PRINCPES”.[387]\n\n### Analysis \n\nBased on the information above, we have identified strategic challenges that impact the\ndevelopment of North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities. We have also noted relevant\nimplications:\n\n  - The North Korean regime strictly controls all Internet infrastructure,[388] meaning cyber\nactivity by dissidents or autonomous hacker groups are very unlikely. In other words, any\ncyber attacks originating in North Korea can be assumed to be state sponsored. For this\nreason, according to defectors, the regime’s cyber operators do not typically launch\nattacks directly from within North Korea. Instead, many regime-sponsored attacks are\nlaunched from cells based in China, U.S., South Asia, Europe, and even South Korea.[389]\n\n  - North Korea has a limited number of outgoing connections.[390] For this reason, there is a\nlow probability of DDoS originating from within. However, this does not preclude the use\nof botnets with a local C2 server or the use of networks in third-party nations to launch\nattacks. As seen in the July 2009 attacks on South Korean and U.S. targets, North Korea\nhas leveraged networks in countries such as Austria, Georgia, Germany, and even South\nKorea and the U.S., in order to launch cyber attacks.[391] North Korea will likely be forced to\nrely on third parties for quite some time, due to its lack of sufficient infrastructure for\nlaunching large-scale CNO.\n\n  - Several outward facing websites are hosted in China and other countries. This implies two\npossibilities: that North Korea’s infrastructure cannot handle a heavy incoming traffic load\n\n392 or that the regime wants to separate the propaganda crafted for an outside target\naudience from internally-focused propaganda. This arrangement seems unlikely to\nchange in the foreseeable future.\n\n  - North Korea is known to have unstable power supplies[393], which limits scalability of the\nregime’s current CNO capabilities. This is another reason why expansion of CNO\ncapabilities using the nation’s own infrastructure seems unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\n  - North Korea is known to have monetary deficiencies,[394] which further limit expansion of\ninfrastructure and CNO capabilities, at least without third-party aid. North Korea continues\nto rely heavily on China for sustainment.[395]\n\n  - Although we see few instances of overt cyber operations, that North Korea reportedly\nspends so much of its limited resources on training and equipping cyber operators speaks\nvolumes. The human element of the regime’s cyber war program, at least, has potential.\n\n387 CrowdStrike Intelligence Report CSIR-13013\n388 http://www.defense.gov/pubs/North_Korea_Military_Power_Report_2013-2014.pdf\n389 http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/2013/1019/In-cyberarms-race-North-Korea-emerging-as-a-power-not-a-pushover/(page)/5\n390 http://www.defense.gov/pubs/North_Korea_Military_Power_Report_2013-2014.pdf\n391 http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/11/south-korea-blames-north-korea-cyber-attacks\n392 http://binarycore.org/2012/05/30/investigating-north-koreas-netblock-part-3-topology/\n393 http://38north.org/2010/09/speak-loudly-and-carry-a-small-stick-the-north-korean-cyber-menace/\n394 http://www.defense.gov/pubs/North_Korea_Military_Power_Report_2013-2014.pdf\n395 http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20140402/101985/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-ScaparrottiUSAC-20140402.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Sanctions against North Korea and export laws prohibit the sale of certain technologies to\nthe regime.[396] In other words, in order to obtain the technology needed for a cyber\nwarfare program, the regime must improvise. North Korea must develop its own\ntechnology, manufacture technology using plans obtained via industrial espionage, or rely\non third parties to procure it for them. However, the regime has historically failed in its\nattempts of large-scale production of electronic components. At present, North Korea\nrelies on China to provide much of its network hardware, including servers and routers.[397]\nIt is unlikely that North Korea will compromise on its nuclear program, meaning sanctions\nwill likely be longstanding, and the regime will have to continue to rely on third parties to\nprocure technology.\n\nCyber incidents attributed to North Korean actors seem to follow distinct patterns:\n\n  - According to reports by other researchers, the conventions and C2 structure used by\nNorth Korean cyber actors show continuity and consistency over time.\n\n  - The majority of the incidents attributed to North Korean actors consistently used wiper\nmalware.\n\n  - Several of the incidents included defacements, with a different group taking credit each\ntime. Additionally, little information or attack history was found about any of the groups,\naside from information acknowledged in this report. These factors seem to indicate that a\nsingle group may have been responsible for several attacks over time, using different\ngroup names as a false flag.\n\n  - On more than one occasion, the malware included provisions to disable security software\nmade by South Korean security company AhnLab. This detail strengthens the case that\nthe malware was written or modified to specifically target South Korean machines.\n\n  - The attacks followed an explicit pattern: most were around the time of U.S. – South\nKorean joint military exercises, while the others fell on a significant date or were in\nresponse to political events.\n\n  - The primary targets were South Korean and U.S. entities. While these nations are\ntraditionally targeted by the regime, it is also possible that South Korean entities are quick\nto attribute any attack on their infrastructure to North Korean actors. In fact, in some\ncases, South Korean reports were the only source of attribution.\n\n### Summary\n\nDoes North Korea have sufficient cyber infrastructure and cyber warfare capabilities to harm the\nU.S. and its allies? While North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities pale in comparison to those of\nwealthier nations, the regime has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure and in\nestablishing cyber operations. The rate of this progress warrants a closer look at North Korea’s\nmotivations, TTPs, and capabilities. As noted above, North Korea views the U.S. and South Korea\nas its primary adversaries. The U.S. and South Korea are high-tech nations with economies that\n\n396 http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/03/exclusive-cash-for-computers-is-un-busting-its-own-sanctions-in-north-korea/\n397 http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/2013/1019/In-cyberarms-race-North-Korea-emerging-as-a-power-not-a-pushover/(page)/4\n\n\n-----\n\ndepend heavily on technology.[398] In contrast, North Korea does not have a high tech culture. For\nthese reasons, we should not overestimate the regime’s advanced cyber capability, yet we should\nnever underestimate the potential impact of North Korea utilizing less advanced, quick-and-dirty\ntactics like DDoS to cripple their high-tech targets. Both government and corporate entities are\nsusceptible to being targeted by North Korean cyber attacks. North Korean juche ideology places\nthe survival of the regime as its primary goal, and any perceived threat to the regime may be\ntargeted. Several attacks on U.S. and South Korean government, financial, and critical\ninfrastructure entities have been attributed to North Korean origins.. These attacks were often\npreceded by or occurred in conjunction with North Korea voicing negative sentiments about the\n[targeted entities. As we saw with Iranian cyber actors in HPSR Security Briefing Episode 11,[399]](http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Security-Research-Blog/HPSR-Threat-Intelligence-Briefing-Episode-11/ba-p/6385243)\nstate sponsored cyber actors often launch an attack in response to a political trigger. The same\npattern seems to apply to pro-North Korean cyber actors, who have launched attacks to coincide\nwith U.S. Independence Day and the anniversary of the start of the Korean War, as well as\npropaganda and cyber attacks in response to joint military exercises between the U.S. and South\nKorea.[400] [401]\n\nAs shown by North Korea's past behavior (which is consistent with their doctrine), they are easily\n\"pushed into a corner\". At the slightest perceived threat, the regime responds with saber-rattling\nand peacocking. The regime is extremely defensive and will, in turn, flex its muscles to show the\nworld how capable it is, even if this is an inaccurate display of their overall capabilities.\n\nThe regime fears losing its control and the nation’s culture to the ever-growing threat of outside\ninfluence, as is evidenced in the regime’s reaction to the comedy film “The Interview”. The regime\nhas represented itself to its citizens as a powerful and capable entity and has used this status to\ncontrol the populace. For this reason, the regime’s leaders are forced to continually demonstrate\nthis strength and power, or an illusion thereof, both domestically and globally, in order to\nmaintain the status needed to ensure continued suppression of the population. This show of\npower may require that the regime takes chances and stretches beyond its abilities at times, but\nin the spirit of juche and songun, the regime will continue this façade, fearful of losing the image\nits leaders have worked so hard to maintain.\n\n### HP Security Research recommendations\n\nNorth Korean cyber operations are not generally observed originating from home field IP address\nspace, so geo-IP based blocking of traffic originating from those net-blocks is ineffective.\n\n398 http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/BytesAndBullets/CH2.pdf\n399 http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Security-Research-Blog/HPSR-Threat-Intelligence-Briefing-Episode-11/ba-p/6385243#.U5HkbpRdV90\n400 http://www.zdnet.com/south-korea-braces-for-norths-cyberattacks-7000012587/\n401 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/four-years-darkseoul-cyberattacks-against-south-korea-continue-anniversary-korean-war\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven that North Korea has capable and technically trained forces and will demonstrate their\npower when they feel provoked, western entities should consciously avoid promoting ideas or\ndoctrine that is blatantly slanderous to the regime. Encouraging such ideas could cause those\nentities to become a focal point for North Korean cyber attacks.\n\nDue to the fact that North Korean infrastructure is aging and its resources are not able to keep up\nwith the rest of the world, entities with interesting R&D or IP (intellectual property) - especially\nmilitary in nature – could become targets of interest for North Korea. Interest in defense-related\nIP and R&D could also stem from North Korea’s relationship with China. In the Chinese business\nculture, taking another entity’s IP or R&D is not stealing – it is accepted as business as usual. It is\npossible that North Korea, if under Chinese influence, would adopt the same attitude, given the\nregime’s limited capacity for homegrown innovation.\n\nKnown DPRK targets have been limited primarily to South Korean and U.S. organizations and\ngovernment entities. For these targets, prudent measures should include:\n\n      - Following traditional defense in depth approaches and security best practices\n\n      - Monitoring for malware that disables Korean language antivirus software, such as\nthat from AhnLab\n\n      - To protect against the attack vectors used in North Korean malware campaigns,\nan advisable prevention tactic is to focus on hardening update/patch\nmanagement systems. These systems are appealing targets due to the potential\nfor a large impact\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A – WHOIS records\n\n**WHOIS record for silibank.net:**\nDomain Name: silibank.net\nRegistry

The password is then decrypted.\n\nAfter extracting these connection and server details, the dropper uses the previously dropped alg.\nexe and conime.exe to attempt to connect remote servers, upload and run the bash script\n~pr1.tmp.\n\nThe bash script initially checks which UNIX it is running on (of HP-UX, SunOS, Linux, or AIX) and\nthen attempts to wipe the /kernel, /usr /etc and /home directories, thus rendering the machine\ninoperative.\n\n**Win32 Wiper component**\n\nWhen the AgentBase.exe component is executed, it first attempts to stop the following processes,\npresumably in order to evade detection:\n\n- pasvc.exe – policy agent from AhnLab\n\n- clisvc.exe – ViRobot ISMS from Hauri\n\nIt then enumerates all physical drives and overwrites the first 512 bytes with the string:\n“princpes”, effectively destroying the MBR (master boot record) of the affected drive.\n\nIt continues to look for removable and fixed drives, locates the root directory on these drives, and\nthen attempts to delete all files and folders in this directory.\n\nFinally, the affected computer is shut down and rebooted, although if the wiping mechanisms\nwere successful then the machine will not be able to boot.\n\n#### Learn more at hp.com/go/hpsr\n\n\n-----",
