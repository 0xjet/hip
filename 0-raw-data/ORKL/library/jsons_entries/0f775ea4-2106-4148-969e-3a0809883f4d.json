The EasyDoc Converter.app poses\nas a drag-and-drop file converter, but has no real functionality – it simply downloads a\nmalicious script.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script installs and registers the following components to system startup:\n\n**Tor Hidden Service**\n\nThis component creates a Tor hidden service that allows an attacker to anonymously access\nthe control-and-command center from the outside – a local web server dubbed Web Service\n(PHP) – via a Tor-generated address.\n\n**Web Service (PHP)**\n\nThis component acts as the C&C center and gives the attacker full control over the infected\nmachine. The web service is set up locally and can be accessed through the “onion”\naddress. After authenticating with the correct password, attackers gain access to a webbased control panel with the following abilities:\n\n- File manager (view, edit, rename, delete, upload, download, and archive files)\n\n- Command execution (execute commands)\n\n- Script execution (execute scripts in PHP, PERL, Python, Ruby, Java, C)\n\n- Shell via bind/reverse shell connect (remotely execute root commands)\n\n- Simple packet crafter (probe firewall rule-sets and find entry points into a targeted system\nor network)\n\n- Connect and administer databases\n\n- Process list/Task manager (access the list of processes and applications running on the\nsystem)\n\n- Send emails with attached files\n\n_Attacker control panel_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware uses a tool named wacaw to\ncapture images and videos from built-in\nwebcams.\n\n_Gallery Panel_\n\nIt also uses a daemon to grab updates and fetch files from the user’s computer or execute\nshell scripts.\n\n**Pastebin Agent**\n\nEvery infected machine has a unique Tor address that the attacker uses to connect and\ndownload the malware. All the addresses are stored on pastebin.com using this agent, after\nbeing encrypted with a public key using RSA and base64 algorithms.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Consequences**\n\n“This type of malware is particularly dangerous as it’s hard to detect and offers the attacker\nfull control of the compromised system,” says Tiberius Axinte, Technical Leader, Bitdefender\nAntimalware Lab. “For instance, someone can lock you out of your laptop, threaten to\nblackmail you to restore your private files or transform your laptop into a botnet to attack\nother devices. The possibilities are endless.”\n\nThis app is not digitally signed by Apple. As a good safety precaution, Bitdefender\nrecommends downloading applications exclusively from reputable websites, and using a\nsecurity solution for Apple devices to fend off Mac-targeting malware and other specific\nthreats.\n\n[[Read the full report here]](https://labs.bitdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Backdoor-MAC-Eleanor_final.pdf)\n\n_Technical analysis was provided by Tiberius Axinte, Technical Leader at Bitdefender_\n_Antimalware Lab and Dragos Gavrilut, Antimalware Research Manager._\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Alexandra GHEORGHE\n\nAlexandra started writing about IT at the dawn of the decade - when an iPad was an eyeinjury patch, we were minus Google+ and we all had Jobs.\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/agheorghe/)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
