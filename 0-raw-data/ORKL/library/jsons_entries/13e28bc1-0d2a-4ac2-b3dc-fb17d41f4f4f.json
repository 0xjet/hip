Shutterstock\n\nFor years, an enduring mystery has surrounded the Stuxnet virus attack that targeted Iran’s\nnuclear program: How did the U.S. and Israel get their malware onto computer systems at\nthe highly secured uranium-enrichment plant?\n\nThe first-of-its-kind virus, designed to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program, effectively launched\nthe era of digital warfare and was unleashed some time in 2007, after Iran began installing its\nfirst batch of centrifuges at a controversial enrichment plant near the village of Natanz.\n\nThe courier behind that intrusion, whose existence and role has not been previously\nreported, was an inside mole recruited by Dutch intelligence agents at the behest of the CIA\nand the Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad, according to sources who spoke with Yahoo\nNews.\n\nAn Iranian engineer recruited by the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD provided critical data\nthat helped the U.S. developers target their code to the systems at Natanz, according to four\nintelligence sources. That mole then provided much-needed inside access when it came time\nto slip Stuxnet onto those systems using a USB flash drive.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Dutch were asked in 2004 to help the CIA and Mossad get access to the plant, but it\nwasn’t until three years later that the mole, who posed as a mechanic working for a front\ncompany doing work at Natanz, delivered the digital weapon to the targeted systems. “[T]he\nDutch mole was the most important way of getting the virus into Natanz,” one of the sources\ntold Yahoo.\n\nNeither the CIA nor the Mossad responded to inquiries from Yahoo News about the\ninformation. The AIVD declined to comment on its involvement in the operation.\n\nThe now famous covert operation known as “Olympic Games” was designed not to destroy\nIran’s nuclear program outright but to set it back for a while to buy time for sanctions and\ndiplomacy to take effect. That strategy was successful in helping to bring Iran to the\nnegotiating table, and ultimately resulted in an agreement with the country in 2015.\n\nThe revelation of Dutch involvement harkens back to a time when there was still extensive\ncooperation and strong, multilateral agreement among the U.S. and its allies about how to\ndeal with the Iranian nuclear program — a situation that changed last year after the Trump\nadministration pulled out of the hard-won nuclear accord with Tehran.\n\nPresident Trump displays a document reinstating sanctions against Iran after announcing the\nU.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, May 8, 2018.

But the U.S. and Israel had assistance from three other\nnations, according to sources, hence the covert codename that gave nod to the five-ring\nsymbol of the world’s most famous international sporting event. Two of the three participating\nplayers were the Netherlands and Germany. The third is believed to be France, although\nU.K. intelligence also played a role.\n\nGermany contributed technical specifications and knowledge about the industrial control\nsystems made by the German firm Siemens that were used in the Iranian plant to control the\nspinning centrifuges, according to sources. France is believed to have provided intelligence\nof a similar sort.\n\nBut the Dutch were in a unique position to perform a different role — delivering key\nintelligence about Iran’s activities to procure equipment from Europe for its illicit nuclear\nprogram, as well as information about the centrifuges themselves. This is because the\ncentrifuges at Natanz were based on designs stolen from a Dutch company in the 1970s by\nPakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. Khan stole the designs to build Pakistan’s nuclear\nprogram, then proceeded to market them to other countries, including Iran and Libya.\n\nThe Dutch intelligence agency, known as AIVD, along with U.S. and British intelligence,\ninfiltrated Khan’s supply network of European consultants and front companies who helped\nbuild the nuclear programs in Iran and Libya. That infiltration didn’t just involve old-school\ntradecraft but also employed offensive hacking operations being developed as part of the\nburgeoning field of digital espionage.\n\nAIVD’s cyber capabilities are well known now — last year it was revealed that AIVD was\nresponsible for tipping off the FBI to the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee,\n[knowledge it had acquired because its operatives had hacked into computers belonging to](https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/dutch-agencies-provide-crucial-intel-about-russia-s-interference-in-us-elections~b4f8111b/?referer=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/26/dutch-media-reveal-country-to-be-secret-u-s-ally-in-war-against-russian-hackers/)\nthe Russian hacking group known as Cozy Bear in 2014 and were watching in 2015 when\nthe Russians broke into computers at the U.S. State Department and the DNC.\n\nBut during the early days of Iran’s nuclear program, AIVD’s hacking team was small and still\ndeveloping.\n\n\n-----\n\nNuclear physicist Adbul Qadeer Khan. (Photo: Robert Nickelsberg/Life Images Collection via\nGetty Images)\n\nThe Iranian program, which had been on the back burner for years, kicked into high gear in\n1996, when Iran secretly purchased a set of blueprints and centrifuge components from\nKhan. In 2000, Iran broke ground at Natanz with plans to build a facility that would hold\n50,000 spinning centrifuges for enriching uranium gas. That same year, AIVD hacked the\nemail system of a key Iranian defense organization in an effort to obtain more information\nabout Iran’s nuclear plans, according to sources.\n\nIsraeli and Western intelligence agencies secretly monitored the progress at Natanz over the\nnext two years, until August 2002, when an Iranian dissident group publicly exposed the\nIranian program at a press conference in Washington, D.C., using information provided by\nthe intelligence agencies. Inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United\nNations body that monitors nuclear programs around the world, demanded access to Natanz\nand were alarmed to discover that the Iranian program was much further along than\nbelieved.\n\nIran was pressed into agreeing to halt all activity at Natanz while the IAEA sought to obtain\nmore information about the nuclear program, and the suspension continued throughout all of\n2004 and most of 2005. But it was only a matter of time before operations at Natanz\nresumed, and the CIA and the Mossad wanted to be inside when they did.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe request to the Dutch for help with this came toward the end of 2004, when a Mossad\nliaison working out of the Israeli Embassy in the Hague and a CIA official based at the U.S.\nEmbassy met with a representative from AIVD. There was no talk yet about inserting a digital\nweapon into the control systems at Natanz; the aim at that time was still just intelligence.\n\nBut the timing wasn’t random. In 2003, British and U.S. intelligence had landed a huge coup\nwhen they intercepted a ship containing thousands of centrifuge components headed to\nLibya — components for the same model of centrifuges used at Natanz. The shipment\nprovided clear evidence of Libya’s illicit nuclear program. Libya was persuaded to give up the\nprogram in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, and also agreed to relinquish any\ncomponents already received.\n\nBy March 2004, the U.S., under protest from the Dutch, had seized the components from the\nship and those already in Libya and flown them to the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee\nand to a facility in Israel. Over the next months, scientists assembled the centrifuges and\nstudied them to determine how long it might take for Iran to enrich enough gas to make a\nbomb. Out of this came the plot to sabotage the centrifuges.\n\nThe Department of Energy complex at Oak Ridge, Tenn. (Photo: Cryptome.org)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Dutch intelligence agency already had an insider in Iran, and after the request from the\nCIA and Mossad came in, the mole decided to set up two parallel tracks — each involving a\nlocal front company — with the hope that one would succeed getting into Natanz.\n\nEstablishing a dummy company with employees, customers and records showing a history of\nactivity, takes time, and time was in short supply. In late 2005, Iran announced it was\nwithdrawing from the suspension agreement, and in February 2006 it began to enrich its first\nbatch of uranium hexaflouride gas in a pilot plant in Natanz. The Iranians ran into some\nproblems that slowed them down, however, and it wasn’t until February 2007 that they\nformally launched the enrichment program by installing the first centrifuges in the main halls\nat Natanz.\n\nBy then, development of the attack code was already long under way. A sabotage test was\nconducted with centrifuges some time in 2006 and presented to President George Bush, who\nauthorized the covert operation once he was shown it could actually succeed.\n\nBy May 2007, Iran had 1,700 centrifuges installed at Natanz that were enriching gas, with\nplans to double that number by summer. But sometime before the summer of 2007, the\nDutch mole was inside Natanz.\n\nThe first company the mole established had failed to get into Natanz — there was a problem\nwith the way the company was set up, according to two of the sources, and “the Iranians\nwere already suspicious,” one explained.\n\nThe second company, however, got assistance from Israel. This time, the Dutch mole, who\nwas an engineer by training, managed to get inside Natanz by posing as a mechanic. His\nwork didn’t involve installing the centrifuges, but it got him where he needed to be to collect\nconfiguration information about the systems there. He apparently returned to Natanz a few\ntimes over the course of some months.\n\n“[He] had to get … in several times in order to collect essential information [that could be\nused to] update the virus accordingly,” one of the sources told Yahoo News.\n\nThe sources didn’t provide details about the information he collected, but Stuxnet was meant\nto be a precision attack that would only unleash its sabotage if it found a very specific\nconfiguration of equipment and network conditions. Using the information the mole provided,\nthe attackers were able to update the code and provide some of that precision.\n\nThere is, in fact, evidence of updates to the code occurring during this period. According to\nthe security firm Symantec, which reverse-engineered Stuxnet after it was discovered, the\nattackers made updates to the code in May 2006 and again in February 2007, just as Iran\nbegan installing the centrifuges at Natanz. But they made final changes to the code on Sept.\n24, 2007, modifying key functions that were needed to pull off the attack, and compiled the\ncode on that date. Compiling code is the final stage before launching it.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn aerial view of the Natanz fuel enrichment plant. (Photo: DigitalGlobe via Getty Images)\n\nThe code was designed to close exit valves on random numbers of centrifuges so that gas\nwould go into them but couldn’t get out. This was intended to raise the pressure inside the\ncentrifuges and cause damage over time and also waste gas.\n\nThis version of Stuxnet had just one way to spread — via a USB flash drive. The Siemens\ncontrol systems at Natanz were air-gapped, meaning they weren’t connected to the internet,\nso the attackers had to find a way to jump that gap to infect them. Engineers at Natanz\nprogrammed the control systems with code loaded onto USB flash drives, so the mole either\ndirectly installed the code himself by inserting a USB into the control systems or he infected\nthe system of an engineer, who then unwittingly delivered Stuxnet when he programmed the\ncontrol systems using a USB stick.\n\nOnce that was accomplished, the mole didn’t return to Natanz again, but the malware\nworked its sabotage throughout 2008. In 2009 the attackers decided to change tactics and\nlaunched a new version of the code in June that year and again in March and April 2010.\nThis version, instead of closing valves on the centrifuges, varied the speed at which the\ncentrifuges spun, alternatively speeding them up to a level beyond which they were designed\nto spin and slowing them down. The aim was to both damage the centrifuges and undermine\nthe efficiency of the enrichment process. Notably, the attackers had also updated and\n\n\n-----\n\ncompiled this version of the attack code back on Sept. 24, 2007, when they had compiled the\ncode for the first version — suggesting that intelligence the Dutch mole had provided in 2007\nmay have contributed to this version as well.\n\nBy the time this later version of the code was unleashed, however, the attackers had lost the\ninside access to Natanz that they had enjoyed through the mole — or perhaps they simply\nno longer needed it. They got this version of Stuxnet into Natanz by infecting external targets\nwho brought it into the plant. The targets were employees of five Iranian companies — all of\nthem contractors in the business of installing industrial control systems in Natanz and other\nfacilities in Iran — who became unwitting couriers for the digital weapon.\n\n“It’s amazing that we’re still getting insights into the development process of Stuxnet [10\nyears after its discovery],” said Liam O’Murchu, director of development for the Security\nTechnology and Response division at Symantec. O’Murchu was one of three researchers at\nthe company who reversed the code after it was discovered. “It’s interesting to see that they\nhad the same strategy for [the first version of Stuxnet] but that it was a more manual\nprocess. ... They needed to have someone on the ground whose life was at risk when they\nwere pulling off this operation.”\n\nO’Murchu thinks the change in tactics for the later version of Stuxnet may be a sign that the\ncapabilities of the attackers improved so that they no longer needed an inside mole.\n\n“Maybe … back in 2004 they didn’t have the ability to do this in an automated way without\nhaving someone on the ground,” he said. “Whereas five years later they were able to pull off\nthe entire attack without having an asset on the ground and putting someone at risk.”\n\nBut their later tactic had a different drawback. The attackers added multiple spreading\nmechanisms to this version of the code to increase the likelihood that it would reach the\ntarget systems inside Natanz. This caused Stuxnet to spread wildly out of control, first to\nother customers of the five contractors, and then to thousands of other machines around the\nworld, leading to Stuxnet’s discovery and public exposure in June 2010.\n\n\n-----\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and Iranian technicians at the nuclear power\nplant in Natanz, Iran, in January 2014. (Photo: Kazem Ghane/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMonths after Stuxnet’s discovery, a [website in Israel indicated that Iran had arrested and](https://www.debka.com/iran-may-have-executed-nuclear-staffers-over-stuxnet/)\npossibly executed several workers at Natanz under the belief that they helped get the\nmalware onto systems at the plant. Two of the intelligence sources who spoke with Yahoo\nNews indicated that there indeed had been loss of life over the Stuxnet program, but didn’t\nsay whether this included the Dutch mole.\n\nWhile Stuxnet didn’t significantly set back the Iranian program — due to its premature\ndiscovery — it did help buy time for diplomacy and sanctions to bring Iran to the negotiating\ntable. Stuxnet also changed the nature of warfare and launched a digital arms race. It led\nother countries, including Iran, to see the value in using offensive cyber operations to\nachieve political aims — a consequence the U.S. has been dealing with ever since.\n\nGen. Michael Hayden, former head of the CIA and the NSA, acknowledged its\ngroundbreaking nature when he likened the Stuxnet operation to the atomic bombs dropped\non Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n“I don’t want to pretend it’s the same effect,” he said, “but in one sense at least, it’s August\n1945.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Kim Zetter is a journalist and the author of Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch_\nof the World’s First Digital Weapon.
