My colleagues sent me over some weird samples that were flagged as\n**SunCrypt that were also beaconing to Maze C2 infrastructure, however they weren’t Maze but**\nshared some similarities and that’s basically why they did it as they know my interest in\nransomware and my personal fascination with Maze.\n\nAs I was checking a couple of hashes, I saw very interesting things that made me go hands-on\nto investigate further and I ended up spending a lot of time not only analysing but also hunting\nand creating some detections for this malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nInitial Open Source Intelligence shows that SunCrypt made its first appearance around\nOctober 2019 and it has been active since then. The SunCrypt team is active on underground\nforums where they look for affiliates for their program just like the rest of ransomware operating\nunder the RaaS model.\n\n\nSunCrypt forum advertisement\n\n\nIn their advertisement in a popular forum, shared in Twitter by ShadowIntelligence, can be\nobserved some of the features they offer for their product such as crypto independency from\nthe Windows CryptoAPI, “bypass” of 70% of the AV engines, which is not a lot..but I guess at\nleast they didn’t lie selling it as FUD as other threat actors, asynchronous search and\nencryption, speed etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally to the lock service, the SunCrypt team provides DDoS if they consider it as part of\nthe extortion to get the ransom paid.\n\n\nSunCrypt shaming website\n\n\nSunCrypt shaming site where they expose victims, status and data dumps\nFor some journalists and websites related to infosec, they are part of what they call “The Maze\n**Cartel” and they also drew some shy lines associating this team with Maze.**\n\nMy personal opinion: I don’t believe such thing as a Cartel exists but sounds fancy. This would\nimply a high degree of collaboration, potential relationships and involvement in the moneylaundry circuit, extortion and affiliation methodology… this is very different from a good or\n\n\n-----\n\nneutral relationship with potential collaborations to share resources and infrastructure. I wanted\nto see with my own eyes the degree of relationship and sophistication of this ransomware\nfamily.\n\nThat said, to start the analysis I grabbed two samples that are available not only in VT but also\nin AnyRun and from there I started the analysis to figure out how it works and hunting more\nsamples for code comparison.\n\nThis was fundamental to me to construct a solid opinion and conclusions that I may share\npublicly with the community.\n\n## SunCrypt PowerShell loader analysis\n\n**SunCrypt ransomware has been spotted in many cases using PowerShell loaders for delivery**\nand deploy following the tendency marked by other groups offering ransomware service.\n\nAfter the analysis of some of these loaders, I could observe that share some similarities or\nreminds to me the structure and functionality of other loaders such a Netwalker PowerShell\n**Loader scripts. The SunCrypt loaders contains an embedded resource in plain text with two**\nexport functions that are called by the script after the compilation of the C# code, heavy\nobfuscation and a lot of junk code and useless data to harden the analysis and detection.\n\nThe obfuscation of the script includes arithmetical operations, encoding and string\n**manipulation not only for anti-analysis but probably to avoid detection by segmenting the**\nbase64 strings.\n\n\n-----\n\nSunCrypt ransomware powershell\n\n\nPoweShell Loader script obfuscation\nJumping to the analysis, the sample md5 c171bcd34151cbcd48edbce13796e0ed is a\n**PowerShell loader containing the heavy obfuscation mentioned above and contains an**\nembedded small PE file md5 479712042d7ad6600cbe2d1e5bc2fa88 coded in C# that is\ncompiled in runtime and dropped to disk.\n\nThis DLL is used to assist with Process Injection of the payload by adding a class with\nobfuscated names for the exported functions to call the functions VirtualAlloc and\n**EnumDesktopW. These are used to allocate memory and enumerate desktops associated with**\nthe process.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PowerShell script spawns an additional process instance of Powershell which is directly\ninvoked with the following arguments after the deobfuscation on the fly of the parameters:\n\nC:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -ep bypass -file\n<filepath of the script>\n\nThe main structure of script contains two heavily obfuscated payloads base64 encoded in\nmultiple strings that are subsequently deobfuscated by multiple operations and then decoded.\n\n**PowerShell uses the dropped .NET DLL to allocate memory space and copies the resultant**\nbuffers to the newly created PowerShell process. The injected bytes are consistent with\n**shellcode and a PE32 file that are injected into PowerShell’s memory address space.**\n\nTo analyze the payload the buffer containing the deobfuscated payload was dumped to disk to\ncarve the bytes.\n\nA basic triage of the shellcode showed that it contains functions related to process injection\nsuch as VirtualAlloc and VirtualProtect, likely indicating that the shellcode is assisting the\n**PowerShell script to leverage the injection of the payload.**\n\n## SunCrypt payload Analysis\n\nMost analyzed samples share the same code structure and characteristics but one of them had\na simpler structure that facilitated the analysis as the only major modification that most samples\ncontain was the addition of more obfuscation layers.\n\nIn this case I will jump directly to the analysis of the code shared between multiple samples\nfollowed by a summarisation and conclusion.\n\nFrom the PowerShell loader md5 c171bcd34151cbcd48edbce13796e0ed, the payload md5\n**0a0882b8da225406cc838991b5f67d11 was dumped and the bytes carved for analysis. This**\nPE file is consistent with an executable file likely to be coded in C and contains capabilities to\n**encrypt the filesystem, delete backups and to gather and exfiltrate user and host**\n**information.**\n\nOne of the first noticeable difference of the sample md5\n**0a0882b8da225406cc838991b5f67d11 is that it does not contain commandline arguments**\nunlike other analyzed samples like md5 3d756f9715a65def4a302f5008b03809 (payload\ncarved from the PowerShell loader with MD5 ) which contains multiple arguments .\n\nMost samples contain these command line arguments just like the one I just mentioned above\nthat are intended to modify the behaviour of the ransomware. One of the key characteristics of\n**SunCrypt is that contain an embedded configuration that is likely to be inserted and then**\nencoded by the builder.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese command line arguments seen for example in md5\n**0a0882b8da225406cc838991b5f67d11 that are expected share some similarities with the**\nones seen in other malware like Maze ransomware.\n\n**SunCrypt commandline arguments are:**\n\nThe triaged samples that expect command line arguments contain obfuscated parameters and\n**SunCrypt uses FNV hashing to obfuscate these parameters.**\n\n\n-----\n\nSunCrypt arguments flow\n\n\nIDA flow with each hash value and parameter\n**FNV () is a non-cryptographic hash function created by Glenn Fowler, Landon Curt Noll,**\n**and Kiem-Phong Vo. FNV functions contains two primary operations: XOR and**\n**multiplication. These can be spotted also by identifying the hash values for FNV Prime**\n(0x01000193) and the FNV offset basis (0x811c9dc5).\n\nIn this case the identified version that SunCrypt is using is FNV-1a hashing.\n\n\n-----\n\nSunCrypt arguments flow\n\n\nAbove the FNV hashing can be observed to obfuscate the commandline arguments, however\nthe value for “-noreport” is not hashed.\nThe next step the ransomware takes is to decode the configuration.\n\nThis configuration added and encoded by the builder contains the following parameters:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe whole section containing the configuration is decoded in multiple steps to save some of its\nvalues for its use in different routines, however the whole configuration is decoded by multiple\nloops that decode the data with a single-byte xor key 0x11.\n\n\nSunCrypt ransom note decoded\n\n\nDecoded data containing the HTML code for the ransom note.\nOne of the most noticeable things on the ransom note is that is written in multiple languages\nincluding Spanish(Latin American Spanish), German, French and English. This note contains\nan hardcoded identifier in hex format that is intended to be used to start negotiating the\npayment of the ransom along with the TOR Hidden Service URL where SunCrypt hosts its\nwebpage and Shaming list containing the victim names, proofs and data dumps.\n\n\n-----\n\nSunCrypt ransom note\n\n\nSunCrypt ransom note\nAfter the initial analysis of the configuration its data showed that both the offset of the ransom\nnote containing the individual key in hex format and other values that are used later are not\n**generated on the fly indicating that they are likely to be added by the builder during the**\nconstruction process.\n\nOne of the decoded details is a string in hex format that is re-encoded at a later stage and sent\nwithin the POST data that is likely to be an implant identifier for the attackers.\n\nThe fact that all the data is precomputed or hardcoded is not always typical in ransomware and\npopped up some questions in my head about the crypto used that I had to figure out later.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the C2 are decoded the malware looks for multiple addresses in order to save them for its\nuse later or just continues if only one is used.\n\nThe image below shows that after the configuration decoding and extraction, the next step\ntaken by SunCrypt is a quick system check to delete the Shadow Copy Volumes. Microsoft’s\nshadow copy technology allows Windows systems to create snapshots-backups of files and\nvolumes. This step ensures no possible recovery.\n\n\nSunCrypt ransomware configuration\n\n\nAfter decoding the embedded configuration, it saves the C2 addresses for its use\nIn most samples all the data such a function names, DLL names and other data are\ndynamically loaded and obfuscated using xor, sub or add operations with random values likely\nto be inserted by the builder combined with the use of StackStrings for anti-analysis and\n\n\n-----\n\n**evasion.**\n\nThe function in charge of deleting the Shadow Copy Volumes works in the same way and all\nits steps are obfuscated. SunCrypt retrieves the system version to look for its architecture to\nhandle this via WMI query executing the query “select * from Win32_ShadowCopy” to then\ndelete all the available volumes.\n\n\nSunCrypt shadowcopy deletion\n\n\nobfuscated flow to decode strings used to retrieve system architecture and to handle the task\nvia WMI\nOne of the most interesting things I noticed is the fact that so far most samples create a mutex\nbut not all of them. In this case, the below screenshot of the sample\n**3d756f9715a65def4a302f5008b03809 creates it using this hex string that was mentioned**\n\n\n-----\n\nabove and that is decoded during the configuration extraction.\n\n\nSunCrypt pulls system version and create mutex\n\n\nAfter the config decoding, gets the System Version and creates the mutex\nOnce SunCrypt deletes the Shadow Volumes, it scans for available drives following the\nkeyboard scheme from Q: to M:. In the case of the sample md5\n**0a0882b8da225406cc838991b5f67d11 it directly contains the hardcoded volume letters**\ninstead of using other techniques to harden detection such a incrementing loops. However\nmost samples like md5 3d756f9715a65def4a302f5008b03809 contains a different technique\nusing FNV-hashing again to obfuscate this phase, indicating that the developer team modified\nthis to make its detection more complicated.\n\n\n-----\n\nSunCrypt drive scanning\n\n\nIn most samples, drive scanning phase is obfuscated using FNV hashing, funnily enough,\ncontains the strings.\n\n## File encryption and Crypto walkthrough\n\n**SunCrypt uses a particular way to encrypt the filesystem and this is somehow reflected in their**\nadvertisement where they specify that SunCrypt **uses a completely independent**\n**cryptography from the system API. Well, this is true and stepping through the crypto made it**\ncomplicated as there’s only a few visible calls and it does completely rely on itself instead of the\n**Windows CryptoAPI to generate the keys because the implementation is almost completely**\nmanual.\n\nAnother interesting feature observed during the crypto walkthrough is that skips files that are\n**empty or less the 512 bytes size to skip potential garbage files. The Crypto is basically**\nidentical in all the samples and it consists on a first loop to scan all the directories ensuring the\ndrive C: is present and is encrypted. However SunCrypt scans all the available network drives\nsuch as Windows SMB File Shares in order to encrypted them if they are connected and\navailable.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware in most cases contains two lists:\n\nof directories: contains a list of directories that skips from the encryption process to\nensure its recovery. These directories are: “”, “ ”, “”, “”, “”.\nof file extensions: A huge list of file extensions are used to ensure only vital files are\nmaintained intact.\n\n\nSunCrypt file extension check via FNV\n\n\nnote again the use of FNV hashing and the FNV prime hash above. The number 13:19:00\ncorresponds to the end of the array containing the file extensions.\nThese two arrays of lists are used with the FNV hashing technique again to ensure\nobfuscation, however md5 0a0882b8da225406cc838991b5f67d11 again saves the day\ncontaining all this information in plain text. The directories and file extensions don’t change\n\n\n-----\n\nbetween samples and versions.\n\nAnother file extension that is skipped is if the filename contains\n“YOUR_FILES_ARE_ENCRYPTED.HTML” which is used for the ransom note to ensure its\ndelivery to the victim, however there is a problem that is not resolved.\n\nIf the ransomware is executed twice, it would re-encrypt the filesystem as the file extension of\n**the encrypted files is generated on the fly. This embarrassing scenario indicates that if a**\nprevious instance of SunCrypt encrypts the filesystem, another execution would re-encrypt all\nthe encrypted files, making this very hard to solve.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the directory is picked for encryption SunCrypt decodes the DLL name **advapi32.dll**\nand a function to be loaded and used. The malware executes a GetProcAddress to use the\nfunction SystemFunction036(RtlGenRandom), this will be our RNG to generate 32 random\n**bytes without using CryptGenRandom function call or an insecure generator.**\n\n\nSunCrypt RNG\n\n\nAfter decoding the DLL and the function that will be called, SunCrypt uses SystemFunction036\nto create 32 byte keys.\nThis 32-byte buffer is validated after it’s generation to create a secure private key for the\n**Elliptic Curve algorithm Curve. Curve25519 is a Diffie-Hellman function suitable for a wide**\nvariety of applications and is used by many software applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Curve25519 works as follows according to the official documentation:** _given a user s,_\n_computes the Given the user’s and another, computes a . This secret can then be used to_\n_authenticate and ”._\n\nAfter the generation of this private session key, SunCrypt jumps to the curve **function to**\ncompute its session public key where this session private key is passed to the function\nalong with a basepoint constant of 9 followed by all zeros. This session public key will be\n**converted to hex format and used as file extension for the encrypted file to allow the**\n**recovery as each time a file is encrypted the session private key is destroyed. Next step of**\n**SunCrypt is to load its embedded Curve25519 public key to compute a shared secret.**\n\nThe analyzed sample md5 0a0882b8da225406cc838991b5f67d11 contains the following\npublic key in hex format:\n\n_c75d83161c3768477c859b15cfe3f6c7bf707976bfed511af7015d04f7066558_\n\nThe other analyzed sample used in the blog to compare SunCrypt versions\n(MD5:3d756f9715a65def4a302f5008b03809) containing the improvement and obfuscation\nshared with most of the observed SunCrypt samples contains the public key:\n_695c567285a5b331dcf1d61bb291ce850e92c57111678fe79a2e5c2e399c9310_\n\nThe implementation of Curve25519 looks manual and it’s likely to be using code from any of\nthe multiple open source implementation of Curve25519,\n\nThe shared secret is computed by calling the curve function and passing the attacker’s\n**public key, the generated private key and the basepoint as parameters. This shared secret**\nis used by another algorithm to encrypt the file, allowing its recovery with the attacker’s\n**Curve25519 private key hosted in the SunCrypt C2 servers and the session public key that is**\nthe file extension of each file.\n\nSummarising, each time a file is selected for encryption after the aforementioned checks,\n**SunCrypt creates Curve25519 session keys, stores each public key as file extension and**\n**destroys the session private key.**\n\n\n-----\n\nSunCrypt key generation\n\n\nsession public key is formatted and used as extension, then the shared key is computed with\nthe session private key and the attacker’s public key\nOnce the session keys are created and the shared key is computed for a given file, the\n**required data is sent via completion I/O port to the encryption thread which takes a pointer**\nto the file and its new generated extension. To handle encryption threading, SunCrypt gets the\n**number of processors and the maximum number of available threads that the operating**\nsystem can allow to process I/O completion packets for I/O completion port.\n\nThis provide an efficient threading for multiple asynchronous I/O requests for encryption.\nAgain, this was referenced in their forum ad.\n\n\n-----\n\nSunCrypt asynchronous multithreading\n\n\nCreateIOCompletionPort initialisation\nFor the file encryption SunCrypt uses a very fast and secure algorithm which in this case is\n**ChaCha. The implementation of ChaCha20 stream cipher is also manual and makes sense its**\nuse, because it does not rely on statically linked libraries or the CryptoAPI avoiding\nsuspicious calls and it’s very fast and secure. This cipher is used by other popular ransomware\nlike Maze. Again another similarity.\n\nThe actual file encryption happens after the above steps. The malware calls ReadFile function\nto get the content of the file and pushes a pointer to the buffer with the file content, the file\n**extension and the computed shared key for that file to ChaCha20 function that encrypts the**\nfile partially. This limitation is intended to speed up a bit more the encryption as is enough to\nmake the file useless.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter reading the file, the flow redirects the data containing the computed shared key and the\nfile to the ChaCha20 encryption routine\n\n## C2 communications\n\n**SunCrypt contains a network module unlike many other ransomware and in my opinion this is**\nalso influenced by Maze. The ransomware uses the IP addresses that are embedded in the\nconfiguration and attempts to push different information from the compromised host.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the observed IP addresses in SunCrypt are in many cases consistent with\nprevious associated Maze infrastructure’s subnet, reinforcing the idea of some sort of\ncollaboration between ransomware dev groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SunCrypt gathers information from the Windows system gathering the Minor Version, Major**\n**Version and Buildnumber of the compromised system. The system survey also consists of**\ngathering username and hostname information by calling GetUserNameA and\n**GetComputerA functions.**\n\n\nSunCrypt information gathering\n\n\nThe network module gathers the information and creates a buffer that is later encoded with a\nhardcoded key\nIn the above image can be observed the information mentioned plus the fact of the use of this\noffset containing the bytes used for the mutex or implant id.\n\nOne of the things that raised my attention is that this step is identical between versions,\nmeaning that these bytes are always used and intended to be sent in the network traffic,\nhowever, they are also used as mutex if the sample generates one, which is not always the\n\n\n-----\n\ncase. That s why I m naming it implant-id and mutex at the same time. Is some sort of identifier\nthat they may find useful.\n\nAdditionally, SunCrypt adds to this information (Versions and implant/mutex) the victim’s\ninformation as mentioned above.\n\nThe network buffer contains the following example structure:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe above mentioned bytes are likely to be related to a manually implemented library used by\nthe network routine to create the network buffer, however the library was not identified. Below\nan example of the network buffer prior to it’s encoding using an hardcoded single-byte xor key\n0x11.\n\nAfterwards the C2 address that was stored during the configuration decoding is loaded and\npushed into the stack to send all this information to the routine handling the HTTP request.\n\n\n-----\n\nSunCrypt network buffer\n\n\nSunCrypt network buffer entering the encoding loop stage\nBelow an example of what SunCrypt HTTP traffic looks like in WireShark, containing the\nencoded data in the POST data.\n\n\n-----\n\nSunCrypt network traffic\n\n\nSunCrypt network traffic\nAnother interesting detail that was mentioned before was the use of C2 infrastructure\nassociated to the Maze team, reinforcing the idea of collaboration between ransomware teams\nwhich may indicate not only an stable relationship between threat actors but also a potential\ncooperation to share infrastructure, resources and techniques.\n\n## Summary\n\nAfter the analysis of the samples, can be appreciated some but not a lot of evolution and\nchanges. So far only one sample was found using clear-text strings\n(md5:0a0882b8da225406cc838991b5f67d11) which contains vital strings such as the user\n\n-----\n\nagent and the drive letter whereas the rest of the identified samples contains some of the\nfollowing modifications:\n\nUse of and hiding all the relevant data\nimplementation\n\nFrom all the observed samples, most of them has been spotted using PowerShell as initial\nvector to obfuscate the payload and to load the binary into memory and “honours” all the\nfunctionalities that the developer team announce in their forum post like the non-use of the\n**CryptoAPI for file encryption and thread features. By looking at the PowerShell loaders I**\npersonally found it similar to Netwalker PowerShell loaders, which makes me think that the\n**SunCrypt team got some inspiration from them.**\n\n**SunCrypt contains multiple manual implementations on the source code to avoid detections**\nbut despite the notable differences, it can be noticed that the team got a lot of inspiration from\n**Maze. SunCrypt copied part of its cryptoscheme like the use of ChaCha20 stream-cipher and**\n**modified its session key implementation by replacing RSA for the Curve25519 algorithm**\nprobably for two main reasons:\n\nKey generation is way and uses than, which allows a very fast key generation and\noperation.\n. This allows to and . could be implemented manually, but I guess they considered that it\nwasn’t probably worth.\n\nAdditionally, to increase the encryption speed the SunCrypt team sends file data via\n**completion I/O port to the encryption thread.**\n\nOverall I have to say SunCrypt is not a very sophisticated ransomware unlike some of its\ncompetitors like Maze, Egregor, Ragnar or Wastedlocker and the main motivation I have to\nsay this, is due to the evolution, techniques, language(C over OOP like C++) and\n**obfuscation techniques point to this direction but they got a lot of inspiration to make**\nsomething similar to Maze. In fact when I saw SunCrypt for the first time I thought: “someone\n_from the team just left and started its own project(?)” but after diving into it and checking more_\nsamples I could notice that the level of sophistication and experience, tooling and techniques\nused are not the same, but I feel confident saying that they were a source of inspiration for\n**sure.**\n\nHowever, what has in common with Maze? It shares some of the command line arguments,\nthe use of a network module for data exfiltration, algorithm for file encryption and other\n**references, however the main differences with Maze are:**\n\n\n-----\n\nIt will be interesting to keep an eye on this malware to see its evolution and modifications to\nsurvive as the RaaS model service is a fast paced ecosystem full of very capable\ncompetitors.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n Samples\n\n C2\n\n\n-----",
