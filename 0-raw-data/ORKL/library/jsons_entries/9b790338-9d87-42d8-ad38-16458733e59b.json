Within his testimony, Adam will speak\npublicly for the first time about a Russia-nexus state-sponsored actor that CrowdStrike\nIntelligence tracks as EMBER BEAR.\n\nEMBER BEAR (aka UAC-0056, Lorec53, Lorec Bear, Bleeding Bear, Saint Bear) is an\nadversary group that has operated against government and military organizations in eastern\nEurope since early 2021, likely to collect intelligence from target networks. EMBER BEAR\n\n\n-----\n\nappears primarily motivated to weaponize the access and data obtained during their\nintrusions to support information operations (IO) aimed at creating public mistrust in\ntargeted institutions and degrading government ability to counter Russian cyber operations.\n\nMeet the Adversary: EMBER BEAR\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence attributes destructive activity against Ukrainian networks using the\n[WhisperGate wiper to EMBER BEAR, assessed at moderate confidence. Additionally,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/technical-analysis-of-whispergate-malware/)\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with low confidence that data obtained through EMBER\nBEAR operations are used to support data leak operations conducted by multiple attribution\nfronts.\n\nWhile other Russia-state nexus adversaries have also been implicated in the dissemination\n[of stolen data for similar motivations — particularly FANCY BEAR and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-fancy-bear/) [VOODOO BEAR,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-january-voodoo-bear/)\nboth operated by Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian\nFederation (GRU) — EMBER BEAR does not present known links with previously tracked\nadversaries. EMBER BEAR is not currently attributed to a specific Russian organization,\nalthough the adversary’s target profile, assessed intent, and their technical tactics,\ntechniques and procedures (TTPs) are consistent with other GRU cyber operations.\n\n**CrowdStrike Intelligence Confidence Descriptions**\n\n**High Confidence – Judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple**\nsources. High confidence in the quality and quantity of source information supporting a\njudgment does not imply that that assessment is an absolute certainty or fact. The judgment\nstill has a marginal probability of being inaccurate.\n\n**Moderate Confidence – Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced and**\nplausible, but not of sufficient quantity or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level\nof confidence. This level of confidence is used to express that judgments carry an increased\nprobability of being incorrect until more information is available or corroborated.\n\n**Low Confidence – Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain,**\nthe information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated enough to make solid analytic\ninferences, or the reliability of the source is untested. Further information is needed for\ncorroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_To watch Adam Meyers’ CHS testimony, visit the_ _Committee on Homeland Security_\n_website._\n_[Learn how to incorporate intelligence on dangerous threat actors into your security](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/threat-actor/)_\n_strategy by visiting the_ _[CrowdStrike Falcon X™ product page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Request a free_ _[CrowdStrike Intelligence threat briefing and learn how to stop](https://go.crowdstrike.com/threat-intelligence-briefing.html?utm_campaign=threatintelligence&utm_content=us&utm_medium=sem&utm_source=goog&utm_term=cyber%20threat%20intelligence&_bt=465670942471&_bk=cyber%20threat%20intelligence&_bm=e&_bn=g&_bg=108022039334&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqsSdwZ-j7AIV9R6tBh23rQErEAAYASAAEgKc8fD_BwE&_ga=2.145914102.359113952.1606756854-1198667695.1606243810)_\n_adversaries targeting your organization._\n_[Learn more about the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the product webpage.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)_\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ to see for yourself how](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_true next-gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\nRelated Content\n\nCrowdStrike Delivers Adversary-Focused, Platform Approach to CNAPP and Cloud Security\n\n\n-----\n\nCrowdStrike “Dominates” in Endpoint Detection and Response\n\n\n-----\n\nCrowdStrike Achieves 100% Prevention in Recent MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluation Emulating\nRussia-based Threat Groups\n\n\n-----",
