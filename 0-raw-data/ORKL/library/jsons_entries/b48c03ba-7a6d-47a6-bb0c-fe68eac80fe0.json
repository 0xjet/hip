Amadey Bot, a malware that was first discovered in 2018, is capable of stealing\ninformation and installing additional malware by receiving commands from the attacker. Like\nother malware strains, it is being sold in illegal forums and still being used by various\nattackers.\n\nIt was used in the past to install ransomware by attackers of GandCrab or to install\nFlawedAmmyy by the TA505 group which is infamous for Clop ransomware. Recently, it was\ndistributed under the disguise of a popular Korean messenger app.\n\n**Amadey Bot Disguised as a Famous Korean Messenger Program Being**\n**Distributed**\n\nAmadey Bot, the malware that is used to install LockBit, is being distributed through two\nmethods: one using a malicious Word document file, and the other using an executable that\ntakes the disguise of the Word file icon.\n\n**Distribution Case 1. Malicious Word File**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following is a malicious Word document named Sia_Sim.docx. It was uploaded to\nVirusTotal. As an external Word file, it downloads a Word file that contains a malicious VBA\nmacro from the following URL when run.\n\nFigure 1. External URL\n\nThe text body contains an image that prompts the user to click “Enable Content” to enable\nthe VBA macro.\n\nFigure 2. Malicious Word file that prompts the activation of macro\nWhen the user clicks “Enable Content,” the downloaded VBA macro (the one that installs the\nmalicious LNK file) is executed. The LNK file is created in the “C:\\Users\\Public\\skem.lnk”\npathway and is executed via the following command.\n\n- rundll32 url.dll,OpenURL C:\\Users\\Public\\skeml.lnk\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Downloaded VBA macro\nThe LNK file is a downloader that runs powershell command to download and run Amadey.\n\nFigure 4. Created LNK file\n\n**Distribution Case 2. Executable Disguised as Word File**\n\nThere is also a case where the malware was found as “Resume.exe.” The e-mail used in the\nattack has not been confirmed yet, but the file was run as “Resume.exe.” It was also\ndisguised as an innocuous Word file icon and created by a compression program. Judging\nfrom its characteristics above, it appears that Amadey was installed via an e-mail\nattachment. Next is an executable collected on October 27, 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Amadey Bot disguised as innocuous Word file icon\n\n**Amadey Bot**\n\nGiven that both Amadeys above used the same C&C server and download URL, it appears\nthat the attacker has been distributing Amadey Bots in two ways. Amadey that is run through\nthe process above copies itself into the Temp directory, registers to the task scheduler and\nallows it to run even after a reboot.\n\n- “c:\\windows\\system32\\schtasks.exe” /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn rovwer.exe /tr\n“c:\\users[username]\\appdata\\local\\temp\\0d467a63d9\\rovwer.exe” /f\n\nAfterward, it connects to the C&C server, sends default information of the infected system,\nand receives commands. The blog previously introduced Amadey’s features and details,\nincluding the types of infected PC’s information the malware sends to the C&C server, and\ninfo-stealing plugins.\n\n**[Amadey Bot Being Distributed Through SmokeLoader](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/36634/)**\n\nFigure 6. Amadey’s C&C Communication\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Amadey’s login page\nAmadey receives three commands from the C&C server, and they are all commands that\ndownload and execute malware from the external source. “cc.ps1” and “dd.ps1” are LockBits\nin powershell form, and “LBB.exe” is LockBit in exe form. They are each created in directory\nnames shown in the C&C server’s response, retrospectively.\n\n– %TEMP%\\1000018041\\dd.ps1\n\n– %TEMP%\\1000019041\\cc.ps1\n\n– %TEMP%\\1000020001\\LBB.exe\n\n**LockBit 3.0**\n\nOnce the download is complete, the malware runs LockBit. The powershell files are initially\nobfuscated, and are structured to be executed after being unobfuscated in the memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Obfuscated LockBit powershell malware\nIf the file Amadey downloaded is a powershell form, the following command is used.\n\n- “c:\\windows\\system32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe” -executionpolicy\nremotesigned -file “c:\\users[username]\\appdata\\local\\temp\\1000018041\\dd.ps1”\n\nLockbits that are installed via Amadey have been distributed in Korea since 2022, and the\nteam has posted various articles that analyzed the ransomware. The recently confirmed\nversion is LockBit 3.0 which is distributed using keywords such as job application and\ncopyright. Judging from the themes, it appears that the attack is targeting companies.\n\n**LockBit Ransomware Being Distributed Using Resume and Copyright-related**\n**Emails (Posted in February 2022)**\n**LockBit Ransomware Disguised as Copyright Claim E-mail Being**\n**Distributed (Posted in June 2022)**\n**NSIS Type LockBit 3.0 Ransomware Disguised as Job Application Emails Being**\n**Distributed (Posted in September 2022)**\n**LockBit 3.0 Ransomware Distributed via Word Documents (Posted in September**\n**2022)**\n\nLockbit ransomware infects files that exist in the user’s environment, changes the desktop as\nseen below, and notifies the user. It then creates a ransom note in each folder, stating that all\ndata in the system has been encrypted and stolen, and threatening the user that the data will\nbe decrypted and leaked on the Internet if they refuse to pay money.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Desktop warped by LockBit 3.0 ransomware infection\n\nFigure 10. Ransom note of LockBit 3.0\nAs LockBit ransomware is being distributed through various methods, user caution is\nadvised. Users should update the applications and V3 they use to the latest version and\nrefrain from opening document files from unknown sources.\n\n**[File Detection]**\n\n– Downloader/DOC.External (2022.10.31.02)\n\n– Downloader/DOC.Generic (2022.10.31.02)\n\n– Trojan/LNK.Runner (2022.10.31.02)\n\n– Malware/Win.Generic.R531852 (2022.10.27.03)\n\n– Trojan/Win.Delf.R452782 (2021.11.24.02)\n\n– Ransomware/Win.LockBit.R506767 (2022.07.27.01)\n\n– Ransomware/PowerShell.Lockbit.S1945 (2022.10.29.00)\n\n**[AMSI Detection]**\n\n– Ransomware/PowerShell.Lockbit.SA1945 (2022.10.29.00)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Behavior Detection]**\n– Ransom/MDP.Decoy.M1171\n\n– Ransom/MDP.Event.M1875\n\n– Ransom/MDP.Behavior.M1946\n\n**[IOC]**\n\n**MD5**\n\n– 13b12238e3a44bcdf89a7686e7179e16: Malicious Word Document (Sia_Sim.docx)\n\n– ae59e82ddd8d9840b79bfddbe4034462: Downloaded malicious VBA macro (v5sqpe.dotm)\n\n– bf4d4f36c34461c6605b42c456fa4492: Downloader LNK (skeml.lnk)\n\n– 56c9c8f181803ece490087ebe053ef72: Amadey (1234.exe)\n\n– bf331800dbb46bb32a8ac89e4543cafa: Amadey (Resume.exe)\n\n– ad444dcdadfe5ba7901ec58be714cf57: Amadey Stealer Plugin (cred.dll)\n\n– f9ab1c6ad6e788686509d5abedfd1001: LockBit (cc.ps1)\n\n– 1690f558aa93267b8bcd14c1d5b9ce34: LockBit (dd.ps1)\n\n– 5e54923e6dc9508ae25fb6148d5b2e55: LockBit (LBB.exe)\n\n**C&C and Download**\n\n– hxxp://188.34.187[.]110/v5sqpe.dotm: External URL\n\n– hxxp://188.34.187[.]110/1234.exe: Amadey Download URL\n\n– hxxp://62.204.41[.]25/3g4mn5s/index.php : Amadey C&C\n\n– hxxp://62.204.41[.]25/3g4mn5s/Plugins/cred.dll : Amadey Stealer Plugin Download\n\n– hxxp://188.34.187[.]110/dd.ps1 : LockBit\n\n– hxxp://188.34.187[.]110/cc.ps1 : LockBit\n\n– hxxp://188.34.187[.]110/LBB.exe : LockBit\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information-en/)\n\n[Tagged as:Amadey,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/amadey-en/) [LockBit,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/lockbit/) [Ransomware](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/ransomware-en/)\n\n\n-----",
