In a statement, the DOJ said a Chinese state-owned aerospace company was\nsimultaneously working to develop a comparable engine.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat posed by Chinese government-sponsored hacking activity is real and relentless,\nFBI Special Agent in Charge John Brown of San Diego said in a statement. “Today, the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of our private sector, international and\nU.S. government partners, is sending a strong message to the Chinese government and\nother foreign governments involved in hacking activities.”\n\nThe MSS officers involved were identified as Zha Rong, a division director in the Jiangsu\nProvince regional department (JSSD), and Chai Meng, a JSSD section chief.\n\nAt the direction of the MSS officers, the hackers allegedly infiltrated a number of U.S.\naerospace companies, including California-based Capstone Turbine, among others in\nArizona, Massachusetts, and Oregon, the DOJ said. The officers are also said to have\nrecruited at least two Chinese employees of a French aerospace manufacturer—insiders\nwho allegedly aided the conspiracy by, among other criminal acts, installing the remote\naccess trojan Sakula onto company computers.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission\n\nSave $70\n\nApple AirPods Max\n\n**Experience Next-Level Sound**\nSpatial audio with dynamic head tracking provides theater-like sound that surrounds you\n\nSakula was previously deployed by Deep Panda, a Chinese nation-state threat group,\n[according to cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. Deep Panda is a leading suspect in the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/ironman-deep-panda-uses-sakula-malware-target-organizations-multiple-sectors/)\ncyberattack on the U.S. government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), revealed in\nJune 2015, which compromised the data of 4 million current and former federal employees.\nSakula was also used in the 2015 Anthem data breach, which involved the potential theft of\nroughly 80 million individuals’ personal medical records.\n\nThe indictment includes intercepted communications between MSS spies and one of the\ninsiders, including repeated mentions of “the horse,” an alleged reference to the Sakula\nmalware. The hackers are also said to have used IsSpace, a trojan previously used in\nattacks attributed to DragonOK, a hacking group behind attacks on tech companies in Japan\n[and Taiwan, according to cybersecurity firm FireEye.](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/wp-operation-quantum-entanglement.pdf)\n\nThe charges against the MSS officers follow the arrest in Belgium earlier this month of\nYanjun Xu, an alleged Chinese spy accused of likewise targeting multiple U.S. aerospace\ncompanies. Xu was extradited to the United States on September 9 and will stand trial for\nallegedly conducting economic espionage and attempting to steal trade secrets.\n\n[TechPrivacy and Security](https://gizmodo.com/tech)\n\n\n-----",
