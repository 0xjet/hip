According to anonymous\nUS officials speaking to the Washington Post, the worm was developed during the\nadministration of George W. Bush to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program with what would\nseem like a long series of unfortunate accidents.\n[Stuxnet has three modules: a worm that executes all routines related to the main payload of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm)\nthe attack; a [link file that automatically executes the propagated copies of the worm; and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_shortcut)\na [rootkit component responsible for hiding all malicious files and processes, preventing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit)\ndetection of the presence of Stuxnet.\n\nStuxnet is typically introduced to the target environment via an infected [USB flash drive.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive)\nThe worm then propagates across the network, scanning for Siemens Step7 software on\ncomputers controlling a PLC. In the absence of either criterion, Stuxnet becomes dormant\ninside the computer. If both the conditions are fulfilled, Stuxnet introduces the infected\nrootkit onto the PLC and Step7 software, modifying the codes and giving unexpected\ncommands to the PLC while returning a loop of normal operations system values feedback\nto the users.\n\n**Addeddate**\n2015-09-12 11:24:48\n\n**Identifier**\nStuxnet\n\n**Identifier-ark**\nark:/13960/t3hx5022b\n\n**Scanner**\nInternet Archive HTML5 Uploader 1.6.3\n\n\nReviews\nThere are no reviews yet.
