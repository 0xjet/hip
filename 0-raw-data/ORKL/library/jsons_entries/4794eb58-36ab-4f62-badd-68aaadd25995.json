Its control depends\nonly on an email exchange that can originate from any address the attacker chooses.\n\nSecurity researchers from ESET analyzed the functionality of the utility and managed to\nlearn how it can exfiltrate data without triggering the alarm.\n\nThe Turla group counts on this backdoor since at least 2013 and has developed it from a\nbasic utility that only dumped email content to a tool that can execute PowerShell\n[commands with the help of Empire PSInject open-source kit.](https://github.com/EmpireProject/PSInject)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn its most recent reiterations, the backdoor is a standalone DLL (dynamic link library) that\ncan install itself and interact with Outlook and The Bat! email clients. It can do this\nregardless of its location on the disk.\n\nFor persistence, Turla developers use COM object hijacking - a common, but effective\ntechnique they’re well versed in. The method allows the malicious DLL to load each time\nOutlook loads the COM object. The researchers noticed that this happens when the email\nclient starts.\n\nStealth is achieved by relying on the legitimate Messaging Application Programming\nInterface (MAPI) to interact with Outlook and get access to the target’s inboxes.\n\nThe researchers say that the operator uses the email transport layer to deliver specially\ncrafted PDF documents containing commands for data exfiltration or for downloading\nadditional files. Information is extracted in the same way, by generating a PDF with the data\ndemanded by the attacker, like outgoing emails and message metadata.\n\n\n-----\n\n“From the PDF documents, the backdoor is able to recover what attackers call a container\nin the logs. This is a binary blob with a special format that contains encrypted commands for\n[the backdoor,” ESET analysts explain in a report released today.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Eset-Turla-Outlook-Backdoor.pdf)\n\n“Technically, the attachment does not have to be a valid PDF document. The only\nrequirement is that it includes a container in the right format.”\n\nTo hide the email exchanges from the user, the backdoor deletes the messages sent to or\nreceived from the attacker. New email notifications may appear for a few seconds, but the\nmessage body is not shown to the user, which could pass as a glitch in the client software.\n\nAlthough they did not get a PDF sample with commands for the backdoor, the researchers\nwere able to create such a document. Once sent to an Outlook inbox controlled by the\nmalware, it recognized the directions and launched the Calculator app in Windows.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe complexity of the Outlook backdoor component is also visible in its encryption\nalgorithm. Just like other tools bearing the Turla signature, the backdoor uses a less\ncommon algorithm, which suffered customizations from the developer.\n\nIt employs MISTY1 symmetric encryption, created by Mitsubishi Electric in 1995. To the\noriginal implementation, Turla added two XOR operations, changed the key generation\nmethod. They also shuffled the values in the s7 and s9 non-linear look-up tables, causing\nall tools that recognize cryptographic algorithms based on the s-table values to break.\n\nWith no command and control server to take down, a modus operandi that can pass as\nlegitimate activity to network security components, and modifications to standard functions,\nTurla’s Outlook backdoor proves difficult to fight.\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
