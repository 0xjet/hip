Review\n\n#### Delta Elektronics highly likely supported by the Russian government and a direct threat to energy sector supply chain operations\nThe team asserts with moderate confidence that Delta Elektronics (DE) is likely a front company directly associated with\nEnergetic Bear (Dragonfly), and the equipment purchased from DE is vulnerable to supply chain threats due to malware\nembedded in the Taiwanese Delta Electronics (T-DE) programmable logic controller (PLC) software (unbeknownst to TDE). T-DE is not aware of the infections allowing customers to download and install infected PLC software for the\ninitial purposes of cyber espionage. Long term intentions include possible physical sabotage operations. The PLCs\nappear to be genuine production parts with malware introduced post production. Verification of Oleg Vladimirovich\nStrekozovs identity is incomplete; the name is likely fictitious and probably state-sponsored. Evidence that suggests this\noutcome:\nMalware Targets SCADA Devices\n\n  - TTPs are like Dragonfly or Energetic Bear (B2)\n\n  - Targeting SCADA devices is consistent with espionage practices (B2)\n\n`o` Provides hackers a foothold into US critical infrastructure\nDelta Website in Taiwan\n\n  - A copycat website in Russia is suspicious and consistent with masquerade techniques (C3)\n\n  - A legitimate Russian business would not conduct themselves in such a way (C2)\n\n  - Delta Electronics, based out of Taiwan and has no records of any locations in St. Petersburg (B2)\nMany Russian Domains with Delta Names\n\n  - A legitimate business would not want to have such a\ndisorganized web presence (C2)\n\n`o` 20+ companies founded under this name cover various\nmarket sectors and verticals (B2)\n\n  - Some of the websites are known to host a variety of malware\n(B2)\n\n`o` Multiple IP’s registered by Oleg and flagged as\nmalicious (B2)\n\n  - A registration certificate exists on delta-electronics.info supporting possible state-sponsorship (C3)\nOther Information\n\n  - A bill of lading with the name “Oleg Vladimirovich Strekozov” (F3)\n◦ Strekozov coincidentally translates ‘Dragonfly’ as used by Symantec in early malware discoveries (B2)\n\n  - Physical locations for DE appear to be vacant lots, apartment buildings, and non-SCADA businesses (C3)\n◦ Matrix Group LLC (DE owner) physical\nlocation secured with gates, fences,\nkeypad access devices, and security\ncameras (C2)\n\n       - The Matrix Group LLC lists over 260\ndomain names of varying\nlegitimacy (B2)\n◦ The location of NPO Stoik, a business\nnamed in document metadata found\non Delta Elektronics websites, is in\nMoscow, and, along with several other\nassociated addresses and likely near\nbuildings used by Russian intelligence\nagencies (F3)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Yuri Chekunov, Director at a government organization in Khanti-Mansi district owns firms that buy and sell\nSCADA equipment (C3)\n◦ Yuri’s firms have direct relationships with DE (B2)\n◦ Mr. Chekunov approves contracts for the government that his company’s bid on (F3)\n◦ It is likely that Mr. Chekunov is part of the Russian oligarchy (F3)\n\nThe team recommends placing a company service call to evaluate if anyone tampered with the suspected hardware. Team\n1 recommends reducing production levels to minimize safety issues or equipment damage. Manual inspection of\npurchased DE equipment required.\n\nWe recommend the following:\n\n  - A complete scan, reverse engineering, and analysis of the software provided in a sandbox environment\n\n  - Identification of other SCADA companies providing downloadable PLC software\n\n`o` Review and analysis of this software\n\n  - Engagement with T-DE to determine extent of the infections\n\n`o` Examine web logs to determine downloads by clients\n`o` Incident declaration and full examination of external hacking and insider threats\n\n  - Engagement with authorities to identify possible US infections and exploitation\n\nIntelligence gaps include:\n\n  - Whether other malware campaigns intersect with this activity\n\n  - Whether any Chinese organization or agency stands to financially gain from this activity\n\n  - If any data has been exfiltrated due to the malware\n\n  - The scope of malware infections at other SCADA companies\n\n  - Tangible evidence tying DE to the malware on T-DE websites\n\n**Alternative Analysis**\n\nWe assess with low confidence that\nDelta Elektronics is a third-party\norganization sponsored by the\nRussian government or is a false flag\noperations posing as a supplier to\nlegitimate electronic company\nhardware inserting malware into\nforeign industrial supply chains for\nespionage purposes. An equally\nplausible assessment (low\nconfidence) is that DE is a front\ncompany used by criminals to either\nsell counterfeit equipment or to\nconduct a fraudulent “middle man”\noperation to take a cut of the profit\nfrom the sale of legitimate\nequipment.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Narrative Overview – Supporting Information\nThe behavior analysis topic will be used to discuss a combined case studies related to SCADA systems and the sale of\nSCADA hardware and associated software that could be spiked (loaded with malware). The case study would focus on\npotential Russian activities in this area, their creation of fake companies, their duplication of websites and website content\nto make them look legitimate, and the tracking of the potential people behind this to other malicious cyber activities.\n\n_“A new type of war has emerged, in which armed warfare has given up its decisive place in the achievement of the_\n_military and political objectives of war to another kind of warfare - information warfare.”_\n\nInfiltrating systems in the deployment phase is attractive as this does not require the devices themselves to be vulnerable.\nAs SCADA systems generally are very poorly maintained, with patch penetrations bordering towards 0% when we have\nbeen able to observe penetration on the market. The intentions apart from directly affecting those systems as means in a\nconflict, they are often deployed on networks from where they can reach other internal resources. Being able to infect\ndevices which are likely to spend 10 to 20 years on a network largely unmaintained is one of the most stable sources of\npersistence a threat actor can obtain. This means the devices not only provide means of controlling critical infrastructure\nin other nations, but it is also a means of obtaining access to other internal resources for an extended period.\n\nTake for example the BlackEnergy attacks against Ukrainian SCADA assets. Assumed Russian cyber adversaries disrupted\npower grid operations causing blackouts for over 225,000 customers in Ukraine. The attack was highly complex using a\nmethodical approach to planning, direction, intelligence collection, resource utilization, mission management, expert\nskills, highly malicious payloads, and combinations of manual, semi, continuous levels of automation.\n\nTargeted intellection collection started months before the attack execution. Run like a well-managed special forces\noperation, the adversaries clandestinely created persistent access footholds to multiple industrial networks, identified\nUkrainian energy-related targets, before carrying out an integrated, complex, and process-driven operation that disrupted\nelectricity distribution and destroyed various systems, flooded call centers, distorted internal systems, and impeded\nincident response. Based upon system design and intelligence on the target, malware deployed by the adversaries\nexploited weaknesses in access protocols to gain administrative access to critical systems. Once inside, adversaries created\nvalid administrative accounts enabling lateral movement across trusted systems. The adversaries achieved their goals by\nshutting down power distribution to key functions of the grid.\n\nAnother possible aspect of exploiting SCADA systems starts at the physical level. Russian corporations are mimicking global\norganizations that research and development, design, manufacture, and sale of electronic control systems, industrial\nautomation products, digital display products, communication products, consumer electronics products, energy-saving\nlighting application, and energy technology (DLELY Key Statistics - Delta Electronics Inc., 2017) services. One such\norganization is Delta Electronics from Taiwan.\n\nThe accelerating trends of supply chain globalization and outsourced manufacturing and distribution have combined to\nincrease the pace of change, complexity, and risk for brand owners. These trends have created a fundamental shift in the\nway companies of all sizes plan, source, make, and deliver their goods and services. The Russian focus to actively target\nvarious phases of the supply chain makes for malware installation to be viewed as normal network activity. An activity\nthat is deemed normal upon installation of the hardware and software in question.\n\nSupply chains are difficult to secure; they create a risk that is hard to identify, complicated to quantify and costly to\naddress. A compromise anywhere in the supply chain can have just as much impact on your organization, and its\nreputation, as one from within the organization. There is great necessity to track everything that is happening in the supply\nchain as even the smallest supplier, or the slightest hiccup can have a dangerous impact on your business.\n\nThe cyber security industry has already seen USB-devices shipped with malware straight out of the factory, just as we have\nseen CD's from magazines with malware during the 90's. Affecting devices in the production line is of course equally\ntempting to actors from Russia as it is for the NSA. A state actor focusing on monitoring citizens has different requirements\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom a nation building its cyber arms arsenal. Where the NSA had a focus on networking equipment and traffic monitoring,\nthis makes the same degree of sense from a cyber arms perspective.\n\nRussian methods of information influence and information operations include network operations alongside disciplines\nsuch as psychological operations, strategic communications, Influence, along with “intelligence, counterintelligence,\nmaskirovka, disinformation, electronic warfare, debilitation of communications, degradation of navigation support,\npsychological pressure, and destruction of enemy computer capabilities. Taken together, this forms a whole of systems,\nmethods, and tasks to influence the perception and behavior of the enemy, population, and international community on\nall levels.\n\nOne fundamental distinction between Russian and Western approaches to information activities is the categorization of\ncomputer network operations and other activities in cyberspace.\n\n“Cyber” as a separate function or domain is not a Russian concept. The delineation of activities in the cyber domain from\nother activities processing, attacking, disrupting or stealing information is seen as artificial in Russian thinking. In this\ncontext, “Distributed denial of services attacks (DDoS), advanced [cyber] exploitation techniques and Russia Today\ntelevision are all related tools of information warfare.\n\nA key concept often lost on the West is Russia’s willingness to give primacy to non-kinetic operations, especially\ninformation warfare. The Western assumption has been that subversion, deception, and the like are all ‘force multipliers’\nto the combat arms, not forces in their own right. At present, though, Russia is clearly seeing the kinetic and the nonkinetic as interchangeable and mutually supporting.\n\nRussia's use of the tools of information pressure - a key theme of the latest statements by the representatives of the state\nadministration sector in Ukraine. At the same time, Russia denies any involvement in the facts of information aggression:\nhacking databases, network services and the use of information technology for propaganda purposes.\n\nThe Russian targeting of various phases of the SCADA supply chain represents information-technology warfare (to affect\ntechnical systems which receive, collect, process and transmit information), which is conducted during wars and armed\nconflicts. The behaviors exhibited by the perpetrators is not usually targeted. Examining Russian activities within the\nSCADA supply chain requires analysis focused on users, user accounts, user identities, and the sources of their activities.\n\nOpenly selling to various Western, Asian, and Middle Eastern energy organizations who purchase from these known\ncompanies is a method to infiltrate critical infrastructures in target organizations globally. The potential for use later is\npart of an overall sea, air, land, cyber integrated strategy of hybrid warfare.\n\nThis is but one aspect of hybrid warfare attacks against the energy sector. The use of malicious code such as BlackEnergy\nserves as a reminder of the combined efforts by adversaries in using access to hardware in the supply chain and external\ninfiltration of this hardware without attribution. Since the December 2015 attack against Ukraine’s power grid, the Ukraine\nhas experienced 6,500 cyber hacks to state institutions in November and December 2016 alone. Ukraine has accused\nRussia of these cyber-attacks, but Moscow has denied involvement. A standard behavior of non-attributable, hybrid\nwarfare. (Douris, 2017)\n\n## Chronology of Russian Attacks (Timeline: Ten Years of Russian Cyber Attacks on Other, n.d.)\n\nRussian cyber attacks normally occur in conjunction with geopolitical events. They are part of his overall scheme of hybrid\nwarfare. Amid a show of hybrid tactics, Putin has awarded financial support to fringe political movements in Western\nEurope, launched cyberattacks and espionage in Europe, and ordered probing and actual attacks on U.S. and European\nenergy and communications infrastructure. He has continued to attempt to use control over energy – pipelines, nuclear\nplants, natural gas supplies – to wield influence across Europe. Western intelligence reports say Russia has exacerbated\nthe Syrian migrant crisis. And, compounding the threat, Russia has formed a growing alliance with Iran and China, countries\n\n\n-----\n\nthat possess their own hybrid toolboxes of proxy warfare and cyber infiltration. (Mazarr, 2015) Another standard behavior\nof hybrid warfare and one used against the energy sector.\n\nRussia’s actions based upon ‘maskirovka’ deploys few military assets while coordinating multiple functions of\ndisinformation, psychological warfare, memetic enginerring, and deception to achieve goals. Russia’s actions are likened\nto placing a frog in a pot of cool water on a stove. While slowly heating up the water, the frog finds it difficult to notice\nthe increasing temperatures until it is too late. All the time not knowing who actually placed him (the frog) in the water\nand not knowing who continued to turn up the burner. Maskirovka translates to camoflage but is also defined as the\nelements of surprise, diversion, and deception. Russia’s asymmetrical activity prevales on the internet, in social media,\nand as truth and is inclusive of all functions of warfare. The methods are relatively cheap and capitalize on the years of\nstudying Western behaviors. Russia is able to hack, infiltrate, manipulate, and manage the perceptions of targets while\nensuring plausible deniability. They do so by using proxy groups, hackers for hire, and trained operatives all behind a\nmonitor and keyboard.\n\n  - April - May 2007: Estonia, a tiny Baltic nation that was occupied by the Soviet Union until 1991, angered\nMoscow by planning to move a Russian World War II memorial and Russian soldiers' graves. Russia retaliated\nby temporarily disabling Estonia's internet, an especially harsh blow to the world's most internet-dependent\neconomy. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack focused on government offices and financial\ninstitutions, disrupting communications.\n\n  - June 2008: In a similar attack, Russia punished another former possession in the Baltic. When the Lithuanian\ngovernment outlawed the display of Soviet symbols, Russian hackers defaced government web pages with\nhammer-and-sickles and five-pointed stars.\n\n  - August 2008: After Georgia's pro-Western government sent troops into a breakaway republic backed by\nMoscow, Russian land, sea and air units invaded the country - and Russian hackers attacked Georgia's internet,\nthe first-time Russia coordinated military, and cyber action. Georgia's internal communications were\neffectively shut down.\n\n  - January 2009: As part of an effort to persuade the president of Kyrgyzstan to evict an American military base,\nRussian hackers shut down two of the country's four internet service providers with a DDOS attack. It worked.\nKyrgyzstan removed the military base. Subsequently, Kyrgyzstan received $2 billion in aid and loans from the\nKremlin.\n\n  - April 2009: After a media outlet in Kazakhstan published a statement by Kazakhstan's president that criticized\nRussia, a DDOS attack attributed to Russian elements shut down the outlet.\n\n  - August 2009: Russian hackers shut down Twitter and Facebook in Georgia to commemorate the first\nanniversary of the Russian invasion.\n\n  - 2014 – The Pentagon blamed Russia for a sophisticated hack into the White House’s unclassified email\ncorrespondence and the State Department.\n\n  - March 2014: For the second time, the Russian government allegedly coordinated military and cyber action. A\nDDOS attack 32 times larger than the largest known attack used during Russia's invasion of Georgia disrupted\nthe internet in Ukraine while Russian-armed pro-Russian rebels were seizing control of the Crimea. (JohnIB,\nn.d.)\n\n  - May 2014: Three days before Ukraine's presidential election, a Russia-based hacking group, took down the\ncountry's election commission in an overnight attack. Even a back-up system was taken down, but Ukrainian\ncomputer experts were able to restore the system before election day. Ukrainian police say they arrested\nhackers who were trying to rig the results. The attack was aimed at creating chaos and hurting the nationalist\ncandidate while helping the pro-Russian candidate. Russia's preferred candidate lost.\n`o` BlackEnergy Chronology\n\n         - 2007 - The first version of BlackEnergy appeared in 2007 used to launch DDoS attacks, create\nbotnets and steal banking credentials and so on. (Antiy, n.d.)\n\n\n-----\n\n         - 2008 - During the Russian-Georgian conflict, BlackEnergy used to conduct cyber-attacks against\nGeorgia.\n\n         - 2009 - In Citibank attack, the attacker had stolen tens of millions of dollars.\n\n         - 2010 - BlackEnergy2 is released in 2010 supporting more plug-in features.\n\n         - 2014 - The updated version BlackEnergy defined Ukraine and Poland as its attack targets.\n\n         - October 2014 - BlackEnergy attacks HMI of several providers, the victims include GE, Advantech\nWebAccess, SiemensWinCC.\n\n         - 14 October 2014 - iSIGHT discovered BlackEnergy sample which is delivered via CVE-2014-4114.\n\n         - November 2014 - Attack the devices of Linux and Cisco.\n\n         - December 2014 - The Information Security Report published German Federal Office for\nInformation Security (BSI) in 2014 a cyber-attack against the infrastructure of one German mill.\nThe attack caused significant physical damage. Reports indicated that the incident was related to\nBlackEnergy.\n\n         - November 2015 - During the presidential election in Ukraine, KillDisk infected several media\nagencies.\n\n         - December 2015 - Ukraine government asserted that BlackEnergy should responsible for the\nblackout incidents in the region of Lavno-Franklvst of Ukraine.\n\n  - May 2015: German investigators discovered hackers had penetrated the computer network of the German\nBundestag, the most significant hack in German history. The Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV),\nGerman's domestic intelligence service, later said Russia was behind the attack and that they were seeking\ninformation not just on the workings of the Bundestag, but German leaders and NATO, among others. Security\nexperts said hackers were trying to penetrate the computers of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian\nDemocratic party.\n\n  - 2015 – France Russia sought to destroy France’s TV5Monde channel via an April 2015 cyberattack. The attack\ntook the channel off air for several hours.\n\n  - October 2015 - At the November NATO meeting in Bulgaria, its prime minister explained that Starting on 25\nOctober, websites of the council of ministers of Parliament and the central election committee were attacked\nthrough cyber capabilities in an unprecedented way. The Prime Minister blamed the Russians for the attacks,\nas it also coincided with increased incursions into their airspace by Russian planes.\n\n  - 2015: Turkey blamed Russia for a massive cyber-attack that forced it to close external traffic to NIC.tr, making\nit impossible to access or send email from .tr addresses. Turkey had been at odds with Russia after shooting\ndown a Russian plane in its airspace.\n\n  - 2016: US Democratic National Committee. Starting with the Democratic National Convention and continuing\ninto the fall campaign, Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks has released emails purportedly coming from the\nDemocratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. A Joint Statement from the Department of\nHomeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence put the blame squarely on the Russians.\n\n## BlackEnergy \nExecution and Behavior\n\n### Step 1: Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering. Before the attack, adversaries likely begin open-source\nintelligence gathering and reconnaissance on potential targets. (WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT, n.d.)\n\nLocation: External infrastructure Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: May 2014 or earlier\n\nDevice/application: Activity conducted external to network\n\nRole in infrastructure: Activity conducted external to network\n\n\n-----\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries likely gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network\narchitecture, and may also use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices, enumeration of\ndevices, social media data collection and analysis for future targeting\n\n### Step 2: Malware Development and Weaponization. Adversaries acquire or independently develop the malware\nto be used in the attack, as well as the weaponized documents to deliver malware.\n\nLocation: External infrastructure Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: May 2014 or earlier\n\nDevice/application: Activity conducted external to network\n\nRole in infrastructure: Activity conducted external to network\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries acquire BlackEnergy remote access Trojan (RAT) and weaponize Microsoft\n(MS) Word and Excel files with VBA scripts to drop the BlackEnergy RAT.\n\nImpact: Combined with targeting data gathered during the reconnaissance phase, adversaries can develop\ntailored attack packages. At the completion of this step, adversaries have the necessary tools to begin their\nattack.\n\n### Step 3: Deliver Remote Access Trojan (RAT) Adversaries initiate phishing campaign against electricity\ndistributors. Step 4: Install RAT. Adversaries install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors\nafter employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.\n\nLocation: Corporate network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: May 2014–June 2015e\n\nDevice/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet\nExplorer web browser\n\nRole in infrastructure: Support email communications and other IT services used in business operations.\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries send targeted emails containing the modified MS Office files as attachments to\nusers on targeted networks.\n\nImpact: RAT is delivered to targeted network, but not installed. Installation requires employees to actively grant\npermission to the embedded VBA scripts to execute.\n\n### Step 4: Adversaries install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors after employees\nopen the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.\n\nLocation: Corporate network\n\nAction: Employee-enabled malware execution\n\nTimeline: May 2014–June 2015\n\nDevice/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet\nExplorer web browser\n\nRole in infrastructure: Support email communications and other services used in business operations.\n\nExploitation method: In a social engineering attack, employees are prompted to enable macros when opening\nthe file attached to phishing email. Once macros are enabled, the VBA script places multiple malicious files on\nthe workstation, unbeknown to the employee.\n\nImpact: Files placed on workstations within the corporate network can begin the communication process with\n( )\n\n\n-----\n\n### Step 5: Establish CC Connection. Malware establishes connection from the malicious implant on the targeted\nnetwork to attacker-controlled CC server.\n\nLocation: Corporate network Action: Malware execution Timeline: May 2014–June 2015\n\nDevice/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet\nExplorer web browser\n\nRole in infrastructure: Support email communications and other services used in business operations.\n\nExploitation method: The external connection is established as part of the execution routine following\ninstallation of the malicious files. Once permissions to execute macros are granted by employees, the malicious\nVBA script installs the malware implant, and the implant attempts to communicate with an external server via\nHTTP requests.\n\nImpact: Adversaries gain unauthorized access to targeted networks, including the ability to deliver additional\nBlackEnergy plugins to enable internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.\n\n### Step 6: Deliver Malware Plugins Following installation of BlackEnergy 3 implant, adversaries likely import plugins to\nenable credential harvesting and internal network reconnaissance.\n\nLocation: Corporate network\n\nAction: Active threat actor activity Timeline: June 2015–December 2015 Device/application: Employee\nworkstations,\n\nlikely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet Explorer web browser\n\nRole in infrastructure: Support email communications and other services used in business operations\n\nExploitation method: The BlackEnergy 3 implant delivered in the initial attack functions as a receiver for\nadditional malware plugins. After establishing a remote connection with delivered files via HTTPS, the threat\nlikely delivers the additional malware components.\n\nImpact: The delivered plugins enable additional BlackEnergy functionality, including harvesting user credentials,\nkeylogging, and network reconnaissance.\n\n### Step 7: Harvest Credentials. Delivered BE3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery\nfunctions.\n\nDelivered BlackEnergy 3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions.\n\nLocation: Corporate network\n\nAction: Active threat actor activity, malware execution\n\nTimeline: June 2015–December 2015\n\nDevice/application: Windows OS workstations, Windows domain controllers, virtual private network (VPN)\nservice deployed in control environment\n\nRole in infrastructure: These systems support business operations, manage permissions and domain access, and\nprovide remote network access respectively.\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries use delivered BlackEnergy 3 plugins to gather stored credentials or log\nkeystrokes. After gathering valid credentials for user with administrator privileges, adversaries use the stolen\n\n\n-----\n\nadministrator credentials to access the domain controller, recover additional credentials, and create new\nprivileged accounts.\n\nImpact: Adversaries obtain valid credentials enabling them to expand access across the corporate network and\ninto the control environment, ensure persistent access, and blend into regular network traffic.\n\n### Step 8: Lateral Movement and Target Identification on Corporate Network\n\nAdversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on corporate network to discover potential targets and expand\naccessed.\n\nLocation: Corporate network\n\nAction: Active threat actor activity, malware execution Timeline: June 2015–December 2015\n\nDevice/application: Discovered systems, including networked uninterruptable power supply (UPS) devices, data\ncenter servers, a telephone communications server, and employee workstations\n\nRole in infrastructure: Internal reconnaissance efforts could potentially include all deployed devices on the\ncorporate network.\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries likely use a combination of valid user credentials and BlackEnergy 3 plugins\ndeveloped to conduct network discovery. VS.dll plugin is likely used to leverage MS Sysinternals PsExec to\nestablish remote connections to workstations and servers.\n\nImpact: Adversaries can enumerate the systems deployed across the network, identify targets, and begin\npreparations for final attack.\n\n### Step 9: Lateral Movement and Target Identification on ICS network\n\nAdversaries use stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct reconnaissance on deployed\nsystems.\n\nLocation: ICS network\n\nAction: Active threat actor activity\n\nTimeline: June 2015–December 2015\n\nDevice/application: Discovered systems, including human machine interface (HMI) workstations, distributed\nmanagement system (DMS) servers, UPS devices, 52 serial-to-Ethernet converters (Moxa UC 7408-LX-Plus, 53\nIRZRUH2 3G54), remote terminal unit (RTU) devices (ABB RTU560 CMU-02), and the substation breakers\n\nRole in infrastructure: HMI workstations provide a graphical user interface for operators to remotely monitor\nand control devices within the control environment.\n\nDMS applications enable centralized monitoring and issuing of commands within a control environment. UPS\ndevices condition incoming power to downstream devices and provide temporary battery backup power. Serialto-Ethernet converters convert serial data from field devices to digital packets, enabling communications with\nthe control center. RTU devices function as a communication processor or a data concentrator in a substation,\nenabling communications and data transfer between field devices in the substations and the control center.\nSubstation breakers are devices designed to physically interrupt current flows through an electrical circuit.\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries use valid credentials to interact directly with the client application for the DMS\nserver via a VPN, and native remote access services to access employee workstations hosting HMI applications.\nThis access likely enables adversaries to enumerate all networked devices within the control environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nImpact: Adversaries gain access to critical systems, enabling them to begin target selection and preparations for\nfinal attack.\n\n### Step 10: Develop Malicious Computer Code. Adversaries develop malicious computer code update for identified\nserial-to-Ethernet converters.\n\nLocation: External infrastructure Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: June 2015–December 2015\n\nDevice/application: Activity conducted external to network\n\nRole in infrastructure: Activity conducted external to network\n\nExploitation method: After identifying deployed converts, adversaries begin a malware development and testing\neffort on infrastructure outside of the targeted network.\n\nImpact: Upon completion of this step, adversaries would have target-specific malware designed to disrupt\ncommunications with field devices by disabling deployed converters.\n\n### Step 11: Deliver Data Destruction Malware. Adversaries likely deliver KillDisk malware to a network share and set\npolicy on the domain controller to retrieve malware and execute upon system reboot.\n\nLocation: Corporate and ICS network\n\nAction: Active threat actor activity\n\nTimeline: December 2015, directly preceding attack\n\nDevice/application: Network share and Windows domain controller server\n\nRole in infrastructure: The network share provides access to shared digital resources, and the Windows domain\ncontroller manages access control throughout the network.\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries likely use stolen credentials to place KillDisk malware on a network share, then\nset the retrieval and execution of the malicious files by implementing a policy on the compromised domain\ncontroller server.\n\nImpact: Prescheduling execution of malware enables coordination of multiple attack components, such that\ndata destruction coincides with or shortly follows attacks against breakers.\n\n### Step 12: Schedule Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) Disruption. Adversaries schedule unauthorized\noutage of UPS for telephone communication server and data center servers.\n\nLocation: Corporate and ICS network\n\nAction: Active threat actor activity\n\nTimeline: Directly preceding December 2015 attack\n\nDevice/application: Networked UPS devices with remote management interface\n\nRole in infrastructure: Prevent power outages from disrupting continuous operation of critical systems.\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries likely use valid credentials to access privileged employee accounts, then use\nthis access to remotely schedule unauthorized power outages.\n\n\n-----\n\nImpact: Prescheduling outages enables coordination of multiple attack components, such that critical systems\nalso go down because of the power outages, stifling potential restoration efforts.\n\n### Step 13: Trip Breakers. Adversaries use native remote access services and valid credentials to open breakers and\ndisrupt power distribution to over 225,000 customers within three distribution areas.\n\nLocation: ICS network\n\nAction: Active threat actor activity\n\nTimeline: December 23, 2015, during\n\nDevice/application: HMI workstations, DMS servers, RTU, and the substation breakers\n\nRole in infrastructure: HMI workstations provide a graphical user interface for operators to remotely monitor\nand control devices within the control environment.\n\nDMS applications enable centralized monitoring and issuing of commands within a control environment.\nSubstation breakers are devices designed to physically interrupt current flows through an electrical circuit.\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries use valid credentials to seize control of operator workstations, access DMS\nclient application via VPN, and issue unauthorized commands to breakers at substations.\n\nImpact: Opening of breakers results in disruption of electricity service to customers.\n\n### Step 14: Sever Connection to Field Devices. After opening the breakers, adversaries deliver malicious computer\ncode update to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices. The malicious updates render the converters inoperable,\nand sever connections between the control center and the substations.\n\nLocation: ICS network\n\nAction: Active threat actor activity\n\nTimeline: December 23, 2015, during attack\n\nDevice/application: Serial-to-Ethernet converters (Moxa UC 7408-LX-Plus,55 IRZRUH2 3G56)\n\nRole in infrastructure: Convert serial data from field devices to digital packets to be transmitted to remote\nmonitoring and administration systems within the control network.\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries use network access to push the malicious update over the network to targeted\ndevices.\n\nImpact: Operators are unable to remotely close the breakers, requiring workers to manually close breakers at\neach substation. Forcing this manual response draws out recovery time\n\n### Step 15: Telephony Denial-of-Service Attack. Adversaries initiate DoS attack on telephone call center at one of\nthe targeted distributors.\n\nLocation: Corporate network\n\nAction: Likely automated process\n\nTimeline: Dec 23, 2015, during attack\n\nDevice/application: Operator telephone call center\n\n\n-----\n\nRole in infrastructure: Receive external telephone communications from customers.\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries likely use automated IP-based call generators to flood the targeted call center.\n\nImpact: Automated calls overwhelm resources at call center, blocking legitimate communications from\ncustomers.\n\n### Step 16: Disable Critical Systems via UPS Outage. Previously scheduled UPS outage cuts power to targeted\ntelephone communications server and data center servers.\n\nLocation: Corporate and ICS network Action: Execution of prescheduled process Timeline: December 23, 2015,\nduring attack\n\nDevice/application: Networked UPS devices with remote management interface, telephone communications\nserver, and data center servers\n\nRole in infrastructure: Prevent power outages from disrupting continuous operation of critical systems.\n\nExploitation method: Adversaries use network access to schedule the temporary backup power to be offline at\nthe time of the power outages.\n\nImpact: Power loss to telephone server disrupts communications across remote sites, and disruptions at control\ncenters inhibit ability to monitor and respond to attack against breakers. The disruption at the data center and\nassociated system reboot trigger execution of KillDisk malware.\n\n### Step 17: Destroy Critical System Data. Scheduled execution of KillDisk malware erases the master boot records\nand deletes system log data on targeted machines across the victims’ corporate and ICS network.\n\nLocation: Corporate network and ICS network\n\nAction: Malware execution\n\nTimeline: December 23, 2015, during attack\n\nDevice/application: RTU device (ABB RTU560 CMU-02),57 servers and workstations used by management,\nhuman resources (HR), and finance staff\n\nRole in infrastructure: The RTU functions as a communication processor or data concentrator in a substation,\nenabling communications and data transfer between field devices in the substations and the control center.58\nServers and workstations are used by management, HR, and finance staff to conduct business administration\noperations.\n\nExploitation method: Malware is retrieved from the network share and executed on networked devices\naccording to direction received via domain controller policy or local Windows Task Scheduler.\n\nImpact: Targeted systems are rendered inoperable, and critical data is destroyed.\n\n\n-----\n\n## DragonFly\nAn ongoing cyberespionage campaign against a range of targets, mainly in the energy sector, gave attackers the ability to\nmount sabotage operations against their victims. The attackers, known to Symantec as Dragonfly, managed to\ncompromise (Star Report, n.d.) some strategically important organizations for spying purposes and, if they had used the\nsabotage capabilities open to them, could have caused damage or disruption to energy supplies in affected countries.\n\nAmong the targets of Dragonfly were energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline\noperators, and energy industry industrial equipment providers. The majority of the victims were located in the United\nStates, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and Poland. (Dragonfly, n.d.)\n\nThe Dragonfly group is well resourced, with a range of malware tools at its disposal and is capable of launching attacks\nthrough some different vectors. Its most ambitious attack campaign saw it compromise some industrial control system\n(ICS) equipment providers, infecting their software with a remote access-type Trojan. This caused companies to install the\nmalware when downloading software updates for computers running ICS equipment. These infections not only gave the\nattackers a beachhead in the targeted organizations’ networks but also gave them the means to mount sabotage\noperations against infected ICS computers.\n\nThis campaign follows in the footsteps of Stuxnet, which was the first known major malware campaign to target ICS\nsystems. While Stuxnet was narrowly targeted at the Iranian nuclear program and had sabotage as its primary goal,\nDragonfly appears to have a much broader focus with espionage and persistent access as its current objective with\nsabotage as an optional capability if required.\n\nIn addition to compromising ICS software, Dragonfly has used spam email campaigns and watering hole attacks to infect\ntargeted organizations. The group has used two main malware tools: Backdoor.Oldrea and Trojan.Karagany. The former\nappears to be a custom piece of malware, either written by or for the attackers.\n\nBefore publication, Symantec notified affected victims and relevant national authorities, such as Computer Emergency\nResponse Centers (CERTs) that handle and respond to Internet security incidents.\n\n### Background\nThe Dragonfly group, which is also known by other vendors as Energetic Bear, appears to have been in operation since at\nleast 2011 and may have been active even longer than that. Dragonfly initially targeted defense and aviation companies\nin the US and Canada before shifting its focus mainly to US and European energy firms in early 2013.\n\nThe campaign against the European and American energy sector quickly expanded in scope. The group initially began\nsending malware in phishing emails to personnel in target firms. This behavior changed to watering hole attacks\ncompromising websites likely to be visited by those working in energy to redirect them to websites hosting an exploit kit.\nThe exploit kit, in turn, delivered malware to the victim’s computer. The third phase of the campaign was the Trojanizing\nof legitimate software bundles belonging to three different ICS equipment manufacturers. These behaviors represent a\ncombined approach that continues to evolve but ensures weaknesses in software and the supply chain are equally\nexploited.\n\nDragonfly’s behavior is representative of a state-sponsored operation. Dragonfly mounts attacks through multiple vectors\nand compromise numerous third party websites in the process as a tool to ensure anonymity. Dragonfly targeted several\norganizations in the energy sector. Its current main motive appears to be cyberespionage, with sabotage a definite\nsecondary capability potentially for later use.\n\nTime analysis behaviors of timestamps on the malware used by the attackers indicates that the group mostly worked\nbetween Monday and Friday, with activity mainly concentrated in a nine-hour period that corresponded to a 9 am to 6\npm working day in the UTC +4 time zone. Based on this information, it is likely the attackers are based in Eastern Europe.\n(Energy Sector Alert, n.d.)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Tools employed\nDragonfly uses two main pieces of malware in its attacks. Both are remote access tool (RAT) type malware which\n(Dragonfly vs. America, Courtesy of Russia, n.d.) provides the attackers with access and control of compromised\ncomputers. Dragonfly’s favored malware tool is Backdoor. Oldrea, which is also known as Havex or the Energetic Bear\nRAT. Oldrea acts as a backdoor (Symantec, n.d.; Symantec, n.d.) for the attackers on to the victim’s computer, allowing\nthem to extract data and install further malware.\n\nOldrea appears to be custom malware, either written by the group itself or created for it. This provides some indication\nof the capabilities and resources behind the Dragonfly group.\n\nOldrea’s behavior once installed is to gather system information, along with lists of files, programs installed, and the root\nof available drives. It will also extract data from the computer’s Outlook address book and VPN configuration files. This\ndata is then written to a temporary file in an encrypted format before being sent to a remote command-and-control (C&C)\nserver controlled by the attackers. The file obfuscation ensures anonymity of content.\n\nThe C&C servers appear to be hosted on compromised servers running content management systems, indicating that the\nattackers may have used the same exploit to gain control of each server. This behavior follows the model of maskirovka.\nOldrea has a basic control panel which allows an authenticated user to download a compressed version of the stolen data\nfor each particular victim.\n\nThe second main tool used by Dragonfly is Trojan.Karagany. Unlike Oldrea, Karagany was available on the underground\nmarket. The source code for version 1 of Karagany was leaked in 2010. Symantec believes that Dragonfly may have taken\nthis source code and modified it for its own use thereby further validating the risk of leaving cyber weaponry on the\nbattlefield. This version is detected by Symantec as Trojan.Karagany!gen1.\n\nKaragany is capable of uploading stolen data, downloading new files, and running executable files on an infected\ncomputer. Karagany has additional behaviors such as running additional plugins, using tools for collecting passwords,\ntaking screenshots, and cataloging documents on infected computers. The intent to analyze the data for later exploitation.\n\nSymantec found that the majority of computers compromised by the attackers were infected with Oldrea. Karagany was\nonly used in around 5 percent of infections.\n\n### Multiple attack vectors\nThe Dragonfly group has used at least three infection behaviors against targets in the energy sector. The initial behavior\nwas an email campaign, which saw targeted executives and senior employees in energy companies receive emails\ncontaining a malicious PDF attachment. Infected emails had one of two subject lines: “The account” or “Settlement of\ndelivery problem”.\n\nThe spam campaign began in February 2013 and continued into June 2013. Symantec identified seven different\norganizations targeted in this campaign. This behavior ceased as organizational defenses improved.\n\nThe attackers then shifted their behaviors to watering hole attacks, comprising some energy-related websites and injecting\nan iframe into each which redirected visitors to another compromised legitimate website hosting the Lightsout exploit kit.\nLightsout exploits either Java or Internet Explorer to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim’s computer. The fact that the\nattackers compromised multiple legitimate websites for each stage of the operation is further evidence that the group\nhas strong technical capabilities while changing tactics. The tactics may have changed due to vendor reporting on\nadversary behaviors.\n\nIn September 2013, Dragonfly began using a new version of this exploit kit, known as the Hello exploit kit. The landing\npage for this kit contains JavaScript which fingerprints the system, identifying installed browser plugins. The victim is then\nredirected to an URL which in turn determines the best exploit to use based on the information collected.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Trojanized software\nThe most ambitious attack vector used by Dragonfly was the compromise of some legitimate software packages. Three\ndifferent ICS equipment providers were targeted, and malware was inserted into the software bundles they had made\navailable for download on their websites. All three companies made equipment that is used in some industrial sectors,\nincluding energy. Delta Electronics, which we cover later in this document, could be subjected to the same malware.\n\nThe first identified Trojanized software was a product used to provide VPN access to programmable logic controller (PLC)\ntype devices. The vendor discovered the attack shortly after it was mounted, but there had already been 250 unique\ndownloads of the compromised software.\n\nThe second company to be compromised was a European manufacturer of specialist PLC type devices. In this instance, a\nsoftware package containing a driver for one of its devices was compromised. Symantec estimates that the Trojanized\nsoftware was available for download for at least six weeks in June and July 2013.\n\nThe third firm attacked was a European company which develops systems to manage wind turbines, biogas plants, and\nother energy infrastructure. Symantec believes that compromised software may have been available for download for\napproximately ten days in April 2014.\n\nThe Dragonfly group is technically adept and able to think strategically. Given the size of some of its targets, the group\nfound a “soft underbelly” by compromising their suppliers, which are invariably smaller, less protected companies.\nUnauthorized resellers were not examined as part of the analysis nor was the potential for “knock off” companies selling\ncounterfeit hardware.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Delta Elektronics\n### Intelligence/Reconnaissance:\n\nRussian information on the formation of the companies established under the name of Oleg Vladimirovich Strekozov.\nBegin dates of the companies and the monies used to create the companies is listed below. Recovered documents indicate\nother names involved in certain companies under the Oleg name.\n\n(Registration numbers of Russian companies., n.d.)INN – Identifying Tax Number of a tax-payer (consists of 10 digits). Each\nRussian company has its unique tax number concerning all taxes and duties. Usually, an abbreviation \"INN\" is used in\nEnglish letters. INN number is given to a Russian company by the respective state tax body at the moment of company’s\ntax registration in the place of its legal address. As a proof of tax registration, the company receives a certificate with INN\nissued by the tax body.

How many are deployed in the typical pipeline? What are key vulnerable points? How many would\nhave to be attacked to create some stoppage for a significant period? Also, it would be very interesting to know about\nDelta's legitimate business. Who buys from them and with how much volume?\n\nWhat appears clearly is that there is a bunch of companies registered to this Oleg Strekozov and that his name also\nappears in some WHOISs about shady sites and that he has some association with malware. Whether he is corporeal\nor virtual, Mr. Strekozov is associated with Russian cyber organized crime. Treadstone 71 can immediately say that\nsuccessful organizations of this type are associated with FSB and controlled by oligarchs. Successful oligarchs are close\nto Putin and, of course, Putin controls the FSB. Real or unreal, Mr. Strekozov is a tool of such a hierarchy.\n\nTreadstone 71 is careful to leap to conclusions about whether Mr. Strekozov is real. He could be a made-up name\nused for certain registrations, or he could be the weekend doorman at Lubyanka (in jest). But he could be real. His\npatronymic is Vladimirovich so that the judge could be his father. A look at Facebook finds an Oleg in the Belarusan\ntown of Hlybokaye, educated in eastern Ukraine, about 25 years old. We do not discount him because of age--billions\nchange hands hourly in Moscow, and there are plenty of young criminals driving Maserati’s with a bottle of expensive\nwhiskey in their hand. Real or unreal, S's\naddress of Proezd Dmitrovskiy is in an\nupscale neighborhood that is also not far\nfrom Lubyanka.\n\n European locations – no mention of\nRussia\n\n Asian locations – no mention of Russia\n\n Several US locations including Houston\n\n\n-----\n\nDelta or Delta? The more Treadstone 71\ninvestigates on this company, the more\nskeptical we have become about the\ninnocence of the Taiwanese company.\nWe have found that the Russian Delta has\nattended trade shows and held press\nconferences. With thousands of dollars\nof sales and only a limited number of\ncompanies that make PLCs, do we believe\nthat some people in Taipei are unaware\nabout this? Treadstone 71 has discovered\nother companies that do business in\nRussia but try not to advertise that in the\nWest. Could it be that Delta-Ru is buying\nor arranging sales and Delta-Tai is happy\nto turn away from this? The price for\ndoing such business in and through\nRussia is, of course, to take Russian\npartner. Either way, the possibility of\nsupply chain contamination is real.\n\nIn applying an informal analysis of\ncompeting for a hypothesis to all this,\nTreadstone 71 has come up with two\nmore hypotheses that fit the facts (as\nthey stand now, understanding that\nmore information and analysis is\nneeded).\n\nThis could be an effort to cause serial\nfailures that could drive up energy prices,\nalthough the coordination and precision for this to work past a few days would be extraordinary.\n\nAnother possibility is that this is just a scheme for some oligarchs to make money. They speculate on buying a tanker\nfilled with crude. While tanker is at sea, an incident occurs at some pipeline or port spiking the price of oil and Oleg's\ntanker pulls into Rotterdam right at the peak.\n\nFinally, this could be just a part of a Russian medium-term strategy to contaminate as much hardware, firmware, and\nsoftware as possible.\n\n Name of Delta Electronics\n\n Address Moscow, Semenovskiy per., 15, of. 615\n\n Email info@deltaelectronics.su\n\n Section Industrial equipment\n\n Phone:+7 (495) 9845105, 8 (800) 5559055 - Different locations than that of Oleg’s site for Delta Elektronics –\n\n\n-----\n\n Oleg does not show up in any people searches in Russia yet appears as a hacker and as an owner of scores of\ncompanies. Is it likely that this can be both accurate and true?\n\n Treadstone 71 does not believe this is true.\n\n Gazprom has direct operations in Kyrgyzstan\n\n Oleg Vladimirovich Strekozov does not seem to exist\n\n Vladimir Strekozov was a constitutional court judge – hardly a hacker\n\n    - Not the same as Oleg Vladimirovich Strekozov\n\n    - Any searches of Oleg Strekozov about Oil and Gas only brings up site registration\n\n    - No mention of someone who owns so many firms in and around Moscow (expensive)\n\n                             - No mention of someone who owns first in the\nKyrgyz area related to Gazprom\n\n It is more likely that Oleg Strekozov is just a name\nbacked by Russian government funding. The\nlocation is Red Square. “Thumbing their nose.”\n\n Question: Why duplicate Delta Electronics if they\nare not the same company?\n\n                             - What could the motivation for Russia be to pose\nas Delta Electronics?\n\n                                          - Hardware used in gas and oil production\n\n                                          - Sold in international markets – global name –\naccepted – trusted\n\nTreadstone 71 can imagine all kinds of functions that could be contaminated with logic bombs and backdoors, ready\nfor the call of the Rodina (Russian Motherland).\n\nIt should be noted that these three hypotheses are not mutually exclusive of one another as the motivations could\nlogically coexist.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Analysis of Competing Hypotheses I\n\n\n-----\n\n### Analysis of Competing Hypotheses II\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## In Summary\nAlthough there is an absence of evidence\nsupporting a direct alignment of\nBlackEnergy, Dragonfly, and Delta\nElektronics, the similarity of the targets,\nassumed adversary intent, the behaviors\nand methods of deception are consistent\nwith nation-state actions. We estimate the\nlikelihood of Russian complicity to be\nprobable. The evidence collected and\nsubsequent analysis using structured\ntechniques does not render our judgment\nto be fact or a certainty, however, and\nsuch judgments still carry a risk of being\nwrong. Some of the information is\nfragmented and poorly corroborated to make solid analytic inferences. Some sources are difficult to validate. Typical\ncompartmentalization of intelligence activities may be used to ensure complete lack of awareness of activities at the\noperational level. Leadership over the groups behind BlackEnergy, Dragonfly, and Delta Elektronics may be limited in a\n“Dunbar’s number” method of maintain secrecy.\n\nWe cannot rule out direct Russian involvement based upon previous judgments and behaviors by the Russian government\nand Russian proxies. Historical profiling of Russian activities indicates at a minimum, their participation in these activities.\n\nAdversary intent, whether it is BlackEnergy, Dragonfly, or Delta Elektronics combined with expert capabilities enables a\nhigh probability of threat. Additionally, the probability of threat occurrence in unison with the success of the actions and\nthe overall impact(s) when examined considering the Ukrainian attacks, represents an elevated level of risk.\n\nThe use of hybrid warfare methods in combination with constantly moving attack vectors makes difficult, attribution and\nmethods of defense. The adversary(s) behind the actions demonstrate information superiority while revealing behaviors\nwith similarities. Continued data and information collection for analysis is required but serves as a double-edged sword.\nThis sword ensures we continue to churn examining multiple different versions of information using limited resources\nwhile missing the primary intent and potentially simple conclusion as to the intent and success of the adversary(s).\n\nT71\n\n\n-----\n\nInfection Examples\n\nhttps://www.hybrid[analysis.com/sample/5e0c99e6350fd89a7b0d2dd480873ef2f2f566b8a41848a794cc7fa458c0a7ad?environmentId=100](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/5e0c99e6350fd89a7b0d2dd480873ef2f2f566b8a41848a794cc7fa458c0a7ad?environmentId=100)\n\n[https://www.reverse.it/sample/41cc903cd5fa2516855cffc80ae5724a3fffee795c79aa81ea136e94db2bd34f?environmen](https://www.reverse.it/sample/41cc903cd5fa2516855cffc80ae5724a3fffee795c79aa81ea136e94db2bd34f?environmentId=100)\n[tId=100](https://www.reverse.it/sample/41cc903cd5fa2516855cffc80ae5724a3fffee795c79aa81ea136e94db2bd34f?environmentId=100)\n\n[https://malwr.com/analysis/NzgzZmRhZjM5MjczNDc2NTg1ODY1ZTQxYzNkYWRlYjU/](https://malwr.com/analysis/NzgzZmRhZjM5MjczNDc2NTg1ODY1ZTQxYzNkYWRlYjU/)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Search Criteria Example:**\n\n**site:.com | .edu | .org | .uk | .net | .gov | .mil | .su | .ru | .tw | .ir dcisoft_v1.12**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Bibliography\n\n_Aapo Cederberg and Pasi Eronen, “How are Societies Defended against Hybrid Threats?” Geneva Centre for Security_\nPolicy, September 2015.
