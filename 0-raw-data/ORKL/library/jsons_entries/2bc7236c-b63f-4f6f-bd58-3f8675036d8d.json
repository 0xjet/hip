DPRK offensive cyber activities include\ncyberespionage and lucrative campaigns and are resolutely asymmetrical and a force multiplier in subverting international\nsanctions and funding Pyongyang’s economy. These facets contribute to the survival of the North Korean state, as well as\nmaintaining its position within the international system as a “small great power.”\n\nDPRK malicious cyber activities involve multiple state organisations, including the Ministry of State Security (MSS aka Bowibu)\nand the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Associated Intrusion Sets include Lazarus, Bluenoroff, Andariel, Reaper, and\nKimsuky.\n\n## A saucerful of Secrets\n\n**Let there be more spy**\n\nAll North-Korea-associated Intrusion Sets continued carrying out cyberespionage activities throughout the year, with a\nparticularly high tempo of activity demonstrated by Lazarus and Kimsuky. Targeted sectors notably included a strong focus\n**on cryptocurrency-related entities and the aerospace and defence industry (operation DreamJob). Additional sectors of**\ninterest include technology, civil society (journalists, activists, defectors), academia, think tanks, media, and diplomacy, notably\npertaining to nuclear policy, Korean Peninsula and Asia-Pacific subject matters. Reported malicious activities suggest a\n**renewed interest in targeting international organisations [1] [2] for strategic intelligence collection.**\n\nSEKOIA.IO analysts noticed Kimsuky refocusing on their traditional assigned locations,\n\nnamely the United States (U.S.), Japan, and the Republic of Korea (aka RoK and South Korea),\n\nand refocusing on military intelligence collection, as well as expanding their victimology\n\nto target the shipping industry [3] and a company involved in carbon credits [4].\n\nLast reported in April 2022, DPRK-nexus Intrusion Set Reaper was seen carrying out targeted surveillance operations\nagainst human rights activists, journalists, and defectors from\n\nNorth Korea notably leveraging the Chinotto malware [5], Goldbackdoor, a variant of the BlueLight malware [6], and newly\ndiscovered CloudMensis, a spyware based on RokRAT and designed to target Windows and MacOS systems [7].\n\nAdditional DPRK-aligned cyberespionage activities include the targeting of the energy and\n\n**military sectors [8], as well as energy providers in Canada, Japan, and the United States**\n\nbetween February and July 2022 [9]. Of note, energy-related targeting is a consistent longstanding assignment for the Andariel\nIntrusion Set. Additionally, Andariel was reported deploying their signature Maui ransomware on at least one occasion in 2022\n\n[10]. Based on available information, it is not clear whether the deployment of Maui was part of a lucrative objective and / or an\nanti-forensic effort from the Intrusion Set. It is also plausible ransomware operations carried out by Andariel are part of\n**moonlighting activities for personal gain or selffunding.**\n\n**You get a good (Dream)job**\n\n2022 saw the continuation of DreamJob (aka ShowState, DeathNote, Operation In(ter)ception),\n\na two-fold campaign run by Lazarus since March 2019. DreamJob encompasses the targeting\n\nof aerospace and defence related organisations and individuals, security researchers, and\n\ncryptocurrency related entities for cyberespionage and lucrative objectives\n\n\n-----\n\nLazarus continued relying on social engineering, including leveraging social networks and\nmessaging applications (notably LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Slack) masquerading as recruiters\n\nfrom defence [11] and cryptocurrency high profile companies. Recent victimology notably includes defence contractors in\nFrance, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany, Czech Republic, the\n\nNetherlands, Poland, Ukraine, Turkey, South Africa, Qatar, and Brazil [12].\n\nSEKOIA.IO analysts assess the targeting of security researchers observed in this campaign\n\nlikely provides Lazarus with knowledge to improve their Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\n\n(TTPs), notably those pertaining to persistence, defence evasion and anti-forensics efforts.\n\nThis activity also possibly aims at contributing to capacity building for Lazarus, providing\n\nthem with new tools and malware for follow-up operations.\n\n## The DPRK side of the mo(o)ney\n\nDPRK-nexus Intrusion Sets, including Lazarus and Bluenoroff continued carrying out lucrative cyber campaigns, notably\ntargeting cryptocurrency and financial technology-related activities. As previously mentioned, this includes part of Operation\nDreamJob conducted by Lazarus, whose financially motivated aspect was notably illustrated by the targeting of a Brazilian\ncryptocurrency company with NukeSped [13]. Of note, SEKOIA.IO assess it is likely that Brazil “Bitcoin Law” debates occurring\nin October 2021 [14] renewed Lazarus’ interest in targeting this country in lucrative motivated campaigns.\n\n**Apples and Oranges**\n\nLazarus also continued running the AppleJeus campaign, targeting cryptocurrency and fintech platforms and users with\nbackdoored cryptocurrency trading applications, active since at least 2018 [15]. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA) publicly attributed the malicious campaign against decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Ronin Network\n(Axie Infinity) that occurred in March to Lazarus [16].\n\n**Snatch that cash**\n\nAnother long-running campaign called SnatchCrypto (aka CryptoCore, DangerousPassword)\n\ncarried out by Bluenoroff since 2017 was still active through 2022 [17]. From SEKOIA.IO analysts’ vantage point, this\ncampaign notably includes TraderTraitor activities, a series of malicious applications masquerading as trading or price\nprediction tools, using the Electron framework and cross-platform JavaScript code to deliver the Manuscrypt RAT [18]. This\ncampaign appears opportunistic in nature, victimology notably includes Europe, Asia, the U.S., and the UAE.\n\nFinancially motivated campaigns are a trademark of DPRK-nexus Intrusion Sets, almost certainly to evade economic sanctions\nand funding of follow-up cyber malicious campaigns. Open-source reports also indicate funding of nuclear weapons through the\nReconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), specifically Bureau 121, which Lazarus, Andariel and Bluenoroff are allegedly\nsubordinated to. However, recent reporting indicates that DPRK-nexus Intrusion Sets tend to hold stolen cryptocurrency for\nseveral years, possibly as part of their monetary policy. Another hypothesis is that unlaundered cryptocurrency funds could\npossibly result from an operator error.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1. DPRK-nexus Intrusion Sets 2022 activities. Source : SEKOIA.IO**\n\n## The Peek at the gates\n\nBased on reported TTPs and malware analysis provided in open sources, SEKOIA.IO analysts observed North Korea-nexus\nIntrusion Sets strong and continued efforts in selectively targeting their victims and improving their stealthiness.\n\nBesides advanced reconnaissance efforts, Intrusion Sets can further screen their targets before delivering their payload. For\ninstance, Kimsuky was recently observed using an IP validation method as part of its GoldDragon infection mechanism [19].\nThe same Intrusion Set also newly implemented a geofencing mechanism in their signature malware Konni RAT [20], and\nsimilar behaviour was observed in the FastSpy infection chain [21]. In a recent campaign Kimsuky also used a file exfiltrator\ncomponent to find and collect specific files of interest via filelists hosted on a remote server [22].\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile North Korea-nexus Intrusion Sets traditionally reuse their infrastructure, they demonstrate increased efforts to achieve\nstealthiness, notably through obfuscation, defence evasion mechanisms as well as regularly updating their infection chain. Of\nnote, spearphishing remains the principal observed vector of intrusion in these Intrusion Sets malicious cyber activities.\n\nIn a campaign against South Korean diplomacy and security-related entities, Kimsuky impersonated a South Korean institution\nto engage in an email exchange, sending a malicious URL only if the recipient responds positively to the initial email. Similarly,\nLazarus was observed hosting a ZIP file containing a malicious document to bypass recent changes made by Microsoft for\nOffice macros [23] . Also increasingly reported is the hosting of malicious Command and Control (C2) on open-source\n**hosting services such as DropBox, GitHub or Blogspot.**\n\nOf particular interest and documented as a first seen in the wild in 2022 (although leveraged at least since October 2021 as\npart of Operation DreamJob), Lazarus’ Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique to deploy BLINDINGCAN [24].\nLazarus was also observed leveraging CVE-2022-0609, a 0-day remote code execution vulnerability in Google Chrome web\nbrowser to target cryptocurrency and fintech entities through spearphishing, fake websites, or compromised legitimate\nwebsites.\n\nThese TTPs are a sign of adaptability by North Korea-nexus Intrusion Sets, and SEKOIA.IO analysts assess this is almost\ncertainly a way to preserve their offensive capabilities.\n\n## Household objects\n\nOver the course of this year, North Korea-nexus Intrusion Sets continuously dedicated efforts to update and / or renew their\n**toolsets. Notable changes to SEKOIA.IO analysts include:**\n\nLazarus recent development of KiTTY, a weaponized PuTTY fork, as part of its BLINDINGCAN infection chain [25].\n**MagicRAT, a new C++ malware delivered after exploitation of publicly exposed VMware Horizon platforms [26].**\nAs touched upon before, Kimsuky was observed leveraging new Android malware known as FastFire, FastViewer, and\n**FastSpy. Another interesting malicious web browser extension used by Kimsuky is Sharpext, used by Kimsuky a post-**\nexploitation tool since 2021 [27].\n\n## Is there anybody out there?\n\n**Us and them**\n\nIn 2022, open-source reports mentioned overlaps between DPRK Intrusion Sets and cybercriminal groups, including:\n\n**Suspected links between Lazarus and Wizard Spider**\n\nBased on infrastructure links, security researchers initially assessed a potential connection between Russia-based\ncybercriminal group Wizard Spider and Lazarus [28]. Based on the report documenting the Exotic Lily Initial Access Broker\n(IAB), SEKOIA.IO assess it is likely that Lazarus resorted to IAB services, including Exotic Lily’s, and entertain connections\nwith the cybercriminal ecosystem.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Connections between Quantum Builder and Lazarus**\n\nA report published in open sources in June 2022 mentioned a possible use of the .lnk builder Quantum Software / Quantum\nBuilder by Lazarus [29]. Upon script comparison, it was observed the PowerShell script deobfuscation loop and initialization of\nvariables were similar. As Lazarus increasingly resorted to .lnk since the second half of 2020, SEKOIA analysts assess it is\n**plausible they use Quantum Builder as part of their toolset.**\n\n**Connections between DEV-0530 and Andariel**\n\nTracked under the DEV-0530 alias, the cybercriminal group which developed the H0lyGh0st ransomware is assessed to be\noriginating from the DPRK [30]. Microsoft security researchers assess that DEV-0530 “has connections” with Andariel. This\nassessment is notably based on the observation of communication between DEV-0530 email accounts and Andariel accounts,\ninfrastructure links, as well as DEV0530’s use of tools exclusively used by Andariel. SEKOIA.IO analysts concur with Microsoft\nhypothesis of moonlighting activities. It is likely that DEV-0530 is an offshoot of Andariel.\n\n## Wish you were here\n\nIn 2022, the DPRK cyber offensive strategy continued relying on the physical layer.\n\nIn April 2022, two South Korean individuals, the CEO of a virtual asset investment company and an active-duty officer, were\ncharged with violating the South Korea National Security Act for leaking military information to a suspected North Korean agent\n\n[32]. The operation reportedly involved a camera watch and a PoisonTap USB device [33] to infiltrate a South Korean military\nbase and gain access to a military laptop between January and March 2022.\n\nIn May 2022, the U.S. Department of State issued an advisory, alerting organisations against hiring North Korean IT workers\n\n[34].\n\nThis highlights that North Korean intelligence operatives continue leveraging individuals, including insider threats, that will\nnotably assist in obtaining access to systems of interest. SEKOIA.IO assess that part of stolen cryptocurrency plausibly\ncontributes to fund incentives for such operations. Furthermore, it is also possible that North Korean IT workers abroad could\nleverage the acquired skills to carry out malicious campaigns in line with Pyongyang interests.\n\n## The Sanction bell\n\nIn 2022, DPRK-associated cyber malicious activities garnered increased attention, in a context of heightened tensions in\n**the Korean Peninsula.**\n\nIn January, North Korea’s Internet was hit by two waves of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks [35] which turned out to\nbe a hackback carried out by a hacker in retaliation to Lazarus DreamJob campaign [36].\n\nIn addition, Nation-State political and economic measures were undertaken. SEKOIA.IO analysts notably observed a more\ncoordinated, time-constrained approach to the attribution process and efforts to hinder malicious cyber activities. U.S. agencies\nofficially attributed the TraderTraitor campaign to Bluenoroff, the Maui ransomware to Andariel [37], and the Ronin Network\ncryptocurrency theft to Lazarus.\n\nIn March 2022, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned Blender.io, a virtual currency mixer, used by Lazarus to launder\nUSD 20.5 million (out of the USD 620 million stolen) on the account of financially supporting DPRK [38]. In August 2022, the\nU.S. also blacklisted Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer used by Lazarus to launder at least USD 7 billion worth of virtual\n\n\n-----\n\ncurrency since its creation in 2019 [39]. This was followed by the arrest of a Tornado Cash developer in the Netherlands by the\nFiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) [40].\n\n## Assessements\n\nBased on DPRK-nexus Intrusion Sets reported activities, SEKOIA.IO analysts assess the following:\n\nIt is almost certain financially motivated cyber campaigns will remain a high priority for Pyongyang. DPRK-nexus\nIntrusion Sets lucrative activities will continue in the short-to-medium term, with a consistent targeting of cryptocurrency\nand fintech related entities and individuals. It is likely Lazarus and Bluenoroff will expand their victimology to include\n**countries inclined to legalise cryptocurrency and / or where cryptocurrency is a legal tender (i.e., Ecuador, Central**\nAfrica, Salvador).\nIt is almost certain that military intelligence, strategic intelligence, and economic intelligence collection and surveillance\nwill remain strong drivers for DPRK-originating cyberespionage campaigns. This notably includes continuation of the longrunning campaign DreamJob.\nWhile ongoing sanction measures are likely to slow down DPRK Intrusion Sets activities in the short-term, SEKOIA.IO\nanalysts assess this is unlikely to disrupt cyber malicious campaigns orchestrated by Pyongyang.\n\nSEKOIA.IO will continue monitoring and tracking Intrusion Sets associated to DPRK and welcome any feedback and / or\nadditional input to further contribute to understanding and countering this threat.\n\n## External References\n\n[1] [[Nikkei] North Korea targeted IAEA in cyberattacks: draft U.N. report.](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/N-Korea-at-crossroads/North-Korea-targeted-IAEA-in-cyberattacks-draft-U.N.-report)\n\n[2] [[Ahnlab] Attack on word documents targeting companies specializing in carbon emissions.](https://asec.ahnlab.com/ko/32765/)\n\n[3] [[ESET] (Are you) afreight of the dark?
