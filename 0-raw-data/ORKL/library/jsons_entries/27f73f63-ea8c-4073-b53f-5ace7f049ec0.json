Going beyond indiscriminately going after their victims, operators running\n\nransomware families like REvil[1] and Conti[2] eschewed automated attacks in favor of a more hands-on,\n\nlong-haul approach to carefully tailor their campaigns to entities in critical industries.\n\nTargeted attacks gained popularity among different kinds of malicious actors, including those in\n\ncyberespionage and cybermercenary groups, who were armed with upgraded toolboxes that made\n\ntheir operations even more effective. Attacks from the likes of Void Balaur[3] and Tropic Trooper[4]\n\ndemonstrated how these groups were capable of developing customized tools and were adept at red\n\nteamwork. Phishing scams remained a staple in these cyberattacks, in part because the influx of news\n\nabout the global pandemic gave malicious actors ideas for new lures that resonated with a wider pool\n\nof potential victims.\n\nAny cracks in an organization’s security posture could be devastating for business continuity, as could\n\nbe seen from the rise in and impact of critical vulnerabilities in 2021. The growth of the underground\n\nexploit market proved that, left unpatched, older flaws could still inflict as much damage on infected\n\nsystems as newly discovered ones. Malicious actors continued to employ flaws both old and new in\n\ntheir campaigns, as in the Squirrelwaffle loader’s use of the ProxyLogon and ProxyShell vulnerabilities,[5]\n\nand the Khonsari ransomware attacks that incorporated the Log4Shell vulnerability.[6]\n\nPressing security issues also continued to plague organizations-turned-cloud-adopters. Most of the\n\nchallenges in cloud security in 2021 could be attributed to misconfigurations in the setup of cloud\n\nenvironments, as evidenced by how TeamTNT abused incorrectly configured servers to compromise\n\nDocker Hub accounts. TeamTNT was one of the first cybercriminal groups to focus primarily on cloud\n\nservice providers (CSPs), signaling a growing interest in the cloud within cybercriminal circles.\n\nFrom large-scale ransomware campaigns to high-risk vulnerabilities, the far-reaching impact of these\n\nsecurity incidents showed that no user, enterprise, or industry was immune to compromise. The\n\nmassive disruptions caused by high-profile attacks underscored the need for visibility over the ever-\n\nevolving attack surface across an organization’s entire digital infrastructure. The defenses that might\n\nhave sufficed in a prepandemic world stood to be reevaluated, if not redefined, in the face of mounting\n\nrisks that could be averted only by an adaptive threat monitoring, detection, and response strategy\n\nwith which organizations could continuously assess and enhance their security postures.\n\nThis annual cybersecurity report explores the notable events and emerging trends that shaped the\n\ncybersecurity landscape of 2021, during which Trend Micro protected its customers from over 94\n\nbillion threats. We hope that this roundup can provide organizations and end users alike with valuable\n\ninsights they can use to make informed decisions about their security infrastructure and policies as\n\nthey navigate and move forward in an ever-changing threat landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Modern Ransomware Actors Continue to Target Critical Industries\n\nOver the years, we have observed how ransomware has evolved significantly. In 2018, a spray-and-pray\n\nstrategy was the norm among malicious actors, who wanted to profit from as many victims as possible.[7]\n\nHowever, our researchers foresaw how ransomware operators would pivot away from such a quantity\nbased tactic and become more deliberate in their movements.[8] Notably, in 2021 ransomware operators\n\nstaged attacks on more profitable targets, leading to business disruptions with real-world ramifications\n\nfelt on a global scale.[9]\n\nAlready strained by the pandemic, healthcare organizations were hit hard by ransomware attacks in 2021,\n\nwhich were just behind the banking and government industries in terms of ransomware detections. A\n\n2021 report suggests that because healthcare organizations are less likely to back up their data than\n\nthose in other industries, they are more prone to paying the demands of ransomware actors.[10] Moreover,\n\nthe healthcare industry has a trove of data that attackers seek to sell or use for extortion, including patient\n\nrecords with social security numbers, medical histories, and financial information.[11]\n\n\n###### Banking\n\n Government\n\n Manufacturing\n\n\n###### 2020\n\n20,986\n\n15,234\n\n7,768\n\n0 5K 10K 15K 20K 25K\n\n\n###### Government\n\n Banking\n\n Healthcare\n\n\n###### 2021\n\n19,570\n\n16,894\n\n12,477\n\n0 5K 10K 15K 20K 25K\n\n\nFigure 1. The top three industries in terms of ransomware file detections in 2021 and 2020\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\n\n-----\n\nAttempted WannaCry infections topped the list of ransomware detections across all three of the most\n\naffected industries, outpacing other ransomware families by a wide margin. The spray-and-pray approach\n\nused by legacy ransomware like WannaCry might account for its large volume of attacks, but notably,\n\nmodern ransomware gained ground.\n\n\n###### Government\n\n WannaCry 16,969\n\n GandCrab 96\n\n Cerber 86\n\n0 5K 10K 15K 20K\n\n\n###### Banking\n\n WannaCry 15,640\n\n GandCrab 103\n\n MountLocker 66\n\n0 5K 10K 15K 20K\n\n\n###### Healthcare\n\n WannaCry 4,930\n\n LockBit 550\n\n Maze 338\n\n0 5K 10K 15K 20K\n\n\nFigure 2. The top three ransomware families that affected the top three affected industries in 2021\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\nUnlike their premodern counterparts, modern ransomware groups displayed erratic activity as they closed\n\nin on specific targets rather than cast a wide net,[12] which is most likely why we observed a 21% decrease\n\nin overall ransomware detections in 2021. We observed several modern ransomware groups ramp up their\n\nactivities last year: Year-on-year detections of REvil (also known as Sodinokibi) soared by 143%, there\n\nwere over 20 times as many detections of LockBit in 2021 as there were in 2020, and detections of Conti\n\nrose more than ninefold from the previous year.\n\n\n**2020** **2021**\n\n\n###### REvil\n\n LockBit\n\n Conti\n\n\n###### 143%\n\n 2,035%\n\n 862%\n\n\n###### 2,035\n\n\n%\n\n\n0 1K 2K 3K 4K 5K 6K\n\nFigure 3. A year-on-year comparison of the top three modern ransomware families\nin terms of file detections in 2020 and 2021\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother factor that might have played into the decline in ransomware detections was the marked increase\n\nin our detections and blocking of malware tools like the Cobalt Strike beacon CoBeacon, the trojan\n\nTrickbot, and the information stealer BazarLoader. Our blocking of larger numbers of these affiliate tools\n\nmight have prevented ransomware operators from staging full-blown attacks in 2021, as the presence of\n\nsuch tools is an early indicator of infection. In 2021, there was an eightfold rise in detections of CoBeacon,\n\nwhich had been abused by operators of ransomware families such as DoppelPaymer, Povlsomware, and\n\nRyuk.[13] Detections of Trickbot, which had been linked to the Conti ransomware[14] as well as Ryuk,[15] saw\n\na 23% year-on-year increase. Most notably, detections in 2021 of BazarLoader, which had been used to\n\ngain initial access to systems by the likes of Conti[16] and Ryuk,[17] were up by 2,468% from the previous year.\n\nBecause modern ransomware has more human involvement, collaboration among cybercriminals has\n\ngained traction in the underground, as evidenced by the rising trend of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS).\n\nRaaS affiliate programs have been beneficial for all cybercriminal parties involved: By bringing partners\n\nonboard to divide the labor, ransomware actors can more efficiently profit from a victim’s compromised\n\nassets.[18] The proliferation of RaaS has not only made ransomware more accessible even to malicious\n\nactors with limited technical knowledge but also given rise to higher specialization within the cybercrime\n\necosystem. In splitting the work among themselves, RaaS affiliates have been able to hone their skills and\n\nfocus on certain specialties like penetrating networks or running the malware.[19]\n\nThe widespread use of RaaS is a result of the ongoing evolution of the flourishing cybercrime-as-a-service\n\nmarket, which continues to develop new business models for attackers. One such development is the\n\ngrowing demand for access-as-a-service (AaaS), with access brokers peddling stolen credentials in the\n\ncriminal underground and finding reliable customers in ransomware actors, who use their wares to infect\n\ntarget systems.[20]\n\nAnother trend that has caught on within cybercriminal circles is the incorporation of double extortion, in\n\nwhich ransomware actors not only demand a sum to restore access to a victim’s encrypted files but also\n\nthreaten to release the sensitive data upon failure of payment. This tactic was first perpetrated in 2019 by\n\nthe Maze ransomware and has since become even more widely used. As of June 2021, as many as 35\n\nransomware families employed double extortion. Some, including REvil and Conti, augmented their RaaS\n\noperations with this extortion technique to pursue big-name targets.[21]\n\nSince it was discovered by Cisco Talos in 2019, REvil has become one of the most active RaaS families.[22]\n\nIn 2021, it continued its use of double extortion on multinational enterprises like Apple,[23] JBS,[24] and\n\nKaseya[25] to great effect. The bulk of REvil attacks took place in the US, but countries like Mexico and\n\nGermany were also affected.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our telemetry, REvil attacks were aimed at critical industries. Most were levied against the\n\ntransportation industry, followed by organizations in the financial and the oil and gas industries. In our\n\nreport on ransomware activity during the first half of 2021, we posited that the transportation industry\n\nbore the brunt of REvil attacks likely because it played an important part in global supply chains and\n\nlogistics.[26]\n\nREvil’s customized attacks suggest that its operators have extensive knowledge of their targets’ IT\n\nenvironments. The efficiency of REvil can also be attributed to its diverse toolbox. This includes the use\n\nof Qakbot, AdFind, BloodHound, and other third-party sync tools, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities\n\nlike CVE-2021-30116, which affects Kaseya VSA servers; CVE-2019-2725, a deserialization vulnerability\n\nin Oracle WebLogic; the FortiGate SSL VPN flaw CVE-2018-13379; and the Pulse Secure SSL VPN\n\nvulnerability CVE-2019-11510.[27]\n\nInitial Execution and lateral movement Defense evasion,\naccess discovery\n\nPsExec\n\nRDP/Valid accounts\n\nPC Hunter\n\nExploit\n\nREvil/Sodinokibi Process Hacker\nransomware\n\nSpam email Download and execution\n\nKillAV\n\nDrive-by compromise CertUtil PowerShell Macro\n\nFigure 4. REvil’s infection chain\n\nAnother notorious RaaS, called Conti, which we believe to be a successor of Ryuk, was behind many\n\ndebilitating attacks around the world in 2021.[28] In the US alone, there were more than a million Conti\n\nattacks between January 1 and November 12, 2021.[29] As noted in our 2021 midyear cybersecurity report,\n\nthis modern ransomware family had the tenth highest number of attack attempts during the first half of\n\n2021.[30] The bulk of these occurred in the US, followed by the Netherlands and Taiwan. Retail organizations\n\nexperienced the most Conti attacks. The insurance, manufacturing, and telecommunications industries\n\nwere also hit hard, but Conti’s high-profile attacks on healthcare organizations was what made major\n\nheadlines last year.[31]\n\n\n-----\n\nLike REvil’s, Conti’s operators also take advantage of double extortion, threatening to release stolen\n\ndata and selling access to infected systems if their victims fail to pay the ransom. They employ a variety\n\nof exploits, such as those of the PrintNightmare and Zerologon vulnerabilities, and tools and malware,\n\nincluding familiar names like BazarLoader, Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, and Rclone. Working in concert,\n\nthese enable Conti operators to gain remote access to a targeted system, disable the system’s security\n\nsoftware, locate and exfiltrate valuable data, and encrypt files to make them inaccessible until the ransom\n\ndemand is met.\n\n###### Impact\n\n**Initial entry and execution** **Privilege escalation** **Command and control**\n\n**Conti**\n\nPrintNightmare Valid accounts\n\nFirewall Zerologon\nexploit Cobalt Strike AnyDesk\n\n**Lateral movement and**\n**defense evasion**\n\nPhishing email BazarLoader/ **Credential access** **Lateral movement**\n\nBazarBackdoor\n\nCreate scheduled Cobeacon, KillAV, Conti\ntask on remote systems\n\nKerberoasting Net-GPPPassword\n\nKerberoasting AnyDesk\n\n**Network discovery**\n\nKillAV\n\nProcDump ProcDump\n\nProcDump PSExec\n\nNetscan ShareFinder\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\nRclone\n\nFigure 5. Conti’s infection chain\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cloud Adopters and Remote Workers Contend With Rising\n Threats to Cloud Environments  \n\nThreats to cloud security were among the most pressing IT infrastructure risks for organizations in 2021,\n\naccording to the Cyber Risk Index for the first half of 2021.[32] Protecting their cloud architecture is a challenge\n\nfor companies because many of the technologies that compose this architecture are regularly updated\n\nwith new features.[33] On top of these complexities, defenders must keep up with the tools malicious actors\n\nuse to target the cloud, which are also constantly changing. For instance, in 2019, steganography, or the\n\npractice of hiding code within an image, was a trend in cloud attacks.[34] The following year, malicious\n\nactors used valid and clean images that downloaded malware onto affected systems after deployment.\n\nAnd as detailed in our midyear cybersecurity report, in 2021 attackers reverted to using images with\n\nmalicious content.[35]\n\n#### Malicious Actors Continue to Take Advantage of Cloud Misconfigurations\n\nThe cloud has helped many organizations accelerate their digital transformations and embrace remote work\n\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic. Spending on cloud infrastructure, including cloud computing and storage\n\nsolutions, saw a 6.6% year-on-year increase in the third quarter of 2021, which amounted to US$18.6\n\nbillion, and 2021 saw an overall growth in cloud-related expenditure, according to the International Data\n\nCorporation.[36]\n\nHowever, malicious actors were quick to capitalize on this push toward digitization, as securing the cloud\n\ncomes with its share of complexities. Cloud environments continued to be at risk of compromise at the\n\nhands of cybercriminals who were out to abuse any misconfigurations, which proved to be major weak\n\nspots of cloud security even though CSPs had endeavored to make cloud services safer by recommending\n\nthat all customers follow the shared responsibility model.[37]\n\nFortifying the security postures of cloud environments that use services like those of Amazon Web Services\n\n(AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) — the three biggest CSPs in the world[38] —\n\nshould be a top priority for cloud adopters, for whom misconfigurations might not only lead to costly data\n\nbreaches but also run up expenses from idle instances and unused storage.[39] According to 2021 data\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom Trend Micro Cloud One™ – Conformity, Amazon Elastic Block Store, a block storage service, had\n\nthe highest number of configuration failures among AWS services, with a misconfiguration rate of 29%.\n\nVirtual Machines had the most misconfigurations among Azure services, with a 65% misconfiguration\n\nrate, while Identity and Access Management (IAM) pulled in the most misconfigurations among GCP\n\nservices, with a 98% misconfiguration rate.\n\n\n30,920,763\nrule failures\n29%\nmisconfiguration\nrate\n\n\n2,671,588\nrule failures\n35%\n\n**7,531,008** misconfiguration\nrule checks rate\n\n**Amazon Simple Storage Service**\n**(Amazon S3)**\n\n\n2,569,233\nrule failures\n44%\nmisconfiguration\nrate\n\n\n**104,822,208**\nrule checks\n\n\n**5,819,174**\nrule checks\n\n\n**Amazon Elastic Block Store**\n**(Amazon EBS)**\n\n\n**7,531,008**\nrule checks\n\n\n**AWS CloudFormation**\n\n\nFigure 6.

Incorrectly\n\nconfigured servers with exposed Docker REST APIs became a prime target for the cybercriminal group\n\nTeamTNT, which abused the Docker REST APIs by using compromised Docker Hub accounts to deploy\n\nmalware like cryptocurrency miners.[40]\n\nThe growing adoption of cloud-based software and services has put the cloud in the crosshairs of malicious\n\nactor groups like TeamTNT, which was among the first groups to target CSPs in their campaigns, primarily\n\nto steal CSPs’ environmental metadata. Upon analyzing their recent campaigns, we found that the group\n\nhad augmented its repertoire of tools, which enabled it to launch more modular attacks on specific\n\nvictims. [41]\n\nScanner List of targets Scan results Exploitable security Payload delivery\n(e.g., IP addresses) weakness\n\nExploitable Victim\nsecurity weakness\n\nFigure 9. TeamTNT’s attack chain\n\nThis group was also the perpetrator behind a cryptocurrency-mining and credential theft campaign\n\nthat targeted Kubernetes, a widely used container management platform, from March to May 2021.\n\nBy exploiting a role-based access control misconfiguration as an entry point for its attacks, TeamTNT\n\nwas able to take over multiple Kubernetes clusters. This resulted in the compromise of nearly 50,000 IP\n\naddresses, most of which were in China and the US.[42]\n\n#### Email Threats Climb as More Organizations Adopt Remote Work \n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, internet and email usage had been even more instrumental for business\n\ncontinuity and remote work. As email became an even more useful tool for people around the world who\n\nwere working from home, malicious actors seized the opportunity to take advantage of remote workers’\n\nincreased dependence on online communication. In 2021, Trend Micro Cloud App Security, an API-based\n\nsolution that protects both users and organizations from threats to their cloud-based apps and services,\n\ndetected and blocked more than 25.7 million email threats, a marked increase from the over 16.7 million\n\nthreats that the solution detected and blocked the previous year.\n\n\n-----\n\nEmail remained an oft-used avenue for cybercriminals to stage their attacks. In fact, 92% of malware\n\nwas delivered through email in 2021.[43] Phishing emails in particular were responsible for 90% of 2021’s\n\ndata breaches.[44] Phishing campaigns persisted as an effective means to spread malware, especially\n\nransomware, in 2021, as proved by the enduring success of Emotet, the notorious botnet-malware\nturned-RaaS. Authorities took down Emotet in November 2021, but its absence was short-lived, as it\n\nresurfaced toward the end of the year.[45] Its yearslong use by ransomware groups like Ryuk and trojans like\n\nTrickbot showed how much the underground economy had grown and continued to evolve, to the point\n\nthat it eventually developed its own supply chain.[46]\n\nPhishing attempts that were detected and blocked by Trend Micro Cloud App Security in 2021 nearly\n\ndoubled from those in 2020. Of these, 62% were from spam emails, which increased nearly sevenfold\n\nfrom the previous year. The remaining 38% were credential-phishing attempts, which grew by 14% from\n\n2020. (Credential phishing involves cybercriminals’ use of fake login pages to gull potential victims into\n\nhanding over their account credentials, whereas phishing by spam email is a broader category that aims\n\nto get user information.) The finance industry experienced the most phishing attempts, followed closely\n\nby the healthcare and education industries.\n\n\n###### Spam phishing\n\n Credential phishing\n\n\n**2020**\n\n**2021**\n\n\n0 2M 4M 6M 8M 10M 12M\n\nFigure 10.

Though there were\n\nfewer BEC attempt detections in 2021, Trend Micro Cloud App Security found and blocked 133,541 BEC\n\nemails using authorship analysis, while the remaining 149,234 were detected using behavior and intention\n\nanalysis. The former, which could be detected only by comparing the spoofing email with the writing\n\nstyle of the supposed sender, made up 47% of all BEC attempts in 2021, whereas the 73,210 that were\n\ndetected in 2020 composed only 23% of all BEC attempts found that year.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2020\n\n 2021\n\n\n###### Authorship analysis\n\n Behavior and intention analysis\n\n\n0 50K 150K 250K 350K\n\nFigure 12.

While many businesses struggled during the pandemic, this industry continued to grow and is\n\nexpected to be valued at over US$11.9 trillion by 2025, which might explain why it had been in the\n\ncrosshairs of attackers.[49] Retail companies were also on the receiving end of many emails with malware.\n\nRetailers drew the attention of more attackers after the industry experienced rapid growth when online\n\nsales surged as a result of the pandemic.[50] Malicious email attachments were also a common means for\n\ncybercriminals to carry out attacks on construction firms, which were appealing targets because of their\n\nvaluable intellectual properties, such as blueprints, that could be used to bypass buildings’ security.[51]\n\n\n###### Information and communication\n\n Retail\n\n Construction\n\n Finance\n\n Manufacturing\n\n Healthcare\n\n Technology\n\n Transportation\n\n Others\n\n\n###### 561,753\n\n 397,072\n\n 356,952\n\n 198,408\n\n 188,373\n\n 150,002\n\n 148,090\n\n 143,625\n\n 146,499\n\n0 100K 200K 300K 400K 500K 600K\n\n\nFigure 14.

An enduring threat that has plagued organizations as far back as\n\n2012,[52] targeted attacks require a high level of technical expertise and a plethora of resources on the part\n\nof threat actors, because the tools and techniques involved need to be tailored to the intended victims’\n\nsystems.[53]\n\nDuring the first half of 2021, we observed a shift to more targeted modern ransomware that veered\n\naway from quantity-based attacks and toward more profitable prey,[54] as more cybercriminals resorted to\n\nincreasingly advanced tools and techniques that pointed to a targeted approach. Not only can this kind\n\nof attack have a direct impact on the targeted organization, but its effects can also be felt by the victim’s\n\ncustomers because of any resulting business disruption or customer information leakage.[55] The threat\n\nactors behind a targeted attack may be financially motivated, but its main goal is data theft.[56]\n\n#### Void Balaur Stages Attacks on Government Entities and Other Targets\n\nAlso known as Rockethack, Void Balaur is a cybermercenary group that deals largely in data theft and\n\ncyberespionage, advertising its services in the Russian-speaking cybercriminal underground through\n\nforums and websites like Darkmoney and Probiv. In past years, we observed this group launch attacks on\n\nthe telecommunications, retail, financial, medical, and biotechnology industries. They continued pursuing\n\ntelecommunications organizations in 2021, when we discovered that Void Balaur had been targeting\n\nengineers and management officers of various Russian and UK telecommunications outfits.[57]\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the hackers-for-hire behind the group are driven by monetary gain, they have also frequently\n\ntargeted journalists, human rights activists, and government officials. For instance, in September 2021,\n\nwe found Void Balaur targeting a former head of an intelligence agency, two members of the national\n\nparliament, and five active government ministers of an Eastern European country. This suggests that\n\ntheir activities might play into a larger campaign on multiple fronts to cause widespread disruption. Many\n\nof their targets are based in Russia and its neighboring countries, although Void Balaur activity has also\n\nbeen spotted in other European countries, the US, Japan, and Israel.\n\nAmong Void Balaur’s main services is hacking into email and social media accounts. For a higher fee, the\n\ngroup can also supply the complete copies of stolen email inboxes without the users’ knowledge. In 2019,\n\nit began selling the confidential information of Russian individuals, such as their criminal records, credit\n\nhistories, bank statements, text messages, and passport and flight data. Void Balaur uses specialized\n\nmalware like Z*Stealer and DroidWatcher, capable of remote tracking, accessing location information,\n\nand stealing user credentials for different apps and digital currency wallets.[58]\n\n#### Tropic Trooper Returns to Attack the Transportation and Government Industries\n\nThe cyberespionage group Tropic Trooper, which now goes by Earth Centaur, has been active since\n\n2011 but it resurfaced in July 2020 with new tools, including modified remote access trojans (RATs).\n\nToward the end of 2020 and continuing in 2021, we observed it using these tools to target transportation\n\nbusinesses and transport-related government organizations.[59] Its attacks commonly involve information\n\ntheft — including that of financial documents, search histories, and flight schedules — from compromised\n\nsystems. Based on our analysis, we predict that Tropic Trooper will continue gathering confidential data\n\nwhile waiting for the opportune time to capitalize on it.\n\nTropic Trooper usually breaches its victims’ systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in their Microsoft Internet\n\nInformation Services and Exchange servers, and then installing web shells that execute backdoors\n\nsuch as ChiserClient and SmileSvr. The group uses a customized variant of Gh0st RAT to discover and\n\ncollect information from active sessions on an infected host, which it then exfiltrates using the victim’s\n\ncompromised intranet.\n\nThe threat actors behind Tropic Trooper have proved themselves talented at red teamwork. By using\n\nopen-source frameworks, they have developed various backdoors with different protocols, which they\n\nhave used to bypass their victims’ security settings. They also employ reverse proxies to avoid detection\n\nby network security systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### More Malicious Actors Use BazarLoader as an Arrival Mechanism\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, we observed an uptick in the use of BazarLoader, an information stealer\n\nand loader that we detected as TrojanSpy.Win64.BAZARLOADER and Backdoor.Win64.BAZARLOADER.\n\nThe highest detections of BazarLoader took place in the Americas region.[60]\n\nSince it was first observed in 2020,[61] BazarLoader has been used by cybercriminals to gain initial access\n\nfor data theft or to deploy second-stage malware like ransomware. Between January and October 2021,\n\nBazarLoader campaigns that used malicious spam emails as an arrival mechanism primarily targeted the\n\nUS, followed by select European and Asian countries. Most of these emails took the form of fraudulent\n\norder invoices and notices of service plan termination. On the other hand, campaigns that used JavaScript\n\ndroppers to deliver BazarLoader over the same period focused on targets in the US and Australia.\n\nNotably, malicious actors use different arrival mechanisms to deliver BazarLoader as part of their attacks.\n\nIn one method, BazarLoader is bundled with a legitimate program and deployed using a software installer,\n\nsuch as that for VLC and TeamViewer. Its delivery mechanism possibly involves social engineering as\n\na means of tricking victims into downloading the compromised installer. A BazarLoader executable is\n\nthen dropped while the installer is loading. The installer creates a process that runs the BazarLoader\n\nexecutable and then establishes a connection with a command-and-control (C&C) server using Microsoft\n\nEdge.\n\nOther malicious actors favor a method that involves delivery by way of an ISO file that contains a Windows\n\nLNK (link) file. The LNK file is disguised as a folder icon to trick a victim into clicking it, which runs its\n\nBazarLoader dynamic-link library (DLL) payload.\n\n#### Qakbot Reemerges With an Improved Variant\n\nDiscovered in 2007,[62] the information stealer Qakbot, which is detected by Trend Micro as\n\nTrojanSpy.Win32.QAKBOT, has become popular among ransomware operators as a piece of malware\ninstallation-as-a-service botnet malware for their campaigns. In 2019, Qakbot infections were used in the\n\ndeployment of manually operated ransomware families like MegaCortex, PwndLocker, Egregor, ProLock,\n\nand, most recently, REvil/Sodinokibi.[63]\n\nFollowing a three-month hiatus, Qakbot operators resumed their email spam run in September 2021.\n\nTheir campaign returned with a new version of Qakbot that uses Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)\n\nmacros as well as Excel 4.0 macros. Over the past years, we observed that spam campaigns linked to\n\nQakbot operators mainly targeted the telecommunications, technology, and education industries. Among\n\nthe top countries affected by these campaigns were the US, Japan, and Germany.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Buer Loader Becomes Better at Evading Detection\n\nBuer Loader’s competitive pricing made it the malware loader of choice for many threat actors when it\n\nwas introduced in the underground market in 2019. It remains active to this day and has been used by\n\nthreat actors to deploy well-known malware such as Ryuk, Wizard Spider, and the Cobalt Strike beacon\n\nas part of targeted ransomware attacks.[64] We found that Buer Loader was most active in India, followed\n\nby Israel, and that detections of the loader were highest among organizations in the healthcare, banking,\n\nand telecommunications industries.\n\nIn 2021, a new variant of Buer Loader, written in Rust, was used in spam runs that involved emails\n\nwith malicious attachments containing the loader. One campaign used emails that masqueraded as DHL\n\nshipping notices, while succeeding campaigns mentioned Covid-19 in their emails as a lure or referenced\n\nboth DHL and Covid-19. The Buer Loader variant used in these emails retains most of the same code as\n\nin previous variants, but it was likely rewritten in a new programming language to avoid detection. This\n\nupdated variant also uses signed XLL (Excel add-in) files as another way to stay under the radar of their\n\nvictims’ IT teams.\n\n#### Water Basilisk Uses New Crypter Tool to Flood Systems With RATs\n\nAugust 2021 saw the height of activity for a fileless attack campaign called Water Basilisk, which bombards\n\nits victims’ systems with RATs — including BitRat, NjRat, LimeRat, Warzone, QuasarRat, and Nanocore\n\nRAT — through a new HCrypt variant.[65] The operators behind Water Basilisk use this crypter-as-a-service\n\nto make obfuscated VBScript and PowerShell scripts that deploy their malicious payloads. We have\n\nobserved Water Basilisk incidents that involve PowerShell scripts containing as many as seven RATs.[66]\n\nWater Basilisk actors have been hosting their malware and phishing kits on publicly accessible file-hosting\n\nservices and compromised WordPress websites. They use these WordPress websites or phishing emails\n\nto disseminate a malicious ISO image. This image has an obfuscated VBScript stager that downloads and\n\nexecutes next-stage VBScript content into an infected system. Finally, PowerShell scripts deobfuscate\n\nand deploy their payload RATs in a given process.\n\nThe HCrypt version that Water Basilisk uses to propagate its malware is sold in underground markets for\n\nUS$199. Our analysis suggests that more variants of this crypter tool, which continues to be updated\n\nby its developers, will be introduced in the future, and these can contain even more RATs and have an\n\nupdated obfuscation algorithm to evade detection more effectively.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Rising Vulnerabilities Leave Unpatched Systems Exposed to More Risks\n\nThe intricacies of modern IT infrastructures make patch management essential for business operations to\n\nrun smoothly, but this is easier said than done: On average, it takes 200 days to fix a vulnerability, and 256\n\ndays if the flaw is rated severe.[67] In an ideal world, organizations routinely update the software they rely on\n\nand their own security policies. But this is a tall order for IT teams that are already spread thin, especially\n\nbecause tracking updates is but one of their many everyday tasks.[68]\n\n#### Older Flaws Stay Relevant as Malicious Actors Bank on Unprotected IT Environments\n\nIn 2021, Trend Micro™ Zero Day Initiative™ (ZDI), a part of Trend Micro Research, released advisories\n\non 1,604 vulnerabilities, which was 10% higher than the corresponding number from the previous year.\n\nAmong these, 54 were rated with critical severity, a significant decrease from the 173 critical vulnerabilities\n\nof 2020. However, 2021 did see an increase in those rated with high severity, rising to 1,138 from the\n\nprevious year’s 983.\n\n\n-----\n\n1,200\n\n###### 983\n\n 187\n 173\n\n\n###### 1,138\n\n 264\n\n\n###### 173\n 148\n 110 54\n\n0\n\n###### 2020 2021\n\n\nFigure 15. A comparison of the proportions of Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) ratings\namong vulnerabilities disclosed by Trend Micro’s ZDI program in 2020 and 2021\n\n_Source: Trend Micro™ Zero Day Initiative™_\n\nMany legacy vulnerabilities have stayed in use, as there remains a demand for them in the underground\n\nexploit market. In fact, our 2021 study found that 22% of the exploits sold in the underground were over\n\nthree years old.[69] Such exploits have been a reliable source of income for malicious actors, who can sell\n\nthem in underground forums, with prices starting at US$1,000.[70]\n\nData from Trend Micro™ TippingPoint[®] Threat Protection System, a network security platform deployed\n\nat some of the largest organizations in the world, shows that malicious actors also exploited relatively\n\nnew vulnerabilities alongside older ones, with some dating as far back as 2005, despite the availability\n\nof patches for these flaws. There are familiar names in the list of vulnerabilities with the highest exploit\n\ncounts in 2021; seven of these have been extensively abused by cybercriminals and have ranked among\n\nthe most exploited flaws since 2017.\n\nFar and away the highest number of exploit detections in 2021 was of CVE-2019-1225, which amounted\n\nto over 75 million found by Trend Micro. CVE-2019-1225 is a memory disclosure flaw in Microsoft’s\n\nRemote Desktop Services that was disclosed in August 2019.[71] Successful exploits of this vulnerability\n\nallow attackers to gather information that they can use to further compromise victims’ systems. Coming\n\nin second was the critical vulnerability CVE-2017-14100. Found in Asterisk, a software implementation\n\nof a private branch exchange from Digium, this flaw accounted for more than 20 million detections in\n\n2021. Exploits of this flaw, which was disclosed in September 2017, allow unauthorized users to remotely\n\nperform arbitrary shell command injections.[72]\n\n\n-----\n\n|CVE ID number|Affected product|Rule ID|Hits|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|CVE-2019-1225|Windows RDP server|DV-36042|75,267,406|\n|CVE-2017-14100|Asterisk 11|DV-29739|20,846,194|\n|CVE-2011-1264|Microsoft Windows Server|DV-3886|4,831,951|\n|CVE-2010-0817|Microsoft SharePoint server|||\n|CVE-2014-6271|GNU Bash|DV-16798|1,860,228|\n|CVE-2014-6277||||\n|CVE-2014-6278||||\n|CVE-2014-3567|OpenSSL|DV-17056|1,622,083|\n|CVE-2005-1380|BEA Admin Console|DV-2023|1,054,890|\n|CVE-2010-3936|Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway|||\n|CVE-2010-0817|Microsoft SharePoint server|||\n|CVE-2017-0068|Microsoft Edge|||\n|CVE-2003-1138|Apache|DV-11984|1,032,998|\n|CVE-2017-5638|Apache Struts|DV-27410|784,031|\n|CVE-2018-13379|Fortinet FortiOS|DV-36087|631,799|\n|CVE-2018-10562|Dasan GPON home router|DV-31936|588,763|\n\n\nTable 1. The top vulnerabilities in terms of exploit detections in 2021\n\n_Source: Trend Micro™ TippingPoint[®] Threat Protection System_\n\n#### Log4j Flaw Log4Shell Leads to Exploit Outbreak\n\n2021 was peppered with noteworthy incidents that resulted from unpatched security gaps, such as the\n\nhigh-severity vulnerability CVE-2021-44228. First reported privately to Apache in November 2021[73] and\n\ndubbed Log4Shell, this flaw affects Apache Log4j, a Java-based logging tool.[74] Although the open\nsource Apache community had released a patch for it in December, the vulnerability still led to a slew\n\nof exploits that malicious actors developed for a variety of illicit activities, including data theft, malware\n\ndeployment, and unauthorized cryptocurrency mining or cryptojacking. Notably, the operators of the\n\nKhonsari ransomware began using Log4Shell in their attacks in December 2021.[75]\n\nLog4j is a widely used utility in both in-house and third-party applications for enterprises. Log4j’s\n\ndependence on Java makes it difficult to detect when the tool is running across an enterprise’s\n\nenvironments. This explains why Log4Shell is not easily addressed, despite the availability of a patch.\n\nLog4Shell could allow attackers to send crafted log messages that execute arbitrary code, effectively\n\nweaponizing compromised machines to launch different kinds of attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs of December 2021, Log4Shell affected only 7% of Trend Micro customers, scattered across the\n\nAmericas, the AMEA (Asia, Middle East, and Africa) region, Europe, and Japan, with the US having\n\nexperienced the highest number of incidents.[76] Among our customers, the organizations most affected by\n\nthis vulnerability belonged to the government, retail, and manufacturing industries.\n\n#### Attackers Exploit ProxyLogon and ProxyShell Flaws\n\nOther prominent flaws that made waves in 2021 included the ProxyLogon and ProxyShell vulnerabilities in\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server, which were disclosed in late 2020. Microsoft released patches for ProxyLogon\n\n(CVE-2021-26855) in March 2021 and for the ProxyShell vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473 and CVE-2021\n34523) in May and July 2021.[77] Despite the availability of patches, however, our telemetry showed that\n\nProxyLogon had been part of many 2021 attacks by different malware families, such as the LemonDuck\n\ncryptocurrency miner, the BlackKingdom ransomware, and the Prometei botnet malware.[78]\n\nIn September 2021, researchers reported on spam campaigns employing a new loader called\n\nSquirrelwaffle.[79] We found that these campaigns also used ProxyLogon and ProxyShell exploits in their\n\nspam campaigns, and in doing so, they were able to send malicious emails posing as replies in existing\n\nemail threads to trick potential victims.[80] In November 2021, our investigation into Squirrelwaffle intrusions\n\nin the Middle East showed that publicly available ProxyLogon exploits were used to gain access to, search\n\nthrough, and even download a victim’s email messages. The ProxyShell vulnerabilities were also abused\n\nby Squirrelwaffle’s operators to impersonate a local administrator, enabling them to perform PowerShell\n\ncommands and deliver email replies containing a malicious Excel file.[81]\n\nEmail with Download file with Execute malicious script\nmalicious link malicious macro and download DLL loader\n\nCobal Strike or Connect to\nQbot C&C Squirrelwaffle C&C\n\nFigure 16. The infection chain of the malicious Excel file in a Squirrelwaffle spam email\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Unpatched VPN Vulnerabilities Threaten At-Home Work Setups\n\nThe pandemic has bolstered usage of virtual private networks (VPNs) among organizations whose\n\ngeographically dispersed employees need to connect to secure corporate networks as part of their work\nfrom-home setups. For organizations that have embraced remote working, scalable corporate VPNs and\n\ninternal applications accessible through their VPNs have become pressing priorities.[82] Globally, VPN\n\nusage soared in 2021, during which VPN downloads reached 785 million.[83]\n\nBut like any security technology, VPNs could be abused by malicious actors for their attacks. In 2021,\n\none of the most exploited vulnerabilities in VPN products was CVE-2018-13379, which accounted for\n\nmore than 631,000 detections, even though a patch for it had been available since May 2019.[84] This is\n\na path traversal flaw in Fortinet FortiOS that unauthorized users could abuse to create custom HTTP\n\nresource requests to vulnerable FortiGate SSL VPN endpoints, allowing them to read and download files\n\nfrom affected systems.[85] In early 2021, we discovered the use of CVE-2018-13379 in Sodinokibi[86] and\n\nConti[87] ransomware attacks, exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to help attackers get a\n\nfoothold in victimized systems. This flaw is among the notable VPN vulnerabilities in 2021, according to\n\nJapan’s Information-Technology Promotion Agency and the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team\n\nCoordination Center.\n\n|CVE|Col2|Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Total||198,777|139,165|158,372|138,181|114,727|98,577|\n|Fortinet|CVE-2018-13379|113,330|77,853|75,785|68,651|70,083|61,467|\n|Pulse Secure|CVE-2019-11510|45,937|15,627|27,876|21,440|15,230|9,558|\n|||787|488|566|956|508|301|\n||CVE-2019-11539|0|0|1|0|0|11|\n||CVE-2021-22893|0|0|0|107|27|0|\n|Citrix Systems|CVE-2019-19781|1,388|579|713|988|650|418|\n|||3|761|158|5|5|15|\n|Palo Alto|CVE-2019-1579|0|0|0|0|0|0|\n|F5|CVE-2020-5902|37,332|43,857|53,038|36,493|24,493|24,378|\n|||0|0|0|0|0|1|\n||CVE-2021-22986|0|0|2|12|66|19|\n|||0|0|12|12|29|39|\n|||0|0|221|9,517|3,636|2,370|\n\n\n-----\n\n|CVE|Col2|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Total||61,950|43,963|185,374|103,444|34,139|59,124|\n|Fortinet|CVE-2018-13379|24,735|16,668|53,467|31,496|15,545|22,719|\n|Pulse Secure|CVE-2019-11510|9,146|7,717|29,343|13,719|5,266|8,296|\n|||274|451|3,629|4,919|487|951|\n||CVE-2019-11539|35|1|0|5|0|12|\n||CVE-2021-22893|0|0|17|3|0|0|\n|Citrix Systems|CVE-2019-19781|631|695|9,265|5,347|472|1,268|\n|||17|63|24|32|16|11|\n|Palo Alto|CVE-2019-1579|0|0|0|10|0|12|\n|F5|CVE-2020-5902|23,333|15,899|79,272|41,841|10,863|21,671|\n|||6|0|0|0|0|5|\n||CVE-2021-22986|160|0|0|0|0|970|\n|||251|151|223|309|30|86|\n|||3,362|2,318|10,134|5,763|1,460|3,123|\n\n\nTable 2.

In the midst of it, many\n\nhave adopted a hybrid work model that is dependent on remote connection and cloud computing to\n\nadapt to and stay afloat through the seismic changes it has precipitated.[88] However, research showed that\n\nin 2021, 72% of organizations in the US still struggled to defend themselves against attacks that aimed to\n\ninfiltrate their corporate networks through their employees’ work-from-home setups.[89]\n\nHome offices had expanded the attack surfaces of enterprises, as demonstrated at Pwn2Own Austin\n\n2021, a hacking competition organized by Trend Micro’s ZDI program.[90] The event highlighted how the\n\nremote-working staples that many teleworkers relied on could be subjected to attacks. The participating\n\nsecurity researchers carried out collision hacks on devices like printers, routers, and network-attached\n\nstorage (NAS) devices by using previously disclosed vulnerabilities or discovering new ones. Collectively,\n\nthe participants at Pwn2Own Austin disclosed 61 new bugs.[91]\n\nMalicious actors have typically used the latest events and news stories in phishing attacks, but these\n\nemails could be used only in the short term. The pandemic, though, has provided them with an abundance\n\nof information around which they could theme their phishing emails. Daily Covid-19 news coverage and\n\nupdates have given them a steady supply of guises that have helped them better tailor their techniques\n\nto potential victims.[92]\n\nThroughout 2021, we observed various scams and malware attacks that used social engineering tactics\n\nto entice potential victims into providing personal information. One trend was the increasing phishing\n\nattacks on the vaccine cold chain, likely because employees involved in any link of the chain had access to\n\nvaluable sensitive data. Another was the proliferation of fake mobile apps and websites that impersonated\n\ngovernment entities, nongovernmental organizations, and companies involved in vaccine distribution,\n\nwhich malicious actors used to target people seeking aid, work opportunities, or more information on\n\nhow to acquire vaccines.[93]\n\nWe detected more than 8 million threats related to Covid-19 in 2021, about half as many as those in\n\nthe previous year.

In that month, Ireland’s public healthcare system, the Health Service Executive,\n\nfell victim to a debilitating Conti attack, resulting in the largest ever known cyberattack on a health service\n\ncomputer system.[94] Additionally, a 2021 report showed that there were two or more data breaches in the\n\nhealthcare industry per day for five consecutive months, from March to July, which might account in part\n\nfor the substantial surge in Covid-19-related threats in May.[95]\n\n639,724\n\n###### JAN\n\n447,705\n\n###### FEB\n\n557,399\n\n###### MAR\n\n660,495\n\n###### APR\n\n1,337,725\n\n###### MAY\n\n766,344\n\n###### JUN\n\n717,083\n\n###### JUL\n\n799,419\n\n###### AUG\n\n714,015\n\n###### SEP\n\n673,906\n\n###### OCT\n\n474,588\n\n###### NOV\n\n615,740\n\n###### DEC\n\n0 300K 600K 900K 1.2M 1.5M\n\nFigure 19. A monthly comparison of the detections of Covid-19-related threats in 2021\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2021, there was a 49% year-on-year decline in Covid-19-related threats, which could be explained\n\nby different factors. Malicious actors might have been lying in wait for new pandemic-related trends and\n\nnews that they could abuse. However, these threats were concentrated in two countries, so cybercriminal\n\ninterest in Covid-19-themed lures could have been waning elsewhere. While media consumption was\n\nstrong in certain countries, especially in Western Europe, the same could not be said of countries whose\n\nmedia agencies were not as preoccupied with the Covid-19 crisis.[96] Additionally, the working hours lost\n\nbecause of widespread lockdowns were equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs in 2020,[97] but that number\n\nreceded to 125 million jobs the following year, as more people returned to work after mass vaccination\n\nrollouts and declines in Covid-19 cases.[98] As the world gradually adjusted to this new normal and the labor\n\nmarket made return-to-office plans, Covid-19-themed threats began to lose their efficiency. Heightened\n\nawareness of these threats might have also pushed more enterprises and individual users to employ\n\nsoftware solutions that improved their security postures.\n\nStill, constant vigilance of scams surrounding the pandemic is necessary for all organizations if they\n\nare to steer clear of costly losses. The World Economic Forum reports that since the pandemic began,\n\ncybercrime has evolved in step with the global digital economy: Organizations have had to fend off an\n\naverage of 270 attacks each in 2021, and a single successful attack attempt can run up as much as\n\nUS$3.6 million in losses.[99]\n\n\n-----\n\n### Increasingly Sophisticated Threats Call for Robust and Multilayered Defense\n\n2021 was marked by attacks that grew in number and complexity, and whose repertoire of advanced\n\ntools and techniques underscored the necessity of a more strategic, risk-focused approach to security.\n\nSudden shifts in business operations, like the mass migration to remote work and a growing dependence\n\non online environments, brought about a shift in the attack surface and a multitude of security gaps that\n\nmalicious actors were only too eager to exploit. Companies had grown more reliant on technologies like\n\nthe internet of things (IoT) and added more connected devices to their corporate network, which in turn\n\nwidened their attack surfaces.[100]\n\nThe changing face of cybercrime means that conventional defense practices are no longer as effective as\n\nthey once were. An organization needs to focus on managing risk throughout the life cycle of its attack\n\nsurface, with a focus on discovering an ever-changing attack surface, assessing risk, and then mitigating\n\nthat risk. This enables the organization to ensure a secure working environment for its physical offices and\n\nbe on the lookout for threats that can undermine its virtual workspaces as well. Modern-day distributed\n\nworkforces do not access company resources the way they did on-premises, and the security needs of\n\nenterprises across the board have outgrown the password-based authentication processes that were\n\nbuilt on binary login scenarios.[101]\n\nNew security paradigms like zero trust, which assumes that attackers exist both within and outside a\n\nsystem, are more suited to managing transformed attack surfaces. This is not achieved by any one\n\nproduct; zero-trust environments are governed by a philosophy of constant validation and monitoring, so\n\nthe trustworthiness of every device and user is properly assessed before any device or user is granted\n\npermissions to any company resource. By practicing stringent access management policies that are\n\ngrounded in zero trust, organizations can be better equipped to protect themselves against attackers\n\nattempting credential dumping to access their systems or steal their sensitive data.[102]\n\nInvestments in advanced security technologies should not be the sole focus of an organization’s defense\n\nstrategy. These also need to be paired with policies that can stand up to increasingly elaborate scams and\n\nlures that elevate overall risk. The social engineering tactics and human errors that have allowed attacks\n\nto make inroads year after year stress the crucial role that individual users play in a company’s security\n\nprofile. A workforce that has access to the resources it needs to stay alert and well-informed of potential\n\nthreats can help cut off potential entry points for attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the pandemic started, the need to secure at-home work setups has also put additional strain on\n\ncybersecurity teams, 61% of which are already understaffed,[103] as the shift to hybrid work arrangements\n\nhas added to the complexity of enterprise networks and left security personnel scrambling to assist\n\nremote employees. Until this talent gap can be addressed, organizations should work alongside security\n\nvendors to automate processes and provide advanced analytics to lessen the load on their overworked\n\ncybersecurity workforce.[104]\n\nCompanies need security solutions that can assist in the discovery, assessment, and mitigation of\n\npersistent and emerging risks across the enterprise. It is important for enterprises to understand their\n\ngrowing attack surfaces to determine the security risks of their digital assets if they are to stay agile\n\nand adapt quickly to a changing threat landscape. Discovering the ways in which their attack surfaces\n\nare continuously changing and expanding will help enterprises gain the insights they need to accurately\n\nassess and apply the right security solutions to thwart threats.\n\nHowever, this is beyond the capability of siloed tools or any single layer of protection. To manage the risk\n\nof evolving threats, decision-makers need to derive insights from high-quality data. As more organizations\n\nundergo digital transformations, they come up against the daunting task of breaking down data silos,\n\nwhich are usually borne of business units that are accustomed to collecting information separately and of\n\nsiloed technology and legacy systems built over time as companies grow.[105]\n\nData gathered in silos from different products makes it a challenge for organizations to act on security\n\nincidents swiftly. Without a means to correlate all this information, security leaders are left to piece together\n\ndifferent perspectives of an attack, often with varying levels of detail, from different technologies.[106] Having\n\nsolutions in place that can assess, cross-check, and consolidate output from systems helps centralize\n\ndata and results in a more detailed picture of an organization’s risk posture.\n\nOn top of the complex threats bearing down on organizations, they also must keep pace with the rising\n\nnumber of data privacy and security compliance rules. However, only 4% of a compliance officer’s time\n\ngoes toward actually updating policies or implementing new measures to stay abreast of regulatory\n\ndevelopments, whereas 26% of their time on the job is spent liaising with different teams within their\n\norganization.[107] A compliance team should be able to access accurate reporting of its company’s\n\nIT infrastructure if it is to be more agile and productive, instead of having to interface with different\n\ndepartments to manually collect the information it needs.\n\nOrganizations can put themselves in a better position to map out their expanding attack surfaces by\n\nemploying a unified cybersecurity platform that can monitor and address the different needs of their\n\nendpoint, email, network, and cloud environments simultaneously. In doing so, they can achieve\n\ntransparency over the goings-on in their entire digital ecosystems, anticipate new threats, and plan\n\ncountermeasures accordingly.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Threat Landscape in Brief\n\nIn 2021, Trend Micro Smart Protection Network, including Mobile App Reputation Service, IoT Reputation\n\nService, and Smart Home Network, protected Trend Micro customers from more than 94 billion threats.\n\nOur year-on-year data shows an increase in blocked threats and reputation queries across most metrics\n\ncompared to 2020, most notable of which is the substantial 382% spike in blocked malicious files.\n\n# 94,289,585,240\n\nOverall blocked threats in 2021\n\n\n**2020** **2021**\n\n\nBlocked\nemail\nthreats\n\nEmail\nreputation\nqueries\n\nBlocked\nmobile app\nthreats\n\n\n0 20B 40B 60B 80B\n\n79,743,156,637\n\n89,032,192,911\n\n0 20B 40B 60B 80B 100B\n\n35,156,917\n\n37,088,836\n\n0 10M 20M 30M 40M\n\n\n0 500M 1B 1.5B 2B 2.5B 3B 3.5B\n\n2,338,754,688,044\n\n3,353,131,929,834\n\n0 500B 1.5T 2.5T 3.5T\n\n4,618,460\n\n5,921,414\n\n0 2M 4M 6M\n\n\n0 5B 10B 15B 20B\n\n1,523,957,334,514\n\n1,920,529,076,114\n\n0 500B 1T 1.5T 2T\n\n3,818,082,756\n\n3,073,227,623\n\n0 1B 2B 3B 4B\n\n\nBlocked\nmalicious\nURLs\n\nURL\nreputation\nqueries\n\nBlocked\nIoT\nthreats\n\n\nBlocked\nmalicious\nfiles\n\nFile\nreputation\nqueries\n\nBlocked\nSmart Home\nNetwork\nthreats\n\n\nFigure 20.
