Continuous improvements in platform and application\nsecurity have led to the decline of software exploits, and attackers have found a viable\nalternative infection vector in social engineering attacks that abuse functionalities like VBA\nmacros. Microsoft, along with the rest of the industry, observed attackers transition from\nexploits to using malicious macros to infect endpoints. Malicious macros have since showed\nup in commodity malware campaigns, targeted attacks, and in red-team activities.\n\nFigure 1. Prevalence of the exploit vs macro attack vector observed via Windows Defender ATP telemetry\n\nTo counter this threat, we invested in building better detection mechanisms that expose\nmacro behavior through runtime instrumentation within our threat protection solutions in\nthe cloud. We’re bringing this instrumentation directly into Office 365 client applications.\nMore importantly, we’re exposing this capability through AMSI, an open interface, making it\naccessible to any antivirus solution.\n\n## Obfuscation and other forms of detection evasion\n\nMacros are popular among attackers because of the rich capabilities that the VBA runtime\nexposes and the privileged context in which macros execute. Notably, as with all scripting\nlanguages, attackers have another advantage: they can hide malicious code through\nobfuscation.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo evade detection, malware needs to hide intent. The most common way that attackers do\nthis is through code obfuscation. Macro source codes are easy to obfuscate, and a plethora of\nfree tools are available for attackers to automatically do this. This results in polymorphic\nmalware, with evolving obfuscation patterns and multiple obfuscated variants of the same\nmalicious macro.\n\nThere’s more: malicious code can be taken out of the macro source and hidden in other\ndocument components like text labels, forms, Excel cells, and others. Or why hide at all? A\nsmall piece of malicious code can be embedded somewhere in a huge legitimate source and\nkeep a low profile.\n\nHow can antivirus and other security solutions cope? Today, antivirus solutions can extract\nand scan the obfuscated macro source code from an Office document. How can the macro’s\nintent be exposed? What if security solutions can observe a macro’s behavior at runtime and\ngain visibility into system interactions? Enter Office and AMSI integration.\n\n## AMSI on Windows 10\n\n_In MITRE’s evaluation of EDR solutions, Windows Defender ATP demonstrated industry-_\n_leading optics and detection capabilities. The breadth of telemetry, the strength of threat_\n_intelligence, and the advanced, automatic detection through machine learning, heuristics,_\n_and behavior monitoring delivered comprehensive coverage of attacker techniques across_\n_the entire attack chain._\n_[Read: Insights from the MITRE ATT&CK-based evaluation of Windows Defender ATP](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/12/03/insights-from-the-mitre-attack-based-evaluation-of-windows-defender-atp/)_\n\nIf AMSI rings a bell, it’s because we talked about how PowerShell adopted AMSI in a blog\npost when AMSI was introduced back in 2015.\n\n[Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is an open interface available on Windows 10 for](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal)\napplications to request, at runtime, a synchronous scan of a memory buffer by an installed\nantivirus or security solution. Any application can interface with AMSI and request a scan for\nany data that may be untrusted or suspicious.\n\nAny antivirus can become an AMSI provider and inspect data sent by applications via the\nAMSI interface. If the content submitted for scan is detected as malicious, the requesting\napplication can take action to deal with the threat and ensure the safety of the device. To\n[learn more, refer to the AMSI documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/AMSI/antimalware-scan-interface-portal)\n\nAMSI also integrates with the JavaScript, VBScript, and PowerShell scripting engines. Over\nthe years, we have been steadily increasing our investments in providing security solutions\nwith deeper visibility into script-based threats. Insights seen via AMSI is consumed by our\nown security products. The new Office and AMSI integration is yet another addition to the\n\n\n-----\n\narsenal of protection against script-based malware. Windows Defender Advanced Threat\n[Protection (Windows Defender ATP) leverages AMSI and machine learning to combat script-](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)\n[based threats that live off the land (read our previous blog post to learn more).](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/12/04/windows-defender-atp-machine-learning-and-amsi-unearthing-script-based-attacks-that-live-off-the-land/)\n\n## Office VBA integration with AMSI\n\nThe Office VBA integration with AMSI is made up of three parts: (a) logging macro behavior,\n(b) triggering a scan on suspicious behavior, and (c) stopping a malicious macro upon\ndetection.\n\nFigure 2. Runtime scanning of macros via AMSI\n\n### Logging macro behavior\n\nThe VBA language offers macros a rich set of functions that can be used to interface with the\noperating system to run commands, access the file system, etc. Additionally, it allows the\nability to issue direct calls to COM methods and Win32 APIs. The VBA scripting engine\nhandles calls from macro code to COM and APIs via internal interfaces that implement the\ntransition between the caller and the callee. These interfaces are instrumented such that the\nbehavior of a macro is trapped and all relevant information, including the function name and\nits parameters, are logged in a circular buffer.\n\nThis monitoring is not tied to specific functions; it’s generic and works on any COM method\nor Win32 API. The logged calls can come in two formats:\n\n_<COM_Object>.<COM_Method>(“Parameter 1”, …, “Parameter n”);_\n_<API_or_function_Name>(“Parameter 1”, …, “Parameter n”);_\n\nInvoked functions, methods, and APIs need to receive the parameters in the clear (plaintext)\nin order to work; thus, this behavioral instrumentation is not affected by obfuscation. This\ninstrumentation thus reveals a weak spot for macro codes; the antivirus now has visibility on\n\n\n-----\n\nrelevant activity of the macro in the clear.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following string obfuscation in a shell command:\n\n_Shell(“ma”+”l”+ “wa”+ “r” + “e.e” + “xe”)_\n\nWith the Office VBA and AMSI integration, this is logged like so:\n\n_Shell(“malware.exe”);_\n\n### Triggering on suspicious behavior\n\nWhen a potentially high-risk function or method (a trigger; for example, CreateProcess or\n_ShellExecute) is invoked, Office halts the execution of the macro and requests a scan of the_\nmacro behavior logged up to that moment, via the AMSI interface. The AMSI provider (e.g.,\nantivirus software) is invoked synchronously and returns a verdict indicating whether or not\nthe observed behavior is malicious.\n\nThe list of high-risk functions or triggers are meant to cover actions at various stages of an\nattack chain (e.g., payload download, persistence, execution, etc.) and are selected based on\ntheir prevalence among malicious and benign macros. The behavior log sent over AMSI can\ninclude information like suspicious URLs from which malicious data was downloaded,\nsuspicious file names known to be associated with malware, and others. This data is valuable\nin determining if the macro is malicious, as well as in the creation of detection indicators –\nall without any influence from obfuscation.\n\n### Stopping malicious macros upon detection\n\nIf behavior is assessed malicious, macro execution is stopped. The user is notified by the\nOffice application, and the application session is shut down to avoid any further damage.\nThis can stop an attack in its tracks, protecting the device and user.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Malicious macro notification\n\n## Case study 1: Heavily obfuscated macro code\n\n_(SHA-256: 10955f54aa38dbf4eb510b8e7903398d9896ee13d799fdc980f4ec7182dbcecd)_\n\nTo illustrate how the Office VBA and AMSI integration can expose malicious macro code,\nlet’s look at a recent social engineering attack that uses macro-based malware. The initial\nvector is a Word document with instructions in the Chinese language to “Enable content”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: The malicious document instructs to enable the content\n\nIf the recipient falls for the lure and enables content, the malicious macro code runs and\nlaunches a command to download the payload from a command-and-control server\ncontrolled by the attacker. The payload, an installer file, is then run.\n\nThe macro code is heavily obfuscated:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Obfuscated macro\n\nHowever, behavior monitoring is not hindered by obfuscation. It produces the following log,\nwhich it passes to AMSI for scanning by antivirus:\n\nFigure 6: De-obfuscated behavior log\n\nThe action carried out by the macro code is logged, clearly exposing malicious actions that\nantivirus solutions can detect much more easily than if the code was obfuscated.\n\n## Case study 2: Macro threat that lives off the land\n\n_(SHA-256: 7952a9da1001be95eb63bc39647bacc66ab7029d8ee0b71ede62ac44973abf79)_\n\nThe following is an example of macro malware that “lives off the land”, which means that it\nstays away from the disk and uses common tools to run code directly in memory. In this case,\nit uses shellcode and dynamic pages. Like the previous example, this attack uses social\nengineering to get users to click “Enable Content” and run the macro code, but this one uses\ninstructions in the Spanish language in Excel.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Malicious Excel file with instructions to enable content\n\nWhen run, the macro code dynamically allocates virtual memory, writes shellcode to the\nallocated location, and uses a system callback to transfer execution control. The malicious\n[shellcode then achieves fileless persistence, being memory-resident without a file.](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/01/24/now-you-see-me-exposing-fileless-malware/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Macro code utilizing Win32 APIs to launch embedded shellcode\n\nWhen the shellcode gets execution control, it launches a PowerShell command to download\nadditional payload from a command-and-control server controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. PowerShell command that downloads payload\n\nEven if the macro code uses fileless code execution technique using shellcode, its behavior is\nexposed to antivirus solutions via the AMSI interface. Sample log is shown below:\n\nFigure 10. De-obfuscated behavior log\n\nWith the AMSI scan integration in both Office VBA and PowerShell, security solutions like\nWindows Defender ATP can gain clear visibility into malicious behavior at multiple levels\nand successfully block attacks.\n\n## Windows Defender ATP: Force multiplier and protection for down- level platforms\n\nIn addition to protecting users running Office 365 applications on Windows 10, detections\n[via AMSI allow modern endpoint protection platforms like Windows Defender ATP to extend](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)\nprotection to customers via the cloud.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Simplified diagram showing how AMSI detections in a few machines are extended to other\n\ncustomers via the cloud\n\n[In Windows Defender AV’s cloud-delivered antivirus protection, the Office VBA and AMSI](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/07/18/windows-defender-antivirus-cloud-protection-service-advanced-real-time-defense-against-never-before-seen-malware/)\nintegration enriches the signals sent to the cloud, where multiple layers of machine learning\nmodels classify and make verdicts on files. When devices encounter documents with\nsuspicious macro code, Windows Defender AV sends metadata and other machine learning\nfeatures, coupled with signals from Office AMSI, to the cloud. Verdicts by machine learning\ntranslate to real-time protection for the rest of Windows Defender AV customers with cloud\nprotection enabled.\n\nThis protection is also delivered to the rest of Microsoft 365 customers. Through the\n[Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, security signals are shared across components of](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/07/18/windows-defender-antivirus-cloud-protection-service-advanced-real-time-defense-against-never-before-seen-malware/)\nMicrosoft 365 threat protection. For example, in the case of macro malware, detections of\n[malicious macro-laced documents by Windows Defender AV are shared with Office 365 ATP,](https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/online-email-threat-protection)\nwhich blocks emails carrying the document, stopping attacks before the documents land in\nusers mailboxes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. The Office and AMSI integration enriches the orchestration of protection across Microsoft 365\n\nWithin a few weeks after the release of this new instrumentation in Office VBA and the\n[adoption by Windows Defender ATP, we saw this multiplier effect, with signals from a few](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)\nhundred devices protecting several tens of thousands of devices. Because Office AMSI feature\nexposes behaviors of the macro irrespective of content, language, or obfuscation, signals from\none part of the world can translate to protection for the rest of the globe – this is powerful.\n\n## Availability\n\n[AMSI integration is now available and turned on by default on the Monthly Channel for](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/overview-of-update-channels-for-office-365-proplus#BKMK_MC)\nOffice 365 client applications including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Visio, and\nPublisher.\n\nIn its default configuration, macros are scanned at runtime via AMSI except in the following\nscenarios:\n\nDocuments opened while macro security settings are set to “Enable All Macros”\n[Documents opened from trusted locations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/designate-trusted-locations-for-files-in-office)\n[Documents that are trusted documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/set-up-a-safe-environment-to-open-files-by-using-protected-view-in-office)\nDocuments that contain VBA that is digitally signed by a trusted publisher\n\nOffice 365 applications also expose a new policy control for administrators to configure if and\nwhen macros are scanned at runtime via AMSI:\n\n\n-----\n\n|Group Policy setting name|Macro Runtime Scan Scope|\n|---|---|\n|Path|User Configuration > Administrative templates > Microsoft Office 2016 > Security Settings|\n|Description|This policy setting specifies for which documents the VBA Runtime Scan feature is enabled. Disable for all documents: If the feature is disabled for all documents, no runtime scanning of enabled macros will be performed. Enable for low trust documents: If the feature is enabled for low trust documents, the feature will be enabled for all documents for which macros are enabled except: Documents opened while macro security settings are set to “Enable All Macros” Documents opened from a Trusted Location Documents that are Trusted Documents Documents that contain VBA that is digitally signed by a Trusted Publisher Enable for all documents: If the feature is enabled for all documents, then the above class of documents are not excluded from the behavior. This protocol allows the VBA runtime to report to the Anti-Virus system certain high-risk code behaviors it is about to execute and allows the Anti- Virus to report back to the process if the sequence of observed behaviors indicates likely malicious activity so the Office application can take appropriate action. When this feature is enabled, affected VBA projects’ runtime performance may be reduced.|\n\n\n## Conclusion: Exposing hidden malicious intent\n\nMacro-based malware continuously evolves and poses challenges in detection using\n[techniques like sandbox evasion and code obfuscation. Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI)’s](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal)\nintegration with Office 365 applications enable runtime scanning of macros, exposing\nmalicious intent even with heavy obfuscation. This latest improvement to Office 365 allows\n[modern endpoint security platforms like Windows Defender ATP to defeat macro-based](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)\nthreats.\n\nCode instrumentation and runtime monitoring are powerful tools for threat protection.\nCombined with runtime scanning via AMSI, they enable antivirus and other security\nsolutions to have greater visibility into the runtime behavior of a macro execution session at a\n\n\n-----\n\nvery granular level, while also bypassing code obfuscation. This enables antivirus solutions to\n(1) detect a wide range of mutated or obfuscated malware that exhibit the same behavior\nusing a smaller but more efficient set of detection algorithms, and (2) impose more granular\nrestrictions on what macros are allowed to do at runtime.\n\nMoreover, AMSI protection is not limited to macros. Other scripting engines like JavaScript,\nVBScript, and PowerShell also implement a form of code instrumentation and interface with\nAMSI. Attacks with multiple stages that use different scripts will be under scrutiny by AMSI\nat each step, exposing all behaviors and enabling detection by antivirus and other solutions.\n\nWe believe this is another step forward in elevating security for Microsoft 365 customers.\nMore importantly, AMSI and Office 365 integration enables the broader ecosystem of\nsecurity solutions to better detect and protect customers from malicious attacks without\ndisrupting day-to-day productivity.\n\n**_Giulia Biagini, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center_**\n**_Sriram Iyer, Office Security_**\n\n**_Karthik Selvaraj, Windows Defender ATP Research_**\n\n\n-----",
