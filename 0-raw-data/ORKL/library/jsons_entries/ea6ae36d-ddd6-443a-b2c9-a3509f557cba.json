    "plain_text": "# FASTCash: How the Lazarus Group is Emptying Millions from ATMs\n\n**[symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/fastcash-lazarus-atm-malware](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/fastcash-lazarus-atm-malware)**\n\n\n-----\n\n## How FASTCash attacks work - Details\n\nIn order to permit their fraudulent withdrawals from ATMs, the attackers inject a malicious\nAdvanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) executable into a running, legitimate process on the\nswitch application server of a financial transaction network, in this case a network handling\nATM transactions. The malicious executable contains logic to construct fraudulent ISO 8583\nmessages. ISO 8583 is the standard for financial transaction messaging. The purpose of this\nexecutable has not been previously documented. It was previously believed that the\nattackers used scripts to manipulate legitimate software on the server into enabling the\nfraudulent activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, analysis by Symantec has found that this executable is in fact malware, which we\n[have named Trojan.Fastcash. Trojan.Fastcash has two primary functions:](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-110615-2942-99)\n\n1. It monitors incoming messages and intercepts attacker-generated fraudulent\n\ntransaction requests to prevent them from reaching the switch application that\nprocesses transactions.\n2. It contains logic that generates one of three fraudulent responses to fraudulent\n\ntransaction requests.\n\nOnce installed on the server, Trojan.Fastcash will read all incoming network traffic, scanning\nfor incoming ISO 8583 request messages. It will read the Primary Account Number (PAN) on\nall messages and, if it finds any containing a PAN number used by the attackers, the\nmalware will attempt to modify these messages. How the messages are modified depends\non each victim organization. It will then transmit a fake response message approving\nfraudulent withdrawal requests. The result is that attempts to withdraw money via an ATM by\nthe Lazarus attackers will be approved.\n\nHere is one example of the response logic that Trojan.Fastcash uses to generate fake\nresponses. This particular sample has logic to construct one of three fake responses based\non the incoming attacker request:\n\nFor Message Type Indicator == 200 (ATM Transaction) and Point of Service Entry\nMode starts with 90 (Magnetic Strip only):\n\nIf Processing Code starts with 3 (Balance Inquiry):\n\nResponse Code = 00 (Approved)\n\nOtherwise, if the Primary Account Number is Blacklisted by Attackers:\n\nResponse Code = 55 (Invalid PIN)\n\nAll other Processing Codes (with non-blacklisted PANs):\n\nResponse Code = 00 (Approved)\n\nIn this case, the attackers appear to have built in a capability to selectively deny transactions\nbased on their own blacklist of account numbers. However, the capability was not\nimplemented in this sample, and the check for blacklisting always returns “False”.\n\nSymantec has found several different variants of Trojan.Fastcash, each of which uses\ndifferent response logic. We believe that each variant is tailored for a particular transaction\nprocessing network and thus has its own tailored response logic.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PAN numbers used to carry out the FASTCash attacks relate to real accounts.\nAccording to the US-CERT report, most accounts used to initiate the transactions had\nminimal account activity or zero balances. How the attackers gain control of these accounts\nremains unclear. It is possible the attackers are opening the accounts themselves and\nmaking withdrawal requests with cards issued to those accounts. Another possibility is the\nattackers are using stolen cards to perform the attacks.\n\nIn all reported FASTCash attacks to date, the attackers have compromised banking\napplication servers running unsupported versions of the AIX operating system, beyond the\nend of their service pack support dates.\n\n## Who is Lazarus?\n\nLazarus is a very active group involved in both cyber crime and espionage. Lazarus was\ninitially known for its involvement in espionage operations and a number of high-profile\n[disruptive attacks, including the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures that saw large amounts of](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation)\ninformation being stolen and computers wiped by malware.\n\nIn recent years, Lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks. The\n[group was linked to the $81 million theft from the Bangladesh central bank in 2016, along](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/swift-attackers-malware-linked-more-financial-attacks)\nwith a number of other bank heists.\n\n[Lazarus was also linked to the WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May 2017. WannaCry](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-show-strong-links-lazarus-group)\nincorporated the leaked “EternalBlue” exploit that used two known vulnerabilities in Windows\n[(CVE-2017-0144 and](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/vulnerability.jsp?bid=96704) [CVE-2017-0145) to turn the ransomware into a worm, capable of](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/vulnerability.jsp?bid=96705)\nspreading itself to any unpatched computers on the victim’s network and also to other\nvulnerable computers connected to the internet. Within hours of its release, WannaCry had\ninfected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide.\n\n## Ongoing threat to the financial sector\n\nThe recent wave of FASTCash attacks demonstrates that financially motivated attacks are\nnot simply a passing interest for the Lazarus group and can now be considered one of its\ncore activities.\n\nAs with the 2016 series of virtual bank heists, including the Bangladesh Bank heist,\nFASTCash illustrates that Lazarus possesses an in-depth knowledge of banking systems\nand transaction processing protocols and has the expertise to leverage that knowledge in\norder to steal large sums from vulnerable banks.\n\nIn short, Lazarus continues to pose a serious threat to the financial sector and organizations\nshould take all necessary steps to ensure that their payment systems are fully up to date and\nsecured.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Protection\n\nSymantec has the following detections in place to protect customers against Lazarus\nFASTCash attacks:\n\n[Trojan.Fastcash](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-110615-2942-99)\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOrganizations should ensure that operating systems and all other software are up to date.\nSoftware updates will frequently include patches for newly discovered security vulnerabilities\nthat could be exploited by attackers. In all reported FASTCash attacks to date, the attackers\nhave compromised banking application servers running unsupported versions of the AIX\noperating system, beyond the end of their service pack support dates.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nD465637518024262C063F4A82D799A4E40FF3381014972F24EA18BC23C3B27EE\n(Trojan.Fastcash Injector)\n\nCA9AB48D293CC84092E8DB8F0CA99CB155B30C61D32A1DA7CD3687DE454FE86C\n(Trojan.Fastcash DLL)\n\n10AC312C8DD02E417DD24D53C99525C29D74DCBC84730351AD7A4E0A4B1A0EBA\n(Trojan.Fastcash DLL)\n\n3A5BA44F140821849DE2D82D5A137C3BB5A736130DDDB86B296D94E6B421594C\n(Trojan.Fastcash DLL)\n\n\n-----",
