    "plain_text": "# Tropic Trooper Goes Mobile With Titan Surveillanceware\n\n**blog.lookout.com/titan-mobile-threat**\n\nLookout researchers have recently observed cybercriminals evolving the way they operate to\nreflect the multitude of platforms people now use to access information: you may read and\ntriage email on a smartphone, switch to a laptop to crank out some work, then flip over to a\ntablet to catch up on social media or watch a video. To the attackers, it's a numbers game.\nThe more devices they can reach, the more likely they are to compromise a target. Given the\nrise of mobile productivity, this means that we are seeing a growing number of attackers add\nmobile capabilities to their toolkits.\n\nThe latest threat to follow this trend is Titan, a family of sophisticated Android\nsurveillanceware apps surfaced by Lookout's automated analysis that, based on command\nand control infrastructure, is linked to the same actors behind Operation Tropic Trooper.\n[Tropic Trooper is a long running campaign, first reported in 2016, that executed targeted](https://www.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf)\ndesktop attacks against enterprises and military units in Taiwan and the Philippines. All\nLookout customers are protected from Titan.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nTitan usually comes with busybox and various native libraries that provide a range of\nfunctionality, from automated gathering of a user's data to being able to execute attacker\nspecified instructions as superuser. Over time, Titan has evolved considerably with a distinct\n\n\n-----\n\ntrend of malicious code shifting first from Java to native libraries, then moving into second\nstage components. Analysis of Titan variants found that they contained the following\ncapabilities:\n\nRetrieve call history\nRetrieve text messages\nRetrieve contact information\nRetrieve a list of Installed packages\nTrack device location\nTake a photo with the device camera when a user is first present or when instructed by\nan attacker\nRecord all calls or only calls to attacker specified numbers\n\nBlock text messages to attacker specified numbers\nTake a screenshot\nSend a text message\nExecute attacker specified commands as root\nUpload specific files\nDownload attacker specified files\n\nTitan hasn't been seen to trojanize legitimate applications and doesn't contain any legitimate\nfunctionality. The authors of Titan have instead opted to simply use the icon of a legitimate\napp. Application icons used included:\n\nZalo - a vietnamese Messaging Application,\n91 - an unofficial Chinese App Store that was bought by Baidu in 2013 for 1.9 billion,\nYY - a popular Chinese social network,\nRenren - formerly Xiaonei Network, this is a social network primarily used by Chinese\ncollege students,\n58 - an online Chinese marketplace,\nWeChat - a popular Chinese messaging app, and\nFloatingMenu - an application for handling shortcuts and gestures.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nSeveral domains and IP addresses associated to this family are no longer live however\nfurther research is being conducted into 108.61.xxx.xxx which, at the time of writing, is live,\nrunning PHP, and exposing information that may provide additional leads.
