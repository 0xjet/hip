Since then, Russia has been playing hard in the cyber\nbattlefield - and Gamaredon is a lead player.\n\n## Who is the Gamaredon Group\n\nThe Gamaredon Group has been active since at least 2013, not long before Russia annexed\n[the Crimean peninsula. Over the years, speculations about their primary motives have been](https://www.threatstop.com/blog/block-crimea-and-russian-ips)\nconfirmed, with security researchers seeing multiple attacks targeting Ukrainian government\norganizations and officials. Last year, the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) publicly\nattributed the adversary to five Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers posted in\nCrimea. The SSU has also claimed that Gamaredon is capable of surpassing extremely\nsuccessful Russian APTs like APT28 (Sofacy/Fancy Bear), SNAKE (Turla), and APT29 (Cozy\nBear/The Dukes) in the scale of their attacks and damage.\n\n## Infection Tactics\n\nGamaredon usually leverages email spear phishing using malicious office file attachments to\ninfect their victims. But that's not all - the APT has a few creative tricks up its sleeve. Once\nexample is their campaign targeting a Western government entity. Instead of the classic\nemail phish, they played out a meticulous, precise attack by submitting a malicious\ndownloader camouflaged as a CV onto a job search platform.\n\n_Email sent to a Ukranian government inbox. Image: Unit42_\n\nOnce the malicious file is opened by the victim, a remote template injection technique is set\nin action. allowing the file to pull a malicious VBS script. The script then checks in with the\nAPT's command and control (C2) servers and after a wait period (6 hours for example) it\n\n\n-----\n\nwill pull a SelF-eXtracting (SFX) archive - one of Gamaredon s signature moves. The threat\nactor has been spotted using this tactic to bundle in evasive remote access persistence tools\nto victims machines for years. Today, Gamaredon uses UltraVNC, which gives the C2 server\ncontrol of the compromised system. VBS files are also usually bundled in the payload, and a\ncustom Gamaredon malware is downloaded.\n\n## Malware Variants\n\nDifferent Gamaredon attacks have used different malware variants over time. For many years\nnow, the threat actor has been using their own custom-created malware variants.\nPowerPunch is Gamaredon's droppers and downloader family, which shares it's evasiveness\ncharacteristic with Pterodo. The backdoor uses various obfuscation techniques, while giving\nthe attackers interactive access to the network so they can carry out their attack plans.\nQuietSieve, another custom malware, steals information from the target host such as\n_doc, docx, xls, rtf, odt, txt, jpg, pdf, rar, zip and 7z files, as well as screenshots taken by the_\nmalware. Other malware families employed by Gamaredon include ObfuMerry, ObfuBerry,\nDilongTrash, DinoTrain, and DesertDown.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nGamaredon has been seen changing infrastructure over time. Analyzing hundreds of IOCs\nused by the APT in the past and present, it's clear that their favorite registrar by a landslide\n[has always been REG-RU. Recently, Cisco released a table mapping the different IP spaces](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/network-footprints-of-gamaredon-group)\nheavily associated with Gamaredon infrastructure.\n\n_Distribution of Gamaredon-related IP addresses per ASN and owner. Image: Cisco_\n\nBy integrating over 900 different threat intelligence feeds, ThreatSTOP provides\ncomprehensive coverage of Gamaredon IOCs for optimum protection. As new IOCs are\ndiscovered, they are swiftly added to our system and propagated to blocklists and policies on\nall ThreatSTOP-protected networks. Our Core Threats IP and domain bundles allow\ncustomers to block thousands of Gamaredon infrastructure IOCs, including the related REG\n\n-----\n\nRU IP address spaces. Users who want to block Russia as a whole, not only by geo-blocking\nRussia, but also Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, and by blocking sanctioned Russian-related\nentities, can do so with our Russia Related bundles.\n\n\n-----",
