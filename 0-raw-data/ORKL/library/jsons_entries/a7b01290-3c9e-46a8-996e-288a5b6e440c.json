Singer [1]\n\n_In 2010, computer programmers around the world noticed_\n_a strange kind of cyber attack—although it had global reach, it_\n_was highly targeted and very sophisticated. A German team, led_\n_by Ralph Langner, figured out that the worm, now known as_\n_Stuxnet, specifically targeted certain operations related to the_\n_Natanz nuclear facility in Iran, causing the enrichment_\n_centrifuges to break down without any notice or apparent_\n_reason. As news of this new worm and its effects spread around_\n_the globe, the role of cyber attacks within the laws of war came_\n_into the forefront of discussions about the future of armed_\n_conflict. This article examines how Stuxnet changed the nature_\n_of cyber attacks and the ongoing discussion of where digital_\n_technology fits into the laws of war._\n\nI.

The Digital Mystery\n\nRalph Langner is a jovial fellow with a quick wit, whose sense of\nwhimsy is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that he wears cowboy\nboots. Wearing cowboy boots shouldn’t be all that notable, until one\nrealizes that Ralph is not from Texas, but Germany, and is not a\ncowboy, but a computer specialist. Langner is also incredibly\ninquisitive. It was this combination that led him to play a role in the\ndiscovery of one of the most notable weapons in history; and not just\ncyber history, but history overall.\n\nSince 1988, Ralph and his team of security experts have been\nadvising organizations on the safety of large-scale computer system\ninstallations. Their special focus was industrial control systems, such\nas the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA),\n\n1. P.W. Singer is Strategist and Senior Fellow at The New America\nFoundation and co-author of the book _Cybersecurity and Cyberwar:_\n_What Everyone Needs to Know (Oxford University Press, 2014) from_\nwhich this article is derived.

SCADA is used in\neverything from the management and operation of power plants to\nthe manufacture of candy wrappers.[2]\n\nIn 2010, like many other industrial control and cybersecurity\nexperts around the world, Ralph grew concerned about the cyber\nworm of unknown origin that was spreading across the world and\nembedding itself in these control systems. Thousands of computers in\nplaces like India and the United States had been infected. But the\nbulk of the infections (roughly 60 percent) were in Iran. This led\nmany experts to infer that either Iran had particularly poor cyber\ndefenses for its SCADA-related programs, which made it more\nvulnerable, or a virus had initially targeted some site in Iran and, as\none report put it, “subsequently failed in its primary purpose and run\namok, spreading uncontrollably to unintended targets all over the\nworld, and thus demonstrating how indiscriminate and destructive\ncyber weapons were likely to be.”[3]\n\nII. Stuxnet and Its Characteristics\n\n_A. Getting Past Operating System Security_\n\nBoth turned out to be far from the case. Various teams of cyber\nexperts from around the world began dissecting the code of this cyber\nworm, which became known as Stuxnet, and debates grew over its\norigin and targets.[4] Ralph and his team were curious, and the more\nthey explored the code, the more interested they became in it. It was\na wonderfully complex piece of malware like none the world had ever\nseen. It had at least four new “zero days” (previously unknown\nvulnerabilities), utilized digital signatures with the private keys of two\ncertificates stolen from separate well-known companies, and worked\non all Windows operating systems down to the decade-old Windows\n95 edition.[5] The number of new zero days particularly stood out.\nHackers prize zero days and do not like to reveal them when they\ndon’t have to. To use four at once was unprecedented and almost\nillogical given that one new open door is enough. It was a pretty good\n\n2. P.W.

SINGER & FRIEDMAN, supra note 1, at 115.\n\n\n-----\n\nsign that Stuxnet’s makers had enormous resources and wanted to be\nabsolutely certain they would penetrate their target.\n\nStuxnet also slipped by the Windows’ defenses using the\nequivalent of a stolen passport. To gain access to the kernel, or\noperating system’s control system, Stuxnet had to install a component\nthat could talk to the kernel. The authors chose to target a device\ndriver, a common tool that allows hardware devices to interact with\nthe operating system. Windows uses a scheme of digital signatures to\nallow trusted hardware manufacturers to write device drivers that are\ntrusted by the operating system. Unsigned drivers raise an alert for\nthe user, while signed drivers do not.[6] The drivers in Stuxnet were\nsigned by two real companies in Taiwan, indicating that the authors\nhad access to the secret signing keys which were most likely stolen.\nAgain, this is a rare style of attack: stolen signing keys are incredibly\npowerful, would have been well protected, and would be very valuable\nin any illicit market.\n\n_B. Stuxnet’s Target_\n\nRather than being truly infectious, the malware’s DNA revealed\nsomething even more interesting: Stuxnet was hunting for something\nin particular. As Langner delved deeper, he discovered that Stuxnet\nwas not going after computers or even Windows software in general,\nbut a specific type of program used in Siemens’s WinCC/PCS 7\nSCADA control software. Indeed, if this software was not present, the\nworm had built-in controls to become inert.[7] In addition, rather than\ntrying to spread as widely as possible, as was the goal with past\nworms, Stuxnet only allowed each infected computer to spread the\nworm to no more than three other computers. It even came with a\nfinal safeguard of a self-destruct mechanism, which caused the worm\nto basically erase itself in 2012. Whoever made Stuxnet not only had\na specific target in mind, but didn’t want the code lingering in the\nwild forever.[8] This was a very different worm, indeed.\n\nBut what was the target? This was the true mystery. Here,\nLangner’s background in working with industrial firms proved\nparticularly useful. He figured out that Stuxnet was only going after a\nspecific industrial controller, manufactured by Siemens and configured\nto run a series of nuclear centrifuges. But the target was not just any\nset of nuclear centrifuges; rather, it targeted only a cascade of\n\n6.

LUCAS, _supra note 2, at 14._\n\n\n-----\n\ncentrifuges of a certain size and number (984) linked together. Not so\ncoincidentally, this was the exact setup at the Natanz nuclear facility,\na site suspected to be part of Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program.[9]\n\nThings got especially tricky once Stuxnet found its way into this\ntarget (it was later revealed that the delivery mechanism was\ninfiltration through Iranian nuclear scientists’ own laptops and\nmemory sticks). The attack didn’t shut down the centrifuges in any\nobvious manner. Instead, it ran a series of subroutines. One, known as\na _man in the middle, caused tiny adjustments in the pressure inside_\nthe centrifuges. Another manipulated the speed of the centrifuges’\nspinning rotors, causing them to first slow down, then return to\nnormal speed, destabilizing the rotors and ruining their work. On top\nof this, the malware would occasionally push the centrifuge speeds\npast the designed maximum. As a result, the centrifuges not only\nfailed to produce refined uranium fuel, they frequently broke down\nand ground to a halt from the damaging vibrations caused by the\nvarious random surges. At other times, the machines literally spun\nout of control and exploded.\n\nThe effect, Langner wrote, was “as good as using explosives”\nagainst the facility. In fact, it was better. The victim had “no clue of\nbeing under a cyber attack.” Stuxnet had been inside Iranian\nnetworks for over a year, but the nuclear scientists initially thought\ntheir facility was just suffering from a series of random breakdowns.\nThe scientists just kept replacing the broken centrifuges with new\nones, which would then get infected and break again.[10] Eventually,\nthough, they wondered whether they were being sold faulty parts or\nwere suffering from some kind of hardware sabotage. But the\nmachines checked out perfectly every time, except for the fact that\nnothing was working the way it should.\n\n_C. What Made Stuxnet Different_\n\nThis was perhaps the most insidious part of Stuxnet: it was an\nintegrity attack par excellence. Stuxnet didn’t just corrupt the\nprocess; it hid its effects from the operators. It exploited not just\ntechnical vulnerabilities, but their all-too-human trust that the\ncomputer systems would accurately and honestly describe what was\ntaking place. For a long period of time, the Iranian engineers didn’t\neven suspect a cyber attack; their systems were air-gapped from the\n\n9.

MONITOR (Nov. 16, 2010),\nhttp://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/1116/How-Stuxnet-cyberweapon-targeted-Iran-nuclear-plant.\n\n\n-----\n\nWeb.[11] Moreover, up to this point, worms and viruses had always had\nan obvious effect on the computer, not the hardware. Eventually, the\nattacks had another effect: the Iranian scientists suffered low morale,\nunder the impression that they couldn’t do anything right; seventy\nyears earlier a bunch of Americans had built an atomic bomb using\nslide rulers, and they couldn’t even get their modern-day centrifuges\nto work. Overall, Langner likened the Stuxnet effect to the cyber\nversion of “Chinese water torture.”[12]\n\nWhen Ralph Langer revealed his findings on his blog, the littleknown German researcher quickly became an international celebrity.\nFirst, he had exposed a top-secret campaign of sabotage (later leaked\nin the American media to have been a collaborative effort between US\nand the Israeli intelligence agencies, known as “Olympic Games”),\nand second, it was a find of global importance.[13]\n\nBeyond the operation itself and the impact it had on Iran or even\nUS relations with other states or international law, Stuxnet stood out\nas something more. A new kind of weapon long speculated about but\nnever seen, a specially designed cyber weapon, had finally been used.\nPrior cyber “attacks” had stayed within the digital realm, usually\ninvolving the theft, disruption, or manipulation of information.[14]\nStuxnet did that, but caused something new, physical consequences.\nThis made it like prior weapons in general, in that all weapons\nthroughout history had caused physical damage. But it also took not\nmerely cybersecurity but war itself into a new realm, being a weapon\nthat was made of bits, rather than atoms. Like physical unmanned\nsystems (such as drones), the worm separated the human point of\ndecision geographically from the point of action, both physically (the\n“trigger” was pulled thousands of miles from the target in Iran), and,\narguably, chronologically (the trigger was pulled months before). The\nworm was sent into contexts and locales that the sender couldn’t\nexpect to know. This meant that, by some definitions, Stuxnet was\nthe first truly autonomous weapon.\n\nThus when it came time to weigh the new weapon, the debate\ndiverged. Judith Donath of Harvard University described Stuxnet as a\n\n11. Geoffrey Ingersoll, _US Navy: Hackers ‘Jumping the Air Gap’ Would_\n_‘Disrupt the World Balance of Power’, BUS.

What will be its rifle? Its AK-47? Its\natomic bomb?”[15] Others worried that these new and better weapons\nwould promote a new kind of escalation and global risk. “Stuxnet was\nthe absolute game changer,” wrote cyber thinker Mikko Hypponen.\n“We are entering an arms race where countries start stocking\nweapons, only it isn’t planes and nuclear reactors they’re stocking,\nbut it’s cyberweapons.”[16] Still others were concerned of the opposite,\nthat not enough people took notice of this “opening shot in a war we\nwill all lose,” says Leslie Harris of the Center for Democracy and\nTechnology.[17]\n\nIII. Stuxnet as Cyberweapon\n\nStuxnet was all of these things, perhaps, but it was also notable\nfor another reason. This nasty little worm was a superb illustration of\nhow ethics can be applied to cyberwar.\n\nThere is the popular notion that “all is fair in love and war,” but\nthe reality is that there are actually a series of strict guidelines that\nare supposed to shape behavior in war—what 1600s legal thinker\nHugo Grotius called _jus in bello, or law in wartime. Its two most_\nprominent elements are proportionality and discrimination. The law\nof proportionality states that the suffering and devastation that one\nside causes, especially collateral damage to unintended targets, cannot\noutweigh whatever harm prompted the conflict.[18] In other words, if\nthe other side stole your cow, you can’t justifiably nuke their city.\nThe law of discrimination maintains that all belligerent sides must\ndistinguish between legitimate targets (e.g. a military post) and nonlegitimate targets (e.g. civilians or wounded persons), and do their\nutmost to only cause harm to the intended, legitimate targets.[19]\n\nStuxnet stood out as a new kind of weapon in that it was\ndesigned to cause physical damage via cyber means. Its makers\nwanted it to damage targets in the real world, but only through\naction on digital networks. This was novel enough. But what really\ndistinguished Stuxnet from traditional weapons was how small its\nphysical impact was, especially in light of the intense stakes. The\ntarget was a nuclear bomb-making program, one that was already the\ntarget of diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions. While it is\n\n15. _Id. at_ 118.\n\n16. _Id._\n\n17. _Id._\n\n18.

PEACE RES. 175, 176–77 (2013).\n\n19. _Id. at 175-76._\n\n\n-----\n\ncertainly arguable whether preemptive action against the Iranian\nprogram was justifiable, the Stuxnet attack makes the question of\nproportionality relevant. Stuxnet only broke nuclear centrifuges,\nwhich Iran had illegally obtained to conduct illicit research. Moreover,\nit neither hurt nor killed anyone. In comparison, when Israel\nattempted to obstruct Iraqi nuclear research in 1981, its forces\ndropped sixteen 2,000-pound bombs on a research site during\n“Operation Opera,” leveling it and killing eleven soldiers and\ncivilians.[20]\n\nDiscrimination also matters when judging the ethics of these\nattacks. At face value, Stuxnet seems incredibly indiscriminant. While\nlimited in the scope of its attacks compared to prior malware, this\nwas a worm that still got around. It infected not just targets in Iran\nbut thousands of computers across the world that had nothing to do\nwith Iran or nuclear research. Many lawyers see this facet of cyber\nweapons as proof of their inherent violation of “prevailing codes of\ninternational laws of conflict, as they go beyond just the original\ntarget and deliberately target civilian personnel and infrastructure.”[21]\n\nYet this may be a wrong interpretation, outdated for the cyber\nage. While Stuxnet lacked discretion under the old way of thinking,\nits very design prevented harm to anyone and anything beyond the\nintended target. This kind of discrimination was something never\npreviously possible in a weapon. As George Lucas, a philosopher at\nthe US Naval Academy, wrote in an assessment of Stuxnet’s ethics,\n“Unless you happen to be running a large array of exactly 984\nSiemens centrifuges simultaneously, you have nothing to fear from\nthis worm.”[22]\n\nIn effect, judging the ethics of Stuxnet and cyber weapons more\ngenerally turns on which part of the story you care about most. Do\nyou focus on the fact that this new kind of weapon permitted a\npreemptive attack and in so doing touched thousands of people and\ncomputers who had nothing to do with Iran or nuclear research? Or\ndo you focus on the fact that the cyber strike caused far less damage\nthan any previous comparable attack and that the weapon was so\ndiscriminating it essentially gave new meaning to the term? Are you a\ncyberweapon half full or half empty kind of person?\n\n20. _See_ Colin H. Kahl, _An Israeli Attack Against Iran Would Backfire—_\n_Just Like Israel’s 1981 Strike on Iraq,_ WASH.

It\ndidn’t kill anyone. That’s a good thing. But I am afraid this is only a\nshort-term view. In the long run it has opened Pandora’s box.”[23]\n\n23.
