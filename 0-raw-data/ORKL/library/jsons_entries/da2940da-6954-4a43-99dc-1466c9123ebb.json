Since March 31, 2021, CISA and Ivanti have assisted multiple\nentities whose vulnerable Pulse Connect Secure products have been exploited by a cyber threat actor. These entities confirmed the malicious\n[activity after running the Pulse Secure Connect Integrity Tool. To gain initial access, the threat actor is leveraging multiple vulnerabilities,](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44755)\n[including CVE-2019-11510,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11510) [CVE-2020-8260,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8260) [CVE-2020-8243, and the newly disclosed CVE-2021-22893. The threat actor is using this access](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8243)\nto place webshells on the Pulse Connect Secure appliance for further access and persistence. The known webshells allow for a variety of\nfunctions, including authentication bypass, multi-factor authentication bypass, password logging, and persistence through patching.\n\n**_(Updated May 3, 2021): Ivanti has released_** [Security Advisory SA44784 addressing CVE-2021-22893 and three additional newly disclosed](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/SA44784/)\nCVEs—CVE-2021-22894, CVE-2021-22899, and CVE-2021-22900. CISA strongly encourages organizations using Ivanti Pulse Connect\n[Secure appliances to immediately run the Pulse Secure Connect Integrity Tool, update to the](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44755) [latest software version, and investigate for](https://blog.pulsesecure.net/)\nmalicious activity.\n\n**_(Updated May 27. 2021): CISA has updated this alert to include new threat actor techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs), indicators of_**\n[compromise (IOCs), and updated mitigations.

See the FireEye blog post, ReChecking Your Pulse, for more information, including activity related to actor cleanup.\n\nThe suspected cyber threat actor modified several legitimate Pulse Secure files on the impacted Pulse Connect Secure appliances. The\nmodifications implemented a variety of webshell functionality:\n```\n   DSUpgrade.pm MD5 : 4d5b410e1756072a701dfd3722951907\n\n```\nRuns arbitrary commands passed to it\nCopies malicious code into `Licenseserverproto.cgi`\n```\n   Licenseserverproto.cgi MD5 : 9b526db005ee8075912ca6572d69a5d6\n\n```\nCopies malicious logic to the new files during the patching process, allowing for persistence\n```\n   Secid_canceltoken.cgi MD5 : f2beca612db26d771fe6ed7a87f48a5a\n\n```\nRuns arbitrary commands passed via `HTTP requests`\n```\n   compcheckresult.cgi MD5 : ca0175d86049fa7c796ea06b413857a3\n\n```\nPublicly-facing page to send arbitrary commands with `ID argument`\n```\n   Login.cgi MD5 : 56e2a1566c7989612320f4ef1669e7d5\n\n```\nAllows for credential harvesting of authenticated users\n```\n   Healthcheck.cgi MD5: 8c291ad2d50f3845788bc11b2f603b4a\n\n```\nRuns arbitrary commands passed via `HTTP requests`\n\nMany of the threat actor’s early actions are logged in the Unauthenticated Requests Log as seen in the following format, URIs have been\nredacted to minimize access to webshells that may still be active:\n```\nUnauthenticated request url /dana-na/[redacted URI]?id=cat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/[redacted URI] came from\nIP XX.XX.XX.XX.\n\n```\nThe threat actor then ran the commands listed in table 1 via the webshell.\n\n_Table 1: Commands run via webshell_\n\n**Time** **Command**\n\n2021-01-19T07:46:05.000+0000 `pwd`\n\n2021-01-19T07:46:24.000+0000 `cat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/[redacted]`\n\n2021-01-19T08:10:13.000+0000 `cat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/l[redacted]`\n\n2021-01-19T08:14:18.000+0000 See Appendix.\n\n2021-01-19T08:15:11.000+0000 `cat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/[redacted]`\n\n2021-01-19T08:15:49.000+0000 `cat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/[redacted]`\n\n2021-01-19T09:03:05.000+0000 `cat%20/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/[redacted]`\n\n2021-01-19T09:04:47.000+0000 `$mount`\n\n2021-01-19T09:05:13.000+0000 `/bin/mount%20-o%20remount,rw%20/dev/root%20/`\n\n2021-01-19T09:07:10.000+0000 `$mount`\n\nThe cyber threat actor is using exploited devices located on residential IP space—including publicly facing Network Attached Storage (NAS)\ndevices and small home business routers from multiple vendors—to proxy their connection to interact with the webshells they placed on these\ndevices. These devices, which the threat actor is using to proxy the connection, correlate with the country of the victim and allow the actor\nactivity to blend in with normal telework user activity. Note: these devices are not related to the Pulse vulnerabilities, but rather, where the\nmalicious internet traffic passes through.\n\n\n-----\n\neta s about ate a o e e t a d post e p o tat o a e st u o at t s t e C S update t s a e t as t s o at o beco es\navailable.\n\n## (Updated April 30, 2021): Detections\n\n**_(Updated April 30, 2021): Impossible Travel_**\n\nDuring the course of analysis, it is possible that a network defender may be able to reveal illegitimate connections from users that are\nmasquerading as legitimate users from different geolocations. CISA has noted IPs associated with malicious webshell interaction from a threat\nactor—associated with a single username—in both the authenticated and the unauthenticated logs at the same time. The geo-location for the\ntwo IP addresses was sufficiently far that impossible travel calculations could detect the threat actor IP address.\n\n**_(Updated April 30, 2021): TLS Fingerprinting_**\n\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) fingerprinting may also be useful in identifying malicious activity. CISA has noted re-use of various JA3 hashes\nincluding JA3 hashes that align with Chrome, Firefox, and others. Caution should be taken when using TLS fingerprinting because the majority\nof the JA3 hashes observed in connection with Pulse Connect Secure exploitation were not unique to malicious activity. The same JA3 hashes\n—and the software they characterize—are often used for benign activity, vulnerability scanning, etc. Overlap in JA3 hashes cannot be\nconsidered a high-fidelity indicator of malicious activity, let alone successful exploitation. Connections made via JA3 must be corroborated with\nother data points.\n\nA common observation is that the TLS connections frequently exclude the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension, which is relatively\nrare in most environments where users connect to Domain Name Server (DNS) host names (but is commonly observed in scanning). It is\nbelieved this is an artifact of attackers browsing direct to IP addresses instead of host names.\nThe JA3 hashes in table 2 below have been observed in connection with a pulse secure exploitation. Note: there may be many UserAgents associated with a given JA3 (often due to User-Agent spoofing) and the prevalence of a given JA3 necessarily differs by\nenvironment. The prevalence column of table 2 refers to how often the specific JA3 hash was observed in the dataset that was being\nanalyzed. Some hashes are rarely observed in the dataset and the information is provided for context only. Analytical conclusions should\nnot be made solely based on this reporting. The prevalence of a JA3 hash observed in an environment would need to be further\nevaluated.\n\n_Table 2: JA3 MD5 hashes and associated prevalence/user-agent_\n\n**JA3 Hash** **User-Agent** **Prevalence**\n\n227ab2ae6ed6abcc249e8a873a033144 Firefox (~68-71) very rare\n\n30017f6f809155387cbcf95be6e7225d (UA header frequently not set) rare\n\n3cbc88eabdac9af71445f9040a6cf46c Chrome (~50-57) very rare\n\n53829d58e2631a372bb4de1be2cbecca Chrome (~51-81) rare\n\n714cdf6e462870e2b85d251a3b22064b Firefox (~65-68) very rare\n\n86cb13d6bbb3ac96b78b408bcfc18794 Python-requests, many others common (but rare when used with pulse secure)\n\n8f6747b71d1003df1b7e3e8232b1a7e3 Chrome (~89) rare\n\n916e458922ae9a1bab6b1154689c7de7 Firefox (~60-86) very rare\n\na29d0d294a6236b5bf0ec2573dd4f02f Firefox (~77-87), Chrome (~78-90), others very rare\n\naf26ba5e85475b634275141e6ed3dc54 Python-requests, many others rare\n\nb592adaa596bb72a5c1ccdbecae52e3f Chrome (~79-90) rare\n\nc12f54a3f91dc7bafd92cb59fe009a35 Office, many others very rare\n\n## Mitigations\n\n**(Updated May 3, 2021) CISA strongly urges organizations using Pulse Secure devices to immediately:**\n\n\n-----\n\ne e t e u se Secu e Co ect [teg ty oo Qu c Sta t Gu de a d Custo](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44755) [e](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44764) Qs\n[Run the Pulse Secure Connect Integrity Tool.](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44755)\n\nThe tool requires a reboot.\nIf virtualized, take a snapshot before running.\nIf the appliance is physical, consider the consequences of rebooting and running the tool and contact Ivanti for assistance or\nquestions.\n**(Updated May 3, 2021) Continue to run the tool daily until the XML mitigations have been implemented or the patch has been**\n[deployed.

The Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) helps system owners understand if_**\ntheir Pulse Secure Connect device has been compromised. While the tool is accurate, there are several nuances to its effective use.\n\nThe ICT detects evidence of adversary cleanup only on the current, running version of PCS.\nIt may be necessary to roll back the current PCS version to have a valid run of the ICT.\nDuring the upgrade process, the active version becomes a rollback partition.\nOnly one rollback partition exists on a device, as the rollback partition is replaced on each update.\nTherefore, if an entity has updated their PCS device without running the correct version of the ICT (as outlined in Appendix B),\nanomalous activity will not be detected.\n\nIf the Integrity Checker Tools finds mismatched or unauthorized files, CISA urges organizations to:\n\nContact CISA to report your findings (see Contact Information section below).\nContact [Ivanti Pulse Secure for assistance in capturing forensic information.](https://support.pulsesecure.net/support/support-contacts/)\nReview “Unauthenticated Web Requests” log for evidence of exploitation, if enabled.\nChange all passwords associated with accounts passing through the Pulse Secure environment (including user accounts, service\naccounts, administrative accounts and any accounts that could be modified by any account described above, all of these accounts\nshould be assumed to be compromised). Note: Unless an exhaustive password reset occurs, factory resetting a Pulse Connect Secure\nappliance (see Step 3 below) will only remove malicious code from the device, and may not remove the threat actor from the\nenvironment. The threat actor may use the credentials harvested to regain access even after the appliance is fully patched.\nReview logs for any unauthorized authentications originating from the Pulse Connect Secure appliance IP address or the DHCP lease\nrange of the Pulse Connect Secure appliance's VPN lease pool.\n**_(Updated May 27, 2021)_** **Note: adversary activity may not be easily identifiable on your network as it may appear as a normal user**\ntraffic. If a device has been compromised, entities should take all precautions as if the adversary has intruded past the device into your\nnetwork and take steps to ensure there are no further signs of an intrusion into networks that include:\n\nLook for unauthorized applications and scheduled tasks in environments.\nEnsure no new administrators were created.\nEnsure non-privileged users were not added to privileged groups.\nScrutinize and monitor all accounts with domain administrator privileges.\nMonitor domain administrator accounts to ensure they are only accessing the part of the network they are authorized to access.\nCheck all accounts should be checked to ensure they have the proper level of privileges and have not been altered such as\nincreased privileges.\nRemove any remote access programs not approved by the organization.\nCarefully inspect scheduled tasks for scripts or executables that may allow a threat actor to connect to an environment.\n\nIn addition to the recommendations above, organizations that find evidence of malicious, suspicious, or anomalous activity or files, should\n[consider the guidance in KB44764 - Customer FAQ: PCS Security Integrity Tool Enhancements, which includes:](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44764)\n\nAfter preservation, you can remediate your Pulse Connect Secure appliance by:\n\n1.
