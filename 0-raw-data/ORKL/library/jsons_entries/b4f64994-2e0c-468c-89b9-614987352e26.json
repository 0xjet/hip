He said, “With respect to remote computer intrusions, for example,\nthe [DOJ] indictment of APT 10 hackers in December 2018 outlined a global campaign,\nassociated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, targeting intellectual property\nand confidential business and technology information…” (Department of Justice, 2020).\n\nWhile Chinese IP theft is now a story old enough for the history books, there continue\nto be new chapters to add with new lessons to learn for security teams and the\norganizations they serve.\n\nIn this report, BlackBerry researchers examine the activities of five related adversarial\ngroups who have spent the better part of the last decade successfully targeting\norganizations in cross-platform attacks while operating relatively, if not entirely\nundetected in multiple strategic and economic espionage operations.\n\nThe report details how this quintet of threat actor groups have been focused on an\noften-overlooked platform: Linux[®] servers that comprise the backbone of the majority\nof large data centers responsible for the some of the most sensitive enterprise network\noperations. And it further reveals the link between a previously unidentified Linux\nmalware toolset and one of the largest Linux botnets ever discovered.\n\nThe newly discovered Linux malware toolset included two kernel-level rootkits that\nrendered executables extremely difficult to detect, making it highly probable that the\nnumber of impacted organizations is significant and the duration of the infections\nlengthy. This report provides analysis of the attacks, the toolset, the rootkits, the other\nmalware, and the infrastructure involved.\n\nThe research also provides analysis of attacks designed to elude defenders through\nthe use of Windows[®] malware that uses adware code-signing certificates, a tactic\nthat the attackers hope will increase infection rates as any red flags are dismissed as\njust another blip in a constant stream of adware alerts. This report examines multiple\nsamples of malware accompanied by the adware code-signing certificates.\n\n\nThe researchers also look at the targeting of another often-neglected attack vector: the\nmobile devices that increasingly make up a significant portion the enterprise network\nperimeter. A previous report from BlackBerry[®] researchers, titled Mobile Malware and\n_APT Espionage: Prolific, Pervasive, and Cross-Platform (BlackBerry, 2019), examined_\nhow APT groups have been leveraging mobile malware in combination with traditional\ndesktop malware in ongoing cross-platform surveillance and espionage campaigns.\nThis report continues the analysis of this trend with an examination of some newly\nidentified Android[™] malware.\n\nThe report also delves into the curious case of a mobile remote access trojan (RAT) that\nwas developed by an APT group nearly two years prior to the commercial availability\nof a popular remote administration penetration testing tool that has strikingly similar\ncode structure and characteristics, raising questions about the origins of each.\n\nThis report provides a threat intelligence assessment of the strategic and tactical\nuse of novel malware and attack techniques employed by several threat actors. The\nconclusions drawn here represent the best judgments of the researchers based on\ndata examined.\n\n### While Chinese IP theft is now a story old enough for the history books, there continue to be new chapters to add with new lessons to learn for security teams and the organizations they serve.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Key Findings\n\n##### Strategic Intelligence Assessments:\n\n**• Targeting Linux: Adversaries assessed to be acting in the interests of the Chinese**\ngovernment have strategically targeted Linux servers for years precisely because the\nLinux operating system is not typically a primary focus of security solutions. Defensive\ncoverage within Linux environments is immature at best, and robust endpoint\nprotection (EPP) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) products are often\ninadequately utilized or lack the capabilities to defend them. It was assessed that the\ngroups examined in this report are using Linux servers as a “network beachhead” for\nother operations – that is, as a highly available attack vector that is always-on and\npoorly defended.\n\n**• APT Groups Coordinating: Persistent threats rarely operate in a single domain, and the**\nfive groups assessed to be related to the APT originally identified as WINNTI GROUP\nin previously published research are no exception. Many of the techniques used in one\noperating environment have been readily translated for use in others. Cross-platform\nand open-source tools are more readily available now than ever, and the APT groups\nexamined in this report have already exploited this fact.\n\n**• Objective Blending and Overlap: BlackBerry researchers observed the continued**\nblending of financially motivated and targeted espionage activity by the five groups\nunder examination in this report. The more traditional criminal approaches to\nnetwork exploitation are equally effective in their intelligence gathering as they are\nin generating revenue. Attacks that look like dragnet, “spray and pray” efforts can\nalso yield targeted reconnaissance intelligence for other operations, and strategic\nplatform and supply-chain compromises are becoming increasingly commonplace.\n\n\n\n**• Attackers for Hire: It is assessed with high confidence that the APT groups examined**\nin this report are likely comprised of civilian contractors working in the interest of the\nChinese government who readily share tools, techniques, infrastructure, and targeting\ninformation with one another and their government counterparts. This reflects a highly\nagile government/contractor ecosystem with few of the bureaucratic or legal hurdles\nthat can be observed in Western nations with similar capabilities and provides a level\nof plausible deniability for the Chinese government.\n\n### These groups target Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, and Ubuntu Linux environments systemically across a wide array of industry verticals for the purposes of espionage and intellectual property theft.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Tactical Intelligence Assessments:\n\n**• The WINNTI Approach:** Five APT groups acting in the interest of the Chinese\ngovernment and assessed to be employing WINNTI-style tooling have taken strategic\naim at Linux servers that serve a critical role in enterprise network environments and\nhave done so while remaining relatively undetected for nearly a decade. These groups\ntarget Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, and Ubuntu Linux environments systemically\nacross a wide array of industry verticals for the purposes of espionage and intellectual\nproperty theft. The APT groups examined include the original WINNTI GROUP, PASSCV,\nBRONZE UNION, CASPER (LEAD), and a newly identified group BlackBerry researchers\nare tracking as WLNXSPLINTER. All five groups are assessed to be related given the\ndistinct similarities in their tools, tactics and procedures (TTPs) employed and referred\nto in this report as the WINNTI approach.\n\n**• The Linux Connection: The APT groups examined in this report have traditionally**\npursued different objectives and focused on a wide array of targets. However, it was\nobserved that there is a significant degree of coordination between these groups,\nparticularly where targeting of Linux platforms is concerned, and it is assessed that\nany organization with a large Linux distribution should not assume they are outside\nof the target sets for any of these groups.\n\n**• The XOR DDoS Botnet Connection: It was also observed that the malware used by**\nWINNTI GROUP very closely resembles that used in the massive Linux XOR DDoS\nbotnet first identified in September of 2014, to the extent that BlackBerry researchers\nhave judged the botnet to have been a tool developed by this group.\n\n**• Code Similarities: A PASSCV Android implant examined in this report very closely**\nresembles code marketed as the penetration testing tool NetWire for Android, yet the\nmalware is shown to have been compiled nearly two years before the commercial\nNetWire tool was first made available for purchase.\n\n\n\n**• Hiding in Plain Sight: The APT groups examined in this report have shifted from**\nsigning malware certificates stolen from video game companies to signing malware\nwith certificates stolen from adware vendors, resulting in very low detection rates. It\nis assessed that this was being done to bypass network defenders by hiding malware\nwithin the high volume of innocuous adware alerts large organizations typically receive\nin any given day.\n\n**• Cloud Migration: It has been observed that there has been a shift in infrastructure**\nhosting towards the more frequent adoption of established, legitimate cloud services,\npresenting a challenge to defenders’ assumptions regarding the monitoring of trusted\nnetwork traffic within their organizations’ networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Why the Targeting of Linux Systems Matters\n\n\nLinux is arguably the most important yet least user-friendly operating system in the\nworld. While most people are unlikely to be using it on their desktop at work or at home,\nLinux dominates the backend infrastructure of large modern data centers.\n\nLinux runs the stock exchanges in New York, London and Tokyo, and nearly all the\nbig tech and e-commerce giants are dependent on it, including the likes of Google,\nYahoo, and Amazon. Most U.S. government agencies and the Department of Defense\nalso rely heavily on the Linux operating system, and it runs virtually all of the top onemillion websites and 75% of all web servers (Netcraft, 2019). Linux powers 98% of the\nworld’s most advanced supercomputers, and if you or your organization stores data in\nthe cloud, you’ll find Linux running in the background more than 75% of the time (Linux\nFoundation, 2020).\n\nGiven the open-source nature of Linux, it is generally considered to be a more secure\nand require less maintenance, making it the ideal operating system for backend servers.\nBehind the scenes at government agencies, universities, and corporations around the\nworld, you’ll find Linux on servers that house sensitive data as well as those that keep\ncritical systems up and running.\n\nLinux keeps the lights on when the employees have all gone home for the night, which\nmeans servers running Linux are trusted to be always-on and always accessible.\nThese qualities have made Linux the operating system of choice for many systems\nadministrators – and also a strategic target for state-sponsored espionage operations.\n\n\nIn this section of the report, BlackBerry researchers lay bare how a quintet of APT\ngroups acting in the interest of the Chinese government - assessed to be offshoots of\nthe original WINNTI GROUP - developed the capability to exploit the “always-on, always\navailable” nature of Linux servers to establish an operations beachhead in targeted\nnetworks while remaining almost entirely undetected for nearly a decade.\n\n### BlackBerry researchers lay bare how a quintet of APT groups acting in the interest of the Chinese government - assessed to be offshoots of the original WINNTI GROUP - developed the capability to exploit the “always- on, always available” nature of Linux servers to establish an operations beachhead in targeted networks while remaining almost entirely undetected for nearly a decade.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Linux Advantage\n\nLinux servers, whether located on-premises or with a cloud provider, are an ideal and\nstrategic target of espionage for several reasons:\n\n**• Compromising Linux web servers allows for the exfiltration of massive amounts of**\ndata that can be obscured within the high volume of daily web traffic\n\n**• Compromising Linux database servers provides attackers a greater chance of finding**\nvaluable data like sensitive intellectual property, trade secrets, or lists of employee\nusernames and passwords relatively quickly\n\n**• Compromising Linux jump-boxes, aka bastion or proxy servers, erases a layer of**\nprotection typically relied upon by most corporate networks to separate internal\nnetworks from external threats\n\nAll three types of servers described above – web, database, and proxy – are designed\nto be “up” all the time, meaning the same benefits they provide system administrators\n(continuous, reliable network access) are also afforded to the attackers who\ncompromise them, making them a perfect staging area from which to penetrate other\nareas of the network.\n\nWhat’s more, all the source code for the Linux distributions commonly seen in corporate\nand government environments, including Red Hat Enterprise, Ubuntu, and CentOS,\nis freely available to examine. This plays to one of an APTs key strengths: it allows\nknowledge of the operating system to be more readily exploited and for the tools\ndesigned to circumvent security to be more effective.\n\n\nAs described in Chinese Industrial Espionage (Hannas, Mulvenon, & Puglisi, 2013), the\nChinese are more adept than any other nation in absorbing, translating, and leveraging\nopen-source material: “Not only does China invest far more effort in open-source\ncollection than other countries, the ‘back-end’ components – analysis, customer\ninteraction, and feedback to collectors – also play a much larger part, as befits a nation\nwhose progress depends more on adaptation than innovation.”\n\nIn the attacks BlackBerry observed, the open Linux platform has enabled Chinese actors\nto develop backdoors, kernel rootkits, and online-build environments at a high level of\ncomplexity and specificity, with the end result being a toolset specifically designed to\nbe harder to detect. Compounding low detection rates inherent in the malware design\nis the relative lack of coverage quality and features in malware detection solutions for\nLinux available on the market today.\n\nLinux’s command-line interface also makes it less widely accessible, which means it is\nusually administered by a smaller number of skilled systems administrators. In contrast,\npractically everyone from the corner office to the mailroom uses desktop computers\nrunning either Windows or MacOS[®], so most security companies have focused more\nof their research and development on products for the front office as opposed to the\nserver rack.\n\nThe combination of poor security solution coverage for Linux and highly tailored,\ncomplex malware has resulted in a suite of adversary tools that has largely - if not\nentirely - gone undetected for years.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Penguin Malware – A Relatively Rare Bird\n\n\nBefore proceeding with a discussion of the findings, readers of this report may find it\nhelpful to know something of the Linux threat landscape more generally for context:\n\nGroups associated with the state or state-sponsored efforts of at least three\ngovernments have been found to develop and deploy Linux malware: China, Russia,\nand the United States. A class of Linux malware called Derusbi has been known to be\nused by APT groups acting in the interest China, including LEVIATHAN (APT40), DEEP\nPANDA, AXIOM, and APT41 (MITRE, 2017). In 2014, Kaspersky discovered that the\nRussian group TURLA was also deploying Linux malware (Baumgartner & Raiu, 2014),\nand another group Kaspersky identifies as THE EQUATION GROUP (generally thought\nto be the NSA) has also targeted Linux servers extensively.\n\nIn May of 2019, researchers at Chronicle detailed several Linux implants believed to be\nassociated with APT41 based on an examination of a network protocol similar to the\nDoubleDoor implants (Chronicle, 2019). The protocol used a single-byte incrementing\nXOR key for string obfuscation and employed an LKM rootkit based on the open-source\n“Azazel” project.\n\nHowever, in comparison to the volume of malware directed at Windows and MacOS\noperating systems, Linux malware is observed and written about much less often. This\nis reflective of its relatively low rate of detection and relatively low frequency of being\nencountered in incident response engagements.\n\n\nThe paucity of public knowledge about the Linux threat landscape presents obvious\nchallenges in piecing together attack scenarios and understanding them completely.\nBut at least one assessment can be made with near complete certainty: the amount\nand age of the Linux malware tools wielded by the threat groups discussed in this report\nare confirmation that the targeting of Linux has been wildly successful.\n\n### But at least one assessment can be made with near complete certainty: the amount and age of the Linux malware tools wielded by the threat groups discussed in this report are confirmation that the targeting of Linux has been wildly successful.\n\n\n-----\n\n## WINNTI Splinter Cell Targeting Linux\n\n\nBlackBerry researchers have assessed that there are at least five APT groups acting in\nthe interest of the Chinese government which together comprise a “splinter cell” that\ntargets enterprise Linux distributions, all of which are related to one another and to an\nAPT identified in earlier research as WINNNTI GROUP.\n\nFor the first time, BlackBerry researchers have assessed that these groups are all\nsharing a previously unidentified Linux malware toolset referred to in this report as the\nWINNTILNX toolset. It should be noted that these groups have also been observed\ntargeting other platforms as well, including Windows, Android, and MacOS.\n\nFour of these five groups are already known to the security community as PASSCV,\nBRONZE UNION (aka APT27, EMISSARY PANDA), a group tracked internally as CASPER\n(aka LEAD), and the original WINNTI GROUP. But the fifth Linux splinter cell group, which\nBlackBerry researchers are tracking as WLNXSPLINTER, is discussed for the first time\nin this report. These threat actor groups share three important characteristics:\n\n**• All five groups examined in this report have been observed attacking video game**\ncompanies to steal code-signing certificates which they used to sign their malware,\nas well as attacking the gaming companies for criminal purposes to produce revenue.\n\n**• All five groups share tools, suggesting several possible scenarios: a formal “digital**\nquartermaster” arrangement (a la FireEye); an informal “hacker forum” type of toolswap; personnel overlap between the groups; or a re-tasking of the same groups\ntoward different target sets.\n\n\n\n**• Their targets run the gamut of nearly all verticals, and activities range from simple**\ncybercrime to full-blown economic espionage, and from internal monitoring of\npolitically dissenting populations to more traditional military and strategic nationstate espionage. These groups’ collective palette is wide and well-developed, touching\nnearly every industry sector across a huge geographic area.\n\nAt least one of these groups, referred to in this report as Kaspersky’s original WINNTI\nGROUP, can now be linked more strongly - if not explicitly - to China’s Ministry of State\nSecurity (MSS) based on this research, a discussion taken up in earnest in the Attribution\nsection near the end of this report.\n\n### These groups’ collective palette is wide and well-developed, touching nearly every industry sector across a huge geographic area.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Linux Splinter Cell Toolset\n\nBlackBerry researchers have discovered that the Linux splinter groups have developed\nand deployed the following tools, collectively referred to as the WINNTILNX toolset.\nIncluded in the toolset are:\n\n**• Three backdoors, all of which are unique variants and designated as:**\n\n**• PWNLNX1**\n\n**• PWNLNX2**\n\n**• PWNLNX3**\n\n**• Two rootkits which are deployed simultaneously with the backdoors, all of which are**\nthe Linux Kernel Module variety and designated as:\n\n**• PWNLNX4**\n\n**• PWNLNX6**\n\n**• Two build-groups which are used to construct the rootkits on-the-fly and tailor them**\nto their targets, designated as:\n\n**• Group 1 (online)**\n\n**• Group 2 through Group 6 (local)**\n\n**• An installer script used to remotely compile, download, and install both an LKM rootkit**\nand a backdoor on the target, designated as:\n\n**• Lancer**\n\n**• A Control Panel used by the attackers to run the command-and-control (C2)**\ninfrastructure and issue commands to the rest of the malware suite (for both Windows\nand Linux) and designated as:\n\n**• PWNLNX5**\n\n\n\n**• A massive Linux botnet:**\n\n**• XOR.DDoS which was first identified in September of 2014 and known to**\nhave been used to attack video game companies in Asia, among others\n\nWhen BlackBerry researchers first uncovered this malware suite, they were curious to\nknow how long it had been in use but determining that proved to be a nontrivial task.\nLinux malware executables are referred to by the term ELF, which stands for Executable\n_and Linkable Format. Unlike their Windows counterparts (called PEs or Portable_\n_Executables), ELFs do not possess a compiler time/date stamp, which makes it difficult_\nto discern exactly when Linux samples were created.\n\nHowever, ELFs often contain a reference to the compiler used to create them, and the\nage of that compiler can provide a very rough indication of the age of the ELF. Here’s\nhow this was accomplished:\n\nThe simple command line “objdump -s --section .comment {full path to binary}” can\nbe used to extract this information from an ELF file if it is present. ELF files may also\ncontain references to the source files they were compiled from, in this case:\n\n**• crtstuff.c** **• hide.c** **• pty.c** **• crc32.c**\n\n**• down.c** **• main.c** **• socket.c** **• dns.c**\n\n**• encrypt.c** **• portforward.c** **• udp.c**\n\n**• file.c** **• portmap.c** **• up.c**\n\nThe earliest sample BlackBerry researchers identified using this method was compiled\nwith “GCC: (GNU) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-3)” which was released on March 13,\n2012, suggesting that WLNXSPLINTER has potentially been in use for roughly the last\neight years.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe age of this suite is a salient point and should not be underestimated. Though there\nwas not enough data from incident response engagements to paint a complete picture\nof the attack chain, its longevity combined with the low (in some cases zero) detection\nrates for the malware suggests that the suite has been successful in establishing and\nmaintaining itself in target environments for quite some time.\n\nIt’s also important to note that the backdoors communicated both to internal as well as\nexternal IP addresses. This indicates that the groups attacked servers that were both\ndeliberately segmented to keep them from connecting to the internet (a practice often\njudged to make them more secure), as well as connecting to web servers that reached\noutside the target organization.\n\nThe infection of internal-only servers indicates that the attackers were either successful\nin exploiting “crown jewel-type” data normally kept in such vaults, or that they had\nplanned ahead and established a backup point of access in case other avenues were\ndiscovered and blocked.\n\n##### PWNLNX1: A Backdoor\n\nThe WINNTI GROUP made very few alterations to the backdoor designated as PWNLNX1\nover the years, with the exception of some minor feature additions. Yet even after all this\ntime, the majority of the samples examined have a zero-detection rate in the industry’s\nmost commonly used virus repository.\n\nPWNLNX1 was designed to work with a Local Kernel Module (LKM), which enabled\nit to perform a number of rootkit functions like bypassing iptables, hiding files, hiding\nprocesses, hiding threads, and hiding network connections. It also provided the\nattackers with the ability to upload and download files, enumerate and manipulate files\nand directories, access an interactive shell, forward traffic and ports, and modify and\nconnect to the embedded command-and-control (C2) servers over TCP and UDP, as\nwell as over IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nThe backdoor encoded its network callback information using a simple operation\nagainst XOR keys “CB2FA36AAA9541F0” or “BB2FA36AAA9541F0” was only observed\nin earlier samples.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the group we call CASPER (aka LEAD) utilized another unique\nXOR key in its version of PWNLNX1: “1A2FB36DAC95E1F9”. The corresponding C2\ndomains were resolved using external servers hard coded into the files, either “8.8.8[.]8”\nor “114.114.114[.]114.”\n\nAn example of the encrypted and decrypted configurations are presented below,\nalong with the simple python snippet to perform this operation without preserving the\nnull values:\n\n_Figure 1: Encoded Configuration of PWNLNX1_\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ndef rolling_xor(buf, key):\n  out = ‘’\n  k = 0\n  for i in buf:\n   if k == len(key):\n     k = 0\n   out += chr(ord(i) ^ ord(key[k]))\n   k += 1\n  return out\n\n```\nrolling_xor(config_block, ‘CB2FA36AAA9541F0’)\n\n\n_Figure 2: Decoded Configuration of PWNLNX1_\n\n\n_Figure 3: Python Pseudocode to Decrypt Configuration Block of PWNLNX1_\n\nBlackBerry researchers were able to link the use of this backdoor to multiple intrusion\nsets that have been previously publicly identified. They did this based upon the\nobservations of the distinct C2 infrastructure, subdomain similarities, and other unique\ncharacteristics.\n\nGiven the diverse range of targets for each group in the Linux splinter cell quintet, it is\nassessed with high confidence that there was likely some sort of common direction,\nnexus, or at the very least shared tooling between the groups.\n\n### Given the diverse range of targets for each group in the Linux splinter cell quintet, it is assessed with high confidence that there was likely some sort of common direction, nexus, or at the very least shared tooling between the groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### PWNLNX1 C2 Infrastructure\n\n**WINNTI GROUP:** **PASSCV:** **CASPER (LEAD):**\n\nark.aeriagames[.]us dns.0pengl[.]com bot2.googlerenewals[.]net\n\nwww.alidnx[.]com 35.201.147[.]249 linux2.googlerenewals[.]net\n\n10.79.120[.]10 sdfaswaed2.nokiadns[.]com\n\n10.79.250[.]80 serconsole.vicp[.]cc\n\n10.79.4[.]131\n\nmi.btmods[.]net (maybe BRONZE UNION)\n\nus.btmods[.]net (maybe BRONZE UNION)\n\n**BRONZE UNION (APT27/EMISSARY PANDA):**\n\ny3dx36f6.love6d[.]com\n\nkdwontyraqdswlqm[.]ossrescue.com\n\nl3wpk9kmumodtkr8[.]ibmassist.com\n\n##### The Linux XOR.DDoS Botnet\n\nWhile BlackBerry researchers were unable to recover the local kernel module from\nan active infection, examination of how WINNTI GROUP’s PWNLNX1 interacted with\nits rootkit provided a startling discovery: an explicit link to one of the largest Linux\nbotnets ever, which was discovered in September of 2014, and dubbed “Linux.XorDDoS”\n(Malware Must Die!, 2014).\n\nThe Xor.DDoS botnet earned notoriety in 2015 for its high-bandwidth attacks of up to\n150 GBPS. According to researchers at Akamai, the botnet was observed attacking 20\ntargets per day, 90% of them in Asia, with video game companies leading the target\nlist (Akamai, 2015).\n\n\nAkamai observed that the botnet grew in size after using brute force attacks to obtain\nthe password for the target Linux server. The attackers then simply logged in to the\nserver to drop the botnet malware (Akamai, 2015). Curiously, despite its size and relative\nfirepower, news of widespread denial of service reports has proven difficult to find. This\nbegs the question: Why build a giant DDoS botnet if you don’t intend to disrupt websites?\n\nIn investigating further, BlackBerry researchers found that PWNLNX1 utilized a device\nnamed “/proc/rs_dev” for rootkit functionality. This is the exact same device name used\nin the botnet. What’s more, early PWNLNX1 samples even used the exact same string\nas an XOR key for network traffic obfuscation: “BB2FA36AAA9541F0”.\n\nThese combination of these factors – the age of the malware, repeated use of the exact\nsame XOR key, code reuse, and targeting of the video game industry - indicated either\nthere was a sharing between the WINNTI GROUP and the group behind the botnet or they\nwere in fact one and the same. Of those two possibilities, BlackBerry researchers judged\nthe latter to be more likely, and that WINNTI GROUP was behind the Xor.DDoS botnet.\n\nThis was a surprising find, as it was not expected to find the kernel modules used by\nPWNLNX1 had employed different ioctl codes for the same functionality. This told us\nthat the Linux Kernel Modules (LKMs) were different despite using many of the same\nfunction names.\n\nA little more digging lead us to conclude that both were instead based off of the\nopen-source “Suterusu Rootkit” (Coppola, Suterusu Rootkit: Inline Kernel Function\nHooking on x86 and ARM, 2013). This, in contrast, wasn’t at all surprising given China’s\naforementioned affinity for and skill in leveraging open-source material.\n\nAvast analyzed the Linux.Xorddos rootkit in detail in a blog post from January of 2015\n(Avast Threat Intelligence Team, 2015). Of particular note was for any LKM to function\nproperly, its “vermagic” value must match that of the currently installed kernel headers\non the victim’s system.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis meant that each rootkit would have to be specifically compiled for the victim\nsystem it was deployed on. The Linux.Xorddos rootkit had a solution for this problem\nthrough an online build server that was accessed through a series of HTTP GET\nrequests, as detailed in Avast’s blog. For the sake of brevity, this report will simply point\nout the second GET request because it turned out to be of particular interest. Indeed,\nit factored into other portions of this research, as described below.\n\nLet’s look at this second GET request in more detail here. Below you’ll find an attempt\nto start to break it down, beginning with the request to “/compiler?”. Note the first three\nsteps taken were lookup hash of kernel, enter username to build server, enter password:\n\n**Additional Parameter** **Value** **Function**\n\niid= CE74BF62ACFE944B2167248DD0674977 Lookup\nHash of Kernel\n\nusername= admin Username to Access\nBuild Server\n\n&password= admin Password to Access\nBuild Server\n\nip= 103.25.9[.]245:8005|103.240.141[.]5 C2 Servers\n0:8005[snip]\n\n&ver= 3.8.0-19-generic\\ SMP\\ mod_ Full Kernel Version\nunload [snip]\n\nkernel= 3.8.0 Base Kernel Version\n\n_Figure 4: Breakdown of Build Server Request (We’ll Come Back to This…)_\n\n\n##### PWNLNX4: An LKM Rootkit\n\nAfter further analyzing how PWNLNX1 interacted with its rootkit, BlackBerry was able\nto recover several different iterations of the PWNLNX4 rootkit. At the time of writing\nthis report, most of the identified rootkits were undetected by any antivirus vendor. The\nrootkits were modified versions of the “Suterusu” rootkit; each contained modifications\nto directly patch the TCP and UDP socket tables, process tables, and file tables.\n\nIn still another example of skillful exploitation of open-source material, the code\nresponsible for these modifications appears to have been directly lifted from a book\nwritten by Ivan Sklyarov. Note how all the function names and code are identical to\nthose described in Programming Linux Hacker Tools Uncovered: Exploits, Backdoors,\n_Scanners, Sniffers, Brute-Forcers, Rootkits (Sklyarov, 2007)._\n\n##### Linux Build Environments\n\nSo, what else can be gleaned from a more or less open-source rootkit? BlackBerry\nresearchers identified several different groups of build environments based upon\nleftover path information:\n\n**Build Group1:**\n\n**• Build Environment 1: “/opt/uOnlineBuilder64/core/build/yang/rk”**\n\n**• /opt/uOnlineBuilder64/core/build/yang/rk/lkm.c**\n\n**• /opt/uOnlineBuilder64/core/build/yang/rk/autoipv6.mod.c**\n\n**• “”/build/yang/AB1167FF11C7B8642D547D84AEDD8B46/2.6.32-358.**\nel6.x86_64\n\n**• Build Environment 2: /opt/uOnlineBuilder64/core/build/hehe/rk**\n\n**• /opt/uOnlineBuilder64/core/build/hehe/rk/lkm.c**\n\n**• /opt/uOnlineBuilder64/core/build/hehe/rk/autoipv6.mod.c**\n\n**• “”/build/hehe/4F666C7AA5F592EF64E9B2AFFE2**\n67B0F/2.6.32-754.6.3.el6.x86_64\n\n\n-----\n\n**• Build Environment 3: /opt/uOnlineBuilder64/core/build/maomao/rk**\n\n**• /opt/uOnlineBuilder64/core/build/maomao/rk/lkm.c**\n\n**• /opt/uOnlineBuilder64/core/build/maomao/rk/ip4tables.mod.c**\n\n**• “”/build/maomao/01944A09FD7592DDFEF4AD4825AB6329/2.6.32-431.11.29.**\nel6.ucloud.x86_64\n\n**Build Group 2:**\n\n**• Build Environment: /root/Desktop/dns**\n\n**• /root/Desktop/dns/lkm.c**\n\n**• /root/Desktop/dns/snd_raw.mod.c**\n\n**• /usr/src/kernels/2.6.32-642.el6.x86_64**\n\n**• /usr/src/kernels/2.6.32-431.el6.x86_64**\n\n**Build Group 3:**\n\n**• Build Environment: /var/tmp/.1**\n\n**• /var/tmp/.1/lkm.c**\n\n**• /var/tmp/.1/autoipv6.mod.c**\n\n**• /usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-693.2.2.el7.x86_64**\n\n**Build Group 4:**\n\n**• Build Environment: /var/tmp/Linux_Server**\n\n**• /var/tmp/Linux_Server/lkm.c**\n\n**• /var/tmp/Linux_Server/dhcp.mod.c**\n\n**• /usr/src/kernels/2.6.32-358.14.1.el6.x86_64**\n\n**Build Group 5:**\n\n**• Build Environment: /dev/shm/2.6.32microcode**\n\n**• /dev/shm/2.6.32microcode/lkm.c**\n\n**• /dev/shm/2.6.32microcode/microcode.mod.c**\n\n**• /usr/src/kernels/2.6.32-358.14.1.el6.x86_64**\n\n\n**Build Group 6:**\n\n**• Build Environment: //home/rhudgins/2.6.32floppy**\n\n**• /home/rhudgins/2.6.32floppy/lkm.c**\n\n**• /home/rhudgins/2.6.32floppy/ipmi_devintf.mod.c**\n\n**• /usr/src/kernels/2.6.32-358.14.1.el6.x86_64**\n\nBased upon included path information, Groups 2-6 were likely compiled directly on\nvictim machines, not online. In each case the attacker had already obtained access to\nthe server, e.g. through compromised credentials. Group 1 grabbed our interest because\nsome of the additional path information indicated that an online build environment\nexisted which could potentially compile and deliver the rootkits on-the-fly based upon\nthe version of the kernel headers which it tracked, and not just by an MD5 hash but by\nusername as well.\n\nThe usernames seen in the Group 1 path names above weren’t terribly revealing but were\ninteresting to note nonetheless because they included: “yang”, “hehe”, and “maomao”.\nHere’s where the “username” and “password” asked for in Figure 2 above plays in: in\norder to begin accessing the online build server, a username and password must be\nprovided, and here’s where “yang” and crew signed in before getting down to business.\n\nBlackBerry researchers found that each of the victims’ kernel versions indicated they\nwere all running various versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS – by using this\ninformation it was possible to discover the earliest possible compromise date for each\nvictim (Red Hat, 2019).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Kernel Versions Indicating Earliest Possible Compromise Dates_\n\n##### PWNLNX2: Another Backdoor\n\nBlackBerry researchers discovered a second variant designated as PWNLNX2 which\nfirst appeared around 2017 and was used into early 2018. BlackBerry researchers\nascribed these particular variants to the threat groups previously identified as PASSCV\nand BRONZE UNION (aka APT27, EMISSARY PANDA).\n\nThese backdoors were extremely similar to the earlier PWNLNX1 samples and\ncontained the same function names, backdoor functionality, LKM rootkit name and\nioctl’s, commands from the C2, and they were even compiled from source files bearing\nthe exact same names.\n\nHowever, the backdoors were significantly larger in size, weighing in at nearly one\nmegabyte. As with earlier samples discussed, they were all undetected in the common\nmalware repository with the exception of one sample, which was mistakenly identified\nby a single vendor as belonging to a DDoS botnet. BlackBerry researchers originally\nidentified these files from the unique XML output of a function responsible for\nconducting file-based reconnaissance of the victim’s machine and then used this to\nlocate both a 32-bit and 64-bit versions.\n\n\nAdditional functions were present which would determine information about the\ncurrent operating system and kernel version from the file “/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease”.\nIf the version was less than or equal to 2.6.11, the backdoor would terminate. The\nbackdoors also contained some advanced functionality that would enable them to\nenumerate and manipulate pages of physical memory – features that were not present\nin earlier versions.\n\n##### PWNLNX2 C2 Infrastructure\n\n**PASSCV:** **BRONZE UNION / APT 27:**\n\ndns.0pengl[.]com tab.dellrescue[.]com\n\nlinux.cocoss2d[.]com\n\nlinux.css2[.]com\n\nlinux.unitys3d[.]com\n\nThree of the above domains were previously identified in October of 2016 as belonging\nto the PASSCV group by BlackBerry (Cylance Threat Research Team, 2016); however, no\nassociated Linux malware samples were identified at the time. These domains currently\nresolve to IP addresses that reside within several large cloud providers’ infrastructures.\nThis tactical shift makes complete sense as cloud infrastructure provides a costeffective solution that’s easily managed and deployed. As an added benefit, network\ndefenders tend to trust IP ranges that belong to well-known cloud provider companies.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### PWNLNX6 Updated LKM Rootkit\n\nBased upon unique submitter identification numbers, BlackBerry researchers were\nable to locate another modified version of the Suterusu Rootkit which the attackers\nreferred to “xinted.ko”. This particular version of the rootkit, which is designated here as\nPWNLNX6, was compiled using a newer version of GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) with\nan exact build command matching that of the one used for “Build Group 3” mentioned\nabove. It looks like this:\n\n**• Build Environment: /tmp/suterusu**\n\n**• /tmp/suterusu/main.c**\n\n**• /tmp/suterusu/util.c**\n\n**• /tmp/suterusu/module.c**\n\n**• /tmp/suterusu/xinted.mod.c**\n\n**• /usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-693.17.1.el7.x86_64**\n\nSeveral functions were absent, notably the routines to directly patch the TCP and UDP\ntables. However, the most significant change was the creation and implementation of\na custom Netlink Protocol to replace the previously used ioctl codes. The following\nblog gives a good high-level overview of the Netlink Protocol and how to implement a\ncustom one: Implementing a New Custom Netlink Family Protocol (Jang, 2019).\n\nIn essence, this change enabled the attackers to communicate more efficiently from\nthe kernel to user side of the target machine. A different Netlink protocol appears to\nhave also been implemented within the original Suterusu source code around the same\ntime in June of 2017, one which may have provided the operators inspiration for their\nown protocol. In regular English: all of these changes meant there was at least one\nmore variant in this family of backdoors that BlackBerry researchers had yet to identify.\n\n\n##### PWNLNX3: A Backdoor\n\nBlackBerry researchers went digging a little further, and while the implant that\nimplemented the newer Netlink Protocol was not located, yet another 2018 variant\nwithin the WINNTILNX toolset turned up, designated here as PWNLNX3.\n\nThe PWNLNX3 samples were significantly larger still, weighing in at nearly four\nmegabytes. Surprisingly, three of these samples were detected by approximately twenty\ndifferent vendors, give or take, under various monikers. “Linux.Agent.by” was perhaps\nthe most accurate industry detection, but another earlier sample went fully undetected\nas late as February 10, 2018.\n\nTwo of the identified samples referenced a new rootkit module named “/proc/policy4_\ndev”. They similarly utilized a different ioctl code that was one-byte off from previously\nidentified samples, “0x46375828”, to interact with the rootkit.\n\nThe code used to update the backdoor to a newer version was reworked, but otherwise\nthe core functionality of the backdoor was more or less unchanged from earlier samples.\nTwo new functions implemented named “HandleUpdate” and “execUpdate” which would\ndownload a file from the C2 server using the command line “wget -P” to the directory “/\ntmp” and run “chmod 777” on the file, making it world readable, writable, and executable\nbefore running the update package. Several newer and distinct C2 servers were used\nto administer these particular samples.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### PWNLNX3 C2 Infrastructure\n\n**PASSCV:** **WLNXSPLINTER:**\n\nb.zabbixx[.]com cachecdn.moegoo[.]com\n\ngs.gw688[.]org\n\norabbix.zabbixmonitor[.]net\n\nyum.anydesk[.]me\n\nyum.nortonvirus[.]org\n\nzabbix.symanteprotection[.]com\n\nThe domains “zabbixx[.]com”, “gw688[.]org”, and “zabbixmonitor[.]net” were all first\nregistered on June 19, 2018 using “dns.com”, then transferred to “1-api.org” on June\n29, 2019, and then transferred back to “dns.com” on July 5, 2019. Using this particular\nregistration pattern, BlackBerry researchers identified that the following domains are\nalso highly likely to be under the attacker’s control: live800kf[.]com, observeit[.]org,\nshterm[.]net, vncviewer[.]org.\n\nBlackBerry researchers attribute the above collection of domains to the PASSCV group\nwith moderate to high confidence based upon other subdomains resolving to a common\nIP address - “58.84.54[.]146” - where several other previously identified domains currently\nresolve (Cylance Threat Research Team, 2016). The list of domains that resolved to\nthis IP address are as follows:\n\n\nRegistry Registrant ID:\nRegistrant Name:Wu YU\nRegistrant Organization:Game Develop investigation\nRegistrant Street:Chao Yang Road No.115\nRegistrant City:BeiJing\nRegistrant State/Province:Beijing\nRegistrant Postal Code:010\nRegistrant Country:China\nRegistrant Phone:67888955\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\nRegistrant Fax:67888955\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\nRegistrant Email:void_2k@qq.com\n\n\n_Table 1: List of Domains that Resolved to 58.84.54[.]146_\n\n##### Introducing WLNXSPLINTER\n\nIn investigating a newly identified group that BlackBerry researchers are tracking as\nWLNXSPLINTER, the “moegoo[.]com” domain seen in the discussion above of the C2\ninfrastructure that interacted with PWNLNX3 proved interesting. It was first registered\non May 3, 2009. It’s not clear whether the domain was under attacker control at this\ntime, as it was using private registration. Over the years though, several updates were\nrecorded with the first of investigative value occurring on February 18, 2014, using the\n[email address void_2k@qq.com:](mailto:void_2k@qq.com)\n\n\n_Figure 6: Domain Registration Information for moegoo[.]com_\n\n\n-----\n\nWLNXSPLINTER conveniently listed their organization as “Game Develop investigation”\nwhich yielded another email address that was used to register several additional\ndomains. While BlackBerry researchers have yet to link any of these other domains\nto malicious activity, it is suspected that they were likely used in other previously\nunidentified intrusions. If you’ve seen any of the following domains in your logs,\nBlackBerry researchers would like to hear from you:\n\n**Domain Name** **Registrant Email** **Registration Date**\n\nyoufunv[.]com void_2k@qq.com 9/27/2017\n\nheixbai[.]com void_2k@qq.com 9/14/2017\n\norzk[.]net void_2k@qq.com 4/22/2014\n\nmoegoo[.]com void_2k@qq.com 4/28/2014\n\no5team[.]com Wuyu@Tide.org 7/5/2015\n\nmoeskin[.]com Wuyu@Tide.org 2/4/2016\n\nis2sec[.[]com Wuyu@Tide.org 7/2/2018\n\nakibaol[.]com Wuyu@Tide.org 12/20/2015\n\n010sec[.]com Wuyu@Tide.org 7/22/2016\n\n_Table 2: Domains Containing “Game Develop investigation” within Their Registration Information_\n\nThe domain “cachecdn.moegoo[.]com” currently resolves to an IP in Google’s Cloud\nenvironment, “35.194.101.123”. The IP address was running RDP with an SSL certificate\ncontaining the issuer and common name, “chicken-01”, most likely a reference to\nChinese hacking slang, Ròujī (肉鸡) (Wikipedia, 2020), where “chicken” is commonly\nused to denote victims of attacks.\n\nBlackBerry researchers continue to investigate other connected activity and suspect\nWLNXSPLINTER’s activity was likely isolated primarily to within Asia given the similarity\nof many of the other domains to large Asian companies. BlackBerry researchers\ncontinue to monitor WLNXSPLINTER’s progress.\n\n\n##### Lancer – An Installation Script\n\nWhile attempting to locate subtle differences in code between PWNLNX1 and PWNLNX2,\nBlackBerry researchers examined the C2 protocol to assess whether any modifications\nwere made from the earlier implants. Upon closer inspection of the custom network\nprotocol, an additional modification was inserted into one of the implants BlackBerry\nresearchers associate with BRONZE UNION / APT27 (based upon C2) was observed.\n\nIn this particular sample, one of the first items that will be communicated by the implant\nto the C2 is an encoded version of the string, “LinuxOK”. Fortunately, it turned out that\nthis case-sensitive string was a lot less common than one would think.\n\nAfter some additional digging, BlackBerry researchers identified a set of Windows PEs\nnamed “lancer.exe”. These files turned out to be the Control Panel (discussed below)\nused to issue commands to this particular set of backdoors. The binaries utilized the\nexact same XOR key - “CB2FA36AAA9541F0” – for encoding network traffic as the key\nobserved in both families of implants.\n\nBuilding on these discoveries, BlackBerry researchers identified a compressed bash\nshell script inside of another shell script that was responsible for installing the rootkit\ncomponent of this particular variant on victim systems:\n\n\n“e60a3a93f3930dd13b5cb115d68e4989199e366212b9809f8fc87aaa54e8e683”.\n\n\nThe initial script would write itself into a new file beginning at line 44 using the\nfollowing command: “tail -n +44”. Then it would decompress the content using “gzip\n-cd” before executing the result. A similar script first appeared online in December of\n2014 (PrudentWoo, 2014), and that original code has been reused in a number of both\nmalicious and benign scripts.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe installer script was over 400 lines long, including comments, and referred to itself\ninternally as “Lancer Remote Online Compilation System v2.0”, which aligned with the\nnaming scheme used in the Windows-based controllers (lancer.exe):\n\n_Figure 7: The Installation Script Referred to Itself as “Lancer” Remote Online Compilation System_\n\nThe script was designed to run on both CentOS/RedHat systems and Debian/Ubuntu\nsystems. It came complete with a number of broken English phrases, misspellings, and\nword swaps like “being” and “begin.” The version number indicated that there was likely\nmore than one revision of this online build system. The script additionally confirmed\nearlier suspicions that at least one online build environment existed for compiling and\ndelivering the custom LKM rootkits (Group 1).\n\nThree additional command line arguments were required for it to execute properly: a\n“username”, a “build”, and a third variable referenced as “force_mode”, which would\nforce the build server to ignore an existing build for the current kernel and rebuild the\nLKM rootkit. The script communicated to one of two hosts depending on whether the\ninstalled kernel was 32-bit or 64-bit: “3232.3389[.]la” and “6464.3389[.]la” respectively.\n\nA combination of command line “curl” and “wget” commands were used to interact\nwith the remote build server. If not present, a message would be printed to the console\ncontaining the commands to install the packages via “yum” or “apt-get”. If current kernel\nheaders were not present on the system a similar message would be printed showing\nhow to install them. The inclusion of these messages indicated the attacker(s) using\nthe script were likely not the creator(s). The script would first authenticate to the remote\nserver with the supplied command line arguments similar to the pseudo request below:\n\n\nGET /build/auth?args=username|build\n\n\nThis would be followed by a check to see if an existing LKM was already compiled for\nthe current header version:\n\n\nGET /build/check?args=version|kernel|force_mode&token={result from auth request}\n\n\nIf found, it would download, decompress, and install the module via an included “install.\nsh” script. Otherwise, the kernel headers would be compressed to /tmp/header.tar.gz\nand uploaded via a curl POST request to “/build/accept” with a number of additional\narguments sent as form fields. Once uploaded successfully, another request would be\nmade to the build server to compile the rootkit:\n\n\nGET /build/compiler?args=version|kernel|version_text&token={result from auth request}\n\n\nOnce this process completed, the script would download the newly created LKM\npackage, decompress, then install the module via the included “install.sh” script. It\nturned out this package of Gzip-compressed tarball would also contain the backdoors\nwhich were unique depending on which user was specified from the command line.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### PWNLNX5 – The Controller\n\nThe controllers were all named “lancer.exe” and compiled on October 16, 2018. It\nappeared that the operator of the malware was working from a Cambodian IP address\nand likely testing to see if their version of the controller was detected by any industry\nvendors by uploading it to a common virus repository.\n\nThe threat actor similarly uploaded a tool a few days earlier that was called\n“OnLineTestBox.exe” that was compiled on October 12, 2018. This tool was used to\nsimulate traffic with a C2 and allowed the user to set a couple of predefined variables to\ntest. The tool would be useful to determine whether traffic throughput was adequate and\nif the receiving server was working appropriately. Here’s what the interface looked like:\n\n_Figure 8: C2 Network Throughput Testing Utility Interface_\n\n\nThe controller presented the operator with a nicely formatted Graphic User Interface\n(GUI) for controlling infected machines, and internally referred to itself as “Lancer Alpha\nbuild 2017”. The binary would look for the following files in the same directory where\nit was located and perform an MD5 check for each of the files listed below before\nstarting normally:\n\n**File Name** **MD5 Hash**\n\nGeoLite2-City.mmdb 7657FDB2099769206383FA59C43039F7\n\nnc.exe E0FB946C00B140693E3CF5DE258C22A1\n\nputtytel.exe 146608D3DFE9F87D37EC0A41AEC2686B\n\nUItheme.dat A68832233017F920B708316A007A99D9\n\nres.zip 08708C3B17322915F286F368BB509D8C\n\n_Table 3: File Checks Performed by Lancer.exe_\n\nBlackBerry researchers were unable to fully emulate the controller, but it should be\npossible to patch the hash checks and reverse the format of the expected files. The\ncode indicated that “res.zip” likely contained two additional files: “TaskMenu.xml” and\n“Main.xml”. After parsing these two files, several other files would be created and/or\nreferenced, including “\\\\data\\info.dat” and “\\\\data\\pathList.dat”.\n\nSeveral other XML configuration files were also utilized by the malware to preform\nvarious functions based upon commands issued by the operator, but they appeared\nto be created on-the-fly when issuing commands. Interestingly, a directory named\n“\\\\Log\\\\” would also be created within the same directory, presumably for logging\npurposes. The controller also contained a fair amount of content that would be outputted\nvia debug strings.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Another Linux Oddity — CASPER Mirai Variant\n\nBlackBerry researchers identified a single Linux Mirai variant that appeared to belong\nto the CASPER/LEAD group based upon the domain it communicated with: “cdn.\ngoogletoolservices[.]com”. It had the hash value:\n\n\nGET /%s HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: zh-cn\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0  (compatible;  MSIE  5.01;  Windows  NT  5.0)\nHost: %s:%d\nConnection: Close\n\n\n57cc422a6a90c571198a2d1c3db13c31fbdb48ba2f0f4356846d6d636d0f9300\n\n\nThe researchers identified other confirmed Windows samples, each signed with a unique\nstolen code-signing certificate, which were communicating to another subdomain “m.googletoolservices[.]com” — and concluded this file was connected to the group.\n\nThis backdoor curiously used the default XOR encoding method in the leaked Mirai\nsource code developed by Paras Jha and Josiah White (Krebs, 2017). The original\nmethod takes a seed value of “0xdeadbeef” and proceeds to sequentially XOR every\nbyte starting with the least significant and moving to the most significant. It was\nclear the original authors were not cryptography experts, as this method can be easily\nsimplified into a single XOR against the byte “0x22”. The values in this compiled binary\nwere matched to the parameters in the original source within the “table.c” file. Only the\ncommand-and-control domain had been modified within this table.\n\nCASPER added several new features through files named “botupdate.c”,\n“downloadexecute.c”, “myPublic.c”, “shadowsocks.c”, and “shell.c”. Much of the\nfunctionality conveniently matched the naming conventions. “BotUpdate” provided the\nability to download and execute a script via the following command: “/etc/init.d/atd\nstart && chmod +x bot_install.sh && echo “sh bot_ install.sh” |at now +1 minutes”. The\nfunctions “DownloadFile” and “DownloadExecute” provided the ability to download and\nexecute a file via a custom HTTP request with the following parameters:\n\n\nThe User-Agent was quite unique and contained multiple erroneous spaces. This file\nwould be saved to “test.sh”, modified to be executable, executed, and finally deleted. A\nhost enumeration function was also added that would write and execute a bash script\nfile “info.sh” to enumerate the operating system and other system information.\n\nThe new “ShellExec” function provided the operators with the ability to execute shell\ncommands. “ShadowSocksExec” and “ShadowSocksClose” provided the ability to install\nand uninstall ShadowSocks, a secure SOCKS5 proxy, via a script “ss.sh” (SDT, 2019).\nWhile it was unclear where this script would be derived from, it was most likely similar\nto the one available at the following URL: “http://blog.whsir.com/uploads/ss.sh”. The\nscript would install ShadowSocks and all required dependencies through a single click\non multiple operating systems.\n\nHaving now discovered and mapped out a previously undisclosed Linux toolset, as\nwell as the support environment used to build and run it, BlackBerry researchers turned\ntheir focused to another often-neglected attack vector: mobile devices. Their first find\nwas related to the Android operating system, which shouldn’t come as too much of\na surprise since 80% of the Android kernel is based on Linux. Yet what they ended up\ndiscovering nevertheless shattered all expectations.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Cellular Division\n\nIn a previous research cited in the beginning of report, Mobile Malware and APT\n_Espionage, BlackBerry researchers provided evidence that RATs designed for mobile_\ndevices, primarily those on the Android platform, have been developed and deployed\nby APT groups working in the interest of the Chinese government for far longer than\nhad been publicly acknowledged. Included among those groups was at least one that\nhad been previously associated with the WINNTI GROUP.\n\nUpon closer examination of the groups leveraging the Linux implants, BlackBerry\nresearchers found a number of indications within current and older C2 infrastructures\nthat mobile implants associated with both PASSCV and CASPER likely existed.\n\n##### PWNDROID4\n\nAn example of one such domain was “ios.0pengl[.]com”, which resolved to the IP\naddress “122.226.186[.]28” beginning on November 25, 2015. BlackBerry researchers\nidentified several other subdomains that were potentially of interest and went looking\nfor the associated malware.\n\nTheir findings didn’t bear out exactly as anticipated, however they did discover a\npreviously unattributed Android malware sample capable of monitoring incoming/\noutgoing phone calls, recording audio, sending and receiving SMS messages, and\nmonitoring a device’s GPS location. BlackBerry researchers designated this new Android\nbackdoor PWNDROID4.\n\nThe package the researchers identified was named “com.wavedancer.host” with the\nSHA256 hash:\n\n\nIt was likely created on June 16, 2015, based upon the last modification time of the APK\npackage contents. Very little effort was taken to obscure information or code within\nthe application, and it appeared to be a first-generation test by the attackers given the\ninternal name “GPS_TEST”.\n\nThe Android Manifest file is a great place to start when taking a look at any APK file; it is\nlocated within the root directory of the APK and will have the filename “AndroidManifest.\nxml”. The manifest granted the application a broad range of permissions:\n\n\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION android.permission.READ_\nPHONE_STATE\n\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE android.permission.READ_SMS\n\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE android.permission.RECEIVE_\nBOOT_COMPLETED\n\nandroid.permission.INTERNET android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\n\nandroid.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS android.permission.SEND_SMS\n\nandroid.permission.WAKE_LOCK android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG\n\nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS\n\nandroid.permission.PROCESS_\nOUTGOING_CALLS\n\nandroid.permission.WRITE_\nEXTERNAL_STORAGE\n\n\nac546bd38ad2e56b42fd3e35f27048ca9c86203153868944188e6fb6822d9f63\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this is a frightening list of permissions, this particular malicious APK would\nmost likely need to be sideloaded and/or downloaded by a slightly less intimidating\napplication. The “Receive Boot Completed” permission is the equivalent of letting the\napplication know when the device has been restarted, which almost always guarantees\nit contains some form of persistence upon reboot.\n\nThe manifest additionally contains a “minSdkVersion” and “targetSdkVersion” which\ngives some additional time-based context. They provide which versions of Android the\napplication was designed to run on (Android, 2020):\n\n\nThe backdoor would attempt to connect to “ns6.0pendns[.]org” on ports 53, 80,\nand 443. It may also potentially utilize one or more proxies: “10.20.30[.]40:1000”,\n“200.215.14[.]62:1080”, and “100.200.14[.]62:1080”. Both of the latter IP’s immediately\nshow up in open SOCKS v5 proxy lists, which probably makes them of little investigative\nuse. The first historic resolution BlackBerry researchers could find for the C2 domain\n“ns6.0pendns[.]org” was in March of 2019: “150.242.210[.]158”.\n\nThis IP was probably not all that relevant, as the implant was likely only active four\nyears prior. The domain “0pendns[.]org” was first registered using the email address\n“timew4lk@gmail.com” which connected to other PASSCV infrastructure as previously\nmentioned above.\n\n\n<uses-sdk\nandroid:minSdkVersion=”10”\nandroid:targetSdkVersion=”22” />\n\n\n_Figure 9: SDK Version Information from AndroidManifest.xml_\n\nThis marker indicated that the application was designed to run on Android versions\nGingerbread (2.3.3) to Lollipop (5.1). Android Lollipop 5.1 was first released in March of\n2015, which nicely aligned with the last modification date identified from the contents\nof the APK. The standard resources file “resources.arsc” was readily parsed and yielded\nimmediately useful information:\n\n<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”utf-8”?>\n<resources>\n<string name=”app_name”>GPS_TEST</string>\n<string name=”connections_list”>ns6.0pendns.org:53;ns6.0pendns.\norg:80;ns6.0pendns.org:443;</string>\n<string name=”hide_launcher_icon”>0001</string>\n<string name=”host_id” formatted=”false”>Host-%Rand%</string>\n<string name=”auth_password”>Password</string>\n<string name=”connection_delay”>15</string>\n<string name=”connection_type”>00000001</string>\n<string name=”proxy_list”>0:10.20.30.40:1000;0:200.215.14.62:1080;0:100.200.\n14.62:1080;0:10.20.30.40:1000;0:200.215.14.62:1080;0:100.200.14.62:1080;</string>\n</resources>\n\n_Figure 10: XML Strings Parsed from “resources.arsc”_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### An Interesting Find\n\nAfter digging into the decompiled code of PWNDROID4, BlackBerry researchers found\nstriking structural layout similarities and identical swathes of code that appeared to\nmatch the Android version of NetWire - a find worth digging into:\n\n_Figure 11: PassCV Code Layout_ _Figure 12: NetWire Code Layout_\n\n\nNetWire is a multi-platform, commercial, off-the-shelf remote administration tool\n(RAT) that can be licensed on a monthly or annual basis from a company called World\nWired Labs (https://www.worldwiredlabs.com). It is marketed for legal use by systems\nadministrators, incident responders and - curiously enough – parents who want to\nmonitor their kids’ mobile phone activity. World Wired Labs says that “NetWire can be\ncustomized to suit your daily needs, such as remote support, live forensics or even\nmonitoring your children at home” (World Wired Labs, 2020).\n\nBut security researchers will immediately recognize NetWire as one of the most\npervasive RATs in use by criminal enterprises and APT groups, but that’s not the fault\nof World Wired Labs: tools are tools and it is the intent of the user, the authorization of\nthe target, and the laws of the applicable jurisdictions that are the discriminating factors\nwhen determining whether a tool is being used for good or for nefarious purposes.\n\nThe abuse of publicly available hacking tools by adversaries has been pointed out by\nthe governments of the so-called Five Eyes nations (U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, New\nZealand) in a joint report released in 2018. The report cautioned: “Experience from\nall of our countries makes it clear that, while cyber actors continue to develop their\ncapabilities, they still make use of established tools and techniques. Even the most\nsophisticated groups use publicly available tools to achieve their objectives” (National\nCyber Security Centre, 2018).\n\nA close look at the World Wired Labs website does not yield the kind of contact\ninformation one might expect to see for a company interested in selling its offerings\nin the open market. While the site offers three ways to contact the company – via\nlive chat, emailing support@ or filling in an online form – there is only one person\nidentifiable at the company which appears at the end of each press release, but with no\ncontact information. There is no phone number listed for the business, and no address\nis provided aside from a Google Map snippet showing an imprecise office location\nsomewhere in Belize.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt first, BlackBerry researchers speculated that PASSCV was simply trying to adopt an\nexisting backdoor into their repertoire - as noted above, it is not uncommon to see APT\ngroups adopt publicly available hacking tools. Here’s where it got a little strange though:\nthe first public announcement by World Wired Labs about forthcoming support for the\nAndroid operating system was made on January 2, 2017, nearly eighteen months after\nPASSCV’s PWNDROID4 was created based on an archived screenshot of the “Android\nSupport” announcement on the NetWire Website (The Internet Archive, 2020).\n\nA second announcement was made on March 13, 2017, indicating that the Android\nrelease would be delayed. Finally, NetWire Version v1.7a was released on March 23,\n2017, marking the first public release of the Android host - nearly two years after the\neerily similar PASSCV malware was created. The remarkable overlap in structure and\ncoding combined with the timeline for the development of the tools certainly raises\nsome questions about their connection. BlackBerry researchers were unable to locate\nany similar code samples across their archives or anywhere in public and semipublic domains.\n\nBlackBerry researchers also could not locate an iOS[®] implant used by PASSCV, however\nthey strongly suspect that one or more may be out there, as a lot of the other early\nsubdomains this group used were overly descriptive and have turned out to be reflective\nof reality. Given the unsophisticated nature of the Android implant and the timeframe of\n2015, BlackBerry researchers suspect if any iOS implants exist, they likely would have\nonly executed on jailbroken devices or been delivered alongside of jailbreaking tools.\n\n\n##### CASPER Goes Mobile – PWNDROID5\n\nBlackBerry researchers identified several implants designated as PWNDROID5 which\nmasqueraded as fake Adobe Flash updates for Android in a newly identified campaign\ndesignated as OPERATION ANDROIDBEACON. Most were deployed in early to mid2016. Each made network requests to subdomains under associated CASPER/LEAD\nC2 infrastructure.\n\nOn first glance the APKs appeared completely benign. But malicious APKs were\nencrypted and stored within the “assets” folder using a random six-character string.\nThese inner APKs were encrypted using a standard DES cipher with an arbitrary key.\nFor example, in the case of this sample:\n\n\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import DES\ndef decrypt_apk(buf):\nkey = “F4o6VdRP”\ndes = DES.new(key)\nreturn des.decrypt(buf)\n\n\n64424a7c5f0d8e1c5d64c4c6fa9bdc2987dbdcf1bafdb6f45df9e783712c5187\n\n\nThe DES key was “F4o6VdRP”. The actual code to decrypt the APK was not written inside\nthis particular DEX file and was instead compiled into a standard Linux library named\n“libentry.so”. The library was compiled for ARM as well as x86 and stored within the\nrespectively named folders inside the standard “lib” folder. Below is a python function\nto decrypt these inner APKs. The key will always be 8-bytes in length and may need to\nbe modified based upon the contents of the external library, in this case “libentry.so”:\n\n\n_Figure 13: Python Function to Decode CASPER APK_\n\n\n-----\n\nMany of the APKs identified used some variation of this, and either had the decryption\ncode embedded within the actual APK or in an external library as in the above sample.\nThe decrypted APKs would make a POST request to one of the following base URLs:\n\n\nhttp://app.appleadwords[.]net/s1/\nhttp://app.appleadwords[.]net/s2/\n\n\nA number of additional parameters would be sent along with the base URL:\n\n**Variable Name** **Value**\n\npn Package Name\n\nvc Version Code of the Package\n\nmd Build Model\n\nov Version Release\n\nmc Mac Address\n\nlc Locale\n\nchn Set to ofw\n\ndid Device ID\n\nanid Android ID\n\nrefer Set to Empty by Default\n\nsys Either 1 or 0 depending if application is installed in device’s\nsystem image\n\n_Table 4: Parameters Sent in CASPER Network Check-In_\n\nBlackBerry researchers were unable to retrieve the follow-on payload(s) given the\namount of time that had elapsed before discovery. It appeared that these payloads\nwould likely be AES encrypted DEX or JAR files with the key “hello@#fe931AaBb” and\nuse an initialization vector “0102030405060708”.\n\n\nThe payloads could also potentially be wrapped in an extra layer of DES encryption\nwith the key “pessword”. BlackBerry did identify a writeup by Sophos on a sample that\nappeared to be related, one they termed “Andr/Axent-DS” (SophosLabs, 2017). Upon\nlooking into the IP address “114.108.185[.]113”, it was clear these were all likely part of\nthe same family. With the ones beaconing to “app.appleadwords[.]net” starting about\nsix months after the domain Sophos identified: “s1.deepcups[.]com”. The domains\n“psserviceonline[.]com” and associated subdomains as well as “app.aqmobi[.]com” and\n“bht.aqmobi[.]com” also appeared to be related to the same family of Android malware\nand used a similar request structure.\n\nBlackBerry researchers determined this family likely survived and now makes\nits home on\n\nAmazon AWS infrastructure using a variety of different domains:\n\nasense[.]in\nmobnativeads[.]com\nmobileflyx[.]com\nmydataprovider[.]in\nnapiservice[.]com\nnative123[.]com\nnativeload[.]com\nnatureapi[.]com\nnsdknative[.]com\nntracecloud[.]com\np2nservice[.]com\npdbarea[.]com\nsdatareport[.]com\n\nsubclicktrack[.]com\ntnapiservice[.]com\n\nIf a mobile device is in fact beaconing to one of these domains associated with\nOPERATION ANDROIDBEACON, you may want to take a closer look.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Windows Base Camp\n\nWindows has historically provided a free seaside beachfront vacation home for APT\ngroups associated with the WINNTI approach. That’s because their Windows RATs\nhave targeted both desktops and servers seamlessly in their operations for more\nthan a decade. But, as we have seen, some of these groups have also demonstrated\nexpertise in attacking Linux and other platforms. So how, then, might the same groups\ngo about managing an attack against both platforms simultaneously? As it turns out,\nit’s not that hard.\n\nWhile pivoting between Linux and Windows platforms may seem like a novel\nphenomenon, several of these groups were documented doing just that way back in\n2012 (Fraser, et al., 2019). More recently, one of the groups that that CrowdStrike tracks\nas WICKED SPIDER has been observed targeting MacOS as well (Bradley, 2018).\n\nIn order to make moving between platforms easier, several of these APT groups have\nemployed the cross-platform tunneling tool EarthWorm to proxy traffic between different\noperating systems (idlefire, 2016). EarthWorm was first released by “rootkiter” by a\nsecurity researcher at China’s Qihoo 360 Netlab in May of 2015 (Rootkiter, 2015).\n\nMany of the previously exposed WINNTI Windows implants have continued to evolve,\nand the APT groups behind them continue to deploy new malware alongside other wellknown families as well as other signed, open-source backdoors.\n\nOne common feature going back through the years shared by all the groups collectively\nreferred to as WINNTI has been the use of stolen code-signing certificates. Typically,\nthese code-signing certificates belonged to compromised video game developers. The\nstolen certificates were subsequently used to sign malware deployed in attacks on other\nhigher priority targets, such as SK Telecom in 2011 (Command Five Pty Ltd, 2011).\n\n\nHowever, BlackBerry researchers discovered what appears to be a novel and ongoing\ntrend: the threat actors have shifted from compromising video game companies to\ncompromising adware developers, and then utilizing their code-signing certificates in\noperations.\n\n##### Adware? Who Cares?\n\nAt first glance, using code-signing certificates belonging to adware developers seems\ncompletely counterproductive. Malware that may previously have gone undetected\nwould now almost surely be immediately noticed. At least a handful of antivirus vendors\nwould flag it, if only on the basis of the adware code-signing certificate. Why would an\nattacker, particularly one aligned with the interests of a nation state, want to do that?\nSee Figure 14:\n\n### Many of the previously exposed WINNTI Windows implants have continued to evolve, and the APT groups behind them continue to deploy new malware alongside other well- known families as well as other signed, open- source backdoors.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Example of Malware Signed with Adware Certificate and Detections_\n\nIn our judgement, these threat actors would rather be found and then ignored than found\nand investigated, particularly on the Windows platform where so much of the antivirus\nattention is focused. Malware masquerading as adware stands a good chance of being\noverlooked or disregarded if it is detected, especially in busy corporate enterprise\nenvironments because they manage a “stack” of multiple security technologies, each\nwith its own set of alerts.\n\nWhile this practice often provides greater visibility, it can also obscure what really\nmatters. The APT groups BlackBerry researchers investigated in this report seem to\nhave leveraged this. Many of CASPER’s samples are currently and have historically been\nflagged by numerous antivirus solutions as potentially unwanted applications (PUAs),\nwhich is an understatement to say the least.\n\n\nAnalysts, if presented with a piece of information, tend to use it. So, if an antivirus\nprogram alerts an analyst to adware on a system, they would tend to trust that\nclassification. How likely would you be to investigate further once that happened?\nBlackBerry researchers suspected the action for most would be to simply move\non. After all, a large majority of adware is signed using legitimate code-signing\ncertificates anyway.\n\nBoth network and host defenders are usually inundated with alerts on any given day,\nand filtering through them can be a monumental task unto itself. Determining which of\nthose adware alerts is actually the foothold for an APT intrusion and not just a run-ofthe-mill nuisance is an unreasonable expectation for the average organization.\n\nBlackBerry researchers believe these types of modifications will become increasingly\ncommon as time goes on. It’s likely that malware bearing stolen adware certificates\nwill need a new classification or designation within the information security community\nso it can be better understood.\n\nWhat the attackers have done in donning the façade of adware is to directly target the\npsychology and methodology of blue team members to exploit inherent weaknesses in\ntheir assumptions. Alert fatigue is real, and adware is boring. The authors of this paper\nhave increasingly seen these techniques employed by a number of other nation state\nactors to intentionally avoid analysis, or at the very least provide a layer of misdirection\nthat’s not easily detected. Readers will find a list of compromised adware and greyware\ncode-signing certificates and associated malicious binaries in the Appendix of\nthis report.\n\n\n-----\n\n**New(er) Droppers:**\nIn this section, we undertake a technical analysis of several of the newer, and thus,\nundocumented updates to the modified ZXShell variants commonly used by BRONZE\nUNION (aka APT27, EMISSARY PANDA).\n\nGeneral readers will note that all of these new droppers were predominantly signed with\nlegitimate certificates stolen from other companies based in Asia and adware vendors.\nThis may indicate either a tactical shift in targeting priorities or may simply be a case\nof harvesting the lowest-hanging fruit.\n\nExamination of several newer ZXShell droppers, ones which BlackBerry researchers\nassociate with BRONZE UNION, began by noting changes made following Dell’s report\nin February of 2019 (Dell Counter Threat Unit Research Team, 2019). After public\nresearch is released, threat actors often change their tactics. BlackBerry researchers\ntook a closer look to see what, if anything, had changed in response to the publication\nof that research.\n\nThe new droppers examined were signed with older stolen certificates, however the\nrootkits used a previously unseen code-signing certificate belonging to “Xiamen\nTongbu Networks”. Interestingly, several of the other groups discussed in this\nreport also continued to use other older stolen certificates and countersigned their\nexecutables so they would remain valid long past the certificates’ original expiration\ndate. Some examples:\n\n**Recent Droppers:**\n\n**• ce3424524fd1f482a0339a3f92e440532cff97c104769837fa6ae52869013558**\n\n**• caa46c001c3180eb7fdd5e5cbf7d084b75b7bdf72e61e06430a88378604a25eb**\n\n**• fbe294910ef833e1c9b2c8663c06b6ef99c13b2bc5eb01e87defb798c8066f0b**\n\n**• 8674c76583c13c60fcb6dc344bae4a5149cce35a85bb600f0a6af5e769b98585**\n\n\nBlackBerry researchers examined whether anything substantial had changed from\n2018 to 2019, starting with the SHA256 hash beginning “ce34” above (#1 in the list).\n\n**Dropper 1**\nThe sample was a 32-bit executable with a compile date of “January 1, 1970 03:25:45am\nUTC” – an indication to that a packer may have been used to obfuscate the malware and\nimpede detection. However, this was a somewhat unusual time and was not associated\nwith any particular programming languages or known packers as far as the researchers\nwere aware. The actual UNIX timestamp value equated to “12345”.\n\nAt first glance it appeared that the file was packed with UPX, based upon the section\nnames “.UPX0” and “.UPX1”. This was clearly untrue though, given the sheer number of\nadditional anti-debugging tricks it employed. In any case, these seemingly insignificant\ndetails when taken together were used to identify related files despite not getting to the\nbottom of the packer mystery.\n\nThe following YARA rule will find all related malware packed in this manner:\n\n\nimport “pe”\nrule BronzeUnionPacker\n{\n```\n  condition:\n\n```\npe.timestamp == 12345 and for any i in (0..pe.number_of_sections - 1):\n(pe.sections[i].name == “.UPX0”) and pe.number_of_signatures >= 1\n```\n}\n\n```\n\n_Figure 15: Generic Yara Detection for Bronze Union Packer_\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce unpacked, the dropper would create two files: a driver with the full path “\\\\\nWindows\\\\System32\\drivers\\ autochk.sys” and a DLL in one of the following locations:\n\n\nDriver: 28924b6329f5410a5cca30f3530a3fb8a97c23c9509a192f2092cbdf139a91d8\nDLL: a37574387a4bacfb69e7369d6ac8749603038a1b232d9a482bbcd2dce0c091b0\n\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\nAudioSdk.dll cryptdns.dll odbcwg32.cpl\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\naudiosrc.dll dhcpcsvcd.dll PINTLGNT.dll\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\nbitsprx.ime imekr61.dll prnfsdk.dll\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\nbootred.dll imseo21.ime samlib32.dll\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\nSystem32\\\\C_1950.NLS iscsiapi.dll shlwapi.dll\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\nSystem32\\\\c_21268.nls KBDDWSKY.DLL shlyapi.dll\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\nSystem32\\\\C_26849.NLS keyzip.dll shlzapi.dll\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\nchrsben.dll mfc100usx.dll sqlnclc11.dll\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\nchrsben.ime mfc120du.dll stdole32.dll\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\ncliconfg.cpl midiapi.dll wbem\\\\loadperf.dll\n\n\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ \\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\ncryptbios.dll odbccx32.dll wlanseo.dll\n\n\nThe driver prevented deletion of the backdoor while it was loaded and redirected any filebased requests made of the backdoor to the legitimate “shlwapi.dll”. It would similarly\nredirect file requests made of the driver “autochk.sys” to the legitimate “fltMgr.sys”.\nWhen the researchers arrived at this discovery, they realized that Ori Damari had already\nproduced an excellent writeup containing this same revelation. His detailed report was\nproduced in November of 2019 (Damari, 2019).\n\nThat said, the rootkit for the particular sample BlackBerry researchers examined lacked\nany of the network-hiding features Damari wrote about. Instead, it curiously contained\ntwo different code-signing signatures: one belonging to “Shanghai Hintsoft Co., Ltd.”\nusing a SHA1 digest, and the other belonging to “Hangzhou Bianfeng Networking\ntechnology Co., Ltd.” using a SHA256 digest. Details of both certificates are listed in\nthe appendix of this report. The DLL was similarly signed with the “Hangzhou Bianfeng”\ncertificate “June 6, 2018 4:49:06 UTC”, which provided a better approximate idea of\nwhen the dropper was actually created because the compile time of the DLL was “April\n10, 2018 19:42:09 UTC”.\n\nThe DLL exported a number of unique functions that could be readily used to identify\nsimilar backdoors. The dropper would configure the DLL to run as a ServiceDLL on boot\nbeneath a new randomly named service beginning with the string “netsvc_” and ending\nwith eight random lowercase hex characters. Analysis of the DLL was hindered slightly\nby the custom packer but dumping from memory worked like a charm. The DLL was\na modified variant of ZXShell and quite large. The backdoor contained a plethora of\nfunctionality and could accept the following commands:\n\n\n_Table 5: Potential FilePaths for the ZXShell Backdoor_\n\n\n-----\n\nHelp Displayed Help Information\n\nExit/Quit\n\nSysinfo Provided System Information including OS, disk information, CPU,\nRAM, user information, and system uptime\n\nRunAs Executed a process as another user\n\nGetCMD Provided an interactive Command Shell\n\nSockProxy Started a Socks4 or Socks5 Proxy via internal program\n“SockProxy V1.2”\n\nPortScan Port Scanning Functionality\n\nShareShell Shared a shell to others via netcat-like function\n\nSuspendFW Suspend the Windows Firewall\n\nPs Provided process and service management\n\nFileTime Cloned a file’s timestamp information\n\nfileMG Provide an interactive file manager\n\nwinvnc Remote Desktop (did not appear to be used)\n\nrPortMap Remap a port on the local host\n\nRemarks A commenting system\n\nlogonPasswords Dump cleartext stored passwords\n\nHtran Full Htran functionality\n\n\nThe group used a modified cipher for sensitive parameters, such as network callback\ninformation that utilized a combination of base64 and a custom XOR implementation.\nThe cipher stored the size of the string in the last value and used it as a seed value to\ngenerate a custom position dependent XOR key.\n\n**Dropper 1 Network Callback Details**\nThe backdoor would attempt to beacon to the domain “tdjsyqty0takah2x.gitoos[.]\ncom” on ports 53, 80, and 443. The domain currently resolves to the IP address\n“35.186.159[.]221” which belongs to Google’s cloud service “Google Compute Engine[™].”\nBlackBerry researchers identified several other domains ascribed to BRONZE UNION\nthat currently resolved to IP addresses within Google’s cloud service. All of the IP\naddresses were running the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Service on TCP port 3389\nand appeared to be various Windows virtual machines:\n```\n  Initial Handshake:\n\n```\n00000000 04 c8 07 d8 30 b9 03 98 da ac 7b 10 13 20 03 10 ....0... ..{.. ..\n00000010 fc 0b 53 0f ..S.\n00000000 12 b0 11 30 83 98 19 10 57 55 1d 50 82 99 39 10 ...0....

The server’s traffic is in blue while the victim’s traffic is in red. The protocol was\nmodified from the original source, so the researchers did not spend too much additional\ntime on it. Identification of servers on the internet that send data first on port 80, 443,\nor 53 should be a dead giveaway that something is not quite right. The initial exchange\nalways used TCP packets that were 0x14 bytes in length as opposed to 0x10 bytes as\nin the original protocol.\n\n**Dropper 2:**\nThe hash beginning “caa” (#2 in the list above) was a much newer dropper signed on\nJuly 26, 2019, using the “Hangzhou Bianfeng” certificate previously mentioned, and it\nwas packed with the custom packer described above. It utilized the exact same file\nlocations for the driver and DLL, although both dropped files bore different hashes:\n\n\nDriver: 9b7c1e37d5f56cc0b5e5e22ce9805e237a189297e78405b9c392a0953b6e0321\nDLL: 101171cc6ffda3428089e77ce2a90f0d2f490fa68970c09f777c5ec0b0707cf6\n\n\nBlackBerry researchers took a closer look to see what if anything had changed from\n2018 and found that driver was signed with a new stolen code-signing certificate\nbelonging to “Xiamen Tongbu Networks Ltd.”, which was founded by the former head\nof Google China, Li Kai Fu.\n\nBlackBerry researchers identified another rootkit signed with the same driver, which is\nalso listed in the Appendix. The file’s compile time appeared to be accurate, as it was\n“May 4, 2019 21:34:08 UTC”, just before the DLL was compiled. The driver’s code had\nbeen updated and the list of filenames was now stored with the characters reversed,\nbut otherwise the paths remained the same. It contained new code which provided the\nability to hide network connections made by the backdoor from tools like netstat, as\nexplained in the Damari research (Damari, 2019).\n\nThe first noticeable difference between the two DLLs was that the compile date of the\nsecond DLL seemed to be accurate: “May 4, 2019 21:36:36 UTC”. The file contained\nUPX section names “.UPX0” and “.UPX1” and was still protected with the same custom\n\n\npacker. The researchers dumped and rebuilt the DLL from memory to speed up analysis.\nThe DLL was more or less unchanged from a command and functionality perspective,\nand it used the same custom cipher to obfuscate sensitive strings and a similar modified\nnetwork protocol with 0x14 byte handshake.\n\n**Dropper 2 Network Callback Information**\nThe ZXShell variant dropped by the second sample beaconed to a different domain:\n“yofeopxuuehixwmj.redhatupdater[.]com” on TCP ports 53, 80, and 443. The first\nrecorded IP resolution the researchers could find was in September of 2019, nearly\nfour months after the backdoor was built.\n\nThe IP addresses the domain resolved to did not appear to coincide with any\nsimilar samples. They belonged to VeeSP (https://www.veesp[.]com/en), Fishnet\nCommunications, and Profit Server (https://profitserver[.]ru/en). This may represent\na tactical shift for newer domains or indicated a disparate or separate attack group\nmay have been responsible. One IP range was of particular interest, “77.73.64[.]0/21”,\nas other attack groups including CHAFER (Symantec Threat Intelligence, 2018) had\nutilized IP addresses within it.\n\n### As the intellectual property and other targeted data has moved to new operating environments, these groups have readily adapted, shared new tools, borrowed from open-source resources, and developed new methods to harvest information - all while effectively hiding more or less in plain sight.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Bigger Picture - Network Infrastructure**\nThe use of cloud environments represented a change in TTP’s for the PASSCV, CASPER,\nand BRONZE UNION groups. Cloud servers provide an ideal C2 environment for malware\noperators because they can easily be moved, easily be deployed, and easily be managed\nin contrast to more traditional virtual private servers (VPS’s) or dedicated servers.\n\nBlackBerry researchers discovered that the majority of servers used by these groups\nfor C2 currently reside within Google’s cloud service. Some details about the current\nas well as historical activity by both BRONZE UNION and PASSCV are provided below:\n\nGoogle Cloud[™] Linux C2 IP Addresses:\n\n35.185.156[.]217\n104.199.158[.]58 - Rootkit Build Server\n35.185.188[.]253\n35.186.158[.]135\n35.186.159[.]111\n35.194.101[.]123\n35.201.147[.]249\n35.234.57[.]84\n35.236.143[.]199\n35.236.181[.]31\n\n\nGoogle Cloud Windows C2 IP Addresses:\n\n35.185.185[.]214\n104.199.173[.]2\n34.80.77[.]57\n35.186.159[.]221\n35.187.155[.]1\n35.187.194[.]33\n35.194.170[.]0\n35.187.215[.]226\n35.187.217[.]64\n\nUnknown Google Cloud C2 IP Addresses\n\n35.185.189[.]30\n104.199.235[.]60\n\nCuriously, it appeared that one of the operators may have made an error, or conversely,\nused the same virtual machine on two different IP addresses. BlackBerry researchers\nwere able to locate an SSL certificate with a common name of “windows-15” and a serial\nnumber of “35059196158688747431532446108251074437” that was used on both\n“35.187.155[.]222” (Google Cloud) and “58.84.54[.]147”, an IP address in Hong Kong.\nSeveral other C2 servers were also located within the 58.84.54[.]0/24 net block. The\ngroups additionally deployed Tencent Cloud and Alibaba Cloud servers to a lesser extent.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\nWINNTI began as a backdoor (Symantec, 2011), then it was designated as a group\n(Kaspersky Lab Global Research and Analysis Team, 2013), and later it was identified\nas an “Umbrella” (Hegel, 2018). Today, it’s become something of a threat intelligence\nanalyst’s nightmare.\n\nWe should have expected this to happen because every security group has different\ndata sets and analysts of varying abilities at their disposal, all of which results in a\nvastly different view of the proverbial “elephant in the room.” But it hasn’t stopped\nthese analysts from trying to make connections to others’ research, however tenuous.\nAs a result, in some readings of APT security research focused on groups acting in\nthe interest of China, WINNTI seems to be everywhere with seemingly every group\ninvestigated somehow connected to it. This is unhelpful.\n\nIt’s worth noting that while early WINNTI-related malware and infrastructure may still\nbe around, the people behind it have almost certainly come and gone. To think that the\noriginal WINNTI GROUP, as defined by Kaspersky in 2013, is somehow still together all\nthese years later is wishful thinking. So, when readers encounter WINNTI in the press or\nin research, how should they understand it? What does the designation signify today?\n\n#### The WINNTI Approach\n\nThe researchers’ considered opinion here is that WINNTI has come to represent more of\nan approach rather than a moniker for any single crew. It refers to a method of attacks\nwherein cells of civilian contractors are assembled, attack tools and intelligence are\nshared, and the targets are assigned.\n\nThe tools and infrastructure favored by each cell, or APT group, differs - but sharing\nbetween the groups regularly occurs. This suggests that either the APT contractor\ncommunity in China regards sharing favorably and tolerates it openly, or that members\ntravel between cells over time or groups of them break off from individual cells to form\n\n\nnew ones, or both. It is also possible that the Chinese government, which is assessed\nto be their likely customer, provides something in the way of support by providing tools\nand intelligence in some formal fashion, but this is the least likely scenario.\n\nThe use of stolen code-signing certificates - typically from video game companies, but as\nwe have discussed in this report, now too from adware companies - is another common\nbond. Kaspersky researchers did well to point out the common criminal ancestry of\nthe original WINNTI GROUP. This criminal legacy to operations has continued to color\nthose of the original group’s descendants all these years later, particularly in their wide\nand voluminous targeting. It looks like “spray and pray,” but it’s more likely done with\nmore strategic intent.\n\nThe majority of the groups discussed in this report - PASSCV, WINNTI GROUP, CASPER\n(LEAD), and BRONZE UNION - have been discussed in other public security research.\nWhether these groups were actively collaborating, casually sharing, comprised of\nsome of the same members, or in actuality were smaller parts of some larger group is\nbeyond analysis at this point. Occasionally, though, cracks appear that provide some\ngreater insights.\n\nThe longevity of the WINNTI approach and its non-government attacker-culture ancestry\nhas meant that mistakes in these groups’ operational security have frequently come\nto light. Researchers at TrendMicro, BlueCoat (now Symantec, whom we credit with\nfinding and naming of PASSCV), Dell SecureWorks, ESET, and Kaspersky have all spilled\nink about chasing the odd bits of personal information that have fallen through those\ncracks. Let’s look at one of the more interesting ones:\n\nIn 2013, Kaspersky researchers identified one of the original suspected WINNTI\nGROUP members by his screenname “Mer4en7y” as the result of an apparent lapse in\noperational security (Kaspersky Lab Global Research and Analysis Team, 2013).\n\n\n-----\n\nIn tracing the attacker’s online footprint circa 2012, they found that they were a member\nof a hacking forum, had submitted a vulnerability in a commercial bank system,\nmaintained a microblogging page, and was part of an information security forum called\n“90 Security Team.” As Kaspersky pointed out, they were based in Nanjing and once\nposted a reply to an ad looking for “powerful pentesters” in another city, writing “aren’t\nyou recruiting people for APT? Guangzhou is too far, but anyway I support it.”\n\nAs fate would have it, Mer4en7y’s moniker appeared again in print in another writeup\non WINNTI malware. This time, though, it was a U.S. Department of Justice indictment.\nProsecutors charged Mer4en7y for hacking Capstone Turbine in what they said was an\nMSS conspiracy to engage in computer network exploitation operations in furtherance\nof corporate espionage (United States of America v. Zhang et al, 2017).\n\nResearchers don’t typically have the resources of a government, nor the inclination to\nassess whether the Mer4en7y connection is what it seems, but it’s worth pointing out if\nonly to highlight what prosecutors alleged was the way in which the attackers organized.\nThey said an intelligence official from the provincial branch of the Ministry of State\nSecurity (MSS) had recruited a bunch of civilian hackers like Mer4en7y – mercenaries,\nif you will – to carry out the mission.\n\nIf you believe what the authors behind a number of “Intrusion Truth” (https://\nintrusiontruth.wordpress.com/) posts have written about APT groups acting in the\ninterests of the Chinese government, this all fits a very distinct pattern, one where\nmissions and directives change over time yet have a common theme with a regional\nintelligence officer directing a local network of contractors to achieve a longer-term\nstrategic goal with significant flexibility in who is employed and how the objectives are\ncarried out.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt should come as no surprise that a number of the groups affiliated with the WINNTI\napproach have continued to effectively compromise their targets over the past decade.\nThe groups have rapidly adapted to changes in defenders’ tactics and continually\nevolved their toolsets and techniques as the target landscape has changed.\n\nAs the intellectual property and other targeted data has moved to new operating\nenvironments, these groups have readily adapted, shared new tools, borrowed from\nopen-source resources, and developed new methods to harvest information - all while\neffectively hiding more or less in plain sight. In addition, many of the attack techniques\nthat worked a decade ago continue to be effective today. The cycle regularly comes full\ncircle, where old techniques and tricks are revived time and time again.\n\nWhile much of the security industry continues to charge forward with efforts to address\nthe next trendy buzzword threat, few are looking back in time to assure they have\neffectively solved for the issues presented by the last. Thus, some subtle changes in\ntactic and a new stolen code-signing certificate appear to be the only things necessary\nfor these adversaries to continue evading security solutions.\n\nIn this report, BlackBerry researchers examined the activities of five adversarial\ngroups that share specific characteristics in how they are organized, operate, and in\ntheir targeting selections – a methodology that can be best described as the WINNTI\napproach. This ensemble, who have spent the better part of the last decade successfully\ntargeting organizations in stealthy cross-platform attacks, continue to operate relatively\nundetected while undertaking multiple strategic and economic espionage operations.\n\n**The Linux Threat: This report detailed how this quintet of threat actor groups have**\nmanaged to successfully infiltrate and maintain persistence on servers that comprise\nthe backbone of the majority of large data centers using a newly identified Linux\nmalware toolset obfuscated by a kernel-level module rootkit, all of which allows them\nto remain nearly undetectable on the infected systems. The fact that this new Linux\nmalware toolset has been in the wild for the better part of the last decade without\n\n\nhaving been detected and publicly documented prior to this report makes it highly\nprobable that the number of impacted organizations is significant and the duration of\nthe infections lengthy.\n\n**The Windows Threat: This report also provided analysis of the use of Windows malware**\nthat attempts to elude defenders through the use of stolen adware code-signing\ncertificates, hiding the malware in plain sight with the hopes it will be dismissed as\njust another blip in a nearly constant stream of adware alerts. This report contained\nmultiple samples of the malware and the compromised code-signing certificates\nand recommends a new designation for malware disguised as adware that will allow\ndefenders to better differentiate the bad from the benign and implement controls to\nincrease detection of malware employing this tactic.\n\n**The Mobile Device Threat:** This research also examined the targeting Android\nmobile devices by these WINNTI-related groups. A previous report from BlackBerry\nresearchers, titled Mobile Malware and APT Espionage: Prolific, Pervasive, and Cross_Platform (BlackBerry, 2019), looked at APT groups increasing use of mobile malware_\nin combination with traditional desktop malware. This report continued analysis of this\ntactical trend in looking at some newly discovered Android malware.\n\n#### Legal Disclaimer\n\nThe information contained in this report is intended for educational purposes\nonly.
