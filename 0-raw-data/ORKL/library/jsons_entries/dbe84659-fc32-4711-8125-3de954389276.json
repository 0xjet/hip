Like Maze, Egregor makes use of a “double extortion” technique where the\nransomware operators threaten the victim not only with the loss of their data, but with a\nwarning that their data will go public if they fail to pay the ransom.\n\n## What is Egregor?\n\nA sophisticated piece of ransomware that first surfaced around September 2020, Egregor\nhas since been involved in a number of high-profile attacks in a short period, including\nattacks that were launched against major retailers and other organizations.\n\n[This ransomware is often distributed as a payload along with remote access trojans (RATs)](https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2020/cc-3681)\nsuch as QAKBOT. In turn, QAKBOT has been previously observed to be connected with the\nMegaCortex and ProLock ransomware families, which indicates either a possible partnership\nbetween QAKBOT and Egregor or a new payload from the QAKBOT threat actors.\n\nSimilar to the double extortion technique used by the new breed of ransomware families\nsuch as Ryuk, Egregor pressures the victim to pay by threatening to release stolen\ninformation. In addition to encrypting data, operators behind Egregor also make threats\nabout informing mass media — and hence, the public — that the company has been\ncompromised.\n\n\n-----\n\n[On the surface, Egregor seems like a copy of the Sekhmet ransomware, as it shares most of](https://www.zdnet.com/article/as-maze-ransomware-group-retires-clients-turn-to-sekhmet-ransomware-spin-off-egregor/)\nits codes and routines, most notable of which are its obfuscation techniques, functions, as\nwell as API calls and strings. Furthermore, like Sekhmet, it also appends a random extension\nper file. However, it is possible that Egregor and Sekhmet are operated by entirely different\ngroups given the differences between the data leak sites that are used by the two.\n\nAlthough there is no concrete information on how exactly Egregor gains initial access, it is\nlikely that it uses techniques that are similar with other targeted ransomware such as RDP\nhacks, compromised websites, or stolen accounts.\n\n[One of Egregor’s defining characteristics is its use of advanced obfuscation techniques,](https://www.recordedfuture.com/egregor-ransomware-attacks/)\nwherein it requires a specific argument to decrypt the payload, thereby making it difficult to\nperform static or dynamic analysis on the ransomware variant without this argument.\n\nAccording to the Egregor ransom note, victims that manage to pay the ransom will not only\nhave their data decrypted. In fact, the threat actors also offer to provide recommendations for\nsecuring the company's network.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Egregor\n\nransom note\nA simplified version of its attack chain can be found in the following figure:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Egregor attack chain\nFrom our [Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network ™ data, Egregor has been active](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/about/threat-research.html)\nprimarily in the US, with Japan and the UK also seeing a number of infections.\n\n## What are the recent incidents involving Egregor?\n\nA number of Egregor’s attacks have occurred against high profile targets, including a leading\nbookstore in October and a major retailer in December. In the former, the ransomware\n[operators behind Egregor claimed to have gathered unencrypted financial and auditing data,](https://threatpost.com/egregor-responsibility-barnes-noble/160401/)\nalthough the precise nature of the data that was stolen is unclear.\n\n[Egregor has also been observed printing ransom notes. Based on our analysis, printing](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/egregor-ransomware-strikes-metro-vancouvers-translink/)\nransom notes was not intentional on the operators’ end. Rather, it occurred as part of the\nransomware’s encryption routine, which enumerates any type of network resources —ؙ\nincluding printer resources. It then connects to the network resource to encrypt files and drop\nthe ransom note. It’s also possible that the printers and point-of-sale (POS) machines were\nconnected to the infected machines, which resulted in the ransom notes being physically\nprinted.\n\nOther recent victims of Egregor include major organizations in both the gaming and human\nresources industries.\n\nHow can the impact of Egregor and other ransomware be minimized?\nAlthough there is still no concrete evidence on how Egregor gains initial access to the\nsystem, other ransomware variants such as Maze are known to exploit vulnerabilities as part\nof their routine. Therefore, it is important for organizations to patch and update their systems’\nsoftware to address any exploitable vulnerabilities. Additionally, businesses are encouraged\nto keep their machines and their systems updated to prevent this from happening.\n\nBusinesses should also perform regular security audits of their systems to ensure that they\nare as secure as possible. Company data should also be periodically backed up whenever\n[possible, preferably by adhering to the 3-2-1 rule, which involves keeping three copies in two](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/13/d/world-backup-day-the-3-2-1-rule.html)\ndifferent formats with at least one copy off-site\n\n\n-----\n\nMeanwhile, employees should be given proper training on the best practices for\ncybersecurity, especially when it comes to the common initial access techniques used by\n[ransomware, such as email-based attacks and compromised websites.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/infosec-guide-email-threats)\n\nFor a more robust and proactive line of defense against ransomware, we recommend the\nfollowing Trend Micro solutions:\n\n[Trend Micro Smart Protection Suites applies AI and analytics for earlier detection of](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps.html)\nthreats across endpoints and other layers of the system.\n[Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Inspector detects, blocks, and analyzes malicious](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network/advanced-threat-protection/inspector.html)\nemail attachments through custom sandboxing and other detection techniques.\n\n\n-----",
