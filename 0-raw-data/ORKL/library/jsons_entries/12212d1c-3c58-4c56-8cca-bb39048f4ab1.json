The email contained a link to a\nGoogle drive ZIP file.\n\nThe contents of FYI.zip downloaded from the Google Drive link\n\nThe ZIP archive contained three files – an August 2019 policy brief downloaded from\nFreedom House regarding the Democratic Crisis in Hong Kong, a September 2019 Hong\nKong report downloaded from Human Rights First, and a supposed RTF file from the Nikkei\nAsian Review.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe third file masquerading as a Nikkei Asian Review document is actually a LNK shortcut\nfile which had a double extension. When LNK files are viewed through archiving software,\nthe double extension “.rtf.lnk” will be shown correctly. If the file was extracted and viewed\nthrough the Windows Explorer, however, the operating system always hides the LNK\nextension by default.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis of the LNK file shows running it will execute msiexec.exe to download and run a\nremote MSI file\n\nThe LNK file is actually a shortcut to the Windows utility msiexec.exe, which can be used as\na LOLBin to remotely download and run MSI files which have the PNG extension. In this\ncase, the MSI file is remotely downloaded from a GitHub repository and account which was\ncreated on October 10.\n\nA snapshot of the GitHub repository on October 29\n\n## siHost64\n\nThe MSI file, “siHost64.png”, was created using a registered or cracked EXEMSI program.\nRunning it will drop and run “siHost64.exe” in the %APPDATA% folder. This executable is a\nPyInstaller executable which has over a thousand files inside it, but the main important file is\nthe compiled python script “siHost64”.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnpacking the PyInstaller executable shows the real files, some of which cannot be seen\nwhen performing dynamic analysis\n\nBy restoring the first eight missing bytes of “siHost64” which is typically required for such\nPyInstaller files, we are then able to decompile the compiled python script and analyze the\nfunctionality of this malware:\n\nUse the Python requests library to call the DropBox API which connects to DropBox\nand uses it as a HTTPS C2 server\nUse the system proxy for communications if any\nAdd itself to the registry AutoRun location\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the registry name\n“siHost64”. On October 31, the new version of the malware changed the registry name\nused to “Dropbox Update Setup”.\nPerform AES encryption with CBC mode on uploaded files with the key\n“ApmcJue1570368JnxBdGetr*^#ajLsOw” and a random salt\nCheck in to the C2 server by creating an encrypted file containing the operating system\nversion and architecture, date, computer name, and logged in user\n\n\n-----\n\nCheck for files from the C2 server which contain encrypted arbitrary commands to be\nrun, execute that command, and create a new encrypted file containing the results of\nthe executed command.\n\nExample of the malware using the Dropbox API to check in\n\nBased on the check in information from infected machines, it appears that there is a single\ninfected Hong Kong victim of interest to this threat actor connecting to the Dropbox app\nbesides the target we described at the start. The files exfiltrated from this victim appeared to\nbe personal documents related to the victim traveling to the United States, business forms,\nand Christian hymns.\n\nBesides those exfiltrated documents, the C2 server also appeared to host their next stage\nmalware such as two files named “GetCurrentRollback.exe” and “GetCurrentDeploy.dll”.\n“GetCurrentRollback.exe” is a signed Microsoft executable which seems to be for upgrading\nthe previous Windows operating system version to Windows 10, and “GetCurrentDeploy.dll”\nlikely being the name of the DLL which is side loaded. The first version of\n“GetCurrentRollback.exe” we could find was since 2016 and the latest in 2019 November,\nwhich means all version might be exploitable by DLL Sideloading at first glance.\n\n\n-----\n\nA version of GetCurrentRollback.exe signed on November 13, 2019 is still vulnerable to DLL\nSideloading\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the victim profile and the exfiltrated files, it appears one of the intelligence\nrequirements of the threat actor is to monitor people with relations to the Hong Kong\nprotests, targeting either them or the people around them. There are multiple possibilities for\nthis requirements, with the most likely being to understand the inner thoughts of prodemocracy movement, or to support or undermine the movement behind the scenes.\n\nUsing Dropbox and other legitimate services such as Google Drive and GitHub\n\nthroughout the attack life cycle is not a new concept for threat actors, allowing them to easily\nbypass network detection. To counter this threat, enterprises or teams within enterprises\nnowadays block or detect such Shadow IT services if they are not in official use, but\nindividual or non-enterprise users which may be targeted by state sponsored threat actors\nrarely have this luxury.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nThe full report detailing each event together with IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) and\nrecommendations is available to existing NSHC ThreatRecon customers.
