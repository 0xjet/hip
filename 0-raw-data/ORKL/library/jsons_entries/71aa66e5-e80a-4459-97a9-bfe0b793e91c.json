Transparent Tribe has\nalso been known to target entities in Afghanistan and social activists in Pakistan, the latter of\nwhich points towards the assumed attribution of Pakistani intelligence.\n\nThis is the second blog of a two-part series on Transparent Tribe’s CrimsonRAT\ninfrastructure. You may read the first article here:\n\n[Part 1: A High-Level Study of CrimsonRAT Infrastructure October 2020 – March 2021](https://team-cymru.com/blog/2021/04/16/transparent-tribe-apt-infrastructure-mapping/)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have been tracking CrimsonRAT, Transparent Tribe s most ubiquitous remote access\ntool, over several months. This blog will present a deeper dive into the methods we use to\nidentify CrimsonRAT infrastructure and observations on specific artefacts which have allowed\nus to attribute this infrastructure dating back multiple years.\n\nOur intention is to provide supporting context to existing Transparent Tribe reporting and\nIOCs, to aide in future threat reconnaissance activities against this group.\n\n**Key Observations**\n\nCrimsonRAT infrastructure is largely hosted on infrastructure leased by Pi NET LLC, a\nVietnamese VPS reseller.\nAn RDP certificate serves as a key indicator for CrimsonRAT and has been observed\non 17 C2 servers in total.\nA methodology for tracing CrimsonRAT C2 servers was devised based on network\ntraffic patterns and the scanning of beacon ports.\nCrimsonRAT C2 servers provide a standardized response when an initial TCP\nconnection is established.\nPotential crossover login activity has been observed, linking multiple C2 servers\ntogether, as well as providing a link to AhMyth AndroidRAT.\n\n**Eggs in One Basket (Pi NET LLC)**\n\nWhen reviewing CrimsonRAT C2 infrastructure an RDP certificate (with a Common Name\nvalue of WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8) continued to appear. Our certificate data showed this\nCommon Name appearing across many of the previously identified ‘preferred’ providers (see\nPart 1) used by Transparent Tribe. After reviewing rWhois records for IP addresses hosting\nthis certificate it became apparent that many, if not all these hosts, were being subleased to\n**Pi NET LLC.**\n\n_A list of all 17 CrimsonRAT C2 servers hosting the Common Name WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8_\n_certificate is provided at the end of this blog._\n\nExpanding this search using Shodan’s data holdings, we were able to bolster our theory (the\nassociation of the certificate with Pi NET LLC) as only a relatively small number of hosts\n(240) were identified, the majority of which were either assigned directly to, or subleased to\n**Pi NET LLC.**\n\n_Unfortunately, not all providers document the details of subleasing in Whois records, so we_\n_were not able to tie ALL the IP addresses identified to a single entity (Pi NET)._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1:**\n\n**Shodan 240 hosts found with Common Name WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8**\nMore recently we have also observed a different certificate in use on Pi NET LLC hosts, with\na Common Name of WIN-L6BUPB5SQBC. This certificate is associated with CrimsonRAT\nC2s 134.119.181.15, 181.215.47.169 and 134.119.181.142 and moving forward could be an\nalternative indicator of Transparent Tribe activity.\n\nReviewing Whois information for all CrimsonRAT C2 servers we have identified to date, we\nfound that roughly three-quarters (75%) were associated in some way with Pi NET LLC.\n\nTherefore, we assess with moderate confidence that Transparent Tribe is hosting a large\nproportion of (known) CrimsonRAT infrastructure through this single VPS provider, i.e., whilst\nCrimsonRAT servers are overtly hosted with several different providers, it is likely that this\ninfrastructure is managed and sold by the small reseller Pi NET LLC.\n\n**Pi NET LLC (pivps[.]com) is a VPS reseller based out of northern Vietnam, which provides**\nvery affordable Windows and Linux hosts accepting payment in various cryptocurrencies\nalongside conventional methods.\n\n_Team Cymru attempted to contact the reseller about this activity but received a canned_\n_response on how to submit an abuse complaint. Using the provided instructions we filed an_\n_abuse complaint on 17 CrimsonRAT C2s._\n\n**[Pi NET LLC’s known IP ranges are shared via our public GitHub](https://github.com/team-cymru/iocs/blob/master/pinet/Pi%20NET%20LLC%20Ranges)**\n\n**Sweep & Scan**\n\nIn Part 1 of this research, we discussed how CrimsonRAT C2 servers communicated with ip**api[.]com when new victims beaconed in, providing us with an indicator to look for in our**\nnetwork traffic data when reviewing activity surrounding potential C2 servers. The presence\nof connections to ip-api[.]com therefore providing increased confidence that a particular IP\naddress was associated with CrimsonRAT activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe combination of knowing that a large proportion of C2 servers are hosted on Pi NET\nleased IP ranges and that the C2 servers communicate with ip-api[.]com has allowed us to\ndevelop a ‘sweep and scan’ technique over time, providing a process for identifying\nCrimsonRAT C2 servers in the absence of publicly disclosed malware samples.\n\nCrimsonRAT uses a custom C2 protocol where the first five bytes are the size of the rest of\nthe data. Figure 3 is an example of the response to the initial TCP connection to a port where\nthe CrimsonRAT server is listening.\n\n**Figure 2:**\n\n**CrimsonRAT C2 response to initial TCP connection**\nThis response provides us with a distinct signature for CrimsonRAT, made more distinct\nwhen scanning IP addresses assigned to Pi NET LLC that have communicated with ip**api[.]com, which allows us to identify currently active C2 servers.**\n\n_This signature can be implemented in open-source scanning tools (such as Nmap). An_\n_example ‘nmap-service-probes’ file containing the signature for CrimsonRAT C2 servers is_\n_[available on our public GitHub (Happy scanning!)](https://gist.github.com/JoshH-TCS2/0c405359a983ac319ede3e3858ff4f86)_\n\nThe threat reconnaissance methodology is therefore as follows:\n\n1.) Monitor network traffic for all known IP ranges of Pi NET LLC to identify hosts connecting\nto 208.95.112.1:80 (ip-api[.]com).\n\n2.) Review inbound connections to candidate C2 IPs looking for victims beaconing in from\nIndian or Afghanistani-assigned IP addresses (TCP port range 2991–17443).\n\n3.) If potential victim connections are observed, scan the identified port to detect and confirm\na CrimsonRAT C2 response.\n\n4.) Step 2 can be skipped but would require a more exhaustive port sweep at Step 3.\n\nWhen using the above methodology, many ‘known’ CrimsonRAT C2 servers were identified,\nhowever two further servers (185.136.169.139 and 107.173.204.38) were also identified, that\nto our knowledge, had not been publicly reported previously (and do not currently have a\nmalware sample associated with them).\n\n**185.136.169.139**\n\nOpen Port: 3389\n\nC2 Port: 4561,14565,28443\n\nSample: No sample found\n\n\n-----\n\n**107.173.204.38**\n\nOpen Port: 3389\n\nC2 Port: 6576, 8586\n\nSample: No sample found\n\nAn analysis of C2 185.136.169.139 shows victims beaconing in as recently as 01 June 2021,\nwith targeting concentrated in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\n**Figure 3:**\n\n**Victim clustering for C2 185.136.169.139**\n\n**RDP Login Overlap (WeCanSeeYou)**\n\nIn Part 1 of this research, we discussed our hypothesis that Transparent Tribe operators\nlikely managed their infrastructure via RDP, with TCP/3389 being observed open (and had a\nservice running) on 83% of the servers we analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen reviewing screenshot data from the Shodan data holdings for C2 173.249.2230, we\nobserved the user ‘MAINSERVER-PC’ visibly logged in at the time of the screenshot.\nPivoting on this finding has subsequently allowed us to identify potential crossover activity\ndating back to May 2018.\n\n**Figure 4:**\n\n**Shodan screenshot MAINSERVER-PC login**\n_Caveat: this could be legitimate VPS administrator panel traffic or successful bruteforce_\n_attempts on RDP. Since we were unable to speak with the provider we cannot confirm._\n\nReviewing the screenshot history of C2 173.249.22.30 in Shodan showed the following\nactivity timeline with logged in Machine Name and Date(s) Observed.\n\n“MAINSERVER-PC” 2021-04-20, 2021-03-25\n\n“MAIN_SERVER-PC” 2021-02-14, 2021-02-12, 2021-01-04, 2020-12-31, 2020-12-11, 202011-23, 2020-11-16, 2020-09-22, 2020-09-14\n\n“MAIN-SERVER-PC” 2020-08-15, 2020-07-13, 2020-06-30, 2020-06-19, 2020-06-12, 202006-04, 2020-05-28, 2020-05-04, 2020-03-21, 2020-03-05, 2020-03-01, 2020-02-27, 2020-0201, 2020-01-28, 2019-12-31, 2019-12-27, 2019-12-26, 2019-10-22, 2019-10-15\n\n“SHARPLINUX-PC” 2019-09-05, 2019-08-25, 2019-08-21, 2019-08-02, 2019-07-21, 201904-12, 2019-01-24, 2018-11-25, 2018-05-05\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on these possible indicators of successful login activity, a review was undertaken to\ncapture this data for all known CrimsonRAT C2 hosts.\n\nIn addition to C2 173.249.22.30, a pattern of crossover login activity emerged for the\nfollowing C2 servers: 134.119.181.15, 151.106.14.125 and 167.86.89.53, between May 2018\nand May 2021.\n\nThis activity highlighted the odd nature of the renaming of “MAINSERVER” to various similar\nschemas, with the oldest login events showing “SHARPLINUX-PC”.\n\n**Figure 5: Overlapping RDP login events and timeline**\nAs we were still skeptical of the link between these logins and Transparent Tribe, we decided\nto map timestamps related to known CrimsonRAT malware samples (associated with the IP\naddresses in question) to the timestamps observed in Figure 7.\n\nThe results of which are as follows:\n\n**134.119.181.15 – 940667b9051600cbfb471ebc70cda43b**\n\n\n-----\n\nSubmitted 2019-03-23 & Compiled 2019-01-08\n\n**173.249.22.30 – babc1b62dd7c823f8536476aef874a3d**\n\nSubmitted 2019-06-18 & Compiled 2018-07-30\n\n**151.106.14.125 – 7a1f111520e5e74ba09e7f4beac6a84a**\n\nSubmitted 2020-09-17 & Compiled 2020-06-20\n\n**167.86.89.53 – 4bda3f8d0cb36b33244afdb071a20860**\n\nSubmitted 2021-04-27 & Compiled 2021-04-20\n\nAs can be seen, the compilation and submission timestamps fall within the ranges detailed in\nFigure 7, it can therefore be stated that Transparent Tribe were interacting with these C2\nservers at the time the logins were observed.\n\nAs an additional measure to increase our confidence in these findings and to rule out the\nusernames being indicative of default management activity undertaken by Pi NET LLC. A\nVPS was purchased from Pi NET LLC, interactions with which confirmed that these\nusernames were defined by the customer/end user – i.e., potentially Transparent Tribe\nactors.\n\nThe usernames associated with these logins are therefore potential indicators of the group’s\nactivity.\n\nTaking this analysis one step further, we were able to find crossover login activity that linked\nCrimsonRAT C2s (198.46.177.73, 192.99.241.4 and 66.154.113.38) with an AhMyth\nAndroidRAT C2 (212.8.240.221). In this case the usernames observed were ‘WATER-PC’\nand ‘YouCantSeeMe’ (apparently WeCanSeeYou).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6: Overlapping RDP login events of AndroidRAT & CrimsonRAT**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTransparent Tribe continue to pursue their intelligence collection objectives with CrimsonRAT\ntargeted mainly at Indian entities. In this two-part blog series, we have highlighted some of\nthe specific traits associated with CrimsonRAT infrastructure:\n\nThe likely use of RDP / Port 3389 for management activities\nThe prevalence of the Common Name WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8 certificate\nConcentration of activity in Pi NET LLC\nA discernible pattern in the response from the C2 server\n\nUsing the techniques that we have highlighted in this blog, it is possible to identify and track\nC2 servers without first observing associated malware samples, providing an opportunity to\nget a step ahead of the actors. By providing insight into these techniques, including the\nsharing of the Nmap script, we hope to provide the means for others to trace Transparent\nTribe activities, to potentially limit their impact.\n\n\n-----\n\n**APPENDICES**\n\n**CrimsonRAT – Common Name WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8**\n\n**151.106.14.125**\n\nPi NET LLC\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**172.245.247.112**\n\nColoCrossing\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**107.173.204.38**\n\nColoCrossing\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**64.188.12.126**\n\nQuadraNet [Pi NET LLC]\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**23.254.119.11**\n\nB2 Net Solutions [Pi NET LLC]\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**104.144.198.105**\n\nB2 Net Solutions [Pi NET LLC]\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**209.127.16.126**\n\nB2 Net Solutions [Pi NET LLC]\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**104.227.97.53**\n\nB2 Net Solutions [Pi NET LLC]\n\n\n-----\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**198.12.90.116**\n\nColoCrossing\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**151.106.19.220**\n\nPi NET LLC\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**185.136.169.155**\n\nPi NET LLC\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**23.254.119.118**\n\nColoCrossing\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**107.175.1.103**\n\nColoCrossing\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**185.136.169.139**\n\nPi NET LLC\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**167.160.166.177**\n\nQuadraNet [Pi NET LLC]\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n**64.188.25.206**\n\nQuadraNet [Pi NET LLC]\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n\n-----\n\n**66.154.113.38**\n\nQuadraNet [Pi NET LLC]\n\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\nRDP Activity – CrimsonRAT C2’s\n\nChain of custody for these C2 IPs cannot be definitively proven.
