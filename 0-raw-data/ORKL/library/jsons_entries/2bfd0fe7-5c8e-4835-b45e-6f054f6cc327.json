    "plain_text": "# Turla Group Exploits Iranian APT To Expand Coverage Of Victims\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Turla group, also known as Waterbug or VENOMOUS BEAR, is widely reported to be associated with Russian\nactors. Turla uses a range of tools and techniques to target government, military, technology, energy and commercial\norganizations for the purposes of intelligence collection.\n\nPrevious advisories from NCSC detailed Turla’s use of Neuron and Nautilus implants and an ASPX-based backdoor\nalongside the Snake rootkit. This document provides an update on the reported activity, with a particular focus on how\nthose tools were used in the period leading up to, and following, the publication of those advisories.\n\nSince those advisories were published, NCSC, NSA and partner-shared analysis of additional victims and infrastructure\ndetermined the Neuron and Nautilus tools were very likely Iranian in origin. Those behind Neuron or Nautilus were almost\ncertainly not aware of, or complicit with, Turla’s use of their implants.\n\nAfter acquiring the tools – and the data needed to use them operationally – Turla first tested them against victims they had\nalready compromised using their Snake toolkit, and then deployed the Iranian tools directly to additional victims. Turla\nsought to further their access into victims of interest by scanning for the presence of Iranian backdoors and attempting to\nuse them to gain a foothold. The focus of this activity from Turla was largely in the Middle East, where the targeting\ninterests of both Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) overlap.\n\nThe timeline of incidents, and the behavior of Turla in actively scanning for Iranian backdoors, indicates that while Neuron\nand Nautilus tools were Iranian in origin, Turla were using these tools and accesses independently to further their own\nintelligence requirements. The behavior of Turla in scanning for backdoor shells indicates that although they had a\nsignificant amount of insight into the Iranian tools, they did not have full knowledge of where they were deployed.\n\nWhile attribution of attacks and proving authorship of tools can be very difficult – particularly in the space of incident\nresponse on a victim network – the weight of evidence demonstrates that Turla had access to Iranian tools and the ability\nto identify and exploit them to further Turla’s own aims.\n\n## Background: Neuron and Nautilus Usage by Turla\n\n[The NCSC published two advisories](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-malware) on the use of Neuron and Nautilus tools by Turla in late 2017 and early 2018. These\ntools were observed in use alongside Snake on a number of victims.\n\nSince publication of those advisories, further analysis by NCSC, the NSA and the wider Cybersecurity community\ndetermined Neuron and Nautilus tools were present on a range of victims, with a large cluster in the Middle East. Victims\nin this region included military establishments, government departments, scientific organizations and universities. Some of\nthese victims, but not all, also had a Snake implant present.\n\n## Victim Overlap\n\nInvestigation into these victims identified that while some implants had been deployed and administered from\ninfrastructure associated with the Turla group, others had previously been connected to by Virtual Private Server (VPS) IP\naddresses associated in the Cybersecurity community with Iranian APT groups.\n\nInterestingly, in some instances, it appeared an Iranian APT-associated IP address first deployed the implant, and later,\nTurla-associated infrastructure accessed the same implant.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to initiate connections with the implants, Turla must have had access to relevant cryptographic keys, and likely\nhad access to controller software to produce legitimate tasking.\n\nIn other instances, Turla deployed Neuron to victims in which they already had access to via their Snake toolkit, all with\nobserved connections from Turla-associated infrastructure.\n\n## Scanning for Backdoors\n\nTurla also made use of existing Snake victim networks to scan for the ASPX shell described in the initial advisory attempting to identify the presence of, and access, the ASPX webshell on IP addresses in at least 35 countries, including\nSaudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and UAE.\n\nCommands were passed to the ASPX shell in encrypted HTTP Cookie values, requiring knowledge of the cryptographic\nkeys to produce valid tasking and successfully interact with it.\n\nFrom one Snake victim, a log file was recovered which recorded the output of Turla’s scanning for these ASPX shells with\nthe strings “!!!MAY BE SHELL!!! (check version)” and “!!!MAY BE SHELL!!! (100%)”; over 3500 unique IP addresses were\nscanned.\n\nOnce identified, Turla appeared to use these ASPX shells to gain an initial foothold into victims of interest, and then\ndeploy further tools.\n\n## Turla Compromise of Iranian C2 Infrastructure\n\nTurla accessed and used the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure of Iranian APTs to deploy their own tools to\nvictims of interest. Turla directly accessed ‘Poison Frog’ C2 panels from their own infrastructure and used this access to\ntask victims to download additional tools.\n\nReporting from Symantec®[12] details a specific victim in the Middle East where Turla was observed delivering their own\nmalware via a Poison Frog panel, which Symantec and others in the Cybersecurity community attribute to APT34 (also\nknown as OilRig/Crambus).\n\n## Turla Compromise of Iranian Operational Infrastructure\n\nThe Turla group deployed their own implants against the operational infrastructure used by an Iranian APT actor and used\nthis to further their own accesses into the Iranian APT’s global infrastructure.\n\nExfiltration of data from Iranian APT infrastructure to Turla infrastructure took place.\n\nData exfiltrated from the Iranian infrastructure by Turla included directory listings and files, along with keylogger output\ncontaining operational activity from the Iranian actors, including connections to Iranian C2 domains. This access gave\nTurla unprecedented insight into the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of the Iranian APT, including lists of active\nvictims and credentials for accessing their infrastructure, along with the code needed to build versions of tools such as\n\n1 _Waterbug: Espionage Group Rolls Out Brand New Toolset in Attacks Against Governments (Blogpost), 20 June 2019_\n2 _Symantec is a registered trademark of Symantec._\n\n\n-----\n\nNeuron for use entirely independently of Iranian C2 infrastructure.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOC)\n\nAs this advisory provides additional context around historical activity from the Turla group, these IOCs are provided for\ncompleteness. They may be useful to any investigator with historic data from a previous Turla (or Iranian APT)\ninvestigation.\n\n## Indicators for Forensics Analysis\n\nThe following indicators can be used to search for the presence of Turla activity described in this document within forensic\nanalysis tools.\n\n!!!MAY BE SHELL!!! (check version)\n\n!!!MAY BE SHELL!!! (100%)\n\n## Disclaimer of Endorsement\n\nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or guarantees.\nReference herein to any specific commercial products, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, or\notherwise, does not constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the United States Government,\nand this guidance shall not be used for advertising or product endorsement purposes.\n\n## Notice\n\nThe information contained in this document was developed in the course of NSA’s cybersecurity missions including its\nresponsibilities to identify and disseminate threats to national security systems and Department of Defense information\ntechnologies, develop and issue security implementation specifications for cybersecurity-enabled products, and to assist\nExecutive departments and agencies with operational security programs.
