This\nthreat was first found by [Intel Security / McAfee Labs.](https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/takedown-stops-polymorphic-botnet)\n\nAAEH or VOBFUS is a polymorphic malware used as a means by which to pull down a\nvariety of additional types of malware onto a victim machine.\n\nMore information about the botnet takedown can be found at the following links:\n\n[For users in the United States - US-CERT Alert (TA15-098A)](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA15-098A)\n[For users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) - Europol's EC3](https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/international-police-operation-targets-polymorphic-beebone-botnet)\n\nCombatting cybercrime requires public-private collaboration like this. Security researchers\ncan actively provide the necessary threat intelligence or information needed by law\nenforcement to conduct their investigations. With such information and evidence on hand,\nlaw enforcement then provides the legwork to apprehend and indict the cybercriminals\nresponsible. The end result is a safer Internet for everyone, and those who seek to\nperpetuate cybercrime placed behind bars.\n\n\n-----\n\nTrend Micro has worked closely and collaborated with law enforcement agencies to thwart\ncybercriminal operations and subsequently, prevent losses against users and enterprises.\n\n**Botnet Takedowns**\n\nTrend Micro is an active partner with global law enforcement and government task forces in\nthe takedowns of botnets in order end their operations. Internet safety of both our customers\nas well as the Internet at large is paramount to Trend Micro, and we see supporting these\nactivities as a proactive means to protect our customers before they are affected by them.\n\nIn 2011, Trend Micro researchers along with the FBI and Estonian police joined forces to\ntake down a botnet composed of 4,000,000 bots in an operation called as \"Operation Ghost\nClick,\" which took a C&C with more than 100 servers and two data centers offline. Our\n[collaboration also resulted in the arrests of several members of Rove Digital, the Estonia-](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/rove-digital-coder-pleads-guilty/)\nbased cybercriminal gang behind this operation.\n\nMost recently, Trend Micro also aided law enforcement in the disruption of the activities\n[related to Gameover ZeuS. This specific variant of the notorious online banking Trojan came](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/gameover-zeus-with-p2p-functionality-disrupted/)\nwith an added peer-to-peer (P2P) functionality to its C&C server, making it resilient to\ntakedowns.\n\n**Technical Data**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis section describes some of the technical data uncovered that supports Operation\nSource’s involvement in cybercrime.\n\n**_TROJ_HPMYAPP_**\n\n[The malware detected as TROJ_HPMYAPP.SM is the Trend Micro detection for malware that](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/troj_hpmyapp.sm)\nuse a custom packer (or a \"hacker\" packer).\n\nPackers have long been used for legitimate purposes, but may also be used for malicious\nintent, such as evading antivirus detection and concealing vital malware components.\nCustom packers do not have a specific arrival method since they are dependent on the\nmalware it carries; in this case, the AAEH or VOBFUS malware, which will be tackled in\ndepth later on.\n\nThe custom packer first checks if the file myapp.exe exists on the system, and if it does, the\npacker terminates itself. This function was possibly written by malware authors to prevent the\nmalware authors from infecting their own computers.\n\nOnce the custom packer completes the system check, it will decrypt and execute the\nembedded malware, VOBFUS.\n\nAfter the custom packer checks for certain virtual machine modules, it then then decrypts\nVOBFUS in memory and executes it.\n\nOne thing that our engineers noted is that that the packer used here is similar to the packer\nused the recent TorrentLocker series of attacks that hit the ANZ region in early January\n2015.While this does not necessarily mean both attacks are related, it does point to the\npacker method being used more commonly by cybercriminals.\n\n**_VOBFUS_**\n\nAfter AAEH or VOBFUS is executed in memory, it carries out its routines which include\nchecking for strings on the system to see if it is running on a virtual machine. This is a typical\ntactic to evade security vendors’ efforts in analyzing the malware, meaning that those behind\nthe attack are anticipating security counter-efforts. If the malware detects that it is running on\na virtual machine, it does not execute its malicious routines.\n\nIf not, it then proceeds to dropping .LNK or shortcut files in removable drives that point to a\ncopy of itself. The malware tricks users into clicking the shortcut files that use file names like\n_Love You.exe, Nude.exe, etc._\n\nAdditionally, the malware uses the names of existing folders and file names with common\nextension. This routine enables a copy of VOBFUS to execute first before opening or running\nthe real folder or file.\n\n\n-----\n\nVOBFUS also attempts to connect to certain remote DNS servers. After it does this, it will\nreceive commands from remote malicious users.\n\nIt is important to note that AAEH or VOBFUS may be used to download other malware. This\nmeans that cleanup for AAEH or VOBFUS will not necessarily clean secondary infections\nthat may have occurred because of it.\n\n**_Network Fingerprints_**\n\nThe following network fingerprints have also been validated. Listed below is the network\ntraffic:\n\n_timechk[1-9]{1,2}.[com|net|org]_\n\n**Trend Micro Solutions**\n\nTrend Micro endpoint users are protected from this threat via Trend Micro™ Internet\n[Security, while businesses are also protected via Trend Micro™ OfficeScan and](https://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/product-security/officescan/index.html) Trend\nMicro™ Worry-Free Business Security.\n\n[Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery detects network traffic or C&C communications related to the](https://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/index.html)\nBeebone botnet.\n\nNon-Trend Micro users can also be protected against this threat by using our free online\n[virus scanner HouseCall, which is able to clean and detect threats related to the Beebone](http://housecall.trendmicro.com/)\nbotnet.\n\n_*This page will be updated with further developments with regard to Operation Source._\n\n\n-----",
