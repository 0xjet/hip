TA453 (aka CHARMING KITTEN and\nPHOSPHORUS) has historically aligned with Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)\ncollection priorities, targeting dissidents, academics, diplomats, and journalists. This latest\ncampaign, dubbed BadBlood, is a deviation from the group’s usual activity. [1,2,3] While this\ncampaign may represent a shift in TA453 targeting overall, it is also possible it may be the\nresult of a specific short term intelligence collection requirement. BadBlood is aligned with an\n[escalating trend of medical research being increasingly targeted by threat actors.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/email-and-cloud-threats/practitioners-update-understanding-threat-actors-and-their-objectives)\n\nProofpoint researchers have named this campaign BadBlood based on the medical focus\nand continued geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel.\n\n**Credential Phishing Campaign**\n\nIn this December 2020 campaign, TA453 used an actor-controlled Gmail account that\nmasqueraded as a prominent Israeli physicist. The account (zajfman.daniel[@]gmail.com)\nsent messages with the subject \"Nuclear weapons at a glance: Israel\" and contained social\nengineering lures relating to Israeli nuclear capabilities. These malicious emails contained a\nlink to the TA453-controlled domain 1drv[.]casa. When clicked, the URL leads to a landing\nsite [spoofing Microsoft's OneDrive service along with an image of a PDF document logo](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/email-spoofing)\ntitled CBP-9075.pdf.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: TA453 Landing Site with PDF Document Logo_\n\nWhen a user attempts to view and download the PDF document, 1drv[.]casa delivers a\nforged Microsoft login page which attempts to harvest user credentials. Attempting to use\nany other hyperlink in the webpage results in the same redirect to the same forged Microsoft\nlogin page, except for the \"Create one!\" link. This tab leads to the legitimate Microsoft\nOutlook “Sign Up” page at hxxps://signup.live[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: TA453 Credential Harvesting Page at 1drv[.] casa_\n\nOnce an email is entered by the user and “Next” is clicked, the page prompts for a password.\n\nOnce a user enters their credentials, they are then redirected to Microsoft’s OneDrive where\nthe benign \"Nuclear weapons at a glance: Israel\" document is hosted.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Microsoft OneDrive TA453 Benign Document_\n\nAt this time, it does not appear 1drv[.]casa conducts any sort of [multi-factor authentication](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/multifactor-authentication)\nbypass. Although Proofpoint does not currently have further visibility into how TA453 used\nany credentials obtained from this specific campaign, public reporting from CERTFA\nindicates TA453 has previously used harvested credentials to exfiltrate email inbox contents.\n\n[4] In select prior campaigns, Iranian-aligned actors, including TA453, have used\n[compromised accounts for further phishing.[5]](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/phishing)\n\n**Targeting**\n\nTA453 targeted less than 25 senior professionals at a variety of medical research\norganizations located in the US and Israel. Proofpoint analysis of the targets’ publicly\navailable research efforts and resumes indicate TA453 targeted individuals with a\nbackground in either genetics, oncology, or neurology. These medical professionals appear\nto be extremely senior personnel at a variety of medical research organizations. Additionally,\nTA453 targeting Israeli organizations and individuals is consistent with increased geopolitical\ntensions between Israel and Iran during 2020. [6]\n\nAt this time, Proofpoint cannot conclusively determine the motivation of actors conducting\nthese campaigns. As collaboration for medical research is often conducted informally over\nemail, this campaign may demonstrate that a subset of TA453 operators have an intelligence\nrequirement to collect specific medical information related to genetic, oncology, or neurology\nresearch. Alternatively, this campaign may demonstrate an interest in the patient information\nof the targeted medical personnel or an aim to use the recipients' accounts in further\n\n\n-----\n\nphishing campaigns. While this campaign may represent a shift in TA453 targeting overall, it\nis also possible it may be an outlier, reflective of a specific priority intelligence tasking given\nto TA453.\n\n**Attribution**\n\nWhile Proofpoint cannot independently attribute TA453 to the IRGC, the tactics and\ntechniques observed in BadBlood continue to mirror those used in historic TA453 campaigns\nand the overall targeting of TA453 campaigns detected by Proofpoint appear to support\nIRGC intelligence collection priorities.[7]\n\nIn 2019, the US Department of Justice indicted four Iranian individuals for using social media\nand credential phishing emails to conduct malicious computer intrusions on behalf of the\nIRGC.[8] Private industry reporting identified this activity as part of CHARMING KITTEN in\nboth 2017 and 2019.[9,10] In early 2019, Microsoft reported TA453 was abusing well known\nemail brands to conduct spear phishing operations against government agencies, political\ntargets, and journalists on behalf of the Iranian government.[11]\n\n**Related Infrastructure**\n\nWhile investigating this campaign, Proofpoint Threat Research identified other domains\nattributed to TA453 with high confidence based on network infrastructure components,\ncampaign timing, and similarity in lure documents. Both Proofpoint and VirusTotal telemetry\nindicated additional actor-controlled domains were used in TA453 campaigns attempted to\ncompromise more traditional TA453 targets with a similar attack-chain in late December\n2020. Finally, the provided lure documents at the end of the attack chain share similar,\nnational security themes, including Congressional Research Reports, think tank publications,\nand other policy minded documents. While researchers were not able to directly correlate all\nof these domains with phishing campaigns, we judge this activity to be consistent with the\nBadBlood campaign.\n\n_Figure 4: Diagram of Related Infrastructure_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Final 1drv[.]xyz Lure “Reviving The Revolutionaries Document”_\n\n_Figure 6: Final 1drv[.]surf Lure Congressional Research Service Document_\n\n**Outlook**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile TA453 has consistently demonstrated a desire to collect and exfiltrate the email\nmailbox contents belonging to typical intelligence targets of the Iranian government like the\nIranian diaspora, policy analysts, and educators, this TA453 campaign demonstrated a\ndesire to target medical researchers and providers. Further detection and analysis of TA453\ncampaigns will likely determine whether this targeting is an outlier or if targeting has evolved\nto support the medical sector becoming a consistent intelligence requirement and target for\nTA453.\n\nWhile targeting medical experts in genetics, neurology and oncology may not be a lasting\nshift in TA453 targeting, it does indicate at least a temporary change in TA453 collection\npriorities. BadBlood is aligned with an escalating trend globally of medical research being\nincreasingly targeted by espionage motivated focused threat actors.
