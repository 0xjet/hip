Insikt Group identified six\nCobalt Strike Beacon samples linked to this activity. The infrastructure used for this campaign\nimplemented Cloudflare protection to obfuscate its origin. As of this writing, the websites remain\ncompromised and host the malicious JavaScript, and portions of the malicious infrastructure likely\nremain active.\n\nThis activity was conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group we are calling TAG-112.\nThe group is particularly interested in targeting the Tibetan community and has several overlaps with\nTAG-102 (Evasive Panda).\n\nInsikt Group followed responsible disclosure procedures in advance of this publication per Recorded\nFuture's prenotification policy.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - TAG-112 likely compromised the Tibet Post (tibetpost[.]net) and Gyudmed Tantric University\n(gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org) websites on or around May 23, 2024. These websites remain\ncompromised as of this writing.\n\n  - The compromised websites were manipulated to prompt visitors to the sites to download a\nmalicious executable disguised as a “security certificate” that ultimately loaded a Cobalt Strike\npayload upon execution.\n\n  - The group likely exploited a vulnerability in the website's content management system, Joomla,\nto upload the malicious JavaScript.\n\n  - TAG-112 is likely a subgroup of TAG-102 (Evasive Panda), working toward the same or similar\nintelligence requirements, mainly focusing on targeting Tibetan entities. Despite these overlaps,\nInsikt Group is tracking this activity as a separate entity due to the difference in maturity\nbetween these campaigns.\n\n  - [The Tibetan community in exile, along with other religious and ethnic minority groups in China,](https://thediplomat.com/2019/12/community-in-exile-indias-little-tibet/)\nhave long been targets for various Chinese cyber-espionage (advanced persistent threat; APT)\n[groups (1, 2, 3). Beijing perceives these groups as subversive or separatist elements](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/redalpha-cyber-campaigns) challenging\n[Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule, as well as avenues for foreign influence](https://thediplomat.com/2019/05/where-does-tibet-fit-into-the-us-china-relationship/) or interference in\nChina’s internal affairs.\n\n1 CTA-CN-2024-1112 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\n#### Malicious JavaScript\n\nInsikt Group was recently made aware of a compromised website with close ties to the Tibetan\ncommunity. The compromise took place in late May 2024. The threat actors modified a JavaScript file\nto include a segment of malicious code (see Appendix C). This prompted website visitors to download\na malicious executable disguised as a “security certificate” that ultimately loaded a Cobalt Strike\nBeacon payload.\n\n**_Figure 1: Diagram of the observed infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nThe malicious JavaScript is triggered by the window.onload event. It first checks the user's operating\nsystem and web browser type; this is likely to filter out non-Windows operating systems, as this\nfunction will terminate the script if Windows isn’t detected. The collected browser information is sent to\nthe TAG-112 domain update[.]maskrisks[.]com via a GET request with the browser type encapsulated in\na URL variable, ?type={Chrome or Edge}. This initial request returns a JSON object with a “forbid”\nboolean used to control the further execution and an HTML template spoof certificate error page that\nmatches the user's browser. If this initial request returns an error, the script exits and does not affect\nthe website.\n```\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Chrome\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Edge\n\n```\n**_Figure 2: URLs used in the initial GET request to return a spoofed HTML template (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n2 CTA-CN-2024-1112 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\na malicious executable disguised as a “security certificate” that ultimately loaded a Cobalt Strike\nBeacon payload.\n\n**_Figure 1: Diagram of the observed infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nThe malicious JavaScript is triggered by the window.onload event.

After a two-second delay, the\nscript triggers an alert with the message “Click to download the security certificate” and automatically\nclicks a link to the download URL appended to the document body, starting the download of the\nmalicious file, as shown in Figure 6.\n\n1 “domian” is misspelled in both the malicious JavaScript snippet and HTML template.\n\n4 CTA-CN-2024-1112 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: X.509 certificate for dnspod[.]cn found in HTML template source code, SHA256:_**\n_[D0972247C500D2A45F412F9434287161DE395A35EF5B4931CBA12CF513B76962 (Source: Recorded Future)](https://securitytrails.com/app/sb/certificate/d0972247c500d2a45f412f9434287161de395a35ef5b4931cba12cf513b76962)_\n\n\n5 CTA-CN-2024-1112 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n6 CTA-CN-2024-1112 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - _154.90.62[.]12 — Active since at least August 7, 2024_\n\n  - _154.90.63[.]166 — Active since at least June 18, 2024_\n\n  - _154.205.138[.]202 — Active since at least March 19, 2024_\n\nThe apex domain maskrisks[.]com was registered with Namecheap on March 18, 2024.

Ensure that users\nhave not configured their systems or applications to automatically execute or open files\ndownloaded from their browser.\n\n  - Detect and block malicious Cobalt Strike C2 servers in real-time via the [Recorded Future®](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence)\n[Threat Intelligence module.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence)\n\n  - By monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA), Recorded Future clients can be alerted to likely\ncompromised hosts communicating with validated C2 infrastructure, including for Cobalt\nStrike.\n\n10 CTA-CN-2024-1112 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Outlook\n\nThis TAG-112 campaign is emblematic of long-established intelligence requirements for Chinese\n[cyber-espionage operators to gather information on the Tibetan community in exile and organizations](https://thediplomat.com/2019/12/community-in-exile-indias-little-tibet/)\ninvolved in Tibetan human rights and/or independence movements.
