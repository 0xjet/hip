The United States peaked at about 500 and Asia at about 1,000\napplications scanned in March, containing the two keywords.\n\nInterestingly, Bitdefender telemetry also shows that Android users have been more\ninterested in downloading and installing medical applications from Google Play. For\nexample, during the first two weeks of March, the number of scanned applications from the\nmedical category increased more than 35 percent compared to February.\n\nThese numbers show that, as the novel coronavirus outbreak increased in severity\nthroughout Europe and worldwide, the public sought out applications that provided\ninformation on procedures for avoiding infection, updates regarding COVID-19, and even\nmedical appointment booking services.\n\nIn terms of analyzing applications from other, third-party marketplaces, while some\napplications have been repacked to include aggressive adware, others have been bundled\nwith banking Trojans, SMS-sending malware, and even the money-siphoning Android\nmalware named Joker Trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome malware developers have devoted more effort to financially capitalize on the\ncoronavirus outbreak. For example, some applications have been bundled with the\nlegitimate apps they’re piggybacking, while others blatantly feature an obviously suspicious\nversion name (e.g. “[SPY_NOTE_VERSION_OK]”).\n\n_The next chapters include more information on findings from the Google Play store and_\n_coronavirus-themed Android malware._\n\n## Riding the Coronavirus Wave\n\nMany apps contain the “coronavirus” keyword, or derivations of it, in their package name.\nSome news apps have also pushed an update containing an activity (UI component)\ndedicated to coronavirus (for example, a world map of confirmed cases).\n\nAlso, the popularity of medical appointment apps has increased, especially in the last few\n[weeks. One such example is “Zocdoc Find A Doctor & Book On Demand Appointments.”](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zocdoc.android&hl=en)\nThis app registered 867 scans between March 7 and March 16 (roughly 100 per day), out of\nwhich 97 percent were in the US. With more than 500,000 installs and 6,850 reviews, this\nmedical appointment app has been highly popular in the United States where people are\ntrying to set up appointments with doctors, potentially to be tested for COVID-19.\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, we found 579 applications that contain coronavirus-related keywords\nin their manifest (package name, activities, receivers, etc.). This means that a major\ncomponent of the application was named in way – or the application contains strings – that\nrelates it to the recent outbreak. Out of the total, 560 are clean, 9 are Trojans and 10 are\nRiskware. The distribution of such apps has increased dramatically from January 1st to\nMarch 17th, as can be noted from the histogram bellow.\n\nFig. 1 – Coronavirus-themed Android apps scanned between January and March\n\nMost malicious apps found are bundle threats that range from ransomware, to SMSsending malware, and even spyware designed to clean out the contents of victims’ devices\nfor personal or financial data.\n\n## Tweaking Content to Gain Google Play Ranking on Coronavirus\n\nAs soon as the coronavirus pandemic was officially declared, Google started making\nadjustments to Google Play searches to purposely filter or remove coronavirus apps.\n\nFor example, searching for keywords like “corona” or “coronavirus” would display no search\n[results in the Apps section. This was in line with a blog post published by Google,](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/coronavirus-covid19-response/)\nexplaining how these actions are meant to help offer only relevant information and\napplications that people in need might require.\n\n\n-----\n\n[They even set up a webpage within the Google Play marketplace where only legitimate and](https://play.google.com/store/apps/topic?id=campaign_editorial_3003109_crisis_medical_outbreak_apps_cep&hl=en_US)\nrelevant applications that offered information about coronavirus or healthcare were\ndisplayed, in an attempt to steer users in the right direction.\n\nGoogle likely anticipated a rise in opportunistic applications latching on to this topic of global\ninterest and decided to clamp down on any potential abuse.\n\nFor instance, some apps have changed their name and description to capitalize on the\ncoronavirus pandemic by including keywords that ensure their apps rank best when people\nsearch for coronavirus in Google Play. Some of these changes are skin-deep, in that only\nthe application’s page on Google Play has been updated, and not the app itself.\n\n[Bubble Shooter Merge (updated February 4th), is just one example where the developer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hafgames.bubblesm)\ntwice updated the name of the application within Google Play to include the “coronavirus”\nand “stay home” keywords.\n\nWith these simple changes, apps become more “visible,” taking advantage of the\n#coronavirus pandemic or the #stayhome challenge, although the app content wasn’t\nrelated to COVID-19 in any way.\n\n[Another example is Galaxy Shooter – Falcon Squad, an arcade game with over 10 million](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=invaders.os.galaxy.space.shooter.attack.classic)\ninstalls. The recent update includes an “Anti Corona Event” in the application’s title that’s\nvisible only to English-speaking countries, potentially to match #corona searches.\n\nAnother interesting finding involves a developer changing their application name on Google\nPlay from “4K Wallpaper – only quality wallpapers!” to “Coronavirus (2019-nCov) – Protect\nyourself!.”\n\nThe changes go a lot deeper. The developer even changed the original screenshots of the\napplication that showcased some of the wallpapers available, replacing them with what\nseems to be a coronavirus infection map.\n\nThis means that the package name has remained completely the same\n(“com.thegosa.galaxythemes”) with the developer simply leveraging coronavirus to boost an\nalready impressive download count of over 500,000 installs.\n\nAt the moment, approximately 22 apps that use the “coronavirus” keyword are still online,\nmost of them official and listed under the “Health and Fitness” or “Medical” categories.\n\nHowever, about 280 applications have been removed from Google Play, likely because they\ninfringed policies outlined by Google in terms of abusing the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSome of the apps removed from Google Play involve regional or global coronavirus\ntrackers, with installs ranging from 5,000 to 50,000.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Coronavirus-Themed Bankers, Spyware, and Infostealers\n\nBitdefender researchers also took a look at some of the applications found on various thirdparty marketplaces or disseminated through phishing campaigns where users were\ninstructed to manually download and install them directly from the attacker-controlled\nwebsite.\n\nAs expected, most of these malicious applications leverage the coronavirus pandemic to\nscare users into installing the apps. Others use variations on coronavirus domains to hide\ntheir command and control infrastructure.\n\n**Anubis banker joins in on the corona mischief**\n\nFor the first time, the Anubis banking Trojan has been spotted as part of an Android\ncoronavirus malware campaign. The application imitates a Coronavirus information site\nand, on installation, asks for accessibility. If given access, it will request various other\npermissions and accept them by itself.\n\nTo throw users off track, it takes them to a coronavirus statistics website\n(https://coronatracker.com/) then proceeds to hide its icon while, in the background, it\ncontinues with an arsenal of functionalities, specific to Anubis.\n\nInitially, Anubis targeted countries ranging from the US and India to France, Italy, Germany,\nAustralia, and Poland, however this recent Android version seems to target Turkey, by\nimpersonating the legitimate website to which it redirects users.\n\nThe “uygulama aktiflestirme onayi” message is translated into “application activation\nconfirmation” (Turkish)\n\n**MD5:**\n\nb7070a1fa932fe1cc8198e89e3a799f3\n\n64ebe4ecfb242019ee590d80740e6a46\n\n**Detection: Android.Trojan.Banker.OB**\n\n**Abusing the infamous Iranian AC19 app**\n\nOne such case abuses the now-famous Iranian corona information application AC19\n(hxxps://cafebazaar.ir/app/co.health.covid), which stirred up quite a lot of controversy in Iran\nover fears of spying.\n\nThis application is installed by its malicious parent (com.android.tester\n_8eb1a54389bd742b778e56fe9dd4b11d, application label: corona). The sample asks for_\npermissions to allow scanning for the coronavirus, but in fact will ask for sensitive Android\napplication privileges that that malware uses to continue its malicious spying activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Spying and surveillance lot**\n\nAnother malicious spying lot contains the legitimate corona live application (wrapper over\nthe [Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker). While previous reports have covered some of the](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)\nbelow-mentioned samples, Bitdefender researchers also found two more Crona named\nsamples, showing that authors are clearly continuing this campaign with no end in sight.\n\nTwo of the new applications, were created with invalid package names and cannot install.\nThe rush to milk the ongoing pandemic is quite high, which seems to make malicious actors\nprone to error.\n\nAll new application icons respect known variations of the family.\n\nThe legitimate application is stored, internally, in the /res folder of the APK; in\n**res/raw/MT_Bin or res/raw/google.apk.**\n\nFrom the same malware family, we have found three newer variations that have only the\napplication name corona viruse without carrying with them the legitimate sample. They\nsimply hide the icon on launch.\n\nAn odd trait of these applications is that all three have the version name:\n\n**[SPY_NOTE_VERSION_OK]**\n\n**Coronavirus Tracker is the name, adware is the game**\n\nAnother example of an application that abuses these times for ill-gotten gain bears the\nname Coronavirus Tracker (e423f61f1414eccd38649f20d018723d) and gives out adware\nto unsuspecting users.\n\nAt start-up, the application says it is “not available in your country” and hides itself. It will\nstay dormant for a time before actually starting to bombard the user with ads.\n\nAn interesting observation is that, in some cases, the application will not hide the icon on\nXiaomi devices. While the reason is unknown, this could indicate that Xiaomi is a personal\nfavorite of the malware authors.\n\nBitdefender also found the CnC from where it downloads configurations (api[.]jetrohe[.]pw),\npotentially to display customized apps.\n\n**MD5: e423f61f1414eccd38649f20d018723d**\n\n**Detection: Android.Trojan.HiddenAds.ALB by Bitdefender.**\n\n**It might get lonely in coronavirus times**\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother interesting sample in the corona campaign is an application named\nCORONAVIRUS (com.MaCHIbuild.Ninjaclimbs.jumpout). At first, it seems to be a simple\nwrapper over the coronavirus information world map\n[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/.](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n\nUnexpectedly, the application has a different logic behind the scenes. It retrieves\ninformation from its CnC http[:]//contorl.okapk[.]website/AmineData.json and will either\nopen the WebView with the world map, or an entirely different link, provided by the CnC.\n\nFor example, the CnC now returns:\n\n{ \"web_data\": { \"status\": \"0\", \"link\": \"https://google.com\" }\n\nWith this logic, if the “status” is “0” then the application opens the coronavirus world map. At\nany given time, should the developers chose to change this, your trusty coronavirus-fighting\napp turns into something malicious.\n\nAdware and adult content mostly likely come next. Within the application’s code, we see\nsome partially implemented functions that load custom StartApp Ads, Ogury Ads and\nAdmob Ads as well as the ability to open a Chrome tab with a custom provided link.\n\nWe estimate that adult content will be provided, because of another partially implemented\npart of the application. The application prepares a link to https[:]//t.grtyb[.]com (which\nredirects to hxxps://www[.]thepornstudy[.]com, a pornographic survey site) to be loaded into\nits own WebView. In this URL, the author will add specific tokens and referrals that will\ngenerate revenue for the application’s developer each time a victim visits the link.\n\n**MD5: 783277390d3fb1ad0fb7751d982d21ff**\n**Detection: Android.Riskware.HiddenAds.GX**\n\n**Iranian coronavirus apps**\n\nﮐﺮوﻧﺎ وﯾﺮوس means coronavirus in Persian, and seems to be an informative app that helps\nusers identify common symptoms of the illness while keeping in touch with news related to\nthe outbreak.\n\nThe app was developed using a framework, as most parts of the code seem generated in\nan automatic fashion, making the code logic harder to grasp.\n\nThe core functionality of the app is found in the firebase messaging component, as the\nserver communicates with the app through JSON objects.\n\nThe received JSON message is checked by the app and, based on what commands are\nreceived, the application’s behavior can be remotely controlled by messages received from\nthe server.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe central functionality of the app is similar to apps identified with the detection\nAndroid.Riskware.HiddenApp.GN, but it has been adapted to contain information regarding\nthe coronavirus, as it represents a major attraction point for Android users while also\nproviding the opportunity to bombard them with popups.\n\nOne functionality of the app is the ability to redirect any link sent through firebase\nmessaging to a browser.\n\nAnother interesting functionality is triggered when it receives a firebase command message\ncontaining Telegram. The provided link is used to open specific Telegram channels or\ngroups.\n\nThe application will first search for the original Telegram application on the device. If it is not\npresent, it searches for similar chat apps that are popular in Iran. The first one found is then\nopened, and the link can be seen as a popup in those applications.\n\nNot only can it open webpages and chat apps but, depending on the issued command, it\ncan also receive package names that it will try to open either on Google Play or on\nCafeBazaar, a popular Iranian Android market.\n\nThe application also has the ability to open any Instagram page received from firebase\nmessaging:\n\nIn a nutshell, this coronavirus app can be much more than an informative application and its\nfunctionalities are likely to be used in a way that is harmful to users.\n\n**MD5s:**\nb0a418ce4f5439ddcb9c864e5ffd45a4\n1897b6b9e3f2eab26d7175c14290129d\n31092e0fefbe653d27479edb0e7f849a\n\n**Detection: Android.Riskware.HiddenAds.HZ**\n\n**The Joke(r) is on you**\n\nIt seems the Joker Trojan is also trying to capitalize on the corona outbreak. Although it only\ntries to hide its CnC using a coronavirus domain variation, the UI of the gaming application\nremains unchanged.\n\nDistributed with the iFun Game (Android.Trojan.Joker.GC), the app is repackaged with the\nJoker malware, which downloads a payload from the http[:]//coronavirus.oss**accelerate.aliyuncs[.]com CnC.**\n\nOf course, Joker obfuscates the CnC so that static analysis does not identify it. However, as\ncan be seen in the screenshot below, it simply shifts some letters.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe application can still be found on third party-marketplaces.\n\n**MD5: fed0a95f4e1936500e7c8c990666c7a6**\n**Detection: Android.Trojan.Joker.GC**\n\n**Additional Android banking malware**\n\nAdditional Trojan Banking malware hijacking coronavirus news includes a banking Trojan\ndesigned to act as a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) enabling attackers to gain persistency on\nthe victim’s device while syphoning sensitive information.\n\nIn some new instances the authors only bothered to change the application’s name from\nCoronavirus to CoronaVirus.\n\nAs people become more aware that they might be targeted with Corona-related scams,\nmalware authors take this into consideration. For instance, while targeting Italian users,\nmalware developers changed the name of the malware to Aggiornamento, which means\n“Update” in Italian.\n\nOne small difference with the malicious version of the Coronavirus Finder is related to the\ndisplayed UI. On installation, it takes users to accessibility settings. After activation, it opens\ndifferent settings and automatically deactivates various things. It then opens an activity\nwhere victims are supposed to enter their credit card details.\n\nIf you try to go to the Settings menu, then hit Applications and scroll down, the malware will\ntake you to the home screen, preventing victims from uninstalling the app. Of course, it can\nalso hide its icon, just to make it even more annoying and difficult.\n\n**MD5:**\n\n2a4fe8c50de598066995bbfed2754c8f\n\ndad9de0c3fa9b80dc1bc12535b851b5b\n\n6815eb50505890c868f36649b07bc92d\n\na8dd3cd7860f3fd2d34a33b0c87bd615\n\nd5ea5d3d9f6b44cf183ddd61c44c056e\n\n**Detection: Android.Trojan.Banker.MS**\n\n**“Hacking” Pandemic: The Board Game**\n\nA fake app claims to provide a hack for “Pandemic: The Board Game” (which can be found\non Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?\nid=com.f2zentertainment.pandemic&hl=en) but it actually only shows adware, tries to get\nthe user’s phone number, and advertises another popular Google Play game\n[(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.igg.android.lordsmobile&hl=en).](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.igg.android.lordsmobile&hl=en)\n\n\n-----\n\nBesides all that, the malware we ve detected as Android.Trojan.HiddenApp.AIT, also hides\nitself.\n\nOn launch the application shows a fake human verification step.\n\nBut in reality, pressing the indicated “free” option only displays more ads.\n\n**MD5: 5b22b1782f58081c2a6c94703268693e**\n**Detection: Android.Trojan.HiddenApp.AIT**\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThe Coronavirus pandemic might have everyone running around after information,\nsearching for applications that offer live monitoring or even medical appointments to get\ntested. It’s always recommended that you install only official apps from official\nmarketplaces, and seek information only from official sources. Also, it’s crucial to make sure\nyou have a mobile security solution that can keep you and your device safe from malware\nand other online threats.\n\n_Note: This article is based in technical information provided courtesy of the Bitdefender_\n_Labs teams._\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Oana ASOLTANEI\n\nOana Asoltanei is a Security Researcher at Bitdefender.
