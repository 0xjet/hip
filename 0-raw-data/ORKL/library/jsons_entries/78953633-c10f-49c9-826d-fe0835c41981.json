In addition to working with\nICS owners, operators, and vendors, ICS-CERT coordinates\nits efforts with Federal, state, local, and tribal governments.\nICS-CERT operates within the National Cybersecurity and\nCommunications Integration Center (NCCIC), a division of the\nDepartment of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National Protection\nand Programs Directorate (NPPD).\n\nNCCIC’s mission is to operate at the intersection of the private\nsector, civilian, law enforcement, intelligence, and defense\ncommunities, applying unique analytic perspectives, ensuring\nshared situational awareness, and orchestrating synchronized\n\n\nresponse efforts while protecting the Constitutional and\nprivacy rights of Americans in both the cybersecurity and\ncommunications domains.\n\nICS-CERT’s activities are composed of four operations functions\nand four risk reduction functions. Operations functions include\nincident response, vulnerability coordination, situational\nawareness, and technical analysis. Risk reduction functions\ninclude cybersecurity assessments, the Cyber Security\nEvaluation Tool (CSET), training, and the Industrial Control\nSystems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG).\n\nCI asset owners benefit from ICS-CERT’s cybersecurity services\nin many ways, including an increased awareness of emerging\nthreats, state-of-the-art analysis, incident response support,\nestablished partnerships, and collaboration with other agencies\nand partners. By extension, Americans benefit from ICS-CERT’s\nwork with access to a more secure and resilient CI, which\nundergirds our economy and provides many of the critical\nservices we rely on every day.\n\n\n## 16 Critical Infrastructure Sectors\n\n\nChemical Dams Financial Services Information Technology\n\nCommercial Facilities Defense Industrial Base Food and Agriculture Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste\n\nCommunications Emergency Services Government Facilities Transportation Systems\n\nCritical Manufacturing Energy Healthcare and Public Health Water and Wastewater Systems\n\n\n-----\n\n# ICS-CERT 2014 Highlights\n\n  - **Havex and BlackEnergy Activities: The ICS-CERT Team**\nconducted an action campaign to provide classified\nbriefings with contextual and detailed information\nabout Havex and BlackEnergy malware for private\nsector CI asset owners. These briefings covered\n15 cities, from November 25 through December\n11. ICS-CERT also hosted a webinar and released\nmultiple alerts and advisories with detailed actionable\ninformation related to the malware characteristics\nas well as methods for detecting compromise and\nimproving cyber defenses. ICS-CERT reached nearly\n1,400 participants across all 16 CI sectors with these\nbriefings.\n\n  - **Heartbleed OpenSSL Activities: The Vulnerability**\nCoordination Team released detailed and timely\nadvisories, conducted briefings, and hosted two\nwebinars featuring the original researchers who\ndiscovered the Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability. The\nteam acted quickly to identify affected ICS products\nand developed multiple alerts in coordination with the\nvendor community to prevent any major incidents.\n\n  - **Onsite Assessments: The ICS-CERT Assessments Team**\ndeployed to 21 different states, conducting 104 onsite\n\n\ncybersecurity assessments to assist CI asset owners in\nstrengthening the overall cybersecurity posture of\ntheir ICSs.\n\n- **“Safeguard” Assessments: ICS-CERT and the Federal**\nEnergy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Office of\nEnergy Infrastructure Security (OEIS) introduced a\nnew technical service offering entitled “Safeguard.”\nThis engagement provided select asset owners with\nproactive and customized cyber assessment services\nbased on their specific interest and area of focus.\n\n- **Online Training: The ICS-CERT Training Team launched**\nnew online training modules with a blended learning\napproach, which makes accessing course material\neasier and more efficient, reduces redundancy in\ntraining materials, and eliminates the need to travel to\nparticipate in ICS-CERT training.\n\n- **CSET Tool: The CSET Development Team released two**\nnew versions of CSET in 2014, CSET 6.0 in February\nand CSET 6.1 in August. The latest version includes the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nFramework, which allows asset owners to create their\nown question sets and provides industry organizations\nthe ability to collaborate in creating and sharing\nquestion sets.\n\n\n-----\n\nPhoto credit: Stephen Barrett / DHS OPA\n\n\n# ICS-CERT Watch Floor Operations\n\n### Information Sharing and Situational Awareness\nThe ICS-CERT watch floor is staffed by approximately\ntwo dozen analysts and incident handlers across two\ngeographically separate watch floor locations. These\nwatch floors handled numerous operational activities,\nwhich include responding to reported cyber incidents,\nproviding recovery and mitigation support, vulnerability\ncoordination and analysis, interfacing with law enforcement\nand the Intelligence Community, and providing situational\nawareness alerts and advisories to warn of cyber threats\naffecting the Nation’s critical infrastructure. In 2014,\nICS-CERT expanded its information sharing initiatives\nthrough webinars and teleconferences with public and\nprivate sector partners. ICS-CERT also works closely with\nInformation Sharing Analysis Centers (ISACs), researchers,\nvendors, sector specific agencies, industry associations,\nand other partners across the Nation’s 16 CI sectors to\ncoordinate cyber risk reduction efforts. In fact, it is these\n\n\nstrong partnerships with key stakeholders across all sectors\nand government agencies that put ICS-CERT in the unique\nposition of providing clear situational awareness of the\nthreat landscape and associated defensive measures. Timely\nand accurate information is essential to cybersecurity\npreparedness.\n\nIn 2014, ICS-CERT tracked and responded to multiple\nnewly discovered cyber campaigns that had been ongoing\nfor several years. The delayed time to discovery, coupled\nwith the tactics of the threat actors, was of great concern\nto ICS-CERT, particularly when considering the potential\nfor a large victim footprint across the Nation’s CI sectors.\nAccordingly, ICS-CERT leveraged well-established\nrelationships to encourage asset owners to be more\nproactive in reporting incidents, which then provided a\nbetter understanding of the depth and breadth of these\ncampaigns by sophisticated threat actors. Asset owners\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n# Vulnerability Coordination\n\nICS-CERT coordinates vulnerability activities with ICS\nowners, operators, and vendors and with Federal, state,\nlocal, and tribal governments to reduce the likelihood of a\nsuccessful cyber attack against CI control systems.\n\nThe ICS-CERT vulnerability handling process involves five\nbasic steps: 1) detection and collection, 2) analysis, 3)\nmitigation coordination, 4) application of mitigation, and\n5) disclosure. ICS-CERT attempts to coordinate all reported\nvulnerabilities with the associated vendor and works to\npublicly disclose the vulnerabilities in a timely manner.\n\nIn November 2014, the Vulnerability Coordination team\nreleased a Vulnerability Coordination report detailing its\nactivities from 2010–2013. This report provides trend\nanalysis for all vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT and\ngives descriptions, details, and metrics for the most\ncommonly identified vulnerabilities. The report shows\nthat improper input validation, at 61 percent of reported\nvulnerabilities, is by far the most common.\n\n\n### Heartbleed Vulnerability\nThe Vulnerability Coordination team devoted a significant\namount of time and effort to combating the Heartbleed\nOpenSSL vulnerability in 2014. These efforts resulted in the\nrelease of several advisories, briefings, and two webinars\non the topic. The advisories listed vendors and products\nreported to be vulnerable and announced vendor patches as\nsoon as they became available. The advisories also included\nmethods for asset owners to determine whether they were\nrunning vulnerable products. To defend against exploitation,\nSnort signatures and other signatures suggested by the FBI\nwere provided to asset owners for use in determining if\nthey were actively being exploited. ICS-CERT’s first webinar\non the Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability was aimed at a\nmore limited audience of vendors and some asset owners.\nThe second webinar was open to a wider audience. Each\nwebinar featured an explanation of Heartbleed from the\noriginal researchers who discovered the vulnerability.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\nThe Advanced Analytical Laboratory (AAL) provides research\nand analysis capabilities in support of the incident response,\nassessment, and vulnerability coordination activities of\nICS-CERT. The AAL’s expert cybersecurity researchers perform\nforensic analysis on digital media, reverse engineer malware,\nand respond to cyber incidents with both onsite and remote\ncapacity. When possible, analytical efforts are performed\nremotely in a laboratory environment using custom tools and\ntechniques. In some cases, however, onsite analysis is required\nand a team is deployed to perform analytical efforts directly on\nthe owner’s network. In 2014, the AAL focused on automating\nand streamlining the lab’s analytical capabilities. Improvements\nfor the year included the following:\n\n - Completion of a remote incident response network\n(RIRN). The RIRN allows analysts to remotely and\nsecurely perform an incident response engagement with\nan asset owner. After an initial equipment installation,\nAAL analysts can remotely sweep the asset owner’s\nnetwork for indications of compromise. This allows\nanalysts to spend multiple weeks on an engagement\nand provides a thorough, in-depth examination of the\ncompany’s network.\n\n\n\n - Automation and integration of forensic analysis tools in a\nsuite called the Analyst Network Tool (ANT). ANT brings\ntogether custom and commercial forensic tools in an\nintegrated environment, allowing multiple drive images\nto be processed simultaneously, reducing the amount\nof analyst hands-on time. ANT has greatly reduced the\nturnaround time for digital forensic analysis, providing\nfaster results to companies responding to a compromise.\n\n - Development of a custom application, called the\nCorrelating Extensive Incident Response (CEIR) tool, to\nanalyze data collected during an incident response. The\nCEIR tool allows the user to consolidate the many types\nof data collected into a single, user-friendly database and\nhelps identify known and unknown threats. The AAL\nuses the CEIR tool in both onsite and remote incident\nresponse engagements.\n\nWith these improved analytical capabilities, the AAL performed\nin-depth analysis of numerous malware samples associated with\nmultiple watering hole and ICS-focused threat campaigns. These\nefforts helped uncover sophisticated threat actor techniques\nand tactics, which allowed ICS-CERT to publish multiple alerts\nwarning the community of the threat and providing information\nfor detecting and mitigating intrusion activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Assessments\n\nIn FY 2014, ICS-CERT conducted 104 onsite cybersecurity\nassessments. These assessments, which are based on standards,\nguidelines, and best practices, assist the Nation’s CI asset\nowners to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of their\nICSs. The assessment methodology provides a structured\nframework that asset owners and operators can use repeatedly\nto assess, re-assess, protect, detect, and continually validate the\ncybersecurity of their ICS networks.\n\nICS-CERT’s onsite cybersecurity assessment services include the\nfollowing assessment types:\n\n - Onsite guided Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET)\nAssessment\n\n - Design Architecture Review (DAR)\n\n - Network Architecture Verification and Validation\n(NAVV).\n\nCSET is a stand-alone software tool that enables users to\nassess their network and cybersecurity methodology against\nrecognized industry and government standards, guidelines,\nand best practices. ICS-CERT released two new versions of the\nCSET tool in 2014: CSET 6.0, released in February, included\nthe ability to trend, compare, and merge assessments; and\n\n\nCSET 6.1, released in August, included the NIST Framework,\nwhich allows asset owners to create their own question sets\nand provides industry organizations the ability to collaborate in\ncreating and sharing question sets.\n\nThe DAR assessment provides ICS asset owners with a\ncomprehensive evaluation and discovery process, focusing\non defense strategies associated with an asset owner’s specific\ncontrol systems network. The DAR includes an in-depth\nreview and evaluation of the control system’s network\ndesign, configuration, interdependencies, and its applications.\nICS-CERT provides a detailed DAR report, and with expert\nguidance, positions the requesting facility’s ICS for improved\nsecurity and resiliency.\n\nThe NAVV assessment provides a sophisticated analysis of\nnetwork packet-data, which is collected by the asset owner\nfrom within their control system network environment.\nICS-CERT passively analyzes the data using a combination of\nopen source and commercially available tools, and develops\ndetailed representation of the communications flows and\nrelationships between devices. The NAVV also provides a\npractical method for asset owners to baseline the deterministic\nnetwork traffic occurring within the control systems\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n# Training\n\nTraining is a critical component of the ICS-CERT\nprogram. ICS-CERT performs outreach activities through\ntraining and education programs to help CI sectors and\nthe control systems community better understand the\ncybersecurity risks associated with ICSs. In 2014, the\nprogram adopted a blended learning approach to enhance\ntraining opportunities. A new course, Introduction to\nICS Cybersecurity, blends web-based and instructor-led\nmethods. The curriculum is made up of ten modules and is\navailable online at no cost.\n\nThe challenges solved by the blended learning approach\nare three-fold. First, trainees have asked for materials in a\nformat that is more efficient and easier to access. Web-based\ntraining allows trainees to access the course on their own\ntime in a setting that allows for asynchronous interaction,\nand it is self-paced to better fit trainees’ work schedules.\n\n\nThe second challenge was to reduce redundancy in the\ntraining materials. As the ICS-CERT Cybersecurity Training\nProgram has matured and developed new course materials\nto support its growth, the courses were designed to build\non each other. Ideally, a trainee would complete the\nIntroduction to ICS Cybersecurity course, followed by\nIntermediate Level courses, and eventually complete the\n5-day, hands-on Technical Level ICS Cybersecurity Training.\nThese courses have no prerequisites for enrolling and\ninclude a test-out option. As a result, trainees can begin\ncourses at the level appropriate to their cybersecurity\nexperience and knowledge with the confidence that they\nare prepared for the more technical course work. To further\nstreamline the online training process and eliminate\nredundancy, ICS-CERT has removed remedial material from\nthe more technical courses.\n\nThe third challenge for some people is the travel required\nto participate in training. Web-based courses alleviate the\ntime, cost, and inconvenience of traveling to attend multiple\nin-person sessions.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to blending methods and creating web-based\nmodules, the program employs a learning management\nsystem (LMS). The LMS is a software application for the\nadministration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and\ndelivery of training courses. The benefits of this service are\nas follows:\n\n - Creates a unique user ID and provides credit for course\ncompletion.\n\n - Provides training courses using varied multimedia\napproaches (video, audio, PowerPoint, Flash).\n\n - Facilitates interoperability between eLearning software\nproducts through compliance with Sharable Content\nObject Reference Model (SCORM) web-based training\ncourses.\n\n - Enables live training events, training invitations, selfregistration, and attendance tracking.\n\n - Assists in tracking, analyzing, and reporting course\nstatistics.\n\n - Ensures course availability on desktop or mobile device\n(iPads, iPhones, or Android devices).\n\n\nOver 4,760 trainees have initiated online training and have\naccessed the courses from multiple states and countries.\n\nAdditional ICS-CERT Training highlights for 2014 include\nthe following:\n\n - Initiated online introductory and intermediate courses\nin 10 modules.\n\n - Resumed quarterly regional training, which takes\nintroductory and intermediate classroom training\nto trainees in their own region. In 2014, regional\nclassroom training was held in Alabama and Houston.\nFive regional classroom training sessions are planned\nfor 2015.\n\n - Provided 11 technical-level cybersecurity training\nsessions to 436 participants. These 5-day courses\nprovide intensive hands-on training and a 12-hour,\nred team/blue team exercise that simulates a corporate\nespionage scenario.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group\n\n\nThe ICS-CERT established the Industrial Control Systems\nJoint Working Group (ICSJWG) to enhance collaboration\nbetween ICS stakeholders and facilitate partnerships\nbetween the Federal Government and private sector owners\nand operators in all CI sectors. The goal of the ICSJWG is\nto secure CI by accelerating the design, development, and\ndeployment of secure ICS.\n\n### 2014 Spring Meeting\nThe ICSJWG 2014 Spring Meeting was held in Indianapolis,\nIndiana, and was attended by approximately 220 people,\nincluding asset owners and operators, government\nprofessionals, vendors, systems integrators, and academic\nprofessionals from around the globe. Key highlights from\nthe meeting were an opening keynote presentation by\nIndiana Governor Mike Pence as well as two more keynote\n\n\npresentations from CS&C Deputy Assistant Secretary Gregory\nTouhill and NCCIC Director Larry Zelvin. Presentations also\nincluded demos and lightning round talks that offered the\nopportunity for attendees to discuss the latest initiatives\nimpacting the security of ICSs and the risk of threats and\nvulnerabilities to these systems.\n\n### 2014 Fall Meeting\nThe ICSJWG 2014 Fall Meeting was held in Idaho Falls,\nIdaho, hosting approximately 175 attendees from the\nworldwide community. This meeting included a classified\nbriefing and tours of the Idaho National Laboratory\nfacilities. Further highlights include keynote remarks by the\nDHS Assistant Secretary for CS&C, Dr. Andy Ozment. Because\nof the positive reception of demonstrations and lightning\nround talks in previous meetings, those venues were\nexpanded to allow more opportunity for participation.\n\n\n-----\n\n### The ICSJWG Steering Team\nThe ICSJWG Steering Team (IST) held its first face-to-face\nmeeting in Indianapolis and discussed a variety of topics,\nincluding ways to improve the ICSJWG bi-annual meetings\nand the overall working group moving forward. The IST\nis made up of members representing roles such as asset\nowners; vendors; state, local, and tribal governments;\nindustry associations; university/academia; consultants/\nintegrators; and the international community. By bringing\nthis diverse group together, the ICSJWG hopes to improve\nthe partnership between the public and private sectors in\nworking together to secure our Nation’s CI.\n\n### ICSJWG Webinars\nAnother outreach opportunity the ICSJWG has offered to\nthe community is a series of webinars that focus on specific\ntopics related to ICS cybersecurity. During FY 2014, ICSJWG\nwebinars covered various topics, including the following:\n\n\n\n - I Think, Therefore I Fuzz—demonstration explaining\nthe fuzzing process and how fuzzing can help users\nfind their systems’ vulnerabilities before attackers.\n\n - Online Real Time Monitoring for Change\nIdentification—introduction to the Sophia software\ntool that assists control system owners in learning how\ntheir systems communicate and quickly identify new\nand unexpected connections.\n\n - The New Paradigm for Information Security:\nAssumption of Breach—review and discussion of\nthe change from a defined perimeter defense to\nan assumption of breach of critical systems and\nsuggestions on how to respond.\n\nThe ICSJWG is looking forward to offering a flexible and\nresilient approach as well as a substantial platform for the\npublic and private sectors to collaborate on cybersecurity\nfor the global infrastructure in FY 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Moving Forward\n\nIn 2015, ICS-CERT will continue to improve cybersecurity\ncapabilities and extend services in support of all ICS\nstakeholders in the 16 CI sectors. ICS-CERT will continue\ncoordination efforts with industry and government partners\nto mitigate cyber risks to CI through timely and effective\nsharing of situational awareness information and mitigation\nstrategies.\n\nTo further improve onsite assessments, ICS-CERT will\npursue more one-on-one engagements with CI asset owners\non the use of CSET and assist them in identifying gaps and\ndeveloping strategies for improving their defensive posture.\nThe Assessment team’s SafeGuard Initiative will also further\naid asset owners in the Energy industry to assess critical\nassets for intrusion and security gaps.\n\nIn addition to extending onsite assessments, ICS-CERT\nwill develop and publish control system specific technical\nguidance related to recommended practices and defensive\n\n\nstrategies for protecting against ever-evolving threats. These\nguidance documents will send a clear message about what\nICS-CERT finds important and which threats are of greatest\nconcern.\n\nOther goals for 2015 include improving and expanding\nICS-CERT technical teams and tools, which will provide\ngreater value during incident response and assessment\nactivities. We will also continue to improve training\nofferings and expanded training curriculum, which will\nallow CI asset owners to better meet the demands of\nchallenging and evolving technical issues in control system\nsecurity.\n\nIt is uncertain what new cybersecurity threats will\nemerge in 2015, but ICS-CERT stands prepared to meet\nthe challenge and help CI asset owners prevent attacks or\nmitigate their harmful effects.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n# Sector Specific Onsite Support FY 2014\n\nThis table compares the overall sector support statistics for\nonsite assessments in Fiscal Years 2012, 2013, and 2014.\n\n**Sector** **FY 2012** **FY 2013** **FY 2014**\nChemical Sector 4 0 1\nCommercial Facilities Sector 2 0 2\nCommunications Sector 0 2 0\nCritical Manufacturing Sector 1 0 0\nDams Sector 0 0 0\nDefense Industrial Base Sector 12 1 0\nEmergency Services Sector 3 0 0\nEnergy Sector 7 18 43\nFinancial Services Sector 6 0 0\nFood and Agricultural Sector 0 0 0\nGovernment Facilities Sector 3 2 5\nHealthcare and Public Health Sector 1 5 0\nInformation Technology Sector 5 2 0\nNuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector 8 8 5\nTransportation Systems Sector 10 10 10\nWater and Wastewater Systems Sector 25 24 38\nTotals 87 72 104\nNumber of Sectors Assessed 13/16 9/16 7/16\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----",
