This activity, which we are\ntracking under the temporary group designator TAG-100, has employed open-source remote access\ncapabilities and exploited a wide range of internet-facing appliances for initial access. Using Recorded\nFuture® Network Intelligence data, Insikt Group identified the likely compromise of the secretariats of\ntwo major Asia-Pacific intergovernmental organizations by TAG-100 using the open-source,\nmulti-platform Go backdoor Pantegana. Other targeted organizations include multiple diplomatic\nentities and ministries of foreign affairs, as well as industry trade associations and semiconductor\nsupply-chain, non-profit, and religious organizations globally. At this time, Insikt Group is continuing to\nexplore potential attribution for this activity; however, the specific targeting and victimology identified\nalign with a suspected espionage motive.\n\n[This activity highlights the ability to combine weaponized proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits with](https://www.recordedfuture.com/2023-annual-report)\nopen-source post-exploitation frameworks such as Pantegana, lowering the entry barrier for less\ncapable threat actors. It also allows higher-tier groups to refrain from using customized tools during\noperations in which they are less concerned with being detected or in which heightened attribution\nobfuscation is desirable. More widely, threat actors’ exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing devices\nhas been the focus of international cybersecurity efforts, including [emergency](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/supplemental-direction-v1-ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure) patch requests within\n[the United States (US), the introduction of secure-by-design legislation](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/secure-by-design) by the United Kingdom (UK)\n[government, and attributing the use of this technique to multiple state-sponsored threat actors (1,](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a) [2,](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Dec/13/2003131586/-1/-1/0/CSA-APT5-CITRIXADC-V1.PDF) [3)](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-270a)\nDespite this attention, this form of initial access continues to be widely used, as these devices typically\nhave limited visibility, logging capabilities, and support for traditional security solutions. As a result, it\nexposes many organizations to the financial downsides of successful attacks, such as operational\ndowntime, reputational damage, and regulatory fines.\n\nOrganizations should employ intelligence-led patching prioritization of perimeter appliances that\nconsider the public availability of exploit code, as this availability can substantially increase the\n[likelihood of mass exploitation (1,](https://www.securityweek.com/poc-published-fortinet-vulnerability-mass-exploitation-attempts-begin/) [2,](https://www.securityweek.com/exploitation-of-palo-alto-firewall-vulnerability-picking-up-after-poc-release/) [3). Organizations should focus on regularly auditing internet-facing](https://www.securityweek.com/mass-exploitation-of-citrix-bleed-vulnerability-underway/)\nand perimeter appliances, reducing their attack surfaces by disabling interfaces or portals where not\nrequired, and improving defense-in-depth measures focusing on detecting post-exploitation\npersistence, discovery, and lateral movement. Unless the security of internet-facing devices is\n[improved or organizations take steps to move away from vulnerable edges, these devices will almost](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/products-on-your-perimeter)\n[certainly continue to be widely exploited by a range of threat actors.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/2023-annual-report)\n\nState-sponsored threat actors will likely continue using open-source capabilities to conduct\nhigher-tempo, deniable cyber operations with a lower risk of direct attribution or retaliation. The\nwidespread availability of open-source capabilities also allows state-sponsored threat actors to\noutsource select cyber operations to a broader range of less capable proxy groups or private\n\n1 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\ncontractors who may not possess or require in-house development skills due to the widespread\navailability of open-source tools. This outsourcing will likely act as a force multiplier to further increase\nthe intensity and tempo of overall activity targeting enterprise networks, a trend already apparent\nwithin some state-sponsored cyber-espionage programs.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - TAG-100 has likely compromised organizations in at least ten countries in Africa, Asia, North\nAmerica, South America, and Oceania and, following initial access, employed the open-source\nGo backdoors Pantegana and SparkRAT.\n\n  - TAG-100 has also conducted probable reconnaissance and exploitation activity targeting the\ninternet-facing appliances of additional organizations in at least fifteen countries in North\nAmerica, Europe, and Asia.\n\n  - Based on the identified TAG-100 targeted and victim hosts, it is likely that the group has\nexploited a range of internet-facing products, including Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway\nappliances, F5 BIG-IP, Zimbra Collaboration Suite, Microsoft Exchange, SonicWall, Cisco\nAdaptive Security Appliances (ASA), Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, and Fortinet FortiGate.\n\n  - [In the immediate aftermath of releasing a PoC exploit for Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect](https://labs.watchtowr.com/palo-alto-putting-the-protecc-in-globalprotect-cve-2024-3400/)\nfirewall vulnerability CVE-2024-3400, TAG-100 conducted probable reconnaissance and\nattempted exploitation against dozens of US-based organizations running these devices.\n\n  - The widespread targeting of internet-facing appliances is particularly attractive because it offers\na foothold within the targeted network via products that often have limited visibility, logging\ncapabilities, and support for traditional security solutions, reducing the risk of detection\npost-exploitation.\n\n2 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Intergovernmental organizations headquartered in Southeast Asia and Oceania\n\n  - Ministries of Foreign Affairs of countries in Southeast Asia, South America, and the Caribbean\n\n  - The Embassy of a Southwest Asian country in the United States\n\n  - Multiple religious organizations in the US and Taiwan\n\n  - A US-based financial industry trade association\n\n  - A Taiwanese semiconductor testing and assembly company\n\n3 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Overview of TAG-100 operations (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n\n4 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to employing publicly available exploits, TAG-100 has also used multiple open-source or\noffensive security post-exploitation frameworks targeting multiple operating systems, including\nPantegana, SparkRAT, LESLIELOADER, Cobalt Strike, and CrossC2.\n\n##### Pantegana\n\nPantegana is an open-source malware family written in Go that features a cross-platform payload client\n(Windows, Linux, OSX) and uses HTTPS for C2 communications. It supports file upload and download,\nsystem fingerprinting, and direct command-line interaction with infected hosts. Pantegana also\nsupports obfuscation using the open-source obfuscator [Garble. Publicly reported use of Pantegana in](https://github.com/burrowers/garble)\nthe wild to date is minimal, other than a campaign exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the Sophos\n[Firewall appliance attributed by Volexity](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/06/15/driftingcloud-zero-day-sophos-firewall-exploitation-and-an-insidious-breach/) to the suspected Chinese state-sponsored threat activity\ngroup DriftingCloud.\n\nIn March 2024, Insikt Group identified a cluster of TAG-100 C2 servers, all exhibiting the same\nself-signed transport layer security (TLS) certificate (see Appendix C), which aligns with the default\nissuer and distinguished names seen in the Pantegana source code. On some TAG-100 Pantegana\nservers, the group also employed a customized TLS certificate, which used the organization name\n```\nGoogle, Inc. rather than the default Pantegana value.\n\n```\nAll identified TAG-100 servers were running identical services and were administered via the same\nnodes associated with the commercial VPN service ExpressVPN. Several victim organizations have\nbeen observed communicating with multiple TAG-100 Pantegana C2 servers over time, likely because\nthe threat actor transitioned between an older C2 server and a newer one.\n\n##### SparkRAT and LESLIELOADER\n\nMultiple TAG-100 servers were concurrently linked to malware samples of another open-source Go\n[backdoor, SparkRAT. TAG-100 also used a variant of the publicly available](https://github.com/HZzz2/go-shellcode-loader) Go loader LESLIELOADER to\nload SparkRAT in several instances, including a chain previously documented in March 2024 Kroll\n[research. On one occasion, we also observed a SparkRAT memory dump uploaded to a public malware](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/leslieloader-undocumented-loader-observed?)\nrepository that almost certainly originated from a Djibouti government network compromised by\nTAG-100.\n\nIn addition to communicating with a C2 IP address serving a specific Pantegana TLS certificate linked to\nTAG-100, the Linux SparkRAT sample Sync shown in Table 1 was also identified being staged on a\n\n5 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\npreviously referenced TAG-100 open directory on the IP address 209.141.57[.]75 between November\n2023 and April 2024.\n\n|SHA256 Hash|Filename|C2 IP Address|\n|---|---|---|\n|23efecc03506a9428175546a4b7d40c8a943c 252110e83dec132c6a5db8c4dd6|Sync|216.238.68[.]36|\n|ec45da0ca70a9b71652cc95d51665f7ad5682 94bd5652c395a119bccd613e9b4|Ntmssvc.dll|209.141.50[.]215|\n|b8cab11421eb4731c16cf3c34ca2b3f2a758d 5e112f877b90a18b3e146c8add0|RemovableStorage.dll|209.141.50[.]215|\n\n|SHA256 Hash|Filename|C2 Domain|\n|---|---|---|\n|e3aab908800cb4601bc4a87ac9ac48d816ced57c db409b6e2468956cc50bdf04|test|www.megtech[.]xyz|\n|8eb3617768ce4693b726bb8187e5cccea3359de0 196d6f2bbe555c31f12d1234|svhost.exe|www.megtech[.]xyz|\n\n\n**Table 2: TAG-100 Cobalt Strike samples (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n\n## Considering TAG-100 Attribution\n\n\nWhile Insikt Group cannot attribute TAG-100 activity based on current evidence, the group’s consistent\ntargeting of intergovernmental, diplomatic, and religious organizations aligns with a suspected\nespionage motive. Additionally, several targets of this activity align with historical targeting from\nChinese state-sponsored groups, including Asia-Pacific intergovernmental and diplomatic entities,\nreligious organizations in the United States and Taiwan, and a political party that has supported an\ninvestigation into the treatment of the Uyghur people by the Chinese government. Despite this,\nTAG-100’s use of open-source tooling coupled with the group’s pattern of life, targeting, and broader\n\n6 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) provide some conflicting evidence, leading us to continue\ninvestigating potential attribution for this activity.\n\n7 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigations\n\n\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any\nnetwork defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking\nconnection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains linked in **[Appendix A.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--GvQJGOmLukMTOSgK2MFjCJx69W9Mvt86gPcRM6tTY/edit#heading=h.bpfqilqj42nw)**\n\n  - Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities are in place for all external-facing services\nand devices. Monitor for follow-on activity likely to occur following exploitation of these\nexternal-facing services, such as the deployment of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells, as\nwell as subsequent lateral movement to internal networks.\n\n  - Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and\nthose exploited in the wild as determined through the Recorded Future® Vulnerability\nIntelligence module. Regarding Chinese state-sponsored groups, pay particular attention to\nremote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in external-facing appliances within your\nenvironment.\n\n  - Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information;\nconsider implementing multi-factor authentication and extremely restricted access and storage\non systems only accessible via an internal network.\n\n  - Detect and block malicious infrastructure such as Pantegana, SparkRAT, and Cobalt Strike C2\nservers in real-time via the [Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence module.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\n\n  - [Recorded Future® Third-Party Intelligence module users can monitor real-time output to identify](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\nsuspected targeted intrusion activity involving key vendors and partners within physical,\nnetwork, and software supply chains.\n\n  - By monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA), Recorded Future clients can alert on and\nproactively monitor infrastructure involved in notable communication to known TAG-100 C2 IP\naddresses.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe identified TAG-100 activity focused on targeting a variety of internet-facing appliances for initial\naccess and, subsequently, used open-source capabilities post-exploitation. The group has been\nparticularly interested in targeting government and intergovernmental organizations in Southeast Asia,\nEurope, and North America. This activity further highlights an established trend of threat actors\npersistently targeting internet-facing appliances for initial access. These appliances are particularly\nattractive because they offer a foothold within the targeted network via products that often have\nlimited visibility, logging capabilities, and support for traditional security solutions, reducing the risk of\ndetection during post-exploitation activity. The prevalence of this activity has motivated both the US\n[and UK governments to issue parallel efforts](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/products-on-your-perimeter) to improve security in enterprise software and devices.\nHowever, it will likely take time before the effects of this top-down approach are fully realized. In the\nmeantime, vulnerable network edges will almost certainly continue to be heavily exploited by financially\nmotivated and state-sponsored threat actors as long as organizations deploy them.\n\n8 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n9 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B — MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\n|Appendix B — MITRE ATT&CK Techniques|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tactic: Technique|ATT&CK Code|\n|Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server|T1583.003|\n|Reconnaissance: Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning|T1595.002|\n|Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application|T1190|\n|Defense Evasion: Process Injection|T1055|\n|Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information: Embedded Payloads|T1027.009|\n|Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information: Encrypted/Encoded File|T1027.013|\n|Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols|T1071|\n|Command and Control: Web Service: Bidirectional Communication|T1102.002|\n\n\n10 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix C — Self-Signed Pantegana TLS Certificate Observed on TAG-100 Infrastructure\n```\n Version: 3 (0x02)\n Serial number: 70601002879283499457779830637471069067165741229\n Algorithm ID: SHA256withRSA\n Validity\n  Not Before: 24/10/2022 06:08:04\n  Not After: 21/10/2032 06:08:04\n Issuer\n  C = US\n  ST = Hawaii\n  L = The Sewers\n  O = Pantegana, Inc.\n  CN = Pantegana Root CA\n Subject\n  C = US\n  ST = Hawaii\n  L = The Sewers\n  O = Pantegana, Inc.\n  CN = localhost\n Public Key\n  Algorithm: RSA\n  Length: 2048 bits\n  Modulus: bf:66:12:ec:36:4d:54:62:f0:4b:c7:44:f2:8a:39:ca:\n           06:9a:7f:e0:dc:9a:c3:55:77:b4:4f:41:a2:ed:db:57:\n           a2:03:99:b4:8e:70:9c:07:88:d7:b2:cd:42:b6:88:15:\n           cb:0b:70:26:90:5b:18:17:a8:4d:a7:7a:a0:0f:f9:71:\n           bb:4f:1f:21:ac:41:a4:2b:b5:1d:12:f8:32:46:56:2c:\n           d9:11:09:f3:ac:39:75:aa:39:1d:37:b3:88:72:c6:c1:\n           e9:06:3d:ae:d4:c5:9d:30:54:cb:4d:2d:86:b6:7a:9f:\n           9c:03:90:5d:24:d9:36:e2:40:b9:f0:7e:08:8b:c6:81:\n           e8:6c:76:cd:f4:2e:95:10:11:ad:3b:7d:72:7c:01:a7:\n           cb:85:39:40:25:cb:0a:c8:b4:5a:46:e6:23:99:9c:64:\n           ee:1d:2c:0b:64:a7:ef:75:dd:37:96:e0:34:9f:54:28:\n           9f:6e:cc:6c:48:0f:74:6f:c8:11:26:3b:95:23:bb:e4:\n           6f:df:8b:86:38:c9:7e:79:e5:fc:f2:4a:01:30:68:e0:\n           12:de:af:3b:3d:19:bc:b4:e0:88:52:97:4a:70:62:4c:\n           93:31:fa:5b:5f:a2:46:b4:2b:ec:a0:c2:19:d4:29:70:\n           0d:d6:1f:31:28:79:6f:24:26:83:66:dd:d7:51:a0:2d\n  Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n Certificate Signature\n  Algorithm: SHA256withRSA\n  Signature: ad:8f:be:9c:32:9f:da:6c:ab:8f:48:93:50:c6:47:84:\n           33:c1:ec:63:97:28:1a:f4:b6:ad:02:a1:8e:94:bd:82:\n           66:0b:45:b1:19:f1:2a:36:35:96:44:2a:ec:e9:29:76:\n           f4:b1:2d:e8:cd:e6:fd:32:40:6a:ab:6a:ee:07:84:a6:\n           5f:4a:20:66:8c:8b:df:f1:b5:a0:ae:d9:86:e1:ea:01:\n           58:e0:91:63:77:4d:d9:b1:3c:e2:3d:5a:2d:25:2c:80:\n           c6:db:1b:42:f7:3a:d3:2e:56:fc:13:fe:33:cc:2e:57:\n\n```\n11 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n12 CTA-2024-0716 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future reporting contains expressions of likelihood or probability consistent\n[with US Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203: Analytic Standards (published](https://irp.fas.org/dni/icd/icd-203.pdf)\nJanuary 2, 2015).
