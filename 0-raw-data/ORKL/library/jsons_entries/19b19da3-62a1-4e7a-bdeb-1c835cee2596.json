It is confirmed that this attack group uses\nmultiple types of malware including BLINDINGCAN, which CISA recently introduced in its\nreport [1].\n\nThis article summarises the result of our analysis on BLINDINGCAN.\n\n### BLINDINGCAN overview\n\nThe malware runs when a loader loads a DLL file. Figure 1 shows the flow of events until\nBLINDINGCAN runs. JPCERT/CC has confirmed that the DLL file is encoded in some\nsamples (which requires decoding by the loader before execution).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1:\n\nBLINDINGCAN behaviour\n[BLINDINGCAN shares some features with the aforementioned malware including its function](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/08/Lazarus-malware.html)\nand communication encoding algorithm. The following sections will explain its configuration\nand communication protocol.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe configuration of BLINDINGCAN(size: 0xA84) is stored in one of the following locations:\n\nHardcoded in the malware itself\nStored in a registry entry\nSaved as a file\n\nIn case it is saved as a file, it is stored in the same folder where BLINDINGCAN is located.\nWe have confirmed that the following directory is used if the configuration is stored in a\nregistry entry.\n```\nKey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\nValue: \"SM_Dev16[numeric string]\"\n\n```\nThe configuration is encrypted using either XOR encoding, AES or RC4. The encryption key\nis either fixed or generated based on the environment of the infected device. JPCERT/CC\nhas confirmed the following patterns of encryption keys:\n\n[File name][Export function name][Service name]\n\n[CPUID][Computer name][Processor name][Physical memory size]\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of decoded configuration. This includes proxy information as well\nas C&C server information. (Please see Appendix A for details.)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2:\n\nConfiguration example\n\n### Obfuscation\n\nSome part of code in BLINDINGCAN is obfuscated using RC4. Figure 3 is an example of\nobfuscated code. The RC4 encryption key is hardcoded in the sample itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Obfuscation\n\n### Communication with C&C server\n\nBelow is an example HTTP POST request data that BLINDINGCAN sends in the beginning.\n```\nPOST /[PATH] HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAccept: */*\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) Chrome/28.0.1500.95 Safari/537.36\nHost: [Server]\nContent-Length: [Length]\nid=d3Ztd3lod2t0Tqf42ux9uv3FGH+Y3oAc2w==&bbs=HA==&tbl=hzE4dlKcRq3gokgAGeMQug==\n&bbs_form=4GQAAA==\n\n```\nThe format of the data is as follows. (All the values except for the RC4 key is RC4-encrypted\nand Base64-encoded.) The param2 in the first HTTP POST request is the encoded value of\na string \"T1B7D95256A2001E\".\n```\nid=[RC4 key][param1:param2:param3]&[param1]=[Random value (between 1000 and 10000)]&\n[param2]=[\"T1B7D95256A2001E\"]&[param3]=[Random binary data]\n\n```\nThe parameters in the POST data (param1, param2, param3) are randomly selected from\nthe below:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nboardid,bbsNo,strBoardID,userid,bbs,filename,code,pid,seqNo,ReportID,v,PageNumber,num,\n\n```\nThe RC4 encryption used here is different from the regular one. It has a process to shift the\nkey stream for C00h times. The following is the RC4 encryption process written in Python. It\ndoes not apply to param3, which uses the regular RC4.\n```\ndef custom_rc4(data, key):\n  x = 0\n  box = list(range(256))\n  for i in range(256):\n    x = (x + int(box[i]) + int(key[i % len(key)])) % 256\n    box[i], box[x] = box[x], box[i]\n  x = 0\n  for i in range(0xC00):\n    i = i + 1\n    x = (x + int(box[i % 256])) % 256\n    wow_x = x\n    box[i % 256], box[x] = box[x], box[i % 256]\n    wow_y = i % 256\n  x = wow_y\n  y = wow_x\n  out = []\n  for char in data:\n    x = (x + 1) % 256\n    y = (y + box[x]) % 256\n    box[x], box[y] = box[y], box[x]\n    out.append(chr(char ^ box[(box[x] + box[y]) % 256]))\n  return ''.join(out)\n\n```\nFigure 4 is the flow of communication from the beginning of its communication with a C&C\nserver until receiving commands.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4:\n\nBLINDINGCAN communication flow\nIf a Base64-encoded value of param3 ([Random binary data] in Figure 4) is received from\nthe server as a response to the first request, the malware sends another request.\nThe next data is sent with empty param2 and a command request (Command request\n(0x2040) in Figure 4) in param3. (Please see Appendix B for the details of param3 format.)\nThe data in param3 is XOR-encoded, RC4-encrypted and then Base64-encoded.\nAfter that BLINDINGCAN receives a command from a C&C server. (The format of the\nresponse data is the same as param3. Please see Appendix B). The response data is also\nXOR-encoded, RC4-encrypted and Base64-encoded. The only difference is that the \"+\" sign\nis replaced by a space.\n\n### Commands\n\nBLINDINGCAN performs multiple functions including the following. (Please see Appendix C\nfor details.)\n\nOperation on files (create a list, delete, move, modify timestamp, copy)\nOperation on processes (create a list, execute, kill)\nUpload/download files\nObtain disk information\nObtain a list of services\nExecute arbitrary shell command\n\n### In closing\n\nWe have introduced two kinds of malware used by Lazarus so far. However, they are known\nto use other types of malware as well. We will provide an update if we observe any new kind\nof malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C&C server information of the samples mentioned in the article are listed in Appendix D.\nPlease make sure that none of your device is communicating with these hosts.\n\nShusei Tomonaga\n(Translated by Yukako Uchida)\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] CISA: Malware Analysis Report (AR20-232A)\n\n[https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-232a](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-232a)\n\n**Appendix A: Configuration**\n\nTable A: List of configurations\n\nOffset Description Remarks\n\n0x000 Number of C&C servers Up to 5\n\n0x004 C&C server 1\n\n0x108 C&C server 2\n\n0x20C C&C server 3\n\n0x310 C&C server 4\n\n0x414 C&C server 5\n\n0x518 Flag for proxy\n\n0x51C Proxy IP address\n\n0x520 Proxy port number\n\n0x522 Flag for C&C reply\n\n0x526 Flag for drive information\n\n0x52A Flag for session information\n\n0x52E Save configuration\n\n0x532 Communication interval\n\n0x534 Start time\n\n0x53C seed Used when generating random data to send\n\n0x59C File name File obtained by the command \"0x2039\"\n\n\n-----\n\n0x5FC Unknown\n\n0x65C Unknown\n\n0x660 Not assigned\n\n0x674 Execute process name Contains \"c:¥windows¥system32¥cmd.exe\"\n\n0x87C Temp folder Command execution result is stored\n\n**Appendix B: Contents of data exchanged**\n\nTable B: Data format of param3 and response data\n\nOffset Length Contents\n\n0x00 2 Not assigned\n\n0x02 2 Command\n\n0x04 4 Not assigned\n\n0x08 4 Parameter length\n\n0x0C - Parameter (Base64 + RC4)\n\n**Appendix C: Commands**\n\nTable C: List of commands\n\nValue Contents\n\n0x2009 Get system information\n\n0x2010 Get drive information\n\n0x2011 Get directory list\n\n0x2012 Execute command (Regular output)\n\n0x2013 Upload file (compressed in zlib)\n\n0x2014 Download file\n\n0x2015 Execute process\n\n0x2016 Execute process (CreateProcessAsUser)\n\n0x2019 Get process list\n\n\n-----\n\n0x2020 Kill process\n\n0x2021 Delete file (sdelete)\n\n0x2022 Check connection\n\n0x2023 Change current directory\n\n0x2027 Modify file creation time\n\n0x2028 Change communication interval with C&C server\n\n0x2029 End session with C&C server\n\n0x2030 Uninstall\n\n0x2031 Get configuration\n\n0x2032 Overwrite configuration\n\n0x2033 Get directory information\n\n0x2034 Get drive available space\n\n0x2037 \n0x2038 Sleep\n\n0x2039 Get file name\n\n0x2046 Write file\n\n0x2048 Copy file\n\n0x2049 Move file\n\n0x2050 Delete file\n\n**Appendix D: C&C server**\n\nhttps://www.automercado.co.cr/empleo/css/main.jsp\nhttps://www.curiofirenze.com/include/inc-site.asp\nhttps://www.ne-ba.org/files/news/thumbs/thumbs.asp\nhttps://www.sanlorenzoyacht.com/newsl/include/inc-map.asp\n\n**Appendix E: Sample hash value**\n\n8db272ea1100996a8a0ed0da304610964dc8ca576aa114391d1be9d4c5dab02e\n58027c80c6502327863ddca28c31d352e5707f5903340b9e6ccc0997fcb9631d\n\n\n-----\n\n[Email](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:?subject=BLINDINGCAN%20-%20Malware%20Used%20by%20Lazarus%20-&body=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.jpcert.or.jp%2Fen%2F2020%2F09%2FBLINDINGCAN.html)\n\nAuthor\n\n朝長 [秀誠 (Shusei Tomonaga)](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/shu_tom/)\n\nSince December 2012, he has been engaged in malware analysis and forensics\ninvestigation, and is especially involved in analyzing incidents of targeted attacks.
