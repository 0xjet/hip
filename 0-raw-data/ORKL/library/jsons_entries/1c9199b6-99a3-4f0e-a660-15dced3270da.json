According to the researcher’s observations, AsyncRAT, NetWire,\nWSH RAT, and Parallax appears to be the group’s top favorites being pushed most often in\nmalicious messages.\n\nsource: [Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/charting-ta2541s-flight)\nProofpoint highlights that all malware used in TA2541 campaigns can be used to collect\ninformation, but the threat actor’s ultimate goal remains unknown at the moment.\n\nA typical TA2541 attack chain starts with sending an email that is usually related to\ntransportation (e.g. flight, aircraft, fuel, yacht, charter, cargo) and delivers a malicious\ndocument.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn recent campaigns, Proofpoint observed this group using Google Drive URLs in emails\nthat lead to an obfuscated Visual Basic Script (VBS) file. If executed, PowerShell pulls an\nexecutable from a text file hosted on various platforms such as Pastetext, Sharetext,\n[and GitHub” - Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/charting-ta2541s-flight)\n\nIn the next step, the adversary executes PowerShell into various Windows processes and\nlooks for available security products by querying the Windows Management Instrumentation\n(WMI).\n\nThen it tries to disable the built-in defenses and starts gathering system information before\ndownloading the RAT payload on the compromised host.\n\nsource: [Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/charting-ta2541s-flight)\nGiven TA2541’s choice of targets, its activity has not gone unnoticed and security\n[researchers from other companies have analyzed its campaigns [1,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/dissecting-netwire-phishing-campaigns-usage-process-hollowing) [2,](https://blog.morphisec.com/revealing-the-snip3-crypter-a-highly-evasive-rat-loader) [3] in the past, but](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1392219299696152578)\nwithout connecting all the dots.\n\n[Cisco Talos published a report last year about a TA2541 campaign targeting the aviation](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/operation-layover-how-we-tracked-attack.html)\nindustry with AsyncRAT. The researchers concluded that the actor had been active for at\nleast five years.\n\nBased on evidence from analyzing the infrastructure used in the attack, Cisco Talos was\nable to build a profile for the threat actor, linking its geographic location to Nigeria.\n\n“While researching the actor's activities, using passive DNS telemetry, we compiled the list\nof IPs used by the domain akconsult.linkpc.net. The chart below shows that roughly 73\npercent of the IPs were based in Nigeria, further strengthening the theory that the actor in\n[question is based in Nigeria.” - Cisco Talos](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/operation-layover-how-we-tracked-attack.html)\n\nIn a single campaign, the actor can send up to several thousand emails to dozens of\norganizations and are not tailored for individuals with specific roles. This shows that TA2541\nis not concerned with the stealth of its actions, further supporting the theory of a non-skilled\nactor.\n\nWhile thousands of organizations have been targeted in these “spray-and-pray” attacks,\ncompanies across the globe in the aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing, and\ndefense industries appear to be a constant target.\n\n\n-----\n\nEven if TA2541 s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) describe an adversary that is\nnot technically sophisticated, the actor managed to deploy malicious campaigns for more\nthan five years without raising too many flags.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Ukraine supporters in Germany targeted with PowerShell RAT malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-supporters-in-germany-targeted-with-powershell-rat-malware/)\n\n[New stealthy Nerbian RAT malware spotted in ongoing attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-stealthy-nerbian-rat-malware-spotted-in-ongoing-attacks/)\n\n[New NetDooka malware spreads via poisoned search results](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-netdooka-malware-spreads-via-poisoned-search-results/)\n\n[Hackers use modified MFA tool against Indian govt employees](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-modified-mfa-tool-against-indian-govt-employees/)\n\n[Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phishing/)\n[RAT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/rat/)\n[Remote Access Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/remote-access-trojan/)\n[TA2541](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ta2541/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.

Although\nmuch more of a chore there was some benefit to having to posses a certain amount of\nskill when accessing the internet of the 90's. Not that it didn't contain it's own dark\nholes.\n\nPost a Comment [Community Rules](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/posting-guidelines/)\n\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\n\n[Not a member yet?
