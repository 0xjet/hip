This AES\nencryption key will then be encrypted by an RSA-2048 public key that is embedded in the\nransomware executable.\n\nThis encrypted AES key will then be added to the contents of each encrypted file and can\nonly be decrypted by the RSA private key known to the ransomware developers.\n\nFor each encrypted file, Nefilim will append the .NEFILIM extension to the file name. For\nexample, a file called 1.doc would be encrypted and named 1.doc.NEFILIM.\n\n**Files encrypted by the Nefilim Ransomware**\nIn addition to the encrypted AES key, the ransomware will also add the \"NEFILIM\" string as a\nfile marker to all encrypted files as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**NEFILIM file marker**\n\nWhen done, a ransom note named NEFILIM-DECRYPT.txt will be created throughout the\nsystem that contains instructions on how to contact the ransomware developers.\n\nThis ransom note contains different contact emails and the threat that they will leak data if a\nransom is not paid within seven days of the \"breach\".\n\nCaption\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, a brief analysis by Gillespie indicates that this ransomware appears to be\nsecure, which means that there is no current way to recover files for free.\n\nThe ransomware, though, is still being researched and if new weaknesses we will publish\nupdated information.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Ransom payment is roughly 15% of the total cost of ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransom-payment-is-roughly-15-percent-of-the-total-cost-of-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Karakurt revealed as data extortion arm of Conti cybercrime syndicate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/karakurt-revealed-as-data-extortion-arm-of-conti-cybercrime-syndicate/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Hashes:\n```\n5ab834f599c6ad35fcd0a168d93c52c399c6de7d1c20f33e25cb1fdb25aec9c6\n\n Associated files:\nNEFILIM-DECRYPT.txt\n\n Associated emails:\njamesgonzaleswork1972@protonmail.com\npretty_hardjob2881@mail.com\ndprworkjessiaeye1955@tutanota.com\n\n Ransom note text:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nAll of your files have been encrypted with military grade algorithms.\nWe ensure that the only way to retrieve your data is with our software.\nWe will make sure you retrieve your data swiftly and securely when our demands are\nmet.\nRestoration of your data requires a private key which only we possess.\nA large amount of your private files have been extracted and is kept in a secure\nlocation.\nIf you do not contact us in seven working days of the breach we will start leaking\nthe data.\nAfter you contact us we will provide you proof that your files have been extracted.\nTo confirm that our decryption software works email to us 2 files from random\ncomputers. \nYou will receive further instructions after you send us the test files.\njamesgonzaleswork1972@protonmail.com\npretty_hardjob2881@mail.com\ndprworkjessiaeye1955@tutanota.com\n\n```\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
