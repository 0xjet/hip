Sometimes, that is sufficient, but in the case of Kaspersky\nLab, we have higher standards. This is why our philosophy is that it’s important to analyze\nnot just the infection, but to answer three very important questions:\n\nWhat happens to the victim after they’re infected?\nWhat information is being stolen?\nWhy is “Red October” such a big deal compared to other campaigns like Aurora or\nNight Dragon?\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to our knowledge, never before in the history of ITSec has an cyber-espionage\noperation been analyzed in such deep detail, with a focus on the modules used for attack\nand data exfiltration. In most cases, the analysis is compromised by the lack of access to the\nvictim’s data; the researchers see only some of the modules and do not understand the full\npurpose of the attack or what was stolen.\n\nTo get around these hiccups, we set up several fake victims around the world and monitored\nhow the attackers handled them over the course of several months. This allowed us to\ncollect hundreds of attack modules and tools. In addition to these, we identified many other\nmodules used in other attacks, which allowed us to gain a unique insight into the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe research that we are publishing today is perhaps the biggest malware research paper\never. It is certainly the most complex malware research effort in the history of our company\nand we hope that it sets new standards for what anti-virus and anti-malware research means\ntoday.\n\nBecause of its size, we’ve split “part 2” in several pieces, to make reading easier:\n\n\n-----\n\n## First stage of attack\n\n1.
