The wiper is spread\nvia a custom worm that ESET calls HermeticWizard, they wrote.\n\nOrganizations can expect even more attacks and with greater frequency. “Information\nwarfare, which we refer to as cyberwarfare, is a major component of the Russian doctrine.\nThis explains why, whenever there is a conflict related to Russia, you should expect to see\nforce being applied on the cyber domain as well to create disorientation, lack of trust and\nfear,” said Mitiga co-founder and CEO Ariel Parnes, former head of the Cyber Department for\nthe Israeli Intelligence Service. “Russia has significant offensive cybersecurity capabilities,\nincluding institutional and criminal elements.”\n\nWhile “the increase in operations will result in smaller-scale impacts as targeting is rushed …\nfor those affected, it won’t be smaller,” said Parnes. “Companies should therefore be ready to\nincrease their ability to detect patch and remediate against an increase in zero-day\n\n\n-----\n\nvulnerabilities.\n\nBut deploying new defensive cybersecurity capabilities may not be enough to quickly or fully\nprotect organizations. “There is only so much you can do now to prevent a cyberattack in the\nimmediate future, particularly if you are targeted by Russia or a state-sponsored attacker,”\nsaid Parnes. “There is a good chance that your organization was already attacked, and they\nhave a backdoor to your network.”\n\nUnder Russia’s doctrine, it has already “conducted cyber operations for quite a while, silently\npreparing the access needed so they can choose which one to activate and when, by\ndeleting or encrypting data, conducting a distributed denial-of-service attack, or carrying out\nanother attack that will impact business operations,” said Parnes.\n\nOrganizations should strive to bolster resilience. “Increasingly, geopolitical events have\nglobal impact, highlighting the importance of focusing on resilience so that organizations are\nready, prepared to recover rapidly and resilient if they get caught up in a wave of statesponsored cyberattacks,” said Parnes.\n\nRecent Articles By Author\n\n[More from Teri Robinson](https://securityboulevard.com/author/teri-robinson/)\n\n[March 11, 2022](https://securityboulevard.com/2022/03/isaacwiper-followed-hermeticwiper-attack-on-ukraine-orgs/) [Teri Robinson](https://securityboulevard.com/author/teri-robinson/) [cyberattack,](https://securityboulevard.com/tag/cyberattack/) [HermeticWiper,](https://securityboulevard.com/tag/hermeticwiper/) [IsaacWiper,](https://securityboulevard.com/tag/isaacwiper/) [Russia,](https://securityboulevard.com/tag/russia/) [Ukraine](https://securityboulevard.com/tag/ukraine/)\nFeatured eBook\n\n**Teri Robinson**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the time she was 10 years old and her father gave her an electric typewriter for\nChristmas, Teri Robinson knew she wanted to be a writer. What she didn’t know is how the\npath from graduate school at LSU, where she earned a Masters degree in Journalism, would\nlead her on a decades-long journey from her native Louisiana to Washington, D.C. and\neventually to New York City where she established a thriving practice as a writer, editor,\ncontent specialist and consultant, covering cybersecurity, business and technology, finance,\nregulatory, policy and customer service, among other topics; contributed to a book on the first\nyear of motherhood; penned award-winning screenplays; and filmed a series of short\nmovies. Most recently, as the executive editor of SC Media, Teri helped transform a 30-yearold, well-respected brand into a digital powerhouse that delivers thought leadership, highimpact journalism and the most relevant, actionable information to an audience of\ncybersecurity professionals, policymakers and practitioners.\n\n[teri-robinson has 103 posts and counting.See all posts by teri-robinson](https://securityboulevard.com/author/teri-robinson/)\n\n\n-----",
