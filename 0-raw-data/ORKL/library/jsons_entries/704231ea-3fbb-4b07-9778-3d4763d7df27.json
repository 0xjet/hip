APT41 backdoors, old and new\n\n**[ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/higaisa-or-winnti-apt-41-backdoors-old-and-new/](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/higaisa-or-winnti-apt-41-backdoors-old-and-new/#id5-2)**\n\nPositive Technologies\n\nThe [PT Expert Security Center regularly spots emerging threats to information security, including both previously known and newly discovered](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/)\nmalware. During such monitoring in May 2020, we detected several samples of new malware that at first glance would seem to belong to the\n[Higaisa group. But detailed analysis pointed to the Winnti group (also known as APT41, per FireEye) of Chinese origin. Subsequent monitoring](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/shadowpad-new-activity-from-the-winnti-group/)\nled us to discover a number of new malware samples used by the group in recent attacks. These include various droppers, loaders, and\ninjectors; Crosswalk, ShadowPad, and PlugX backdoors; and samples of a previously undescribed backdoor that we have dubbed\nFunnySwitch. We can confidently state that some of these attacks were directed at a number of organizations in Russia and Hong Kong.\n\nIn this article, we will share the results of our investigation of these samples and related network infrastructure, as well as overlaps with\npreviously described attacks.\n\n## Contents\n\n 1. Higaisa shortcuts\n\nThe first attack dates to May 12, 2020. At the core of the attack is an archive named Project link and New copyright policy.rar\n(75cd8d24030a3160b1f49f1b46257f9d6639433214a10564d432b74cc8c4d020). The archive contains a bait PDF document (Zeplin Copyright\nPolicy.pdf) plus the folder All tort's projects - Web lnks with two shortcuts:\n\nConversations - iOS - Swipe Icons - Zeplin.lnk\nTokbox icon - Odds and Ends - iOS - Zeplin.lnk\n\n[The structure of malicious shortcuts resembles the sample 20200308-sitrep-48-covid-19.pdf.lnk spread by the Higaisa group in March 2020.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/covid-19-and-new-year-greetings-the-higaisa-group/)\n\nFigure 1. Comparing command lines in the covid-19 and Zeplin shortcuts\nThe mechanism for initial infection is fundamentally the same: trying to open either of the shortcuts leads to running a command that extracts a\nBase64-encoded CAB archive from the body of the LNK file, after which the archive is unpacked to a temporary folder. Further actions are\nperformed with the help of an extracted JS script\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Contents\n\nof script 34fDFkfSD32.js\nBut here is where the similarity with the sample described in our Higaisa report ends: instead, this script copies the payload to the folder\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads, achieves persistence by adding itself to the startup folder and adding a scheduler task, and runs the payload. The\nscript also sends the output of ipconfig in a POST request to http://zeplin.atwebpages[.]com/inter.php.\n\nThe command run by the shortcut also contains the opening of a URL file extracted from the archive. The name of the URL file and the target\naddress depend on which shortcut is opened:\n\nConversations - iOS - Swipe Icons - Zeplin.url goes to:\n\nhttps://app.zeplin.io/project/5b5741802f3131c3a63057a4/screen/5b589f697e44cee37e0e61df\n\nTokbox icon - Odds and Ends - iOS - Zeplin.url goes to:\n\nhttps://app.zeplin.io/project/5c161c03fde4d550a251e20a/screen/5cef98986801a41be35122bb.\n\nThis is the only difference between the two LNK files. In both cases, the target page is hosted on Zeplin, a legitimate service for collaboration\nbetween designers and developers, and requires logging in to view.\n\nThe payload consists of two files:\n\nsvchast.exe\n\nIt functions as a simple local shellcode loader. The shellcode read from a fixed path. Before starting, the loader checks the current year:\n2018, 2019, 2020, or 2021.\n\nFigure 3. Main function in\n\nsvchast.exe\n3t54dE3r.tmp\n\nThe shellcode containing the main payload is the Crosswalk backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nO ay 30, 0 0, a e a c ous a c e, C _Co e s a (d 999d bde96decdbb65 8 ca0986db98 3b ed e 8c3e 0006 bceba6d),\nwas detected. It had two shortcuts:\n\nCurriculum Vitae_WANG LEI_Hong Kong Polytechnic University.pdf.lnk\nInternational English Language Testing System certificate.pdf.lnk\n\nTheir structure fully matched that of the samples from May 12. In this case, the bait consisted of PDF documents with a CV and IELTS\ncertificate. Depending on which shortcut was opened, the output of ipconfig was sent to one of two addresses:\nhttp://goodhk.azurewebsites[.]net/inter.php or http://sixindent.epizy[.]com/inter.php.\n\nNote that all three intermediate C2 servers are on third-level domains on a free hosting service. When accessed in a browser, each displays a\ndifferent decoy page:\n\nFigure 4. Page at zeplin.atwebpages_com\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Page at goodhk.azurewebsites_net\n\nFigure 6.

Based on the similarity of the infection chains, researchers classify](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/return-higaisa-apt)\nthem as belonging to the Higaisa group.\n\nHowever, detailed analysis of the shellcode demonstrates that the samples actually belong to the Crosswalk malware family. Crosswalk\n[appeared no later than 2017 and was mentioned for the first time in a FireEye report on the activities of the APT41 (Winnti) group.](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/)\n\nFigure 7. From the FireEye\n\nreport Figure 8.\n\nFragment of shellcode from 3t54dE3r.tmp\nThe network infrastructure of the samples overlaps with previously known APT41 infrastructure: at the IP address of one of the C2 servers, we\nfind an SSL certificate with SHA-1 value of b8cff709950cfa86665363d9553532db9922265c, which is also found at IP address 67.229.97[.]229,\n[referenced in a 2018 CrowdStrike report. Going further, we can find domains from a Kaspersky report written in 2013.](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2019GlobalThreatReport.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Fragment of network infrastructure\nAll this leads us to conclude that these LNK file attacks were performed by Winnti (APT41), which \"borrowed\" this shortcut technique from\nHigaisa.\n\n### 1.2 Crosswalk\n\nCrosswalk is a modular backdoor implemented in shellcode. The main component connects to a C2 server, collects and sends system\ninformation, and contains functionality for installing and running up to 20 additional modules received from the server as shellcode.\n\nThe information collected by the module includes:\n\nOS uptime\nNetwork adapter IP addresses\nMAC address of one of the adapters\nOperating system version and whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit\nUsername\nComputer name\nName of running module\nPID\nShellcode version and whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit\n\n(The shellcode supports both 32 and 64 bits.) It has two-part version numbers; we found ones including 1.0, 1.10, 1.21, 1.22, 1.25, and 2.0.\n\n[For more detailed analysis of one version of Crosswalk, see the VMware CarbonBlack investigation. Based on version 1.25](https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/cb-threat-analysis-unit-technical-analysis-of-crosswalk/)\n(8e6945ae06dd849b9db0c2983bca82de1dddbf79afb371aa88da71c19c44c996), which was used in the attacks with LNK files, here we will\ndescribe the networking aspects of the malware in more detail.\n\nCrosswalk has broad capabilities for connecting to C2 servers. The network configuration for this particular sample is at the end of the\nshellcode and is XOR encrypted with a 16-byte key. The data structure is as follows:\n\nConfiguration size (4 bytes)\nKey (16 bytes)\nEncrypted configuration\n\nThe configuration, in turn, contains the following fields:\n\n0x0 heartbeat interval (in seconds)\n0x4 reconnect interval (in seconds)\n0x8 bitmask for days of the week when connections may be made\n0xC (inclusive) lower bound for time of day when connections may be made\n\n\n-----\n\n0 0 ( o c us e) uppe bou d o t e o day e co ect o s ay be ade\n0x14 proxy port\n0x18 proxy type\n0x1C proxy host\n0x9C proxy username\n0x11C proxy password\n0x19C number of C2 servers\n0x1A0 array of structures of C2 servers\n\nA C2 server structure consists of the following fields:\n\n0x0 connection type\n0x4 port\n0x8 whether DNS name resolution is necessary (yes/no)\n0xC length of hostname\n0x10 hostname\n\nBefore attempting to connect, the backdoor checks whether the current day of the week and time match those allowed in the configuration.\nThen, one after the other, it tries combinations of possible proxy servers (any indicated in the configuration plus system proxies) and C2\nservers until it connects successfully.\n\nThe communication protocol used between the backdoor and C2 server can be separated logically into two levels:\n\n1. Application-level protocol\n2. Transport-level protocol\n\nOn the application level, messages consist of the following fields:\n\nFakeTLS header consisting of 5 bytes:\n\nEntry type and protocol version (3 bytes). For the client these always equal 17 03 01; for the server, they have random values.\nData length, not including header (2 bytes)\nMessage contents:\n\nCommand ID (4 bytes, little-endian)\nCommand data size (4 bytes, little-endian)\nClient ID (36 bytes), generated based on the UUID when the backdoor starts operation\nCommand data\n\nThe first two client–server and server–client messages have command IDs 0x65 and 0x64, respectively. They contain the data that will then be\n[used to generate the client and server session keys. The key generation algorithm is detailed in a Zscaler report. For all subsequent](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/return-higaisa-apt)\nmessages, the content (not including the FakeTLS header) is transferred in the corresponding encrypted session key. AES-128 is the\nencryption algorithm used.\n\nThe transport-level protocol depends on the connection type indicated in the configuration. Four protocols are supported:\n\n1. Standard TCP connection\n\nApplication-level messages are sent unchanged as TCP segments.\n\n\n-----\n\nqu a e t to o g o g\nThe client creates two TCP connections. The first will be used to get packets from the server, and the second to send them.\n\nDuring the first connection, a GET request is sent to the C2 server. The server replies with headers with code 200 and Content-Length:\n524288000. The subsequent stream of application-level messages from the server to the client is sent as the body of an HTTP response.\n\nFigure 10. First HTTP\n\nconnection with C2\nAfter the correct response headers are received, the malware establishes a second connection to the same port, where a POST request\nis made. The header dCy is generated by the client based on the UUID and, it would seem, serves as the session ID that links the two\nconnections. After receipt of a response with code 200, subsequent messages from the client to the server are sent using separate\nPOST requests.\n\nFigure 11. Second HTTP\n\nconnection with C2\n3. Duplication of socket with TLS connection\n\nThe client establishes a TCP connection and sends an HTTPS request like the following one:\n```\n GET /msdn.cpp HTTP/1.1\n Connection: Keep-Alive\n User-Agent: WinHTTP/1.1\n Content-Length: 4294967295\n Host: 149.28.152[.]196\n\n```\nThe HTTPS connection is not used again. Subsequent messages are exchanged in the original TCP connection (without TLS\n**encryption). Subsequent communication between the client and server occurs via protocol 1, except for when, at the beginning of the**\nsession, the client sends two packets with the FakeTLS header, which starts with the sequence 17 03 01. The first packet always has\nlength 0. The second has length 0x3A, 0x3C, 0x3E, or 0x40 and contains random bytes. We were unable to determine the purpose of\nthese packets.\n\nFigure 12. Additional packets with FakeTLS header\n\n\n-----\n\nC [p otoco](https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp/blob/master/README.en.md)\nThis protocol can be implemented on top of any other protocol (including UDP) to ensure quick and reliable data transfer. The Crosswalk\nclient uses KCP on top of a TCP connection: KCP protocol data is added to application-level messages that are then sent as TCP\nsegments.\n\nFigure 13. Crosswalk message with KCP headers\n\n(highlighted in yellow)\n\nNote that in the Crosswalk samples we detected, none of the samples used the KCP protocol in practice. But the code contains a full-fledged\nimplementation of this protocol, which could be used in other attacks: the developers would simply need to set this connection type in the\nconfiguration.\n\nThe diversity of protocols and techniques would seem to protect the backdoor from network traffic inspection.\n\n## 2. Loaders and injectors\n\nInvestigation of network infrastructure and monitoring of new Crosswalk samples put us onto the scent of other malicious objects containing\nCrosswalk shellcode as their payload. We can categorize these objects into two groups: local shellcode loaders and injectors. Some of the\nsamples in both groups are also obfuscated with VMProtect.\n\n### 2.1 Injectors\n\nFigure 14. Code for injecting shellcode into a running\n\nprocess\nThe injectors contain typical code that obtains SeDebugPrivilege, finds the PID of the target process, and injects shellcode into it. Depending\non the sample, explorer.exe and winlogon.exe are the target processes.\n\nThe samples we found contain one of three payloads:\n\nCrosswalk\nMetasploit stager\nFunnySwitch (discussed later in this report)\n\nCrosswalk and FunnySwitch shellcode is located in the data sections \"as-is,\" while the samples with Metasploit show additional XOR\nencryption with the key \"jj1\".\n\n### 2.2 Local shellcode loaders\n\n\n-----\n\ne a u ct o o t e a a e s to e t act s e code a d u t a act e p ocess e a a e sa p es be o g to o e o t o catego es,\nbased on the source of shellcode that they use: in the original executable or in an external file in the same directory.\n\nMost of the loaders start by checking the current year, much like the samples from the LNK file attacks.\n\nFigure 15. Code of the loader's main\n\nfunction\nAfter the malware finds the API functions it needs, it decrypts the string Global\\0EluZTRM3Kye4Hv65IGfoaX9sSP7VA with the [ChaCha20](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539)\nalgorithm. In one older version, to prevent being run twice the loader creates a mutex with the name\nGlobal\\5hJ4YfUoyHlwVMnS1qZkd2tEmz7GPbB. But in recent samples, the decrypted string is not used in any way. Perhaps part of the code\nwas accidentally deleted during the development process.\n\nAnother artifact found in some samples is the unused string CSPELOADKISSYOU. Its purpose remains unclear.\n\nFigure 16. String \"CSPELOADKISSYOU\" in data section\n\nIn the self-contained loaders, the shellcode is located in a PE file overlay. The shellcode is stored in a curious way: data starts from 0x60 bytes\nof the header, followed by the (encrypted) shellcode. The data length is stored at offset –0x24 from the end of the executable. The header\nalways starts with the PL signature. The other header data is used for decryption: a 32-byte key is located at offset 0x28 and a 12-byte nonce\nfor the ChaCha20 algorithm is at offset 0x50.\n\nFigure 17. Handling of PL shellcode in the\n\nloader body (ChaCha20)\n\n\n-----\n\ne C aC a 0 p e e tat o s ot a ays p ese t so e o t e sa p es use c oso t C ypto t S 8 C C o e c ypt o e\ncan also find key information here in the structure of the PL shellcode: at offset 0x28, there are 32 bytes that are hashed with MD5 to obtain a\ncryptographic key.\n\nFigure 18. Handling of PL shellcode in the loader body (AES\n128)\nOlder loader versions use Cryptography API: Next Generation (BCrypt* functions) in an equivalent way. They use AES-128 in CFB mode as\nthe encryption algorithm.\n\nThe loaders that rely on external files have a similar code structure and one of two encryption types: ChaCha20 or AES-128-CBC. The file\nshould contain PL shellcode of the same format as in the self-contained loader. The name depends on the specific sample and is encrypted\nwith the algorithm used in it. It can contain a full file path (although we did not detect any such samples) or a relative path.\n\nFigure 19. Building the file name with PL shellcode\n\nAmong all the loaders, we encountered three different shellcode payloads:\n\nCrosswalk\nMetasploit stager\nCobalt Strike Beacon\n\n### 2.3 Attack examples\n\n**2.3.1 An encrypted resume**\n\nThis malicious file is a RAR archive, electronic_resume.pdf.rar\n(025e053e329f7e5e930cc5aa8492a76e6bc61d5769aa614ec66088943bf77596), with two files:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. Contents of\n\nelectronic_resume.pdf.rar\nThe first file might look like bait, but trying to open it in a PDF viewer gives an error, since it is practically a copy of the latter.\n\nThe file Электронный читатель резюме.exe (\"Electronic reader resume.exe\") is an executable self-contained loader for PL shellcode. It\ncontains Cobalt Strike Beacon as the payload.\n\nFigure\n\n21. Configuration of Cobalt Strike Beacon\nThe archive was distributed on approximately June 1, 2020, from the IP address 66.42.48[.]186 and was available at\nhxxp://66.42.48[.]186:65500/electronic_resume.pdf.rar. The same IP address was used as C2 server.\n\nThe modification time of the archive files, as well as the date on which the archive was found the server, point to the attack being active in late\nMay or early June. The Russian filenames suggest that the targets were Russian-speaking users.\n\n**2.3.2 I can't breathe**\n\nThe attack is practically identical to the previous one: malware is distributed in a RAR archive video.rar\n(fc5c9c93781fbbac25d185ec8f920170503ec1eddfc623d2285a05d05d5552dc) and consists of two .exe files. The archive is available on June\n1 on the same server at the address hxxp://66.42.48[.]186:65500/video.rar.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. Contents of video.rar\nThe executable files are self-contained loaders of Cobalt Strike Beacon PL shellcode with a similar configuration and the same C2 server.\n\nThe bait is notable for the topic: the hackers were attempting to exploit U.S. protests related to the death of George Floyd. The main bait was a\nvideo with the name \"I can't breathe-America's Black Death protests that the riots continue to escalate and ignite America!.mp4\" involving\nreporting on protests in late May, 2020. Judging by the logo, the source of the video was Australian portal XKb, which releases news materials\nin Chinese.\n\nFigure 23.\n\nStill frame from the bait video\n\n**2.3.3 Chat transcript**\n\nThe archive запись чата.7z (\"chat transcript.7z\") (e0b675302efc8c94e94b400a67bc627889bfdebb4f4dffdd68fdbc61d4cd03ae) contains three\nidentical executable files with names resembling \"запись чата-1.png____________________________________.exe\" (\"chat transcript1.png____________________________________.exe\") in attacks again targeting Russian-speaking users.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24. Contents of the\n\narchive, the name of which promises a \"chat transcript\"\nThe malicious files are self-contained PL shellcode loaders, but the payload here is Crosswalk version 2.0.\n\nIts configuration implies three ways to connect to the C2 server at 149.28.23[.]32:\n\nTransport protocol 3, port 8443\n\nTransport protocol 2, port 80\n\nTransport protocol 1, port 8080\n\nFigure 25. Fragment of the Crosswalk configuration\n\n## 3. Attacks on Russian game developers\n\nThe Winnti group first became famous for its attacks on computer game developers. Such attacks continue today, and Russian companies are\nalso among their targets.\n\n### 3.1 Unity3D Game Developer from St. Petersburg\n\nThe attack is based on the archive Resume.rar (4d3ad3ff281a144d9a0a8ae5680f13e201ce1a6ba70e53a74510f0e41ae6a9e6), which\ncontains just one file: CV.chm.\n\nRunning the file without security updates installed causes two windows to appear simultaneously: CHM help in HTML Help and a PDF\ndocument. They contain the same information: a curriculum vitae for the position of game developer or database manager at a St. Petersburg\ncompany.\n\nThe CV contains plausible contact information, with a St. Petersburg address, email address ending with \"@yandex.ru\", and phone number\nstarting with \"+7\" (Russia's country code). The only obviously fake aspect is the phone number: 123-45-67.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 26. Result of opening the CHM file\nThe PDF file opens due to the script pass.js, which is contained in the CHM file and referenced in the code of the HTML page.\n\nFigure 27.\n\nReference to pass.js in HTML code\nThe script uses [a technique for running an arbitrary command in a CHM file via an ActiveX object. This unpacks an HTML help file to the folder](https://twitter.com/ithurricanept/status/534993743196090368)\nC:\\Users\\Public for launching the next stage of the infection: the file resume.exe, which is also embedded inside the CHM file.\n\nFigure 28.\n\nDeobfuscated script pass.js\n\n\n-----\n\nesu e e e s a ad a ced s e code jecto o c e ad e cou te ed o y o e sa p e as o t e t g o t s a t c e e o e t gets\ndown to business, this malware, like many other samples we have seen from Winnti, checks the current year. Current processes are checked\nand the malware will not run if any of the following are active:\nollydbg.exe|ProcessHacker.exe|Fiddler.exe|windbg.exe|tcpview.exe|idaq.exe|idaq64.exe|tcpdump.exe|Wireshark.exe.\n\nOn first launch, shellcode will be taken from MyResume.pdf; on subsequent launches, winness.config is the shellcode source.\n\nFigure 29. Main function in\n\nresume.exe\nMyResume.pdf is unpacked from the CHM file. Data read by resume.exe has been added to the end of the PDF file. If the user opens it\ndirectly, a message warns that the document is password-protected.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 30.\n\nMyResume.pdf, as viewed in Adobe Acrobat Reader\nCompared to the PL shellcode, the data structure is more complex and contains the following:\n\nROR-13 hash of data starting from byte 0x24 (0x20, 4 bytes)\nNonce for algorithm ChaCha20 (0x24, 12 bytes)\nChaCha20-encrypted text (0x30):\n\nName of PDF file (+0x0)\nSize of PDF file (+0x20)\nSize of auxiliary shellcode (+0x24)\nSize of main shellcode (+0x28)\nConstant 0xE839E900 (+0x2C)\nPDF file\nAuxiliary shellcode\nMain shellcode\n\nOn first launch of resume.exe, the encrypted portion of the data is decrypted (the key is hard-coded in the executable) and three sections are\nextracted (PDF, auxiliary shellcode, and main shellcode). The PDF file is saved with a name resembling _797918755_true.pdf in a temporary\nfolder. It then opens for the user (the second window in the screenshot on Figure 26, next to HTML Help).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 31.\n\nresume.exe: actions on first launch\nThe payload runs in a new process %windir%\\System32\\spoolsv.exe, into which the main shellcode is injected: Cobalt Strike Beacon with C2\naddress 149.28.84[.]98.\n\nInjection occurs by creating a section via a ZwCreateSection call, getting access to it from the parent and child processes via\nZwMapViewOfSection calls, copying shellcode to the section, and placing a jump to the shellcode at the entry point for spoolsv.exe.\n\nFor persistence, resume.exe (under the name winness.exe) is copied to the folder %appdata%\\Microsoft\\AddIns\\ and the main shellcode is reencrypted and saved in the same location, with the name winness.config. To ensure autostart, auxiliary shellcode writes the file svchost.bat,\nwhich transfers control to winness.exe, to the startup folder. For avoiding detection at this stage, the auxiliary shellcode is injected in a similar\nway into spoolsv.exe, independently loads the necessary functions, and writes to file in a separate thread.\n\nWhen winness.exe runs after a restart, the main shellcode is decrypted from winness.config and injected into spoolsv.exe in exactly the same\nway.\n\n### 3.2 HFS with a surprise\n\nFigure 32.

This file is a self-contained loader\nfor Cobalt Strike Beacon PL shellcode.\n\nIts C2 server is interesting: update.facebookdocs[.]com.\n\nWe discovered that the main domain facebookdocs[.]com hosted a copy of the official site of Battlestate Games: www.battlestategames.com.\nVia an associated C2 IP address (108.61.214[.]194), we found an equivalent page on the phishing domain www.battllestategames[.]com (note\nthe double \"l\").\n\nFigure 37. Copy of\n\nthe official Battlestate Games site\nWhen used as C2 servers such domains give attackers the ability to mask malicious traffic as legitimate activity within the company\n\n\n-----\n\ne co b at o o t ese t o ds a es us t t at e detected t aces o p epa at o o, a d subseque t success u p e e tat o o,\nan attack on Battlestate Games.\n\nMoreover, the match between the job listing for Unity3D developer (as seen in the screenshot from the official site) and contents of the\ncurriculum vitae in the file CV.chm (as described in the previous section), considering how closely they matched in time as well as the company\nand \"applicant\" both being located in St. Petersburg, suggests a connection between these attacks. Most likely, the CHM file attack was used\nat the beginning stage of the breach, although we do not have solid confirmation for this.\n\n[Use of typosquatting domains for C2 servers is typical of Winnti and has been described in a Kaspersky report.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20134508/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf)\n\nBattlestate Games received all of the information uncovered by our investigation into the suspected attack.\n\n## 4. A purloined certificate\n\nAnother favorite Winnti technique is theft of certificates for code signing. Compromised certificates are used to sign malicious files intended for\nfuture attacks.\n\nWe found one such certificate belonging to Taiwanese company Zealot Digital:\n```\nName:      ZEALOT DIGITAL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nIssuer:     GlobalSign CodeSigning CA - SHA256 - G2\nValid From:   07:43 AM 08/20/2015\nValid To:    07:43 AM 09/19/2016\nValid Usage:  Code Signing\nAlgorithm:   sha256RSA\nThumbprint:   91e256ac753efe79927db468a5fa60cb8a835ba5\nSerial Number: 112195a147c06211d2c4b82b627e3d07bf09\n\n```\nThe files signed with it were predominantly used in attacks on organizations in Hong Kong. They include Crosswalk and Metasploit injectors,\nthe juicy-potato utility, and samples of FunnySwitch and ShadowPad.\n\n## 5. FunnySwitch\n\nAmong the files signed with the Zealot Digital certificate, we discovered two samples of malware containing a previously unknown backdoor.\nWe have called it FunnySwitch, based on the name of the library and one of the key classes. The backdoor is written in .NET and can send\nsystem information as well as run arbitrary JScript code, with support for six different connection types, including the ability to accept incoming\nconnections. One of its distinguishing features is the ability to act as message relay between different copies of the backdoor and a C2 server.\n\n### 5.1 Unpacking\n\nThe attack in question starts with the SFX archive x32.exe (2063fae36db936de23eb728bcf3f8a5572f83645786c2a0a5529c71d8447a9af).\n\nFigure 38. Contents of\n\nthe archive x32.exe\nThe archive unpacks three files (1.vbs, n3.exe, and p3.exe) into the folder c:\\programdata, after which the extracted VBS script runs both\nexecutables.\n\nThe files n3.exe and p3.exe are identical and inject shellcode into the process explorer.exe. The only difference between them is the final bytes\nof the shellcode they inject, which contain the XML configuration. In one case, the proxy server 168.106.1[.]1 is specified there in addition:\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<Config Group=\"aa\" Password=\"test\" StartTime=\"0\" EndTime=\"24\" WeekDays=\"0,1,2,3,4,5,6\">\n  <HttpConnector url=\"http://db311secsd.kasprsky[.]info/config/\" proxy=\"http://168.106.1[.]1/\" interval=\"30-60\"/>\n</Config>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<Config Group=\"aa\" Password=\"test\" StartTime=\"0\" EndTime=\"24\" WeekDays=\"0,1,2,3,4,5,6\">\n  <HttpConnector url=\"http://db311secsd.kasprsky[.]info/config/\" interval=\"30-60\"/>\n</Config>\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nsubdo a o asp s y[ ] o, db3 secsd asp s y[ ] o, s t e C do a te est g y, se e a o ts ot e subdo a s a e e t o ed\nan FBI report. It dates to May 21, 2020, and warns of attacks on organizations linked to COVID-19 research.\n\nThe job of the shellcode is to launch and execute a method from the .NET assembly located immediately after its code. To do so, it gets a\n[reference to the ICorRuntimeHost interface, which it uses to run CLR and create an](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr) [AppDomain object. The contents of the assembly are](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.appdomain)\nloaded into the newly created domain. Reflection is used to run the static method Funny.Core.Run(xml_config), to which the XML configuration\nis passed.\n\nFigure 39. Calling a\n\nmethod from the .NET assembly\nThe assembly is the library Funny.dll with obfuscation by ConfuserEx.\n\n### 5.2 Funny.dll\n\nThe backdoor starts by parsing the configuration. Its root element may contain the following fields:\n\nDebug is the flag for enabling debug logging\nGroup is an arbitrary string sent together with system information.\nPassword is the key used to encrypt messages.\nID identifies the relay (if not present in the configuration, the GUID is used instead).\nStartTime, EndTime, and WeekDays restrict the times and days when the backdoor may function\n\nThe `<Config> element may contain an arbitrary number of elements describing various types of connectors:`\n\nTcpConnector and TcpBindConnector are classes responsible for connecting over TCP as client and server.\n\nThey have two parameters in common: `address and` `port (by default, 38001). TcpConnector also has the` `parameter interval,`\nwhich indicates how long to wait before trying to reconnect.\n\nHttpConnector and HttpBindConnector are HTTP client with support for proxy and HTTP server.\n\nSupported client parameters: `url – address to connect to,` `interval – same as at TcpConnector,` `proxy and` `cred – proxy server`\naddress and credentials. Server parameters: `url – list of prefixes on which it will run and` `timeout – client timeout.`\n\nThe standard classes HttpWebRequest and HttpListener from .NET Framework are used for client and server implementations. Both\nHTTP and HTTPS are supported: if no SSL certificate is configured for the port on which the server is running, it will be launched with CN\n= `Environment.MachineName + \".local.domain\" . The client, in turn, ignores certificate validation.`\n\nRPCConnector and RPCBindConnector are classes that allow setting up a connection via a Named Pipe. They take a single parameter,\n```\n   name, which is the name of the connection.\n\n```\nTcpBindConnector and HttpBindConnector support simultaneous connections for multiple clients.\n\nFor the network connectors to work, the backdoor adds an allow rule to Windows Firewall with the name \"Core Networking ― IPv4\" for its\nexecutable module.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 40. Code\n\nfor adding Windows Firewall rules\nJust like with Crosswalk, there are multiple levels of the protocol: in this case, transport, network, and application.\n\n**5.2.1 Transport protocols**\n\n1. TCP\n\nTCP supports three types of messages: PingMessage (0x1), PongMessage (0x2), and DataMessage (0x3). The first two monitor the\nconnection and are relevant only at the TcpConnector/TcpBindConnector level. DataMessage contains network-level data.\n\nMessages consist of a signature (4 bytes), encrypted header (16 bytes), and optional data.\n\nThe signature is three random bytes followed by their sum with modulo 256. Incoming messages with an invalid signature are discarded.\n\nThe header contains the data size (4 bytes) and byte indicating the message type (0x1, 0x2, or 0x3).\n\nIt is encrypted with AES-256-CBC; the key and IV are taken from the MD5 of the key string. The backdoor uses this encryption method in\nother cases as well, which is why we refer to it as \"standard\" in the text that follows. The key string in this case is \"tcp_encrypted\".\n\nFigure 41. Standard\n\nencryption in FunnySwitch\n\n\n-----\n\nt o g po g\nThere are three types of requests: GET \"connect\", GET \"pull\", and POST \"push\". To start transferring data, the client must connect by\nsending a GET request to a URL from the configuration and provide a special cookie value.\n\nThe cookie name is eight random characters. The value is an encrypted Base64 string containing the session GUID and operation name\n(\"connect\"). The string is encrypted in the standard way with the key \"http\".\n\nThe client then constantly sends GET requests with pull operations. In response, the server returns the relevant array of messages for\nthe client or, if no new messages have arrived in the last 10 seconds, an empty response. Client–server messages are periodically sent\nas an array as well, for which a POST request with push operation is used.\n\nFigure\n\n42. FunnySwitch connect and pull requests\nThe special class MsgPack class, which implements a custom serialization protocol, unpacks the array and other primitive types.\n\n3. RPC (Pipe)\n\nSimilar to TCP, except for the absence of connection monitoring.\n\n**5.2.2 Network-level protocol**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 43. Function for processing incoming network-level communications\nAll messages at this level are encrypted in the backdoor's standard way, with the key string \"commonkey\".\n\nMessages are an array of three or four elements:\n\nMessage type (\"hello_request\", \"hello_response\", \"message\", \"error\")\nSource serialized array\nDestination serialized array\nPayload (application-level data)\n\nThe MsgPack class is also used for serialization. The Source and Destination arrays contain the IDs of the relays through which the message\nhas already passed and the IDs of the routers through it should be delivered to the recipient.\n\nThe bodies of hello_request and hello_response messages contain information about the sender's system. When one of these messages is\nreceived, the relay saves data about the sender ID, used connector instance and system data. These message types are used to establish a\ndirect connection between relays.\n\nMessages of the \"message\" type (ones that are not hello_request, hello_response, or error) can be passed via several relays. If its Destination\nfield contains only the ID of the current instance, it will be handled locally; if not, it will be sent to the next relay in the list. For connecting to the\nnext instance, it uses the connector that was saved when exchanging hello_request and hello_response messages.\n\nThe backdoor collects the following system information:\n\nValues of the registry keys ProductName and CSDVersion from HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\nWhether the OS is 32-bit or 64-bit\nList of IP addresses\nComputer name\nUsername and workgroup\nName of running module\nPID\n\n\n-----\n\nC add esses o et o adapte s\nValue of the Group attribute in the XML configuration\n\n**5.2.3 Application-level protocol**\n\nAt the application level, data is encrypted in the standard way using the value of the Password attribute from the configuration. If no such value\nexists, the key string is \"test\". Data is compressed with GZip prior to encryption.\n\nAfter decryption and decompression, the payload is an array (packed MsgPack) consisting of one or two elements: a string with the name of a\ncommand and optional array of bytes (data for the command). These elements, in turn, contain another serialized array, which contains a\nmessage string ID (which will be used to send the result of the command) plus the data for the command.\n\n**5.2.4 Supported commands**\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\ninvoke Run JScript code and get the result. Implementation was separated out into a JSCore .NET assembly, which is dynamically\nloaded from a Base64 constant defined in the main assembly.\n\nFigure 44.\n\nLoading the Funny.Eval class from the JSCore assembly\nCode execution is accomplished with classes from the Microsoft.JScript namespace.\n\nFigure 45.\n\nCode fragments from the Funny.Eval class\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nconnect Takes an XML string with connector configuration and creates the corresponding object.\n\nupdate Packs a response containing the IDs of relays connected to the current copy, together with their system information.\n\nquery Collects the configuration of active connector instances other than the RPCConnector and RPCBindConnector classes.\n\nremove Removes the specified connector.\n\ncreateStream Creates a message queue with the indicated name. The queue connects with the sender of the createStream command.\n\ncloseStream Deletes the named message queue.\n\nsendStream Adds a message (byte array) to the queue with the specified name.\n\nThe result of execution of each command is returned to the sender via the invoke-response command.\n\n**5.2.5 Unused code**\n\nBy all appearances, the FunnySwitch backdoor is still under development, as shown by the incomplete state of message queue functionality.\nBesides the commands described here already, the code contains the functions PullStream and SendStream, which are not used anywhere.\nThe first extracts a message from the queue (by queue name), while the second sends its creator an arbitrary set of bytes with the stream-data\ncommand.\n\nThe code also contains several unused classes: an implementation of the KCP protocol, limited-size queue SizeQueue, and string serializer\nStreamString.\n\nFigure 46. Fragment of KCP class code\n\n**5.2.6 FunnySwitch vs. Crosswalk**\n\nBased on investigation of the two backdoors, we believe that they were written by the same developers. Several things point at common\nauthorship:\n\nUse of multiple transport protocols\n\nSupport for specifying a proxy server\n\nIdentical configuration restrictions on time of day and days of the week\n\nImplementation of the KCP protocol\n\nImplemented (and disabled by default) logging of debug messages and errors\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 47. Error\n\nlogging in Crosswalk Figure 48.\n\nMessage logging in FunnySwitch\n\n## 6. ShadowPad\n\nDuring the investigation we also discovered two samples containing ShadowPad malware.\n\nThe first of these is the SFX archive 20200926___Request for wedding reception.exe\n(03b7b511716c074e9f6ef37318638337fd7449897be999505d4a3219572829b4).\n\nFigure 49. Contents of\n\nthe archive 20200926___Request for wedding reception.exe\nFor bait, it contains a Chinese-language Microsoft Word document with the text of a wedding banquet form.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 50. Bait file\n\nwedding.docx\nThe archive contents are unpacked to the folder c:\\programdata, from where (besides the bait file being opened) the payload log.exe is\nlaunched.\n\nBoth the executable file and the DLL library are obfuscated with VMProtect, but we also found identical unprotected versions (as shown in the\nfollowing screenshots).\n\nAn unpacked legitimate component of Bitdefender (386eb7aa33c76ce671d6685f79512597f1fab28ea46c8ec7d89e58340081e2bd) serves as\nlog.exe. It dynamically loads the library log.dll.\n\nFigure 51. Loading log.dll in log.exe\n\nThe library, in turn, when loaded checks for whether the current module contains a certain set of bytes at offset 0x2775. If the loading module\nmeets its expectations, these bytes change to a call instruction for a DLL function. As a result, in log.exe right after log.dll loads, a call is made\nto the function sub_100010D0. The called function is not explicitly exported.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 52. Check and modification of executable module\n\nin log.dll\n[A similar technique has been previously described by ESET in the context of Winnti attacks on universities in Hong Kong. ShadowPad](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/)\nmalware was used as the payload in these attacks.\n\nIn our case, the code run afterwards had been obfuscated with a new approach: all functions are split into separate instructions that shuffle\nbetween each other. Jumps between instructions occur by means of calls to a special function (rel_jmp), which emulates the jmp command.\nThe offset at which the jump occurs is written immediately after a call instruction (see the following figure).\n\nFigure 53. Structure of obfuscated code\n\nIn addition, to obfuscate the control flow in the code, conditional jumps that never run are included as well:\n```\ncmp   esp, 3181h\njb   loc_1000BCA9\n\n```\nThe obfuscated code is the loader for the subsequent shellcode, which is encrypted in the file log.dll.dat. After decryption, the file is deleted\nand the shellcode is re-encrypted, saved in the registry, and run. When log.exe is launched subsequently, the shellcode will be loaded from the\nregistry.\n\nThe data is stored in a hive with a name resembling the following: (HKLM|HKCU)\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{%8.8x-%4.4x-%4.4x%8.8x%8.8x}, in key %8.8X. The values inserted in the formatting strings are generated based on the TimeDateStamp in the PE header of\nlog.dll, and therefore are always identical for any given library copy. In our case, they equal {56a36bd2-5e2b-20b0-96f2cb9bb3f43475} and\nEB5D1182, respectively.\n\nThe payload is ShadowPad shellcode that has been obfuscated with the same rel_jmp and fake-jb techniques. The following strings are\ncontained in its encrypted configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nccc\n%ProgramData%\\\nmsdn.exe\nlog.dll\nlog.dll.dat\nWMNetworkSvc\nWMNetworkSvc\nWMNetworkSvc\nSOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\nWMSVC\n%ProgramFiles%\\Windows Media Player\\wmplayer.exe\n%windir%\\system32\\svchost.exe\n%windir%\\system32\\winlogon.exe\n%windir%\\explorer.exe\nTCP://cigy2jft92.kasprsky.info:443\nUDP://cigy2jft92.kasprsky.info:53\nSOCKS4\nSOCKS4\nSOCKS5\nSOCKS5\n\n```\nThey include the likely data of module assembly (June 6, 2020), name of the service used by the malware to gain persistence on the system\n(WMNetworkSvc), names of processes into which shellcode can be injected, and the C2 domain cigy2jft92.kasprsky[.]info.\n\nAs we wrote earlier, the other domain kasprsky[.]info has been used by attackers as a FunnySwitch C2 server. Investigation of subdomains\nand IP addresses yields another second-level domain, livehost[.]live, whose subdomain d89o0gm35t.livehost[.]live is indicated as a C2 server\nin one copy of Crosswalk (86100e3efa14a6805a33b2ed24234ac73e094c84cf4282426192607fb8810961). Moreover, all samples of these\nbackdoors were signed with the stolen Zealot Digital certificate and were likely used together as part of a single campaign.\n\nThis is not the only example of a connection between the Crosswalk and ShadowPad network infrastructures. Two Crosswalk C2 servers we\nfound, 103.248.21[.]134 and 103.248.21[.]179, contained an SSL certificate with SHA-1 value of\nb1d749a8883ac9860c45986e2ffe370feb3d9ab6. The same certificate was noted at IP address 103.4.29[.]167, which via the domain\nupdate.ilastname[.]com was used as a C2 server for another copy of ShadowPad\n(37be65842e3fc72a5ceccdc3d7784a96d3ca6c693d84ed99501f303637f9301a).\n\nFigure 54. Fragment of ShadowPad and PlugX infrastructure\n\n## 7. PlugX\n\nThe SSL certificate pointed us to another C2 server, with the domain ns.mircosoftbox[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\ne ou d t at t s C se e s used by a te est g copy o t e ug bac doo ts co e s typ ca o ug, be g a S a c e\n(ccdb8e0162796efe19128c0bac78478fd1ff2dc3382aed0c19b0f4bd99a31efc) that contains the library mapistub.dll, which loads as a legitimate\nexecutable.\n\nFigure 55.\n\nPlugX SFX archive\nBut mapistub.dll is only a downloader. Google Docs is used to store the payload: the library sends a request to export a certain document in\n.txt format, decodes it into shellcode with Base64, and runs it.\n\nFigure 56. Loading and running shellcode in mapistub.dll\n\nThe shellcode has been obfuscated with junk instructions and inverted conditional jumps (combinations of jle/jg and the like). Its job is to\ndecrypt and run the next stage, which is responsible for reflective loading of the main PlugX component and passing the structure with the\nconfiguration to it.\n\nFigure 57. Obfuscated shellcode from\n\nGoogle Docs\n[This process and what the similar sample does after that are described in more detail in a report from Dr.Web (QuickHeal shellcode and](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/july/Study_of_the_APT_attacks_on_state_institutions_in_Kazakhstan_and_Kyrgyzstan_en.pdf)\nBackDoor.PlugX.28).\n\nBesides the C2 servers in the configuration file, 103.79.76[.]205 and ns.mircosoftbox[.]com, in our case the attackers also used a technique\ntypical of PlugX for getting a C2 server at a specified URL. The C2 address is encoded in the page body between the DZKS and DZJS\nmarkers.\n\nAgain, the address of a Google Docs document is used as the URL.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 58.\n\nDocument with encoded URL\nNote that the document is editable without logging in. But when we accessed it for the first time, it had the IP address 107.174.45[.]134, which\nis related to the domain dc-d68d34331440.mircosoftbox[.]com and, apparently, had been put in place by the attackers.\n\n[A similar technique has been used by Winnti in the past: according to Trend Micro, an encoded C2 address was stored in GitHub repositories](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/c/winnti-abuses-github.html)\nin 2017.\n\n### 7.1 Paranoid PlugX\n\nWe were able to detect an additional copy of PlugX that contained shellcode fully identical to that downloaded from Google Docs, except for\nthe encrypted configuration.\n\nIt, too, is an SFX archive (94ea23e7f53cb9111dd61fe1a1cbb79b8bbabd2d37ed6bfa67ba2a437cfd5e92) but with different files inside.\n\nFigure 59.\n\nContents of the SFX archive\nWhen unpacked, the archive runs the script 1.vbs, which in turn passes control to a.bat.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 60. Contents of a.bat\nThe main payload is in the file image.jpg, which is actually a specially crafted .NET assembly. The assembly launches with the help of\nInstallUtil.exe from .NET Framework, enabling it to bypass application allowlist restrictions.\n\nFigure 61. Running shellcode in image.jpg\nThe purpose of image.jpg is to run the same PlugX shellcode with the help of CreateThread.\n\nIts configuration contains two C2 servers: update.upgradsource[.]com and ns.upgradsource[.]com.\n\n[The domain upgradsource[.]com is mentioned in a Unit42 report on a group of similar samples named \"Paranoid PlugX.\" They received this](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-paranoid-plugx/)\nname due to the presence of a script for wiping traces of malware from the system. Comparing the sample we found to those described in that\nreport, we conclude with strong confidence that it belongs to the same group. Among other reasons, the structure of the .NET Wrapper module\nin image.jpg, and much of the cleanup script a.bat, is nearly identical.\n\nAccording to Unit42, the main targets of Paranoid PlugX attacks were gaming companies—which are known to be a typical area of interest for\nWinnti. Investigation of the network infrastructure provides yet another piece of confirmation of the relationship between Paranoid PlugX and\nWinnti.\n\nAs of late 2017, update.upgradsource[.]com resolved to the IP address 121.170.185[.]183. Later, update.byeserver[.]com and\nupdate.serverbye[.]com resolved to this address as well. The second-level domains byeserver[.]com and serverbye[.]com, in turn, are listed by\nFireEye in its [report on APT41.](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/)\n\n## 8. Conclusion\n\nWinnti has an extensive arsenal of malware, as can be seen from the group's attacks. Winnti uses both widely available tools (Metasploit,\nCobalt Strike, PlugX) and custom-developed ones, which are constantly increasing in number. By May 2020, the group had started to use its\nnew backdoor, FunnySwitch, which possess unusual message relay functionality.\n\nOne distinguishing trait of the group's backdoors is support for multiple transport protocols for connecting to C2 servers, which complicates\nefforts to detect malicious traffic. Malicious files of varying resemblance are used to install the payload, from primitive RAR and SFX-RAR files\nto reuse of malware from other groups and multistage threats with vulnerability exploits and non-trivial shellcode loaders. But the payload may\n\n\n-----\n\nbe o e a d t e sa e a t ese cases ost e y, t e c o ce s d ctated by t e p ec s o (o ac t e eo ) o a attac u que ect o c a s\nand highly attractive bait are held back for targeted attacks.\n\nWinnti continues to pursue game developers and publishers in Russia and elsewhere. Small studios tend to neglect information security,\nmaking them a tempting target. Attacks on software developers are especially dangerous for the risk they pose to end users, as already\nhappened in the well-known cases of CCleaner and ASUS. By ensuring timely detection and investigation of breaches, companies can avoid\nbecoming victims of such a scenario.\n\n## 9.
