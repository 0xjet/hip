And Hladyr, a Ukrainian in his mid-30s, is allegedly a big reason that FIN7 operated\nlike a well-oiled multinational corporation.\n\nHladyr allegedly controlled an instant messaging service that the crime group used to upload\nstolen payment card data and screenshots from hacked financial firms. He also allegedly\n[organized FIN7’s work through a project-tracking software that managed thousands of stolen](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/fin7/)\nusernames and passwords.\n\nFederal prosecutors argued for a 10-year prison sentence for Hladyr because it would “send\na strong message of public deterrence” to persistent cybercriminals. They described him as\na “technical guru,” an elite hacker among talented ones, whose skills were integral to making\nFIN7 a vaunted threat to U.S. businesses.\n\nHladyr’s prosecution is win for Justice Department officials looking to make a dent in the\narray of well-funded cybercriminal groups that target U.S. businesses from Eastern Europe.\n[Yet despite his prosecution, and the arrest of other alleged FIN7 members, the group has](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over)\ncontinued to try to steal from businesses. In early 2020, the group used the U.S. Postal\nService to send malware-laced USB sticks to multiple organizations.\n\nHladyr’s was arrested in Germany in January 2018, and subsequently extradited to the U.S.\n[District Court for the Western District of Washington. He pleaded guilty in September 2019 to](https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-fedir-hladyr-guilty-carbanak/)\nwire fraud and conspiracy to commit computer hacking as part of plea deal aimed at getting\nhim a reduced sentence. Hladyr’s lawyer, George Grasso, argued that his client’s three years\nof incarceration, during which he said Hladyr contracted the coronavirus, was enough of a\ndeterrent. Grasso also said that Hladyr had experienced extensive tragedy in his life, and\nshould be released so he could care for sick family members who needed his support.\n\nWhile previous estimates from cybersecurity researchers had put FIN7’s theft at $1 billion,\nU.S. prosecutors said in their sentencing memorandum for Hladyr that a “conservative\nestimate” of the losses caused by the group is between $3 billion to $5.7 billion.\n\nFIN7 has disguised much of its criminal activity behind a front company dubbed Combi\nSecurity. Grasso acknowledged that after Hladyr learned of Combi Security’s criminal\nactivities, his client continued to work for the front company. Grasso said Hladyr felt\ncompelled to do so to provide for his son.\n\nHladyr told the court he regretted the day he started with Combi Security, and accepted\nresponsibility for his crimes.\n\n“I was so stupid, careless and reckless and for this I sincerely apologize to the court and to\nthe government,” he said before the sentencing.\n\n\n-----",
