While the investigation is currently ongoing, this advisory provides guidance on taking\nnecessary precautions via a checklist for the affected product versions.\n\n### Update Feb. 25, 2022\n\nIn our ongoing research into activity surrounding Ukraine and in cooperation with Cisco Duo\ndata scientists Talos discovered compromised MikroTik routers inside of Ukraine being\nleveraged to conduct brute force attacks on devices protected by multi-factor authentication.\nThis continues a pattern we have seen since our investigation into VPNFilter involving actors\nusing MikroTik routers. While it may not be Cyclops Blink specifically -- we can't know without\na forensic investigation -- it was yet another MikroTik router passing malicious traffic, a\nvendor widely abused by VPNFilter in the past.\n\n\n-----\n\nCisco Talos is aware of the recent reporting around a new modular malware family, Cyclops\nBlink, that targets small and home office (SOHO) devices, similar to previously observed\n[threats like VPNFilter. This malware is designed to run on Linux systems and is compiled](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/05/one-year-later-vpnfilter-catastrophe.html)\nspecifically for 32-bit PowerPC architecture. The modular nature of this malware allows it to\nbe used in a variety of ways, including typical reconnaissance and espionage activity. It\nleverages modules to facilitate various operations such as establishment of C2, file\nupload/download and information extraction capabilities.\n\n## Details of modular Cyclops Blink malware\n\nCyclops Blink is a Linux ELF executable compiled for 32-bit PowerPC architecture that has\ntargeted SOHO network devices since at least June 2019. The complete list of targeted\ndevices is unknown at this time, but WatchGuard FireBox has specifically been listed as a\ntarget. The modular malware consists of core components and modules that are deployed as\nchild processes using the Linux API fork. At this point, four modules have been identified that\ndownload and upload files, gather system information and contain updating mechanisms for\nthe malware itself. Additional modules can be downloaded and executed from the command\nand control (C2) server.\n\nThe core component has a variety of functionality. Initially, it confirms that it's running as a\nprocess named 'kworker[0:1]' which allows it to masquerade as a kernel process. If that is\nnot the case, it will reload itself as that process name and kill the parent process. The core\ncomponent then adjusts the iptables to allow additional access via a set of hard-coded ports\nthat are used for C2 communication. The C2 communication is conducted through multiple\nlayers of encryption including a TLS tunnel with individual commands encrypted using AES256-CBC.\n\n### Module details\n\nThe four known modules perform a variety of functions and tasks associated with initial\naccess and reconnaissance. This could be the basis to deploy additional modules, but at this\npoint, we cannot confirm any additional modules.\n\nThe system reconnaissance module (ID 0x8) is designed to gather various pieces of\ninformation from the system at regular intervals, initially set to occur every 10 minutes.\n\nThe file upload/download module (ID 0xf) is designed to upload and download files. These\ninstructions are sent by the core component and can include downloads from URLs or\nuploads of files to C2 servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 server list module (ID 0x39) is used to store and/or update the list of IP addresses\nused for C2 activity. The list is loaded and passed to the core component and when updates\nare received from the core component it is passed into this module to be updated.\n\nThe Update/Persistence module (ID 0x51) installs updates to Cyclops Blink or ensures its\npersistence on the system. The update process leverages the firmware update process on\nthe device. The persistence is handled via a subprocess to this module and involves\noverwriting legitimate executables with modified versions allowing the firmware update\nprocess to be manipulated to update Cyclops Blink.\n\n[Complete details on the modules and core components can be found in NCSC's report.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyclops-Blink-Malware-Analysis-Report.pdf)\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
