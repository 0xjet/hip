Instead of separate cards for iTunes or Apple\nStore purchases, consumers can now purchase a single gift card and use the to purchase\nproducts, accessories, games, music, movies, TV shows, iCloud, and more .\n\nThe site below leverages a typosquat attack and uses a URL that looks authentic and could\neasily fool somebody. The user is prompted to enter their gift card number to check their\nbalance. Once they do, the site either hangs indefinitely or shows an error message. In\nsome cases, it displays an invalid number message. Unfortunately for the user, if they get\nthis far, it's already too late. The criminal has the gift card number and has either sold it on a\ngift card exchange or used it to make a purchase of their own.\n\n**Scam Site URL: applegiftcardbalance[ ]com**\n\n\n-----\n\nApple Everything Gift Card Scam Site\nApple's new gift cards are likely to be a popular gift during this holiday season given the\ncompany's slate of new products launched this year. In the past 90 days, Bolster Research\nhas found 1,645 phishing or scam Apple sites, and over 10,000 suspicious URLs that include\nthe word \"apple.\" The sites are hosted in multiple countries with some of the more\ninteresting countries being the Russian Federation (588 sites), US Virgin Islands (75 sites),\nand Ukraine (2 sites).\n\nThe sites are hosted on a number of top level domains (TLDs), which demonstrates the\nproblem companies face as more TLDs are created every year. The traditional defensive\nmethod of proactive domain registrations is economically unfeasible given that a six letter\ndomain results in 1,200 variations.  Bolster's has an extensive report and analysis of this\n[problem, which can be read here.](https://bolster.ai/typosquatting)\n\n\n-----\n\nTop Level Domains Hosting Apple Phishing/Scam Sites\nOriginal blog post December 8, 2020\n\n2020 has been an unpredictable year for retail and online shopping, and analysts are very\ncautious in their holiday season predictions The International Council of Shopping Centers\n(ICSC) predicts a nominal 1.9% increase from 2019(1), where Deloitte predicts two possible\nscenarios with retail holiday sales growth anywhere between 0% to 3.5%(2). Though the\nfaltering economy, high unemployment and surging COVID-19 infections are causing\nanxious consumers to avoid brick and mortar stores, online shopping continues to rise.\n\nGift cards are one of most popular gifting options for the holidays, especially as e-gift cards\nare now available by most major retailers including Amazon, Target and Best Buy. Research\nfirm Technavio forecasts a 13% compound annual growth rate for gift cards, driven by among\nother things the growth of e-commerce, which has exploded during the pandemic. Cyber\ncriminals have taken notice and are launching specific online campaigns targeting gift cards.\n\nBolster research discovered a sharp rise in gift card scams as cyber criminals launch tactics\nto take advantage of the giving season. The analysis uncovered two primary types of gift\ncard scams:\n\n1. Check your gift card balance\n\nThese sites offer to help you check the balance of your gift cards but steal gift card\nnumbers from consumers.\n2. Survey scams with gift card offer\n\nThese sites offer bogus free gift cards for completing surveys, which are used to collect\npersonal information which is sold for profit.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data for this analysis was collected by the Bolster platform, which analyzes over one\nmillion sites daily and uses a combination of deep learning, natural language processing and\ncomputer vision to understand the intent of a site and make a determination whether it is a\nphishing or scam site. The technology has a false positive rate of 1/100,000.\n\n## Gift Card Scams Explode\n\nBolster Research data shows that gift card scams first spiked in March and April as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic caused many countries to issue shelter in place orders, corresponding\nwith a sharp increase in e-commerce activity. After a brief lull in the summer, the data\nillustrates a more dramatic spike in September, which has continued into November. The\nlarge increase coincides with the early start of the holiday shopping season, including\nAmazon Prime Day in mid-October. November experienced the highest rate of new gift card\nscams with 6,881 total new sites, over 229 new sites per day and nearly 10X more new sites\ncreated than those in January.\n\nNearly 10X Increase in New Scams Monthly\n\n## Retail and Gaming are Prime Targets\n\nAmong the categories, retail and gaming are the most often targeted by gift card scammers\ngoing into the holiday season. In November, these two categories accounted for 59% of all\ngift card scams found online. The large increase is driven by the popularity of these\ncategories during the holiday shopping season and the introduction of two highly anticipated\nnew gaming consoles from Microsoft and Sony.\n\n\n-----\n\nPercent of\n\nGift Card Scams by Category\n\n## Check Your Gift Card Balance Scams\n\nTarget experienced a dramatic increase in e-commerce sales during the pandemic. In\nAugust, the company announced that its digital sales tripled with online purchases and\ncurbside pickup jumped by more than 700%(3). Not surprisingly, Target gift cards are one of\nthe more popular online scams discovered by Bolster Research.\n\nThe screenshot below illustrates a fraudulent Target gift card balance checker site. The\nlayout, text and colors are identical to the authentic Target gift card balance checking site,\n[which can be viewed here. Unsuspecting users can easily be tricked to enter their gift card](https://www.target.com/guest/gift-card-balance)\nnumbers. Once they enter the number, the site displays a never ending “checking balance”\nstatus or some sort of error misleading users into thinking the site is malfunctioning. In reality,\nthe valid gift card numbers are harvested by the criminals and monetized by either reselling\nthem on other sites or using them to make purchases.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fake Target Gift Card**\n\n**Balance Checker Site (https://www.targetgiftscard[.]com/)**\nThough the criminals went to a lot of effort to make this appear authentic, there are signs that\nthis is not a legitimate Target site.\n\n**None of the other URLs work. Clicking on the links to sign in, search store locations,**\nor look at the weekly ads don’t function. The reason is because criminals do not want\ntheir victims to leave the scam site. Linking to the real Target site would allow the users\nto go to leave the site before entering their gift card numbers.\n**The URL utilizes a typosquatting attack, utilizing a carefully chosen URL to trick**\n**users into believing it is an authentic Target site. The wording is slightly awkward**\nwith “…giftScard.com” but this could be easily overlooked. Target does seem to own\n“…giftcard.com” and “…giftcards.com.” These have been preemptively registered to\nprevent this type of attack. However, this scam site shows the limitations of preemptive\ndomain registration as a defensive strategy. Bolster Research has an in-depth report\nthat discusses the challenges of fighting typosquatting attacks and the limitations of\npreemptive domain registration.\n\nMore in-depth analysis, that would be typically beyond the technical abilities of the average\nconsumer, confirms that this is not a legitimate Target site.\n\n**The domain is registered to an entity in the state of Delhi, India. Target is a US-**\nbased company and would not register their domains in India.\n**The site is hosted in Singapore through GoDaddy.com. GoDaddy is a consumer**\nand small business service that is not used by large companies to host sites. Unless\nserving a foreign market, US companies host their sites in the US for the best user\nexperience.\n**The IP address has been used for phishing sites in the past. This data is available**\non Bolster’s free community service Checkphish.ai.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The IP address is shared with other non-Target Indian business sites such as**\n**www.megabooster[.]in. Large multinational corporations like Target use their own IP**\naddresses and do not share them with other sites.\n\nBolster Research found other Target gift card scam sites that are less sophisticated and have\na lower probability of tricking users. The official Target logos and colors are not used, and the\ntext reads as the writer learned English as a second language. The main image looks like it\nis the inside of a Target store. What is interesting, however, is that by avoiding the use of\nTarget’s official logo, this site is more likely to evade detection. Most brand protection\ncompanies rely on the use of logos. Bolster discovered this site because its AI-driven\nplatform combines highly accurate computer vision and natural language processing to\nassess the intent of the site, similar to how a human being would assess the site.\n\n**Fake Target Gift Card**\n\n**Balance Checker Site (http://etargetgift[.]com/)**\n\n## Gift Card Survey Scam\n\nGift card survey scams are also becoming more prolific . These sites claim they can check\nfor unused gift card codes. They offer these for free to users if they take the time to fill out a\nshort survey. The purpose of these sites appears to be the collection of personal and\ndemographic information that they will sell to companies or others that find this information\nuseful.\n\nA single group looks to be behind hundreds of these scam sites using fake gift card offers\nfrom AliExpress, Bath & Body Works, Forever 21, and many others. The URL pattern is\nconsistent and follows the template of https://[fake domain]/free-[brand name].html. For\nexample, the URLs below are examples of fake survey sites that look and operate exactly\nthe same except for the gift card brand being offered. Bolster Research has found more than\n1,000 active survey scam sites that appear to be from the same perpetrator.\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://liveoffer.online/free-aliexpress-gift-cards[.]html\nhttps://liveoffer.online/free-bathandbody-gift-cards[.]html\nhttps://gamer007.club/free-forever21-gift-cards[.]html\nhttps://wepromocode.com/free-amazon-gift-cards[.]html\nhttps://promohub.xyz/free-google-play-gift-cards[.]html\nhttp://real-giveaway.com/giftcard/free-hbo-gift-cards[.]html\n\n**Gift Card Survey Scam Site**\n\n**(https://cardspace.club/free-amazon-gift-cards[.]html)**\nAt face value, these survey scams seem overly simple. However, many people have lost\ntheir jobs or are struggling to survive financially, so it is not hard to imagine why people would\nfall for these scams. The scam site itself is very sophisticated and masterfully creates a\nsense of urgency to keep unsuspecting victims engaged. Once a gift card amount is\nselected, the site displays visuals designed to make the victim believe that a database\nsearch is occurring as in the screenshot below. The database search results in a success,\nand a partial gift card code is revealed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fake Amazon Gift Card**\n\n**Scam Revealing Partial Codes**\nWith the victim hooked, the site then proceeds to ask a series of survey questions to gather\ninformation such as name, address, phone number and date of birth. The survey continues\nto ask questions about spending habits, car insurance information, healthcare preferences,\namong other things. During the survey, the victim is required to explicitly opt-in to receive\ncalls and text messages, even if they are listed on the federal or state do not call registry.\n\n**Survey Scam Site Obtaining**\n\n**Explicit Opt-In Consent**\nUnfortunately for the user, there is no gift card at the end of the survey. What actually\nhappens is an endless set of surveys that cover more and more preferences and\ndemographic details. The victim is constantly encouraged to take one more survey for a\n\n\n-----\n\nchance to win another gift card. It is obvious that the site was created by someone with an\nunderstanding of human psychology and gamification to encourage victims to reveal more\nand more personal information.\n\n**Fake Survey Site Notifying of**\n\n**Gift Card Prize Giveaway**\n\n## How to Avoid Gift Card Scams\n\nAs cyber criminals ramp up gift card scams this holiday season, there is a good chance the\naverage shopper will come across one of these campaigns. They could also receive a gift\ncard as a present and unknowingly fall victim to one of these scams. Shoppers can stay save\nand avoid becoming a victim of these scams by following these helpful tips:\n\n**Always use the retailer’s site to check gift card balances. All retailers who offer gift**\ncards have pages on their websites that allow shoppers to check gift card balances.\nAvoid checking your gift card balance on third party sites.\n**Go to a site by typing the retailer’s URL directly. Do not use a search engine such**\nas Google to find a gift card balance checker page. Scammers are known to deploy\nsearch engine optimization tactics to rank high on search engine queries to lure\nunsuspecting victims. Using a search engine could cause you to go to a fake URL that\nclosely resembles the real site.\n**Remember there are no free gift cards. Though it is tempting to believe that today is**\nyour lucky day, nobody gives out free $50 gift cards for a few minutes of your time. The\nlogic is impossible.\n\n\n-----\n\nBolster works with some of the largest brands to protect their users and customers from\nonline phishing and fraud scams such as gift card scams.
