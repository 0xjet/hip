FireEye assesses that APT32\n\n\n-----\n\nleverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with commerciallyavailable tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with Vietnamese state\ninterests.\n\n**APT32 and FireEye’s Community Response**\n\nIn the course of investigations into intrusions at several corporations with business interests\nin Vietnam, FireEye’s Mandiant incident response consultants uncovered activity and\nattacker-controlled infrastructure indicative of a significant intrusion campaign. In March\n2017, in response to active targeting of FireEye clients, the team launched a Community\nProtection Event (CPE) – a coordinated effort between Mandiant incident responders,\nFireEye as a Service (FaaS), FireEye iSight Intelligence, and FireEye product engineering –\nto protect all clients from APT32 activity.\n\nIn the following weeks, FireEye released threat intelligence products and updated malware\nprofiles to customers while developing new detection techniques for APT32’s tools and\nphishing lures. This focused intelligence and detection effort led to new external victim\nidentifications as well as providing sufficient technical evidence to link twelve prior intrusions,\nconsolidating four previously unrelated clusters of threat actor activity into FireEye’s newest\nnamed advanced persistent threat group: APT32.\n\n**APT32 Targeting of Private Sector Company Operations in Southeast Asia**\n\nSince at least 2014, FireEye has observed APT32 targeting foreign corporations with a\nvested interest in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors.\nFurthermore, there are indications that APT32 actors are targeting peripheral network\nsecurity and technology infrastructure corporations.\n\nHere is an overview of intrusions investigated by FireEye that are attributed to APT32:\n\nIn 2014, a European corporation was compromised prior to constructing a\nmanufacturing facility in Vietnam.\nIn 2016, Vietnamese and foreign-owned corporations working in network security,\ntechnology infrastructure, banking, and media industries were targeted.\nIn mid-2016, malware that FireEye believes to be unique to APT32 was detected on\nthe networks of a global hospitality industry developer with plans to expand operations\ninto Vietnam.\nFrom 2016 through 2017, two subsidiaries of U.S. and Philippine consumer products\ncorporations, located inside Vietnam, were the target of APT32 intrusion operations.\n\nTable 1 shows a breakdown of APT32 activity, including the malware families used in each.\n\n**Year** **Country** **Industry** **Malware**\n\n\n-----\n\n2014 Vietnam Network Security WINDSHIELD\n\n2014 Germany Manufacturing WINDSHIELD\n\n2015 Vietnam Media WINDSHIELD\n\n2016 Philippines Consumer products KOMPROGO\n\nWINDSHIELD\n\nSOUNDBITE\nBEACON\n\n2016 Vietnam Banking WINDSHIELD\n\n2016 Philippines Technology Infrastructure WINDSHIELD\n\n2016 China Hospitality WINDSHIELD\n\n2016 Vietnam Media WINDSHIELD\n\n2016 United States Consumer Products WINDSHIELD\n\nPHOREAL\n\nBEACON\n\nSOUNDBITE\n\nTable 1: APT32 Private Sector Targeting Identified by FireEye\n\n**APT32 Interest in Political Influence and Foreign Governments**\n\nIn addition to focused targeting of the private sector with ties to Vietnam, APT32 has also\ntargeted foreign governments, as well as Vietnamese dissidents and journalists since at least\n2013. Here is an overview of this activity:\n\nA [public blog published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation indicated that journalists,](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/01/vietnamese-malware-gets-personal)\nactivists, dissidents, and bloggers were targeted in 2013 by malware and tactics\nconsistent with APT32 operations.\nIn 2014, APT32 leveraged a spear-phishing attachment titled “Plans to crackdown on\nprotesters at the Embassy of Vietnam.exe,\" which targeted dissident activity among the\nVietnamese diaspora in Southeast Asia. Also in 2014, APT32 carried out an intrusion\nagainst a Western country’s national legislature.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2015, SkyEye Labs, the security research division of the Chinese firm Qihoo 360,\n[released a report detailing threat actors that were targeting Chinese public and private](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/oceanlotus-apt)\nentities including government agencies, research institutes, maritime agencies, sea\nconstruction, and shipping enterprises. The information included in the report indicated\nthat the perpetrators used the same malware, overlapping infrastructure, and similar\ntargets as APT32.\nIn 2015 and 2016, two Vietnamese media outlets were targeted with malware that\nFireEye assesses to be unique to APT32.\nIn 2017, social engineering content in lures used by the actor provided evidence that\nthey were likely used to target members of the Vietnam diaspora in Australia as well as\ngovernment employees in the Philippines.\n\n**APT32 Tactics**\n\nIn their current campaign, APT32 has leveraged ActiveMime files that employ social\nengineering methods to entice the victim into enabling macros. Upon execution, the\ninitialized file downloads multiple malicious payloads from remote servers. APT32 actors\ncontinue to deliver the malicious attachments via spear-phishing emails.\n\nAPT32 actors designed multilingual lure documents which were tailored to specific victims.\nAlthough the files had “.doc” file extensions, the recovered phishing lures were ActiveMime\n“.mht” web page archives that contained text and images. These files were likely created by\nexporting Word documents into single file web pages.\n\nTable 2 contains a sample of recovered APT32 multilingual lure files.\n\n**ActiveMime Lure Files** **MD5**\n\n\n2017年员工工资性津贴额统计报告.doc\n\n(2017 Statistical Report on Staff Salary and\nAllowances)\n\nThong tin.doc\n\n(Information)\n\n\n5458a2e4d784abb1a1127263bd5006b5\n\nce50e544430e7265a45fab5a1f31e529\n\n\nPhan Vu Tutn CV.doc 4f761095ca51bfbbf4496a4964e41d4f\n\n\nKe hoach cuu tro nam 2017.doc\n\n(2017 Bailout Plan)\n\n\ne9abe54162ba4572c770ab043f576784\n\n\nInstructions to GSIS.doc fba089444c769700e47c6b44c362f96b\n\n\nHoi thao truyen thong doc lap.doc\n\n(Traditional Games)\n\n\nf6ee4b72d6d42d0c7be9172be2b817c1\n\n\n-----\n\nGiấy yêu cầu bồi thường mới 2016 - hằng.doc\n\n(New 2016 Claim Form)\n\nHoa don chi tiet tien no.doc\n\n(Debt Details)\n\nThu moi tham du Hoi luan.doc\n\n(Collection of Participants)\n\nDanh sach nhan vien vi pham ky luat.doc\n\n(List of Employee Violations)\n\nNội-dung-quảng-cáo.doc\n\n(Internal Content Advertising)\n\n\naa1f85de3e4d33f31b4f78968b29f175\n\n5180a8d9325a417f2d8066f9226a5154\n\nf6ee4b72d6d42d0c7be9172be2b817c1\n\n6baafffa7bf960dec821b627f9653e44\n\n471a2e7341f2614b715dc89e803ffcac\n\n\nHĐ DVPM-VTC 31.03.17.doc f1af6bb36cdf3cff768faee7919f0733\n\nTable 2: Sampling of APT32 Lure Files\n\nThe Base64 encoded ActiveMime data also contained an OLE file with malicious macros.\nWhen opened, many lure files displayed fake error messages in an attempt to trick users into\nlaunching the malicious macros. Figure 1 shows a fake Gmail-theme paired with a\nhexadecimal error code that encourages the recipient to enable content to resolve the error.\nFigure 2 displays another APT32 lure that used a convincing image of a fake Windows error\nmessage instructing the recipient to enable content to properly display document font\ncharacters.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample APT32 Phishing Lure – Fake Gmail Error Message\n\n\nFigure 1: Example APT32 Phishing Lure – Fake Gmail Error Message\n\n\n-----\n\nExample APT32 Phishing Lure – Fake Text Encoding Error Message\n\n\nFigure 2: Example APT32 Phishing Lure – Fake Text Encoding Error Message\nAPT32 operators implemented several novel techniques to track the efficacy of their\nphishing, monitor the distribution of their malicious documents, and establish persistence\nmechanisms to dynamically update backdoors injected into memory.\n\nIn order to track who opened the phishing emails, viewed the links, and downloaded the\nattachments in real-time, APT32 used cloud-based email analytics software designed for\nsales organizations. In some instances, APT32 abandoned direct email attachments\naltogether and relied exclusively on this tracking technique with links to their ActiveMime\nlures hosted externally on legitimate cloud storage services.\n\nTo enhance visibility into the further distribution of their phishing lures, APT32 utilized the\nnative web page functionality of their ActiveMime documents to link to external images\nhosted on APT32 monitored infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 contains an example phishing lure with HTML image tags used for additional\ntracking by APT32.\n\n\nPhishing Lure Containing HTML Image Tags for Additional Tracking\n\n\nFigure 3: Phishing Lure Containing HTML Image Tags for Additional Tracking\nWhen a document with this feature is opened, Microsoft Word will attempt to download the\nexternal image, even if macros were disabled. In all phishing lures analyzed, the external\nimages did not exist. Mandiant consultants suspect that APT32 was monitoring web logs to\ntrack the public IP address used to request remote images. When combined with email\ntracking software, APT32 was able to closely track phishing delivery, success rate, and\nconduct further analysis about victim organizations while monitoring the interest of security\nfirms.\n\nOnce macros were enabled on the target system, the malicious macros created two named\nscheduled tasks as persistence mechanisms for two backdoors on the infected system. The\nfirst named scheduled task launched an application whitelisting script protection bypass to\n\n\n-----\n\nexecute a COM scriptlet that dynamically downloaded the first backdoor from APT32 s\ninfrastructure and injected it into memory. The second named scheduled task, loaded as an\nXML file to falsify task attributes, ran a JavaScript code block that downloaded and launched\na secondary backdoor, delivered as a multi-stage PowerShell script. In most lures, one\nscheduled task persisted an APT32-specific backdoor and the other scheduled task\ninitialized a commercially-available backdoor as backup.\n\nTo illustrate the complexity of these lures, Figure 4 shows the creation of persistence\nmechanisms for recovered APT32 lure “2017年员工工资性津贴额统计报告.doc”.\n\n\nAPT32 ActiveMime Lures Create Two Named Scheduled Tasks\n\n\nFigure 4: APT32 ActiveMime Lures Create Two Named Scheduled Tasks\nIn this example, a scheduled task named “Windows Scheduled Maintenance” was created to\nrun Casey Smith’s [“Squiblydoo” App Whitelisting bypass every 30 minutes. While all](http://subt0x10.blogspot.com/2016/04/bypass-application-whitelisting-script.html)\npayloads can be dynamically updated, at the time of delivery, this task launched a COM\nscriptlet (“.sct” file extension) that downloaded and executed Meterpreter hosted on\n\n\n-----\n\nimages.chinabytes[.]info. Meterpreter then loaded Cobalt Strike BEACON, configured to\n[communicate with 80.255.3[.]87 using the Safebrowsing malleable C2 profile to further blend](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/normal/safebrowsing.profile)\nin with network traffic. A second scheduled task named “Scheduled Defrags” was created by\nloading the raw task XML with a backdated task creation timestamp of June 2, 2016. This\nsecond task ran “mshta.exe” every 50 minutes which launched an APT32-specific backdoor\ndelivered as shellcode in a PowerShell script, configured to communicate with the domains\nblog.panggin[.]org, share.codehao[.]net, and yii.yiihao126[.]net.\n\nFigure 5 illustrates the chain of events for a single successful APT32 phishing lure that\ndynamically injects two multi-stage malware frameworks into memory.\n\n\nAPT32 Phishing Chain of Events\n\n\nFigure 5: APT32 Phishing Chain of Events\nThe impressive APT32 operations did not stop after they established a foothold in victim\nenvironments. Several Mandiant investigations revealed that, after gaining access, APT32\nregularly cleared select event log entries and heavily obfuscated their PowerShell-based\n\n\n-----\n\ntools and shellcode loaders with Daniel Bohannon s [Invoke-Obfuscation framework.](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation)\n\nAPT32 regularly used stealthy techniques to blend in with legitimate user activity:\n\nDuring one investigation, APT32 was observed using a privilege escalation exploit\n(CVE-2016-7255) masquerading as a Windows hotfix.\nIn another investigation, APT32 compromised the McAfee ePO infrastructure to\ndistribute their malware as a software deployment task in which all systems pulled the\npayload from the ePO server using the proprietary SPIPE protocol.\nAPT32 also used hidden or non-printing characters to help visually camouflage their\nmalware on a system. For example, APT32 installed one backdoor as a persistent\nservice with a legitimate service name that had a Unicode no-break space character\nappended to it. Another backdoor used an otherwise legitimate DLL filename padded\nwith a non-printing OS command control code.\n\n**APT32 Malware and Infrastructure**\n\nAPT32 appears to have a well-resourced development capability and uses a custom suite of\nbackdoors spanning multiple protocols. APT32 operations are characterized through\ndeployment of signature malware payloads including WINDSHIELD, KOMPROGO,\nSOUNDBITE, and PHOREAL. APT32 often deploys these backdoors along with the\ncommercially-available Cobalt Strike BEACON backdoor. APT32 may also possess\n[backdoor development capabilities for macOS.](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/oceanlotus-for-os-x-an-application-bundle-pretending-to-be-an-adobe-flash-update)\n\nThe capabilities for this unique suite of malware is shown in Table 3.\n\n**Malware** **Capabilities**\n\nWINDSHIELD Command and control (C2) communications via TCP raw sockets\nFour configured C2s and six configured ports – randomly-chosen\nC2/port for communications\nRegistry manipulation\nGet the current module's file name\nGather system information including registry values, user name,\ncomputer name, and current code page\nFile system interaction including directory creation, file deletion,\nreading, and writing files\nLoad additional modules and execute code\nTerminate processes\nAnti-disassembly\n\n\n-----\n\nKOMPROGO Fully-featured backdoor capable of process, file, and registry\nmanagement\nCreating a reverse shell\nFile transfers\nRunning WMI queries\nRetrieving information about the infected system\n\nSOUNDBITE C2 communications via DNS\nProcess creation\nFile upload\nShell command execution\nFile and directory enumeration/manipulation\nWindow enumeration\nRegistry manipulation\nSystem information gathering\n\nPHOREAL C2 communications via ICMP\nReverse shell creation\nFilesystem manipulation\nRegistry manipulation\nProcess creation\nFile upload\n\n\nBEACON\n(Cobalt Strike)\n\n\nPublicly available payload that can inject and execute arbitrary\ncode into processes\nImpersonating the security context of users\nImporting Kerberos tickets\nUploading and downloading files\nExecuting shell commands\nConfigured with malleable C2 profiles to blend in with normal\nnetwork traffic\nCo-deployment and interoperability with Metasploit framework\nSMB Named Pipe in-memory backdoor payload that enables peerto-peer C2 and pivoting over SMB\n\n\nTable 3: APT32 Malware and Capabilities\n\nAPT32 operators appear to be well-resourced and supported as they use a large set of\ndomains and IP addresses as command and control infrastructure. The FireEye iSIGHT\nIntelligence MySIGHT Portal contains additional information on these backdoor families\nbased on Mandiant investigations of APT32 intrusions.\n\nFigure 6 provides a summary of APT32 tools and techniques mapped to each stage of the\nattack lifecycle.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT32 Attack Lifecycle\n\n\nFigure 6: APT32 Attack Lifecycle\n\n**Outlook and Implications**\n\nBased on incident response investigations, product detections, and intelligence observations\nalong with additional publications on the same operators, FireEye assesses that APT32 is a\ncyber espionage group aligned with Vietnamese government interests. The targeting of\nprivate sector interests by APT32 is notable and FireEye believes the actor poses significant\nrisk to companies doing business in, or preparing to invest in, the country. While the\nmotivation for each APT32 private sector compromise varied – and in some cases was\nunknown – the unauthorized access could serve as a platform for law enforcement,\nintellectual property theft, or anticorruption measures that could ultimately erode the\ncompetitive advantage of targeted organizations. Furthermore, APT32 continues to threaten\n\n\n-----\n\npolitical activism and free speech in Southeast Asia and the public sector worldwide.\nGovernments, journalists, and members of the Vietnam diaspora may continue to be\ntargeted.\n\nWhile actors from China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea remain the most active cyber\nespionage threats tracked and responded to by FireEye, APT32 reflects a growing host of\nnew countries that have adopted this dynamic capability. APT32 demonstrates how\naccessible and impactful offensive capabilities can be with the proper investment and the\nflexibility to embrace newly-available tools and techniques. As more countries utilize\ninexpensive and efficient cyber operations, there is a need for public awareness of these\nthreats and renewed dialogue around emerging nation-state intrusions that go beyond public\nsector and intelligence targets.\n\n**APT32 Detection**\n\nFigure 7 contains a Yara rule can be used to identify malicious macros associated with\nAPT32’s phishing lures:\n\n\n-----\n\nYara Rule for APT32 Malicious Macros\n\n\nFigure 7: Yara Rule for APT32 Malicious Macros\nTable 4 contains a sampling of the infrastructure that FireEye has associated with APT32 C2.\n\n**C2 Infrastructure**\n\n103.53.197.202 104.237.218.70 104.237.218.72\n\n185.157.79.3 193.169.245.78 193.169.245.137\n\n23.227.196.210 24.datatimes.org 80.255.3.87\n\nblog.docksugs.org blog.panggin.org contay.deaftone.com\n\n\n-----\n\ncheck.paidprefund.org datatimes.org docksugs.org\n\neconomy.bloghop.org emp.gapte.name facebook-cdn.net\n\ngap-facebook.com gl-appspot.org help.checkonl.org\n\nhigh.expbas.net high.vphelp.net icon.torrentart.com\n\nimages.chinabytes.info imaps.qki6.com img.fanspeed.net\n\njob.supperpow.com lighpress.info menmin.strezf.com\n\nmobile.pagmobiles.info news.lighpress.info notificeva.com\n\nnsquery.net pagmobiles.info paidprefund.org\n\npush.relasign.org relasign.org share.codehao.net\n\nseri.volveri.net ssl.zin0.com static.jg7.org\n\nsyn.timeizu.net teriava.com timeizu.net\n\ntonholding.com tulationeva.com untitled.po9z.com\n\nupdate-flashs.com vieweva.com volveri.net\n\nvphelp.net yii.yiihao126.net zone.apize.net\n\nTable 4: Sampling of APT32 C2 Infrastructure\n\n\n-----",
