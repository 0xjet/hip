Two new malware\n\nfamilies are used in this campaign that we name UP007 and SLServer.\n\nThe UP007 malware family was previously observed by Arbor Security Emergency Response Team (ASERT) in the report\n\n[“Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger,” which analyzes a set of samples that were hosted on the national level](http://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/uncovering-the-seven-pointed-dagger/)\n\nelectoral commission of Myanmar (Burma): the Myanmar Union Election Commission. One of the samples analyzed was\n\ndescribed as “unknown malware”, which we call UP007 based on an identifier in the malware’s network traffic. In a\n\n[report released today, ASERT describes a series of campaigns targeting Tibetan, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese interests,](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/four-element-sword-engagement)\n\nwhich also includes details on the same UP007 sample we analyze.\n\n[A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report includes analysis of the SLServer sample we analyze (PwC refers to the](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/03/taiwant-election-targetting.html)\n\nfamily as SunOrcal). We refer to the malware as SLServer due to a resource dialog in the file. These previous reports\n\n[collected samples from VirusTotal. We received the original email lure and samples used in the campaign from a](https://www.virustotal.com/)\n\ntargeted source, and found that both UP007 and SLServer were sent to targets in the same attack.\n\nThis research note builds on previous reporting by more closely examining UP007 and SLServer, variations of these samples\n\nfound “in the wild”, and the connections between these attacks and other campaigns. Previous reports have shown\n\noverlap in the tactics, techniques, and procedures used in this campaign in other operations targeting groups in Burma,\n\nHong Kong, and the Tibetan community. We speculate that either a single threat actor is targeting these groups or some\n\nlevel of formal or informal resource sharing is occurring between the operators behind the campaigns.\n\n# Espionage Campaign Targeting Hong Kong Activists\n\nIn the week prior to the January 2016 Taiwanese General Election, Hong Kong-based pro-democracy activists received a\n\ntargeted email purporting to come from a Taiwanese non-profit organization with information about the upcoming\n\n[election. The email included a Google Drive link to a RAR archive file: “2016總統選舉民情中心預測值.rar”, which](http://www.rarlab.com/)\n\ntranslates to “Predictive Forecast from Centre of Public Sentiment in 2016 Presidential Elections.rar”.\n\nFi 1 T ti il t t H K d ti i t\n\n\n-----\n\nTo recipients: Jinshen Tu, Zhifeng Huang, and Xiuxian Zhang. The 2016 general election enters its crucial final 10 days,\n\nand 73 electoral districts conclude their voting (1041229); Centre of Public Sentiment’s predicted forecast in the\n2016 presidential elections (104.12.28).\n\nThe 2016 Election enters its crucial final 10 days. On the 6th, Ing-wen Tsai, the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party)\n\ncandidate, called on DPP supporters to consolidate their votes. She warned that the intense internal competition\n\nwithin the DPP had caused people to be worried about a splitting of the votes, potentially leading to the loss of the\n15th and 16th seats.\n\nThe election day is on the 16th. Besides the presidential election, there is also the legislative election which includes\n\ndistrict seats and non-district seats. There are 34 non-district seats in total, of which the DPP won 13 during the last\n\nelection. Given the higher degree of support this time, the DPP should be able to secure 16 seats. But as the New\nPower Party’s (NPP) influence and support grows, it might threaten the DPP.\n\nIn order to promote support for non-district legislators, the DPP Central Standing Committee organized a campaign\n\nevent this afternoon. The chairwoman of the DPP, Ing-wen Tsai, said there are only ten days left before the election,\n\nand the three things she worried the most about were: 1) ballot bribery, which may cause DPP’s loss in certain\nswing areas; 2) whether young people would return home to vote on Jan 16th; 3) vote splitting that may lead good\n\ncandidates to lose in non-district legislative elections.\n\nPredictive Forecast from Centre of Public Sentiment in the 2016 Presidential Elections.rar\n\n\n# Delivery Mechanism\n\nWe have observed the use of Google Drive links as a delivery vector in recent campaigns targeting Tibetan\n\n[organizations. In these campaigns, Google Drive links were used to send malware and phishing pages. We have also](https://citizenlab.org/2015/06/targeted-attacks-against-tibetan-and-hong-kong-groups-exploiting-cve-2014-4114/)\n\nseen the tactic used in recent espionage campaigns targeting an NGO working on environmental issues in Southeast\n\nAsia. The prior use of Google Drive as a delivery vector against Tibetan groups is significant, as Tibetan groups are\n\n[promoting Google Drive as an alternative to sending file attachments to prevent infection from document-based](https://www.cybersuperhero.net/safer-file-sharing/)\n\nmalware.\n\n## Examining the RAR Archive\n\nWithin the linked RAR archive, the top three directories contain a mix of malicious and benign documents, as well as\n\nshortcuts that run two executables that are deeply nested within hidden directories in the archive. The file structure of this\n\narchive is shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: File structure of delivered RAR archive.\n\nThe top level directory of this archive contains a benign Word document named 聲明.doc, which translates to\n\n“Statement.doc”. The text of this document is written in Chinese and is related to the Taiwanese election.\n\n\n**Document Text:**\n\n73個立委選區選情研判(1041229),\n\n2016總統選舉民情中心預測值(104.12.28).\n\n文件內容僅代表個人立場，僅供參閱。解壓選舉民情中心預測值到桌面即可查閱全部數據.\n\n**English Translation:**\n\nElection polling of 73 legislative electoral districts（12/29/104).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first two directories contain separate Windows shortcuts, each of which runs an executable that is nested down in\n\nseven hidden subdirectories. Table 1 shows details of the two executables contained in this nested directory along with\n\ntheir detection rate by antivirus vendors according to VirusTotal.\n\n**Filename** **Sample MD5** **AV Detection Rate**\n\nfzyy.exe [d579d7a42ff140952da57264614c37bc](https://virustotal.com/en/file/5b875ecf0b7f67a4429aeaa841eddf8e6b58771e16dbdb43ad6918aa7a5b582d/analysis/) Date / Time: 01­11­2016\n\nDetection Rate: 8/55\n\n[wzget.exe d8becbd6f188e3fb2c4d23a2d36d137b](https://virustotal.com/en/file/ddc05b9f39f579f64742980980ca9820b83a243889bbc5baa37f5c2c1c4beb30/analysis/) Date / Time: 03­21­2016\n\nDetection Rate: 30/57\n\nTable 1: Sample overview\n\nThese samples, when executed, create two separate infection chains. The lack of emphasis on tricking targets into\n\nrunning a single malicious file is interesting. We are unsure as to why the operators chose to deploy two separate infection\n\nchains within the same delivery mechanism. It is also unclear why the benign document was included at the top\n\ndirectory, as this would require more user interaction for a compromise to be successful. It is possible that this mixture of\n\nbenign and malicious files is intended to lull the targets into a false sense of security.\n\nWithin the archive there are two Microsoft Word files: 2016總統選舉民情中心預測值.doc (translation: “Predictive forecast\n\nfrom Centre of Public Sentiment in 2016 Presidential Elections”) and 73個立委選區選情研判.doc (translation: “Election\n\npolling of 73 legislative electoral districts”). Despite having different filenames, they are the same file (MD5 hash:\n\n[09ddd70517cb48a46d9f93644b29c72f). This infected document was analyzed in the recent PwC report and the malware](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/03/taiwant-election-targetting.html)\n\nfamily was named SunOrcal by the researchers. In this report we take a closer look at the two nested executables:\n\nfzyy.exe and wzget.exe and the two separate infection chains they produce.\n\n# UP007 Malware Family\n\nThe fzyy.exe executable is a dropper responsible for creating multiple files and starting this particular infection chain.\n\nWhen the file is run it creates the following files in the directory: %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\\n\n**Filename** **MD5** **Purpose**\n\nconhost.exe f70b295c6a5121b918682310ce0c2165 Loads SBieDll.dll\n\nSBieDll.dll f80edbb0fcfe7cec17592f61a06e4df2 Loads maindll.dll\n\nmaindll.dll d8ede9e6c3a1a30398b0b98130ee3b38 Loads dll2.xor\n\ndll2.xor ce8ec932be16b69ffa06626b3b423395 Payload\n\nrunas.exe 6a541de84074a2c4ff99eb43252d9030 Establishes persistence; Not utilized in this loading chain\n\nnvsvc.exe e0eb981ad6be0bd16246d5d442028687 Unknown – possibly older component\n\nTable 2: Executable infection chain for fzyy.exe\n\nThese files are all initially stored as resources within fzyy.exe. Some of the files are stored in encoded form while\n\nmaindll.dll is stored as a packed executable. When writing the files to disk, the dropper will decode and write the files\n\nstored in encoded form. In addition the infection chain will check multiple registry keys before writing maindll.dll.\n\n[The keys largely seem to check for the presence of popular Chinese antivirus products: 360 Security, Kingsoft Antivirus,](https://www.360totalsecurity.com/en/)\n\n[Rising AV, Jiangmin, and Micropoint as well as a popular free antivirus product Avira. Interestingly, in this instance, even if](http://www.rising-global.com/)\n\nthe registry keys are present, maindll.dll will still be written and the infection chain will still continue. The registry keys that\n\nare checked by the infection chain are summarized in Table 3.\n\n**Key** **Subkey**\n\n|Filename|Sample MD5|AV Detection Rate|\n|---|---|---|\n|fzyy.exe|d579d7a42ff140952da57264614c37bc|Date / Time: 01­11­2016 Detection Rate: 8/55|\n|wzget.exe|d8becbd6f188e3fb2c4d23a2d36d137b|Date / Time: 03­21­2016 Detection Rate: 30/57|\n\n|Filename|MD5|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|conhost.exe|f70b295c6a5121b918682310ce0c2165|Loads SBieDll.dll|\n|SBieDll.dll|f80edbb0fcfe7cec17592f61a06e4df2|Loads maindll.dll|\n|maindll.dll|d8ede9e6c3a1a30398b0b98130ee3b38|Loads dll2.xor|\n|dll2.xor|ce8ec932be16b69ffa06626b3b423395|Payload|\n|runas.exe|6a541de84074a2c4ff99eb43252d9030|Establishes persistence; Not utilized in this loading chain|\n|nvsvc.exe|e0eb981ad6be0bd16246d5d442028687|Unknown – possibly older component|\n\n\n-----\n\nHKCU\\Software\\360safe DefaultSkin\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\kingsoft\\Antivirus WorkPath\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Avira\\Avira Destop Path\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\rising\\RAV installpath\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\JiangMin InstallPath\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Micropoint\\Anti-Attack MP100000\n\nTable 3: Registry keys that fzyy.exe checks for before writing maindll.dll\n\nOnce all the files are created, conhost.exe starts, loads SBieDll.dll, then ultimately loads maindll.dll and the final\n\npayload, which we have named UP007 (dll2.xor) due to an identifier in the network traffic. The primary function of\n\nUP007 appears to be to log keystrokes to the %USERPROFILE%\\Local Settings\\Temp\\keylog\\ directory and send\n\nthem to a remote server.\n\n[UP007 uses Windows Sockets to communicate with its command and control server (C2). While doing so, it sends a](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms738545%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\n\nhardcoded HTTP header disguised as Microsoft Update traffic. This is likely an attempt to escape notice by casual\n\ninspection of network traffic. On connection, UP007 downloads another payload directly from the C2 server. This\n\nsecondary payload we have named “DownLoad” given the way it identifies itself in the traffic with the C2 server. This\n\nsecondary payload is injected into memory. The initial network traffic observed from the UP007 sample is seen in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: Network capture of the initial communication by UP007.\n\nOnce the entire payload is received from the C2 server, UP007 sends basic system information such as operating system\n\nversion, IP address, and username and the C2 responds with a “READY” announcement (see Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4: Network capture of the infected system sending system information to the C2.\n\nThe secondary payload (DownLoad) initiates its own separate TCP connection with the C2 server. A sample of the\n\nnetwork traffic of this secondary payload is seen in Figure 5.\n\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\kingsoft\\Antivirus|WorkPath|\n|---|---|\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Avira\\Avira Destop|Path|\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\rising\\RAV|installpath|\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\JiangMin|InstallPath|\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Micropoint\\Anti-Attack|MP100000|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Network capture of DownLoad connection to the C2.\n\nUnfortunately, even though the connection with the C2 was established, we did not observe any further activity from this\n\npayload. However, DownLoad’s strings show references to the following:\n\n\nthis is cmd\nthis is Desktop\n\n\nIt is possible these are in reference to additional components or capabilities of the malware. Further analysis is required to\n\ndetermine the function of these components.\n\n## UP007 Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nThe command and control server for the UP007 sample is hosted on Hong Kong provider New World Telecom at the IP\n\n[address 59.188.12[.]123. Passive DNS data from PassiveTotal indicates that the domain name yeaton.xicp[.]net](https://www.passivetotal.org/)\n\n[pointed to this IP from January 8 2016 to March 19 2016. In their recent report ASERT notes that the domain:](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/four-element-sword-engagement)\n\n[yeaton.xicp[.]net was used to advertise a Chinese VPN service in 2012. However, as ASERT explains given the long](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/four-element-sword-engagement)\n\nperiod between the use of the domain for advertising and the recent threat activity the past uses of the domain may not\n\nbe related to the threat actors.\n\n## UP007 Samples and Variations\n\n[In November 2013, an exploit document (MD5: 983333e2c878a62d95747c36748198f0) was uploaded to various malware](https://virustotal.com/en/file/ef97f13f49266a170f4d334482376bb31335fc323ed80917b9943207ff75f750/analysis/)\n\nsites with the filename 中国国家安全委员会机构设置和人员名单提前曝光.docx (which translates to “Chinese National\n\nSecurity Council’s Institutional Structure and Member list”) and 131106 minutes.docx. Instead of receiving the Stage\n\n2 binary in the C2 protocol as in the recent UP007 sample, the November 2013 sample directly requested ok.exe via an\n\nHTTP GET request to 103.19.85[.]89. The ok.exe sample communicated with tenday.mysecondarydns[.]com which\n\nresolved to 103.19.85[.]89.

This IP is hosted in Taiwan on the hosting provider Chunghwa Telecom, specifically their Data Communication](http://www.cht.com.tw/en/aboutus/aboutcht.html)\n\nBusiness Group offering. It appears to host the site of a Taiwanese auto parts manufacturer, Yowjung Autoparts. This site\n\nmay have been either compromised or copied from a legitimate source.\n\n[The domain name security-centers.comwas registered on September 11 2015 by the e-mails: janmiller-](https://whois.domaintools.com/security-centers.com)\n\ndomain@googlemail[.]com and an_ardyth@123mail[.]org. Using Passive DNS data we find the following subdomains\n\nwere used in the time period after domain registration:\n\n\nsafetyssl.security-centers[.]com\n\ncomputer.security-centers[.]com\n\nsecurity-centers[.]com\n\nwww.security-centers[.]com\n\n\n[The domain computer.security-centers[.]com was a C2 server previously reported by ASERT related to a sample of](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ASERT-Threat-Intelligence-Brief-2015-08-Uncovering-the-Seven-Pointed-Dagger.pdf)\n\nthe Trochilus RAT analyzed in the report. ASERT retrieved that sample from the compromised Myanmar Union Election\n\nCommission website. The other subdomains (www and the the top level security-centers[.]com) are likely the default\n\nIP addresses for GoDaddy registered domains.

The focus of the report\n\nwas on the discovery of the new Trochilus RAT. However, one of the RAR files was noted as unknown malware. This sample\n\n(Security-Patch-Update.exe, MD5: 82896b68314d108141728a4112618304) is also UP007, signed with the 5D 11 78 4F\n\nB8 17 65 02 3F 89 A4 F4 24 3F E1 A9 certificate and configured to communicate with 59.188.12[.]123 directly\n\nover port 8008, identical to fzyy.exe mentioned above. In this instance, if any of the previously discussed registry keys\n\nwere present, the sample will execute the dropped runas.exe binary. Given this execution, nvsvc.exe is likely also an\n\nolder component. As discussed above the UP007 sample we analyzed shares the same C2 (computer.security\n[centers[.]com) as the Trochilus RAT sample reported by ASERT.](http://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/uncovering-the-seven-pointed-dagger/)\n\n[In November 2015, Palo Alto Networks reported on a newly discovered trojan referred to as Bookworm. They revealed a](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/11/attack-campaign-on-the-government-of-thailand-delivers-bookworm-trojan/)\n\ncampaign focused on the targeting of government entities in Thailand. The campaign used a malware family known as\n\nFFRAT, and the sample described in the report connected to the domain hkemail.f3322[.]org for command and\n\ncontrol. In August 2015, the same domain was reportedly used to host an instance of UP007 as well.\n\nFinally, the relationship between the SLServer C2 www.olinaodi[.]com and our previous research into the Surtr malware\n\nfamily was highlighted by PwC through the overlap in the toucan6712@163[.]com registrant. We tracked malware\n\ncampaigns using the Surtr family that have targeted Tibetan organizations since 2013.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis latest espionage campaign against Hong Kong activists appears to be connected to a broader set of targets, and\n\n[operations. The recent detailed reporting by ASERT makes it clear that the UP007 malware family has been found in](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ASERT-Threat-Intelligence-Brief-2015-08-Uncovering-the-Seven-Pointed-Dagger.pdf)\n\nprevious campaigns targeting Burmese interests. In addition, the campaigns share some C2 infrastructure with previous\n\noperations against targets in Thailand and the Tibetan community. The domain registration connections between\n\nSLServer infrastructure and Surtr infrastructure also suggests some level of potential coordination between campaigns\n\ntargeting Hong Kong groups and the Tibetan community. Despite these connections, it is unclear if these campaigns are\n\nbeing conducted by the same threat actor.\n\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that distinct operators have a degree of sharing of tools and infrastructure.\n\n[Alternatively, security researcher Ned Moran has articulated a concept of a “digital quartermaster,” to refer to an](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-malware-supply-chain.pdf)\n\nactor that supplies threat infrastructure and malware development resources to multiple groups. While these scenarios\n\nare plausible, we do not have enough data to properly assess these competing hypotheses, or to make conclusive\n\nstatements about the identity of the threat actors.\n\nWhat is clear from our analysis is that civil society groups across Asia continue to be targeted by persistent and organized\n\ncyber espionage campaigns. Civil society often lack the resources and awareness to defend against these operations\n\nand closer attention to the threats they face is needed\n\n|MD5|First Submission|C2|\n|---|---|---|\n|d07b2738840ce3419df651d3a0a3a246|2016­02­25 01:14:15|www.olinaodi[.]com (74.126.181[.]10)|\n|397021af7c0284c28db65297a6711235|2016­02­22 18:30:19|safetyssl.security­centers[.]com (210.61.12[.]153)|\n|dc195d814ec16fe91690b7e949e696f6|2016­02­17 11:32:02|www.olinaodi[.]com (74.126.181[.]10)|\n|cfcd2a90e87156e1a811f9c7b0051002|2015­11­09 05:20:33|safetyssl.security­centers[.]com (211.255.32[.]130)|\n\n\n-----\n\n[Special thanks to Valkyrie-X Security Research Group and ASERT.
