They refer to Rad as ‘HORTUM’.\n\n- Following the trail of ‘Datalink Analiz’, we suspect that EGoManiac activity\n\nincludes the use of HackingTeam’s Remote Control System (RCS) contracted\n\nunder this same front company with a series of irregularities as early as 2011.\n\n- In 2013, a report emerged on the use of RCS against a Turkish victim in\n\nthe United States. The victim voiced an unverified suspicion that its use\n\nrepresented the unsanctioned interests of rogue Gülenist elements within\n\nthe Turkish government.\n\n#### S e n t i n e l L a b s Te a m\n\n\n-----\n\n### THE HUNT FOR AHTAPOT\n\n\nIn the world of cyberespionage research, the human-interest element is often lost amidst a barrage\n\nof technical indicators. The absence of a human dimension can make our research seem overly\n\ntechnical and dry, something we write for defenders to block and other researchers to enjoy. When\n\nwe can see the impact that some of these campaigns have on civil society and the weakening of\n\npublic institutions, it invokes a certain doggedness that won’t let sleeping dogs lie. ‘EGoManiac’\n\nis one that’s been in the back of our heads for the past five years. The research involved multiple\n\ndead ends, false starts, and layers of conspiratorial mystery.\n\nWhat we refer to as EGoManiac is a cluster of two notable campaigns starting as early as 2010.\n\nThe first campaign came to be known in research circles as ‘Octopus Brain’, based on the Turkish\n\nstrings ‘Ahtapot’ and ‘Bejin’ left in the malware. This original campaign used a combination of\n\npublicly available RATs (including Turkojan and Bandook) as well as the closed-source Ahtapot,\n\nwith delivery methods ranging from malicious documents to personal visits by the attackers.\n\nOur initial awareness of this case came from Turkish court documents surrounding arrests of\n\njournalists at OdaTV. Much greater detail came to light thanks to the excellent work of the folks at\n\n[Arsenal Consulting. Their forensic investigation not only proved the presence of the malware and](https://arsenalexperts.com/Case-Studies/Odatv/)\n\nthe physical interdiction of the victim systems, but also established the attacker’s access as the\n\ndefinitive source of the incriminating documents on those systems that were then used to justify\n\narrests by the Turkish National Police. The journalists were ultimately acquitted by a court in\n\n2017– six years after the attacks.\n\nThis scenario is one of the often-ignored dirty edge cases of ‘lawful intercept’ malware, stated\n\n\nplainly: what’s the expectation of evidential integrity when it comes to an infected device?\n\n\n1\n\n\nWhile these particular operators resorted to physically tampering with the devices they were\n\nmonitoring, there’s little keeping malware operators from placing incriminating or damaging files on\n\nsystems infected with malware that has file download capabilities, as most rudimentary malware does.\n\nIn the face of such an unscrupulous actor, we are left to wonder if this activity is part of a cluster\n\nwe already track, and if not, what else has this actor been up to in the shadows? Octopus Brain\n\nprovided few answers. Despite finding a handful of Ahtapot modules, there were no newer samples\n\nnor connections to other toolkits. The trail went cold… until now.\n\n1This question is currently playing out further in the Bhima Koregaon case in India, where it appears malware was used to\n\n[upload incriminating letters onto the victim’s machine– https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-bhima-](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-bhima-koregaon-activists-jailed/2021/02/10/8)\n\n[koregaon-activists-jailed/2021/02/10/8087f172-61e0-11eb-a177-7765f29a9524_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-bhima-koregaon-activists-jailed/2021/02/10/8)\n\n\n-----\n\n### EXPERIMENTS IN INNOVATIVE PIVOTING\n\n\nAs threat hunting technology continued to improve, there were different attempts to once again\n\npick up the scent of the attackers behind the Octopus Brain campaign. Code similarity analysis is\n\none of the favorite tools in our research arsenal. However, initial attempts to cluster new samples\n\nbased on shared unique code snippets were not fruitful.\n\nWe decided to take a different approach. Rather than focusing on unique code snippets, we can\n\ninstead focus on a bulk of shared common code as a way of profiling the development environment\n\nthat produced the samples and attempt to find other samples produced in the same way– same\n\ncompiler, same optimizations, relying on the same statically-linked libraries, etc. Limited testing\n\nof this method has yielded positive results under specific circumstances – like allowing us to\n\ncluster a set of samples based off of the analysis of a single original sample and without needing\n\nto spend cycles conducting extensive goodware testing.\n\nFig 1: Ahtapot campaign components connect to newer Rad toolkit\n\n\n-----\n\nTo our surprise, applying this experimental approach to Octopus Brain yielded results. By generating\n\na rule based off of the bulk of common code of Ahtapot components, we stumbled upon a set of\n\nsamples we’ll call ‘Rad’, based on a persistent typo in symbol paths left within the binaries.\n\n\nExpanding on this initial finding, we found a cluster of more than 50 samples and subcomponents\n\nfor a modular espionage toolkit almost entirely undetected at the time of discovery.\n\nFig 2: Unique code segment connecting Ahtapot and Rad campaigns\n\nOur friends at Kaspersky’s GReAT were able to blind confirm our finding using their KTAE\n\nattribution engine, honing in on a unique code segment shared by the first-stage components\n\nof both Ahtapot and Rad.\n\n\n-----\n\n### EGOMANIAC’S ‘RAD’ TOOLKIT\n\nRad is a modular espionage malware toolkit built around the [POCO C++](https://pocoproject.org/)\n\ncross-platform development libraries. The design entails a form of\n\norganized development but not a particularly savvy or sophisticated\n\none at that. POCO is doing most of the heavy lifting. Functionality is\n\nsplit into modules contained within a ‘RadApplicationInstaller’ and\n\norchestrated by a ‘RadStarter’ module that takes its cues from an\n\nencrypted configuration XML file.\n\nFig 3: Extracted Rad configuration XML\n\n(92abdfa8d72cd42f6e6f3ad903380df5397e6ea8328c47422f8e016ee204f3bc)\n\nThe XML tells Rad which modules to switch on or off, specific\n\nconfigurations like the time intervals for screen captures and max\n\nfilesize for sound recordings, and most importantly – what email to\n\nuse for exfiltration. All of the Rad samples we’ve found rely on email\n\nexfiltration with a hardcoded address belonging to either Gmail,\n\nYandex, or Woxmail (defunct at the time of writing). This style of\n\nexfiltration entails both pros and cons for the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nPros:\n\n  - Email traffic is unlikely to be blocked or considered suspicious in the target environment\n\n  - There’s no obvious infrastructure for defenders to track, pivot on, or sinkhole for victim data\n\nCons:\n\n  - Exfiltrated data is subject to size limitations\n\n  - Exfiltrated data is available to the hosting providers as well as anyone able to reverse\n\n\nengineer the malware configuration\n\n\n2\n\n\nThe more bizarre angle of the malware’s functionality is its lack of command-and-control\n\ncapabilities. The malware will follow its original configuration without recourse to additional\n\ncommands, updates, or changes. This is perhaps the most unusual aspect of the malware.\n\nExfiltration via email is unlikely to be favored by an experienced group operating on the world\n\nstage. It’s perhaps more acceptable to mercenaries or a regionally focused threat group. In this\n\ncase, rather than cause another research dead-end, one of those email addresses might provide\n\n\nthe greatest attribution connection of all, more on that later.\n\n\n3\n\n\n2It’s worth noting that the attackers obfuscated the exfiltrated data to provide some level of protection against third-party\n\nprying eyes and fourth-party collection.\n\n3See §A Wilderness of Mirrors.\n\n\n-----\n\n### TOOLKIT STRUCTURE\n\nFig 4\n\nThe execution flow of the Rad toolkit is straightforward. ‘wsms.exe’ (RadStarter) is the main\n\nmodule that runs from a registry key set by the installer. It, in turn, runs the other modules as\n\nseparate processes. These include:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main package also includes the POCO dependency DLLs used by\n\nthe modules:\n\n  - PocoFoundation.dll is the core dependency\n\n  - PocoCrypto.dll wraps OpenSSL library APIs\n\n  - PocoXML.dll provides XML parsing primitives\n\n  - PocoNet.dll and PocoNetSSL.dll are communication libraries\n\nbased on socket and SSL APIs, respectively.\n\nThis is not the first malware family developed using the POCO C++ libraries.\n\nRussian APTs have relied on POCO in the past, including a [downloader](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2019/08/inside-the-apt28-dll-backdoor-blitz)\n\n[associated with APT28 (‘PocoDown’) and the fabled Drovorub.](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/13/2002476465/-1/-1/0/CSA_DROVORUB_RUSSIAN_GRU_MALWARE_AUG_2020.PDF)\n\n### DEVELOPMENT NOTES\n\nThe modules’ internal names are derived from PDB paths consistently\n\nleft within the binaries, allowing for an appreciation of the developers’\n\norganizational skills and lack of regard for operational security. This sets\n\nthe general tone for Rad’s development consisting of straightforward\n\nmethod implementations around standard APIs. Screen capture relies\n\non GDI APIs, keylogging is done via GetAsyncKeyState, and sound\n\nrecording is done via a multimedia library. Binaries are not obfuscated\n\nand export names are in plaintext.\n\nCharitably, the developers may have intended to avoid arousing the\n\nsuspicion of anti-malware software by doing everything in a documented\n\nand innocent looking way devoid of evasion. Low detection numbers at\n\nthe time of discovery support the value of this approach. However, the\n\nloud multi-process structure of the malware and absence of checks for\n\nsecurity software on target systems suggest the developers are simply\n\ninexperienced in the world of malware development.\n\nFurther supporting the general timeline of the Rad campaign,\n\ndevelopment of the main Rad components was carried out using Visual\n\nStudio 2010 and dependency DLLs built in 2012. As with all compilation\n\ntimestamps, it’s possible that these were altered.\n\n\n-----\n\n### INFECTION VECTORS\n\nWe were only able to recover a small subset of infection vectors utilized by EGoManiac to place the\n\n\nRad malware on target systems. In one case, we see an email\n\nlocal telecommunications provider:\n\n\n4 in Turkish pretending to be from a\n\n\n6, roughly translated\n\n\nThe email contains a zip archive\n\n\n5 with the executable ‘Turkcell_hediye.exe’\n\n\nto ‘Turkcell Gift’. The executable is a straightforward RadApplicationInstaller package meant to\n\ninfect the victim with no attempt at displaying a lure or feigning benign functionality for the user.\n\n\nAdditional early-stage droppers include a RAR archive named ‘gercekler.rar’\n\n\n7 (containing an\n\n\nexecutable of the same name), as well as a variant that actually displays a lure for the victim\n\n(internally referred to as FileTrojen). The lure is a Turkish PowerPoint presentation on the\n\ndevelopment of management skills. The malware is connected to EGoManiac via a consistent PDB\n\npath convention. FileTrojen appears to be an earlier version of the Rad FileSystemModule built\n\nbefore the adoption of the POCO C++ libraries. It includes functionality for tracking USB keys\n\nconnected to victim systems and their contents.\n\nFig 5: FileTrojen configuration headers\n\nInterestingly, the configuration for this variant is encapsulated within the tags ‘SPARTACUS_\n\nSTART_V1.0’ and ‘SPARTACUS_END’ perhaps suggesting its internal naming convention.\n\n45e02f7d0337750be8dd36c96638b8f44127d6fdabe5d7ae04b11fd3ca2d14de4, Turkcell Müşteri Hizmetleri.eml\n\n5dd60b8f2144de64ed1e2182d511d68ca0c60e1de0d8fa4a6bf80c9701c0ced52, turkcell_hediye.zip\n\n63d3f208e54da010a571bc53296621428786cecb624f4c433d83dd4f40908820c, turkcell_hediye.exe\n\n74cbb8e0bde66af241819c7492db0a9084b9c504dc3f69b7d8e5ef77198008991, gercekler.rar\n\n\n-----\n\n### WHO IS EGOMANIAC?\n\nAttribution based solely on technical indicators is complicated and inexact. Most technical\n\nindicators are subject to modification and require interpretation based on limited visibility. Lacking\n\na greater understanding of local context and closed-source intelligence, it’s difficult to extend\n\nattribution beyond abstract entities (like an APT group name) to specific people or organizations.\n\nOn the surface, EGoManiac activity revolves around a Turkish nexus. Malware is riddled with\n\nTurkish language, lures are written in Turkish, victims are Turkish and relevant to local politics.\n\nThe connection to Ahtapot and the OdaTV incident entails the actor’s ability to physically interdict\n\nsystems within Turkey. Additionally, most PDB paths for Rad components have a root folder of\n\n[‘EGM’, from which we derived the name ‘EGoManiac’.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Directorate_of_Security_(Turkey))\n\n\nThree samples deviate from this PDB naming convention to use a root folder of ‘SEA’\n\n\n8, a reference\n\n\nto the Syrian Electronic Army. This association is further reinforced by the inclusion of throwaway\n\nstrings like ‘Syrian Electronic Army’, ‘sea.sy’, and ‘Codename Assad’ in the binaries. The compilation\n\ntimestamp maps onto the emergence of the Syrian Electronic Army in late 2011. This is likely an\n\nearly attempt at misdirection and is not sustained in any of the later samples.\n\nAs we dig deeper into this Turkish nexus, the attribution angle only gets more complicated.\n\n8bcd5e2ac31b250e665691487f8eda0d2d170a4f31fad0aba158f73445351654f,\n\n0a9357e9db888a601ade886fb54fa4eacdcfee72e3145dfbb26ae9492abfd877,\n\n3d3f208e54da010a571bc53296621428786cecb624f4c433d83dd4f40908820c.\n\n\n-----\n\n### A WILDERNESS OF MIRRORS\n\nEGoManiac’s Rad toolkit relies on hardcoded email addresses for communication. Obfuscated logs\n\nand other exfiltrated materials are sent to the following emails across multiple service providers:\n\nWhile email comms might usually lead to another research dead-end, the address ‘johndown@\n\nwoxmail.com’ raised an interesting connection.\n\nIn 2016, Turkish websites reported sparse details of an ongoing attempt to prosecute members\n\nof the Turkish national police and executives of an IT company called ‘Datalink’ suspected of\n\nleaking information on active police operations. The leaks were reportedly used by FETO/Gülenist\n\nmovement social media accounts to fuel conspiratorial elements in an ongoing power struggle\n\nwithin the country.\n\nReports cite the use of spyware called ‘HORTUM’ (roughly translated as ‘garden hose’) to siphon\n\ndata from infected machines within public institutions in Turkey including the Intelligence\n\ndepartment of the General Directorate of Security (EGM). Some of the reporting mistakenly\n\nconflates HORTUM with HackingTeam’s RCS. The siphoned data was sent to ‘johndown@\n\nwoxmail.com’ and from there allegedly redistributed by Datalink. The capabilities of HORTUM\n\nand its communication methods match those of EGoManiac’s Rad, including the hardcoded\n\nWoxmail address.\n\nFig 6: Encrypted configuration using johndown@woxmail for exfiltration\n(b79df7817ac1f39692927a593bf0569fd57e3faaebbbf4a0c7b452e7928157cb)\n\n[We cannot independently verify the veracity of the initial reporting. An independent investigation](https://zetter.substack.com/p/hacking-team-customer-in-turkey-was)\n\n[to that effect was conducted by Kim Zetter, who obtained extensive details including a report](https://zetter.substack.com/p/hacking-team-customer-in-turkey-was)\n\n[by the prosecutor handling the case. Taking the information we have at face value, we uncover](https://zetter.substack.com/p/hacking-team-customer-in-turkey-was)\n\nanother possible facet of the EGoManiac story.\n\n\n-----\n\n### THE HACKING TEAM CONNECTION\n\n\nAs early as 2012, victims of HackingTeam’s Remote Control System (RCS) ‘Da Vinci’ [began to show](https://securelist.com/spyware-hackingteam/37064/)\n\n[up in Turkey. In 2013, Wired reported that](https://securelist.com/spyware-hackingteam/37064/) [a woman in the United States was targeted with RCS.](https://www.wired.com/2013/06/spy-tool-sold-to-governments/)\n\nThe victim suspected that she was targeted by Gülenist elements that had infiltrated the Turkish\n\ngovernment. However, HackingTeam continued to assert that it only sells its tools to governments and\n\ndid not confirm Turkey’s status as a customer. Now, in the aftermath of Phineas Fisher’s devastating\n\nhack-and-leak operation against HackingTeam, we can independently confirm that Turkey was in fact\n\na customer of HackingTeam at the time –but who exactly was their customer in Turkey?\n\n[Fig 7: Leaked HackingTeam email on an invoice confusion involving](https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/584566)\n\nan Istanbul company ‘Datalink Analiz’\n\nThe leaked HackingTeam treasure trove contains communications with officials claiming to be a part of\n\n[the Turkish National Police as early as 2011. Citing problems with their mail server, they proceed to use](https://www.wikileaks.com/hackingteam/emails/emailid/564943)\n\n\nthree Gmail accounts\n\n\n9 to plan their purchase of RCS. A Gmail account is also used for communication\n\n\n[with the HackingTeam support portal. HackingTeam officials note further irregularities as the first deal](https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/765131)\n\ngoes through. Though the purchase is intended under the umbrella of a UAE-based shell company\n\n(‘Foresys Information Technology-FZE’), HackingTeam receives payment from a company registered\n\nin Istanbul– ‘Datalink Analiz LTD’.\n\n9tnp.notcenter@gmail.com, tnpnotcenter2@gmail.com, akocak005@gmail.com\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 8: Revalence of EGoManiac-related malware families by compilation timestamp\n\nTo be thorough, we chart the use of Hacking Team RCS by the Turkish National Police (Appendix C)\n\nbased on the company’s internal watermarking scheme used to track the origin of leaked samples\n\namong their customer base. The graphic above notes the coincidental cadence of the use of the\n\ndifferent malware families related to the EGoManiac cluster. However, we can’t go as far as to equate\n\nthe two clusters without resolving the murky allegiances of the operators involved.\n\nThe connection between the EGoManiac umbrella and this specific sub-cluster of Hacking Team RCS\n\nis built on the admittedly thin strand of the ‘Datalink Analiz’ shell company. [That thread merits an](https://zetter.substack.com/p/hacking-team-customer-in-turkey-was)\n\n[investigation beyond the purely technical to straighten out an abundance of conspiratorial claims,](https://zetter.substack.com/p/hacking-team-customer-in-turkey-was)\n\n[alleged foreign money laundering, and ambiguous finger pointing.](https://zetter.substack.com/p/hacking-team-customer-in-turkey-was)\n\n\n-----\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nThe case of EGoManiac is far from straightforward. It involves difficult investigative connections\n\nthat test the boundaries of our visibility, the efficacy of our research tools, and the limits of purely\n\ntechnical attribution. Beyond the technical exercise, it’s a profile of a threat actor willing to spy on\n\nboth friend and foe and to use that access to malign and entrap journalists without compunction.\n\nWhile this particular intrusion set is outdated, the questions it raises speak to the friction between the\n\nunsupervised governmental use of malware and the integrity of public institutions, rule of law, and\n\nevidentiary standards. They are more relevant now than ever before.\n\n### REFERENCES\n\n1 : [h t t p s : // w w w.v i c e . c o m /e n /a r t i c l e / n z 74 w q / t u r k i s h - j o u r n a l i s t - j a i l e d -](https://www.vice.com/en/article/nz74wq/turkish-journalist-jailed-for-terrorism-was-framed-forensic-r)\n[f o r - t e r r o r i s m - w a s - f r a m e d - f o r e n s i c - r e p o r t - s h o w s - 1](https://www.vice.com/en/article/nz74wq/turkish-journalist-jailed-for-terrorism-was-framed-forensic-r)\n\n2 : [h t t p s : //a r s e n a l e x p e r t s . c o m / C a s e - S t u d i e s / O d a t v/](https://arsenalexperts.com/Case-Studies/Odatv/ )\n\n3 : [h t t p s : // w w w.v i c e . c o m /e n /a r t i c l e /e z p k j z /s o m e - m a l w a r e - v i c t i m s -](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ezpkjz/some-malware-victims-in-turkey-have-no-idea-theyve-been-targe)\n[i n - t u r k e y - h a v e - n o - i d e a - t h e y v e - b e e n - t a r g e t e d](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ezpkjz/some-malware-victims-in-turkey-have-no-idea-theyve-been-targe)\n\n4 : [h t t p s : //s e c u r e l i s t . c o m /s p y w a r e - h a c k i n g t e a m / 3 7 0 6 4 /](https://securelist.com/spyware-hackingteam/37064/ )\n\n5 : [h t t p s : //c i t i z e n l a b . c a / 2 0 1 4 / 0 2 / m a p p i n g - h a c k i n g - t e a m s -](https://citizenlab.ca/2014/02/mapping-hacking-teams-untraceable-spyware/ )\n[u n t r a c e a b l e - s p y w a r e /](https://citizenlab.ca/2014/02/mapping-hacking-teams-untraceable-spyware/ )\n\n6 : [h t t p s : // w w w.w i r e d . c o m / 2 0 1 3 / 0 6 /s p y - t o o l - s o l d - t o - g o v e r n m e n t s /](https://www.wired.com/2013/06/spy-tool-sold-to-governments/ )\n\n7 : [h t t p s : // w w w. d a i l y d o t . c o m /d e b u g / h a c k i n g - t e a m - t u r k e y/](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/hacking-team-turkey/ )\n\n8 : [h t t p s : // w w w. k a r a r. c o m /e m n i y e t e - p a r a l e l - c a s u s - h o r t u m u - 1 4 2 74 9](https://www.karar.com/emniyete-paralel-casus-hortumu-142749 )\n\n9 : [h t t p s : // w w w. k a r a r. c o m / p a r a l e l - s i z i n t i - c a s u s - h o r t u m d a n - 1 4 6 7 9 2](https://www.karar.com/paralel-sizinti-casus-hortumdan-146792 )\n\n[1 0 : h t t p : // w w w. a y o r u m . c o m / h a b e r _ o k u . a s p ?
