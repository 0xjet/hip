Table Of Contents:\nThe recent SolarWind’s hack which resulted in a backdoor version of their SolarWind Orion\nproduct which counts 33,000 customers has been all over the news in the past few weeks most things have been said and repeated, although there are few notes that I mentioned on\nTwitter which I would like to compile in a blogpost for perenniality.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to point out to the presence in the backdoor process blacklist (the full\n_[list can be found on Itay Cohen’s repository) of several processes that can be used for either:](https://github.com/ITAYC0HEN/SUNBURST-Cracked)_\n\ncreating system raw memory dump such as Belkasoft RAM Capturer,\nor creating Microsoft process crash dumps with some of the Sysinternals Tools such as\nProcDump or Process Explorer.\n```\n  13611814135072561278UL   /* procdump64 (ProcDump - RE/Malware analysis) */,\n  2810460305047003196UL   /* procdump (ProcDump - RE/Malware analysis) */,\n  2032008861530788751UL   /* processhacker (Process Hacker - RE/Malware\nanalysis) */,\n  27407921587843457UL    /* procexp64 (Process Explorer - RE/Malware analysis)\n*/,\n  6491986958834001955UL   /* procexp (Process Explorer - RE/Malware analysis)\n*/,\n  (...)\n  7775177810774851294UL   /* ramcapture64 (Ram Capturer - Forensics) */,\n  16130138450758310172UL   /* ramcapture (Ram Capturer - Forensics) */,\n\n```\n[This makes sense given how powerful memory analysis and](https://www.comae.com/dumpit/) [memory forensics are in](https://www.comae.com/dumpit/)\n[general, and memory imaging was also included as a DHS emergency directive (21-01).](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/)\n(Thanks to Andrew Case for sharing this on LinkedIn).\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nThis emergency directive requires the following actions:\nAgencies that have the expertise to take the following actions immediately must do so\nbefore proceeding to Action 2. Agencies without this capability shall proceed to\nAction 2.\na. Forensically image system memory and/or host operating systems hosting all\ninstances of SolarWinds Orion versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 HF1]. Analyze for new\nuser or service accounts, privileged or otherwise.\n\n```\nAlthough, memory was completly dismissed by the Microsoft DART team in their Advice for\nincident responders on recovery from systemic identity compromises blogpost:\n```\nAfter you validate that no persistence mechanisms created by the attacker exist or\nremain on your system, schedule a restart. This can assist with removing memory\nresident malware.\n\n```\n**BEFORE you validate persistence, you always want to create a Microsoft full memory crash**\ndump of the system (with DumpIt or any other tools) before rebooting. As an incident\nresponder, you should not omit any artifacts that may be useful for your investigation.\n\n[And the last point, I would like to highlight was a very good tweet from Kim Zetter:](https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1342200712093028354)\n\nNew: SolarWinds backdoor infected at least 15 entities in critical infrastructure incl\nelectric/oil/gas/manufacture + 3 managed service providers for crit infr. No evidence\nhackers used backdoor to enter but may be difficult to tell due to lack of logging\n[https://t.co/v3qnUMurEH](https://t.co/v3qnUMurEH)\n\n— Kim Zetter (@KimZetter) [December 24, 2020](https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1342200712093028354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nKim is highlighting a very important point here which is the lack of logging in the critical\n[infrastucture industry. Two years ago, we wrote about a new logging paradigm which we](https://www.comae.com/posts/rethinking-logging-for-critical-assets/)\nbelieve should be in place for critical assets across industries where instead of relying on\nlogs/events (that are often missing context and information) - to periodically make memory\nimages (such as Microsoft full memory crash dumps) and to archive them to be able to retroinvestigate critical incidents such as those that we have seen over the past years\n(DOUBLEPULSAR, SUNBURST etc.).\n\nIf you haven’t read it yet, go ahead: https://www.comae.com/posts/rethinking-logging-forcritical-assets/.\n\nWe are more than happy to share thoughts on this.\n\nIf you are interested by our [memory analysis platform Comae Stardust also feel free to reach](https://www.comae.com/malware-detection-analysis-platform/)\nout if you are interested in testing or a custom deployment instance.\n\n\n-----",
