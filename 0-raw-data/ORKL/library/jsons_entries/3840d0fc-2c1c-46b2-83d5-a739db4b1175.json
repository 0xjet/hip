In effect, the hackers exploit\nthe flaw to get access to the server, kill any existing malware, set up their own backdoor,\n[then block off the vulnerable code from future exploit attempts by mitigation.](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267679)\n\nObviously, this is less of a noble gesture and more of a way to keep others out of the pwned\nboxes.\n\n\"Upon gaining access to a vulnerable NetScaler device, this actor cleans up known malware\nand deploys NOTROBIN to block subsequent exploitation attempts,\" the FireEye team\nexplained.\n\n\"But all is not as it seems, as NOTROBIN maintains backdoor access for those who know a\nsecret passphrase. FireEye believes that this actor may be quietly collecting access to\nNetScaler devices for a subsequent campaign.\"\n\nThat the attackers would think to mitigate the bug is hardly surprising given the number of\nhackers believed to be scanning for and targeting the bug. It would make sense to take a\ncompromised server off the map, so to speak, for other groups trying to exploit the so-called\n'Shitrix' flaw.\n\nFireEye says it has yet to work out all the details of the attack, but it is believed that most of\nthe exploit is done through a single script. That script, delivered via an HTTP POST request,\nissues the commands to kill any cryptocurrency scripts running on the machine, creates a\ndirectory to stage the next phase of the attack, then downloads and runs the secondary\nNOTROBIN payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Patch now: Published Citrix applications leave networks of 'potentially 80,000' firms at risk from attackers\n\n[READ MORE](https://www.theregister.com/2019/12/23/patch_now_published_citrix_applications_leave_network_vulnerable_to_unauthorised_access/)\n\"Cryptocurrency miners are generally easy to identify—just look for the process utilizing\nnearly 100 per cent of the CPU,\" said FireEye. \"By uninstalling these unwanted utilities, the\nactor may hope that administrators overlook an obvious compromise of their NetScaler\ndevices.\"\n\nOnce the secondary payload has been downloaded and launched, it installs the backdoor for\nlater access by the attackers, then proceeds to launch a pair of scripts that both search out\nand delete known malware on the machine and monitor and block any incoming attempts to\nexploit the vulnerability.\n\n\"The mitigation works by deleting staged exploit code found within NetScaler templates\nbefore it can be invoked,\" FireEye's team explained. \"However, when the actor provides the\nhardcoded key during subsequent exploitation, NOTROBIN does not remove the payload.\nThis lets the actor regain access to the vulnerable device at a later time.\"\n\nWhile most vulnerable Citrix devices can be protected from attacks by applying the vendor's\n[mitigations, some will need to update their firmware in order for the protections to actually](https://www.theregister.com/2020/01/16/windows_citrix_patch_update/)\nwork. Citrix has promised a complete patch for the flaw by January 20. ®\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n\n-----\n\nExperts: AI should be recognized as inventors in patent law\n\nPlus: Police release deepfake of murdered teen in cold case, and more\n\n[Katyanna Quach Sat 28 May 2022 // 11:23 UTC 13](https://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Katyanna-Quach)\nIn-brief Governments around the world should pass intellectual property laws that grant\nrights to AI systems, two academics at the University of New South Wales in Australia\nargued.\n\nAlexandra George, and Toby Walsh, professors of law and AI, respectively, believe\nfailing to recognize machines as inventors could have long-lasting impacts on\neconomies and societies.\n\n\"If courts and governments decide that AI-made inventions cannot be patented, the\n[implications could be huge,\" they wrote in a comment article published in Nature.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01391-x)\n\"Funders and businesses would be less incentivized to pursue useful research using AI\ninventors when a return on their investment could be limited.
