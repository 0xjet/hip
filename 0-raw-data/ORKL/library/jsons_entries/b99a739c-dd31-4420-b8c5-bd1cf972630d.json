The growing issue of cybersecurity and its impact on ICS highlights fundamental risks to the Nation’s critical infrastructure. Effi­ ciently addressing ICS cybersecurity issues requires a clear understanding of the current security challenges and specific defensive countermeasures. A holistic approach—one that uses specific countermeasures implemented in layers to create an aggregated, risk-based security posture—helps to defend against cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities that could af­ fect these systems. This approach, often referred to as Defense in Depth, provides a flexible and useable framework for improving cybersecurity protection when applied to control systems.\n\n The concept of Defense in Depth is not new—many organizations already employ many of the Defense-in-Depth measures discussed in this document within their information technology (IT) infrastructures; how­ ever, they do not necessarily apply it to their ICS operations. In the past, most organizations did not see a need to do so. Legacy ICSs used obscure protocols and were largely considered “hack proof” because of their separation from IT and because of having physical protection measures in place. But with the convergence of IT and ICS architectures, recent high-profile intrusions have highlighted the potential risk to control sys­ tems.\n\n The last five years have brought a marked increase in concern regard­ ing the potential for cyber-based attacks on critical infrastructures, and the number of cyber-based incidents across critical infrastructure sectors that asset owners reported to ICS-CERT has risen. In response, both govern­ ment agencies and sector-specific regulatory authorities have issued cyber­ security guidance and imposed sanctions for noncompliance.\n\n The threat of an intrusion by malicious actors on critical infrastruc­ ture using computer-based exploits has also grown. A number of recent high-profile incidents have increased awareness of this threat and the indi­ viduals and groups who pursue it with malicious intent. The availability of ICS-specific security solutions has not kept up with the mounting threat, so organizations must deploy a robust Defense-in-Depth solution—making their systems unattractive targets to would-be attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ing mitigation strategies for specific cyber threats and direction on how to create a Defense-in-Depth security program for control system environ­ ments. The document presents this information in four parts: 1) “Back­ ground and Overview” outlines the current state of ICS cybersecurity and provides an overview of what defense in depth means in a control system context; 2) “ICS Defense-in-Depth Strategies” provides strategies for securing control system environments; 3) “Security Attacks” outlines how threat actors could carry out attacks against critical infrastructures and the potential impact to ICSs and networks; and 4)“Recommendations for Securing ICS” provides resources for securing ICSs based on the current state-of-the-art methods and lessons learned from ICS-CERT activities, national and sector-specific standards for ICS security, and tools and ser­ vices available through ICS-CERT and others that can be used to improve the security posture of ICS environments.\n\n This version modernizes and improves the flagship document issued in 2009, reflecting the evolution of control systems management, security practices, and change management within the ICS community, as well as addressing emerging threats to critical infrastructure. It is a living docu­ ment that provides an aggregated compendium of the current state of ICS security practices.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### KEY WORDS\n\n Cybersecurity, data diodes, Defense in Depth, demilitarized zones (DMZ), distributed control system (DCS), encryption, firewall, industrial control system (ICS), intrusion detection system (IDS), intelligent electronic device (IED), intrusion prevention system (IPS), patch management, policy and procedures, process control, programmable logic controller (PLC), security zones, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CONTENTS\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS..............................................................................................................................II\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY..........................................................................................................................

An increasing number of organizations are using networking technologies to enhance productivity\nand reduce costs by increasing the integration of external, business, and control system networks. How­\never, these integration strategies often expose mission-critical ICS to cyber threats through exploitation of\nexisting vulnerabilities in the connected networks, thus reducing the organization’s overall cybersecurity\nposture. This recommended practice document provides guidance for developing Defense in Depth strat­\negies for organizations that use control system networks while maintaining multitier information architec­\ntures that include critical ICS.\n\n###### 1.1  ICS Communications Technology Migration\n\nThe operational technologies that support critical infrastructure industries, such as manufacturing,\ntransportation, and energy, depend heavily on information systems for their monitoring and control.\nPhysical separation between corporate and control domains has, traditionally, provided the primary means\nof protecting ICS; however, this division offers very limited means for data sharing, data acquisition,\npeer-to-peer data exchange, or other business operations. In addition to physical separation, the technical\nsecurity of any given system within the control system domain relied on the fact that few, if any, under­\nstood the intricate architecture or the operational mechanics of the resources on the control system local\narea network (LAN). This “security through obscurity” concept generally worked well for environments\nthat had no external communication connections, thus allowing an organization to focus on physical\nsecurity. Modern control system architectures, business requirements, and cost control measures result in\nincreasing integration of corporate and ICS IT architectures. Physical separation alone no longer provides\na viable business option for managing, utilizing, or securing ICS.\n\n###### “Essentially, security by obscurity relies on the fact that a given vulnerability is hidden or secret as a security measure. Of course, if anyone or anything accidentally discovers the\n vulnerability, no real protection exists to prevent exploitation.”\n\n –Tony Bradley[1], Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP),\n Information Systems Security Architecture Professional (ISSAP)\n\nWhile a high dependence on legacy ICS technology still exists, many critical infrastructure system as­\nset owners are migrating to interconnected technologies. As a result, common communications protocols\nand open architecture standards are replacing the diverse and disparate proprietary mechanics for ICS.\nThis replacement can have both positive and negative impacts.\n\nOn the positive side, the migration empowers asset owners to access new and more efficient methods\nof communication as well as more robust data collection and aggregation methods, quicker time to mar­\nket, and interoperability. On the negative side, integration of control system architectures with contempo­\nrary IT-based computing and networking capabilities can introduce risks that did not previously exist with\nan isolated ICS. Enterprise IT protocols, communication standards, and networking technologies may pro­\nvide increased interoperability in the ICS environment; however, in many cases, the migration could also\nincrease risk exposure of the ICS through the application of the same technologies that threat actors have\nalready exploited and compromised on the Internet and corporate networking domains. Further, common\ncountermeasures implemented in enterprise networks to mitigate risk associated with these technologies\noften do not work in ICS environments. An increasing number of ICS-focused incidents have illustrated\n[the interdependence of ICS such as those in the public utility sector.](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/Monitors/ICS-CERT_Monitor_Jan-April2014.pdf)\n\n\n###### “Essentially, security by obscurity relies on the fact that a given vulnerability is hidden or secret as a security measure. Of course, if anyone or anything accidentally discovers the\n vulnerability, no real protection exists to prevent exploitation.”\n\n –Tony Bradley[1], Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP),\n Information Systems Security Architecture Professional (ISSAP)\n\n\n-----\n\nAn organization’s cybersecurity strategy should protect the assets that it deems critical to successful\noperation. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts, simple solutions, or “silver bullet” implementations to\nsolve cybersecurity vulnerabilities within critical infrastructure ICS. It requires a layered approach known\nas Defense in Depth.\n\nDefense in Depth as a concept originated in military strategy to provide barriers to impede the prog­\nress of intruders from attaining their goals while monitoring their progress and developing and imple­\nmenting responses to the incident in order to repel them. In the cybersecurity paradigm, Defense in Depth\ncorrelates to detective and protective measures designed to impede the progress of a cyber intruder while\nenabling an organization to detect and respond to the intrusion with the goal of reducing and mitigating\nthe consequences of a breach.\n\nDefense in Depth is not a one-to-one exercise, where an organization deploys specific technologies\nto counter an equivalent risk. Defense in Depth employs a holistic approach to protect all assets, while\ntaking into consideration its interconnections and dependencies, and using an organization’s available\nresources to provide effective layers of monitoring and protection based on the business’s exposure to\ncybersecurity risks.\n\n[In order to apply Defense in Depth to ICS environments, an organization must understand the rela­](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-82r2.pdf)\ntionship of intruders (threats) and vulnerabilities to the controls (standards and countermeasures) put in\nplace to protect the operations, personnel, and technologies that make up an ICS.\n\nA threat-actor, through intent, capability, and/or opportunity, poses a threat to an ICS by compro­\nmising an organization’s systems through its operations, personnel, and/or technology and exploiting an\nexisting weakness or vulnerability. Security countermeasures, based on best practices and standards, pro­\ntect ICS critical assets through multiple layers of defense—thereby improving protection for operations,\npersonnel, and technology. Organizations must constantly adjust and refine security countermeasures to\nensure protection against known and emerging threats (see Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attacker Intent Capability • Threats Opportunity • Vulnerabilities\n\n ICS Operations, Personnel andDefense in depth planning involves: \r\nAttacker Intent, Capability, Opportunity (threats & vulnerabilities).\r\nICS Operations, Personnel, & Technology.\r\nSecurity Standards, Controls & Countermeasures (physical controls, perimeter defenses & monitoring, internal defenses, policies/procedures, training, situational awareness, supply chain security).Technology\n\n                         - Physical Controls\n\n                        - Perimeter Defenses\nand Monitoring\n\n###### Security Standards,\n\n                        - Internal Defenses\n\n###### Controls and • Policies/Procedures Countermeasures • Training\n\n                        - Situational Awareness\n\n                        - Supply Chain Security\n\n\n###### Technology\n\n                   - Pe\n\n###### Security Standards,\n\n                       - In\n\n###### Controls and • Po Countermeasures • Tr\n\n                       - Si\n\n\n###### Figure 1. Defense-in-Depth planning.\n\n Because of the complexity of ICS architectures, potential vulnerabilities and/or exploits that introduce new and evolving categories of threats to the ICS environment can have lasting con­ sequences, and without a layered, multitier strategy could result in long-term exposure without detection. The following intrusion methods could enable an advanced persistent threat that lies within the system undetected for long periods of time:\n\n - Attacks directly from Internet to Internet-connected ICS devices.\n\n-- Establish direct access deep into the ICS systems.\n\n - Attacks initiated using remote access credentials stolen or hijacked from authorized ICS organization\n\nusers.\n\n-- Establish direct access deep into the ICS systems.\n\n - Attacks on the external business web interface.\n\n-- Leverage exploits to vulnerabilities existing in the web services.\n\n-- Pivot into the ICS historian that provides ICS data to the web server applications.\n\n - Attacks initiated by insertion of infected mobile media into a system component.\n\n-- Pivot deeper into the ICS network systems as threat actors find opportunity.\n\n - Threat actors use phishing email to establish a presence on enterprise user desktop or business com­\n\nputers.\n\n-- Pivot deeper into the ICS network systems as threat actors find opportunity.\n\n###### When applying Defense-in-Depth protection to ICS, one should note that several key differ­ ences exist between traditional IT environments and control system environments concerning security.

Thinking and doing solves problems, and technology enables problem solving by providing\na set of tools that can reduce risk. The best technology in the world will not prevent humans from making\nmistakes—whether intentional or unintentional. Organizations must constantly adjust and refine security\ncountermeasures to protect against known and emerging threats.\n\nApplying Defense-in-Depth strategies to ICS environments improves security by raising the “cost”\nof an intrusion while improving the probability of detection and capability to defend against a malicious\nthreat actor. Security countermeasures, based on best practices and standards, protect the ICS critical\nassets through multiple layers of defenses, thereby improving protection for operations, personnel, and\ntechnology.\n\nThe end goal is to reduce the opportunities for an adversary to take advantage of the ability to move\nlaterally through an entity’s networks/systems, and forcing the adversary to have a greater capability in\norder to accomplish their goal (increasing the cost of the intrusion to the threat actor). Using multiple\nlayers helps prevent direct attacks against critical systems and greatly increase the difficulty of reconnais­\nsance activities on ICS networks and systems while providing natural areas for the implementation of\nintrusion-detection technologies.\n\nThis section discusses some of the available and recommended solutions and strategies for Defensein-Depth security, as outlined in Table 2. Organizations should use these solutions and strategies in combi­\nnation to create layers of defenses, enabling ICS functionality while providing the most robust protection\navailable for critical assets.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Defense in Depth Strategy Elements|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Risk Management Program|• Identify Threats • Characterize Risk • Maintain Asset Inventory|\n|Cybersecurity Architecture|• Standards/ Recommendations • Policy • Procedures|\n|Physical Security|• Field Electronics Locked Down • Control Center Access Controls • Remote Site Video, Access Controls, Barriers|\n|ICS Network Architecture|• Common Architectural Zones • Demilitarized Zones (DMZ) • Virtual LANs|\n|ICS Network Perimeter Security|• Firewalls/ One-Way Diodes • Remote Access & Authentication • Jump Servers/ Hosts|\n|Host Security|• Patch and Vulnerability Management • Field Devices • Virtual Machines|\n|Security Monitoring|• Intrusion Detection Systems • Security Audit Logging • Security Incident and Event Monitoring|\n|Vendor Management|• Supply Chain Management • Managed Services/ Outsourcing • Leveraging Cloud Services|\n|The Human Element|• Policies • Procedures • Training and Awareness|\n\n\n###### Defense in Depth Strategy Elements\n\n\n###### 2.1  Risk Management and ICS\n\nImproving cybersecurity posture by implementing an ICS Defense-in-Depth strategy starts with de­\nveloping an understanding of the business risk associated with ICS cybersecurity and managing that risk\naccording to the overall business risk appetite. The individuals responsible for managing and maintaining\nthe functionality of control systems need to know the methods to assess and determine cybersecurity risk\nand how to apply that knowledge to their unique environment. A clear understanding of the threats to the\nbusiness; the operational processes and technology used within the organization; and its unique functional\nand technical requirements enables an organization to embed a layered approach for cybersecurity moni­\ntoring and defense into the day-to-day operation of their ICS.\n\nAn effective ICS security program depends on the willingness of the ICS operations staff to accept se­\ncurity as an enabler for all computer-oriented activities and their ability to apply security controls to their\n\nti l t h l f t d i t f t bl i k D i i ff ti ICS it hit\n\n\n-----\n\nA control system can affect the physical world, and as a result, the definition of risk as it applies to an\nICS must include considerations for potential real-world consequences. Individuals at all levels within an\norganization should understand ICS risks and actively engage themselves in the risk management process.\n\n###### 2.1.1  Multitier Risk Management Integration\n\nTo integrate ICS risk management practices throughout an organization, the entity should employ a\nthree-tiered approach that addresses risk at the organization level (Tier 1), the mission/business process\nlevel (Tier 2), and the information system level (Tier 3), as illustrated in Figure 2.

Tier 3 risk\nmanagement activities include performing the five system-level ICS risk management functions (identify, pro­\ntect, detect, respond, and recover) as part of a disciplined and structured system development life cycle process.\n\nApplying risk management to ICS at a practical level does not depend on having all three tiers in place.\nOrganizations can apply risk management practices to ICS at the operational level by defining a workable risk\nmanagement process; ensuring that systems are inventoried, categorized, and security prioritized based on their\nimportance and impact; identifying threats and vulnerabilities and their associated mitigation strategies; and\nensuring that risk acceptance processes and approval hierarchies are defined and implemented as part of the\nICS system life cycle.\n\n###### 2.1.2  Risk Management Approach\n\n The attack surface for an operation includes any and all the vectors associated with gaining access to the systems or equipment considered critical to business operations. To implement con­ trols necessary to reduce the attack surface for critical assets, an organization must first identify the systems and components they consider business or mission critical. Then they must determine the criticality of the assets based on its function and importance to business operations. The business then performs a cybersecurity risk analysis of the system to identify the current threats, vulnerabil­ ities, and risks to the system and/or operations, and the potential impact should a threat be carried out. Figure 3 shows this process.\n\n Inventory Assets Categorize\n Monitor\n Asset\n and Adjust\n Criticality\n\n ICS Implement Operations Identify Security Security Controls Risks\n\n Identify Determine and Tailor Potential Controls Impact\n\n Figure 3. Risk Management Approach.\n\nOrganizations should apply controls at the highest security level possible while enabling uninterrupt­\ned functionality. Finally, they should monitor and adjust security controls as necessary to ensure ongoing\nprotection against emerging threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Risk Analysis\n\n- Identify the threats that face the business.\n\n\n\n    - Identify the threats that face the business.\n\n    - Document the system network architecture.\n\n    - Identify technologies used in the business.\n\n    - Identify the software applications within the operation.\n\n    - Identify the human elements in the organization.\n\n    - Determine assets critical to business operation.\n\n    - Predict the likelihood of a threat actor carrying out a threat.\n\n    - Predict methods of an intrusion executed to exploit existing critical asset or\n\nprocess vulnerabilities.\n\n    - Prioritize risk scenarios based on impact to the business.\n\n\n###### 2.2  Asset Inventory and Risk Characterization\n\nFor ICS security to be effective, an asset owner must first identify what needs protection. Doing so\nestablishes a baseline understanding among the stakeholders relative to the support infrastructure (both\nIT and ICS). Asset owners must identify and prioritize process systems (including process equipment and\noperations and ICS software, networks, and personnel) and analyze interconnections and dependencies\nbased on their business impact. Understanding the business context and the resources that support critical\nfunctions and the related business risks enables an organization to focus and prioritize its efforts consis­\ntent with its risk management strategy and business needs.\n\nAsset identification is an important step in understanding and managing ICS risk and helps to deter­\nmine the basis and priorities for applying security defenses. This is also vital in determining what spe­\ncific monitoring should be considered, what countermeasures are practical, what countermeasures can\nimpede normal system behavior, and what compensating controls asset owners can deploy if there is no\napplicable technical countermeasure. Unlike IT, managing cybersecurity within control system domains\nrequires consideration of unique system nuances and realistic conditions that need met for an adversary to\ncompromise the system and cause process impact. Identifying all assets within the control system is vital\nto understanding the potential impact cyber-related intrusion. Assets can include systems, information, or\nprocesses (operations).\n\n\n###### Asset Characterization\n\n   - What asset (information) needs to be protected?\n\n   - Why does the asset need to be protected?\n\n   - Who has the responsibility for managing and protecting the asset (what are the roles,\n\nresponsibilities, accountabilities and authorities)?\n\n   - If the threat actor compromised the asset, what realistic worst-case scenarios would result?\n\n   - What is the value of the asset?\n\n   - What is the criticality of the process or information to the business mission?\n\n    - What are the protection levels for confidentiality, integrity, and availability?\n\n   - What interconnections are required for the systems to perform?\n\n   - What methods are currently available for user access?\n\n   - What dependencies are present for system functionality?\n\n   - How does the information flow through the system, and through what mechanisms?\n\n\n-----\n\nsupporting infrastructure to ICS dependencies. This thread will reveal which ICS components are more\ncritical when applying security controls.\n\nA current inventory that has all ICS components characterized according to their criticality to their\nfunction provides a solid basis for applying defense measures, and helps to ensure that asset owners miss\nno systems or leave no critical devices unprotected.\n\n###### 2.2.1  Inventory Assets\n\nA comprehensive inventory of ICS assets develops a baseline understanding among all stakeholders\nrelative to the support infrastructure (both IT and ICS). Organizations should identify systems (including\nhardware, software, and supporting infrastructure technologies) and analyze dependencies to understand\nboth the function of the asset itself and the resources required to support critical functions. Organizations\nshould couple technical network maps for all systems with the physical inventory and an operational-level\nof understanding of the information flows, which provide a basis for determining the protection levels for\neach system or subsystem and the controls to put in place to protect the system without compromising or\ndegrading its performance. In an ICS environment, identifying both upstream and downstream dependen­\ncies is critical, as the processes involved are, many times, interdependent and potential effects subtle.\n\nThe greatest vulnerability to ICS systems occurs at any point of connection. While Internet con­\nnectivity may present the greatest vulnerability, asset owners must identify any connectivity in this\nstep—whether currently connected or could be connected later. To leave even one potential connection\nundiscovered could inadvertently leave the entire system and network vulnerable. Running a scan on the\nnetwork elements will identify only what is connected and on at the moment of the scan, so the organiza­\ntion should conduct a physical inventory as well.\n\n###### 2.2.2  Categorize Asset Criticality\n\nDetermining asset criticality starts with identifying the information generated, processed, stored, and\ndisseminated on and from the ICS; the function of the ICS asset within the overall operation (keeping in\nmind both upstream and downstream functional impacts); and assigning a security categorization for that\nasset. Asset owners should rate the security categorizations based on the potential impact (low, moderate,\nor high) on the organization should an event occur that jeopardizes its ability to accomplish its mission,\nprotect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individu­\nals. The key is to identify the thread from the function (purpose) of the asset to its supporting infrastruc­\nture and ICS dependencies. This thread will reveal which ICSs are more critical when it comes to apply­\ning security controls.\n\n###### 2.2.3  Identify Security Risks\n\nIn order to define and articulate the risk to ICS, organizations must identify the potential threats to the\nICS and the vulnerability of the system to those threats. This information provides the current security\nrisk exposure for the ICS.\n\n\n###### Security Risks\n\n    - Insider intentional threats—disgruntled employees, vendors, system integrators or\n\nanyone else with internal knowledge or access to the ICS;\n\n    - Internal unintentional threats—inappropriate system designs, policies, architectures\n\nprocedures, technologies or testing;\n\n    - External nontargeted threats—maliciously designed software viruses and worms; and\n\n    - Malicious actors—“black hat” hackers, criminals, and nation-states.\n\n\n-----\n\nel consequences are typically operations line managers and operators. They understand the operational\nsystems and the potential impact to the system should a threat actor compromise the control system. They\ncan also help to determine the potential consequences of a system failure to the business, which may\ninclude the loss of information.\n\n###### 2.2.4  Determine Potential Impact\n\nAn organization can estimate the likelihood of a threat actor carrying out a threat or exploiting a\nvulnerability by taking into account the potential channels for threat exploitation, such as whether the\nsystem is in a higher or lower security zone on the network, its access and privilege requirements, its\nsecurity configuration, and identifying any exceptions to security policy. The potential impact of a threat\nactor compromising or making an asset unavailable (for example, financial, damage to other systems or\nto the public, including human safety concerns) is based on the criticality of the system or information,\nthe visibility of the system or the exploit, and the ability to quickly remediate any damage caused by the\ncompromise. This step identifies both direct and collateral impacts.\n\nFor ICS environments, the impacts can also be kinetic—that is, runaway processes or system failures\ncan have physical and environmental consequences, such as a dam opening and flooding downstream ar­\neas. Asset owners should consider any impact that could present safety concerns as high impact. Figure 4\ncharacterizes the current risk by impact and likelihood.\n\n###### High Impact High Impact Low Likelihood High Likelihood\n\n LOW HIGH\n\n Low Impact Low Impact Low Likelihood High Likelihood\n\n Figure 4. Simple qualitative risk analysis chart.\n\n 2.2.5  Identify and Tailor Controls\n\nThe Chief Information Security Officer or organizational equivalent usually sets baseline security\ncontrols, with input from IT and OT operations and management personnel, and based on the overall pro­\ntection level (criticality). If the system is critical to the organization’s mission (as identified in a Business\nImpact Assessment) or if the ICS controls a process with potential human safety consequences, it may\nrequire special consideration and additional controls.\n\n\n###### High Impact High Impact Low Likelihood High Likelihood\n\n LOW HIGH\n\n Low Impact Low Impact Low Likelihood High Likelihood\n\n\n-----\n\nsome of which are discussed in Section 4.3. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),\n[in their “Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity,” has published recommended](http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/)\n[controls for organizations wishing to protect their ICS. Organizations should gear ICS controls toward](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-53-rev4/sp800-53-rev4-ipd.pdf)\nreducing risk while enabling functionality.\n\nAsset owners should tailor security controls for a particular system based on mission needs or system\nfunctionality requirements. Control tailoring may add or subtract controls from the recommended control\nset. Asset owners should base tailoring on a documented business need, assessed for risk, and approved\nprior to system or application implementation or production release.\n\nAn important part of identifying and tailoring security controls is to remember that policies and pro­\ncedures are critical controls as well. Organizations should review and update policies and procedures to\ndrive the implementation of Defense-in-Depth practices. Understand organization policies and procedures\nand ensure they are current and support ICS cyber risk reduction goals. Companies often have “unwrit­\nten policies” or rely on the expertise of their personnel to apply security controls, which leads to in­\nconsistent applications. Asset owners should maintain written and formalized policies and procedures and\nview them as a vital part of their Defense-in-Depth strategy.\n\n###### 2.2.6  Implement Security Controls\n\nApply security controls to ICS according to priority. The most critical (high impact) and most vul­\nnerable (high likelihood) systems should be the first priority for risk reduction and mitigation activities.\nPervasive vulnerabilities, such as the use of unsupported operating systems (OS), are also a good starting\npoint for applying security controls. Regular system updates can provide far-reaching protection and re­\nduce risk across many systems. Security controls for the human aspect of security should include cyber­\nsecurity awareness training that undergoes regular review and frequent testing. This process significantly\nreduces the physical business attack surface.\n\nAsset owners should not see security controls as an “add-on” for ICS. They should integrate security\nconsiderations and processes into existing policies and procedures and consider them an integral part of\nthe system life cycle. No system is 100 percent secure; however, applying security controls to the sys­\ntems and environment can help reduce risk to an acceptable level. This is where organizations must apply\nDefense-in-Depth practices.\n\nICS systems may have functional or operational properties that disallow the application of a security\ncontrol. In these cases, a variance, waiver, or exception to a control may be in order. A control variance is\na request to accept a compensating control. Compensating controls apply security protection at or above\nthe same level as outlined in the control requirement and usually do not raise risk to the security of the\nsystem. Control waivers are requests to tailor the control out of the baseline for the system, because it\ndoes not apply to the system, its implementation, or environment. Control exceptions are requests made\nwhen the organization determines that the control applies to the system, but they will not implement them\nfor an established business reason. ICS environments, unlike IT environments, usually require a good\namount of control tailoring or may have many variances, waivers, or exceptions because of their special­\nized functionality, unique protocols, and specific operational requirements. When considering control ex­\nceptions, organizations should perform a risk assessment and ensure that the appropriate personnel review\nand accept the risk of not implementing a security control. Organizations should consider these exceptions\ntemporary and review them periodically to ensure they address them in a timely manner.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurity for any system is never a “once and done” activity. Organizations constantly change ICS\nenvironments—adjusting settings, replacing or upgrading older systems, implementing new capabilities,\nreleasing vendor patches—and the threats to ICSs and operations constantly evolve. Security monitoring\nis critical to ensure ongoing system protection.\n\nAsset owners should review or assess the implementation status for all security controls periodical­\nly throughout the system development life cycle. This provides an important indicator of whether the\ncontrols work as intended and reduce risk. Asset owners may need additional or compensating controls\nto further reduce risk, so they should revisit the control selection process and properly address identified\nrisks. The results of these assessments or reviews will provide the organization with a determination of\nresidual risk and also provide insight into areas where they need to make security control adjustments.\n\nThis document discusses some of the technical controls that provide monitoring information; howev­\ner, system monitoring only works when performed diligently and when the process in place uses the infor­\nmation to continually improve. Monitoring and adjustment activities such as system auditing and reviews,\nassessments, configuration management and change control processes, and applying lessons learned are\nan essential part of risk management practices.\n\n###### 2.3  Physical Security\n\n Physical security measures reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate loss or damage to organizational assets and the surrounding environment. The assets being safeguarded include physical assets such as tools and plant equipment, the environment, the surrounding community, and intellectual property including proprietary data such as process settings and customer infor­ mation. Physical security controls often must meet environmental, safety, regulatory, legal, and other requirements, often specific to a given environment. Organizations should tailor physical security controls, like technical controls, to the type of protection needed.\n\n Organizations must address the physical protection of the cyber components and data asso­ ciated with the ICS as part of the overall security in the ICS environment. Security at many ICS facilities is closely tied to plant safety with a primary goal of keeping people out of hazardous situations without preventing them from doing their job or carrying out emergency procedures. Physical security controls are any physical measures, either active or passive, that limit physical access to any information assets in the ICS environment. Organizations employ these measures to prevent undesirable system impact such as the following:\n\n - Unauthorized physical access to sensitive locations;\n\n - Physical modification, manipulation, theft or other removal, or destruction of existing systems, infra­\n\nstructure, communications interfaces, personnel, or physical locations;\n\n - Unauthorized observation of sensitive information assets through visual observation, note taking,\n\nphotographs, or other means;\n\n - Unauthorized introduction of new systems, infrastructure, communications interfaces, or other hard­\n\nware; and\n\n - Unauthorized introduction of devices intentionally designed to cause hardware manipulation, com­\n\nmunications eavesdropping, or other harmful impact such as a universal serial bus (USB) memory\ndevice, wireless access point, or Bluetooth or cellular device.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Physical Access\n\n- Facility access controls;\n\n\nGaining physical access to a control room or control system components often implies gaining\nlogical access to the process control system as well. Likewise, having logical access to systems, such as\ncommand servers and control room computers, allows an adversary to exercise control over the physical\nprocess. If computers are readily accessible, and they have removable media drives (for example, flop­\npy disks, compact disks (CD), digital video disks (DVD), Blu-Ray drives, external hard drives) or USB\nports, organizations can fit the drives with locks or remove them from the computers and disable USB\nports. Depending on security needs and risks, asset owners might also find it prudent to disable or phys­\nically protect power buttons to prevent unauthorized use. For maximum security, place servers in locked\nareas and protect authentication mechanisms (such as keys). Also, locate the network devices on the ICS\nnetwork, including switches, routers, network jacks, servers, workstations, and controllers, in a secured\narea accessible only by authorized personnel. The secured area should also be compatible with the envi­\nronmental requirements of the devices.\n\nClassic physical security considerations typically refer to a ringed architecture of layered securi­\nty measures. Creating several physical barriers—both active and passive—around buildings, facilities,\nrooms, equipment, or other informational assets establishes these physical security perimeters. Physical\nsecurity controls include fences, anti-vehicle ditches, earthen mounds, walls, reinforced barricades, gates,\nor other measures. Most organizations include this layered model by first preventing access to the facility\nthrough the use of fences, guards, gates, and locked doors.\n\nPhysical access control systems should ensure that only authorized people have access to controlled\nspaces. An access control system should be flexible. The need for access may depend on time (day versus\nnight shift), level of training, employment status, work assignment, plant status, and a myriad of other fac­\ntors. A system must verify that individuals being granted access are who they say they are (usually using\nsomething the person has, such as an access card or key; something they know, such as a PIN; or some­\nthing they are, using a biometric device). Access control should be highly reliable, yet not interfere with\nthe routine or emergency duties of plant personnel. Integration of access control into the process system\nallows a view into not only security access, but also physical and personnel asset tracking, dramatically\naccelerating response time in emergencies, helping to direct individuals to safe locations, and improving\noverall productivity. Limit access to network and computer cabinets to only those who have a need such\nas network technicians and engineers or computer maintenance staff. Lock equipment cabinets and keep\nwiring neat and within cabinets. Consider keeping all computers in secure racks and using peripheral\nextender technology to connect human-machine interfaces (HMI) to the racked computers.\n\nAccess monitoring systems include still and video cameras, sensors, and various types of identifica­\ntion systems. Examples of these systems include cameras that monitor parking lots, convenience stores,\nor airports. These devices do not specifically prevent access to a particular location; rather, they store and\nrecord either the physical presence or the lack of physical presence of individuals, vehicles, animals, or\nother physical entities. Provide adequate lighting based on the type of access monitoring device deployed.\n\nAccess-limiting systems may employ a combination of devices to physically control or prevent access to\nprotected resources. Access-limiting systems include both active and passive security devices such as fences,\n\n\n###### Physical Access\n\n    - Facility access controls;\n\n    - ICS control and server room access;\n\n    - Multifactor (for example, key card, card-and-personal identification number (PIN), or\n\nbiometric) authentication for physical access;\n\n    - Facility monitoring using cameras, motion detectors;\n\n    - Alerting for device manipulation such as power removal, device resets, cabling chang­\n\nes, or the addition/use of removable media devices; and\n\n    - Visitor escort requirements and procedures.\n\n\n-----\n\nrole-based access for specific individuals or groups of individuals.\n\nLocating people and vehicles in a large installation is important for safety reasons, and, increasingly so,\nfor security reasons as well. Asset location technologies can track the movements of people and vehicles\nwithin the plant to ensure that they stay in authorized areas, identify personnel needing assistance, and sup­\nport emergency response.\n\nIn addressing the security needs of the system and data, always consider environmental factors. For ex­\nample, in a dusty location, place systems in a filtered environment. This is particularly important if the dust\nis conductive or magnetic, as in the case of sites that process coal or iron. If vibration is likely to be a prob­\nlem, mount systems on rubber bushings to prevent disk crashes and wiring connection problems. In addition,\nthe environments containing systems and media (for example, backup tapes and floppy disks) should have\nstable temperature and humidity. An alarm to the process control system should sound when environmental\nspecifications, such as temperature and humidity, exceed the limits.\n\nHeating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for control rooms must support plant per­\nsonnel during normal operation and emergency situations, which could include the release of toxic sub­\nstances. Organizations should carefully design fire systems to avoid causing more harm than good (for\nexample, to avoid mixing water with incompatible products). HVAC and fire systems have significantly\nincreased roles in security that arise from the interdependence of process control and security, and need to be\nprotected against potential cyber incidents as well.\n\nReliable power for the ICS is essential, so organizations should have an uninterruptible power supply\n(UPS). If the site has an emergency generator, the UPS battery life may only need to last for a few seconds;\nhowever, if the site relies on external power, the UPS battery life may need to last for several hours. It should\nbe sized, at a minimum, so that the system can be shut down safely.\n\nPhysical security for the control center/control room will reduce the potential for many threats. Control\ncenters/control rooms frequently have consoles continuously logged onto the primary control server, where\nspeed of response and continual view of the plant is of utmost importance. These areas will often contain\nthe servers themselves, other critical computer nodes, and sometimes plant controllers. Asset owners should\nlimit access to these areas to authorized users only, using authentication methods such as smart or magnetic\nidentity cards or biometric devices. In extreme cases, an asset owner could consider it necessary to make the\ncontrol center/control room blast-proof, or to provide an offsite emergency control center/control room so\nthat control can be maintained if the primary control center/control room becomes uninhabitable.\n\nComputers and computerized devices used for ICS functions (such as programmable logic controller\n(PLC) programming) should never leave the ICS area. Laptops, portable engineering workstations, and\nhandhelds should be tightly secured and never used outside the ICS network.\n\nOrganizations should also address cabling design and implementation for the control network. Unshield­\ned twisted pair communications cable, while acceptable for the office environment, is generally not suitable\nfor the plant environment because of its susceptibility to interference from magnetic fields, radio waves,\ntemperature extremes, moisture, dust, and vibration. Use industrial registered jack (RJ)-45 connectors in\nplace of other types of twisted pair connectors to provide protection against moisture, dust, and vibration.\nFiber-optic and coaxial cables are often better network cabling choices for the control network because they\nare immune to many of the typical environmental conditions, including electrical and radio frequency in­\nterference found in an industrial control environment. Color code and label cables and connectors to clearly\ndelineate the ICS and IT networks and reduce the potential for an inadvertent cross-connect. Install cable\nruns to limit access to authorized personnel only and install equipment in locked cabinets with adequate\nventilation and air filtration.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe convergence of once-isolated ICSs has helped organizations simplify the management of com­\nplex environments. Connecting these networks and incorporating IT components into the ICS domain\nintroduces vulnerabilities that asset owners must address before issues arise. Contributing factors include:\n\n - Insecure connectivity to internal and external networks,\n\n - Technologies with known vulnerabilities, creating previously unseen cyber risk in the control domain,\n\nand\n\n - Lack of a qualified business case or understanding of requirements for ICS environments.\n\nThe former isolation from external (and historically untrusted) networks allowed the organization\nto reduce the level of ICS security to those threats associated with having physical access to a facility or\na plant floor. Most data communications in the ICS information infrastructure required limited authori­\nzation or security oversight because operational commands, instructions, and data acquisition occurred\nin a closed environment with trusted communications. In general, when someone sends a command or\ninstruction via the network, they anticipate that it will arrive and perform the authorized function, because\nonly authorized operators have access to the system.\n\nMerging a modern IT architecture with an isolated network that may not have any countermeasures in\nplace is challenging. Using simple connectivity (that is, routers and switches) provides the most obvious\nway to interconnect networks; however, unauthorized access by an individual could result in unlimited\naccess to the ICS. The diagram shown in Figure 5 depicts an integrated architecture that includes con­\nnections from external sources such as the corporate LAN, peer sites, vendor sites, and the Internet. The\n[model comes from the International Society of Automation and provides insight into the widely accepted](https://www.isa.org/)\nSP-99 (Purdue) Model of Control.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SCADA, DCS or Remote SCADA, DCS or Cell/Area Zone Hybrid System #1 Hybrid System #2\n\n Local HMI LAN\n\nLocal HMI Local HMI\n\n###### Level 2\n\n Controller LAN Field Field\n\nControllers Controllers\n\n###### Level 1\n\n Field I/O Devices Field Field Field Field\n\nDevices Sensors Devices Sensors Devices Sensors Devices Sensors\n\n###### Instrument Bus\n\nProcess SIS Process SIS\n\n###### Level 0\n\nLegend:\n\nLocal Field bus/hard wired\n\n\n###### Manufacturing Zone Control Center/ Processing LAN HMI Production/ Database I/O Historian Domain Engineering\n\nApplication Server Server Controller Workstation\n\n###### Level 3\n\nServer\n\n\n###### Internet DMZ\n\n Level 5\n\nWeb Servers Email Servers\n\n\n###### Figure 5.

Dividing common control system architectures\ninto zones can assist organizations in creating clear boundaries in order to effectively apply multiple\nlayers of defense. Understanding how to achieve network segmentation is vital to creating architectural\nzones and determining the best methodologies for segmenting networks within and around control system\nenvironments.\n\n###### Enterprise DMZ Security Zone\n Enterprise Level 5 Network\n\n Site Business Planning\n Level 4\n and Logistics Network\n\n DMZ\n\n Manufacturing Security Zone Site Manufacturing\n Control Center/\n Operations and Level 3\n Processing LAN\n Control:\n\nCell Security Zone\n\n###### Area Control: Local HMI LAN Level 2\n\n Basic Control: Controller LAN Level 1\n\n Field I/O Devices\n Process: Level 0\n Instrument Bus\n\n Figure 6.

A wide variety of risks exist in this zone because of the amount of\nsystems and connectivity, and from an ICS security standpoint, one should consider this zone untrusted.\n\n2.

It is a critical area for the continuity and management of a\ncontrol network. Operational support and engineering management devices are located in this zone, along\nwith data acquisition servers and historians. The Manufacturing Zone is central to the operation of end\ndevices and provides required connectivity to the Enterprise Zone. The priority of this area is high. Risks\nare associated with its direct connectivity to any external systems or networks.\n\n**Cell Security Zone: The Cell Security Zone contains systems used for local or remote area control**\n(Level 2), such as field located HMIs, PLCs, and their controls (Level 1) and basic input/output devices\nsuch as actuators and sensors (Level 0). The priority of these zones is very high, as these are the areas\nwhere the control functions affect the physical end devices. In a modern control system network, these\ndevices will likely have support for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and other\ncommon protocols. It also may include safety-instrumented systems (SIS), which automatically control\nthe safety level of an end device—elevating the risk. Ideally, one would locate the SIS on a separate network—ensuring that should an incident occur on the primary ICS network, the safety systems continue to\nfunction and are not at risk of compromise.\n\nEach of these zones requires a unique security focus. A “peel-the-onion” analysis shows that an intruder trying to affect a critical infrastructure system would most likely go after the core control domains\ncontained in Level 3 and below. This depends on the overall objective of the attacker. In general, complete\ncontrol over core services and operational capability of the control system has high value. Manipulation\nof the ICS information resources can devastate an organization if this critical zone becomes compromised.\nIn many sectors, the malicious intrusion on the control system will have real-world, physical results.\n\nIn an attack scenario, the intrusion begins at some point outside the control zone and the actor pries\ndeeper and deeper into the architecture. Layered strategies that secure each of the core zones can create a\ndefensive strategy with depth, offering the administrators more opportunities for information and resource\ncontrol, as well as introducing cascading countermeasures that will not necessarily impede business functionality.\n\n###### 2.4.2  Demilitarized Zones\n\nA demilitarized zone (DMZ) (sometimes referred to as a perimeter network) is a physical and logical\nsub network that acts as an intermediary for connected security devices so that they avoid exposure to a\nlarger and untrusted network, usually the Internet. The DMZ adds an additional layer of security to an\norganization’s LAN; an external intruder only has direct access to equipment within the DMZ, rather than\nany other part of the network.\n\nThe ability to establish a DMZ between the corporate and control networks represents a significant\nimprovement with the use of firewalls. As shown in Figure 6, each DMZ holds one or more critical components, such as the data historian, the wireless access point, or remote and third-party access systems.\nCreating a DMZ requires that the firewall offers three or more interfaces, rather than the typical public\nand private interfaces. One of the interfaces connects to the corporate network, the second to the control\nnetwork, and the remaining interfaces to the shared or insecure devices such as the data historian server or\nwireless access points on the DMZ network.\n\nBy placing corporate-accessible components in a DMZ, no direct communication paths are required\nfrom the corporate network to the control network; each path effectively ends in the DMZ. Most firewalls\ncan allow for multiple DMZs and can specify what type of traffic may be forwarded between zones. The\nfirewall can block arbitrary packets from the corporate network from entering the control network and can\nalso regulate traffic from the other network zones including the control network. With well-planned rule\nsets, one can maintain clear separation between the control network and other networks with little or no\ntraffic passing directly between the corporate and control networks.\n\n\n-----\n\ncomputer in the DMZ and uses it to launch an exploit against the control network via application traffic\npermitted from the DMZ to the control network. Organizations can reduce this risk if they make a con­\ncerted effort to harden and actively patch the servers in the DMZ, and if the firewall rule set only permits\nconnections initiated by control network devices between the control network and DMZ. Other concerns\nwith this architecture include the added complexity and the potential increased cost of firewalls with\nseveral ports. For more critical systems, however, the improved security should more than offset these\ndisadvantages.\n\nTwo-zone solutions (no DMZ) are marginally acceptable, but one should only deploy them with\nextreme care. The most secure, manageable, and scalable control network and corporate network segrega­\ntion architectures typically use a system with at least three zones, incorporating one or more DMZs.\n\nOrganizations could create multiple DMZs for separate functionalities and access privileges such as\npeer connections, the data historian, ICS communications protocols, the Inter Control Center Communi­\ncations Protocol (ICCP) server in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, the security\nservers, replicated servers, and development servers. Multiple DMZs have proven effective in protecting\nlarge architectures composed of networks with different operational mandates. The secure flow of data\ninto and out of the different environments is critical to operations.\n\nOne must be cautious when deploying DMZ solutions to connect otherwise logically separated do­\nmains. Do not assume that the implementation of a DMZ is a panacea for preventing threat actors from\npenetrating deeper into critical environments. The exploitation of transitive trust across a security perim­\neter is a plausible intrusion vector. However, when one develops and deploys a DMZ with appropriate\nsecurity, the countermeasure will increase the work effort for the adversary, provide more granular control\nfor the asset owner, and reduce cyber risk to vital critical assets. Some high-level considerations that one\ncan use to support an effective Defense-in-Depth strategy utilizing DMZs are as follows:\n\n - Asset owners should limit access to an ICS DMZ to only authorized users, applications, and services.\n\nWherever possible, asset owners should model ingress and egress traffic to and from the DMZ so that\nthey can use additional security monitoring and anomaly detection at the payload level in addition to\nsource/destination/service filtering.\n\n - Access from the higher security zone (that is, from within control or operations levels) is generally to\n\n“push” data to the DMZ application and make that data available to the authorized enterprise users.\nAccess for the enterprise user is only to pull from the DMZ application server, thereby providing fur­\nther separation. It is important to create this logical separation so that a threat actor cannot exploit the\ntrust between the corporate enclaves in the DMZ to “pivot” from the DMZ into the control system.\n\n - Asset owners often use DMZs for remote access. Allowing remote access creates a number of issues\n\nthat organizations must consider prior to documenting a policy and implementing a remote access\nprocess. Whether from the corporate network to the ICS or from the Internet to the ICS, remote ac­\ncess provides a serious risk to the system. An intruder can gain access to a user account at the user’s\nhome or his/her corporate office and use those stolen credentials to connect to critical ICS assets, or\nallow an infected computer an access channel into the ICS networks via an established virtual pri­\nvate network (VPN) connection. The organization must decide what, if any, access they require from\nremote locations; whether a particular user truly needs that access (and if so, at what level); and how\nto harden the access process to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.\n\n - Asset owners should only allow authorized external users to remotely connect to intermediary authen­\n\ntication servers residing in a DMZ. In addition to using multifactor authentication methods, definitive\nrules and connection states should be clearly identified and maintained. These servers (often referred\nto as “jump boxes”) provide connectivity to remote computers that are likely less secure than the\njump boxes themselves. In addition to multifactor authentication and specific security related to user\nroles and least privileges, asset owners should harden jump boxes and any applications or services\nthat do not support secure remote access removed.\n\n\n-----\n\nA virtual LAN (VLAN) divides physical networks into smaller logical networks that consist of a\nsingle broadcast domain that isolates traffic from other VLANs. Using VLANs limits broadcast traffic and\nallows logical subnets to span multiple physical locations.\n\nThere are two categories of VLANs: static, often referred to as port-based, where one assigns switch\nports to a VLAN so that it is transparent to the end user; and dynamic, where an end device negotiates\nVLAN characteristics with the switch or determines the VLAN based on the IP or hardware addresses.\n\nOne must secure VLANs used in ICS environments explicitly, because default configurations and\nstandard network configurations are not inherently secure. Virtual networking does not come without\nrisks, because exploits known as “VLAN” hopping can create opportunities for an adversary to move\nbetween networks that the asset owner has configured to be logically separated.\n\nMany ICS network infrastructure designs deploy VLANs as part of segmenting network functions\nand capabilities. Current best practices suggest that if the information infrastructure is large, then organi­\nzations should decompose each of the contributing control system domains (such as those within a plant\nor energy management system) into smaller and more manageable segments and zones. This methodology\nfacilitates easier administration and can protect against unwanted traffic artifacts from “bleeding” from\none network to the other. While the VLAN approach is becoming favorable in the control system commu­\nnity, it is equally important to understand and protect against the most prominent intrusion vectors associ­\nated with deploying virtual networks. Cybersecurity experts refer to these exploits as “VLAN hopping,”\n“double tagging” and “switch spoofing.” The countermeasures and defensive capabilities associated with\nprotecting against these types of intrusions have evolved significantly over the last several years. Because\nthe countermeasures are generally not a default component of the security architecture or the security\ntechnology used to support the information infrastructure, the effectiveness of the countermeasures often\nbecomes a function of how one configures them.\n\n###### “The most serious mistake that a user can make is to underestimate the importance of the Data Link layer, and of VLANs in particular, in the sophisticated architecture of\n switched networks. It should not be forgotten that the OSI stack is only as robust as its\n weakest link, and that therefore an equal amount of attention should be paid to any of\n its layers so as to make sure that its entire structure is sound.”\n\n –Virtual LAN Security Best Practices, Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\nThe VLAN architecture needs to ensure the disabling of the Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) and\nconfigure the switch ports as static access ports. This helps prevent switch spoofing exploits, because the\naccess ports cannot handle tagged packets or become tagged ports. In addition, the unused switch ports\nbecome disabled—thus rendering them unavailable for any connectivity. When one specifically configures\nthe port as an access port, it cannot become a trunk port and cannot send traffic to other/multiple VLANs.\nIf DTP is disabled, an intruder cannot use any access ports configured as dynamic to create a network\nrelationship.\n\nSystem administrators can counter double tagging by removing access ports from the default (native)\nand designating the native VLAN on all switched trunks to “unassigned.” Adversaries cannot match their\nport to one on a different VLAN. Administrators should always select an unused VLAN as the native\nVLAN for all trunks, and should not use this VLAN for any other purpose. They should prune VLAN 1\nfrom all trunks and access ports that do not require it (including disconnected and shutdown ports). They\nalso shouldn’t use VLAN 1 for in-band management traffic and should use a different, dedicated VLAN\nto keep management traffic separate from user data and protocol traffic.\n\n\n###### “The most serious mistake that a user can make is to underestimate the importance of the Data Link layer, and of VLANs in particular, in the sophisticated architecture of\n switched networks.

This requires the use of a router or\n\nmulti-layer switch to join multiple VLANs. Many routers and firewalls support tagged frames so that\na single physical interface can route between multiple logical networks.\n\n - Create role-based user accounts for all VLANs. Create an access-list to restrict telnet/secure shell\n\n(SSH) access from specific networks and hosts.\n\n - Create and apply Layer 2 (L2) access control lists (ACLs) and Virtual ACLs, blocking the direct com­\n\nmunication at L2 between a potential attacker and the attacked device. Embed more intelligence into\nthe network so that it can check forwarded Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets for identity\ncorrectness.\n\n - Use private VLANs to protect networks from unwanted traffic from untrustworthy devices.\n\n - Enable port security.\n\n - When feasible, prefer out-of-band management to in-band management.\n\n - Limit the number of media access control (MAC) addresses used by a single port so the device traffic\n\nidentification for a device is directly tied to its port of origin. Disable unused ports and assign them to\nan unused VLAN.\n\n - Create and apply L3 ACLs by IP address (recommended for most static wired networks), MAC ad­\n\ndress filtering, port assignment, dynamic assignment (recommended for most wireless networks and\nshared switch port networks), protocols, and by applications. By default, treat only known and trusted\nports as such, and configure all other ports as untrusted. This prevents attached devices from manipu­\nlating quality of service (QoS) values inappropriately.\n\n - Turn off VTP/MVRP, and set DTP to “off” on all nontrusted ports. This is a best practice for using\n\nVLANs within ICS, as it can limit (or even prevent) possible undesirable protocol interactions in net­\nworkwide VLAN configurations. This precaution can also limit or prevent the risk of an administrator\nerror propagating to the entire network.\n\n###### 2.5  Security Architectures\n\nOnce an organizations has designed and implemented a robust network architecture, they have\nestablished the security architecture for the network and systems. The security architecture includes the\nspecific controls and their strategic placement within the network or systems to establish layers of secu­\nrity—Defense in Depth. Network diagrams and information flow diagrams that include all systems and\ntheir interconnections couple with the physical inventory to provide an operational-level understanding of\nthe information flows within the network. Then overlay this with the protection levels for each system or\nsubsystem that was assigned during inventory activities to help determine the controls to put in place to\nprotect the system without compromising or degrading its performance.\n\nSystem administrators must consider the application of security controls at the network, system, ap­\nplication, and physical layers to provide information assurance. These include policy and security man­\nagement, application security, data security, platform security, network and perimeter security, physical\nsecurity, and user security. The security architecture is where all the defensive mechanisms and controls\ncome together, and overlay the network architecture. The security architecture defines where to apply\n[Defense-in-Depth measures across the organization. NIST 800-82, “Guide to Industrial Control Systems](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n(ICS) Security,” provides a community-wide ICS security controls overlay based on the NIST 800-53,\n“Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,” security controls\noverlay generalized concept.\n\n\n-----\n\nICS perimeter security includes controls for both physical and logical security to protect the assets\nwithin those perimeters. The first consideration in logical perimeter protection is having a clear under­\nstanding of where the communications boundary exists. This requires evaluation to determine where\nthreat actors could leverage potential intrusion vectors to infiltrate the ICS. Logical security includes\ncontrols such as authentication mechanisms, ACLs within network components, intrusion detection/pre­\nvention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures, situational awareness tools, and other means to protect the systems\nfrom a logical perspective. Physical perimeter security includes key cards to open doors, motion detec­\ntion, cameras, security forces to respond to physical intrusion, and other mechanisms to protect physical\nassets.\n\n###### 2.5.2  Firewalls\n\nNetwork security depends on multiple components, each with specific roles. Firewalls are the first line\nof defense within an ICS network environment. These components keep the intruder out while allowing\nthe authorized passage of data necessary to run the organization. Thus, the concept of network segmenta­\ntion applies to the network in layers to protect assets at all levels.\n\nFirewalls act as sentinels, or gatekeepers, between zones. When properly configured, they will only\nlet essential traffic cross security boundaries. If they are not properly configured, they could easily pass\nunauthorized or malicious users or content. Firewall rules monitor the network traffic and enable a trusted\npath to users and a trusted channel to other devices. This is only as effective as the accuracy of the rules\nthey are configured with.\n\nThe firewall golden rule says “that which is not explicitly allowed is denied,” which means that the\nfinal rule should not be “any, any,” but rather “deny all.”\n\nThe role of the firewall is to:\n\n - Establish domain separation.\n\n - Monitor (and log) system events.\n\n - Authenticate users before they are allowed access.\n\n - Monitor ingress and egress traffic and disallow unauthorized communications.\n\nThere are two types of firewalls—the host firewall and the network firewall. The host firewall protects\na specific host. It can be part of the OS, or it can be an appliance directly in line with the host. The type of\nfirewall used provides protection for the network using one of several techniques:\n\n - Packet filtering\n\n-- This type of firewall filters traffic based on rules. They control traffic based on the first three levels\n\nof the open systems interconnection (OSI) model: MAC address and IP address, with some filtering\nbased on the transport layer (port numbers).\n\n - Circuit level gateways\n\n-- These types of firewalls allow only specific sessions to communicate.\n\n - Proxy level gateways\n\n-- This firewall provides filtering at the application layer. In other words, it limits the types of appli­\n\ncations and protocols that communicate across security boundaries such as File Transfer Protocol\n(FTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and so forth.\n\n - Stateful inspection\n\n-- Cybersecurity experts call this type of firewall stateful because it keeps track of the “state” of the\n\nconnections crossing the firewall. They match the packets with the different types of connections to\ndetermine what to allow or reject.\n\n\n-----\n\ntion needs to ensure that placement of the firewall does not enable an individual or device to bypass the\nsecurity of the firewall. For example, a computer with two network interface cards (NICs), often referred\nto as a “dual-homed” host, introduces cyber risk when one card connects to the corporate network and the\nother connects to the process control network (commonly used for the convenience of Operations Manag­\ners, ICS engineers, and so forth). Even though this type of configuration eases management and reduces\ncomplexity, it effectively bypasses perimeter protection mechanisms (such as a firewall) and can create a\nsignificant vulnerability that threat actors can exploit in virtual environments as well.\n\nSystem administrators should layer the firewall rule set as shown in Figure 7 . Best practices apply at\nevery level to ensure that only the traffic specifically allowed at each level passes through the firewall. It\nis also critical to keep rules up to date, because even a slight change could reduce effectiveness against\ncurrent intrusion vectors/vulnerabilities. Rule changes and rule order can affect data flow permissions, so\ntest them to ensure that the change does not negate security. Periodic reviews of firewall placement and\nrules will help ensure that defenses are maintained.\n\n#### Corporate\n Vendor's\n Host\n network-specific\n default\n rules\n rules\n rule set\n\n ICS Traffic and\n Protocol-specific\n specific application\n rules\n rules filtering\n\n###### Figure 7. ICS firewall rule set layers.\n\nImproperly placing a firewall can result in the firewall being less effective. Bypassing the firewall,\nwhether intentional or not, is a fairly common occurrence. Modems that connect directly to process equip­\nment, vendor VPNs that connect directly into the process control network, wireless access points, and\ndual-NIC computers all invalidate the effectiveness of the firewall.\n\n###### 2.5.3  Diodes\n\nA unidirectional network device (also referred to as a unidirectional security gateway or data diode)\nis a network appliance or device that allows data to travel in only one direction. Users can find them most\ncommonly in high security environments, such as defense, where they serve as connections between two\nor more networks of differing security classifications. This technology can now be found at the industrial\ncontrol level for such facilities as nuclear power plants and electric power generation.\n\nThe physical nature of unidirectional networks only allows data to pass from one side of a network\nconnection to another and not the other way around. The benefits for the users of the higher criticality\n(high side) network, such as an ICS segment, include the ability to share data with a lower criticality (low\nside) network, such as a server in a DMZ, while preventing communications access from the low side\nnetwork to the ICS network. Traditionally, when the enterprise network provides DMZ server access for\n\nh i d h d l bl i i f h i k i h\n\n\n#### Corporate\n Vendor's\n Host\n network-specific\n default\n rules\n rules\n rule set\n\n ICS Traffic and\n Protocol-specific\n specific application\n rules\n rules filtering\n\n\n#### Protocol-specific rules\n\n\n-----\n\nnet connectivity, one can achieve the best of both worlds, enabling the connectivity required and assuring\nsecurity. This holds true even if both the low and the high network are compromised, because the traffic\nflow control is physical in nature.\n\nThe controlled interface that comprises the send and receive elements of a unidirectional network acts\n[as a one-way “communications protocol break” between both two-way network domains it connects. This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol)\n[does not preclude the unidirectional network’s use in transferring protocols like TCP that require commu­](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP)\n[nications (including acknowledgments) between sender and receiver.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acknowledgement_(data_networks))\n\nThe electrical sector has used data diodes for several years, and regulators have encouraged their use\nto protect equipment and processes in SISs. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) now mandates\nthe use of data diodes and many other sectors, in addition to electrical and nuclear, also use data diodes\neffectively.\n\n###### 2.5.4  Access and Authentication Controls\n\nIn most ICS networks, many different systems are used by a number of different users, and the sys­\ntems must be accessed quickly as system operations requires. Corporate authentication, authorization, and\naccount management practices can be problematic for ICS, because ICSs are “always on,” stopping the\nsystem for users to log out and log back in is usually not a viable option. Also, authentication processes\nprovided by ICS suppliers may be limited. Managing many users in disparate locations becomes a chal­\nlenge as one adds and removes system access and user roles change. The same authentication process may\ncontrol access to many systems (HMIs, field devices, SCADA servers) and networks (remote substation\nLANs), which may require the use of shared credentials.\n\nAsset owners can control access to ICS systems using either a distributed or centralized approach.\nDistributed access management requires that each system perform authentication separately. Each system\nuses a separate set of user accounts, credentials, and roles. This approach, while a good solution for small\nICS implementations, does not scale well for large organizations.\n\nOrganizations normally use centralized account management to handle large numbers of users and ac­\ncounts. Usually, it requires a central authentication system (for example, Active Directory or Lightweight\nDirectory Access Protocol (LDAP)) to manage the accounts. An authentication protocol (for example,\nKerberos, Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), or Terminal Access Controller Ac­\ncess-Control System (TACACS)) communicates between the authentication server and the ICS. A cen­\ntralized approach is scalable to large system implementations; however, it also introduces risk when used\nin ICS environments. The centralized servers must be highly secure because, if the authentication server\nbecomes compromised, the entire ICS may be compromised. They are also required to be available in\ncase of emergency, so one might need redundant servers that can be expensive.\n\n###### 2.5.5  Bring-Your-Own-Device\n\nOperations, maintenance, and engineering personnel in ICS environments are implementing portable\ncomputing devices such as tablets, smart phones, and laptops. A number of organizations are actively\npromoting their use because of their popularity and the convenience of mobility while maintaining access.\nThe problem with these devices stems from the fact that the organization does not typically manage them,\ntherefore the security policies implemented by the organization do not get implemented on the portable\ndevices. People also use these devices to access personal email, game apps, web pages, and social media\napplications, so the inherent security risks of public access make the Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD)\nconcept inherently high risk to critical infrastructure. The organization must consider the risk and enact\nappropriate measures, such as mobile device management (MDM) systems, to mitigate the risk and bring\nit to an acceptable level.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe host or workstation level implements another layer of security. Firewalls protect most devices\nwithin a network from intrusion from the outside; however, a good security model requires multitier lay­\ners of defense. This is particularly important for HMI clients that connect to the network from outside the\ntrusted ICS network boundary, either via a VPN connection or any other means. Completely securing the\nnetwork means securing all hosts as well.\n\nRequirements for host security are well known in order to protect a machine/host while installing and\nusing various operating systems and applications. The following guidelines provide some recommenda­\ntions that organizations should consider as part of a security policy for system operations to help keep\nICSs secure. In general, consider the following steps for every ICS host or device that is placed on the OT\nnetwork, regardless of operating system:\n\n - Install and configure a host-based firewall.\n\n - Choose strong passwords for all accounts on the system, and change any default or well-known ac­\n\ncounts on the device (preferably, enforce strong passwords and password expiration through operating\nsystem capabilities).\n\nChange passwords on a pre-defined schedule-usually every 30 and not more than 90 days.\n\n - Install screen savers with short intervals and with a password requirement to log in where possible.\n\n - Install and keep operating system patches and hardware firmware patches current.\n\n - Configure and monitor logs on the device.\n\n - Disable unused services and accounts or those that are no longer necessary.\n\n - Replace insecure services (such as telnet, remote shell (RSH), or rlogin) with more secure alternatives\n\nsuch as SSH.\n\n - Restrict access to services that one cannot disable, where possible.\n\n###### • Make and test backups of the system in a consistent manner if not centrally controlled.\n\n - Secure laptops and other portable and mobile devices not continuously connected to the network.\n\nThe same requirements as stated above apply to these devices as well, where feasible, regardless of\nthe platforms and management techniques used.\n\nPLCs and other operational control technologies, by and large, do not support many recommended\nhost-based protection practices and security mechanisms. Defense-in-Depth controls for those devices\nusually apply at the network level. However, many HMI systems are based on common platforms and\nadministrators should lock them down (for example, disable unneeded services, disable unneeded ports,\nrestrict access, use kernel locking) to the fullest extent possible while ensuring continued functionality.\nAsset owners should remove any software installed natively on the system that they do not need or use.\nFor example, an HMI used for command and control does not need standard corporate software packages\nsuch as word processing, spreadsheets, and email clients.\n\nSystem configurations should be actively managed throughout the system life cycle. There are a num­\nber of techniques that organizations can use such as creating a secure image to configure new equipment,\nequipment re-builds that only contain required software, and configuration of devices with only required\nservices and ports.\n\n###### 2.6.1  Patch and Vulnerability Management\n\nApplying patches to ICS components presents a challenge to system administrators, because system\nupdates and patches can interfere with the ICS function. A patch to an ICS component could change the way\nit works, resulting in component failure or loss of functionality. System administrators should test all patches\noff-line in a test environment that contains the same model and type of ICS to determine whether the patch has\n\ni d d Al ICS ili ld OS i hi h h d\n\n\n-----\n\nmanagement solution, and the application of patches to ICS should occur only during planned outages.\nOrganizations should develop a systematic patch and vulnerability management approach for ICS and\nensure that it reduces the exposure to system vulnerabilities while ensuring ongoing ICS operations.\n\nAdministrators should schedule software upgrades and patch management procedures at routine\nintervals. The development of procedures to incorporate security patches promptly and current software\nrecommendations on a regular basis can substantially limit opportunities for hostile parties to target newly\ndiscovered vulnerabilities, which receive wide and immediate publicity. Organizations should institute\npractices to protect themselves without granting ample time for would-be intruders to apply the new\nknowledge against critical systems.[3]\n\n###### 2.6.2  Field Devices\n\nMany field devices, such as older PLCs, remote terminal units (RTUs), and intelligent electronic de­\nvices (IEDs), are not capable of centralized management. They also may not have the security capabilities\nthat other components such as workstations may have (for example, limited password length and char­\nacters that can be used). Most often, asset owners physically protect these devices behind fences, behind\nlocked doors, or in locked cabinets; however, they should also lock down their configuration (for exam­\nple, disable unneeded services, disable unneeded ports, restrict access, use kernel locking) to the fullest\nextent possible while ensuring continued functionality.\n\nField personnel are increasingly using portable devices such as tablets and smart phones for in-field\ncontrol functionality. System administrators must secure these devices to the fullest extent possible,\nremove or turn off any unnecessary services (such as email capability), and keep them up to date with\nthe latest security patches to ensure they do not introduce malicious code into the ICS. Furthermore, the\ncompany should manage any device used to interface with the ICS to ensure it meets all corporate securi­\nty standards.\n\n###### 2.6.3  Virtual Machines\n\nAsset owners are implementing and leveraging virtual machine (VM) technology as a method of\nreducing capital equipment, managing device recovery, and running multiple disparate guest operating\nsystems on a single physical host machine. The ICS-CERT site assessment program notes that in many\nindustry implementations asset owners apply inadequate user access security controls to the hypervisor\nhost management interface. This provides a single point of entry that threat actors could use to control\nevery guest VM on the host. Place these interfaces in management networks with strict and logged zone\naccess control. When the physical host contains both DMZ and ICS servers, administrators should harden\nthe networks and NICs and delete all others to prevent opening up a bridged scenario. Patching hypervi­\nsors is critical, and, when doing so, the OT and IT departments should coordinate to avoid impact to ICS\nprocessors.\n\n###### 2.7  Security Monitoring\n\nMonitoring systems and networks for changes, anomalous behaviors, or for attack signatures can be\ndifficult in an ICS environment; however, monitoring and detection capabilities are essential to the De­\nfense-in-Depth concept of protecting critical assets. Having an electronic boundary around the ICS is not\nsufficient to protect critical assets from unauthorized access, because for each protection put into place in\na network environment, threat actors can find a method around it. The concept of Defense in Depth says\na system must detect and alert an organization of an intrusion early on so they can take defensive action\nbefore critical assets are breached. Most IT organizations have some level of monitoring at the corporate\nlevel, but they rarely implement it in the ICS networks.\n\nWithout system monitoring in place, intruders could breach the system and no one would know of\nthe intrusion before they achieved their objective, if they know at all. While the ICS vendor community is\n\n3 C ll J _S_ _f I d_ _i l C_ _l S_ _S_ _i_\n\n\n-----\n\nmonitoring capabilities into ICS is in its infancy. Asset owners can and should take action to ensure that\nsecurity personnel and OT operators know of changes to systems or behaviors that indicate a potential\nnetwork intrusion.\n\nOrganizations can monitor networks and collect information about networks in many ways, such as us­\ning centralized syslog servers for Linux and network devices and to centrally collect Windows Events using\nWinRM (Windows Remote Management) and WEVTUTIL (Windows event log tool) utilities. However, or­\nganizations must review these events (logs). Solutions, such as security information and event management\n(SIEM) products, combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM)\nand can collect, log, and correlate information from multiple sources and alert on anomalous or specified\nactivity and/or provide real-time analysis. Canaries and honeypots/honeynets can also flag any unauthorized\nintrusion, and asset owners should consider them for use in high criticality/high risk areas.\n\n###### 2.7.1  Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems\n\nICS environments provide a unique opportunity when considering protection mechanisms to place\non the network: despite considerable network traffic, that traffic is very predictable. For example, in a\ntypical ICS environment, the PLC communicates in a standardized way with the HMI and the historian;\nall applications and services on the process control system (PCS) network are known (or should be); and\nthe protocols, web traffic, and proprietary traffic are known and predictable.\n\nAsset owners can use an IDS solution to easily monitor and create alarms for any traffic outside\nnormal operations. An IDS is based on the passive monitoring of network traffic. Expected network traffic\nis deterministic, and deviations are used as triggers for alerting. Simple rules can be written to monitor\nfor IP sources and destinations, protocols, lengths of packets, and so forth. Also, many ICS vendors can\nprovide traffic signatures for their equipment.\n\nIPS solutions are in-line with firewalls or ICS equipment and can take action by blocking traffic\nthat does not meet the defined rules. Many vendors and asset owners become nervous about using IPS,\nbecause it has the potential to stop a process (and therefore stop operations). However, because of the\ndeterministic nature of ICS traffic, they can be tuned to trigger only on extreme anomalies.\n\nIDSs/IPSs are a vital part of the Defense-in-Depth strategy, because so many inherent vulnerabilities\nare within the ICS network, and an individual can only do so much to monitor potentially unwanted traf­\nfic. An IDS/IPS provides an automated way to watch for and respond to the unexpected. However, IDS/\nIPSs cannot do everything, as shown in Figure 8.\n\n##### An IDS/IPS CAN An IDS/IPS CANNOT\n\n        - Forewarn: detect activity that may        - Determine whether the system\nforeshadow a real attack (scans, etc.) was exploited\n\n       - Provide data to determine what happened        - Monitor the actions taken by the\n\nsystem console\n\n        - Allow better situational awareness by\nmonitoring typical behavior of the network        - Perform the necessary analysis\n\nof an event\n\n###### Fi 8 IDS/IPS li it ti\n\n|DS/I|PS|\n|---|---|\n\n|C|AN|\n|---|---|\n\n|DS/I|PS|\n|---|---|\n\n|C|AN|NOT|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n##### An IDS/IPS CAN An IDS/IPS CANNOT\n\n     - Forewarn: detect activity that may     - Determine whether the system\nforeshadow a real attack (scans, etc.) was exploited\n\n    - Provide data to determine what happened     - Monitor the actions taken by the\n\nsystem console\n\n     - Allow better situational awareness by\nmonitoring typical behavior of the network      - Perform the necessary analysis\n\nof an event\n\n\n-----\n\ncomputer. Application level detection systems (ALDSs) monitor an application’s state.\n\nUsing IDS to monitor the network and/or system is not a “silver bullet.” An IDS is more of a warning\nor audit system. IDSs can alert to possible misconfigured systems on the network and will alert when an\nintruder is compromising a system using a known method. It often takes more than one method or device\nto provide the most complete information about an event. All methods of intrusion detection involve the\ngathering and analysis of information from various sources within a computer, network, and enterprise to\nidentify possible threats posed by hackers inside or outside the organization. File integrity checking tools\nare common in most environments.\n\n[Open Source Security (OSSEC) is an Open Source HIDS that performs log analysis, file integrity](http://www.ossec.net)\nchecking, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real-time alerting, and active response. It runs on most op­\nerating systems, including Linux, Mac OS, Solaris, Windows, and others. The main issue with any HIDS\nin any environment (especially ICS) is the computer resource penalty incurred to get a particular user\nrequired security level. Table 3 identifies signature versus anomaly detection and their characteristics.\n\n###### Table 3.

Detection basis considerations.\n\n Selection Considerations\n\n                     - Scans network traffic (packets) for known patterns\n\n                     - Only scans traffic on or from its home network\n\n                    - Can scan both sides of a conversation\n\n###### Signature-based Detection:\n\n                     - Could be reactive and block traffic (IPS mode)\n\n                     - Does not differentiate traffic - often does not know whether\n\na system is Windows, Linux, or a PLC\n\n                     - Must teach system to identify “normal” network traffic (and\n\nwhat if learning period includes attacks?)\n\n                    - Detects deviations from normal behavior\n\n###### Anomaly-based Detection: • More difficult to spoof\n\n                    - Needs no foreknowledge of attack signatures\n\n                     - May raise more false positives\n\n                    - Very hard to implement in a dynamic environment\n\nLike firewalls, organizations must strategically locate IDS sensors to obtain the most value. As a gen­\neral rule, they should locate them in high traffic locations and/or between security boundaries or networks\nwith sensitive information.\n\nNetwork-based IDSs/IPSs scan the network topology for “bad” traffic while HIDSs/ALDSs monitor\neach host and report to a central logging facility. The central logging system needs to be a very secure\nsystem to prevent bypassing and perhaps inactivating the systems. Attach an NIDS/IPS to the modem\npool and wireless access points. Statistically, this is the most often forgotten entry point for “bad” traffic.\n\nOrganizations should view alerts as similar to process alarms. Process alarms alert operators to\nprocess conditions that warrant attention. Likewise, intrusion detection alarms alert network operators\nto network conditions that warrant attention. Use basic logic when configuring alarms and alerts. For\nexample, if a user typically logs on between 0800 and 1600, and for any reason logs on at 0300, the IDS\nshould detect this activity and generate an alert. Anomaly detection is difficult to implement in a typical\nIT network because of the dynamic nature of the environment; however, ICS networks and systems’ pre­\ndictability lends itself well to the use of these technologies.\n\nPotential complications with using IDS/IPS include the fact that it takes a significant amount of work\nto write rules and requires thorough testing to ensure that the rules function properly. In addition, an IPS\ncan modify/drop legitimate packets if the rules are written improperly. This could prevent alarms from\nreaching the operator or configuration changes from reaching their intended destination; therefore, it may\nrequire great care and significant testing to ensure that unintended consequences are not introduced into\nthe system. Many organizations use IDS that have quite sophisticated functionality for managing security\nzones for this purpose.\n\n###### 2.7.2  Security Audit Logging\n\nSecurity audit logs provide information about login activity, resource use, file modifications, and other\nsecurity-relevant information. Without properly configured and maintained auditing and logging practices\nin place, incident response teams often cannot determine the significance of a potential event. Properly\nconfigured audit logs at the network, host, and application levels provide critical information for deter­\nmining how an incident occurred, the impact and scope of the issue, and how best to deter future events.\n\n|Table 4. Detection basis considerations.|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Selection Considerations||\n|Signature-based Detection:|• Scans network traffic (packets) for known patterns • Only scans traffic on or from its home network • Can scan both sides of a conversation • Could be reactive and block traffic (IPS mode) • Does not differentiate traffic - often does not know whether a system is Windows, Linux, or a PLC|\n|Anomaly-based Detection:|• Must teach system to identify “normal” network traffic (and what if learning period includes attacks?) • Detects deviations from normal behavior • More difficult to spoof • Needs no foreknowledge of attack signatures • May raise more false positives • Very hard to implement in a dynamic environment|\n\n\n###### Selection Considerations\n\n\n-----\n\nes, operating systems, and applications. Security control settings and user access controls enforce those\nrequirements. When asset owners do not configure systems and applications to capture key events, they\nfail to capture important event data, and incident response teams may not have sufficient information to\ndetermine the cause of an event. A baseline of expected traffic and process functionality for normal and\noff-normal operations and system use allows security, process control, and control systems operations per­\nsonnel to isolate unusual data traffic or user actions that may indicate potential security-impacting events.\n\nNewer operating systems and applications provide more detailed configuration and event auditing\noptions than their legacy counterparts; however, using the default configuration for most operating and\napplication logs only provides minimal audit capabilities, and organizations may miss a critical event. It is\nimportant that control system administrative and security personnel perform a review of all audit capabil­\nities and configure the systems to provide the data needed to both capture all potentially relevant events\nand to ensure that the settings do not generate unneeded logs that can overwhelm system storage capaci­\nties. Also, default configurations may allow data to be overwritten; therefore, export all logs to a central\nserver or event management capability to ensure that they are available if needed.\n\n###### 2.7.3  Security Incident and Event Monitoring\n\nSIEM technologies support the incident response process, but they can support ICS operations as\nwell. When configured and analyzed correctly, the data can assist in predicting equipment failure, equip­\nment capacity, and failure points as well as providing security information. Asset owners can configure\nthem to provide alerts when a potential security intrusion occurs, and they can aggregate a vast amount of\naudit data that accumulates from ICS components. By providing visibility into aggregated security data,\nSIEMs can minimize incident response time.\n\nA SIEM centralizes data from network devices, operating systems, applications, and databases within\ncomplex environments, such as control system networks. It streamlines the audit log review process, by\nporting logs from multiple systems into one solution that eliminates the time and effort required for manu­\nal log reviews. Organizations can set up a SIEM to integrate multiple log formats from widely distributed\nsources, and collect the information both remotely and automatically. The SIEM can also integrate IDS/\nIPS information and scanning results and generate alerts on identified traffic patterns. A SIEM’s analysis\nengine speeds data processing and formatting time, making it cheaper and easier to review functional,\noperational, and security data. In addition, using a SIEM provides the ability to select specific events for\ncompliance reporting, root cause failure analysis, and incident detection.\n\n###### 2.8  Vendor Management and Security\n\nVendors represent a special case within the framework of a strong Defense-in-Depth program. In the\nlast several years, vendors have become aware of the importance of cybersecurity in industrial control\nsolutions and, in many cases, have incorporated security into their product life cycle to meet emerging\nmarket demands. Although not every vendor is taking this approach, many of the leading vendors are.\nThey have seen the cyber vulnerabilities associated with ICSs—especially after the publicity of exploits\nsuch as Stuxnet, SQL Slammer Worm, and others. One should not assume, however, that vendors always\nfollow stringent security practices. The organization should present and address requirements for control\nsystem security in great clarity early in the procurement process. This is not only advantageous to the\nasset owner but also provides the vendors specific guidance on what functionality they need.\n\nOver the last several years, asset owners and vendors have benefited from a tremendous amount of\nwork done in developing procurement guidance. This guidance has resulted in progress toward securing\nseveral vendor solutions applicable to many different sectors. The Department of Energy (DOE) devel­\n[oped procurement language considerations to help ensure that products meet requirements. This guidance](http://www.energy.gov/oe/downloads/cybersecurity-procurement-language-energy-delivery-april-2014)\ndocument provides baseline procurement language for use by asset owners, operators, integrators, and\nsuppliers during the procurement process. In addition, a more generalized procurement language docu­\n\n\n-----\n\ning equipment, for managing and monitoring ICS security developments, and to ensure the solution meets\nthe organization’s requirements.\n\n###### 2.8.1  Supply Chain Management\n\nThe supply chain represents a significant risk to ICS systems. ICS manufacturers and software de­\nvelopers create their products in many different locations around the world. Ensuring the security of the\nsystem or application throughout its development life cycle is impossible for most ICS operators. Pur­\nchasing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies increases the likelihood of receiving nongenuine\n[equipment. Also, ICS-CERT is aware of reports related to equipment with embedded unauthorized code](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat)\nin its firmware or operating system that provides a back door into the equipment or allows the program to\n“call home” once installed. To help mitigate these threats, asset owners must pay careful attention to pro­\ncurement contract arrangements, quality control, and validation of performance to specifications process­\nes. In addition, exhaustive testing, including vulnerability scanning, is an important task to perform before\ninstalling systems in production environments.\n\nNIST SP 800-161, “Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and\nOrganizations (April 2015),” defines the supply chain compromise as, “An occurrence within the Infor­\nmation and Communications Technology (ICT) supply chain whereby an adversary jeopardizes the con­\nfidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system or the information the system processes, stores, or trans­\nmits. An ICT supply chain compromise can occur anywhere within the system development life cycle of\nthe product or service.”\n\nSupply chain compromises have occurred in the ICS/IT environment for a number of years. A typical\ncompromise includes some or all the following:\n\n - Network or computer hardware with malware installed,\n\n - Software or hardware with malware inserted by various means,\n\n - Vulnerabilities in software applications and networks within the supply chain, and\n\n - Counterfeit computer hardware.\n\nOf particular concern with regard to supply chain risk is the information regarding the operation of\nsensitive hardware/software that vendors generally provided on their web sites. Threat actors can easily\nfind default passwords, operational instructions, vendor manuals, and information provided by the users\nof software and/or hardware on the Internet (in white papers, blogs, social media, and so forth). Adversar­\nies armed with this information are well equipped to compromise these systems.\n\nIn the long term, ICS owners should work with vendors and encourage them to design ICS using\nattack-resilient algorithms and architectures and to design and operate control systems to survive an inten­\ntional cyber assault with no loss of critical functions. The goal should be to design systems whereby even\nif intruders manage to bypass some basic security mechanisms, they will still face several control-specific\nsecurity devices that will minimize the damage done to the system.\n\n###### 2.8.2  Managed Services/Outsourcing\n\nMany organizations utilize managed services and/or outsourcing for functions that require highly\nspecialized technologies and/or skills. It is not uncommon for organizations to outsource many IT security\nfunctions such as incident response forensics, cyber vulnerability assessments, risk management, supply\nchain management, or other functions that they rarely use or that requires expertise they don’t have. The\nprimary advantage of outsourcing is that it is cost effective to the organization. Maintaining a full-time\nforensics staff, for instance, is costly due to their high level of expertise, yet an organization needs them\nduring incident investigations.\n\n\n-----\n\noutsourced firm’s responsibilities. If the firm does not meet the requirements of the SLA, the organization\nreserves the right to terminate the contract. When engaging with an outside entity for security services,\nit is important that both sides agree on roles, responsibilities, incident handling and reporting, and also\nthe security of any interconnections, remote access policies and procedures, or interfaces that a user may\nrequire. In addition to the SLA, organizations should develop a memorandum of understanding/memo­\nrandum of agreement (MOU/MOA) and interconnection security agreement (ISA) to outline the specific\nmanagement and technical requirements for the services.\n\nWhen engaging with an outside party to perform technical assessments or testing, all parties should\nestablish and agree on rules of engagement (RoE). Cyber vulnerability assessments typically require some\nlevel of passive or active scanning or testing on the target systems, which means the assessors must either\naccess or watch others access critical cyber assets within the control system environment. The assessment\nteam lead works with their organizational counterpart to ensure that the testing activities do not interfere\nwith client operations and also to agree on actions to take and notification protocols should the activity\ncause any problems for the organization. The RoE includes direction about what activities may take place\nin what systems and who may perform those activities. It includes decisions about whether testing takes\nplace within the primary (active production) control system or some credible substitute such as a backup\nor secondary control system, a test network, or stand-alone system. Avoid active scanning production\ncontrol systems, as they can cause operational issues or create a denial-of-service condition. Passive\nactivities, such as network sniffing, may be adequate. If using a substitute system, compare it to the active\nsystem to ensure that they are identical in operation. The assessment team and the organization will also\nneed to agree on who will have their “hands on the keyboard” during testing—especially when active\n(production) control systems are the target. Local personnel should perform all tests on an active control\nsystem at the direction of the assessment team.\n\n###### 2.8.3  Leveraging Cloud Services\n\nSome ICS organizations are using cloud services for data storage and are considering other ways to\nmake use of them for additional services in support of their ICS architectures. From a security perspec­\ntive, any portion of any externally hosted ICS architecture must provide a level of security hardening\ncommensurate with the criticality of the function it hosts. In addition, the organization must consider\nICS information integrity, security, and confidentiality, as well as the functional and operational details\nassociated with recovery, event/incident management, failover, forensic support, monitoring, and other\noperational sequences that require special support by the cloud-hosting service provider. Other areas that\norganizations can overlook when considering shifting resources to the cloud are the reliance on Internet\nservice provider (ISP) connections on premises and the potential bandwidth increases that can take place.\nLegal instruments and the use of SLAs are important because all operational support requirements must\nbe explicitly identified to ensure that the expectations for support by the cloud providers, ISP availability,\nand bandwidth capacity are fully covered to avoid surprises later if an operational issue arises. There are\nother issues to consider as well, including the effects of load balancing and other possible impacts if the\ncloud provider experiences a surge in the use of their available resources.\n\n###### 2.9  The Human Element\n\nOrganizations face many challenges in managing the human factor within ICS organizations. Large\nand complex systems are susceptible to mistakes made by inexperienced or untrained personnel, as well\nas the activities of malicious insider threats.\n\n\n-----\n\nClear, actionable policies are necessary to lay the framework for rigorous controls that secure ICS\ntechnologies and also provide the governance needed to manage human factors. Policies lay the frame­\nwork for detailed procedures and set the expectations of the organization with regard to the functions\nperformed. Policies outline the rules with regard to securing the ICS—stating expected rules of behavior\nand also required controls. Policies outline what must and must not occur and set forth sanctions for non­\ncompliance.\n\n###### 2.9.2  Procedures\n\nHistorically, security management was the responsibility of the corporate IT security organization,\nusually governed by operating plans and procedures that protect vital corporate information assets. As\nICSs become part of larger conjoined network architectures, organizations must update security proce­\ndures to cover the control system domain as well.\n\nOrganizations should design procedures to state how personnel should conduct a particular process,\nor configure a particular system, to ensure secure functioning and provide a standard, repeatable means\nto accomplish a task in a safe manner. ICS security procedures also allow an organization to quickly train\nnew personnel and to ensure that they follow all required regulations and standards uniformly across the\nOT space. ICS security procedures also instruct ICS operators on the steps to take in order to protect the\nICS from a cyber-based intrusion. Network-based security procedures are especially important for the ICS\ndomain, because the use of unique vendorspecific protocols and legacy systems may hamper efforts to\nprotect mission critical systems.\n\n###### 2.9.3  Training and Awareness\n\nMany organizations overlook security training and awareness activities more often than many other\nareas in ICS operations. OT owners and operators rely on their intimate system and process knowledge\nto ensure the proper functioning of the system, and they usually allocate training time and resources only\nfor system functionality-related purposes. As ICSs become more interconnected and cyber threats and\nvulnerabilities rise, it is critically important for organizations to ensure that they require and support ICS\nsecurity-specific training. IT implementers and OT operators should know what the indicators of poten­\ntial compromise look like and what steps they should take to ensure that a cyber investigation succeeds.\nIT and ICS management should also know what they can do to make the system more secure so they can\nmake informed decisions with regard to the cost/benefits of the protection measures they put into place.\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore deciding which Defense-in-Depth protections an organization needs for its ICS environment,\nit is important to understand the methods used by malicious actors to successfully attack these systems.\nMany of the techniques used by threat agents are the same as those used by security professionals to test\nnetworks and systems for vulnerabilities and to determine which Defense-in-Depth countermeasures to\nput into place. It is a constant “cat and mouse” game, and the challenge is to ensure that the information\nand systems accessible to infiltration are constantly monitored and updated to protect against ever-emerg­\ning threats.\n\n###### 3.1  Anatomy of a Cyber Attack\n\nA cyber attack generally follows a process allowing the attacker to perform reconnaissance or discov­\nery of the targeted business, then develops and executes the attack, and finally uses the attacker’s com­\nmand and control presence to extract data and/or achieve the attacker’s goals on the target system. Figure\n9 shows the sequence of operations for conducting an attack.\n\n###### • Characterize systems\n\n## Discovery\n\n###### • Find weaknesses and vulnerabilities\n\n • Exploit vulnerable\n\n## Attack people, processes,\n\n###### and components\n\n • Data exfiltration, denial\n\n## Intrusion of service, command and\n\n###### control operations\n\n Figure 9. Attack sequence of operations.\n\nIn the discovery phase, a threat agent performs reconnaissance by probing the network perimeter to\ncharacterize the system, that is, determine if there is a firewall (and what type), what types of web or other\nInternet facing servers are used, and whether there are any open communication ports. The goal is to find\nany way possible to get into the system. They may also harvest publicly available corporate information\n(company principal’s names and email addresses, photos that may show physical security barriers, sup­\nport personnel names and numbers) to gain any advantage they can for social engineering or email-based\nattacks. Once they find a way in, they select an attack method and begin the actual attack.\n\n\nA cyber attack generally follows a process allowing the attacker to perform reconnaissance or discov­\nery of the targeted business, then develops and executes the attack, and finally uses the attacker’s com­\nmand and control presence to extract data and/or achieve the attacker’s goals on the target system. Figure\n9 shows the sequence of operations for conducting an attack.\n\n## Discovery\n\n###### vulnerabilities\n\n## Attack\n\n Intrusion\n\n\n## Attack\n\n\n-----\n\ning up at a site dressed as a worker. At this point, the goal is to exploit any and all vulnerable people,\nprocesses, or components to gain entry. Adversaries may have a direct target in mind or merely wish to\ndeposit code on any available machine in order to maintain a presence on the network or system and to\nallow for future unauthorized access. Generally, the goal at this point is to maintain continued surveillance\nusing a light footing, many times covering their attack tracks as they go.\n\nOnce they have found their access point, intruders can accomplish their intent through network in­\ntrusion—whether it is data exfiltration, creating a denial of service, or taking over command and control\nof the process, system, or the entire network. Many intruders leave residual back doors, accounts, or port\nopenings for future or continued access. Once they have compromised a system, they may access it multi­\nple times and may also use it to access other systems.\n\nThis section outlines how these elements are executed in a control system context, and also describes\nsome common attack scenarios that intruders have used or can use against ICS environments. Some are\nwell known in the IT security community as “tried and true” attack methods, and some are unique be­\ncause the intruders specifically designed them for attacking critical infrastructure.\n\n###### 3.2  Discovery\n\nAsset discovery allows a potential intruder to decide what systems to target, to gauge how easy it will\nbe to launch an attack on a particular entity, and to find weaknesses in the target’s security, which allows\nthem to determine the best method for launching a successful attack.\n\n###### 3.2.1  System Characterization\n\nMany ways are available to gather information about a site and its systems. Physical surveillance,\npublic domain information aggregation, and scanning are the three most common methods in this phase.\n\nPhysical characterization methods can range from simply looking at the facility (looking for cameras,\nlocks, fences, guards) to bolder approaches such as walking into the facility and asking for a tour or pos­\ning as a vendor, maintenance person, or even an employee’s visiting friend. It is amazing how much infor­\nmation one can gather this way. A pile of boxes outside a facility can give a would-be intruder insight into\nwhat new equipment the asset owner is installing. Tours can provide a wealth of information, including\nhow well an organization has physically protected a particular site; what systems are on site and where\nthey are located; and how the operations are conducted. Another way to get information is to befriend an\ninsider. A seemingly innocent conversation about work can allow an intruder to gather a wealth of infor­\nmation about the control systems at a site and how well the organization protects them.\n\nElectronic asset discovery methods can range from simply collecting and aggregating seemingly\nrandom information accessible through the public domain to using freely available tools to fingerprint\nsystems.\n\nPublic domain information, such as lists of locations, vendor partnership announcements, requests for\nproposals, lists of company principals and their contact information, contact lookup engines, job open­\nings, and even holiday closure calendars, can provide an intruder with spear-phishing targets and content,\ntimes/dates when a plant or office is unattended (and, therefore, not closely monitored), device-specific\nintelligence, and also gaps in a company’s skill sets or planned system- or security-focused projects.\n\nThreat actors can easily obtain IP address ranges through domain registry searches. Crafting an Inter­\nnet query designed to return an error message can also yield information about the system (for example,\ndatabase errors often indicate that someone is using the database). Free tools, such as nMap (Network\nMapper), can tell an intruder what devices, ports, protocols, and services are open; whether a firewall is in\nplace; what type of firewall they use; and even the name of the network where they keep it.\n\nIntruders use “war dialing” to scan a range of telephone numbers for modem connections. Attackers\n\nf t ti l t l h h t bli h d b\n\n\n-----\n\nunsecured wireless access points, is a combined electronic/physical discovery method that a would-be\nintruder can also use.\n\n###### 3.2.2  Determine Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities\n\nOnce the attacker has determined potential intrusion vectors, they determine what weaknesses and\nvulnerabilities are inherent in the targeted system. Many well-known security challenges inherent in control\nsystem environments provide an intruder with a “target-rich environment” to choose their intrusion vectors.\n\nPoor configuration management is one of the most common ways that an attacker can find an opening\ninto the control system domain. General purpose OS platforms provide numerous processor and network\nservices that automatically run by default. The result is unmonitored, open ports that are vulnerable to\nnetwork exploits and actively executing code that may be subject to attacks such as buffer overflows.\nLeaving these unneeded ports and services active allows easy access for would-be intruders.\n\nBecause of the high or constant availability and critical response time requirements inherent in ICS,\nany change to the system necessitates exhaustive testing for software and security updates. Schedule all\npatching or update activities far in advance and permit them on a very infrequent basis. In addition, ICS\ncomponents may not tolerate security software because of critical timing requirements. Control system\ncomponents are often so processor-constrained that running security software itself creates unacceptably\nhigh delays in response, threatening system stability. The result is outdated OS revision levels and outdat­\ned or no malware protection software. Even if antivirus software is up to date and configured for proper\nexecution, ICSs built on standard platforms are vulnerable to newly discovered malware threats that, once\nagain, cannot be patched in a timely fashion.\n\nTechnology-related vulnerabilities within TCP/IP-based control system environments leave critical\nnetworks and systems open to compromise. Examples of vulnerabilities in IT system technologies that\ncould migrate to control system domains include the susceptibility to malicious software (including virus­\nes, worms, and so forth), escalation of privileges through code manipulation, network reconnaissance and\ndata gathering, covert traffic analysis, and unauthorized intrusions into networks, either through or around\nperimeter defenses. System vulnerabilities also include hostile mobile code such as malicious active\ncontent involving JavaScript, applets, Visual Basic (VB) Script, and Active-X. With a successful intru­\nsion into ICS networks come new issues such as reverse engineering of control system protocols, exploits\nleveraging vulnerabilities on operator consoles, and unauthorized access into trusted peer networks and\nremote facilities.\n\nOutdated, inherently insecure protocols, such as FTP and Telnet, are generally used for ICS opera­\ntions. Personnel often send passwords in the clear. One standard protocol for data communication be­\ntween control devices, object linking and embedding (OLE) for process control (OPC), must run without\nauthentication. SCADA and ICS communication protocols for control devices, such as Modbus/TCP,\nEthernet/IP and DNP3, do not typically require authentication to remotely execute commands on a control\ndevice, and no encryption options are available.\n\nMost devices lack even the most basic access control separating system software mode versus appli­\ncation program mode. Server and terminal authentication is often nonexistent or completely ineffective.\nDifferentiation of access privileges between administrators and end users is also generally unavailable or\nnot implemented.[4]\n\nSometimes threat actors will plan a multi-pronged attack. For example, an intruder may decide to use\na targeted spear-phishing attack to infiltrate the corporate network and use it as a vector into the control\nsystem architecture. The intruder may use both war dialing and war driving to find open modem con­\nnections and wireless networks connected to ICS and then use common vulnerabilities in the operating\nsystems, applications and/or databases discovered while scanning to use specific exploits tailored for a\nparticular system.\n\n[4 Caswell Jayne Survey of Industrial Control Systems Security](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse571-11/ftp/ics.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis section describes some common intrusion methods, many of which intruders have launched\n[against critical infrastructure sectors across the world. The ICS-CERT 2014 Year in Review reports the](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/Annual_Reports/Year_in_Review_FY2014_Final.pdf)\nfollowing vectors as the most prevalent for that fiscal year:\n\n - Weak authentication,\n\n - Network scanning/probing,\n\n - Removable media,\n\n - Brute force intrusion,\n\n - Abuse of access authority,\n\n - Spear phishing, and\n\n - Structured query language (SQL) injection.\n\n###### 3.3.1  BlackEnergy\n\nBlackEnergy is a crimeware toolkit that has evolved significantly since it emerged in 2007. Recent\nversions of the toolkit use social engineering to trick a user into opening an email or a document attach­\nment that drops a Trojan or infected legitimate executable file on the target computer which results in the\ninstallation of a malicious software component. The malware can infect a system by exploiting a standard\nfeature in Windows that elevates the user privilege of a system file, allowing execution of the command\nexecutable with administrative privilege—even if the user is not a member of the administrator group.\n\n[This attack scenario is targeting various specific vendor HMI products. Organizations with HMI](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-281-01B)\nsystems directly connected to the Internet are the most susceptible. The malware is highly modular, and\nthreat actors can customize it for deployment to each victim site. Once an HMI host becomes infected,\na command and control component executes to perform additional attack operations, as well as com­\nmunicate back to the attacker with data gathered and to obtain additional attack modules that search out\nadditional resources within the network for new targets of opportunity.\n\nAn alert posted by the DHS ICS-CERT provides detection and mitigation recommendations to\ndetermine if an intruder has infected a system with BlackEnergy. From a Defense-in-Depth perspective,\nusers should follow guidelines provided in the alert to address the security practices needed to protect the\nbusiness from this and other attack campaigns.\n\n###### 3.3.2  Unauthorized Access Attacks\n\nMany control system architectures are designed to have remote connections using either publicly\naccessible telephone networks or dedicated lines for modem access. When left unsecured, an attacker can\nconnect remotely with little effort, and the remote connection may be difficult to detect (assuming little or\n[no monitoring or logging). Secured modems configured with user IDs and passwords are still susceptible](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/RP_SecuringModems_S508C.pdf)\nto compromise through the use of war dialing and brute-force cracking, because it is often the case that\nthere are no automated account lockouts based on repeated unsuccessful login attempts. This was once\nconsidered an obsolete reconnaissance method; however, it is seeing a rapid resurgence due to the use of\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or legacy systems using dial-up for remote control on many critical\nsystems. Published tools have created software leveraging VoIP systems that can war-dial up to a thou­\nsand numbers hourly.\n\nIn addition, field devices are part of an internal and trusted domain, and thus access into these devices\ncan provide an intruder with a vector into the control system architecture. By gaining access into a field\ndevice, the intruder can use the trusted relationship associated with the sensor network to tunnel back into\nthe control system network. Recognizing that field devices are an extension of the control domain, intrud­\n\n\n-----\n\nscanning phases of the attack. Although such attacks are not considered possible across serial connections,\nthe increasing use of standard networking protocols in remote devices requires attention.\n\nIf an intruder compromises a device and can exert control over the device, he or she can begin to ex­\necute a number of procedures including scanning back into the internal control network, altering the data\nthat go to the control master, or changing the behavior of the device itself. If the intruder decides to scan\nback into the control network, which capitalizes on the trust between resources, it may be possible to use\nthe actual communications protocols for the entire control system domain. This is of particular advantage\nto the intruder because asset owners do not usually monitor the device-level connections for malicious or\nsuspect traffic. Some intrusion detection systems (IDSs) can be updated with industrial control systems\nsignatures to help defend control domains. Usually, these systems are signature-based and will trigger on\nseeing recognized malicious traffic. In lieu of viable signature, IDS can be deployed to trigger on nonspe­\ncific traffic, or upon seeing traffic that is not expected or unusual.\n\n###### 3.3.3  Database and SQL Data Injection Attacks\n\nDatabase applications have become core application components of ICSs and their associated record\nkeeping utilities. Traditional security models attempt to secure systems by isolating core components and\nconcentrating security efforts against threats specific to computers or software, not taking the database into\nconsideration. Databases within ICSs use generally independent systems that rely on one another for proper\nfunctionality. The high level of reliance between the two systems creates an expanded threat surface.\n\nDatabases used by ICSs often connect to databases or computers using web-enabled applications\nlocated on the business network. Virtually every data-driven application has transitioned to some form\nof database, most using SQL, with many having web interfaces that may be vulnerable to typical web\nexploits like cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection.\n\nThe information contained in databases makes them high-value targets for any attacker. When control\nsystem databases connect to business or financial databases or to computers using applications to access\nthe data, attackers can exploit the communications channel between the two networks and bypass the\nsecurity mechanisms used to protect the control system environment.\n\nMalicious code injected into a database with valuable data can have far-reaching effects, especial­\nly in a control system environment where data accuracy and integrity are critical for both business and\noperational decision-making. The cascading effect of corrupted database content can impact data acqui­\nsition servers, historians, and even the operator HMI console. ICSs are more adversely affected by SQL\ninjection than are many general IT databases, because they are so reliant on data availability and integrity.\nMoreover, compromise of key trusted assets, such as a database, creates additional resources the threat\nactors can use for both reconnaissance and code execution.\n\nGiven the reliance of ICS on the storage, accuracy, and accessibility of command and control data, as\nwell as the prevalence of SQL databases on these types of networks, standard SQL injection techniques\nused against control system components pose a major threat to control system security.\n\n\n-----\n\nA campaign called Operation Dragonfly utilized a multi-pronged intrusion chain to establish a pres­\nence on the network, perform reconnaissance, and establish a command and control capability to phone\nhome to the intruder and allow them to launch other specific attack tools. It employed the “Havex” Re­\nmote Access Trojan (RAT) within targeted spear-phishing campaigns against industry asset owners, and\nit used a watering hole campaign to circumvent the normal practice of users accessing vendor resources.\nThe next stage in the intrusion involves the enumeration of the asset owners’ OPC servers, specifically\ntargeting a vulnerability in the OPC Classic protocol. This provided the threat actor with the potential\ncapability of performing deep discovery into the ICS, often finding legacy equipment and software and\nusing the information to support the development of additional intrusion vectors that the intruder could\nuse.\n\nOver the last several years, more and more organizations have started to use underlying services in\nthese environments, some of them being the OLE, distributed component object model (DCOM), and\nremote procedure call (RPC). OPC is a real-time data communications standard based in these services.\nMany installations are moving away from the Microsoft-based OPC model; however, many still com­\nmonly use OPC for efficient connectivity with diverse ICS equipment. Also, organizations still widely\ndeploy OPC on mission critical components of a control system environment, such as HMI workstations\nand historians, highlighting a continued dependency on OPC. A recent study showed that many ICSs and\ntheir processes would have permanent historical data and production time loss if an OPC service was to\nbecome unavailable.\n\nOPC standards and application programming interfaces (APIs) that are common in control system\nenvironments are OPC Data Access, OPC Alarms, OPC Data Exchange, and OPC Data-XML. All OPC\nstandards and APIs are widely supported and used in Windows editions, and there are a wide variety of\nsecurity implications and vulnerabilities associated with the use of OPC services and standards. Vulnera­\nbilities range from simple system enumeration and password vulnerabilities to more complex remote reg­\nistry tampering and buffer overflow flaws. These vulnerabilities expose many ICSs to critical risks such as\nthe installation of undetected malware, denial-of-service attacks, escalated privileges on a host, and/or the\naccidental shutdown of ICSs because of an overload flaw.\n\nEven though many of these vulnerabilities have recommended alternate solutions or available work­\narounds, their deployment within ICS architectures have not always resulted in success. For example,\nMicrosoft has updated its recommended practice for distributed programming toward a service-oriented\narchitecture based on the .NET framework; however, the long life cycles of ICSs result in organizations\nstill using OPC and DCOM without vendor support.\n\n###### 3.3.5  Man-in-the-Middle Attacks\n\nICS environments have traditionally been considered protected because they are in a completely sep­\narate environment from IT systems (“air gapped”). In ICS networks, asset owners often do not secure the\ndata that flow between servers, resources, and devices because they assume the data reside on a “protect­\ned” network. With more and more organizations connecting ICS networks with business systems, security\nissues arise from this assumed trust, including the ability for an attacker to reroute data in transit on a\nnetwork, to capture and analyze critical traffic in plaintext format, or the ability to reverse engineer con­\ntrol protocols in order to gain command over control communications. By combining all these, an attacker\ncould assume exceptionally high control over the data flowing in a network and ultimately direct both real\nand “spoofed” traffic to network resources in support of the attacker’s desired outcome. To accomplish\nthis, the attacker executes a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, as Figure 10 shows.\n\n\n-----\n\nRTU/PLC/DCS\nController Units &\n\n###### Production\n\nField Devices\n\n###### Control System Network\n ARP Poisoning\n\nApplications\nServer\n\n###### Figure 10. Man-in-the-Middle attack.\n\nThe management of addresses in a network, be it a control system or a business LAN, is critical to its\neffective operation. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) maintains correct routing by mapping network\naddresses to physical machine addresses (MAC addresses). Using ARP tables in each of the network\ndevices ensures that computers and other devices “know” how to route their traffic when requesting\ncommunication. Manipulation (or poisoning) of the ARP tables is the key goal of the threat actor, because\npoisoning the ARP tables can force the routing of all network traffic (including control traffic) through\nthe computer the attacker has compromised. This forces all resources on the network to “talk” to the\nrogue device that the intruder is using instead of the proper machine or device without knowing they are\ncommunicating with the attacker. Moreover, the intruder can see, capture, replay, and inject data into the\nnetwork and have it interpreted as though it were authorized and originating from a trusted source.\n\nAssuming a threat actor has gained access onto the control systems network using any of the afore­\nmentioned attacks or others, they will use network reconnaissance to determine what resources are avail­\nable on that network. If the goal of the intrusion is to gain access to and compromise the control domain,\nthe asset owner can capture (sniff) plaintext traffic and take it offline for analysis and review. This allows\nthe intruder to view and re–engineer packet and payload content, modify the instruction set to accommo­\ndate the goal of the intrusion, and re-inject the new packet into the network.\n\nBy using ARP poisoning to collect traffic, the threat actor can establish and maintain control over the\ncommunications within the network. If the intruders choose, they can acquire and analyze unique control\nsystem protocols, and can see, capture, and manipulate control data. The time required to reverse engineer\nkey control data and to manipulate that data for nefarious purposes can vary depending on the skill of the\nthreat actor and the complexity of the data. By taking the data offline, the intruder is now able to work at a\ntempo that is most appropriate for him or her.\n\n\n###### Production Control System Network\n\nApplications\n\n\nApplications\n\n\n-----\n\n[attack could be catastrophic. Common vulnerabilities in ICSs such as weak authentication protocols or](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/overview-cyber-vulnerabilities)\npoor integrity checking in firmware could be exploited by a MitM exploit. By assuming control of a key\ninformation resource and performing a MitM exploit, an unauthorized intruder could:\n\n - Stop operations.\n\n - Capture, modify, and replay control data.\n\n - Inject inaccurate data to falsify information in key databases, timing clocks, and historians.\n\n - Replay normal operational data to the operator HMI while executing a malicious exploitation of the\n\nfield device (including preventing the HMI from issuing alarms).\n\n###### 3.3.6  Social Engineering Attacks\n\nAs a general rule, most people trust other people—and the “black hat” hacker community knows\nit. They have learned to prey on the positive and very human response to personal contact, whether by\nsending an email that seems to be legitimate but contains an embedded malicious payload or posing as\na trusted vendor or fellow employee in order to gain access to a system. When asset owners kept ICSs\ncontained within a stand-alone environment, they did not consider malicious code much of a risk; but as\nICS becomes more and more interconnected, ICS operators and administrators need to become more and\nmore vigilant to ensure that they do not accidentally unleash a potentially devastating virus or worm into\nthe system.\n\nMalicious actors increasingly use phishing and spear-phishing (directed email) exploits to target\ncontrol system managers and operators with the intent of introducing malicious code into the ICS envi­\nronment. It has become critical for system designers to segregate and control any connectivity between\nbusiness functions such as email and ICS operations.\n\nEqually important is ensuring the physical security of the ICS by not allowing “piggybacking” (an\nunauthorized person entering a secure area without showing proper credentials); checking to make sure\nthat maintenance workers and vendors provide proper identification before allowing them into an area\nthat contains ICS and monitoring their activities while on site; and disallowing the use of any unverified\nforeign media (for example, USBs, CDs) on the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo reduce risk to ICS networks and systems simply by deploying IT security technologies into a\ncontrol system environment may not be a viable solution. Although newer ICSs often use the same un­\nderlying protocols that are used in IT and business networks, the nature of the control systems’ reliance\non functionality (combined with operational and availability requirements) may make even ubiquitous\nsecurity technologies, such as antivirus, inappropriate. Some sectors, such as energy, transportation, and\nchemical, have time-sensitivity requirements, so latency and throughput issues introduced by security\nsolutions may cause unacceptable delays and degrade or prevent optimal system performance.\n\nAs control networks evolve from stand-alone domains to interconnected networks that coexist with\ncorporate IT environments, system administrators must apply countermeasures that do not impede func­\ntionality. Understanding vulnerabilities and the associated intrusion vectors and how to exploit them are\nessential to building an effective security mitigation strategy.\n\n###### 4.1  Proactive Security Model\n\n When protecting any information infrastructure, sound security practices start with a pro­ active security model (see Figure 11). Most security programs are reactive—applying security architectures and controls after an incident or compromise, which can be expensive and usually interrupts operations.\n\nLessons\nLearned\nPolicies and\nProcedures\n\nIncident\nResponse\n\n###### Proactive Training and\n\nAwareness\n\n###### Security\n\nVulnerability Model\nManagement\n\nThreat\nand Risk\nAssessment\n\nSecurity Asset\nControls Identification\n\nand\nManagement\n\n###### Figure 11. Proactive security as an iterative process.\n\nThe development of a robust Defense-in-Depth strategy begins with ensuring that policies and pro­\ncedures are in place to guide expected behaviors and set guidelines to train individuals to ensure they do\ntheir jobs securely. A robust Defense-in-Depth strategy would identify threats and risks and assess those\nthreats and risks for impact. The strategy would also map ICS architecture and develop a comprehensive\ninventory of all ICS assets. Having an accurate and well-documented inventory enables an organization to\nperform a realistic risk analysis of system operations, then apply security controls based on asset priority,\nand deploy effective security countermeasures to manage vulnerabilities.

Identify, minimize, and secure all network connections to the ICS.\n\n2. Harden the ICS and supporting systems by disabling unnecessary services, ports, and protocols;\n\nenable available security features; and implement robust configuration management practices.\n\n3. Continually monitor and assess the security of the ICS, networks, and interconnections.\n\n4. Implement a risk-based defense-in-depth approach to securing ICS systems and networks.\n\n5. Manage the human—clearly identify requirements for ICS; establish expectations for perfor­\n\nmance; hold individuals accountable for their performance; establish policies; and provide ICS\nsecurity training for all operators and administrators.\n\n###### 4.3  Security and Risk Standards\n\n There are a number of existing security and risk standards and guidance that organizations can use as a basis for securing and managing ICS. Depending on the critical infrastructure sector, these standards will apply to an organization as required by law or the authoritative governing body for that sector. Others standards and guides can help organizations develop a robust ICS security and risk management program based on industry best practices.\n\n 4.3.1  NERC-CIP\n\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is a not-for-profit international reg­\nulatory authority whose mission is to ensure the reliability of the bulk power system in North America.\nNERC develops and enforces Reliability Standards; annually assesses seasonal and long-term reliability;\nmonitors the bulk power system through system awareness; and educates, trains, and certifies industry\npersonnel. NERC’s area of responsibility spans the continental United States, Canada, and the northern\n[portion of Baja California, Mexico. NERC is the electric reliability organization (ERO) for North Ameri­](http://www.nerc.com/AboutNERC/Pages/default.aspx)\nca, subject to oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and governmental author­\nities in Canada. NERC’s jurisdiction includes users, owners, and operators of the bulk power system.\n\nThe NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards provide a set of requirements and con­\nsiderations for protecting bulk power system assets, but they are also applicable to other industries as best\npractices for protecting ICS.\n\n###### 4.3.2  NIST ICS Framework\n\nNIST released the first version of the “Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecu­\n[rity” on February 12, 2014. The framework, created through collaboration between industry and govern­](http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/)\nment, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote the protection of critical infrastructure.\nThe prioritized, flexible, repeatable, and cost-effective approach of the framework helps owners and\noperators of critical infrastructure to better manage cyber-related risk.\n\n\n-----\n\nganizations can use it alone or in conjunction with other NIST standards, such as its Special Publication\n(SP) series, notably:\n\n - NIST SP 800-37, “Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Sys­\n\ntems, A Security Life Cycle Approach,”\n\n - NIST SP 800-39, “Managing Information Security Risk – Organization, Mission, and Information\n\nSystem View,”\n\n - NIST SP 800-53, “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organiza­\n\ntions,” and\n\n - NIST SP 800-82, “Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security.”\n\n###### 4.3.3  Specific Subsector Guides\n\nMany critical infrastructure subsectors have created guides to use when applying security solutions to\nICS environments. These guides provide requirements and direction for protecting ICS assets that support\nspecific functions within each sector.\n\n###### 4.3.3.1  Electricity Subsector Risk Management Process\n\n[DOE developed the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Risk Management Process (RMP) guideline](http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/Cybersecurity%20Risk%20Management%20Process%20Guideline%20-%20Final%20-%20May%202012.pdf)\nin collaboration with NIST, NERC, and broad industry participation. The RMP is written with the goal of\nenabling organizations—regardless of size or of organizational or governance structure—to apply effec­\ntive and efficient risk management processes and to tailor them to meet their organizational requirements.\nOrganizations can use this guideline to implement a new program within an organization or to build on an\norganization’s existing internal policies, standard guidelines, and procedures.\n\n###### 4.3.3.2  AWWA Process Control System Security Guidance for the Water Sector\n\n[In February 2013, the American Water Works Association (AWWA) Water Utility Council initiated a](http://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/water-and-wastewater-utility-management/cybersecurity-guidance.aspx)\nproject to address the absence of practical, step-by-step guidance for protecting water sector PCSs from\ncyber attacks. The goal of the AWWA guidance is to provide water sector utility owners/operators with\na consistent and repeatable recommended course of action to reduce vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. In\nan effort to provide water utilities with actionable tasks, they developed a Cybersecurity guidance tool\nto present recommended controls to users in a concise, straightforward manner. The AWWA guidance\ntool represent a voluntary, sector-specific approach for adopting the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as\nexpressed by the Water Sector Coordinating Council.\n\n###### 4.3.3.3  Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards\n\nDHS has released a final rule that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for high-risk\n[chemical facilities. This rule establishes risk-based performance standards for the security of our Nation’s](http://www.dhs.gov/risk-chemical-facility-anti-terrorism-standards-cfats)\nchemical facilities. It requires covered chemical facilities to prepare security vulnerability assessments,\nwhich identify facility security vulnerabilities, and to develop and implement site security plans, which\ninclude measures that satisfy the identified risk-based performance standards.\n\n###### 4.3.3.4  TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines\n\n[The Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) developed the Pipeline Security Guidelines with](https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsapipelinesecurityguidelines-2011.pdf)\nthe assistance of industry and government members of the Pipeline Sector and Government Coordinating\nCouncils, industry association representatives, and other interested parties to provide guidance for se­\ncuring natural gas and hazardous liquid transmission pipelines, natural gas distribution pipelines, and to\nliquefied natural gas facility operators. In addition, the guidelines apply to pipeline systems that transport\nmaterials categorized as toxic inhalation hazards (TIH).\n\n\n-----\n\nDHS’s ICS-CERT provides subject-matter expertise, tools, and services to assist organizations associ­\nated with all critical infrastructure sectors in the improvement of the security posture of their ICS assets.\nICS-CERT provides evaluations and assessments at no cost to organizations. Depending on the complexi­\nty of the system, ICS-CERT can combine assessments during a single visit. ICS-CERT is not a regulatory\nagency, and therefore all assessments are considered collaborative exercises toward a common goal—rais­\ning the cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure across the US.\n\n###### 4.4.1  CSET[®]\n\nICS-CERT offers the Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET[®]), a self-assessment software tool\nfor asset owners to conduct cybersecurity assessments. DHS developed the CSET for users to evaluate\ntheir cybersecurity posture based on standards and practices best suited to their sector. CSET maps user\ninput to questions associated with selected cybersecurity standards and best practices. Multiple reporting\noptions are available to meet the user’s facilitated CSET assessments in partnership with various critical\ninfrastructure stakeholders.\n\nThe CSET assessment process serves as an introductory-level baseline assessment within the ICSCERT portfolio, but is not a prerequisite for more in-depth assessments. The CSET is available to asset\nowners as a no cost, downloadable, self-assessment tool that an organization can use on its own without\nthe assistance of ICS-CERT personnel.\n\n[Figure 12 shows the high-level process that CSET assessments follow. To maximize the effectiveness](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Assessments)\nof the CSET evaluation process, the asset owner should include subject matter experts from various dis­\nciplines to conduct the guided discovery-oriented evaluation of the entity’s underlying control processes,\nprocedures, policies, methodologies, and protective and detective security controls. These comprise the\ncybersecurity foundation for ensuring the availability and integrity of the control process.\n\nDetermine\n\nSelect Create Answer Analyze\n\nAssurance\n\nStandards Diagram Questions Results\n\nLevels\n\n###### Figure 12. CSET Assessment High-Level Process.\n\nCSET users answer a series of questions based on user-selected cyber security standards or best\npractice (NIST SP 800-82, NIST SP 800-53, CFATS, NRC, NERCCIP, and so forth) and the tool uses the\nanswers to develop a report that baselines the cybersecurity posture of the target system.\n\nA CSET evaluation usually takes about 1 day. An ICS-CERT subject matter expert will work with\norganizations to teach them how to use the tool and spend the day helping to answer any questions about\nthe assessment and results. Typically, the CSET assessment includes both a key requirements assessment\nand a component assessment. The tool uses integrated network maps to provide a visual representation\nof the current security state of the system, identify the component targets for the assessment, and provide\nguidance on where to place cybersecurity protection mechanisms to provide the most value to the organi­\nzation.\n\n\nAnswer\nQuestions\n\n\nSelect\nStandards\n\n\nCreate\nDiagram\n\n\n-----\n\nA Design Architecture Review (DAR) is an assessment facilitated by ICS-CERT assessment team\npersonnel who work interactively with the user to perform a deep-dive manual assessment and analysis\nof the operational process. The assessment focuses on the underlying ICS network architecture, integra­\ntion of IT and OT teams, vendor support, monitoring, cybersecurity controls, and a review of internal and\nexternal connections utilized within the control systems environment. The DAR focuses heavily on three\nkey areas:\n\n1. ICS Network Architecture,\n\n1. Asset Inventory, and\n\n2. Protective and Detective Security controls.\n\nDAR assessments generally take 2 days to complete (per control system architecture). ICS-CERT can\nconduct DARs independently of or in conjunction with CSET assessments; however, the DAR is more\neffective following a structured CSET assessment. A DAR is a comprehensive evaluation and discovery\nprocess, focusing on Defense-in-Depth strategies associated with an asset owner’s specific control sys­\ntems network. It provides the asset owner with a thorough evaluation of system interdependencies, vul­\nnerabilities, and mitigation options. It examines information related to key ICS external connections and\nincludes an in-depth review of control systems design documents, drawings, and architectures. The DAR\nprocess provides a detailed final report to the user that captures the key discoveries identified by the team\nand provides potential impact and recommended mitigations for each.\n\n###### 4.4.3  Network Architecture Verification and Validation\n\nThe Network Architecture Validation and Verification (NAVV) assessment entails the analysis of\nnetwork traffic (passively captured) occurring within the ICS network. Using a combination of both opensource and commercially available tools, ICS-CERT is able to strategically visualize and perform anal­\nysis on the network traffic and device-to-device communications occurring within various ICS network\nsegments to identify potential unauthorized or suspect communications. Threat data analysis of the traffic\nevaluates for indicators of known unauthorized attacks in the user’s network.\n\nNAVV assessments enable asset owners to:\n\n - Verify the accuracy of ICS network diagrams.\n\n - Identify potentially rogue/misconfigured devices or malicious data communications.\n\n - Analyze data flows to ensure that boundary protection devices work as designed.\n\n - Identify opportunities or areas to improve zoning and perimeter protections.\n\n - Baseline the ICS network (including a protocol hierarchy and organization of network traffic).\n\n - Gain practical knowledge of how to passively monitor and verify the communications occurring with­\n\nin their ICS networks.\n\nThe NAVV provides organizations with a view of network communication occurring within the ICS\nnetwork infrastructure, in addition to those communications sourced from or destined to ICS network\nsegments. ICS-CERT typically provides NAVV reviews as an extension to DARs, although this service is\nalso offered independently.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs ICSs grow in complexity and connect to business and external networks, the number of potential\nsecurity issues and their associated risks grows as well. The wide variety of attack vectors that target\nmultiple resources on control systems can give rise to asynchronous attacks over an extended period of\ntime and could target multiple weaknesses within a control system environment. Organizations cannot\ndepend on a single countermeasure to mitigate all security issues. In order to effectively protect ICSs from\ncyber-based attacks, organizations must apply multiple countermeasures—thus reducing risk using an\naggregate of security mitigation techniques. One should note that Defense-in-Depth measures do not and\ncannot protect all vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an ICS environment. They are applied, primarily, to\nslow down an attacker enough to allow IT and OT personnel to detect and respond to ongoing threats, or\nto make the effort on the attacker’s side so cumbersome that they decide to put their effort toward easier\nprey.\n\n\n-----\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\nOffice of Cybersecurity and Communications\n\n[National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center](https://www.dhs.gov/national-cybersecurity-and-communications-integration-center)\n\n1-888-282-0870\n\n[Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov)\n\n\n-----",
