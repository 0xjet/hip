Two of the\nmen, who were based in Malaysia, were arrested and their extradition to the U.S. has been\nrequested. The other five are based in China and remain at large.\n\nThe attacks were attributed to a China-linked organization dubbed APT41 and involved a\ncombination of intellectual property theft and financially motivated cyber crime. While some\nof our peers monitor APT41 as a single operation, Symantec regards it as two distinct actors:\nGrayfly and Blackfly.\n\n## Grayfly\n\nGrayfly has been particularly active in recent years, mounting high volume espionage attacks\nagainst organizations spread across Asia, Europe, and North America. They are interested in\na wide range of sectors, including food, financial, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing,\ntelecoms, and government. It is known for using the Barlaiy/POISONPLUG and\nCrosswalk/ProxIP (Backdoor.Motnug) malware families in its attacks. Victims are frequently\ncompromised by exploiting public facing web servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn recent attacks, Symantec has seen Grayfly deploy Backdoor.Motnug against targeted\norganizations in conjunction with publicly available Cobalt Strike malware. Backdoor.Motnug\nprovides the attackers with comprehensive remote access to the network and creates proxy\nconnections allowing access to hard-to-reach segments of a target network. In one attack\nagainst a telecoms provider, Grayfly was seen using an internal tool capable of interacting\nwith an SMS database, demonstrating that intelligence gathering was the motive of the\nattack.\n\n[Prosecutors in the U.S. have charged three Chinese men – Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan, and Fu](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1317206/download)\nQiang – with involvement in attacks that involve Grayfly tools and tactics. The trio are based\nin the Chinese city of Chengdu and all hold senior positions in a company called Chengdu\n404. The company describes itself as a network security specialist and claims to employ a\nteam of white hat hackers who can perform penetration testing along with “offensive” and\n“defensive” security operations.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the three men were also involved in attacks against over 100\ndifferent organizations in the U.S., South Korea, Japan, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia,\nVietnam, India, Pakistan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Chile, Indonesia, Singapore, and\nThailand. Jiang was said to have a “working relationship” with the Chinese Ministry of State\nSecurity which would provide him and his associates with a degree of state protection.\n\n## Blackfly\n\nBlackfly has been active since at least 2010 and is known for attacks involving the\nPlugX/Fast (Backdoor.Korplug), Winnti/Pasteboy (Backdoor.Winnti), and Shadowpad\n(Backdoor.Shadowpad) malware families. The group is best known for its attacks on the\ncomputer gaming industry. However, Symantec has also observed attacks on the\nsemiconductor, telecoms, materials manufacturing, pharmaceutical, media and advertising,\nhospitality, natural resources, fintech, and food sectors.\n\nRecent Blackfly activity observed by Symantec saw the group deploy a slightly modified\nversion of the Winnti malware against a telecoms organization in Taiwan. A feature of the\nattack was their use of the names of security vendors in naming files in an attempt to avoid\nraising suspicions. A dropper was signed with an invalid certificate with the subject \"McAfee,\nInc.\" The dropper then delivered several DLLs with file names that referenced Symantec\nsoftware. The attackers had not compromised Symantec software, and were not leveraging it\nin the attack.\n\nIn a separate indictment, prosecutors allege that two Malaysian nationals – Wong Ong Hua\n[and Ling Yang Ching – were involved in attacks that involved Blackfly tools and tactics.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1317211/download)\nWong is the founder and CEO of a company called Sea Gamer Mall, while Ling is its chief\nproduct officer and a shareholder. The duo are alleged to have collaborated with other\nattackers to mount a string of attacks against computer game companies in order to obtain\nin-game digital items, such as currencies, and then selling them for profit.\n\n\n-----",
