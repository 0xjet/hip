Predictions for 2017](https://securelist.com/kaspersky-security-bulletin-predictions-for-2017/76660/)_\n\n_Kaspersky Security Bulletin 2015. Evolution of cyber_\n\n_threats in the corporate sector_\n\n## Summary\n\nKaspersky Lab has been tracking a series of attacks utilizing unknown malware since early 2017. The\n\nattacks appear to be geopolitically motivated and target high profile organizations. The objective of\n\nthe attacks is clearly espionage – they involve gaining access to top legislative, executive and judicial\n\nbodies around the world.\n\n1. The attackers have targeted a large number of organizations globally since early 2017, with the\n\nmain focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), especially Palestine. High-profile\n\norganizations have also been targeted in other regions. The number of attacks has decreased\n\nsince the beginning of 2018.\n\n2. The attacks were initially discovered while investigating a phishing attack that targeted political\n\nfigures in the MENA region. At first the attacks looked to be the work of the low-sophistication\n\n[Gaza Cybergang (decoys, file names), but further analysis painted a very different picture.](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-updated-2017-activity/82765/)\n\n3. Targets include high-profile entities such as parliaments, senates, top state offices and officials,\n\npolitical science scholars, military and intelligence agencies, ministries, media outlets, research\n\ncenters, election commissions, Olympic organizations, large trading companies, and other\n\nunknown entities.\n\n4. The malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers, enabling\n\nthem to execute any scripts/commands and receive the result via HTTP requests.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Victimology and Statistics\n\nBased on our findings, we believe the attackers represent a previously unknown geopolitically\n\nmotivated threat actor. The campaign started in 2017, with the attackers doing just enough to\n\nachieve their goals. They most likely have access to additional tools when needed and appear to have\n\naccess to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide,\n\nespecially of vulnerable and non-trained staff. The victim systems range from personal desktop or\n\nlaptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar. The nature of the targeted\n\nministries varied, including those responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance\n\nand so on.\n\nVictims have been spotted in the Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia,\n\nDjibouti, Qatar, Lebanon, Chile, Somalia, Iraq, Morocco, Syria, India, Iran, Canada, the USA, the UK,\n\nGermany, Israel, Afghanistan, Serbia, Russia, Oman, Kuwait, South Korea and Denmark.\n\nNum be r o f vict im\nVict im o rganiz at io n t ype\n\no rganiz at io ns\n\nUnknown 91\n\nSenates/Parliaments 7\n\nPrime Ministerial Offices 3\n\nMilitary/Intelligence Agencies 5\n\n\nOther Gov./Ministerial/Diplomatic\n\n20\nOffices\n\nFinancial/Banking Institutions 5\n\nMedia Outlets 2\n\nOlympic/Sports Bodies 2\n\nR h C t /S h l 2\n\n\n-----\n\nThe number of victims/victim organizations probably doesn’t represent the full scope of the attacks\n\n– only a portion.\n\n## Attack description and attribution\n\nOperation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle East\n\nregion. The attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another attack group in\n\nthe region. They have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the\n\ni f i f di h i d d l Th i h l d\n\n\n-----\n\nwas carried out before the attacks (physical and/or digital).\n\nWith deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors, attribution is a hard and\n\ncomplicated task that requires solid evidence, especially in complex regions such as the Middle East.\n\nSee the following for more information and examples of false flags being used in cyberattacks:\n\n[Wave your false flags! …or the Nightmares and Nuances of a Self-Aware Attribution Space](https://securelist.com/wave-your-false-flags/76273/)\n\n[OlympicDestroyer is here to trick the industry](https://securelist.com/olympicdestroyer-is-here-to-trick-the-industry/84295/)\n\n## Malware description\n\nThe malware was first seen packed with VMProtect; when unpacked the sample didn’t show any\n\nsimilarities with previously known malware. All the strings and settings were encrypted and\n\nobfuscated. Functionality was identified that enables HTTP communication with the C&C server and\n\ninvokes “processcreate” based on parameters received as a response.\n\nThe configuration and strings are encrypted using 3DES and Base64 encoding. Data sent to the C&C\n\nserver is also encrypted using 3DES and Base64. Different keys are used for local and network\n\nencryption.\n\nThe malware starts communicating with the C&C server by sending basic information about the\n\ninfected machine. The C&C server then replies with the encrypted serialized configuration.\n\nThe malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers, enabling them\n\nto execute scripts/commands and receive the results via HTTP requests.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Sample of the C&C response with encrypted commands and configurations_\n\n## Examples of attack decoys\n\n_Translation: Contacts list of media personnel_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Translation: Relations between UAE and Jordan, and the impact caused by the non-boycott_\n\n_of Qatar_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Translation: Military retirement statement 2017 June_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Translation: The new Hamas structure for Gaza strip 2017_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Translation: Clarification report (on Gaza employee salaries)_\n\n## What should high-profile organizations do?\n\nHigh-profile organizations should have elevated levels of cybersecurity. Attacks against them are\n\ninevitable and are unlikely to ever cease. These organizations need to pay particular attention to their\n\nsecurity, implementing additional measures to ensure they are well protected. Anti-targeted attack\n\nsolutions, threat intelligence capabilities and data flows, default-deny application lockdown, endpoint\n\ndetection and response, data leak and insider threat prevention, and even isolated/air-gapped\n\nnetworks should form the basis of any strategy for protecting organizations in the current threat\n\nlandscape.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Additional information\n\nFor more information about the attacks and the indicators of compromise, please contact:\n\n[intelreports@kaspersky.com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n[Alternatively, please visit: https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/apt-intelligence-reporting](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/apt-intelligence-reporting)\n\nTo find more information about cybersecurity awareness training for enterprise or government staff,\n\n[go to Kaspersky Security Awareness.](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/cybersecurity-awareness)\n\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/all?tag=538) [CYBER ESPIONAGE](https://securelist.com/all?tag=185) [TARGETED ATTACK](https://securelist.com/all?tag=954)\n\n### Related Posts\n\n\nShare post on:\n\n####   \n\n\n###### Your new friend, KLara Masha and these Bears\n\n\n###### Your new friend, KLara\n\n\n###### Masha and these Bears\n\n\n-----\n\nName *\n\nEmail *\n\nNotify me when new comments are added.\n\n\nSUBMIT\n\n\n-----\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nPlease upgrade to a supported browser\nto get a reCAPTCHA challenge.\n\nAlternatively if you think you are getting\nthis page in error, please check your\ninternet connection and reload.\n\nWhy is this happening to me?\n\n[© 2018 AO Kaspersky Lab.
