In most cases, the level of\ncomplexity is medium. The adversaries design the image and place it in Docker Hub,\nusing a misleading name, for example, Nginx.\n\n###### Vanilla image — malicious command\n\nThis type of attack uses a vanilla, or innocuous-looking image such as Alpine or\nUbuntu, not designed to deliver a payload or run malicious code. The payload is\ndelivered and initiated at a later stage by the entry-point command that downloads\nmalicious components during runtime. The adversaries use the latest version of an\nofficial and popular vanilla image for instance, alpine: latest.\n\nUsing an official and seemingly benign image increases the chances of passing a\nsecurity scan by most security tools, since it should not have any vulnerabilities or\nmalicious components. Some organizations permit the use of images only from a\npredetermined, explicitly allowed list. Using an official, popular image increases the\nchances that the attack will be executed as planned since these images are likely to\nbe pre-approved for use.\n\n###### Building directly on hosts\n\nIn the second half of 2020, we saw a new type of attack — building the image directly\non the target host. The adversaries used a Docker SDK for Python package to send\ncommands to a misconfigured Docker API. The attack sequence started by sending\n\n\n-----\n\nand avoid detection or blocking by security tools.\n\n**Image types used to conceal the campaigns**\n\n5.5%\n\n0.01%​​\n\nLegitimate image name ​\n\n94.5%​​\n\nBuild on host\n\nVanilla images ​​\n\n\nd **[Blog](https://blog.aquasec.com/malicious-container-image-docker-container-host)**\nt.

Under the cloud\nshared responsibilty model, customers should ensure that access to EC2 metadata\nshould follow the principle of least privilege access. By default, EC2 metadata has no\npermissions\n\n###### • [Mining pools: ][A DNS lookup (for example, 35.163.175.186 and 185.10.68.220) is used ]\nto retrieve the IP address that is registered under the searched domain. DNS lookup\nrequests showed that most retrieved IP addresses were reported as malicious C2\nservers. The attackers are using various techniques such as tunneling to the local\nhost (ngrok.io), reverse proxy (fastly), and public code repositories\n(GitHub, Bitbucket)\n\n###### Scanners and attackers\n\nIt takes 5 hours, on average, for the adversaries’ bots to scan a new honeypot. The\nfastest scan occurred after a few minutes, while the longest gap was 24 hours. The\nmedian was only 56 minutes, meaning that in 50% of the cases, the adversaries\nfound the honeypot in less than one hour. These findings emphasize the immense\nsignificance of detecting and remediating cloud misconfigurations promptly or\npreventing them from occurring before deployment. Practitioners need to constantly\nbe aware that the slightest misconfiguration, even for a brief moment, might expose\ntheir containers and Kubernetes clusters to a threat of cyberattack.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Initial Access Exploit Public-Facing Application|Execution Container Service (New)|Persistence Host mount (new) -

For instance, the same IPs are used to disseminate and\ncommunicate with Kinsing malware. The attackers acquired these IPs to enable this\nattack. These are probably a subset of the botnet linked to the\nKinsing malware campaign.\n\nSimilarly, TeamTNT have been using the domains teamtnt[.]red, kaiserfranz[.]cc and\nborg[.]wtf as CnC server, DNS and IRC server. They all resolve to the same IP address\n45[.]9[.]148[.]108.\n\n###### Compromise infrastructure\n\nPreviously, we reported that attackers had been using compromised websites to store\nmalicious files. These malicious files are downloaded during container runtime. We\ncontinue to see this use of compromised websites to store malicious files such\nas scripts.\n\n###### Obtain capabilities\n\nAs written on MITRE’s site, adversaries might buy or steal capabilities that can be\nused during targeting before compromising a victim. Rather than develop their\ncapabilities in-house, adversaries can purchase, freely download, or steal them. We\nhave seen attackers using open-source tools, and specifically offensive security tools,\nto achieve their goals.\n\n###### Initial Access\n\n Exploit public-facing application\n\nThese attacks mostly exploit a\nmisconfigured Docker API port exposed **[Blog](https://blog.aquasec.com/malicious-container-image-docker-container-host)**\nto the internet and allow all incoming [Threat Alert: Attackers building](https://blog.aquasec.com/malicious-container-image-docker-container-hosthttp://)\ntraffic access.

It indicates that attackers are not just looking for port 2375 (unencrypted Docker\nAPI) and other ports related to cloud native services. In addition to this research,\n[we have also seen new initial accesses and new attack variants that also threaten](https://blog.aquasec.com/container-attacks-on-redis-servers)\n[Kubernetes clusters.](https://blog.aquasec.com/kubernetes-vulnerability-security-threat)\n\nAdversaries are using more sophisticated techniques to increase the chances of a\nsuccessful attack with a bigger impact. Attackers are:\n### 2\n\n###### • [Extending their arsenal with new and advanced techniques ]\n • [Hiding their attacks more effectively using advanced techniques, such as ]\nexecuting malware straight from memory, packing the payload, or\nusing rootkits\n\n###### • [Conducting privilege escalation and escaping from the container to the host]\n • [Increasing their persistence on the compromised hosts by using rootkits]\n • [Increasing use of offensive security tools as part of the attack kill chain ]\n • [Hiding a more sinister impact. While much focus has been given to ]\ncryptocurrency mining attacks, which might be perceived as more of a\nnuisance than a severe threat, these attacks can mask more sinister objectives.\nIn some of the attacks we observed, adversaries tried to leave backdoors\non the host by dropping dedicated malware, or by creating new users with\nroot privileges and SSH keys for remote access. We’ve also seen adversaries\nattempt to collect credentials and sensitive data. Once collected, the attackers\ncould then use exfiltration techniques to steal sensitive data. Such activities\npose serious threats to organizations\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacking through supply chain. A massive campaign was mounted to target the\n\n### 3 auto-build process of code repositories, registries, and CI service providers may\n\nreveal troubling future threats. Targeting the build process during CI/CD flow is a soft\nbelly since there are few detection, prevention, and security tools. We have also seen\nattacks through Docker Hub and GitHub, using typo-squatting to trick developers\ninto downloading malicious container images or code packages\n\n### 4   Botnets are swiftly finding and infecting new hosts as they become vulnerable.• [Attackers are using dedicated botnets that scan the internet, looking to detect ]\n\ncloud misconfigurations and disseminate malicious payload, usually by running\na malicious container image\n\n###### • [Once a host is infected, a worm is executed on newly infected host, boosting ]\nthe dissemination of the malicious payload to other hosts\n\n###### • [They continually scan the net, seeking misconfigured Docker daemons, ]\nDocker Swarm daemons, Kubernetes clusters and cloud backup ports. Internal\nresearch revealed that some botnets could detect and attack a misconfigured\nDocker daemon five hours on average after the port becomes visible. They are\nusing powerful tools, such as masscan, that allow them to more quickly scan\nbigger ranges\n\nThe volume of attacks against container environments is increasing, demonstrating\nthat organized and well-funded teams are behind them\n\n### 5\n\nAttackers are adapting their techniques much faster, updating them more\nfrequently, and creating a more rapid cat-and-mouse game\n\n### 6\n\n\n-----\n\n###### List of reports\n\n**Attack name** **Attack description** **Impact** **Duration** **Volume** **Images used** **Perpetrator**\n\nThe attacker opened shell from\n**Alpine -
