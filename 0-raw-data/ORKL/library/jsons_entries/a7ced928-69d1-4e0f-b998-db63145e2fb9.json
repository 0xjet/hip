During our investigation, we found a small number\nof computers, including some in our Mac business unit, that were infected by malicious\nsoftware using techniques similar to those documented by other organizations. We have no\nevidence of customer data being affected and our investigation is ongoing.\n\nThis type of cyberattack is no surprise to Microsoft and other companies that must grapple\n[with determined and persistent adversaries (see our prior analysis of emerging threat](http://www.microsoft.com/security/sir/default.aspx)\ntrends). We continually re-evaluate our security posture and deploy additional people,\nprocesses, and technologies as necessary to help prevent future unauthorized access to our\nnetworks.\n\nMatt Thomlinson\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nTrustworthy Computing Security\n\n\n-----",
