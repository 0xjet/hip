The defendants were each\nleaders, contractors, associates, hackers-for-hire or affiliates of the Mabna Institute, an Iranbased company that, since at least 2013, conducted a coordinated campaign of cyber\nintrusions into computer systems belonging to 144 U.S. universities, 176 universities across\n21 foreign countries, 47 domestic and foreign private sector companies, the U.S. Department\nof Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of\nIndiana, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children’s Fund. Through the\ndefendants’ activities, the Mabna Institute stole more than 31 terabytes of academic data and\nintellectual property from universities, and email accounts of employees at private sector\n\n\n-----\n\ncompanies, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. The defendants\nconducted many of these intrusions on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s (Iran) Islamic\nRevolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), one of several entities within the government of Iran\nresponsible for gathering intelligence, as well as other Iranian government and university\nclients. In addition to these criminal charges, today the Department of the Treasury’s Office\nof Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated the Mabna Institute and the nine defendants\nfor sanctions for the malicious cyber-enabled activity outlined in the Indictment.\n\nThe charges were announced by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein; Assistant\nAttorney General for National Security John C. Demers; U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman\nfor the Southern District of New York; FBI Director Christopher A. Wray; Assistant Director in\nCharge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI’s New York Field Division; and Treasury Under\nSecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker.\n\n“These nine Iranian nationals allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data\nfrom more than 140 American universities, 30 American companies, five American\ngovernment agencies, and also more than 176 universities in 21 foreign countries,” said\nDeputy Attorney General Rosenstein. “For many of these intrusions, the defendants acted at\nthe behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard\nCorps. The Department of Justice will aggressively investigate and prosecute hostile actors\nwho attempt to profit from America’s ideas by infiltrating our computer systems and stealing\nintellectual property. This case is important because it will disrupt the defendants’ hacking\noperations and deter similar crimes.”\n\n“Today, in one of the largest state-sponsored hacking campaigns ever prosecuted by the\nDepartment of Justice, we have unmasked criminals who normally hide behind the ones and\nzeros of computer code,” said U.S. Attorney Berman. “As alleged, this massive and brazen\ncyber-assault on the computer systems of hundreds of universities in 22 countries and\ndozens of private sector companies and governmental organizations was conducted on\nbehalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard. The hackers targeted innovations and\nintellectual property from our country’s greatest minds. These defendants are now fugitives\nfrom American justice, no longer free to travel outside Iran without risk of arrest. The only\nway they will see the outside world is through their computer screens, but stripped of their\ngreatest asset – anonymity.”\n\n“This investigation involved a complex threat in a dynamic landscape, but today’s\nannouncement highlights the commitment of the FBI and our partners to vigorously pursue\nthose that threaten U.S. property and security,” said Director Wray. “Today, not only are we\npublicly identifying the foreign hackers who committed these malicious cyber intrusions, but\nwe are also sending a powerful message to their backers, the Government of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran: your acts do not go unnoticed. We will protect our innovation, ideas and\ninformation, and we will use every tool in our toolbox to expose those who commit these\ncyber crimes. Our memory is long; we will hold them accountable under the law, no matter\nwhere they attempt to hide ”\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the Indictment unsealed today in Manhattan federal\ncourt:\n\nBackground on the Mabna Institute\n\nGholamreza Rafatnejad and Ehsan Mohammadi, the defendants, founded the Mabna\nInstitute in approximately 2013 to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research\norganizations in stealing access to non-Iranian scientific resources. In furtherance of its\nmission, the Mabna Institute employed, contracted, and affiliated itself with hackers-for-hire\nand other contract personnel to conduct cyber intrusions to steal academic data, intellectual\nproperty, email inboxes and other proprietary data, including Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid\nKarima, Mostafa Sadeghi, Seyed Ali Mirkarimi, Mohammed Reza Sabahi, Roozbeh Sabahi,\nAbuzar Gohari Moqadam, and Sajjad Tahmasebi. The Mabna Institute contracted with both\nIranian governmental and private entities to conduct hacking activities on their behalf, and\nspecifically conducted the university spearphishing campaign on behalf of the IRGC. The\nMabna Institute is located at Tehran, Sheikh Bahaii Shomali, Koucheh Dawazdeh Metri\nSevom, Plak 14, Vahed 2, Code Posti 1995873351.\n\nUniversity Hacking Campaign\n\nThe Mabna Institute, through the activities of the defendants, targeted more than 100,000\naccounts of professors around the world. They successfully compromised approximately\n8,000 professor email accounts across 144 U.S.-based universities, and 176 universities\nlocated in foreign countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany,\nIreland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea,\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The campaign started in\napproximately 2013, continued through at least December 2017, and broadly targeted all\ntypes of academic data and intellectual property from the systems of compromised\nuniversities. Through the course of the conspiracy, U.S.-based universities spent more than\napproximately $3.4 billion to procure and access such data and intellectual property.\n\nThe members of the conspiracy used stolen account credentials to obtain unauthorized\naccess to victim professor accounts, which they used to steal research, and other academic\ndata and documents, including, among other things, academic journals, theses,\ndissertations, and electronic books. The defendants targeted data across all fields of\nresearch and academic disciplines, including science and technology, engineering, social\nsciences, medical, and other professional fields. The defendants stole at least approximately\n31.5 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property, which they exfiltrated to servers\noutside the United States that were under the control of members of the conspiracy.\n\nIn addition to stealing academic data and login credentials for the benefit of the Government\nof Iran, the defendants also sold the stolen data through two websites, Megapaper.ir\n(Megapaper) and Gigapaper.ir (Gigapaper). Megapaper was operated by Falinoos\nCompany, a company controlled by Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid Karima, the defendant, and\n\n\n-----\n\nGigapaper was affiliated with Karima. Megapaper sold stolen academic resources to\ncustomers within Iran, including Iran-based public universities and institutions, and\nGigapaper sold a service to customers within Iran whereby purchasing customers could use\ncompromised university professor accounts to directly access the online library systems of\nparticular U.S.-based and foreign universities.\n\nAccompanying Mitigation Efforts\n\nPrior to the unsealing of the Indictment, the FBI provided foreign law enforcement partners\nwith detailed information regarding victims within their jurisdictions, so that victims in foreign\ncountries could be notified and foreign partners could assist in remediation efforts.\n\nAlso, in connection with the unsealing of the Indictment, today the FBI provided private\nsector partners detailed information regarding the vulnerabilities targeted and the intrusion\nvectors used by the Mabna Institute in their campaign against private sector companies.\nThis information will assist the public in its network defense and mitigation efforts.\n\n-        *        *\n\nRafatnejad, Mohammadi, Karima, Sadeghi, Mirkarimi, Sabahi, Sabahi, Moqadam and\nTahmasebi was each is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions,\nwhich carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit\nwire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; two counts of\nunauthorized access of a computer, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years\nin prison; two counts of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in\nprison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of\ntwo years in prison. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by\nCongress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the\ndefendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nMr. Rosenstein and Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, the\nassistance of the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA), and the support of the\nOFAC. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy T. Howard, Jonathan Cohen and Richard Cooper\nare in charge of the prosecution, with assistance provided by Trial Attorneys Heather Alpino\nand Jason McCullough of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export\nControl Section.\n\nThe charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are\npresumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nFor the U.S. Department of Treasury’s press release announcing corresponding sanctions\nclick [here.](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0332)\n\n\n-----",
