This means that while Sphinx infection campaigns continue and the malware\ncan infect new machines, it remains idle and lacks attack instructions to target specific banks\nand banking services.\n\nThe only instruction that repeats in all Sphinx configuration is to inject a victim’s “bot ID” into\nevery page he or she visits. In essence, this is a webinjection attack: Inject into http*://*,\ncovering any HTTP and HTTPS webpage the victim browses to.\n\n[Read the white paper: Shifting the balance of power with cognitive fraud prevention](https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=mrs-form-9451&S_PKG=ov54550)\n\n## What’s Cooking?\n\nThis phase of empty Sphinx configuration files started in March 2017 and increased over the\npast few months to include all Sphinx samples. This suggests that Sphinx is presently\noperated by one group, not multiple actors, despite the fact that it was commercially sold in\nthe underground when it was launched in 2015. What are Sphinx’s operators cooking up?\n\n[In 2017, the malware was targeting banks in a number of countries, mostly focusing on](https://securityintelligence.com/around-the-world-with-zeus-sphinx-from-canada-to-australia-and-back/)\nAustralia, the U.S. and Canada. Throughout that time, and to date, Sphinx’s operators have\nlaunched different infection campaigns to spread the malware to more users.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to X-Force research, one of the most interesting phases came in late January\n[2017, when Sphinx was being delivered by a well-known spam source called Moskalvzapoe.](https://www.scmagazine.com/trojan-distribution-methods-highlight-need-for-info-sharing-in-financial-services-industry/article/530162/)\n[This network was one of the more prominent distributors of the Neverquest Trojan, serving](https://securityintelligence.com/neverquest-gang-takes-leave-is-it-the-end-of-the-quest/)\nspam for cybercriminal customers.\n\nA notable change came in the week of Jan. 19 to Jan. 24, 2017, when Neverquest delivery\nvia Moskalvzapoe suddenly halted. After that week, Moskalvzapoe got right back into serving\nbanking Trojans, only this time it was spreading Zeus Sphinx, dropping it via Moskalvzapoe’s\n[DELoader, also known as Terdot.](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/HancitorPony+malspam/22053/)\n\nNeverquest has since completely died down, dropping from the second most prevalent\nfinancial malware families into oblivion. Zeus Sphinx, on the other hand, has been climbing\nup the chart ever since, placing fifth in June, right under seasoned organized cybercrime\ngangs such as Gozi, Ramnit and Dridex, per X-Force data.\n\n_Figure 1: Top most prevalent financial malware families (Source: IBM X-Force, June 2017_\n_YTD)_\n\n[Did the Neverquest gang take over Sphinx after the arrest of one of its members? What is](https://thehackernews.com/2017/01/neverquest-fbi-hacker.html)\nthe purpose of injecting a bot ID into each page visited by infected users? Are the Sphinx\noperators planning to set up the botnet for monetization, similar to how Neverquest used to\nrent botnet sections to the cybercrime elite?\n\nThese questions will likely remain unanswered until the next change takes place. And while\nthe botnet continues to amass new infections, at least banking customers are getting a break\nfor the time being.\n\nAt this time, Sphinx does not have defined targets, but X-Force data revealed that recent\ncampaigns have affected users in North America, the U.K. and Australia. It is possible that\nSphinx’s operators are preparing new targets, sectioning the botnet or partnering with other\ngroups, and will go back to targeting the banking sector in the coming weeks.\n\n## About Sphinx\n\nZeus Sphinx [originally emerged in 2015, when it was up for sale in the Russian-speaking](https://www.securityweek.com/new-zeus-variant-sphinx-offered-sale)\nunderground by a vendor who apparently picked up the Zeus v2 source code and\ncommercialized it. The first Sphinx attacks were configured to target PayPal, banks in the\nU.K. and a bank in Poland using elaborate webinjections to trick victims into authorizing\nfraudulent transactions.\n\nThe malware, which was most likely operated by different actors, started popping up in other\ngeographies, most notably Brazil and Colombia, in the summer of 2016. At the time, Sphinx\n[was adapted to the Brazilian financial sector with more than just local targets, also adding](https://securityintelligence.com/brazil-cant-catch-a-break-after-panda-comes-the-sphinx/)\n\n\n-----\n\nBoleto payment manipulation to the mix. Boleto payments are very popular in Brazil — they\nare similar to the money order concept in the U.S. — and Sphinx featured a module that\nautomatically rerouted these payments to its operators.\n\nX-Force data revealed that by January 2017, the malware started targeting banks in Canada\nand Australia, increasing its activity in the surrounding areas, particularly New Zealand and\nthe U.S. In March, Sphinx saw all URL targets removed from some configurations, eventually\naffecting all Sphinx configurations fetched by infected bots in the second quarter of 2017.\n\n## Sample IoCs\n\nBelow are sample indicators of compromise (IoCs) used in this report:\n\nSphinx dropper MD5: 03C6126B88F9BB51F80C5C370CE233CD\nSphinx sample MD5: 070134AAAF7E64DF29C2D94F8CF94BF9\nSphinx empty configuration MD5: 0235990b83a976fd0aed8202a527b65c\n\n[Read the white paper: Prevent phishing success with cognitive fraud detection](https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=urx-13452&S_PKG=ov57260)\n\n[Limor Kessem](https://securityintelligence.com/author/limor-kessem/)\nExecutive Security Advisor, IBM\n\nLimor Kessem is an Executive Security Advisor at IBM Security.
