Systems infected with this piece of malware are encrypted and a\nmessage, typically inside an HTML or TXT file, is dropped with the ransom details.\n\nThe WastedLocker ransomware has been a hot topic in 2020, with several organizations\nseeing their data damaged and encrypted by criminals. Ransomware attacks are a big threat\nto companies: their data is encrypted and the ransom price does not guarantee that criminals\nwill return what they stole.\n\nThe tech giant Garmin is an example of an organization that was affected by the\nWastedLocker threat, back in June of 2020.\n\n**_Figure 1: Message from Garmin confirming the outage as a result of a ransomware attack_**\n_(WastedLocker)._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Garmin Connect service was down, but the cyberattack also caused damage to\ntechnical services and in the support of their navigation applications. As a mitigation activity,\nall the employees were asked to shut down any computer that had access to their systems.\nIn the Garmin incident, criminals requested $10 million for the release of the stolen data.\n\n## How WastedLocker works\n\nWastedLocker is ransomware operated by a criminal group known as the Evil Corp gang —\nthe same organization associated with Dridex and BitPaymer. This malware is very different\nfrom BitPaymer, however. They only share the characteristic of adding specific modules for\ndifferent scopes and destinations.\n\nThe attacks carried out using WastedLocker are highly targeted. It is suspected that during a\nfirst penetration attempt, an assessment of active defenses is made and the next attempt is\nspecifically designed to bypass active security software and other perimeter protections.\nFigure 2, from [PaloAlto, is a high-level diagram of how this threat is proliferated through the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wastedlocker/)\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: WastedLocker killchain._**\n\nAccording to Figure 2, the most common path used by criminals are ZIP files — the decoy\nfile — containing SocGholish JavaScript framework loader components that profile the victim\nsystem and use PowerShell to ultimately deploy Cobalt Strike payloads.\n\nWhen the Cobalt Strike payload is installed on the victim’s side, it is used to perform a lateral\nmovement from the victim’s machine through the network. With this approach in place,\ncriminals can identify additional systems and deploy new payloads enlarging the initial\nfootprint.\n\nThe group behind this malware has also been observed using legitimate Windows utilities\n(LOL Bins) such as Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and PsExec.\n\n\n-----\n\n[As observed on other groups and ransomware such as Netwalker and Ragnar_Locker,](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/netwalker-malware-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-how-to-prevent-it-malware-spotlight/)\nhigh-value targets are particularly affected by criminals. These include high-use and highvisibility internal systems and systems that contain backups — in order to prevent easy data\nrestoration.\n\nWhen the target system is affected, the damaged files are renamed during the encryption\nprocess and include an abbreviation of the name of the target organization with the “wasted”\nstring at the end (e.g., GARMINWASTED).\n\n**_Figure 3: Sample of damage data from Garmin._**\n\nFor each encrypted file, an additional file is dropped containing the ransomware note. The\nransom note has the same name as the file associated with the addition of “_info”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: Ransom note file — WastedLocker ransomware._**\n\nRedemption requests are exorbitant, ranging from $500,000 to more than $10 million in\nBitcoin.\n\nDuring the malicious process, the malware tries to delete Volume Shadow copies with basic\nVSSADMIN commands:\n```\nvssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet\n\n```\nFor now, victims’ sensitive data is not shared online, as is in the case of other malware\nfamilies. However, preventive measures are needed to contain this threat.\n\n## How to protect against WastedLocker attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware attacks are a trend in this digital era. The general recommendations for\nguarding against them are fairly standard:\n\nKeep software up to date, especially the operating systems and AV engines.\nMany malware types exploit public vulnerabilities\nAdd a backup solution in two forms: offline and online\nMaintain the email over alert: Many different types of attacks arrive via email and\na simple spam folder could provide protection against ransomware\nUse a VPN connection to protect the infrastructure, namely remote access to\nRDP services\nUse monitoring security solutions with anti-ransomware technologies\nAnd finally, but not least, promote employees’ training in the basics of\ncybersecurity. Notice that several threats start via social engineering attacks\nthrough email\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWastedLocker is one of the highly-aggressive ransomware families in operation in 2020. This\nransomware follows the steps of other malware beasts such as\nREvil, **[Netwalker, and](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/netwalker-malware-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-how-to-prevent-it-malware-spotlight/)** **[Ragnar Locker, and prevention is absolutely critical in this field.](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/ragnar-locker-malware-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-how-to-prevent-it-malware-spotlight/)**\n\nDetecting and stopping criminals before they gain traction in some way is essential to protect\nassets and sensitive data. This last point will be true if the group behind WastedLocker\ndecides to leak de victim’s data.\n\n**The article was initially published by Pedro Tavares on** **[resources.infosecinstitute.com.](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/wastedlocker-malware-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-how-to-prevent-it-malware-spotlight/)**\n\n**All rights reserved ®** **[infosecinstitute.com](http://infosecinstitute.com/)**\n\n[Pedro Tavares](https://seguranca-informatica.pt/author/pipocaz/)\n**[Pedro Tavares is a professional in the field of information security working as an Ethical](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sirpedrotavares/)**\nHacker/Pentester, Malware Researcher and also a Security Evangelist.
