The bi-weekly Ransomware Roundup\nreport provides brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape along with the Fortinet\nsolutions that protect against those variants.\n\nThis latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Inlock ransomware and a new\nvariant of the Xorist ransomware that appears to target Cuba.\n\n**Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows**\n\n**Impacted parties: Microsoft Windows Users**\n\n**Impact: Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryption**\n\n**Severity level: High**\n\n## Inlock Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nInlock is a typical ransomware that encrypts files on a compromised machine and demands\nransom from a victim in exchange for recovering the affected files.\n\nFiles encrypted by this latest variant have a “.inlock” file extension. It also leaves a ransom\nnote titled READ_IT.txt, which contains a ransom message in Spanish.\n\nFigure 1. Ransom message dropped by Inlock ransomware\n\nThe ransom message translated into English reads:\n\n_iiYOUR COMPUTER HAS BEEN ENCRYPTED!!! We are very sorry, but you have been the_\n_target of a cyber attack. All your personal data has been encrypted. Please contact me to_\n_negotiate the ransom. Once I receive the payment, I will send you the decryption tool to_\n_decrypt all the files. I hope you have nothing of great value ;)_\n\n_Do not lose the following code or you will never be able to recover your data again:_\n\nIt also changes the desktop wallpaper.\n\nFigure 2. Desktop Wallpaper replaced by Inlock ransomware\n\nAn apparent design failure in the Inlock ransomware is that it does not provide any contact\ninformation so victims can reach out to the attacker about file decryption. The ransomware\nalso deletes volume shadow copies. With no attacker contact information available, victims\ncannot recover their encrypted files.\n\n## New Variant of Xorist Ransomware\n\nFortiGuard Labs also recently came across a new variant of the Xorist ransomware. The\nXorist ransomware family has been in the wild for at least five years, with some reports\nsuggesting its lifespan has been closer to a decade.\n\nWhile we do not know precisely how this new Xorist ransomware variant is distributed to\nvictims, there are a few clues. For example, the ransomware’s executable file is named “Ley\ndel Presidente y Vicepresidente de la República de Cuba.pdf.exe,” which translates to “Law\nof the President and Vice President of the Republic of Cuba.pdf.exe.” Another clue is that\nrelevant samples were primarily submitted to VirusTotal on October 31st from Cuba.\n\nCoincidentally, a benign PDF file, “Ley del Presidente y Vicepresidente de la República de\nCuba.pdf,” was submitted to VirusTotal on the same day. This PDF is labeled as the “Official\nGazette of the Republic of Cuba” on the National Assembly of People's Power held in late\n2020. Its parent file is a self-extracting .rar file that contains the PDF file but is also designed\n\n\n-----\n\nto launch a missing You Are Hacked.exe application, which is the name of the file being\ndropped by samples of this Xorist ransomware variant. We believe that the missing “You Are\nHacked.exe” application was removed by the VirusTotal uploader prior to the file submission.\n\nThis information leads us to believe that the attacker prepared two types of files to distribute\nthe Xorist variant: a fake PDF file that attempts to fool victims into thinking they’ve opened a\nlegitimate file issued by the Cuban government and another fake PDF file that is actually a\nmalicious executable.\n\nFigure 3. Benign PDF file included in “Ley del Presidente y Vicepresidente de la República\nde Cuba.pdf.exe”\n\nThe Xorist ransomware variant leaves a ransom note in Spanish.\n\nFigure 4. Ransom message dropped by the Xorist ransomware variant\n\nThe ransom message translated into English reads:\n\n_ATTENTION!_\n\n_ALL YOUR FILES ARE ENCRYPTED! To restore your files and access them, please send_\n_$100 in Bitcoin to this QR code._\n\n_IF YOU DO NOT PAY WITHIN 48 HOURS ALL YOUR FILES WILL BE DELETED_\n_IRREVERSIBLY YOU HAVE 5 ATTEMPTS TO ENTER YOUR CORRECT CODE._\n\nThe ransom demand is $100 worth of Bitcoin, which is considered cheap for Enterprises.\n\nThese clues are enough for us to conclude that this Xorist ransomware variant was likely\ndesigned to target consumers in Cuba.\n\nThe ransomware also replaces the desktop wallpaper with a ransom message. It includes a\nQR code with the attacker’s Bitcoin wallet address. As of this writing, this wallet has not\nrecorded a single transaction.\n\nFigure 5.

When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce\ntelecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere.\n[Cloud-based security solutions, such as SASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/sase?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=sase)\nendpoint security, such as [EDR (endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt](https://www.fortinet.com/products/endpoint-security/fortiedr.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiedr)\n\n\n-----\n\n[malware mid-attack; and Zero Trust Access and network segmentation strategies that restrict](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/network-access.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=zero-trust-network-access)\naccess to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated\nto minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack.\n\n[As part of the industry's leading fully integrated Security Fabric, delivering native synergy and](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/security-fabric.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=security+fabric)\nautomation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of\ntechnology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our\nglobal FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts.\n\n## Best Practices include Not Paying a Ransom\n\n[Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, the FBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware)\npaying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered.\nAccording to a U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\nadvisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional\norganizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit\nactivities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by\n[ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaint page where victims can submit samples](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Ransomware)\nof ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).\n\n## How Fortinet Can Help\n\nFortiGuard Labs’ [Emergency Incident Response Service provides rapid and effective](https://www.fortinet.com/support/support-services/fortiguard-security-subscriptions/incident-response)\nresponse when an incident is detected. And our Incident Readiness Subscription\nService provides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through\nreadiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop\nexercises).\n\n_Learn more about Fortinet’s_ _[FortiGuard Labs threat research and intelligence organization](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=fglabs)_\n_[and the FortiGuard AI-powered security services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/security-as-a-service/fortiguard-subscriptions?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=services)_\n\n\n-----",
