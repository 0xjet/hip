The company has redirected traffic from\nthose domains to sinkhole.cert.pl, a domain controlled by CERT Polska — an\nincident response team run by NASK. The company says it will be working with\nInternet service providers and security firms to help alert and clean up affected\nusers.\n\n\n“Since 2006, Virut has been one of the most disturbing threats active on the\nInternet,” CERT Polska wrote. “The scale of the phenomenon was massive: in 2012\nfor Poland alone, over 890 thousand unique IP addresses were reported to be\ninfected by Virut.”\n\n\nSource: Symantec\n\n\nSome of the domains identified in the takedown effort — including ircgalaxy.pl and zief.pl — have been used as controllers for\nnearly half a decade. During that time, Virut has emerged as one of the most common and pestilent threats. Security giant\n**Symantec recently estimated Virut’s size at 300,000 machines; Russian security firm Kaspersky** [said Virut was responsible for](http://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792255/Kaspersky_Security_Bulletin_2012_The_overall_statistics_for_2012#7)\n5.5 percent of malware infections in the third quarter of 2012.\n\n[The action against Virut comes just days after Symantec warned that Virut had been used to redeploy Waledac, a spam botnet](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/waledac-gets-cozy-virut)\nthat was targeted in [a high-profile botnet takedown by Microsoft in 2010.](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/02/microsoft-ambushes-waledac-botnet-shutters-whistleblower-site/)\n\n**SELF-PERPETUATING CRIME MACHINE**\n\nA file-infecting virus that has long been used to steal information from infected PCs, Virut is often transmitted via removable\ndrives and file-sharing networks. But in recent years, it has become one of the most reliable engines behind massive malware\n[deployment systems known as pay-per-install (PPI) networks. One such example was “exerevenue.com,” a popular PPI network](http://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/pay-per-install/)\nthat once shared Internet resources with the aforementioned .pl domains.\n\nPPI networks attract entrepreneurial malware distributors, hackers who are given\ncustom “installer” programs that bundle malware and adware. In return, the\ndistributors are paid a set amount for each 1,000 times their installer programs are\nrun on new PCs. Access to the PPI networks is sold to miscreants in the\nunderground, particularly spammers who are looking to increase the size of their\nspam botnets. Those clients submit their malware—a spambot, fake antivirus\nsoftware, or password-stealing Trojan—to the PPI service, which in turn charges\nvarying rates per thousand successful installations, depending on the requested\ngeographic location of the desired victims.\n\nThe Exerevenue.com PPI program died off in 2010, but cached copies of the site\noffer a fascinating glimpse into the Virut business model. The following snippet of text\nwas taken from [Exerevenue’s software end-user license agreement (EULA, and yes, this malware had a EULA). It aptly](http://web.archive.org/web/20090209064643/http://exerevenue.com/eula.txt)\ndescribed how Virut worked: As a file-infecting virus that injected copies of itself into all .EXE and .HTML files found on victim\nPCs. According to the Exerevenue administrators, the program’s installer relied on a trademarked “QuickBundle™” technology\nthat bundled adware with other programs.\n\n“3) The software will especially target .EXE and .HTML files in the process of bundling. Other types of files may also be\naffected. HTML files are bundled with adware indirectly, through Internet links, and it relies upon certain features of Web\nbrowsers that are often considered undesired. Therefore, you agree you will not deliver your bundled files to anyone who\ncan be offended by the QuickBundle technology described earlier. In order to prevent a file from being bundled with\nadware, you can change its name to begin with PSTO or WINC (in case of .EXE and .SCR files) or change its extension (in\ncase of .HTM(heart), .ASP, and .PHP files), for example to .TXT. Apart from enriching your files with ad-supported content,\nyour Windows HOSTS file will be modified to block certain domains used for adware loading automatization.”\n\n\n-----\n\n**WHO IS RUNNING VIRUT?**\n[In 2007, researchers at malware research group Team Furry published a brain dump of information that they’d collected about](http://www.teamfurry.com/wordpress/2007/09/04/so-who-is-behind-virut/)\nthe individuals they believed created and ran the Virut botnet. Team Furry pointed to [several subdomains of zief.pl and](http://web.archive.org/web/20060620132642/http://www.zief.pl/)\nircgalaxy.pl that according to archive.org hosted a somewhat active user forum frequented by hackers who used the names\n[“XMAX” and “Adx.” According to Team Furry,](http://web.archive.org/web/20060526101417/http://xmax.zief.pl/) [Adx was the hacker handle used by a computer whiz from Warsaw named Piotr](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=http://forum.antichat.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D225264&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dicq%2B590222113%26hl%3Den%26tbo%3Dd&sa=X&ei=Gv72UKe7FdGsqAGaxIHoCQ&ved=0CDcQ7gEwAA)\nNiżyński. Mr.Niżyński did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nIt’s not clear how the actions by NASK will impact the long-term operations of the Virut botnet. Many of Virut’s control servers are\nlocated outside the reach of NASK, at Russian top-level domain name registrars (.ru). Also, Virut has a failsafe mechanism built\nto defeat targeted attacks on its infrastructure. In [a blog post on Jan. 7, 2013, Symantec documented Virut’s domain name](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/snapshot-virut-botnet-after-interruption)\ngeneration algorithm (DGA); should Virut-infected PCs be unable to reach their hard-coded controllers at ircgalaxy.pl and zief.pl,\nthe malware is configured to check one of a possible 10,000 different domain names each day, generated according to algorithm\nbuilt into the malware. Armed with this backup mechanism, the miscreants responsible for Virut in theory would need simply to\nregister one of the DGA-designated domains to be able to re-establish communications and control over the botnet.\n\n\n-----",
