Initially disclosed in a tweet, the campaign rapidly unfolded](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/03/trickbot-primer.html)\nover the course of that day.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on discussions with intelligence partners and various network defenders, the\nadversaries responsible for this activity appeared to rapidly move from initial infection at\nvictim locations to interactive operations en route to attempted ransomware deployment. In\n[previous operations, TrickBot activity is associated with the deployment of](https://duo.com/decipher/the-unholy-alliance-of-emotet-trickbot-and-the-ryuk-ransomware) Ryuk\nransomware. At the time of this writing, DomainTools researchers were unable to confirm a\nfinal-stage payload for this specific campaign.\n\nAlthough this specific campaign has since passed, it contains many lessons for network\ndefenders and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) professionals for monitoring and analyzing\nemerging campaigns to enable dynamic, flexible defense.\n\n## Initial Delivery and Download Vector\n\nAnalysis of the campaign indicates initial delivery takes place using a legitimate third-party\nemail messaging or notification service. In this specific case, the adversary leveraged\n[GreatResponse, used for email marketing and landing page design, to deliver seemingly](https://www.getresponse.com/)\nbenign-looking email messages with “Corporate Document” or similar themes. Observed\nlink examples include the following:\n```\ncorpdocument1221.gr8[.]com\ncompanygeneralmeeting122220.gr8[.]com\nCompanydocument07851-3173f.gr8[.]com\n\n```\nWhen accessed, a victim would see a landing page such as the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe link would direct to a Portable Executable (PE) file, discussed in further detail below,\nhosted on Google Drive. Further execution would require the user to run the downloaded\nexecutable for follow-on exploitation to occur.\n\nThe above activity is consistent with observed TrickBot operations—as well as other entity\ntactics—using third-party services to evade detection and mitigation. For example, TrickBot\n[gang campaigns have previously used third-party delivery services such as](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/trickbot-campaign-uses-fake-payroll-emails-to-conduct-phishing-attacks/) [Sendgrid to](https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/active-trickbot-campaign-sendgrid-google-docs)\ndistribute initial phishing messages. Follow-on payloads have also been hosted on cloud file\n[storage sites, such as Google](https://cofense.com/trickbot-using-google-docs-trick-proofpoints-gateway/) [Drive, as well.](https://blog.knowbe4.com/new-trickbot-malware-attack-leverages-google-drive-to-deliver-its-payload-and-ensure-infection)\n\n## Examining Droppers and Installers\n\nFurther activity requires not only user interaction with the phishing message (displaying the\nlanding page link) and downloading the file hosted from Google Drive, but then executing\nthe payload as well.\n\nOverall, as part of the completion of this “kill chain,” DomainTools researchers observed 18\nsamples of the next-stage payload. Naming conventions for these files matched the landing\npage themes although DomainTools researchers expect more variants likely exist beyond\n\n\n-----\n\nour visibility.\n\n**SHA256** **MD5**\n\n90a51557f3438fec9b2ffab5828751cb43fa9eeb1fa84468effe95a9f13f12d0 774bdb15\n\n74d757a4cabf26009ab5f1064939c54ceea43a8399419a7c965b2edb7e0ed648 2d8c8177\n\n0e809ef68d85e730190db2663ab914dfd6ccb4c355a051841366b3a5c91ada63 0dd55da9\n\n2be628add2ab1be6120026893c6a7a51dc0b3f81c7421349504a6010581aa427 a54c10b1\n\n21df8a331f272ed9b6b72509028af31612292c9f3c0776a4472b2b585c142648 eeb42010\n\n82dbcaa7694a6e763300cee1d4b2ef6e65f6a65fd93663365ce032823984cb21 7ef4f4eb6\n\n2c6b49185dea80c48dcdd1c316a0de3413ff52a67819a720419c630093b5e638 1cd5e8bb\n\n3941242436e943fbfb7b1767aa2615bcc5637da3d939d3b06a1572de8bf044a1 5af82b39\n\n4c4b00621d0e57bcdf188174a539ca3c92a4fc96647eabe6d79c17ae04bd519d f0cc1619\n\n3985648d781de545cf1209469454b88f7f6e54696b6a050dbb7ba2ba1eae2cec c3ad311e\n\n436301cb89dadecb6c6cefc043b8a4d8f47de2054b1e84e1612cf061cd14dc15 977a7762\n\n44075e5eb7ee76b006a8f4cf2bfee30dec3c5007c02f8657f956429bb976ea4b d52710ba\n\nbed288ad6037546ecfb9e912518583fefbb7685681a8ecfd5b27502735de20bd b0c83175\n\n102dca8d268dbbba33770459009d4d67e0d714b44523c28fce57ee83fe186a31 e018926f\n\nbbe896ab541c703d699f97311a30c2e07be98be1ebf7eed9a9a1fd7dfa2efb5b de65816e\n\n69aa97d3507d4ccf7dc0bd0a97cfe509edfbdf16734fcc40cd01d8dd659fd450 4c52e80e\n\n392c73ffa3b1513cd8de9435d7e76320eff7f98db884eb6bc776c3b2bea7c77e eea12082\n\ne1841e78c6dace694cc5172bac1068b9ede38a3623c5429a877eb1190d90a14d bd7d9ae9\n\nOne sample, “View Report.exe”, is a 32bit executable that appears to date from late\nNovember 2020 and from part of an earlier, undocumented campaign. The remaining\nsamples are 64bit executables compiled on the day of the campaign, 21 December 2020.\n\nThe executables in this campaign are signed with the same Sectigo code signing certificate,\nwith the name “СКАРАБЕЙ” (Russian for “Scarab”) and a fingerprint value of\n“348F7E395C77E29C1E17EF9D9BD24481657C7AE7.” This certificate has since been\nrevoked by the issuer.\n\n\n-----\n\n[While signed binaries are not new to ransomware or related operations (with notable signed](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/d/understanding-code-signing-abuse-in-malware-campaigns.html)\n[examples including but not exclusive to Ryuk and](https://labs.sentinelone.com/an-inside-look-at-how-ryuk-evolved-its-encryption-and-evasion-techniques/) [LockerGoga variants), they continue to](https://pylos.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Spyware_Stealer_Locker_Wiper-_LockerGoga_Revisited.pdf)\npose a threat to users as many applications and security products inherently trust codesigned items.\n\nFollowing successful binary execution (through user interaction), the malware attempts to\nresolve and connect to one of at most two Command and Control (C2) servers embedded\nwithin the binary. Successful connectivity allows for further actions on target, including the\nattacker taking control of implants to launch further commands or move laterally within the\nvictim environment.\n\n## Associated Network Infrastructure\n\nAs noted in the original Tweet sparking this investigation, there were several domains\nimmediately identified as associated with this campaign. Further investigation and analysis\nof samples yielded additional items, shown in the following table:\n\n\n**Hosting**\n**Provider**\n\n\n**Domain** **Registrar**\n\nbirch-psychology[.]com NAMECHEAP\nINC\n\nbusybjjj[.]com NAMECHEAP\nINC\n\nflourish-psychology[.]net NAMECHEAP\nINC\n\nflux-psychology[.]com NAMECHEAP\nINC\n\n\n**Create**\n**Date** **IP**\n\n\n12/10/2020 192.236.155.212 Hostwinds\nLLC.\n\n12/10/2020 195.123.241.79 ITL-Bulgar\nLtd.\n\n12/10/2020 192.119.171.165 Madgenius\n\n12/10/2020 107.152.32.121 ServerChe\nINC\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hosting**\n**Provider**\n\n\n**Domain** **Registrar**\n\nfreekaratee[.]com NAMECHEAP\nINC\n\nimpactpsychcoloradoo[.]com NAMECHEAP\nINC\n\nlivingyoga-denver[.]com NAMECHEAP\nINC\n\nustfitf[.]com NAMECHEAP\nINC\n\n\n**Create**\n**Date** **IP**\n\n\n12/10/2020 94.140.114.152 SIA Nano\n\n12/10/2020 185.82.127.115 SIA Nano\n\n12/10/2020 138.201.113.2 Hetzner\nOnline AG\n\n12/10/2020 195.123.240.192 ITL-Bulgar\nLtd.\n\n\nThe identified network infrastructure serves as the next stage of the intrusion. Following\nmalware installation, active C2 would be used to further exploitation of the victim, leading to\nlikely ransomware activity.\n\n## Pivoting and Identifying Additional Items\n\nAt this stage, we as defenders are largely in a “reactive” state with respect to identifying\nindicators and characteristics of this BazarLoader campaign. While quickly ingesting and\ndeploying defensive measures based on indicators and observables may represent an\nimprovement over completely passive defense, it still leaves much to be desired.\n\nInstead, by identifying characteristics inherent to the campaign—both its network\ninfrastructure and malware samples—we can both gain greater knowledge of the attacker’s\ntendencies while enabling defense attuned to these tendencies. For the latter, this means\nadapting defense to the adversary’s fundamental behaviors as opposed to chasing specific\nexamples of those behaviors as represented by indicators.\n\n### Network Observables\n\nLooking at the domains identified above, several “themes” emerge:\n\nTypical use of naming “themes” reflecting local service providers or small business\nentities, with an emphasis on “cleaning” companies.\nConsistent use of NameCheap for registration purposes.\nAlmost exclusive use of the “.com” Top Level Domain (TLD).\nCreation on the same day, 10 December 2020.\nHosting on various relatively small, privacy-focused Virtual Private Server (VPS)\nproviders.\nUse of Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates for encrypted communications.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs [previously documented by DomainTools, these observations can be used to unearth](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects)\nadditional C2 infrastructure for threat hunting or preemptive defensive purposes.\nUnfortunately, at first glance by plotting the above items using DomainTools Iris\nvisualizations, there seems little in common on a technical level to enable successful\npivoting to additional infrastructure.\n\nYet a combination of limited technical details that overlap (registrar, TLD use, and time of\ncreation) along with “thematic” observables (the naming conventions used) can enable us to\nunearth additional items.\n\nWith this hypothesis in mind, looking for items with a similar technical structure that also\nmirror the “local service” or “local business” theme, we can identify the following through\nDomainTools Iris:\n\n\n-----\n\n**CreateCreate**\n\n**DomainDomain** **DateDate** **IPIP** **ISPISP** **SSL CertSSL

Given that all of the\nidentified items are marked as likely malicious based on DomainTools risk scoring\nalgorithms, the options available to defenders range from adding the domains and related\ninfrastructure to blocklists as a preventative measure to monitoring them for further activity.\nFor example, items such as those called out above could be flagged in various services,\nsuch as DomainTools domain monitoring, to identify when changes or file associations\noccur.\n\n### File Patterns\n\nIn addition to domain patterns, the malware samples associated with this campaign also\nfeature several commonalities that can be used for either hunting or alerting purposes,\ndepending on the tools and visibility available to the researcher. From the information\navailable thus far, we have the following insights:\n\n\n-----\n\nExclusive use of 64bit binaries downloaded from cloud storage providers.\nUse of the same Sectigo signing certificate across all known samples.\nCommon file naming conventions based on variations of “company report” and similar\nthemes.\nCommonality in C2 infrastructure.\n\nFrom the above, DomainTools researchers began investigating multiple data sources for\nsimilar file characteristics as well as items contacting domains revealed in the network\npivoting exercise documented in the previous section. From this and follow-on analysis from\ninitial findings, DomainTools researchers unearthed another BazarLoader campaign from\n17-18 December 2020.

While this did not appear to succeed in identifying “new” items (as the files\nin question appear to have been active from 17-18 December 2020, before the originating\ncampaign sparking this investigation), their discovery indicates other items in the list of\npossible domains may relate to future campaigns by the same actor. Additionally, some\nitems were revealed which featured C2 domains not related to the pivoting documented\nearlier. Examples include:\n```\nakbuilding-services[.]com\nHomeclean-heroes[.]com\nMaidtoorderfll[.]com\n\n```\nAlthough exhibiting C2 domains beyond initial research, the items were linked by a common\ncode signing certificate (again from Sectigo, and since revoked by the issuer) with the name\n“ИНТЕЛЛИТ” (Belorussian for “Intelligence”) and thumbprint\n“1103DEBCB1E48F7DDA9CEC4211C0A7A9C1764252”:\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough a different certificate than that used in the 21 December campaign, it reflects\nsimilar themes and observations. One item in common with both signing certificates is the\nprefix “OOO”, which in Russian (and related) languages is equivalent to “Ltd.” While there\nare many legitimate entities that can and do sign their software with certificates including\n“OOO” in their name, this may function as a robust indicator for organizations with few or no\ncommercial ties to Russian or related language entities for blocking or filtering files with\ncode signing certificates containing such language. This code signing observation\nrepresents a start in overall defensive planning against malware campaigns such as that\nobserved in this report.\n\n## Defensive Recommendations and Mitigations\n\nWe have already discussed several examples of possible alerting items for this campaign,\nranging from signing certificate observables to infrastructure commonalities. However,\nnetwork defenders must be attuned and responsive to a variety of adversary “tells” in\ncampaigns to ensure robust and complete defense from intruder operations.\n\nFirst, the simple identification of new or anomalous network traffic—whether as email links,\nuser interactions, or programmatic communication—can do wonders for network security\nposture. For example, all of the domains identified in the analysis so far have scored as\nlikely malicious through the DomainTools risk-scoring algorithm. By programmatically tying\nnetwork security monitoring or log capture (such as proxy logs) to a threat intelligence\nsource such as DomainTools, defenders can rapidly identify communication to new, likely\nrisky sources and use this as a mechanism to launch further investigations. Done in a timely\nfashion, this can work to disrupt ransomware actor operations and interrupt events before\nthey proceed toward ransomware deployment.\n\nSecond, organizations must be attuned to the malicious use of code signing for the delivery\nof malware. In this specific campaign, the Sectigo signing authority was abused to sign\nmalware for delivery and execution. From a defender’s perspective, we cannot completely\ndistrust Sectigo (as it is used by many organizations), but we can identify ways to narrow\n\n\n-----\n\nour degrees of trust to reduce attack surface. Within the context of the currently discussed\ncampaigns, identifying the “OOO” string, corresponding to “Ltd” in Russian and related\nlanguages, may be sufficient to distinguish between trusted and unknown software\ndepending on one’s business operations. Identifying such “tells” and their implications can\nallow defenders to take even trusted items, such as code signing certificates, and narrow\nwhat is truly allowed or acceptable within their environments versus what is anomalous or\nsuspicious.\n\nFinally, the entire infection chain outlined above relies on a user interacting with a phishing\nmessage then executing an unknown binary from a cloud storage location. These items\nrepresent critical touch points for defensive response and monitoring—and user education.\nThrough email security monitoring, organizations can identify, categorize, and filter\nproviders for things such as landing pages and response emails to reduce attack surface.\nFurthermore, organizations can limit or completely block the download of files (or at least\nexecutable files) from external cloud storage locations to further reduce risk. Lastly,\nexecution by the user of an unknown (even if signed) binary can be limited through either\ntraining or operating system controls to eliminate the ultimate stage of this attack sequence.\n\nOverall, visibility into network communications, the ability to refine those communications\nwith the support of external CTI sources, and combining this with host-based or malwarecentric observations will enable defenders to identify, track, and hopefully mitigate potential\nransomware events such as that described above. This whole-of-killchain approach,\n[similarly documented with respect to BazarLoader by Red Canary in 2019, ensures](https://redcanary.com/blog/how-one-hospital-thwarted-a-ryuk-ransomware-outbreak/)\ndetection at various stages of adversary operations. Through concerted effort and\ncontinued refinement, defenders will be able to identify “normal” activity within their\nenvironment and set that against abnormal traffic that may be related to malicious\n\n\n-----\n\noperations. As a result, defended organizations can gain some lead time over intruders,\nsetting up proactive or preemptive defenses to limit exposure to campaigns as they\nmaterialize.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this analysis, we identified an initial campaign and used related items to reveal a slightly\nearlier ransomware campaign likely related to the same adversary. By applying this process\nin a continuous, iterative fashion, we as network defenders and CTI professionals can\ncontinually reduce the scope and degree of movement for adversaries and improve the\nprospects of network defense. Marrying network security monitoring with network indicator\nenrichment through sources such as DomainTools can reveal campaigns in progress, while\nsubsequent relations to file-based observations can cement these views to enable holistic\nnetwork defense. Ultimately, network defenders must leverage all sources available to them\nin order to adequately respond to and detect such threats, with the goal of minimizing\nadversary dwell time and maximizing defender opportunities for response and recovery.\n\n\n-----",
