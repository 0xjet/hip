Incidents\n\ninvolving individuals accounted for 12% of the total.\n\n� Ransomware is still the malware that is most often used by attackers. In Q1, they\n\ndemanded astronomical ransoms and refined their arsenal, including adding\n\nnew ways to hide from security tools. There is a lot of new ransomware, for\n\n[example, Cring, Humble, and Vovalex. And the good old WannaCry is running](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cring-ransomware-hits-unpatched-fortinet-vpn-devices/)\n\n[rampant again. Ziggy operators set a precedent: they returned the ransoms](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-admin-is-refunding-victims-their-ransom-payments/)\n\npaid to the victims and \"turned to the light side\".\n\n� The most popular vulnerabilities for attackers this quarter were breaches in the\n\n[Microsoft Exchange Server software (ProxyLogon) and the outdated file sharing](https://proxylogon.com/)\n\n[program Accellion FTA. Attackers used a zero-day vulnerability discovered](https://www.accellion.com/sites/default/files/trust-center/accellion-fta-attack-mandiant-report-full.pdf)\n\nin SonicWall VPN solutions not just to hack the company, but also to launch\n\nattacks on its customers. SonicWall presumably failed to notify its customers\n\nin time about the identified vulnerability or a need to implement protective\n\nmeasures. The incident supports the argument that software manufacturers\n\nshould inform their customers as soon as possible about existing vulnerabilities\n\nand ways of protecting themselves until a patch is released.\n\n� More and more cybercriminals are developing malware to conduct attacks\n\non virtualization environments, and some are aggressively trying to exploit\n\nvulnerabilities already found in software for deploying virtual infrastructure.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, our security engineers helped to eliminate critical\n\nvulnerabilities in VMware products. We strongly recommend installing the\n\nsecurity updates as soon as possible.\n\n� The number of attacks targeting IT companies has remained consistently high\n\nfor a second quarter in a row. In 15% of cases during Q1 2021, hackers targeted\n\nIT companies to conduct an attack on their customers or to steal customer\n\ndata. At the beginning of 2021, there were still reports in the media about new\n\nvictims of the attack on SolarWinds: the company's customers claim that their\n\nnetworks have been compromised.\n\n� Telecom companies were twice as likely to be attacked as in Q4 2020. In 71%\n\nof the attacks, hackers aimed at obtaining data, with a particular interest in\n\nthe 5G technology. Nine out of ten incidents saw attackers use malware—most\n\nfrequently, RATs, which accounted for 55% of all attacks.\n\n[To protect from cyberattacks, follow our general recommendations for ensuring](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/what-companies-can-do-to-stay-safe/)\n\npersonal and corporate cybersecurity. Also, given the specifics of the attacks in\n\nthe past quarter, we strongly recommend that you install security updates in a\n\ntimely manner and pay special attention to protecting virtual infrastructure. You\n\ncan strengthen security at the corporate perimeter by using modern security tools,\n\nfor example, web application firewalls for protecting web resources. To prevent\n\nmalware infection, we recommend using sandboxes to analyze the behavior of files\n\nin a virtual environment and detect malicious activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Statistics\n\nThe number of incidents in Q1 2021 increased by 17% compared to the same\n\nperiod in 2020, and compared to Q4 2020, increase was 1.2%, with 88% of the\n\nattacks targeting organizations. Cybercriminals typically attacked government\n\ninstitutions, industrial companies, research and education institutions. The main\n\nmotive for attacks on both organizations and individuals remains acquisition of\n\ndata. Attackers' main targets are personal data and credentials, and attacks on\n\norganizations are also aimed at stealing intellectual property.\n\n\n260\n\n240\n\n220\n\n200\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n\n242\n\n\n223\n\n\n0\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n2020 2021 © Positive Technologies\n\n_Figure 1.

Emailing remains the prevailing\n\nmethod of delivering malware: attackers used it in six out of ten malware attacks\n\non organizations. Individuals are still most often attacked by banking trojans,\n\nspyware, and malware that provides remote access to the device.\n\n\n-----\n\n63%\nRansomware\n9%\n\n\nRATs\n\nSpyware\n\n\n9%\n\n\n20%\n\n21%\n\n16%\n\n16%\n\n\n7%\nLoaders\n\n\n28%\n\n30%\n\n\nBanking trojans\n\n\n7%\n\n\n7%\nMiners\n\n9%\n\nAdware\n\nOther 2%\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\n\nAttacks on organizations Attacks on individuals\n\n_Figure 7.

Methods used for malware distribution_\n\n\nOfficial app stores\n\nMessengers and SMS messages\n\nOther\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\nMalware developers continue to look for new ways of bypassing security measures.\n\nTo achieve that goal, attackers, for example, use unpopular programming\n\n[languages, as in the case of BazarBackdoor (RAT), which was rewritten in Nim;](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbots-bazarbackdoor-malware-is-now-coded-in-nim-to-evade-antivirus/)\n\n[the ransomware operators of Vovalex and RobbinHood chose such uncommon](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vovalex-is-likely-the-first-ransomware-written-in-d/)\n\nlanguages as D and Golang, respectively, from the get-go.\n\nSome attackers have upgraded their tools with features that erase traces of\n\n[malicious activity—as seen in such miners as OSAMiner, Black-T and Pro-Ocean.](https://labs.sentinelone.com/fade-dead-adventures-in-reversing-malicious-run-only-applescripts/)\n\nThe code of the OSAMiner cryptominer, which targets macOS-based devices,\n\ncontains a function that allows killing the Activity Monitor process, along with other\n\nmonitoring and antimalware tools. Activity Monitor is the Mac equivalent of Task\n\nManager. The Black-T miner, which targets Unix systems, clears bash history after\n\n\n-----\n\ndeploying its payload and erases all traces of its own activity. The added openly\n\naccessible function for hiding the process is called libprocesshider; if detected, it\n\nmay lead security experts to assume the presence of a malicious load. This tool is\n\nalso used by attackers who distribute the Pro-Ocean miner, which attacks Apache\n\nActiveMQ, Oracle WebLogic, and Redis servers, and checks the target environment\n\nbefore installation. At this stage, it determines whether to hide the malware, and\n\nif, for example, the malware finds itself in the Tencent Cloud or Alibaba Cloud\n\nenvironment, it starts the process of deleting monitoring agents.\n\nAnother way to hide the destructive load is to split the malware into archives. An\n\n[example is the Masslogger trojan designed to collect credentials. Attackers use email](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/masslogger-cred-exfil.html)\n\nto deliver the malware, and to bypass the security measures, they split the executable\n\nfile into multivolume archives with such extensions as .r00, .r01, and so on.\n\n[Having analyzed the latest attacks by the RTM APT group, the PT ESC team found](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/paas-or-how-hackers-evade-antivirus-software/)\n\nthat the attackers were using packers as a service to bypass security tools. This\n\napproach greatly complicates a search for known signatures, but behavioral\n\nanalysis of files in the sandbox allows detecting malicious activity. In addition, the\n\nuse of cryptors does not affect interaction between the malware and management\n\nservers, which means that they can be detected by analyzing network traffic.\n\n##### A cryptor (packer)\n\nIs a program that uses cryptographic methods to package malware in order\n\nto hide it from security tools during signature analysis.\n\n_Figure 9. Phishing email from the RTM group that mimics a warning from bailiffs_\n\n\n-----\n\n[Since the beginning of 2021, RTM has added the Quoter ransomware to their](https://threatpost.com/rtm-banking-trojan-quoter-ransomware/164447/)\n\narsenal. According to researchers, if the banking trojan has failed to complete its\n\ntasks and collect information from the infected host, the attackers launch Quoter\n\nonto the company's network as Plan B. Following the example of other ransomware\n\noperators, RTM employs the strategy of double extortion in their attacks. The\n\ngroup still uses social engineering methods as the main method of delivery, sending\n\nphishing emails to victims.\n\nThe group's activity in Q1 2021 decreased compared to Q4 2020, but this may\n\nindicate that the attackers are busy developing new attack techniques or refining\n\nexisting tools for now.\n\n### Ransoms keep going up\n\n[Every third attack in Q1 involved ransomware operators. At the end of 2020,](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2020/)\n\nhealthcare was the most frequently attacked sector, but in Q1 2021, the first place\n\nwas shared by industrial, scientific and educational organizations. They amounted\n\nto 30% of all incidents involving ransomware; 28% of the attacks were directed at\n\ngovernmental and medical institutions.\n\nIn about seven out of ten ransomware attacks on organizations, email was used as\n\na method of delivering the malware, and in a quarter of cases, attackers exploited\n\nvulnerabilities and searched for unprotected resources accessible from the Internet.\n\n29% 2% 15% 15%\n\n\nFinance\n\nTelecom\n\nOther\n\nMultiple industries\n\n\n1%\n\n\nScience and education\n\nManufacturing and industry\n\nGovernment\n\nHealthcare\n\nIT\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\n5% 5% 14% 14%\n\n_Figure 10.

Its operators decrypt the victims'\n\ndevices only if they connect to their Discord server. The use of Discord\n\n[was previously seen in other hackers' attacks and is becoming a frequent](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomware-only-decrypts-victims-who-join-their-discord-server/)\n\npractice. Hog operators could be testing new techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Astronomical ransoms\n\nIn Q1 2021, REvil operators broke all records in ransom demands. They demanded\n\n[$50 million after attacking the IT company Acer, and, after encrypting the network](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-giant-acer-hit-by-50-million-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[of the pan-Asian retail chain Dairy Farm Group, demanded 30 million in exchange](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pan-asian-retail-giant-dairy-farm-suffers-revil-ransomware-attack/)\n\nfor a decryptor and nondisclosure of the stolen data. Such large amounts are due to\n\n[the ask-more-to-get-more tactic. The incident with the retailer FatFace speaks to](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252498463/Retailer-FatFace-pays-2m-ransom-to-Conti-cyber-criminals)\n\nthe success of the campaign. In early January, Conti (Ryuk) operators penetrated\n\nthe company's network by conducting a phishing attack, and after seven days of\n\nreconnaissance, extracted 200 GB of data and started the encryption process.\n\nInitially, the attackers demanded $8 million. However, during the negotiations, the\n\namount was reduced to 2 million, which satisfied both parties.\n\nDue to the fact that some companies refuse to pay the ransom, ransomware\n\noperators are forced to come up with new tactics. These days, if the company is\n\n[refusing to pay, the attackers threaten to report the attack and the data theft to its](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-urges-victims-customers-to-demand-a-ransom-payment/)\n\ncustomers. The fraudsters expect that the customers will persuade the company\n\nto pay a ransom to prevent the disclosure of their data.\n\n#### Old players making a comeback\n\nThe WannaCry ransomware that thundered around the world four years ago is\n\n[back in the game. According to Check Point, the number of affected organizations](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/03/30/unfair-exchange-ransomware-attacks-surge-globally-amid-microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/#:~:text=Unfair%20exchange%3A%20ransomware%20attacks%20surge%20globally%20amid%20Microsoft%20Exchange%20Server%20vulnerabilities,-Over%20the%20past&text=In%20fact%2C%20since%20the%20beginning,in%20the%20past%206%20months.)\n\nin March 2021 increased fortyfold compared to October 2020. The malware is\n\nbeing distributed using the EternalBlue exploit. The extortionists mostly attack\n\ngovernment institutions and defense contractors, while the industrial sector ranks\n\nsecond, and financial organizations and medical institutions rank third and fourth,\n\nrespectively.\n\n#### New features\n\n[REvil has acquired a new feature: the ability to run the encryption process in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-has-a-new-windows-safe-mode-encryption-mode/)\n\nWindows safe mode, which enables the malware to bypass security measures.\n\n[Conti (Ryuk) developers have supplemented it with the ability to spread to other](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-006.pdf)\n\ndevices within the domain. It is distributed over the network through shared\n\nnetwork resources, where it creates copies of itself, and files are launched by\n\ncreating tasks in the Windows task scheduler.\n\n#### Secure storage of stolen data\n\n[DarkSide operators, who attacked the Brazilian electric power company Companhia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/eletrobras-copel-energy-companies-hit-by-ransomware-attacks/)\n\nParanaense de Energia (Copel), stealing about 1 TB of sensitive information,\n\nuse their own method of data storage. They do not store stolen information on\n\nspecially created private websites, as this is not safe. Instead, they have developed\n\na distributed database: the data is stored on different servers. This helps to limit\n\nthe number of individuals who can look at the data and avoid losing access to\n\nstolen information due to possible blockages.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12.

Another](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/z0miner-botnet-hunts-for-unpatched-elasticsearch-jenkins-servers/)\n\n[botnet, FreakOut, expanded with the help of vulnerabilities in TerraMaster (CVE-2020-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/freakout-malware-exploits-critical-bugs-to-infect-linux-hosts/)\n\n28188), Zend Framework (CVE-2021-3007), and Liferay Portal (CVE-2020-7961).\n\nSpeaking of vulnerabilities, we cannot fail to mention the incident with SonicWall,\n\n[the manufacturer of information security systems, which was hacked via a zero-day](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-firewall-maker-hacked-using-zero-day-in-its-vpn-device/)\n\n[vulnerability in the NetExtender and Secure Mobile Access VPN products in late](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-firewall-maker-hacked-using-zero-day-in-its-vpn-device/)\n\n\n-----\n\nJanuary. It was followed by media reports of attacks on the company's customers\n\nwho were using the vulnerable solutions. For example, this opportunity was used\n\n[by the UNC2447 group, which distributes the FiveHands ransomware (an updated](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/04/unc2447-sombrat-and-fivehands-ransomware-sophisticated-financial-threat.html)\n\nversion of DeathRansom) through the WarPrism loader or the SombRAT backdoor.\n\nAccording to researchers, the attackers were exploiting the vulnerability even before\n\na security update appeared. Presumably, SonicWall did not alert its customers on\n\ntime to the identified breach or a need to take protective measures.\n\n### Targeting virtual infrastructure\n\nQ4 2020 saw a trend for attackers gearing their malware toward attacks on virtual\n\ninfrastructure, and in Q1 2021, this trend consolidated. We can link this primarily to\n\nthe global process of moving corporate IT infrastructure into a virtual environment.\n\nAttackers carefully monitor information about new vulnerabilities and try to find a\n\nuse for these in their attacks as soon as possible. In early 2021, our experts helped\n\n[to eliminate several critical vulnerabilities in VMware products, including CVE-](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/vmware-fixes-dangerous-vulnerabilities-in-software-for-infrastructure-monitoring-discovered-by-positive-technologies/?sphrase_id=88812)\n\n[2021-21972 in vCenter Server, which allowed remote code execution. At the time](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/vmware-fixes-dangerous-vulnerabilities-in-software-for-infrastructure-monitoring-discovered-by-positive-technologies/?sphrase_id=88812)\n\nof publication, we estimate that the number of devices vulnerable to CVE-2021\n[21972 worldwide exceeded 6,000. After the vendor's security updates appeared in](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0003.html)\n\nearly February and the bulletin was published, Bad Packets researchers discovered\n\n[multiple network scans conducted to find vulnerable hosts.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/attackers-scan-for-vulnerable-vmware-servers-after-poc-exploit-release/)\n\n[Darkside, RansomExx, and Babuk Locker operators are aggressively exploiting other](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gangs-are-abusing-vmware-esxi-exploits-to-encrypt-virtual-hard-disks/)\n\nvulnerabilities in VMware products to encrypt data stored on virtual hard drives, such\n\nas the remote code execution vulnerabilities CVE-2019-5544 and CVE-2020-3992.\n\n_Figure 13.

To hide their malware, they use several techniques at once, including\n\nencrypting the payload, masking the malicious process as the bioset process in\n\n[Linux and using the Dynamic Linker Hijacking technique.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14. Ad for virtual or cloud infrastructure hacking services_\n\nGaining access to virtual infrastructure and cloud services is a fairly popular topic\n\non the darkweb. The services of so-called brokers are also used by ransomware\n\noperators for acquiring credentials to log in to the systems. In addition to ready-to\nuse access to certain companies, attackers post offers to hack companies to order\n\non darkweb message boards.\n\n### Targeting software developers and cloud services\n\nThe number of attacks on IT companies has not decreased since the beginning\n\nof Q4 2020. The main motive of hackers attacking this industry is to obtain data\n\n(66%). In 27% of the incidents, hackers sought financial gain, and in 15% of the cases,\n\ncompanies were hacked to facilitate subsequent attacks on their customers.\n\nThe consequences of the attack on SolarWinds were evident still even in early\n\n2021. Thus, in early March, news about the attack on the IT company Robotron\n\nappeared in the media. The incident also affected the company's customers who\n\ninstalled malicious updates for the Werkzeugkasten backup server. The investigation\n\n[revealed that the company's network was compromised as a result of the attack](https://icssecuritynews.blogspot.com/2021/03/robotron-backup-software-compromised.html?m=1)\n\non SolarWinds. According to Robotron, the first victim to install malicious updates\n\nwas a small company in the Netherlands (neither the name nor even the industry\n\nin which the company operates were disclosed). Under the guise of updates, the\n\nBlockKopieren ransomware was distributed.\n\nSupply chain attacks did not spare information security companies. In early February,\n\n[the French company Stormshield reported that its systems had been hacked.](https://www.stormshield.com/security-incident-stormshield/)\n\nAttackers compromised the technical support portal. As a result of the incident, the\n\nsource code of the Stormshield Network Security software firewall was stolen. It can\n\nbe assumed that the attackers will examine the stolen code to find vulnerabilities\n\n[in the software. In early January 2021, Malwarebytes, which produces information](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2021/01/malwarebytes-targeted-by-nation-state-actor-implicated-in-solarwinds-breach-evidence-suggests-abuse-of-privileged-access-to-microsoft-office-365-and-azure-environments/)\n\nsecurity tools, suffered due to a vulnerability in an application that has privileged\n\naccess to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure. Note that in half of the attacks on this\n\nindustry, attackers exploited software vulnerabilities.\n\nRansomware operators were involved in 56% of the malware attacks. The most\n\n[significant incidents in terms of consequences occurred with the American IT](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000800240/000119312521096780/d150149dex991.htm)\n\n\n-----\n\n[service provider CompuCom and the Canadian IoT solution provider Sierra Wireless.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000800240/000119312521096780/d150149dex991.htm)\n\nIn the first case, due to the attack using the DarkSide ransomware, the company\n\nsuspended the provision of services to some customers. The company estimates\n\nthat it will have to spend up to $20 million to eliminate all of the consequences, and\n\nthe expected loss of revenue ranges from 5 to 8 million. Sierra Wireless, which was\n\nalso affected by the ransomware attack, was forced to stop production, and the\n\n[company's website was unavailable for two weeks. In addition, the company had to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sierra-wireless-resumes-production-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[withdraw its financial forecast for Q1 2021, as it now needs to be adjusted.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-shuts-down-sierra-wireless-iot-maker/)\n\nRansomware\n\n56%\n\nRATs\n\n31%\n\nSpyware\n\n25%\n\nBanking trojans\n\n13%\n\nLoaders\n\n13%\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n_Figure 15. Malware types used in attacks on IT companies_\n\nThe share of RATs increased by 23 percentage points compared to Q4 2020. In one\n\nof the campaigns, the attackers distributed it under the guise of Xcode, a free IDE\n\n[for the Apple ecosystem. SentinelOne researchers discovered this malware in the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-xcodespy-malware-targets-ios-devs-in-supply-chain-attack/)\n\nlegitimate project TabBarInteraction. The campaign is aimed at developers who will\n\nthen inadvertently distribute remote control malware to their clients as part of the\n\n[project. Another attack aimed at software developers involved hacking the official](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phps-git-server-hacked-to-add-backdoors-to-php-source-code/)\n\n[PHP Git repository and adding malicious commits. It is noteworthy that the attackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phps-git-server-hacked-to-add-backdoors-to-php-source-code/)\n\nmanaged to add well-known developers' signatures to the commits.\n\nPopular cloud services that facilitate interaction and simplify companies' IT\n\ninfrastructure also became a favorite target for attackers. The reason for this\n\nphenomenon is that by attacking a cloud service provider, hackers can gain access\n\nto the customers' data, as it happened, for example, during the January incident\n\n[with the Bonobos clothing store. The store suffered a data leak due to an attack on](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bonobos-clothing-store-suffers-a-data-breach-hacker-leaks-70gb-database/)\n\nthe cloud service provider that the company used to store customer credentials and\n\npersonal data. A similar incident occurred with the network equipment manufacturer\n\n[Ubiquiti.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/networking-giant-ubiquiti-alerts-customers-of-potential-data-breach/)\n\nAccording to the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,\n\n[hackers managed to find a way to bypass two-factor authentication to compromise](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-hackers-bypassed-mfa-to-access-cloud-service-accounts/)\n\ncloud services. This was achieved through a \"pass the cookie\" attack.\n\n##### Pass the cookie\n\nIn this type of attack, attackers intercept the session of an already\n\nauthenticated user or use stolen session cookies to authenticate with a web\n\nresource.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Wiretapping, interception of messages, and news about 5G\n\nThe number of attacks on telecom companies doubled compared to Q4 2020.\n\n50\n\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n\n20\n\n17\n\n12\n\n17\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4\n\n\n34\n\nQ1\n\n\n2020 2021 © Positive Technologies\n\n_Figure 16. Number of attacks on telecom companies_\n\nIn 71% of the attacks, the attackers pursued the motive of obtaining data. The 5G\n\ntechnology turned out to be a really interesting topic for hackers, perhaps due to\n\nthe fact that they want to understand the features of its implementation in order to\n\n[subsequently conduct attacks on subscribers. As part of a major cyberespionage](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-defenders-blog-operation-dianxun/)\n\n[campaign, hackers created a fake website that mimics Huawei's official job portal.](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-defenders-blog-operation-dianxun/)\n\nUpon visiting this resource, a malicious Flash application was installed on the victim's\n\ncomputer, which acted as a loader for a subsequent installation of Cobalt Strike\n\nBeacon. At least 23 telecommunications companies fell prey to this campaign.\n\nIn early 2021, researchers from ClearSky reported on a campaign they identified,\n\n[which collected sensitive data. Conducted by the Volatile Cedar cybercrime group,](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lebanese-Cedar-APT.pdf)\n\nthe campaign began in Q3 2020 and continues to this day. During the attacks,\n\nhackers exploit the web vulnerabilities CVE 2019-3396 (Atlassian Confluence), CVE\n\n2019-11581 (Atlassian Jira) and CVE 2012-3152 (Oracle Fusion). Among the victims\n\nof this campaign were, for example, the American telecom company Frontier\n\nCommunications, the Egyptian mobile operator Vodafone Egypt, the Israeli National\n\nInformation Technology Center, as well as the telecom companies Mobily and\n\nSaudinet in Saudi Arabia, and other major companies in the industry.\n\n\n-----\n\n10% 10% 2%\n\n39% 39%\n\n\nClient database\n\nIntellectual property\n\nPersonal data\n\nCredentials\n\nPayment card data\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\n_Figure 17.

This fact may indicate that access to telecom companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uscellular-hit-by-a-data-breach-after-hackers-access-crm-software/)\n\nis of high value to hackers: it can be sold on a darkweb forum or used in further\n\nattacks on subscribers.\n\n_Figure 18. Ad for access to the SS7 network and cybercriminal services_\n\nAccess to telecom equipment can allow attackers to intercept calls and messages\n\nof subscribers, track their location, and conduct fraudulent operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Governmental institutions are the most frequently attacked organizations\n\nSince 2017, governmental institutions have topped our rankings of the most\n\nfrequently attacked organizations. For their malicious actions, hackers mainly\n\nused malware (63% of attacks) and social engineering techniques (56%). The\n\nexploitation of web vulnerabilities ranks third: the share of this method (22%)\n\nincreased by 13 percentage points compared to Q4 2020. Most often, attackers\n\nexploited vulnerabilities that were popular in Q1 2021, such as the ProxyLogon\n\n[vulnerability used, for example, in the incident with the Norwegian parliament](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/norway-parliament-data-stolen-in-microsoft-exchange-attack/)\n\n[and a vulnerability in Accellion FTA, which affected the audit service of the state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/data-breach-exposes-16-million-washington-unemployment-claims/)\n\n[of Washington. The APT groups LuckyMouse, Tick, and Calypso, which target](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/data-breach-exposes-16-million-washington-unemployment-claims/)\n\norganizations in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, including\n\n[governmental agencies, were also seen exploiting the ProxyLogon remote code](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/state-hackers-rush-to-exploit-unpatched-microsoft-exchange-servers/)\n\nexecution vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855). The purpose of these campaigns was\n\nto obtain data.\n\nThe share of ransomware operators in attacks on governmental institutions is\n\nincreasing: they were found in 70% of malware attacks. In addition to ransomware,\n\nattackers also used banking trojans (18% of malware attacks), RATs (13%), and\n\nspyware (8%).\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\n\n37%\n\n28% 26%\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4\n\n\n54%\n\n\n70%\n\nQ1\n\n\n2020 2021\n\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\n_Figure 19. Ransomware attacks on governmental institutions (percentage of malware-related attacks)_\n\nIn this context, we should note the February attack on smart city systems in India.\n\n[The Economic Times stressed that this is the first attack ever on the infrastructure of](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/ransomware-attack-on-pimpri-chinchwad-smart-city-servers-managed-by-tech-mahindra/articleshow/81514435.cms)\n\na smart city. The ransomware operators demanded $646,000 for troubleshooting\n\nthe problems they created. An equally interesting example is the attack by the\n\n[hacker group Hotarus Corp, which managed to hack the network of the Ministry](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-hacks-ecuadors-largest-private-bank-ministry-of-finance/)\n\n[of Economy and Finance of Ecuador and distribute their ransomware Ronggolawe](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-hacks-ecuadors-largest-private-bank-ministry-of-finance/)\n\n(AwesomeWare). The peculiarity of this ransomware is that it is written in PHP and\n\nencrypts the files of the victim company's web applications. During this attack, the\n\n\n-----\n\ncredentials of more than 6,500 users were compromised, and sensitive information,\n\nincluding emails and personal data of employees, was stolen.\n\nSocial engineering techniques were used in 56% of the incidents. For example, the\n\nAPT group SideWinder, whose activities were monitored by PT ESC, uses these to\n\ndeliver malware. Attacks by this group on governmental institutions in Southeast\n\nAsia were recorded throughout Q1 2021. As the first step of the attacks, the hackers\n\nattached a file with a .lnk extension a phishing email. If the user opened the file,\n\nthe mshta.exe utility ran, displaying a stub document to the victim to allay its\n\nsuspicions, while the main script deployed the trojan. This technique is used by\n\n[many APT groups that we talked about in Q2 2020 and Q3 2020.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2020-q2/)\n\n_Figure 20.

The information draws on our own expertise, the outcomes\n\nof investigations, and data from authoritative sources.\n\nWe believe that the majority of cyberattacks are not made public due to\n\nreputational risks. The result is that even organizations that investigate incidents\n\nand analyze activity of hacker groups are unable to do a precise count of threats.\n\nThis research aims to draw the attention of companies and common citizens who\n\nconcern themselves with the state of information security to the key motives\n\nand methods of cyberattacks, and to highlight the main trends in the changing\n\ncyberthreat landscape.\n\nIn this report, each mass attack—for example, when attackers send phishing emails\n\nto multiple addresses—is counted as a single incident. Definitions of terms used in\n\n[this report are available in the glossary on the Positive Technologies site.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/glossary/en/a/)\n\nFor 19 years, Positive Technologies has been creating innovative solutions for information security. We develop products\n\nand services to detect, verify, and neutralize the real-world business risks associated with corporate IT infrastructure.\n\nOur technologies are backed by years of research experience and the expertise of world-class cybersecurity experts.\n\nOver 2,000 companies in 30 countries trust us to keep them safe.\n\n[Follow us on social media (LinkedIn, Twitter) and the News section at ptsecurity.com.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/positive-technologies/)\n\n\nCurrent cyber threats 2021 Q1 A4 ENG 0003 02 JUN 24 2021\n\n\n-----",
