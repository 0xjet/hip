The impact of the attacks was described dramatically with adjectives like “the most serious”. The initial reports were very](https://badcyber.com/several-polish-banks-hacked-information-stolen-by-unknown-attackers/)\n[recently supported by two blogposts by Symantec and](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/attackers-target-dozens-global-banks-new-malware-0) [BAE Systems. The nationalities of affected institutions were extended also to Mexico](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.sk/2017/02/lazarus-watering-hole-attacks.html)\nand Uruguay, with even more high-profile targets in the attackers’ viewfinder that are located worldwide. There are many interesting\naspects to these attacks starting from the targets, moving on to the vector of compromise, right up to the specific features of the malicious\nexecutables used. While the first two aspects have been quite thoroughly examined so far, the malicious binaries involved haven’t received\nmuch attention so far. The purpose of this blog post is to deliver technical details of this as-yet minimally documented malware.\n\n## Distribution channel\n\nAs mentioned on the Polish security portal, the threat is delivered sneakily, via a watering hole attack, whereby a trusted but compromised\nwebsite redirects to a landing page booby-trapped with an exploit. In the case of the Polish attacks, the starting point was the official\nwebsite of Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego (the Polish Financial Supervision Authority):\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, our data indicate that the website of the equivalent Mexican authority, Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (National\nBanking and Securities Commission), also served identical malicious redirects (unfortunately, information released by web tracking services\nor by the institution itself has not yet confirmed or made any mention of this). Based on our data, the redirects went from this subsite:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Stage 1: Dropper\n\nIf the exploit kit successfully delivers the intended malware, the malicious payload – a 64-bit console application – is executed on the\nvictim’s computer. Unlike the dropper reported by BAE Systems, this program expects one of three switches in the argument list: -l, -e, or -a\n(section (2) in the following figure). While the -l switch has the same meaning, the remaining two are necessary to extract binaries of the\nnext stage from resources (section (4) in the figure) and to (auto)start one of them as a service (section (5)):\n\n\n-----\n\nIn section (5) in the figure above, the dropper tries to change the configuration of a system service in order to load the dropped loader as a\nservice. The service is configured to start automatically by the service control manager during system startup. Administrator privileges are\nnecessary to achieve the goal.\n\nUnlike the subsequent stages, the threat does not hide itself very carefully during the first stage. It even contains verbose statements that\nprovide information about the status of execution (in this case, about extracting encrypted resources; however, the debug-info like original\nfunction names are not present).\n\nThe dropper employs dynamic API loading instead of having Windows functions in its import table (well explained in the Novetta report\n[“Operation Blockbuster” on the Lazarus Group, page 34). Section (3) in the figure above displays a wrapper of this feature, going one](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf#34)\nsystem library after another.\n\nIt seems that the attackers denote the second stage as “loader” and the third stage, containing the main malware functionality, as “module”.\nThe loader is decrypted, while the module is just extracted and dropped as-is. To reduce their visibility during forensic analysis, the files\nborrow their creation time from the system’s shlwapi.dll. An interesting feature of the encryption algorithm employed is that it is quite a\n[recent RC4-like stream cipher called Spritz (https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/RS14.pdf, 2014).](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/RS14.pdf) [C and](https://github.com/jedisct1/spritz) [Python implementations of](https://github.com/edwardcunningham/spritz)\nSpritz are already available and they correspond to the following disassembled code from the dropper:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Stage 2: Loader\n\nThere is a further indication of the intent to preserve the low profile of the threat. The loader is protected by a commercial packer called\nEnigma Protector and, as we learned, the module is stored in an encrypted state, waiting for the loader to unleash it. Having taken a closer\nlook at this protection, we found that an unregistered copy of 64-bit Enigma v. 1.31 was used. Entirely as we would expect, since malware\nauthors at this level of proficiency would not normally make such elementary mistakes as potentially revealing their identity by using a\nproperly registered copy. (However, it is not unusual for criminals to abuse a leaked or pirated registered application if available.) Attackers\nintending to build a large botnet do not, in general, use commercial packers because a certain proportion of anti-malware vendors detect\nthose generically. They therefore restrict the potential size of the botnet. However, in the case of a targeted attack there are advantages to\nusing such protection. One that comes to mind is that the reconstruction of the original binary – i.e. as it was before it was subjected to the\nbinary camouflage process – is hardly ever easy.\n\nThe impression sometimes given that only 64-bit Windows machines can be targeted by this threat is wrong. A 32-bit variant has also been\nextracted from computers in some affected institutions. Though it has the same overall structure, the 32-bit variant is not just a\nrecompilation of the 64-bit one’s source, but differs slightly: the dropper and the loader stages are combined into one, classic RC4\nencryption is used rather than Spritz, and the module stage is stored in the registry instead of in the filesystem. Also, the version of the\nEnigma protector applied is 3.7, with a single developer license, and apparently used to protect the binary on 11 of January 2017.th\n\n\n-----\n\n## Stage 3: Module\n\nThe third and final stage is the relatively large module (~730 KB) that contains the main features of the malware: to communicate with the\nC&C and receive orders from operators.\n\nThe module injects itself into all running sessions on the compromised Windows system.\n\nThe next screenshot shows the situation after loading the module into the disassembling tool IDA Pro. The upper bar shows various parts\nof the binary: the code sections in blue, and the data sections in gray-and-yellow. The difference between cyan and dark blue sections is\nthat cyan represents code statically linked from existing libraries. Besides the usual C runtime, we identified the linkage of an open source\nmultiprotocol file transfer library called libcurl (version 7.47.1, released on 8 of February, 2016), together with chunks of code from projectsth\nlike OpenSSL and XUnzip. The color effect in the bar is not generated automatically: in this case, we had to explicitly mark parts that we\nconsidered as linked library code and we imported all the function names. The dark blue sections represent the code written by the\nattackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is only one encrypted URL stored in the module. Communication is encrypted. We haven t recorded any communication, because\nthe remote server wasn’t responding at the time of analysis. The module supports quite a lot of commands, with more than enough of the\nkind to clearly characterize it as a remote access Trojan (RAT). The dictionary of the commands is like this: “SLEP”, “HIBN”, “DRIV”, “DIR”,\n“DIRP”, “CHDR”, “RUN”, “RUNX”, “DEL”, “WIPE”, “MOVE”, “FTIM”, “NEWF”, “DOWN”, “ZDWN”, “UPLD”, “PVEW”, “PKIL”, “CMDL”, “DIE”,\n“GCFG”, “SCFG”, “TCON”, “PEEX”, “PEIN”. Many of the commands are self-explanatory (SLEP is to sleep, PKIL is to kill a process, UPLD\nis to exfiltrate data, DOWN is to download, DEL is to delete a file, and so on). It is possible the original libcurl functions have been\ncustomized to meet the needs of the attackers. However, libcurl is a huge project with hundreds of contributors, tens of thousands lines of\ncode and hundreds of options. The precise inspection and analysis of the linkage is in progress at the time of writing.\n\n## Lazarus-like toolkits\n\nThe researchers from BAE Systems refer to the Enigma-protected 32-bit dropper as “Once unpacked it drops a known malware variant,\nwhich has been seen as part of the Lazarus group’s toolkit…”. Moreover, Symantec states “Some code strings seen in the malware used\nshares commonalities with code from malware used by the threat group known as Lazarus.” One can find a connection also in the report by\nNovetta, such as the already-mentioned dynamic API loading. All these signs motivate us to describe actual crucial properties of a Lazaruslike toolkit as follows:\n\n(1) multi-staged malware that executes in a cascade\n\n(2) the initial stage is a console application expecting at least one parameter\n\n(3) WINAPIs are loaded dynamically\n\n(4) RC4 or similar with a long key used for the decryption of the next stage\n\n(5) the consequent stage(s) are dynamically linked libraries that are loaded as a service with the SERVICE_AUTO_START start type\n(administrator privileges are required for this action)\n\nOur data show activity of various Lazarus-like malware in-the-wild recently. However, to provide a clearer picture of the whole case, we\nneed time to collect further relevant information.\n\n## Strange discovery\n\nDuring our research, we found another interesting sample that belongs to the same malware family. A console application expecting four\nparameters called fdsvc.exe ((2) check), that executes in a cascade ((1) check). Moreover, it decrypts the next stage using RC4 with a 32byte key ((4) check). It doesn’t have the last two properties. On the other hand, it injects the payload into all running Windows sessions.\nMoreover, the payload has statically linked libcurl v. 7.49.1. What makes this sample especially interesting, is how the final stage parses\n[commands from operators. The operators are using commands in Russian language presented in a translit, which is a method of encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translit)\nCyrillic letters with Latin ones:\n\n\n-----\n\nBut we have to be careful with attribution. The language used might very well be a false flag! One quick reason that comes to mind:\nmalware authors usually implement commands via numbers or English shortcuts. Having a twelve-letter command is a bit impractical.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nConsidering the artifacts in the code, we venture to say that this is neither some reuse of code existing long before these recent Polish\nbanking attacks, nor a forgotten, discontinued project. Moreover, we have observed occurrences of malware resembling this example in the\npast few weeks. The attackers behind the threat have a good knowledge of what they are doing, so incident response teams in financial\ninstitutions or other high-profile targets might not be having much untroubled sleep in the near future. Actually, that is their job these\nmodern days: to suffer sleepless nights!\n\n## IoCs\n\n### Samples involved in the attacks\n\n**SHA1** **Detection** **Note**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA1** **Detection** **Note**\n\nbedceafa2109139c793cb158cec9fa48f980ff2b Win64/Spy.Banker.AX Dropper;gpsvc.exe\n\naa115e6587a535146b7493d6c02896a7d322879e Win64/Spy.Banker.AX Enigma-protected loader\n\na107f1046f5224fdb3a5826fa6f940a981fe65a1 Win64/Spy.Banker.AX Enigma-protected module; RAT;\n\nlibcurl v. 7.47.1\n\n4f0d7a33d23d53c0eb8b34d102cdd660fc5323a2 Win32/Spy.Banker.ADQH 32-bit Enigma-protected dropper;gpsvc.exe\n\n### Malware with a translit\n\n**SHA1** **Detection** **Note**\n\nfa4f2e3f7c56210d1e380ec6d74a0b6dd776994b Win64/Spy.Banker.AX Dropper;fdsvc.exe\n\n11568dffd6325ade217fbe49ce56a3ee5001cbcc Win64/Spy.Banker.AX Encrypted module;fdsvc.dll\n\ne45ca027635f904101683413dd58fbd64d602ebe Win64/Spy.Banker.AX Decrypted module; RAT;libcurl v. 7.49.1 (*)\n\n50b4f9a8fa6803f0aabb6fd9374244af40c2ba4c Win32/Spy.Banker.ADRO 32-bit module; RAT;libcurl v. 7.49.1\n\n16 Feb 2017 - 12:00PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
