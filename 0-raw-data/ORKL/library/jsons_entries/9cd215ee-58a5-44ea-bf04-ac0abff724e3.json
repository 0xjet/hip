WADA's nearly 100-page report resulted in a ban on\nRussian athletes from this summer's Rio Olympics.\n\nResearchers at Arlington-based cybersecurity firm ThreatConnect believe that the\ncybercriminals behind the breach were part of the decade-old Russian hacking group \"Fancy\nBear.\" Last week, WADA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said they were targeted\nby hackers with so-called phishing emails sent to users of the database claiming to be official\nWADA communications requesting their login credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter reviewing the two domains provided in the WADA alert, the researchers found that the\nsites were recently registered and their registration and hosting information are consistent\nwith Russian Fancy Bear tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)\". They also identified\nanother domain registered by the same threat actors that spoofs the official CAS domain.\n\n[ThreatConnect director of research operations Toni Gidwani told The Guardian that the](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/russian-hackers-world-anti-doping-agency-dnc-hack-fancy-bear)\ncybersecurity team believes the attack was also a form of retaliation against Yuliya\nStepanova, the Russian runner and doping whistleblower who helped uncover the statesponsored doping scandal. The middle-distance runner, whose WADA and email accounts\n[were hacked on 13 August, was called \"Judas\" by Vladimir Putin. Stepanova was then](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hackers-discover-secret-hiding-place-doping-whistleblower-yuliya-stepanova-1575992)\nforced to go into hiding in the United States with her husband Vitaly, a former Russian antidoping official.\n\n\"They attacked her email, they got her records out of WADA,\" Gidwani said. \"There's very\nmuch a retaliatory aspect to it and a way of intimidating anybody who might be thinking about\nspeaking out.\"\n\nThe firm also noted that both the phishing and Stepanova's compromise are likely a part of\n\"targeted activity by Russian actors in response to the whistleblower and the WADA's\nrecommendation to ban all Russian athletes from the Olympic and Paralympic games\" in\nRio.\n\n\"Successful operations against these individuals and organisations could facilitate Russian\nefforts to privately or publically intimidate them or other potential whistleblowers,\"\n[ThreatConnect researchers wrote in a blog post. \"At this time, we are skeptical of](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-anti-doping-agency-phishing/)\n@anpoland's origins but cannot determine the extent to which, if any, they are a Russian\nplatform similar to Guccifer 2.0 or DCLeaks.\"\n\nThreatConnect added that the recent hack highlights the strong, long-running connection\nbetween sports and Russian political figures, saying they expect to see more Russian\ncyberattacks targeting Professor Richard McLaren and Dr Grigory Rodchenkov who were\nkey sources in the doping scandal investigation.\n\n\"Russian activity targeting these organisations is an important example of how Russia\nresponds to wide-reaching current events that have negative implications for Moscow,\" the\nfirm noted. \"Organisations involved in such events can reasonably expect to experience\ntargeted Russian cyber operations that ultimately facilitate retaliatory influence or\npropaganda efforts against them. Knowledge of this TTP, and others associated with Russian\nAPT activity, can help those organisations augment their security posture and defend against\nsuch retaliation.\"\n\nMultiple cybersecurity firms including CrowdStrike and ThreatConnect have provided\nevidence linking the Russian government to the DNC infiltration reportedly carried out by\nhacker groups Cosy Bear and Fancy Bear. Following a brief Twitter suspension, 'lone wolf'\n\n\n-----\n\n[hacker Guccifer 2.0, who also claimed responsibility for the DNC hack, recently released](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/guccifer-2-0-returns-twitter-suspension-leak-more-politically-motivated-dccc-files-1576388)\nmore files, memos and dossiers from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\n(DCCC).\n\nThe Kremlin, on the other hand, has vehemently denied playing any role in the hacks.\n\n[Rio 2016 Olympics](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/topics/rio-2016-olympics)\n\n\n-----",
