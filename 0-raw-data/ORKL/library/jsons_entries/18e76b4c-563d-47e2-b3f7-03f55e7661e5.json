This includes emotet and several RAT variants.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nUsing the news to try and increase clicks and drive traffic is nothing new for malicious actors.\nWe commonly see actors leveraging current news stories or events to try and increase the\nlikelihood of infection. The biggest news currently is focused on the new virus affecting the\nworld, with a focus on China: the coronavirus. There are countless news articles and emailbased marketing campaigns going at full throttle right now, as such, we wanted to take a\ndeeper look at how this is manifesting itself on the threat landscape.\n\nOur investigation had several phases, first looking at the email based campaigns then\npivoting into open-source intelligence sources for additional samples. These investigations\n[uncovered a series of campaigns from the adversaries behind Emotet, along with a series of](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/01/stolen-emails-reflect-emotets-organic.html)\nother commodity malware families using these same topics as lures, and a couple of odd\ndocuments and applications along the way. What was also striking was the amount of\nlegitimate emails containing things like Microsoft Word documents and Excel spreadsheets\nrelated to the coronavirus. This really underscores why using these as lures is so attractive\nto adversaries and why organizations and individuals need to be vigilant when opening mail\nattachments, regardless of its origins.\n\n**What's new? Malware authors and distributors will go through any means necessary to**\nachieve success and generate revenue and this is just the latest example. These lures tied\nto coronavirus are likely to only increase in volume and variety as the virus continues to\nspread and dominate the headlines.\n\n**How did it work? The majority of these campaigns were driven through email and malspam**\nspecifically. These actors would send coronavirus themed emails to potential victims and, in\nsome cases, use filenames related to coronavirus as well, enticing victims to click\nattachments. One of the reasons this was so effective was the large amount of legitimate\nemail related to coronavirus that also included attachments.\n\n**So What?**\n\nOrganizations need to realize that attackers are going to use current events to try and\nget victims to open attachments or click links. You should be prepared and vigilant in\nidentifying these emails and ensuring they don't make it to your users inboxes.\nThere is a wide variety of threats represented here so there isn't one single threat to be\nconcerned with, just realize there will likely be a lot more.\nIt's not just malicious content, there are a lot of weird executables and other files\nfloating around that are coronavirus-themed and are unwanted, albeit not inherently\nmalicious.\n\n## Malspam campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our analysis of email telemetry, we identified several malicious spam campaigns\nleveraging news related to coronavirus to entice potential victims to open attachments and\ninitiate various malware infections. Several malware families are currently being distributed\nvia these malspam campaigns including Emotet, Nanocore RAT, and various trojans.\n\n### Emotet\n\nEmotet is one of the most prevalent malware families being actively distributed. We have\n[previously analyzed this threat in various posts, notably here and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/01/return-of-emotet.html) [here. Emotet distribution](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/01/stolen-emails-reflect-emotets-organic.html)\ncampaigns are commonly observed attempting to integrate current news topics of interest in\ntheir distribution campaigns and the current interest in CoronaVirus is no different. It has\n[been previously reported that Emotet has been making use of this theme in various email](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/emotet-activity-rises-as-it-uses-coronavirus-scare-to-infect-targets-in-japan/)\ndistribution campaigns, which we have also observed. As previously described, these emails\ntypically contain malicious Microsoft Word documents that function as downloaders for the\nEmotet malware.\n\nAn example of one of the malicious Word documents is below. As usual with these sort of\nattachments, users are prompted to Enable Editing and Enable Content, granting the\n\n\n-----\n\nattacker the ability to execute code on the endpoint to facilitate the delivery and execution of\nEmotet, thus infecting the system.\n\nOver the course of the past few weeks, we have observed large quantities of messages\nfeaturing this and similar themes being used to spread Emotet to victims.\n\n### Nanocore RAT\n\nIt is important to note that Emotet is not the only malware family currently being distributed\nusing coronavirus-themed malspam campaigns. We have also observed Nanocore RAT\nbeing distributed using similar types of email-based malware distribution campaigns.\nNanocore RAT is a remote access trojan (RAT) that is commonly distributed by various threat\nactors. RATs are one of the more common threats we see delivered on the threat landscape.\nThese malware families typically provide the attacker with remote access into the system\nand the ability to grab things like keystrokes, files, webcam feeds, and download and\nexecute files. During our investigation we did find a campaign delivering Nanocore, one of\n\n\n-----\n\nthese RATs. The campaign was a notification to customers around the status of the\ncoronavirus and the steps they are taking as an organization, as is shown below.\n\nAs you can see, the email came with a ZIP file attached, which contained a PIF executable.\nOnce the victim executed the file, Nanocore RAT was installed on the system, giving the\nadversaries remote access.\n\n### Other campaigns\n\nWe did find at least one other campaign that was ongoing, but at the time of discovery the\ncommand and control (C2) servers were down and final payload retrieval wasn't possible, but\nthe malicious intent was clear. This started like many of the other campaigns with a\ncoronavirus theme.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis particular email was notifying customers of a delay in shipping due to coronavirus and\nattached a .pdf.ace invoice file. Inside the compressed archive was an executable purporting\nto be a signed order confirmation. Upon execution, additional data was attempted to be\nretrieved but due to the server being down, it is not possible to identify the final payload as of\nthe time of publishing.\n\n## Additional malware campaigns\n\nIn addition to email campaigns leveraging coronavirus, we also analyzed various opensource malware repositories in an attempt to identify additional malware making use of the\ndisease. We discovered several examples of malware that had been submitted to the\nrepositories including adware, wipers, and other various trojans.\n\n### Parallax RAT\n\nDuring our open-source investigation, we came across a sample aptly named \"new infected\nCORONAVIRUS sky 03.02.2020.pif.\" This file was likely delivered as an attachment to an\nemail in some sort of compressed archive. Upon execution, the RAT is installed and\npersistence is achieved by creating links in the user's startup folder, as well as the creation of\nseveral scheduled tasks, and establishing command and control communications with a\ndynamic DNS provider domain, which is fairly common with RAT distribution.\n\n\n-----\n\nParallax is another RAT not much different from the nanocore campaign we found above. It\nhas the same basic functionality and allows the attacker the ability to upload and download\nfiles as well as grab things like keystrokes and screen captures.\n\n## Other samples found\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, we came across several samples that appeared to be\nmalicious and were tagged as malicious in various engines but were, in fact, odd jokes or\nnon-malicious content, including a fake wiper. This file was found with the suspicious\nfilename of \"CoronaVirus.exe\" of which there were many. This particular one immediately\nappeared to lock the screen upon execution.\n\nThe rough translation of the text displayed to the user is \"Deleting all files and folders on this\ncomputer - Coronavirus.\" Upon completion of the counter, the button at the bottom became\nclickable, and when clicked, displayed the following message:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis says it is a joke and the user can press Alt + F12 to exit. If the user pushes these\nbuttons, it drops you back at the desktop. Upon further analysis, it does not appear there\nwere any other malicious actions taken. This is just one of several odd examples found in our\nresearch including another joke game written in VBS and an odd executable wrapper of a\nwell-known outbreak map for coronavirus. None of these files were malicious but did take\nactions that could be viewed as malicious, as such, we have seen many antivirus vendors\ndetect these as malicious executables. At the very least, they are unwanted applications,\nalbeit not inherently malicious.\n\nOne additional malware sample we discovered was a wiper designed to destroy infected\nsystems. It was initially submitted to various malware repositories with the filename \"冠状病\n毒.exe\" which translates to \"coronavirus.\" The malware, when executed on systems, uses\nseveral techniques to delete data from both the file system and registry in an attempt to\ndisrupt system operations. For example, we observed the malware invoking the Windows\nCommand Processor and using the \"rd\" Windows command to iterate through the directory\nstructure of the C:\\, deleting the contents:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that there is no prior attempt to copy, exfiltrate, or save a copy of the\ncontents and the malware does not appear to make any attempt to extort victims or\notherwise generate revenue for the malware author.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMalicious actors are always going to do whatever they can to increase infection rates and in\nturn increase revenue, this includes using the news and fear to achieve their goals. This is\none of the cases where both news and fear can be used. In a world where threats like\nEmotet are stealing emails and replying in-line users need to be increasingly skeptical of all\nattachments regardless of source. These attacks can be seen in an email thread with a\ncolleague or friend and, in some cases, may come directly from that colleague or friend.\nAdditionally, anything news related should be treated with a little extra skepticism, go out and\ndo your own research instead of just clicking links and opening documents that are sent your\nway.\n\n## Coverage\n\n\n-----\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nmalware detailed in this post.
