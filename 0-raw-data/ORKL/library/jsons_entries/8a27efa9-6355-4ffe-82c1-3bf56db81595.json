The group is running the PowerShell Backdoor\nin a .NET context rather than spawning the PowerShell process.\n\nBelow is the capabilities supported by the PowerLess backdoor:\n\nEncrypted channel with the C2\nExecuting arbitrary commands\nKilling processes\nStealing browser data\nKeylogging\n\nExperts noticed a lot of typos and grammatical mistakes in the code of the backdoor, a\ncircumstance that suggests that the native language of the backdoor’s authors is likely not\nEnglish.\n\n_“It is worth mentioning that the backdoor is being run within a .NET context, so therefore it_\n_[does not spawn “powershell.exe”.” reads the analysis published by the researchers. “This](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/powerless-trojan-iranian-apt-phosphorus-adds-new-powershell-backdoor-for-espionage)_\n_behavior can be interpreted as an attempt to evade certain PowerShell detections, although_\n_PowerShell logs are being saved on the machine” “Oddly enough, there is a part of the code_\n_in the PowerLess Backdoor, that do spawn a powershell.exe process, when the request to_\n_kill a process is received from the C2”_\n\nThe toolset analyzed by Cybereason includes modular, multi-staged malware used to deploy\nadditional payloads. The attackers also used previously undetected malware, including info\nstealers and keyloggers.\n\n[In Mid-January, the Iran-linked APT35 group has been observed leveraging the Log4Shell](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/126613/apt/apt35-log4shell-backdoor.html)\nflaw to drop a new PowerShell backdoor tracked as CharmPower.\n\nCybereason also found evidence that links the APT group to the Memento\nRansomware operations that first appeared in the threat landscape in 2021.\n\n[The gang was observed exploiting the CVE-2021-21972 vulnerability in VMware vCenter](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/115001/hacking/cve-2021-21972-vmware-center-scans.html)\nServer for the initial access to target networks.\n\nIn October, Sophos researchers have spotted the Memento ransomware that adopts a\ncurious approach to block access to victims’ files. The ransomware copies files into\npassword-protected WinRAR archives, it uses a renamed freeware version of the legitimate\nfile utility WinRAR. The Memento ransomware then encrypts the password and deletes the\noriginal files from the victim’s system.\n\nExperts found multiple similarities between TTPs used by Phosphorus and the Memento\nransomware operation and attack infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Another IP that appears in US CERT s list is 91.214.124[.]143. Searching it in VirusTotal_\n_reveals other malicious files communicating with it, as well as unique URL directory patterns_\n_that reveal a potential connection to Memento Ransomware.” concludes the report. “The_\n_activity of Phosphorus with regard to ProxyShell took place in about the same time frame as_\n_Memento. Iranian threat actors were also reported to be turning to ransomware during that_\n_period, which strengthens the hypothesis that Memento is operated by an Iranian threat_\n_actor.”_\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n**[(SecurityAffairs –](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)** **hacking, APT35)**\n\nYou might also like\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Experts believe that Russian Gamaredon APT could fuel a new round of DDoS attacks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131762/apt/gamaredon-apt-ddos-attacks.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\n**[The strange link between Industrial Spy and the Cuba ransomware operation](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131754/cyber-crime/industrial-spy-cuba-ransomware.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
