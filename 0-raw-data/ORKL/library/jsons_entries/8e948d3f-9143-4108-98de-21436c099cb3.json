We found 1,091 IP addresses that\nmatched our fingerprint and 1,014 domain names that pointed to them. We developed\nand used Athena, a novel technique to cluster some of our matches into 36 distinct\nPegasus systems, each one which appears to be run by a separate operator.\nWe designed and conducted a global DNS Cache Probing study on the matching\ndomain names in order to identify in which countries each operator was spying. Our\ntechnique identified a total of 45 countries where Pegasus operators may be\nconducting surveillance operations. At least 10 Pegasus operators appear to be\nactively engaged in cross-border surveillance.\nOur findings paint a bleak picture of the human rights risks of NSO’s global\nproliferation. At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously\nbeen linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain,\nKazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nPegasus also appears to be in use by countries with dubious human rights records and\nhistories of abusive behaviour by state security services. In addition, we have found\nindications of possible political themes within targeting materials in several countries,\ncasting doubt on whether the technology is being used as part of “legitimate” criminal\ninvestigations.\n\nFigure 1: Scope, scale, and context of Pegasus as identified in this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\nIsrael-based “Cyber Warfare” vendor NSO Group produces and sells a mobile phone\nspyware suite called Pegasus. To monitor a target, a government operator of Pegasus must\nconvince the target to click on a specially crafted exploit link, which, when clicked, delivers a\nchain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone and installs Pegasus\nwithout the user’s knowledge or permission. Once the phone is exploited and Pegasus is\ninstalled, it begins contacting the operator’s command and control (C&C) servers to receive\nand execute operators’ commands, and send back the target’s private data, including\npasswords, contact lists, calendar events, text messages, and live voice calls from popular\nmobile messaging apps. The operator can even turn on the phone’s camera and microphone\nto capture activity in the phone’s vicinity.\n\nFigure 2: Diagram from purported NSO Group Pegasus documentation showing the range of\n[information gathered from a device infected with Pegasus. Source: Hacking Team Emails.](https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/5391)\n\n\n-----\n\nPegasus exploit links and C&C servers use HTTPS, which requires operators to register and\nmaintain domain names. Domain names for exploit links sometimes impersonate mobile\nproviders, online services, banks, and government services, which may make the links\nappear to be benign at first glance. An operator may have several domain names that they\nuse in exploit links they send, and also have several domain names they use for C&C. The\ndomain names often resolve to cloud-based virtual private servers (we call these front-end\n_servers) rented either by NSO Group or the operator. The front-end servers appear to_\nforward traffic (via a chain of other servers) to servers located on the operator’s premises\n(we call these the back-end Pegasus servers).\n\n### Scanning, Clustering, and DNS Cache Probing\n\n[In August 2016, award-winning UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor was targeted with NSO](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)\nGroup’s Pegasus spyware. We clicked on the link he was sent and obtained three zero-day\nexploits for the Apple iPhone, as well as a copy of the Pegasus spyware. We fingerprinted\nthe behaviour of the exploit link and C&C servers in the sample sent to Mansoor, and\nscanned the Internet for other matching front-end servers. We [found 237 servers. After we](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)\nclicked on the link, but before we published our findings on August 24, NSO Group had\napparently taken down all of the Pegasus front-end servers we detected. In the weeks after\nour report, we noticed a small number of Pegasus front-end servers come back online, but\nthe servers no longer matched our fingerprint. We developed a new fingerprint and began\nconducting regular Internet scans.\n\nBetween August 2016 and August 2018, we detected 1,091 IP addresses and 1,014 domain\nnames matching our fingerprint. We developed and used Athena, a novel fingerprinting\ntechnique to group most of our results into 36 distinct Pegasus systems, each one perhaps\nrun by a separate operator (Section 2).\n\nWe next sought to identify where these Pegasus systems were being used. We hypothesized\nthat devices infected with Pegasus would regularly look up one or more of the domain names\nfor the operator’s Pegasus front-end servers using their ISP’s DNS servers. We regularly\nprobed tens of thousands of ISP DNS caches around the world via DNS forwarders looking\nfor the Pegasus domain names (Section 3).\n\n### Our Findings\n\nWe found suspected NSO Pegasus infections associated with 33 of the 36 Pegasus\noperators we identified in 45 countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Cote\nd’Ivoire, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait,\nKyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan,\nPalestine, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland,\nTajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, the UAE, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the\n\n\n-----\n\nUnited States, Uzbekistan, Yemen, and Zambia. As our findings are based on country-level\ngeolocation of DNS servers, factors such as VPNs and satellite Internet teleport locations\ncan introduce inaccuracies.\n\nFigure 3: Global map of suspected NSO Pegasus infections.\n\n**Mexico**\n\nIn 2017, we discovered, by retrospectively inspecting their text messages, that dozens of\nMexican [lawyers,](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/08/lawyers-murdered-women-nso-group/) [journalists,](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/reckless-exploit-mexico-nso/) [human rights defenders,](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/reckless-exploit-mexico-nso/) [opposition politicians,](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/more-mexican-nso-targets/) anti-corruption\nadvocates, and an [international investigation operating in Mexico were targeted in 2016 with](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/07/mexico-disappearances-nso/)\nlinks to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. The Mexico revelations sparked a major political\nscandal, #GobiernoEspía, and an ensuing criminal investigation, ongoing as of the date of\nthis report. Even after our prior reporting on the abuse of the Pegasus spyware in Mexico, it\nappears that there are three separate operators who operate predominantly in Mexico as of\nJuly 2018.\n\n**Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries**\n\nWe identify what appears to be a significant expansion of Pegasus usage in the Gulf\nCooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. In total, we identify at least six\noperators with significant GCC operations, including at least two that appear to\npredominantly focus on the UAE, one that appears to predominantly focus on Bahrain, and\none with a Saudi focus. Three operators may be conducting surveillance beyond the MENA\nregion, including in Canada, France, Greece, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe GCC countries are well known for abusing surveillance tools to track dissidents. In\n[August 2016, UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor was targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)\nspyware after previously being targeted with spyware from FinFisher and Hacking Team.\n[Bahrain is noteworthy for compromising journalists, lawyers, opposition politicians, and pro-](https://bahrainwatch.org/blog/2014/08/07/uk-spyware-used-to-hack-bahrain-lawyers-activists/)\ndemocracy activists with FinFisher’s spyware between 2010 and 2012. In May and June\n2018, Amnesty International reported that an Amnesty staffer and a Saudi activist based\n[abroad were targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. The same operator responsible](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/08/amnesty-international-among-targets-of-nso-powered-campaign/)\nfor that targeting appears to be conducting surveillance across the Middle East, as well as in\n[Europe and North America. Saudi Arabia is currently seeking to execute five nonviolent](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/22/saudi-arabia-seeks-its-first-death-penalty-against-a-female-human-rights-activist)\nhuman rights activists accused of chanting slogans at demonstrations and publishing protest\nvideos on social media.\n\n**Other Country Contexts**\n\nWe identify five operators focusing on Africa, including one that appears to be predominantly\nfocusing on the West African country of Togo, a [staunch Israel ally whose long-serving](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/togo-how-repressive-west-african-state-built-close-ties-israel-1894664807)\nPresident [has employed torture and excessive force against peaceful opposition. The](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/africa/togo/report-togo/)\noperator in Togo may have used websites with names like “nouveau president” (“new\npresident”) and “politiques infos” (“political information”) to infect targets with spyware. A\nseparate operator that appears to focus on Morocco may also be spying on targets in other\ncountries including Algeria, France, and Tunisia. We identify several operators operating in\nIsrael: four that appear to operate domestically1 and one that appears to operate both in\nIsrael, as well as other countries including the Netherlands, Palestine, Qatar, Turkey, and the\nUSA.\n\n## 2. Fingerprinting Pegasus Infrastructure\n\n_This section describes how we traced Pegasus infrastructure, from our initial discovery in_\n_2016 until the present._\n\n### Background\n\nWe first began tracking NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware after the operators of UAE threat\n[actor Stealth Falcon (later revealed to be UAE cybersecurity company DarkMatter)](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/24/darkmatter-united-arab-emirates-spies-for-hire/)\n[inadvertently gave us visibility into Pegasus infrastructure by registering a domain name](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon/)\nwhose homepage included a Pegasus link, using the same email address as a domain for a\nseparate PC spyware product we were tracking. In August 2016, UAE activist Ahmed\nMansoor [was targeted with Pegasus with a text message sent to his iPhone. We clicked on](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)\n[the link provided in the message and obtained three zero-day exploits for Apple iOS 9.3.3, as](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)\nwell as a copy of the Pegasus spyware. We disclosed the exploits to Apple, which quickly\nreleased a patch blocking the Pegasus spyware. According to our scans, all of the Pegasus\nservers we detected (except for the C&C servers in the sample sent to Mansoor) were shut\ndown at least two days before we published our results.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Fingerprinting in 2016: Decoy Pages\n\nWhen we sought to build fingerprints for Pegasus infrastructure in 2016, we scanned the\nInternet for `/redirect.aspx and` `/Support.aspx, for which Pegasus servers returned`\n_decoy pages. A decoy page is a page shown when there is an undesired remote landing on_\na spyware server and is designed to convince the user that they are viewing a normal,\nbenign website. However, because the functionality for showing decoy pages typically\nresides in the spyware server’s code and likely nowhere else, it is often trivial for researchers\nto build fingerprints for decoy pages, and scan the Internet for these fingerprints to identify\nother servers associated with the same spyware system, including perhaps the servers of\n_other operators, if the same spyware system is used by multiple operators._\n\n### Fingerprinting in 2017 and 2018: No More Decoys\n\nAfter our August 2016 report, NSO Group apparently removed the `/redirect.aspx and`\n```\n/Support.aspx decoy pages, and further modified their server code to close an incoming\n\n```\nconnection without returning any data unless presented with a valid exploit link or other path\n[on the server. This change is in line with changes made by competitors FinFisher and](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/10/mapping-finfishers-continuing-proliferation/)\n[Hacking Team, after we disclosed how we fingerprinted their hidden infrastructure with decoy](https://citizenlab.ca/2014/02/mapping-hacking-teams-untraceable-spyware/)\npages.\n\nAfter studying the behavior of several suspected new Pegasus servers, we developed\nfingerprints ξ, ξ, and ξ, and a technique that we call 1 2 3 _Athena. 2_ **Fingerprint ξ1 is a Transport**\nLayer Security (TLS) fingerprint. Fingerprints ξ2 and ξ represent two different proxying3\nconfigurations we observed. We considered a server to be part of NSO Group’s\ninfrastructure if it matched ξ and also one of ξ or ξ . We then used 1 2 3 **_Athena to group our_**\nfingerprint matches into 36 clusters. We believe that each cluster represents an operator of\nNSO Pegasus spyware, though it is possible that some may represent demonstration or\ntesting systems. As we have done in the past when reporting on vendors of targeted\nmalware, we have chosen to withhold publication of specific fingerprints and techniques to\nprevent harm that may result from external parties generating a list of NSO Group domains\nusing these methods.\n\n\n### Charting the Rebirth of Pegasus\n\nNSO Group [apparently told business associates that our August 2016 report and disclosures](https://www.cyberscoop.com/nso-group-for-sale-1-billion-pegasus-malware/)\nof their exploits to Apple “…disrupted their work for around 30 minutes before they…\n_resumed operations.” Our scanning of NSO Group’s infrastructure tells a somewhat different_\nstory (Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Pegasus servers available over time.\nTwelve of the servers that were shut down before we published Million Dollar Dissident (we\ncall these Version 2 servers) were back online in a September 25, 2016 scan and stayed\nonline mostly continuously until an August 10, 2017 scan. These may have been C&C\nservers for clients that wished to continue monitoring old infections. We saw the first Version\n**3 server in a September 5, 2017 scan, less than two weeks after Million Dollar Dissident.**\nApproximately one month after Million Dollar Dissident, we saw what appeared to be seven\noperators online. Two months after our report, we saw 14 operators online.\n\n## 3. DNS Cache Probing Results\n\n_This section describes the results of our DNS Cache Probing study to identify suspected_\n_Pegasus infections (see Section 4 for study details, as well as the definition of a “suspected_\n_infection”)._\n\n### Background\n\nWe used the technique that we call Athena to cluster the IP addresses that matched our\nPegasus fingerprints into what we believe are 36 distinct operators; each operator makes\nuse of multiple IP addresses. We give each operator an Operator Name drawn from national\nsymbols or geographic features of the country or region that appears to be targeted. For\neach IP address used by the operator, we extracted a domain name from its TLS certificate.\nWe coded the domain names to generate a Suspected Country Focus and assessed\nwhether there were Political Themes in the domains, which might suggest politically\nmotivated targeting. We then performed DNS cache probing to generate a list of countries in\nwhich there are Possible Infections associated with the operator.\n\n### Operators Focusing on the Americas\n\n\n-----\n\nWe identified five or six operators that we believe are operating in the Americas.\n\nOne operator that we call MACAW may be focused on Honduras or neighboring countries\nbecause it made use of two interesting domain names showing a possible link to Honduras\n(politica504[.]com and eltiempo-news[.]com). However, our DNS cache probing technique\ndid not identify any suspected infections relating to this system.\n\nAt the time of our June 2017 [Reckless Exploit report about the abuse of NSO Group’s](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/reckless-exploit-mexico-nso/)\nPegasus spyware in Mexico, there were four operators using domain names that suggested\na link to Mexico: RECKLESS-1, RECKLESS-2, PRICKLYPEAR, and AGUILAREAL.\nRECKLESS-1 and RECKLESS-2 employed some domain names containing political themes\n(RECKLESS-1 used universopolitico[.]net and animal-politico[.]com; RECKLESS-2 used\n_noticiaspoliticos[.]com and politicoportales[.]org). Operators RECKLESS-1 and RECKLESS-_\n2 are so named because they were swiftly and completely shut down following publication of\nour report. Operators PRICKLYPEAR and AGUILAREAL were partially shut down: two or\nthree servers for each remained online. One month after publication, in July 2017, the first\ndomain names for a new operator, MAYBERECKLESS, that would focus on Mexico were\nregistered. The MAYBERECKLESS domains began matching our fingerprint in September\n2017. MAYBERECKLESS may be a continuation of RECKLESS-1 or RECKLESS-2. Also in\nSeptember 2017, the remaining servers from PRICKLYPEAR and AGUILAREAL were\nsupplemented with new servers.\n\n\n**Suspected**\n**country focus**\n\n\n**Political**\n**themes?**\n\n\n**Suspected**\n**infections**\n\n\n**Operator name**\n\n\n**Dates operator**\n**was active**\n\n\nRECKLESS-1 Sep 2016 – Jun\n2017\n\nRECKLESS-2 Oct 2016 – Jun\n2017\n\nMAYBERECKLESS Sep 2017 –\npresent\n\nPRICKLYPEAR Oct 2016 –\npresent\n\nAGUILAREAL Sep 2016 –\npresent\n\nMACAW Nov 2017 –\npresent\n\n### Operators Focusing on Africa\n\n\nMexico Yes –\n\nMexico Yes –\n\n– – Mexico\n\nMexico – Mexico, USA\n(Arizona)\n\nMexico – Mexico\n\nHonduras Yes –\n\n\n-----\n\nWe identified five operators that we believe are focusing on Africa. One operator that we call\nREDLIONS uses frontend domains that appear to be almost exclusively written in the French\nlanguage, including two politically themed domains (politiques-infos[.]info and nouveau_president[.]com). We found DNS cache probing hits for REDLIONS in Togo. Because we did_\nnot perform our DNS cache probing study until July 2018, we did not have the opportunity to\nprobe one operator, AK47, which shut down in July 2017. Operators ATLAS and\nGRANDLACS also made use of politically themed domains (ATLAS used revolution_news[.]co and GRANDLACS used politicalpress[.]org)._\n\n\n**Suspected**\n**country**\n**focus**\n\n\n**Political**\n**themes?** **Suspected infections**\n\n\n**Operator**\n**name**\n\n\n**Dates**\n**operator was**\n**active**\n\n\nREDLIONS Mar 2017 –\npresent\n\nATLAS Aug 2017 –\npresent\n\nGRANDLACS Jun 2017 –\npresent\n\nMULUNGUSHI Feb 2018 –\npresent\n\nAK47 Dec 2016 –\nJul 2017\n\n\n– Yes Togo\n\nMorocco Yes Algeria, Cote d’Ivoire,\nFrance, Morocco, Tunisia,\nUAE\n\n\n_Great Lakes_\nregion of\nAfrica\n\n\nYes Kenya, Rwanda, South\nAfrica, Uganda\n\n\nZambia – South Africa, Zambia\n\nMozambique – –\n\n\n### Operators Focusing on Europe\n\nWe identified five operators that we believe are focusing on Europe.

One operator,\nPEARL, appears to be focused on Bahrain. One operator, KINGDOM, was behind the recent\ntargeting of an Amnesty staffer and a Saudi Arabian activist abroad. Operator PEARL used\npolitically themed domain names including shia-voice[.]com (referring to a politically\nrepressed religious group in Bahrain) and 14-tracking[.]com (perhaps referring to the\nFebruary 14 Youth Coalition, a group leading some anti-government protests), and operator\nFALCON used nomorewarnow[.]com.\n\n\n**Suspected**\n**country**\n**focus**\n\n\n**Political**\n**themes?** **Suspected infections**\n\n\n**Operator name**\n\n\n**Dates**\n**operator**\n**was**\n**active**\n\n\nPEARL Jul 2017\n– present\n\nFALCON Oct 2016\n– present\n\nBABYFALCON May 2018\n– present\n\nMAYBEFALCON Sep 2016\n– present\n\nBLACKBIRD Sep 2016\n– present\n\nKINGDOM Oct 2017\n– present\n\nMIDDLE Sep 2016\n– present\n\nOLIVE-1 Jun 2017\n– present\n\nOLIVE-2 Aug 2017\n– present\n\n\nBahrain Yes Bahrain, Qatar\n\nUAE Yes UAE\n\n\nGCC\nRegion\n\n\n– UAE\n\n\n– – UAE\n\n– – Greece, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya,\nQatar, UAE, UK, USA, Yemen\n\n\nSaudi\nArabia\n\n\n– Bahrain, Canada, Egypt, France,\nIraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco,\nQatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UK\n\n\n– – France, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman,\nQatar, Tunisia, Turkey, UAE\n\n– – Israel\n\n– – Israel\n\n\n-----\n\n**Suspected**\n**country**\n**focus**\n\n\n**Political**\n**themes?** **Suspected infections**\n\n\n**Operator name**\n\n\n**Dates**\n**operator**\n**was**\n**active**\n\n\nOLIVE-3 Dec 2016\n– present\n\nOLIVE-4 Oct 2016\n– present\n\nDOME Mar 2018\n– present\n\n\n– – Israel\n\n– – Israel\n\n– – Israel, Netherlands, Palestine,\nQatar, Turkey, USA\n\n\n### Operators Focusing on Asia\n\nWe identified five operators that we believe are focusing on Asia.

We found interesting DNS cache hits in Israel and Bahrain, but did not have**\nenough information to determine whether these might be suspected infections. It may be the\n\n\n-----\n\ncase that SUPERSIZE was monitoring relatively few people with a relatively large amount of\ninfrastructure, or that some of SUPERSIZE’s targets may have been outside areas we could\nmeasure with DNS cache probing, or that SUPERSIZE was operating in an especially\nstealthy manner with targets under sporadic, rather than continuous, surveillance.\n\nOperator SNEAK (active Oct 2016 – present) had infrastructure that appeared to reflect a\nhigh level of customization, including running C&C servers on nonstandard ports, and\nmaking use of dynamic DNS services. SNEAK was the operator that accidentally reused\nsome of its old infrastructure, facilitating our continued visibility into NSO Group’s\ninfrastructure after our Million Dollar Dissident report. We found interesting DNS cache hits\non this system in Syria, Lebanon, Qatar, the Netherlands, and the United States, but did not\nhave enough information to determine whether these might be suspected infections.\n\nOperator PARTY (active May 2017 – present) used domain names with extremely long TTLs.\nWe found interesting DNS cache hits on this system in Syria and Lebanon, but did not have\nenough information to determine whether these might be suspected infections.\n\n## 4. DNS Cache Probing Technique\n\n_This section describes our DNS Cache Probing technique._\n\n### Background on DNS and Cache Probing\n\nWhen a user (or a computer program) instructs a computer or mobile device to communicate\n[with a domain name (e.g., www.citizenlab.ca), the device first sends a request to a Domain](http://www.citizenlab.ca/)\nName Service (DNS) server, in order to learn the IP address corresponding to the domain\nname. By default, the device communicates with a DNS server maintained by the ISP or\ntelecom company to which the device is connected.\n\nDNS servers cache mappings between IP addresses and domain names temporarily,\ntypically for a duration specified by the owner of the domain name (e.g., 300 seconds). When\na device looks up a domain name that is not in the server’s cache, the server contacts other\nDNS servers to resolve the domain name “recursively” and then stores the record in the\ncache. When a device looks up a domain name that is already in the server’s cache, the\nserver returns the record from the cache, along with a time to live _(TTL) value, that indicates_\nwhen the server will expire the record from the cache. If the TTL value returned by the server\nis less than that set by the owner of the domain, then it is likely that the record returned by\nthe DNS server was present in the server’s cache, and thus was looked up by some other\nISP user relatively recently.\n\nOne can also send a query to a DNS server with the Recursion Desired flag set to 0 (called a\n_nonrecursive query), indicating to the server that it should only consult its cache before_\nresponding; if the record is not in the cache, the server should not contact other servers to\n\n\n-----\n\nattempt to resolve the domain and should not add anything to its cache. Some DNS servers\nmay choose to not respect this flag.\n\nSending queries (whether nonrecursive or recursive) to a DNS server for the purpose of\nobserving less-than-full TTLs is a measurement technique called DNS cache probing or DNS\n_cache snooping. The author of the_ [original presentation of DNS cache probing in 2004](http://cs.unc.edu/~fabian/course_papers/cache_snooping.pdf)\nframed it as detrimental to security and privacy and proposed that operators of DNS servers,\nsuch as ISPs, should block DNS queries not originating from their own network.\nImplementing such a precaution would make it harder for a single observer to directly probe\ncaches of DNS servers. A [2006 investigation of a botnet C&C server employed DNS cache](https://lasr.cs.ucla.edu/classes/239_1.fall10/papers/p4-rajab.pdf)\nprobing to investigate prevalence of botnet infections; the authors in that case appear to\nhave probed DNS servers that were authoritative for some domain, rather than DNS\nforwarders.\n\nEven in cases where ISPs block requests to their DNS servers from non-ISP-users, it is\nsometimes possible to probe the DNS servers’ caches, by using open DNS forwarders on\nthe ISP’s network. An open DNS forwarder is a service that accepts queries from any\nInternet user, and forwards the query, unmolested, perhaps to an ISP server, which then\nresponds to the forwarder, which in turn responds to the user. From the perspective of the\nISP’s DNS server, the submitter of the query (the forwarder) is on the ISP’s network. Open\nDNS forwarders may be running on improperly configured routers or IoT devices.\n\n### Note: Ethics of DNS Cache Probing\n\n[In keeping with the growing emphasis on ethics in](https://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2012/menlo_report_actual_formatted/) [network measurement research, we](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/10/207765-ethical-considerations-in-network-measurement-papers/abstract)\nconsidered the impacts of our technical activities on persons that are not the targets of our\nresearch, and sought to minimize the likelihood of any disruption. Notably we examined the\npossibility of costs to users, service disruption, or unwanted warnings from their ISPs. We\nbelieve that this research was conducted in a manner that mitigates these risks, and serves\nthe public interest.\n\nFirstly, we considered the possibility that users might incur costs or service disruption as a\nresult of our DNS Cache Probing. We believe that this is a highly unlikely outcome, given the\nsmall number of requests made during the activity. As deployed, the technique results in\nfewer than one request per second per IP address, and thus is less than one kilobyte per\nsecond. The total traffic is thus less than 100 megabytes per day. To further minimize load on\nthe authoritative name servers for the domains that we are probing, we use nonrecursive\nqueries only. As a result, we do not anticipate costs incurred by users, or bandwidth\ndegradation.\n\nWe determined that it was unlikely that users would receive unwelcome inquiries from their\nISPs, or other authorities, as the result of our DNS cache probing. Certainly, open DNS\nforwarders are a major Internet security risk, as they may be employed in DNS amplification\nDDoS attacks. Such high-volume attacks might come to the notice of ISPs or other\n\n\n-----\n\nauthorities and trigger inquiries or sanction by ISPs. DNS Cache Probing, in contrast, is a\nvery low-volume activity. If an open DNS operator has not already received a contact from\ntheir ISP, we think it very unlikely that this technique will trigger contacts, since it does not\nlook ‘attack-like.’\n\nAt the time of writing, we are unaware of any evidence of DNS Cache Probing used in\nmalicious real-world attacks. As the technique of DNS Cache Probing continues to be\ndeveloped as a research tool, it will be important to ensure that it continues to be used in\nways that do not present privacy and security concerns.\n\n### Finding Suitable DNS Forwarders\n\nWe first develop a list of suitable DNS forwarders. We run three tests to answer the following\nquestions:\n\n1. Does the forwarder appear to use resolvers that honour nonrecursive queries?\n\nWe send a nonrecursive query for a randomized subdomain of a domain we control\nand check if we get a response. The randomized subdomain resolves to an IP but\nshould not be in any cache. We check each IP twice; if we ever get a correct answer,\nthen the IP does not honour nonrecursive queries.\n2. Which resolvers does the forwarder use? We run a customized nameserver for a\n\ndomain we control; the nameserver returns the source IP of an incoming DNS query as\none of the answers in the response. We query each IP 10 times with a recursive query\nfor a randomized subdomain of the domain we control and collect the set of IPs\nreturned by our nameserver.\n3. Is the forwarder likely to have access to an interesting cache? We query each IP\n\n10 consecutive times with a recursive query for google.com. If an IP returns a response\nwith an IP in Google’s autonomous system (AS #15169) at least once, then the\nforwarder may have access to an interesting cache.\n\nA DNS forwarder is suitable if:\n\nIt appears to honour nonrecursive queries.\nThe forwarder appears to only ever forward requests to resolvers in a single\nAutonomous System (AS). We exclude forwarders that use resolvers in multiple ASes\nbecause when such a forwarder shows a DNS cache hit, we do not know in which AS\nthe DNS cache hit actually occurred.\nThe (single) AS of the forwarder’s resolvers is designated as “Transit/Access” by\n[CAIDA’s AS Classification dataset. This helps avoid some cloud providers and shared](https://www.caida.org/data/as-classification/)\n_DNS providers like Google, OpenDNS, Yandex, CloudFlare, etc._\nThe AS of the forwarder’s resolvers is not equal to any AS where we found a match for\nan NSO Group server.\nThe forwarder is not itself a resolver; in other words, the forwarder IP does not appear\namongst the resolvers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe forwarder is likely to have access to an interesting cache.\n\nEach time we scanned, our list included ~38,000 suitable forwarders, excluding forwarders in\nChina.\n\n### Understanding DNS Cache Probing False Positives\n\nDNS cache probing can produce false positives, i.e., the DNS cache probing technique\nreports that the domain is in the cache, when it is in fact not in the cache, or when we caused\nit to be in the cache. This can happen in the following three cases:\n\n1. A DNS forwarder does not honor nonrecursive queries all of the time; it may forward\n\nsome subset of our queries to a resolver that does not honor nonrecursive queries.\nThis can result in our query adding the domain to the cache.\n2. A DNS forwarder might return the entry that we added to the cache in (1). This can\n\nhappen even for DNS forwarders that do honour nonrecursive queries 100% of the\ntime.\n3. Automated processes or curious researchers may observe our DNS cache probing and\n\nsend DNS queries for the domain names we are probing; this may add the domain\nnames to caches we are probing.\n\nWe conducted several control experiments to determine how best to exclude false positives.\nIn our control experiments, we selected 50 domain names with a wildcard record and an\nauthoritative TTL of at least 300 seconds, then generated a random string to use as a\nsubdomain, and continuously queried all 50 domains (with the subdomain) on all resolvers\nonce roughly every 300 seconds in a fixed order, at a rate ensuring each domain was\nqueried at least once every 300 seconds. We ran the experiment for 24 hours.\n\nAny results we received during the control experiments we treated as false positives. We\ndeveloped a set of heuristics to reduce the false positive rate to 0 in these experiments, with\nthe idea that these same heuristics might help us eliminate many false positives from our\nDNS cache probing study of the spyware domains. These are the conditions we applied to\neliminate false positives from our results:\n\n1. Exclude duplicate observations of the same lookup: For each DNS server\n\nresponse, we check to see if the observation is a duplicate. Specifically, if a response\nfor a given domain name was preceded by a response (from any DNS forwarder) for\nthat same domain name n seconds ago, and the TTL of the prior response differed by\n_n (± 2) from the present response, then we excluded the present response._\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Exclude possible duplicate observations even if clocks run at an incorrect rate:\n\nFor each ASN, we excluded a record if its TTL was less than or equal to the\nimmediately prior record for that domain returned by any DNS forwarder for the same\nASN (or IP). We implemented this condition because for some ASNs, we identified\nmonotonically nondecreasing sequences of TTLs (for domains with large TTLs) that\nappeared to correspond with clocks running at incorrect rates, and suspected that\nthese may have been false positives.\n3. Exclude any observation with an improper TTL: We exclude all observations with\n\nTTLs larger than the TTL set by the domain name’s authoritative DNS server\n(authoritative TTL), as well as all observations with TTLs within 2 of the authoritative\nTTL, as well as all observations with popular fixed TTL values (0, 1, 9, 10, 11, 30, 60,\n80, 100, 300, 1000, 10000).\n4. Exclude all responses from DNS forwarders that ever return a wrong answer: We\n\nalso excluded all responses from a DNS forwarder if it ever returned an incorrect IP\naddress in a response for the query.\n5. Exclude all responses from caches in same country as domain name hosted: For\n\na given domain name, we excluded all DNS cache responses coming from DNS\nforwarders for ASNs in the same country where the domain name was hosted. For\ninstance, if a domain name pointed to an IP address in Italy, we would exclude all DNS\ncache hits from Italy on that domain name as potential false positives.\n6. Exclude infrequent responses: Unless resolvers in a given ASN returned at least\n\nfour responses for a given domain that were not otherwise excluded, we excluded the\nresponses for that domain from the ASN.\n\nOur conditions for excluding results were very liberal, and could result in false negatives.\nNote that when we say we excluded a response, we mean that the response was not\nincluded as a final result. We continued to consider excluded responses as reasons to\nexclude other responses.\n\n### Why Is a Domain Name in the Cache?\n\nThere are many reasons a domain name may be in a cache (assuming we did not\naccidentally put it there). We are only interested in cache entries that might arise from\nsuspected infections. We briefly introduce our working model of how NSO’s Pegasus\nspyware deployments operate, supported by evidence from a staged shutdown of NSO\nGroup’s infrastructure.\n\nOur mental model of deployment of the Pegasus spyware is that most operators have two\nC&C servers to which most infections talk, and that the rest of their infrastructure comprises\ndomains that are used in exploit links. After reports concerning the use of Pegasus spyware\nwere published by Amnesty International and Citizen Lab on August 1, 2018, a staged\n_shutdown of the Pegasus infrastructure was conducted over a period of several days. At first,_\nthe bulk of frontend domains appeared to be shut down, while a handful of final domains\n\n\n-----\n\n(usually two) remained active for each operator. We believe that these were the C&C servers\nand that the domains were kept online so that infected devices would have an opportunity to\nbeacon back and receive instructions on new C&C servers with which they should\ncommunicate.\n\nIf a given operator had exactly two final domains, we assumed that these were C&C servers.\nIf an operator had more than two final domains, we assumed that some subset of size 2\nwere the C&C servers. We did not identify any operator for which our DNS cache probing\ntechnique reported hits on different subsets of size 2 from the final domains. We then filtered\nour responses for ASNs which had hits on both hypothesized C&C domains and considered\nthese to be suspected infections.\n\n### The Experiments\n\nOnce we had developed our technique for reducing false positives, we DNS cache probed\nfor all domains we linked to NSO Group’s infrastructure that were active and matching our\nfingerprints. We queried domains at least once per their period of authoritative TTL. Because\nof the large number of domains and servers, and our desire to conserve bandwidth, we\nalternated which domains we were probing. Each domain name was probed for at least three\n24-hour periods.\n\n### Possible Limitations\n\nFactors such as the use of VPNs and satellite Internet connections may skew our\ngeolocation results. Thus, the country mapping should serve as a guide for further\ninvestigation, rather than ironclad evidence of monitoring. Additionally, it is possible that\nunusual configurations of DNS forwarders (such as the use of consistent hashing to consult\ndifferent resolvers for different domain names) could defeat our filtering techniques and\nintroduce false positives.\n\nWe are not sure what percentage of all DNS queries are observable by our method and note\nthat the percentage could vary greatly across different countries and ISPs. Therefore, it is\npossible that our technique has missed a significant number of infections and may have\nfailed to measure certain countries or ISPs entirely. Importantly, operators that appear in our\nresults to be operating in a single country may actually be operating in multiple countries. We\ndid not conduct any DNS cache probing of IPs in Mainland China.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThis report identifies 45 countries with suspected Pegasus spyware infections operated by at\nleast 33 likely NSO customers. We determined this by performing DNS cache probing on\ndomain names we extracted from command and control (C&C) servers matching a newly\ndevised fingerprint for Pegasus. We grouped the C&C servers, with each group representing\n\n\n-----\n\na single Pegasus operator (assumed to be an NSO customer) using a technique that we call\n_Athena. The resulting global map of NSO Pegasus infections reveals several issues of_\nurgent concern.\n\n### Known spyware abusers operating Pegasus\n\nWhile some NSO customers may be using Pegasus spyware as part of ‘lawful’ criminal or\nnational security investigations investigations, at least six countries with significant Pegasus\noperations have a public history of abusing spyware to target civil society.\n\nThree Pegasus operators appear to be operational in Mexico, despite the extensive evidence\nof abuses of Pegasus to target Mexican civil society uncovered by Citizen Lab and our\npartners in 2017. The findings of widespread targeting in Mexico led to international outcry\nand a criminal investigation. However, they do not appear to have resulted in the termination\nof all of the Pegasus operations in that country.\n\n[In 2016, Citizen Lab exposed the use of Pegasus to target Ahmed Mansoor, a UAE-based](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/uae-activist-ahmed-mansoor-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison-for-social-media-posts/)\nhuman rights defender. Despite this disclosure and resulting public outcry, it appears that a\nsuspected UAE-based Pegasus deployment remains operational. Most recently, a Saudi\nArabia-linked campaign appears to be continuing, despite a recent investigation linking it to\nthe [targeting of an Amnesty International staff member and a Saudi activist.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/08/amnesty-international-among-targets-of-nso-powered-campaign/)\n\nBahrain, another country that may host a Pegasus operator, has a notorious history of\n[abusing spyware to target civil society. Notably, the operator linked to Bahrain appears to be](https://citizenlab.ca/2012/07/from-bahrain-with-love-finfishers-spy-kit-exposed/)\nusing domain names with political themes, which is highly concerning, given that country’s\nhistory of abuses of surveillance technology. The Togo-linked operator also appears to be\nusing politically-themed domains. Togo has a history of authoritarian rule and human rights\nabuses.\n\n### Widespread cross-border surveillance with Pegasus\n\nTen Pegasus operators appear to be conducting surveillance in multiple countries. While we\n[have observed prior cases of cross-border targeting, this investigation suggests that cross-](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/03/hacking-team-reloaded-us-based-ethiopian-journalists-targeted-spyware/)\nborder targeting and/or monitoring is a relatively common practice. The scope of this activity\nsuggests that government-exclusive spyware is widely used to conduct activities that may be\nillegal in the countries where the targets are located. For example, we have identified several\npossible Pegasus customers not linked to the United States, but with infections in US IP\n_space. While some of these infections may reflect usage of out-of-country VPN or satellite_\nInternet service by targets, it is possible that several countries may be actively violating\nUnited States law by penetrating devices located within the US.\n\n### Failures at due diligence, contribution to global cyber insecurity\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cases identified in this report raise serious doubts as to the depth and seriousness of\nNSO’s due diligence and concern for human rights protections. They also suggest that the\ncompany has a significant number of customers that maintain active infections in other\ncountries, likely violating those countries laws. The global market for government exclusive\nspyware continues to grow, and as it does, more governments and security services with\nhistories of abuse will acquire this technology. The expanding user base of spyware like\nPegasus will enable a growing number of authoritarian states to pry into into the digital lives\nof their own citizens, but also into phones and computers in pockets and purses around the\nglobe.\n\n### Communications with NSO Group\n\n[On 14 September 2018, Citizen Lab Director Ron Deibert sent a letter to two NSO Group](https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Citizen-Lab-NSO-Group-09-2018.pdf)\nprincipals, Mr. Omri Lavrie and Mr. Shalev Hulio, notifying them of the details of this report,\nexplaining that we had shared an embargoed copy with journalists and offering to publish in\nfull any response they wished to communicate on the record.\n\nOn 14 September 2018, Mr. Hulio responded by email saying “we have suggested several\ntimes in the past to meet you and your colleagues, but, unfortunately, our requests have\nbeen ignored.” The Citizen Lab Director and staff have no record of any such outreach.\nMoreover, the Citizen Lab does not believe that a private meeting with researchers is a\nproper substitute for responsible public communication on such a serious matter of public\ninterest.\n\nMr. Hulio also claimed “Contrary to statements made by you, our product is licensed to\ngovernment and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of investigating and\npreventing crime and terror. Our business is conducted in strict compliance with applicable\nexport control laws.” Citizen Lab research does not speak to what statements NSO may\nmake during marketing, sales, or export compliance. However, our research continues to\ndemonstrate some highly concerning real-world examples of the abuse of NSO Group\ntechnology in practice. These uses have included apparent government customers of NSO\nGroup abusing Pegasus spyware to target civil society groups, human rights defenders,\nlawyers, politicians, and journalists.\n\n[On 17 September 2018, we then received a public statement from NSO Group. The](https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NSO-Statement-17-September-2018.pdf)\nstatement mentions that “the list of countries in which NSO is alleged to operate is simply\n_inaccurate. NSO does not operate in many of the countries listed.” This statement is a_\nmisunderstanding of our investigation: the list in our report is of suspected locations of NSO\ninfections, it is not a list of suspected NSO customers. As we describe in Section 3, we\nobserved DNS cache hits from what appear to be 33 distinct operators, some of whom\nappeared to be conducting operations in multiple countries. Thus, our list of 45 countries\nnecessarily includes countries that are not NSO Group customers. We describe additional\nlimitations of our method in Section 4, including factors such as VPNs and satellite\nconnections, which can cause targets to appear in other countries.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe NSO statement also claims the NSO s Business Ethics Committee, which includes\noutside experts from various disciplines, including law and foreign relations, reviews and\napproves each transaction and is authorized to reject agreements or cancel existing\nagreements where there is a case of improper use.” We have seen no public details\nconcerning the membership or deliberations of this committee but encourage NSO Group to\n[disclose them. NSO’s statements about a Business Ethics Committee recall the example of](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gvyemx/hacking-team-the-hack-on-us-was-not-done-by-some-random-guy)\nHacking Team’s “outside panel of technical experts and legal advisors … that reviews\npotential sales.” This “outside panel” appears to have been a single law firm, whose\n[recommendations Hacking Team did not always follow.](https://theintercept.com/2015/07/07/leaked-documents-confirm-hacking-team-sells-spyware-repressive-countries/)\n\nThe continued supply of services to countries with problematic human rights track records\nand where highly-publicized abuses of spyware have occurred raise serious doubts about\nthe effectiveness of this internal mechanism, if it exists at all.\n\n**Update**\n\nOn 18 September 2018, NSO emailed the following addendum to their previous public\nstatement:\n\n“There are multiple problems with Citizen Lab’s latest report. Most significantly, the list of\ncountries in which NSO is alleged to sell or where our customers presumably operate the\nproducts is simply inaccurate. NSO does not sell its products in many of the countries listed.\nThe product is only licensed to operate in countries approved under our Business Ethics\nFramework and the product will not operate outside of approved countries. As an example,\nthe product is specifically designed to not operate in the USA.”\n\nIn addition to our DNS cache probing technique showing suspected infections in the United\nStates, we previously observed a suspected Mexican operator target a minor child in the\nUnited States with Pegasus infection attempts, including messages impersonating the US\nembassy. Also, as part of our _[Million Dollar Dissident report in 2016, we successfully](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)_\ninfected our test phone (in the United States at the time) with a Pegasus link sent to UAE\nactivist Ahmed Mansoor\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nBill Marczak’s work on this project was supported by the Center for Long Term Cybersecurity\n(CLTC) at UC Berkeley.
