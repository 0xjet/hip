These actions\nhave undermined international stability and security by opening the door to a range of other\nactors, including cybercriminals, who continue to exploit this vulnerability for illicit gain.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Australian Government is also seriously concerned about reports from our international\npartners that China's Ministry of State Security is engaging contract hackers who have\ncarried out cyber-enabled intellectual property theft for personal gain and to provide\ncommercial advantage to the Chinese Government.\n\nAustralia calls on all countries – including China – to act responsibly in cyberspace. China\nmust adhere to the commitments it has made in the G20, and bilaterally, to refrain from\ncyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, trade secrets and confidential business\ninformation with the intent of obtaining competitive advantage.\n\nSince 2017, Australia has publicly attributed malicious cyber activity to North Korea, Russia,\nChina and Iran. Most recently, Australia joined more than 30 international partners to hold\nRussia to account for its harmful cyber campaign against SolarWinds. Australia calls out\nthese malicious activities to highlight the significant risk they can pose to Australia's national\nsecurity or to international stability, which in turn can undermine business confidence and\ninclusive economic growth.\n\nAustralia's cyber security posture is strong, but there is no room for complacency given the\nonline threat environment is constantly evolving. Protecting Australia from malicious cyber\nactivity – be it by state actors or cybercriminals – requires a continuous improvement\napproach to cyber security practices across all levels of society including government,\nbusiness and households.\n\nThe Australian Government will continue to work with international partners and the private\nsector to strengthen cyber security, including through the implementation of Australia's Cyber\n_Security Strategy 2020 and Australia's International Cyber and Critical Technology_\n_[Engagement Strategy. All Australians are encouraged to visit cyber.gov.au for advice on](https://www.cyber.gov.au/)_\nhow to protect themselves online.\n\n## Media enquiries\n\nMinister's office: (02) 6277 7500\nDFAT Media Liaison: (02) 6261 1555\n\n\n-----",
