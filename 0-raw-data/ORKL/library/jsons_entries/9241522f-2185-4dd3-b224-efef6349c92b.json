ZeroFox Threat Research has identified a change in](https://www.zerofox.com/blog/defining-malware-as-a-service/)\nfocus among the developers of an information stealer known as Raccoon Stealer. In this\npost, we’ll take a closer look at the pivot towards protecting this information stealer through\nthe use of “crypters” and offer recommendations for how security teams can address this\nongoing threat.\n\n## Defining Raccoon Stealer\n\nAn information stealer (also known as an infostealer) typically acts as a Trojan designed to\ngather information from a system. The most common stealers collect data such as\nusernames and passwords, which it then sends to another system via email, over a network\nor other means of export. Keyloggers are another popular information stealer that focuses on\nlogging a user’s keystrokes to uncover sensitive information and additional access.\n\n[Raccoon Stealer is an information stealer type of malware first advertised on various](https://www.zerofox.com/blog/malware-attacks-more-than-just-ransomware/)\nunderground forums in April 2019 by an actor going by the handle “raccoonstealer.” Like\nmost stealers, it can steal stored auto-fill data, cookies, credentials, credit card data and\nhistory from Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.\nTargeted theft of several cryptocurrency wallets is also supported. Updates often add support\nfor new cryptocurrencies, though it can also be configured to locate any wallet.dat file as\nwell.\n\n\n-----\n\nOriginal advertisement for\n\nRaccoon Stealer (in Russian) in 2019\nSource: ZeroFox Threat Research\nIts focus is on being small, efficient and simple enough for anyone to use. To accomplish\nthis, Raccoon Stealer was created as a service offering, complete with a cloud control panel\nallowing would-be subscribers to configure everything in “just a few clicks.” At just $75 per\nweek or $200 per month, Raccoon Stealer is relatively cheap for threat actors as well.\n\n## Raccoon Stealer Updates Focus on Protecting Payloads\n\nMultiple updates have happened since the start of the quarter, most notable among them\nbeing the addition of new “crypters.” A crypter’s purpose is to obfuscate a given binary by\nusing tactics such as inserting junk code, breaking up the flow of code without changing the\noriginal functionality or encrypting sections of code so static signatures cannot detect them.\nOther updates include support for stealing several new cryptocurrency wallets and adding\nDiscord to the list of targeted applications.\n\nA Raccoon Stealer update\n\nadds support for a new crypter, “NinjaCrypt”\n\nSource: ZeroFox Threat Research\n\n\n-----\n\nOn August 4, 2021, the actor raccoonstealer announced that they were looking to cooperate\nwith other crypter developers and had completed an “automatic system for issuing an\nencrypted build.” This was seemingly in response to subscriber feedback.\n\nActor raccoonstealer\n\nannounces they are seeking out new crypter projects\nSource: ZeroFox Threat Research\nThe actor racoonstealer has also been observed reminding others that “usage without crypt\nis prohibited.”\n\nActor raccoonstealer\n\nreminds a subscriber that crypters must be used against deployed binaries\nSource: ZeroFox Threat Research\nThe recently introduced “Raccoon Clipper” was also updated at the end of July 2021, adding\nsupport for the [Monero and ZCash cryptocurrencies. Racoon Clipper is an add-on developed](https://www.getmonero.org/)\nseparately from the main stealer and works as the name may suggest: monitoring the\nWindows clipboard. Once it detects a supported cryptocurrency address, it will replace it with\none configured by the subscriber in hopes that unsuspecting victims will continue the\ntransaction, unaware that the target address has been changed.\n\nUpdate notes for Raccoon\n\nClipper, a paid add-on to Raccoon Stealer\nSource: ZeroFox Threat Research\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group behind Raccoon Stealer has established itself as a capable group in the two years\nsince they debuted, providing new features regularly and earning a primarily positive\nreputation within the community. They’ve also shown a willingness to add features based on\nthe demands of their subscribers, as demonstrated by the recently created API for\nautomatically generating encrypted builds. With the development of a new API for\nautomatically providing obfuscated or “crypted” builds, new targeted applications and support\nfor more cryptocurrency wallets, this quarter has been an active one for Raccoon Stealer.\n\n## Information Stealer Resources and Recommendations\n\nAs malware attacks continue to increase and the tactics evolve, security teams must act\nquickly. Here are a few recommendations from the ZeroFox Threat Research team:\n\nWhen breaches occur, always change known compromised passwords, as well as\npasswords on critical accounts.\nIf the [initial attack vector is known, ensure that the vulnerabilities leveraged are](https://www.zerofox.com/blog/dark-web-threat-intelligence-access-and-action/)\ncorrected immediately.\nPerform a penetration test to determine weaknesses in the network configuration and\ncorrect the findings as soon as possible.\nEnable 2-factor authentication for all your organizational accounts to help mitigate\nphishing and credential stuffing attacks.\nReview network logs for potential signs of compromise and data egress.\nEnforce administrative or application control restrictions to prevent the unauthorized\ninstallation of software or media.\n\n[The ZeroFox team continues to produce informative resources and engaging events to help](https://www.zerofox.com/resources/)\nsecurity teams and organizations as a whole navigate unknown territory. To learn more about\nthe top threat trends as well as predictions on the tactics and techniques expected to\n[increase, download the latest ZeroFox Quarterly Threat Landscape Report.](https://www.zerofox.com/resources/quarterly-threat-landscape-report-2021-q2/)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
