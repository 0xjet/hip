(Getty Images)\nWritten by [Sean Lyngaas](https://www.cyberscoop.com/author/sean-lyngaas/)\n\nOct 19, 2020 | CYBERSCOOP\nSuspected Russian hackers were behind multiple recent intrusions of U.S. state and local\ncomputer networks, according to an industry analysis obtained by CyberScoop.\n\nThe group responsible is known as TEMP.Isotope, according to a private advisory distributed\nby Mandiant, the incident response arm of security company FireEye. The alert notes that\nthe same group has also been described as Energetic Bear, which multiple security firms\nhave linked to Russia.\n\nThe FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Oct. 9\npublicized a hacking campaign in which attackers breached some “elections support\nsystems,” or IT infrastructure that state and local officials use for a range of functions. Those\n\n\n-----\n\nsystems are not involved in tallying votes, and the advisory from U.S. officials noted that\nthere was no evidence that the “integrity of elections data has been compromised.”\n\nThe federal advisory did not blame a particular hacking group for the activity, saying only that\nthe campaign was the work of advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, or attackers linked to\none or more foreign governments. It was unclear if any other APT groups, from other\ncountries, were implicated in the advisory.\n\nHowever, IP addresses used in the hacking were previously employed by the TEMP.Isotope\n[group, according to Mandiant. The hackers exploited a recently revealed vulnerability in](https://www.cyberscoop.com/microsoft-netlogon-exploit-secura/)\n[a protocol that Microsoft uses to authenticate its users. CISA on Sept. 18 ordered all federal](https://www.cyberscoop.com/cisa-netlogon-microsoft-vulnerability-emergency/)\ncivilian agencies to update their software to address the flaw because of the risk it carried.\n\nThe apparent Russian effort to breach state and local networks so close to the U.S. election\nhas had federal officials and private sector experts focused on investigating and remediating\nthe issue. Election officials were given additional information about the threat as part of a\nregular classified briefing on Friday, according to a CISA spokesperson.\n\n### From broad scanning to software exploits\n\nThe specific motive of the recent TEMP.Isotope activity is unclear. The hackers did not\nappear to be targeting state and local networks “because of their proximity to elections\ninformation,” U.S. officials said in their advisory.\n\nThe activity described by the federal advisory started with broad scanning of vulnerable\nsystems across federal, state and local networks, as well as critical infrastructure in the\nprivate sector, the CISA spokesperson said Monday.\n\n“Once vulnerable systems are identified, the actors attempt to compromise the systems\nusing a combination of techniques,” the CISA statement continued. “While we are aware of\nlimited instances where these efforts resulted in unauthorized access to IT systems used by\nelections officials, we have no evidence or reason to believe that election-related data like\nvoter registration information, or voting machines or tabulation systems, have been affected.”\n\nMandiant’s advisory did not mention the Russian government.\n\n[FireEye itself has described TEMP.Isotope as a “Russian actor” and linked the group directly](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/09/ontology-understand-assess-operational-technology-cyber-incidents.html)\n[to a 2018 U.S. advisorythat blamed the Russian government for cyberattacks.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)\n\nA FireEye spokesperson declined to comment on the advisory.\n\n### A group with a track record\n\nTEMP.Isotope is perhaps best known for its aggressive campaigns to infiltrate energy\ncompanies in the U.S. and Europe. The alleged Russian hackers previously engaged in a\nyears-long effort to breach U S energy firms according to the aforementioned U S\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernment advisory and private sector cybersecurity specialists.\n\nThe cyberdefenses of state and local networks have improved from four years ago, when\nanother set of Russian hackers, allegedly operating on behalf of the GRU military intelligence\nagency, probed IT systems across the country and compromised Illinois’ voter registration\ndatabase.\n\nA spokesperson for the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to a request\nfor comment on the Mandiant advisory. Russia has repeatedly rejected allegations that it\nconducts cyberattacks.\n\n\n-----",
