But\neven new developments in the malware have not produced any notable innovations – until\nrecently. The observed infection rates with Bebloh in the first half of 2013 were\ncomparatively small – with a share of just 6.3% among all banking Trojans observed by G\nData, Bebloh was lagging far behind competitors such as ZeuS. However, an update appeared\nrecently that contains noteworthy changes.\n\n## Large increase in infection count following update\n\nIn recent months we started seeing alarming new figures: Bebloh started steadily climbing up\nthe statistics ladder and secured a place for itself among the top three banking Trojans in\nNovember.\n\nRecently, the malware was distributed as an email attachment, as spam containing fake flight\ninformation. Taken everything into consideration, this was more than reason enough to look\ninto what was going on.\n\nAn initial comparison between a newer example and the familiar version shows that Bebloh\nhas clearly undergone an update. Only about 75% of the functions in the two versions are the\nsame. Almost 4.5% of the functions in the old version have been deleted or replaced. 20.9%\nof the functions are exclusively found in the new version. The functional scope has therefore\nbeen significantly enhanced.\n\n## Malware undergoing change: AV evasion\n\nThe interesting innovation in this variant concerns the persistence, or the issue of: how does\nthe malware survive a restart?\n\nAs soon as the system is infected by Bebloh, the malware is injected into explorer.exe and the\noriginal executable file that contains Bebloh is deleted. In principle this is a perfectly normal\nprocedure for concealing the malware's entry point into the system. However, what is\ninteresting is the fact that the malware is not then moved to another folder and no autostart\nentry is generated. The malware is no longer found on the hard disk. Therefore, a\nconventional signature-based virus scanner would fail to find any infection by scanning the\n\n\n-----\n\nhard disk. As the malware is running hidden in the explorer.exe memory, not even a\nmalicious process is detected. However, to survive a system restart, Bebloh uses an\ninteresting trick.\n\nAn invisible window is generated from the explorer.exe process to receive the “Window\nMessages”, a specific message type generated by Windows.\n\nThis means that windows concerning an impending computer shutdown are also issued by\nWindows.\n\nAs soon as Bebloh receives such a message, the malware writes its executable file out of the\nexplorer.exe memory to the hard disk, and an autostart pointing to the executable is\ngenerated. Hence throughout the time the system is running, there is virtually no visible clue\nin the registry or on the hard disk that suggests an infection.\n\nTo exacerbate the cat-and-mouse game between AV providers and Bebloh even more, the\nautostart entry doesn't directly reference the executable file – it relies on a link (.lnk). In\naddition, the file name used by Bebloh is generated randomly each time, so Bebloh has a\ndifferent name each time the system is started.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe above-mentioned comparison of the program code for the two versions studied proves\nthe hypothesis that Bebloh has not changed much in its basic function as a banking Trojan\nand still tries to spy on user data. However, the AV evasion updates are something new in the\nbanking Trojan arena, demonstrating that malware authors are continuing to find new ways\nto prey on their victims even more silently and effectively.\n\nG Data detects the new variant as Trojan.GenericKD.1367361 using the DoubleScan\ntechnology. G Data BankGuard also detects and removes the new variant of this malware.\n\nOlder Bebloh version, SHA256:\n01af2a82eddbfc4dc4720c8e8a483ff91d3b12df792928a435d1fc618055db46\n\nNewer Bebloh version, SHA256:\nd4f6a12ffe35a8b39e047d35bedb2860e622580df8d66c68abaad4c8d8162c6a\n\n\n-----",
