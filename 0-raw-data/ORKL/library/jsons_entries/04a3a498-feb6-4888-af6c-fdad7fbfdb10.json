We assess it is highly likely that these attacks were\nconducted by a Chinese cyberespionage actor related to the Operation Soft Cell campaign.\n\nThe initial attack phase involves infiltrating Internet-facing Microsoft Exchange servers to\ndeploy webshells used for command execution. Once a foothold is established, the attackers\nconduct a variety of reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement, and data exfiltration\nactivities.\n\nThe deployment of custom credential theft malware is central to this new campaign. The\n[malware implemented a series of Mimikatz modifications on closed-source tooling. This post](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)\ndetails the multi-component architecture and functionality of a sample, referred to as\nmim221.\n\nWe assess that mim221 is a recent version of an actively maintained credential theft\ncapability upgraded with new anti-detection features. The use of special-purpose modules\nthat implement a range of advanced techniques shows the threat actors’ dedication to\nadvancing its toolset towards maximum stealth. These techniques include\n\n\n-----\n\nin-memory mapping of malicious images to evade EDR API hooks and file-based\ndetections\nsurgically terminating Event Log threads instead of the host process to inhibit logging\nwithout raising suspicions\nstaging a credential theft capability in the LSASS process itself by abusing native\nWindows capabilities.\n\nVersion numbers and build timestamps indicate a maintained software project by designated\ndevelopers. Closer analysis reveals an element of pragmatism in that the threat actors use\nmodified publicly available code to achieve their goals.\n\nIn terms of attribution, the tooling suggests an immediate link to the ‘Operation Soft Cell’\n[campaign but remains slightly vague on the specific threat actor. That campaign has been](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers)\npublicly associated with Gallium and possible connections to APT41 have been suggested\nby the use of a common code signing certificate and tooling that shares code similarities.\nAPT41 is also known to target telecommunication providers.\n\nGiven previous target and TTP overlaps, and an evident familiarity with victim environments,\nwe assess with medium-confidence that Gallium is involved. However, we also recognize the\npossibility of closed-source tool-sharing between Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, and\nthe possibility of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster.\n\nRegardless of clustering specifics, this finding highlights the increased operational tempo of\nChinese cyberespionage actors and their consistent investment in advancing their malware\narsenal to evade detection.\n\n## Infection Vector and Initial TTPs\n\nAs initial attack indicators, we observed command execution through webshells on\ncompromised Microsoft Exchange server deployments. The threat actors used C:\\MS_DATA\nas their main working directory for storing malware and staging data for exfiltration. Noting\nthat the Microsoft [TroubleShootingScript toolset (TSSv2) uses C:\\MS_DATA for](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/windows-troubleshooters/introduction-to-troubleshootingscript-toolset-tssv2) [storing log](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/deployment/troubleshoot-windows-server-update-guidance)\nfiles, we suspect that its use as a working directory is an attempt to make malicious file\nsystem activities look legitimate.\n\nAfter establishing an initial foothold, the threat actor conducts reconnaissance like querying\nuser and network information using a variety of tools. For example, the attackers used\n[dsquery and](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc754232(v=ws.11)) [query to obtain information about Active Directory objects, including user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/query-user)\n[information, and Remote Desktop user sessions. They also used the Local Group (LG) tool](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/lg/index.htm)\nto [enumerate all local groups and members in a domain.](https://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/lg/usage.htm)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n  cmd  /c cd /d C:\\MS_DATA\\&dsquery limit 0 filter\n\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d C:\\MS_DATA\\&dsquery * -limit 0 -filter \"&(objectClass=User)\n(objectCategory=Person)\" -attr objectSID sAMAccountName displayName mail memberOf\n>da.back&cd\n\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\&query user&cd\n\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d C:\\MS_DATA\\&lg.exe \\\\[IP ADDRESS] -lu >169.txt&cd\n\n```\nThe attackers then check connectivity with both the Internet and specific local machines of\ninterest.\n```\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\&ping 8.8.8.8 -n 1&cd\n\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\&ping -n 1 [IP ADDRESS/HOSTNAME]&cd\n\n\n```\nThey also retrieve networking information, like network adapters, specific machines, and\nnetwork services like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).\n```\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d C:\\MS_DATA\\&ipconfig /all&cd\n\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\&net use&cd\n\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\&netstat.exe -nob\n\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\&netstat -aon |find \"3389\"&cd\n\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d C:\\MS_DATA\\&netstat -aon |find \"[IP ADDRESS]\"&cd\n\n\n```\n[The threat actor made use of the native makecab tool to compress information gathered for](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/makecab)\nexfiltration.\n```\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d C:\\MS_DATA\\&makecab da.back d.zip >1.txt&cd\n\n\n```\n[For lateral movement, the attackers made use of the PsExec tool and the net use command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)\nfor accessing shared resources on remote machines.\n```\n  \"cmd\" /c cd /d C:\\MS_DATA\\&net use \\\\[IP ADDRESS] [PASSWORD] /u:[DOMAIN]\\\n[USERNAME]\n\n\n### A Penchant for Credential Theft\n\n```\n[In order to steal credentials, the attackers employ custom modified versions of Mimikatz,](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)\nincluding an executable named pc.exe.\n\nMimikatz publicly\n\navailable code (top); strings from a Mimikatz modification (bottom)\nThe pc.exe executable stages the execution of three other components that ultimately result\nin stealing credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)\nprocess.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe refer to the four component chain as mim221 based on the version number that the tool\ndisplays (2.2.1).\n\nWe observed the threat actors deploying individual chunks of pc.exe in the working directory\nand merging these into pc.exe using the type command.\n\n_pc.exe file chunks_\n\nWe noticed that the attackers ceased their activities after stealing credentials. This could\nindicate a multi-phase attack strategy, where the deployment of backdoors and further\npersistence mechanisms is carried out separately after credential theft has ensured\ncontinued access. The intrusions were detected and interrupted before the attackers could\ncarry out further phases, such as deploying backdoors.\n\n## mim221\n\nThe architecture of mim221 consists of four components: the pc.exe Windows executable,\nand the AddSecurityPackage64.dll, pc.dll, and getHashFlsa64.dll DLLs contained\ntherein.\n\n\n-----\n\nmim221 execution overview\n\n**mim221 Component** **Size** **Compilation timestamp**\n\npc.exe 502 KBs Thu Jun 09 08:02:12 2022 (UTC)\n\nAddSecurityPackage64.dll 119 KB Thu Jun 09 08:01:46 2022 (UTC)\n\npc.dll 297 KB Tue Jun 07 16:55:05 2022 (UTC)\n\n\n-----\n\ngetHashFlsa64.dll 216 KB Fri May 27 20:56:26 2022 (UTC)\n\n### pc.exe\n\nThe main binary executed by the threat actor is pc.exe. It decrypts\n```\nAddSecurityPackage64.dll and pc.dll, stores pc.dll on the file system, and then loads\n\n```\nand executes AddSecurityPackage64.dll by invoking its exported function,\n```\npathAddPackage.\n\n```\nThe execution of pc.exe requires a password supplied by the operator (in this case,\n```\n[email protected]#$C), which the operator provides through the key command-line\n\n```\nparameter.\n```\npc.exe decrypts AddSecurityPackage64.dll and pc.dll using the AES encryption\n\n```\nalgorithm, providing the operator-provided execution password as an initialization vector.\n```\npc.exe loads and executes the decrypted AddSecurityPackage64.dllusing reflective image\n\n```\nloading. This technique involves first mapping a Windows PE image in memory and then\nexecuting the image’s main entry point or an export function.\n\nAmong other activities, the image mapping process includes allocating memory for the\nimage, storing the image headers and sections in the memory, populating the images’ import\nand delay import tables, adding exception handlers, and executing TLS callback and export\n[routines. The Phant0m tool provides a complete implementation of this process.](https://github.com/hlldz/Phant0m/blob/master/phant0m/phant0m-rdll/ReflectiveLoader.c)\n\nWhile reflective image loading is a known technique at this time, its use was first observed in\nthe [DoublePulsar and subsequently the SlingShot frameworks in 2017 and 2018,](https://blog.f-secure.com/doublepulsar-usermode-analysis-generic-reflective-dll-loader/)\nrespectively. This technique enables the fully fileless loading and execution of a malicious\nimage without invoking the standard Windows API, such as LoadLibrary. This eliminates\ndetection based on API hooking and file artifacts.\n\nWhen it is finished executing, pc.exe displays a message indicating a version number and\nbuild timestamp: Version 2.2.1 - build on Jun 9 2022 16:02:12.\n\n### AddSecurityPackage64.dll\n```\nAddSecurityPackage64.dll, which is the original filename of this mim221 component, is\n\n```\nresponsible for:\n\nObtaining the SeDebugPrivilege and SYSTEM privilege by access token impersonation.\nThis allows mim221 to inspect and extract credentials from the LSASS process.\nDisabling Windows event logging in an attempt to evade detection; and\n\n\n-----\n\nInjecting pc.dll into LSASS as a [Security Package. Security Packages are used to](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/how-attackers-exploit-security-support-provider-ssp-for-credential-dumping/)\nextend the Windows authentication mechanism and can be abused to execute\nmalicious code in the context of LSASS.\n\nIn an attempt to remain undetected, AddSecurityPackage64.dll disables Windows event\nlogging by killing threads of the Windows Event Log service without stopping the execution\nof the service itself. This is achieved by locating the process that hosts the Event Log,\nenumerating the processes’ threads, identifying the threads assigned to the service by their\nservice tag (eventlog), and terminating them.\n\nQuerying service tag information\n```\nAddSecurityPackage64.dll injects pc.dll into LSASS by deploying pc.dll as a Security\n\n```\nPackage. To this end, AddSecurityPackage64.dll issues an RPC call to LSASS – to the\n```\nncalrpc:[lsasspirpc] RPC endpoint, providing the file path to pc.dll to LSASS. This call\n\n```\ninstructs LSASS to load and execute pc.dll, which then stages the getHashFlsa64.dll\ncredential theft component.\n\n_getHashFlsa64.dll conducts credential theft in the context of LSASS_\n\n### pc.dll and getHashFlsa64.dll\n\nIn the context LSASS, pc.dll decrypts, reflectively loads, and executes the code credential\ntheft component getHashFlsa64.dll in a manner similar to pc.exe. pc.dll and\n```\ngetHashFlsa64.dll share the same original filename: getHashFlsa64.dll.\npc.dll is implemented such that its main routine returns FALSE, making LSASS execute\npc.dll and then unload it. This is a detection evasion technique making LSASS load pc.dll\n\n```\nwhile avoiding appearing as an added (registered) Security Package. LSASS normally\ncreates registry entries when adding Security Packages and does not unload them once\nloaded. This provides an opportunity for defenders to detect the loading of malicious Security\n[Packages. Previous research provides more detail on this topic.](https://blog.xpnsec.com/exploring-mimikatz-part-2/)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ngetHashFlsa64.dll accesses the memory of its host LSASS process and stores stolen\n\n```\ncredentials in a Mimikatz log file named pc.log for later exfiltration.\n\nExample pc.log content\n```\ngetHashFlsa64.dll exports a function named GetMyVersion, which displays a version\n\n```\nnumber and build timestamp (Version 2.2.0 - build on May 28 2022 04:56:23), in a\nformat consistent with the output from pc.exe. The credential theft functionality of\n```\ngetHashFlsa64.dll is implemented in its export function GetLogonInfo.\n\n```\nThe GetMyVersion\n\nfunction\n\n### Additional Information\n\n**Error Messages and Public Code Reuse**\n\nThe mim221 components implement error logging. The error messages follow a consistent\noutput format.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample error messages\nIt is important to note that we observed code segments that seem to be modified versions of\npublicly available code. For example, the implementation of AddSecurityPackage64.dll\nlooks like an adaptation of public code that demonstrates injection of a Security Package into\nLSASS using RPC calls.\n\n[Similarity between publicly](https://gist.github.com/xpn/c7f6d15bf15750eae3ec349e7ec2380e)\n\navailable code (top) and AddSecurityPackage64.dll (bottom)\n\n**Timestamp Information**\n\nThe mim221 components that reflectively load other executables, pc.exe and pc.dll, patch\nbeforehand a string in the loaded executable, which provides further timestamp information:\n```\n[email protected]#0-2022-05-23 16:33:03S. The patching involves replacing the string\n\n```\nwith configuration information, such as the mim221 execution password and a path to the log\nfile for storing stolen credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nPatched timestamp string\n\n## Attribution Analysis\n\nWe assess it is highly likely the initial attack phases we observed were conducted by\nChinese threat actors with cyberespionage motivations. Telecommunication providers are\nfrequent targets of espionage activity due to the sensitive data they hold. Our analysis\n[identified indicators that point to the operation Soft Cell actors.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers)\n\n[Operation Soft Cell has been associated with the Gallium group based on TTPs and some of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-warns-of-gallium-threat-group-attacking-global-telcos/)\nthe [domains the group has been using.](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/1143557496906424320?s=19)\n\n[Active since at least 2012, Gallium is likely a Chinese state-sponsored group that is targeting](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0093/)\ntelecommunication, financial, and government entities in Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa, and\nthe Middle East. While the group’s original focus has been on telecommunication providers,\n[recent reports suggest that Gallium has recently expanded targeting across other sectors.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pingpull-gallium/)\n\nThe initial intrusion vector and the majority of the TTPs we observed closely match those\nconducted by, or [associated with, the Soft Cell actors. This includes deploying webshells at](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/deadringer-exposing-chinese-threat-actors-targeting-major-telcos)\nMicrosoft Exchange servers for establishing an initial foothold, following same file naming\n[conventions, using the LG tool and the net, query, and tasklist Windows built-in tools for](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/lg/index.htm)\n[gathering user and process information, and the PsExec Windows Sysinternals tool and net](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/)\nfor lateral movement and exploration, respectively.\n\nIt is worth noting that the attackers’ activities at one of the targets suggested previous\nknowledge of the environment. We had observed activity at the same target a few months\nprior, which we attributed to Gallium primarily based on the use of the group’s [PingPull](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pingpull-gallium/)\nbackdoor and TTPs.\n\nBy pivoting on the original filename of mim221’s getHashFlsa64.dll, we observed [another](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/17dce65529069529bcb5ced04721d641bf6d7a7ac61d43aaf1bca2f6e08ead56/details)\nsample that steals credentials from LSASS. This sample has the PDB path of\n```\ne:\\vs_proj\\mimkTools\\getHashFlsa\\getHashFlsa\\x64\\release\\getHashFlsa64.pdb and\n\n```\nhas been first submitted to VirusTotal from Vietnam on January 04, 2023.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The path partially overlaps with the PDB path of a Mimikatz Soft Cell executable](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/65ea5f7750f44d98f1077397b906b2611781579a2ae6def44a4de5b41265a9b9)\n(E:\\vs_proj\\simplify_modify\\Win32\\simplify.pdb) and another Mimikatz executable of\n[a Chinese threat actor thought to be part of the Soft Cell activity group arsenal](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/deadringer-exposing-chinese-threat-actors-targeting-major-telcos)\n(E:\\vs_proj\\mimkTools\\dcsync_new\\x64\\dcsync64.pdb). This indicates that mim221 and\nthese binaries may originate from the same source.\n\nCloser analysis confirms that the sample we pivoted to is a previous, less-advanced version\nof mim221 – Version 2.2.0 – that does not include some mim221 components, such as\n```\nAddSecurityPackage64.dll and pc.dll. We refer to this sample as mim220.\n\n```\nOutput from mim220\n\n(top) and mim221 (bottom)\n[Previous research indicates possible connections between the Soft Cell actors and APT41,](https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf)\nwhich is known to conduct Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity as well as financially\n[motivated activity targeting multiple sectors with a broad geographical coverage, including](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/apt-41-group)\n[telecommunication providers.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits)\n\nThe connection between the Soft Cell actors and APT41 that most relates to the activities\nthat we observed is based on the Whizzimo, LLC certificate of the Soft Cell binary with a\nPDB path E:\\vs_proj\\simplify_modify\\Win32\\simplify.pdb, a binary that possibly\noriginates from the same source as mim221. This certificate has been reported to be used by\nAPT41. Pivoting on this certificate reveals further Mimikatz modifications, some with\nfilenames very similar to those we observed.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n[Chinese cyberespionage threat actors are known to have a strategic interest in the Middle](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/unc215-chinese-espionage-campaign-in-israel)\nEast. This is evident from their consistent targeted attacks on various entities including\ngovernment, finance, entertainment, and telecommunication organizations. The recent\nactivities targeting the telecommunication sector this post discusses are some of the latest\nsuch attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nOur analysis of mim221 highlights the continuous maintenance and further development of\nthe Chinese espionage malware arsenal. These threat actors will almost certainly continue\nexploring and upgrading their tools with new techniques for evading detection, including\nintegrating and modifying publicly available code.\n\nSentinelLabs continues to monitor espionage activities and hopes that defenders will\nleverage the findings presented in this post to bolster their defenses.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA1** **Note**\n\nf54a41145b732d47d4a2b0a1c6e811ddcba48558 pc.exe\n\n1c405ba0dd99d9333173a8b44a98c6d029db8178 AddSecurityPackage64.dll\n(unpatched)\n\ndf4bd177b40dd66f3efb8d6ea39459648ffd5c0e AddSecurityPackage64.dll (patched)\n\n814f980877649bc67107d9e27e36fba677cad4e3 pc.dll\n\n508408edda49359247edc7008762079c5ba725d9 getHashFlsa64.dll (unpatched)\n\n97a7f1a36294e5525310f121e1b98e364a22e64d getHashFlsa64.dll (patched)\n\n\n-----",
