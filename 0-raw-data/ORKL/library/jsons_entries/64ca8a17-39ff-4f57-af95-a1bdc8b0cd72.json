InPage is a word processor program that supports languages such as Urdu,\nPersian, Pashto, and Arabic. The three InPage exploit files are linked through their use\nof very similar shellcode, which suggests that either the same actor is behind these\nattacks, or the attackers have access to a shared builder. The documents were found to\ndrop the following malware families:\n\nThe [previously discussed CONFUCIUS_B malware family](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/09/unit42-confucius-says-malware-families-get-further-by-abusing-legitimate-websites/)\nA backdoor previously not discussed in the public domain, commonly detected by\nsome antivirus solutions as “BioData”\nA previously unknown backdoor that we have named MY24\n\nThe use of InPage as an attack vector is not commonly seen, with the only previously\nnoted attacks being documented by [Kaspersky in late 2016.](https://securelist.com/inpage-zero-day-exploit-used-to-attack-financial-institutions-in-asia/76717/)\n\nThe decoy documents used by the InPage exploits suggest that the targets are likely to\nbe politically or militarily motivated. They contained subjects such as intelligence reports\nand political situations related to India, the Kashmir region, or terrorism being used as\nlure documents.\n\nIn the blog below, we analyze and present our findings on three of these malicious\nInPage documents:\n\nWe also include analysis of the new backdoor we discovered: MY24.\n\nCyber Advisory No 91.inp\n\nWe discovered the first InPage exploit to have the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 1d1e7a6175e6c514aaeca8a43dabefa017ddc5b166c‐\ncb636789b6a767181a022\n\n\n**Original**\n**Filename**\n\n\nCyber Advisory No 91.inp\n\n\nThe exploit for this document is the same one described by described by Kaspersky late\nlast year. This exploit was unsuccessful in the latest version in InPage (Version 3.60),\nand as such the underlying vulnerability has likely been patched.\n\nOverall, the entire execution flow of this malware from start to finish can be summarized\nas follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 InPage exploit document execution flow_\n\nWhen the malicious .INP file is opened using a vulnerable version of InPage, it will\nexecute the shellcode that is embedded within it.\n\nThis particular shellcode, along with the shellcode found within another InPage exploit\ndocument that will be discussed later on, began with a marker of ‘LuNdLuNd’, followed\nby a series of NOPs. It continues to identify an offset to an embedded executable file,\nwhich will eventually be run on the victim machine.\n\nThis particular shellcode uses a unique hashing mechanism for identifying and loading\nMicrosoft Windows libraries and functions. It uses this method to load a series of\nfunctions, as seen below:\n\n_Figure 2 Shellcode loading functions using custom hashing algorithm_\n\nThe hashing algorithm in question can be represented in Python as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\n\ndef hashAlgo(string):\nhsh = 0\nfor c in string:\nv1 = ord(c) | 0x60\nhsh = 2 * (hsh + v1)\nreturn hsh\nlibrary = \"ntdll.dll\"\nfunction = \"memcpy\"\nprint \"[+] '{}' Library: 0x{:x}\".format(library, hashAlgo(library))\nprint \"[+] '{}' Function: 0x{:x}\".format(function, hashAlgo(function))\nOutput:\n\n[+] 'ntdll.dll' Library: 0x1b708\n\n[+] 'memcpy' Function: 0x347a\n\n\nThis particular hashing algorithm does not appear to be widely used, however, in our\nsearches using the YARA rule provided at the end of this blog, we were able to identify\nroughly 70 PE32 samples that have recently employed this same hashing technique.\n\nThe shellcode then proceeds to attempt to create a mutex with a value of\n“QPONMLKJIH” to ensure only one instance of the shellcode is running at a given time.\nFinally, the shellcode will copy the embedded payload into newly allocated memory\nbefore executing it.\n\nThis newly dropped payload is a DLL with the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 7bbf14ced3ca490179d3727b7287e‐\nb581c3a730131331be042d0f0510bc804f9\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2015-05-08 12:51:54 UTC\n\n\n**PDB String** c:\\users\\mz\\documents\\visual studio\n2013\\Projects\\Shellcode\\Release\\Shellcode.pdb\n\nThis particular DLL acts as a dropper, and has two embedded resource files—an\nexecutable payload that will be used to ultimately drop the final payload, as well as a\ndecoy InPage file. It begins by spawning a new thread that loads the two files from\nembedded resources with names of ‘BIN’ and ‘BIN2’ respectively. The executable is\ndropped to the following path before it is executed:\n\n%TEMP%\\winopen.exe\n\nThe InPage decoy document is dropped to the following path before it is run:\n\n%TEMP\\SAMPLE.INP\n\nThe decoy document in question looks like the following. The rough translation to\nEnglish has been provided in red:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Decoy InPage file with rough translation_\n\nBased on the rough translation of this document, it appears to deal with current issues\nwithin the Kashmir region. This of course is not consistent with the original filename, and\nit is unclear why this is the case. Perhaps the attacker forgot to change the lure from a\nprevious exploit, or simply didn’t find it necessary. This lure, while inconsistent with the\noriginal filename, is in line with the other InPage exploit file that also looked to be of the\nsame subject matter.\n\nThe executable file in the ‘%TEMP%\\winopen.exe’ path has the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 692815d06b720669585a71bc8151b89ca6748f882b35e365e08c‐\nfaf6eda77049\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2017-07-31 06:03:42 UTC\n\n\nThis particular executable is made to resemble the legitimate application Putty. Unlike\nother files we witnessed up to this point, this sample has rudimentary anti-debugging\nand anti-analysis techniques in place prior to the main execution flow.\n\nIt proceeds to decrypt an embedded resource object using the RC4 algorithm. The\nfollowing key is used for decryption:\n\nVACqItywGR1v3qGxVZQPYXxMZV0o2fzp\n\nAfter this data is decrypted, the following registry key is written to ensure persistence.\nAgain, we see the malware mimic the appearance of the legitimate Putty application.\n\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\Putty –\n%TEMP%\\winopen.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, the malware will spawn a new suspended instance of itself, where the decrypted\ndata is written and subsequently executed.\n\nThis next stage of malware has the following properties:\n\n**SHA256** bb5540fe0bbc0c‐\nda08865aad891a585cd465b224bfe84762216cd04178087516\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2017-05-17 05:47:05 UTC\n\n\nThis malware operates almost identical to the previously witnessed sample. However,\nthis time the embedded resource object is decrypted using the following RC4 key:\n\nkRPAnN2DN6vfrxsJ55Lntnh7Mma8E68s\n\nThe next, and last stage of this malware execution has the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** d1a14bc3160f5ed6232ceaf40de1959d7d‐\nba3eae614efd2882b04d538cda825b\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2016-10-31 02:41:09 UTC\n\n\nThis final payload is an instance of the CONFUCIUS_B malware family, which we have\npreviously discussed. This particular sample attempts to connect to the following host for\nC2 operations:\n\n151.80.14[.]194\n\nIntelligence Report-561 (1).inp\n\nWe identified this malicious InPage document as having the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 35c5f6030513f11fd1dcf9bd232de457ba7f3af3aed‐\nc0e2e976895b296a09df6\n\n\n**Original**\n**Filename**\n\n\nIntelligence Report-561 (1).inp\n\n\nThis particular exploit file uses the exact same shellcode witnessed previously, where an\nembedded DLL is loaded into memory. Again, this executable drops and executes two\nfiles—a Microsoft Windows executable payload and an InPage decoy document.\n\nThe embedded payload within the shellcode has the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 83e3b2938ee6a3e354c93c6ec756da96b03c‐\nc69118b5748b07aee4d900da1844\n\n\n-----\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2015-05-08 12:51:54 UTC\n\n\n**PDB String** c:\\users\\mz\\documents\\visual studio\n2013\\Projects\\Shellcode\\Release\\Shellcode.pdb\n\nAgain, we see the executable payload and decoy document dropped to the following\nrespective locations:\n\n%TEMP%\\winopen.exe\n%TEMP%\\SAMPLE.inp\n\nThe dropped executable is a previously undocumented backdoor written in Delphi that\nhas been named BioData by multiple antivirus organizations.\n\nThis InPage exploit document follows a much simpler execution flow, as seen in the\nfollowing diagram.\n\n_Figure 4 InPage exploit execution flow_\n\nThe decoy InPage file dropped by this malware looks like the following. The language\nused within it appears to be a mix of Arabic and Urdu. A rough translation has been\nprovided in red in the image below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 Decoy InPage document dropped by malware_\n\nThe Biodata payload has the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 5716509e4cdbf8ffa5f‐\nbce02b8881320cb852d98e590215455986a5604a453f7\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n1992-06-19 22:22:17 UTC\n\n\nNote that the timestamp above is the result of this sample being compiled in Delphi,\nwhich uses the same hardcoded compilation timestamp for all samples that are\ngenerated.\n\nThroughout the execution of this sample, numerous strings are decoded using a\ncustomized 94-character substitution table. BioData will go through each character of the\nobfuscated string, and will replace each character based on the following table:\n\n_Figure 6 Substitution table used by BioData_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware proceeds to generate and create a ‘Document’ folder within the\n%USERPROFILE% directory. This folder will contain all of the malware’s files throughout\nits execution. In order to maintain persistence, the malware will generate the following\nfile in the startup folder, which points to the current path of the BioData executable:\n\nAdobe creative suit.lnk\n\nBioData proceeds to generate a randomized 30-character string of uppercase and\nlowercase letters. This string is written to the following file:\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Document\\users.txt\n\nThis 30-character string is used by the malware to act as a unique identifier for the\nvictim, and will be used for all network communication with a remote server.\n\nThe username and computer name are identified, and are written to a string of the\nfollowing format:\n\nUser name and System Name :- [Username]_[Computer Name]\n\nThis data is obfuscated and written to the following file:\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Document\\SyLog.log\n\nIn order to obfuscate this data, the malware uses a unique algorithm. Represented in\nPython, the following script will decode this file:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n\nimport sys\nfrom binascii import *\nfile = sys.argv[1]\nfh = open(file, 'rb')\nfd = fh.read()\nfh.close()\ndef bit_not(n, numbits=8):\nreturn (1 << numbits) - 1 - n\ndef decode(data):\nc = 0\noutput = \"\"\nfor d in data:\no = bit_not((0x6121 >> c) & 0xFF)\noutput += chr(ord(d) ^ o)\nc += 1\nif c == 32:\nc = 0\nreturn output\nprint decode(fd)\n\n\nBioData sends both GET and POST requests to the following URL:\n\nhttp://errorfeedback[.]com/MarkQuality455/developerbuild.php\n\nPOST requests are made with a hardcoded User-Agent, shown below in Figure 7.\nAdditionally, a ‘b’ GET parameter is included that contains the victim’s previously\ngenerated unique identifier. The contents of the POST requests are the obfuscated\n\n\n-----\n\nSyLog.log file. The remote C2 server has been observed responding to these requests\nwith ‘Success’. These requests simply act as a beacon, including the basic victim\ninformation that was previously obtained.\n\n_Figure 7 HTTP POST request by BioData_\n\nGET requests are made in a slightly different fashion. These requests contain an empty\nUser-Agent, and are also found to be missing a number of HTTP headers that are\ncommonly seen.\n\n_Figure 8 HTTP GET request by BioData_\n\nUnlike the POST requests, the malware both looks for and makes use of the response\ngiven, if any, by the C2 server. The malware parses any response given by first hexdecoding it. It then base64-decodes the resulting string. The final string is used to form a\nsubsequent GET request.\n\nIf for instance, the malware responded with a decoded string of ‘malware.exe’, the\nsubsequent GET request would look like the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nhttp://errorfeedback[.]com/MarkQuality455/bzGwXILtkMRZaJxzciXAeCYviduBuy/malware.exe\n\nThe request above uses the same victim identifier that has been observed in the\nprevious examples provided.\n\nThis hypothetical ‘malware.exe’ request contains the raw contents of the payload that\nBioData will drop to disk and execute. The contents are placed in the following file path\nfor this hypothetical:\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Document\\malware.exe\n\nFinally, after this dropped payload is successfully executed, the malware will send a GET\nrequest such as the following:\n\nhttp://errorfeedback[.]com/MarkQuality455/developerbuild.php?\nf=62574673643246795a53356c654755&b=bzGwXILtkMRZaJxzciXAeCYviduBuy\n\nIn the above example, the ‘b’ parameter is the victim identifier, and the ‘f’ parameter is\nthe string of ‘malware.exe’ after it has been base64-encoded and hex-encoded. This\nrequest alerts the attack that the hypothetical payload of ‘malware.exe’ has been run.\n\nTehreek-E-Kashmir Mujahaid List.inp\n\nWe identified this malicious InPage document as having the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 3e410397955d5a127182d69e019dbc8bbf‐\nfeee864cd9c96e577c9c13f05a232f\n\n\n**Original**\n**Filename**\n\n\nTehreek-E-Kashmir Mujahaid List.inp\n\n\nUnfortunately, no decoy document was included with this exploit file. However, the\nfilename provides clues as to the context that may have been present when this file was\ndelivered to the intended recipient. The phrase ‘Tehreek-E-Kashmir’ is most likely related\nto the conflict in the Kashmir region of India. Additionally, the term ‘Mujahaid’ may be a\nmisspelling of the word ‘Mujahid’, a term used to describe an individual engaged in\nJihad.\n\nThis particular InPage shellcode looks to be near identical to the two others previously\ndiscussed, however, it appears as though the attackers simply partially overwrote the\noriginal shellcode that was present to substitute their own. This results in the shellcode\nacting as a downloader, instead of loading an embedded payload. We can see the\nmodifications visually in the following image:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 Differences between InPage exploit documents_\n\nIn the image above, the ‘Cyber Advisory No 91.inp’ exploit file has the large additional\nsize, as it included the payload. The ‘Tehreek-E-Kashmir Mujahaid List.inp’ exploit file\ninstead has removed this. However, original artifacts from the original shellcode are still\npresent, including the function that loads Microsoft Windows API calls using the unique\nhashing algorithm.\n\nThe shellcode begins by iterating through the Process Environment Block (PEB),\nsearching for a loaded module that has a ‘3’ in the 7 position. In other words, theth\nshellcode uses a simple trick to search for kernel32.dll. It proceeds to iterate through\nkernel32’s functions, looking for the GetProcAddress function. In order to find this\nfunction it will compare the first four letters against ‘GetP’, and the third set of four letters\nagainst ‘ddre’.\n\nThe shellcode then gets the address of the WinExec function, which in turn is used to\nexecute the following command:\n\ncmd /c mkdir C:\\Wins\n\nIt then performs the following:\n\n1. Gets the address of the LoadLibraryA function\n2. Loads the urlmon.dll library\n3. Gets the address of the URLDownloadToFileA function\n\n\n-----\n\nThe shellcode then proceeds to make a request to the following URL and download the\nresponse to ‘C:\\Wins\\cnh’.\n\nhttp://zmwardrobe[.]com/wp-sign\n\nFinally, the shellcode will execute this downloaded file via a call to WinExec.\n\nThe response from this webserver returned a payload, that we have named MY24, with\nthe following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 71b7de2e3a60803df1c3fdc46af4fd8cfb7c803a53c9a85f7311348f6f‐\nf88cbe\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2017-05-18 05:26:54 UTC\n\n\nIt should also be noted that a malicious Microsoft Word document with the following\nproperties was observed downloading and executing the same payload.\n\n**SHA256** 3f1d3d02e7707b2bc686b5add875e1258c65a0‐\nfacd5cf8910ba0f321e230e17c\n\n\n**Original**\n**Filename**\n\n\nLas Vegas ISIS Claim Proof.doc\n\n\n**First Seen** 2017-10-05 05:53:27\n\n**MY24 Analysis**\n\nThis backdoor begins by decoding a series of embedded strings by adding 33 to each\ncharacter. The following example within the Python interpreter demonstrates this:\n\n_Figure 10 Example string decoding within Python interpreter_\n\nThe malware proceeds to execute a function that is responsible for generating the\nfollowing path:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Startup\\wintasks.exe\n\nHowever, this path is never used, leading us to believe that the malware author had the\nintention of copying the payload to this destination and likely setting persistence, but\nseemingly forgot to.\n\n\n-----\n\nMY24 proceeds to spawn two timers where the functions are responsible for resolving\nthe C2 domain of userveblog.ddns[.]net, as well as connecting to this domain.\n\nTwo new threads are then created—one for handling any data that is received from the\nconnection to the C2 and one that is responsible for sending out data.\n\nFinally, a function is called that is responsible for collecting information about the victim\nmachine. The following information is collected:\n\nVersion of Microsoft Windows\nUsername\nComputer name\n\nThe MY24 instance expects to receive a command initially from the remote server of\nuserveblog.ddns[.]net on port 9832. All communication is performed using raw sockets\nvia a custom communication protocol. The packets received by the malware have the\nfollowing format:\n\n_Figure 11 Received packet format for MY24 malware_\n\nAll data received and sent by MY24 is encrypted using a 13-byte XOR key of\n“t6%9k$2Ri9ctv”. The data portion of the received command will include one of the\nfollowing commands:\n\n\n**Received**\n**Command**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n2000 Return victim information\n\n2001 Get drive information\n\n2002 List files\n\n2004 Unknown\n\n2005 Create file handle to append data\n\n2006 Write appended data to previously created file handle\n\n2007 Create file handle for reading data\n\n2009 Read data from previously created file handle\n\n2012 Spawn a shell of cmd.exe\n\n2013 Interact with previously spawned shell\n\n2015 Unknown\n\n2016 Kill previously spawned shell\n\n\n-----\n\n2019 List current process network communication on the victim\nmachine\n\n2021 Unknown\n\n2022 Kill process\n\n2023 Enumerate processes\n\n2025 Unknown\n\nResponses sometimes vary in size, but are primarily sent with a size of 9084 bytes. The\nauthor of this tool did not allocate proper buffer size when sending out the data, resulting\nin part of the stack being included in the response by the MY24 malware. Examples of\ncommands being sent and received may be seen below. A custom server was written to\ninteract with the MY24 malware, which is seen in the following image.\n\n_Figure 12 Interacting with MY24 backdoor_\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWhile documents designed to exploit the InPage software are rare, they are not new –\nhowever in recent weeks Unit42 has observed numerous InPage exploits leveraging\nsimilar shellcode, suggesting continued use of the exploit previously discussed by\nKaspersky.\n\nThe decoy documents dropped suggest that the targets are likely to be politically or\nmilitarily motivated, with subjects such as Intelligence reports and political situations\nbeing used as lure documents. The variety of malware payloads dropped suggests the\nattackers behind these attacks have a reasonable development resource behind them\nand Unit42 continues to observe new versions of these malware families being created.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against these threats in a number of ways:\n\nAll domains observed in these malware families have been flagged as malicious.\nAll payloads are appropriately categorized as malicious within the WildFire\nplatform and blocked by Traps.\nThe payloads witnessed have been tagged in AutoFocus as [Confucius_B,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Confucius_B) [MY24,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.MY24)\nand [BioData for continued tracking and observation.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.BioData)\n\n\n-----\n\nAppendix\n\n**YARA Rules**\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\nrule InPageShellcodeHashing\n{\nstrings:\n$hashingFunction = {55 8B EC 51 53 52 33 C9 33 DB 33 D2 8B 45 08 8A 10 80 CA\n60 03 DA D1 E3 03 45 10 8A 08 84 C9 E0 EE 33 C0 8B 4D 0C 3B D9 74 01 40 5A 5B\n59 8B E5 5D C2 0C 00}\ncondition:\n$hashingFunction\n}\n\n\n-----",
