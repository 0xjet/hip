Although ATM fraud is a very peculiar sort of work, some cybercriminals spend a lot\nof effort to automate it. In March 2018, we came across a fairly simple but effective piece of\nmalware named WinPot. It was created to make ATMs by a popular ATM vendor to\nautomatically dispense all cash from their most valuable cassettes. We called it ATMPot.\n\nExample of WinPot interface – dispensing in action\n\n\n-----\n\nThe criminals had clearly spent some time on the interface to make it look like that of a slot\nmachine. Likely as a reference to the popular term ATM-jackpotting, which refers to\ntechniques designed to empty ATMs. In the WinPot case, each cassette has a reel of its own\nnumbered 1 to 4 (4 is the max number of cash-out cassettes in an ATM) and a button labeled\nSPIN. As soon as you press the SPIN button (in our case it is greyed out because we are\nactually dispensing cash), the ATM starts dispensing cash from the corresponding cassette.\nDown from the SPIN button there is information about the cassette (bank note value and the\nnumber of bank notes in the cassette). The SCAN button rescans the ATM and updates the\nnumbers under the SLOT button, while the STOP button stops the dispensing in progress.\n\nWe found WinPot to be an amusing and interesting ATM malware family, so we decided to\nkeep a close eye on it.\n\nOver the course of time, new samples popped up, each one with minor modifications. For\nexample, a changed packer (like Yoda and UPX) or updated time period during which the\nmalware was programmed to work (e.g, during March). If system time does not fall in with\nthe preset period, WinPot silently stops operating without showing its interface.\n\n[The number of samples we had found was also reflected in the European Fraud Update](https://www.association-secure-transactions.eu/east-publishes-fraud-update-2-2018/)\npublished in the summer of 2018. It has a few lines about WinPot:\n\n_“ATM malware and logical security attacks were reported by nine countries. Five of the_\n_countries reported ATM related malware. In addition to Cutlet Maker (used for ATM_\n_cash-out) a new variant called WinPot has been reported…”_\n\nSame as Cutler Maker, WinPot is available on the (Dark)net for approximately 500 – 1000\nUSD depending on offer.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the sellers offers WinPot v.3 together with a demo video depicting the “new” malware\nversion along with a still unidentified program with the caption “ShowMeMoney”. Its looks\n[and mechanics seem quite similar to those of the Stimulator from the CutletMaker story.](https://securelist.com/atm-malware-is-being-sold-on-darknet-market/81871/)\n\nUnidentified Stimulator-like sample from demo video\n\n\n-----\n\nWinpot v3 sample from demo video\n\nDue to the nature of ATM cash-out malware, its core functionality won’t change much. But\ncriminals do encounter problems, so they invent modifications:\n\nTo trick the ATM security systems (using protectors or other ways to make each new\nsample unique);\nTo overcome potential ATM limitations (like maximum notes per dispense);\nTo find ways to keep the money mules from abusing their malware;\nTo improve the interface and error-handling routines.\n\nWe thus expect to see more modifications of the existing ATM malware. The preferred way of\nprotecting the ATM from this sort of threat is to have device control and process allowlisting\nsoftware running on it. The former will block the USB path of implanting the malware directly\ninto the ATM PC, while the latter will prevent execution of unauthorized software on it.\n[Kaspersky Embedded Systems Security will further help to improve the security level of the](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/embedded-systems)\nATMs.\n\nKaspersky Lab products detect WinPot and its modifications as\nBackdoor.Win32.ATMPot.gen\n\n**Sample MD5:**\n821e593e80c598883433da88a5431e9d\n\n[ATM](https://securelist.com/tag/atm/)\n[Financial malware](https://securelist.com/tag/financial-malware/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n\nAuthors\n\n\n-----\n\n[Konstantin Zykov](https://securelist.com/author/konstantinzykov/)\n\nATM robber WinPot: a slot machine instead of cutlets\n\nYour email address will not be published.
