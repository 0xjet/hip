After submission, this should allow them to\nreceive relief payments designed to help them out while staying at home.\n\nOnce opened on the targets' computer, these malicious documents will ask for macros to be\nenabled and infect them with the Sphinx banking Trojan after installing a malware\ndownloader that fetches the final payload from a remote command-and-control (C&C) server.\n\nAfter the victims' systems are compromised, Sphinx gains persistence and saves its\nconfiguration by adding several Registry keys and writing data in folders created\nunder %APPDATA%.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Registry entry created to gain persistence (IBM X-Force)**\n\"To carry out web injections, the malware patches explorer.exe and browser processes\niexplorer.exe/chrome.exe/firefox.exe but doesn’t have the actual capability of repatching itself\nagain if that patch is fixed, which makes the issue less persistent and unlikely to survive\n[version upgrades,\" the researchers also discovered.](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/zeus-sphinx-trojan-awakens-amidst-coronavirus-spam-frenzy/)\n\nSphinx uses Tables web-based control panels for web injects and it will download custom\nfiles designed to match the websites of the victims' banks for the injections to be as\nconvincing as possible.\n\nThe malware uses the web injects to alter the banks' websites to trick the victims into\nentering their credentials and authentication codes in forms that will exfiltrate the information\nto attacker-controlled servers.\n\n## One of many\n\nThis campaign is just one of an increasing number of others that try to exploit the COVID-19\n[pandemic by stealing sensitive information and infecting their targets with malware.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n\nFor instance, in somewhat related news, FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) warned\n[that a phishing campaign was using fake government economic stimulus checks to steal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-warning-phishing-emails-push-fake-govt-stimulus-checks/)\npersonal info from victims.\n\nTo avoid getting scammed, infected with malware, or have your information stolen,\nIC3 recommends not clicking on links or opening attachments sent by people you don't know,\nas well as to make sure that the sites you visit are legitimate by typing their address in the\nbrowser instead of clicking hyperlinks embedded in emails.\n\nYou should also never provide sensitive info like user credentials or any type of financial data\nwhen asked as part of a telemarketing call or over email.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft disrupts Zloader malware in global operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-disrupts-zloader-malware-in-global-operation/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[PDF smuggles Microsoft Word doc to drop Snake Keylogger malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pdf-smuggles-microsoft-word-doc-to-drop-snake-keylogger-malware/)\n\n[Historic Hotel Stay, Complementary Emotet Exposure included](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/historic-hotel-stay-complementary-emotet-exposure-included/)\n\n[FluBot Android malware targets Finland in new SMS campaigns](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flubot-android-malware-targets-finland-in-new-sms-campaigns/)\n\n\n-----",
