They used access to the VSA software to deploy\nransomware associated with the REvil/Sodinokibi ransomware-as-a-service group, according\nto reports. Kaseya has stated that the attack was conducted by exploiting a vulnerability in its\nsoftware, and said they are working on a patch. The company has not released further\n[information on the vulnerability. Kaseya recommends that any organization using VSA shut](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689)\n[the system down immediately. CISA has also issued a bulletin asking organizations using the](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/07/02/kaseya-vsa-supply-chain-ransomware-attack)\nsoftware to follow Kaseya guidance.\n\n[The full extent of the attack is currently unknown. Kaseya states that fewer than 40 of its](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689)\ncustomers are impacted. If those customers include MSPs, many more organizations could\nhave been attacked with the ransomware. Kaseya VSA’s functionality allows administrators\nto remotely manage systems. If an MSP’s VSA system was compromised, that could allow an\nattacker to deploy malware into multiple networks managed by that MSP.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere has been much speculation about the nature of this attack on social media and other\nforums. We have not been able to independently determine how these attacks were\nconducted.\n\n[Multiple sources have stated that the following three files were used to install and execute the](https://doublepulsar.com/kaseya-supply-chain-attack-delivers-mass-ransomware-event-to-us-companies-76e4ec6ec64b)\nransomware attack on Windows systems:\n\nagent.exe | d55f983c994caa160ec63a59f6b4250fe67fb3e8c43a388aec60a4a6978e9f1e\nmpsvc.dll | e2a24ab94f865caeacdf2c3ad015f31f23008ac6db8312c2cbfb32e4a5466ea2\n\nmpsvc.dll | 8dd620d9aeb35960bb766458c8890ede987c33d239cf730f93fe49d90ae759dd\n\n[Palo Alto Networks WildFire,](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire) [Threat Prevention and Cortex XDR detect and prevent REvil](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention)\nransomware infections.\n\nAs more information becomes available on the nature of this attack, we will update this brief\nto provide additional details.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Kaseya Connected REvil Executables**\n\nd55f983c994caa160ec63a59f6b4250fe67fb3e8c43a388aec60a4a6978e9f1e\n\n8dd620d9aeb35960bb766458c8890ede987c33d239cf730f93fe49d90ae759dd\n\ne2a24ab94f865caeacdf2c3ad015f31f23008ac6db8312c2cbfb32e4a5466ea2\n\n**Kaseya-provided IOCs are below:**\n\n[Source: Incident Overview and Technical Details, Kaseya](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403584098961)\n\n\n-----\n\n162.253.124[.]162\n\n**Web log IOCs**\n\nPOST /dl.asp curl/7.69.1\n\nGET /done.asp curl/7.69.1\nPOST /cgi-bin/KUpload.dll curl/7.69.1\n\nGET /done.asp curl/7.69.1\nPOST /cgi-bin/KUpload.dll curl/7.69.1\n\nPOST /userFilterTableRpt.asp curl/7.69.1\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n[Understanding REvil: The Ransomware Gang Behind the Kaseya Attack](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/revil-threat-actors/)\n\n[Threat Assessment: GandCrab and REvil Ransomware](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-threat-assessments/7/)\n\n[2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-ransomware-threat-report)\n\n[Breaking Down Ransomware Attacks](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/breaking-down-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Ransomware’s New Trend: Exfiltration and Extortion](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/whitepapers/ransomwares-new-trend-exfiltration-and-extortion)\n\n_Updated July 6, 2021, at 3:06 p.m. PT._\n\n**Get updates from Palo Alto Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
