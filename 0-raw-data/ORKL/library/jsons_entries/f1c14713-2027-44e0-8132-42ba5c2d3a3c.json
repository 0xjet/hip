It can be hard for\nan organization to keep up with the latest approaches used by adversaries, particularly when\nit comes to targeted, active attacks that are orchestrated by human operators.\n\nThe Active Adversary Playbook 2021 details attacker behavior and impact as well as the\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) seen in the wild by Sophos’ frontline threat\nhunters and incident responders.\n\nOur aim is to help security teams understand what adversaries do during attacks and\nhow to spot and defend against such activity on their network.\n\nThe findings are based on data from Sophos telemetry as well as incident reports and\nobservations from the Sophos Managed Threat Response (MTR) and Sophos Rapid\nResponse teams in 2020 and early 2021. The data is categorized according to the MITRE\nATT&CK framework.\n\n## Adversary Tactics and Techniques\n\n\n-----\n\n### The starting point: how to get the most from security product signals\n\nSecurity product detections are an invaluable source of potential warning signs. Just\nbecause something was blocked doesn’t mean a threat has been fully neutralized. For\ninstance, a detection for the Mimikatz credential stealer on a domain controller might be\nblocked, but the very fact that it exists means that a threat actor has already compromised\nthe server and may try other techniques that aren’t detected. It is always worth investigating\nsuspicious alerts, even alerts for blocked threats.\n\nTaking full advantage of security product telemetry comes down to understanding your\norganization’s operating environment. As we discuss later in this post, adversaries are\nturning to tools that are commonly used by IT administrators and security professionals,\nmaking it harder to identify suspicious actions.\n\nThis is particularly the case when adversaries use legitimate tools such as Advanced Port\nScanner, ADRecon, and others. Many of these tools are detected by security products as\n“potentially unwanted applications” (or PUAs) and are needed for everyday use by IT teams.\n\nDefenders need to ask two important questions: (1) Do all my users need to be able to use\nthese utilities? (2) Do these utilities need to be able to run on every device?\n\nThe answers to these questions will allow you to set appropriate exception policies for the\nuse of such tools. It also makes it easier to spot suspicious use: is the person or device\ntrying to run this tool authorised to do so? If the answer is no, investigate immediately.\n\n### Tactics\n\nEarly stage tactics are the highest value detections for defenders because if they are blocked\nthey can neutralize and contain an attack before it has the chance to fully unfold and cause\ndamage or disruption.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that the attacker tactics most likely to spark an investigation are\nheavily weighted towards activity that happens early in the attack chain. For instance, out of\nall the tactics escalated by Sophos MTR for investigation, 31% were suspicious “execution”\ndetections, 17% were “persistence” detections and 16% were “initial access” detections.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tactics are generally identified through the techniques used to achieve them. The table\nbelow lists the top adversarial techniques associated with each attack tactic during\n2020/2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Techniques\n\nThe table below lists the techniques most likely to trigger a deeper investigation and to\nsignpost an active threat.\n\nThe overall leader, “Command and Scripting Interpreter,” which includes such things as\nPowerShell, Cmd, etc., was excluded from the list because its dominance overshadows and\nobscures other important techniques. Scripting is the most used technique across all MITRE\ncategories, and most MITRE techniques are achievable via script.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter scripting, the list is led by techniques that involve proxying the execution of malicious\ncontent with signed binaries (“signed binary proxy detections.”) One in six (18%) of all\ndetections that sparked investigations involved this technique. Windows Management\nInstrumentation detections were in second place, accounting for 10% of investigations.\n\n## Adversary Behavior and Impact\n\nThe data and observations in this section are based on 81 incidents targeting organizations\nof all sizes (the largest organization involved had 13,500 employees,) in a wide range of\nindustry sectors, located as far afield as the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, Switzerland,\nGermany, Belgium, Hong Kong, and Austria.\n\nThe most hit sector was manufacturing (the target for 16% of attacks) followed by healthcare,\nretail and IT (each a target for 9% of incidents,) and then financial services and business\nservices (5% each.) Non-profit organizations were the target for 4% of attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Anatomy of an active attack\n\nThe median time that attackers were able to remain in the target network before detection –\ndwell time – was 11 days. The longest intruder dwell time observed by rapid responders was\n439 days (more than 15 months.)\n\nTo put this in context, 11 days potentially provide attackers with approximately 264 hours for\nmalicious activity, such as lateral movement, reconnaissance, credential dumping, data\nexfiltration, and more. Considering that some of these activities can take just minutes or a\nfew hours to implement, 11 days provide attackers with plenty of time to do damage.\n\nThe release of ransomware is often the point at which an attack becomes visible to the IT\nsecurity team. It is therefore not surprising that 81% of the incidents Sophos responded to\ninvolved ransomware. Ransomware attacks tend to have shorter dwell time than “stealth”\nattacks, because they are all about destruction.\n\nOther attack types included exfiltration-only, cryptominers, banking trojans, wipers, droppers,\npen test/attack tools, and more.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Earliest observed attack vector\n\nRemote access services such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) were involved at the start\nof almost one in three (30%) attacks. Phishing was the starting point for around one in eight\n(12%) attacks, followed by the exploitation of vulnerable systems in about one in 10.\n\nCobalt Strike was the earliest identified part of the attack in around 5% of cases, but its\nprevalence across many different stages of an active attack suggests that the presence of\nCobalt Strike is among one of the most valuable indicators of active malicious activity.\n\n### Why “unknown” matters\n\nThreat investigators can’t always retrace every step intruders take in an attack. Sometimes\nthe attackers have intentionally deleted evidence of their activity and sometimes the IT\nsecurity team has already wiped or re-imaged compromised machines by the time the\nresponders arrive. The result can be the loss of important forensic information that could\nreveal security gaps in the target’s IT environment and provide valuable insight on attacker\nbehavior.\n\n### A quick note about RDP\n\nRDP played a part in 90% of attacks. However, the way in which attackers used RDP is\nworth noting. In incidents that involved RDP, it was used for external access only in just 4%\nof cases. Around a quarter (28%) of attacks showed attackers using RDP for both external\naccess and internal movement, while in 41% of cases, RDP was used only for internal lateral\nmovement within the network.\n\n### Top attack droppers\n\n\n-----\n\nA dropper is a kind of delivery malware – or trojan – designed to load or install other malware\nto a target system. The payload is either carried inside the dropper or the dropper downloads\nit when it is activated. Droppers are enablers for an unfolding attack, providing a platform for\nadditional malicious modules such as backdoors and ransomware.\n\nMalicious scripts were by far the most prevalent dropper seen by incident responders and\nwere involved in a third of all attacks. They were followed by a broad category of tools used\nboth by attackers and penetration testers (“grey hat” tools, such as those seen in the artefact\ntable below, accounting for 9% of attacks.) Trickbot (seen in 3.7% of incidents) and QBot\n(seen in 1.2% of cases) are two widely used types of “secondary malware” often seen in\nransomware attacks. Valak, a malware dropper now believed to be evolving into a more\nadvanced multi-stage modular malware and Cobalt Strike were each seen in 1.2% of cases.\nThe dropper used was unknown in 47% of investigations.\n\n### Tools used in attacks\n\nThe pie chart shows the items most likely to be found in an attacker’s toolbox. The full list of\ntools seen in attacks totalled 405. Most of them are distinct, identifiable tools and many can\nalso be used by IT professionals for benign purposes. They appeal to attackers because\nthey allow them to implement activity such as credential stealing, discovery, lateral\nmovement and malware execution, and more, while blending in with harmless everyday IT\nactivity.\n\nThe number and nature of the tools seen highlight the challenge defenders face in\ndifferentiating between malicious and legitimate activity on the network.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, Process Hacker, PCHunter and GMER are all legitimate tools that include\nkernel drivers. If an attacker gets the right kernel driver installed they can often disable\nsecurity products. The fact that attackers are now routinely trying to do this is a testament to\nhow good security products are at disrupting the attack kill chain. In other words, if you can’t\nbeat them, try to break them.\n\nIt is good security practice to ensure the use of these tools is blocked except for specific\ncircumstances, and to investigate what is going on if they are spotted being used at any\nother time.\n\n### The red flag of tool combinations\n\nSome interesting correlations emerge among the top five tools found in victim networks.\n\nFor instance, when PowerShell is used in an attack, Cobalt Strike is seen in 58% of cases,\nPsExec in 49%, Mimikatz in 33%, and GMER in 19%. Cobalt Strike and PsExec are used\ntogether in 27% of attacks, while Mimikatz and PsExec occur together in 31% of attacks.\nLastly, the combination of Cobalt Strike, PowerShell and PsExec occurs in 12% of all attacks.\n\nSuch correlations are important because their detection can serve as an early warning of an\nimpending attack or confirm the presence of an active attack.\n\n### The main attack groups seen\n\nThe list of attack groups seen is dominated by ransomware families, but also includes\ncryptominers and suspected nation-state attackers, among others. In some cases, the attack\ngroup involved is unknown because the attack was detected and contained before the\nrelease of the final payload. There were 37 different attack groups identified in all, a clear\nindication of how very crowded and complex the cyberthreat landscape has become, and\nhow difficult this can make life for defenders.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEvery organization is a target for someone. It could be for business email compromise,\ncryptominers, data exfiltration, corporate espionage or a headline-hitting large scale\nransomware attack. Cybercrime is a lucrative business.\n\nSecurity teams can defend their organization by monitoring and investigating suspicious\nactivity. The difference between benign and malicious is not always easy to spot. Technology\nin any environment, whether cyber or physical, can do a great deal but it is not enough by\nitself. Human experience and the ability to respond are a vital part of any security solution.\n\n### Sophos Managed Threat Response and Rapid Response\n\n**The Sophos Managed Threat Response (MTR) team provides 24/7, worldwide threat**\nhunting, detection, and response capabilities, delivered by an expert team as a fully\n[managed service.
