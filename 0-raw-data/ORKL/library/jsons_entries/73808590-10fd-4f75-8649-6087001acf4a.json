Security Intelligence Report (SIR) focuses on software\nvulnerabilities, software vulnerability exploits, malware, and unwanted software.\nPast reports and related resources are available for download at\n[www.microsoft.com/sir. We hope that readers find the data, insights, and](http://www.microsoft.com/sir)\nguidance provided in this report useful in helping them protect their\norganizations, software, and users.\n\n**Reporting period**\n\nThis volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report focuses on the first and\nsecond quarters of 2016, with trend data for the last several quarters presented\non a quarterly basis. Because vulnerability disclosures can be highly inconsistent\nfrom quarter to quarter and often occur disproportionately at certain times of\nthe year, statistics about vulnerability disclosures are presented on a half-yearly\nbasis.\n\nThroughout the report, half-yearly and quarterly time periods are referenced\nusing the nHyy or nQyy formats, in which yy indicates the calendar year and n\nindicates the half or quarter. For example, 1H16 represents the first half of 2016\n(January 1 through June 30), and 4Q15 represents the fourth quarter of 2015\n(October 1 through December 31). To avoid confusion, please note the reporting\nperiod or periods being referenced when considering the statistics in this report.\n\n**Conventions**\n\n[This report uses the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) naming](http://www.microsoft.com/mmpc)\nstandard for families and variants of malware. For information about this\nstandard, see “Appendix A: Threat naming conventions” on page 135. In this\nreport, any threat or group of threats that share a common unique base name is\nconsidered a family for the sake of presentation. This consideration includes\nthreats that may not otherwise be considered families according to common\nindustry practices, such as generic and cloud-based detections. For the\npurposes of this report, a threat is defined as a malicious or unwanted software\nfamily or variant that is detected by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine.\n\n\n-----\n\n## How to use this report\n\nThe Microsoft Security Intelligence Report has been released twice a year since\n2006. Each volume is based upon data collected from millions of computers all\nover the world, which not only provides valuable insights on the worldwide\nthreat landscape, both at home and at work, but also provides detailed\ninformation about threat profiles faced by computer users in more than a\nhundred individual countries and regions.\n\nTo get the most out of each volume, Microsoft recommends the following:\n\n**Read**\n\nEach volume of the report consists of several parts. The primary report typically\nconsists of a worldwide threat assessment, one or more feature articles,\nguidance for mitigating risk, and some supplemental information. A summary of\nthe key findings in the report can be downloaded and reviewed separately from\nthe full report; it highlights a number of facts and subjects that are likely to be of\nparticular interest to readers. The regional threat assessment, available for\n[download and in interactive form at www.microsoft.com/security/sir/threat,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/sir/threat/)\nprovides individual summaries of threat statistics and security trends for more\nthan 100 countries and regions worldwide.\n\nReading the volume in its entirety will provide readers with the most benefit and\ncontext, but the report is designed to provide value in small doses as well. Take\na few minutes to review the summary information to find the information that\nwill be of most interest to you and your organization. Consult the table of\ncontents and the index to learn more about particular topics of interest.\n\n**Share**\n\nMicrosoft also encourages readers to share each released volume, or its\ndownload link, with co-workers, peers, and friends with similar interests. The\n_Microsoft Security Intelligence Report is written to be useful and accessible to a_\nwide range of audiences. Each volume contains thousands of hours of research\ndisseminated in easy to understand language, with advanced technical jargon\nkept to a minimum. Each section and article is written and reviewed to provide\nthe most value for the time it takes to read.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Assess your own risk**\n\nReading about the threats and risks that affect different types of environments\npresents a good opportunity to assess your own risks. Not every computer and\nentity faces the same risk from all threats. Assess your own risks and determine\nwhich topics and information can help you to best defend against the most\nsignificant risks.\n\nThe volume and scope of threats facing the typical organization make it\nimportant to prioritize. The greatest risk to any computer or organization is\nposed by currently and recently active threats. Pay attention to the threats that\nhave most commonly affected your region or industry, focusing particularly on\nthe most common successful attacks in the wild that cause the most problems.\nGive less consideration to very rare or theoretical-only attacks, unless your\ncomputers are at particular risk for such threats.\n\n**Educate**\n\nMicrosoft strives to make this report one of the most valuable sources of threat\nand mitigation information that you can read and share. We encourage you to\nuse the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report as a guide to educate your\nemployees, friends, and families about security-related topics.\n\nAnyone, including a business, may link, point to, or re-use articles in the\n_Microsoft Security Intelligence Report for informational purposes, provided the_\nmaterial is not used for publication or sale outside of your company and you\ncomply with the following terms: You must not alter the materials in any way.\nYou must provide a reference to the URL at which the materials were originally\nfound. You must include the Microsoft copyright notice followed by “Used with\n[permission from Microsoft Corporation.” Please see Use of Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/Permissions/default.aspx)\n[Copyrighted Content for further information.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/Permissions/default.aspx)\n\n**Ask questions**\n\nContact your local Microsoft representative with any questions you have about\nthe topics and facts presented in this report.

Enterprise IT teams have established policies and procedures designed for\nenterprise infrastructure and applications, based on their decades of security\nexperience dealing with on-premises threats. Many of these policies and\nprocedures can be used effectively in public and hybrid cloud environments.\nHowever, security teams need to keep abreast of changes in the threat\nlandscape brought on by the emergence of cloud computing.\n\n**Threats against cloud deployments and infrastructure**\n\nNew types of threats can be related to characteristics of the public cloud only, or\nto issues introduced by connectivity between on-premises environments and\nthe public cloud. The following subsections provide descriptions of some new\ntypes of threats.\n\nDisclosing secrets on public sites\n\nPublic code repositories such as GitHub have become very popular with\ndevelopers because they enable easy collaboration and source control and\nremove the responsibility for maintaining the repository infrastructure from\ndevelopers. But public repositories can be a double-edged sword. Documented\ncases exist of developers accidentally publishing secret keys on GitHub and\nother public code repositories, which were discovered by attackers and used to\ncompromise cloud services. Such incidents can sometimes give attackers access\nto a service’s entire account/subscription database, or allow them to misuse its\ncompute resources for malicious purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nPivot back attacks\n\nA pivot back attack occurs when an attacker compromises a public cloud\nresource to obtain information that they then use to attack the resource\nprovider’s on-premises environment. Public facing endpoints in the cloud are\noften under constant brute force attack through protocols such as Remote\nDesktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH). Although the overwhelming\nmajority of these attacks fail, a very small percentage of them succeed. When\nthey do, an attacker can sometimes find sensitive information in unexpected or\nobscure places.\n\n\n#### Targeted attacks\n against on- premises and\n cloud infra- structures often\n\n\nFor example, they could find such secrets in a Bash session\nhistory or a text file in the root directory of the virtual machine’s\ndesktop. Such information can be used to access resources such\nas databases, SharePoint sites, and cloud storage. If left\nunimpeded, an attacker could continue gathering information\nthat could provide greater access to the enterprise infrastructure\nand data.\n\nAttacks against cloud administrators\n\n\n#### focus on IT Attacks against cloud administrators administrators. Targeted attacks against on-premises and cloud infrastructures\n\nalike often focus on IT administrators. The intent is to take\ncontrol of an email account that has a high probability of containing credentials\nthat can be used to gain access to the public cloud administrator portal.\n\n\nAfter logging into the administrator portal, an attacker can gather information\nand make changes to gain access to other cloud-based resources, execute\nransomware, or even pivot back to the on-premises environment, as explained\nearlier.\n\nMan in the Cloud (MitC) attacks\n\nAnother new threat is posed by what the security company Imperva has dubbed\n“Man in the Cloud,” or MitC attacks,[1] In which an attacker induces a prospective\nvictim to install a piece of malware using a typical mechanism, such as an email\nwith a link to a malicious website. After the malware is downloaded and installed,\n\n1 “Man in the Cloud (MITC) Attacks,” Imperva Hacker Intelligence Initiative Report,\n[https://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Man_In_The_Cloud_Attacks.pdf.](https://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Man_In_The_Cloud_Attacks.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nit finds a cloud storage folder on the user’s computer. It then switches out the\nuser’s cloud storage synchronization token with the attacker’s token.\n\nAfter the token switch, the attacker will receive copies of each file the user places\nin cloud storage, which effectively makes the attacker a “man in the middle” for\ncloud storage. One of the attacker’s advantages in this threat scenario is that the\nmalware is removed after the token is switched out, which makes it harder to\ndetect the compromise.\n\nSide-channel attacks\n\nIn a side-channel attack, an attacker attempts to put a virtual machine on the\nsame physical server as the intended victim. If such a successful co-location can\nbe achieved, the attacker will be able to launch local attacks against the victim.\nThese attacks might include local DDoS, network sniffing, and man-in-themiddle attacks, all of which can be used to extract information.\n\nIt should be noted that side-channel attacks are not trivial. Microsoft Azure\nemploys a number of obfuscation methodologies to significantly decrease the\nchances of such an attack succeeding.\n\nResource ransom\n\nRansomware is well-known in the desktop operating system space. This malware\nrestricts access to components of an operating system or to files stored on disk,\ntypically through encryption, and demands that the victim pay the attacker to\nget the keys required to restore access.\n\nAttackers have made similar attempts to hold cloud resources hostage by\nbreaking in to a prospective victim’s public cloud account using any one of a\nnumber of methods, including some of the methods discussed in this section.\nWhen they have control of the account, the attackers attempt to encrypt or\notherwise restrict access to as many cloud resources as possible. The attackers\nthen require the victim to pay the ransom to release the restricted resources.\n\nThe challenge for the attacker is to inform the victim that the attack has taken\nplace, and how to pay the ransom. Because servers usually don’t have signed in\nusers, attackers need to use methods other than those used for desktop\nransomware. One way an attacker can inform cloud resource ransom victims is\nthrough the use of bot technology, which presents another, and perhaps\nunexpected, use case for the new and growing ecosystem of bot technologies.\n\n\n-----\n\nCloud weaponization\n\nIn the cloud weaponization threat scenario, an attacker establishes a foothold\nwithin a cloud infrastructure by compromising and taking control of a few virtual\nmachines. The attacker can then use these virtual machines to attack,\ncompromise, and control thousands of virtual machines – some within the same\npublic cloud service provider as the initial attack, and others inside other public\ncloud service providers.\n\nEach of the compromised virtual machines has malware installed that establishes\na backdoor connection to the attacker’s command and control servers, from\nwhich the attacker can issue commands to the thousands of compromised\nvirtual machines to attack targets throughout the Internet.\n\nCloud weaponization can be implemented in a number of ways using a variety\nof attacks, including SSH, RDP, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), unsolicited\nmessaging (spamming), port scanning, and port sweeping.\n\nAzure actively monitors for cloud weaponization. Figure 1 shows the distribution\nof the outbound attacks discovered (and in many cases mitigated) by Azure\nSecurity Center’s advanced detection mechanisms.\n\nFigure 1.

Hutchins, Michael J. Cloppert, Rohan M. Amin, Ph.D., “Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense\nInformed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains,” Lockheed Martin Corporation, 2011,\n[www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf)\n[Defense.pdf.](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nmodel has become very popular with IT security groups within both small and\nlarge IT organizations. It includes the following phases:\n\n- Reconnaissance. The attacker determines the best targets by probing a\nnumber of online and offline resources.\n\n- Weaponization. Files (such as documents) can be changed in ways to make\nthem useful “weapons” against a target system and can also be used to\nenable installation of malicious code.\n\n- Delivery. Weaponized files are placed on the target.\n\n- Exploitation. Weaponized files are “detonated” to take advantage of\nweaknesses in the target operating system or applications.\n\n- Installation. A back door mechanism is installed on the compromised device\nso that that the attacker has persistent access.\n\n- Command and control (C2). Malware on the compromised device\ncommunicates with a command-and-control system that provides the\nattacker with access to resources required to carry out actions.\n\n- Actions on objectives. The attacker moves forward to carry out objectives,\nwhich may be predefined, or evolve based on discovery.\n\nThe cyber kill chain was defined at a time when cloud computing was still\ngaining traction and did not explicitly consider the some of the unique aspects\nof cloud computing. There are some differences in how to approach the various\nphases in the kill chain between on-premises and cloud computing scenarios.\n\nFigure 4 reformulates the cyber kill chain phases to make it easier to understand\nsome of the differences in the cyber kill chain between on-premises and cloud\nenvironments.\n\nFigure 4. The cyber kill chain on-premises and in the public cloud\n\n|Phase Active reconnaissance|On-premises HUMINT, OSINT (users)|Public cloud Foot printing (services)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Delivery|Browser, mail, USB (user interaction)|Hacking (no user interaction)|\n|Exploitation|Client-side vulnerabilities|Server-side vulnerabilities|\n|Persistence|File system based|Memory based|\n|Internal reconnaissance|Custom tools|Built-in admin tools|\n|Lateral movement|Machine pivot|Resource pivot|\n\n\n-----\n\nActive reconnaissance\n\nDuring the active reconnaissance phase, the attacker learns about the intended\nvictim to improve their chances of a successful attack. In the on-premises world,\nthe attacker can take advantage of social networks to learn information about\nthe target that can be used to induce the victim to download malware during\nthe delivery phase.\n\n\nThe same ruse isn’t as easy in the cloud. There’s no social\nnetwork for servers and services to help the attacker learn\nmore about them. The attacker must go through a time and\neffort-intensive process of scanning the network, doing port\nscans to discover devices, and then testing active service\nports. All this activity provides the defender an opportunity\nfor discovering the attacker’s activities.\n\nDelivery\n\n\n#### Active reconnaissance isn’t as easy in the cloud.\n\n\nThe attacker places malware on the target during the delivery phase. In the onpremises world, the attacker can create an email that has a malicious link to a\nwebsite or include an attachment that leads to the installation of malicious code.\nAnother option is to copy the malware onto a USB key and then place the USB\nkey in a strategic location so that the intended target finds it. The victim then\nputs the USB key into their computer, which compromises it.\n\nIn the public cloud, the attacker needs to deliver the malicious payload to a\nserver. Because it’s unlikely to find a logged on user on a server to install\nmalicious code, the attacker needs to find a way to gain direct access. One way\nto accomplish this is through a brute force attack. If such an attack is successful,\nthe attacker will be able to place malware on the server.\n\nThe defender has an opportunity to detect the malware on the server before the\nattacker moves on to the exploitation phase.\n\nExploitation\n\nOn-premises exploitation typically focuses on client-side vulnerabilities. In the\npublic cloud the focus is on server-side vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nPersistence\n\nIn most cases, attackers of client operating systems will use tools that persist on\nthe compromised device by placing them on the local hard disk. Tools aren’t\nplaced in memory because client computers reboot relatively often for system\nupdates, policy changes, or even simple password changes or bug checks.\n\nIn contrast, server uptime is much longer, which benefits attackers because they\ncan load exploit code into memory and have the code persist for an extended\nperiod of time. Longer server uptime reduces the risk of detection because there\nis no persistent code on disk that’s easy to detect.\n\nAlthough traditional disk scanning techniques won’t find evidence of in-memory\nmalware, defenders can use crash dump analysis to discover and examine\nmalware that exists only in memory.\n\nInternal reconnaissance\n\nIn many on-premises client attack scenarios, the attacker uses custom tools.\nBuilt-in toolsets are not as robust as those found on servers and therefore don’t\nmeet their needs.\n\nSuch custom toolsets aren’t seen very often in the cloud. Attackers take\nadvantage of built-in admin tools, which are typically more powerful than what’s\nfound on client operating systems. These built-in admin tools help attackers by\nreducing the risk of detection; they don’t need to place custom attack tools on\ndisk.\n\nBecause new attack tools aren’t being installed on cloud-based virtual machines,\nthey can’t be detected with disk scanning techniques. Instead, defenders can use\nmachine learning and behavioral analytics to differentiate between legitimate\nadmin activity and malicious activity.\n\nLateral movement\n\nLateral movement across on-premises networks uses a machine (or virtual\nmachine) pivot. Attackers move from machine to machine by obtaining\nincreasingly privileged credentials as they expand outward. Tools such as\nmimikatz are used by attackers to harvest such credentials.\n\nThe machine pivot isn’t currently the norm in the cloud. There are a number of\nreasons for this, such as the fact that tenants maintain a number of resource\n\n\n-----\n\nislands in the cloud. Also, in most cases there is limited trust between the cloud\nand on-premises deployments.\n\n\nIn the cloud, the primary pivot appears to cloud resources.\nFor example, with resource pivoting, an attacker will\ncompromise an IaaS virtual machine, find credentials for a\nstorage service, where more credentials are discovered,\nsome of which allow access to a SQL instance. The attacker\nhops services instead of virtual machines.\n\n\n#### Without powerful detection, there can be no response.\n\n\nThis service hopping behavior enables the defender to focus on this type of\nactivity and enables another avenue for detection.\n\n**Countering threats with Azure Security Center Advanced Threat**\n**Detection**\n\nAzure Security Center helps protect, detect, and respond to security threats\nagainst Azure cloud-based resources. Security Center provides protection by\nanalyzing the security status of Azure resources and then providing\nrecommendations on how to increase the level of security.\n\nProtection is just the first level. The ability to detect that an intrusion has taken\nplace is critical. Without powerful detection, there can be no response. Azure\nSecurity Center uses advanced threat detection technologies and\nmethodologies to detect threats that would have been very difficult to find prior\nto the advent of machine learning and big data.\n\nAzure Security Center uses a number of methods that work together to provide\nadvanced threat detection. These methods include:\n\n- Atomic detections\n\n- Threat intelligence feeds\n\n- Behavioral analysis\n\n- Anomaly detection\n\n- Detection fusion\n\nAtomic detections\n\nAtomic detections are based on well-known malicious patterns that are\nconsistent with indicators of compromise (IoC). These patterns are not subject to\nmutation, and therefore are considered unambiguous. They can be determined\n\n\n-----\n\nby a single entity, such as a single packet, single behavior, or single event\n(recorded in a log entry). This determination is similar to how an intrusion\ndetection system (IDS) works, but instead of using on-the-wire packet analysis,\natomic threat detection typically uses log entries.\n\nAtomic threat detection has a high return on investment because development\noverhead is relatively low. In addition, there is also a very low false positive rate.\nMost commodity malware can be found with atomic detections.\n\nA disadvantage of atomic detection is that it isn’t the best method for detecting\nmore sophisticated attacks. Atomic detections are very threat specific, and so it\nis relatively easy for skilled attackers to evade them. However, this isn’t a\nproblem because Azure Security Center uses a multi-tier detection strategy that\nprovides the ability to detect attacks at multiple levels.\n\nSuspicious processes provide an example of an attack type that lends itself to\natomic detection. In the example seen in Figure 5, you can see that Azure\nSecurity Center has detected that the mimikatz.exe process is running. Mimikatz\nis a tool that has been used by malicious attackers to steal credentials from a\ncompromised machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Azure Security Center detects and alerts on the mimikatz malware\n\nThreat intelligence feeds\n\nAzure Security Center uses a number of threat intelligence (TI) feeds, such as\nthose from the Microsoft Digital Crime Unit, to help detect potential threats\nagainst Azure resources. Azure Security Center uses these feeds primarily for\nbot detection.\n\nSeveral actions are possible if a virtual machine hosted on Azure appears in one\nof these feeds. For example, observing network traffic can confirm that the\npotentially compromised virtual machine is in contact with a command-andcontrol server. If this network communication is successfully verified, it’s possible\nto take over the compromised VM’s DNS, which can provide additional insight\ninto the botnet infrastructure and IP addresses used by the command-andcontrol servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilar to atomic detections, TI feeds provide a high ROI for threat detection\nbecause of the simple logic required to attain high fidelity alerts. And as more TI\nproviders are added, more detections are possible.\n\nAzure Security Center alerts users when their virtual machines are discovered to\nbe communicating with command-and-control servers. These connections are\nconsistent with bot links from computers infected with malware similar to Alina\nor Conficker. Figure 6 shows an alert generated by Azure Security Center based\non such a detection.\n\nFigure 6. Azure Security Center showing communication with a C&C server\n\nBehavioral analysis\n\nAtomic and threat intelligence-based detections are essentially pattern\nmatching. To detect more complex threats, more advanced methods of threat\ndetection are required.\n\nOne such method is behavioral analysis. In contrast to pattern matching,\nbehavioral analysis moves beyond pattern matching and signatures and focuses\non the malicious behavior. This focus enables defenders to counter attackers\nwho generate an almost infinite number of variants for a particular malware.\nMalware designers can change the hash, switch a bit or byte, change a packet or\npattern; each of these changes would require a new signature.\n\nBehavioral analysis drills down to what the malware is doing on the system.\nThere’s no need to pattern match each malware variant if the behavior of the\nmalware can be identified. In the final analysis, it’s the behavior that is of most\n\n\n-----\n\ninterest. Each malicious behavior can represent literally thousands of individual\nsignature variants. Behavioral analysis is variant resistant.\n\nHowever, there are gray areas in some of the behaviors. Such borderline cases\ncould lead to false positives. When the system detects these ambiguous\nbehaviors, Azure Security Center looks for other behaviors or detections to\nconfirm the initial suspicion. More information about the confirmation process is\nprovided in the discussion on detection fusion later in this section.\n\nAn example of behavioral analysis: system processes that run in an abnormal\ncontext. Azure Security Center can detect these situations and fire an alert. In\nthe example seen in, you can see that Azure Security Center has detected that\nSVCHOST was running in an abnormal context. SVCHOST is a container process\nfor many other system processes and malware often tries to take advantage of\nthis to hide its activity.\n\nFigure 7. Azure Security Center detects processes running in an abnormal context\n\n\n-----\n\nAnomaly detection\n\nBehavioral analysis discovers known threats by detecting known behaviors. This\nprocess is immensely useful, and significantly extends detection capabilities\nbeyond simple signature-based detections.\n\nThe logical next step is to detect unknown threats, which is where anomaly\ndetection comes into play.\n\nWith anomaly detection, the system builds a baseline. The baseline is defined by\nthe history of a certain element of the virtual machine. If a statistically significant\ndeviation from that baseline is detected, an alert might be generated.\n\nIt’s important to note that while the system might generate an alert, it’s possible\n\n\n#### Anomaly detection\n makes it possible to move past what\n is already known,\n and discover possible new\n exploits.\n\n\nthat no alert will be generated. The reason for this possibility is\nthat not all deviations from baseline are detrimental. Similar to\nother detections, when the system detects ambiguous activity,\nsupporting evidence and correlation with other detections are\nsought to confirm.\n\nOne of the major advantages of anomaly detection is that it\nenables detections to move past what is already known, and\ndiscover possible new exploits. Anomalies can lead researchers\nto dig deeper, and come up with new analytics that define new\n“known” threats.\n\n\nAn example of an anomaly-based detection is a brute force attack. A brute force\nattack is characterized by repeated attempts to log onto a virtual machine with\nguessed user names and passwords. Azure Security Center can detect that the\nnumber of failed log on attempts has reached a statistically significant level and\ngenerate an alert, as seen in Figure 8.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Azure Security Center detects a failed brute force attack\n\nDetection fusion\n\nAs stated several times in this section, instances exist when a specific detection is\nnon-specific, which requires supporting evidence to reduce the probability of a\nfalse positive. A very effective method for reducing ambiguity (and the false\npositive rate) is to correlate individual alerts generated throughout the cyber kill\nchain.\n\nThe correlations provide the context needed to confirm that the findings of each\nof the individual alerts represents an actual security event. We call this\ncombination or correlation of multiple alerts along the kill chain a security\n_incident._\n\nSecurity incidents are explicitly identified in the alerts section of Azure Security\nCenter. In addition, incidents help to reduce investigation time by providing\ninsight into what steps the attacker took, and what specific resources were\naffected.\n\n\n-----\n\nIncidents tie together alerts during attack progression. A simplified\ncharacterization of the cyber kill chain places incidents into one of three phases:\n\n- Target and attack\n\n- Install and exploit\n\n- Post breach\n\nTarget and attack\n\nThe target and attack phase represents the reconnaissance and deliver phases\nof the cyber kill chain.\n\nFor example, a brute force attack against a virtual machine fits into this phase;\nalerts related to brute force attacks are placed here.\n\nWhen an attacker launches a brute force attack against a virtual machine, Azure\nSecurity Center will use anomaly detection to determine whether the number of\nlogon attempts exceeds what is expected. If so, Azure Security Center surfaces a\nfailed brute force attempt alert to the user.\n\nInstall and exploit\n\nThe system analyzes the results of the initial attack during the install and exploit\nphase.\n\nSome of the things considered during this phase include:\n\n- Evidence of existing malware signatures (using Microsoft antimalware or\npartner solutions)\n\n- In-memory malware (using crash dump analysis)\n\n- Suspicious process execution (using behavioral analysis)\n\n- Lateral movement\n\n- Internal reconnaissance\n\nSuppose an attacker were able to gain access to a virtual machine using a brute\nforce attack (which would have taken place during the target and attack phase).\nMalware is installed on the machine (during the install and exploit phase) and\nthe malware ends up causing a process to crash.\n\nAzure Security Center will collect a copy of the crash dump and scan it for\nevidence of in-memory malware. If an exploit (such as malicious shellcode) is\n\n\n-----\n\nfound, an alert will be generated and assigned to the target and attack phase of\nthe kill chain.\n\nPost breach\n\nAttackers execute their plans during the post breach phase, which includes all\nthe activities attackers carry out using automated or manual processes on\ncompromised virtual machines.\n\nFor example, a virtual machine is compromised by a brute force attack during\nthe target and attack phase and an alert is generated. The attacker installs\nmalware, and another alert is generated during the install and exploit phase.\nFinally, the malware generates large amounts of SMTP traffic. This SMTP traffic is\ncorrelated with the Office 365 SPAM database to determine whether this traffic\nis legitimate or SPAM. If the assessment is SPAM, an alert is generated by Azure\nSecurity Center.\n\nIn addition to these alerts, an incident (defined as a collection of alerts) is\ngenerated by Azure Security Center indicating a very high probability that a\nsuccessful compromise has taken place because of the correlation and\nverification of and by multiple alerts.\n\nFigure 9 shows a number of security incidents as reported by Azure Security\nCenter.\n\nFigure 9. A list of security incidents in Azure Security Center\n\nAzure Security Center also provides the ability to drill down on a security\nincident and provide detailed information on the individual alerts that were\ncorrelated to create the incident, as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Azure Security Center provides additional information about security events\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe cloud introduces a number of new attack vectors that were previously\nunavailable to intruders in the on-premises world. These new attack types\nrequire that we evolve our methods of attack detection. Detecting cloud-based\nattacks requires us to address and act on the differences between the onpremises and cloud kill chains. There are also security benefits from running\nyour workloads in the cloud, as you’ll benefit from Microsoft’s comprehensive\nthreat intelligence and security expertise. Azure Security Center takes advantage\nof a multi-layered approach to threat detection, which ranges from rudimentary\nsignature based systems all the way up to machine learning driven approaches\n[and detection fusion.

Part\nof this job involves observing the activities of targeted activity groups, which are\noften the first ones to introduce new exploits and techniques that are later used\nby other attackers. The previous two volumes of the Microsoft Security\n_Intelligence Report explored the activities of two such groups, code-named_\nSTRONTIUM and PLATINUM, which used previously unknown vulnerabilities and\naggressive, persistent techniques to target specific individuals and institutions—\noften including military installations, intelligence agencies, and other\ngovernment bodies.\n\nThis volume chronicles two activity groups, code-named PROMETHIUM and\nNEODYMIUM, both of which target individuals in a specific area of Europe.\nAlthough most malware today either seeks monetary gain or conducts\nespionage for economic advantage, both of these activity groups appear to\nseek information about specific individuals.\n\nIn May 2016, both PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM were observed to launch\nattack campaigns. These campaigns used completely distinct infrastructure and\nprimary malware, which indicated a lack of association at the operational level.\nHowever, the similarity in the campaigns’ victim locale, timing, and use of the\nsame zero-day exploit prior to public disclosure strongly indicates that the\nactivity groups may be related at a higher organizational tier.\n\nMicrosoft is sharing information about these groups to raise awareness of their\nactivities, and to help individuals and organizations implement existing\nmitigation options that significantly reduce risk from these attack groups and\nother similar groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Activity Group Profile: PROMETHIUM**\n\nCampaign summary: PROMETHIUM is an activity group that has been active\nsince at least 2012. In 2016, an attack campaign by this group was recorded in\n[early May that made use of an exploit for CVE-2016-4117, a vulnerability in](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb16-15.html)\nAdobe Flash Player, which at the time was both unknown and unpatched.\nAdobe promptly and publicly acknowledged the zero-day vulnerability and\npushed a security update.\n\n\n#### PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM both\n target individuals in a specific area of\n\n\nThe attack itself began with certain individuals receiving links in\ninstant messenger clients. These links led to malicious\ndocuments that invoked exploit code and eventually executed a\npiece of malware called Truvasys on unsuspecting victims’\ncomputers.\n\n\nAdministrators and users wondering whether they were\n\n#### Europe.\n\ntargeted by PROMETHIUM can scan their network by using the\nindicators listed in the appendix, by using Windows Defender to\nexamine their logs for “Truvasys,” or by searching for PROMETHIUM in their\n[Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection product console alerts.](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/03/01/announcing-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection/)\n\n[Attack details: Truvasys has been previously documented by peer organizations](https://securelist.com/blog/research/76147/on-the-strongpity-waterhole-attacks-targeting-italian-and-belgian-encryption-users/)\nin the security industry. The malware and its developers have been active for a\nfew years and have conducted multiple attack campaigns by masquerading as\ncommon computer utilities such as WinUtils, TrueCrypt, WinRAR, and SanDisk.\nIn each of the campaigns, the Truvasys malware was updated to include\nadditional features, showing close collaboration between the activity groups\nbehind the campaigns and the developers of the malware.\n\nTruvasys is a collection of modules written in the Delphi programming language,\na variant of Pascal. It runs on 32-bit and 64-bit editions of multiple versions of\nWindows, including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10, in\nboth standard user and administrator modes. It includes a number of features\ndesigned to evade detection, including virtual environment detection and\ntampering with security software.\n\nTruvasys connects to a remote command and control (C&C) server to retrieve\ninstructions from an attacker, who can use the malware to execute arbitrary\nfunctionality on the compromised computer.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis malware family has targeted individuals through the combined use of spear\nphishing and watering hole techniques for a number of years. In most cases,\nTruvasys is embedded with legitimate installers of applications, compromising\nindividual computers by tricking users into running the installers. One campaign\ninvolved a fake Adobe Flash Player installer, with a social engineering lure in\nTurkish.\n\nFigure 11. In one campaign, Truvasys was distributed via social engineering lures in the Turkish language\n\nThe language used in this example is consistent with the geography of Truvasys\nvictims, as observed over the years. Most Truvasys activities have been observed\nacross western Europe with a large majority of computers using the Turkish\nlocale setting, which suggests that most of them are Turkish citizens or\nexpatriates.\n\nWhile studying Truvasys, Microsoft uncovered a previously undocumented\npiece of malware known as Myntor that is a completely separate malware family.\nMyntor is pushed onto victims’ computers that are selected by an unknown logic\ndevised by PROMETHIUM.\n\n**Activity Group Profile: NEODYMIUM**\n\nCampaign summary: NEODYMIUM is an activity group that, like PROMETHIUM,\nconducted an attack campaign in early May 2016. NEODYMIUM also used the\nexact same CVE-2016-4117 exploit code that PROMETHIUM used, prior to public\nknowledge of the vulnerability’s existence.\n\n\n-----\n\nNEODYMIUM used a backdoor detected by Windows Defender as Wingbird,\n[whose characteristics closely match FinFisher, a government-grade commercial](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-072615-4146-99&tabid=2)\nsurveillance package. Data about Wingbird activity indicates that it is typically\nused to attack individuals and individual computers instead of networks.\n\nAdministrators and users wondering whether they were targeted by\nNEODYMIUM can scan their networks by using the indicators listed in the\nappendix, by using Windows Defender to examine their logs for “Wingbird,” or\n[by searching for NEODYMIUM in their Windows Defender Advanced Threat](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/03/01/announcing-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection/)\n[Protection product console alerts.](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/03/01/announcing-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection/)\n\nAttack details: Target individuals were sent customized spear phishing emails.\nAn image of one such customized email from this campaign is shown in the\nfollowing figure.\n\nFigure 12. The spear phishing campaign that NEODYMIUM launched in May 2016 is highly customized to target individuals; a large\nportion of the email has been redacted to protect the privacy of the targeted individual, which shows the extent of personalization of\nthe malicious email\n\nWhen the user opened the attachment, a blank document displayed. In the\nbackground, a series of events, including the use of the CVE-2016-4117 zero-day\nexploit, ultimately led to the download and execution of a backdoor. The exploit\n[code executes only if the Microsoft Office Protected View setting is turned off.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-Protected-View-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653)\nBy default, documents opened from the Internet (using web browsers or email\nclients) are opened in protected view mode, which prevents execution of\nembedded objects and potentially malicious code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. The NEODYMIUM attack chain shows how the exploit CVE-2016-4117 was used to infect target individuals’ computers\n\nThe backdoor payload showed behavior that matched publicly documented\ntraits of a program called FinFisher, a government-grade commercial\nsurveillance package marketed to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n[The publisher, FinFisher GmbH, claims that it sells the software exclusively to](http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/)\ngovernment agencies for use in targeted and lawful criminal investigations. It is\nlikely that the backdoor payload is a relatively new version of the commercial\nspyware.\n\nThe apparent use of a version of FinFisher suggests that the exploit and the\nspear fishing campaign that delivered it were the work of an attack group\nprobably connected in some way to a state actor.\n\nWindows Defender detects the backdoor payload as Wingbird. Visibility into the\nusage of Wingbird shows it has been used only against individuals, not against\ncomputers that are part of an organization’s network.\n\nResearch into Wingbird from May through November 2016 showed only tens of\nvictims, predominantly in Turkey.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. NEODYMIUM victim breakdown, by country for May through November 2016\n\nGermany UK\n\n5% 5%\n\nUS\n6%\n\nTurkey\n\n84%\n\nLike Truvasys, Wingbird is designed to run on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows\nplatforms. The malware is a native 32-bit PE executable that installs a number of\nadditional executables and files. These components are all embedded within the\ndropper itself, which allows the malware to avoid downloading components and\nconsequently attracting attention.\n\nAfter the backdoor executes, the malware checks the underlying operating\nsystem version and, depending on what platform it is running on, drops several\nfiles to %ProgramData%\\RpcSrv (on 32-bit computers) or\n%ProgramData%\\AuditService (on 64-bit computers).\n\nIn addition, on 64-bit computers the dropper creates a secondary native 64-bit\npayload executable, referred to in the following diagram as [Payload64].exe. The\n32-bit processes are isolated from 64-bit processes and restricted in the actions\nthey can perform. By providing a separate 64-bit payload, Wingbird attempts to\ninject code into 64-bit processes as well as 32-bit processes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Wingbird behaves differently on 32-bit computers and 64-bit computers\n\nThe main goal of the original dropper is to indirectly deliver executables by\ninjecting malicious code and data into two Windows system processes,\nServices.exe and Winlogon.exe. The primary Wingbird payload uses anti-VM,\nanti-debugging, and anti-AV mechanisms to evade discovery and analysis.\n\nOn 32-bit computers, the original dropper creates three files, as shown in Figure\n5. Of the three files, the only true binary is rpcsrv.dat, a kernel rootkit that\nenables the attacker to load and run privileged unsigned code. The other two\nfiles, installer.cab and the randomly named [xxxxx].cab, are encrypted data files.\n\nWingbird attempts to detect and evade security products. For example, some of\nthe strings found in running processes, such as avcuf32.dll and <un-wnd%.08x>, indicate that the malware checks for the presence of one of several\nversions of Bitdefender security software.\n\nThrough a series of actions and code injections, the original malware installs the\nrootkit driver, rpcsrv.dat, a non-standard kernel driver. The attackers know that\n64-bit computers are much more secure because they prevent loading of\nunsigned drivers, so they do not even attempt this technique on 64-bit systems.\n[The malware searches for a file called ico_ty23.ico, which is publicly documented](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-072615-4146-99&tabid=2%20)\nas the filename one of the key user mode DLL components of FinFisher.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn 64-bit computers, the installation of Wingbird is a lot more complicated. The\n64-bit version of the original payload creates a new folder,\n%ProgramData%\\AuditService, and copies the Windows system file lsass.exe\nfrom %SystemFolder% into the new folder. At the same time, the payload drops\na malicious file known as sspisrv.dll alongside the copy of lsass.exe. This\nsspisrv.dll file shares its name with a code library that implements several APIs\nthat lsass.exe is designed to import.\n\nFigure 16. Wingbird payload’s behavior on 64-bit computers\n\n[Payload64.exe]\n\n                                             - Drops SSPISRV.dll\n\n[Payload32].exe detects it                     - Copies a clean LSASS.exe The infected services.exe\nexecutes on 64-bit platform and                   - Injects code into winlogon.exe registers a new service using the\n\n[Payload32].exe starts drops [Payload64].exe and services.exe copy of the clean LSASS.exe\n\nup\n\n\\AuditService\\LSASS.exe\n\n[Payload64] Services.exe\n\n\\AuditService\\LSASS.exe\n\nstarts up and loads\n\nSSPISRV.dll\n\n**Vulnerable Digitally** Infected SvcHost.exe\n**Signed Kernel Driver**\n\nSSPISRV.dll\n\nThe implant in the infected SSPISRV.dll injects code into\nSvcHost.exe exploits a vulnerable svchost.exe\n\nkernel driver\n\nThe original 32-bit dropper continues monitoring until the folder and file are\ncreated. After the 64-bit payload is done copying files, its parent process (the\n32-bit dropper) deletes it. The parent process then deletes itself as an attempt to\nhide its tracks and prevent analysis by security professionals.\n\nThe 64-bit malware then injects code into services.exe, the Service Control\nManager, to register a service using a clean lsass.exe that would load the\nmalicious sspisrv.dll, which would then inject malicious code into svchost.exe.\nThe constant delegation of malicious code control from one process to the next\nis a way to hide execution of unwanted code and make it extremely difficult to\ndetect the presence of Wingbird.\n\nThis version of Wingbird has also been observed with the ability to execute\nhighly privileged kernel code by injecting code through vulnerable signed\n\n\n\n[Payload64.exe]\n\n - Drops SSPISRV.dll\n\n - Copies a clean LSASS.exe\n\n - Injects code into winlogon.exe\nand services.exe\n\n\nThe implant in the infected\nSvcHost.exe exploits a vulnerable\n\nkernel driver\n\n\nThe infected services.exe\nregisters a new service using the\n\ncopy of the clean LSASS.exe\n\n\nSSPISRV.dll injects code into\n\nsvchost.exe\n\n\n-----\n\ndrivers. It maintains a list of legitimate yet vulnerable drivers that can be\nexploited to inject and execute kernel code.\n\nIt appears that Wingbird obfuscates its code at source level, rather than binary\nlevel, to evade analysis tools and security solutions.\n\nSimilar to the 32-bit version, this version of Wingbird performs a check for a file\nnamed ico_sf46.ico, which is a known component of FinFisher.\n\n**Mitigation**\n\nStopping zero-day exploits in Windows 10\n\nPROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM both used a zero-day\n\n#### Control Flow\n\nexploit that executed code to download a malicious payload.\n[Protected view, a security feature that was introduced in](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-Protected-View-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653) Guard makes it\nMicrosoft Office 2010, prevents the malicious Flash code more difficult to\n[from loading when the document is opened.

Although the use of the\nsame exploit code could be attributed to a number of coincidences, the timing\nof the campaigns and victim demographics lend credence to the theory that the\ncampaigns were associated.\n\nOne threat family, Wingbird, appears to be a version of a commercially available\ntool sold to organizations conducting lawful interception. Wingbird is a fairly\nadvanced threat family that must have required the authors several months’\nworth of man-hours to generate.

In the second half of the past decade there have been an increasing number of vulnerability disclosures across the entire industry. However, despite the increasing number of disclosures, the number of remote code execution (RCE) and elevation of privilege (EOP) vulnerabilities in Microsoft software has declined significantly. The results of the study suggest that while the risk posed by vulnerabilities appeared to increase in recent years, the actualized risk of exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft software has steadily declined.\n\nIt is impossible to completely prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced\nduring the development of large-scale software projects. As long as human\nbeings write software code, no software is perfect and mistakes that lead to\nimperfections in software will be made. This fact is reflected in the long-term\nindustry vulnerability disclosure data illustrated in Figure 22. Thousands of\nvulnerabilities are publicly disclosed across the industry every year. The 4,512\nvulnerabilities disclosed during the second half of 2014 (2H14) is the largest\nnumber of vulnerabilities disclosed in any half-year period since the Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures system was launched in 1999.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22.

These vulnerabilities represent the\nvulnerabilities in Microsoft software with the highest severity scores and are\ngenerally the vulnerabilities that security and risk professionals are most\nconcerned with.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23.

A series of vulnerability disclosure increases\nacross the industry since the second half of 2011 culminated in the largest\nnumber of vulnerabilities disclosed in any half-year period since the CVE system\nwas launched in 1999, with 4,512 vulnerabilities disclosed during the second half\nof 2014.\n\nDespite these increases, the number of RCE and EOP vulnerabilities in Microsoft\nsoftware for which there was evidence of their being exploited decreased by\nalmost 60% during the same period, and decreased by more than 70% since\n2010. This evidence suggests that although potential risk due to vulnerabilities\n\n\n-----\n\nhas appeared to increase in recent years, the actualized risk caused by exploited\nvulnerabilities in Microsoft software has declined year over year.\n\nNewer software typically has fewer vulnerabilities than older\n\n#### Mitigations such as\n\nsoftware. Newer software that uses mitigations built into the\nWindows platform, such as Address Space Layout ASLR, DEP, and\nRandomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), SEHOP make it\nStructured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP),\nand others, make it harder to successfully exploit harder to\nvulnerabilities that do exist.

Some of the worst vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit the compromised system by causing it to run malicious code without the user’s knowledge.\n\n**Industry-wide vulnerability disclosures**\n\nA disclosure, as the term is used in the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, is\nthe revelation of a software vulnerability to the public at large. Disclosures can\ncome from a variety of sources, including publishers of the affected software,\nsecurity software vendors, independent security researchers, and even malware\ncreators.\n\nThe information in this section is compiled from vulnerability disclosure data that\n[is published in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), the US government’s](http://nvd.nist.gov/)\nrepository of standards-based vulnerability management data at nvd.nist.gov.\nThe NVD represents all disclosures that have a published CVE (Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures) identifier.[5]\n\nFigure 25 illustrates the number of vulnerability disclosures across the software\nindustry for each half-year period since 2H13. (See “Appendix A: Threat naming\nconventions” on page 135 for an explanation of the reporting period\nnomenclature used in this report.)\n\n5 CVE entries are subject to ongoing revision as software vendors and security researchers publish more\ninformation about vulnerabilities. For this reason, the statistics presented here may differ slightly from\ncomparable statistics published in previous volumes of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25. Industrywide vulnerability disclosures, 2H13–1H16\n\n5,000\n\n4,500\n\n4,000\n\n3,500\n\n3,000\n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n2H13 1H14 2H14 1H15 2H15 1H16\n\n       - Vulnerability disclosures across the industry decreased 9.8 percent between\n2H15 and 1H16, to just above 3,000.\n\n       - Prior to the decrease in 1H16, vulnerability disclosures had trended generally\nupward over the past three years, with the exception of a spike in 2H14\ncaused by a research project at the Computer Emergency Response Team\n(CERT) Coordination Center (CERT/CC) that uncovered SSL-related man-inthe-middle vulnerabilities in a large number of Android apps in the Google\nPlay Store.\n\n**Vulnerability severity**\n\nThe Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized, platformindependent scoring system for rating IT vulnerabilities. The CVSS base metric\nassigns a numeric value between 0 and 10 to vulnerabilities based on factors\nsuch as potential impact, access vectors, and ease of exploitation, with higher\n[scores representing greater severity. (See A Complete Guide to the Common](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v2-guide.pdf)\n[Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2.0 at first.org for more information.)](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v2-guide.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 26.

A high-severity vulnerability that can only\nbe exploited under very specific and rare circumstances might require less\nimmediate attention than a lower-severity vulnerability that can be exploited\nmore easily.\n\nThe CVSS assigns each vulnerability a complexity ranking of Low, Medium, or\n[High. (See A Complete Guide to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v2-guide.pdf)\n[Version 2.0 at first.org for more information about the CVSS complexity ranking](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v2-guide.pdf)\nsystem.) Figure 28 shows complexity trends for vulnerabilities disclosed since\n2H13. Note that Low complexity in Figure 28 indicates greater risk, just as High\nseverity indicates greater risk in Figure 26.\n\nFigure 28.

Low-complexity vulnerabilities reversed a\n\n\n-----\n\nmulti-year trend of increases in 1H16, and ended the period with the fewest\nlow-complexity vulnerabilities since 1H14.\n\n- Medium-complexity vulnerabilities accounted for the second largest share,\nat 42.5 percent of all vulnerabilities. After increasing slightly in 2H15,\nmedium-complexity vulnerabilities decreased again in 1H16 to nearly the\nsame number as a year prior.\n\n\n\n- Disclosures of high-complexity vulnerabilities more than\n\n#### Disclosures of\n\ndoubled from 2H15 to 1H16, but still only accounted for\n4.8 percent of all disclosures. high-complexity\n\n**Operating system, browser, and application** vulnerabilities\n**vulnerabilities** more than\n\nComparing vulnerabilities that affect a computer’s operating doubled, but still\nsystem to vulnerabilities that affect other components, such\n\n#### only accounted for\n\nas applications and utilities, requires a determination of\nwhether the affected component is considered part of the 4.8 percent of all\noperating system. This determination is not always simple vulnerabilities.\nand straightforward, given the componentized nature of\nmodern operating systems. Some programs (media players, for example) ship\nby default with some operating system software but can also be downloaded\nfrom the software vendor’s website and installed individually. Linux distributions,\nin particular, are often assembled from components developed by different\nteams, many of which provide crucial operating functions such as a graphical\nuser interface (GUI) or Internet browsing.\n\n\nTo facilitate analysis of operating system and browser vulnerabilities, the\n_Microsoft Security Intelligence Report distinguishes among four different kinds of_\nvulnerabilities:\n\n- Core operating system vulnerabilities are those with at least one operating\nsystem platform enumeration (/o) in the NVD that do not also have any\napplication platform enumerations (/a).[6]\n\n- Operating system application vulnerabilities are those with at least one /o\nplatform enumeration and at least one /a platform enumeration listed in the\nNVD, except as described in the next bullet point.\n\n[6 See nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm for information about the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) standard for](http://nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm)\nnaming information technology systems, software, and packages.\n\n\n-----\n\n       - Browser vulnerabilities are those that affect components defined as part of a\nweb browser, including Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari (which ship with\noperating systems) along with third-party browsers such as Mozilla Firefox\nand Google Chrome.\n\n       - Other application vulnerabilities are those with at least one /a platform\nenumeration in the NVD that do not have any /o platform enumerations,\nexcept as described in the previous bullet point.\n\nFigure 29 shows industrywide vulnerabilities for operating systems, browsers,\nand applications since 2H13.\n\nFigure 29.

Using such a methodology can help reduce the\nnumber and severity of vulnerabilities in software and help manage\nvulnerabilities that might be discovered after deployment.\n\n[“Life in the Digital Crosshairs,” at sdlstory.com, is a multimedia presentation that](http://sdlstory.com/)\nexplores the genesis and development of the SDL from its origins in the\nWindows team’s well-documented all-hands security push in the early 2000s. It\nincludes interviews with several of the pivotal figures in the history of the SDL\n\n\n-----\n\nand Microsoft’s focus on secure software. Security professionals and anyone else\nwith an interest in secure development are likely to find the site invaluable for\nputting the SDL into historical context and understanding what the future holds.\n\n[To learn more about how the SDL is applied in the present day, see “Secure](http://aka.ms/A6offt)\n[Software Development Trends in the Oil & Gas Sectors” at the Microsoft](http://aka.ms/A6offt)\n[Download Center (www.microsoft.com/download) for an example of how the](http://www.microsoft.com/download)\nSDL has helped one critical industry.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Exploits\n\n##### An exploit is a piece of code that uses software vulnerabilities to access information on a computer or install malware. Exploits target vulnerabilities in operating systems, web browsers, applications, or other software components that are installed on a computer. \n\nIn some scenarios, targeted components are add-ons that may be pre-installed\nby the computer manufacturer before the computer is sold. A user may not\neven use the vulnerable add-on or be aware that it is installed. In addition, some\nsoftware has no facility for updating itself, so even if the software vendor\npublishes an update that fixes the vulnerability, the user may not know that the\nupdate is available or how to obtain it and therefore remains vulnerable to\nattack.\n\n\nSoftware vulnerabilities are enumerated and documented in\nthe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list\n[(cve.mitre.org), a standardized repository of vulnerability](http://cve.mitre.org/)\ninformation. Here and throughout this report, exploits are\nlabeled with the CVE identifier that pertains to the affected\nvulnerability, if applicable. In addition, exploits that affect\nvulnerabilities in Microsoft software are labeled with the\nMicrosoft Security Bulletin number that pertains to the\nvulnerability, if applicable.[7]\n\n\n#### Some exploits target add-ons that may be preinstalled by the computer manufacturer.\n\n\nMicrosoft real-time security products can detect and block attempts to exploit\nknown vulnerabilities whether the computer is affected by the vulnerabilities or\n[not. For example, the CVE-2010-2568 CplLnk vulnerability has never affected](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2568)\nWindows 8, but if a Windows 8 user receives a malicious file that attempts to\nexploit that vulnerability, Windows Defender is designed to detect and block it\nanyway. Encounter data provides important information about which products\nand vulnerabilities are being targeted by attackers, and by what means.\nHowever, the statistics presented in this report should not be interpreted as\n\n[7 See technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin to search and read Microsoft Security Bulletins.](http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin)\n\n\n-----\n\nevidence of successful exploit attempts, or of the relative vulnerability of\ncomputers to different exploits.\n\nFigure 31 shows the prevalence of different types of exploits detected by\nMicrosoft antimalware products each quarter from 3Q15 to 2Q16, by encounter\nrate. Encounter rate is the percentage of computers running Microsoft real-time\nsecurity products that report a malware encounter. For example, the encounter\nrate for operating system exploit attempts in 2Q16 was 0.14 percent, meaning\nthat 0.14 percent of computers running Microsoft real-time security software in\n2Q16 encountered operating system exploit attempts, and 99.86 percent did\nnot. In other words, a computer selected at random would have had about a\n0.14 percent chance of encountering an operating system exploit attempt in\n2Q16. Only computers whose users have opted in to provide data to Microsoft\nare considered when calculating encounter rates.[8] See page 71 for more\ninformation about the encounter rate metric.\n\nFigure 31.

When Internet Explorer loads a\nwebpage that includes ActiveX controls, if the security software has\nimplemented IExtensionValidation, the browser calls the security software to\nscan the HTML and script content on the page before loading the controls\nthemselves. If the security software determines that the page is malicious (for\nexample, if it identifies the page as an exploit kit landing page), it can direct\nInternet Explorer to prevent individual controls or the entire page from loading.\n\nFigure 41.

More than three-quarters of Internet-connected personal computers worldwide are protected by real-time security software that constantly monitors the computers and network traffic for threats and blocks them before they can infect the computers, if possible. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the malware landscape requires consideration of infection attempts that are blocked as well as infections that are removed. \n\nMicrosoft uses two different metrics to measure malicious and unwanted\nsoftware prevalence:[19]\n\n- _Encounter rate is simply the percentage of computers running Microsoft_\nreal-time security products that report a malware encounter.[20] For example,\n[the encounter rate for the malware family JS/Axpergle in Canada in 2Q16](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=JS/Axpergle)\nwas 2.7 percent. This data means that, of the computers in Canada that\nwere running Microsoft real-time security software in 2Q16, 2.7 percent\nreported encountering the Axpergle family, and 97.3 percent did not.\nEncountering a threat does not mean the computer has been infected. Only\ncomputers whose users have opted in to provide data to Microsoft are\nconsidered when calculating encounter rates.[21]\n\n19 Microsoft regularly reviews and refines its data collection methodology to improve its scope and accuracy.\nFor this reason, the statistics presented in this volume of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report may differ\nslightly from comparable statistics in previous volumes.\n\n20 Encounter rate does not include threats that are blocked by a web browser before being detected by\nantimalware software. In particular, IExtensionValidation in Internet Explorer 11 enables security software to\nblock pages that contain exploits from loading. (See “Exploit detection with Internet Explorer and\nIExtensionValidation” on page 65 for information about IExtensionValidation and the threats it blocks.) For this\nreason, encounter rate figures may not fully reflect all of the threats encountered by computer users.\n\n21 For information about the products and services that provide data for this report, see “Appendix B: Data\nsources” on page 137.\n\n\n-----\n\n       - _Computers cleaned per mille, or CCM, is an infection rate metric that is_\ndefined as the number of computers cleaned for every 1,000 unique\ncomputers that run the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), a free tool\ndistributed through Microsoft update services that removes more than 200\nhighly prevalent or serious threats from computers. Because it is not a realtime tool, the MSRT only detects and removes threats that are already\npresent on the computer; it does not block infection attempts as they\nhappen.\n\nFigure 44 illustrates the difference between these two metrics.\n\nFigure 44. Worldwide encounter and infection rates, 3Q15–2Q16, by quarter\n\n25% 250\n\n20% 200\n\n15% 150\n\n10% 100\n\n5% 50\n\n0% 0\n\n3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16\n\nEncounter rate Infection rate\n\nAs Figure 44 shows, and as one would expect, encounters are much more\ncommon than infections. On average, about 20.6 percent of reporting\ncomputers worldwide encountered threats over the past four quarters. At the\nsame time, the MSRT removed threats from about 10.1 out of every 1,000\ncomputers, or 1.01 percent. Together, encounter and infection rate information\ncan help provide a broader picture of the threat landscape by offering different\nperspectives on how threats propagate and how computers get infected.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Learning about new threats with cloud-based protection in Windows Defender\n\nSeveral of the threats discussed in this volume of the Security Intelligence Report,\n[such as Win32/Spursint and Win32/Rundas, are identified as cloud-based](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Spursint)\n_detections. These are not true malware families as the term is usually used._\nInstead, they are detections for malicious files that have been automatically\nidentified through the cloud-based protection feature of Windows Defender in\nWindows 10.\n\nWhen cloud-based protection is enabled, Windows Defender queries the cloud\nprotection backend when encountering a suspicious but undetected file. The\nbackend service uses heuristics, machine learning, and automated file analysis to\ndetermine whether the file is malicious. If the cloud protection service\ndetermines that the file is malicious, Windows Defender blocks it, and the service\nuses the information to provide enhanced protection to other users. In many\ncases, this process can reduce the response time when a new threat emerges\nfrom hours to seconds. Some of these automatically identified threats have\nproven to be highly prevalent—Spursint, for example, was the second most\ncommonly encountered malicious software detection in 2Q16, and the fourth\nmost commonly encountered malicious software detection in 1H16 overall. The\nprevalence of these threats serves as a vivid example of the potential for\nincreased protection offered by cloud-based antimalware technologies.\n\nCloud-based protection is enabled by default in the Anniversary Update edition\nof Windows 10. For more information about the feature and guidance for\n[administering it in network environments, see the article “Block at First Sight” at](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/keep-secure/windows-defender-block-at-first-sight)\ntechnet.microsoft.com.\n\n**Malicious and unwanted software worldwide**\n\nThe telemetry data generated by Microsoft security products from computers\nwhose administrators or users choose to opt in to provide data to Microsoft\nincludes information about the location of the computer, as determined by IP\ngeolocation. This data makes it possible to compare infection and encounter\nrates, patterns, and trends in different locations around the world.[22]\n\n[22 For more information about this process, see the entry “Determining the Geolocation of Systems Infected](http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2011/11/15/determining-the-geolocation-of-systems-infected-with-malware/)\n[with Malware” (November 15, 2011) in the Microsoft Cyber Trust Blog (blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust).](http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2011/11/15/determining-the-geolocation-of-systems-infected-with-malware/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 45.

Macoute](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Madang)\n\nis a worm that can spread itself to removable USB drives, and may\n\ncommunicate with a remote host. Madang is a virus that infects .exe and\n\n.scr files, and connects to specific websites to possibly download other\n\nmalware. Encounter rates for Madang were highest in Myanmar and\n\nIndonesia, which together accounted for about three-fourth of all\n\nMadang encounters worldwide.\n\n- Threat families that were unusually common in Vietnam included the\n\n[software bundler Win32/Prepscram (ranked third in Vietnam, 57th](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Prepscram)\n\n[worldwide) and the virus family DOS/Sigru (twelfth in Vietnam, 148th](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=DOS/Sigru)\n\nworldwide). Prepscram is often distributed as a mountable .iso disk file\n\ncontaining a software installer, which installs unwanted software\n\n\n-----\n\nalongside the desired applications. Vietnam accounted for about 20\n\npercent of all Prepscram encounters worldwide in 1H16. Sigru is a virus\n\nthat can stop some files from working correctly in Windows XP and\n\nearlier operating systems. It spreads by infecting the master boot record\n\n(MBR) on connected hard disks and floppy disks. Vietnam accounted for\n\nabout 40 percent of all Sigru encounters worldwide in 1H126, with China\n\naccounting for most of the rest.\n\n         - Threat families that were unusually common in Pakistan included the\n\n[worm families Win32/Ippedo (ranked third in Pakistan, 30th worldwide)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Ippedo)\n\n[and Win32/Nuqel (eighth in Pakistan, 71st worldwide).](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Nuqel)\n\n         - Threat families that were unusually prevalent in Indonesia included the\n\n[virus family Win32/Virut (ranked sixth in Indonesia, 48rd worldwide) and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Virut)\n\n[the worm family Win32/Copali (14th in Indonesia, 145th worldwide).](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Copali)\n\nFigure 49.

The malicious webpages that\nexploit kits use to spread malware often include scripts that detect certain\naspects of the computer’s computing environment and only present their\nexploits to computers that meet criteria specified by the attacker. The Angler\nexploit kit clearly affects Windows 7 far more than other platforms, which\nmay partially be caused by the integration of Adobe Flash Player into\nInternet Explorer in Windows 8 and subsequent versions. The Angler exploit\nkit relies heavily on exploiting vulnerabilities in old, out-of-date versions of\nFlash Player, which must be installed as an add-on and updated separately\nfrom Internet Explorer in versions of Windows prior to Windows 8. Because\nFlash Player is integrated into Internet Explorer in Windows 8 and\nsubsequent versions, it receives security updates through Windows Update\nand Microsoft Update along with other operating system components,\nwhich makes it easier for users to stay current on security updates for the\ncomponent.\n\n|Rank (Overall)|Family|Most significant category|Rank (Win.

Early ransomware families typically displayed\nwhat looked like official warnings from well-known law enforcement agencies,\naccusing the computer user of committing a computer-related crime and\ndemanding that the user pay a fine via electronic money transfer or a virtual\ncurrency such as Bitcoin to regain control of the computer. In recent years,\nmany of the more commonly encountered ransomware families have dropped\nthe pretense of coming from law enforcement: they simply encrypt important\nfiles on the computer and offer to sell the user the private key to decrypt them.\n\n|Rank (Overall)|Family|Most significant category|Rank (Win.

Figure 62\nshows encounter rates for ransomware families by country and region in 2Q16.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 62. Encounter rates for ransomware families by country/region in 2Q16\n\n       - The location with the highest ransomware encounter rate in 2Q16 was Italy\n(0.82 percent), followed by Bulgaria (0.74 percent) and Taiwan (0.67\npercent).\n\n       - Ransomware tends to target countries and regions that otherwise have\nrelatively low infection rates. Italy, with the highest ransomware infection\nrate in the world, had an overall encounter rate of 18.8 percent in 2Q16,\nlower than the worldwide encounter rate of 21.2 percent. South Africa, with\nthe fourth highest ransomware encounter rate in the world in 2Q16, had the\nlowest overall infection rate in Africa during the same period.\n\nFigure 63 displays encounter rate trends for several of the most commonly\nencountered ransomware families worldwide.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 63.

It encrypts more than 180 different\ntypes of file by extension, and displays a demand for payment in Bitcoins to\nbe paid to a dark website accessible via Tor. Encounter rates for Tescrypt\nwere highest in Bulgaria (0.13 percent in 2Q16), Korea\n(0.13 percent), and Italy (0.12 percent). In May of 2016, the Win32/Locky enTescrypt authors announced that they were ceasing crypts and remains\noperations and released the Tescrypt master key to the\n\n#### the victim’s files,\n\npublic.\n\n- [Win32/Locky was the second most commonly](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Locky) and then replaces\nencountered ransomware family worldwide in 1H16. the desktop\nEncounter rates were highest in South Africa (0.13\n\n#### background with a\n\npercent in 2Q16), Croatia (0.09 percent), and\nLuxembourg (0.09 percent). First detected in February demand for\n2016, Locky is typically downloaded to computers via payment.\n[threats like JS/Nemucod and O97M/Donoff, which are](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=JS/Nemucod)\nspread by spam email messages, and by exploit kits such as Neutrino and\nRIG. After encrypting and renaming a victim’s files, Locky replaces the\ncomputer’s desktop background with a demand for payment in Bitcoins,\nand instructions for transmitting the payment to the attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 64. Desktop background and web page used by Win32/Locky\n\nLocky searches for and encrypts more than 450 different types of file by\nextension. It is typically configured to avoid computers located in Russia or\nwhich use the Russian language, which gives a clue to its origins: attackers\noften try not to infect computers located in their home country or region, in\nan effort to avoid drawing attention from local authorities. Locky has been\nrevised several times since its discovery in February to add code\nobfuscation, offline encryption, and other features. The Locky authors\nappear to use affiliates to distribute it, based on the presence of affiliate IDs\nfound in the malware.\n\nFor additional information about Locky, see the following entry in the MMPC\nblog (blogs.technet.com/mmpc):\n\n         - [The new .LNK between spam and Locky infection (October 19, 2016)](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2016/10/19/the-new-lnk-between-spam-and-locky-infection/)\n\n       - [Win32/Cerber is another new ransomware family, which is often spread via](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Cerber)\nthe RIG (Meadgive) and Magnitude (Pangimop) exploit kits. Cerber is a\nransomware-as-a-service family, sold to prospective attackers by its creators\nand designed to be easy to use by novices. Encounter rates for Cerber were\nhighest in Qatar (0.10 percent in 2Q16), the Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia (0.09 percent), and Bosnia and Herzegovina (0.09 percent).\n\n\n-----\n\n- [Win32/Crowti (known as “CryptoWall” and “CryptoDefense”), the most](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/search.aspx?query=Win32/Crowti)\ncommonly encountered ransomware family worldwide in 2H15, declined to\nmuch lower levels in 1H16 as its authors stopped actively distributing it. First\ndetected in late 2013, Crowti is a file encrypting ransomware family that\ntypically spreads through spam or is installed by downloader malware and\nexploits.\n\nMicrosoft recommends that victims of ransomware infections not pay the socalled fine. Ransomware is distributed by malicious attackers, not legitimate\nauthorities, and paying the ransom is no guarantee that the attacker will restore\nthe affected computer to a usable state. Microsoft provides free tools and\n[utilities, such as the Microsoft Safety Scanner and Windows Defender Offline,](http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/)\nthat can help remove a variety of malware infections even if the computer’s\nnormal operation is being blocked.\n\nSee “Ransomware Protection in Windows 10 Anniversary Update” at\n[https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=837485 for information about new](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=837485)\nfeatures designed to fight ransomware in the latest release of Windows 10, and\n[visit www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/ransomware.aspx for](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/ransomware.aspx)\nmore information about ransomware and how computer users can avoid being\ntaken advantage of by this type of threat.\n\n**Threats from targeted attackers**\n\nAlthough using a real-time security software product from a reputable vendor\nand keeping the detection signatures up-to-date remains one of the best ways\nindividuals and organizations can protect themselves against known threats,\nconventional antimalware software is often less effective against advanced\nattacks, such as those conducted by targeted attack groups. These groups,\nwhich focus on targeting computers at specific institutions, often use specially\ncrafted threats that they test against popular antimalware solutions ahead of\ntime to ensure that they will not be detected. By the time detection signatures\nare available to stop such a threat, it may have already compromised the\norganization. To help organizations combat such attacks, Office 365 Advanced\nThreat Protection, available with select Office 365 plans, provides an additional\nlayer of defense against threats and malicious links that have never been\nencountered before.\n\nWhen an incoming message includes a potentially dangerous attached file,\nOffice 365 Advanced Threat Protection launches it in a detonation chamber—a\n\n\n-----\n\nvirtual sandboxed environment in which potential threats can run without\nposing harm to any other resources—and monitors it for suspicious behavior\nsuch as registry changes, attempts to access memory dumps, changes to\nexecutables, and other actions that malware characteristically takes. This\nmonitoring makes it possible to detect and block threats that have never been\nseen before and for which no detection signatures are available. Some\nadvanced threats avoid taking malicious actions when they determine they are\nbeoing run in a virtual machine. Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection includes\nanti-sandbox detection features to combat this behavior.\n\nFigure 65.

Of these,\nthe most common file extensions were .doc, used for the binary file format\nused in Word 97-2003, and .docm, used for Word documents that contain\nmacros.\n\n- JavaScript files accounted for the second largest type of file, at 30.6 percent\nof the total. JavaScript files also accounted for the overwhelming majority of\nmalicious files contained within .zip files. Overall, about 70 percent of .js files\nattached to email messages were determined to be malicious, whether in a\ncontainer file or not.\n\n- Executable files accounted for the third largest share of malicious files, at\n18.6 percent of the total. This type includes the familiar .exe extension used\nby most executable programs in Windows, along with a number of other\nextensions, such as .scr, .com, .pif, and .cpl. Executable files can provide an\nattacker with an easy way to compromise a computer without relying on\nexploiting a vulnerability, but most enterprise email servers and programs\nare configured to block them by default.\n\n- Microsoft Excel and URL files each accounted for a small percentage of the\ntotal.\n\n\n-----\n\n- Other file types accounted for 13.8 percent of the total. Some of the more\ncommon file extensions here were .eml, used by Microsoft Outlook to save\nemail messages to disk; .wsf, used by the Windows Script Host; and .jar, a\npackage format used for Java files.\n\n- PDF files, which have historically been a popular method for sending\nmalware to targeted victims, accounted for only 0.9 percent of malicious file\ndetections, as attackers have moved from embedding malware directly in\nPDF files to sending clean PDFs that contain links to malicious URLs. (See\npage 111 for information about malicious websites.)\n\n\nAs Figure 67 demonstrates, the file types used for advanced threats changes\nsignificantly from month to month, as targeted attack groups shift between\ndifferent victims and tactics.\n\nFigure 67.

Microsoft security products classify unwanted software\nas threats, and block or remove them when they are encountered.\n\nSome programs don’t meet the criteria to be considered unwanted software but\nstill exhibit behaviors that may be considered undesirable, particularly in\n[enterprise environments. Microsoft classifies these programs as potentially](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2015/11/25/shields-up-on-potentially-unwanted-applications-in-your-enterprise/)\n_[unwanted applications (PUA). For example, a program that displays additional](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2015/11/25/shields-up-on-potentially-unwanted-applications-in-your-enterprise/)_\nadvertisements in the browser might not be classified as unwanted software if it\nclearly identifies itself as the source of the ads, but may be considered\npotentially unwanted. Users often end up installing these programs because\nthey were installing an application that they wanted, and the installer offered to\ninstall additional software—usually with the offer acceptance checked by default\nand often without the user realizing they are agreeing to install the additional\nsoftware. These programs can also cause problems for network\nadministrators—they can affect computer performance, increase the workload\nfor the IT help desk, put computers and data at risk of being compromised\nthrough exploits, and make it more difficult to identify malware infections\namong the noise. To provide organizations with additional options for dealing\nwith programs classified as PUA, Microsoft offers enterprise users of System\nCenter Endpoint Protection (SCEP) the ability to block them from being installed\non their networks.\n\nPUA statistics\n\nFigure 68 shows the PUA families blocked most often by SCEP in 2Q16.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 68.

Average security software protection state for the locations with the most computers executing the MSRT in 1H16\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\n- All of the locations in Figure 72 reported at least 80 percent of computers\nprotected by real-time security software in 1H16, ranging from 83.8 percent\nin Russia to 91.5 percent in Germany.\n\n- In addition, all of these locations except Russia exceeded the worldwide\naverage protection rate in 2H16.\n\nThe rate of security software usage in a country or region often correlates with\nits infection rate. Figure 73 shows the percentage of computers in different\ncountries and regions that reported being protected in 2Q16.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 73. Average monthly percent of computers reporting security software enabled in 2Q16, by country/region\n\n       - The locations with the highest percentage of computers reporting as\nprotected by real-time security software include Finland, with an average of\n93.9 percent each month in 2Q16; Denmark, at 92.3 percent; and Norway, at\n92.2 percent.\n\n       - Locations with the fewest computers reporting as fully protected include\nLibya, at 68.0 percent; Kyrgyzstan, at 77.3 percent; and Algeria, at 78.5\npercent.\n\nCountries and regions with high percentages of computers reporting as fully\nunprotected also tend to have high infection rates, as Figure 74 shows.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 74.

Average monthly security software protection state for supported client versions of Windows in 1H16, by quarter\n\n30%\n\n25%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n0%\n\nWindows Vista Windows 7 Windows 8* Windows 10 TH1 Windows 10 TH2\n\n- Includes Windows 8.1\n\n       - In general, computers running newer versions of Windows tended to report\nbeing unprotected less often than computers running older versions.\n\n       - The high rate of protection with Windows 10 is primarily because of a\nchange in the way Windows Defender operates. To provide Windows 10\nusers with protection from malware out of the box, Windows Defender is\nautomatically activated upon installation of Windows 10 if no other real-time\nsecurity product is installed, as opposed to a few days after installation in\nWindows 8 and Windows 8.1.\n\nThe reasons computers go unprotected can vary significantly by platform, as\nFigure 76 illustrates.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 76. Computers running supported client versions of Windows reporting statuses other than Protected in 1H16\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\nWindows Vista* Windows 7* Windows 8 Windows 8.1\n\nNo AV installed Off Out of date Expired Snoozed\n\n- Windows Vista and Windows 7 do not report expired subscriptions.\n\n- On Windows Vista and Windows 7, unprotected computers predominantly\nreport having no antimalware software installed at all. On subsequent\nWindows versions, Windows Defender is enabled by default if no other\nantimalware software is present, so the number of computers reporting no\nantimalware software is very low.\n\n- On Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, expired versions of commercial\nantimalware products that are no longer receiving signature updates\naccount for the largest percentage of unprotected computers.\n\n- On Windows 10, out-of-date signatures were the most common reason\ncomputers lacked protection. Expired subscriptions accounted for a very low\npercentage of unprotected computers running Windows 10, possibly\nreflecting both increased use of Windows Defender and new computers\nwith pre-installed trial subscriptions of commercial antimalware products\nthat had yet to expire during the period. Computers on which real-time\nmonitoring had been temporarily turned off, or “snoozed,” accounted for\nthe second highest share.\n\n**Guidance: Defending against malware**\n\nEffectively protecting users from malware requires an active effort on the part of\n[organizations and individuals. For in-depth guidance, see Help prevent malware](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/prevention.aspx)\n\n\n-----\n\n[infection on your PC at the Microsoft Malware Protection Center website at](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/prevention.aspx)\nwww.microsoft.com/mmpc.\n\nFor help understanding the threats that pose the greatest risk to your\n[environment and how to defend against them, see “Fixing the #1 Problem in](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Fixing-the-1-Problem-in-2e58ac4a)\n[Computer Security: A Data-Driven Defense,” available from Microsoft TechNet.](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Fixing-the-1-Problem-in-2e58ac4a)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malicious websites\n\n##### Attackers often use websites to conduct phishing attacks or distribute malware. To help protect users from malicious webpages, Microsoft and other browser vendors have developed filters that keep track of sites that host malware and phishing attacks and display prominent warnings when users try to navigate to them. \n\nMalicious websites often appear to be completely legitimate, and provide no\noutward indicators of their malicious nature even to experienced computer\nusers. In many cases, these sites are legitimate websites that have been\ncompromised by malware, SQL injection, or other techniques in efforts by\nattackers to take advantage of the trust users have invested in such sites. In\nother cases, attackers run their own sites and use social engineering to draw in\ntraffic.\n\nThe information in this section is compiled from a variety of sources, including\n[telemetry data produced by SmartScreen Filter in Internet Explorer versions 8](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/12/16/smartscreen-drive-by-improvements/)\nthrough 11 and Microsoft Edge, from a database of known active phishing and\nmalware hosting sites reported by users of Internet Explorer and other Microsoft\nproducts and services, and from malware data provided by Microsoft\nantimalware technologies. (See “Appendix B: Data sources” on page 137 for\nmore information about the products and services that provided data for this\nreport.)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 77. SmartScreen Filter in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer blocks reported phishing and malware\ndistribution sites to protect users\n\n**Phishing sites**\n\nMicrosoft gathers information about phishing sites and impressions from\n_phishing impressions that are_ generated by users who choose to enable\nSmartScreen Filter.[25] A phishing impression is a single instance of a user\nattempting to visit a known phishing site with SmartScreen Filter enabled and\nbeing warned, as illustrated in Figure 78.\n\n25 See “Appendix B: Data sources” on page 137 for privacy statements and other information about the\nproducts and services used to provide data for this report.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 78. How Microsoft tracks phishing impressions\n\nFigure 79 illustrates the volume of phishing impressions tracked by SmartScreen\nFilter each month in 1H16, compared to the volume of distinct phishing URLs\nvisited.\n\nFigure 79. Phishing sites and impressions reported by SmartScreen Filter each month in 1H16, relative to the monthly average for\neach\n\n\n-----\n\n       - The numbers of active phishing sites and impressions rarely correlate\nstrongly with each other. Phishers sometimes engage in campaigns that\ntemporarily drive more traffic to each phishing page without necessarily\nincreasing the total number of active phishing pages they maintain at the\nsame time. Nevertheless, both sites and impressions remained remarkably\nstable throughout 1H16, with neither one varying more than about 5 percent\nfrom the period average.\n\nTarget institutions\n\nSome types of sites tend to consistently draw many more impressions per site\nthan others. Figure 80 shows the breakdown of phishing impressions by\ncategory as reported by SmartScreen Filter.\n\nFigure 80. Phishing sites and impressions reported by SmartScreen Filter for each type of phishing site in 1H16\n\n50%\n\n45%\n\n40%\n\n35%\n\n30%\n\n25% Sites\n\nImpressions\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n0%\n\nOnline Services Financial Sites E-Commerce Social Networking Gaming\n\n       - Phishing sites that targeted online services received the largest share of\nimpressions during the period, and accounted for the largest number of\nactive phishing URLs.\n\n       - Financial institutions have always been popular phishing targets because of\ntheir potential for providing direct illicit access to victims’ bank accounts.\nSites that targeted financial institutions accounted for the second largest\nshare of both attacks and impressions.\n\n\n-----\n\n- The other three categories each accounted for a small percentage of both\nsites and impressions.\n\nGlobal distribution of phishing sites and clients\n\nPhishing impression information from SmartScreen Filter includes anonymized\ninformation about the IP addresses of the clients making the reports, as well as\nthe IP addresses of the phishing sites themselves. Performing geographic\nlookups on these addresses makes it possible to analyze patterns among both\nthe computers that host phishing sites and the users that they target.\n\nFigure 81. Phishing sites per 1,000 Internet hosts for locations around the world in 1H16\n\n- SmartScreen Filter detected 9.1 phishing sites per 1,000 Internet hosts\nworldwide in 1H16.\n\n- Locations hosting higher than average concentrations of phishing sites\ninclude Ukraine (18.8 per 1,000 Internet hosts in 1H16), South Africa (15.4),\nand Australia (14.5). Locations with low concentrations of phishing sites\ninclude Taiwan (1.5), Korea (2.0), and China (2.8).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 82. Phishing impressions by client location per 1,000,000 pageviews in in 1H16\n\n       - SmartScreen Filter reported 17.8 phishing attempts per 1,000,000 pageviews\nin 1H16.\n\n       - Locations with unusually high rates of phishing impressions included Nigeria\n(74.2 phishing impressions per 1,000 pageviews in 1H16), South Africa (62.6),\nand Spain (57.7).\n\n       - Locations with unusually low rates of phishing impressions include Korea (1.1\nimpressions per 1,000,000 pageviews in 1H16), China (1.6), and Russia (2.2).\n\n**Malware hosting sites**\n\nSmartScreen Filter helps provide protection against sites that are known to host\nmalware, in addition to phishing sites. SmartScreen Filter uses file and URL\nreputation data and Microsoft antimalware technologies to determine whether\nsites distribute unsafe content. As with phishing sites, Microsoft collects\nanonymized data regarding how many people visit each malware hosting site\nand uses the information to improve SmartScreen Filter and to better combat\nmalware distribution.\n\nFigure 83. SmartScreen Filter in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer displays a warning when a user attempts to download an\nunsafe file\n\nFigure 84 compares the volume of active malware hosting sites in the Microsoft\ndatabase each month with the volume of malware impressions tracked.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 84. Malware hosting sites and impressions tracked each month in 1H16, relative to the monthly average for each\n\n180%\n\n160%\n\n140%\n\n120%\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\nJanuary February March April May June\n\n- Monthly malware impressions more than tripled from January to June due\nto several factors, including aggressive campaigns by attackers and\nimproved detection and classification by SmartScreen Filter. In 2015, the\nMMPC updated its malware evaluation criteria to include ads that are\ndeceptive and misleading, which are now classified as malware by\nSmartScreen Filter and blocked. Over the past year, the volume of ads that\nmeet these criteria has increased, including an emerging subset designed to\ntake advantage of users seeking technical support.\n\nGlobal distribution of malware hosting sites and clients\n\nFigure 85 and Figure 86 show the geographic distribution of malware hosts and\ncomputers reporting impressions in 1H16.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 85. Malware distribution sites per 1,000 Internet hosts for locations around the world in 1H16\n\n       - SmartScreen Filter detected 36.8 malware hosting sites per 1,000 Internet\nhosts worldwide in 1H16.\n\n       - China, which had a lower than average concentration of phishing sites (2.8\nphishing sites per 1,000 Internet hosts in 1H16), also had a high\nconcentration of malware hosting sites (59.6 malware hosting sites per 1,000\nhosts in 1H16). Other locations with large concentrations of malware hosting\nsites included Vietnam (60.8), Ukraine (53.8), and Thailand (49.4). Locations\nwith low concentrations of malware hosting sites included Finland (14.8),\nAustria (16.2), and Sweden (16.4).\n\nFigure 86. Malware impressions by client location per 1,000,000 pageviews in in 1H16\n\n\n-----\n\n- Malware impressions were much more common than phishing impressions\nin 1H16. SmartScreen Filter reported 769.7 malware impressions per\n1,000,000 pageviews during the period, compared to 17.8 phishing attempts\nper 1,000,000 pageviews.\n\n- Locations that were heavily affected by malware impressions included\nIreland (3,228.9 malware impressions per 1,000,000 pageviews in 1H16),\nSaudi Arabia (3,110.5), and the United Arab Emirates (2,046.2).\n\n- Locations with unusually low malware impression rates included Korea\n(112.0), Japan (206.9), and Slovenia (311.3).\n\n**Drive-by download sites**\n\nA drive-by download site is a website that hosts one or more exploits that target\nvulnerabilities in web browsers and browser add-ons. Users with vulnerable\ncomputers can be infected with malware simply by visiting such a website, even\nwithout attempting to download anything.\n\nDrive-by download pages are usually hosted on legitimate websites to which an\nattacker has posted exploit code. Attackers gain access to legitimate sites\nthrough intrusion or by posting malicious code to a poorly secured web form,\nlike a comment field on a blog. Compromised sites can be hosted anywhere in\nthe world and concern nearly any subject imaginable, making it difficult for even\nan experienced user to identify a compromised site from a list of search results.\n\nFigure 87. One example of a drive-by download attack\n\n\n-----\n\nSearch engines such as Bing have taken a number of measures to help protect\nusers from drive-by downloads. As Bing indexes webpages, they are assessed\nfor malicious elements or malicious behavior. Because the owners of\ncompromised sites are usually victims themselves, the sites are not removed\nfrom the Bing index. Instead, clicking the link in the list of search results displays\na prominent warning, saying that the page may contain malicious software, as\nshown in Figure 88.\n\nFigure 88. A drive-by download warning from Bing\n\nFigure 89 shows the concentration of drive-by download pages in countries and\nregions throughout the world at the end of 1Q16 and 2Q16, respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 89. Drive-by download pages indexed by Bing at the end of 1Q16 (top) and 2Q16 (bottom), per 1,000 URLs in each\ncountry/region\n\n- Each map shows the concentration of drive-by download URLs tracked by\nBing in each country or region on a reference date at the end of the\nassociated quarter, expressed as the number of drive-by download URLs\nper every 1,000 URLs hosted in the country/region.\n\n- Significant locations with high concentrations of drive-by download URLs in\nboth quarters include Taiwan, with 7.4 drive-by URLs for every 1,000 URLs\ntracked by Bing at the end of 2Q16; Mongolia, with 3.1; and Iran, with 2.6.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Guidance: Protecting users from unsafe websites**\n\nOne of the best ways organizations can protect their users from malicious and\ncompromised websites is by mandating the use of web browsers with\nappropriate protection features built in and by promoting safe browsing\npractices. For in-depth guidance, see “Top security solutions” at\n[www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/pc-security/solutions.aspx.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/pc-security/solutions.aspx)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware at Microsoft: Dealing with threats in the Microsoft environment\n\n_Microsoft IT_\n\n_Microsoft IT provides information technology services internally for Microsoft_\n_employees and resources. Microsoft IT manages more than 600,000 devices for_\n_more than 150,000 users across more than 100 countries and regions worldwide._\n_Safeguarding a computing infrastructure of this size requires implementation of_\n_strong security policies, technology to help keep malware off the network and_\n_away from mission-critical resources, and dealing with malware outbreaks swiftly_\n_and comprehensively when they occur._\n\nThis section of the report compares the potential impact of malware to the levels\nof antimalware compliance from more than 600,000 workstation computers and\ndevices managed by Microsoft IT between January and June 2016. This data is\ncompiled from multiple sources, including Windows Defender, System Center\nEndpoint Protection (SCEP), Windows Event Forwarding (WEF), DirectAccess,\nforensics, and manual submission of suspicious files. Comparing the nature and\nvolume of the malware detected on these computers to the level of protection\nthey receive can illustrate significant trends and provide insights as to the\neffectiveness of antimalware software and security best practices.\n\n**Antimalware usage**\n\nReal-time antimalware software is required on all user devices that connect to\nthe Microsoft corporate network. Windows Defender and System Center\nEndpoint Protection 2012 (SCEP) are the antimalware solutions that Microsoft IT\ndeploys to its users. To be considered compliant with antimalware policies and\nstandards, user computers must be running the latest version of the Defender or\nSCEP client, antimalware signatures must be no more than six days old, and\nreal-time protection must be enabled.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 90 shows the level of antimalware compliance in the Microsoft user\nworkstation environment for each month in 1H16.\n\nFigure 90. Percentage of computers at Microsoft running real-time antimalware software each month in 1H16\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\nJanuary February March April May June\n\nThe average monthly compliance rate at Microsoft exceeded 97.8 percent each\nmonth during the first half of the year, reaching a high of 98.8 percent in June. In\nany network of this size, it is almost inevitable that a small number of computers\nwill be in a noncompliant state at any given time. In most cases, these are\ncomputers that are being rebuilt or are otherwise in a state of change when\nonline, rather than computers that have had their antimalware software\nintentionally disabled.\n\nMicrosoft IT believes that a compliance rate in excess of 97.8 percent among\napproximately half a million computers is an acceptable level of compliance. In\nmost cases, attempting to boost a large organization’s compliance rate the rest\nof the way to 100 percent will likely be a costly endeavor, and the end result—\n100 percent compliance—will be unsustainable over time.\n\n**Malware detections**\n\nFigure 91 shows the categories of malicious and unwanted software that were\nmost frequently detected at Microsoft in 1H16.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 91. Top categories of malicious and unwanted software detected by Windows Defender and System Center Endpoint\nProtection at Microsoft in 1H16\n\n900,000\n\n800,000\n\n700,000\n\n600,000\n\n500,000\n\n400,000\n\n300,000\n\n200,000\n\n100,000\n\n0\n\nPUA Trojans Exploits Browser Downloaders & Worms Viruses Software Other Malware\nModifiers Droppers Bundlers\n\nIn this section, malware detections are defined as files and processes flagged by\nSCEP, regardless of the success or failure of automated containment or\nremediation. Malware detections are a measure of attempted malware activity,\nand do not necessarily indicate that a computer has been successfully infected.\n(Note that the methodology for assessing encounters used elsewhere in this\nreport counts unique computers with detections, an approach that differs from\nthe methodology used in this section, in which individual detections are\ncounted. For example, if a computer encountered one trojan family in February\nand another one in June, it would only be counted once for the purposes of\nfigures such as Figure 51 on page 82. In the preceding Figure 91, it would be\ncounted twice, once for each detection.)\n\nPotentially unwanted applications (PUA) accounted for the largest number of\ndetections, with twice as many detections as the next most prevalent category.\nThe large number of PUA detections is the result of Microsoft using the new PUAblocking features in System Center Endpoint Protection to keep such programs\nout of enterprise networks. (See “Potentially unwanted applications in the\nenterprise” on page 101 for more information about this feature.)\n\nFigure 92 shows the top 10 file types among threat detections at Microsoft in\n1H16.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 92. Top ten file types used by threats detected at Microsoft in 1H16\n\n900,000\n\n800,000\n\n700,000\n\n600,000\n\n500,000\n\n400,000\n\n300,000\n\n200,000\n\n100,000\n\n0\n\n.exe .temp .dll .lnk .tmp .html .inf .txt .com .tbl\n\nExecutable program files with the .exe extension were the most commonly\ndetected type of malicious file at Microsoft in 1H16. Malicious files with the .temp\nextension, typically used for temporary files, were the next most common type\nof threats, followed by .dll.\n\nTransmission vectors\n\nExamining the processes targeted by malware can help illustrate the methods\nthat attackers use to propagate it. Figure 93 lists the top five transmission\nvectors used by the malware encountered at Microsoft in 1H16.\n\nFigure 93. The top five transmission vectors used by malware encountered at Microsoft in 1H16\n\n**Rank** **Process Description**\n\n1 File transfers in operating system\n\n2 Cloud backup/storage\n\n3 Web browsing\n\n4 Non-operating-system tasks\n\n5 Developing tools\n\nThe transmission vector most commonly used by infection attempts detected on\nMicrosoft computers in 1H16 involved file transfers made through File Explorer,\n\n|Rank|Process Description|\n|---|---|\n|1|File transfers in operating system|\n|2|Cloud backup/storage|\n|3|Web browsing|\n|4|Non-operating-system tasks|\n|5|Developing tools|\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowed by cloud backup and storage services and web browsing. Nonoperating-system tasks were fourth, followed by developing tools.\n\n**Malware infections**\n\n\nBecause almost all of the computers at Microsoft run real-time security software\nat all times, most infection attempts are detected and blocked before they are\nable to infect the target computer. When Defender or SCEP do disinfect a\ncomputer, it is usually because the software’s signature database has been\nupdated to enable it to detect a threat that it did not recognize when the\ncomputer first encountered the threat. This lack of recognition may be because\nthe threat is a new malware family, a new variant of a known family, a known\nvariant that has been encrypted or otherwise repackaged to avoid detection, or\nbecause of some other reason. The MMPC constantly analyzes malware\nsamples submitted to it, develops appropriate detection signatures, and deploys\nthem to customers who use SCEP, Microsoft Security Essentials, and Windows\nDefender.\n\nFigure 94 shows the most commonly detected categories of malicious and\nunwanted software that SCEP and Defender removed from computers at\nMicrosoft in 1H16.\n\n\nFigure 94. Infections and removals at Microsoft in 1H16, by category\n\n\n80\n\n70\n\n\n60\n\n50\n\n\n40\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n\nDownloaders &\n\nDroppers\n\n\nWorms Trojans Password Stealers &\n\nMonitoring Tools\n\n\nOther Malware\n\n\n-----\n\nAs this chart shows, detection and infection statistics were significantly different\nin 1H16. For example, exploits, which accounted for more than 300,000\ndetections at Microsoft in 1H16, was not discovered infecting a single computer\ninternally during the period. Most of the other categories also show clear\ndifferences between Figure 91 and Figure 94, although the ordering in the latter\nchart is significantly influenced by the low volumes involved.\n\n\nFigure 95 shows the top 10 file types used by malware to infect computers at\nMicrosoft in 1H16.\n\nFigure 95. Infections and removals at Microsoft in 1H16, by file type\n\n\n50\n\n45\n\n\n40\n\n35\n\n\n30\n\n25\n\n\n20\n\n15\n\n\n10\n\n5\n\n\n0\n\n\n.doc .js .exe .dll .html .cin .docm .docx .dxn .html .jpg .scr\n\n\nFigure 95 is important because it provides information about threats that\nDefender and SCEP did not detect when they were first encountered—and\ntherefore provides a clue about the areas in which malware authors have been\nfocusing their efforts in recent months. Almost half of the malicious files\nremoved from computers at Microsoft by Defender and SCEP in 1H16 had the\nextension .doc, used for Microsoft Word binary files. The .js extension used by\nJavaScript script files was next, followed by malicious .exe files. Nine extensions\naccounted for the remaining files, with seven extensions accounting for a single\nfile each.\n\n\n-----\n\n**What IT departments can do to protect their users**\n\n- Evaluate commercially available management tools, develop a plan, and\nimplement a third-party update mechanism to disseminate non-Microsoft\nupdates.\n\n- Ensure that all software deployed on computers in the environment is\nupdated regularly.

The Microsoft malware naming convention\n\nWhen Microsoft analysts research a particular threat, they will determine what\neach of the components of the name will be.\n\n**Type**\n\nThe type describes what the threat does on a computer. Worms, trojans, and\nviruses are some of the most common types of threats Microsoft detects.\n\n**Platform**\n\nThe platform refers to the operating system (such as Windows, Mac OS X, and\nAndroid) that the threat is designed to work on. Platforms can also include\nprogramming languages and file formats.\n\n**Family**\n\nA group of threats with the same name is known as a family. Sometimes\ndifferent security software companies use different names.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Variant letters**\n\nVariant letters are used sequentially for each different version or member of a\nfamily. For example, the detection for the variant “.AF” would have been created\nafter the detection for the variant “.AE.”\n\n**Additional information**\n\nAdditional information is sometimes used to describe a specific file or\ncomponent that is used by another threat in relation to the identified threat. In\nthe preceding example, the !lnk indicates that the threat is a shortcut file used by\nthe Backdoor:Win32/Caphaw.D variant, as shortcut files usually use the\nextension .lnk.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B: Data sources\n\nData included in the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report is gathered from a\nwide range of Microsoft products and services whose users have opted in to\nprovide usage data. The scale and scope of this telemetry data allows the report\nto deliver the most comprehensive and detailed perspective on the threat\nlandscape that is available in the software industry:\n\n- [Azure Security Center is a service that helps organizations prevent, detect,](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/security-center/)\nand respond to threats by providing increased visibility into the security of\ncloud workloads and using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to\ndetect attacks.\n\n- [Bing, the search and decision engine from Microsoft, contains technology](http://www.bing.com/)\nthat performs billions of webpage scans per year to seek out malicious\ncontent. After such content is detected, Bing displays warnings to users\nabout it to help prevent infection.\n\n- [Exchange Online is the Microsoft-hosted email service for business.](https://products.office.com/exchange/exchange-online)\nExchange Online antimalware and antispam services scan billions of\nmessages every year to identify and block spam and malware.\n\n- [The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) is a free tool that Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/pc-security/malware-removal.aspx)\ndesigned to help identify and remove specific prevalent malware families\nfrom customer computers. The MSRT is primarily released as an important\nupdate through Windows Update, Microsoft Update, and Automatic\nUpdates. A version of the tool is also available from the Microsoft Download\nCenter. The MSRT was downloaded and executed more than 600 million\ntimes each month on average in 1H16. The MSRT is not a replacement for an\nup-to-date real-time antivirus solution.\n\n- [The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that](http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner)\nprovides on-demand scanning and helps remove malware and other\nmalicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for an\nup-to-date antivirus solution, because it does not offer real-time protection\nand cannot prevent a computer from becoming infected.\n\n- [Microsoft Security Essentials is a free, easy-to-download real-time](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-all-versions)\nprotection product that provides basic, effective antivirus and antispyware\nprotection for Windows Vista and Windows 7.\n\n\n-----\n\n- [Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection (formerly Forefront Client](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh508836.aspx)\nSecurity and Forefront Endpoint Protection) is a unified product that\nprovides protection from malware and unwanted software for enterprise\ndesktops, laptops, and server operating systems. It uses the Microsoft\nMalware Protection Engine and the Microsoft antivirus signature database\nto provide real-time, scheduled, and on-demand protection.\n\n- [Office 365 is the Microsoft Office subscription service for business and home](http://products.office.com/business)\nusers.

service provider to verify that the holder of the\ncredentials is authorized to access an account. Account credentials typically take\nthe form of user names paired with passwords, but other forms of identification\nare possible.\n\n**ActiveX control**\nA software component of Microsoft Windows that can be used to create and\ndistribute small applications through Internet Explorer. ActiveX controls can be\ndeveloped and used by software to perform functions that would otherwise not\nbe available using typical Internet Explorer capabilities. Because ActiveX controls\ncan be used to perform a wide variety of functions, including downloading and\nrunning programs, vulnerabilities discovered in them may be exploited by\nmalware. In addition, cybercriminals may also develop their own ActiveX\ncontrols, which can do damage to a computer if a user visits a webpage that\ncontains the malicious ActiveX control.\n\n**Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**\nA security feature in recent versions of Windows that randomizes the memory\nlocations used by system files and other programs, which makes it harder for an\nattacker to exploit the system by targeting specific memory locations.\n\n**adware**\nA program that displays advertisements. Although some adware can be\nbeneficial by subsidizing a program or service, other adware programs may\ndisplay advertisements without adequate consent.\n\n**ASLR**\nSee Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).\n\n**backdoor trojan**\nA type of trojan that provides attackers with remote unauthorized access to and\ncontrol of infected computers. Bots are a subcategory of backdoor trojans. Also\nsee botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Bitcoin**\nA form of digital currency. Bitcoins can be used to buy things online or exchange\nthem for real money.\n\n**botnet**\nA set of computers controlled by a command-and-control (C&C) computer to\nexecute commands as directed. The C&C computer can issue commands\ndirectly (often through Internet Relay Chat [IRC]) or by using a decentralized\nmechanism, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. Computers in a botnet are\noften called bots, nodes, or zombies.\n\n**buffer overflow**\nAn error in an application in which the data written into a buffer exceeds the\ncurrent capacity of that buffer, thus overwriting adjacent memory. Because\nmemory is overwritten, unreliable program behavior may result and, in certain\ncases, allow arbitrary code to run.\n\n**C&C**\nSee command and control (C&C).\n\n**CCM**\nShort for computers cleaned per mille (thousand). The number of computers\ncleaned for every 1,000 executions of the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal\nTool (MSRT).
