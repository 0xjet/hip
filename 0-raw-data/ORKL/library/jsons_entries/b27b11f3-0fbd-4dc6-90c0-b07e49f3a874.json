The data set contained the\nphotos of individuals holding their national IDs. A quick analysis showed that the server had\nbeen exposed for at least two months. While not entirely clear if this was a breach or a leak\nand who was behind it, the data was most likely obtained from one of the Brazilian\ngovernment portals, as deeper examination revealed.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur first thought was — wow, someone forgot a 55GB directory with sensitive data on a\npublicly available server. The only right thing to do was to reach out to the relevant Brazilian\ncybersecurity authorities so they could take the necessary actions to mitigate the risks\n\n**Anastasia Tikhonova, Head of Advanced Persistent Threat Research at Group-IB’s Threat**\nIntelligence team\n\nImmediately upon discovery, Group-IB’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GIB)\nalerted Brazil's cybersecurity authorities about the incident. The case highlights the\nimportance of rapid threat intelligence exchange and collaboration between the CERTs all\nover the world – the information provided by CERT-GIB was actioned swiftly. Within ten\nhours, the server was taken offline.\n\nThis was not the first time Brazilians’ sensitive data ended up available to the public. In 2020,\n[personal records of over 243 million Brazilians were exposed. As the world goes digital, the](https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/brazils-health-ministrys-website-data-leak-exposed-243-million-medical-records-for-more-than-6-months/)\nsecurity risks of online identity verification are becoming more pervasive. The incident\ndemonstrates why government and private sector organizations that process sensitive\npersonal data need stringent cybersecurity measures, including threat intelligence and\nhunting operations in place, to avoid financial losses, reputational damage, and data\nbreaches.\n\nAt the end of this post, cybersecurity professionals can find recommendations and\nremediation techniques to avoid and address similar incidents.\n\n## How Group-IB uncovered the breach\n\nAs part of Group-IB’s threat intelligence gathering processes, the entire IPv4 internet space\nis scanned continuously for anomalies, signs of suspicious and malicious activity,\nmisconfiguration causing digital assets to be exposed to a wider public. Automated tools\nassess online resources and identify high-risk infrastructure that requires further evaluation.\n\nIn this case, a publicly accessible server hosted in the US with the directory listing function\nenabled was discovered on 8th January. Disabling directory listing on a web server is a\nnormal security precaution to avoid the exposure of sensitive information. However, this was\nnot the case. Anyone on the internet could access the server’s contents.\n\nWithin the directory, several files were found, including a 27 GB zip-archive containing more\nthan 20,000 Brazilian citizens’ ID selfies, a custom web crawling script written in Python,\nand an open source web tunneling tool.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Server directory_\n\nBased on the archive’s last modification date, Group-IB’s analysts concluded that the file had\nbeen uploaded to the server no later than November 2021.\n\nA crawler script, used for data collection, also caught Group-IB team’s attention. As its code\nexamination revealed, the crawler connected to one of the Brazilian government portals. The\ncrawler’s developer left a little more in the source code. Group-IB analysts spotted a phrase\nin Portuguese which says “Deu erro aqui nessa merda!” (ENG: “You got this s*** wrong”).\n\nThe server in question was located outside of Brazil.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven all the above evidence, it is fair to assume that the server appears to have been used\nby an authorized third party as a staging area while they gathered sensitive personal\ninformation with unclear but most likely malicious intent. However, it is not clear what was the\nend goal of the party that collected sensitive data.\n\n## The privacy dangers of digital verification\n\nPersonal ID discovered on the server is the Cédula de identidade, the national identity\ndocument in Brazil, commonly referred to as ‘carteira de identidade’ or simply “RG” (from\nRegistro Geral, General Registry). The card contains the name of the bearer, filiation, place\nof birth, date of birth, signature and thumbprint of the bearer and, optionally, CPF number\n(‘Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas’), the country’s individual taxpayer registry identification.\n\nThe identity card is used for a number of private and public purposes including obtaining a\ndriver's license, opening a bank account, buying or selling real estate, financing debts,\napplying for a job, giving testimony in court, and entering some public buildings. The card\ncan also be used for travel between Mercosur member countries and associates (except\nGuyana and Suriname).\nAround the world, many organizations are implementing digital verification processes as they\nundergo digital transformation, making the services available via mobile apps or web portals.\nFor the end-user, this model can be appealing; it is a fast and easy way to sign up for\nservices, completely removing the need to visit a physical point of presence. However, when\nthe data is not managed properly without cyber security considerations in mind, it is almost\ninevitable that personal information will be exposed. Digital Verification based on selfies has\nbeen gaining momentum in recent years and is used on everything from dating apps to tax\nreturns. Just in February, the US IRS had to [walk back their use of selfie-based ID.ME](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/irs-id-me-delete-facial-recognition-tax-returns-backlash/)\namidst a storm of privacy concerns.\n\nRisks of having personal such information exposed vary for users and companies.\n\nFor the individuals that had their personal information exposed, they are at risk of:\n\nIdentity theft\nAccount takeover\nExtortion\nSpear phishing attacks\nTheft of money\n\nThe organizations that experienced the data breach can also be at risk of:\n\nFinancial loss\nLegal action\nReputational damage\n\n\n-----\n\nOperational downtime\nResponse and recovery costs\nDisclosure announcements if there is a breach\n\n[Upon the discovery, Group-IB’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GIB)](https://www.group-ib.com/cert.html)\nimmediately took steps to remediate the risks, and within 10 hours the server was taken\noffline by the Brazil's cybersecurity authorities.\n\n## Why Group-IB reported this breach\n\nGroup-IB's mission is to fight against cybercrime. As part of this mission, Group-IB\ncontinuously scans the internet for unsecured databases containing private and personal\ninformation. When we uncover unsecured data, we immediately take steps to mitigate the\nrisks to users, organizations and government departments.\n\nUnder a responsible disclosure protocol, Group-IB always does its best to reach out to the\naffected parties so they can take the necessary steps to eliminate the threat. Typically,\nGroup-IB launches an investigation to determine who the owner is, what information is at\nrisk, who is affected, and the potential impact on data subjects. After identifying whoever is\nresponsible for an exposed database, we utilize our contacts in the security community,\nincluding CERTs, law enforcement partners and threat analysts, to alert the appropriate\nparties to secure the data as quickly as possible.\n\nTry Group-IB Threat Intelligence Now\n\nOptimize strategic, operational and tactical decision making with best-in-class threat\nintelligence\n\nTest Drive Group-IB Threat Intelligence\n\n## Recommendations\n\nHow to prevent a similar data breach\n\nKnow all of your internet-facing assets\n\nThe forgotten server had an HTTP directory listing, which allowed anyone to discover and\nutilize the information. Inappropriately exposed directory listing is categorized by MITRE as a\nCommon Weakness Enumeration (CWE-548).\n\n\n-----\n\n[Organizations should conduct attack surface management to identify all of their internet-](https://www.group-ib.com/products/attack-surface-management/)\nfacing assets, including servers that have been forgotten. An audit or vulnerability scan of the\nidentified infrastructure can reveal weaknesses including CWE-548, allowing security teams\nto remediate them before they are exploited.\nPrevent automated tools exploiting known vulnerabilities\n\nImproper authentication (CWE-287) occurs when an unauthorized third party claims to be an\nauthenticated user, such as falsifying cookies to bypass authentication checks. This\ntechnique is sometimes used in conjunction with Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n(CWE-799) which can allow the attacker to launch brute force attacks, such as repeatedly\nguessing the credentials of an administrator until a correct combination is found.\n\nServers and applications should be penetration tested to identify security issues such as\nCWE-287 and CWE-799. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) also known as web\napplication vulnerability scanning, is a method for finding externally visible issues and\nvulnerabilities, and can further help identify issues. Equipping developers with Open Web\nApplication Security Project (OWASP) Top Ten Web Application Security Risks document\ncan help avoid the most critical security risks.\nPrevent compromised information from being exploited\n\nBy identifying the exposed personal information Group-IB was able to alert Brazilian\nauthorities, allowing them to take steps to prevent the information from being used for\nfraudulent purposes. For a private organization, a parallel could be identifying administrator\ncredentials for critical infrastructure on the internet, knowing that these credentials have been\ncompromised the organization can revoke the account’s permissions before it is used for\nmalicious purposes.\n\nScanning the open internet, dark web and closed threat actor forums for compromised\ninformation can help prevent it from being utilized by threat actors. This activity is performed\nby [threat intelligence teams that have the resources and skills to find, process and](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-intelligence/)\ndisseminate this information. Timeliness is a factor for preventing compromised information\nfrom being used and should be a factor when evaluating threat intelligence solutions.\n\n## What to do if you believe you have experienced a breach\n\nIf an attack has taken place the first step is to remove the threat actor from your network,\nrevoking account privileges, disabling communications with C2 servers and disrupting any\npersistence techniques. The anatomy of the attack should then be explored to understand\nthe kill chain that allowed the attacker to gain a foothold within the organization and move\nlaterally. Lastly, remediating steps should be actioned to prevent similar attacks from\noccurring in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\nTimeliness is key to minimizing the impact of a breach.
