Another website, nirsoft[.]me, was also discovered by\nMalwareHunterTeam to be acting as the command and control server for this campaign.\n\n**Malware-delivering website**\n\n_Source:  CERT-UA_\n\n\n-----\n\n[When a victim downloads and run this fake BitDefender Windows update [VirusTotal], the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2f92d416f73472db1ebe880b3bec677bcb1d96d6ad62974da00b4be5f6d61f5b)\nscreen below will be shown prompting the users to install a 'Windows Update Package.'\n\n**The Bitdefender Windows Update Package**\n\n_Source:_ _[MalwareHunterTeam](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1502306516396826636)_\n[However, this 'update' actually downloads and installs the one.exe file [VirusTotal] from the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2f92d416f73472db1ebe880b3bec677bcb1d96d6ad62974da00b4be5f6d61f5b)\nDiscord CDN, which is a Cobalt Strike beacon.\n\nCobalt Strike is a widely abused penetration testing suite that offers offensive security\ncapabilities, facilitates lateral network movement, and ensures persistence.\n\nThe same process fetches a Go downloader (dropper.exe) which decodes and executes a\nbase-64-encoded file (java-sdk.exe).\n\nThis file adds a new Windows registry key for persistence and also downloads two more\npayloads, the GraphSteel backdoor (microsoft-cortana.exe) and GrimPlant backdoor (oraclejava.exe).\n\n\n-----\n\n**The infection chain of the uncovered campaign** _(CERT-UA)_\nAll executables in the campaign are packed on the Themida tool, which protects them from\nreverse engineering, detection, and analysis.\n\n## Go payloads\n\n[Both GraphSteel and GrimPlant are malware written in Go, a versatile and cross-platform](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tellyouthepass-ransomware-returns-as-a-cross-platform-golang-threat/)\nprogramming language with minimal footprint and low AV detection rates.\n\nThe capabilities of the two tools cover network reconnaissance, command execution, and file\noperations, so the fact that both are deployed in the same system is likely done for\nredundancy.\n\nGraphSteel features:\n\nGather hostname, username, and IP address information\nExecute commands\nSteal account credentials\nUse WebSocket and GraphQL to communicate with C2 using AES and base64\nencryption\n\nGrimPlant capabilities:\n\nGather IP address, hostname, OS, username, home dir\nExecute commands received remotely and return results to C2\nUse gRPC (HTTP/2+SSL) for C2 communication\n\nNot many technical details have been provided on these two payloads, and we can't exclude\nthe possibility of them being known backdoors given new names in this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\nGiven the current situation in Ukraine, it's easy to attribute all hostile activity to Russian and\npro-Russian threat actors, and this seems to be the case here too.\n\n[The Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team associates the detected activity with](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37704)\nthe UAC-0056 group with medium confidence.\n\nUAC-0056, also known as \"Lorec53\", is a sophisticated Russian-speaking APT that uses a\ncombination of phishing emails and custom backdoors to collect information from Ukrainian\norganizations.\n\nUAC-0056 was spotted ramping up its phishing distribution and network compromise efforts\n[in Ukraine since December 2021.](https://nsfocusglobal.com/apt-lorec53-group-launched-a-series-of-cyber-attacks-against-ukraine/)\n\n[The same actor was spotted targeting Georgian government agencies with phishing lures in](https://nsfocusglobal.com/apt-retrospection-lorec53-an-active-russian-hack-group-launched-phishing-attacks-against-georgian-government/)\n[the recent past, so there's a high level of coordination and alignment with the interests of the](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-hybrid-aggression-against-georgia-use-local-and-external-tools)\nRussian state.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Ukraine
