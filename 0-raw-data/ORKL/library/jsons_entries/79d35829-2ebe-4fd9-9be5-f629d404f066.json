In the days following the disclosure, it was revealed that the\nransomware family most likely behind the attack was “HelloKitty”.\n\n\n-----\n\nHelloKitty is a ransomware family that emerged in late 2020. While it lacks the sophistication\nof some of the more well-known families such as Ryuk, REvil, and Conti, it has nevertheless\nstruck some notable targets, including CEMIG0. In this post, we analyse a recent HelloKitty\nsample and outline the basic behaviors and traits associated with this family of ransomware.\n\n## Execution and Behavior\n\nThe “HelloKitty” name is based on internal mutex names, which are apparent upon\nexecution.\n\nWhile still somewhat unclear, current intelligence indicates that the primary delivery method\nof HelloKitty binaries is via phish email or via secondary infection in conjunction with other\nmalware.\n\nOnce launched, HelloKitty will attempt to disable and terminate a number of processes and\nservices so as to reduce interference with the encryption process. This includes processes\nand services associated with IIS, MSSQL, Quickbooks, Sharepoint, and more. These actions\nare carried out via `taskkill.exe and` `net.exe .`\n\nIn the analyzed sample, this is all done in a very non-stealthy manner. All spawned CMD\nwindows are in the foreground and fully visible. This ‘lack of discreteness’ is atypical for\nmodern ransomware, or any successful malware, for that matter.\n\n\n-----\n\nA full list of processes from the analyzed sample are listed below:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ndsa \nNtrtsca\nds_moni\nNotifie\nTmListe\niVPAgen\nCNTAoSM\nIBM*\nbes10*\nblack*\nrobo*\ncopy*\nstore.e\nsql*\nvee*\nwrsa*\nwrsa.ex\npostg*\nsage*\nMSSQLServerADHelper100\nMSSQL$ISARS\nMSSQL$MSFW\nSQLAgent$ISARS\nSQLAgent$MSFW\nSQLBrowser\nReportServer$ISARS\nSQLWriter\nWinDefend\nmr2kserv\nMSExchangeADTopology\nMSExchangeFBA\nMSExchangeIS\nMSExchangeSA\nShadowProtectSvc\nSPAdminV4\nSPTimerV4\nSPTraceV4\nSPUserCodeV4\nSPWriterV4\nSPSearch4\nIISADMIN\nfirebirdguardiandefaultinstance\nibmiasrw\nQBCFMonitorService\nQBVSS\nQBPOSDBServiceV12\n\"IBM Domino Server(CProgramFilesIBMDominodata)\"\n\"IBM Domino Diagnostics(CProgramFilesIBMDomino)\"\n\"Simply Accounting Database Connection Manager\"\nQuickBooksDB1\nQuickBooksDB2\nQuickBooksDB3\nQuickBooksDB4\nQuickBooksDB5\nQuickBooksDB6\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nQuickBooksDB7\nQuickBooksDB8\nQuickBooksDB9\nQuickBooksDB10\nQuickBooksDB11\nQuickBooksDB12\nQuickBooksDB13\nQuickBooksDB14\nQuickBooksDB15\nQuickBooksDB16\nQuickBooksDB17\nQuickBooksDB18\nQuickBooksDB19\nQuickBooksDB20\nQuickBooksDB21\nQuickBooksDB22\nQuickBooksDB23\nQuickBooksDB24\nQuickBooksDB25\n\n```\nAdditional processes and services that are terminated are identified via PID. For example:\n```\ntaskkill.exe /f /PID \"8512\"\ntaskkill.exe /f /PID \"8656\"\n\n```\nIf HelloKitty is unable to stop any specific processes or services, it will leverage the Windows\nRestart Manager API to further assist in termination.\n\nHelloKitty will also utilize WMI to gather system details and help identify running processes\nand any potentially problematic processes. This is done both by name and by PID. A number\nof examples are shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nstart iwbemservices::execquery rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,\ncaption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,\nparentprocessid from win32_process\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,\ncaption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,\nparentprocessid from win32_process where ( caption = \"store.exe\")\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,\ncaption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,\nparentprocessid from win32_process where ( caption = \"wrsa.exe\")\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,\ncaption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,\nparentprocessid from win32_process where ( processid = 3036)\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,\ncaption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,\nparentprocessid from win32_process where ( processid = 4460)\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,\ncaption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,\nparentprocessid from win32_process where ( processid = 3052)\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,\ncaption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,\nparentprocessid from win32_process where ( processid = 4476)\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,\ncaption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,\nparentprocessid from win32_process where ( processid = 1560)\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,\ncaption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,\nparentprocessid from win32_process where ( processid = 8124)\nstart iwbemservices::exe\n\n## Encryption and Ransom Note\n\n```\nEncryption is initiated and completed very quickly once applicable services and processes\nhave been terminated. Specific encryption recipes and routines can vary across variants of\nHelloKitty. Generally speaking, they tend to use a combination of AES-256 & RSA-2048 or\neven NTRU+AES-128.\n\nOnce encrypted, affected files receive the `.crypted extension.`\n\n\n-----\n\nRansom notes are typically customized to directly reference the victim and victim’s\nenvironment. Victims are instructed to visit a TOR-based payment and support portal. The\nfollowing example has been sanitized:\n\nIt is also important to note that as of this writing, the onion address associated with HelloKitty\nransom notes is not active.\n\n```\n6x7dp6h3w6q3ugjv4yv5gycj3femb24kysgry5b44hhgfwc5ml5qrdad.onion\n\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHelloKitty may be easier to spot than other modern ransomware families, but upon execution\nit is no less dangerous. There are currently no known ‘weaknesses’ in the encryption\nroutines, and there are no thirdy-party decrypters available for the HelloKitty ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nTherefore, the only true defense is prevention. While this family does not appear to be\nactively leaking victim data at the moment, that could change at any point, in addition to them\nchoosing to adopt some of the more recent extortion methods that go along with ransomware\n(DDoS).\n\nActors behind the more recent campaign(s) are reportedly attempting to auction the CD\nProjekt data off in various ‘underground’ forums. At present this sale of this data does appear\nto be legitimate. Time will tell if additional victim data is dealt with in the same way.\n\nTo protect yourself against HelloKitty, make sure you are armed with a modern Endpoint\nSecurity platform, which is configured correctly and up to date. The SentinelOne Singularity\nPlatform is fully capable of preventing and detecting all malicious behaviors associated with\nthe HelloKitty ransomware family.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**SHA1**\n\nfadd8d7c13a18c251ded1f645ffea18a37f1c2de\n\n**SHA256**\n\n501487b025f25ddf1ca32deb57a2b4db43ccf6635c1edc74b9cff54ce0e5bcfe\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK**\n\n[Data from Local System – T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)\n\nModify Registry – [T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/)\n\n[Query Registry – T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/)\n\n[System Information Discovery – T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\nData Encrypted for Impact – [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\n\n[File Deletion – T1070.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004/)\n\n[Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell – T1059.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003/)\n\n[Windows Management Instrumentation – T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\n\n\n-----",
