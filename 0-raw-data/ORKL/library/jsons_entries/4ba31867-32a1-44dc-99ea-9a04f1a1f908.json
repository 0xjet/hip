    "plain_text": "# A Review and Analysis of 2021 Buer Loader Campaigns\n\n**[trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns.html](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns.html)**\n\nNovember 5, 2021\n\nIn this blog entry and technical brief we review Buer Loader 2021 activity and campaigns.\nBuer Loader is known for entering the underground market at a pointedly competitive price in\n2019. Now, it seems that Buer Loader has established itself well and remains actively used\nby threat actors.\n\n**Buer Loader 2021 Lures**\n\nPart of Buer Loader’s service is to setup a domain to facilitate C&C. This helps researchers\nbetter monitor the campaigns involving Buer Loader, because multiple customers or threat\nactors would end up using the same C&C. Here we give an overview of the distinct aspect of\nthe 2021 campaigns that used Buer Loader.\n\nA campaign in April used emails pretending to be shipping notices from DHL contain the new\nBuer Loader written in Rust. The attachments were either Word or Excel documents.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1.\n\nExample of a DHL themed email\nThe email seen in Figure 2 uses a combination of a DHL lure and Covid-19. It is designed to\nentice users to open the malicious attachment. It also bears a request to not reply to the mail\nand the common message “if you did not request registration with us, please ignore this\nemail,” which are likely additional attempts to reassure users of the content’s legitimacy.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The DHL themed lure with a reference to Covid-19\nLater campaigns shifted towards using Covid-19 entirely as a lure. Buer Loader was\nobserved in spam runs which referenced vaccination uptake results, healthcare warnings,\nand current infection rates. Many of these spam runs do not make grammatical sense and\nshould make most users suspicious, as seen in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. The Covid-19 themed lure\n**Rust variant and signed XLL**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these campaigns all use the version of the Buer Loader rewritten in the\nRust programming language. Aside from being rewritten in Rust, the loader’s code remained\nrelatively unchanged which could indicate that this is a ploy to render detections for its C\nversion obsolete. Another interesting update is the use of signed XLL files because it can be\nmisleading for those tasked to defend the system.\n\nWhile all these are noteworthy developments in Buer Loader, activity for this loader has been\ncontinuous since it was first released into the underground market. It has been used to\ndeliver payloads like Ryuk, Wizard Spider, and Cobalt Strike beacon.\n\nOur primary goal is to identify key changes in infrastructure, distribution methods, and the\nTTPs being used by Buer Loader campaigns. In our technical brief we first review the\nnotable events of the Buer Loader timeline, before delving into its current activities, and\ndetections.\n\n[The technical brief can be found here.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/k/a-review-and-analysis-of-2021-buer-loader-campaigns/TechnicalBrief-An-Analysis-of-Buer-Loader.pdf)\n\nCyber Threats\n\nBuer Loader has established itself well in the underground market and has since seen\ncontinuous development. In this blog entry, we review its 2021 campaigns, tactics, and\nactivity.\n\nBy: Christopher Boyton November 05, 2021 Read time: ( words)\n\n\n-----\n\nContent added to Folio\n\n\n-----",
