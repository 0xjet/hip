That hijacking operation of the legitimate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apt28-hackers-caught-hijacking-legitimate-lojack-software/)\nsoftware was also the work of ATP28.\n\n\"On systems that were targeted by the LoJax campaign, we found various tools that are able\nto access and patch UEFI/BIOS settings,\" ESET says in a report shared with\nBleepingComputer.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Signed driver opens access to firmware\n\nSecurity researchers explain that they found three different types of tools on a victim's\ncomputer. Two of them are responsible for gathering details about the system firmware and\nfor creating a copy of the system firmware by reading the SPI flash memory module, where\nthe UEFI firmware is located.\n\nThe third one injects the malicious module and writes the compromised firmware back to the\nSPI flash memory, creating persistence for the malware.\n\nTo reach the UEFI/BIOS settings, all tools use the kernel driver of the [RWEverything tool that](http://rweverything.com/)\nallows modification of the settings in the firmware of almost any hardware. The driver is\nsigned with a valid certificate.\n\n\"This patching tool uses different techniques either to abuse misconfigured platforms or to\nbypass platform SPI flash memory write protections,\" ESET says.\n\nIf write operations are denied, the malicious tool exploits a four-year-old race condition\n[vulnerability in UEFI (CVE-2014-8273) to bypass the defenses.](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/766164)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe purpose of the rootkit is just to drop malware into the Windows operating system and\nmake sure that it executes at startup.\n\n## Defending against LoJax UEFI rootkit\n\nProtecting against LoJax infection is possible by enabling the Secure Boot mechanism,\nwhich checks that every component loaded by the system firmware is signed with a valid\ncertificate.\n\nSince LoJax rootkit is not signed, Secure Boot can prevent it from dropping the malware in\nthe first place.\n\nAnother way to protect against Sednit's rootkit is to make sure the motherboard has the\nlatest firmware version from the manufacturer. The patching tool can do its job only if the\nprotections for the SPI flash module are vulnerable or misconfigured. An updated firmware\nshould render fruitless the malicious update operation.\n\nReflashing the firmware, however, is a task most users are unfamiliar with. It is a manual\noperation that typically involves downloading the latest firmware version from the\nmotherboard manufacturer, saving it on an external storage device, booting into the UEFI\nmenu and installing it.\n\nAn alternative is to replace the motherboard with a newer generation since LoJax affects\nolder chipsets. This requires some technical knowledge, to ensure hardware compatibility,\nand most users find it easier to replace the entire station.\n\n\n-----\n\nLoJax is a rare threat, designed for high-value targets. ESET presented their discovery today\nat the Microsoft BlueHat security conference. A detailed analysis of LoJax UEFI rootkit is\n[available here.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ESET-LoJax.pdf)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Cyberspies use IP cameras to deploy backdoors, steal Exchange emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberspies-use-ip-cameras-to-deploy-backdoors-steal-exchange-emails/)\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Russian hackers perform reconnaissance against Austria, Estonia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-hackers-perform-reconnaissance-against-austria-estonia/)\n\n[Chinese ‘Space Pirates’ are hacking Russian aerospace firms](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-space-pirates-are-hacking-russian-aerospace-firms/)\n\n[Bitter cyberspies target South Asian govts with new malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitter-cyberspies-target-south-asian-govts-with-new-malware/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
