The operation is likely associated with an\n[advanced persistent threat, or a network actor that spies undetected.[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat) Its command and\n[control infrastructure is based mainly in the People's Republic of China and GhostNet has](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)\ninfiltrated high-value political, economic and media locations[4] in 103 countries. Computer\n[systems belonging to embassies, foreign ministries and other government offices, and the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy)\n[Dalai Lama's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama) [Tibetan exile centers in India, London and New York City were compromised.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet)\n\n\n## Discovery\n\nGhostNet was discovered and named following a 10-month investigation by the Infowar\n[Monitor (IWM), carried out after IWM researchers approached the Dalai Lama's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama)\nrepresentative in Geneva[5] suspecting that their computer network had been infiltrated.[6]\nThe IWM is composed of researchers from The SecDev Group and Canadian consultancy\n[and the Citizen Lab,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Lab) [Munk Centre for International Studies at the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munk_Centre_for_International_Studies) [University of Toronto; the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto)\nresearch findings were published in the Infowar Monitor, an affiliated publication.[7]\n[Researchers from the University of Cambridge's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge) [Computer Laboratory, supported by the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge_Computer_Laboratory)\n[Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection,[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Information_Infrastructure_Protection) also contributed to the investigation at\n[one of the three locations in Dharamshala, where the Tibetan government-in-exile is located.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharamshala)\nThe discovery of the 'GhostNet', and details of its operations, were reported by The New\n_York Times on March 29, 2009.[7][9]_ Investigators focused initially on allegations of Chinese\n[cyber-espionage against the Tibetan exile community, such as instances where email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_exile)\ncorrespondence and other data were extracted.[10]\n\n\n[Compromised systems were discovered in the embassies of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy) [India,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) [South Korea,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea) [Indonesia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia)\n[Romania,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania) [Cyprus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus) [Malta,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta) [Thailand,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand) [Taiwan,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) [Portugal, Germany and Pakistan and the office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal)\nof the Prime Minister of [Laos.

[Washington, D.C., were](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)\ninfiltrated.[4][11][12]\n\nSince its discovery, GhostNet has attacked other government networks, for example\nCanadian official financial departments in early 2011, forcing them off-line. Governments\ncommonly do not admit such attacks, which must be verified by official but anonymous\n\n\n-----\n\nsources.\n\n\n\n[ ]\n\n\n## Technical functionality\n\nEmails are sent to target organizations that contain contextually relevant information. These\n[emails contain malicious attachments, that when opened, enable a trojan horse to access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing))\nthe system. This Trojan connects back to a control server, usually located in China, to\nreceive commands. The infected computer will then execute the command specified by the\ncontrol server. Occasionally, the command specified by the control server will cause the\n[infected computer to download and install a trojan known as Gh0st Rat that allows attackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gh0st_Rat)\n[to gain complete, real-time control of computers running Microsoft Windows.[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) Such a\ncomputer can be controlled or inspected by attackers, and the software even has the ability\nto turn on camera and audio-recording functions of infected computers, enabling attackers to\nperform surveillance.[7]\n\n\n## Origin\n\nThe researchers from the IWM stated they could not conclude that the Chinese government\nwas responsible for the spy network.[14] However, a report from researchers at the University\nof Cambridge says they believe that the Chinese government is behind the intrusions they\nanalyzed at the Office of the Dalai Lama.[15]\n\n\nResearchers have also noted the possibility that GhostNet was an operation run by private\ncitizens in China for profit or for patriotic reasons, or created by intelligence agencies from\nother countries such as Russia or the United States.[7] The Chinese government has stated\nthat China \"strictly forbids any cyber crime.\"[1][10]\n\nThe \"Ghostnet Report\" documents several unrelated infections at Tibetan-related\norganizations in addition to the Ghostnet infections. By using the email addresses provided\nby the IWM report, Scott J. Henderson had managed to trace one of the operators of one of\n[the infections (non-Ghostnet) to Chengdu. He identifies the hacker as a 27-year-old man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu)\n[who had attended the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Electronic_Science_and_Technology_of_China)\n[currently connected with the Chinese hacker underground.[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture)\n\n\nDespite the lack of evidence to pinpoint the Chinese government as responsible for\nintrusions against Tibetan-related targets, researchers at Cambridge have found actions\ntaken by Chinese government officials that corresponded with the information obtained via\ncomputer intrusions. One such incident involved a diplomat who was pressured by Beijing\n[after receiving an email invitation to a visit with the Dalai Lama from his representatives.[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama)\n\nAnother incident involved a Tibetan woman who was interrogated by Chinese intelligence\nofficers and was shown transcripts of her online conversations.[14][17] However, there are\n[other possible explanations for this event. Drelwa uses QQ and other instant messengers to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent_QQ)\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunicate with Chinese Internet users. In 2008, IWM found that TOM-Skype, the Chinese\nversion of Skype, was logging and storing text messages exchanged between users. It is\npossible that the Chinese authorities acquired the chat transcripts through these means.[18]\n\nIWM researchers have also found that when detected, GhostNet is consistently controlled\n[from IP addresses located on the island of Hainan, China, and have pointed out that Hainan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan)\nis home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the\nPeople's Liberation Army.[4] Furthermore, one of GhostNet's four control servers has been\nrevealed to be a government server.[19]\n\n\n## See also\n\n References\n\n1. ^ a b c\n2. ^ _[Glaister, Dan (March 30, 2009). \"China Accused of Global Cyberspying\".](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/30/china-dalai-lama-spying-computers)_ _The_\n\n_Guardian Weekly.
