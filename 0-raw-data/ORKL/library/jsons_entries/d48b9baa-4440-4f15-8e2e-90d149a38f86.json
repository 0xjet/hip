Our analysis shows that these](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/01/unit42-vermin-quasar-rat-custom-malware-used-ukraine/)\ncybercriminals continue to improve their campaigns by developing new versions of their\nespionage tools.\n\nAccording to ESET’s telemetry, the attacks have been targeted at Ukrainian government\ninstitutions, with a few hundred victims in different organizations. Attackers have been using\nstealthy remote access tools (RATs) to exfiltrate sensitive documents from the victims’\ncomputers.\n\nWe have detected three different strains of .NET malware in these campaigns: Quasar RAT,\nSobaken RAT, and a custom-made RAT called Vermin. All three malware strains have been\nin active use against different targets at the same time, they share parts of their\ninfrastructure and connect to the same C&C servers.\n\nQuasar is an open-source RAT, which is freely available on GitHub. We were able to trace\ncampaigns by these threat actors using Quasar RAT binaries back to October 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nSobaken is a heavily modified version of the Quasar RAT. Some functionality was removed\nto make the executable smaller, and several anti-sandbox, and other evasion, tricks were\nadded.\n\nVermin is a custom-made backdoor. It first appeared in mid-2016 and is still in use at the\ntime of writing. Just like Quasar and Sobaken, it is written in .NET. To slow down analysis,\nthe program code is protected using commercial .NET code protection system, .NET\nReactor, or open-source protector ConfuserEx.\n\nVermin is a full-featured backdoor with several optional components. Its latest known\nversion supports 24 commands, implemented in the main payload, and several additional\ncommands implemented via optional components, including audio recording, keylogging\nand password stealing.\n\nThe analyzed campaigns have been based on basic social engineering, but also using\nseveral tricks to better lure the victims into downloading and executing the malware, served\n[as email attachments. Among these tricks are using right-to-left override to obscure the](https://redcanary.com/blog/right-to-left-override/)\nattachments’ real extension, email attachments disguised as RAR self-extracting archives,\nand a combination of a specially crafted Word document carrying a CVE-2017-0199 exploit.\n\nAll three malware strains are installed in the same way: a dropper drops a malicious\npayload file (Vermin, Quasar or Sobaken malware) into the %APPDATA% folder, into a\nsubfolder named after a legitimate company (usually Adobe, Intel or Microsoft). Then, it\ncreates a scheduled task that runs the payload every 10 minutes to ensure its persistence.\n\nTo make sure that the malware runs on targeted machines only and avoids automated\nanalysis systems and sandboxes, the attackers have deployed several measures. The\nmalware terminates if neither Russian or Ukrainian keyboard layouts are installed, and also\nif the target system’s IP address is located outside these two countries, or is registered to\none of several selected antimalware vendors or cloud providers. The malware also refuses\nto run on computers with usernames typical of automated malware analysis systems. To\ndetermine whether it is run in an automated analysis system, it tries to reach a randomly\ngenerated website name/URL and checks if the connection to the URL fails, as would be\nexpected on a real system.\n\nThese attackers haven’t received much public attention compared to others who target\nhigh-profile organizations in Ukraine. However, they have proved that with clever social\nengineering tricks, cyber-espionage attacks can succeed even without using sophisticated\nmalware. This underscores the need for training staff in cybersecurity awareness, on top of\nhaving a quality security solution in place.\n\nESET detection names and other Indicators of Compromise for the mentioned campaigns\ncan be found in the full white paper: Quasar, Sobaken and Vermin: A deeper look into an\nongoing espionage campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n17 Jul 2018 - 02:57PM\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
