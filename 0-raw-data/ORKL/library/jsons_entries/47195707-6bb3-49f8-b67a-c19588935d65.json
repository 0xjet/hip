I did a deep research on one of them and discovered that once the\nmalicious Excel document is opened on a victim’s machine, it downloads a new variant of Dridex.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this analysis, I will elaborate how the Excel document downloads Dridex, how this version of Dridex\nruns on a victim’s device, what sensitive information it collects, and how it delivers malicious modules\n(dll).\n\n## The Phishing Email of the Dridex Variant\n\nFigure 1.1 shows one of the recent phishing emails with a malicious Excel attachment infected with\nDridex.\n\nFigure 1.1 – Text of a recently captured phishing email\n\nAs you can see, this email disguises itself as sending Import Tariffs data to a customer, and then asking\nhim/her to view the details by opening the attached Excel file (in this case, “HF7.TRANS\n2021.08.09.xlsb”).\n\n## Analysis of the Macro Inside the Excel Document\n\nWhen the recipient opens the attached Excel document, it contains a message at the top of the\ndocument in bold red letters asking them to “Please enable macros.” However, Excel displays a yellow\n“Security Warning” bar telling the end user that macros are currently diabled, with the implication that\nclicking the button “Enable Content” may be risky, as shown in Figure 2.1.\n\nFigure 2.1 – Excel displays a warning bar when opening the infected Excel document\n\nLooking into the internal details of the Excel file, I found that it not only used auto-run Macro(VBA) but\n[also Excel 4.0 Macro. There is an auto-run function called Workbook_Open() in the Macro(VBA), which](https://exceloffthegrid.com/using-excel-4-macro-functions/)\nis automatically called when the Excel file is opened.\n\nThe code is included below:\n\nSub Workbook_Open()\nActiveWorkbook.Sheets(\"Macro1\").Range(\"A1\").Value=Environ(\"allusersprofile\")&\n\"\\KgmsgJbgP.sct\"\nEnd Sub\n\nIt only sets the value Environ(\"allusersprofile\")& \"\\KgmsgJbgP.sct\" (“C:\\ProgramData\\KgmsgJbgP.sct” in\nmy testing environment) to the “$A$1” cell of a sheet called “Macro1”.\n\n“Macro1” is a hidden sheet that contains and executes the Excel 4.0 Macro, which is defined in the file\n“xl\\workbook.xml” as shown in Figure 2.2.\n\nFigure 2.2 – Excel 4.0 Macro sheet is defined in “Workbook.xml”\n\nExcel 4.0 macros use formulas in various cells to execute code. As long as you give it a starting cell, it\nexecutes code from top to down, then from left to right.\n\nAfter the auto-run Macro(VBA) is executed, the Excel 4.0 Macro is executed automatically starting from\nthe cell “Macro1!$A$4”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Excel 4.0 Macro extracts data from a bunch of cells within the Macro1 sheet into a local file,\nwhose file path is saved in $A$1, which is “C:\\ProgramData\\KgmsgJbgP.sct”. The extracted data is an\nHTML application (.hta file) with a piece of VBScript code. The last step of the Excel 4.0 Macro is to\nexecute this “KgmsgJbgP.sct” file using the “mshta” command, which\nis =EXEC(CONCATENATE(\"mshta \", CHAR(34), A1, CHAR(34))).\n\nThe final command to be executed is “mshta.exe C:\\ProgramData\\KgmsgJbgP.sct“. “mshta.exe” is a\nWindows default program that is used to execute an html application (.hta file) with HTML, Dynamic\nHTML, and one or more scripting languages supported by Internet Explorer, such as VBScript or\nJScript.\n\n## HTML Application Used to Download the Dridex Payload\n\nFigure 3.1 – Malicious VBScript code in the extracted hta file\n\nThe VBScript code, as shown in figure 3.1, includes an array of ten URLs (refer to the “IOCs” section\nbelow for details) that link to the Dridex payload. It downloads Dridex from these ten URLs in a for-loop\ninto a local file, “%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\\\icXBOuZukiASGnpfVowZ.dll”, that is hardcoded in this\nVBScript code. When Dridex is downloaded successfully, it then executes “wmic.exe” (the WMI\ncommand-line) to create a new process of “rundll32.exe”.\n\nThe simplified code looks like this:\n\nCreateObject(\"Wscript.Shell\").Exec(\"wmic process call create \\\"Rundll32.exe\n**%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\\\icXBOuZukiASGnpfVowZ.dll ReportDeviceAdd\\\"\")**\n\nFinally, Rundll32.exe loads the Dridex payload file “icXBOuZukiASGnpfVowZ.dll” and the calls its export\nfunction, named “ReportDeviceAdd”, to execute its malicious functions.\n\n## Diving Into the Downloaded Dridex Payload File\n\nFigure 4.1 – The Dridex variant’s export function list in IDA Pro\n\nFigure 4.1 shows the export function list of the payload file of Dridex in IDA Pro. It contains two\nfunctions: DllEntryPoint() is the entry function for this dll. And FWroeeWqoinnmw() is the real entry\nfunction. An odd thing here is that there is no function for “ReportDeviceAdd”, which should be the\nstarting point of this Dridex variant.\n\nTo figure this out, we analyzed the internal strategy Rundll32.exe uses to load a module and then call\nits export function. Figure 4.2 shows the export function list of the Dridex payload file after it is\nunpacked. It provides six export functions. The fourth function is “ReportDeviceAdd”.\n\nFigure 4.2 – The export function list of unpacked payload file\n\nHere are the steps for how the Dridex payload file is loaded by Rundll32.exe.\n\n**The steps used by Rundll32 to load a dll and invoke the export function:**\n\n1. Rundll32.exe calls the API LoadLibrary() to load the dll into the memory and then deploy it\n\naccording to its PE structure.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. It first invokes the dll s entry point function—DllEntryPoint()—to initialize the module.\n3. It then calls API GetProcAddress() with the function name “ReportDeviceAdd” to obtain the\n\nfunction address from the initialized module in step 2.\n4. Rundll32.exe then calls the function address obtained in step 3.\n\nThis payload file also contains a packer-like program to protect itself from being researched by people.\nIt does the unpacking in step 2 when the payload file’s DllEntryPoint() is called.\n\nFrom this point, Rundll32.exe is able to obtain ReportDeviceAdd by calling the API GetProcAddress().\n\n## Anti-analysis Techniques Used in Dridex\n\n[Most modern malware includes anti-analysis techniques in their code to prevent it from being analyzed.](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/malware?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=malware)\n\n[This Dridex variant uses anti-analysis techniques similar to another Dridex variant I analyzed last year,](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/hundreds-of-urls-inside-microsoft-excel-spreads-new-dridex-trojan-variant?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=hundreds-of-urls-inside-microsoft-excel-spreads-new-dridex-trojan-variant)\nwhich are:\n\nAll [APIs are hidden and are found by its name’s hash code.](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/api-security?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=api-security)\nEntire constant strings are encrypted in memory and decrypted just before using.\nSome APIs are called in a crafted way to raise an exception (0x80000003) on purpose. It then\ncaptures the exception in the exception handler function to actually call the API.\n\n## Format of the Packet Sent to the C2 Server\n\nDridex collects sensitive data from the victim’s infected device, which is then placed into a formated\npacket, encrypted, and sent to the C2 server.\n\nFigure 5.1 is a screenshot of the first packet to a C2 server that was about to be encrypted. All the\npackets to the C2 server have the same packet format. As an example, I’ll elaborate on the format of\nthe packet below, which has been separated into many fields by a red pipe in the screenshot.\n\nThe selected part is common data for all packets, which is refered as a “packet header” in this analysis.\n\nFigure 5.1 – The first packet to the C2 server before encrypted\n\nTable 5.1 explains the content of each field in the packet format.\n\n**Offset** **Length** **Data**\n\n0x00 0x01 The length of the victim’s ID string.\n\n0x01 0x29 The victim’s ID string, which is variable.\n\n0x2A 0x20 The hard drive’s volume Information for the infected device.\n\n0x4A 0x02 Dridex version information—which is 0x56B9 in this variant.\n\n\n-----\n\n0x4C 0x04 A dword mixed with infected Windows version information.\n\n0x50 0x04 Packet Type Identification. 0x18F8C844 is for the first packet.\n\n0x54 0x01 Windows platform. 0x20 for 32-bit, 0x40 for 64-bit.\n\n0x55 variable Collected data from the victim’s system.\n\n_Table 5.1 – Decryption of the fields of the packet_\n\n- The victim’s ID string contains the computer name, underscore, and an MD5 hashcode of a string that\nincludes the computer name, user name, and the Windows system’s install date.\n\n- The hard drive’s volume information is an MD5 value made from data of the volume information of\n“C:\\” and the Windows installation date.\n\n- 0x56B9 is hardcoded data in the malware, possibly the malware version.\n\n- 0x11C1B11D is a mixed data set of Windows version information, which is obtained from the result of\nthe APIs GetVersionEx() and GetSystemInformation().\n\n- Dridex has five packet type IDs in this variant used to notify the C2 server. They are 0x18F8C844,\n0x69BE7CEE, 0x11041F01, 0xD3EF7577, and 0x32DC1DF8.\n\n- The data following 0x20 indicates that the victim’s Windows system is 32-bit platform.\n\nThe field values of every Dridex packet header (except for packet type ID) are the same for all the\npackets on the same machine.\n\nThe collected data (starting from offset 0x55) is appended to the packet header, which has two fields—\nthe collected data size (four bytes in network byte order) and the collected data followed.\n\n## Sending Collected Information to the C2 Server\n\nAs with its previous version, the IP address and port of C2 servers are hardcoded in the data. Below is\nthe IP list in binary of the three C2 servers.\n\n.data:72C6D02C     dd 2C94B67h   ; IP: 103.75.201.2\n\n.data:72C6D030     dw 1BBh     ; port: 443\n\n.data:72C6D032     dd 6C01DF9Eh  ; IP: 158.223.1.108\n\n.data:72C6D036     dw 1851h    ; port: 6225\n\n.data:72C6D038     dd 0F21C16A5h  ; IP: 165.22.28.242\n\n.data:72C6D03C     dw 1238h    ; port: 4664\n\nThe malware chooses one IP address and port pair in an for-loop. Once one connection to the C2\nserver is successfully established, it is used throughout the process life.\n\n\n-----\n\n0x18F8C844 is the packet ID for the very first packet. The collected data consists of the entire\ninstalled software (including software name and version) and all environment variables defined in the\ninfected system.\n\nIt obtains the installed software information one-by-one by enumerating the sub-keys under the key\n“HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall” in the system\nregistry.\n\nIt also steals the values of environment variables defined in the victim’s system. On my testing\nmachine, they are ALLUSERSPROFILE, APPDATA, CommonProgramFiles, COMPUTERNAME,\n_ComSpec, FP_NO_HOST_CHECK, HOMEDRIVE, HOMEPATH, LOCALAPPDATA, LOGONSERVER,_\n_NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS, OS, Path, PATHEXT, PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE,_\n_PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER, PROCESSOR_LEVEL, PROCESSOR_REVISION, ProgramData,_\n_ProgramFiles, PSModulePath, PUBLIC, QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR, SystemDrive,_\n_SystemRoot, TEMP, TMP, USERDOMAIN, USERNAME, USERPROFILE, VS140COMNTOOLS, and_\n_windir._\n\nIt calls the API GetEnvironmentStringsW() to obtain all the values of the above environment variables.\nFigure 6.1 shows a partial set of the name-value pairs obtained in memory.\n\nFigure 6.1 – Display of obtained environment variables in the victim’s device\n\nOnce the first packet is finished, Dridex encrypts the packet and sends it to the C2 server using the\nHTTP POST method. It invokes a group of APIs to send and receive the data, such as\nInternetConnectW(), HttpOpenRequestW(), HttpSendRequestW(), HttpQueryInfoW(), and\nInternetReadFile().\n\nUnfortunately, its C2 servers were down during my analysis, so it was unable to send/receive data\nto/from the C2 servers. But according to its code workflow, I could create a fake C2 server of Dridex to\nsimulate the server’s behaviors to receive and reply to Dridex to continue my research. The following\nanalysis is based on this simulated data.\n\n## Deploying a Malicious Module From C2 Server and Performing Persistence\n\nAfter receiving the response packet to the first packet from the C2 server, it sends the second packet\n(packet ID 0x11041F01) with no collected data. It should reply with a malicious module (dll file) in the\nresponse packet. Dridex verifies the response packet by comparing the packet’s hash code, which is\nthe first four bytes of the packet. Next, Dridex sends another packet (packet ID 0xD3EF7577) to inform\nthe C2 server that it has successfully received the module.\n\nFigure 7.1 - A module extracted from the second response packet.\n\nThe second response packet contains an encrypted module (dll) . After Dridex verifies the received\npacket, it decrypts the module—which is like the memory data displayed at the bottom of Figure 7.1.\n\nDridex then proceeds to deploy this malicious module onto the victim’s machine and then creats a\nscheduled task to run the module. Let’s see how it does this.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo keep the module running secretly on the victim s machine, Dridex uses a Windows default program\nto load and run it. It randomly chooses a pair of Windows program (exe) and a dll file from\n“%windir%\\system32” that the chosen program has to load. Next, Dridex can override the chosen dll file\nwith the received module. Hence, once the chosen program starts, the malicious module within the\nchosen dll is executed.\n\nIn this way, the victim only supposes that a Windows program is running, not a malware module.\n\nFigure 7.2 is a screenshot of the just-chosen pair of Windows program and the dll file from\n“%windir%\\system32\\”\n\nFigure 7.2 – Chosen Windows program and dll\n\nDridex copies the chosen Windows program (this time, it’s“sdclt.exe”) into a newly-created folder, with\nrandom string (like “Okuo”) under the “%appdata%” folder. Meanwhile, it reads the chosen dll (“slc.dll”)\ninto memory and then it overrides its data with the malicious module obtained from the response to the\nsecond packet. Finally, Dridex calls the API WriteFile() to save it to the same folder of the copied\nWindows program. From now on, whenever the Windows program—“sdclt.exe”—starts, it loads and\nexecutes the “slc.dll” that contains the malicious module.\n\nDridex then creates a scheduled task in the infected Windows system to achieve persistence on the\nvictim’s machine. The action of the task is just to start the copied Windows program (i.e. “sdclt.exe”)\nand it is triggered to repeat this action every 30 minutes.\n\nFigure 7.3 shows a screenshot of “Task Scheduler” with the added task named “Tixvzwbtojdsmg”, as\nwell as the copied “sdclt.exe” and “slc.dll” files in the folder “Okuo”.\n\nFigure 7.3 – Added scheduled task and copied Window program and dll files.\n\nOther than adding to the scheduled task, it also calls the API CreateProcessW() to run “sdclt.exe” once\njust after it has been deployed.\n\nBefore Dridex exits, it sends a packet with the ID 0x69BE7CEE to inform the C2 server that the\nmalicious payload has been successfully installed on the victim’s machine. Figure 7.4 is a code snippet\nabout to generate and send this packet.\n\nFigure 7.4 – Code snippet of handling packet 0x69BE7CEE\n\n## Conclusion - Dridex Variant\n\nYou have now learned how this Dridex campaign is run, including the phishing email, how the malicious\ncode inside the attached Excel document is executed to extract an HTML application file, and finally,\nhow a Rundll32.exe is called to execute the downloaded Dridex payload file.\n\nI elaborated on how this variant of Dridex communicates with its C2 server, the fields contained in the\npacket, how it asks the C2 server for a malicious module, and how the module is deployed onto the\ninfected system.\n\n\n-----\n\nI also made a flow chart of how Dridex communicates with its C2 servers below in Figure 8.1. It clearly\nshows what packet and data was sent to the C2 server and when it received the malicious module. It\nwill help you better understand the entire process.\n\nFigure 8.1 - Communication flow chart between Dridex and its C2 server.\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet customers are already protected from this malware by FortiGuard’s [Web Filtering, AntiVirus](https://www.fortinet.com/support-and-training/support-services/fortiguard-security-subscriptions/web-filtering.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=web-filtering)\n[and FortiEDR services, as follows:](https://www.fortinet.com/products/endpoint-security/fortiedr.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiedr)\n\nThe downloading URLs have been rated as \"Malicious Websites\" by the FortiGuard Web Filtering\nservice.\n\nThe attached Excel document and downloaded Dridex payload file are detected as\n\"MSExcel/Dridex.AC!tr\" and \"W32/Dridex.HMAH!tr\" and are blocked by the FortiGuard AntiVirus\nservice.\n\nFortiMail users are protected by FortiGuard AntiVirus, which detects the original Excel document as a\nmalicious attachment in the phishing email.\n\nFortiEDR detects the downloaded executable file as malicious based on its behavior.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**URLs:**\n\n\"hxxps[:]//assettagger[.]saleseos[.]com/Classes/PHPExcel/Shared/JAMA/examples/RLFBubHuLTnm[.]php\"\n\"hxxps[:]//reportingdashboard[.]mobilisedev[.]co[.]uk/includes/6WSSUhQrM[.]php\"\n\"hxxps[:]//loans[.]uhuruloans[.]com/wpincludes/sodium_compat/namespaced/Core/ChaCha20/X8av4FUl7STEot3[.]php\"\n\"hxxps[:]//practice[.]haylawdesign[.]com/wp-content/themes/twentynineteen/templateparts/content/jE4zYiuJ0iIw[.]php\"\n\"hxxps[:]//kings[.]inforwizztechnologies[.]com/wp-content/plugins/aapsidemaster/elementor/widgets/tfOSpcBiZpffptj[.]php\"\n\"hxxps[:]//pizzaplus[.]com[.]ng/wp-content/themes/twentytwentyone/templateparts/content/TZ6qTYLx7l[.]php\"\n\"hxxps[:]//efshub[.]com/PHPMailer-master/examples/images/zunuLqqNQIGJPht[.]php\"\n\"hxxps[:]//user[.]kasikoi[.]info/static/lib/ckeditor/skins/moono/2h80F9GORDfIB[.]php\"\n\"hxxps[:]//deepsource[.]in/ncsitebuilder/css/flag-icon-css/flags/1x1/wcToKXeb7FxQ[.]php\"\n\"hxxps[:]//ebanking[.]hentostreasury[.]com/account/umSqqCiyMf[.]php\"\n\n**C2 Sever IP and Port:**\n\n\"103.75.201.2:443\"\n\"158.223.1.108:6225\"\n\"165.22.28.242:4664\"\n\n**Sample SHA-256:**\n\n\n-----\n\n[HF7.TRANS 2021.08.09.xlsb]\n59C8D87A450F0647BEA930EBA1AA692B75D82DEF1358F1601C4FE9A561B4707E\n\n[DTCZ SHIP_2021.08.09.xlsb]\nC8065BD2A1443FF988E9BA95022554F6EE302E9BCB4082C3D9B2B8D74C5A4BE5\n\n[icxbouzukiasgnpfvowz.dll]\n6556E4029CF50C9538F4E02D0BCCA5356F28E6870E62838E164020A31B3DF096\n\n_Learn more about Fortinet’s_ _[FortiGuard Labs threat research and intelligence organization and the](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiguard-labs)_\n_[FortiGuard Security Subscriptions and Services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?tab=security-bundles&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=security-bundles)_\n\n_Learn more about Fortinet’s_ _[free cybersecurity training, an initiative of Fortinet’s Training Advancement](https://www.fortinet.com/training/cybersecurity-professionals?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=campaign&utm_campaign=Freetraininginitiative)_\n_Agenda (TAA), or about the_ _[Fortinet Network Security Expert program, Security Academy](https://training.fortinet.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=nse-institute)_\n_program, and_ _[Veterans program.
