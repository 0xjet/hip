Gaining counterintelligence about your adversaries' capabilities and\nweaponry is one of the final building blocks for managing a strong cyber defense. In the\npursuit of performing this duty, I have been studying how to discover adversary infrastructure\non the internet. One good way of doing this has been via leveraging the scan data available\nthrough the popular Shodan search engine. If you've not used it before, Shodan periodically\nscans the entire internet and makes it available for users to query through. It is often used to\nmonitor networks, look for vulnerabilities, and ensure the security of an organization's\nperimeter.\n\nBut we can also use Shodan for tracking the adversaries. Through the process of\nfingerprinting - that is to identify unique attributes of IPs on the internet - we can find\ncommand and control (C2) servers and login panels belonging to cybercriminals online.\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough this process, I was able to identify dozens of infostealer control panel login pages,\nas well as three infostealer malware families, called Titan Stealer, Patriot Stealer, and Raxnet\nStealer, that have not yet been reported elsewhere online (as far as I could tell).\n\nIt all started by [searching http.html:\"stealer\" in Shodan. This revealed several login pages](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=http.html%3A%22stealer%22)\n[for known and unknown infostealer malware. I have since created a page on my GitHub repo](https://github.com/BushidoUK/OSINT-SearchOperators/blob/main/ShodanAdversaryInfa.md)\nto share some Shodan dorks that help reveal adversary infrastructure.\n\n**Misha, Collector, and Titan Stealer**\n\nThe above Shodan dork revealed dozens of IPs, which if investigated were found to be login\npanels for infostealer malware families. Misha Stealer and Collector Stealer are two semi\nwell-known malware families. The \"Titan Stealer\" panel appears to be new with apparently\nno references online, vendor reports, or social media mentions by other researchers. Looks\nlike one we should track in my books.\n\n**Grand Misha (aka Misha Stealer)**\n\nShodan Dork\n\n\n-----\n\nhttp.title: misha http.component: UIKit\nURLscan Query\n\nhttps://urlscan.io/search/#filename:%22misha.css%22\nhttps://urlscan.io/search/#task.tags:%22misha%22\n\n**Collector Stealer**\n\nShodan Dork\n\nhttp.html:\"Collector Stealer\"\nhttp.html:\"getmineteam\"\nURLscan Query\n\nhttps://urlscan.io/search/#task.tags:%22collector%22\n\n**Titan Stealer**\n\nShodan Dork\n\nhttp.html:\"Titan Stealer\"\nURLscan Query\n\nhttps://urlscan.io/result/daca0fcd-bbc9-48c8-810d-89fee466b639\n\n**Patriot Stealer**\n\nThe same Shodan Dork http.html:\"stealer\" also revealed an unreported and new Malwareas-a-Service (MaaS) platform marketing itself as \"Patriot Stealer\". The paid version of the\ninfostealer malware is reportedly capable of stealing \"passwords, cookies, Autofilldata,\nTelegram session, Persistence\" and if you want to buy it you should speak to \"@kastr3\" on\nTelegram. Interestingly, the malware leverages Discord webhooks to report to the operator\nwhen a victim has been infected and data has successfully been stolen.\n\nFrom the Discord language setting in the screenshot on the website and from the description\nof the group's Telegram channel it appears the developer(s) of the Patriot Stealer are\nSpanish-speaking threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Patriot Stealer**\n\nShodan Dork\n\nhttp.favicon.hash:274603478\nhttp.html:\"patriotstealer\"\nURLscan Query\n\nhttps://urlscan.io/result/43a51776-e283-4522-ab29-ea5c7efc174a/\nTelegram Channel\n\nhxxps://t.me/patriotstealer\n\n\n-----\n\n**RAXNET Bitcoin Stealer**\n\nAgain, the trusty Shodan Dork http.html:\"stealer\" uncovered another new and unreported\ninfostealer malware called \"RAXNET Bitcoin Stealer\" that targets cryptocurrency users by\nreplacing destination wallet addresses with the cybercriminal's own wallet addresses. The\nmain features of this Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) allegedly includes \"Fully Undetectable,\nAV-bypass, Private Key Stealer, Online Logs Panel\" and has several pricing models from $80\nto $150, including \"similarity mode\" and the \"builder\" of the malware. The MaaS operators\nalso offer \"spreading methods\" for $75. Other notable services related to this MaaS were\n\"resell rights\", \"full video tutorials\", \"24/7 support\", and a \"refund policy.\"\n\n**RAXNET Bitcoin Stealer**\n\nShodan Dork\n\nhttp.favicon.hash:-1236243965\n\nURLscan Query\n\nhttps://urlscan.io/result/c4f7f543-46f5-4051-b3cb-3699d4b99c5c/\n\nDomain\n\ncryptohax[.]net\n\nTelegram\n\n@PureTX (hxxps://t.me/PureTX)\n\nE-mail\n\npunity@protonmail.com\n\n\n-----\n\nYouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@bitstorm101 (Joined 17 Nov 2022)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@punxi49 (Joined 21 Jun 2020)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNGIubac9sk (video tutorial)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9iT4VJev28 (video tutorial)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe cybercriminal underground continues to evolve, and Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)\nofferings have been a significant contributing factor for an increase in cybercrime. Aspiring\ncybercriminals no longer require the technical skills to perform such attacks, but as little as\n\n\n-----\n\n$150 dollars to run a malware campaign with a multi-featured cybercrime tool allegedly with\n\"24/7 support\" from English- and Spanish-speaking malware developers as part of the as-aService business model.\n\nThis research also highlights that the infrastructure of cybercriminals often includes several\ncommon denominators, such as email addresses and Telegram channels to communicate\nwith customers, websites and YouTube channels to advertise products, as well as\ncryptocurrency wallets to receive payments.\n\nStealing credentials on a wide scale can be useful for a plethora of attacks. The threat actor\nwho actually stole the credentials is also not always going to be the one who leverages them.\n[This is due to the growing popularity of selling stolen credentials on cybercrime forums and](https://blog.bushidotoken.net/2022/08/analysis-of-emerging-darth-maul-ecrime.html)\nmarketplaces.\n\n## Lessons from the Conti Leaks\n\n Overview of Russian GRU and SVR Cyberespionage Campaigns 1H 2022\n\n Gamer Cheater Hacker Spy\n\n\n-----",
