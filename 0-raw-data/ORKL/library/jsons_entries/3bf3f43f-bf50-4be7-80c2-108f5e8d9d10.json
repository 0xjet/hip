keys\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-dev-releases-egregor-maze-master-decryption-keys/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-dev-releases-egregor-maze-master-decryption-keys/)**\n\nLawrence Abrams\n\nBy\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n10:26 AM\n4\n\nThe master decryption keys for the Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet ransomware operations\nwere released last night on the BleepingComputer forums by the alleged malware\ndeveloper.\n\nThe [Maze ransomware began operating in May 2019 and quickly rose to fame as they](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-says-computer-type-determines-ransom-amount/)\n[were responsible for the use of data theft and double-extortion tactics now used by many](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/allied-universal-breached-by-maze-ransomware-stolen-data-leaked/)\nransomware operations.\n\nAfter [Maze announced its shutdown in October 2020, they rebranded in September as](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-is-shutting-down-its-cybercrime-operation/)\n[Egregor, who later disappeared after members were arrested in Ukraine.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/egregor-ransomware-affiliates-arrested-by-ukrainian-french-police/)\n\nThe Sekhmet operation was somewhat of an outlier as it launched in March 2020, while\nMaze was still active.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Master decryption keys released\n\nFast forward 14 months later, and the decryption keys for these operations have now been\n[leaked in the BleepingComputer forums by a user named 'Topleak' who claims to be the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/768330/leak-maze-egregor-sekhmet-keys-along-with-m0yv-expiro-source-code/)\ndeveloper for all three operations.\n\nThe poster said that this was a planned leak and is not related to recent law enforcement\n[operations that have led to the seizing of servers and the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-shuts-down-again-after-tor-sites-were-hijacked/) [arrests of ransomware affiliates.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russia-arrests-revil-ransomware-gang-members-seize-66-million/)\n\n\"Since it will raise too much clues and most of them will be false, it is necessary to\nemphasize that it is planned leak, and have no any connections to recent arrests and\ntakedowns,\" explained the alleged ransomware developer.\n\nThey further stated that none of their team members will ever return to ransomware and\nthat they destroyed all of the source code for their ransomware.\n\n**Forum post leaking Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet decryption keys**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe post includes a download link for a 7zip file with four archives containing the Maze,\nEgregor, and Sekhmet decryption keys, and the source code for a 'M0yv' malware used by\nthe ransomware gang.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Archive containing the leaked decryption keys**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nEach of these archives contains the public master encryption key and the private master\ndecryption key associated with a specific \"advert\", or affiliate of the ransomware operation.\n\nIn total, the following are the number of RSA-2048 master decryption keys released per\nransomware operation:\n\n**Maze: 9 master decryption keys for the original malware that targeted non-corporate**\nusers.\n**Maze: 30 master decryption keys.**\n**Egregor: 19 master decryption keys.**\n**Sekhmet: 1 master decryption key.**\n\nEmsisoft's [Michael Gillespie and](https://twitter.com/demonslay335) [Fabian Wosar has reviewed the decryption keys and](https://twitter.com/fwosar)\nconfirmed to BleepingComputer that they are legitimate and can be used to decrypt files\nencrypted by the three ransomware families.\n\nGillespie told us that the keys are used to decrypt a victim's encrypted keys that are\nembedded in a ransom note.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypted key in Maze ransom note**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nEmsisoft has [released a decryptor to allow any Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet victims who](https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/maze-sekhmet-egregor)\nhave been waiting to recover their files for free.\n\n**Emsisoft decryptor for Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet**\nTo use the decryptor, victims will need ransom note created during the attack as it contains\nthe encrypted decryption key.\n\n## Bonus M0yv malware source code\n\n\n-----\n\nThe archive also includes the source code for the M0yv modular x86/x64 file infector\ndeveloped by the Maze ransomware operation and used previously in attacks.\n\n\"Also there is a little bit harmless source code of polymorphic x86/x64 modular EPO file\ninfector m0yv detected in the wild as Win64/Expiro virus, but it is not expiro actually, but AV\nengines detect it like this, so no single thing in common with gazavat,\" the ransomware\ndeveloper said in the forum post.\n\n\"M0yv source is a bonus, because there was no any major source code of resident software\nfor years now, so here we go,\" the developer later explained.\n\nThis source code come in the form of a Microsoft Visual Studio project and includes some\nalready compiled DLLs.\n\n**Source code snippet for the M0yv malware**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe todo.txt file indicates the source code for this malware was last updated on January\n19th, 2022.\n\n###
