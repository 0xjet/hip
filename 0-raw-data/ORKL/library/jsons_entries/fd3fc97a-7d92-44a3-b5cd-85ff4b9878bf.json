The Cyber\nCentre has become aware of this ransomware recently affecting the Canadian public.\n\n## Assessment\n\nThe initial infection vector for this malware appears to be through Remote Desktop services,\nand other infection vectors may include email spam and malicious attachments, deceptive\ndownloads, botnets, malicious ads, web injects, fake updates and repackaged and infected\ninstallers. Once a malicious actor infects a system, they may attempt to move laterally across\nthe network through tools such as PowerShell Empire, PSExec, etc.\n\nThe malware will initially contact a Command and Control(C2) server to indicate its readiness\nto encrypt the contents on the target system. It will then delete shadow copies and disable\nrecovery features in Windows 10 and create persistence by adding a key in the logged in\n\n\n-----\n\nuser s software registry hive. It will encrypt files and mark them by inserting the string\n\"*tflower\" at the beginning of the file but will not change the filename.\n\nFinally the malware will update the C2 server and leave a ransom note named\n“!_Notice_!.txt” placed throughout the computer and on the Windows Desktop.\n\nThe Cyber Centre recommends that all system owners apply the latest security patches\nimmediately, and that system users are reminded to be vigilant when following unsolicited\nlinks and opening unexpected document attachments in emails, even if they come from\nknown contacts.\n\n## Suggested action\n\nInstall the latest updates for the vulnerable operating systems.\nDisable Remote Desktop Services if not required. If required, closely monitor network\ntraffic and the logs of any vulnerable systems for suspicious activity.\nEnable Network Level Authentication (NLA) on all currently supported versions of\nWindows. This is a partial mitigation which will prevent the spread of the malware. With\nNLA enabled, an actor would first need to have credentials to an account on the target\nsystem.\nBlock TCP port 3389 on the firewall, if possible. This will prevent unauthorized access\nfrom the Internet.\nNever open attachments from unknown or unverified sources.\nWhitelist applications to prevent unauthorized applications from running.\nUse antivirus and ensure that it is diligently kept up to date.\nMinimize the number of users with administrative privileges and ensure users do not\nhave privileges to install software on their devices without the authorization of an\nadministrator.\nDisable macros for documents received via email.\nFollow the Government of Canada’s guidance to stay CyberSafe\n[https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/index-en.aspx](https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/index-en.aspx.)\n\n## References\n\nCCCS Alert on Critical Remote Desktop Vulnerability: https://cyber.gc.ca/en/alerts/criticalmicrosoft-remote-desktop-vulnerability\n\n## Note to readers\n\nThe Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) operates as part of the\nCommunications Security Establishment. We are Canada's national authority on cyber\nsecurity and we lead the government's response to cyber security events. As Canada's\nnational computer security incident response team, the Cyber Centre works in close\ncollaboration with government departments critical infrastructure Canadian businesses and\n\n\n-----\n\ninternational partners to prepare for, respond to, mitigate, and recover from cyber events. We\ndo this by providing authoritative advice and support, and coordinating information sharing\nand incident response. The Cyber Centre is outward-facing, welcoming partnerships that\nhelp build a stronger, more resilient cyber space in Canada.\n\n\n-----",
