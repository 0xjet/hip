These email\ncampaigns feature several notable characteristics that appear designed to evade detection\nand maximize the effectiveness of these campaigns. The use of web-based contact forms,\nlegitimate hosting platforms, and a specific crypter make analysis and detection more\ndifficult. All of the malware samples associated with these campaigns feature a modified\nDOS header containing the string \"Salfram,\" making them extremely easy to track over time.\nThe crypter used in these campaigns is undergoing active development and improvements\nto obfuscate the contents of malware payloads. Additionally, the crypter uses several\neffective techniques to make the detection and analysis of the final malware payload more\ndifficult. It obfuscates the original payload binaries in a way that results in payloads that\nappear completely different from each other after being packed using the same crypter. It\neven takes a great amount of effort to compare the packed binaries in a disassembler and\ndetermine if the same packer was used.\n\n## Distribution campaigns\n\nThe email distribution campaigns associated with these malware payloads feature\ncharacteristics designed to evade detection and make analysis and tracking more difficult. In\nmost cases, the threat actor was initiating email-based communications with potential victims\nusing the contact forms present on the victim organization's website This results in email\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunications that appear to originate from legitimate sources which may allow the\nadversaries to evade some email security mechanisms.\n\nIn the messages, the attacker purports to be the copyright owner of images that the attacker\nclaims they found hosted on the target organization's website without their permission. The\nemail contents are somewhat customized, listing the target organization's domain as the\nwebsite containing the infringing content and prompting them to access a hyperlink present\nin the email. Figure 1 is an example of one of the emails associated with one of these\ncampaigns.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 2 is another example of these emails, demonstrating how the contents of individual\nmessages may change based on the contact form and website configuration for the\norganization being targeted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2\n\nIn analyzing malicious contact form submissions associated with these campaigns, we\nobtained information about the system used to submit the form contents. The contact form\nsubmissions were performed via proxy servers using an automated mechanism, such as\nscripting, to generate and submit the data.\n\nThe majority of the emails contained links to a malicious file hosted on Google Drive. The\ndirectory structure and parameter values rotate frequently across various emails. Figure 3\nlists some examples of these URLs.\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n-----\n\nAgain, the use of a legitimate web platform for hosting the malicious content may provide\nanother way for the attacker to evade various protections that may be deployed in\nenvironments that they are targeting. When the URL is accessed, the victim is delivered a\nmalicious file, often a Microsoft Office document similar to the one in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4\n\nThese documents contain malicious macros that initiate the infection process and are\nresponsible for retrieving a malicious payload and executing it to infect the system. The\npayloads delivered have varied over time. Over the past several months, we have observed\ncampaigns being used to deliver various information stealers, banking trojans and other\n[malware loaders including but not limited to Gozi ISFB, ZLoader,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/03/gozi-isfb-remains-active-in-2018.html) [SmokeLoader, Oski,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/smoking-guns-smoke-loader-learned-new.html)\nAveMaria and Cobalt Strike payloads, among others.\n\nWe also discovered infection chains that deliver multiple payloads to a single victim as part of\na multi-stage infection process. While the payload delivery features several distinct malware\nfamilies, in all of the campaigns observed, the initial malware payloads used the same\ncrypter, which obfuscates the malicious contents present in the binary executable and make\nanalysis more difficult. As shown in Figure 5 these samples can be quickly observed as the\npacked samples feature a specific modification to the DOS stub:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5\n\nThe next section describes how these techniques have been implemented and how to\nanalyze samples that may have been obfuscated using this crypter.\n\n## Technical overview\n\nThe obfuscation techniques used by this packer are not trivial, so it is surprising that all of the\nbinaries observed contained the easily-trackable string \"Salfram\" inside the DOS stub.\nFurther investigation is required to determine if the packer is automatically modifying\ncontents of the DOS stub or if this is being done by the actor behind the campaigns.\n\nThe samples we analyzed have compiler or debug timestamps ranging from April 2019 to\nAugust 2020, but the majority of samples are from January 2020 onward. The campaigns\nbefore are either quite small or just tests. The binary structure of many of the samples is\ndifferent, with differences ranging from minor changes all the way to code execution flows\nthat are completely different. Nevertheless, they share the same or at least a very similar\nlogic. It is hard to say if these changes are due to the use of different obfuscation features\navailable within the crypter, or the use of different versions of the crypter. Comparing the\nsamples we analyzed, we believe it is a bit of both — the crypter is frequently updated and\nactively maintained by the software author.\n\nThe following section describes a subset of the typical differences and similarities which we\nhave observed when analyzing samples leveraging this obfuscator.\n\nThe majority of the samples begin with a common initialization routine (security_init_cookie)\nand then jump to the main unpacking function. This function may vary in different samples\nand even the start up looks different in the newer samples. Figures 6 - 8 show the startup\nand unpacking functions in three different samples.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Sample 4bfd547775ba5892e66d2ff6a0c1de4365ab11b3_exe.bin\n(946d4d332a06b9af10da38beb3e8195054840b59a870a2f9027e6471f4869dc6)\n\nFigure 7: Sample 9679f2690d31cee38e57f080656b8618ca474c65_exe.bin\n(9b28aa737bbfec90341c6a42e2d44f3308659e4fb9dd42d98a0b46cde7aaed63)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Sample 64800a2f85e12090eea5109e05d969a08ae9850a_exe.bin\n(0c09ea2d5722a2484804bf8c4f051d66d8a95d23c19e5d1277a55cafd80b67be)\n\nWhat they all have in common is that they push many unpacking-related values to the stack\nand insert a large number of fake API calls in between. Figure 6 shows the nonsense\narguments handed over to GetModuleFilenameA. Figure 9 shows another example of this:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9\n\nThe other common feature is that the crypter breaks up the code into many basic blocks that\nare connected via jumps and return instructions. Most are unconditional jumps, but there are\nalso ones using conditions which are always true or false — in other words, the code flow is\nalways predefined. Further, especially at locations like non-fake API calls, the code pushes\nthe address of the next code block or API call to the stack and uses the return instruction to\njump to it. This results in spaghetti code that is difficult to decipher. Besides obfuscated\ndisassembly code, the fake API calls can also confuse weak behaviour-based detection\nsystems and/or may be used to detect certain emulation-based systems. Due to the amount\nof API calls, we haven't analyzed the latter in detail.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe next layer of protection comes with a bunch of self-modification routines. After it sets the\nstage hidden inside the spaghetti code, the vast majority of samples execute a selfmodification routine via \"call eax\" (Figures 10 and 11).\n\nFigure 10: Sample 4bfd547775ba5892e66d2ff6a0c1de4365ab11b3_exe.bin\n(946d4d332a06b9af10da38beb3e8195054840b59a870a2f9027e6471f4869dc6)\n\nFigure 11: Sample 9679f2690d31cee38e57f080656b8618ca474c65_exe.bin\n(9b28aa737bbfec90341c6a42e2d44f3308659e4fb9dd42d98a0b46cde7aaed63)\n\n\n-----\n\nAgain, as shown in Figures 12 and 13, the code around this call looks different across\ndifferent samples and even the instructions used to decode the bytes which are to be\nmodified are different across different samples.\n\nFigure 12: Sample 4bfd547775ba5892e66d2ff6a0c1de4365ab11b3_exe.bin\n(946d4d332a06b9af10da38beb3e8195054840b59a870a2f9027e6471f4869dc6) decoding\n\ninstructions\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Sample 9679f2690d31cee38e57f080656b8618ca474c65_exe.bin\n(9b28aa737bbfec90341c6a42e2d44f3308659e4fb9dd42d98a0b46cde7aaed63) decoding\n\ninstructions\n\nTracing over the instructions in x64dbg (Figure 14) shows the differences (Figure 15) in the\ndecoding algorithm per sample.\n\nFigure 14 - X64dbg trace over settings\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15\n\nLooking into the decoded bytes, the first 24 bytes are just rubbish to hide the real start of the\nfunction. The function later called starts at offset 24 and looks like Figure 16.\n\nFigure 16: ZWAllocateVirtualMemory\n\n\n-----\n\nIt resolves the address of the native API call ZWAllocateVirtualMemory at address 00415003\nin Figure 11 and executes it via the return instruction at 0041503D. It calls this and similar\nfunctions several times while unpacking the final payload. The number of times varies based\non the sample being analyzed. It fills these allocated buffers with helper functions which are\nused for further self modifications or unpacking procedures of the payload. The last allocated\nbuffer is then finally filled with the unpacked malware payload. The code used for these steps\nvaries across samples.\n\nSample 9679f2690d31cee38e57f080656b8618ca474c65_exe.bin\n(9b28aa737bbfec90341c6a42e2d44f3308659e4fb9dd42d98a0b46cde7aaed63) is adapting\nand then injecting the payload into its own PE image in memory at the end (Figure 17).\n\nFigure 17: Overwriting own PE image in memory with payload\n\nOther samples simply unpack the payload to the aforementioned buffer and jump into it\n(Figure 18) e.g. sample\nb95fe75736d19887ae4e3516c5cd9c7fa7caf763a138794f9aaecdee8d37f0b0. At the end, no\nmatter the sample version, they all use a \"jmp edx\" to hand over execution control to the\npayload (Figure 18 - first line).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18\n\nThe last technique to mention is primarily observed in older samples, but it is hard to say if\nthis is an evolution of the packer or just an additional feature enabled while building the\npacked binary.\n\nHaving a closer look to the PE image in Figures 17 and 18 also shows that the samples even\nhave different segments. In other words, as previously mentioned, the diversity of samples\npacked with this crypter is quite high.\n\nIf you want to get an idea of all the different layers and self modifications we are providing\ntwo unpacking scripts for the samples\n9679f2690d31cee38e57f080656b8618ca474c65_exe.bin\n(9b28aa737bbfec90341c6a42e2d44f3308659e4fb9dd42d98a0b46cde7aaed63) and\n2d46c394a5c4722e7fccfd3bc92636b5a0b6fbec_exe.bin\n(b95fe75736d19887ae4e3516c5cd9c7fa7caf763a138794f9aaecdee8d37f0b0) in the\nAppendix of this post.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnly use these scripts for the samples mentioned in the header of the script. Be careful\nusing them for other samples released before this blog post. Anyone looking to dissect this\nmore should be extremely careful with new samples released after this blog post — it is very\nlikely the adversaries will modify the packer. Keep in mind that these scripts do not work for\nevery sample. It is recommended to single-step through the scripts (TAB) to verify that the\ndifferent steps are working for the sample being analyzed.\n\nThe video below shows the unpacking process for sample\n9679f2690d31cee38e57f080656b8618ca474c65_exe.bin\n(9b28aa737bbfec90341c6a42e2d44f3308659e4fb9dd42d98a0b46cde7aaed63) which is the\nlatest sample we looked at. The file's timestamp suggests that it was built on Monday, Aug.\n24, 2020.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2j-3UI522pU\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe email distribution campaigns associated with samples built using this crypter feature\nseveral notable characteristics designed to evade detection and make tracking and analysis\nmore difficult. The use of web-based contact forms demonstrates how adversaries can take\nadvantage of any communications pathway to internal employees to attempt to infect\norganizational systems with malware. And the inclusion of legitimate hosting platforms\nmakes it more difficult to respond to these campaigns — some organizations may require\naccess to the same platform for legitimate business purposes. The crypter used to obfuscate\nvarious malware families features several interesting techniques which are used to make\nanalysis more difficult The diverse list of malware families being distributed by adversaries\n\n\n-----\n\ncreates a variety of risks to organizations which should be considered by defenders who are\nresponsible for security corporate environments. These campaigns and the refinement of the\nTTPs being used will likely continue for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nmalware detailed in this post.
