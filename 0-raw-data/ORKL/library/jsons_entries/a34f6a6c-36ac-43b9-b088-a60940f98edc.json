Anubis Network is a C2 portal developed to control fake portals and aims to\nsteal credentials to fully access the real systems.\n\nThis C2 server is controlled by a group of operators that come from the previous analysis in\n2022, the various brands being divided among the operators of the group (in a call\ncenter modus operandi).\n\n[This campaign is highlighted by Segurança Informática in 2020, and the high-level](https://seguranca-informatica.pt/the-evolution-of-phishing-infrastructure-a-large-scale-campaign-called-anubis-that-targets-brazilian-and-portuguese-internet-users/#.Ysq_gHbMIQ9)\ndiagram of this new campaign can be observed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: High-level diagram of the ANUBIS phishing network and its components (2020)._**\n\nIn detail, this fresh campaign is composed of three crucial operating components:\n\n**the delivery vehicle to propagate the landing page in the wild; usually carried out**\n**through smishing (SMS) and phishing (email)**\n**a malicious landing page hosted on a cloud server, composed of a user interface**\n**and layout very similar to the real system**\n**an operation back-end that allows criminals to manage the details of users who**\n**have fallen into the trap.**\n\nFigure 2 presents an example of an SMS sent to Internet end-users during the ANUBIS\nsocial engineering wave. The image is related to an ongoing campaign in Portugal\nimpersonating a specific organization to steal banking credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Example of SMS sent during the social engineering wave._**\n\nSMSs are sent based on a list created by the C2 owner, namely: 1kk-rusha-01.txt.\n\n**Fake domains hosted automatically on Cloudflare CDN**\n\nThe ANUBIS network phishing campaigns are masked through the Cloudflare CDN.\nOperators can easily make this configuration through an interface that uses the CloudFlare\nAPI for configuring new DNS zones.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3: Feature of adding new domains and configuring them behind the Cloudflare CDN_**\n_via the ANUBIS back office portal._\n\n**The Phishing template**\n\nOne of the last campaigns disseminated by criminals is impersonating a popular service in\nPortugal with the goal of stealing credentials of home banking portals.\n\nAfter clicking on the link distributed via smishing, the victims are redirected to a specific\nlanding page that collects the mobile phone number and the associated code (PIN). As\nobserved, criminals are using the Let’s Encrypt CA to create valid HTTPs certificates.\n\n**_Figure 4: Phishing template of ANUBIS Network campaign._**\n\nAfter clicking on “CONTINUAR“, a new page is presented. Additional data from the victim are\nrequested by the server-side and added to session cookies.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: Additional details about the victims are stored on the session cookies._**\n\nAs observed, 12 target banks operating in Portugal are listed in this specific campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 6: Target banks present on the Anubis Network campaign in Portugal._**\n\nIn the next step, credentials to access the target portals are requested.\n\n**_Figure 7: Credentials to access the real systems are requested._**\n\nAdditional details related to credit cards are also requested by criminals. A specific loading\npage is then presented, and ANUBIS operators can request other details via the C2 portal in\na call center modus operandi.\n\n**_Figure 8: Additional information requested by criminals._**\n\n**Anubis Network C2 Panel**\n\n\n-----\n\nBy analyzing the landing page source code, the URL of the C2 server can be obtained.\n\n**_Figure 9: Endpoint of the Anubis Network C2 server present on the source code._**\n\nAs observed, the C2 login page is linked to a legitimate system in order to confuse threat\nanalysts.\n\n**_Figure 10: Login page of Anubis Network C2 server._**\n\nThe features observed inside the C2 server are very similar to the analysis performed in\n2020. Operators can control all the infection flow by requesting additional details and\naccessing the real system in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 10: Internal pages where Anubis Network operators can control all the malicious flow._**\n\nIn detail, global administrators are capable of adding users to specific target organizations as\nobserved below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11: Anubis Network operators and permissions page with the target organizations._**\n\nAccording to the MySQL database that supports the system, there are 77 operators in the\nsystem – which represents the business and operational volume of this malicious scheme.\n\nadmin@anubisnetwork.com\namigoquatro@anubisnetwork.com\namigorusha@anubisnetwork.com.br\namigowscincor@anubisnetwork.com\n\n\n-----\n\namigowsdois@anubisnetwork.com.br\namigowsum@anubisnetwork.com.br\nanubis@anubisnetwork.com\naprendiz@anubisnetwork.net\nazzouzmarzuk@anubisnetwork.net\nbanzeiro@anubisnetwork.net\nbatman@anubisnetwork.com\nbicudo@anubisnetwork.com\nbigj@anubisnetwork.net\nBk_Delas@anubisnetwork.com\nbuchuda@anubisnetwork.net\nceiffador@networkanubis.online\ndimitri@anubisnetwork.com\ndk@anubisnetwork.com\nel@anubisnetwork.com\nelpablito@anubisnetwork.net\nestranho@anubisnetwork.one\nfezon@anubisnetwork.com\nfrost@anubisnetwork.com\nfugitivo@network.com.br\ngringo@anubisnetwork.net\nice@anubisnetwork.com\njreis@anubisnetwork.com\njunim@anubisnetwork.com\nkatatal@anubisnetwork.com\nkingg@anubisnetwork.com\nklebinho@anubisnetwork.com\nknabzdg@anubisnetwork.com\nlbooy@anubisnetwork.com\nleffzera@anubisnetwork.com.br\nlobinho@anubisnetwork.net\nlordk@anubisnetwork.com\nmagao@anubisnetwork.com\nmalware@anubisnetwork.com\nmandrake@anubisnetwork.com\nmaxter@anubisnetwork.one\nmirror@anubisnetwork.com\nmk@anubisnetwork.com\nnetota@anubisnetwork.com\nnivel3@anubisnetwork.com\noperador@anubisnetwork.com\npapoko@networkanubis.online\n\n\n-----\n\nplasma@anubisnetwork.com\npoke@anubisnetwork.com\npppp@anubisnetwork.com.br\nppppe@anubisnetwork.com\nprofessor@anubisnetwork.com.br\nr0bust0@anubisnetwork.com\nredir@redir.com\nreynan@anubisnetwork.com.br\nricaria@anubisnetwork.com\nrk@anubisnetwork.com\nrodrigues@anubisnetwork.net\nrushador@anubisnetwork.com\nrushadorr@anubisnetwork.com\nsavior@anubisnetwork.com.br\nshao@anubisnetwork.com.br\nskull@anubisnetwork.com\nskulll@anubisnetwork.com\nstealth@anubisnetwork.com\nstealth@anubisnetwork.net\nsujo@anubisnetwork.net\ntiocris@anubisnetwork.com\ntrakino@anubisnetwork.com\ntraks@anubisnetwork.com\nvelhodick@anubisnetwork.net\nwill@anunisnetwork.com\nws@anubisnetwork.com.br\nwyzgoi@anubisnetwork.net\nx0rg@anubisnetwork.com\nxinxa@anubisnetwork.com\nzeus@anubisnetwork.net\nzezinho@anubisnetwork.com\n\nAn interesting feature also implemented in this new version of the C2 portal is the email\n**temp. By using this feature, criminals can create new domains and use internal emails to**\nmanage all the processes.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 12: Anubis Network email temp feature._**\n\nThe landing pages presented to the victims and specific data can be configured on the\nAnubis Network administrative portal.

This database is used for data\nsynchronization between all components of the malicious ecosystem and maintains\neverything up-to-date each second.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 15: Database schema of the ANUBIS phishing network._**\n\nAdditional details, including final thoughts and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are available\nin the original analysis published by the Pedro Tavares\n\nhttps://seguranca-informatica.pt/anubis-networks-is-back-with-new-c2server/#.Ysv53XZBy5d\n\n**About the author:** **[Pedro Tavarez](https://twitter.com/sirpedrotavares)**\n\nPedro Tavares is a professional in the field of information security working as an Ethical\nHacker, Malware Analyst and also a Security Evangelist.
