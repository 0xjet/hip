Based off a number of intended victims, we can tell that Silent Librarian\ndoes not limit itself to specific countries but tries to get wider coverage.\n\nEven though many phishing sites have been identified and taken down, the threat actor has\nbuilt enough of them to continue with a successful campaign against staff and students alike.\n\n## A persistent threat actor with a perfect attendance record\n\n[In March 2018, nine Iranians were indicted by the US Department of Justice for conducting](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-iranians-charged-conducting-massive-cyber-theft-campaign-behalf-islamic-revolutionary)\nattacks against universities and other organizations with the goal of stealing research and\nproprietary data.\n\nYet, both in August [2018 and](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/back-to-school-cobalt-dickens-targets-universities) [2019 Silent Librarian was lining up for the new academic years,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/seems-phishy-back-school-lures-target-university-students-and-staff)\nonce again targeting the same kind of victims in over a dozen countries.\n\n\n-----\n\nIT administrators working at universities have a particularly tough job considering that their\ncustomers, namely students and teachers, are among the most difficult to protect due to their\nbehaviors. Despite that, they also contribute to and access research that could be worth\nmillions or billions of dollars.\n\nConsidering that Iran is dealing with constant sanctions, it strives to keep up with world\ndevelopments in various fields, including that of technology. As such, these attacks represent\na national interest and are well funded.\n\n## Same pattern in phishing domain registration\n\nThe new domain names follow the same pattern as previously reported, except that they\nswap the top level domain name for another. We know that the threat actor has used the\n“.me” TLD in their past campaigns against some academic intuitions and this is still the case,\nalong side “.tk” and “.cf”.\n\nThis new phishing campaign has been tracked by several security researchers on Twitter,\nnotably [Peter Kruse from the](https://twitter.com/peterkruse) [CSIS Security Group.](https://csis.dk/)\n\n**Phishing site** **Legitimate site** **Target**\n\nlibrary.adelaide.crev.me library.adelaide.edu.au The University of Adelaide\nLibrary\n\nsignon.adelaide.edu.au.itlib.me library.adelaide.edu.au The University of Adelaide\nLibrary\n\nblackboard.gcal.crev.me blackboard.gcal.ac.uk Glasgow Caledonian\nUniversity\n\nblackboard.stonybrook.ernn.me blackboard.stonybrook.edu Stony Brook University\n\nblackboard.stonybrook.nrni.me blackboard.stonybrook.edu Stony Brook University\n\nnamidp.services.uu.nl.itlib.me namidp.services.uu.nl Universiteit Utrecht\n\nuu.blackboard.rres.me uu.blackboard.com Universiteit Utrecht\n\nlibrarysso.vu.cvrr.me librarysso.vu.edu.au Victoria University\n\nole.bris.crir.me ole.bris.ac.uk University of Bristol\n\nidpz.utorauth.utoronto.ca.itlf.cf idpz.utorauth.utoronto.ca University of Toronto\n\nraven.cam.ac.uk.iftl.tk raven.cam.ac.uk University of Cambridge\n\nlogin.ki.se.iftl.tk login.ki.se Karolinska Medical\nInstitutet\n\n\n-----\n\nshib.york.ac.uk.iftl.tk shib.york.ac.uk University of York\n\nsso.id.kent.ac.uk.iftl.tk sso.id.kent.ac.uk University of Kent\n\nidp3.it.gu.se.itlf.cf idp3.it.gu.se Göteborg universitet\n\nlogin.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca.sftt.cf login.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca Western University\nCanada\n\nlogin.libproxy.kcl.ac.uk.itlt.tk kcl.ac.uk King’s College London\n\nidcheck2.qmul.ac.uk.sftt.cf qmul.ac.uk Queen Mary University of\nLondon\n\nlms.latrobe.aroe.me lms.latrobe.edu.au Melbourne Victoria\nAustralia\n\nntulearn.ntu.ninu.me ntulearn.ntu.edu.sg Nanyang Technological\nUniversity\n\nadfs.lincoln.ac.uk.itlib.me adfs.lincoln.ac.uk University of Lincoln\n\ncas.thm.de.itlib.me cas.thm.de TH Mittelhessen University\nof Applied Sciences\n\nlibproxy.library.unt.edu.itlib.me library.unt.edu University of North Texas\n\nshibboleth.mcgill.ca.iftl.tk shibboleth.mcgill.ca McGill University\n\nvle.cam.ac.uk.canm.me vle.cam.ac.uk University of Cambridge\n\nTable 1: List of phishing sites and targets\n[Registering these subdomains to perform phishing attacks against universities is a known](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing/)\nbehavior for this APT group and therefore we can expect that they were registered by the\nsame actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Phishing site for the University of Adelaide\n\n## Phishing sites hosted in Iran\n\nThe threat actor uses Cloudflare for most of their phishing hostnames in order to hide the\nreal hosting origin. However, with some external help we were able to identify some of their\ninfrastructure located on Iran-based hosts.\n\nIt may seem odd for an attacker to use infrastructure in their own country, possibly pointing a\nfinger at them. However, here it simply becomes another bulletproof hosting option based on\nthe lack of cooperation between US or European law enforcement and local police in Iran.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Part of the phishing infrastructure showing connections with Iran\nClearly we only uncovered a small portion of this phishing operation. Although for the most\npart the sites are taken down quickly, the attacker has the advantage of being one step\nahead and is going for many possible targets at once.\n\nWe are continuing to monitor this campaign and are keeping our customers safe by blocking\nthe phishing sites.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nlibrary[.]adelaide[.]crev[.]me\n\nsignon[.]adelaide[.]edu[.]au[.]itlib[.]me\n\nblackboard[.]gcal[.]crev[.]me\n\nblackboard[.]stonybrook[.]ernn[.]me\n\nblackboard[.]stonybrook[.]nrni[.]me\n\nnamidp[.]services[.]uu[.]nl[.]itlib[.]me\n\nuu[.]blackboard[.]rres[.]me\n\nlibrarysso[.]vu[.]cvrr[.]me\n\nole[.]bris[.]crir[.]me\n\nidpz[.]utorauth[.]utoronto[.]ca[.]itlf[.]cf\n\nraven[.]cam[.]ac[.]uk[.]iftl[.]tk\n\nlogin[.]ki[.]se[.]iftl[.]tk\n\nshib[.]york[.]ac[.]uk[.]iftl[.]tk\n\nsso[.]id[.]kent[.]ac[.]uk[.]iftl[.]tk\n\nidp3[.]it[.]gu[.]se[.]itlf[.]cf\n\nlogin[.]proxy1[.]lib[.]uwo[.]ca[.]sftt[.]cf\n\n\n-----\n\nlogin[.]libproxy[.]kcl[.]ac[.]uk[.]itlt[.]tk\nidcheck2[.]qmul[.]ac[.]uk[.]sftt[.]cf\nlms[.]latrobe[.]aroe[.]me\nntulearn[.]ntu[.]ninu[.]me\nadfs[.]lincoln[.]ac[.]uk[.]itlib[.]me\ncas[.]thm[.]de[.]itlib[.]me\nlibproxy[.]library[.]unt[.]edu[.]itlib[.]me\nshibboleth[.]mcgill[.]ca[.]iftl[.]tk\nvle[.]cam[.]ac[.]uk[.]canm[.]me\n\n158[.]58[.]184[.]213\n46[.]209[.]20[.]154\n103[.]127[.]31[.]155\n\n\n-----",
