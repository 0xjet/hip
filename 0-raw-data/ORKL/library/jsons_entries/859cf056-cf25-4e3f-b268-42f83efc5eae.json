In the\npast weeks, REvil has attacked multiple large companies by targeting several MSPs.\n\nPreviously, Russian-speaking underground forums have restricted the promotion of\nransomware groups such as REvil and have cracked down on deleting and banning forum\nmembers who attempt to post related topics. However, REvil still attempted to continue their\ninteractions with the community.\n\nOn July 13, multiple forums held discussions on REvil’s disappearance. Members discussed\nif the servers were actually down, and what was the likely cause of it. Some cybercriminals\nbelieved this could be due to law enforcement intervention, but others mocked this assertion\nby stating that the disappearance of REvil’s blogs in no way implied the disappearance of\ntheir operations. Overall, underground leaders agreed that REvil will return, possibly under a\nnew name, and continue their cyberattacks.\n\n_DarkWeb forum discussion on REvil’s disappearance - Threat actors suggest REvil_\n_disappearance is temporary_\n\nOn June 17, 2021, United States President, Joe Biden, met with Russian President, Vladimir\nPutin, at Geneva where Biden pushed for Russia to crack down on cyber-crime and\nransomware groups. As stated, DarkWeb forums members do not believe that US law\nenforcement had a hand in the REvil’s infrastructural shutdowns, however, they hinted at a\npossibility of the shutdown caused by a Russian law enforcement operation. AdvIntel\nanalysts have analyzed several possible scenarios for the possible reasons for REvil’s\ndisappearance.\n\n**Scenario Analysis**\n\n**_Scenario 1 - International / US Law Enforcement (LE) operation_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is the clearest assumption due to Biden s push on cyberattacks from Russia at the\nGeneva convention, however, Putin does not seem bothered by it. It is more likely that the\nBiden administration hopes to take credit. Except for President Biden's statement that it\nwould make sense for the United States to attack computer servers used by ransomware\ngroups, there is currently no evidence proving that this has been the case, to support this\nscenario as plausible.\n\n**_Scenario 2 - Russian Law Enforcement (LE) operation_**\n\nAdvIntel assesses with a moderate level of confidence that this is a possible scenario behind\nREvil’s disappearance. DarkWeb chatter conducted by Russian-speaking cybercriminals\nsince June 2021, has been explicitly centered around fears of such an operation. According\nto elite underground members, fears of an action by the Russian law enforcement have been\nthe main reason for Avaddon ransomware withdrawal and may refer to other groups as well.\n\nElite threat actor starting a forum thread which will become very popular - the thread was\ndevoted to fears of US-Russia cooperation against ransomware and cybercrime leading to\nRussian law enforcement operations against hackers\n\nThread Translation\n\n_In light of recent events (pipeline ransomware attack): rapprochement between the USA and_\n_the Russian Federation, extradition of hackers from the Russian Federation to the USA in a_\n_special order, an agreement on consultations in the field of cybersecurity - what do you think_\n_about these developments?_\n\n_Russia is no longer safe haven (for hackers)? and if in our country extradition is supposedly_\n_prohibited under the Constitution, why is such an option is discussed? Maybe you have_\n_some insider information (from the government) or ideas about how it will actually work._\n\n_The speed with which they (FBI) managed to return the main payment (for Colonial Pipeline_\n_ransom) also raises questions. What if the affiliate (responsible for ransom payment) was_\n_arrested here in Russia (and returned the payment) They (DarkSide) were unlikely to be so_\n\n\n-----\n\n_stupid as to simply upload money onto the crypto exchange._\n\nOther top-tier forum members joined the thread discussion and agreed that ongoing tight\ncooperation happens between the US and Russia leading to arrests and operations against\nRussian-based ransomware affiliates.\n\nThe main interpretation offered by the actors is that Russia is trying to mitigate the\nconsequences of 2016-2020 cyberattacks against the US in order to achieve a more stable\nrelationship with Biden.\n\n**_Russia is no longer safe haven (for hackers)?_**\n\n**_Scenario 3 - Outage is planned by REvil_**\n\nThe behavior patterns and coordination of REvil suggest a planned outage and revaluation\nfor future attacks. For example, Babuk ransomware shut down after the Washington Metro\nPolice hack then returned as a new entity. DarkSide attempted the same operation after the\nColonial Pipeline. REvil’s patterns suggest the same line of action.\n\nMost likely the group was forced to take such actions as the cybercrime community became\nopenly rejecting REvil and seeing it as a potential trigger for a complex retaliatory operation\nby the US government.\n\n_Threat actor offering a pentest job position for their ransomware group openly asking former_\n_REvil adverts to not contact them._\n\nThe bad reputation associated with REvil may have led to the creation of a critical mass of\nrejection after the MSPs attack. This may have lead to REvil being forced to rebrand. On\nJune 24, 2021, threat actors started to report on stolen REvil source code which was likely\nleaked as an attempt of the syndicate to rebrand and reemerge under a new name.\n\n\n-----\n\n_\"Unknown\" - the alleged leader of REvil has been banned from major community forums on_\n_July 13, 2021_\n\n_The four most popular opinions (by percent of actors sharing the opinion) discussed by top-_\n_tier/elite members of the cybercrime community, regarding the REvil disappearance. The_\n_most popular version (41,2%) is that REvil decided to shut down their systems to rebrand._\n_Law enforcement actions are the second most popular version,_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\n-----\n\nCommunication between threat actors on underground forums suggests that the\ndisappearance of REvil prompts a greater resurfacing of the ransomware group. Yet no\nevidence to suggest an outage caused by law enforcement. Threat actors on forums call to\nmind a common rebranding strategy used by ransomware syndicates. Often, after largescale attacks, groups will go dark and rebuild infrastructure. AdvIntel analysts point out that\nREvil could be anticipating government actions. Underground actors anticipate a “sequel\ncoming soon” for REvil entitled, “GranCrab-REvil.”\n\n\n-----",
