Also known as\nFonixCrypter or Xinof, this family of malware was initially spotted in June 2020 and went out\nof business in late January this year. The news, broken by one of the project’s\nadministrators, also includes master keys and a bare-bones decryptor that can potentially be\nused to recover one file at a time.\n\nBitdefender researchers have been working on a free decryptor that can safely help victims\nget back their ransomed information for free.\n\n_The tool works on an infected PC with an active internet connection._\n\nHow to use this tool\n\n**Step 1: Download the decryption tool below and save it on your computer.**\n\n[Download the Fonix decryptor](http://download.bitdefender.com/am/malware_removal/BDFONIXDecryptor.exe)\n\n**Step 2: Double-click the file (previously saved as BDFonixDecryptor.exe) and allow it to run.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Step 3: Select “I Agree” in the License Agreement screen**\n\n**Note: The tool requires that affected users must have at least 1 cpriv.key file present on their**\nPCs, either in the target folder to decrypt, or anywhere else on disk(s).\n\n**Step 4: Select “Scan Entire System” if you want to search for all encrypted files, or just add**\nthe path to the location you previously saved the encrypted files in.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe strongly recommend that you also select “Backup files” before starting the decryption\nprocess should issues occur while decrypting. Then press “Start Tool”.\n\nAt the end of this step, your files should have been decrypted.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please contact us at forensics@bitdefender.com.\n\nIf you have checked the backup option, you will see both the encrypted and decrypted files.\nYou can also find a log of the decryption process in the temp%\\BDRemovalTool folder.\n\nTo remove the encrypted files left behind, you should search for files matching the extension\nand mass-remove them. We do not encourage you to do this until you made sure that your\nfiles can be opened safely and there is no damage to the decrypted files.\n\n**Acknowledgement:**\n\nThis product may include software developed by the OpenSSL Project, for use in the\n[OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)](http://www.openssl.org/)\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/) [free tools](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/free-tools/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Bogdan BOTEZATU\n\nInformation security professional.
