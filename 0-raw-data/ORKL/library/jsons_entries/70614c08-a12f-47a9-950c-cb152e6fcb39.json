Read More...](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/author/karlo-zanki)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLarge malware campaigns with the potential to cause severe damage and operational problems on a\nnationwide scale often attract the attention of government institutions like the FBI, DHS and similar\norganizations. To help prevent further malicious activity and reduce the malware’s damage potential, these\ninstitutions produce technical reports that describe the malware in detail.\n\nWhile those threat reports can have varying levels of detail and technical complexity, they almost always\nhave a list of IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) with information about file samples and infrastructure used in\nmalicious campaigns. Those IOCs are then used by defenders to detect malicious activity in their networks.\nEven though using the IOC lists is a good way to strengthen the company network security, it is hard to tell\nhow comprehensive they are and how many sample and infrastructure variants they cover.\n\nIf a malicious campaign is highly targeted, the malware samples will most likely be adapted and configured\nto use different infrastructure for different targets. In those cases, there is a big chance that the company\nnetwork will get infected by a malware sample that isn’t detectable based on the IOC list provided in the\nrelated report. Even if such modifications slightly change the program logic, there are a few ways to detect\nsimilar malware samples based on metadata extracted during static analysis.\n\n[This blog will demonstrate how our Titanium Platform can be used for that purpose on a real-world scenario](https://www.reversinglabs.com/products/malware-analysis-platform)\nof the Hidden Cobra APT group. You will learn how to find similar malware samples targeting your\norganization that aren’t covered by released IOC lists.\n**Hidden Cobra**\n\nHidden Cobra (often referred to as Lazarus) is an APT group linked to North Korea. Most researchers\nestimate it has been active for the last 10 years. During that time, this group has conducted several\nmalicious campaigns and used different toolsets in most of them. Their malicious activity was continuously\ninvestigated by the US government institutions. As a result of those investigations, several malware analysis\nreports were released, containing IOC lists that can be used to detect malicious activity. On May 12th, 2020,\n[three new reports were released describing the COPPERHEDGE,](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-133a) [TAINTEDSCRIBE and](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-133b) [PEBBLEDASH](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-133c)\nthreats. We selected them for demonstration purposes, since they describe ongoing campaigns.\n\n**Copperhedge**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first malware tool we will analyze is Copperhedge. As described in the threat report, this tool is a fullfeatured RAT that comes in six variants. Each variant is accompanied by a list of IOCs, which we will use as\na starting point. We will try to find more samples that are not mentioned in the report, extract their\nconfigurations, and add them to the IOC list. Technical descriptions of all variants are provided in the report,\nso there’s no need to go into more detail here.\n\nThere are three things to look for during sample analysis:\n\nImport decryption and loading at execution startup\nCommands supported by the RAT\nC2 domains\n\n**Variant A**\n\nThe two samples mentioned in the report will be used as the starting point for our threat search. Samples\nfrom this variant load RC4-encrypted imports at the beginning of the execution. Supported commands start\nat the 0x123459 index. The three domains stored in plaintext are used for C2 communication.\n\n[Titanium Platform can group processed files based on the RHA1 file similarity algorithm. During file](https://www.reversinglabs.com/technology/reversinglabs-hash-algorithm)\nprocessing, Titanium Platform also performs metadata extraction. Extracted metadata fields can be used to\nfind related samples that aren’t similar enough to be put into the same RHA1 group, but still have something\nin common.\n\nProcessing these two samples with Titanium Platform and looking at their RHA1 buckets reveals 3 new\nsamples that weren’t mentioned in the report.\n\n**Similar files grouped by RHA1 algorithm**\n\nThe metadata extracted from these new samples uncovers that they use different C2 domains also not\nmentioned in the initial report.\n\n**Example of a C2 domain list contained in one of the found samples**\n\nBesides RHA1 pivoting, different metadata fields can be used for discovering similar files. For PE files, you\ncan use the following fields:\n\nImphash\n\n\n-----\n\nCompile timestamp\nSection hashes\nResource hashes\n...\n\nThese techniques are used on previously discovered samples to hopefully find more potential threats.\nPivoting on the .rsrc section hash of the 17e5e9fcd31ba8df50ef5474c27121615d704b8f sample gives two\nmore files and uncovers more C2 domains.\n\n**Search based on section hash**\n\nWhenever a new sample is found, the whole search process is repeated. Think of it as a ball of tangled\nropes where you need to pull the leads until you completely untangle it.\n\n[If you don’t have any samples to start with, you can use YARA retro hunt as a starting point. Threat](https://www.reversinglabs.com/products/malware-threat-hunting-and-investigations)\nwarnings often provide some YARA rules as a way to detect samples. Sometimes, those rules will be very\nspecific, and will provide precise hunting results. Other times they will be too generic, and will get triggered\non unrelated samples. The biggest problem with YARA rules provided for Hidden Cobra tools is that a lot of\nthose tools reuse the same codebase, and it is often hard to clearly distinguish between different variants\nused in the past.\n\nIn our example, running a YARA retro hunt with the provided rules results in new samples, and disassembler\nanalysis relates them to Hidden Cobra activities. Some of them were already seen in previous threat reports\nabout a variant named BANKSHOT.\n\nThe next step is to analyze the results and filter the ones similar enough to be marked as variant A. Filtered\nresults are then used as a starting point for the pivoting process already demonstrated on the initial\nsamples. For example, the provided YARA rule matched the 588a298b51921f4ee8f6fb7ec837f80039328afe\nsample. Searching the imphash extracted from that sample gives 2 new samples, and analyzing them\nreveals more previously unknown C2 domains. The process is then repeated again until there are no more\nleads to follow.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Search based on imphash**\n\nIn case you don’t have any input samples and the provided YARA rules didn't match any results, another\ngood option is to try the Titanium Platform’s search feature. Use the threatname keyword to find your initial\nsample set. The great thing is you don't need to know the exact name, as wildcard characters can be used\nfor partial threat name matching. The threat report refers to this Hidden Cobra tool as Copperhedge, but it\nalso mentions another name - Manuscrypt. Based on this information, we can search for all samples with\nthreat names ending in manuscrypt.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Search based on manuscrypt threat name**\n\nUsing wildcard characters enables matching both 32-bit and 64-bit samples in an easy way. Logical clauses\ncan be used to make the search more targeted, and to eliminate potential false positives. In this case, the\nsearch is refined to PE/DLL and PE/EXE files in order to eliminate a bunch of archive files from which they\nwere extracted. The construction of logical clauses is a powerful feature that enables fine maneuvering\nbetween different search results, and allows you to find relevant samples faster.\n\nAnalyzing the search results gives a few more samples that use domains not found in the reports. One\ninteresting sample is 14b681e0c9ce9a02f2fb093927f043bbb608afc6. It uses the same\n_0x78292E4C5DA3B5D067F081B736E5D593 RC4 key for import decryption and has the same hardcoded_\nstring *dJU!*JE&!M@UNQ@. Interestingly, these domains were already used in a previous Hidden Cobra\n[operation named Ghost Puppet described in another malware threat report. Samples from this variant also](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/1901)\n[look very similar to the ones described in the threat report related to the operation Star Cruiser. This](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/1653)\nstrengthens our previous conclusion that Hidden Cobra tools reuse code and infrastructure. Just like before,\nanalyzing other samples in the same RHA1 bucket gives us more domains and a new threat name to use as\na starting point for a new round of searching.\n\n**Finding new threat names**\n\nSearches based on the manuscrypt threat name also returned a few files that use different RC4 keys for\nimport decryption.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne such example is the 03138278b603bc120b2cba001a8adb0b2d7d82ea sample. It has the same\ncommand-dispatching routine, and the commands start at the previously mentioned 0x123459 index.\n\n**Top level view of command dispatching routine**\n\nIt also has typical import-loading code in its WinMain function, but the RC4 key used in this case is\n_0x38D90F98DD0A903CB156499FE3691588._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Import loading routine**\n\nThis information can be used to create YARA rules that will serve as a starting point for a new round of\nsearching. Pivoting around different metadata fields accompanied by YARA retro hunting and threat name\nsearching can result in a high number of discovered samples in just a few iterations of the described search\nprocess. Search results for variant A are summarized in the appended file at the end of the IOC list section.\nNotice how just the two initial samples and a single YARA rule helped in finding all those new IOCs.\n\n**Variant B**\n\nThe threat report for this variant provides 11 samples and no YARA rules. Analyzing the samples with\nTitanium Platform reveals some new ones. For example, searching by imphash from sample\n_29ddf9baad018518060814a03d424f4e08a0e914 returns 4 more files._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Search based on imphash**\n\nPivoting on the .reloc section’s SHA1 hash gives another result. When using section hashes for pivoting, it is\nadvisable to avoid all-zero sections, or sections with generic content (for example, a .rsrc section of a file\nthat has only generic resources like a manifest or some common dialogs). Generic sections are found in\nmany samples, and they generate unwanted results during the search process.\n\n**Search based on section hash**\n\nThe search process is the same as for the variant A. Find new samples, pivot on their metadata, and repeat\non any new results. This time we can use the compilation timestamp from the sample\n_8c6d92becc487dc0043e446f99f165b06af36d72 found in the first iteration to reveal more samples._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Search based on timestamp**\n\nWhen using timestamps as the search criteria, keep in mind that they can also be generic and lead you the\nwrong way. The best example of this is 0x2A425E19 (1992.06.19 22:22:17), a timestamp that appears in a\nwide range of Delphi executables.\n\n**Variant C**\n\nThis variant is an excellent example of why you should always try pivoting using as many metadata fields as\npossible. The best pivoting results are usually achieved by looking into files grouped by RHA1, and by\nimphash value. However, in this case, processing all four input samples produced only one new result.\nLuckily, there are many metadata fields that can be used for pivoting. All input files are DLLs, and looking at\ntheir exported functions reveals interesting library names.\n\n**Exported functions and original file names**\n\nTaking a closer look, we see there are two samples exporting the DllProc function, and it seems that the\nsame malware is compiled in both 32-bit and 64-bit variants. Other samples have similar library names, but\nhave different exported functions, and come only in 64-bit variants. If there’s a 32-bit variant of a file\nexporting the DllProc function, why doesn’t it exist for other samples? The easiest way to confirm this\nassumption is by performing a search for the library name used as the original file name.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Search based on original file name**\n\nA short analysis summary of the newly discovered samples is displayed in the following table. Comparing\ncompilation timestamps with the time when the samples were first seen in ReversingLabs TitaniumCloud\ncan reveal how malicious actors operated. It is interesting to notice that sometimes only a few hours passed\nfrom the moment the sample was compiled to the moment when it was used. Samples in each pair use the\nsame domains for C2 communication, and every pair comes with a new set of domains.\n\n\n**SHA1** **Compile**\n**timestamp**\n\n\n**First seen**\n**timestamp**\n\n\n**Original**\n**file name**\n\n\n**Exported**\n**Func**\n\n\n-----\n\nf744f5f97ace1a4862e764971449c28c4b880e8f 2019-0618T12:03:21\n\n7202fea74865e085104f839574cd150613fbcf99 2019-0618T12:03:26\n\ne211559f3dfc6db100958b8c12e20f064111f26a 2019-0712T00:48:01\n\n49379896fa096f523e55f8daf1db00cf262852da 2019-0712T00:48:08\n\n84f3437bbccb514d639c0a6134298261aefb457e 2019-0715T13:19:53\n\nef0c0ef95b1542184a6a1f4d1f4ece583046ba0a 2019-0715T13:20:00\n\n0faf5540bcb8782dd70bcb31f3aa9baf7e65a043 2019-0719T00:32:01\n\n5692a8fb1e5c1f0802c8e552dd043087e2914aa7 2019-0719T00:31:55\n\nb5e134bc58f8eda4efd99a45628eb433c4bcbc19 2019-0723T06:17:14\n\nfe0f8a37887c8f8fb5eb3e8252a8df395b3e66e7 2019-0723T06:17:02\n\n3a25b9bd8c0995c5a2e2a3a31fe4691a18d44e72 2019-0821T00:49:49\n\nb233b56cd9a11a273df389b98431f1deb8ab7e12 2019-1022T02:21:16\n\n**Variant C search summary**\n\n**Variant D, E**\n\n\n6/20/2019\n14:26\n\n6/20/2019\n12:01\n\n7/12/2019\n19:52\n\n7/12/2019\n20:00\n\n7/22/2019\n16:46\n\n7/22/2019\n16:46\n\n3/13/2020\n20:34\n\n7/19/2019\n3:47\n\n7/23/2019\n14:08\n\n7/23/2019\n14:08\n\n3/25/2020\n17:00\n\n10/24/2019\n8:53\n\n\nmovie32.dll DllProc\n\nmovie64.dll DllProc\n\nmovie32.dll DllEntryPointer\n\nmovie64.dll DllEntryPointer\n\nmovie32.dll TransData\n\nmovie64.dll TransData\n\nmovie32.dll drukom\n\nmovie64.dll drukom\n\nmovie32.dll drukom\n\nmovie64.dll drukom\n\nfona64.dll cnamnhs\n\nfona64.dll cmnashwkweu\n\n\nThe search process was repeated for these variants too, but no new samples were discovered that could be\npositively related to them.\n\n**Variant F**\n\nAnalyzing variant F samples showed they all have the original file name WEB_Troj.dll. Searching for this\nparameter exposed another sample.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Search based on original file name**\n\nThe Description section of the threat report mentions “multi-part HTTP POST messages” used for the\ncommunication with the C2 server. Those messages contain specific fields and User-Agent strings that can\nbe used to define a YARA rule for finding more samples.\n\n**rule Copperhedge_F {**\n\n**strings:**\n\n**$user_agent1 = \"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\"**\n\n**$user_agent2 = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)**\n**Chrome\"**\n\n**$form_data1 = \"_webident_f\"**\n\n**$form_data2 = \"_webident_s\"**\n\n**condition:**\n\n**($user_agent1 or $user_agent2) and $form_data1 and $form_data2**\n\n**}**\n\n**YARA rule for Copperhedge F variant**\n\nTitanium Platform’s Retro Hunt results show that Hidden Cobra tools aren’t targeting only Windows systems,\nbut also Linux and macOS platforms.\n\n**Retro Hunt results**\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking at the list of samples grouped by the RHA1 similarity algorithm uncovers a few samples that didn t\nmatch the provided YARA rule. Disassembler analysis of these files confirms they are also variant F\nsamples, but they use different User-Agent strings and modified POST message fields\n(_media_1/_media_2 instead of _webident_f/_webident_s). None of the samples from this RHA1 bucket\nhave been seen in ReversingLabs TitaniumCloud before early June 2020, and most of them have a very low\npercentage of AV detections.\n\n**Similar files grouped by RHA1 algorithm**\n\n**Taintedscribe**\n\nThe second malware tool we are going to analyze is Taintedscribe. It is described as a full-featured\n_beaconing implant that downloads additional command execution modules after establishing a successful_\nlanding point. The report provides hashes of one beaconing implant and two command execution modules\nthat will be used to discover more samples. The report also provides one YARA rule, but it is a very loose\nrule that would generate many false-positives, so we won't use it for the search.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Example of a loose YARA rule**\n\nTitanium Platform shows that the downloader module has two similar files, according to the RHA1 similarity\nalgorithm. These samples use two new IP addresses - 221.161.45.202 and 61.106.174.191. Sample\n_976553cafd72f8e1908f81f297fbc7dbc04c90cd is identical to the_\n_9ff4836ff1670816995297234cb5f6e326c16d26, but it has some additional data in the overlay._\n\n**Search based on original file name**\n\nUnfortunately, pivoting on previously described metadata fields didn’t return any new samples for neither the\ndownloader module nor the command execution module. This looks like a dead end, but is it really? The\nthreat report mentions a list of domains extracted from the downloader that are used for TLS\ncommunication.\n\n**List of the domains used for TLS communication**\n\nThis same list can be found in the samples grouped by the RHA1 algorithm. There are a few somewhat\nuncommon URIs in the list, like world.linkedin.com or vk.com. Search results based on uncommon URIs\nuncover even more samples and their C2 IP addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Search based on the extracted URI**\n\nA detailed examination shows that these new 64-bit DLL samples are command execution modules. They\nexecute the same commands described in the report, and the segment of program code responsible for\ncommand dispatching is almost identical to the one in the input samples. The sample\n_78925505b266e973ad7b5ec5b28c0f77cd65a628 is a PE/EXE file very similar to the main module. The_\nmain difference is that the C2 IPs in this sample are encrypted using a simple encryption. It also uses the\nsame “FakeTLS” scheme and the same byte sequences (0x11223344 and 0x11223345) described in the\nreport.\n\nRepeating the RHA1 pivoting technique on the samples found using URI search gives a few more related\nsamples. This completes the Taintedscribe tool analysis.\n\n**Pebbledash**\n\nPebbledash is the third malware tool we are going to analyze. It is also described as a full-featured\n_beaconing implant, but doesn’t use additional command execution modules like Taintedscribe. Only one_\nsample hash is provided in the supplied threat report. As always, the first thing to check is RHA1 file\nsimilarity grouping. It gave us three more samples.\n\n**Similar files grouped by RHA1 algorithm**\n\nUnfortunately, the usual pivoting fields didn't return any new results. However, looking at the resources\nembedded in the 2c879a1d4b6334c59ac5f11c2038d273d334befe sample, one item stands out: a bitmap\nresource with the language field set to Korean.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Bitmap resource from the 2c879a1d4b6334c59ac5f11c2038d273d334befe sample**\n\nResources can sometimes be excellent targets for pivoting purposes. Samples can come with unusual\nbitmaps and icons that don’t even have a logical visual representation, but are instead used as a data\ncontainer. Malware samples occasionally contain specific binary resources required for some of their\nfunctionalities to work properly. For example, this could be some kind of a decryption key, or a certificate\nused for authenticating on a C2 server.\n\nThe Titanium Platform Advanced Search feature supports searching based on resource hashes. Search\nresults for the bitmap resource hash contain the three already mentioned samples, but also an additional\none not found in the previous search queries.\n\n**Search based on resource hash**\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther pivoting on found samples didn t result in anything new. YARA retro hunt with the YARA rule\nprovided in the report did not return any new samples either, apart from the ones already found.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPublicly released threat reports are a great source of information that organizations can use to improve their\nthreat detection, primarily through IOC lists. Those lists often provide only a small number of samples that\nthe researchers had at their disposal, and should be enriched by more detailed threat hunting research.\n\nIn this case we were able to find 90 additional file samples, 38 domains, and 9 IP addresses. The research\nalso uncovered samples that target Mac and Linux platforms, which wasn’t mentioned in the original\nreports.\n\nThe appearance of the discovered samples in ReversingLabs TitaniumCloud, compared to the samples\nmentioned in the related threat reports, ranges from a month earlier to even four years earlier in some\ncases.\n\nMost of the found samples were first seen in ReversingLabs TitaniumCloud in the period between 2018 2020, but there are also some samples that date all the way back to June 2016. Finding related samples\ncan be used to discover security incidents that happened a long time ago but were not detected at that\nmoment. A few of the found samples date back to 2014 and it is very likely that they were used in some of\nthe previous operations like Bankshot, but they were mentioned in the blog to explain how Titanium Platform\ncan assist you at discovering potentially undetected relations between different campaigns observed in the\npast.\n\nThis blog post demonstrated how Titanium Platform can help you take advantage of one such threat report\non the actively used Hidden Cobra tools. Titanium Platform makes it easy to discover additional threat\nsamples, even without reverse engineering expertise. Repeating simple search queries based on just a few\nmetadata fields can provide valuable results. The researcher doesn’t even need to understand the details of\nthe underlying file format - it is enough to know which metadata fields can be useful.\n\n**IOC list**\n\nThe following links contain the data extracted from the newly discovered samples related to the analyzed\ntools. They are grouped as described in the original threat report. Keep in mind that all the samples are\nrelated to the HiddenCobra activities, and that some of them are quite difficult to distinguish from one\nanother. Information related to files from the referenced reports was not duplicated.\n\nCopperhedge - A:\n[https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Copperhedge_A_IOC.txt](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Copperhedge_A_IOC.txt)\n\nCopperhedge - B:\n[https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Copperhedge_B_IOC.txt](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Copperhedge_B_IOC.txt)\n\nCooperhedge - C:\n[https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Copperhedge_C_IOC.txt](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Copperhedge_C_IOC.txt)\n\nCooperhedge - F:\n[https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Copperhedge_F_IOC.txt](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Copperhedge_F_IOC.txt)\n\nPebbledash:\n[https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Pebbledash_IOC.txt](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Pebbledash_IOC.txt)\n\n\n-----\n\nTaintedscribe:\n[https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Taintedscribe_IOC.txt](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Taintedscribe_IOC.txt)\n\n[Download our Titanium Platform Solution Brief](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3375217/Solution%20Brief/2020-mofu-titanium-platform-solution-brief.pdf)\n[Download our A1000 Advanced Hunting Options Datasheet](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3375217/ReversingLabs%20Data%20Sheets/2019-Jan-RL-A1000-Advanced-Hunting-Options-Investigation-Datasheet-EN.pdf)\n\n## MORE BLOG ARTICLES\n\n\n-----",
