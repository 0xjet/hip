It is\n[the latest iteration of malware we reported on back in August 2020.](https://www.cadosecurity.com/post/team-tnt-the-first-crypto-mining-worm-to-steal-aws-credentials)\n\n[Earlier in 2021 we saw reports by AT&T and](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/malware-using-new-ezuri-memory-loader) [Trend Micro on a related campaign from](https://web.archive.org/web/20210109061251/https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/a/malicious-shell-script-steals-aws-docker-credentials.html)\n[attackers called TeamTNT. More recently, we’ve seen independent researchers (1,](https://twitter.com/Suprn8/status/1349938276623384576) [2) and](https://twitter.com/r3dbU7z/status/1350195371952267264)\n[TenCent review more activity. Whilst we classify this as a botnet due to the centralised](https://security.tencent.com/index.php/blog/msg/175)\n[command and control, we note that TeamTNT themselves prefer the term “spreading script”.](https://twitter.com/HildeTNT/status/1350698045458018304)\nBelow we’ve provided a quick outline of the significant updates that TeamTNT made to their\ncrypto-mining campaign last week.\n\nThe first obvious update is the logo deployed – “TeamTNT feat Borg – The Docker Gatling\nGun”:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs before, the core of the botnet scans and compromises open Kubernetes systems. But\nthere have been a number of updates. The AWS credential theft is significantly more\nsophisticated than the one we found back in August 2020, and shows improvements from\n[the later version reported on by Trend Micro. The botnet can now steal details from AWS IAM](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-crypto-mining-botnet-is-now-stealing-docker-and-aws-credentials/)\nroles, and from both credential files and the AWS metadata URL:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe scripts posts the stolen credentials to one of two URLs:\n\nhttp://the.borg[.]wtf/incoming/access_data/aws.php\nhttp://45.9.150[.]36/incoming/access_data/aws.php\n\nMuch of the exploitation chain and toolset remains the same as previous versions. There are\na number of scanners, IRC backdoors and reverse shells to maintain access.\n\nThere are some new cloud and container specific tricks though. TeamTNT now deploy –\n\n\n-----\n\n[Tmate – A simple application for sharing terminals. This provides another method of](https://tmate.io/)\nmaintaining access for the attackers. It is installed from http://45.9.150[.]36/pwn/t.sh\n[Break Out The Box – Break Out The Box (BOTB) is a penetration testing tool for cloud](https://github.com/brompwnie/botb)\nand containerised environments, continuing an impressive arsenal of capabilities:\n\nThe parameters that BOTB is called with show the attackers now also try to steal credentials\nfrom Google Cloud Platform systems:\n\n_-scrape-gcp=true -recon=true -metadata=true -find-http=true -find-sockets=true -find-_\n_docker=true -pwnKeyctl=true -k8secrets=true_\n\nBOTM is installed from https://teamtnt[.]red/set/up/bob.php\n\n[Peirates – A penetration testing tool for Kubernetes. Installed from](https://www.inguardians.com/peirates/)\nhttps://teamtnt[.]red/set/up/pei.php\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTeamTNT have significantly improved both the quality and scope of their attacks since our\nfirst report back in August 2020. They’ve displayed a high pace of improvement, and an\narray of cloud and container specific attacks.\n\nCado Security continues to see a rise in attackers developing tools and techniques\nspecifically targeting cloud and container environments. It is important organisations remain\nvigilant and continue to adapt to these new threats.\n\nCado Security specialises in providing tooling and techniques that allow organisations to\nthreat hunt and investigate cloud and container systems.
