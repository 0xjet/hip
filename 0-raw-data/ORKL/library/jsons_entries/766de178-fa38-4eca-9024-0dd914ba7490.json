    "plain_text": "# Examining a Possible Member of the Winnti Group\n\n**[blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pigs-malware-examining-possible-member-winnti-group/](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pigs-malware-examining-possible-member-winnti-group/)**\n\nApril 19, 2017\n\n_Updated on April 26, 2017, 01:39 PM (UTC-7) to add the accurate IP address._\n\nIn [one of our previous blog entries, we covered how the threat actor known as Winnti was](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/winnti-abuses-github/)\nusing GitHub to spread malware – a development that shows how the group is starting to\nevolve and use new attack methods beyond their previous tactics involving targeted attacks\nagainst gaming, pharmaceutical, and telecommunications companies. Through this entry, in\nwhich we take a closer look at an individual who we believe might be connected to the Winnti\ngroup, we hope to give both ordinary users and organizations better insights into some of the\ntools – notably the server infrastructures- these kinds of threat actors use, as well as the\nscale in which they operate.\n\n**Searching Domain Registrations for Clues**\n\nThreat actors typically register and use several domains in order to discretely lead their\nmalware to their Command and Control (C&C) servers. Registering a domain name always\nrequires some form of identifying information: a physical or mailing address, an email\naddress, and a phone number. Of these, a valid email address holds the greatest importance\nbecause it is where the registrar sends the confirmation of a domain purchase to the new\nowner in addition to the information needed to control the domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost fraudsters create one-time email addresses or use stolen email addresses, both of\nwhich are easy to create or obtain. However, over time, it becomes tedious for fraudsters to\nconstantly change information when registering new domains. This is the point where they\nare likely to make mistakes and start reusing e-mail addresses.\n\nA careful analysis of the domain registrations from this threat actor between 2014 and 2015\nallowed us to identify one profile used to register several domains that were used as C&C\nservers for a particular malware family employed by the Winnti group. In particular, we\nmanaged to gather details on an individual using the handle Hack520, who we believe is\nconnected to Winnti.\n\n**Who is the Winnti group?**\n\nThe group behind the Winnti malware (which we will call the Winnti group for brevity) sprung\nup as a band of traditional cyber crooks, comprising black hats whose technical skills were\nemployed to perpetrate financial fraud. Based on the use of domain names they registered,\n[the group started out in the business of fake/rogue anti-virus products in 2007. In 2009, the](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt_fakeav-growing-problem.pdf)\nWinnti group shifted to targeting gaming companies in South Korea using a self-named dataand file-stealing malware.\n\nThe group, which was primarily motivated by profit, is noted for utilizing self-developed\n[technically-proficient tools for their attacks. They once attacked a game server to](https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/more-then-30-mmorpg-companies-targeted-in-ongoing-malware-attack/) illicitly farm\nin-game currency (“gaming gold”, which also has real-world value) and stole source codes of\nonline game projects. The group also engaged in the theft of digital certificates which they\nthen used to sign their malware to make them stealthier. The Winnti group diversified its\n[targets to include enterprises such as those in pharmaceutics and telecommunications. The](http://news.softpedia.com/news/winnti-malware-gets-into-pharmaceutical-business-485013.shtml)\ngroup has since earned infamy for being involved in malicious activities associated with\n[targeted attacks, such as deploying spear-phishing campaigns and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/targeted-attacks) [building a backdoor.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/backdoor-built-with-aheadlib-used-in-targeted-attacks/)\n\nDuring the course of researching the Winnti group, we came across previously unreported\nmalware samples that we attributed to the group based on the malware arsenal and the use\nof registered domains as attack infrastructure. These samples led us to the discovery of\nadditional C&C servers that provided us with more information than we initially expected.\n\n**A closer look at Hack520**\n\nOur initial investigation on the domains registered by Hack520 revealed that similar domains\n(listed below) were registered by another profile.\n\nhack520[.]co[.]kr\nshaiya[.]kr\nzhu[.]kr\nshenqi[.]kr\nzhuxian[.]kr\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral of these domains are linked to variants of malware that were used by the Winnti\nthreat actor. Surprisingly enough, it does not take very long to get some information about\nHack520: someone with this handle runs a blog and a Twitter account (with a handle close to\nHack520) that is also directly linked to the blog.\n\n[Figure1_winnti](http://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2017/04/Figure1_winnti.jpg)\n\n_Figure 1: Twitter account of Hack520_\n\nOne interesting detail about Hack520 is his apparent love for pigs, as seen in his use of the\nword in his email addresses. He also mentions his occupation as a “pig farmer” in online\nmessage boards. In addition, Hack520’s tweets always show photos of the same animal,\nwhich is likely his pet pig.\n\nThe Twitter handle used by Hack520 indicates also an “est” portion. This “est” reference\ncould refer to a hacking group with its own message board on which hack520 also posts\nregularly.\n\nIn one particular forum post, Hack520 mentions that he was previously jailed for a period of\n10 months in a blog post dated May 31, 2009.\n\n[Figure2_winnti](http://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2017/04/Figure2_winnti.jpg)\n\n_Figure 2: Post from Hack520’s blog_\n\nA rough translation of this message is as follows:\n\n“Fxxk, when I am released, the server is offline, I can’t find the machine, the domain is\nexpired, it is so bad. I wasted 10 months, I have failed and lost my money.”\n\nHack520 seems to be very interested in hosting services and his profile fits that of a system\nadministrator profile with some programming and hacking skills.\n\nAfter further research, we were able to link Hack520 to different network administration\nactivities, notably with a Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting service. The way Hack520\nsigns his messages in one hacker forum provides a clue pointing to this connection. While\none of his signatures uses his own blog domain, there is also a second signature which uses\n_93[.]gd, a domain that was found to have been actively selling VPS services in the past. The_\nemail address admin@93[.]gd is linked to IP addresses owned by a certain user with the\nnickname “PIG GOD”—another reference to Hack520’s passion for pigs.\n\nAmong the IP addresses owned by Hack520 is a whole/22 IP Range which we dubbed as\nthe “PIG RANGE”. The IP range for “PIG GOD” is 43[.]255[.]188.0/22, which appears to be\nhosted in Hong Kong as seen in the information we found:\n\ninetnum: 43[.]255[.]188[.]0 - 43[.]255[.]191[.]255\n\n\n-----\n\nnetname: PIG-HK\ndescription: PIG GOD\ncountry: HK\nadmin-c: PG406-AP\ntech-c: PG406-AP\nperson: pig god\ncountry: HK\nphone: +852-39437000\ne-mail: admin@66[.]to\nnic-hdl: PG406-AP\nmnt-by: MAINT-RAIBOW-HK\nchanged: admin@66[.]to 20160917\nsource: APNIC\n\nThe domain 66[.]to leads to another website that shows Hack520’s pet pig. It also reveals\ndirect links to secure[.]66[.]to and zhu[.]vn, both of which also belong to Hack520 and\ncontains his personal blog.\n\n[Figure3_winnti](http://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2017/04/Figure3_winnti.jpg)\n\n_Figure 3: Hack520’s pet pig_\n\nWe were able to find additional links between Hack520’s “Pig network” and the Winnti\ngroup’s activities. This includes hosting C&C domains that were used by Winnti such as\nmtrue.com, shenqi[.]kr and zhu[.]kr. We also found a live service selling VPS hosting at\n_secure[.]66[.]to. The hosting services offered at secure[.]66[.]to are in fact hosting services_\nrented to other companies worldwide. The contents found in secure[.]66[.]to often lead to\n_zhu[.]vn, which is Hack520’s domain for hosting his own private blog._\n\n[Figure4_winnti](http://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2017/04/Figure4_winnti.jpg)\n\n_Figure 4: Screenshot of secure[.]66[.]to_\n\nWe found roughly 500 domain names that lead or have led to the “Pig network” between\n2015 to March 2017. Most of these domains seem to have contained illegitimate content like\npornography and online gambling. We highly suspect the “Pig network” to have also been\nused as a bulletproof hosting service for cybercriminals who are unrelated to the Winnti\ngroup. From what we’ve seen in Hack520’s blog, as well as the infrastructure deployed\naround it, it is quite safe to say that Hack520 is involved in aspects of the VPS service\nactivity provided to groups like Winnti and other cybercriminals or threat actors.\n\n**What we’ve learned**\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat actors like the Winnti group rarely ever stay static in terms of both tools and tactics.\n[As we’ve already previously discussed in our 2017 predictions, these groups will constantly](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/predictions/2017)\nevolve and employ unique and advanced attack techniques. In addition, individuals like\nHack520 prove that these threat actors are composed of varied individuals who have their\nown set of expertise. All of these things point to threat actors and groups like Winnti will\ncontinue to try different methods of attack.\n\nThreat actors are always looking to expand the strategies they use, thus security practices\nand solutions that work for less organized cybercriminals might not work for determined\ngroups who are willing to spend time, resources and manpower to accomplish their goals. As\nsuch, there is a need for everyone to be proactive when it comes to security, especially for\norganizations who are frequently the victims of targeted attacks. By creating awareness and\nusing the right solutions, both individuals and organizations can take the steps needed to\ndefend against the malicious tactics used by threat actors like the Winnti group.\n\nAPT & Targeted Attacks\n\nWe take a closer look at an individual who we believe might be connected to the Winnti\ngroup and provide better insights into some of the tools — notably the server infrastructures\n— as well as the scale in which they operate.\n\nBy: Trend Micro April 19, 2017 Read time: ( words)\n\nContent added to Folio\n\n\n-----",
