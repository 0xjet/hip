Crimson RAT was used as attack vector in this instance, same\nTTPs were observed by an APT group since 2016.\n\nThe email lures the officials by asking them to download the MS Excel sheet named “amended\ntraining schedule of IFS officers”. The download link provided in the email is shown as\n“hxxps://www.mea.gov.in/ifs-traning.schedule”, but it actually points to the malicious XLS\ndocument from URL: hxxp://info-sharing.net/?a=1533541533.\n\nThe document contains malicious macro code which drops first payload, the dropped payload is\nCrimson RAT downloader. This payload further downloads fully functional Crimson RAT from the\nfollowing IP: 151.106.19[.]207:8246\n\nA document with similar TTP was also identified in early august with the name “MoFA-MoD\nAFghanistan.xls” uploaded on 3rd August 2018. The XLS file contains malicious macro code,\nwhich upon execution downloads Payload from URL:”hxxp://afgcloud7.com/upld/updt.dll”\n\nIn 2016, Proofpoint published a report on “Operation Transparent Tribe”. The report had details of\nvarious attacks against Indian Embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan using Crimson RAT.\nAnd, in one of the campaigns, they found a XLS file fetching payload from same URL as we found\nin second campaign URL: “hxxp://afgcloud7.com/upld/updt.dll”. These details might indicate that\nthe APT group behind Operation Transparent Tribe is active and targeting Indian officials, again.\n\nSpear Phishing Email\n\n\n-----\n\nSpear Phishing Email\nThe lure of the campaign states the President’s schedule for the various meetings.\n\nFirst payload download fully functional Crimson RAT and drop it to following path:\n“C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Hurmz\\\\bahgrtmrs.exe”.\n\nThe payload has the capability to kill any process running in the system by using following code:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following code is used to parse the commands which payload receives from the C&C:\n\nFollowing is the list of some of the commands that the payload (Crimson RAT) supports:\n\n1. proc1 – List all the running processes.\n2. getavs – List of antiviruses running on the system.\n3. filz – Send file info to C&C\n4. dowf – Download file from C&C\n5. cownr – Update the binary.\n6. dirs – Send disk drives list.\n7. afile – Send file to C&C\n\nApart from above commands, the RAT has more functionalities like keylogging, browser\ncredential theft and webcam access.\n\nConclusion\nBased on the above campaigns, its TTPs, payload used and past reporting, there is high\nprobability that the APT group behind “Operation Transparent Tribe” might be active and is\ntargeting Indian organizations, again.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n58d52690179c2467fce76cec126ec5bb\n915f32d66955de954bd89e3110d6a03e\n0f0f6f48c3ee5f8e7cd3697c40002bc7\n6b4635023eb1372df9b7618a5dae6128\n\n\n-----\n\n151.106.19.207:8246\n151.106.19.207:3286\n151.106.19.207:12621\nhxxp://info-sharing.net/?a=1533541533\n\n\n-----",
