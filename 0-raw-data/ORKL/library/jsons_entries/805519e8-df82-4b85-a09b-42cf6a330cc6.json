The group’s targets are primarily\nlocated in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\nZscaler s analysts had identified a screenshot from an attacker machine (see Figure 1\n_below), which they believed had been inadvertently uploaded whilst the actors were testing_\nmalware. Within the screenshot an IP address, seemingly used to access the attacker\nmachine, was identified – 185.244.39[.]105.\n\n**Figure 1: Screenshot of the Attacker Machine (Source –** **[Zscaler)](https://www.zscaler.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/sites/default/files/images/blogs/Molerats%20-%20Dec%202021/Attacker%20Machine%20-%20Snapshot.png)**\n\nIn this blog we will explore activity surrounding 185.244.39[.]105 in further detail, using Team\nCymru’s [Pure Signal™ Recon platform.](https://team-cymru.com/products/pure-signal-recon-threat-hunting-and-threat-reconnaissance/)\n\n**Network Telemetry**\n\n185.244.39[.]105\n\nWhen examining network telemetry data for 185.244.39[.]105 over the past few months,\ninbound connections to TCP/61003 were identified, with directionality inferred based on the\nephemeral ports used by the peer IP addresses.\n\nIn total, connections were observed from ten distinct IP addresses (see Table 1 below)\nassigned to SPEED-CLICK-LIMITED, PS, with traffic most recently observed on 06 January\n2022. Geolocation data placed a number of these IP addresses in the Gaza Strip.\n\n**IP Address** **First Seen** **Last Seen**\n\n45.130.98[.]193 2021/10/21 05:18:54 2021/10/26 06:59:20\n\n45.130.98[.]194 2021/10/26 07:05:48 2021/11/02 11:49:02\n\n176.106.47[.]69 2021/11/20 06:26:55 2021/11/21 08:25:42\n\n176.106.44[.]164 2021/11/21 08:28:46 2021/11/21 09:04:04\n\n176.106.44[.]57 2021/11/21 09:12:18 2021/11/25 11:35:11\n\n45.158.159[.]37 2021/12/05 07:53:38 2021/12/19 12:14:26\n\n176.106.47[.]3 2021/12/20 07:29:07 2021/12/21 12:27:43\n\n176.106.47[.]141 2021/12/22 06:34:14 2021/12/27 12:47:27\n\n176.106.44[.]129 2021/12/28 06:20:59 2021/12/30 11:52:51\n\n\n-----\n\n176.106.45[.]99 2022/01/02 07:09:28 2022/01/06 11:40:23\n\n**Table 1: IPs Connecting to 185.244.39[.]105:61003**\n\nAs can be seen in Table 1, the relationship between the listed IPs and 185.244.39[.]105 is\nsequential, with no cross-over in use observed in the first and last seen timestamps.\n\n**This activity is indicative of one user/machine being utilized to access**\n**185.244.39[.]105 over an extended time period, with the client IP address refreshing**\n**due to DCHP lease renewal; SPEED-CLICK-LIMITED is a home broadband provider**\n**(wireless and ADSL).**\n\nGiven this pattern of IPs assigned to the same provider (SPEED-CLICK-LIMITED, PS) being\nutilized to connect to an IP associated with the Molerats APT group, we decided to examine\nnetwork telemetry data, during the time periods specified, for each of the IPs listed in Table\n1.\n\n23.237.73[.]126\n\nIn each case, outbound sessions to remote UDP/46370 on 23.237.73[.]126 were observed\n(see Figure 2 below for an example of this activity). This IP address is assigned to\nFDCSERVERS, US – an American hosting/VPS provider.\n\n**Figure 2: An Illustration of Activity on 23.237.73.126:46370**\n\nNetwork telemetry data for 23.237.73[.]126 identified connections to remote TCP/443 on an\nIP address assigned to a provider in Saudi Arabia. This activity occurred between 21 – 22\nDecember 2021. Passive DNS data for this IP address identified it as a mail server for the\n\n\n-----\n\nSecretariat General of a regional government organization in the Middle East.\n\nWhen reviewing inbound network telemetry data for 23.237.73[.]126:46370, a further three\nIP addresses were observed in UDP sessions:\n\n**85.114.96[.]246**\n**85.114.102[.]90**\n**85.114.112[.]152**\n\nAll three IP addresses were assigned to FUSION-SERVICES, PS, with geolocation data\nagain placing them in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAs previously, a pivot was undertaken on these IP addresses in order to identify further\nMolerats APT infrastructure.\n\n45.128.73[.]179\n\nTwo of the IP addresses assigned to FUSION-SERVICES, PS were observed in outbound\nsessions to remote UDP/47489 on 45.128.73[.]179. This IP address is assigned to\nDEDIPATH, US – an American hosting/VPS provider.\n\nIn addition, five of the IP addresses contained in Table 1, as well as a further IP address\n(45.130.98[.]149) assigned to SPEED-CLICK-LIMITED, were observed in UDP sessions to\n**45.128.73[.]179:47489.**\n\nFurthermore, inbound connections to TCP/61637 on 45.128.73[.]179 were observed from\nthree of the IP addresses accessing 45.128.73[.]179:47489.\n\nNetwork telemetry data for 45.128.73[.]179 identified connections to remote TCP/443 on an\nIP address assigned to an Israeli provider. This activity occurred on 15 January 2022.\nPassive DNS data for this IP address identified it as a web server for an Israeli government\ndepartment.\n\nSummary\n\nFigure 3 (below) provides a summary of all the network telemetry data discussed so far in\nthis blog, showing the links between the higher order infrastructure and ‘attacker’ hosts.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: Molerats APT Infrastructure**\n\n**Commonalities**\n\nOpen ports information for the three IP addresses identified at the bottom of Figure 6 as\nattacker infrastructure, showed that each host was running an Apache web server on\nTCP/80; version 2.4.18 (Ubuntu). Open source information indicated that in each case, this\nApache version was first observed around June / July 2021. A variety of CVEs are reported\nfor Apache version 2.4.18, dating back to 2016. It is possible that Molerats APT actors\ncompromised these hosts for use in attack activity, although an alternative theory might be\nthat the actors are using an outdated version of Apache in the setup of their C2 servers.\n\n**Given the apparent vulnerability of these servers, it should be noted that other**\n**malicious actors may have gained access during the period of activity examined in**\n**this blog.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom the starting point of an IP address (185.244.39[.]105) associated with the management\nof an ‘attacker machine’, it was possible to pivot and identify higher order infrastructure\nutilizing IP addresses assigned to a Palestine provider. From this point a further pivot led us\nto the identification of an additional ‘attacker’ host (23.237.73[.]126), based on observed\nconnections to the mail server of a Middle Eastern government organization during\nDecember 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough it was possible to confirm successful connections were made to the mail server\n(based on observed TCP flags), it is unclear whether the Molerats APT actors were able to\ngain access to specific mailboxes (although this was the hypothesized intent).\n\nTravelling back upstream from this new ‘attacker’ host, it was possible to identify further\nhigher order infrastructure, which led to another ‘attacker’ host (45.128.73[.]179) being\nidentified. In this case based on connections to an Israeli government web server during\nJanuary 2022.\n\nBased on these observations, it is apparent that the infrastructure first identified by Zscaler\nand expanded upon in this blog, is being utilized in current and ongoing operations\nattributable to the Molerats APT group.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n23.237.73[.]126\n\n45.128.73[.]179\n\n\n-----",
