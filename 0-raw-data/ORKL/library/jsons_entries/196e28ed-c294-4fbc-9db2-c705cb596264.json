minister\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-take-over-diplomats-email-target-russian-deputy-minister/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-take-over-diplomats-email-target-russian-deputy-minister/)**\n\nIonut Ilascu\n\nBy\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nJanuary 12, 2022\n03:35 AM\n0\n\nHackers believed to work for the North Korean government have compromised the email\naccount of a staff member of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID) and deployed spearphishing attacks against the country’s diplomats in other regions.\n\nOne of the targets was Sergey Alexeyevich Ryabko, the deputy foreign minister for the\nRussian Federation, among other things responsible for bilateral relations with North and\nSouth America.\n\nThe phishing campaign started since at least October 19, 2021, deploying Konni malware, a\nremote administration tool (RAT) associated with the cyber activity from North Korean\nhackers known as APT37 (or StarCruft, Group123, Operation Erebus, and Operation\nDaybreak).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Russian diplomatic targets\n\n[Cybersecurity firm Cluster25 last week published research about a phishing campaign](https://cluster25.io/2022/01/03/konni-targets-the-russian-diplomatic-sector/)\ntowards the end of December 2021 that delivered Konni RAT to individuals in the Russian\ndiplomatic apparatus.\n\nThe researchers found that the hackers used the New Year theme as a decoy in emails to\nstaff at the Russian embassy in Indonesia.\n\nsource: Cluster25\nIt was a congratulatory message that appeared to be from fellow diplomats at the Russian\nembassy in Serbia sending a ZIP archive with a holiday screensaver.\n\nWhen extracted, the file was an executable that ultimately delivered the Konni RAT\ndisguised as Windows service “scrnsvc.dll.”\n\n\n-----\n\nsource: Cluster25\nResearchers at Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs were also tracking these spear-phishing\ncampaigns that had started at least two months earlier, the likely goal being to harvest\ncredentials of an active MID account.\n\nTo achieve their objective, the attackers relied on spoofed hostnames for email services\ncommon in Russia, Mail.ru and Yandex.\n\nAnother campaign started around November 7, delivering URLs for downloading an archive\nwith documents asking for information on the vaccination status.\n\nThe archive also included an executable posing as legitimate software used for checking\nthe Covid-19 vaccination status, which executed a malware loader that infected the system\nwith Konni.\n\nAccording to Black Lotus Labs researchers, the campaign in December also spotted by\nCluster25 was the third one from the same threat actor and used the compromised MID\naccount “mskhlystova@mid[.]ru” to send out malicious emails.\n\nThe recipients of the malicious messages were the Russian embassy in Indonesia and\nRussian politician Sergey Alexeyevich Ryabkov, currently serving as Deputy Foreign\nMinister.\n\n\n-----\n\nsource: Lumen's Black Lotus Labs\nLooking at the email headers revealed that the source of the messages was the same IP\naddress, 152.89.247[.]26, used for the phishing campaign in October, Black Lotus Labs\nfound.\n\nTechnical analysis of the infection chain from Lumen’s researchers confirmed Cluster25’s\nfindings, including the evasion technique of hiding a payload in a “401 unauthorized” server\nerror response.\n\nsource: Cluster25\nBlack Lotus Labs researchers say that this was a highly targeted campaign that\n“downloaded a first-stage agent which is nearly identical to the agent” discovered by\nMalwarebytes in a Konni attack against Russian targets.\n\nBoth cybersecurity outfits are confident in attributing the spear-phishing campaigns against\nthe Russian diplomatic entities to the Konni advanced persistent threat.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n\n-----\n\n[North Korean hackers attack EU targets with Konni RAT
