We have previously published information about the connections of each cluster](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Park.pdf)\nof this group. In this blog, we’ll focus on an active cluster that we dubbed DeathNote\nbecause the malware responsible for downloading additional payloads is named Dn.dll or\nDn64.dll. This threat is also known as Operation DreamJob or NukeSped. Over the past few\nyears, we have closely monitored the DeathNote cluster, observing a shift in their targets as\nwell as the development and refinement of their tools, techniques, and procedures.\n\n**_Timeline of DeathNote cluster_**\n\nIn this blog, we will provide an overview of the significant modifications that have taken place\nwithin this cluster, both in terms of its technical and strategic aspects.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Beginning of tracking DeathNote\n\nThe notorious threat actor Lazarus has persistently targeted cryptocurrency-related\nbusinesses for a long time. While monitoring the actor’s activities, we noticed that in one\nparticular case they were using a significantly modified piece of malware. In mid-October\n2019, we came across a suspicious document uploaded to VirusTotal. Upon further\ninvestigation, we discovered that the actor behind this weaponized document had been using\nsimilar malicious Word documents since October 2018. The malware author used decoy\ndocuments that were related to the cryptocurrency business such as a questionnaire about\nbuying specific cryptocurrency, an introduction to a specific cryptocurrency, and an\nintroduction to a bitcoin mining company.\n\n**_Decoy documents_**\n\nOnce the victim opens the document and enables the macro, the malicious Visual Basic\nScript extracts the embedded downloader malware and loads it with specific parameters. In\nthis initial discovery, the actor used two types of second-stage payload. The first is a\nmanipulated piece of software that contains a malicious backdoor, while the second is a\ntypical backdoor with a multi-stage binary infection process.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Infection procedure_**\n\nThe Trojanized application utilized in the second stage is masquerading as a genuine\nUltraVNC viewer. If executed without any command line parameters, it will display a\nlegitimate UltraVNC viewer window. However, it carries out a malicious routine when it is\nspawned with “-s {F9BK1K0A-KQ9B-2PVH-5YKV-IY2JLT37QQCJ}” parameters. The other\ninfection method executes the installer, which creates and registers an injector and backdoor\nin a Windows service. Finally, the backdoor is injected into a legitimate process (svchost.exe)\nand initiates a command-and-control (C2) operation. In this infection, the final payload\ninjected into the legitimate process was Manuscrypt. Until this discovery, the Lazarus group\nhad primarily targeted the cryptocurrency business. Our investigation has identified potential\ncompromises of individuals or companies involved in cryptocurrency in Cyprus, the United\nStates, Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n\n## Shifting focus to the defense industry\n\nWhile tracking this campaign, we uncovered a significant shift in the attack’s target along with\nupdated infection vectors in April 2020. Our research showed that the DeathNote cluster was\nused to target the automotive and academic sectors in Eastern Europe, both of which are\nconnected to the defense industry. At this point, the actor switched all the decoy documents\nto job descriptions related to defense contractors and diplomatic services.\n\n**_Decoy documents_**\n\nIn addition, the actor refined its infection chain, using the remote template injection technique\nin their weaponized documents, as well as utilizing Trojanized open-source PDF viewer\nsoftware. Both of these infection methods result in the same malware (DeathNote\ndownloader), which is responsible for uploading the victim’s information and retrieving the\nnext-stage payload at the C2’s discretion. Finally, a [COPPERHEDGE variant is executed in](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-133a)\nmemory.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Infection chain_**\n\nNotably, a Trojanized PDF reader, based on the [open source software, used an interesting](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf)\ntechnique to initiate its malicious routine. It first retrieves the MD5 hash of the opened PDF\nfile and performs an XOR operation on 65 bytes of embedded data using the retrieved MD5\nvalue. Next, it verifies that the first WORD value of the XORed data is 0x4682, and checks\nthat the MD5 hash value matches the last 16 bytes of the XORed data. If both conditions are\nmet, the remaining 47-bytes value is used as the decryption key for the next stage of\ninfection.\n\n**_Verification process of Trojanized PDF reader_**\n\nFinally, this Trojanized PDF viewer overwrites the original opened file with a decoy PDF file\nand opens it to deceive the victim while implementing the malware payload. The payload is\nexecuted with command line parameters, and a shortcut file is created in the Startup folder to\nensure persistence. This infection mechanism demonstrates the care and precision with\nwhich the actor delivers the payload.\n\n## Expanded target and adoption of new infection vector\n\n\n-----\n\nIn May 2021, we observed that an IT company in Europe that provides solutions for\nmonitoring network devices and servers was compromised by the same cluster. It’s believed\nthat the Lazarus group had an interest in this company’s widely used software or its supply\nchain.\n\nIn addition, in early June 2021, the Lazarus group began utilizing a new infection mechanism\nagainst targets in South Korea. One thing that caught our attention was that the initial stage\nof the malware was executed by legitimate security software that is widely used in South\nKorea. It’s thought that the malware was spread through a vulnerability in this widely used\nsoftware in South Korea.\n\n**_Infection chain_**\n\nSimilar to the previous case, the initial infection vector created the downloader malware.\nOnce connected to the C2 server, the downloader retrieved an additional payload based on\n[the operator’s commands and executed it in memory. During this time, the BLINDINGCAN](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-232a)\nmalware was used as a memory-resident backdoor. While the BLINDINGCAN malware has\nsufficient capabilities to control the victim, the actor manually implanted additional malware.\nIt’s believed that the group aims to create an auxiliary method to control the victim. The\nretrieved loader’s export function (CMS_ContentInfo) was launched with command line\nparameters, which is crucial for decrypting the embedded next-stage payload and\nconfiguration. This process only proceeds if the length of the parameter is 38. Finally, the\nCOPPERHEDGE malware, previously used by this cluster, was executed on the victim.\n\nAlmost one year later, in March 2022, we discovered that the same security program had\nbeen exploited to propagate similar downloader malware to several victims in South Korea.\nHowever, a different payload was delivered in this case. The C2 operator manually implanted\na backdoor twice, and although we were unable to acquire the initially implanted backdoor,\nwe assume it is the same as the backdoor in the following stage. The newly implanted\nbackdoor is capable of executing a retrieved payload with named-pipe communication. In\naddition, the actor utilized side-loading to execute Mimikatz and used stealer malware to\ncollect keystroke and clipboard data from users.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Infection chain_**\n\nAround the same time, we uncovered evidence that one defense contractor in Latin America\nwas compromised by the same backdoor. The initial infection vector was similar to what\nwe’ve seen with other defense industry targets, involving the use of a Trojanized PDF reader\nwith a crafted PDF file. However, in this particular case, the actor adopted a side-loading\ntechnique to execute the final payload. When the malicious PDF file is opened with the\nTrojanized PDF reader, the victim is presented with the same malware mentioned above,\nwhich is responsible for collecting and reporting the victim’s information, retrieving\ncommands and executing them using pipe communication mechanisms. The actor used this\nmalware to implant additional payloads, including legitimate files for side-loading purposes.\n\nLegitimate file: %APPDATA%\\USOShared\\CameraSettingsUIHost.exe\nMalicious file: %APPDATA%\\USOShared\\dui70.dll\nConfig file: %APPDATA%\\USOShared\\4800-84dc-063a6a41c5c\nCommand line: %APPDATA%\\USOShared\\CameraSettingsUIHost.exe\nuTYNkfKxHiZrx3KJ\n\n## An ongoing attack targeting a defense contractor with updated infection tactics\n\nIn July 2022, we observed that the Lazarus group had successfully breached a defense\ncontractor in Africa. The initial infection was a suspicious PDF application, which had been\nsent via the Skype messenger. After executing the PDF reader, it created both a legitimate\nfile (CameraSettingsUIHost.exe) and malicious file (DUI70.dll) in the same directory. This\nattack heavily relied on the same DLL side-loading technique that we observed in the\nprevious case. The payload that was initially implanted and executed by the PDF reader was\n\n\n-----\n\nresponsible for collecting and reporting the victim s information, as well as retrieving an\nadditional payload from the remote server named LPEClient. The Lazarus group used this\nmalware several times in various campaigns. They have also utilized the same DLL sideloading technique to implant additional malware that is capable of backdoor operation. In\norder to move laterally across systems, the actor used an interesting technique called\n[ServiceMove. This technique leverages the Windows Perception Simulation Service to load](https://github.com/netero1010/ServiceMove-BOF)\narbitrary DLL files. According to the author’s explanation, ‘a non-existing DLL file will be\nloaded every time when the Windows Perception Simulation Service is started’. By creating\nan arbitrary DLL in C:\\Windows\\System32\\PerceptionSimulation\\ and starting the service\nremotely, the actors were able to achieve code execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM on a\nremote system. The actor created a devobj.dll file in the PerceptionSimulation folder and\nremotely executed the PerceptionSimulation service. Upon launching the devobj.dll file, it\ndecrypted an encrypted backdoor file, PercepXml.dat, from the same folder and executed it\nin memory.\n\n**_Infection chain_**\n\n## Post-exploitation\n\nDuring our investigation of this campaign, we have gained extensive insight into the Lazarus\ngroup’s post-exploitation strategy. After initial infection, the operator executed numerous\nWindows commands to gather basic system information and attempt to find valuable hosts,\nsuch as an Active Directory server. Before moving laterally, the Lazarus group acquired\nWindows credentials using well-known methods, and employed public techniques, such as\n\n\n-----\n\nServiceMove. When the group completed its mission and began exfiltrating data, they mostly\nutilized the WinRAR utility to compress files and transmit them via C2 communication\nchannels.\n\n**Phase** **Examples**\n\n\nBasic\nreconnaissance\n\nFinding highvalue hosts\n\nAcquiring login\ncredentials\n\nLateral\nmovement\n\n\nGenerally used Windows commands. For example:\n\ncmd.exe /c netstat -ano | find TCP\nsysteminfo\n\nIn one case, they accessed the default domain controllers policy directly.\n\ncmd.exe /c “Type “\\\\[redacted]\\SYSVOL\\[redacted]\\Policies\\\n{6AC1786C-016F-11D2-945F00C04fB984F9}\\MACHINE\\Microsoft\\Windows\nNT\\SecEdit\\GptTmpl.inf”\n\nTo find a connected Remote Desktop host it utilized Windows\ncommands or queried the saved server list from the registry.\n\ncmd.exe /c netstat -ano | findstr 3389\ncmd.exe /c reg query HKEY_USERS\\S-1-5\n_[redacted]-1001\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers_\n\nUtilizing ADFind tool to acquire Active directory information.\n\ncmd.exe /c “%appdata%\\[redacted].xic -b dc=[redacted],dc=\n\n[redacted] -f “sAMAccountName=[redacted]” >>\n%temp%\\dm3349.tmp 2>&1″\n\n[Utilizing crafted Mimikatz to dump login credentials or Responder tool to](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0174/)\ncapture credentials.\n\nOne common approach for launching commands on remote hosts is to\nuse methods like SMB connection or the ServiceMove technique.\n\n\nExfiltration Using WinRAR to archive files before sending the stolen file via C2\nchannel.\n\nadobearm.exe a -hp1q2w3e4 -m5 -v2000000k “%Local\nAppData%\\Adobe\\SYSVOL800.CHK” “\\\\[redacted]FILE02.\n\n[redacted]\\Projects\\[redacted] Concept Demonstrator”\n%appdata%\\USOShared\\USOShared.LOG1 a hpb61de03de6e0451e834db6f185522bff -m5\n“%appdata%\\USOShared\\USOShared.LOG2”\n“%appdata%\\ntuser.001.dat”\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter tracking the DeathNote cluster and its origin, we have determined that the Lazarus\ngroup is responsible for this malware strain. Our conclusion is supported by many security\nvendors who also believe that the Lazarus group is linked to this malware. Furthermore, we\nhave analyzed the delivery of Windows commands to the victim through the DeathNote\nmalware, and discovered that a significant number of commands were executed between\nGMT 00:00 and 07:00. Based on our knowledge of normal working hours, we can infer that\nthe actor is located in either the GMT+08 or GMT+09 time zone.\n\n**_Timeline of Windows commands_**\n\nMoreover, the actor left a Korean comment ‘정상호출’, which translates to ‘normal call’ in the\nC2 script. This further supports the hypothesis that Lazarus is a Korean-speaking actor.\n\n**_Korean comment in the C2 script_**\n\nIn conclusion, the Lazarus group is a notorious and highly skilled threat actor. Our analysis of\nthe DeathNote cluster reveals a rapid evolution in its tactics, techniques and procedures over\nthe years. As the Lazarus group continues to refine its approaches, it is crucial for\norganizations to maintain vigilance and take proactive measures to defend against its\nmalicious activities. By staying informed and implementing strong security measures,\norganizations can reduce the risk of falling victim to this dangerous adversary.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n###
