TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n\n### Global Research and Analysis Team\n\n Version 1.02 (August 9, 2016)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Pipe backdoor / RPC Helper\n\nSamples:\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Format** **Bits** **Linker** **Compilation timestamp**\n\n46a676ab7f179e511e30dd2dc41bd388 9728 EXE 32 11.0 2014.01.22 13:42:08\n\n9f81f59bc58452127884ce513865ed20 12800 EXE 64 11.0 2014.12.18 13:01:56\n\ne710f28d59aa529d6792ca6ff0ca1b34 9728 EXE 32 11.0 2014.12.18 13:01:45\n\nThis module is a tiny application that runs as a Windows service. It starts the service control dispatcher with\nthe name ‘RPCHlpr’ and only continues to run in case when the process token contains a “S-1-5-6” (Service)\nsid.\n\nThe module spawns one thread, creates a named pipe “\\\\.\\pipe\\rpchlp_0”, and waits for connections to that\npipe. Once a connection occurs, it creates another thread to carry out communication. Then it receives a 8byte rc4 key and body of a command to run. Next it creates three pipes, “\\\\.\\pipe\\rpchlp_1”,\n“\\\\.\\pipe\\rpchlp_2” and “\\\\.\\pipe\\rpchlp_3” for standard file handles (stdin, stdout, stderr) and waits for all\nthese pipes to connect.\n\nDepending on the command received, it may either execute the shellcode or start a process with the given\ncommand line and redirects RC4-encrypted input/output from all the handles from/to the sender.\n\n## Standard blob\n\nThe shellcode blob is expected to start with a magic value “0xC102AA02” (DWORD). The blob format is the\nfollowing:\n\n00 DWORD magic “0xC102AA02”\n04 BYTE version 2\n05 BYTE version minor – any\n06 DWORD offset of entrypoint\n0A DWORD blob size\n\nExecutable blobs of the described format are used in many components of the malicious platform and are\nreferred in the description as “standard blobs”.\n\n## Passive sniffer backdoor\n\nFormat: PE DLL 32/64 bit\nFile sizes: 75 – 91 Kb\n\n[For any inquiries contact intelreports@kaspersky com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com) Page 2 of 33\n\n|MD5|Size|Format|Bits|Linker|Compilation timestamp|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|46a676ab7f179e511e30dd2dc41bd388|9728|EXE|32|11.0|2014.01.22 13:42:08|\n|9f81f59bc58452127884ce513865ed20|12800|EXE|64|11.0|2014.12.18 13:01:56|\n|e710f28d59aa529d6792ca6ff0ca1b34|9728|EXE|32|11.0|2014.12.18 13:01:45|\n\n\n-----\n\nCompilation timestamps, linker versions: multiple variant, but match those of the target OS files (usually\n“svchost.exe”).\n\nThe module is known to be installed as either an LSA password manager library, or as a Security Provider.\n\nThe business logics is provided by one of the exported functions and is triggered when the corresponding\nsystem layer loads the library. When invoked, the module decrypts the first layer from the blob that contains\nactual code. The blob happens to have the same format as the RPC Helper payload. Once the magic value\nand code boundaries are verified, the code invokes the shellcode from the blob.\n\nThe shellcode removes subsequent layers of encryption and decompresses its payload using the **Jcalg1**\nalgorithm. The payload contains another layer of shellcode that loads, relocates and invokes the PE binary\ninside. The configuration consists of 1-3 DLL files, the first one being the main module and 1-2 others are\noptional plugins.\n\nThe main module starts by enumerating all available plugins and starting them by calling the function\nexported by the name “ainit”. Every plugin provides a pointer to its own function table to the calling core.\n\nThe configuration provided by the “upper” layer of the shellcode also contains the names of the event and\nmutex objects that are created by the core – these are usually unique for each sample.\n\nThen, it locates its configuration data in the resource called “CONFIG” of type “RT_CONFIG”. The resource is\nencrypted using AES-CBC with a hardcoded key\n“EFEB0A9C6ABA4CF5958F41DB6A31929776C643DEDC65CC9B67AB8B0066FF2492”.\n\nThe key is not encrypted and can be located in the memory of the target processes while the module is\nrunning.\n\nThe configuration is in readable text format. It is separated into sections that refer to different plugins by\nheaders starting with ':'. Every option contains a prefix that specifies its format – S (string), B (boolean),\n'I', 'D', 'N' (integer), 'E' (list)\n\n:Core\n\n[S]Public\n**Key=\"ul35zkT/MGP3poQe+enL0dZef5rkaQtaZ78rn2qCsJjB45TCsSG26Qhz9lTtucKGpAqxmB5ByUOMsENKQL1twZm8zuxxfOIViGnj**\na0Yr49v8SlS9vCD/wibjo/0ri4c9JH80h5z3EWfXKIAmdgKRuCQXgiORBz4TFx1C+MRt0bzOYsM+kzuRsvUhmKPkL6iVAwpic1LGMH5S\nkMeWmtHbWYpOL+3U70YeHgFCKjWuhy9Nmt36EWZLKzZitjvYFq8EJ3QfpoMB+oWa9OhOlde2+9zOeTYPwGUq9t/oQwlXXTnfA7\nHkSVcvuoo+E//gzPJ/wT6Xq82IlsqB/IznIeaZaQ==\"\n\n[S]Process List=\"svchost.exe:*netsvc*,spoolsv.exe:*\"\n\n[B]Monitor Child Thread=false\n\n[B]Disable Master Execute=false\n:Raw\n\n[S]IP=\"0.0.0.0\"\n\n[B]Any Dest=false\n:Icmp\n\n[S]IP=\"0.0.0.0\"\n\nThen the module reads base64-encoded “Public Key” value from the config and sets it as RSA key. After that\nthe module creates a socket and starts a new thread to monitor routing and IP changes. Finally, it starts every\nplugin, providing pointer to own function table.\n\n[For any inquiries contact intelreports@kaspersky com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com) Page 3 of 33\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce a network packet is received by a plugin, it pushes the packet to the core and tries to decrypt the packet\nheader with RC5 using the public key. If the first dword matches _0x11111111, it decrypts the rest of the_\npacket, verifies the CRC32 and appends it to the queue.\n\nThe packet is expected to be a command, either providing the core plugin with the address of the C&C server\n**to connect to, the local port number to listen to, or the path to the additional local module to load and start.**\nDepending on the command received in a packet, the module can:\n\nExecute an arbitrary binary from disk\n\nLoad and start an encrypted plugin from disk\n\nSpawn a network connection object\n\nThe plugin on disk is encrypted with RC6 with a 64-bit key that is provided by the C&C server. The decrypted\nand decompressed blob is expected either to be a valid PE file or a standard blob.\n\n## Plugin: “Raw”\n\nMD5: many, irrelevant\nSize: 25 Kb\nFormat: PE32/64 DLL\n\nThe packet handler processes IP packets of protocols: ICMP, IGMP, UDP, TCP.\n\nThe plugin extracts the contents from the incoming packets according to the corresponding protocol\nspecification. For ICMP packets, it only passes those of type 8 (echo request). No additional checks are\nperformed and since the payload is encrypted with an arbitrary key using RC5 it can be only filtered out by\nhigh entropy values in the payload.\n\n## Plugin: “Icmp”\n\nMD5: many, irrelevant\nSize: 11 Kb\nFormat: PE32/64 DLL\n\nThe plugin processes incoming ICMP packets using a raw socket object. The module verifies that the packet\ntype is either 0 (echo reply) or 8 (echo request). If the ICMP type matches, it skips the ICMP header and\npasses the rest of the packet to the core.\n\n## Plugin: “Pcap”\n\nMD5: many, irrelevant\nSize: 24 Kb\nFormat: PE32/64 DLL\n\n[For any inquiries contact intelreports@kaspersky com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com) Page 4 of 33\n\n\n-----\n\nThe plugin tries to open the _\\Device\\NdisRaw device. If failed, it enumerates all loaded drivers_ **using**\n**undocumented parameter 11 of NtQuerySystemInformation and checks if “nps.sys” (network packet filter)**\nis loaded. After this, it resolves the API of “packet.dll”. Another mode of operation is to start the “NPF” service\nand work via NdisRaw device. In that case it provides wrappers to emulate the API of “packet.dll”.\n\nThe plugin expects to receive IPv4 packets of no more than 1514 bytes. The only difference from “Raw” in\nfurther processing is that it supports only ICMP echo request, UDP and TCP packets.\n\nThere are monolithic versions of the passive backdoor that contain all the “plugins” inside the main binary\n(e.g. c3f8f39009c583e2ea0abe2710316d2a). These versions contain more plugins, descriptions follow.\n\n## Plugins: “PcapUdp”, “PcapTcp”\n\nThe “PcapUdp” plugin captures all incoming raw packets and looks only for UDP ones that contain data after\nthe UDP header. All such packets are accepted, decrypted and validated for the magic value. It uses the same\nAPI as the “pcap” plugin.\n\nThe “PcapTcp” is similar, it waits for incoming TCP packets and inspects data that follows the TCP header.\nThe packet is expected to be of size between 0x76 and 0x1A5 bytes and should not be a broadcast packet.\n\n## Plugin: “Dns”\n\nThis plugin acts according to a predefined schedule. The “Poll Times” parameter specifies the specific time\n**when the plugin should try connect to its C&C server. Format: “day_of_month/hour:minute,...”. There can**\nbe up to 31 such entries. If current time matches one from the “Poll Times” list or “Poll on Start” was set to\n“true”.\n\nFirst it resolves the hostname specified by the “Start Marker” value. Then it only continues if the name was\nresolved and the returned IP address is equal to the one specified in the “Start Marker” second part. It forms\nthe full DNS name to resolve by replacing the “%d” mark in the “Address Format” with “1” and then “2” etc\nuntil the total packet size is less than 0x11B bytes. The sum of received data is expected to be eq or more\nthan 0x40 bytes.\n\n## Plugin: “Pipe”\n\nThe plugin looks for the option “Pipe Name” in the Core configuration, which is used as “\\\\.\\pipe\\%value%”\nfor creating a pipe object. Then it waits for incoming connections to the named pipe, reads packets of size\n287 bytes and processes them as any other packet obtained by plugins.\n\n[For any inquiries contact intelreports@kaspersky com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com) Page 5 of 33\n\n\n-----\n\n## Plugin: “Http”\n\nThis plugin acts according to a predefined schedule. The “Poll Times” parameter specifies the specific time\nwhen the plugin should try to connect to its C&C server, up to 31 such entries.\n\nIt uses the default system User-Agent string or a default fallback value: “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0;\nWin32)”. It also sends the following HTTP additional headers:\n\nAccept:\ntext/html,text/plain,*/*\nAccept-Language: en-us\nAccept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,*\nKeep-Alive: 300\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: No-Cache\n\nIf proxy parameters are set, it uses them for sending the request. Sends a HTTP GET request to a given URL\nusing Wininet API. The payload is extracted from the response using the “Start Mark” and “End Mark” strings,\nand then Base64-decoded.\n\n## Generic pipe backdoors\n\nA set of executables that are usually delivered over the local network using legitimate remote administration\ntools from other compromised computers.\n\nSamples:\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Format** **Bits** **Linker** **Compilation**\n\n**timestamp**\n\n181c84e45abf1b03af0322f571848c2d 5632 EXE 32 11.0 2014.06.19 14:52:07\n\n2e460fd574e4e4cce518f9bc8fc25547 5120 EXE 32 12.0 2010.09.08 12:53:30\n\n1f6ba85c62d30a69208fe9fb69d601fa 5632 EXE 32 11.0 2014.02.17 13:57:32\n\nEach sample is tailored for a particular network and is usually irrelevant for other victims. They are regular\nWindows executables. When started without parameters, the module copies itself to the %TEMP% directory\nand schedules the execution of its copy with parameter “-q” by creating a new scheduler task.\n\nWhen run with one parameter, the module proceeds with its actions. It sets up a hardcoded 64-byte RC4 key,\nconnects to a remote peer using a hardcoded IP address (local or external) and hardcoded port (different for\neach sample). Then it sends encrypted packet of 0x10 bytes starting with magic numbers, and expects to\nreceive a payload in specific format, starting with magic numbers as well.\n\nIf the payload is successfully received from the server, it is called by the provided entry point offset. The\nshellcode is provided with pointers to API functions “GetProcAddress” and “LoadLibraryA” and the handle of\nthe currently connected socket.\n\n[For any inquiries contact intelreports@kaspersky com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com) Page 6 of 33\n\n|MD5|Size|Format|Bits|Linker|Compilation timestamp|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|181c84e45abf1b03af0322f571848c2d|5632|EXE|32|11.0|2014.06.19 14:52:07|\n|2e460fd574e4e4cce518f9bc8fc25547|5120|EXE|32|12.0|2010.09.08 12:53:30|\n|1f6ba85c62d30a69208fe9fb69d601fa|5632|EXE|32|11.0|2014.02.17 13:57:32|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe variation 2e460fd574e4e4cce518f9bc8fc25547 has a hardcoded IP and port numbers but can use other\nvalues provided from the command line, and it does not copy itself or schedule a job, it just runs in place,\nand uses port 13000 as the default value.\n\n## Null session pipes backdoor\n\nSamples:\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Format Bits** **Linker** **Compilation**\n\n**timestamp**\n\nF3B9C454B799E2FE6F09B6170C81FF5C 34304 DLL 64 9.0 2013.01.04 05:33:21\n\n0C12E834187203FBB87D0286DE903DAB 26624 EXE 32 11.0 2015.02.24 09:46:02\n\n72B03ABB87F25E4D5A5C0E31877A3077 26624 EXE 32 11.0 2015.02.24 09:46:02\n\n76DB7E3AF9BE2DFAA491EC1142599075 27648 EXE 32 11.0 2015.08.25 10:20:40\n\n5D41719EB355FDF06277140DA14AF03E 34816 DLL 64 9.0 2015.10.01 18:04:26\n\nA277F018C2BB7C0051E15A00E214BBF2 34816 DLL 64 12.0 2015.12.14 15:06:11\n\nThe DLL may be a Security Provider, Print Provider, or an EXE file.\n\nThe package is wrapped in a PE module that activates the standard blob.

The DLL versions provide the similar interface mimicking an LSA password filter, or as a\nSecurity Provider.\n\nIt decrypts the standard blob that consists of two parts: the orchestrator binary and the configuration blob.\nThe configuration blob is a virtual filesystem that contains all binary plugins required for executing a\nparticular task. It may include other standard blobs containing other execution scripts. The last item of the\nVFS is always a precompiled Lua script that instructs the core what to do.\n\nThe VFS is encrypted with RC4 or Salsa20 (depending on the version of the platform) and compressed\nwith Zlib.\n\nThe orchestrator executes the Lua script using embedded runtime and provides basic functions to the script.\nThe original Lua interpreter was modified: the version embedded in the platform uses unicode (utf-16)\nencoding for storing string values and variable names.\n\nThe execution flow is controlled by the script. External plugins are DLL libraries, they are referenced by name.\nThe provided interface emulates console applications: they have emulated stdin/stdout/stderr, the input\ndata is provided as command-line parameters and input streams. Output can be chained by a standard shell\noperator “|” to be fed into another program. Overall flow looks like a shell script. The “exec” and “exec2str”\ncommands support basic redirection operators (“>”, “>>”, “<”, “|”).\n\nModules provided by the Lua runtime:\n\ntable\nio\nos\nstring\npath\nw\n\nAll the modules except “w” are standard for Lua. The module “w” is custom, it implements the following\nspecific commands:\n\nargs Get the arguments\n\ncd Change current directory\n\ncreate_log Initialize a new encrypted log object (on disk or in memory)\n\ndebugf Call OutputDebugStringW()\n\ndrop_token Close handle to some object\n\nexec Execute a plugin, results are stored in the log\n\nexec2str Execute a plugin, return the result as string\n\nexit Stop execution\n\nfrontend Return the value of an internal variable\n\nget_id Return the value of an internal variable\n\n[For any inquiries contact intelreports@kaspersky com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com) Page 10 of 33\n\n|args|Get the arguments|\n|---|---|\n|cd|Change current directory|\n|create_log|Initialize a new encrypted log object (on disk or in memory)|\n|debugf|Call OutputDebugStringW()|\n|drop_token|Close handle to some object|\n|exec|Execute a plugin, results are stored in the log|\n|exec2str|Execute a plugin, return the result as string|\n|exit|Stop execution|\n|frontend|Return the value of an internal variable|\n|get_id|Return the value of an internal variable|\n\n\n-----\n\n|get_mem_log|Get the contents of the current in-memory log storage|\n|---|---|\n|get_log_info|Get the status of the current log storage|\n|get_proc_bits|Return hardcoded value (32, 64)|\n|get_windows_bits|Return whether OS is 32-bit or 64-bit|\n|load_state|Load execution state from a file or from the registry|\n|messagebox|Show a standard message box|\n|printf|Write to the emulated stdout stream|\n|pwd|Return the current working directory|\n|randgen|Return a buffer full of random data|\n|randstr|Return a random alphanumeric string|\n|randrange|Return a random value that is bound by a given range|\n|save_state|Save execution state in a file or from the registry|\n|shutdown_detected|Return 1 if the OS is shutting down|\n|set|Set internal parameter's value by name|\n|sleep|Delay|\n|start_log|Attach to the encrypted log storage|\n|stop_log|Detach from the current encrypted log storage|\n\n\n## Plugins\n\nThe rest of the functionality is provided by the plugins.

Each file's name is matched against a list of prefixes and if the prefix is\nknown then the file is written to the local storage.\n\nThe destination directory is selected based on the filename prefix:\n\n####  p_* → 06/*\n\n  z_* → 05/*\n\n  b_* → 01/*\n\nThere is a known configuration of the core platform that specifically looks for files in the directories populated\nby the “mytrampoline” module and pushes these files to a remote repository, providing a communication\n**channel for airgapped computers.**\n\n## Document stealing package “BUS Manager”\n\nThis optional package may be installed along with one of the Core modules, designed for collecting\ndocuments from any plugged USB sticks.\n\nUsually it has its own bootstrapper library for activation on the target system but is linked with the rest of\nthe platform by data flow: the data collected by the package is just stored on disk and one or several Lua\nscripts of the Core packages extract the data and push it to a C&C server or to an intermediate remote\nrepository.\n\n[For any inquiries contact intelreports@kaspersky com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com) Page 29 of 33\n\n\n-----\n\n### BUS manager stage 1 : bootstrap library\n\nSamples:\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Format Bits** **Linker** **Compilation**\n\n**timestamp**\n\n2A8785BF45F4F03C10CD929BB0685C2D 52736 DLL 32 9.0 2009.07.14 01:07:24\n\nF0E0CBF1498DBF9B8321D11D21C49811 59392 DLL 64 9.0 2009.07.14 01:29:49\n\nAC8072DFDA27F9EA068DCAD5712DD893 59392 DLL 64 9.0 2009.07.14 01:30:09\n\n2382A79F9764389ACFB4CB4692AA044D 50176 DLL 32 7.10 2010.06.15 12:09:09\n\n85EA0D79FF015D0B1E09256A880A13CE 52736 DLL 32 9.0 2012.01.04 11:27:34\n\n4728A97E720C564F6E76D0E22C76BAE5 65535 DLL 64 9.0 2012.01.04 11:27:53\n\nB98227F8116133DC8060F2ADA986631C 59392 DLL 64 9.0 2012.01.04 11:27:53\n\nThe module is expected to be activated in the process “services.exe”.
