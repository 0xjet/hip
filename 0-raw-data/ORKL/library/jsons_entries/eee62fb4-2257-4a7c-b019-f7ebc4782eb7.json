Demers, First Assistant\nUnited States Attorney for the Central District of California Tracy Wilkison and Assistant\nDirector in Charge Paul D. Delacourt of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office.\n\nIn addition to these criminal charges, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced today\nthat the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated\nPark and KEJV under Executive Order 13722 based on the malicious cyber and cyberenabled activity outlined in the criminal complaint.\n\n“Today’s announcement demonstrates the FBI’s unceasing commitment to unmasking and\nstopping the malicious actors and countries behind the world’s cyberattacks,” said FBI\nDirector Christopher Wray. “We stand with our partners to name the North Korean\ngovernment as the force behind this destructive global cyber campaign. This group’s actions\nare particularly egregious as they targeted public and private industries worldwide – stealing\nmillions of dollars, threatening to suppress free speech, and crippling hospital systems. We’ll\ncontinue to identify and illuminate those responsible for malicious cyberattacks and\nintrusions, no matter who or where they are.”\n\n“The scale and scope of the cyber-crimes alleged by the Complaint is staggering and\noffensive to all who respect the rule of law and the cyber norms accepted by responsible\nnations,” said Assistant Attorney General Demers. “The Complaint alleges that the North\nKorean government, through a state-sponsored group, robbed a central bank and citizens of\nother nations, retaliated against free speech in order to chill it half a world away, and created\ndisruptive malware that indiscriminately affected victims in more than 150 other countries,\ncausing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars’ worth of damage. The investigation,\nprosecution, and other disruption of malicious state-sponsored cyber activity remains among\nthe highest priorities of the National Security Division and I thank the FBI agents, DOJ\nprosecutors, and international partners who have put years of effort into this investigation.”\n\n“The complaint charges members of this North Korean-based conspiracy with being\nresponsible for cyberattacks that caused unprecedented economic damage and disruption to\nbusinesses in the United States and around the globe,” said First Assistant United States\nAttorney Tracy Wilkison. “The scope of this scheme was exposed through the diligent efforts\nof FBI agents and federal prosecutors who were able to unmask these sophisticated crimes\nthrough sophisticated means. They traced the attacks back to the source and mapped their\ncommonalities, including similarities among the various programs used to infect networks\nacross the globe. These charges send a message that we will track down malicious actors\n\n\n-----\n\nno matter how or where they hide. We will continue to pursue justice for those responsible for\nthe huge monetary losses and attempting to compromise the national security of the United\nStates.”\n\n“We will not allow North Korea to undermine global cybersecurity to advance its interests and\ngenerate illicit revenues in violation of our sanctions,” said Treasury Secretary Steven\nMnuchin. “The United States is committed to holding the regime accountable for its cyberattacks and other crimes and destabilizing activities.”\n\nPark is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, which\ncarries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit\nwire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\n**_About the Defendant Park and Chosun Expo Joint Venture_**\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the criminal complaint, which was filed on June 8,\n2018 in Los Angeles federal court, and posted today: Park Jin Hyok, was a computer\nprogrammer who worked for over a decade for Chosun Expo Joint Venture (a/k/a Korea\nExpo Joint Venture or “KEJV”). Chosun Expo Joint Venture had offices in China and the\nDPRK, and is affiliated with Lab 110, a component of DPRK military intelligence. In addition\nto the programming done by Park and his group for paying clients around the world, the\nConspiracy also engaged in malicious cyber activities. Security researchers that have\nindependently investigated these activities referred to this hacking team as the “Lazarus\nGroup.” The Conspiracy’s methods included spear-phishing campaigns, destructive malware\nattacks, exfiltration of data, theft of funds from bank accounts, ransomware extortion, and\npropagating “worm” viruses to create botnets.\n\n**_The Conspiracy’s Cyber Attacks, Heists, and Intrusions_**\n\nThe complaint describes a broad array of the Conspiracy’s alleged malicious cyber activities,\nboth successful and unsuccessful, and in the United States and abroad, with a particular\nfocus on four specific examples.\n\n**_Targeting the Entertainment Industry_**\n\nIn November 2014, the conspirators launched a destructive attack on Sony Pictures\nEntertainment (SPE) in retaliation for the movie “The Interview,” a farcical comedy that\ndepicted the assassination of the DPRK’s leader. The conspirators gained access to SPE’s\nnetwork by sending malware to SPE employees, and then stole confidential data, threatened\nSPE executives and employees, and damaged thousands of computers. Around the same\ntime, the group sent spear-phishing messages to other victims in the entertainment industry,\nincluding a movie theater chain and a U.K. company that was producing a fictional series\ninvolving a British nuclear scientist taken prisoner in DPRK.\n\n**_Targeting Financial Services_**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn February 2016, the Conspiracy stole $81 million from Bangladesh Bank. As part of the\ncyber-heist, the Conspiracy accessed the bank’s computer terminals that interfaced with the\nSociety for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) communication\nsystem after compromising the bank’s computer network with spear-phishing emails, then\nsent fraudulently authenticated SWIFT messages directing the Federal Reserve Bank of NY\nto transfer funds from Bangladesh to accounts in other Asian countries. The Conspiracy\nattempted to and did gain access to several other banks in various countries from 2015\nthrough 2018 using similar methods and “watering hole attacks,” attempting the theft of at\nleast $1 billion through such operations.\n\n**_Targeting of U.S. Defense Contractors_**\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, the Conspiracy targeted a number of U.S. defense contractors, including\nLockheed Martin, with spear-phishing emails. These malicious emails used some of the\nsame aliases and accounts seen in the SPE attack, at times accessed from North Korean IP\naddresses, and contained malware with the same distinct data table found in the malware\nused against SPE and certain banks, the complaint alleges. The spear-phishing emails sent\nto the defense contractors were often sent from email accounts that purported to be from\nrecruiters at competing defense contractors, and some of the malicious messages made\nreference to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system\ndeployed in South Korea. The attempts to infiltrate the computer systems of Lockheed\nMartin, the prime contractor for the THAAD missile system, were not successful.\n\n**_Creation of Wannacry 2.0_**\n\nIn May 2017, a ransomware attack known as WannaCry 2.0 infected hundreds of thousands\nof computers around the world, causing extensive damage, including significantly impacting\nthe United Kingdom’s National Health Service. The Conspiracy is connected to the\ndevelopment of WannaCry 2.0, as well as two prior versions of the ransomware, through\nsimilarities in form and function to other malware developed by the hackers, and by\nspreading versions of the ransomware through the same infrastructure used in other cyberattacks.\n\nPark and his co-conspirators were linked to these attacks, intrusions, and other malicious\ncyber-enabled activities through a thorough investigation that identified and traced: email and\nsocial media accounts that connect to each other and were used to send spear-phishing\nmessages; aliases, malware “collector accounts” used to store stolen credentials; common\nmalware code libraries; proxy services used to mask locations; and North Korean, Chinese,\nand other IP addresses. Some of this malicious infrastructure was used across multiple\ninstances of the malicious activities described herein. Taken together, these connections\nand signatures—revealed in charts attached to the criminal complaint—show that the attacks\nand intrusions were perpetrated by the same actors.\n\n**_Accompanying Mitigation Efforts_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThroughout the course of the investigation, the FBI and the Department provided specific\ninformation to victims about how they had been targeted or compromised, as well as\ninformation about the tactics and techniques used by the conspiracy with the goals of\nremediating any intrusion and preventing future intrusions. That direct sharing of information\ntook place in the United States and in foreign countries, often with the assistance of foreign\nlaw enforcement partners. The FBI also has collaborated with certain private cybersecurity\ncompanies by sharing and analyzing information about the intrusion patterns used by the\nmembers of the conspiracy.\n\nIn connection with the unsealing of the criminal complaint, the FBI and prosecutors provided\ncybersecurity providers and other private sector partners detailed information on accounts\nused by the Conspiracy in order to assist these partners in their own independent\ninvestigative activities and disruption efforts.\n\nThe maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided\nhere for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendant will be determined\nby the assigned judge.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Stephanie S.\nChristensen, Anthony J. Lewis, and Anil J. Antony of the United States Attorney’s Office for\nthe Central District of California, and DOJ Trial Attorneys David Aaron and Scott Claffee of\nthe National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. The\nCriminal Division’s Office of International Affairs provided assistance throughout this\ninvestigation, as did many of the FBI’s Legal Attachés, and foreign authorities around the\nworld.\n\nThe charges contained in the criminal complaint are merely accusations and the defendant is\npresumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nFor the U.S. Department of Treasury’s press release announcing corresponding sanctions\n[please visit www.treasury.gov.](http://www.treasury.gov/)\n\nAttachment(s):\n\n[Download 2018 09 06 Park Complaint Unsealed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1092091/download)\nTopic(s):\n\nCounterintelligence and Export Control\n\nNational Security\n\nPress Release Number:\n\n18-1452\n\n\n-----",
