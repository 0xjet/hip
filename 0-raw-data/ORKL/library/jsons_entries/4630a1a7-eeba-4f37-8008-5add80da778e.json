The new module contains a revamped version of its old banking\ncomponent that tries to intercept credentials for e-banking websites.\nCalled a “webinject” module, this component has been rewritten to include new\nmethods to inject malicious code inside banking websites.\nPer Kryptos Logic, this new code appears to have been copied from the old Zeus\nbanking malware, different from the two webinject techniques TrickBot had used in\nprevious years.\nZeus-style injects work by proxying traffic through a local SOCKS server. If the web\ntraffic matches a list of banking login URLs, the traffic is modified accordingly with\nmalicious code to record credentials or carry out other operations.\nPer Kryptos Logic, this new banking/webinject module shares substantial code\nwith [IcedID‘s webinject module.](https://therecord.media/icedid-malware-gang-positioning-itself-as-one-of-the-emotet-replacements/)\nThe move to support Zeus-style web injects may be an attempt from the TrickBot gang\nto muscle into the territory of other Malware-as-a-Service banking trojans and steal\nsome of their customers in the underground cybercrime market.\n\nThe resumption of development of the webinject module indicates that TrickBot intends\nto revive its bank fraud operation, which appears to have been shelved for over a year.\nThe addition of Zeus-style webinjects may suggest expansion of their Malware-as-aService platform, enabling users to bring their own webinjects.\n\n_Kryptos Logic Vantage Team._\n\nTrickBot has brought back their bank fraud module, which has been updated to support\nZeus-style webinjects. This could suggest they are resuming their bank fraud\noperation, and plan to expand access to those unfamiliar with their internal webinject\nformat.
