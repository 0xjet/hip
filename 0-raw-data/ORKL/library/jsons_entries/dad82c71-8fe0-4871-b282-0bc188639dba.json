The seizure included but was not limited to the Al\nQassam Brigades (AQB), which is Hamas’s military wing.\n\n[This action comes after a sizable uptick in cryptocurrency donations to Hamas in May following increased fighting between the](https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-gaza-conflict-spurs-bitcoin-donations-to-hamas-11622633400)\ngroup and Israeli forces. Notably, this is the first terrorism financing-related cryptocurrency seizure to include such a wide variety of\ncryptocurrencies, as NBCTF seized not just Bitcoin, but also Ether, XRP, Tether, and others, following an investigation focused\nlargely on analysis of OSINT, including social media posts, as well as blockchain data.\n\nBelow, we’ll look at how blockchain analysis contributed to the investigation.\n\n## Blockchain analysis shows movement of donation funds to exchanges\n\nThe [Chainalysis Reactor graph below shows the Bitcoin portion of the transactions carried out by many of the addresses listed in](https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-reactor/)\nthe NBCTF announcement. Many of these addresses have been attributed to individuals connected to the donation campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Open in new tab to enlarge_\nThe orange hexagons represent deposit addresses hosted by a large, mainstream cryptocurrency exchange and controlled by\nindividuals named in the NBCTF announcement. On the graph, we see how funds moved to those exchange addresses from\nHamas donation addresses, often passing first through intermediary wallets, high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges, and money\nservices businesses (MSBs). Interestingly, we can also see that two addresses named in the announcement received funds from\naddresses associated with the Idlib office of BitcoinTransfer, a Syrian cryptocurrency exchange connected to previous terrorism\nfinancing cases. Another received funds from a Middle East-based MSB that had previously received funds from the Ibn Taymiyya\n[Media Center (ITMC), an organization that has also been associated with terrorism financing in the past.](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/terrorism-financing-cryptocurrency-2019)\n\n## List of addresses seized and identified\n\nBelow is a list of all cryptocurrency addresses named in the NBCTF announcement, broken down by the individual controlling the\naddress where possible. We are also in the process of labeling these addresses in all of our products, and will notify clients of any\nexposure they have to them.\n\n**Ali Ismail Shafiq Abualkas**\n\n13iQsrwBYdrLpnitG5EV79o3PeHjH8XUBc\n15soXrE3NJBMkkQhrccXonTT9bpjpPvE67\n\nD5hkVKXQvJnw9nEvd36eRipxJgu1ts8ydx\n\n\n-----\n\n0xc077bbfcf9b5b9eec0dd105e15b65ebc2a030600\n12sDU3FyYJXc2oRzE6XXuuhVHCBJvaoCC8\nTRU6fdxpMMDdEykV1fPvcqtMNRLeyw6Ymt\n0xad92a818e26fc3dbce7a1972308a4a86f54dd683\nTG7YAAmZ5ALicdhuxKoE3DqnuBPj2zgG1Q\n\n**Mahmoud Madhat Ahmed Baroud**\n\n1GALPyvUDDXqA6H2eHQ9Y1yidfQ6T1Drvn\n0x99d29380a2e37c04e4fe75111b7d410674a6cab3\nrEb8TK3gBgk5auZkwc6sHnwrGVJH8DuaLh\nLcCBQ7fKwTrNf3nM522dcDXWsktbx95fTv\n\n1Gg25VzQkqCizXHNSNet4RoysLEe19su4s\nTJKofAGPQ2mSmnPwugN79p1Ceu39KBZyHC\nDDifCccot9tnVqh99qnQmFSXYX99jw2aD8\nGAHK7EEG2WWHVKDNT4CEQFZGKF2LGDSW2IVM4S5DP42RBW3K6BTODB4A\n27f405bf5c5caf0db56316b76dfc3067846cffcf8f2ffda5d5f754114ec1db35b3f6310fb25b\n12154055877559948854L\n\n**Tareq Alla Mohammedali Baraaasi**\n\n1Lm9BCDUKoBUk888DCXewM5p8bJyr83cEp\n\n0x11069987e8507d0669c870b578cc9f9b4017d127\nbnb136ns6lfw4zs5hg4n85vdthaad7hq5m4gtkgf23\nD7i5trghauwmVDT8KBqnwaYDrDU7j2xgS8\nTMKe9i1J46K3YDx5NjtyRTg1VDjbBhyfyJ\n\n**Mahmoud Mohammed Mahmoud Ayesh**\n\n164fawNZVwsR5SamAJypvCMtkMx4Xv1B3f\n0xddd42d46a17b9a5b0c53c5ef2b79a6acb1b50333\nLQsYaykwDfsKXKkVnQUNhyoVQuhiDEQrZT\n\n1481074704939202117L\nD7pCdGvzKPEtnuYnFVWtW4pTGTjD9v2Tuo\nDF6guxhXjjBPKMxFcy9LZQsMh8GnRRhbi2\nTVbaPNrc2UbGrGBKwjRjjn6UENoTBnkB2d\nSGP2HJQBCDEX4B4PH7TVIWJZ4YZZX5C5B3TQ24QA3USY7O5X2KO5V2FPXM\n13ztYvFxVpioqRvr8YUz7UmJm36ERJhMBG\n\n**Karem Munir Mohammed Abed**\n\n1JpSBaUwrZaEgmsYka7mzm9t3Z4syyaw7A\nTU1TTeKBxtCVYNHrVrobBtvGAeJvuqyx6p\n\n**Mohammed Ramadan Hasan Abukwaik**\n\n1A7pDH1EdrkH9YZtsPnc8uzirBFnAN9Eay\nLdEaGBJzGRyZBEo8vqRAeKLwRAK4hXwWP5\n0xebfe7a29ea17acb5f6f437e659bd2d472deedc54\n\n1BPf9qr7M5xUgNHUYtrQtEKvUKcyERzXao\nt1SfdPR5gMz1QAMGJKGTNgzCauTEMnNU6GR\nTXVG2seoqhk4i1WpzG6t64YAW6SCUQfDhW\nDKQfVwp2hm54XeUhwMbyccmgHmrP6kL7uz\n\n**Mohammed Nasser Ibrahim Abulaila**\n\n1DrhHEkv42JVwiDQNi28JFdSuiSGgPNXwP\nLLuDSfYfCXL24rhCGMLgguHWLvQHzHPm78\n\n\n-----\n\n0xc0d227bd0580bad9435ca0b884ebee7ff8da71c9\n1EnX6BuJiGWydqXJT9BN5dSvfLg3QW4Mdz\n3177043342364495742L\nD8jJNUtbmC9z1nfY8QRJ2GNWYFQz5btGot\n66413449033389c6d27e9515284a9d8fd0eacf6e2c69e916b7f5451deeb4723a68c2b78e4974\nSNwdHP6Qpkk6exSAqMG4GdTRkQRAu28SSS\nTHuvw2pY2GSBmDewHKzahQum2yUWHJeJKh\n\n**Other**\n\n1QH9hfeSSb2iftcVpgpQp3NsFD174crFoW\n1EfmRn6Bp3cjrTBubaH8MzRRc2ikSjNGXw\n1Lm9BCDUKoBUk888DCXewM5p8bJyr83cEp\n19D1iGzDr7FyAdiy3ZZdxMd6ttHj1kj6WW\n3FWSkG5NmyXF3rqMav7piXiJUDYzKpgFRT\n17QAWGVpFV4gZ25NQug46e5mBho4uDP6MD\n1QAV9VoTVw7XoyqiTjmNHaKSkNc9QWfqAh\n3HQJ9ta7TmYNRjkby3nbMGdHzNCCiXs3Ui\n18yzhmcgHtRVoEX3doCrqhis6fFU1dHFUE\n0xe090669ee62e02f4437b89058a073dc7874aed8f\n179bzhS4FY7qLDza9YjuorhWyXVVYZu2YH\n1LPTaRfyoNwvwAtmYzcetZLjBfUxVkJrr4\nbc1qg9h7s7hn4t9m7uw26gnwfm7xfxk77fkj878sg3\n19XVEDZCGVMA9WCF1qUayxtnjUnyD7zDDQ\n1uLdz4wXrcXjCy2CqLWuJUiE85Y7SJ1ge\n1ULEqcd5te8AWqFpH7HD4KvJZ1AKcJPam\n1348ThkNoDupq1bws95diMiL8haGs61K7M\n1EVTZmTMqZPMzGxsug9TXBtvPJZH8dXSCK\n1EDcKCRypUTFoTZbxDWF9MBAT4W7XUGB32\n1EYya5dfNvuYDwpeboGKBtkXzJcEHMCQXR\n1LhRW1msre1cFgT7fBY2BRrZ4ANMPwVj9u\n31yqH1jVEPDJ7x9L648Ec5umM2G3zNDoe5\nbc1qwsqdcas3llkcx53sx4lqrcrdpxmr5s4eke6d8y\n3MhdvQccMd5zAh92WrW7SpcHXwfW1uiamD\n1GC2SjzCyCwxo1uxTi28oqn9L3mJj7bLPs\n1C6hetVWVXZnS6P2BYBNu5Y1ZJ57JyXGac\nTC71Nb9mtcv4vPezL8KEKvUs3aKoYwiJZa\nTAHg5ZFkxaJq5wE6pGpM8mY5Q1YEvz6W3G\nD9KKhKM68nRaYtQJJAA82cKhd3bGWqCW46\nDNmxLVUn5AuzoDo2CSc7P13wcMSvZ4nsYY\nRPW95tQG7y47QTqS6cNA4EQ5mBmATrG91o\n3c61d17a6a55c7434afa3cb43e4dcef2819f38cff2484a6c1e2fffaf089548e2db3328145343\nDdzFFzCqrht4k4DfGDtBaqv6boi1jjyzW2QyEFA2imphJipAcAfdEUyFeMZJtBjjiQJBFYk8JZHffuqgUK9hxbjRwrNpeUgPD78U49Vt\n\n## The value of blockchain analysis in conjunction with other data sources\n\nThis investigation is a perfect example of the value of blockchain analysis, especially when used in conjunction with other open\nsource data. Israeli authorities analyzed OSINT to find Hamas’ donation addresses and, with blockchain analysis tools, were able\nto follow the funds to find consolidation addresses and uncover the names of individuals associated with the campaigns. Up to\ndate transaction data across several blockchains was crucial here, as agents tracked and seized funds in several different varieties\nof cryptocurrency. We commend the Israeli authorities for a successful operation and look forward to facilitating more such\nsuccesses for our government partners around the world.\n\n\n-----",
