    "plain_text": "# New variant of Mac Trojan discovered, targeting Tibet\n\n**nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/11/13/new-mac-trojan/**\n\nBy Graham Cluley 13 Nov 2012\n\nIt’s true to say that there’s a lot lot less malware in existence for\n\nMacs than there is for Windows PCs. But that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist at all.\n\nAnd clinging onto the statistics of the much smaller proportion of Mac malware compared to\nWindows malware is going to be cold comfort if your Apple Mac is the one which ends up\ngetting infected.\n\nThe latest Mac malware seen by the experts at SophosLabs, is a new variant of the\nOSX/Imuler Trojan horse. In the past, earlier variants of the OSX/Imuler malware has been\n[spread via topless photos of a Russian supermodel or embedded deep inside boobytrapped](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/03/20/topless-supermodel-photos-used-to-spread-mac-malware/)\nPDF files.\n\nThis time, it appears that the a version of the Imuler Trojan has been used in an targeted\nattack against sympathisers of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government, as the malware\nappears to have been packaged with images of Tibetan organisations.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf your Mac was successfully infected by malware like this, you have effectively given remote\ncontrol of your computer and your data to an invisible and unknown party. They could steal\nfiles from your Mac, spy on your emails, and plant further malware onto your systems.\n\n(It will be left as an exercise to the reader to come up with a shortlist of who might have an\ninterest in breaking into the computers of Tibetan organisations).\n\n[Customers of Sophos, including users of Sophos’s free anti-virus for Mac, are protected](http://www.sophos.com/freemacav)\n[against the malware which has been detected as a variant of the OSX/Imuler-B backdoor](http://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/threat-analyses/viruses-and-spyware/OSX~Imuler-B.aspx)\nTrojan since the early hours of 11th November 2012.\n\nUsers of other Mac anti-virus products may be wise to check with their vendors if they are\nprotected.\n\nThis new malware variant may not be widespread – but it is another indication that the\nmalware threat on Macs is real, and should not be underestimated.\n\n\n-----",
