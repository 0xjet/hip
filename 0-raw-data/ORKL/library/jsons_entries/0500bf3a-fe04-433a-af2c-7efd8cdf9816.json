As such, it shows unusual effort by its\nauthors to evade detection and emulation, and progress towards a modular architecture.\n\nWe have seen Grandoreiro being distributed solely through spam. The authors usually\nutilize a fake Java or Flash update, but recently, perhaps unsurprisingly, we have\nobserved their spam abusing the fear around COVID-19 as well.\n\nWe have named this malware family based on its most notable characteristic – its\nbinaries being bloated to at least a few hundred megabytes. Its development is quite rapid\nand feature changes and additions are happening very often. In this blogpost, we will\nfocus on the most noteworthy.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nGrandoreiro is another Delphi-written Latin American banking trojan we have identified\nduring our research. Grandoreiro has been active at least since 2017 targeting Brazil and\nPeru, expanding to Mexico and Spain in 2019 (see Figure 1 for a current detection heat\nmap). The fact that it attacks its victims by displaying fake pop-up windows that try to\npersuade victims to divulge sensitive information should come as no surprise to anyone\nwho has read the previous pieces in the series.\n.\n\n_Figure 1. Heat map showing ESET’s detections of Grandoreiro._\n\n\n-----\n\nGrandoreiro, as with any other Latin American banking trojan, employs backdoor\nfunctionality, being capable of:\n\nmanipulating windows\nupdating itself\ncapturing keystrokes\nsimulating mouse and keyboard actions\nnavigating the victim’s browser to a chosen URL\nlogging the victim out or restarting the machine\nblocking access to chosen websites\n\nPersistence is ensured by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory. Of\nimportance is the fact that Grandoreiro uses the same algorithm for decrypting its\n[internal strings as Casbaneiro. We believe this is due to information sharing between](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/03/casbaneiro-trojan-dangerous-cooking/)\nauthors of banking trojans in Latin America.\n\nGrandoreiro collects the following information about its victims:\n\ncomputer name\nusername\noperating system version and bitness\nwhether Diebold Warsaw GAS Tecnologia (an application, popular in Brazil, to\nprotect access to online banking) is installed\nlist of installed security products\n\nIn some versions, it also steals credentials stored in the Google Chrome web browser and\ndata stored in Microsoft Outlook.\n\nThe authors of Grandoreiro seem to be developing the banking trojan very rapidly, as we\nobserve at least several new versions each month. We also suspect they are developing at\nleast two variants simultaneously.\n\nThe authors seem to focus mainly on two areas. The first is hiding the actual C&C address\nusing the Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) described in next section. The second is\nmaking the banking trojan modular. This is an interesting approach as the authors first\nintroduced separate Delphi forms for each bank targeted (which is quite common), but\nlately even created separate DLLs for each targeted bank. We have not seen this approach\nin any other Latin American banking trojan we have analyzed.\n\n### DGA\n\nGrandoreiro’s DGA uses two strings (prefix and suffix) hardcoded in the binary and the\nlocal date as inputs. Those values are processed by a simple algorithm yielding a result in\nthe form https://sites.google[.]com/view/%DATA%, where %DATA% is the generated\nstring (we provide pseudocode in Figure 2). The C&C domain and port are used as the site\n\n\n-----\n\ntitle, as you can see in Figure 3. Note that based on the DGA, a different website is\nrequired for each day. We have observed some variants also using a custom base64\nalphabet.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\ndef dga(prefix, suffix):\n\nts = get_current_time()\n\nmid_data = \"%02d/%02d/%04d\" % (ts.day, ts.month, ts.year)\n\nmid_data = b64encode(mid_data)\n\nmid_data = mid_data.replace(\"==\", \"\")\n\nreturn \"https://sites.google.com/view/\" + prefix + mid_data + suffix\n\n\n_Figure 2. Pseudocode of Grandoreiro’s DGA_\n\n_Figure 3. Example of a Google site set up by authors of Grandoreiro (translation: “Title of your_\n\n_page”)_\n\n### Configuration data\n\nIn older versions of Grandoreiro, there was a small .ini file distributed alongside the\nbanking trojan that served as a primitive configuration file, containing only a version\nidentifier and an index into a table in the binary that decided which C&C server should be\nused.\n\n\n-----\n\nLately, the configuration mechanism has been changed and is now stored in the Windows\nRegistry at HKCU\\Software\\ under keys with names like %USERNAME% and ToolTechRM. Those names, as well as the names of values they contain, change frequently, but the\ninformation contained consists of:\n\nan identifier unique for each victim (generated via CoCreateGuid API)\nexecutable name and path\n[geolocation of the victim (retrieved via http://ipinfo.io/json)](http://ipinfo.io/json)\nstrings necessary for creating and deleting the startup .LNK file\nnotes specific to the victim device (the C&C operator supplies these, if any, via a\nbackdoor command)\nflags to indicate an action has already been performed, such as\n\nstealing Google Chrome stored credentials\nstealing Outlook data\n\n## C&C communication\n\n[Grandoreiro implements communication with its C&C server using the RealThinClient](https://rtc.teppi.net/)\nSDK. This component uses a protocol that operates over HTTP. After connecting to the\nserver, Grandoreiro performs a handshake and then periodically checks for commands\nevery few seconds. If the trojan misses a check, the server drops the connection.\n\n[As we described in our Botconf presentation in December 2019, and as reported recently](https://www.botconf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/B2019-Soucek-Hornak-DemystifyingBankingTrojansFromLatinAmerica.pdf)\n[by SonicWall, there is a very interesting thing about the first “command” received from](https://securitynews.sonicwall.com/xmlpost/google-sites-are-being-abused-by-grandoreiro-banking-trojan-to-host-its-cc-server-address/)\nthe C&C server. It is always a list of all currently connected victims, including all the\ncollected information about their machines, as you can see in Figure 4. Note that not all\nthe victims are identified by a string with the same format. Due to Grandoreiro’s rapid\ndevelopment, this string changes quite often, but victims compromised with different\nvariants still connect to the same C&C server.\n\n_Figure 4. C&C server responding to initial Grandoreiro connection with a list of currently connected_\n\n_victims._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Distribution\n\nSpam seems to be the sole distribution method for Grandoreiro. The spam emails appear\nto contain a link pointing to a website offering fake Flash or Java updates (see Figure 5).\nNotice the red arrow in lower left corner tailored for the Google Chrome web browser, but\ndisplayed in other browsers too. We have seen Grandoreiro abusing the fear around\nCOVID-19 as well (see Figure 6), as we already announced on our @ESETresearch\nTwitter account.\n\n_Figure 5. Fake Flash (left) and Java (right) update websites (the left checkbox states that the user_\n_agrees with terms and conditions; the text on the right urges the user to install the latest version of_\n\n_Java to avoid issues with security and vulnerabilities)_\n\n_Figure 6. Fake COVID-19 website. Clicking the video leads to the ZIP archive being downloaded_\n_(translation: “Construction of 2 hospitals in 7 days: accelerated video shows construction of hospital_\n\n_in China in 7 days”)_\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike the majority of Latin American banking trojans, Grandoreiro utilizes quite small\ndistribution chains. For different campaigns, it may choose a different type of\ndownloader, as we illustrate in Figure 7. These downloaders are often stored on wellknown public online sharing services such as GitHub, Dropbox, Pastebin, 4shared and\n4Sync.\n\n_Figure 7. Possible ways that Grandoreiro distribution chains may appear (different colors show_\n_different paths the chain may take). The final ZIP archive may be encrypted and in some cases also_\n\n_protected by a password._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final payload is a ZIP archive that is usually encrypted by the algorithm shown in\nFigure 8 and, in a significant number of cases, we saw it being password-protected as\nwell.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\ndef decrypt_archive(data_enc, key):\n\ndata_dec = list()\n\nfor (i, c) in enumerate(data_enc):\n\nd = c ^ (~(key >> (i % 32))) & 0xFF\n\ndata_dec.append(d)\n\nreturn data_dec\n\n\n_Figure 8. Pseudocode of the archive decryption algorithm used by Grandoreiro_\n\nDistributing the final payload in a ZIP archive is very common among these banking\ntrojans, but in the case of Grandoreiro, it holds extra importance, as you will see in the\nnext section.\n\n## Binary padding\n\nThe vast majority of Grandoreiro samples utilize a very interesting application of the\n[binary padding technique. This technique is all about making the binaries large and we](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1009/)\n[have seen it being used even by more sophisticated malware. We have also observed some](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/)\nother Latin American banking trojans employing it occasionally, but only in the simplest\nform of appending a large amount of junk at the end of the binary.\n\nGrandoreiro chooses a different approach – a simple, yet very effective one. The resources\nsection of the PE file is augmented by (usually 3) grande BMP images, making each\nbinary at least 300 MB in size. Notice in Figure 9 that the size of the whole EXE is\n425 MB, yet the size of the code is only 4 MB and the size of the .rsrc section 419 MB\n(98.5% of the total size). After examining the contents of the .rsrc section, we see three\nimages with sizes of 112 MB, 112 MB and 105 MB respectively (taking up 78.5% of the\nsection size). We provide examples of such images in Figure 10.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Details of a Grandoreiro binary. Several Grandoreiro binaries are shown in the image on_\n\n_the left. The rest show details of one such binary._\n\n_Figure 10. BMP images used by Grandoreiro for binary padding. Their artistic “style” suggests the_\n\n_malware’s authors create them manually._\n\nBecause of the structure of those BMP files, compressing the binary into a ZIP archive\nyields a file of only a few MB, making it much easier to distribute the payload. The BMP\nfiles seem to change frequently, most likely to avoid detection. The images shown in\nFigure 10 come from three different builds of Grandoreiro. The visible similarities lead us\nto believe the authors update the images manually.\n\nLet us look at the possible outcomes of this technique because, even though it is very\nsimple, it is surprisingly effective. The upload file size limit on VirusTotal was changed to\n[550 MB during 2019, but used to be 256 MB, so a victim was unable to scan the file using](https://blog.virustotal.com/2017/08/virustotal-gets-new-hairdo.html)\nthat platform. Working with such a huge file is harder in general, making any automated\nor manual analyses much slower. At the same time, it is very hard to get rid of these large\nimages while keeping a valid PE file, and by discarding the whole .rsrc section, interesting\ninformation such as the fake pop-up windows is lost.\n\n## Self-protection & anti-emulation\n\nFor a Latin American banking trojan, Grandoreiro utilizes a surprisingly large number of\ntricks to evade detection and emulation. In this section, we talk about the most notable\nones that appeared in several recent versions we have analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\nDiebold Warsaw GAS Tecnologia and Trusteer are known banking access protection\nsoftware popular in Latin America. Every banking trojan described so far in our series has\nimplemented some sort of check for these programs. Grandoreiro is no exception, by\n\nhooking the LdrLoadDll and LoadLibrary(Ex) APIs to prevent loading DLLs\nbelonging to those products\nchecking if any of those modules are already loaded\ntrying to kill their running processes (based on process names)\nblocking Diebold Warsaw on the firewall level\ntrying to break Trusteer by changing its file system path (see Figure 11)\nchanging ACLs on main Trusteer binary by running this command twice:\n\ncacls %PROGRAM_DATA%;\nTrusteer\\Rapport\\store\\exts\\RapportCerberus\\baseline\\RapportGH.dll” /T\n/E /C /P user:perm\nwith user:perm set to Todos:N and then Everyone:N\n\n_Figure 11. Simple BAT script used by Grandoreiro to change Trusteer file path in hopes of_\n\n_making it unable to execute_\n\nBesides that, it also monitors hooks on important functions. If such a function starts with\n0xE9 (assembly opcode for the jmp instruction), the trojan reloads the function from the\ncorresponding library. Based on window and process names, it also checks for tools like\nRegMon, RegShot, Wireshark and Process Explorer. It tries to avoid being debugged by\ncalling the IsDebuggerPresent API and setting up a hook via SetWindowsHookEx that\nreturns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED on the WH_DEBUG event.\n\nGrandoreiro also employs a technique for privilege escalation described in more detail\n[here. The method relies on registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files and](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malicious-macro-bypasses-uac-to-elevate-privilege-for-fareit-malware.html)\nthen running such a file. By doing so, the binary will be executed with elevated privileges.\n[This technique no longer works on patched systems due to a fix released in 2017.](https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/microsoft-fixes-eventvwr-exe-uac-bypass-exploit-windows-10-creators-update/)\n\nFinally, Grandoreiro detects two virtual environments – VMWare via its special I/O port\n[and Virtual PC via the vpcext instruction. Both methods are described in detail here](https://shasaurabh.blogspot.com/2017/07/virtual-machine-detection-techniques.html)\n(techniques 1 and 2).\n\n## Spam tool\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our investigation, we discovered a tool used for Grandoreiro’s spam campaigns. It\nis not a tool that automatically registers large numbers of email accounts, as in the case of\n[Amavaldo and Casbaneiro; it is actually used to create and send the spam messages. It](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/01/banking-trojans-amavaldo/)\n[does so by utilizing the EASendMail SDK.](https://www.emailarchitect.net/easendmail)\n\nBesides its main purpose, the tool sets up persistence using the Windows Registry Run\nkey and disables UAC. The most probable scenario is that the attackers distribute this tool\nto some victims via Grandoreiro.\n\nA small backdoor component is included and used to receive configuration files. Those\nfiles dictate what the emails will look like, what they will point to or where to send them.\nWe provide a complete list of the configuration files and their purpose in Table 1.\n\n_Table 1. List of configuration files used by Grandoreiro’s spam tool_\n\n**File-**\n**name** **Purpose** **Description**\n\nID.txt None Seems not to be used for the spam emails\n\n\nhtml.txt Email body\ntemplate\n\n\nassunto.txt\n\n\nSubject template\n(assunto =\nsubject)\n\n\nTemplate for the email body (including placeholders those are replaced by values from other config files)\n\nTemplate for subject (similar to html.txt for email\nbody)\n\n\nnomes.txt List of fake names Replaces [NOME] placeholder in the templates\n\n\nlink.txt List of malicious\nURLs\n\n\nThe email will link to one of these\n\n\nlista.txt List of recipients The email will be sent to all of these\n\nlogin.txt List of usernames Information required to log into the email account\nthat will be used to send the emails\nsenha.txt List of passwords\n\nsmtp.txt SMTP server\naddress\n\nAs you can see, the tool is not fully automated, but relies completely on the configuration\ndata. This shows a lower level of sophistication. Its implementation shows similarities\nwith the Grandoreiro banking trojan, which is why we believe it was written by the same\nauthors.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this installment of our series, we have focused on Grandoreiro, a Latin American\nbanking trojan known to target Brazil, Mexico, Spain and Peru. We have mentioned\naspects that are typical for that type of banking trojan, such as being written in Delphi,\ncontaining backdoor functionality, targeting Latin America and using fake pop-up\nwindows to attack its victims.\n\nA novel feature of Grandoreiro is its great effort to evade detection. That includes many\ntechniques to detect or even disable banking protection software. It also utilizes a very\nspecific application of the binary padding technique we have not seen before that makes it\nhard to get rid of the padding while keeping a valid file.\n\nSpam appears to be the exclusive distribution method for Grandoreiro. The emails\ncontain a link that points victims to fake websites set up by the operators. While they\nusually use simple mechanisms such as fake Flash or Java updates, we have seen them\nexploiting the current fear of COVID-19 as well.\n\nGrandoreiro shows similarities with other banking trojans previously described in this\nseries, mainly Casbaneiro, with which it shares the string decryption algorithm.\n\n_For any inquiries, contact us at threatintel@eset.com.
