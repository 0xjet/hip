We detail how the**\n\n**attackers continuously adapt their campaigns to their targets, shifting tactics from document-based malware to conventional**\n\n**phishing that draws on “inside” knowledge of community activities. This adaptation appears to track changes in security behaviors**\n\n**[within the Tibetan community, which has been promoting a move from sharing attachments via e-mail to using cloud-based file�](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4E1SRDmtZE)**\n\n**sharing alternatives such as Google Drive.**\n\n**We connect the attack group’s infrastructure and techniques to a group previously identified by Palo Alto Networks, which they�**\n\n**[named Scarlet Mimic. We provide further context on Scarlet Mimic’s targeting and tactics, and the intended victims of their attack](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/)**\n\n**campaigns. In addition, while Scarlet Mimic may be conducting malware attacks using other infrastructure, we analyze how the**\n\n**attackers re-purposed a cluster of their malware Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to mount the recent phishing campaign.**\n\n**This move is only the latest development in the ongoing cat and mouse game between attack groups like Scarlet Mimic and the**\n\n**Tibetan community. The speed and ease with which attackers continue to adapt highlights the challenges faced by Tibetans who**\n\n**are trying to remain safe online.**\n\n# Background\n\n**The Tibetan community has been the target of malware-enabled espionage campaigns for over a decade. The attackers**\n\n**responsible for these campaigns are relentless in their attempts to compromise networks and harvest sensitive information. These**\n\n**attacks often demonstrate high levels of sophistication in the social engineering used to entice targets to open malicious**\n\n**[attachments or links, but are typically not very technically advanced. A common technique is the use of document-based malware.](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-hardy.pdf)**\n\n**[In a recent four-year study on targeted malware attacks against civil society, which included six Tibetan groups, we found that](https://targetedthreats.net/)**\n\n**document-based malware was the most common attack vector, accounting in some cases for up to 95 percent of all attacks against**\n\n**specific Tibetan groups.�**\n\n**The Tibetan community has recognized these patterns and made efforts to change user behaviors to mitigate the attacks. For**\n\n**[example, groups have started a digital security training campaign called “Detach from Attachments”, which urges users to avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4E1SRDmtZE)**\n\n**sending or opening email attachments, and to use cloud-based storage (e.g., Google Drive) to send files instead. However, as the�**\n\n**community changes behaviors, so do the attackers.**\n\n**[Recently, Palo Alto Networks reported on a years-long espionage campaign they call “Scarlet Mimic” that targeted Tibetan and](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/)**\n\n**Uyghur groups (as well as government agencies in Russia and India). The Scarlet Mimic campaigns are a typical example of the**\n\n**attacks civil society faces. Carefully crafted email lures are sent to targets carrying exploits that leverage well-known vulnerabilities**\n\n**[(e.g., CVE-2012-0158&lt, CVE-2010-3333), which we have seen used in campaigns against Tibetan groups frequently in recent](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158)**\n\n**years.**\n\n**In this post, we show that servers used as malware C2 infrastructure by Scarlet Mimic are now hosting phishing pages designed to**\n\n**steal Google credentials from Tibetan activists and journalists. This shift in tactics from malware to phishing campaigns suggests**\n\n**that the attackers are adapting to behavioral changes in the Tibetan community. In the following sections, we provide an overview of**\n\n**malware campaigns connected to Scarlet Mimic we observed targeting Tibetan groups from 2013-2014, and analyze how the same**\n\n**infrastructure is now being used to host a wave of phishing attacks. We conclude with discussion of what may have motivated this**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[According to Palo Alto Networks, Scarlet Mimic has been active for at least four years. The attack group primarily uses well-known](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/)**\n\n**[vulnerabilities and the “FakeM” malware family first reported by �Trend Micro in 2013, which attempts to disguise its malicious traffic�](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-fakem-rat.pdf)**\n\n**as commonly used protocols.**\n\n**A cluster of Scarlet Mimic attacks used the FakeM Custom SSL variant and were deployed on C2 infrastructure that relied on free**\n\n**[domains provided by Securepoint, a German dynamic DNS service. Dynamic DNS services typically allow anyone to make free](https://www.spdns.de/)**\n\n**subdomains from a main domain. In the case of Securepoint, this service allows anyone to make free subdomains from**\n\n**[*.firewall-gateway.com, *.my-gateway.org, *.myfirewall.org and others. We speculate that the attackers may have](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/65/files?diff=split)**\n\n**selected this particular service, because the domains have innocuous technical names (e.g, *.firewall-gateway.com) that**\n\n**may escape casual scrutiny. These kinds of domains can change ownership over time and may be shared by many unrelated users,**\n\n**which can also make analysis more challenging.**\n\n**Our analysis of attacks against the Tibetan community reveals a series of campaigns active from 2013 to 2014 using the FakeM**\n\n**Custom SSL variant and dynamic DNS infrastructure that is linked to Scarlet Mimic. These malware samples are described in detail**\n\n**[in the Palo Alto Networks Scarlet Mimic report. Through our engagement with the targeted groups, we provide further context that](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/)**\n\n**demonstrates the level of social engineering and targeting put into the attacks. Understanding this context provides insights into the**\n\n**attackers’ tactics, including their later pivot to phishing campaigns.**\n\n## Campaign 1\n\n**The first attack that we connected to Scarlet Mimic was observed in a July 3, 2013 e-mail. The email was sent to the internal�**\n\n**mailing list for a steering committee of a Tibetan NGO, and was highly customized. The message spoofed the e-mail of the NGO’s**\n\n**director, and demonstrated familiarity with the internal workings of the organization. Under the pretext of an updated strategic plan,**\n\n**the e-mail encouraged recipients to open the attached document titled “[Organization Name] Updated Strategic Plan.doc”**\n\n\n**From: [Redacted]**\n**Date: 03 Jul 2013**\n**Subject: Re: [Steering Committee] conclusions to Strategic Plan Review**\n**To: [Redacted]**\n**Dear Steering Committee Members, Thanks everyone for all of the good suggestions! Here is the Updated Strategic Plan and we’re**\n**looking forward to more comments please!**\n\n**[Redacted signature]**\n\n\n**The malicious attachment installs the file �pshvb.exe with the MD5 hash:**\n\n\n**8b83fc5d3a6a80281269f9e337fe3fff**\n\n\n**This hash matches a FakeM Custom SSL variant sample described in the Palo Alto Networks report. The malware connected to a**\n\n**C2 server on the domain: news[.]firewall-gateway[.]com. At the time of the attack this domain resolved to the IP address**\n\n**[109[.]169[.]77[.]230, and was hosted on UK-based virtual server provider iomart](http://www.iomart.com/)**\n\n## Campaign 2\n\n**We observed the attackers again on March 19, 2014 when they targeted a different Tibetan group. The attack masqueraded as a**\n\n**message from a representative of the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (HHDL) in Taiwan and contained an attachment that�**\n\n**referenced an upcoming visit of HHDL to Japan.**\n\n**Similar to the previous attack, the attachment dropped the FakeM Custom SSL variant, and is also referenced in the Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks report. In this case the malware connected to the C2 detail43[.]myfirewall[.]org, which at the time of the attack**\n\n**also resolved to the same IP address as the previous campaign, 109[.]169[.]77[.]230.**\n\n**Another set of attacks spanned from June to July 2014 targeting the same Tibetan group and a number of Tibetan journalists. The**\n\n**Tibetan group received multiple e-mails purportedly from NGOs working on Tibetan issues, while the journalists were enticed by a**\n\n**promise of survey results on Tibetan political attitudes.**\n\n**All of these attacks used the same FakeM Custom SSL variant and connected to the C2 sys[.]firewall-gateway[.]net,**\n\n**which resolved to 95[.]154[.]195[.]159 at the time of the attack and was also hosted on UK server provider iomart. See**\n\n**Figure 1 for an overview of the campaign.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Overview of Campaign 2, showing how the same malicious files are spread using�_**\n\n**_different pretexts._**\n\n# Part 2: Old Infrastructure, New Tricks\n\n**Throughout November 2015 we observed Scarlet Mimic’s C2 infrastructure being repurposed to host phishing attacks against the**\n\n**Tibetan community. The phishing campaign we identified consisted of targeted emails with email senders and messages that are�**\n\n**relevant to the Tibetan community. The emails appeared to share links to documents or videos on Google Drive or video sharing**\n\n**websites.**\n\n## The Phishing Campaign\n\n**Using the example of an e-mail sent to Tibetan journalists, we can demonstrate how a typical phishing attack in the campaign**\n\n**works. The e-mail masquerades as sent by a Tibetan activist, describes a video on China and Tibet, and shares a link to what**\n\n**appears to be a video sharing site.**\n\n\n**From: Dorjee Tenzin <tenzinsft@gmail.com>**\n**Date: 22 Nov 2015**\n**Subject: How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – video**\n**To: [Redacted]**\n**This video – How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – is short and easy to understand. Must watch.**\n**http://www.downvids.net/how-china-takes-care-of-tibet-and-tibetans-595657.html**\n\n\n**In fact, the link directs the user to a phishing page:**\n\n\n**http://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/serviclogin**\n\n\n**The site displays a lookalike to the Google Gmail login page (see Figure 2).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Comparison of Google login phishing page (left) and authentic Google login as of_**\n\n**_March 2016 (right)._**\n\n**Interestingly, the login page used by the attackers is slightly outdated. Their version includes both username and password prompts**\n\n**[on the same page. Google has been using a two-prompt process for authentication since May 2015](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/oAsE-6wmaSU)**\n\n**If a victim enters their credentials, the data is sent to the attackers via an HTTP POST request that is formatted as:**\n\n**http://accountgoogle.firewall-gateway.com/serviclogin/ojkiojr09[.]asp. An example of the data that is sent**\n\n**back to attackers is provided in Figure 3.**\n\n**_Figure 3: A sample of the data sent to the attackers. The Email and Password fields are the�_**\n\n**_most relevant._**\n\n### Decoy Content\n\n**Once a user enters their credentials they are redirected to decoy content. In the example attack against Tibetan journalists, if the**\n\n**victim entered their credentials they were re-directed to the video “How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans” on the video**\n\n**sharing site referenced in the email (see Figure 4).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: Screenshot of destination content._**\n\n**The destination content that the user is sent to is determined by a string in the subdirectory of the URL that has various misspellings**\n\n**of “servicelogin”. In the emails we collected, we found three subdirectory variations:**\n\n\n**http://filegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicelogin**\n**http://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/serviclogin**\n**http://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicclogin**\n\n\n**We speculate that the last part of the URL, “ojkiojr09” in our example URL (http://accountgoogle.firewall-**\n\n**gateway.com/serviclogin/ojkiojr09[.]asp) may be a campaign code, or a way for the attackers to differentiate on their**\n\n**end who is accessing the phished page, and the destination content to which they should be forwarded. We see a similar string in**\n\n**another of the emails that may be used for this purpose: http://filegoogle[.]firewall-**\n\n**gateway[.]com/servicelogin/sfwef[.]asp**\n\n### Phishing Campaign Timeline\n\n**We have observed the campaign active between at least November 9, 2015 to December 18, 2015. During this period we collected**\n\n**three phishing emails sent to Tibetan journalists and NGOs. Monitoring the URLs that link to the phishing page reveals that the**\n\n**destination content to which the user would be forwarded was changed frequently. These changes suggest that the campaign was**\n\n**active beyond the three emails we collected and the attackers were sending out additional emails with messages linked to the new**\n\n**destination content.**\n\n**Figure 5 provides a timeline for the campaign and shows when emails were received, the original destination content provided, and**\n\n**changes to the destination content over time. On December 18 the servers were up, but no content was being served in reply to**\n\n**logins.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: Timeline of phishing campaign (see Appendix A for full details)._**\n\n**While we only collected three emails during the span of the campaign, changes in the destination content suggest the timing and**\n\n**theme of further phishing attacks. On November 25, 2015 the destination content on URLs 1 and 2 were both changed to climate**\n\n**change-related content.**\n\n**The content redirected from URL 1 was changed to a public Google Drive folder that contained campaign materials on climate**\n\n**change from a Tibetan NGO. The content redirected from URL 2 was changed to a website used to organize the Global Climate**\n\n**March (globalclimatemarch.org), a demonstration to raise climate change awareness.**\n\n**The climate change theme is significant. During this period Tibetan organizations were taking part in advocacy to raise awareness�**\n\n**[on climate change in Tibetan areas in anticipation of the United Nations Conference on Climate Change held in Paris, France from](http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/)**\n\n**November 30 to December 12, 2015.**\n\n**See Appendix A for details on each attack and destination content change.**\n\n## Overlap with Scarlet Mimic\n\n**Similar to the previous FakeM Custom SSL campaigns, the phishing pages used domains provided by Securepoint’s dynamic DNS**\n\n**service:**\n\n\n**filegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com**\n**accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com**\n**detail43[.]myfirewall[.]org**\n\n\n**Similar to the previous malware campaigns, all three of these domains are also hosted on iomart.**\n\n**We observed the first phishing campaign using this infrastructure in early November 2015. During this time, two of the domains�**\n\n**(filegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com, accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com) resolved to the IP address**\n\n**95[.]154[.]195[.]171.**\n\n**[We further investigated this IP address through passive DNS data sources in PassiveTotal and found additional domains that match](https://www.passivetotal.org/)**\n\n**the “firewall-gateway” naming scheme observed in the Scarlet Mimic malware campaigns:**\n\n\n**accountsgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com**\n**accounts-google[.]firewall-gateway[.]com**\n**accountsgoogles[.]firewall-gateway[.]com**\n**googlefile[.]firewall-gateway[.]net**\n**firewallupdate[.]firewall-gateway[.]com**\n**firewallupdate[.]firewall-gateway[.]net**\n**drivgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com**\n\n\n-----\n\n**eco ds s o s t e** **ast uctu e e at o s ps bet ee** **t e p e ous Sca et** **c ca** **pa g s a d ece t p s** **g ca** **pa g s**\n\n|ASN Name|IP Address|Domain|Citlab Seen|FakeM Custom|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|HOL-GR hellas online Electronic Communications S.A.,GR|5.54.19.17|drivgoogle.firewall- gateway.com|X||\n|IOMART-AS Iomart,GB|78.129.252.159|admin.spdns.org||X|\n|||firefox.spdns.de||X|\n|||intersecurity.firewall- gateway.com||X|\n|||kaspersky.firewall- gateway.net||X|\n|||kissecurity.firewall- gateway.net||X|\n|||opero.spdns.org||X|\n||87.117.229.109|detail43.myfirewall.org|X|X|\n||95.154.195.171|accountgoogle.firewall- gateway.com|X||\n|||accountsgoogle.firewall- gateway.com|X||\n|||accountsgoogles.firewall- gateway.net|X||\n|||filegoogle.firewall- gateway.com|X||\n|||firewallupdate.firewall- gateway.com|X||\n|||firewallupdate.firewall- gateway.net|X|X|\n|||googlefile.firewall- gateway.net|X||\n|||news.firewall- gateway.com|X|X|\n|||sys.firewall- gateway.net|X|X|\n||109.169.40.172|economy.spdns.de||X|\n|LGI-UPC Liberty Global Operations B.V.,AT|46.127.56.109|mail.firewall- gateway.com||X|\n\n\n**NEWMEDIAEXPRESS-AS-AP NewMedia Express Pte Ltd.

The IP address�**\n\n**95[.]154[.]195[.]171 that we saw previously was using Microsoft IIS web server version 6 and was configured to forbid�**\n\n**[access to the top level of the URL path. Using the search engine Shodan we scanned all servers on iomart that ran IIS 6 and forbid](https://www.shodan.io/)**\n\n**access to the root url path with the query:**\n\n\n**port:80 IIS/6.0 forbidden title:Error \"Content-Length: 218\" country:\"GB\" org:iomart**\n\n\n**For all the matched servers we sent a query to the URL path (/servicelogin/ojkiojr09.asp), which is used to redirect victims**\n\n**to destination content in the phish attacks. The purpose of this query was to to determine if any other servers would forward us to**\n\n**content in the same manner we had observed in the attacks.**\n\n**We found one other IP address (87[.]117[.]229[.]109) on iomart that responded to this query. We observed this server**\n\n**[responding with a redirect to an article by Radio Free Asia regarding the arrest of the aunt of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, a Tibetan](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/detained-07172015135210.html)**\n\n**monk who recently died while in a Chinese prison.**\n\n**We saw this content active from November 30, 2015 to December 3, 2015, when the forward link stopped working, which may mean**\n\n**that the campaign completed at this time.**\n\n**[We used PassiveTotal to identify which domains pointed to both IP addresses from March 2015 to December 2015 and saw an](http://passivetotal.org)**\n\n**overlap across three domains:**\n\n\n**sys[.]firewall-gateway[.]net**\n**news[.]firewall-gateway[.]com**\n**firewallupdate[.]firewall-gateway[.]net**\n\n\n**The domain: firewallupdate[.]firewall-gateway[.]net was referenced in the Palo Alto Network report and pointed to**\n\n**both the IPs we identified at different times (see Figure 6).�**\n\n**_Figure 6: Domain overlap between two iomart IPs in the phishing infrastructure._**\n\n**Additionally this new IP had two additional domains that were also using the Securepoint dynamic DNS service:**\n\n**updata[.]firewall-gateway[.]com and accounts-google[.]firewall-gateway[.]com. We saw one of the domains:�**\n\n**detail43[.]myfirewall[.]org used as a C2 server for an attack in the previously described Scarlet Mimic campaign from**\n\n**2014.**\n\n# Why the Shift to Phishing?\n\n**When Scarlet Mimic shifted tactics, they failed to properly compartmentalize their phishing and malware operations, relying on**\n\n**known C2 infrastructure for the new phishing campaigns. Although they tried different attack vectors they still fell back on old habits**\n\n**and resources that could be leveraged by analysts. Monitoring the infrastructure enabled us to track the campaigns over time and**\n\n**demonstrates the importance of infrastructure analysis for security researchers.**\n\n**The shift to phishing campaigns is significant, as Palo Alto Networks only observed document-based malware attacks.�[1]**\n\n**Importantly, Scarlet Mimic may be continuing to conduct as-yet unreported malware campaigns on other infrastructure. There are a**\n\n**number of potential explanations for this change.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**access to these networks than document-based malware.**\n\n**In addition, the promotion of behavioral changes in the Tibetan community and the use of document-sharing platforms such as**\n\n**Google Docs over email attachments may have put pressure on attackers’ tactics and led them to experiment with simpler, but**\n\n**[potentially effective vectors, such as phishing. In other attacks against the Tibetan community over the past year we have also seen](https://citizenlab.org/2015/06/targeted-attacks-against-tibetan-and-hong-kong-groups-exploiting-cve-2014-4114/)**\n\n**malware sent via Google Drive links in targeted emails. The Scarlet Mimic phishing campaigns add further evidence that attackers**\n\n**are attempting to leverage the wide use and trust of Google applications in the Tibetan community.**\n\n**It is also possible that the rising detections by antivirus products of Scarlet Mimic’s preferred malware toolkit play a role. Out of the**\n\n**[74 FakeM sample hashes provided in the Palo Alto Networks Scarlet Mimic report, 61 are available on VirusTotal. When the](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/)**\n\n**samples were first submitted to VirusTotal some had zero detections and an overall average detection rate of 38 percent. Following�**\n\n**the publication of the Palo Alto Networks report the average detection increased to 54 percent. The current average detection rate is**\n\n**71 percent, the highest is 80 percent (46 / 57 antivirus scanners), and the lowest is 51 percent (23 / 45 antivirus scanners). These**\n\n**current detection rates may make the malware that the attackers used in past attacks less reliable for successful infection. While the**\n\n**attackers could be pivoting to new, less detectable malware, simple phishing attacks may also involve less effort and achieve higher**\n\n**success against journalists and NGO targets.**\n\n**Finally, we cannot rule out that converting burned or low-utility command and control servers to phishing might also be**\n\n**intentional down-cycling of infrastructure, before it is discarded. Phishing, in other words, may be the last stop before domains and**\n\n**servers that are losing value are finally given up.�**\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**The Tibetan community has been targeted by sophisticated, persistent attackers for over a decade. Scarlet Mimic is just one of**\n\n**these attack groups, and over the years they have demonstrated deep familiarity and inside knowledge of the Tibetan groups they**\n\n**target. They have also shown themselves to be adaptable and responsive to changes in the security behaviors of their targets.**\n\n**Their most recent turn to phishing seems to reflect this adaptability (although we leave open the possibility that malware attacks are�**\n\n**continuing, using other infrastructure). A number of factors may have played a role in this transition, including an increase in certain**\n\n**security behaviors within the Tibetan community (such as not opening or sending attachments), and increasing rates of detection by**\n\n**antivirus products.**\n\n**The information targeted by this group is sensitive, and in the hands of a well-resourced adversary, such as the sponsor of Scarlet**\n\n**Mimic, could cause harm to the safety and security of individuals in Tibet. The extracted information could also be used in support of**\n\n**efforts to frustrate and isolate political groups in the Tibetan diaspora.**\n\n**Phishing relies on tricking users into entering credentials. In this case, there are several telltale signs (such as a slightly outdated**\n\n**Gmail login phishing page) that may suggest to potential victims that something is “not quite right.” However, there are also a**\n\n**number of tools and tactics available to users in the Tibetan community and beyond to stay safe online We describe several of these**\n\n**below.**\n\n# What Can Targeted Users Do?\n\n### Tools\n\n**Use two-factor authentication.

The message purported to�**\n\n**[contain a link to a document with information on a controversial Buddhist sect known as Dorje Shugden or Dolgyal, which has been](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorje_Shugden)**\n\n**involved in protests against the Dalai Lama.**\n\n**From: Choephel Tenzin <tenzinch128@gmail.com>**\n**Date: Mon, Nov 9, 2015**\n**Subject: Who is demonstrating against the Dalai Lama**\n**To: [Redacted] ​**\n**File regarding Dolgyal.**\n**Who is demonstrating** **against the Dalai Lama.doc**\n\n**The link “Who is demonstrating against the Dalai Lama.doc” actually goes to http://accountgoogle[.]firewall-**\n\n**gateway[.]com/servicclogin. When we first checked this link on November 13, the page was down and we therefore do not�**\n\n**know what the original destination content was for this attack.**\n\n### Destination Content Switch\n\n**On November 25 the link was active and the destination content was a public Google Drive folder that contained campaign**\n\n**materials on climate change from a Tibetan NGO. The climate change theme is significant, as during this period Tibetan�**\n\n**organizations were taking part in advocacy to raise awareness on climate change in Tibetan areas in anticipation of the United**\n\n**Nations Conference on Climate Change held in Paris, France from November 30 to December 12, 2015.**\n\n## Phishing Attack 2\n\n**The second phishing attack was sent to Tibetan journalists on November 22, 2015.**\n\n**In this case the email was made to appear to come from a Tibetan activist, describes a video on China and Tibet, and shares a link**\n\n**to what appears to be a video sharing site, but is actually**\n\n**http://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/serviclogin.**\n\n\n**From: Dorjee Tenzin <tenzinsft@gmail.com>**\n**Date: 22 Nov 2015**\n**Subject: How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – video**\n**To: [Redacted]**\n**This video – How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – is short and easy to understand. Must watch.**\n**http://www.downvids.net/how-china-takes-care-of-tibet-and-tibetans-595657.html**\n\n\n**On November 22, 2015, if users entered their credentials into the Google login phishing page they would be redirected to the video**\n\n**described in the email.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Destination Content Switch\n\n**On November 25, 2015, the destination content was changed to a website used to organize the Global Climate March**\n\n**(globalclimatemarch.org), a demonstration to raise climate change awareness around the United Nations Conference on**\n\n**Climate Change.**\n\n**The November 25, 2015 destination content change shares the timing and theme of the change we observed on the previous URL**\n\n**path variation. While we do not have additional phishing emails from this period, these commonalities suggest the attackers were**\n\n**sending phishing emails with climate change themes around November 25, 2015.**\n\n## Phishing Attack 3\n\n**On November 23, 2015, an email appearing to be from the Press Officer of the Central Tibetan Administration was sent to multiple�**\n\n**Tibetan journalists, activists, and NGO staff members.**\n\n\n**From: Tsering Wangchuk <euhrdesk.diir@gmail.com>**\n**Date: 23 Nov 2015**\n**Subject: Press Invitation**\n**To: [Redacted]**\n**Press Invitation**\n**The media is cordially invited by the Election Commission of the Central**\n**Tibetan Administration its press conference regarding the upcoming Sikyong**\n**and Tibetan final elections at Lhakpa Tsering hall, DIIR, on November 27, 2015, at 10:00 AM.�**\n**Press Invitation.pdfTsering Wangchuk**\n**Press Officer�**\n**+91 8679208465**\n**www.tibet.net**\n**Twitter: https://twitter.com/Pressofficerct�**\n**Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lhuabu**\n\n\n-----\n\n**23, when the email was sent, if the user entered their credentials into the phishing page they would be redirected to a Google Doc**\n\n**containing a copy of an op-ed written by the Central Tibetan Administration on climate change. The destination content and the**\n\n**email message do not match in this case, which may be evidence of the attackers neglecting to switch out content from a previous**\n\n**campaign.**\n\n### Destination Content Switch\n\n**On November 26, 2015, the destination content to which the phishing page redirected users was changed to a Google Drive**\n\n**document that provides the program for a visit to Dharamsala, India by Chilean Parliamentarians.**\n\n# Appendix B: Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Scarlet Mimic Malware Campaign 1\n\n**Binaries**\n\n**MD5: fef27f432e0ae8218143bc410fda340e**\n\n**Command and Control Servers**\n\n**news.firewall-gateway[.]com**\n\n### Scarlet Mimic Malware Campaign 2\n\n Attack 1\n\n**File attachments**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Binaries**\n\n**Filename:** **cghnt.exe**\n\n**MD5:** **1bf438b5744db73eea58379a3b9f30e5**\n\n**Filename: iph.bat**\n\n**MD5: d2e9412428c3bcf3ec98dba8a78adb7b**\n\n**Command and Control Servers**\n\n**detail43[.]myfirewall[.]org**\n\n### Attack 2\n\n**File attachments**\n\n**Filenames:** **Reappraisal_of_India_Tibet_Policy.doc**\n\n**Genuine autonomy or complete independance.doc**\n\n**Application for Mentee.doc**\n\n**MD5:** **7735e571d0450e2a31e97e4f8e0f66fa**\n\n**Binaries**\n\n**Filename:** **uroyh.exe**\n\n**MD5:** **ea45265fe98b25e719d5a9cc3b412d66**\n\n**Filename:** **uroyh-unpacked.exe**\n\n**MD5:** **5c030802ad411fea059cc9cc4c118125**\n\n**Command and Control Servers**\n\n**sys[.]firewall-gateway[.]net**\n\n### Phishing Campaign Infrastructure\n\n**filegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com**\n\n**accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com**\n\n**detail43[.]myfirewall[.]org**\n\n**http://filegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicelogin**\n\n**http://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/serviclogin**\n\n**http://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicclogin**\n\n### Post a Comment\n\n**Your email is never shared.
