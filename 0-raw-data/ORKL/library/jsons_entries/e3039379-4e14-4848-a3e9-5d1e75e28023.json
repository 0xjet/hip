At eSentire, our 24/7 SOCs are staffed with Elite Threat](https://www.esentire.com/what-we-do/security-operations-center)\nHunters and Cyber Analysts who hunt, investigate, contain and respond to threats within minutes.\n\nWe have discovered some of the most dangerous threats and nation state attacks in our space –\nincluding the Kaseya MSP breach and the more_eggs malware.\n\nOur Security Operations Centers are supported with Threat Intelligence, Tactical Threat Response and\nAdvanced Threat Analytics driven by our Threat Response Unit – the TRU team.\n\nIn TRU Positives, eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) provides a summary of a recent threat\ninvestigation. We outline how we responded to the confirmed threat and what recommendations we\nhave going forward.\n\n**Here’s the latest from our TRU Team…**\n\n## What did we find?\n\n[Remcos (Remote Control & Surveillance Software) was identified in a customer environment in](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.remcos)\nthe legal services industry.\nRemcos is a malicious remote access tool (RAT) marketed as a legitimate remote administration\ntool which can be purchased for between €58-399.\n\nThe tool can be used to control the system, capture keystrokes, webcam images, screen\ncaptures, and passwords (among other capabilities).\nVersion 3.3.2 Pro was identified in this incident.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe infection vector for Remcos was a password protected, macro-enabled Excel file named\n[“remittance advice.xlsm”.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/abf8ada022fce92c24e0aead4f1b1ae8991002130bbbc4335f3381972683b400)\n\n[Once opened, PowerShell is executed to retrieve a remote script (edi.vbs/firewall.vbs) from](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/50f2ff7d96392fcfe6ed57a1ff71ae9c87a1346ff3694173a255b67e9ff8a208/detection)\n**hxxp://lbl[.]support.**\nThe script fetches additional components, enables persistence via registry run key and\nultimately executes Remcos within a legitimate Windows process.\n\n_Figure 1 Online purchasing form for Remcos_\n\n_Figure 2 Process tree showing execution stages_\n\n## How did we find it?\n\nBlueSteel, our machine-learning powered PowerShell classifier, identified PowerShell commands\nexecuted by Remcos RAT\nMDR for Endpoint identified secondary execution phases.\n\n## What did we do?\n\nOur team of [24/7 SOC Cyber Analysts isolated the host and worked with the customer to](https://www.esentire.com/what-we-do/security-operations-center)\nremediate.\n\n\n-----\n\n## What can you learn from this TRU positive?\n\nRemcos provides an attacker with nearly full control of the compromised system, so rapid\nidentification and removal is critical.\nRemcos stores captured information in the following files and folders:\n\n%APPDATA%\\rem\\logs.dat (captured keystrokes)\n%APPDATA%\\Screenshots\n%APPDATA%\\MicRecords\nUnfortunately, antivirus detection for the macro-enabled Excel document is minimal since\npassword protected documents can be used to evade link and attachment inspection.\n\n[As of January 18th, 2022 only two vendors have identified it on VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/abf8ada022fce92c24e0aead4f1b1ae8991002130bbbc4335f3381972683b400/detection)\n\n## Recommendations from our Threat Response Unit (TRU) Team:\n\nEmploy email filtering and protection measures.\n\nBlock or quarantine email attachments such as EXEs, Password Protected ZIPs, Javascript,\nand VisualBasic scripts.\nImplement anti-spoofing measures such as DMARC and SPF.\nEmploy an MFA solution to reduce impact of compromised credentials.\nTrain users to identify and report suspicious emails.\nProtect endpoints against malware\n\nEnsure antivirus signatures are up-to-date.\nUse a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product to detect\nand contain threats.\nLimit or disable macros across the organization. See UK's [National Cyber Centre guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/macro-security-for-microsoft-office)\non Macro Security.\n\n## Ask Yourself…\n\nCan my team prevent emails containing encrypted malicious documents from reaching users?\nDoes my team have endpoint monitoring in place to identify malicious documents which bypass\nemail controls?\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n|Type|Value|Note|\n|---|---|---|\n|File (SHA256)|50f2ff7d96392fcfe6ed57a1ff71ae9c87a1346ff3694173a255b67e9ff8a208|firewall.vbs|\n|File (SHA256)|abf8ada022fce92c24e0aead4f1b1ae8991002130bbbc4335f3381972683b400|Remittance Advice.xlsm|\n|Domain|eter101[.]dvrlists[.]com|Remcos C2|\n|Domain|eter103[.]dvrlists[.]com|Remcos C2|\n\n\n-----\n\nDomain lbl[.]support Hosts\nfirewall.vbs\nand other\ncomponents\nused during\nexecution\n\nIf you’re not currently engaged with a Managed Detection and Response provider, we highly\nrecommend you partner with us for security services in order to disrupt threats before they impact your\nbusiness.\n\n[Want to learn more?
