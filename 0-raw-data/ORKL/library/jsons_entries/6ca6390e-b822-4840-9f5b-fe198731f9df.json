Components of TG4127 operations have been reported under the names APT28, Sofacy, Sednit, and Pawn Storm. CTU™ researchers\n[assess with moderate confidence that the group is operating from the Russian Federation and is gathering](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign#appendix)\nintelligence on behalf of the Russian government.\n\n[Between October 2015 and May 2016, CTU researchers analyzed 8,909 Bitly links that targeted 3,907 individual](https://bitly.com/)\nGmail accounts and corporate and organizational email accounts that use Gmail as a service. In March 2016, CTU\nresearchers identified a spearphishing campaign using Bitly accounts to shorten malicious URLs. The targets were\nsimilar to a 2015 TG-4127 campaign — individuals in Russia and the former Soviet states, current and former\nmilitary and government personnel in the U.S. and Europe, individuals working in the defense and government\nsupply chain, and authors and journalists — but also included email accounts linked to the November 2016 United\nStates presidential election. Specific targets include staff working for or associated with Hillary Clinton's presidential\ncampaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), including individuals managing Clinton's\ncommunications, travel, campaign finances, and advising her on policy.\n\n## Spearphishing details\n\nThe short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate\nGoogle domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL,\nprepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can\nestablish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session\nalive and maintain persistent access.\n\n### Hillary for America\n\nThe Hillary for America presidential campaign owns the hillaryclinton.com domain, which is used for the campaign\nwebsite (www.hillaryclinton.com) and for email addresses used by campaign staff. An examination of the\nhillaryclinton.com DNS records shows that the domain's MX records, which indicate the mail server used by the\n[domain, point to aspmx.l.google.com, the mail server used by Google Apps. Google Apps allows organizations to](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33915?hl=en)\nuse Gmail as their organizational mail solution.\n\nTG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation\nof the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page\n(see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account.\n\nFig re 1 E ample of a TG 4127 fake Google Acco nt login page (So rce phishtank com)\n\n\n-----\n\nMarch 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108\nemail addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the\nowners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses,\nsuggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity.\n\nThe identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending\nfrom senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures\nmanaged communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures\narranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles:\n\nNational political director\n\nFinance director\n\nDirector of strategic communications\n\nDirector of scheduling\n\nDirector of travel\n\nTraveling press secretary\n\nTravel coordinator\n\nPublicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a\nspearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been\nclicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three\ntimes, and two were clicked four times.\n\n### Democratic National Committee\n\nThe U.S. Democratic party's governing body, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), uses the dnc.org domain\nfor its staff email. Between mid-March and mid-April 2016, TG-4127 created 16 short links targeting nine dnc.org\nemail accounts. CTU researchers identified the owners of three of these accounts; two belonged to the DNC's\nsecretary emeritus, and one belonged to the communications director. Four of the 16 short links were clicked, three\nby the senior staff members. As of this publication, dnc.org does not use the Google Apps Gmail email service.\nHowever, because dnc.org email accounts were targeted in the same way as hillaryclinton.com accounts, it is likely\nthat dnc.org did use Gmail at that time and later moved to a different service.\n\nCTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network\n[compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/14/politics/democratic-national-committee-breach-russians-donald-trump/)\nthat TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network.\n\n### Personal email accounts\n\nCTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the\nHillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a\nhillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications,\nmedia, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy\ndirector office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40\nof the links have been clicked at least once.\n\n## Related activity and implications\n\n\n-----\n\nsuggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also\n[reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36284447)\nparty. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S.\nRepublican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and\nmid-May: Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich. However, the following email\ndomains do not use Google mail servers and may have been targeted by other means:\n\ngop.com — used by the Republican National Committee\n\ndonaldjtrump.com — used by the Donald Trump campaign\n\njohnkasich.com — used by the John Kasich campaign\n\nAccess to targets' Google accounts allows TG-4127 to review internal emails and potentially access other Google\nApps services used by these organizations, such as Google Drive. In addition to the value of the intelligence, the\nthreat actors could also exploit this access for other malicious activity, such as generating spearphishing emails from\ninternal email addresses to compromise the organizations' networks with malware.\n\nThe Russian government views the U.S. as a strategic rival and is known to task its intelligence agencies with\ngathering confidential information about individuals and organizations close to the center of power in the U.S.\nIndividuals working for the Hillary for America campaign could have information about proposed policies for a Clinton\npresidency, including foreign-policy positions, which would be valuable to the Russian government. Information\nabout travel plans and campaign scheduling could provide short-term opportunities for other intelligence operations.\nLong-term access to email accounts of senior campaign advisors, who may be appointed to staff positions in a\nClinton administration, could provide TG-4127 and the Russian government with access to those individual's\naccounts.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile TG-4127 continues to primarily threaten organizations and individuals operating in Russia and former Soviet\nstates, this campaign illustrates its willingness to expand its scope to other targets that have intelligence of interest\nto the Russian government. Non-governmental political organizations may provide access to desirable national\npolicy information, especially foreign policy, but may not have the same level of protection and security as\ngovernmental organizations. Targeting individuals linked to presidential campaigns could represent an intelligence\n‘long game,' as establishing access to potential U.S. administration staff before they are appointed could be easier\nthan targeting them when they are established in the White House. Access to an individual's personal or corporate\nemail account provides a substantial amount of useful intelligence, and threat actors could also leverage the access\nto launch additional attacks to penetrate the network of an associated organization.\n\nUsers rarely check the full URL associated with short links, so threat groups can use URL-shortening services to\neffectively hide malicious URLs. Threat actors can use the services' detailed statistics about which links were\nclicked when, and from what location, to track the success of a spearphishing campaign. A single compromised\naccount could allow TG-4127 to achieve its operational goals. CTU researchers recommend that clients take\nappropriate precautions to minimize the risk of these types of attacks:\n\nEducate users about the risks of spearphishing emails.\n\nUse caution and exercise due diligence when faced with a shortened link, especially in unsolicited email\nmessages. Pasting Bitly URLs, appended with a plus sign, into the address bar of a web browser reveals the\nfull URL.\n\nFor clients using Gmail as a corporate mail solution, educate users about the risk of spoofed login pages and\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix — Gauging confidence level\n\nCTU researchers have adopted the grading system published by the U.S. Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence to indicate confidence in their assessments:\n\n**High confidence generally indicates that judgments are based on high-quality information, and/or that the**\nnature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid judgment. A \"high confidence\" judgment is not a fact or\na certainty, however, and such judgments still carry a risk of being wrong.\n\n**Moderate confidence generally means that the information is credibly sourced and plausible but not of**\nsufficient quality or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence.\n\n**Low confidence generally means that the information's credibility and/or plausibility is questionable, or that**\nthe information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated to make solid analytic inferences, or that [there are]\nsignificant concerns or problems with the sources.\n\n**[1] The SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) research team tracks threat groups by assigning them four-digit**\nrandomized numbers (4127 in this case), and compiles information from external sources and from first-hand\nincident response observations.\n\n\n-----",
