The decoy documents and filenames used in the attacks suggest the intended targets\ninclude organisations with political interests or influence in Israel and Palestine. Although we are unable\nto link this campaign to any already documented in open source, it bears similarities to some described\n\nby others previously[1][,][[2]].\n\nThe earliest samples in the campaign we have identified date back to the summer of 2014. The number\nof samples discovered and relatively small scale of infrastructure suggest the attackers have limited\nresources with which to conduct attacks.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nOur investigation begins by taking a look at the following file:\necc240f1983007177bc5bbecba50eea27b80fd3d14fd261bef6cda10b8ffe1e9. According to the analysis\npublished on malwr.com[3], this file was originally named ‘Israel Homeland Defense Directory 2015\n_Secured_.exe’ and, once executed, the following decoy document was presented:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial file in this case is a self­extracting RAR file that contains three components, including a decoy\ndocument (in this case, the PDF shown above) and the malware.\n\nFurther inspection of the malware extracted showed it wasn’t a family our analysts recognised. This,\ncoupled with the nature of the decoy document used, led us to take a more in depth look at the malware,\nand associated infrastructure.\n\n_We’d like to give special thanks to Eyal Sela of ClearSky Security for his collaborative efforts in this_\n_research._\n\n**Delivery**\n\nThe most common way this malware packaged is via a self­extracting RAR file; however the attackers\nalso appear to have used a number of other solutions to drop their malware, including a Visual Basic\nbased wrapper and an Auto­IT based wrapper.\n\nIn terms of how the malware is delivered, it’s most likely that it’s done via spearphishing. For example,\nthere are also several occasions where the VirusTotal ‘ITW’ tab suggests that the original dropper was\n\navailable to download on a 3[rd] party website. In the case of the sample discussed in the introduction we\ncan see:\n\n\n-----\n\nlow key file sharing sites appears to be a feature of the campaign as far as we can tell, with a few other\nsimilar sites being used in the same way.\n\nThis, in conjunction with the nature of the related files we have discovered (all of them are directly\nexecutable files) means it is likely that the malware is primarily delivered via spear phishing attempts,\nrather than any other method.\n\n**DownExecute – Brief Analysis**\n\nIn this analysis, we’ll go over the file with a SHA256 hash of\necc240f1983007177bc5bbecba50eea27b80fd3d14fd261bef6cda10b8ffe1e9.\n\nWe’ve chosen to refer to the malware as ‘DownExecute’ due to the .pdb string left in the malware\n(leaving debug paths in malware seems to be very fashionable at the moment…):\n\n[All variants of the DownExecute’ malware we’ve identified come packaged in the following fashion:](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/04/attacks-against-israeli-palestinian-interests.html#_ftn4)\n\nFrom the samples we have analysed so far, the decoy application included is never used by the binary,\nand is presumably included so that anyone taking a cursory look at the file will conclude it is in fact the\nreal deal. Whilst the cURL[4] binary included is used for internet connectivity but it’s currently unclear\nwhy the attackers chose to use this method of adding connectivity to their file.\n\nSome of the binaries are also self­signed:\n\n\n-----\n\nSo what can this malware do? Not all that much – it’s just a downloader.\n\nBefore execution, the malware makes a couple of checks to avoid analysis, including checking for the\npresence of a debugger using IsDebuggerPresent as well as checking for the presence of VirtualBox by\nlooking for the device name \\\\.\\VBoxMiniRdrDN:\n\nThe malware also checks for the presence of several anti­virus solutions, as well for any processes\nincluding the word ‘security’:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware then proceeds to decrypt some basic configuration data, including the command & control\n[domain, and information about the origin of the infection, tracked via ID:](http://pwc.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451623c69e201b7c7806358970b-pi)\n\nMeanwhile, the malware begins calling home, whilst also keeping a log of its actions in a plaintext file\nthat is created in the same folder as where the binary was executed from.\n\n\n-----\n\n**After successful compromise…**\n\nIt appears as though the clue for the main functionality of this malware is in its name (it downloads, and\nthen executes) files, as it offers little else for the attacker. The DownExecute malware is used as a way\nfor the attackers to gain an initial foothold on the victim machine. The basic information reported back by\nthe malware would also certainly allow the attacker a way to triage infections to ensure they had\nreached their intended victim rather than a researcher.\n\nWe don’t have great visibility into post­compromise activity at this stage; however there are a number of\nother malware samples which communicate with the same infrastructure as the DownExecute samples.\n\nIt’s not unreasonable to infer that if these are more fully featured backdoors, that they are likely the 2[nd]\n\nstage malware families used in conjunction with DownExecute. Specifically, we’ve observed the well­\ndocumented Xtreme RAT and Poison Ivy malware families in use with the same domain names as\nDownExecute. The Poison Ivy passwords observed for the group were ‘admin2014’ and ‘admin!@#$%”.\n\n**Command & Control Infrastructure**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe vast majority of infrastructure in terms of hostnames observed associated with these attacks have\nbeen dynamic DNS domains, primarily associated with no­ip.com. This provider is popular with several\nMiddle Eastern threat actors tracked by PwC’s intelligence team. In terms of the size of the infrastructure\nused in the campaign using the tools described, it’s also fairly small, as shown on our Maltego graph.\n\nThe attackers have made an unusual choice with respect to the hosting providers used for the malicious\ninfrastructure. Most of the domains at the time of writing, and indeed historically, have pointed to IP\naddress space owned by Host Sailor, geo­located in Belize. Many of the threat actors in the Middle East\nth t ’ f ili ith h t l l til IP h ti i t th f t th t th i f t t i lik l\n\n\n-----\n\n**Inferred Targeting**\n\nAs we have mentioned in a number of our other reports[5], attackers often use C&C domains which\ncontain phrases relevant to their targets so as to make them appear legitimate. With this in mind we\nperformed some simple analysis on the domain names used in this campaign to identify legitimate\norganisations being impersonated. For a full list of C&Cs used, please see Appendix B.\n\n**Domain name** **Legitimate Entity** **Description**\n\nRotter2.sytes.net rotter.net Israeli news outlet\n\nhaartezenglish.strangled.net haaretz.co.il Israeli news outlet\n\nwallanews.sytes.net walla.co.il Israeli news outlet\n\nynet.sytes.net ynet.co.il Israeli news outlet\n\nsafar.selfip.com Safar Islamic 2[nd] month\n\ndepka.sytes.net debka.com Israeli news outlet\n\nAs shown, there appears to be a theme here, with a number of Israeli news organisations being used as\nC&C themes and hence probably being targeted. So do we believe this campaign is focused only at\nIsraeli companies? Perhaps not entirely.\n\n**Targeting**\n\nWhilst there are a number of documents clearly aimed at Israeli nationals, using political and military\nthemes, one of the lures[6] included an Arabic language decoy document pictured below:\n\nThe document in question discusses an alleged leak of information relating to Abbas, leader of the\nPalestine Liberation Organization. Whilst this is a subject which is clearly of key interest to all parties in\nthe region the fact the attackers sent an Arabic language version of the story may indicate that the\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhilst, in this case, we’re unable to attribute this set of activity to a specific group or entity in the Middle\nEast, it does bear a significant resemblance to many attacks seen from the Middle East that have been\npreviously documented. Specifically, the following aspects of this campaign remind us of existing write­\nups on Middle Eastern campaigns:\n\n**Consistent use of the dynamic DNS provider no­ip.com and associated domains: it’s unclear**\n[why there is a preference for this, however in several ‘how­to’ videos on Arabic language](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/04/attacks-against-israeli-palestinian-interests.html#_ftn7)\nunderground forums the video creators recommend using no­ip.com as opposed to other dynamic\nDNS providers;\n**Use of publically available malware: many groups operating in the Middle East use malware**\nfamilies (such as Poison Ivy/Xtreme RAT) which are publically available rather than developing their\nown binaries;\n**Variety of targeting: the targeting seems entirely restricted to Middle Eastern issues and, whilst**\nthere appears to be a heavy focus on Israel in the decoy documents we’ve observed, there is the\npossibility that Palestinians have been targeted as well. This is consistent with the complex\nrelationships between the different nations and political groups in the region;\n\n[7]\n\n**Password schema: In their August 2013 blog**, FireEye noted that a group they refer to as\n\nMoleRats used Poison Ivy and Xtreme RAT, in conjunction with a password of “!@#GooD#@!” The\nkeyboard walk used for the symbols “!@#” across the top of a keyboard is similar to the password\nobserved in some of our Poison Ivy samples.\n\nThe fact that the attackers chose to develop their own dropper may be indicative that their biggest\nproblem when conducting network intrusions is getting their foot in the door – particularly as it seems as\n\nthough they still prefer the more fully featured Poison Ivy and Xtreme RAT backdoors as 2[nd] stage\nmalware families.\n\nWhen we pivoted and looked for the earliest examples of the DownExecute malware, the first samples\nwe could find were compiled in June 2014. We have no reason to believe in this case that the threat\nactor has tampered with the compile time on any samples, as all other samples discovered were\nidentified shortly after they were compiled. As such we believe the campaign using this downloader\nmalware has been on­going for approximately 12 months.\n\n**Appendix A –
