This new RAT was found on victims that had been initially\ncompromised through the exploitation of publicly exposed VMware Horizon platforms. While\n[being a relatively simple RAT capability-wise, it was built with recourse to the Qt Framework,](https://www.qt.io/)\nwith the sole intent of making human analysis harder, and automated detection through\nmachine learning and heuristics less likely.\n\nWe have also found evidence to suggest that once MagicRAT is deployed on infected\nsystems, it launches additional payloads such as custom-built port scanners. Additionally,\nwe've found that MagicRAT's C2 infrastructure was also used to host newer variants of\n[known Lazarus implants such as TigerRAT.](https://www.boho.or.kr/krcert/publicationView.do?bulletin_writing_sequence%3D36276)\n\nThe discovery of MagicRAT in the wild is an indication of Lazarus' motivations to rapidly build\nnew, bespoke malware to use along with their previously known malware such as TigerRAT\nto target organizations worldwide.\n\n## Actor profile\n\n Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nCisco Talos assesses with moderate to high confidence these attacks have been conducted\nby the North Korean state-sponsored threat actor Lazarus Group. This attribution is based on\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), malware implants and infrastructure overlap with\nknown Lazarus campaigns.\n\nWe have observed overlaps in C2 servers serving MagicRAT and [previously disclosed](https://asec.ahnlab.com/ko/34107/)\nLazarus campaigns utilizing the Dtrack RAT family. Furthermore, Talos has also discovered\n[C2 servers hosting and serving TigerRAT to existing MagicRAT infections. TigerRAT is a](https://www.boho.or.kr/krcert/publicationView.do?bulletin_writing_sequence%3D36276)\nmalware family attributed to the Lazarus APT groups by the Korean Internet & Security\n[Agency (KISA).](https://www.boho.or.kr/krcert/publicationView.do?bulletin_writing_sequence=36276)\n\nIn some infections, we observed the deployment of MagicRAT by the attackers for some\ntime, followed by its removal and the subsequent download and execution of another\ncustom-developed malware called \"VSingle,\" another implant disclosed and attributed to\nLazarus by [JPCERT.](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2021/03/Lazarus_malware3.html)\n\n## Technical analysis\n\n### MagicRAT\n\nMagicRAT is programmed in C++ programming language and uses the Qt Framework by\nstatically linking it to the RAT on 32- and 64-bit versions. The Qt Framework is a\nprogramming library for developing graphical user interfaces, of which this RAT has none.\nTalos believes that the objective was to increase the complexity of the code, thus making\nhuman analysis harder. On the other hand, since there are very few examples (if any) of\nmalware programmed with Qt Framework, this also makes machine learning and heuristic\nanalysis detection less reliable.\n\nThe 32-bit version was compiled with GCC v3.4 using mingw/cygwin for support on the\nMicrosoft Windows platform, the 64-bit version, however, was compiled with VisualC64,\nversion 7.14.\n\nThe RAT uses the Qt classes throughout its entire code. The configuration is dynamically\n[stored in a QSettings class eventually being saved to disk, a typical functionality provided by](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qsettings.html)\nthat class.\n\nThe malware configuration (containing author-defined QSettings) is stored in the file\n\n\n-----\n\nvisual.1991-06.com.microsoft_sd.kit in the path \\ProgramData\\WindowsSoftwareToolkit names and paths obviously chosen to trick the victim into believing they were part of the\noperating system.\n\nThe image below shows an example of a configuration file. During our analysis, we identified\nthree sections in the configuration file:\n\n**[os] which contains the command and control (C2) URLs.**\n\n**[General] which holds general information.**\n\n**[company] which holds data used in the communication with the C2.**\n\nAll analyzed samples had three encoded C2 URLs that are used to register infections and\nthen receive commands to execute on the infected endpoint. The URLs are stored in the\nconfiguration file with the keys \"windows\", \"linux\" and \"mac.\" The values are prefixed with\n\"LR02DPt22R\" followed by the URL encoded in base64.\n\nUpon execution, MagicRAT achieves persistence for itself by executing a hardcoded\ncommand that creates scheduled tasks on the victim machine.\n\n**Command** **Intent**\n\n\nschtasks /create /tn \"OneDrive AutoRemove\" /tr\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c del /f /q\nC:/TEMP/[MagicRAT_file_name].exe\" /sc daily /st 10:30:30 /ru\nSYSTEM\n\nschtasks /create /tn \"Microsoft\\Windows\\light Service Manager\"\n/tr C:/TEMP/[MagicRAT_file_name].exe /sc onstart /ru SYSTEM\n\n\nScheduled task starting\nat a specific time\n\n[[T1053/005]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/)\n\nScheduled task starting\nat a different time an\n[path [T1053/005]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Intent**\n\n\n%HOME%/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start\nMenu/Programs/Startup/OneNote.lnk\n\nUpon achieving persistence, the RAT contacts the C2.\n\n\nLink created on startup\n[folder [T1547/001]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\n\n\nDuring the initial stages of execution, MagicRAT will perform just enough system\nreconnaissance to identify the system and environment in which the attackers are operating.\nThis is done by executing the commands whoami, systeminfo and ipconfig /all. The last\ncommand has its results returned via the upload of the file zero_dump.mix to the C2.\n\nMagicRAT is rather simple — it provides the operator with a remote shell on the victim's\nsystem for arbitrary command execution, along with the ability to rename, move and delete\nfiles on the endpoint. The operator can determine the timing for the implant to sleep, change\nthe C2 URLs and delete the implant from the infected system.\n\nWe also discovered a new variant of MagicRAT in the wild generated in April 2022. This\nsample now consisted of the ability to delete itself from the infected endpoint using a BAT\nfile.\n\n## Additional malware\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the C2 servers used by the new MagicRAT sample, 64[.]188[.]27[.]73, hosted two\nmore distinct implants masquerading as GIF URLs. Now, MagicRAT can make requests to its\nC2 and download a GIF file, which is actually an executable.\n\n### Lightweight port scanner\n\nOne of the GIF files discovered on the MagicRAT C2 is called \"pct.gif,\" which is an extremely\nsimple port scanner, whose main code fits into the image below.\n\nIt takes three arguments: The IP to connect to, followed by the port number and, finally, a\nvalue dictating whether the output of the port scan must be written to a log file on disk or the\n\n\n-----\n\nstandard output. After a successful connection, the executable will either write the string\n\"Connection success!\" to the standard output or to a log file called \"Ahnupdate.log\" located in\nthe current user's temporary directory.\n\n### TigerRAT\n\nThe second implant hosted on MagicRAT's C2 is a remote access trojan (RAT) known as\n[TigerRAT. TigerRAT is an implant disclosed in 2021 by KISA and KRCERT as part of](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.tiger_rat)\n\"Operation ByteTiger'' detailing TigerRAT and its downloader \"TigerDownloader.\"\n\nThis implant consists of several RAT capabilities, ranging from arbitrary command execution\nto file management. Capabilities of the implant include:\n\nGather system information: username, computer name, network interface info, system\ninfo including product and version.\n\nRun arbitrary commands on the endpoint: set/get CWD, run command via cmd.exe\n\nImplant capability to run arbitrary commands.\n\nScreen capture.\n\n\n-----\n\nSocks tunneling.\nKeylogging.\nFile Management: drive reconnaissance, enumerate/delete files, create and write to\nfiles, read files and upload contents to C2, create processes,\nSelf delete/uninstall from system.\n\nThe latest TigerRAT versions included one new capability with indicators of a second\ncapability set to be introduced soon. One of these capabilities is called \"USB dump.\" The\nauthors have also created skeleton code in preparation for implementing video capture from\nWeb cameras, though it hasn't been implemented yet.\n\n**USB Dump**\n\nThe USB Dump capability gives the attackers the ability to:\n\nEnumerate files for path \"LOCAL_APPDATA\\GDIFONTC\".\nDelete files.\nFind files of specific extensions in a specified drive and folder: .docx, .hwp, .doc, .txt,\n.pdf, .zip, .zoo, .arc, .lzh, .arj, .gz, .tgz. Add these files to an existing archive - in\npreparation for exfiltration. This is the main functionality of this new capability.\n\nThe image below shows the code used to check the file extensions.\n\n\n-----\n\nLazarus' implants commonly stitch together functionalities, including occasionally removing\nand adding different functions, which is evident from the latest TigerRAT samples:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Lazarus added a new capability (USB dumping and skeleton code for Webcam\ncapture) they removed the port forwarding capability in the latest version. Older variants of\nTigerRAT (seen in 2020-2021) consisted of encrypted strings but the latest variant consists\nof strings in plaintext.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
