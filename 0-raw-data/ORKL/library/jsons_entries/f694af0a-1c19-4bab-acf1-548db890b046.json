It also enumerates the following\nregistry keys:\n\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\services\\\\eventlog\n\nSOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\WINEVT\\\\Channels\n\nIt uses the APIs \"EvtOpenLog\" and \"EvtClearLog\" to delete the logs and deletes the WMI\nactivity logs from the event source \"Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity\".\n\n## VSS Copying Tool\n\nThe Play ransomware gang was also recently observed using another .NET executable,\nwhich was also developed with the Costura tool.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Costura embeds the library AlphaVSS into executables. The AlphaVSS library is a.NET](https://github.com/alphaleonis/AlphaVSS)\nframework that provides a high-level interface for interacting with VSS. The library makes it\neasier for .NET programs to interface with VSS by offering a set of controlled APIs.\nDevelopers can use these APIs to generate, manage, and delete shadow copies, as well as\naccess information about existing shadow copies such as size and status.\n\nThe tool created by the Play ransomware operators uses AlphaVSS to copy files from VSS\nsnapshots. The tool enumerates the files and folders in a VSS snapshot and copies them to\na destination directory. The tool allows the attackers to copy files from VSS volumes on\ncompromised machines prior to encryption. This allows the threat actors to copy files that\nwould normally be locked by the operating system.\n\n## Play Ransomware Background\n\nPlay ransomware (also known as PlayCrypt), which is developed by a group Symantec\ntracks as Balloonfly, was launched in June 2022, and since then has been responsible for\nmultiple high-profile attacks. Like most ransomware groups now, Play carries out doubleextortion attacks, where the attackers exfiltrate data from victim networks before encrypting\nthem. While the ransomware gang had an initial focus on organizations in Latin America,\nespecially Brazil, it soon widened its targeting.\n\n[Play is known for targeting Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-41080,](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41080) CVE-202241082), as well as other flaws, to gain remote code execution (RCE) and infiltrate victim\nnetworks. The group was also one of the first ransomware groups to employ intermittent\nencryption, a technique that allows for faster encryption of victims’ systems. The tactic\nconsists of encrypting only parts of the targeted files' content, which would still render the\ndata unrecoverable.\n\nPlay is also notable as it doesn’t appear to operate as a ransomware-as-a-service, with\nBalloonfly seemingly carrying out the ransomware attacks as well as developing the\nmalware.\n\n## Use of Custom Tools on the Rise\n\nCustom tools are increasingly being used by ransomware gangs in their attacks. This is likely\ndue to a number of reasons, such as making attacks more efficient and reducing dwell time.\nCustom tools can be tailored to a specific target environment, allowing ransomware gangs to\ncarry out attacks faster and more efficiently. The use of proprietary tools also gives\nransomware operators more control over their operations. If a tool is widely available, it can\nbe reverse-engineered or adapted by other attackers, potentially weakening the initial\nattack's effectiveness. By keeping their tools proprietary and exclusive, ransomware gangs\ncan maintain their competitive advantage and maximize their profits.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Protection\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nIf an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect\nand block that file.\n\n**SHA256**\n\n762bb8a7209da29afb89f7941ae1c00a04cf45a144c6c5dddcfa78ff0d941539 – Play\nransomware\n\n86e4e23f9686b129bfb2f452acb16a4c0fda73cf2bf5e93751dcf58860c6598c – SystemBC\nmalware\n\nf706bae95a232402488d17016ecc11ebe24a8b6cb9f10ad0fa5cbac0f174d2e7 – SystemBC\nmalware\n\nc59f3c8d61d940b56436c14bc148c1fe98862921b8f7bad97fbc96b31d71193c –\nInfostealer.Grixba\n\n453257c3494addafb39cb6815862403e827947a1e7737eb8168cd10522465deb –\nInfostealer.Grixba\n\nf71476f9adec70acc47a911a0cd1d6fea1f85469aa16f5873dd3ffd5146ccd6b –\nInfostealer.Grixba\n\na8a7fdbbc688029c0d97bf836da9ece926a85e78986d0e1ebd9b3467b3a72258 – NetScan\n\n5ef9844903e8d596ac03cc000b69bbbe45249eea02d9678b38c07f49e4c1ec46 – NetScan\n\nf81bd2ac937ed9e254e8b3b003cc35e010800cbbce4d760f5013ff911f01d4f9 – VSS copying\ntool\n\n367d47ad48822caeedf73ce9f26a3a92db6f9f2eb18ee6d650806959b6d7d0a2 – WinRAR\n\n6f95f7f53b3b6537aeb7c5f0025dbca5e88e6131b7453cfb4ee4d1f11eeaebfc – WinSCP\n\n1409e010675bf4a40db0a845b60db3aae5b302834e80adeec884aebc55eccbf7 – PsExec\n\n**Network**\n\n137.220[.]49.66 – SystemBC C&C\n\njusticeukraine.com – SystemBC C&C\n\n\n-----",
