    "plain_text": "In the past few weeks, we have received several reports of targeted attacks that exploited various\n\n[application vulnerabilities to infiltrate various organizations. Similar to the Safe Campaign, the campaigns](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hiding-in-plain-sight-a-new-apt-campaign/)\n\nwe noted went seemingly unnoticed and under the radar. The attackers orchestrating the campaign we call\n\nthe Siesta Campaign used multicomponent malware to target certain institutions that fall under the\n\nfollowing industries:\n\nConsumer goods and services\n\nEnergy\n\nFinance\n\nHealthcare\n\nMedia and telecommunications\n\nPublic administration\n\nSecurity and defense\n\nTransport and traffic\n\nThreat actors don’t always rely on complex attack vectors to infiltrate an organization’s network. Attackers\n\ncan also make use of basic social engineering techniques for their victims to take the bait, such as in our\n\ncase study below.\n\n**_The Siesta Campaign: A Case Study_**\n\nWe are currently investigating an incident that involved attackers sending out spear-phishing emails\n\naddressed to executives of an undisclosed company. These emails were sent from spoofed email addresses\n\nof personnel within the organization. Instead of using attachments and document exploits, this specific\n\ncampaign served their malware through a legitimate-looking file download link.\n\nTo lure the target into downloading the file, the attacker serves the archive under a URL path named after\n\nthe target organization’s name as cited below:\n\n_http://{malicious domain}/{organization name}/{legitimate archive name}.zip_\n\nThis archive contains an executable (TROJ_SLOTH) disguised as a PDF document. When executed, it\n\ndrops and opens a valid PDF file, which was most probably taken from the target organization’s website.\n\nAlong with this valid PDF file, another malicious component is also dropped and executed in the\n\nbackground.\n\nThis backdoor component is named google{BLOCKED}.exe. (Due to the ongoing investigation, we are\n\n\n-----\n\n_http://www.micro{BLOCKED}. com/index.html, which are its command-and-control (C&C) servers._\n\nTrend Micro identifies these samples as BKDR_SLOTH.B.\n\nAt this point, the malware begins waiting for additional commands from the attacker. The encrypted\n\ncommands that are accepted are:\n\nSleep:\n\nCommands the backdoor to sleep for specified number of minutes\n\nWe have received a sleep command of “sleep:120” during our analysis which means that the\n\nmalware will wait for 2hrs before establishing a connection again to the C&C server\n\nDownload: <download_url>\n\nCommands the backdoor to download and execute a file (most probably another Win32\n\nexecutable) from a specified URL\n\nThe C&C servers used in this campaign are found to be newly registered and also short-lived, making it\n\ndifficult for us to track the malware’s behavior.\n\nBased on our research, we found 2 variants of the malware used in this campaign. Although not exactly\n\nalike, the behaviors are nearly identical.\n\nOne of the similar samples is a file named Questionaire Concerning the Spread of Superbugs February\n\n_2014.exe (SHA1: 014542eafb792b98196954373b3fd13e60cb94fe). This sample drops the file_\n\n_UIODsevr.exe, its backdoor component which behaves similarly as BKDR_SLOTH.B with the addition of_\n\ncommunicating to its C&C at skys{BLOCKED}com. These samples are identified by Trend Micro as\n\n[BKDR_SLOTH.A.](http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/us/malware/BKDR_SLOTH.A)\n\nBoth variants excessively use Sleep calls, which renders the malware dormant for varying periods of time,\n\nhence the campaign name “Siesta” (which means to take a short nap in Spanish). Commands are being\n\nserved through HTML pages using different keywords as listed below:\n\n**_Variant 1_**\n\n_prefix: “>SC<”_\n\n**_Variant 2_**\n\n_prefix: “longDesc=”_\n\n_suffix: “.txt”_\n\nListed below are the backdoor commands we were able to see from our analysis:\n\n\n-----\n\n_run1  open a remote shell_\n\n_“run2” – pipe shell commands from URL1_\n\n_“run3” – pipe shell commands from URL2_\n\n_“http” – pipe shell commands from C2_\n\n_“x_” – sleep for specified number of minutes_\n\n**_Variant 2_**\n\n_“sleep:” – sleep for specified number of minutes_\n\n_“download:” – download and execute another executable from C2_\n\n**_Attribution_**\n\nAttribution of campaigns and attack methods can often be difficult. We were able to identify this new\n\ncampaign through inspecting hashes, C&Cs, registrants, commands, and additional information.\n\n_Figure 1. Attribution Graph (click the thumbnail for full view)_\n\nDuring the course of our investigation into this new campaign, we investigated the malware dropped. We\n\nquickly noticed the registrant of sky{BLOCKED}.com is also the same registrant as\n\n\n-----\n\nan email address of xiaomao{BLOCKED}@163.com. This individual also recently registered 79 additional\n\ndomains. There are a total of roughly 17,000 domains registered with this same email address.\n\n_Figure 2. Domains registered under the name Li Ning, based on Whois data_\n\n**_Conclusion_**\n\nEarly detection is crucial in preventing targeted attacks from exfiltrating confidential company data.\n\nOrganizations and large enterprises need an advanced threat protection platform like Trend Micro™ Deep\n\nDiscovery, which can mitigate the risks posed by targeted attacks through its various security technologies\n\nand global threat intelligence. At the heart of our Custom Defense solution is Deep Discovery which\n\nprovides real-time local and global intelligence across the attack life cycle. This can help IT administrators\n\nunderstand the nature of the attack they are dealing with.\n\nTrend Micro blocks all related threats, emails and URLs associated with these attacks. As always, we\n\nadvise users to exercise caution when opening emails and links.\n\n_With additional insights and analysis from Kervin Alintanahin, Dove Chiu, and Kyle Wilhoit._\n\n\n-----",
