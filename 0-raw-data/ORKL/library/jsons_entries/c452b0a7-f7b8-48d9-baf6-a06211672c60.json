In addition to this, some of the tools used share code similarities with malware\nused in historic attacks linked to a threat group known as Lazarus. The attacks can be traced\nback as far as October 2015, two months prior to the discovery of the failed attack in Vietnam,\nwhich was hitherto the earliest known incident.\n\nThe attack against the Bangladesh central bank triggered an alert by payments network\nSWIFT, after it was found the attackers had used malware to cover up evidence of fraudulent\n[transfers. SWIFT issued a further warning, saying that it had found evidence of malware being](https://www.swift.com/insights/press-releases/swift-customer-communication_customer-security-issues)\n\nd i t th b k i i il f hi Vi t ’ Ti Ph B k b tl\n\n|Symantec Security Response|Symantec Employee|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nyear. SWIFT concluded that the second attack indicates that a “wider and highly adaptive\ncampaign” is underway targeting banks.\n\nA third bank, Banco del Austro in Ecuador, was also reported to have lost $12 million to\nattackers using fraudulent SWIFT transactions. However, no details are currently known about\nthe tools used in this incident or if there are any links to the attacks in Asia.\n\n**Discovery of additional tools used by attackers**\nSymantec has identified three pieces of malware which were being used in limited targeted\n[attacks against the financial industry in South-East Asia: Backdoor.Fimlis, Backdoor.Fimlis.B,](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021219-3219-99)\n[and Backdoor.Contopee. At first, it was unclear what the motivation behind these attacks were,](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021515-4543-99)\n[however code sharing between Trojan.Banswift (used in the Bangladesh attack used to](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-042523-1230-99)\nmanipulate SWIFT transactions) and early variants of Backdoor.Contopee provided a\nconnection.\n\n[While analyzing samples of Trojan.Banswift, a distinct file wiping code was found. Some of the](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-042523-1230-99)\ndistinctive properties of the wiping code include:\n\nFunction takes two parameters: path of file to overwrite and number of iterations (max\nsix)\nIt will initially overwrite the last byte of the target file with 0x5F\nSix “control” bytes are supplied which dictate what bytes are used during the overwrite\nprocess\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Unique wiping code found in Trojan.Banswift and additional Lazarus tools_\n\nAlready this code looked fairly unique. What was even more interesting was that when we\nsearched for additional malware containing the exact combination of “control” bytes, an early\nvariant of Backdoor.Contopee and the “msoutc.exe” sample already discussed in the recent\nBAE blog analyzing the Bangladesh attack were also found.\n\nSymantec believes distinctive code shared between families and the fact that\nBackdoor.Contopee was being used in limited targeted attacks against financial institutions in\nthe region, means these tools can be attributed to the same group.\n\n**Historical attacks**\nBackdoor.Contopee has been previously used by attackers associated with a broad threat\n[group known as Lazarus. Lazarus has been linked to a string of aggressive attacks since 2009,](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/collaborative-operation-blockbuster-aims-send-lazarus-back-dead)\nlargely focused on targets in the US and South Korea. The group was linked\n[to Backdoor.Destover, a highly destructive Trojan that was the subject of an FBI warning after](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-120209-5631-99)\nit was used in an attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The FBI concluded that the\n[North Korean government was responsible for this attack](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation)\n\n\n-----\n\nthis year, which involved major security vendors sharing intelligence and resources in order to\nassist commercial and government organizations in protecting themselves against Lazarus. As\npart of the initiative, vendors are circulating malware signatures and other useful intelligence\nrelated to these attackers.\n\n**Ongoing danger**\nThe discovery of more attacks provides further evidence that the group involved is conducting\na wide campaign against financial targets in the region. While awareness of the threat posed\nby the group has now been raised, its initial success may prompt other attack groups to launch\nsimilar attacks. Banks and other financial institutions should remain vigilant.\n\n**Protection**\nSymantec and Norton products protect against these threats with the following detections:\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n\n-----",
