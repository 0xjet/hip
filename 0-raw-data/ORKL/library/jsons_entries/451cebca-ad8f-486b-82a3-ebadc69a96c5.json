Working with U.S. government partners, DHS, Treasury, and\nFBI identified malware and other indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by the North Korean\ngovernment in an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash-out scheme—referred to by the\nU.S. Government as “FASTCash.” The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by\nthe North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN\nCOBRA activity, visit [https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.](https://www.cisa.gov/hiddencobra)\n\nFBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using the IOCs listed in this report\nto maintain a presence on victims’ networks to enable network exploitation. DHS, FBI, and\nTreasury are distributing these IOCs to enable network defense and reduce exposure to\nNorth Korean government malicious cyber activity.\n\nThis TA also includes suggested response actions to the IOCs provided, recommended\nmitigation techniques, and information on reporting incidents. If users or administrators\ndetect activity associated with the malware families associated with FASTCash, they should\nimmediately flag it, report it to the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications\nIntegration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give it the highest\npriority for enhanced mitigation.\n\nNCCIC conducted analysis on 10 malware samples related to this activity and produced a\nMalware Analysis Report (MAR). MAR-10201537, HIDDEN COBRA FASTCash-Related\nMalware, examines the tactics, techniques, and procedures observed in the malware. Visit\nthe [MAR-10201537 page for the report and associated IOCs.](https://www.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-275A)\n\n## Description\n\nSince at least late 2016, HIDDEN COBRA actors have used FASTCash tactics to target\nbanks in Africa and Asia. At the time of this TA’s publication, the U.S. Government has not\nconfirmed any FASTCash incidents affecting institutions within the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\nFASTCash schemes remotely compromise payment switch application servers within banks\nto facilitate fraudulent transactions. The U.S. Government assesses that HIDDEN COBRA\nactors will continue to use FASTCash tactics to target retail payment systems vulnerable to\nremote exploitation.\n\nAccording to a trusted partner’s estimation, HIDDEN COBRA actors have stolen tens of\nmillions of dollars. In one incident in 2017, HIDDEN COBRA actors enabled cash to be\nsimultaneously withdrawn from ATMs located in over 30 different countries. In another\nincident in 2018, HIDDEN COBRA actors enabled cash to be simultaneously withdrawn from\nATMs in 23 different countries.\n\nHIDDEN COBRA actors target the retail payment system infrastructure within banks to\nenable fraudulent ATM cash withdrawals across national borders. HIDDEN COBRA actors\nhave configured and deployed malware on compromised switch application servers in order\nto intercept and reply to financial request messages with fraudulent but legitimate-looking\naffirmative response messages. Although the infection vector is unknown, all of the\ncompromised switch application servers were running unsupported IBM Advanced\nInteractive eXecutive (AIX) operating system versions beyond the end of their service pack\nsupport dates; there is no evidence HIDDEN COBRA actors successfully exploited the AIX\noperating system in these incidents.\n\nHIDDEN COBRA actors exploited the targeted systems by using their knowledge of\nInternational Standards Organization (ISO) 8583—the standard for financial transaction\nmessaging—and other tactics. HIDDEN COBRA actors most likely deployed ISO 8583\nlibraries on the targeted switch application servers. Malicious threat actors use these libraries\nto help interpret financial request messages and properly construct fraudulent financial\nresponse messages.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Anatomy of a FASTCash scheme\n\n\n-----\n\nA review of log files showed HIDDEN COBRA actors making typos and actively correcting\nerrors while configuring the targeted server for unauthorized activity. Based on analysis of\nthe affected systems, analysts believe that malware—used by HIDDEN COBRA actors and\nexplained in the Technical Details section below—inspected inbound financial request\nmessages for specific primary account numbers (PANs). The malware generated fraudulent\nfinancial response messages only for the request messages that matched the expected\nPANs. Most accounts used to initiate the transactions had minimal account activity or zero\nbalances.\n\nAnalysts believe HIDDEN COBRA actors blocked transaction messages to stop denial\nmessages from leaving the switch and used a `GenerateResponse*` function to approve\nthe transactions. These response messages were likely sent for specific PANs matched\nusing `CheckPan() verification (see figure 1 for additional details on` `CheckPan() ).`\n\n**Technical Details**\n\nHIDDEN COBRA actors used malicious Windows executable applications, command-line\nutility applications, and other files in the FASTCash campaign to perform transactions and\ninteract with financial systems, including the switch application server. The initial infection\nvector used to compromise victim networks is unknown; however, analysts surmise HIDDEN\nCOBRA actors used spear-phishing emails in targeted attacks against bank employees.\nHIDDEN COBRA actors likely used Windows-based malware to explore a bank’s network to\nidentify the payment switch application server. Although these threat actors used different\nmalware in each known incident, static analysis of malware samples indicates similarities in\nmalware capabilities and functionalities.\n\nHIDDEN COBRA actors likely used legitimate credentials to move laterally through a bank’s\nnetwork and to illicitly access the switch application server. This pattern suggests\ncompromised systems within a bank’s network were used to access and compromise the\ntargeted payment switch application server.\n\nUpon successful compromise of a bank’s payment switch application server, HIDDEN\nCOBRA actors likely injected malicious code into legitimate processes—using command-line\nutility applications on the payment switch application server—to enable fraudulent behavior\nby the system in response to what would otherwise be normal payment switch application\nserver activity. NCCIC collaborated with Symantec cybersecurity researchers to provide\n[additional context on existing analysis [1]. Malware samples analyzed included malicious AIX](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/fastcash-lazarus-atm-malware)\nexecutable files intended for a proprietary UNIX operating system developed by IBM. The\nAIX executable files were designed to inject malicious code into a currently running process.\nTwo of the AIX executable files are configured with an export function, which allows\nmalicious applications to perform transactions on financial systems using the ISO 8583\nstandard. See MAR-10201537 for details on the files used. Figure 1 depicts the pattern of\nfraudulent behavior.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring analysis of log files associated with known FASTCash incidents, analysts identified\nthe following commonalities:\n\nExecution of `.so` (shared object) commands using the following pattern:\n```\n   /tmp/.ICE-unix/e <PID> /tmp.ICE-unix/<filename>m.so <argument>\n\n```\nThe process identifier, filename, and argument varied between targeted\ninstitutions. The tmp directory typically contains the X Window System session\ninformation.\nExecution of the `.so command, which contained a similar, but slightly different,`\ncommand: `./sun <PID>/tmp/.ICE-unix/engine.so <argument>`\n\nThe file is named sun and runs out of the `/tmp/.ICE-unix directory .`\n\nAdditionally, both commands use either the `inject` (mode 0) or `eject` (mode 1)\nargument with the following ISO 8583 libraries:\n```\n   m.so [with argument “0” or “1”]\n   m1.so [with argument “0” or “1”]\n   m2.so [with argument “0” or “1”]\n   m3.so [with argument “0” or “1”]\n\n```\n**Detection and Response**\n\nNCCIC recommends administrators review bash history logs of all users with root privileges.\nAdministrators can find commands entered by users in the bash history logs; these would\nindicate the execution of malicious code on the switch application server. Administrators\nshould log and monitor all commands.\n\n[The U.S. Government recommends that network administrators review MAR-10201537 for](https://www.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-275A)\nIOCs related to the HIDDEN COBRA FASTCash campaign, identify whether any of the\nprovided IOCs fall within their organization’s network, and—if found—take necessary\nmeasures to remove the malware.\n\n## Impact\n\nA successful network intrusion can have severe impacts, particularly if the compromise\nbecomes public. Possible impacts to the affected organization include\n\nTemporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,\nDisruption to regular operations,\nFinancial costs to restore systems and files, and\nPotential harm to an organization’s reputation.\n\n## Solution\n\n**Mitigation Recommendations for Institutions with Retail Payment Systems**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Require Chip and Personal Identification Number Cryptogram Validation**\n\nImplement chip and Personal Identification Number (PIN) requirements for debit cards.\nValidate card-generated authorization request cryptograms.\nUse issuer-generated authorization response cryptograms for response messages.\nRequire card-generated authorization response cryptogram validation to verify\nlegitimate response messages.\n\n**Isolate Payment System Infrastructure**\n\nRequire two-factor authentication before any user can access the switch application\nserver.\nVerify that perimeter security controls prevent internet hosts from accessing the private\nnetwork infrastructure servicing your payment switch application server.\nVerify that perimeter security controls prevent all hosts outside of authorized endpoints\nfrom accessing your system.\n\n**Logically Segregate Operating Environments**\n\nUse firewalls to divide operating environments into enclaves.\nUse Access Control Lists (ACLs) to permit or deny specific traffic from flowing between\nthose enclaves.\nGive special considerations to enclaves holding sensitive information (e.g., card\nmanagement systems) from enclaves requiring internet connectivity (e.g., email).\n\n**Encrypt Data in Transit**\n\nSecure all links to payment system engines with a certificate-based mechanism, such\nas mutual transport layer security, for all traffic external or internal to the organization.\nLimit the number of certificates used on the production server, and restrict access to\nthose certificates.\n\n**Monitor for Anomalous Behavior as Part of Layered Security**\n\nConfigure the switch application server to log transactions. Routinely audit transactions\nand system logs.\nDevelop a baseline of expected software, users, and logons. Monitor switch application\nservers for unusual software installations, updates, account changes, or other activity\noutside of expected behavior.\nDevelop a baseline of expected transaction participants, amounts, frequency, and\ntiming. Monitor and flag anomalous transactions for suspected fraudulent activity.\n\n**Recommendations for Organizations with ATM or Point-of-Sale Devices**\n\nImplement chip and PIN requirements for debit cards.\n\n\n-----\n\nRequire and verify message authentication codes on issuer financial request response\nmessages.\nPerform authorization response cryptogram validation for Europay, Mastercard, and\nVisa transactions.\n\n**Mitigation Recommendations for All Organizations**\n\nNCCIC encourages users and administrators to use the following best practices to\nstrengthen the security posture of their organization’s systems:\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong\npasswords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users’ ability (i.e., permissions) to install and run unwanted software\napplications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nEnforce a strong password policy and require regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening email attachments, even if the attachment is expected\nand the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on organization workstations, and configure it to deny\nunsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on organization workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is\nits “true file type” (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users’ web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with content that could\npose cybersecurity risks.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external\ndrives, CDs).\nScan all software downloaded from the internet before executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest cybersecurity threats.\nImplement appropriate ACLs.\n\nFor additional information on malware incident prevention and handling, see the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-83: Guide to\n_[Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops.[2]](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-83r1.pdf)_\n\n**Response to Unauthorized Network Access**\n\nContact DHS or your local FBI office immediately.
