At this moment current post is a temporary, but it could become a permanent\npage and also we will publish this Leak in Huge and famous journals and blogs, also we will\nnotify all your clients, partners and competitors. So it’s depend on you make it confidential\nor public !\"\n\nAmong the already leaked files published as a sign of what's to come, the attackers\nincluded an edpradmin2.kdb file which is a KeePass password manager database.\n\nWhen clicked on the leak site, the link leads to a database export including EDP employees'\nlogin names, passwords, accounts, URLs, and notes.\n\nThe Ragnar Locker ransomware sample used in this attack was found by\nMalwareHunterTeam and BleepingComputer was able to also find the ransom note and the\nTor payment page where the attackers detail the decryption process and the ransom\namount.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the ransom note dropped on the EDP encrypted systems, the attackers were\nable to steal confidential information on billing, contracts, transactions, clients, and partners.\n\n\"And be assure that if you wouldn't pay, all files and documents would be publicated for\neveryones view and also we would notify all your clients and partners about this leakage\nwith direct links,\" the ransom note reads.\n\n\"So if you want to avoid such harm for your reputation, better pay the amount that we\nasking for.\"\n\n## EDP taunted in the live chat room\n\nAs also seen BleepingComputer, the Ragnar Locker operators taunted EDP in a live chat\n\"client room\" used by the attackers to communicate with their victims, asking them to \"check\nthe article about your company\" on the data leak site and if the company is \"ready to see\nyour private information, at the breaking need, tech-blogs, and stockmarket sites.\"\n\nThey also added that the \"timer is not waiting\" and warned EDP not to attempt to decrypt\ntheir data using any other software besides the decryption tool provided by the Ragnar\nLocker operators as they risk damaging or losing it.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers offered EDP a special price if they reach out within two days of their\nsystems having been encrypted, however, they also warned that the company will have to\nwait for their turn as the ransomware's live chat is not online 24/7.\n\nBleepingComputer has reached out to EDP for comment and additional details but had not\nheard back at the time of this publication. This article will be updated when a response is\nreceived.\n\n## Delivered via MSP enterprise support tools\n\nRagnar Locker ransomware was first spotted while being used as part of attacks against\ncompromised networks towards the end of December 2019.\n\nThe Ragnar Locker operators target software regularly used by managed service providers\nto prevent their attack from being detected and blocked.\n\nKyle Hanslovan, the CEO of MSP security firm Huntress Labs, told BleepingComputer in\nFebruary of his company seeing Ragnar Locker being deployed via the MSP software\nConnectWise.\n\nAfter reconnaissance and pre-deployment stages, the attackers drop a highly targeted\nransomware executable that adds specific extension to encrypted files, features an\nembedded RSA-2048 key, and drops custom ransom notes.\n\nThe ransom notes include the victim's company name, a link to the Tor site, and the data\nleak site with the victim's published data.\n\n\n-----\n\nBleepingComputer has previously seen multiple ransom notes for Ragnar Locker with\nransoms ranging from $200,000 to roughly $600,000.\n\n**_Update April 16, 09:21 EDT: An EDP spokesperson told BleepingComputer that the attack_**\ndid not impact the company's power supply service and critical infrastructure.\n\nEDP was the target of a computer attack on its corporate network this Monday, April 13th,\nwhich conditioned part of its services and operations. The power supply service and critical\ninfrastructure, however, have never been compromised and we continue to ensure this\noperation as normal.\n\nThe situation is currently being assessed and we have teams dedicated to restoring the\nnormal functioning of the systems as soon as possible, which is our priority.\n\nEDP is working with the authorities, that were immediately notified of the attack to identify\nthe origin and anatomy of the attack. At this moment, we have no knowledge of this alleged\nransom demand - we have only seen this information disclosed in the media, which we\ncannot verify.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Ransom payment is roughly 15% of the total cost of ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransom-payment-is-roughly-15-percent-of-the-total-cost-of-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Energy Supplier](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/energy-supplier/)\n[Ragnar Locker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ragnar-locker/)\n[Ransom](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransom/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Renewable Energy](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/renewable-energy/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
