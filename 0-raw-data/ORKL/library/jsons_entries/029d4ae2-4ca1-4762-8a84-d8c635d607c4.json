Then Ryuk was replaced by Conti Ransomware gang who has\nbeen using Trickbot for the same purpose.\n\n_“The group’s elite division, called Overdose, managed the TrickBot campaigns that resulted_\n_[in the creation of Conti and Ryuk ransomware.” states the analysis published by AdvInt. “The](https://www.advintel.io/post/the-trickbot-saga-s-finale-has-aired-but-a-spinoff-is-already-in-the-works)_\n_group has made at least $200 million USD with one extreme case extorting ~$34 million USD_\n_from a single victim and has perpetrated a spate of attacks on numerous healthcare_\n_[organizations, including Universal Health Services (UHS) via BazarBackdoor to Ryuk](https://www.hipaajournal.com/universal-health-services-ransomware-attack-cost-67-million-in-2020/)_\n_[ransomware (the attack was estimated for an account for $67 Million USD in damages).”](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/universal-health-services-faces-67-million-loss-after-cyberattack#:~:text=The%20September%202020%20apparent%20ransomware,the%20health%20system's%20U.S.%20facilities.&text=Universal%20Health%20Services%20reported%20an,shutdown%20throughout%20its%20U.S.%20facilities)_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2021, the Conti gang used in exclusive the TrickBot to achieve initial accesses in the\nnetwork of organizations worldwide.\n\nThe goal of the Conti gang is to aggregate highly skilled members of the ransomware\necosystem in a structure, which gives them a little autonomy, to monopolize the market.\n\nThe TrickBot’s core team of developers had already created a stealthier piece of malware\ndubbed BazarBackdoor, used to achieve remote access into corporate networks and use it to\ndeploy the ransomware.\n\nWith the increasing popularity of TrickBot it became easy to detect it with antimalware\nsolutions, for this reason the gang began employing the BazarBackdoor for initial access to\nnetworks.\n\nBy the end of 2021, Conti gang employed core developers and managers of the TrickBot\nbotnet.\n\n_“At the same time, Conti turned into the sole end-user of TrickBot’s botnet product. By the_\n_end of 2021, Conti had essentially acquired TrickBot, with multiple elite developers and_\n_managers joining the ransomware cosa nostra.” concludes the post._\n\n_“However, the people who have led TrickBot throughout its long run will not simply disappear._\n_After being “acquired” by Conti, they are now rich in prospects with the secure ground_\n_beneath them, and Conti will always find a way to make use of the available talent.”_\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n**[(SecurityAffairs –](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)** **hacking, Conti ransomware)**\n\nYou might also like\n\n**[Experts believe that Russian Gamaredon APT could fuel a new round of DDoS attacks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131762/apt/gamaredon-apt-ddos-attacks.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[The strange link between Industrial Spy and the Cuba ransomware operation](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131754/cyber-crime/industrial-spy-cuba-ransomware.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
