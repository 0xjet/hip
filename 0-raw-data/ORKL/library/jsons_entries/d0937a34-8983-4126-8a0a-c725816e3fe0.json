    "plain_text": "# as FLYING KITTEN\n\n[Today, our friends at FireEye released a report on an Iran-based adversary they are calling Saffron Rose.](http://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/fireeye-operation-saffron-rose.pdf)\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has also been tracking and reporting internally on this threat group since mid\nJanuary 2014 under the name FLYING KITTEN, and since that time has seen targeting of multiple U.S.\nbased defense contractors as well as political dissidents.\n\n**Flying Kitten Targeted Intrusion**\n\nFireEye’s report notes that this adversary’s targeted intrusion activity consists of credential theft and\n\nmalware delivery individually. The FLYING KITTEN campaigns investigated by CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nshowed that the actor actually combines the two. For example, the adversary will register a domain that\n\nspoofs the name of the targeted organization and then host a spoofed login page on that site.\n\nThe page is used to steal legitimate credentials, but once users enter the credentials, they are often\n\nredirected to a new page that prompts them to download a “Browser Patch” or other similar type of file.\n\nThe downloaded file is actually the Stealer malware that exfiltrates stolen data to an FTP server.\n\n\n-----\n\nengaged in broader targeting via the website parmanpower[.]com. This website is registered via the same\n\nregistrant email (info[@]usa.gov.us) and other Whois information as some of the other domains related to\n\nthe activity discussed above. It purports to be the website of a business engaged in recruiting, training, and\n\ndevelopment in Erbil, Iraq.\n\nNo malicious activity has been linked to this domain, however, the fact that it was registered under the\n\nsame registrant email at the same time as other FLYING KITTEN domains linked to malicious activity, it\n\nis likely that the adversary is using this site for malicious purposes as well. The website does not appear to\n\ndeliver any malware, so its most likely purpose is to act as a credential-collection mechanism much like\n\nthe spoofed Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Aerospace Conference website\n\n(aeroconf2014[.]org) the adversary used earlier this year. This spoofed recruiting company website could\n\nbe used to target entities across a wide range of sectors.\n\n**Attribution**\n\nAttribution in this case is interesting, as the adversary appears to have made a mistake when registering\n\nits malicious domains. The registrant email that currently appears in the Whois records of some of the\n\nFLYING KITTEN domains is info[@]usa.gov.us, however historical records show that the domains were\n\noriginally registered under the email address keyvan.ajaxtm[@]gmail.com.\n\nAs FireEye’s report notes, the keyvan.ajaxtm@gmail.com email address ties back to an Iran-based entity\n\ncalled Ajax Security Team. Earlier this year, Ajax Security had an easily identifiable presence on the\n\nInternet with its own website and related Facebook pages.\n\nThis Internet presence has decreased significantly since early 2014, likely due to a desire to keep a lower\n\nprofile now that the group is engaged in targeted intrusion activity.\n\nThe following Yara rules will provide detection for the adversary remote access toolkit and exfiltration\n\ntool:\n\nrule CrowdStrike_FlyingKitten : rat\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\n\n-----\n\ndescription = \"Flying Kitten RAT\"\n\nversion = \"1.0\"\n\nactor = \"FLYING KITTEN\"\n\nin_the_wild = true\n\nstrings:\n\n$classpath = \"Stealer.Properties.Resources.resources\"\n\n$pdbstr = \"\\Stealer\\obj\\x86\\Release\\Stealer.pdb\"\n\ncondition:\n\nall of them and\n\nuint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint32(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550 and\n\nuint16(uint32(0x3C) + 0x16) & 0x2000 == 0 and\n\n((uint16(uint32(0x3c)+24) == 0x010b and\n\nuint32(uint32(0x3c)+232) > 0) or\n\n(uint16(uint32(0x3c)+24) == 0x020b and\n\nuint32(uint32(0x3c)+248) > 0))\n\n}\n\nrule CrowdStrike_CSIT_14003_03 : installer\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\ncopyright = \"CrowdStrike, Inc\"\n\ndescription = \"Flying Kitten Installer\"\n\nversion = \"1.0\"\n\n\n-----\n\nin_the_wild = true\n\nstrings:\n\n$exename = \"IntelRapidStart.exe\"\n\n$confname = \"IntelRapidStart.exe.config\"\n\n$cabhdr = { 4d 53 43 46 00 00 00 00 }\n\ncondition:\n\nall of them\n\n}\n\n[You can use this rule with CrowdStrike’s free CrowdResponse tool to easily scan your systems for presence](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/new-community-tool-crowdresponse/)\n\nof FLYING KITTEN.\n\nIf you have any questions about these signatures or want to hear more about Flying Kitten and their\n\n[tradecraft, please contact: intelligence@crowdstrike.com and inquire about Falcon Intelligence, our Cyber](mailto:intelligence@crowdstrike.com)\n\nThreat Intelligence subscription.\n\n## Share this \n\n-----",
