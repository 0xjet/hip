Growth in this profession is a testament to the need\nfor their expertise and also a signal that global economic activity is advancing. Furthermore,\nchanges in information technology (IT) and evolving IT norms on how, when, and where\nbusiness operations occur—such as BYOD, cloud computing, and social media—remind us\nthat information security professionals must be highly adaptable in learning and applying new\nskills, technologies, and procedures in order to manage a dynamic range of risks. Not to be\noverlooked, hackers, attackers, and other threatening entities are also advancing and evolving.\nChange and complexity in IT and IT norms represent new opportunities for them to succeed\nin their nefarious pursuits. Consequently, information security professionals have no downtime;\nthere are always new risk management challenges to address.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that (ISC)[2], in partnership with Booz Allen Hamilton, with the\nassistance of Frost & Sullivan, conducted its sixth bi-annual worldwide survey of information\nsecurity professionals.[1] This Web-based survey conducted in the fourth quarter of 2012 was\nboth broad in scope (more than 12,000 respondents, a 19 percent increase over the 2011\nsurvey) and deep in its queries. In addition to producing a rich profile of this profession and its\ndedication to continuous training and education, this year’s survey intensified its focus on the\nrisk and response to BYOD, cloud computing, and social media. Secure software development,\ntouched on lightly in previous surveys, also garnered expanded focus in the 2013 survey. This\nwas done in recognition that software applications are increasingly under attack. Without a\ncorresponding response by security professionals and the technology vendors that support\nthem, this “soft” underbelly of business and governmental entities has and will continue to be\nexposed with serious consequences—data breaches, disrupted operations, lost business, brand\ndamage, and regulatory fines. **Secure software development, more than any other**\n**discipline, is where the largest gap between risk and response attention by the**\n**information security profession exists. Other notable survey findings include:**\n\n  - **Information security is a stable and growing profession – Information security**\nprofessionals are very stable in their employment; more than 80 percent had no change in\nemployer or employment in the past year, and the number of professionals is projected to\ncontinuously grow more than 11 percent annually over the next five years.\n\n  - **(ISC)[2] membership and location drive higher salaries –** The salary gap between\n(ISC)[2] members and non-members is widening. Comparatively on a regional basis, 79\npercent of information security professionals in developed countries in the Americas have\naverage salaries of US$80,000 or more, whereas only 12 percent of respondents located\nin APAC developing countries do.\n\n1 Founded in 1989, (ISC)2® is a not-for-profit global operating organization dedicated to providing education,\ncertification, and peer-networking opportunities for information security professionals throughout their careers.\n\n\nFrost.com **3**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrost & Sullivan\n\n\n\n  - **Even with past annual growth in the double-digits, workforce shortages persist –**\nFifty-six percent of respondents believe there is a workforce shortage, compared to two\npercent that believe there is a surplus. The impact of shortage is the greatest on the\nexisting workforce.\n\n  - **Knowledge and certification of knowledge weigh heavily in job placement**\n**and advancement** – Broad understanding of the security field was the #1 factor in\ncontributing to career success; followed by communication skills. Nearly 70 percent view\ncertification as a reliable indicator of competency.\n\n  - **Application vulnerabilities rank the highest in security concern – Malware**\nand mobile device are close seconds. Mitigating the risk from these and other security\nconcerns to the organization’s reputation is the highest priority.\n\n  - **While attack remediation is anticipated to be rapid, security incident**\n**preparedness is exhibiting signs of strain – Twenty-eight percent believe their**\norganizations can remediate from a targeted attack within one day. Yet, with regard\nto being prepared for a security incident, a doubling of the percentage of 2013 survey\nrespondents believe their preparedness has worsened compared to the respondents in\nthe 2011 survey.\n\n  - **Information security professionals trump products in securing infrastructure**\n**effectiveness** – In a ranking of importance in securing infrastructure, software and\nhardware solutions rank behind the effectiveness of information security professionals.\n\n  - **Security concern is high for BYOD and cloud computing** – Protecting sensitive\ninformation contributes to the security concern noted in both of these IT trends. Security\nconcern with social media is significantly lower than in 2011 as organizations leverage existing\nsecurity technologies and policy mechanisms to manage this communication channel.\n\n  - **New skills, deepening knowledge, and a wider range of technologies needed –**\nA multi-disciplinary approach is required to address the risks in BYOD and cloud computing.\nWith cloud computing, organizations balance the type of cloud environment with their\nlevel of acceptable risk and ability to control risk. For example, with security concern\nregarding cloud computing being high, private clouds, where the customer has greater\ncontrol in security risk management, are chosen more frequently than public clouds.\n\n**Survey Objective and Methodology**\n\nThe 2013 Global Information Security Workforce Study (GISWS) was conducted in\nSeptember-December of 2012 through a Web-based survey, approximately 25 minutes in\nlength. The study’s objective is to gauge the opinions of information security professionals\nregarding trends and issues affecting their profession and careers. Designed to capture\nexpansive viewpoints and produce statistically significant results, a total of 12,396 surveys of\nqualified information security professionals were collected. The diversity of survey respondents\nis reflected in the survey respondent profiles shown on the next page.\n\n\n**4** Frost.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Dynamically Stable Information Security Career\n\n**Respondents by Membership** **Respondents by Job Title**\n\n**C-Levels &**\n\n**Non-Members** **Officers**\n**32%** **14%**\n\n**Security Analysts** **Managers**\n**& All Other** **13%**\n\n**(ISC)[2]** **34%** **Auditors**\n\n**7%**\n\n**Members**\n\n**Architects, Strategists,**\n\n**68%**\n\n**& Strategic Advisors**\n**32%**\n\n**Respondents by Industry Vertical**\n\n\n**C-Levels &**\n\n**Non-Members** **Officers**\n**32%** **14%**\n\n**Security Analysts** **Managers**\n**& All Other** **13%**\n\n**(ISC)[2]** **34%** **Auditors**\n\n**7%**\n\n**Members**\n\n**Architects, Strategists,**\n\n**68%**\n\n**& Strategic Advisors**\n**32%**\n\n\n**Manufacturing**\n**5%**\n\n**Telecom &**\n**Media**\n**7%**\n\n\n**Healthcare**\n**4%**\n\n\n**Other Private**\n**Enterprise**\n**12%**\n\n**Gov’t**\n**Defense** **Professional &**\n**10%** **Personal Services**\n\n**Gov’t** **21%**\n**Non-Defense**\n**11%** **Banking, Insurance,**\n\n**Information**\n\n**& Finance**\n\n**Technology**\n\n**17%**\n\n**13%**\n\n\n**Respondents by Company Size** **Respondents by Region**\n**(Number of Employees)** **Rest of**\n\n**the World**\n**11%**\n**Asia**\n**11%**\n\n\n**11%**\n**Asia**\n**11%**\n\n**10,000 or more**\n\n**Europe**\n\n**43%**\n\n**21%**\n\n**1-499**\n**25%**\n\n**North America**\n\n**2,500-9,999**\n\n**57%**\n\n**17%** **500-2,499**\n**15%**\n\n\nFrost.com **5**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrost & Sullivan\n\n\n**Security Threats and Vulnerabilities, Implications and State**\n**of Readiness**\n\nAs reported in previous GISWS surveys, there is no lack of diversity in the threats and\nvulnerabilities information security professionals are tackling—and concerned about. All of the\n12 threats and vulnerabilities presented in the survey were selected as top or high concerns for\n36 percent or more of the survey respondents. At the top of the list, application vulnerabilities,\nmalware, and mobile devices were each identified as a top or high concern by two-thirds or\nmore of the respondents.\n\n**THREAT AND VULNERABILITY CONCERNS**\n\n**(TOP AND HIGH CONCERNS)**\n\n\n**Application Vulnerabilities**\n\n**Malware**\n\n**Mobile Devices**\n\n**Internal Employees**\n\n**Hackers**\n\n**Cloud-based Services**\n\n**Cyber Terrorism**\n\n**Contractors**\n\n**Hacktivists**\n\n**Trusted Third Parties**\n\n**Organized Crime**\n\n**State Sponsored Acts**\n\n\n**69%**\n\n**67%**\n\n**66%**\n\n\n**56%**\n\n**56%**\n\n\n**49%**\n\n**44%**\n\n**43%**\n\n**43%**\n\n**39%**\n\n**36%**\n\n**36%**\n\n\nGreater examination of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), including mobile devices, cloud\ncomputing, and social media, and their security implications and how information security\nprofessionals are responding, is included later in this paper. Secure software development, the\nupfront means to lessen application vulnerabilities, will also be examined later in this paper.\n\nFocusing deeper into the responses on threats and vulnerabilities reveals that concern\nseverity varies.\n\n  - **Some perspectives change over time – Comparing this year’s survey to the 2011**\nresults, the level of concern is fairly stable. However, there was a notable increase in\ncloud-based services. Compared to the 49 percent of respondents that view cloud-based\nservices as either a top or high security concern in the 2013 survey, 43 percent viewed\nit as a top or high security concern in the 2011 survey. We believe this increase follows\nthe increased adoption of cloud-based services over the two-year period since the last\nsurvey, combined with the resilient security concerns, real and perceived, associated with\ncloud-based services.\n\n  - **C-levels and officers rated nearly all threat and vulnerability categories**\n**higher than respondents in other job titles – This was most notable in application**\nvulnerabilities and mobile device security. Top or high concern was selected by 72 percent\nof C-levels and officers for application vulnerabilities and 70 percent for mobile devices.\n\n  - **Size and anxiety is correlated – In all threat and vulnerability categories, the average**\nlevel of concern increased as company size increased. Perhaps the bigger the company is,\nthe more resources it devotes to examining these threats and through that examination,\ngains a more comprehensive and realistic appreciation of risk and risk implications. Also,\n\n\n**6** Frost.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Dynamically Stable Information Security Career\n\nfrom the “greatest gain for the effort mentality,” larger companies represent more lucrative\ntargets for attackers and hackers, thus contributing to a higher level of concern among\nlarge company respondents.\n\n  - **Vertical equates to variability – The nature of a company’s business and operations**\nalso has implications on being a target and with that, variation in concern. No surprise,\nrespondents in the banking, insurance, and finance verticals, with their possession and\nuse of valuable and exploitable personally identifiable and financial information, view\nthe threats posed by hackers, hacktivists, and organized crime higher than the majority\nof other verticals. Government respondents, also not a surprise, view the threat of\nstate-sponsored acts and cyber terrorism as a greater security concern (i.e., choosing top\nor high concern) over private enterprises by more than 20 percentage points in each of\nthese threat categories.\n\n  - **Developing countries express higher level of concern – Survey respondents located**\nin developing countries state a higher level of concern for a majority of the threat and\nvulnerability categories versus respondents in developed countries. Directly contributing\nto this is that information security investments in developing countries are historically\nless than the global average. This is reflected in the lower level of security certifications in\ndeveloping versus developed countries. For example, with the most popular certification\nchosen by survey respondents—Certified Information Systems Security Professional\n(CISSP[®])—only 42 percent of the survey respondents located in developing countries\n(members and non-members combined) had acquired and maintained this certification,\nversus 71 percent of respondents located in developed countries.[2]\n\nThreats and vulnerabilities have implications—attackers are successful and vulnerabilities are\nexploited. To that point, the survey asked respondents to rank their organizations’ priorities:\nIn other words, what needs to be avoided? As shown, damage to the organization’s reputation,\nbreach of laws and regulations, and service downtime represent the top three to-be-avoided\noutcomes. Also noteworthy is the high percentage of top-priority selections. For example,\n49 percent of all survey respondents rated damage to the organization’s reputation as a\ntop priority. In fact, five of the nine categories received a top-priority rating by more than\none-third of the survey respondents. Conclusion: the “protect and secure” activities of\n**information security professionals are strongly aligned with many high priorities**\n**of their organizations.**\n\n**ORGANIZATIONS’ PRIORITIES**\n**(TOP AND HIGH)**\n\n\n**Damage to the organization's reputation**\n\n**Breach of laws and regulations**\n\n**Service downtime**\n\n**Customer privacy violations**\n\n**Customer identity theft or fraud**\n\n**Theft of intellectual property**\n\n**Health and safety**\n\n**Reduced shareholder value**\n\n**Lawsuits**\n\n\n**83%**\n\n\nFrost.com **7**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrost & Sullivan\n\n\nPerhaps an indication of information security professionals’ improving ability to allay a subset\nof outcomes, the percent of respondents in the 2013 survey selecting top or high concern\nfor service downtime, customer privacy violations, theft of intellectual property, and lawsuits\nwas down 3-5 percentage points from the 2011 survey for these categories. These reductions\nnotwithstanding, these categories remain high priority.\n\nNotable variation in priority ratings among job titles, company sizes, and verticals are:\n\n  - **Auditors’ aim is clear – In keeping with the role of auditor, survey respondents that**\nchose this job title prioritize breach of laws and regulations higher than all other job titles.\nAlso aligned with their roles, managers and security analysts placed a higher priority on\nservice downtime than the other job titles.\n\n  - **Priority rises with company size – Like security concerns, priority ratings rose with**\ncompany size.\n\n  - **Top priority varies among verticals, logically – Sixty-three percent of banking,**\ninsurance, and finance respondents selected damage to the organization’s reputation as\ntop priority. In healthcare, 59 percent chose customer privacy violations as top priority.\nFifty-seven percent of construction respondents chose health and safety as a top priority,\nand 50 percent of telecom & media respondents view service downtime as top priority.\n\nWith a diversity of threats and vulnerabilities to be concerned with and the need to avoid a\nrange of undesirable outcomes, it is logical to ask about preparedness. In a repeat of the 2011\nsurvey, the 2013 survey requested the respondents judge their change in readiness relative\nto 12 months earlier (perform better, worse, or same). The results for both surveys are\nsummarized in the following table.\n\n**Percent of Respondent**\n**Performance Relative to 12 months Earlier**\n**Better** **Worse** **Same**\n**_Being prepared for_** 2013 survey: 41% 2013 survey: 6% 2013 survey: 53%\n**_a security incident_** 2011 survey: 55% 2011 survey: 3% 2011 survey: 43%\n**_Discovering a_** 2013 survey: 40% 2013 survey: 6% 2013 survey: 54%\n**_security breach_** 2011 survey: 50% 2011 survey: 3% 2011 survey: 47%\n**_Recovering from a_** 2013 survey: 39% 2013 survey: 6% 2013 survey: 55%\n**_security incident_** 2011 survey: 49% 2011 survey: 3% 2011 survey: 48%\n\nWhile the majority of respondents believe that their organizations would perform better or\nthe same relative to 12 months earlier, there was a 10-point or more decline in the percent\nof respondents believing they would perform better in the 2013 survey compared to the\n2011 survey. Not as significant, but equally disconcerting about improvement in the state\n\n2 The percent of survey respondents with certifications other than CISSP (e.g., ITIL, CISA, and Security+) was materially lower,\nand the difference between developed and developing countries was less (10 percentage points difference or less).\n\n|Col1|Percent of Respondent Performance Relative to 12 months Earlier|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n||Better|Worse|Same|\n|Being prepared for a security incident Discovering a security breach Recovering from a security incident|2013 survey: 41% 2011 survey: 55% 2013 survey: 40% 2011 survey: 50% 2013 survey: 39% 2011 survey: 49%|2013 survey: 6% 2011 survey: 3% 2013 survey: 6% 2011 survey: 3% 2013 survey: 6% 2011 survey: 3%|2013 survey: 53% 2011 survey: 43% 2013 survey: 54% 2011 survey: 47% 2013 survey: 55% 2011 survey: 48%|\n\n\n**8** Frost.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Dynamically Stable Information Security Career\n\nof readiness, twice the percentage of respondents in the 2013 survey view their readiness\nhas worsened in the past year as did respondents in the 2011 survey. **As an indication**\n**that membership really matters, the survey-over-survey decline in the percent**\n**of respondents selecting “better,” and increase in selecting “worse,” was not as**\n**profound with member respondents compared to non-member respondents.**\n\nOther noteworthy observations from the 2013 survey on these readiness categories include:\n\n  - **C-levels and the rank-and-file differ – Respondents with C-level and officer job titles**\nwere decidedly more optimistic on readiness; they chose “perform better” by a greater\npercentage than respondents in all other job title categories.\n\n  - **Largest companies more optimistic – In all three categories of readiness, a greater**\npercentage of the largest companies (10,000 employees or more) viewed that their readiness\nhad improved versus smaller companies. Reflecting the correlation between readiness and\ntraining, and smaller companies being less optimistic on their readiness than large companies,\na greater percent of survey respondents in companies with 2,500 or fewer employees than\nlarger companies indicated spending on training and education increased in the past 12\nmonths and is expected to increase over the next 12 months as well.\n\n  - **Battle-tested banking, finance, and insurance verticals confident they are**\n**turning the tide – Respondents in these industries chose “perform better” to a greater**\nextent than all other verticals in all three categories. Conversely, the respondents in the\nless battle-tested utilities vertical chose “perform worse” to a greater extent than any\nother vertical.\n\nAnother survey question focused on readiness is how quickly damage from a targeted attack\nwould be remediated. Slightly more than two-thirds of the respondents project that they could\nremediate the damage from a targeted attack within a week or less. Yet, there is also a material\nportion of the respondents that are unsure how long damage remediation might take.\n\n**Time to Remediate from a Targeted Attack**\n\n\n**Within a month**\n**4%**\n\n**Within two**\n**to three weeks**\n**9%**\n\n\n**Longer than a month**\n**3%**\n\n\n**Don’t**\n**know**\n**15%**\n\n**Within**\n**a day**\n\n**Within** **28%**\n**a week**\n**41%**\n\n\n\n- **As** **typical,** **C-levels** **voiced** **greater** **assurance** **on** **their** **organizations’**\n**readiness – C-levels and officers chose “within one day” or “don’t know” less than**\nrespondents with job titles farther down the organizational structure—31 percent and\n10 percent, respectively.\n\n\nFrost.com **9**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrost & Sullivan\n\n\n\n  - **Smallness advantage – With a less diverse and smaller spread of operations, 31 percent**\nof small companies (less than 500 employees) believe they can remediate in one day\nand 44 percent within a week. This is a faster expectation than very large companies\n(10,000 or more employees)—28 percent and 39 percent, respectively. Also, respondents\nin very large organizations chose “don’t know” to a greater extent (18 percent) than small\ncompanies (12 percent).\n\n  - **Experience advantage – Banking, insurance, and finance verticals, plus the info tech**\nvertical, believe they can respond faster than other industries; 34 percent and 32 percent\nof respondents in those verticals, respectively, predicted within one day to remediate.\nPotentially due to highly distributed operations, respondents in the retail & wholesale and\nconstruction verticals chose “don’t know” at higher levels—19 percent and 20 percent,\nrespectively. Potentially, a lack of experience in past remediation efforts influenced 20\npercent of respondents in the utilities vertical to choose “don’t know.”\n\n**People are a Key Tool in Information Security**\n\nWith the pervasiveness, diversity, and evolution in security threats, information security\nprofessionals use an assortment of tools. Top of the list are human aspects: management\n**support, qualified staff, and policy adherence, with half or greater of respondents**\n**choosing very important for each. The next four categories also have a human aspect.**\nSecurity software and hardware are materially farther down the list of essential tools in\neffective security; confirming the viewpoint that the effectiveness of security technologies is\nmaximized only when the trained human element is actively incorporated.\n\n**IMPORTANCE IN SECURING INFRASTRUCTURE**\n**(VERY IMPORTANT AND IMPORTANT)**\n\n\n**Management support of security policies**\n\n**Qualified security staff**\n\n**Adherence to security policy**\n\n**Training of staff on security policy**\n\n**Budget allocated for security**\n\n**Having access to executive management**\n\n**Secure software development**\n\n**Software solutions**\n\n**Hardware solutions**\n\nOther observations include:\n\n\n**89%**\n\n**88%**\n\n**86%**\n\n**83%**\n\n\n\n- Compared to the 2011 survey, the average importance ratings were essentially unchanged\nin the 2013 survey.\n\n- C-levels and officers indicated a higher importance on access to executives than\nrespondents in other job titles, indicating that these respondents believe their greatest\ninfluence occurs at their peer level.\n\n\n**10** Frost.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Dynamically Stable Information Security Career\n\n - As organization size increases, importance on human assets increases, whereas the\nimportance of hardware and software is even across company sizes.\n\n - Across industry verticals, respondents in the government place higher importance on\nhardware and software solutions than the companies in the private sector.\n\n  - **Secure software development is viewed as more important by banking, finance,**\n**and insurance; info tech; retail and wholesale; and telecom and media verticals.**\n\nConcentrating on select security technologies that provide significant improvement in system\nand network security (those that garnered more than 10 percent of respondent selection),\ntwo technologies were highlighted by the survey respondents for their capabilities: network\nmonitoring & intelligence, and intrusion detection & prevention.\n\n**TECHNOLOGIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY**\n**IMPROVE SYSTEM AND NETWORK SECURITY**\n\n\n**Network monitoring and intelligence**\n\n**Improved intrusion detection**\n**and prevention technologies**\n\n**Web security applications**\n\n**Policy management and audit tools**\n\n**Automated identity management software**\n\nOther perspectives are:\n\n\n**75%**\n\n**72%**\n\n\n\n- Aside from the technologies shown, no other selectable technology in the survey gained\nmore than one percent of survey respondents’ votes.

Also, the importance of secure software**\n**development was rated above software and hardware solutions in securing the**\n**organization’s infrastructure. Here, too, there is variance associated with company size. In**\nparticular, as company size increases, the importance of secure software development relative\nto the importance of software and hardware solutions also increases.\n\nRecognizing that software procurement and development involves multiple phases, the level of\nsecurity concern may fluctuate among these steps. According to the survey respondents, this\nis true but within a fairly narrow range in the pre-installation steps.\n\n**SECURITY CONCERNS AT STAGES OF SOFTWARE**\n\n**PROCUREMENT AND DEVELOPMENT**\n**(TOP AND HIGH)**\n\n**Design** **71%**\n\n**Specifying requirements** **69%**\n\n**Testing, debugging, or validation** **65%**\n\n**Construction** **61%**\n**_(i.e., implementation or coding)_**\n\n**Integration** **62%**\n\n**Maintenance** **50%**\n\n**Installation** **46%**\n\nThe risk implications of these concerns are most notable in the proportion of detected security\nbreaches attributed to insecure software.

Regardless of this uncertainty, along with insecure software’s unquantifiable\nattribution in undetected breaches, information security professionals are certain that their\nconcerns regarding insecure software are justified.\n\n**DETECTED SECURITY BREACHES IN THE PAST YEAR**\n**ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSECURE SOFTWARE**\n\n**Don't know** **40%**\n\n**Less than 25%** **33%**\n\n**25% - 49%** **13%**\n\n**50% - 74%** **9%**\n\n**75% - 100%** **5%**\n\n\nFrost.com **19**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrost & Sullivan\n\n\nThe next question is, what is being done to mitigate or resolve the risk of insecure\nsoftware? This mitigation begins by being involved in software development, procurement,\nand outsourcing. According to survey respondents, approximately 50 percent state that\nsomeone other than themselves from their security organizations is engaged in software\ndevelopment, procurement, and outsourcing. Not so promising of information security\n**professionals’ involvement is the substantially lower percent personally involved**\n**in software development (12 percent), procurement (20 percent), and outsourcing**\n**(10 percent). Considering the size and comprehensive reach of the GISWS, and the high**\nlevel of concern and attributed risk assigned to insecure software, this survey observation is\none signal that a material gap exists between risk and response.\n\n**INVOLVEMENT IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, PROCUREMENT AND OUTSOURCING**\n\n**Development of software applications**\n\n**Procurement of software applications**\n\n**Outsourcing the development**\n**of software application**\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%** **60%**\n\n**Personally** **Organization** **No Involvement at all**\n\nThe phases of software procurement and development that this subset of information\nsecurity professionals is engaged in are diverse. The most common phase of personal\n**involvement is specifying requirements (75 percent). Involvement in stages**\n**that confirm that these requirements are meeting their objectives drops off**\n**considerably.** This, too, is a signal of a gap between risk and response by information\nsecurity professionals and their organizations.\n\n**INVOLVEMENT IN SOFTWARE PROCUREMENT AND DEVELOPMENT STAGES**\n\n**Specifying requirements** **75%**\n\n**Testing, debugging, or validation** **56%**\n\n**Installation and deployment** **54%**\n\n**Design** **50%**\n\n**Integration** **50%**\n\n**Support** **47%**\n\n**Maintenance** **46%**\n\n**Construction** **28%**\n**_(i.e., implementation or coding)_**\n\nAs reported previously in this study, information security professionals, members, and\nnon-members, view acquiring new skills and certification as very important. **Earning**\n**certifications most applicable to secure software, however, is hardly a blip on**\n**the list of certifications survey respondents claim. For example, only one percent**\nof surveyed information security professionals claim to have acquired the Certified Secure\nSoftware Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP[®]) certification. This is also a signal that the gap between\ninsecure software risk and response is real.\n\n\n**20** Frost.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Dynamically Stable Information Security Career\n\nThe conclusion is apparent: unless software and information security professionals’ involvement\nis deepened in secure software development, procurement, and outsourcing; and training and\neducation permeates the ranks of software development functions, the risks associated with\ninsecure software will remain. **Furthermore, deepening engagements in software**\n**development cannot occur in isolation or be the exclusive responsibility of the**\n**information security workforce. Other relevant functional groups—software**\n**developers, application owners, and the quality assurance and testing teams—must**\n**internalize secure software development best practices and engage, as standard**\n**operating procedure, with information security professionals. While expertise in the**\ninformation security discipline varies across groups, all groups must be responsible in order for\nthe risk and consequences of insecure software to decrease.\n\n**Security Implications of BYOD, Cloud Computing, and Social Media**\n\nIn this section, we zero in on the survey responses to three prominent IT trends: BYOD, cloud\ncomputing, and social media. Each is unique in their security implications and how information\nsecurity professionals and their organizations are managing risk. For example, assessment of\nsecurity risk is not uniform. BYOD is the highest overall, followed by cloud computing and\nsocial media. We believe that the “it’s just happening” and “happening at accelerating speed”\nwith BYOD are forcing organizations to react more than with cloud computing, where adoption\nand use is more of a managed choice by companies. Consequently, the risk in BYOD is\n**“cast upon” businesses more so than evaluated and chosen with cloud computing.**\nSocial media is different. While social media, too, has the “cast upon” attribute of BYOD, social\nmedia represents more of an evolution in internal and external communication channels than\nthe introduction of a mushrooming range of user-owned and therefore untrusted user devices.\nAs such, companies have experience in managing the risk of unauthorized communications\n(e.g., when instant messaging and Web-based email became broadly available), with many of the\nsame and existing technologies and procedures to monitor and manage the communication\nflows. Consequently, the security risk with social media is less than BYOD.\n\n**BYOD, CLOUD COMPUTING, AND SOCIAL MEDIA**\n**(TOP 2 ON 5-POINT SCALE OF SECURITY SIGNIFIGANCE OR CONCERN)**\n\n**Overall, how significant a security risk would you say employee or** **78%** **BYOD**\n**partner owned devices pose for your organization?**\n\n**Confidential or sensitive data loss or leakage** **81%**\n\n**Exposure of confidential or sensitive information** **80%**\n**to unauthorized systems or personnel**\n\n**Weak system or application access controls** **67%**\n\n**Disruptions in** **the continuous operation of the data center** **65%**\n**(i.e., uninterrupted availability)**\n\n**Susceptibility to cyber attacks** **62%**\n\n**Inability to support compliance audits** **50%** **CLOUD**\n\n**COMPUTING**\n\n**Inability to support forensic investigations** **50%**\n\n**How much of a concern is social media** **43%** **SOCIAL MEDIA**\n**as a security threat to your organization?**\n\n|Confidential or sensitive data loss or leakage Exposure of confidential or sensitive information to unauthorized systems or personnel Weak system or application access controls Disruptions in the continuous operation of the data center (i.e., uninterrupted availability) Susceptibility to cyber attacks Inability to support compliance audits Inability to support forensic investigations|81% 80% 67% 65% 62% 50% CLOUD COMPUTING 50%|\n|---|---|\n\n\nFrost.com **21**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrost & Sullivan\n\n\n**_BYOD_**\n\nApproval for use of user-owned devices, according to this survey, is more than 50 percent.\nDifferences in allowance do exist, primarily among verticals. For example, 67 percent of\nrespondents in government state user-owned devices are not allowed. In the private sector,\n47 percent of respondents in banking, insurance, and finance verticals state user-owned\ndevices are not allowed. **At the other end, education is most permissive, with 86**\n**percent of education respondents claiming user-owned devices (employee and**\n**business partners combined) are allowed.**\n\n**ALLOW USER-ORIENTED DEVICES (BYOD)**\n\n**Yes, business partners** **4%** **53%**\n\n**Yes, both employees and business partners** **23%**\n\n**Yes, employees** **26%**\n\n**No, we do not allow any user devices** **42%**\n**to access the organization's network**\n\n**Don't know** **5%**\n\nEnd-user license agreements are one way that companies manage BYOD risk.

Among industry verticals, the cloud computing priority varies\nmoderately. Respondents in info tech have the highest cloud computing priority; 57 percent\nchose top- or high-priority cloud computing currently and expect priority to rise to 69 percent\nin two years. Government respondents express the lowest current and future cloud computing\npriority ratings (top and high)—26 percent and 45 percent, respectively.\n\n\nFrost.com **23**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrost & Sullivan\n\n\n**CURRENT AND FUTURE PRIORITY OF CLOUD COMPUTING BY COMPANY SIZE**\n**(TOP AND HIGH PRIORITIES)**\n\n**Currently**\n\n**Within two years**\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%** **60%**\n\n**10,000 or more** **2,500 - 9,999** **500 - 2,499** **1 - 499**\n\n**Selection among cloud computing approaches corresponds to the high level of risk**\n**currently associated with the cloud.** As shown in the table below, private cloud computing\nservices have the greatest proportionate use.

Furthermore, with cloud services providers not bound by industry standards**\nor regulations with regard to security practices and procedures, general understanding of\npotential cloud risks would be incomplete in assessing risk. A thorough understanding of each\npotential cloud service provider would be required to adequately assess risk across providers.\n\n**_Social Media_**\n\nAs previously shared, the security concern with social media is less than BYOD and cloud\ncomputing. Nevertheless, there is sufficient concern that a majority of information security\nprofessionals take action to manage the risk emanating from social media use. The most\nprominent means to limit access to social media is by using content filtering and website\nblocking technologies. The prominence of these technologies is greater with larger companies\nthan small. Not surprisingly, higher proportions of medium, large, and very large companies\nsurveyed use this technology for social media access control than small companies. Also\nas expected, survey respondents in the banking, insurance, and finance verticals expressed\ngreater use (82 percent) of these technologies than any other vertical. Respondents in the\n**education vertical are the most permissive in social media access; 59 percent state**\n**their organizations have no social media restrictions.**\n\n**HOW EMPLOYEE ACCESS TO SOCIAL MEDIA IS LIMITED**\n\n**Through content filtering and** **64%**\n**website blocking technology**\n\n**By setting and enforcing policy** **51%**\n\n**We have no restrictions on the** **25%**\n**use of social media by employees**\n\n\nFrost.com **25**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrost & Sullivan\n\n\n**The Last Word**\n\nThe professional discipline of information security is complex and requires continuous\ninvestment in knowledge, procedures, and technologies. Moreover, the application\nof information security is the duty of all members of the organization. From a practical\nperspective, there is a shared need to protect what is important—sensitive information\nand critical business operations—and a shared responsibility as system users and their\ndevices represent a widely distributed and dynamic field of entry points into public and\nprivate networked operations and informational databases. Without organizationally broad\nawareness and attentiveness to security policies, risk will surely rise and, as a consequence,\ncontribute to sub-optimized effort by information security professionals. More time will be\ndriven to incident response and remediation, and away from proactive building of security\npractices that meet the organization’s risk management objectives and directly contribute to\nstrategic business initiatives (e.g., development and implementation of cutting-edge software\napplications, mobilizing workforce and operations, and extracting maximum benefits from\nthe evolution in information technologies, such as cloud computing).\n\nFor those who have chosen a career in information security, it is a rewarding profession both\nintellectually and financially. And while skill and knowledge building must never slow down—\nattackers, hackers, and other cyber threat actors certainly will not—information security\nprofessionals must also translate their risk management expertise into organization-wide\nleadership. Consider if those with the greatest understanding of risk management operate\nin isolation or, worse, choose to violate security policies. Members of other functional areas\nin the organization will view information security as an optional responsibility and be equally,\nif not more, cavalier in their adherence to security policies. Therefore, it is incumbent upon\ninformation security professionals to demonstrate security consciousness, and openly and\nfreely engage with members of other departments to show how security is best when\npracticed together.\n\n**_Michael P.
