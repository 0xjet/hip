    "plain_text": "# DarkSide: The new ransomware group behind highly targeted attacks\n\n**[digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/darkside-the-new-ransomware-group-behind-highly-targeted-attacks/](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/darkside-the-new-ransomware-group-behind-highly-targeted-attacks/)**\n\nSeptember 22, 2020\n\nWe’ve recently observed the emergence of a new ransomware operation named DarkSide.\nThe nuance of the operation includes corporate-like methods and customized ransomware\n[executables, which have made headlines. When it comes to analyzing new ransomware](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/08/23/beware-of-the-dark-side-a-sinister-new-1-million-cybersecurity-threat-darkside-ransomware/#1640488020e9)\ncampaigns, one might ask, “how innovative is this threat compared to previous ones?” Well,\nDarkSide is no different from its counterparts but is indeed the latest representation of the\nrising Ransomware-as-a-Corporation (RaaC) trend. Cybercriminals have seen their revenues\nsteadily increase in the last years, making the ransomware market extremely prolific.\nConsequently, we’ve observed frequent attempts from threat actors to upscale their\noperations’ external appearance to improve their reliability and reputation.\n\n_Figure 1: DarkSide threat actor profile in Digital Shadows’ client portal_\nIn the past month, Digital Shadows has been closely monitoring DarkSide, owing to their\nrecent operation premiere and the interesting methods they utilize throughout their\ncampaign. Since the threat intelligence nerds at Digital Shadows find this new operation so\nfascinating, we wanted to create a blog to detail our findings.\n\nWith that said, come with us to the DarkSide (see what we did there?) to get the skinny on\nour recent discoveries.\n\n## Bringing DarkSide to light\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DarkSide operation is hardly innovating in terms of tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs) used by other threat actors. The group shares its methods with infamous names like\nDoppelPaymer, Sodinokibi, Maze, and NetWalker. Many researchers that have analyzed the\nDarkSide ransomware agree that there are significant overlaps between this operation and\nthose mentioned above. What, then, makes DarkSide particularly interesting? The answer is\nthreefold:\n\n1. The group has a highly targeted approach to targeting their victims\n2. Custom ransomware executables are carefully prepared for each target\n3. There is a corporate-like method of communication throughout their attacks\n\nThe group behind DarkSide announced its new ransomware operation via a press release on\ntheir Tor domain in August 2020. Up until this point, some researchers have claimed that the\ngroup has earned over one million USD; however, Digital Shadows cannot corroborate a\ndefinite figure at the time of this report. Possibly in an attempt to underline their experience,\nthey made a point to clarify that the DarkSide operation isn’t their first criminal experience;\nthe campaign was developed to refine existing products into the ultimate ransomware tool.\n\n_Figure 2: DarkSide press release announcing a new ransomware campaign_\nThe press release stated several ethical principles that guide the group’s decision process\nregarding their potential targets; they claim that the DarkSide operation will never target\ncritical and vulnerable bodies such as schools, hospitals, or even governments. We’ve seen\nother groups claim to stay away from specific sectors (ahem… Maze); however, a recently\nunattributed ransomware attack, which targeted Duesseldorf University Hospital, may have\n\n\n-----\n\ninadvertently caused a woman to lose her life. With these tragic concerns in mind, we ll see if\nthey stick to their plan. To go even further, the group behind DarkSide states their intent to\nselect their targets based on their financial revenue. This method implies that a ransom price\nis modeled around the victim organization’s net income.\n\n[The operators behind DarkSide harvest the clear text data from their victim’s server before](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/)\nencrypting it and requesting a ransom. The stolen data is then uploaded to DarkSide’s leak\nwebsite, which serves as a powerful extortion tool for the threat group. The targeted\ncompany risks sensitive data loss after a successful attack, and not to mention, a public\nbreach can severely damage an organization’s reputation. If this tactic sounds familiar to\n[you, you’re right on the money – we’ve been closely following the pay-or-get-breached trend](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/ransomware-trends-in-q2-how-threat-intelligence-helps/)\nsince late 2019.\n\n_Figure 3: Digital Shadows intelligence alert about an organization affected by DarkSide_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: DarkSide exfiltration and encryption claims on their dark website_\n\n## They’re only interested in stealing from the rich\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, other ransomware operators have claimed to remove specific\nsectors from their attack itinerary. DarkSide’s claim to avoid attacking companies within the\neducation, healthcare, and government sectors can appear professional and respectable.\nNonetheless, some promises are broken, and it is yet to be seen whether DarkSide will\nmaintain its stated intentions.\n\nDarkSide has additionally claimed that they choose their targets and determine a suitable\nransom based on an organization’s financial revenue. It’s unconfirmed where DarkSide\nsources their organizational finance information from; however, Digital Shadows has found\nthat, like many other ransomware operators, they may leverage relevant details from\n[ZoomInfo.](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/not-another-ransomware-blog-initial-access-brokers-and-their-role/)\n\n## Upping the ante with customized ransomware executables\n\nDarkSide’s operators customize the ransomware executable for the specific company they\nare attacking, indicating that they customize each attack for maximum effectiveness. The\nransomware executes a PowerShell command that deletes Shadow Volume Copies on the\nsystem. DarkSide then proceeds to terminate various databases, applications, and mail\nclients to prepare for encryption. However, the following processes are avoided:\n\nVmcompute.exe\nVmms.exe\nVmwp exe\n\n\n-----\n\nSvchost.exe\nTeamViewer.exe\nExplorer.exe\n\nAlthough unconfirmed, it is realistically possible that the operators use TeamViewer for\nremote access to computers, as it is rare that this process would be avoided.\n\nEach customized executable includes a personalized ransom note, which consists of the\namount of data that was stolen, the type of data, and a link to the data on the group’s data\nleak site, where victims’ information is leaked if a ransom demand is not met. While the site\nonly references one compromised organization at the time of this blog, we plan to keep an\neye on this group. In the meantime, we have listed DarkSide’s current indicators of\ncompromise (IoCs) and their associated MITRE ATT&CK techniques at the end of this blog.\n\n## Press releases make it look more professional, right?\n\nDarkSide attempts to build trust with the victim and the other actors involved by leveraging\nprofessional communication methods. Over time, we have found that trust plays a pivotal\nrole in the cybercriminal world and often determines the possibilities of an entity’s growth and\nexpansion. For example, the English-language marketplace, Empire, had long represented a\ntrust stronghold on the dark web, favoring its establishment in the underground scene – until\nrecently, when rumors of a possible exit scam started to circulate and gain increasing\ntraction.\n\nThe use of a press release to announce a new ransomware operation is a symbol of the\nthreat actor’s intentions and maintains a dual-use:\n\n1. Usually, only corporations and institutions use press releases; they project the\n\nimpression of dealing with a professional body. In this case, a press release may\nconvince the victim to trust the threat actor and pay the requested ransom.\n2. Press releases attract media attention and ultimately weaponize stolen data, leading to\n\nsevere reputational damage to a targeted organization.\n\nThis operation isn’t the first time a threat group has used a press release to communicate its\nlatest operations or threaten a victim. Many of us remember the campaigns conducted by\n“thedarkoverlord” in 2016 and 2017, which leveraged press releases in the wake of their\nattacks. Even more recently, in May 2020, REvil ransomware operators posted press\nreleases to pressure their victims, which overtly named the compromised organizations and\nclaimed to double their ransoms.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: REvil ransomware operators’ press release_\n\n## Looking forward: Ransomware, Inc.\n\nAlthough this operation displays a unique combination of tactics, communication, and ethical\nclaims, DarkSide merely seems to be the latest product belonging to the growing trend of\nransomware professionalization.\n\nAs RaaC continues to remain a popular method due to its rewarding financial return, we plan\nto see new threat groups with differing technical capabilities entering the ransomware\nThunderdome. Whether or not they’ll succeed in breaking the mold – only time will tell. While\n[the cyber threat landscape can be unpredictable and volatile, a trend is a trend, and we will](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/ransomware-trends-in-q2-how-threat-intelligence-helps/)\ncontinue to monitor the cybercriminal bandwagon closely.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nMD5: 1a1ea6418811d0dc0b4eea66f0d348f0\n\nMD5: 25bb5ae5bb6a2201e980a590ef6be561\n\nSHA256: 9cee5522a7ca2bfca7cd3d9daba23e9a30deb6205f56c12045839075f7627297\n\nFILENAME: acer.exe\n\nSHA1: d1dfe82775c1d698dd7861d6dfa1352a74551d35\n\nMD5: f87a2e1c3d148a67eaeb696b1ab69133\n\nFILEPATH: Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}\n\nFILENAME: README.[victim’s_ID].TXT\n\nFILENAME: Win32 EXE\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\nValid Accounts (T1078)\n\nPowerShell (T1086)\n\nSystem Services: Service Execution (T1569)\n\nAccount Manipulation (T1098)\n\nProcess Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055)\n\nAccount Discovery (T1087)\n\nAbuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Access Control (T1548)\n\nFile Permissions Modification (T1222)\n\nData Encrypted for Impact (T1486)\n\nInhibit System Recovery (T1490)\n\nSystem Information Discovery (T1082)\n\nProcess Discovery (T1057)\n\nScreen Capture (T1113)\n\nCompile After Delivery (T1500)\n\n\n-----\n\nService Execution (T1035)\n\nAccount Manipulation (T1098)\n\nCredentials in Registry (T1214)\n\nTags: [Cyber Threats /](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/tag/cyber-threats/) [DarkSide /](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/tag/darkside/) [Ransomware](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/tag/ransomware/)\n\n\n-----",
