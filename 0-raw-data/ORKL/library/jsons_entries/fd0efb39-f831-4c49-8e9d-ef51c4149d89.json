For such a reson I feel\nlike I have to contribute in somehow to the community by giving what I can on this topic. So,\nthis is my little contribution to fight CONTI ransomware: an API block cheat sheet. In other\nwords by reading such a flow you should have the main CONTI functionalities mapped by\nAPI call blocks. It might help you in the following ways:\n\nTo learn how the current CONTI ransomware works (if you had no chance to reverse it)\nTo extract behavioural models for your Manchine Learning engine\nTo synthetize API call signatures for your dynamic detection engine\nExtract behavioural patterns for your SIEM\n\n\n-----\n\nCONTI Ransomware Cheat Sheet\nThe Execution flow is represented by the long up-to-down raws and it runs from left to right.\nThe main API calls are included into rectangles while the conditional jumps are mapped into\ndiamonds. Next to specific rectangles (API Calls) a little note is giving further details on the\nanalyzed step. Square brackets wraps API calls into blocks so that you might easily read the\nsix logic CONTI steps, that are: Preparation, System Information, Find and Delete Shadow\nCopies, Looking for External Targets (shared folders), Encryption Preparation (ransom note\nincluded) and Encryption Execution.\n\nOne-Time\nMonthly\n\n**Make a one-time donation**\n\n**Make a monthly donation**\n\nChoose an amount\n\n€1.00\n€5.00\n€10.00\n€5.00\n€15.00\n€100.00\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you think this content is helpful, please consider to make a little donation.
