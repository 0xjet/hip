Many of the threats faced by gamers are associated with loss\nof personal data, and particularly, accounts with various gaming services.\n\nThis tendency is not unique to PC or mobile games or to the gaming industry as a whole.\nNevertheless, as games offer users plenty of in-game goodies and even feature their own\ncurrencies, gaming accounts are of particular interest to cybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this report, we take a closer look at threats linked to loss of accounts with popular video\ngame digital distribution services, such as Steam and Origin. We also explore the kind of\ngame-related data that ends up on the black market and the prices.\n\n## Background\n\nIn March 2021, we noticed an advertisement for malware named “BloodyStealer” on a\nRussian-speaking underground forum. According to the ad, BloodyStealer was a malicious\nstealer capable of fetching session data and passwords, and cookie exfiltration, and\nprotected against reverse engineering and malware analysis in general. A buyer can use\nTelegram channels as well as traditional web panels for communication with the C&C. The\nauthor offered potential customers to get in touch via Telegram. The price of BloodyStealer is\n700 RUB (less than $10) for one month or 3000 RUB (approx. $40) for lifetime.\n\n**_The BloodyStealer ad (Source:_** **_[https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog)](https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog/status/1380087553676697617)_**\n\nThe ad highlights the following features of BloodyStealer (translated from Russian as is):\n\n_Grabber for cookies, passwords, forms, bank cards from browsers_\n_Stealer for all information about the PC and screenshots_\n_Steals sessions from the following clients: Bethesda, Epic Games, GOG, Origin,_\n_Steam, Telegram, VimeWorld_\n_Steals files from the desktop (.txt) and the uTorrent client_\n_Collects logs from the memory_\n_Duplicate logging protection_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Reverse engineering protection_\n_Not functional in the CIS_\n\nWhat caught our attention is BloodyStealer’s capability to fetch information related to\ncomputer games installed on an infected system. BloodyStealer targets major online gaming\nplatforms, such as Steam, Epic Games Store, EA Origin, etc.\n\nAt the time of our investigation, the forum thread related to BloodyStealer was publicly\nunavailable, but the analysis of visible information on the forum revealed that discussions\nrelating to BloodyStealer still continued in private channels. This, along with the fact that\nvisible stealer activity had been observed since its release, suggested that the threat actor\nbehind BloodyStealer had decided to offer its product only to VIP members of underground\nforums.\n\nKaspersky products detect the threat as Trojan-Spy.MSIL.Stealer.gen. For additional\ntechnical information about BloodyStealer (malicious techniques, YARA rules, etc.), please\ncontact financialintel@kaspersky.com.\n\n## BloodyStealer technical details\n\n### Anti-analysis\n\nDuring our research, we were able to identify several anti-analysis methods that were used\nto complicate reverse engineering and analysis of BloodyStealer, including the usage of\npackers and anti-debugging techniques. As the stealer is sold on the underground market,\nevery customer can protect their sample with a packer of their choice or include it into a\nmultistage infection chain. We had been monitoring BloodyStealer since its announcement,\nso we were able to notice that the majority of the BloodyStealer samples were protected with\n[a commercial solution named “AgileNet”.](https://secureteam.net/docs/Configuring-the-Protection-Process)\n\nWhile analyzing samples discovered in the wild, we found that some of them were protected\nnot only with AgileNet but also with other, very popular, protection tools for the .NET\nenvironment, such as Confuser.\n\n### Victim identification, communication with the C&C and data exfiltration\n\nBloodyStealer is capable of assigning a unique identifier to every infected victim. The\nidentifier is created by extracting data, such as the GUID and serial number (SID) of the\nsystem. This information is extracted at runtime. Besides this identification, BloodyStealer\nextracts the public IP address of the C&C by requesting the information from the domain\nwhatleaks[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_The request used to get the public IP_**\n\nAfter assigning a UID to the victim and getting the C&C IP address, BloodyStealer extracts\nvarious data from the infected machine, creates a POST request with information about the\nexfiltrated data, and sends it to the malicious C&C. The data itself is sent to the configured\nC&C server later as a non-protected ZIP archive and has the structure shown below.\n\nThe IP address configured in the infected system is used as the name of the ZIP archive.\n\n### BloodyStealer as part of a multistage infection chain\n\nIn our analysis of BloodyStealer samples, we found out how various threat actors who had\nacquired this product decided to use the stealer as a part of other malware execution chains,\nfor example, KeyBase or Agent Tesla. The criminals who combined the stealer component\nwith other malware families also protected BloodyStealer with other packers, such as\nThemida.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_BloodyStealer as used alongside other malware families or hacking tools_**\n\nBased on the price that BloodyStealer is fetching on the underground market, we can expect\nthat it will be used in combination with other popular malware families.\n\n### Command and Control\n\nAs mentioned above, BloodyStealer sends all exfiltrated data to a C&C server.\nCybercriminals can access the data by using Telegram or via a web panel. The collected\ndata can then be sold to other cybercriminals, who in turn will try to monetize it.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_BloodyStealer C&C login page (Source:_** **_[https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog)](https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog/status/1380089054428024833)_**\n\nWhen a criminal is logged in to the C&C web panel, they will see a basic dashboard with\nvictim-related statistics.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_BloodyStealer stats dashboard (Source:_** **_[https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog)](https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog/status/1380087558252736513)_**\n\nWhile pivoting through the structure used for allocating the content panel, we were able to\nidentify the second C&C server located at\n\nhxxp://gwrg23445b235245ner.mcdir[.]me/4/654/login.php\n\nBoth C&C servers are placed behind Cloudflare, which hides their original IPs and provides a\nlayer of protection against DDoS and web attacks.\n\n### Victimology\n\nBloodyStealer is still quite new on the market when compared to other existent malware\ntools; however, by analyzing available telemetry data, we have found detections of\nBloodyStealer in Europe, Latin America and the APAC region. At the time of the\ninvestigation, we observed that BloodyStealer mostly affected home users.\n\n## Next links in the chain: darknet markets\n\nUnfortunately, BloodyStealer is just one example of stealers targeting gamers. With many\nmore in use, cybercriminals gather a significant number of game-related logs, login\ncredentials, and other data, spurring a well-developed supply and demand chain for stolen\ncredentials on the dark web. In this section, we will dig deeper into the dark gaming market\nand look at the types of game-related items available there.\n\nOur experts, who specialize in understanding what goes on on the dark web, conducted\nresearch on the current state of user data as a commodity on these platforms to find out\nwhat kind of personal data is in demand, what it is used for, and how much it costs. For the\n\n\n-----\n\npurposes of this report, we analyzed active offers on twelve international darknet forums and\nmarketplaces that use English or Russian.\n\n### Wholesale deals\n\nDark web sellers provide a broad variety of goods, sold both wholesale and retail.\nSpecifically, one of the most popular wholesale products is logs.\n\n**_In these examples, cybercriminals offer logs: an archive containing more than 65,000_**\n**_logs for 150$ and packages with 1,000 private logs for 300$_**\n\nLogs are credentials that are needed for accessing an account. These typically take the form\nof saved browser cookies, information about server logins, screenshots of the desktop, etc.\nThey are the key for accessing victims’ accounts. Logs might be outdated, contain only old\ngame sessions or even have no account-related data. That is why they need to be checked\nbefore use. In the chain of log sales, there are several roles.\n\nFirstly, there are people who steal logs with the help of botnets or phishing schemes. These\nare the operators. The operators might have thousands of collected logs in their clouds, but\nthis whole data stream needs to be validated. To process the logs, the cybercriminal needs\nto check whether the login and password combination is still relevant, how many days have\npassed since the last password or email change (that is, whether the victim has found out\nthat the account was stolen) and check the balance. The fraudsters might do it on their own,\nbut this may prove quite time-consuming with thousands of logs to go through. For this, there\nare log checkers: cybercriminals who own special tools for processing logs. The software\ncollects statistics about processed logs, and the checker gets a share of the profits: typically,\n40%.\n\nIt is possible to purchase logs per unit and process them manually or purchase in bulk and\nprocess with the help of specialized services. The average price per log is 34¢; the price per\n100 logs is $17.83.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_This advertiser is offering a batch of logs for $25,000 to one person but makes no_**\n**_mention of the volume of data_**\n\nThere are also fraudsters who have websites with a large coverage, offering to place links to\nmalware as a way of distribution. In their ads on the darknet, these fraudsters attach traffic\nand download statistics to attract more customers.\n\n### Retail options\n\nIf the cybercriminal specializes in small sales (two to ten items), then the type of goods they\noffer on the darknet will include certain games, in-game items, and accounts with popular\ngaming platforms. Importantly, these products are typically offered at just 60-70% of their\noriginal price, so customers get a good deal on darknet markets. Some criminals can\npossess thousands of accounts and offer access to these at an enormous discount, as many\nof these accounts are useless: some cost nothing, and others have already been recovered\nby their original owners.\n\n**_A person is offering thousands of usernames and passwords for various game_**\n**_platforms for just $4000_**\n\n\n-----\n\nDark web sellers offer stolen accounts, the important selection criteria being the number of\ngames available in the account and how long ago the account was created. Games and addons are not cheap, and this is where cybercriminals enter the fray, offering the same popular\ngames at significantly lower prices. In addition to Steam, accounts on gaming platforms,\nsuch as Origin, Ubisoft Store, GOG, Battle.net, also get stolen and resold.\n\n**_A seller is offering in-game items. The original price is $20.5, but customers can get_**\n**_these illegally for $16.45._**\n\nIn addition to certain games and accounts, cybercriminals also sell rare equipment from a\nwide range of games with a discount 30-40% off the original price. This is possible if the\nSteam account that owns the items has no restrictions on sending gifts to other players, e.g.,\nno email confirmation requirement.\n\nSome cybercriminals also sell so-called “Steam balance”. Depending on the origin, Steam\nbalance can be “white” or “black”. White means sold from the seller’s own account. A player\ncould get tired of the game and decide to sell their account, along with all associated ingame goodies, offering it on the black market, as Valve does not approve this kind of deals.\nAccounts like that can be used for illegal activity, such as fraud or money laundering as they\ndo not – yet – look suspicious to Steam. Black balance means that the Steam accounts were\nobtained illegally, e.g., through phishing, social engineering or other cybercriminal\ntechniques. Cybercriminals do their best to withdraw money by buying Steam cards, in-game\nitems, gifts, etc., before the original owners retake control of their property with the help of\nthe support service.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_A person is outlining a scheme for stealing accounts with the help of PUBG phishing_**\n**_pages_**\n\nBesides buying goods, darknet forum visitors can also purchase access to phishing\ninstruments, which is a less popular offer. As you can see in the screenshot, the\ncybercriminal is offering a tool named “Black Mafia”. Phishing tools can even be downloaded\nfrom GitHub, after accepting the condition that these will be used for educational purposes\nonly.\n\nA criminal can use the tool for creating a phishing link and sending it to an unsuspecting\nvictim. This generally follows the tried and tested flow: the victim clicks the link and inputs\ntheir credentials, which then end up in the hands of the fraudsters.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis overview demonstrates the structure of the game log and login stealing business. With\nthe gaming industry growing, we do not expect this cybercriminal activity to wane in the\nfuture – on the opposite, this is the area in which we are likely to see more attacks as tools\nfor targeting gamers continue to develop. BloodyStealer is a prime example of an advanced\ntool used by cybercriminals to penetrate the gaming market. With its efficient anti-detection\ntechniques and attractive pricing, it is sure to be seen in combination with other malware\nfamilies soon. Furthermore, with its interesting capabilities, such as extraction of browser\npasswords, cookies, and environment information as well as grabbing information related to\nonline gaming platforms, BloodyStealer provides value in terms of data that can be stolen\nfrom gamers and later sold on the darknet. The overview of game-related goods sold on the\ndarknet forums, too, confirms that this is a lucrative niche for cybercriminals. With online\ngaming platform accounts holding valuable in-game goods and currency, these become a\njuicy target. Although purchasing accounts is a gamble, as these may or may not contain\ngoods that can be sold, cybercriminals are willing to take a bet – and are certain to find\ncustomers that are looking to save on entertainment.\n\nTo minimize the risks of losing your gaming account, follow these simple tips:\n\nWherever possible, protect your accounts with two-factor authentication. For others,\ncomb through account settings.\n\n\n-----\n\nA strong, reliable security solution will be a great help to you, especially if it will not\nslow down your computer while you are playing. At the same time, it will protect you\n[from all possible cyberthreats. We recommend Kaspersky Total Security. It works](https://www.kaspersky.com/total-security)\nsmoothly with Steam and other gaming services.\nIt is safer to buy games on official sites only and wait for the sales – these take place\nfairly often and are typically tied to big holidays such as Halloween, Christmas, Saint\nValentine’s Day, so you will not be sitting on your hands for long.\nTry to avoid buying the first thing that pops up. Even during Steam’s summer sale,\nbefore forking out the dough for a little-known title, at least read some reviews of it. If\nsomething is fishy, people will probably have figured it out.\nBeware of phishing campaigns and unfamiliar gamers contacting you. It is a good idea\nto double-check before clicking website links you receive via email and the extensions\nof files you are about to open.\nTry not to click on any links to external sites from the game chat, and carefully check\nthe address of any resource that requests you to enter your username and password:\nthe page may be fake.\n\n[Cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/cybercrime/)\n[Darknet](https://securelist.com/tag/darknet/)\n[Data theft](https://securelist.com/tag/data-theft/)\n[Gaming malware](https://securelist.com/tag/gaming-malware/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Social engineering](https://securelist.com/tag/social-engineering/)\n[Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Leonid Bezvershenko](https://securelist.com/author/leonidbezvershenko/)\n\n[Dmitry Galov](https://securelist.com/author/dmitrygalov/)\n\n[Marc Rivero](https://securelist.com/author/marcrivero/)\n\nBloodyStealer and gaming assets for sale\n\nYour email address will not be published.
