    "plain_text": "[For a long time the Winnti group had been considered as a Chinese threat actor targeting gaming](https://securelist.com/analysis/internal-threats-reports/37029/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/)\n\ncompanies specifically. Recently, we’ve seen information indicating that the scope of targets can be wider\n\nand is no longer limited to the entertainment business. We actually track samples of Winnti malware all\n\nthe time, but so far we haven’t been able to catch one with solid clues indicating other targeted industries.\n\nAlso our visibility as a vendor does not cover every company in the world (at least so far ;)) and the\n\nKaspersky Security Network (KSN) did not reveal other attacks except those against gaming companies.\n\nWell, sometimes targeted entities have included telecommunication companies, or better, large holdings,\n\nbut it seems that at least one of their businesses was in some way related to the production or distribution\n\nof computer games.\n\n[In April Novetta released its excellent report on the Winnti malware spotted in the operations of Axiom](http://www.novetta.com/2015/04/operation-smn-winnti-update/)\n\ngroup. The Axiom group has been presented as an advanced Chinese threat actor carrying out cyber\nespionage attacks against a whole range of different industries. For us, the Novetta report was another\n\nsource of intelligence that Winnti was already expanding beyond online games. One of the recent Winnti\n\nsamples we found appears to confirm this as well.\n\nThe new sample belongs to one of the Winnti versions described in Novetta’s report – Winnti 3.0. This is\n\none of the Dynamic Link Libraries composing this RAT (Remote Access Trojan) platform – the worker\n\nlibrary (which in essence is the RAT DLL) with the internal name w64.dll and the exported functions\n\n_work_end and work_start. Since, as usual, this component is stored on the disk with the strings and_\n\nmuch of other data in the PE header removed/zeroed, it is impossible to restore the compilation date of\n\nthis DLL. But this library includes two drivers compiled on August 22 and September 4, 2014. The sample\n\nhas an encrypted configuration block placed in overlay. This block may include a tag for the sample –\n\nusually it is a campaign ID or victim ID/name. This time the operators put such tag in the configuration\n\nand it turned out to be the name of the well-known global pharmaceutical company\n\n**headquartered in Europe:**\n\n**_Pic.1 Configuration block_**\n\nBesides the sample tag, the configuration block includes the names of other files involved in the working\n\n\n-----\n\nof the following files could indicate that the system has been compromised:\n\n_C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\tmpCCD.tmp_\n\n_ServiceAdobe.dll_\n\n_ksadobe.dat_\n\nOne of the mentioned drivers (a known, malicious Winnti network rootkit) was signed with a stolen\n\n**certificate of a division of a huge Japanese conglomerate. Although this division is involved in**\n\nmicroelectronics manufacturing, other business directions of the conglomerate include development\n\n**and production of drugs as well as medical equipment.**\n\nAlthough the nature of the involvement of Winnti operators, who were earlier perceived to be a threat only\n\nto the online gaming industry, in the activities of other cyber-espionage teams still remains rather\n\nobscure, the evidence is there. From now on, when you see Winnti mentioned, don’t think just about\n\ngaming companies; consider also at least targeted telecoms and big pharma companies.\n\nHere are the samples in question:\n\n**_8e61219b18d36748ce956099277cc29b – Backdoor.Win64.Winnti.gy_**\n\n**_5979cf5018c03be2524b87b7dda64a1a – Backdoor.Win64.Winnti.gf_**\n\n**_ac9b247691b1036a1cdb4aaf37bea97f – Rootkit.Win64.Winnti.ai_**\n\n\n-----",
