The\ntools enable them to scan for, compromise, and control affected devices once they have\nestablished initial access to the operational technology (OT) network. Additionally, the actors\ncan compromise Windows-based engineering workstations, which may be present in\ninformation technology (IT) or OT environments, using an exploit that compromises an\nASRock motherboard driver with known vulnerabilities. By compromising and maintaining full\nsystem access to ICS/SCADA devices, APT actors could elevate privileges, move laterally\nwithin an OT environment, and disrupt critical devices or functions.\n\nDOE, CISA, NSA, and the FBI urge critical infrastructure organizations, especially Energy\nSector organizations, to implement the detection and mitigation recommendations provided\nin this CSA to detect potential malicious APT activity and harden their ICS/SCADA devices.\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-103A_APT_Cyber_Tools_Targeting_ICS_SCADA_Devices.pdf)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT actors have developed custom-made tools that, once they have established initial\naccess in an OT network, enables them to scan for, compromise, and control certain\nICS/SCADA devices, including the following:\n\nSchneider Electric MODICON and MODICON Nano PLCs, including (but may not be\nlimited to) TM251, TM241, M258, M238, LMC058, and LMC078;\nOMRON Sysmac NJ and NX PLCs, including (but may not be limited to) NEX NX1P2,\nNX-SL3300, NX-ECC203, NJ501-1300, S8VK, and R88D-1SN10F-ECT; and\nOPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers.\n\nThe APT actors’ tools have a modular architecture and enable cyber actors to conduct highly\nautomated exploits against targeted devices. The tools have a virtual console with a\ncommand interface that mirrors the interface of the targeted ICS/SCADA device. Modules\ninteract with targeted devices, enabling operations by lower-skilled cyber actors to emulate\nhigher-skilled actor capabilities.\n\nThe APT actors can leverage the modules to scan for targeted devices, conduct\nreconnaissance on device details, upload malicious configuration/code to the targeted\ndevice, back up or restore device contents, and modify device parameters.\n\nIn addition, the APT actors can use a tool that installs and exploits a known-vulnerable\nASRock-signed motherboard driver, `AsrDrv103.sys, exploiting CVE-2020-15368 to`\nexecute malicious code in the Windows kernel. Successful deployment of this tool can allow\nAPT actors to move laterally within an IT or OT environment and disrupt critical devices or\nfunctions.\n\n**APT Tool for Schneider Electric Devices**\n\nThe APT actors’ tool for Schneider Electric devices has modules that interact via normal\nmanagement protocols and Modbus (TCP 502). Modules may allow cyber actors to:\n\nRun a rapid scan that identifies all Schneider PLCs on the local network via User\nDatagram Protocol (UDP) multicast with a destination port of 27127 (Note: UDP 27127\nis a standard discovery scan used by engineering workstations to discover PLCs and\nmay not be indicative of malicious activity);\nBrute-force Schneider Electric PLC passwords using CODESYS and other available\ndevice protocols via UDP port 1740 against defaults or a dictionary word list (Note: this\ncapability may work against other CODESYS-based devices depending on individual\ndesign and function, and this report will be updated as more information becomes\navailable);\nConduct a denial-of-service attack to prevent network communications from reaching\nthe PLC;\nSever connections, requiring users to re-authenticate to the PLC, likely to facilitate\ncapture of credentials;\n\n\n-----\n\nConduct a packet of death attack to crash the PLC until a power cycle and\nconfiguration recovery is conducted; and\nSend custom Modbus commands (Note: this capability may work against Modbus other\nthan in Schneider Electric PLCs).\n\nRefer to the appendix for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with this\ntool.\n\n**APT Tool for OMRON**\n\nThe APT actors’ tool for OMRON devices has modules that can interact by:\n\nScanning for OMRON using Factory Interface Network Service (FINS) protocol;\nParsing the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response from OMRON devices;\nRetrieving the media access control (MAC) address of the device;\nPolling for specific devices connected to the PLC;\nBacking up/restoring arbitrary files to/from the PLC; and\nLoading a custom malicious agent on OMRON PLCs for additional attacker-directed\ncapability.\n\nAdditionally, the OMRON modules can upload an agent that allows a cyber actor to connect\nand initiate commands—such as file manipulation, packet captures, and code execution—via\nHTTP and/or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).\n\nRefer to the appendix for TTPs associated with this tool.\n\n**APT Tool for OPC UA**\n\nThe APT actors’ tool for OPC UA has modules with basic functionality to identify OPC UA\nservers and to connect to an OPC UA server using default or previously compromised\ncredentials. The client can read the OPC UA structure from the server and potentially write\ntag values available via OPC UA.\n\nThe threat from this tool can be significantly reduced by properly configuring OPC UA\nsecurity. Refer to the Mitigations below for more information.\n\nRefer to the appendix for TTPs associated with this tool.\n\n## Mitigations\n\n**Note: these mitigations are provided to enable network defenders to begin efforts to protect**\nsystems and devices from new capabilities. They have not been verified against every\nenvironment and should be tested prior to implementing.\n\nDOE, CISA, NSA, and the FBI recommend all organizations with ICS/SCADA devices\nimplement the following proactive mitigations:\n\n\n-----\n\nIsolate ICS/SCADA systems and networks from corporate and internet networks using\nstrong perimeter controls, and limit any communications entering or leaving\nICS/SCADA perimeters.\nEnforce multifactor authentication for all remote access to ICS networks and devices\nwhenever possible.\nHave a cyber incident response plan, and exercise it regularly with stakeholders in IT,\ncybersecurity, and operations.\nChange all passwords to ICS/SCADA devices and systems on a consistent schedule,\nespecially all default passwords, to device-unique strong passwords to mitigate\npassword brute force attacks and to give defender monitoring systems opportunities to\ndetect common attacks.\nEnsure OPC UA security is correctly configured with application authentication enabled\nand explicit trust lists.\nEnsure the OPC UA certificate private keys and user passwords are stored securely.\nMaintain known-good offline backups for faster recovery upon a disruptive attack, and\nconduct hashing and integrity checks on firmware and controller configuration files to\nensure validity of those backups.\nLimit ICS/SCADA systems’ network connections to only specifically allowed\nmanagement and engineering workstations.\nRobustly protect management systems by configuring Device Guard, Credential Guard,\nand Hypervisor Code Integrity (HVCI). Install Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)\nsolutions on these subnets and ensure strong anti-virus file reputation settings are\nconfigured.\nImplement robust log collection and retention from ICS/SCADA systems and\nmanagement subnets.\nLeverage a continuous OT monitoring solution to alert on malicious indicators and\nbehaviors, watching internal systems and communications for known hostile actions\nand lateral movement. For enhanced network visibility to potentially identify abnormal\ntraffic, consider using CISA’s open-source Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol\nParsers (ICSNPP).\nEnsure all applications are only installed when necessary for operation.\nEnforce principle of least privilege. Only use admin accounts when required for tasks,\nsuch as installing software updates.\nInvestigate symptoms of a denial of service or connection severing, which exhibit as\ndelays in communications processing, loss of function requiring a reboot, and delayed\nactions to operator comments as signs of potential malicious activity.\nMonitor systems for loading of unusual drivers, especially for ASRock driver if no\nASRock driver is normally used on the system.\n\n## Resources\n\nFor additional guidance on securing OT devices, see\n\n\n-----\n\n[Layering Network Security Through Segmentation,](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/layering-network-security-segmentation_infographic_508_0.pdf)\n[Stop Malicious Cyber Activity Against Connected Operational Technology, and](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/29/2002630479/-1/-1/0/CSA_STOP-MCA-AGAINST-OT_UOO13672321.PDF)\nNSA and CISA Recommend Immediate Actions to Reduce Exposure Across\nOperational Technologies and Control Systems.\n\nFor additional guidance on securing OPC UA enabled devices, see:\n\n[Practical Security Recommendations for building OPC UA Applications](https://opcfoundation.org/UA/Security/BestPractices.pdf)\n\nFor more information on APT actors’ tools and TTPs, refer to:\n\nMandiant’s Blog – INCONTROLLER: New State-Sponsored Cyber Attack Tools Target\nMultiple Industrial Control Systems\nDragos’ Blog – CHERNOVITE'S PIPEDREAM: Malware Targeting Industrial Control\nSystems\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.
