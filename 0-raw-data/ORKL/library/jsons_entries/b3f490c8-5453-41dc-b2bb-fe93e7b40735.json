Purpose. This ITG provides the basic criteria guidance concerning the implementation of Cybersecurity to Facility-Related Control Systems for projects currently under design and construction.\n\n 2. Background. A control system (CS) typically consists of network capable digital controllers and user interfaces that are used to monitor and possibly control equipment. There are many types of control systems ranging from building control systems to manufacturing control systems to weapon control systems, all with different names and terminology. Facility-related control systems are a subset of control systems that are used to monitor and control equipment and systems, such as building control systems, utility control systems, electronic security systems, and fire and life safety systems. Per the requirements of References (a) and (b), facility control systems must be cybersecured.\n\n a. CNIC and NAVFAC issued reference (c) to inventory, assess, interim secure, secure, and continuously monitor all facility control systems on Navy installations in their respective regions.\n\n b. This effort will be conducted largely by the Echelon IV NAVFAC Public Works (PW) and the Command Information Office\n ( CIO) .\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3. Discussion.\n\n a. For projects currently under design and construction, ITG 2017-01, through UFGS 25 50 00.00 20,incorporates elements of the NAVFAC Cybersecurity Hygiene Checklist into contract specifications for control systems. These elements will facilitate achieving an Interim Secure cybersecurity level and lessens the effort for PW/CIO when these facilities are accepted into the CNIC inventory. The elements of the Cybersecurity Hygiene Checklist do not require extensive design or construction effort.\n\n b. Reference (d), UFC 4-010-06, CYBERSECURITY OF FACILITY- RELATED CONTROL SYSTEMS was issued 19 September 2016 and is available on the Whole Building Design Guide website (www.wbdg.org). The Tri-Service Unified Facility Guide Specification (UFGS) containing detailed cybersecurity requirements is not scheduled for release until early FY18 (November 2017).\n\n 4. Technical Guidance. ITG 2017-01, including UFGS 25 50 00.00 20, will remain in effect until the Tri-Service cybersecurity UFGS is posted on the Whole Building Design Guide in early FY18.\n\n 5. Action.\n\n a. This ITG applies to all design and construction, renovation, and repair of new and existing facilities currently under design and construction that result in DoN real property assets, regardless of funding source. Enclosure (1) contains UFGS 25 50 00.00 20, which requires the construction contractor to complete the Cybersecurity Hygiene Checklist. Coordinate requirements with other project specifications having facility-related control systems as required by enclosure (1) .\n\n b. Incorporate the requirements of UFGS 25 50 00.00 20 for all FY17 and earlier Navy MILCON (e.g., MCON, ECIP, and UMC) projects where project execution is\n\n i. In Design:\n\n 1. Beyond 35% design and without Design Release\n\n 2. Between Design Release and Contract Award (evaluate the impacts of a pre-award amendment versus a post-award modification)\n\n ii. In Construction:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 1. Prior to DBB Pre-Construction Meeting/DB Final Design Acceptance (post award modification)\n\n 2. Between DBB Pre-Construction Meeting/DB Post-Award Kick-off Meeting and RedZone meeting only if there are not significant project impacts to schedule and cost (post-award modification)\n\n c. Incorporate the requirements of UFGS 25 50 00.00 20 for all non-MILCON Navy (e.g . , O&M,N) projects where project execution is:\n\n i. Beyond 35% design and without Design Release\n\n ii. Between Design Release and DBB Pre-Construction Meeting/DB Post Award Kickoff Meeting (evaluate the impacts of a pre-award amendment versus a post-award modification)\n\n##### iii. Between DBB Pre-Construction Meeting/DB Post-Award\n###### Kick-off Meeting and RedZone meeting only if there are not significant project impacts to schedule and cost (post-award modification)\n\n 6. Coordination. This ITG has been coordinated with NAVFAC Mechanical, Electrical, and Fire Protection Engineering (CI4) communities of practice. ITGs are published by the NAVFAC Engineering Criteria and Programs Office (Cil) as part of the NAVFAC Criteria Program and are available in PDF and Specsintact format on the WBDG at https://www.wbdg.org/ffc/navy-navfac/interim-technical-guidance-itg.\n\n 7.
