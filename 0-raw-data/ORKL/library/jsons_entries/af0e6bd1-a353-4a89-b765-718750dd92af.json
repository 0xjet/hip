Therein, a seemingly ordinary high school student, with a keen sense of curiosity, uses esoteric magic to\nhack into the U.S. Department of Defense using just a phone line and an acoustic coupler. Having made a connection,\nhe meets the AI-powered NORAD computer known as the WOPR (or Joshua). The WOPR’s primary job is running war\nsimulations for the government, but Joshua also moonlights as a loveable tic-tac-toe opponent thanks to a set of easter\neggs implanted by its creator. This moment in movie history came to mind as we took on this review, just as AI and\nlarge language models are being incorporated into systems globally. We see one other, more obvious, parallel:\nteenagers are compromising well-defended organizations using a creative application of many techniques. Not much\nseems to have changed in the last 40 years. Yet, we saw a clear distinction that stood in stark relief as we dove deeper\ninto the details of the review: namely the vast global for-profit online criminal landscape that curious young people are\nnow encountering. Everything on this front has changed significantly.\n\nIn this review, the Board’s second, we focused on a loosely organized group of threat actors that styled itself as\nLapsus$ for a short period of time in 2021 - 2022. Lapsus$ drew the attention of cybersecurity professionals and the\npress almost immediately after providing unparalleled transparency into the inner workings of how it targeted\norganizations and individuals, organized its attacks, and interacted within itself and with other threat groups. Its\nmindset was on full display for the world to see and Lapsus$ made clear just how easy it was for its members\n(juveniles, in some instances) to infiltrate well-defended organizations. Lapsus$ seemed to work at various times for\nnotoriety, financial gain, or amusement, and blended a variety of techniques, some more complex than others, with\nflashes of creativity. But Lapsus$ did not fall into that category of threat actor that grabs most of the headlines: the\nnation-state threat actor with well-resourced offensive tactics that lurks behind the scenes for years at a time or the\ntransnational ransomware groups that cost the global economy billions of dollars. In fact, Lapsus$ did not use the type\nof novel zero-day techniques the industry is used to seeing frequently in the news.\n\nLapsus$ was not unique in the criminal landscape in which it operated; it had membership in common with other\nsimilarly motivated groups globally. But Lapsus$ was unique for its effectiveness, speed, creativity, and boldness; it\noperated in a way that gifted the Board a propitious lens through which we could see systemic issues in the digital\necosystem. Our attention was drawn immediately towards the identity and access management ecosystem; the way\nthreat actors abused telecommunications providers; the relationships between organizations and their outsourcing\ncompanies; and how the law enforcement ecosystem plays a vital role in deterrence.\n\nOrganizations must act now to protect themselves, and the Board identified tangible ways to do so, with the help of the\nU.S. government and the companies that are best prepared to provide safe-by-default solutions to uplift the whole\necosystem. Many of the Board’s recommendations come within the broader theme of “security by design,” reflecting\nthe larger industry conversation, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA’s) Secure by\nDesign[1] efforts.\n\nWe need better technologies that move us towards a passwordless world, negating the effects of credential theft. We\nneed telecommunications providers to design and implement processes and systems that keep attackers from\nhijacking mobile phone service. We need to double down on zero trust architectures that assume breach. We need\norganizations to design their security programs to cover not only their own information technology environments, but\nalso those of their vendors that host critical data or maintain direct network access. We need to give law enforcement\nthe means to disrupt all manner of threat actors. And we need to help curious young people use their growing digital\nskills for positive purposes. The Board developed actionable recommendations for all these issues and more.\n\nAs we reflect on our second review as an institution, we are proud that the Board has further proved this model of deep,\nafter-action reviews of the most significant incidents. The recommendations are strong and specific because we were\nable to draw from the diverse expertise of the Board’s public-private membership, including law enforcement, incident\nresponse experts, a critical infrastructure Chief Information Security Officer, and more.\n\n[1 CISA, “Secure by Design, Secure by Default,” https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ ii\n\n\n-----\n\nWe are grateful that, among the impacted companies, several cooperated actively with the Board’s work. Their\nperspectives were critical to the insights and recommendations in this review, and their contributions highlight the\npublic safety need for the Board to gather all information required to do our work effectively. We appreciate as well the\nvoluntary contributions of over 30 other companies, cybersecurity firms, law enforcement organizations, security\nresearchers, and academics that had insights to share. Unfortunately, some organizations that were known to have\nbeen impacted by Lapsus$ declined to participate in the review, limiting the Board’s opportunity to learn from a range\nof experiences that would have further enriched our work.\n\nEarlier this year, the Administration recommended that Congress authorize the Board and provide it with the\nappropriate authorities to ensure that the Board can gather the information needed to advise the cyber community—\nvoluntarily where possible, but with a limited subpoena authority as a backstop when necessary. We are hopeful that\nCongress will act quickly on this important legislation.\n\nWe are grateful to Alejandro N. Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security, for his continued belief in the important\nmission of this Board, and to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly for commissioning\nour second review and offering CISA’s resources and support to ensure the Board could conduct its independent work.\n\nFinally, we give thanks to the many companies and individual experts that offered their support to this comprehensive\nreview. We also express our sincere appreciation to our colleagues on the Board and the talented and dedicated staff\nthat has supported its work.\n\nWe look forward to our coming reviews. We will in the meantime continue to fortify the CSRB and its supporting\ninfrastructure, for this Board has become an enduring part of our cybersecurity ecosystem as a true public-private model.\n\nRobert Silvers Heather Adkins\nChair Deputy Chair\nCyber Safety Review Board Cyber Safety Review Board\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ iii\n\n\n-----\n\n### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nBeginning in late 2021 and continuing late into 2022, a globally active, extortion-focused cyber threat actor group\nattacked dozens of well-known companies and government agencies around the world. It penetrated corporate\nnetworks, stole source code, demanded payments while rarely following up, lodged political messages in shadowy\nonline forums, and swiftly moved on to its next targets. The cyberattacks were not the work of a nation-state actor, nor\ndid they always involve particularly complex or advanced tooling or methods. Yet the attacks were consistently effective\nagainst some of the most well-resourced and well-defended companies in the world. These headline-grabbing incidents\nwere perpetrated by a loosely organized threat actor group known as Lapsus$. Lapsus$ exploited systemic ecosystem\nweaknesses to infiltrate and extort organizations, sometimes appearing to do so for nothing more than attention and\npublic notoriety.\n\nLapsus$ operated against a backdrop of other criminal groups employing similar methods that were studied as part of\nthis review. These groups demonstrated the still-prevalent vulnerabilities in our cyber ecosystem. They showed\nadeptness in identifying weak points in the system—like downstream vendors or telecommunications providers—that\nallowed onward access to their intended victims. They also showed a special talent for social engineering, luring a\ntarget’s employees to essentially open the gates to the corporate network.\n\nLapsus$’s and similar groups’ success sounds a warning to organizations across the globe, shining a light on the\nfragility of our interconnected digital infrastructure. Lapsus$ exploited, to great and wide effect, a playbook of effective\ntechniques, which other threat actors can also use. If richly resourced cybersecurity programs were so easily breached\nby a loosely organized threat actor group, which included several juveniles, how can organizations expect their\nprograms to perform against well-resourced cybercrime syndicates and nation-state actors? The Cyber Safety Review\nBoard (CSRB, or the Board) therefore focused intently on what additional security controls and improvements can bring\nneeded change to the status quo.\n\nThe Board found that the multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementations used broadly in the digital ecosystem\ntoday are not sufficient for most organizations or consumers. In particular, the Board saw a collective failure to\nsufficiently account for and mitigate the risks associated with using Short Message Service (SMS) and voice calls for\nMFA. In several instances, attackers gained initial access to targeted organizations through Subscriber Identity Module\n(SIM) swapping attacks, which allowed them to intercept one-time passcodes and push notifications sent via SMS,\neffectively defeating this widely used MFA control. A lucrative SIM swap criminal market further enabled this pay-foraccess to a target’s mobile phone services. Despite these factors, adopting more advanced MFA capabilities remains a\nchallenge for many organizations and individual consumers due to workflow and usability issues.\n\nInitial access brokers (IABs) and the “infostealer” malware ecosystem—whereby anyone can buy valid login credentials\nfor a target (“access as a service”)—were highly effective means of initial entry. Threat actor groups highly leveraged\nthese underground markets to directly target organizations, but also targeted the organization’s third-party servicers\nand business process outsourcers (BPOs). Organizations did not always consider third parties and BPOs in their risk\nmanagement programs.\n\nLapsus$ was not successful in all its attempted attacks. The Board found that organizations with mature, defense-indepth controls were most resilient to these threat actor groups. Organizations that used application or token-based\nMFA methods or employed robust network intrusion detection systems, including rapid detection of suspicious account\nactivity, were especially resilient. Organizations that maintained and followed their established incident response\nprocedures significantly mitigated impacts. Highly effective organizations employed mechanisms such as out-of-band\ncommunications that allowed incident response professionals to coordinate response efforts without being monitored\nby the threat actors.\n\nThrough extensive efforts, international law enforcement eventually apprehended several of the perpetrators. Yet,\nthose and similar United States (U.S.) government cybersecurity efforts remain unnecessarily hamstrung. In general,\nlaw enforcement remains underfunded for resource- and data-intensive investigations and disruptions against the full\nbreadth of cyber threat actors. Similarly, chronic underreporting from the private sector of threats or incidents hampers\nthe federal government’s ability to warn other targeted entities, recommend mitigation measures, take down malicious\ninfrastructure, seize ill-gotten cryptocurrency or fiat currency, bring those responsible to justice, or otherwise disrupt\nmalicious activity.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ iv\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this review, the Board learned that some of the perpetrators were teenagers. In several jurisdictions, a perpetrator’s\njuvenile status can yield lighter penalties and less severe consequences that may encourage young cybercriminals to\nre-offend. The Board also noted that while the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have nascent efforts to create\npathways for steering talented young hackers away from cybercrime, similar community prevention programs do not\nexist in the U.S. Resourcing both law enforcement and intervention efforts needs rebalancing.\n\n#### KEY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe Board recommends that organizations urgently implement improved access controls and authentication methods\nand transition away from voice and SMS-based MFA; those methods are particularly vulnerable. Instead, organizations\nshould adopt easy-to-use, secure-by-default, passwordless solutions such as Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)2-compliant,\nphishing-resistant MFA methods. Device and software manufacturers will need to innovate and deliver effective\nsolutions that the global digital ecosystem can quickly adopt. To facilitate the transition to passwordless authentication,\nthe Board recommends that the federal government develop and promote a secure authentication roadmap for the\nnation. The roadmap should include standards, frameworks, guidance, tools, and technology that can enable\norganizations to assess, progress, and implement leading practices for passwordless authentication.\n\nThe Board also calls attention to the risks introduced through use of mobile devices for authentication and urges\ntelecommunications providers to mitigate risk through technological, process, and oversight measures. Carriers should\nimplement more stringent authentication methods for SIM swapping to continue enabling legitimate business\nprocesses while introducing more friction to discourage malicious actors. The Board recommends that carriers mitigate\nretail point-of-sale vulnerabilities by improving asset management. For example, carriers can develop methods to detect\nand mitigate theft and abuse of point-of-sale devices and tablets by remotely wiping the devices. Carriers can also\nimplement zero trust architecture concepts in retail stores. To this end, technology providers and developers should\nalso harden their applications and application programing interfaces (APIs) by applying industry best practices for\nsensitive assets.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) should engage in oversight and\nregulatory activities to standardize best practices and combat SIM swapping within the telecommunications industry.\nThe Board recommends that the FCC and FTC strengthen their oversight and enforcement activities focused on SIMswapping by encouraging regular reporting by telecommunications providers regarding fraudulent SIM swapping\nprevalence, documenting and enforcing best practices, and incentivizing better security at telecommunications\nproviders.\n\nThe Board also recommends that organizations prioritize resiliency and fast recovery to defend against these kinds of\nattacks. Planning efforts need to extend to third-party suppliers, including BPOs. Organizations should plan for\ndisruptive cyber intrusions by requiring their whole business (including outside sources) to invest in prevention,\ndetection, response, and recovery capabilities. This includes developing and implementing modern enterprise network\narchitectures, developing and testing a cyber incident response plan, communicating with law enforcement and federal\nresponse officials, and conducting after-action reviews on incidents.\n\nOrganizations should incorporate cybersecurity requirements into contract language and require that third-party service\nproviders and BPOs adhere to similar standards as the company. Furthermore, BPOs should establish information\nsharing relationships with their industry peers and the federal government should support the maturation of this\napproach.\n\nFinally, the Board recommends the advancement of “whole-of-society” programs and mechanisms to prevent juvenile\ncybercrime. Congress should explore funding juvenile cybercrime prevention programs, fostering interruption and\nredirection programs, and reducing criminal incentives by exploring ways to ensure continuity between federal and\nstate law enforcement authorities.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ v\n\n\n-----\n\n### METHODOLOGY\n\nThe Board engaged with nearly 40 organizations and individuals, including representatives from threat intelligence firms,\nincident response organizations, targeted organizations, international law enforcement, as well as individual researchers\nand subject matter experts. The engagements comprised a mixture of interviews and written responses to requests for\ninformation, in addition to reviewing publicly available information from approximately 130 unique sources. See Appendix\nA for a list of participating organizations.\n\nThroughout its review, the Board prioritized the use of primary sources, namely those with first-hand observations such as\ntargeted organizations and threat intelligence subject matter experts. Given the unique nature of how the threat actor\ngroups operated in view of the public, the Board found it appropriate to leverage media coverage and industry blogs, as\nthey provided a valuable archive of perceived attacker movements and events.\n\nThe Board is grateful for all the contributions, which helped build the timeline of events, corroborate facts, and develop\nrecommendations. The proceeding sections of the report—Facts, Findings, and Recommendations—detail the attacks and\ntheir impact, and offer lessons learned that can be applied to any public or private sector organization (domestic or\nforeign).\n\n#### SCOPE OF INQUIRY\n\nLapsus$ was a loosely organized threat actor group that operated against a backdrop of a broader criminal ecosystem,\nwith which it regularly interacted in a fluid and dynamic way. For this reason, threat intelligence experts experienced\nchallenges consistently attributing particular attacks to specific threat actor groups rather than others. Therefore, the\nBoard opened the aperture of its inquiry and looked at reasonably adjacent attack activity that may be attributed to a\nbroader set of threat actors. Similarly, the Board did not attempt to rectify the conflicting views of experts on threat actor\nnaming conventions nor attempt to conclusively attribute any attacks to Lapsus$, preferring instead to focus on the incommon tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that would allow companies and individuals to better protect\nthemselves against similar attacks. Accordingly, the report uses the term “threat actors” or \"this class of threat actors” to\nrefer to the superset of group activity the Board studied.\n\n#### WORKING WITH TARGETED ORGANIZATIONS\n\nThe Board engaged targeted organizations directly to understand how they approached incident response and postincident mitigation. The Board selected specific organizations to engage based upon public disclosures the organizations\nhad previously made. Several of these organizations generously shared their insights with the Board, which\ncomplemented the information provided by experts, including threat intelligence firms and law enforcement. Although\nsome organizations did not agree to participate in the Board’s review, the Board believes it was able to obtain enough\ninformation to conduct a meaningful review and deliver strong recommendations that will have a meaningful impact on\nthe cybersecurity ecosystem.\n\nIn conducting this review, the Board remained committed to its Core Principles,[2] namely, conducting an objective,\n_forward-looking review. As such, this report does not reference targeted organizations by name unless doing so was_\nspecifically approved by that organization or where a public reference such as a news article or indictment was available.\nThis approach is consistent with the President’s National Cyber Strategy, which is rooted in collaboration between\nindustry and government to minimize harm from cyber incidents.\n\n2 “The Board will utilize its fact-finding mission to facilitate lessons learned and advance the cybersecurity goals of the United States. The\nBoard is not a regulatory body and is not focused on finger-pointing. It will foster a just culture and focus on formulating actionable, realistic,\n[and timely recommendations to better secure the community.” Source: CISA, CSRB, https://www.cisa.gov/csrb](https://www.cisa.gov/csrb)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ vi\n\n\n-----\n\n### 1. FACTS\n\nLapsus$ emerged in 2021 within a broad ecosystem of cybercriminal activity, conducting extortion-focused attacks\nagainst a wide range of targets. The group gained notoriety because it successfully attacked well-defended\norganizations using highly effective social engineering; targeted supply chains by compromising business process\noutsourcing (BPOs) and telecommunications providers; and used its public Telegram channel to discuss its operations,\ntargets, and successes, and even to communicate with and extort its targets.\n\n#### 1.1. THE THREAT ACTORS \n\nLapsus$ was a transnational group[3] of threat actors based mainly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Brazil, [4] with 8 to\n10 known members as of April 2022.[5] By some accounts, it formed out of members from two earlier cybercriminal\ngroups known as Cyberteam [6] and Recursion Team.[7] Consistent with the group’s own statements,[8] the Cyber Safety\nReview Board (CSRB, or the Board) received no evidence suggesting Lapsus$ was affiliated with a nation-state or\npolitical entity. In general, the threat intelligence community first observed and tracked Lapsus$ as a named group\nbetween September and December 2021, which is when the group first posted on its public Telegram channel and\nattacked South American targets before pivoting to infiltrate many well-known international companies.[9, 10] However,\nsome researchers identified individuals using the Lapsus$ moniker in forums to claim credit for alleged attacks as early\nas June 2021,[11, 12] indicating that the group or its members may have been active prior to the fall. Additionally, security\nresearchers observed suspected Lapsus$ Telegram activity in March 2022 when a channel belonging to another\nextortion group reposted content from the official Lapsus$ Telegram channel.[13] However, confirmation of Lapsus$\ninvolvement was not verified, and the Board saw no other apparent connection between the two groups.\n\nAlthough Lapsus$ as a named group does not appear to be active at the time of this report,[14] the Board cannot rule out\nthe possibility that Lapsus$ members and affiliates have decided to limit their public profile, join other cybercrime\ngroups, or rebrand.[15] As the Board cannot be definitive about the current existence of Lapsus$, for simplicity, this\nreport refers to Lapsus$ in the past tense.\n\nLapsus$ operated against the backdrop of a dynamic ecosystem of threat actors, each having specific tactics,\npreferring certain target sectors, malware, or methodology. Within this threat ecosystem, Lapsus$ emerged with\ndifferent approaches to targeting, credential theft, and direct interaction with the public. For example, Lapsus$ used its\nprivate and public Telegram channels as a primary communication platform for operational coordination and\n\n[3 Blackberry, “LAPSUS$ Group,” 2023, https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/lapsus](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/lapsus)\n4 Tills, Claire; Tenable, “Brazen, Unsophisticated and Illogical: Understanding the LAPSUS$ Extortion Group,” July 20, 2022,\n[https://www.tenable.com/blog/brazen-unsophisticated-and-illogical-understanding-the-lapsus-extortion-group](https://www.tenable.com/blog/brazen-unsophisticated-and-illogical-understanding-the-lapsus-extortion-group)\n5 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n6 Cyberteam is broadly considered by researchers to be a Portuguese-speaking group (possibly pay-for-hire) active roughly 2015-2020 that\nconducted doxing operations against politicians, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and defacement in Brazil.

The\nrelative commonality of their attack techniques and the connections between Lapsus$ members and those in other\nthreat actor groups have resulted in fragmented threat intelligence reporting and attribution.[19] Some of these groups\nhave provable ties to one another,[20] but the specifics of any individual relationships are difficult to determine. Due to\nthe fluid and overlapping nature of observed activity, the Board increased the aperture of study, and thusly, this report\nalso includes some activities attributed by experts to other threat groups, including those named below.\n\n  - Yanluowang: Broadly identified as a ransomware affiliate group that is reported to have some connection with\nLapsus$ members.[21] The group was active as of August 2021 and targeted organizations in the financial,\nmanufacturing, information technology (IT), consultancy, and engineering sectors.[22]\n\n  - 0ktapus or Roasted 0ktapus: A financially motivated group that is focused on accessing corporate services,\nobtaining crypto-related account information,[23] and stealing source code.[24]\n\n  - Karakurt: A data extortion group[25] known for operating a dedicated leak site to auction stolen data.[26]\n\n  - Nwgen Team: A financially motivated group that split off from Lapsus$ mid-2022 and blended its original\ntradecraft with additional use of ransomware.[27 ]\n\n  - #NotLapsus: Two other unidentified groups, #NotLapsus1 and #NotLapsus2, which have successful alliances\nwith Lapsus$ members and other cybercriminals, such as Yanluowang.[28]\n\nThis report uses the term “threat actors” or \"this class of threat actors” to refer to this superset of group activity the\nBoard studied, referring specifically by name to any one group only where relevant.\n\n##### 1.1.1.

While the group claimed publicly that\nits only motivation was profit, other plausible motivations appear to include notoriety, amusement, and ideology.[33, 34]\nSecurity researchers noted that successfully attacking highly visible targets, including publicly shaming them, generally\nenabled Lapsus$ to expand its reputation and credibility in the cybercriminal environment.[35] At the same time,\nLapsus$’s activity in many of these attacks was consistent with ideological motives. For example, publicly visible chats\nsuggest radical opposition to Brazilian health policies during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,\nwhich may explain targeting of the Brazilian Ministry of Health in December 2021.[36] The Board did not receive\ninformation determining whether these possible differences in motivation were due to the interests of different group\nmembers or individual members conducting independent campaigns attributed to the whole group.\n\n#### 1.2. TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES (TTPs)\n\nThe threat actors described in this report leveraged a wide diversity of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),\ndescribed by researchers as often mixing both non-complex methods and tools with advanced technical knowledge.[37, ]\n\n38 The threat actors initiated some attacks by employing common phishing methods or leveraging stolen credentials,\nwhich they purchased from initial access brokers (IABs). [39] Other attacks demonstrated a deeper familiarity with a\ntarget’s business and engineering workflows.[40 ]\n\nGenerally, the threat actors did not deploy custom tools, preferring well-known tools built by others [41] or “living off the\nland” (LOTL).[42] The speed of the attacks and the use of different tools and techniques were notable and, in some\ncases, appeared automated.[43]\n\nThe following sections outline some of the notable TTPs threat actors used as they worked across the aggregated set of\ntargeted entities and are provided here to support the findings and recommendations below. Where possible,\ndescriptions of attack techniques are aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK[®] Framework taxonomy.[44]\n\n##### 1.2.1.

For example, they used social engineering to increase their understanding of a target’s business\noperations, including information about personnel, structure, and crisis response procedures.[45] They also probed\nnetworks using standard penetration testing methods, such as port scanning, to find vulnerable external services.[46]\nEvidence also suggests that the threat actors solicited login credentials on underground criminal forums and, in the\ncase of Lapsus$, this also occurred in its public Telegram channel.[47, 48]\n\n_Attacker Infrastructure_\n\nThe threat actors used a variety of systems to launch and control their attacks, which included infrastructure for\ncommand-and-control (C2) servers and destination points for exfiltrated data.[49, 50] Some of the threat groups used\ndedicated cloud infrastructure from known virtual service providers (VSPs), enabling the group to stage, launch, and\nexecute an operation rapidly.[51] In some cases, threat actors reused infrastructure across multiple targeted\norganizations, including Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and server-side components like web shells,[52, 53] making\nattribution tracking across intrusions more straightforward. Threat researchers understand these tactics well; the threat\nactors did not appear to introduce any novel capabilities in this regard.\n\nTo mask its attack traffic, the threat group attempted to use anonymization services like Tor to connect to targeted\nnetworks, but then in some instances established new virtual private network (VPN) sessions through residential IP\naddresses to appear less suspicious.[54] Commercial VPN services such as NordVPN served a similar purpose by\nallowing the threat actors to select servers in similar geographic locations to their targets to avoid security detections\nsuch as “impossible travel” signals (activity from disparate locations between which travel in a given timeframe is\nhumanly impossible).[55, 56, 57]\n\n_Emergency Disclosure Request (EDR) Abuse_\n\nSeveral of the threat actors studied for this report, and in particular some members of Lapsus$, used fraudulent\nEmergency Disclosure Requests (EDRs) to obtain sensitive information about targets that could be used to develop\nextortion attacks against targeted individuals, for example by taking over their online accounts to access personal\nphotos. The use of fraudulent EDRs for this purpose is a known tactic, although it is still a relatively recent development\nin the criminal underground.[58] Underlining the scope of this issue, the Board learned that security researchers are\ntracking at least 112 domains, including those belonging to international law enforcement agencies, that attackers\nhave used to disseminate fraudulent EDRs.[59]\n\n45 Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and MSTIC; Microsoft, “DEV-0537 criminal actor targeting organizations for data exfiltration and\n_[destruction,” March 22, 2022, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)_\n[organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)\n46 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n47 Cybersecurity Company, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n48 Cybersecurity Company, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n49 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n50 Cisco provided an exemplary outline of typical attacker infrastructure by this class of threat actor.

Attackers can exploit this method of requesting data to create fake\nrequests by impersonating law enforcement agents and other requestors, for example by embedding official police\nlogos and crests into their requests.[61]\n\n\n##### 1.2.2. Use of Supply Chain Attacks\n\nMany of the threat actors covered in this study extensively exploited the trust relationships between third-party service\nproviders and their clients or customers to develop attacks against the downstream entity.[62, 63, 64] Since 2019, the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has observed a wide variety of threat actor groups targeting suppliers in this\nway.[65] The Board saw discernable patterns in the targeting of three specific sectors for this purpose: BPOs;\ntelecommunications providers; and software as a service (SaaS) providers.\n\n_Business Process Outsourcing Companies (BPOs)_\n\nBPOs are involved in providing scaled operations to organizations, operating as a third-party supplier, which enables\ntheir clients to focus on core competencies while gaining overall cost efficiencies.[66] These services may include\nextended workforce staffing for customer and technical support, data entry, security services, software development,\nand many others. Due to their role in their clients’ business, and the access required to carry out the necessary\noperations, BPOs are an attractive consolidation point for threat actors looking to compromise multiple downstream\ntargeted organizations.[67] The threat actors outlined in this report targeted multiple BPOs in this way.\n\n_Telecommunications Providers_\n\nTelecommunications providers, and in particular mobile phone operators, provide critical infrastructure for the nation,\nand in recent years have become pivotal in the adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) by facilitating the delivery\nof one-time passcodes (OTPs) via Short Message Service (SMS) and voice calls. The threat actors outlined in this report\nmade use of compromised access to telecommunications provider infrastructure, business processes, and accounts to\nhijack these OTPs.[68]\n\n_Third-Party Service Providers_\n\nWhile the use of third-party service providers, such as SaaS, in enterprise has grown in popularity,[69] the federation of\nenterprise data and capabilities into these cloud-based platforms comes with security risks that industry may not\n\n60 For example, see the procedures for Microsoft, Google, Twilio, and Meta: Microsoft; “Law Enforcement Requests Report,”\n[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/law-enforcement-requests-report; Google, “How Google handles government](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/law-enforcement-requests-report)\n_[requests for user information,” https://policies.google.com/terms/information-requests; Twilio, “Law Enforcement Requests Guidelines,”](https://policies.google.com/terms/information-requests)_\n[https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/law-enforcement-guidelines; Meta, “Law Enforcement,”](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/law-enforcement-guidelines)\n[https://about.meta.com/actions/safety/audiences/law](https://about.meta.com/actions/safety/audiences/law)\n61 FBI, CSRB Meeting.\n62 Parisi, Tim; CrowdStrike, “Not a SIMulation: CrowdStrike Investigations Reveal Intrusion Campaign Targeting Telco and BPO Companies,”\n[December 2, 2022, https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies)\n63 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n64 Technology Company, CSRB Meeting.\n65 FBI, CSRB Meeting.\n66 CFI Team; Corporate Financial Institute, “Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)” June 28, 2023,\n[https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/business-process-outsourcing-bpo](https://www.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/business-process-outsourcing-bpo)\n67 Security Researcher 2, CSRB Meeting.\n68 Krebs, Brian; KrebsonSecurity, “Leaked Chats Show LAPSUS$ Stole T-Mobile Source Code,” April 22, 2022,\n[https://www.krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/leaked-chats-show-lapsus-stole-t-mobile-source-code](https://www.krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/leaked-chats-show-lapsus-stole-t-mobile-source-code)\n69 One study suggests that the SaaS market will grow 250% by 2030.

The real\ntarget of this attack was not the third-party service provider, nor the BPO, but rather the downstream customers of\nthe service provider itself. This is a remarkable example of a creative three-stage supply chain attack used by this\nclass of threat actors.[71]\n\n\n##### 1.2.3. Initial Access\n\n_The initial access stages of an attack provide an attacker with a foothold through which they can facilitate further_\n_activity. This may involve a variety of techniques to compromise systems, software, identities, or network access._\n\n_Social Engineering_\n\nSocial engineering was used extensively, and creatively, by most of the threat actors to gain initial access to their\ntargets. The ability to effectively leverage direct contact with employees throughout the lifecycle of the attack, using a\nwide range of techniques, and in multiple languages, was a hallmark of this class of threat actor.[72] Some\ncharacterizations and examples are provided below for illustration.\n\n  - Threat actors used publicly available data about targets, including employee profile pictures, department\nstructures, business processes, workflows, and business relationships, to impersonate legitimate personnel.[73]\n\n  - Threat actors used spear-phishing that had target employees visit spoofed or hacked websites. These sites\ntricked employees and contractors into entering their usernames and passwords into the attacker-controlled\nwebsite.[74] In other cases, these websites were backed by toolkits such as Evilginx2 that passively stole login\ncredentials and session tokens.[75]\n\n  - Threat actors used voice phishing (vishing) to impersonate a trusted entity over voice. Information gathered\nduring the reconnaissance phase of the attack, including answers to security questions, helped threat actors to\nconvince support desk employees to reset account credentials over the phone.[76]\n\n  - Threat actors used SMS phishing (smishing) to deliver instructions or website links via SMS to a victim’s phone.\nThese messages often contained links to seemingly legitimate domains, such as a similar website address,\ncontaining user login fields but were instead used by threat actors to harvest user credentials.[77]\n\n[70 Preci, Ejona and Gregory, Peter; ISACA, “SaaS Security Risk and Challenges,” July 26, 2022, https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-](https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/industry-news/2022/saas-security-risk-and-challenges)\n[trends/industry-news/2022/saas-security-risk-and-challenges](https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/industry-news/2022/saas-security-risk-and-challenges)\n71 Bradbury, David; Okta, “Okta Concludes its Investigation into the January 2022 Compromise,” April 19, 2022,\n[https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/04/okta-concludes-its-investigation-into-the-january-2022-compromise](https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/04/okta-concludes-its-investigation-into-the-january-2022-compromise)\n[72 Intrinsec, “Analysis of Lapsus$ Intrusion Set,” March 28, 2022, https://www.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/INTRINSEC-](https://www.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/INTRINSEC-LAPSUS-Intrusion-Set-20220324.pdf)\n[LAPSUS-Intrusion-Set-20220324.pdf](https://www.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/INTRINSEC-LAPSUS-Intrusion-Set-20220324.pdf)\n73 Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and MSTIC; Microsoft, “DEV-0537 criminal actor targeting organizations for data exfiltration and\n_[destruction,” March 22, 2022, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)_\n[organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)\n74 Research & Insights Center; SecurityScorecard, “Lapsus$ Update: How This Technically Unsophisticated Threat Actor Group Breaches\n_[Large Organizations,” January 9, 2023, https://www.securityscorecard.com/research/lapsus-update](https://www.securityscorecard.com/research/lapsus-update)_\n75 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n76 Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and MSTIC; Microsoft, “DEV-0537 criminal actor targeting organizations for data exfiltration and\n_[destruction,” March 22, 2022, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)_\n[organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)\n77 Security; Twilio, “Incident Report: Employee and Customer Account Compromise,” October 27, 2022,\n[https://www.twilio.com/blog/august-2022-social-engineering-attack](https://www.twilio.com/blog/august-2022-social-engineering-attack)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 6\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Threat actors used MFA fatigue, spamming employees with MFA prompts with the goal of overwhelming them\nwith access approval requests until they said yes. Sometimes these prompts occurred late at night, or during\ninconvenient times,[78] possibly to increase the likelihood of the employee accepting the prompt.\n\n  - In a few cases, the threat actor impersonated help desk personnel over direct chat messages and encouraged\nemployees to approve the MFA prompts.[79]\n\n  - Threat actors convinced employees to navigate to credential-harvesting websites or download remote\nmonitoring and management (RMM) tools, allowing the threat actor to remotely connect and control the\ntarget’s system.[80]\n\n_Hijacking Delivery of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Passcodes_\n\nDuring its research, the Board heard about threat actors’ ability to exploit SMS and voice MFA through fraudulent\nSubscriber Identity Module (SIM) swaps, as depicted in Figure 1. SIM swapping, a generally benign business process\nthat enables mobile phone customers to switch their phone number to new devices was especially pertinent to this\nreview. Threat actors can abuse this business process to fraudulently activate an attacker-controlled SIM with the\nvictim’s phone number. This enables the threat actor to intercept SMS and voice calls and receive MFA-related\nmessages that control access to online accounts.[81]\n\n_Figure 1 - Example of a Fraudulent SIM Swap_\n\nTo execute fraudulent SIM swaps, Lapsus$ obtained basic information about its victims, such as their name, phone\nnumber, and customer proprietary network information (CPNI). Lapsus$ learned the information through a variety of\nways, including issuing fraudulent EDRs and using account takeover techniques, to hijack the accounts of\ntelecommunications provider employees and contractors. It then performed fraudulent SIM swaps via the\ntelecommunications provider’s customer management tools.[82, 83] After executing the fraudulent SIM swaps, Lapsus$\ntook over online accounts via sign-in and account recovery workflows that sent one-time links or MFA passcodes via\nSMS or voice calls.[84, 85]\n\n78 FBI, CSRB Meeting.\n79 Cybersecurity Company, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n80 Parisi, Tim; CrowdStrike, “Not a SIMulation: CrowdStrike Investigations Reveal Intrusion Campaign Targeting Telco and BPO Companies,”\n[December 2, 2022, https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies)\n81 FBI, “Criminals Increasing SIM Swap Schemes to Steal Millions of Dollars from US Public,” February 8, 2022,\n[https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208)\n82 Parisi, Tim; CrowdStrike, “Not a SIMulation: CrowdStrike Investigations Reveal Intrusion Campaign Targeting Telco and BPO Companies,”\n[December 2, 2022, https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies)\n[83 KrebsonSecurity, “A Closer Look at the LAPSUS$ Data Extortion Group,” March 23, 2022, https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/)\n[closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/)\n84 Bonifacic, Igor; Engadget, “Lapsus$ stole T-Mobile's source code before member arrests in March,” April 23, 2022,\n[https://www.engadget.com/lapsus-t-mobile-source-code-185950839.html](https://www.engadget.com/lapsus-t-mobile-source-code-185950839.html)\n85 Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and MSTIC; Microsoft, “DEV-0537 criminal actor targeting organizations for data exfiltration and\n_[destruction,” March 22, 2022, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)_\n[organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 7\n\n\n-----\n\nImpact of Fraudulent SIM Swaps on National Security\n\n\nThreat actor groups persistently targeted telecommunications providers of United States (U.S.) federal employees to\ngain access to internal tools that would enable convenient SIM swapping (for hijacking MFA pass codes). In one case\nLapsus$ targeted one U.S. telecommunications providers and attempted to use this illegitimate access to\ncompromise mobile phone accounts associated with FBI and Department of Defense (DOD) personnel.[86] This was\nunsuccessful due to extra protections on these accounts. While the Board did not learn of any nexus between this\nparticular threat actor group and nation-state threat actors, the tactics and techniques shown here would be easily\nadaptable for any threat actor wishing to target U.S. national security interests.\n\n\n_Insider Recruitment_\n\nSome of the threat actors used monetary incentives to recruit employees and contractors of targeted organizations,\nwho then took actions on behalf of the threat actors. This included handing over access credentials to the threat actor,\napproving upstream MFA requests, and performing actions directly for the attacker using their internal company\naccess. Lapsus$ posted advertisements offering sums of money for access to targeted systems. For access to several\ntelecommunications providers, the group offered as much as United States Dollars (USD) 20,000 per week to conduct\nSIM swaps.[87, 88]\n\n_Vulnerability Exploitation to Gain Initial Access_\n\nA limited set of the threat actors exploited known software and configuration vulnerabilities to gain initial access. As\nthreat actors discovered potential vulnerabilities and identified targets using tools such as Shodan,[89, 90] they\nsometimes circulated the information in online forums, allowing several additional threat actors to take advantage of\nthe exposure. All the observed vulnerabilities during this study were well known, with patched software available;\nsecurity researchers observed no use of novel or \"zero-day” vulnerabilities.[91, 92] Some notable examples of these\nvulnerabilities are provided below for illustrative purposes.\n\n  - Exploitation of a vulnerability in ForgeRock OpenAM (Common Vulnerability and Exposure [CVE]-2021-35464)\nallowed a threat actor to get initial access and elevate privileges within the victim cloud environment.[93]\n\n  - Exploitation of a well-known vulnerability in WSO2 servers (CVE-2022-29464) enabled one of the threat actors\nto upload its tools and web shells to a targeted server to establish persistence.[94, 95]\n\n_Initial Access Brokers (IABs)_\n\nIABs are part of a broader criminal ecosystem involved in the theft and sale of access to targeted networks (“access as\na service”). They use a variety of techniques to obtain this access, including those outlined in this report: social\nengineering; recruiting insiders; malware (“malware as a service”); scanning for open remote services with guessable\npasswords; exploiting vulnerabilities; and selling password database dumps from breaches. IABs obtain access, for\n\n86 Evidence for this comes from screenshots taken by the threat actors and shared privately between themselves. These private chats were\nobserved by a journalist and reported in publication. The Board chose to include this specific article as part of overall review of the facts, as\nit provided deeper insight into how Lapsus$ operated.

Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, Persistence\n\n_Once an attacker has initial access to a system, the foothold is typically used to elevate privileges, laterally move to_\n_desired areas of a victim’s systems, and establish long-term access (persistence)._\n\nTo perform reconnaissance of the network and facilitate privileged access, the threat actors exploited the tendency for\nenterprises and their employees to document internal procedures, share information on collaboration platforms, and\nuse ticketing systems to perform internal help desk operations. In some cases, they impersonated employees, including\nhelp desk and administrator personnel, and conducted social engineering attacks. They scanned systems, searched\ninformation repositories, and exploited vulnerabilities to raise privileges.[97, 98] An overview of some notable techniques\nis outlined in the sections below.\n\n_Privilege Escalation via Improperly Stored Passwords and Keys_\n\nA prevalent method of escalating privilege seen across the organizations involved the threat actors searching for, and\nexploiting, situations where the organization had improperly secured credentials. This enabled them to use legitimate\ncredentials to further their attack goals, which had the added benefit of appearing to be legitimate user behavior in the\nforensic record. Examples included:\n\n  - administrative passwords documented in a spreadsheet;[99]\n\n  - Amazon Web Services (AWS) access keys stored in Slack;[100]\n\n  - sensitive data stored in collaborative platforms, code repositories, and communication channels;[101]\n\n  - processes for accessing source code stored in enterprise knowledge shares;[102]\n\n  - privileged credentials embedded in a PowerShell script, stored on a misconfigured network share;[103] and\n\n  - credentials from password databases, browser password caches, and keychains.[104, 105]\n\n_Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement using Common Tools_\n\nThe threat actors leveraged initial and privileged access to further elevate access and laterally move to other systems.\nA mix of system utilities, diagnostic extensions, administrative databases, and malicious tools was used.[106, 107] The\n\n96 An overview on Initial Access Brokers can be found at: Center for Internet Security, “Initial Access Brokers How They’re Changing\n_[Cybercrime,” January 18, 2023, https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/initial-access-brokers-how-theyre-changing-cybercrime](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/initial-access-brokers-how-theyre-changing-cybercrime)_\n97 Biasini, Nick;

This included intellectual property for marquis high-profile\nsoftware products, user data, and other data types that were leveraged in further attacks. However, in some cases,\nattacks appeared to reflect a “smash-and-grab” approach that seemed to prioritize speed over strategy and sometimes\n\n134 Cybersecurity Company, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n135 Parisi, Tim; CrowdStrike, “Not a SIMulation: CrowdStrike Investigations Reveal Intrusion Campaign Targeting Telco and BPO Companies,”\n[December 2, 2022, https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies)\n136 BeyondTrust, “Lapsus$ Breaches Remind us Service Desks & Insiders often Weakest Link,” March 29, 2022,\n[https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/lapsus-breaches-remind-us-service-desks-insiders-often-weakest-link](https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/lapsus-breaches-remind-us-service-desks-insiders-often-weakest-link)\n137 Biasini, Nick; Cisco Talos, “Cisco Talos Shares Insights Related to Recent Cyber Attack on Cisco,” August 10, 2022,\n[https://blog.talosintelligence.com/recent-cyber-attack](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/recent-cyber-attack)\n138 Research & Insights Center; SecurityScorecard, “Lapsus$ Update: How This Technically Unsophisticated Threat Actor Group Breaches\n_[Large Organizations,” January 9, 2023, https://www.securityscorecard.com/research/lapsus-update](https://www.securityscorecard.com/research/lapsus-update)_\n139 Code-signing certificates are used to establish the legitimate creator and distributor of software.

Extortion and Ransoms\n\nThreat actor groups frequently attempted to extort organizations and ransom stolen data. However, the effectiveness of\nthese coercion techniques is difficult to quantify. Threat actor groups demanded payment directly by communicating\nwith the targeted organizations, but these attempts were uneven in their approach, with some being posted publicly to\nembarrass or harass the target, or poorly coordinated in their demands for payments and deadlines.\n\nThe effectiveness of extortion as a technique and whether the threat actors monetarily gained from their attempts is\nunclear. The Board spoke with targeted companies, threat intelligence firms, and law enforcement, and while\nransomware attacks are widely acknowledged to have been lucrative in the past,[164] interviewees expressed no clear\nconsensus on how much, if any, money was ever paid to any of the threat actors to alleviate extortion. In fact, FBI\nreported that it was not aware of Lapsus$ selling stolen data, nor had it found evidence that anyone ever paid ransoms.\nHowever, FBI has not ruled out the possibility that some paid ransoms without informing law enforcement.[165] This\ncontrasts with other experts that observed Lapsus$ extorting organizations with some paying ransoms.[166]\n\nThe following examples enumerate public reporting, attacker claims, and authorized disclosures to the Board for\ninclusion in this report. This is not an exhaustive list but demonstrates the breadth of experiences shared across\ntargeted organizations.\n\n  - Threat actors attempted to extort one technology company by threatening to release its confidential and\nproprietary data if the company did not push an update to its product that would remove a cryptocurrency\nmining limitation.[167, 168] When the extortion attempt failed, the threat actor offered to sell a bypass for the\n\n157 Istoe Dinheiro, “Federal Police systems have been down for 10 days,” (translated), January 20, 2021,\n[https://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/sistemas-da-policia-federal-estao-fora-do-ar-ha-10-dias/](https://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/sistemas-da-policia-federal-estao-fora-do-ar-ha-10-dias/)\n[158 DarkOwl, “Darknet Threat Actor Report: LAPSUS$” March 16, 2022, https://www.darkowl.com/blog-content/darknet-threat-actor-report-](https://www.darkowl.com/blog-content/darknet-threat-actor-report-lapsus)\n[lapsus](https://www.darkowl.com/blog-content/darknet-threat-actor-report-lapsus)\n159 Kovacs, Eduard; SecurityWeek, “Vodafone Investigating Source Code Theft Claims,” March 10, 2022,\n[https://www.securityweek.com/vodafone-investigating-source-code-theft-claims](https://www.securityweek.com/vodafone-investigating-source-code-theft-claims)\n160 Flashpoint Intel Team; Flashpoint, “All About LAPSUS$: What We Know About the Extortionist Group,” March 23, 2022,\n[https://flashpoint.io/blog/lapsus](https://flashpoint.io/blog/lapsus)\n161 Pieter Arntz; Malwarebytes, “Stolen Nvidia certificates used to sign malware—here's what to do,” March 15, 2022,\n[https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/03/stolen-nvidia-certificates-used-to-sign-malware-heres-what-to-do](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/03/stolen-nvidia-certificates-used-to-sign-malware-heres-what-to-do)\n162 Biasini, Nick; Cisco Talos, “Cisco Talos Shares Insights Related to Recent Cyber Attack on Cisco,” August 10, 2022,\n[https://blog.talosintelligence.com/recent-cyber-attack](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/recent-cyber-attack)\n163 Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and MSTIC; Microsoft, “DEV-0537 criminal actor targeting organizations for data exfiltration and\n_[destruction,” March 22, 2022, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)_\n[organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)\n164 Unit 42 Palo Alto Networks, “Ransomware and Extortion Report,” March 2023,\n[https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/reports/2023-unit42-ransomware-extortion-report.pdf](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/reports/2023-unit42-ransomware-extortion-report.pdf)\n165 FBI, CSRB Meeting.\n166 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n167 Ilascu, Ionut; Bleeping Computer, “Hackers to NVIDIA: Remove mining cap or we leak hardware data,” February 28, 2022,\n[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-to-nvidia-remove-mining-cap-or-we-leak-hardware-data](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-to-nvidia-remove-mining-cap-or-we-leak-hardware-data)\n168 Heiligenstein Michael; Firewall Times, “Lapsus$ Group Cyberattacks: Methods, Motives, and Timeline,” September 19, 2022,\n[https://firewalltimes.com/lapsus-group-cyberattacks](https://firewalltimes.com/lapsus-group-cyberattacks)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 14\n\n\n-----\n\nmining limitation for USD 1 million,[169] plus an unspecified percentage of the proceeds.

Harassment\n\nMultiple organizations and individuals involved in responding to the attacks experienced varying levels of personal\nharassment from some of the threat actors, with an intent to retaliate, halt investigations, or silence researchers.\n\nA technology company reported that it was now tracking several groups as part of a new class of cybercriminal threat\nthat has added targeted harassment to its toolbox and observed them targeting incident response professionals and\ntheir family members.[188] Some experts view this as an escalation in violence that is the result of cybercrime gangs\ncompeting for dominance.[189]\n\nThe seriousness of this activity ranged from mischief to dangerous behavior. Lapsus$ was known to join and monitor\nan organization’s incident response channels, and in one instance took over a screen share and deleted resources live\nin front of the victim. Similarly, Lapsus$ publicly posted screenshots of victim environments[190] to demonstrate their\naccess.[191] On the more serious end of this behavior, loosely affiliated threat actors threatened and harassed security\nprofessionals by publishing their personal information online, i.e., doxing,[192] and pestered targeted organizations’\nemployees on Keybase, Twitter, and other online forums.[193] The Board also heard of a subset of threat actors that\nrecruited forum members to hijack cybersecurity professionals’ online accounts,[194] and conducted swatting attacks[195]\nagainst them and their families.[196] This demonstrates the potentially serious physical threat these groups posed.\n\n#### 1.4. PRIVATE SECTOR RESPONSE AND MITIGATION\n\nPrivate sector organizations experienced varying levels of success in incident response and mitigation. However,\norganizations that prepared incident response and mitigation plans reported better recovery outcomes against\nincidents involving Lapsus$.[197, 198] At times, organizations simultaneously had to manage an active attack on their\ninternal systems and harassment from the threat actor in public settings.

One victim company enhanced its operational security by prohibiting bring-your-own-device (BYOD)\nusage in high-risk areas of the enterprise and selectively granting employees access to necessary resources.[199] Some\norganizations also made use of “out-of-band communications” (any alternative system or technology that allows\ncommunication separate from the primary channel),[200] an incident response procedure best established ahead of\nattacks,[201] to improve response operations by prohibiting threat actors from observing incident response\ncommunications and activities or taunting response teams.[202, 203, 204]\n\n##### 1.4.2. Disruption and Security Posture\n\nOrganizations adjusted their security posture to eradicate the threat actor from their environment and prevent re-entry.\nAuthentication, employee verification, and access weaknesses combined to create a central theme in how the threat\nactors targeted organizations. The following section outlines some of the measures that organizations employed to\nmitigate the attack impact mid- and post-attack.\n\nMitigations were often disruptive to the organization’s business operations as changes were rolled out rapidly or took\ncritical business resources offline. In some situations, organizations needed to shut down resources to mitigate the\nattack. However, they sometimes did not know which resources they could safely take offline. Organizations needed to\nupdate their system inventories and document their architectures before completely understanding which systems they\ncould safely shut down.[205] As events unfolded, one organization with existing security monitoring processes identified\nthe issue and moved to respond, for example by disabling affected and potentially affected tools and locking down its\ncodebase to prevent potential code changes.[206]\n\nAfter threat actors gained access to corporate credentials and bypassed MFA to access victim systems, one\norganization took steps, such as conducting enterprise-wide password resets[207] while another required all employees\nto re-authenticate after restoring internal tool access.[208] An organization also disabled global SMS one-time passwords\n(OTP), enabled an ability for employees to flag suspected false authentication requests, and only allowed MFA that\nrequired employees to use a passcode on their screen to validate or leverage hardware-based authentication.[209]\n\nPost-attack, organizations took additional steps to improve their security posture. For example, some organizations\nshortened their authentication and session lengths to force more frequent re-authentication for access to company\nplatforms.[210, 211] Other organizations also rotated keys to many internal services to effectively reset access,[212] required\n\n199 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n200 Hudak, Tyler; TrustedSec, “To OOB, or Not to OOB?: Why Out-of-Band Communications are Essential for Incident Response,” December\n[29, 2022, https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/to-oob-or-not-to-oob-why-out-of-band-communications-are-essential-for-incident-response/](https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/to-oob-or-not-to-oob-why-out-of-band-communications-are-essential-for-incident-response/)\n201 CISA, “Operational Procedures for Planning and Conducting Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Activities in FCEB\n[Information Systems,” November 16, 2021, https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf)\n[02/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf)\n202 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n203 Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and MSTIC; Microsoft, “DEV-0537 criminal actor targeting organizations for data exfiltration and\n_[destruction,” March 22, 2022, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)_\n[organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)\n204 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n205 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n[206 Uber Security Team; Uber, “Uber Newsroom Security Update,” September 19, 2022, https://www.uber.com/newsroom/security-update](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/security-update)\n207 Technology Company, CSRB Meeting.\n[208 Uber Security Team; Uber, “Uber Newsroom Security Update,” September 19, 2022, https://www.uber.com/newsroom/security-update](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/security-update)\n209 Technology Company, CSRB Meeting.\n210 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n211 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n212 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 17\n\n\n-----\n\nall access to company internal systems to originate from corporate-managed machines, and blocked third-party remote\ndesktop support software.[213]\n\nCompanies took targeted steps to improve MFA practices, including\n\n  - implementing phishing-resistant hardware tokens for MFA;[214]\n\n  - eliminating MFA push alerts;[215]\n\n  - verifying employee identities through video verification to reduce social engineering when fulfilling MFA reset\nrequests;[216] and\n\n  - transitioning to using Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)-supported applications and passwordless authentication.[217, ]\n\n218\n\nOrganizations also adjusted their audit procedures and established additional security requirements for their service\nproviders to ensure they meet an acceptable level of security. These measures varied but included the adoption of zero\ntrust architecture (ZTA),[219] use of MFA for authentication, and safer access methods such as VDIs.[220]\n\n##### 1.4.3. Detection\n\nOrganizations found that early detection of attacks was important to enabling effective response. Companies took both\nmid- and post-attack actions to better detect and block suspicious events and attacks.\n\nAfter detecting an attack, an organization increased monitoring of its internal environment to identify any further\nsuspicious activity.[221] Discovering how a threat actor used compromised credentials to access its Slack environment,\nanother organization implemented session fingerprinting to identify potentially re-used Slack sessions to detect\nattackers that were session hijacking.[222]\n\nPost attack, an organization increased the resiliency of its detection by creating endpoint detection and response agent\nredundancy after discovering that threat actors deleted its original detection and response platform from its cloud\nenvironment.[223] One company improved its logs by making them more transparent to customers and enabling alerts\nevery time support personnel accessed their information.[224]\n\nRegarding fraudulent SIM swaps, an organization also shared a historically practiced and successful method to detect\nsuspicious anomalies where certain legitimate information relating to a customer is vastly different from that provided\nin connection with the requested SIM swap.[225]\n\n##### 1.4.4. Personnel Security Awareness\n\nAs part of preventative strategies to mitigate attacks, some organizations create awareness and education programs to\nenable employees to better recognize attacker TTPs and intrusion attempts. One organization developed an internal\nrisk mitigation awareness campaign to engage and educate almost 100,000 employees and contractors in its\nworkforce, creating increased incident reporting and a dramatic improvement of workers identifying simulated phishing\n\n213 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n214 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n215 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n216 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n217 The FIDO Alliance is an open industry association promoting authentication standards that aims to reduce the reliance on passwords.\n_Source: FIDO Alliance, “Changing the Nature of Authentication?” December 2, 2014 (updated December 1, 2022),_\n_[https://fidoalliance.org/overview](https://fidoalliance.org/overview)_\n218 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n219 Bradbury, David; Okta, “Okta Concludes its Investigation into the January 2022 Compromise,” April 19, 2022,\n[https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/04/okta-concludes-its-investigation-into-the-january-2022-compromise](https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/04/okta-concludes-its-investigation-into-the-january-2022-compromise)\n220 Technology Company, CSRB Meeting.\n221 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n222 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n223 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n224 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n225 Technology Company, CSRB Meeting.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 18\n\n\n-----\n\nattempts after training.[226] To simulate as authentic an attack as possible, one company trains its agents using actual\nvishing attempts (voice phishing) to familiarize employees.[227] A company impacted by Lapsus$ also emphasized the\nimportance of training employees of attack methods, which it credited with suspicious login reporting across its\nenterprise.[228]\n\n##### 1.4.5. Threat Intelligence and Information Sharing\n\nMultiple organizations reported that sharing threat intelligence, including TTPs and indicators of compromise (IOCs),\nwith peer companies and law enforcement contributed to a more effective response by helping to attribute threat\nactivity and develop meaningful mitigations.[229, 230, 231] Information was distributed through public avenues such as\nwebsites, blogs, and threat intelligence notices.[232] In the aftermath of attacks, generally speaking, organizations are\nimproving their threat intelligence sharing network to better prepare themselves and their customers against similar\ncyber threats. The following outlines some examples of where organizations successfully leveraged information sharing.\nIt is not an exhaustive list but illustrates some positive outcomes.\n\nIndustry Initiatives:\n\n  - A victim organization initiated threat intelligence sharing arrangements with technology industry leaders, threat\nintelligence companies, and other corporate entities.[233]\n\n  - An impacted company created an in-house threat intelligence team to share weekly intelligence with clients\nand peer organizations.[234]\n\nCustomer-Facing Initiatives:\n\n  - One organization shared customized threat briefings to educate customers on how to identify threat actor\nbehavior in their environments.[235]\n\n  - After an attack, an organization began reviewing its communication policies to adopt new systems that would\nhelp quickly and clearly notify customers when security or availability issues exist.[236]\n\nLaw Enforcement Initiatives:\n\n  - Leveraging an existing relationship with the cyber branch of the local FBI field office, one affected organization\nwas able to contact an international law enforcement agency and share information that led to the arrest of\none of the attackers.[237]\n\n#### 1.5. DISRUPTION EFFORTS\n\nSuccessful coordination and collaboration with U.S., international law enforcement, and other government partners,\nwas necessary to disrupt Lapsus$ and related threat actors. The sections below highlight how incident reporting plays\ninto disrupting threat actors and summarize international law enforcement actions against Lapsus$.\n\n[226 Cisco, “Keeping Cisco Safe,” March 11, 2020, https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-keeping-cisco-safe-casestudy.pdf)\n[keeping-cisco-safe-casestudy.pdf](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-keeping-cisco-safe-casestudy.pdf)\n227 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n228 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n229 Technology Company, CSRB Meeting.\n230 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n231 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n232 Roth, Emma; The Verge, “Lapsus$ cyberattacks: the latest news on the hacking group,” September 26, 2022,\n[https://www.theverge.com/22998479/lapsus-hacking-group-cyberattacks-news-updates](https://www.theverge.com/22998479/lapsus-hacking-group-cyberattacks-news-updates)\n233 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n234 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n235 Technology Company, CSRB Meeting.\n236 Bradbury, David; Okta, “Okta Concludes its Investigation into the January 2022 Compromise,” April 19, 2022,\n[https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/04/okta-concludes-its-investigation-into-the-january-2022-compromise](https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/04/okta-concludes-its-investigation-into-the-january-2022-compromise)\n237 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 19\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 1.5.1. Incident Reporting\n\nThe Board heard that multiple targeted organizations reported attacks to FBI,[238] and is aware of at least one prior\nvictim company that confirmed FBI was able to share information with it about the threat actor, which was obtained\nfrom information shared with law enforcement.[239] Another company reported to the Board that it shared information\nwith the U.S. government beyond FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) by reaching out to the\nGeneral Services Administration (GSA), Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), the Defense\nIndustrial Base Network (DIBNet), and briefing select members of Congress and the White House regarding its Lapsus$\nattack.[240] A victim company found the interaction with law enforcement to be collaborative and mutually beneficial.[241]\n\n\nReporting Cyber Incidents to the U.S. Government\n\n\nIn the U.S., law enforcement agencies and private sector organizations often cooperate to effectively counter threat\nactors. Federal law enforcement agencies have the authority to carry out sweeping countermeasures and otherwise\nact to disrupt a threat actor’s malicious activities. The agencies also have authority to enable widespread data\nsharing to improve resiliency and mitigation practices. Private industry has a dual mandate to defend its own\norganizations and ensure adequate information sharing with law enforcement and its peers within industry to enable\nthe most comprehensive response to threat actors.\n\nFBI and CISA reported to the Board that their effectiveness and responsiveness in supporting organizations impacted\nby cyber intrusions can benefit from those organizations having prior relationships with FBI or CISA, the timely\nreporting of incidents to either FBI or CISA, and the organization’s willingness to voluntarily report and share further\nthreat and incident information to help protect others from being targeted by similar malicious activities using the\nsame infrastructure or TTPs.[242]\n\nFBI and CISA informed the Board that victim organizations sometimes choose to rely on third-party incident response\nfirms without reporting the incident to FBI or CISA.[243] An organization’s decision not to report limits the U.S.\ngovernment’s ability to take disruptive action, such as the recovery of ransom payments or the decryption of data,\neither alone or in partnership with foreign and private sector partners.[244] FBI and CISA stressed to the Board that\nvictim organizations working with incident response firms and sharing information with the U.S. government will\nserve to maximize available remediation and disruption resources, improving outcomes for victim organizations and\nthe cyber resilience of the U.S.[245]\n\n\n##### 1.5.2. Investigations and Arrests\n\nThrough the course of its review, the Board heard how U.S. agencies and global partners collaborated to disrupt\nLapsus$. Notable examples include:\n\n  - International law enforcement’s efforts to disrupt ongoing attacks by Lapsus$ and related members was\nevident when media sources publicly reported the arrests of several individuals in 2022. On March 24, 2022,\nthe City of London Police released information about the arrest of seven individuals in connection with\nLapsus$.[246]\n\n238 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n239 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n240 Targeted Organization, CSRB Meeting.\n241 Targeted Organization, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n242 FBI and CISA Panel Interview, CSRB Meeting.\n243 FBI and CISA Panel Interview, CSRB Meeting.\n244 Vorndran, Bryan A.; FBI Cyber Division, “Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” March 29, 2022,\n[https://www.congress.gov/117/meeting/house/114533/witnesses/HHRG-117-JU00-Wstate-VorndranB-20220329.pdf](https://www.congress.gov/117/meeting/house/114533/witnesses/HHRG-117-JU00-Wstate-VorndranB-20220329.pdf)\n245 FBI and CISA Panel Interview, CSRB Meeting.\n246 Peters, Jay; The Verge, “Seven teenagers arrested in connection with the Lapsus$ hacking group,” March 24, 2022,\n[https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994563/lapsus-hacking-group-london-police-arrest-microsoft-nvidia](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994563/lapsus-hacking-group-london-police-arrest-microsoft-nvidia)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 20\n\n\n-----\n\n  - On April 1, 2022, the City of London Police announced that it had charged two juveniles with various cyber\noffenses related to an international police investigation into the Lapsus$ threat group.[247, 248]\n\n  - On September 22, 2022, as part of an investigation by the U.K.’s National Crime Agency (NCA), the City of\nLondon Police arrested a seventeen-year-old from Oxfordshire on suspicion of hacking.[249] While the related\nannouncement did not disclose details about the nature of the investigation, media sources and one cyber\nthreat intelligence firm believed the arrests were related to Lapsus$’s attacks against technology and gaming\ncompanies.[250, 251]\n\n  - On October 19, 2022, as an offshoot of an operation codenamed “Operation Dark Cloud,” Brazilian police\nannounced that they had arrested a Brazilian national suspected of belonging to Lapsus$.[252]\n\nSecurity researchers reported the group’s highly public communication style decreased after media sources reported\nthat the City of London Police had arrested some of the group’s members in March 2022.[253] However, researchers\nobserved Lapsus$ attacking an organization in September 2022,[254] and compromising and leaking content from a\nvideo game company in the same month.[255, 256] Lapsus$ appears to have become inactive after September 2022.[257]\nAlthough this cannot be conclusively linked to law enforcement actions, the timing is noteworthy. Further, although the\nBoard cannot rule out the possibility that the remaining Lapsus$ members have decided to limit their public profile, join\nother cybercrime groups, or rebrand, doing so often comes with an operational pause or other costs that are\nnonetheless positive developments from a cybersecurity perspective, even if only in the short term.\n\n##### 1.5.3. Limiting Factors\n\nLaw enforcement agencies face inhibiting factors when disrupting transnational networks of threat actors, as shown in\nthe case of Lapsus$. The section below elaborates on three categories of issues that the Board heard.\n\n_Information Sharing and International Collaboration_\n\nInternational law enforcement and other government entities have made progress collaborating to advance cybercrime\ninvestigations. In recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) conducted several successful multinational\noperations against cyber threat actors with partner countries.[258] For example, law enforcement recently launched a\ncoordinated international operation against the Genesis Market cybercrime marketplace that resulted in the arrest of\nmany Genesis Market users around the world.[259] In January 2023, the FBI announced it had covertly infiltrated the Hive\nransomware network, preventing victims from having to pay, by conservative estimates, more than USD 130 million in\nransom and providing over 1,000 decryption keys to victims. The FBI highlighted its coordination with international\n\n247 City of London Police, “Two Teenagers Charged in Connection with Investigation into Hacking Group,” April 1, 2022,\n[https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/news/city-of-london/news/2022/march/two-teenagers-charged-in-connection-with-investigation-into-](https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/news/city-of-london/news/2022/march/two-teenagers-charged-in-connection-with-investigation-into-hacking-group)\n[hacking-group](https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/news/city-of-london/news/2022/march/two-teenagers-charged-in-connection-with-investigation-into-hacking-group)\n[248 BBC, “Lapsus$: Two UK teenagers charged with hacking for gang,” April 1, 2022, https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60953527](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60953527)\n[249 BBC, “Oxfordshire teen arrested in police hacking investigation,” September 23, 2022, https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-63010523)\n[oxfordshire-63010523](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-63010523)\n250 Lakshmanan, Ravie; The Hacker News, “London Police Arrested 17-Year-Old Hacker Suspected of Uber and GTA 6 Breaches,” September\n[24, 2022, https://www.thehackernews.com/2022/09/london-police-arrested-17-year-old.html](https://www.thehackernews.com/2022/09/london-police-arrested-17-year-old.html)\n251 Cybersecurity Company, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n252 Ministério da Justiça e Segurança Pública, “PF arrests Brazilian suspected of being part of international criminal organization”\n[(translated), October 19, 2022, https://www.gov.br/pf/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2022/10/pf-prende-brasileiro-suspeito-de-integrar-](https://www.gov.br/pf/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2022/10/pf-prende-brasileiro-suspeito-de-integrar-organizacao-criminosa-internacional)\n[organizacao-criminosa-internacional](https://www.gov.br/pf/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/2022/10/pf-prende-brasileiro-suspeito-de-integrar-organizacao-criminosa-internacional)\n253 Research & Insights Center; SecurityScorecard, “Lapsus$ Update: How This Technically Unsophisticated Threat Actor Group Breaches\n_[Large Organizations,” January 9, 2023, https://www.securityscorecard.com/research/lapsus-update](https://www.securityscorecard.com/research/lapsus-update)_\n[254 Uber Security Team; Uber, “Uber Newsroom Security Update,” September 19, 2022, https://www.uber.com/newsroom/security-update](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/security-update)\n255 Abrams, Lawrence; Bleeping Computer, “GTA 6 source code and videos leaked after Rockstar Games hack,” September 18, 2022,\n[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gta-6-source-code-and-videos-leaked-after-rockstar-games-hack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gta-6-source-code-and-videos-leaked-after-rockstar-games-hack)\n256 Cybersecurity Company, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n257 FBI, CSRB Meeting.\n[258 Monaco, Lisa; DOJ, “Comprehensive Cyber Review,” July 18, 2022, https://www.justice.gov/dag/page/file/1520341/download](https://www.justice.gov/dag/page/file/1520341/download)\n259 Office of Public Affairs; DOJ, “Criminal Marketplace Disrupted in International Cyber Operation,” April 5, 2023,\n[https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-marketplace-disrupted-international-cyber-operation](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-marketplace-disrupted-international-cyber-operation)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 21\n\n\n-----\n\npartners including law enforcement and a tech-specific crime unit that led to the seizure of Hive servers and websites,\ndismantling its network.[260]\n\nDespite these successes, the Board heard that law enforcement-to-law enforcement information sharing can still be a\nchallenge. Due to budgetary constraints, limited personnel are devoted to such cooperation in the cyber context, for\nexample FBI has approximately 22 cyber-specific assistant legal attachés and DOJ has only one prosecutor focusing on\ncoordinating international disruption operations, thereby limiting the number of planned coordinated operations that\ncan be conducted at any given time.[261] Legal frameworks and practices can also differ across countries, limiting the\navailable consequences for cybercriminals or law enforcement’s ability to act against threat actors in certain countries\n(e.g., countries that traditionally serve as safe havens for cybercriminals, such as the Russian Federation [Russia],\nPeople’s Republic of China [PRC], Islamic Republic of Iran [Iran], and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea [DPRK,\nalso known as North Korea]).[262, 263] Additionally, countries may have different requirements for both informal and\nformal law enforcement information sharing, which in some cases must be conducted pursuant to the requirements of\nnegotiated mutual legal assistance treaties that are often executed by a limited number of law enforcement personnel\nin each country.[264] Finally, threat actor groups operated across many personas or group names and were also tracked\nunder multiple identifiers [265] across the cybersecurity industry, making it difficult to achieve consensus on the makeup\nof the groups and even their exploits in some cases.[266]\n\n_Victim Engagement_\n\nFBI faced challenges when engaging victim organizations following an incident due to the lack of pre-existing, trusted\nrelationships with victims and their outside counsel; victims’ lack of familiarity with information-sharing mechanisms\nand protections; the lack of a continuous flow of information between victims and the FBI; multiple government entities\nrequesting information from victims; and initial questions about attribution that may delay the assignment of agents\nwith experience on the underlying threat groups. [267, 268]\n\nThe Board heard from FBI that, following a high-profile incident, victims are often contacted by multiple government\nagencies with varying information needs, such as information regarding impact on victim company operations and\nthreat actor TTPs and IOCs that are necessary to disrupt the threat actors' ongoing or future efforts. Such inquiries can\ntake a victim’s incident response team away from critical recovery efforts and restoring business operations, delaying\nthe reconstitution of services, and potentially causing further financial or reputational damage, or other consequences.\nFBI recognizes the need to balance the drive to pursue the threat actors and other governmental information\nrequirements with the need to allow the victim’s incident response efforts to continue unimpeded. [269]\n\n_Juvenile Offenders_\n\nMany of Lapsus$ members’ high-profile arrests involved juvenile members (other threat groups likely have similar\ndemographics). Some evidence from cybersecurity researchers suggests that existing perceptions, such as a lack of\nsufficient consequences for minors who engage in cybercrime, do not effectively deter some young people from\nrepeatedly engaging in malicious behavior even when identified by law enforcement.[270, 271] For example, on March 24,\n2022, media outlets reported that the City of London Police arrested seven juveniles in relation to the Lapsus$\n\n260 Office of Public Affairs; FBI, “U.S. Department of Justice Disrupts Hive Ransomware Variant,” January 26, 2023,\n[https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-department-justice-disrupts-hive-ransomware-variant](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-department-justice-disrupts-hive-ransomware-variant)\n261 DOJ, Response to CSRB Request for Information.\n[262 The White House, “National Cybersecurity Strategy,” March 2, 2023, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf)\n[content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf)\n263 Office of Public Affairs; DOJ, “Seven International Cyber Defendants, Including “Apt41” Actors, Charged In Connection With Computer\n[Intrusion Campaigns Against More Than 100 Victims Globally,” September 16, 2020, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\n[cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\n264 FBI and CISA Panel Interview, CSRB Meeting.\n265 Technology Company, CSRB Meeting.\n266 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n267 FBI and CISA Panel Interview, CSRB Meeting.\n268 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n269 FBI and CISA Panel Interview, CSRB Meeting.\n270 Zhadan, Anna; Cybernews, “Teen cyber cartels: when world’s most prolific cybercriminals are minors,” October 13, 2022,\n[https://www.cybernews.com/editorial/teen-cyber-cartels](https://www.cybernews.com/editorial/teen-cyber-cartels)\n271 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 22\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup.[272] However, shortly after the arrests, Lapsus$ announced it was “back from vacation” on March 29, posting a\nteaser screenshot of exfiltrated data and administrator credentials on its Telegram channel.[273] Although juveniles are\noften swiftly released from custody, thus calling into question the level of disruption and impact from the juvenile\njustice system,[274] FBI reported that it last observed Lapsus$ activity in September 2022 and assessed that the\ndecrease in activity was likely due to the arrests of Lapsus$ members.[275]\n\nThreat groups’ recruitment of juveniles is a systemic issue.[276] Forums and online games operate as pipelines for\nrecruiting and developing juveniles. In one example, a security researcher observed a Lapsus$ member presenting\nearly warning signs when the member posted on forums about network exploitation when as young as 11 or 12. The\nBoard heard from a security researcher who believed that juvenile recruitment in cybercrime is a systemic issue with\ninsufficient attention in the cyber ecosystem, as threats posed by juveniles are commonly underprioritized.[277] Juvenile\nenforcement is further governed by certain procedures and laws that are not applicable to adult prosecutions.[278]\n\n\nJuvenile Pathways into Cybercrime\n\n\nSome studies have found that adolescents can start hacking between the ages of 10 and 15,[279] primarily learning\ntheir skills through online forums and websites. This has a particular nexus with the development of cheats for\npopular video games.[280] Forums, including those where game tips are shared and discussed, effectively serve as\n“talent development” pipelines for criminal elements that openly recruit juvenile and novice participants.[281, 282]\nSandbox games, where players have a high degree of freedom to explore and interact, are acting as a gateway for\nminors to develop technical skills that can be leveraged for malicious intent.[283] Sandbox games also offer an avenue\nfor turning in-game currency into real money, and researchers have noted the intersection of a monetary incentive\nand a lack of adult supervision is a factor in adolescent participation in online criminal communities.[284] Criminal\ngangs, in turn, exploit adolescents’ legal status in the criminal justice system, redirecting repercussions that could be\nimposed on adult threat actors operating in the background. Some members of Lapsus$ and its related groups seem\nto have followed this path.[285]\n\n\n272 Peters, Jay; The Verge, “Seven teenagers arrested in connection with the Lapsus$ hacking group,” March 24, 2022,\n[https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994563/lapsus-hacking-group-london-police-arrest-microsoft-nvidia](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994563/lapsus-hacking-group-london-police-arrest-microsoft-nvidia)\n[273 Lisa Vaas; Threatpost, “Lapsus$ ‘Back from Vacation,’” March 30, 2022, https://www.threatpost.com/lapsus-back-from-](https://www.threatpost.com/lapsus-back-from-vacation/179156)\n[vacation/179156](https://www.threatpost.com/lapsus-back-from-vacation/179156)\n274 NCJFCJ, “Juvenile Delinquency Guidelines: Improving Court Practice in Juvenile Delinquency Cases,” July 1, 2005,\n[https://www.ncjfcj.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Juvenile-Delinquency-Guidelines.pdf](https://www.ncjfcj.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Juvenile-Delinquency-Guidelines.pdf)\n275 FBI, CSRB Meeting.\n[276 Beaming, “Why do young people commit cyber crime?” July 24, 2018, https://www.beaming.co.uk/insights/young-people-get-cybercrime](https://www.beaming.co.uk/insights/young-people-get-cybercrime)\n277 Security Researcher 1, CSRB Meeting.\n278 Jarrett, H.

FINDINGS\n\nThe Board’s findings and conclusions are the result of its independent review. They are based on information gleaned\nfrom literature searches, interviews, requests for information, and analysis of public, private, and government source\ninformation. The Board relied upon the voluntary participation of numerous organizations affected by this intrusion set.\n\nThe findings and conclusions in this section are not intended to assign blame or fault to any individual or collective\nparties, but rather to highlight opportunities where the community can understand lessons and apply safety\nimprovements for the future.\n\n#### 2.1. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS \n\nMost organizations were not prepared to prevent the attacks described in this report, but most were able to rapidly\nchange their security programs to account for vulnerabilities and make improvements to thwart future attacks.\nCompanies that had prepared for the possibility of these kinds of attacks, against their own infrastructure as well as\ntheir suppliers, proved most resilient.\n\nThe complex intersecting relationships between telecommunications providers and BPOs with their customers and\nclients were favored targets of the threat actors. The exploitation of insiders and insider processes in the supply chain\nof many organizations, especially, added an extra level of complexity for mitigating the attacks across the broader\necosystem. Unsurprisingly, successful social engineering techniques were also effective for atypical business\nprocesses, such as EDRs.\n\nThe role of information sharing with law enforcement and the broader ecosystem played a vital role in the mitigation of\nattacks and disruption of threat actors. This is, however, an area with ongoing challenges. Organizations still experience\nfriction in their ability or willingness to share information about attacks due to confusion about the government’s role,\nor perceived negative consequences of making attack details known, or a lack of familiarity with legal authorities\ndesigned to encourage such sharing. International and juvenile criminals also frustrate the under-resourced U.S. law\nenforcement apparatus.\n\nFinally, threat actors’ unauthorized access and theft of sensitive and proprietary data, in tandem with extortion,\nsubjected targeted companies to repercussions, including reputational damage, service disruption, and regulatory\nimplications.\n\n#### 2.2. IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT (IAM)\n\nIdentity and access management (IAM) weaknesses were a consistent theme in attacks across all targeted entities and\npresent opportunities to make ongoing improvements.\n\nIn the past decade, the emphasis on MFA has driven the adoption of more secure solutions to improve resiliency\nagainst attacks and phishing in particular. [291] Enterprise and consumer adoption of MFA has been a beneficial step\nforward away from use of just passwords for authentication. However, the Board’s review found that the types of MFA\nused broadly in the online ecosystem today are not sufficient for most organizations or consumers defending against\nthe type of attacks described in this report.[292] In particular, OTP delivery and push notifications using SMS and voice\ncalls (and even email) are vulnerable to social engineering and SIM swap attacks, and the attacker ecosystem is readily\ncapable of exploiting these weaknesses. A lucrative SIM swap criminal market is enabling pay-for-access to victim\n\n291 The cybersecurity community has advocated for increased MFA adoption for over a decade, with modest success outcomes. For example,\nadoption of MFA for customers in the banking industry has increased substantially.

However, adopting advanced MFA capabilities remains a challenge for many\norganizations and individual consumers due to workflow and usability issues.[297] The Board concurs that usable\nsolutions will be necessary to evolve toward a more secure and passwordless user experience.[298, 299]\n\nMost of the attackers leveraged some form of social engineering at all stages of the attack chain, using a dynamic mix\nof phishing, vishing, and smishing to obtain passwords for initial entry, obtain sensitive information about the targeted\norganization, effect SIM swapping and call forwarding, negate ZTA (with device additions), and achieve other farreaching consequences. This tracks closely with industry observations on the human element being a factor in most\nbreaches,[300] and organizations will need to take additional measures to counter the effects of social engineering.\nExpensive endpoint security solutions were not an effective control to protect enterprise identities against social\nengineering.\n\nAttackers leveraging the “infostealer” malware ecosystem to buy target entity login credentials (“access as a service”)\nwas a highly effective means of initial entry in many of the attacks perpetuated by these threat actors.[301] The active\ndevelopment and deployment of malware toolkits (“malware as a service”) to steal web session cookies and other\ncredentials from victim systems for later use has evolved into a lucrative and pernicious global pay-for-credentials\nunderground market, whereby low-skill attacks can be initiated for a few thousand dollars and then deployed effectively\nagainst even well-defended organizations. Defense strategies against these types of attacks rely on endpoint security\ncontrols, and additional layers of defense are necessary to curb the increasing trend.\n\n293 Fraudulent SIM Swapping has been a problem for many years; an early example occurred in South Africa in 2007.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS VULNERABILITIES\n\nThe Board heard from many experts that telecommunications providers are providing the government, enterprises,\nonline commerce, and consumers with critical infrastructure. Threat actors clearly understand the role\ntelecommunications providers play in the ecosystem and are targeting those providers to gain access to their\ncustomers. The defense of telecommunications infrastructure, service offerings, and operational processes that govern\ntheir business transactions is of vital importance for the nation’s security.[302, 303]\n\nThe Board determined that customers are at risk when attackers can impersonate them and initiate changes to their\nmobile phone service, including for SIM swaps (when getting a new phone), number porting (when changing\ntelecommunications providers), setting up call forwarding, and so on. The Board heard that improving these processes\nis challenging, as telecommunications providers need to maintain low-friction customer experiences for a wide range of\nuser needs and account for unique and emergent situations, including domestic abuse, loss of identification cards, and\nglobal travel. [304] Furthermore, the carriers currently have limited options for identity verification and other solutions may\nnot be scalable.\n\nThe Board learned through attackers’ public comments and interviews with targeted entities that attackers can socially\nengineer, coerce, or bribe telecommunications staff, including those in customer support centers, retail stores, and\nelsewhere. In comparable industries, such as banking, where employees need to access sensitive personal data to\nservice customers, additional advanced insider threat controls and strong identity verification can be helpful in\npreventing threat actors from tricking, coercing, or bribing staff to act on their behalf.[305 ]\n\nThe security of telecommunications infrastructure that provides service to customers is vital to the security of these\ntransactions. In several instances, the threat actors leveraged known vulnerabilities to hijack telecommunications tools,\nplacing backdoors for initial entry or otherwise modifying their behavior. This underscores the importance of using\nrobust software development lifecycle and secure-by-default coding and system management practices to design,\nimplement, and maintain internal systems over their lifetime.\n\nTelecommunications provider retail stores were also an effective avenue of attack, with attackers planting malware on\npoint-of-sale systems and stealing retailer devices with privileged access to make fraudulent changes to customer\nmobile phone service. Attackers also co-opted employees as insiders in retail stores,[306] a trend that is challenging to\ncounter as these jobs are typically lower pay with low-vetted personnel, including juveniles, who can move untracked\nbetween companies.\n\n#### 2.4. RESILIENCY WITH A FOCUS ON BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCING (BPO)\n\nThe Board found that the threat actors had a remarkable understanding of their targets’ core business, associated\nbusiness processes, and their weaknesses. In some instances, they successfully leveraged low-complexity attack\nmethods that circumvented security preventative and detective controls. Even well-defended companies fell prey, but\nthose with layered, mature defense-in-depth controls were most resilient, including use of ZTA, strong authentication,\nrobust detection, adaptable MFA capabilities, vulnerability management programs, response plans, and awareness\n\n302 The importance of telecommunications industry defense is globally recognized. In the past decade, coordinated attacks and criminal\nrings aimed at telecommunications providers gave rise to new efforts to bolster and mandate security improvements. For example, see:\nIndustrial Cyber, “Cybersecurity issues in telecoms sector call for protection of network infrastructure and availability,” January 29, 2023,\n[https://industrialcyber.co/features/cybersecurity-issues-in-telecoms-sector-call-for-protection-of-network-infrastructure-and-availability](https://industrialcyber.co/features/cybersecurity-issues-in-telecoms-sector-call-for-protection-of-network-infrastructure-and-availability)\n303 The U.S. government is asserting more stringent guidance and requirements for the security of telecommunications infrastructure and\nservices. For example, see: CISA, “NSTAC Report to the President: Strategy for Increasing Trust in the Information and Communications\n_[Technology and Services Ecosystem,” February 21, 2023, https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/NSTAC_Strategy_for_Increasing_Trust_Report_%282-21-23%29_508_0.pdf)_\n[04/NSTAC_Strategy_for_Increasing_Trust_Report_%282-21-23%29_508_0.pdf; Executive Office of the President, “Establishing the](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/NSTAC_Strategy_for_Increasing_Trust_Report_%282-21-23%29_508_0.pdf)\n_Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector,” April 8, 2020,_\n[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/08/2020-07530/establishing-the-committee-for-the-assessment-of-foreign-](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/08/2020-07530/establishing-the-committee-for-the-assessment-of-foreign-participation-in-the-united-states)\n[participation-in-the-united-states](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/08/2020-07530/establishing-the-committee-for-the-assessment-of-foreign-participation-in-the-united-states)\n304 Technology Company, CSRB Meeting.\n305 Eggenschwiler, Jacqueline et al.; Computer Fraud & Security, “Insider Threat Response and Recovery Strategies of Financial Service\n_[Firms,” November 15, 2016, https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/9225/2016_cfs_ean-author-final.pdf](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/9225/2016_cfs_ean-author-final.pdf)_\n306 The Board heard examples of co-opted retail employees (“innies”) being paid as little as USD 500-1000 to perform SIM swaps.

These organizations either fully repelled or quickly recovered from attacks, with little long-term impact on their\nbusiness.\n\nOther organizations that had not matured their security controls had more challenges recovering, and, in some cases,\nwere hindered by misaligned cybersecurity budgets.[307] For example, BYOD policies are cost efficient as they enable\nemployees to use their own computers. However, BYOD enabled the threat actors studied for this report to pivot into\ncorporate environments after compromising employees’ personal devices and accounts. The trend of using more costeffective workforce options, such as BPOs, for sensitive business workflows was another example of how cost-saving\nmechanisms may not be in line with an organization’s threat model.\n\nEmployee awareness and insider risk management factored heavily into whether organizations defended well against\nthis class of threat actors. The threat actors impersonated a wide range of legitimate company personnel via phishing,\nsmishing, and vishing to trick employees into acting on their behalf, for example by accessing customer records. These\nsocial engineering tactics may require prevention, detection, and response capabilities that mirror insider threat\nprograms so that privileged access cannot be abused by a threat actor leveraging an employee’s account.[308] Designing\nemployee awareness programs that cover this specific class of threat actors was also helpful in some organizations for\nearly detection and resiliency against attacks.\n\nEnterprise-wide security hygiene was a major factor in whether organizations successfully repelled attacks. The Board\nheard of several intrusions that involved exploiting, for example, weak MFA implementations or misconfigured or\nunpatched AD infrastructure, which gave the threat actors their opportunity. Standard network and system-level\nvisibility (telemetry) and programmable detection were also critical for organizations looking for past and ongoing attack\nactivity. The Board concurs with the views of several briefers in determining that adopting perceived advanced, novel,\nor sophisticated (and often expensive) security solutions cannot replace the need for basic security hygiene and\ncapabilities.[309]\n\nHaving established and practiced response plans was the final important element of resiliency. For example, in\ninstances where the threat actors took over internal communications used by the response teams, organizations that\nhad previously setup out-of-band communications were able to avoid having their activities monitored or interrupted.\nPreviously established industry and law enforcement relationships also enabled organizations to quickly attribute the\nattacks and share best practices for mitigating the threat actors. However, the Board also heard that some\norganizations may be hesitant to share information regarding security attacks due to concerns over loss of attorneyclient privilege, regulatory and legal implications, and reputational damage. These challenges are ongoing hinderances\nto frictionless collaboration.\n\n##### 2.4.1. Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Risks\n\nThese attacks demonstrated how threat actors can exploit BPOs so the threat actors can then attack their clients, and\nhow other serious threat actor groups, including nation-states, are using this class of attacks as a model. The U.S.\ngovernment, the cybersecurity community, and BPO client organizations need to understand the specific risk exposures\nin the outsourcing sector, given the role BPOs are playing for organizations, including those supporting critical\ninfrastructure.\n\nThe BPO operating structure related to their clients’ trusted access and sensitive data enables threat actors to access\ntargeted entities by bypassing the target’s defenses and going through the sometimes lesser defenses of the BPO.\nSome organizations the Board spoke with had not previously considered their BPOs in their attack surface and risk\nmanagement programs, even though they hold sensitive levels of access to clients’ systems and data. Many BPO\nemployees and workflows were onboarded and risk-managed differently from the client organization, leading to\npotential risk exposures and governance challenges for both the BPO and its clients. Industry-gathered data mirror\nthese findings closely and suggest that many organizations lack confidence that a breach at their third-party supplier\n\n307 Gordon, Lawrence A. et al.; Journal of Cybersecurity (Volume 6), “Integrating cost–benefit analysis into the NIST Cybersecurity Framework\n_[via the Gordon–Loeb Model,” March 30, 2020, https://www.doi.org/10.1093/cybsec/tyaa005](https://www.doi.org/10.1093/cybsec/tyaa005)_\n308 Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence and MSTIC; Microsoft, “DEV-0537 criminal actor targeting organizations for data exfiltration and\n_[destruction,” March 22, 2022, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)_\n[organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction)\n309 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 28\n\n\n-----\n\nwould be reported to them and that breaches may be under-reported.[310] The Board noted the broader industry\nconversation on these issues, including the increasing use of the legal system for recourse.[311]\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, many targeted organizations pivoted slowly to improve the security posture at the BPO\nto be commensurate with their own if they could not insource workflows.[312, 313] Other organizations terminated their\npartnerships with BPOs (bringing workflows in-house). Client organizations that remained with their BPOs found it\nchallenging to verify the BPO was upholding sufficient security standards and found few mechanisms for accountability.\nMost legal contractual agreements did not clearly outline the roles and responsibilities between BPOs and their clients\nto support either preventative controls improvement or incident response activities.\n\n#### 2.5. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUVENILE DISRUPTION\n\nThe Board found that while arrests have chilling effects on the cybercriminal community, law enforcement is challenged\nby a lack of sufficient resources devoted to disrupting cybercrime; a hesitancy from victims and their legal advisors to\nreport cybercrimes and share actionable information; vulnerabilities in the processes some providers have for requests\nto obtain consumer data from organizations during emergency situations; and countries that act as safe havens for\ncybercriminal activity. Additionally, the deterrence value of available criminal justice consequences remains limited for\njuvenile cybercrime offenders, and few (and no U.S.-based) cyber-specific intervention programs exist that can help\ndivert potential offenders to legitimate cybersecurity-related activities.\n\nThe Board found that the EDR process creates a significant exposure point for communications services providers\nbecause the process is not standardized across the industry and often lacks a method for authentication and\nvalidation. As a result, threat actors could exploit providers’ employees by spoofing EDR materials using compromised\ngovernment email addresses and official logos. Further, the Board found that EDR process exploitation was not limited\nto Lapsus$, but points to a broader, systematic risk exposure issue, which threat actors can exploit to gain valuable\nintelligence about their targets.\n\n##### 2.5.1. Victim Assistance Operations\n\nThe Board heard that law enforcement is hampered in its efforts to effectively combat cyber threats if victim\norganizations do not report attacks with actionable information. However, targeted organizations and their legal\ncounsel are often unfamiliar with the information-sharing mechanisms and protections for reporting incidents to\ngovernment contacts, which hinders the much-needed flow of information between victims and FBI or other law\nenforcement and diminishes the support the government can provide to a victim, similarly situated victims, and wouldbe victims. These findings indicate that prompt notifications to law enforcement about cyberattacks and above-board\ninformation sharing from organizations increase the likelihood of preserving critical evidence and recovering ransom\npayments or decrypting data, streamline government assistance, prevent uncoordinated government inquiries, and\nallow for more frequent and impactful cybercrime disruptions, all of which are a net cybersecurity benefit for society.\n\nThat said, some organizations the Board spoke to were confused about the federal roles and responsibilities for\ncyberattacks and which agency they should call to receive assistance and aid in future disruptions. The Board\nrecognizes that the federal government has improved its governance and incident response coordination with national\npolicies such as the Presidential Policy Directive 41[314] and its evolving implementation. However, clear messaging to\nthe public and private sector about roles and responsibilities is lacking—in particular, where entities and individuals can\ngo to receive specific services or meet statutory and regulatory reporting requirements. Therefore, the Board endorses\n\n310 In a recent study, only 34% of surveyed respondents believed their third-party suppliers would report a breach to them.

Cybercrime Investigations\n\nThe Board learned that disrupting transnational networks of threat actors presents myriad challenges. Law\nenforcement remains underfunded for resource- and data-intensive investigations against the full breadth of threat\nactors; has complex coordination processes with international partners, including obtaining evidence from multiple\ninternational jurisdictions; faces some victims’ reluctance to report incidents and share actionable information; and is\nrestricted by sovereignties that disregard peacetime norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace or otherwise act\nas safe havens for cybercriminals. But a properly resourced and dedicated investigative team can still find methods to\nimpose consequences on these difficult-to-reach actors, as recently demonstrated by FBI’s Hive decryptor operation,\nSnake malware takedown, and the arrest of several enablers of the ransomware ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, the cybersecurity industry tracks threat actors, which operate under many personas and group names, with\nmultiple identifiers, such as TTPs, target geography, target sector, and motivation. This can delay attributing behaviors\nand attacks to the correct threat actors and may prolong assigning agents with experience to the appropriate case\nconcerning specific threat groups.[316] The National Cybersecurity Strategy[317 ]recognizes many of these challenges,\nindicating that the successful coordination and collaboration of U.S. and international law enforcement and government\npartners, as well as a more agile and well-resourced law enforcement, can counter the threat posed by cybercriminals\nand mitigate existing response challenges.\n\n##### 2.5.3. Early Intervention\n\nLaw enforcement entities face an increasing cadre of technically savvy cybercriminals, some of whom begin their\nmalicious activities as juveniles. However, the juvenile status of certain threat actors can limit federal law\nenforcement’s role and yield lighter penalties under their home countries’ legal frameworks. Depending on the\napplicable laws, the post-conviction punishment for a juvenile is typically not as severe as it would be for an adult.[318]\nNevertheless, juvenile justice issues are not limited to the cyber context and reflect the relevant society’s broader\nconclusions about the criminal culpability and just punishment of minors. As a result, the Board found that less severe\nconsequences may not adequately deter young cybercriminals from re-offending.\n\nTo curb juvenile participation in cybercrime, the Board found that several law enforcement entities are implementing\npreventative tactics and program initiatives [319] that demonstrate cost-effective means to identify and redirect at-risk\njuveniles that can also improve the pool of employable personnel to fill cybersecurity jobs.[320 ]This finding indicates that\nencouraging positive and legal alternatives, for example events at gaming conferences, to channel the energy and\ntechnical savviness of youth may potentially support hobbies and careers that benefit juveniles’ technical skills\nadvancement.\n\nOther last-resort interventions, including non-prosecutorial and deferred prosecutorial disruption,[321] have proven useful\nfor alerting unaware parents to juvenile cybercrime activity and dissuading future activity.\n\n[315 The White House, “National Cybersecurity Strategy,” March 2, 2023, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf)\n[content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf)\n316 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n[317 The White House, “National Cybersecurity Strategy,” March 2, 2023, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf)\n[content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf)\n318 FBI and CISA Panel Interview, CSRB Meeting.\n319 FBI, CSRB Meeting.\n320 Stupp, Catherine; The Wall Street Journal, “Dutch Program Aims to Deter Young Hackers Before They Commit Crimes,” December 21,\n[2020, https://www.wsj.com/articles/dutch-program-aims-to-deter-young-hackers-before-they-commit-crimes-11608546602](https://www.wsj.com/articles/dutch-program-aims-to-deter-young-hackers-before-they-commit-crimes-11608546602)\n321 For an example, see: Holcomb, Jayme W.; DOJ Office of Justice Programs, “Knock and Talks,” August 1, 2006,\n[https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/knock-and-talks](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/knock-and-talks)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 30\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.6. IMPACT ON BUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\nIn aggregate, many organizations experienced costly and destructive impacts from these attacks. However, the Board\nlearned that while some incidents directly affected targeted organizations’ revenue streams, the impact of cyberattacks\non business extends far beyond immediate financial loss.\n\nOrganizations lost control of “crown jewel” intellectual property and consumer data, subjecting them to remediation\nexpenses, consumer notification and monitoring expenses, reputational harm, and litigation risk. As a result, the Board\nlearned that differing costs exist between destructive attacks and data theft. For example, in a ransomware negotiation\nscenario, threat actors can financially impact an organization by destroying its IT infrastructure. However, regulatory\nimplications can culminate in even greater costs to impacted organizations, ultimately giving threat actors more control\nover their targets.[322]\n\nOrganizations also expended time, productivity, and money on incident response, remediation efforts, reputation\nmanagement, and system reconfigurations, as well as other follow-on effects such as termination of contracts (among\nBPOs and client companies) and insurance adjustments. The Board determined the rise in cyberattacks necessitate\ninvestments in security measures and business processes; however, the ongoing cost of maintaining and updating\nthese controls can pose a significant burden to organizations, possibly impacting customer friction, innovation, and\nprofitability.\n\nThe Board found that innocuous personal information such as job titles, employer information, and work locations,\nwhich employees often post on social media, can provide threat actors with enough information to cross-reference\npublic information sources and discover important personal data about critical employees. While reinforcing\noperational security measures may diminish threat actors’ resources for leveraging dangerous harassment techniques,\nlike doxing and swatting, the Board concluded that many of these measures are time-consuming and severely interrupt\nan employee’s private life.\n\n322 Cybersecurity Company, CSRB Meeting.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 31\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3. RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe Cyber Safety Review Board’s (CSRB, or the Board) recommendations are organized under four themes:\nstrengthening identity and access management (IAM); mitigating telecommunications and reseller vulnerabilities;\nbuilding resiliency across multi-party systems with a focus on business process outsourcers (BPOs); and addressing law\nenforcement challenges and juvenile cybercrime.\n\nThe recommendations outlined in this section reflect the Board’s tasking to identify improvements for cybersecurity and\nmake independent, strategic, and actionable recommendations to the President. The Board calls on organizations to\nimplement improvements to build resiliency against the threats posed by groups like Lapsus$, particularly through\nstronger access controls and authentication methods, and mature risk management for their entire enterprises,\nincluding third party vendors. The Board calls on telecommunications providers to employ stronger security protocols to\nprevent SIM swapping, and on federal regulators such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal\nTrade Commission (FTC) to ensure those improvements are made through appropriate regulatory oversight and\nsupervision. The Board also calls on lawmakers to create and support community programs that disincentivize juveniles\nfrom engaging in, while helping law enforcement deter, cybercrime and ensuring government agencies receive\nadequate funding and resources.\n\n#### 3.1. IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT (IAM)\n\nIAM weaknesses described in this report are some of the most serious vulnerabilities in the digital ecosystem. Dramatic\nimprovements are necessary and will require a “whole of industry” approach to innovate and implement meaningful\nsolutions.\n\n\nNational Cybersecurity Strategy\n\n\nAs laid out in the National Cybersecurity Strategy, the burden of change should fall on the organizations most\ncapable and best positioned to make the digital ecosystem secure and resilient.[323] In line with federal agencies’\nadoption of modern multi-factor authentication (MFA),[324] enterprises should implement appropriate controls and\nalternative authentication factors to better protect their environments, partners, suppliers, and employees. To\nsupport these efforts, the federal government should provide funding, incentives, and guidance for organizations to\nmature their authentication methods and work toward a passwordless world.\n\n\n##### 3.1.1. Everyone Must Progress Toward a Passwordless World \n\nThe attacks described in this report illustrate how easy attackers find obtaining authentication strings, including\nplaintext passwords, application programming interface (API) keys, session tokens, one-time passcodes, and other\ncredentials via phishing and malware, as well as gaining access to password databases and credentials stored in\nsource code. The digital ecosystem needs to prioritize moving beyond use of text-based strings for authentication.\n\n_Technology Providers Should Design and Deliver Secure IAM Solutions by Default_\n\nThe Board recommends that technology providers innovate and deliver easy-to-use, secure-by-default IAM solutions\nthat eliminate the need for text-based strings for authentication.\n\n  - Web and mobile application developers should leverage Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)2-compliant, hardwarebacked solutions built into consumer devices by default.[325, 326] Use of these built-in tokens should have easy\n\n[323 The White House, “National Cybersecurity Strategy,” March 2, 2023, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf)\n[content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf)\n324 OMB, “M-22-09: Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles,” January 26, 2022,\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf)\n325 FIDO Alliance, “Android Now FIDO2 Certified, Accelerating Global Migration Beyond Passwords,” February 25, 2019,\n[https://www.fidoalliance.org/android-now-fido2-certified-accelerating-global-migration-beyond-passwords](https://www.fidoalliance.org/android-now-fido2-certified-accelerating-global-migration-beyond-passwords)\n[326 FIDO Alliance, “Expanded Support for FIDO Authentication in iOS and MacOS,” July 1, 2020, https://www.fidoalliance.org/expanded-](https://www.fidoalliance.org/expanded-support-for-fido-authentication-in-ios-and-macos)\n[support-for-fido-authentication-in-ios-and-macos](https://www.fidoalliance.org/expanded-support-for-fido-authentication-in-ios-and-macos)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 32\n\n\n-----\n\nintegration with applications and web-based services, leveraging standards such as WebAuthn[327] and\ntechnologies such as Passkeys.[328]\n\n- Technology providers should immediately begin to transition away from Short Message Service (SMS) and\nvoice MFA. Transitioning from SMS and voice MFA to stronger MFA methods is consistent with National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-63B (Rev. 3) and other globally accepted guidance.[329, 330, ][331]\nSee Appendix B for further details on the strengths and weaknesses of different authentication methods.\n\n- Operating system developers, web browser designers, and hardware manufacturers should address the\nwidespread theft and monetization of authentication cookies, such as via infostealer malware, by\nimplementing secure-by-default safety mechanisms that protect these credentials. For example, online service\nproviders could automatically and silently reissue cookies, possibly every hour, to reduce the window of\nopportunity for attackers to reuse them.\n\nSecure by Design\n\n\n`o` Hardware-backed schemes could help raise the bar for\ndefending against cookie theft. For example, proposals like\nDevice Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) and Browser\nProof-of-Possession (BPoP) aim to mitigate cookie and\ntoken theft techniques by providing application-level\nbinding and browser-initiated refreshes.[333, ][334]\n\n_The U.S. Government Should Provide Standards, Guidance, and Tools to_\n_Support Organizations’ Authentication Journeys_\n\n\nIn 2023, CISA introduced an initiative to\ndrive technology providers to prioritize\nconsumer safety in every stage of the\nproduct development lifecycle. Building in\nrobust IAM solutions would be an\nimportant step to achieving more security\nand reduced risk for consumers.[332]\n\n\nThe United States (U.S.) government is responsible for shaping the digital ecosystem in a direction that puts the user\nfirst and harmonizes security and accessibility. The National Cybersecurity Strategy commits the U.S. government to\ntake urgent steps in defending today’s digital ecosystem while simultaneously building a more sustainable and resilient\nfuture.[335] Modernizing and securing authentication is at the forefront of this approach. The Office of Management and\nBudget’s (OMB) Zero Trust Strategy and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) More Than a\nPassword campaign emphasize the importance of MFA.[336, 337] The Board recommends that the U.S. government\nsupport organizations’ authentication maturity roadmaps by providing guidance that addresses their respective realities\nand dependencies.\n\nThe U.S. government, specifically OMB, NIST, and CISA, in consultation with the Office of the National Cyber Director\nand other Departments and Agencies, as appropriate, should collaborate with industry stakeholders to develop and\npromote a secure authentication roadmap that can help organizations make the transition to a world without\npasswords. This roadmap should include standards and frameworks, guidance, tools, and technology specific to\norganizations’ needs and circumstances that account for size, industry, threat profile, as well as privacy and civil\nliberties considerations. This guidance should also enable organizations to assess their authentication maturity and\n\n327 Balfanz, Dirk et al.; W3C, “Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key Credentials Level 1,” March 4, 2019,\n[https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-1](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-1)\n[328 Bertocci, Vittorio; Auth0, “Our Take on Passkeys,” August 24, 2022, https://auth0.com/blog/our-take-on-passkeys](https://auth0.com/blog/our-take-on-passkeys)\n329 NIST, “SP 800-63B, Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management,” June 2017 (updated March 2, 2020),\n[https://www.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b](https://www.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b)\n[330 CISA, “Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA,” October 31, 2022, https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf)\n[implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf)\n331 ENISA and CERT-EU, “Joint Publication 22-01: Boosting your Organisation’s Cyber Resilience,” February 14, 2022,\n[https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/boosting-your-organisations-cyber-resilience/@@download/fullReport](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/boosting-your-organisations-cyber-resilience/@@download/fullReport)\n[332 CISA, “Secure by Design, Secure by Default,” https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign)\n333 The proposal for DBSC aims to reduce account takeover via cookie theft.

Organizations Should Prioritize Efforts to Reduce the Efficacy of Social Engineering\n\nAs organizations integrate more robust authentication capabilities within their environments, they have an opportunity\nto reduce the efficacy of social engineering attacks. This will require prioritizing culture alongside more effective\ntechnology capabilities.\n\n  - Organizations should begin to require an explicit authentication event using a form of phishing-resistant MFA,\nsuch as FIDO2-backed tokens, for each sensitive transaction executed on their systems. The definition of a\nsensitive transaction will be dependent on the nature of the organization’s business but may include accessing\na sensitive customer record; using privileged access in the infrastructure, for example to raise privileges to\nAdministrator; or performing a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) swap.\n\n  - Organizations should educate employees on a frequent and regular basis, possibly monthly, and in a relatable\nand easily digestible manner, on the latest threat landscape trends and how to prevent them. Organizations\nshould foster a security culture where employees are incentivized to report potential intrusions while training\nemployees on how to identify and respond to creative social engineering attacks.[338]\n\nThe U.S. government should spearhead the development and promotion of resources that help organizations develop a\nrobust security culture, including monthly training material and example protocols that help deter common social\nengineering techniques. In doing this, the government should continue fostering cross-sector collaboration and\ninformation sharing between organizations, government agencies, and cybersecurity experts.\n\n#### 3.2. TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND RESELLER VULNERABILITES\n\nAs observed in this review, threat actors targeted telecommunications providers and the critical infrastructure in which\nthey operate. Customers and retailers are at risk for social engineering and other manipulation schemes, which allow\nthreat actors to access sensitive information and backdoors to additional targets. The telecommunications industry, as\nwell as federal regulators, should take steps to build resiliency against fraudulent activities and help defend individual\ncustomers, retail employees, and the industry as a whole from threat actors.\n\n##### 3.2.1. Build Resiliency Against Fraudulent Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Swapping\n\nTelecommunications providers and resellers should implement countermeasures for SIM swap attacks. While some of\nthese measures will add friction into the customer experience, the Board believes countermeasures are necessary to\nfurther prevent fraudulent SIM swaps, and follow-on crimes, from occurring. To comprehensively address the most\ncommon mechanisms behind fraudulent SIM swaps, telecommunications providers should take the following actions.\n\n_Build Resiliency Against Social Engineering in SIM swapping Procedures to Protect the Consumer_\n\n  - Provide the ability for customers to lock their accounts to prevent SIM swaps. This should lock SIM swap\ncapabilities at all levels of the telecommunications provider’s systems, including backend and customer\nsupport access, operated either by the telecommunications provider directly or their BPOs, vendors, and\npartners. Customers should also be provided with a strong multi-layered identity validation process to unlock\ntheir account for a valid SIM swap.\n\n  - Make strong identity verification for SIM swaps the default on all customer accounts such that customers\nwould have to “opt out” of having enhanced authentication security protections.\n\n  - Treat SIM swaps as a highly privileged action with tight controls on who can perform them. Best practice\ncontrols should be put in place, such as those used in the banking industry.[339] This may include:\n\n338 The Board acknowledges the background context provided by SocialProof Security; CSRB Subcommittee Meeting.\n[339 FDIC, “Banker Resource Center: Information Technology (IT) And Cybersecurity,” https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/information-](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/information-technology)\n[technology](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/information-technology)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 34\n\n\n-----\n\n`o` enforcing a waiting period of up to 24 hours, based on risk modeling, if a customer does not have\nsufficient identity credentials available. This would allow the provider to notify an account holder of an\nattempt to activate a new SIM card on their account, as well as provide the customer a window of\nopportunity to confirm or reject the request;\n\n`o` applying additional measures, such as taking a photo of the SIM swap requester, if strong authentication\ncredentials are unavailable. This measure would create a deterrence for malicious actors while balancing\nthe needs of vulnerable populations such as victims of domestic violence, homeless people, single\nparents, etc., who might not have strong credentials;\n\n`o` requiring strong identity validation before performing a SIM swap while also maintaining robust exceptions\nprocedures if a customer cannot provide this identification. Strong identity validation could include\nproviding two forms of government-issued credentials in person, or through a third-party identity provider\nlike login.gov;\n\n`o` requiring a requestor to use video chat or a comparable tool to visually provide strong credentials when\ncompleting a transaction online or over the phone. If video chat is unavailable, a waiting period of at least\n24 hours would ensue with the same purpose;\n\n`o` providing account holders with a detailed record when a SIM swap occurs, including who initiated the\nrequest, when it was initiated, how the action was performed, and other relevant information;\n\n`o` providing increased, mandatory, frequent, and recurring cybersecurity training focusing on fraudulent SIM\nswaps and insider threats to retail employees and others involved in adding, modifying, and deleting\nphone service;\n\n`o` limiting the number of persons allowed to perform SIM swaps to those trained, reviewed, and trusted, and\nregularly reviewing access permissions;\n\n`o` improving personnel security checks and employee tracking across telecommunications providers and\nretail stores to the extent possible in compliance with applicable employment laws; [340]\n\n`o` limiting collection and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII) with employees to what is\nnecessary for the specific transaction and regularly removing unnecessary data from their systems;\n\n`o` requiring an employee (also partner, vendor, BPO, etc.) issuing the SIM swap request to successfully\ncomplete an authentication challenge when the request is submitted to the system, using a strong MFA\nsolution such as a hardware-backed FIDO key or a biometric authentication;\n\n`o` tracking the number of fraudulent SIM swaps monthly by dealer/reseller and imposing business costs,\nsuch as ceasing to continue business, with those that do not take action to mitigate or stop fraudulent\nswaps; and\n\n`o` handling fraudulent SIM swaps as a crime, including referral of cases to law enforcement.\n\n340 CSRB recognizes that employees suspected of wittingly engaging in fraudulent SIM swaps or repeatedly completing them may not always\nbe subject to criminal or legal action apart from having their employment terminated. While recognizing that employment laws in some\nstates may prohibit a former employer from sharing disciplinary information or reasons for termination, CSRB encourages the\ntelecommunications industry to consider reviewing and where possible, adopting insider threat models and other practices employed by\nindustries such as the financial sector and airports.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 35\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional Methods to Exploit SMS/voice MFA\n\n\nWhile not attributed to the threat actors in this review, the Board heard of additional methods threat actors use to\nexploit SMS/voice MFA that informed its recommendations to telecommunications providers and resellers. Methods\nto initiate a fraudulent SIM swap with internal resources include generating telecommunications provider codes;[341]\nstealing customer account management devices in “smash-and-grabs” at wireless retail stores; deploying malware\non point-of-sale workstations at telecommunications provider stores; and using an automated Telegram bot to abuse\nwireless carriers’ APIs to PII, Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI), and corporate data.[342]\n\nSimilar to SIM swapping is a technique called port-out fraud, where a threat actor impersonates the target to that\nindividual's phone provider to transfer the target’s phone number to an account set up by the threat actor. This tactic\ndirects phone calls and texts that were intended for the target to the threat actor’s phone, allowing the intercept of\nSMS and voice MFA.[343, 344]\n\n\n_Prevent Exploitation of Vulnerabilities on Point-of-Sale Systems through Improved Asset Management_\n\n  - Detect and mitigate theft and abuse of point-of-sale devices and tablets at retail stores that are used to\nprocess customer transactions. If the devices are stolen or abused in-store, they should be rendered unable to\nperform any privileged actions, including SIM swaps, by wiping them remotely within a standardized timeframe\nor revoking trusted access until they can be properly assessed.\n\n  - Use ZTA concepts in retail stores to prevent untrusted or new devices from joining the network, including\nvirtual systems. This should include regular vulnerability scanning and subsequently de-trusting devices that do\nnot have up-to-date patching or configurations.\n\n_Apply Measures to Harden the Technology Stack_\n\n  - Assess and harden all applications and APIs used to manage customer accounts, including those enabling SIM\nswaps. These applications and APIs should be considered sensitive and use industry best practices, including\nsecure coding principles;[345] server and application hardening, for example transmission confidentiality and\nintegrity and information flow enforcement;[346] and routine third-party audits and penetration tests.\n\n##### 3.2.2. Strengthen Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Oversight and Enforcement Activities\n\nOrganizations’ and consumers’ reliance on mobile phones and cellular service make them essential components of the\nnation’s telecommunications practices. Fraudulent SIM swaps undermine the security and reliability of the\ntelecommunications ecosystem. While fraudulent SIM swaps happen relatively infrequently, the consequences can be\nextraordinarily damaging and disruptive. Victims are often impacted both financially and physically, as the threat actors\nare often involved in “traditional” crimes such as theft, kidnapping, extortion, murder, and sexual abuse.[347]\n\nTelecommunications industry regulators need to standardize and facilitate the adoption of best practices to reduce or\neliminate fraudulent SIM swaps. FCC and FTC should strengthen oversight and enforcement activities focused on\nfraudulent SIM swapping transactions with the following actions.\n\n341 Security Researcher 1, CSRB Meeting.\n342 Security Researcher 2, CSRB Meeting.\n[343 FCC, “Port-Out Fraud Targets Your Private Accounts,” September 16, 2019, https://www.fcc.gov/port-out-fraud-targets-your-private-](https://www.fcc.gov/port-out-fraud-targets-your-private-accounts)\n[accounts](https://www.fcc.gov/port-out-fraud-targets-your-private-accounts)\n344 Lee, Kevin et al.; USENIX Association, Sixteenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS 2020), “An Empirical Study of\n_[Wireless Carrier Authentication for SIM Swaps,” August 10, 2020, https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2020-lee.pdf](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2020-lee.pdf)_\n[345 Turpin, Keith et al.; OWASP, “Secure Coding Principles: Quick Reference Guide,” December 2022, https://www.owasp.org/www-project-](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)\n[secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)\n346 NIST, “SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations,” September 2020,\n[https://www.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5](https://www.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5)\n347 The Board acknowledges publicly available reports of SIM swaps occurring as recently as 2023, including instances where SIM swappers\nallegedly stole tens of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency; took over social media accounts to extort their victims financially and sexually;\n[and participated in homicides, swatting, and other crimes.

The\nbanking industry has similar controls and\nregulatory oversight.[349]\n\n- Incentivize better security at\ntelecommunications providers by enacting\npenalties for fraudulent SIM swaps or lax\ncontrols.\n\n\nIn July 2023, the FCC announced for consideration new\nrules to protect consumers from SIM swap and port-out\nfraud. The proposed Report and Order attempt to protect\ncustomers by revising the FCC’s CPNI Local Number\nPortability (LNP) rules to require wireless providers to\nadopt secure methods of authenticating a customer\nbefore redirecting a customer’s phone number to a new\ndevice or provider.[348] While the rules are still pending\nfinal vote at the time of publication, continued focus on\nand specific measures to prevent fraudulent SIM swaps\nwill help build resiliency across the cyber ecosystem.\n\n\n#### 3.3. RESILIENCY WITH A FOCUS ON BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCERS (BPOs)\n\nOrganizations, including associated BPOs and service providers, with robust cybersecurity programs that follows\nindustry-standard practices are better positioned to defend against attacks by external threat actors. Designing,\nbuilding, and maintaining a strong security framework does not create perfect defense, but it forms the essential\nfoundation for ongoing risk management of complex and dynamic business needs, technology, and attacker tradecraft.\n\n##### 3.3.1. Plan for Disruptive Cyber Intrusions and Invest in Prevention, Response, and Recovery Capabilities\n\nOrganizations should create roadmaps to rapidly adopt emerging modern architectures that can best defend against\ndisruptive cyber-intrusions caused by groups such as Lapsus$ and related threat actors.\n\n  - Organizations should carefully tune their cybersecurity program to adopt best practices in the NIST\nCybersecurity Framework (CSF),[350] with a particular emphasis on:\n\n`o` robust information technology (IT) asset management practices to identify an organization’s critical\ninfrastructure (CI), provide adequate visibility of networks, and map attack surfaces to the greatest extent\npossible;\n\n`o` effective implementation of least privilege access methodology and auditing, especially for assets,\naccounts, and actions that are highly sensitive; and\n\n`o` insightful and actionable monitoring capabilities enabled through sound, centralized log management\npolicies.

We should seek to expand liability and privilege protections\nso victims can engage efficiently and without risk, with non-regulatory federal government agencies. In recent years, Congress and the U.S.\ngovernment have taken important steps to reduce barriers to cybersecurity-related information sharing by the private sector, including the\nCybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015) and the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA).\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 39\n\n\n-----\n\n  - determine whether to report additional details about the incident to the government or a trust community to\nspread awareness about the threat, reduce the likelihood of a similar event happening to others, and further\nthe relationships by which advance warning of future threats may be shared.\n\n##### 3.3.2. Business Process Outsourcers (BPOs) and Client Companies Should Mature and Strengthen their Risk Management Practices Reflecting their Shared Risk, and the United States (U.S.) Government Should Support These Efforts\n\n_Client Organizations and BPOs Should Agree Upon a Shared Responsibility Model for Cybersecurity Risk, Enshrined in_\n_Contracts_\n\nOrganizations should incorporate cybersecurity requirements in contract language to ensure that BPO operations meet\nthe same level of security as internal company practices. This should include clear definitions of the service level\nagreements (SLAs) that enable monitoring and risk management.\n\nIn some circumstances, such as BPOs handling highly sensitive transactions, consider securing BPO staff operations\nsimilar to the standards for client company staff, including BPO staff use of client-owned hardware and client-driven\ncybersecurity processes. Generally, these contractual requirements should consider:\n\n  - the use of strong authentication for access management, especially for sensitive transactions (see\nRecommendation 3.1.1);\n\n  - training for BPO employees with respect to their client organization;\n\n  - data handling, processing, and storage;\n\n  - secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) management;\n\n  - device management and compliance for BPO employees; and\n\n  - co-ownership of incident response, with clear roles and responsibilities (see Recommendation 3.3.1).\n\n_BPOs Should Establish Mature Information Sharing Relationships with their Industry Peers_\n\nRecognizing that attackers look for sector-specific vulnerabilities, BPOs should grow and mature grassroots information\nsharing efforts, potentially establish an ISAC or ISAO (or similar trust community) that facilitates information sharing,\ndevelop best practices, and coordinate industry development and delivery of training based on recurring threats.\n\n  - When developing pre-incident relationships, BPOs should consider ahead of time how best to engage during an\nincident. This pre-incident coordination and planning will likely improve the effectiveness of government and\nvictim response and empower the U.S. government to prevent future attacks against other would-be victims.\n\n_The U.S. Government Should Drive Mechanisms to Gain Visibility into Aggregate Risk Associated with BPOs_\n\nThe Board recommends that CISA support the establishment and operation of trust communities among BPOs and\ntheir clients. Additionally, CISA should encourage private sector data set creators, such as those that author threat\nintelligence summaries, to tag their underlying incident history data to get increased visibility on BPO incidents and\nsupport community collaboration.\n\n#### 3.4. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUVENILE CYBERCRIMES DISINCENTIVES\n\nDisruption of threat actors and their ongoing attacks are necessary components of a resilient and robust ecosystem\nthat can keep the nation safe from the type of criminal activities described in this report. This requires a collaboration\nbetween law enforcement, the private sector, and international partners. The ability to disrupt the attacks by Lapsus$\n\nHowever, the Board’s interactions with certain victims, or lack of interactions with other victims who have declined to speak with the Board,\nreveal that more work needs to be done to ensure that concerns about legal liability relating to an intrusion, and actions that victims and\ntheir counsel take to minimize exposure to such liability, are still inhibiting the sharing of cybersecurity information, leading to a net negative\nfor collective cybersecurity and public safety.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 40\n\n\n-----\n\nand related groups was complicated by several factors: the juvenile status of some of the threat actors; geographically\ndispersed threat actors; and the cross-border nature of the crimes. The following recommendations emphasize the\nneed for an international and “whole-of-society” effort to mitigate these challenges.\n\n##### 3.4.1. Advance “Whole-of-Society” Programs and Mechanisms for Juvenile Cybercrime Prevention and Intervention\n\nThe Board recommends developing stronger U.S. juvenile cybercrime prevention and intervention programs. For\nexample, the Cyber Offender Prevention Squad (COPS), part of the Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU),\nstarted an information campaign, with workshops and an intervention program to deter young people from online\ncriminal activity, offering positive and legal alternatives. Their initiatives focused on preventing potential offenders as\nwell as engaging prior offenders to decrease recidivism.[364] These programs arose out of a realization that young\ncybercrime offenders, unlike counterparts operating primarily in the physical world, are often able to evade parental,\neducator, community, and law enforcement scrutiny and intervention on their journey to significant cybercriminal\nactivity. Despite the federal government and the private sector’s expenditure of tens of billions of dollars annually on\ncybersecurity, the Board’s inquiry did not identify any notable juvenile cybercrime prevention and intervention programs\nin the U.S. at the federal government, local government, community, or private sector level.\n\n  - Congress should explore funding juvenile cybercrime prevention programs through national law enforcement\nand national grant-making programs like those managed by Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Office of Justice\nPrograms (OJP), and other appropriate mechanisms.[365]\n\n  - Although federal law enforcement often leads investigations of significant cybercrime groups targeting U.S.based victims, the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act requires that most juvenile hacking prosecutions must be\nbrought in state courts.[366] Congress should explore funding or other mechanisms to ensure continuity and an\neventual prosecution upon the transfer of juvenile cybercrime investigations from federal to state authorities,\nwhich could have the effect of more successfully deterring U.S.-based juvenile hacking and hacking-enabled\ncybercrimes and preventing recidivism.\n\n##### 3.4.2. Increase Timely Reporting of Cyberattacks to Federal Responders\n\nOrganizations experiencing cyberattacks are not currently required to report such crimes to federal law enforcement or\nany other single federal agency. Some may not clearly understand the importance of their reporting of cybercrime\nincidents to law enforcement and other federal agencies that can disrupt ongoing and future incidents and mitigate\nrisks to other potential victims, thereby creating blind spots and hampering collective cybersecurity. Without\ninformation gathered from targeted organizations, the federal government may not be able to understand the larger\nthreat landscape and may be hampered in its timely ability to warn other targeted entities; recommend mitigation\nmeasures; take down malicious infrastructure; seize ill-gotten cryptocurrency or fiat currency; bring those responsible to\njustice; or otherwise disrupt malicious activity. While implementation of required reporting of covered cyber incidents\nand ransom payments by covered entities under the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022\n(CIRCIA), as amended, will improve federal agencies’ visibility significantly, voluntary reporting of confirmed or\nsuspected cyberattacks and suspicious activity will continue to be critical to collective cybersecurity efforts. For such\nreasons, the Board recommends private sector organizations impacted by malicious cyber activity to fortify\n\n[364 Ramaker, S. and Zonderland, L.; inCyber, “Prevention is better than cure,” August 23, 2021, https://www.incyber.org/en/prevention-is-](https://www.incyber.org/en/prevention-is-better-than-cure-2)\n[better-than-cure-2](https://www.incyber.org/en/prevention-is-better-than-cure-2)\n365 The Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs “provides federal leadership in developing the nation’s capacity to prevent and\ncontrol crime, administer justice, and assist crime victims.” Source: DOJ, “Organization, Mission and Functions Manual: Office of Justice\n_[Programs,” August 27, 2014 (updated September 22, 2022), https://www.justice.gov/doj/office-justice-programs](https://www.justice.gov/doj/office-justice-programs)_\n366 The Board examined a possible recommendation to increase deterrence for adults who may consider using a minor to commit a cyber or\ncyber-enabled crime. However, the Board noted that the United States Sentencing Guidelines already contain an enhancement for instances\nwhere an adult defendant “used or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense or assist in avoiding\ndetection of, or apprehension for, the offense.” United States Sentencing Guidelines, § 3B1.4 (2021), and the application note provides\nfurther that, in an instance where a defendant uses or attempts to use more than one person less than eighteen years of age, an upward\ndeparture from the applicable Guidelines range may be warranted.

Federal responders may have specific\nknowledge about threat actors, allowing them to freeze stolen funds; provide decryption keys; take down\nmalicious infrastructure like exfiltration servers, leaks sites, command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, or\nbotnets; or aid a victim’s incident response team with mitigation or future resilience planning. Timely reporting\nmay also support warnings and the development of mitigation recommendations to protect other potential\nvictims.\n\nThe National Cybersecurity Strategy outlines the federal government’s plan to strengthen the National Cyber Incident\nResponse Plan, specifically, to further implement a policy that “a call to one is a call to all.”[367] As part of that effort, the\nBoard therefore recommends the U.S. government provide clear, consistent guidance, or clarify and further publicize\nexisting guidance, about federal departments’ and agencies’ cyber incident-related roles and responsibilities in a highly\nvisible and unified manner to improve coordination during and post cyber incidents.\n\n  - Provide private and public sector partners with information concerning federal and state responder contact\ninformation, available services for victims, and individual agencies’ unique missions and authorities to best\nassist a targeted entity during a cyberattack.\n\n  - Explain the liability and privilege protections afforded to victims and personnel that share cybersecurity-related\ninformation with federal responders and with each other. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015\n(CISA 2015) provides statutory protections to non-federal entities that share cyber threat indicators and\ndefensive measures in accordance with CISA 2015 with the federal government and with each other.[368]\nHowever, the lack of awareness or confusion around these provisions inhibits respondents and their legal\ncounsel from reporting critical information. As CISA 2015 approaches its sunset and potential renewal in\n2025, Congress should seek out stakeholder feedback to understand why private sector entities continue to\nreport cybercrimes and share cyber threat information at low levels that inhibit collective cybersecurity efforts.\n\n  - Legislate to provide more protection for providers of online services whose platform security personnel identify\nevidence of a crime in online communications while conducting their standard platform protection duties. At\nleast one cybersecurity researcher respondent advised the Board that their employer’s legal counsel was\nconfused by the term “inadvertently” in 18 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) § 2702(b)(7)(A) and whether personnel\nconducting platform protection duties could be deemed to have “inadvertently” found information that appears\nto pertain to the commission of a crime (and thus be able to provide the contents of relevant customer\ncommunications to law enforcement) if those personnel were actively looking to identify and prevent such\nabuse. The researcher noted that such confusion had prevented their ability to share such information with law\nenforcement on countless occasions.\n\n  - Clarify the relationship, or lack thereof, between law enforcement and federal regulators, to address private\nsector misconceptions that law enforcement is a regular conduit of information to regulators.\n\nThe Board endorses Strategic Objective 2.1 of the National Cybersecurity Strategy (Integrate Federal Disruption\nActivities), which seeks to make federal disruption campaigns “so sustained and targeted that criminal activity is\nrendered unprofitable” while “increas[ing] the volume and speed of these integrated disruption campaigns.” [369]\n\n367 Strategic Objective 1.4: Update Federal Incident Response Plans and Processes.

Unless Congress addresses\nthis issue, no amount of increased victim reporting will accomplish the Administration’s strategic goals to dramatically\nreduce the incidence and impact of cybercrime.\n\n##### 3.4.3. Increase International Law Enforcement Cooperation\n\nRespondents consistently noted that timely international cooperation is essential to the long-term disruption of\ncybercrime threats generally. Some respondents specifically noted that such collaboration between U.S. and\ninternational law enforcement partners led to the late 2022 arrest of Lapsus$ members, thereby apparently causing\nthe group’s malicious activities to cease. Central to their opinions regarding the necessity for such international\ncooperation was the dispersed networks of cybercriminals and the transnational nature of online infrastructure,\nservice, and digital asset technologies (and their underlying records), which require global collaboration to locate digital\nevidence, infrastructure, and persons involved in cybercrime activities.\n\nTo improve the timeliness and effectiveness of law enforcement efforts of the type that disrupted the Lapsus$ group in\n2022, the Board endorses the law enforcement-related efforts described in Pillar 5 of the National Cybersecurity\nStrategy (Forge International Partnerships to Pursue Shared Goals) and related recommendations.\n\n  - Enhance law enforcement resources devoted to international law enforcement cooperation, including\noperational collaboration against transnational cyber threats, such as FBI’s Cyber Legal Attaché program and\ndedicated federal prosecutors.\n\n  - Strengthen international collaboration mechanisms to ensure effective information sharing and deconfliction\nto better prevent cybercriminals from evading the rule of law.\n\n##### 3.4.4. Build Resilience for Emergency Disclosure Requests (EDRs) Against Social Engineering Attacks\n\nTitle 18 U.S.C. § 2702 generally prohibits providers from disclosing their users’ records and communications, but\nexceptions in that statute permit providers to divulge a subscriber’s information, including the content of\ncommunications, to a government entity based upon the provider’s good faith belief that “an emergency involving\ndanger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure without delay.” Providers often decide to\ndivulge records after law enforcement informs them of such an emergency through a form called an “Emergency\nDisclosure Request” (EDR). Providers may also decide to divulge records if they learn about an emergency through\nanother source, such as a concerned parent. Providers are responsible for deciding whether an emergency exists and\nmust assess the credibility and authenticity of anyone submitting an EDR.\n\nRecognizing that providers are faced with difficult choices between protecting customer privacy and preventing death or\nserious bodily injury, providers should devote appropriate resources to the task of verifying the authenticity and\ncredibility of EDRs so that providers reduce mistakes in either direction. For example, providers should examine\nwhether they should design and implement new mechanisms for verifying the authenticity of EDRs using solutions such\nas standardized digital signatures. These measures should:\n\n  - address how threat actors have or could abuse existing EDR processes to fraudulently obtain sensitive\ninformation; and\n\n  - assign roles and responsibilities for service providers to verify the legitimacy of EDRs.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 43\n\n\n-----\n\n### APPENDIX A: SUMMARY OF CSRB INTERVIEWS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION\n\nThe Board’s review involved organizations and individuals representing a variety of viewpoints, including targeted\norganizations, law enforcement, cyber threat intelligence, incident response, regulators, cybersecurity and industry\nexperts, cyber incident focused law firms, insurers, and others. The Board requested information in the form of briefings\nand written materials.\n\nThe Board is grateful for the voluntary participation of those parties that provided timely responses.

In these instances, the Board thought necessary to attributed information to a secondary source. These\ninclude articles and industry blogs written by the following persons; their materials are cited in this report where the\ninformation was referenced.\n\n371 The Board recognizes the individual contributions of Kevin Lee, Benjamin Kaiser, Jonathan Mayer, and Arvind Narayanan.\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 45\n\n\n-----\n\n### APPENDIX B: MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA) TYPES AND RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n#### BACKGROUND \n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an\nauthentication system that requires more than one distinct authentication factor for successful authentication. The\nthree authentication factors are something you know, such as a password or personal identification number (PIN);\nsomething you have, like a cryptographic identification device or token; or something you are, like a biometric.[372]\n\nOrganizations may differ slightly in how they categorize the various forms of MFA, but industry, European Union (EU),\nand Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance is consistent with CISA’s and NIST's rankings for the following\nmethods of MFA from most secure to least secure: phishing-resistant MFA; app-based MFA (differentiated further by\nnumber matching and push notification approaches to MFA); and Short Message Service (SMS)/voice MFA.[373, 374, 375]\nFigure 2 and the following sections detail the various vulnerabilities of each form of MFA and common exploitation\nmethodologies.\n\n_Figure 2 - MFA Methods and Common Exploitation_\n\n[372 Information Technology Laboratory; NIST, “MFA,” https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/mfa](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/mfa)\n373 NIST, “NIST Update: Multi-Factor Authentication and SP 800 63 Digital Identity Guidelines,” February 15, 2022,\n[https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2022/multi-factor-authentication-and-sp-800-63-digital/images-](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2022/multi-factor-authentication-and-sp-800-63-digital/images-media/Federal_Cybersecurity_and_Privacy_Forum_15Feb2022_NIST_Update_Multi-Factor_Authentication_and_SP800-63_Digital_Identity_%20Guidelines.pdf)\n[media/Federal_Cybersecurity_and_Privacy_Forum_15Feb2022_NIST_Update_Multi-Factor_Authentication_and_SP800-](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2022/multi-factor-authentication-and-sp-800-63-digital/images-media/Federal_Cybersecurity_and_Privacy_Forum_15Feb2022_NIST_Update_Multi-Factor_Authentication_and_SP800-63_Digital_Identity_%20Guidelines.pdf)\n[63_Digital_Identity_%20Guidelines.pdf](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2022/multi-factor-authentication-and-sp-800-63-digital/images-media/Federal_Cybersecurity_and_Privacy_Forum_15Feb2022_NIST_Update_Multi-Factor_Authentication_and_SP800-63_Digital_Identity_%20Guidelines.pdf)\n374 ENISA and CERT-EU, “Joint Publication 22-01: Boosting your Organisation’s Cyber Resilience,” February 14, 2022,\n[https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/boosting-your-organisations-cyber-resilience/@@download/fullReport](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/boosting-your-organisations-cyber-resilience/@@download/fullReport)\n[375 Shyamsundar, Teju; Okta, “Why You Should Ditch SMS as an Auth Factor,” May 20, 2020, https://www.okta.com/blog/2020/05/why-](https://www.okta.com/blog/2020/05/why-you-should-ditch-sms-as-an-auth-factor)\n[you-should-ditch-sms-as-an-auth-factor](https://www.okta.com/blog/2020/05/why-you-should-ditch-sms-as-an-auth-factor)\n\n_REVIEW OF THE ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAPSUS$ AND RELATED THREAT GROUPS_ 46\n\n\n-----\n\n#### PHISHING-RESISTANT MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA)\n\nPhishing-resistant MFA, including FIDO and public key infrastructure (PKI),[376] which enables digital signatures and\nencryption, is currently the strongest approach to MFA with the United States (U.S.) government’s OMB requiring\nagencies to adopt the method and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity and the Computer Emergency\nResponse Team (CERT)-EU releasing a joint publication identifying it as a best practice.[377, 378] FIDO, the only widely\navailable phishing-resistant authentication, runs on top of the WebAuthn authentication protocol and is supported by\nmajor browsers, operating systems, and smartphones. PKI is less widely available but effectively ties MFA to an\nenterprise PKI infrastructure. An example of PKI-based MFA is the use of smart cards, including Common Access Card\n(CAC) or Personal Identity Verification (PIV), by many government agencies to establish the second identification\nfactor.[379]\n\n#### APP-BASED MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA)\n\nAs depicted in Figure 3, app-based MFA is an authentication method that uses a mobile application to provide the\nsecond authentication method to log in to a user’s account. App-based MFA solutions verify a user’s identity by\ngenerating a one-time passcode (OTP)[380] or by sending a “push” notification, possibly with number matching\nimplemented, to a mobile application for a user to accept. In the OTP or number matching implementation, the user has\nan additional step that requires them to type in the OTP or numbers. While they are resilient to some of the vectors\navailable to SMS/voice-based MFA, OTP or number matching is still vulnerable to phishing while push notifications\nwithout number matching remain vulnerable to MFA fatigue attacks and user error. CISA recommends OTP or number\nmatching MFA over push notification MFA because of the additional step that can mitigate against MFA fatigue and\nidentifies this method as optimal for organizations that cannot immediately implement phishing-resistant MFA.[381, 382]\n\n376 PKI is the set of hardware, software, policies, processes, and procedures required to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke\ndigital certificates and public keys. PKIs are the foundation that enables the use of technologies, such as digital signatures and encryption,\n[across large user populations.

Although NIST, CISA, and Okta advise\nthat this form of MFA should be avoided to the extent possible, they acknowledge that any MFA method is better than\nno MFA.[384, 385, 386]\n\n383 SS7 attacks are mobile cyberattacks that exploit security vulnerabilities in the SS7 protocol to compromise and intercept voice and SMS\ncommunications on a cellular network, effectively enabling the threat actor to steal the authentication message sent to a mobile device.\n_[Source: Adam Weinberg, “A Step by Step Guide to SS7 Attacks,” April 30, 2023, https://www.firstpoint-mg.com/blog/ss7-attack-guide](https://www.firstpoint-mg.com/blog/ss7-attack-guide)_\n384 NIST, “NIST Update: Multi-Factor Authentication and SP 800 63 Digital Identity Guidelines,” February 15, 2022,\n[https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2022/multi-factor-authentication-and-sp-800-63-digital/images-](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2022/multi-factor-authentication-and-sp-800-63-digital/images-media/Federal_Cybersecurity_and_Privacy_Forum_15Feb2022_NIST_Update_Multi-Factor_Authentication_and_SP800-63_Digital_Identity_%20Guidelines.pdf)\n[media/Federal_Cybersecurity_and_Privacy_Forum_15Feb2022_NIST_Update_Multi-Factor_Authentication_and_SP800-](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2022/multi-factor-authentication-and-sp-800-63-digital/images-media/Federal_Cybersecurity_and_Privacy_Forum_15Feb2022_NIST_Update_Multi-Factor_Authentication_and_SP800-63_Digital_Identity_%20Guidelines.pdf)\n[63_Digital_Identity_%20Guidelines.pdf](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2022/multi-factor-authentication-and-sp-800-63-digital/images-media/Federal_Cybersecurity_and_Privacy_Forum_15Feb2022_NIST_Update_Multi-Factor_Authentication_and_SP800-63_Digital_Identity_%20Guidelines.pdf)\n[385 CISA, “Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA,” October 31, 2022, https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf)\n[implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf)\n[386 Shyamsundar, Teju;
