We also found an attack campaign targeting the foreign trade industry\nusing backlinks.\nRecently, the 360 Advanced Threat Institute detected a sample of suspected Transparent\nTribe's attack activity. We speculate that the previous operation went undetected, and the\nsample used the bait documentation to eventually release its exclusive Trojan, CrimsonRAT.\n\n## 1. Analysis of attack activities\n\n 1. Attack process analysis\n\nAttack campaigns using decoy documents that disguise resumes. Through the release of\nCrimsonRAT through Dropper, continuous monitoring of users in the middle of the\nrecruitment.\n\n## 2. Load delivery analysis\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2.1 Disguising Documents\n\nThe sample name we captured is Sonam kaur_2, the\ndocument name is similar to the sample, the file name\nbelow is Sonam Singh's document, which also uses the\nname of the person as the document name, and Sonam\nSingh's document is a personal work resume.\n\nUnlike the same attack we speculate is that the malicious\ndocument we capture only contains macro code inside\nthe open window, and once the user inadvertently clicks\nto start the macro function, the hidden malicious macro\ncode runs automatically.\n\nWe also found an account with the same name on Twitter, and in the profile we can see that\nthe status location is in Mumbai and is a wealth consulting firm. The Tweet update is as of\nJuly 2021, and while this is consistent with our presumed timing of the action, it is not\npossible to tell if this tweet is related to the documentation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe macro code disguises itself as an Mdiaz-related program in the ALLUSERSPROFILE\ndirectory, reads hidden data from the specified structure of the malicious document and\nwrites it to a file, which shows that APT-C-56 (transparent tribe) uses simple string\nconcatenation technology to disassemble exe characters to avoid static killing by antivirus\nengines.\n\n\n-----\n\nLaunch the malicious PE program that is released, while further reading the normal text\ndocument data hidden inside, release it to the worddcs.docx, and finally open this document\nto disguise and confuse the user.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2.2 Dropper\n\nThe released PE file is a .Net Dropper program. First, determine whether a zip file exists,\nread the resource section and write the data to the file if it does not exist, delete it and write it\nagain.\n\n\n-----\n\nDetermine whether there is a file with the suffix .ford in the directory, and if so, create a\nstartup file directly. If no suffix is specified, the file goes directly to the subsequent release\nprocess.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen determine whether there is a backdoor RAT stored in the resource, and if not,\ndownload and run it from the C&C through the network connection.\n\n## 3. Attack component analysis\n\nThe RAT backdoor released after download disguises itself as the FireFox browser and is the\nCrimsonRAT that the Transparent Tribe has been maintaining and using.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe control codes and commands are as follows:\n\n**directives** **Control code**\n\nEnumerate processes gey7tavs\n\n\n-----\n\nUpload a GIF thy7umb\n\nEnumerate processes pry7ocl\n\nSet up auto-start puy7tsrt\n\nDownload the file doy7wf\n\nSet up screenshots scy7rsz\n\nGets the file properties fiy7lsz\n\nSee screenshots cdy7crgn\n\ncsy7crgn\n\ncsy7dcrgn\n\nStop taking screenshots sty7ops\n\nDesktop screenshot scyr7en\n\nGets disk information diy7rs\n\nParameter initialization cny7ls\n\nDelete the file dey7lt\n\nGet file information afy7ile\n\nDelete a user udy7lt\n\nSearch for files liy7stf\n\nGet user information iny7fo\n\n\n-----\n\nExecute the file ruy7nf\n\nMove files fiy7le\n\n## 2. Attribution research and judgment\n\nBased on the similarity of the macro code and CrimsonRAT judging that this is an APT-C-5 6\n(Transparent Tribe) attack activity, the sample found this time has many similarities to our\nprevious APT-C-56 (Transparent Tribe) attack analysis report.\n\n## 1. Analysis related to previous attacks\n\n### 1.1 Macro code is similar\n\nThe following figure shows the analysis from the previous disclosure action:\n\nThe following figure shows the analysis of this attack:\n\n\n-----\n\n### 1.2 Dropper is similar\n\nThe following figure shows the analysis from the previous disclosure action:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following figure shows the analysis of this attack:\n\n## 2. Difference analysis from previous actions\n\nThe last campaign released RATs directly from resources.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe samples found this time were downloaded via a network connection for subsequent\nRATs.\n\n**summary**\n\nThe India-Pakistan conflict has always existed because of border, cultural, ethnic, historical\nand other reasons, and the military and political espionage caused by geopolitical conflicts\nhas always been the main theme of the region. Pakistan's sidecopy group has been imitating\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Sidewinder attack, and the Indian group will also imitate the transparent tribe s attack.\n\nChaotic situations often represent a contest of economic, military, and cybersecurity\ncapabilities between countries, and it is increasingly important to seize intelligence\nopportunities through cyberattacks and maintain national security.\n\n**Appendix IOC**\n\nfdb9fe902ef9e9cb893c688c737e4cc7\nccc33eff063e44fad0fc3e6057b1bcd9\n0f9f34e3e872e57446ffdcfa90a7b954\n35e481dec398f206d0be12bc98ccc17a\n33ea133da15dc060b7709558c97209d2\n860da5abde63a42b3fbd8202d0cff6d2\n8e642dd589e53347555a7b2596512ed7\n23.254.119.234：6178\n\n**360** **Advanced Threat Institute**\n\n360 Advanced Threat Institute is the core capability support department of 360 Digital\nSecurity Group, composed of 360 senior security experts, focusing on the discovery, defense,\ndisposal and research of advanced threats, and has taken the lead in capturing many wellknown 0-day attacks in the world, such as double killing, double star, nightmare formula,\netc., exclusively disclosing the advanced actions of many national APT organizations, winning\nwide recognition inside and outside the industry, and providing strong support for 360 to\nensure national network security.\n\n\n-----",
