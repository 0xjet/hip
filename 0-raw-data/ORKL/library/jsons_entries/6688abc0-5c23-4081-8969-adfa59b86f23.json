The dropper, along with the Python RAT, attempts to gather information on the\nvictim's machine and then uses multiple cloud services: Google Drive, Twitter, ImgBB and\nGoogle Forms. The RAT attempts to download additional payloads and upload the\ninformation gathered during the reconnaissance phase. This particular RAT attempts to\ntarget a very specific set of Arabic-speaking countries. The filtering is performed by checking\nthe keyboard layout of the infected systems. Based on the analysed sample, JhoneRAT\ntargets Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Oman, Yemen, Syria,\nUAE, Kuwait, Bahrain and Lebanon.\n\n**What's new? The campaign shows an actor that developed a homemade RAT that works in**\nmultiple layers hosted on cloud providers. JhoneRAT is developed in Python but not based\non public source code, as it is often the case for this type of malware. The attackers put great\neffort to carefully select the targets located in specific countries based on the victim's\nkeyboard layout.\n\n**How did it work? Everything starts with a malicious document using a well-known**\nvulnerability to download a malicious document hosted on the internet. For this campaign,\nthe attacker chose to use a cloud provider (Google) with a good reputation to avoid URL\nblocklisting. The malware is divided into a couple of layers — each layer downloads a new\npayload on a cloud provider to get the final RAT developed in Python and that uses\nadditional providers such as Twitter and ImgBB.\n\n**So what? This RAT is a good example of how a highly focused attack that tries to blend its**\nnetwork traffic into the crowd can be highly effective. In this campaign, focusing detection of\nthe network is not the best approach. Instead, the detection must be based on the behaviour\non the operating system. Attackers can abuse well-known cloud providers and abuse their\nreputations in order to avoid detection.\n\n## Opsec and targeted countries\n\nThe fact that this attacker decided to leverage cloud services and four different services —\nand not their own infrastructure — is smart from an opsec point of view. It is hard for the\ntargets to identify legitimate and malicious traffic to cloud provider infrastructure. Moreover,\nthis kind of infrastructure uses HTTPS and the flow is encrypted that makes man-in-themiddle interception more complicated for the defender. It is not the first time an attacker used\nonly cloud providers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_User-agent #1_\n\n_User-agent #2_\n\n_User-agent #3_\n\nEven while using these services, the authors of this JhoneRAT went further and used\ndifferent user-agent strings depending on the request, and even on the downloaders the\nauthors used other user-agent strings.\n\n[We already published a couple of articles about ROKRAT (here,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/04/introducing-rokrat.html) [here,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/11/ROKRAT-Reloaded.html) [here and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/01/korea-in-crosshairs.html) [here) where](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/group-123-goes-wild.html)\nanother unrelated actor, Group123, made the same choice but with different providers.\n\nThe attacker implemented filtering based on the keyboard's layout.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Keyboard layout check_\n\nThe malware is executed only for the following layout, the country is based on the Microsoft\nwebsite:\n\n'0401' -> Saudi Arabia\n'0801' -> Iraq\n'0c01' -> Egypt\n'1001' -> Libya\n'1401' -> Algeria\n'1801' -> Morocco\n'1c01' -> Tunisia\n'2001' -> Oman\n'2401' -> Yemen\n'2801' -> Syria\n'3801' -> UAE\n'3401' -> Kuwait\n'3c01' -> Bahrain\n'3001' -> Lebanon\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malicious documents\n\n### Decoy document\n\nWe identified three malicious Microsoft Office documents that download and load an\nadditional Office document with a Macro. The oldest one from November 2019, named\n\"Urgent.docx,\" is shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nInitial decoy document\n\nThe author of the document asks to enable editing in English and in Arabic.\n\nThe second document from the beginning of January is named \"fb.docx\" and contains\nusernames and passwords from an alleged \"Facebook\" leak:\n\n\n-----\n\nSecond decoy document\n\nThe more recent document is from mid-January and alleged to be from a United Arab\nEmirate organization. The author blurred the content and asks the user to enable editing to\nsee the content:\n\nThird decoy document\n\n\n-----\n\n### Macro loading\n\nIn the three documents, an additional Office document containing a Macro is downloaded\nand executed. The documents are located on Google Drive.\n\nMalicious documents on Google Drive\n\n## Infection workflow\n\n### Stage No. 1: Malicious template on Google Drive\n\nThe template located on Google Drive contains a macro. The macro contains a virtual\nmachine detection technique based on the serial number of the disks available in the victim\nenvironment. Indeed, some VMs do not have serial numbers and the macro is executed only\nif a serial number exists. A WMIC command is executed to get this information on the\ntargeted system.\n\n\n-----\n\nMacro WMI check\n\nIf a serial number exists, the rest of the code is executed. The purpose is to download an\nimage from a new Google Drive link:\n\nImage download\n\nIt is interesting to note that the filename of the downloaded image is randomly generated\nbased on a dictionary: Array (\"cartoon,\" \"img,\" \"photo\"). The filename will be cartoon.jpg or\nimg.jpg or photo.jpg and the image usually depicts a cartoon.\n\n### Stage No. 2: Image file on Google Drive\n\nThe image file is a real image with a base64-encoded binary appended at the end.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image No. 1_\n\nThe malware author has a curious sense of humor.\n\n_Image No. 2_\n\nThe base64 data and image are separated by the \"****\" string:\n\n\n-----\n\nImage and payload separation\n\nThe decoded binary filename is also randomly generated based on a dictionary: Array\n(\"proc\", \"chrome\", \"winrar\"). It can be proc.exe or chrome.exe or winrar.exe.\n\n### Stage No. 3: Autoit file\n\nThe decoded base64 data is an AutoIT binary. This binary downloads a new file on Google\nDrive.\n\nAutoIT downloader\n\nThe filename is also randomly generated based on a dictionary $ARRAY[5]=\n\n[\"prc\",\"winrar\",\"chrome\",\"sync\",\"COM surr\"].\n\n### Stage No. 4: Python RAT using cloud providers\n\nThe final payload is a remote access tool (RAT) written in Python. We named this RAT\n\"JhoneRAT.\" The Python code is wrapped into an executable using pyinstaller. It uses\nminimal obfuscation applied only on variables and function naming.\n\n\n-----\n\nRAT startup\n\nThe RAT starts by launching three threads. The first is responsible for checking if the system\nhas the targeted keyboard layout — this is exclusively in Arabic-speaking countries. The\nsecond will create the persistence and, finally, the last one to be started is the main cycle for\nthe RAT. As we explained before, the RAT targets specific countries by checking the\nkeyboard's layout. In fact, this is one of the first checks it performs when it is executed. The\npersistence is achieved by adding an entry with the name \"ChromeUpdater\" to the\n'Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run' .\n\n**Command and control communications**\n\nThis RAT uses three different cloud services to perform all its command and control (C2)\nactivities. It checks for new commands in the tweets from the handle @jhone87438316\n(suspended by Twitter) every 10 seconds using the BeautifulSoup HTML parser to identify\nnew tweets. These commands can be issued to a specific victim based on the UID\ngenerated on each target (by using the disk serial and contextual information such as the\nhostname, the antivirus and the OS) or to all of them:\n\n\n-----\n\nCommand fetching\n\nCommand parsing\n\nThe exfiltration, however, is done via other cloud providers. The screenshots are exfiltrated\nvia the ImgBB website:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe remaining commands send feedback by posting data into Google Forms:\n\nFinally, the RAT is able to download files encoded in base64 on Google Drive:\n\nFeature-wise, the RAT has three commands:\n\nTake a screenshot and upload it to ImgBB.\nDownload binary disguised has a picture from Google Drive and execute it.\nExecute a command and send the output to Google Forms.\n\n## Anti-VM, anti-decompiler and no header\n\nThe attacker put a couple of tricks in place to avoid execution on virtual machines (sandbox)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first trick is the check of the serial number of the disk. The actor used the same\ntechnique in the macro and in the JhoneRAT. By default, most of the virtual machines do not\nhave a serial number on the disk.\n\nThe attacker used a second trick to avoid analysis of the Python code. The actor used the\nsame trick that FireEye in the [Flare-On 6: Challenge 7: They removed the header of the](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/blog/pdfs/FlareOn6_Challenge7_Solution_WOPR.pdf)\nPython bytecode. It can be perfectly executed without the header, but tools such as\nuncompyle6 need this header:\n\n$ uncompyle6 final2\n\nImportError: Unknown magic number 227 in final2\n\nAdditionally, the generated code by uncompyle6 varies depending on the version and the\nimpact is important.\n\nHere is a condition generated with uncompyle6 version 3.3.5:\n\nThe same code generated with uncompyle6 version 3.6.2:\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our analysis and the behaviour of the executed malware, the correct interpretation\nis the first one based on the oldest version of uncompyle6.\n\nFor this specific condition, it is important because it's filtering on the keyboard layout to\nidentify the targets.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis campaign shows a threat actor interested in specific Middle Eastern and Arabicspeaking countries. It also shows us an actor that puts effort in opsec by only using cloud\nproviders. The malicious documents, the droppers and the RAT itself are developed around\ncloud providers. Additionally the attackers implemented anti-VM (and sandbox) and antianalysis tricks to hide the malicious activities to the analyst. For example, the VM or the\nsandbox must have the keyboard layout of the targeted countries and a disk serial number.\nThis campaign started in November 2019 and it is still ongoing. At this time, the API key is\nrevoked and the Twitter account is suspended. However, the attacker can easily create new\naccounts and update the malicious files in order to still work. This campaign shows us that\nnetwork-based detection is important but must be completed by system behaviour analysis.\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Docx:\n\n273aa20c4857d98cfa51ae52a1c21bf871c0f9cd0bf55d5e58caba5d1829846f\n\n29886dbbe81ead9e9999281e62ecf95d07acb24b9b0906b28beb65a84e894091\n\nd5f10a0b5c103100a3e74aa9014032c47aa8973b564b3ab03ae817744e74d079\n\n### Template:\n\n6cc0c11c754e1e82bca8572785c27a364a18b0822c07ad9aa2dc26b3817b8aa4\n\n### Image:\n\n7e1121fca3ac7c2a447b61cda997f3a8202a36bf9bb08cca3402df95debafa69\n\n### PE Autoit:\n\nb4a43b108989d1dde87e58f1fd6f81252ef6ae19d2a5e8cd76440135e0fd6366\n\n### PE Python:\n\n4228a5719a75be2d6658758fc063bd07c1774b44c10b00b958434421616f1548\n\n### URL:\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://drive[.]google[.]com/uc?\nexport=download&amp;id=1vED0wN0arm9yu7C7XrbCdspLjpoPKfrQ\n\nhxxps://drive[.]google[.]com/uc?\nexport=download&amp;id=1LVdv4bjcQegPdKrc5WLb4W7ad6Zt80zl\n\nhxxps://drive[.]google[.]com/uc?\nexport=download&amp;id=1OlQssMvjb7gI175qDx8SqTgRJIEp5Ypd\n\nhxxps://drive[.]google[.]com/uc?export=download&id=1d-toE89QnN5ZhuNZIc2iF4cbKWtk0FD\n\nhxxps://drive[.]google[.]com/uc?\nexport=download&id=1kbHVkvPIjX49qJ62TBz6drW2YPiiaX2a\n\nhxxps://twitter[.]com/jhone87438316\n\n### Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nmalware used by these threat actors.\n\n[Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS) or](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html) [Web Security Appliance (WSA) web scanning prevents](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/web-security-appliance/index.html)\naccess to malicious websites and detects malware used in these attacks.\n\n[Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Network Security appliances such as Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW), Next-Generation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/index.html)\n[Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS), andMeraki MX can detect malicious activity](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/intrusion-prevention-system-ips/index.html)\nassociated with this threat.\n\n[AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html)\nproducts.\n\n[Umbrella, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious](https://umbrella.cisco.com/)\ndomains, IPs, and URLs, whether users are on or off the corporate network.\n\nOpen Source Snort Subscriber Rule Set customers can stay up to date by downloading the\n[latest rule pack available for purchase on Snort.org.](https://www.snort.org/products)\n\n\n-----",
