Most of the identified targets of the campaign are located in NATO member states, the\nEuropean Union and, to a lesser extent, in Africa.\n\nMany elements of the observed campaign – the infrastructure, the techniques used and the tools - overlap, in part\nor in full, with activity described in the past, referred to by Microsoft as “NOBELIUM” and by Mandiant as “APT29”.\nThe actor behind them has been linked to, among other things, a campaign called “SOLARWINDS” and the tools1\n“SUNBURST”, “ENVYSCOUT”2. 3. and “BOOMBOX”, as well as numerous other espionage campaigns .4 5\n\n\nThe activities described here differ from the previous ones in the use of software unique to this campaign and not\npreviously described publicly. New tools were used at the same time and independently of each other, or replacing6\nthose whose effectiveness had declined, allowing the actor to maintain continues, high operational tempo.\n\nAt the time of publication of the report, the campaign is still ongoing and in development. The Military\nCounterintelligence Service and CERT.PL recommend all entities which may be in the area of interest of the actor\nto implement mechanisms aimed at improving the security of IT Security systems in use and increasing the\ndetection of attacks. Examples of configuration changes and detection mechanisms are proposed in the\nrecommendations.\n\nThe aim of publishing the advisory is to disrupt the ongoing espionage campaign, impose additional cost of\noperations against allied nations and enable the detection, analysis and tracking of the activity by affected parties\nand the wider cyber security industry.\n\n## The course of the observed campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nIn all observed cases, the actor utilised spear phishing techniques. Emails impersonating embassies of European\ncountries were sent to selected personnel at diplomatic posts. The correspondence contained an invitation to a\nmeeting or to work together on documents. In the body of the message or in an attached PDF document, a link was\nincluded purportedly directing to the ambassador's calendar, meeting details or a downloadable file.\n\nFigure 1. Example of an email impersonating the Polish embassy and urging the addressee to click on a malicious\nlink.\n\nThe link directed to a compromised website that contained the actor's signature script, publicly referred to as\n“ENVYSCOUT”. It utilises the HTML Smuggling technique – whereby a malicious file placed on the page is\ndecoded using JavaScript when the page is opened and then downloaded on the victim's device. This makes the\nmalicious file more difficult to detect on the server side where it is stored. The web page also displayed an\ninformation intended to reassure the victim that they had downloaded the correct attachment.\n\nIn the course of the described campaign, three different versions of the ENVYSCOUT tool were observed,\nprogressively adding new mechanisms to hinder analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2.\n\nA website impersonating the Polish embassy suggesting a downloadable calendar\n\nCampaigns observed in the past linked to “NOBELIUM” and “APT29” used .ZIP or .ISO files to deliver the malware.\nDuring the campaign described above, .IMG files were also used in addition to the aforementioned file formats. ISO\nand IMG disk images, on Windows computers, are automatically mounted in the file system when opened, which\ncauses their contents to be displayed in Windows Explorer. In addition, they do not carry the so-called mark-of-the_web, i.e. the user will not be warned that the files were downloaded from the Internet._\n\nThe actor used various techniques to get the user to launch the malware. One of them was a Windows shortcut\n(LNK) file pretending to be a document but actually running a hidden DLL library with the actor's tools. The DLL\n_Sideloading technique was also observed, using a signed executable file to load and execute code contained in a_\nhidden DLL library by placing it in the same directory, under a name chosen according to the entries in the import\ntable. At a later stage of the campaign, the name of the executable file contained many spaces to make the exe\nextension difficult to spot.\n\nFigure 3. View after the victim starts-up an image file with the default Windows Explorer settings.\n\n## Tools used during the campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nThe actor used various tools at different stages of the described campaign. All those listed below are unique to the\nset of activities described. A detailed technical analysis of each is included in separate documents:\n\n1. [SNOWYAMBER – a tool first used in October 2022, abusing the Notion service to communicate and7](https://www.gov.pl/attachment/ee91f24d-3e67-436d-aa50-7fa56acf789d)\n\ndownload further malicious files. Two versions of this tool have been observed.\n2. [HALFRIG – used for the first time in February 2023. This tool is distinguished from the others by the](https://www.gov.pl/attachment/64193e8d-05e2-4cbf-bb4c-5f58da21fefb)\n\nembedded code that runs the COBALT STRIKE tool.\n3. [QUARTERRIG – a tool first used in March 2023, sharing part of the code with HALFRIG. Two versions of this](https://www.gov.pl/attachment/6f51bb1a-3ad2-461c-a16d-408915a56f77)\n\ntool were observed.\n\n\nThe first version of the SNOWYAMBER tool was publicly described by Recorded Future, among others . 8 **A**\n**modified version of the SNOWYAMBER tool, the HALFRIG tool and the QUATERRIG tool have not**\n**previously been described publicly.**\n\nFigure 4. Timeline illustrating the observed actions of the actor\n\nThe SNOWYAMBER and QUARTERRIG tools were used as so-called downloaders. Both tools sent the IP address\nas well as the computer and user name to the actor. They were used to assess whether the victim was of interest\nto the actor and whether it was a malware analysis environment. If the infected workstation passed manual\nverification, the aforementioned downloaders were used to deliver and start-up the commercial tools COBALT\nSTRIKE or BRUTE RATEL. HALFRIG, on the other hand, works as a so-called loader – it contains the COBALT\nSTRIKE payload and runs it automatically.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Illustration of the actor's\n\ntool delivery course\n\nDespite the observed changes in tools, many of the elements of the campaign are repeatable. These include:\n\n1. The way the infrastructure is built. The actor behind the espionage campaign prefers to use vulnerable\n\nwebsites belonging to random entities.\n2. Email theme. All acquired emails used in the campaigns used the theme of correspondence between\n\ndiplomatic entities.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. The use of a tool publicly referred to as ENVYSCOUT. This script has been used by the actor since at least\n\n2021 . Modifications to the tool's code were observed during the campaign, but they did not significantly9\naffect its functionality.\n4. A link to the ENVYSCOUT tool was provided to the victim in the form of a link embedded in the body of the\n\nemail or in the body of an attached PDF file.\n5. Use of ISO and IMG disc images.\n6. Use of a technique called “DLL Sideloading” that uses a non-malicious, digitally signed executable file to\n\nstart-up the actor’s tools.\n7. Use of commercial tools COBALT STRIKE and BRUTE RATEL.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThe Military Counterintelligence Service and CERT.PL strongly recommend that all entities that may be in the\nactor's area of interest implement configuration changes to disrupt the delivery mechanism that was used in the\ndescribed campaign. Sectors that should particularly consider implementing the recommendations are:\n\n1. Government entities;\n2. Diplomatic entities, foreign ministries, embassies, diplomatic staff and those working in international entities;\n3. International organisations;\n4. Non-Governmental organisations.\n\nThe following configuration changes can be used to disrupt the malware delivery mechanism used in the described\ncampaign:\n\n1. Blocking the ability to mount disk images on the file system. Most users doing office work have no need to\n\ndownload and use ISO or IMG files.\n2. Monitoring of the mounting of disk image files by users with administrator roles.\n3. Enabling and configuring Attack Surface Reduction Rules10.\n4. Configuring Software Restriction Policy and blocking the possibility of starting-up executable files from\n\nunusual locations (in particular: temporary directories, %localappdata% and subdirectories, external media ).11\n\n\nWe also include a collection of all observed indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to the campaign described,\nand we recommend to verify the system and network logs collected for their occurrence.\n\n## Attachments\n\n1 https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/unc2452-merged-into-apt29\n\n\n2 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/,\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/\n\n3 https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/tracking-apt29-phishing-campaigns\n\n4 Terminology taken from the Microsoft MSTIC team's publicly available analysis:\n\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/.5\n\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/15/2002621240/-1/-1/0/CSA_SVR_TARGETS_US_ALLIES_UOO13234021.PDF,\n\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf,\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/russia-uk-and-us-expose-global-campaigns-of-malign-activity-by-russianintelligence-services,\n\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-covid-19-vaccine-development\n\n6 The term “tools” is used in a broad sense and includes file delivery scripts, “loader”, “stager” and “dropper”\n\nsoftware\n\n7 https://www.notion.so/\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta 2023 0127.pdf\n\n9 https://microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/\n\n10 https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction\n\n11 For example:\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\*.exe\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\*\\*.exe\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\*.exe\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\*\\*.exe\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\*.exe\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\*\\*.exe\n\n\n-----",
