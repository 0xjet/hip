    "plain_text": "# Stealing the LIGHTSHOW (Part Two) — LIGHTSHIFT and LIGHTSHOW\n\n**mandiant.com/resources/blog/lightshift-and-lightshow**\n\nIn part one on [North Korea's UNC2970, we covered UNC2970’s tactics, techniques and](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/lightshow-north-korea-unc2970)\nprocedures (TTPs) and tooling that they used over the course of multiple intrusions. In this\ninstallment, we will focus on how UNC2970 utilized Bring Your Own Vulnerable Device\n(BYOVD) to further enable their operations.\n\nDuring our investigation, Mandiant consultants identified most of the original compromised\nhosts, targeted by UNC2970, contained the files %temp%\\<random>_SB_SMBUS_SDK.dll and\nsuspicious drivers, created around the same time on disk.\n\nAt the time Mandiant initially identified these files, we were unable to determine how they\nwere dropped or the exact use for these files. It wasn't until later in the investigation, during\nanalysis of a forensic image, where the pieces started falling into place. A consultant noticed\n\n\n-----\n\nmultiple keyword references to the file C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\Share.DAT (MD5:\n```\ndef6f91614cb47888f03658b28a1bda6). Upon initial glance at the Forensic Image, this file\n\n```\nwas no longer on disk. However, Mandiant was able to recover the original file, and the initial\nanalysis of the sample found that Share.DAT was a XORed data blob, which was encoded\nwith the XOR key 0x59.\n\nThe decoded payload (MD5: 9176f177bd88686c6beb29d8bb05f20c), referred to by Mandiant\nas [LIGHTSHIFT, is an in-memory only dropper. The LIGHTSHIFT dropper distributes a](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--0d86b906-1974-5d24-a78e-9c771339bc50)\npayload (MD5: ad452d161782290ad5004b2c9497074f) that Mandiant refers to\nas [LIGHTSHOW. Once loaded into memory, LIGHTSHIFT invokes the exports Create then](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--59b3fc08-f453-54e9-8e67-d46f6e3ef57d)\n```\nClose in that order. The response from Close is written as a hex formatted address to the file\nC:\\Windows\\windows.ini.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: LIGHTSHIFT preparing to load LIGHTSHOW\nLIGHTSHOW is a utility that makes use of two primary anti-analysis techniques used to\nhinder both dynamic and static analysis. To deter static analysis, LIGHTSHOW was\nobserved being packed by VM-Protect. In an effort to thwart dynamic analysis, LIGHTSHOW\nis targeted to a specific host and requires a specific SHA256 hash corresponding to a\nspecific computer name or the sample will not fully execute. Once FLARE completed the\nanalysis of LIGHTSHOW, we were able to understand how the files %temp%\\\n```\n<random>_SB_SMBUS_SDK.dll and drivers were created on disk.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nLIGHTSHOW is a utility that was used by UNC2970 to manipulate kernel data-structures and\nrepresents an advancement in DPRK’s capabilities to evade detection. To accomplish this,\n[LIGHTSHOW drops a legitimate version of a driver with known vulnerabilities, with a](https://swapcontext.blogspot.com/2020/08/ene-technology-inc-vulnerable-drivers.html)\nSHA256 hash of\n```\n175eed7a4c6de9c3156c7ae16ae85c554959ec350f1c8aaa6dfe8c7e99de3347to\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers with one of the following names chosen at random and\n\n```\nappended with mgr:\n```\n   circlass\n   dmvsc\n   hidir\n   isapnp\n   umpass\n\n```\nLIGHTSHOW then creates the registry key\n```\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\<service name> where\n<service name> is the same as the chosen filename without appended mgr. It then creates a\n\n```\nregistry key with the value name ImagePath, which points to the path of the driver. The\nsample then loads the driver using NtLoadDriver. LIGHTSHOW drops and loads a dummy\nDLL %temp%\\<random>_SB_SMBUS_SDK.dll to register itself to the driver as a legitimate caller.\n\nUsing the vulnerable driver, LIGHTSHOW can perform arbitrary read and write operations to\nkernel memory. LIGHTSHOW uses this read/write primitive to patch different kernel routines,\nwhich are related to the type of facilities an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)\nsoftware may use, to enable evasion of said EDR software. After the read and write\noperations to kernel memory, the sample unloads and deletes %temp%\\\n```\n<random\\>_SB_SMBUS_SDK.dll.\n\n```\nExamining the chain of execution, we see further obfuscation techniques being employed in\nLIGHTSHOW. UNC2970 has a concerted effort towards obfuscation and employs multiple\nmethods to do this throughout the entire chain of delivery and execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: LIGHTSHOW Obfuscation\nLIGHTSHOW is another example of tooling that looks to capitalize on the technique of\nBYOVD. BYOVD is a technique that utilizes the abuse of legitimate and trusted, but\nvulnerable drivers, to bypass kernel level protections. This technique has been utilized by\n[adversaries ranging from financial actors, such as UNC3944, to espionage actors like](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/hunting-attestation-signed-malware)\nUNC2970, which shows its usefulness during intrusion operations. AHNLab recently\n[released a report on activity tracked as Lazarus Group that focused largely on the use of](https://asec.ahnlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Analysis-Report-on-Lazarus-Groups-Rootkit-Attack-Using-BYOVD_Oct-05-2022-3.pdf)\nBYOVD. While Mandiant did not observe the hashes included in the AHNLab report, the use\nof SB_SMBUS_SDK.dll as well as other similarities, such as the exported functions Create\nand Close, indicate an overlap between the activity detailed in this blog post and those\ndetailed by AHNLab.\n\n\n-----\n\nThroughout several incidents we responded to in 2022 that involved UNC2970, we observed\n[them utilizing a small set of vulnerable drivers. This includes the Dell DBUtil 2.3 and the ENE](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/nl-nl/000186019/dsa-2021-088-dell-client-platform-security-update-for-an-insufficient-access-control-vulnerability-in-the-dell-dbutil-driver?lang=en)\nTechnology device drivers. UNC2970 utilized both of these drivers in an attempt to evade\n[detection. These two drivers, and many more, are found in the Kernel Driver Utility (KDU)](https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU)\ntoolkit. With this in mind, it is likely that we will continue to see UNC2970 abuse vulnerable\ndrivers from other vendors.\n\n[Mandiant has worked to detect and mitigate BYOVD techniques for a number of years and](https://github.com/mandiant/Vulnerability-Disclosures)\nhas worked closely with industry allies to report vulnerabilities when discovered. During\n[research being carried out on UNC2970 we discovered a vulnerable driver that the actor had](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/23-00003754)\naccess to, but did not know was vulnerable - essentially making it a 0day in the wild but not\nbeing actively exploited. This was verified through our Offensive Task Force who\nsubsequently carried out a notification to the affected organization and reported the\n[vulnerability to MITRE, which was assigned CVE-2022-42455.](https://github.com/mandiant/Vulnerability-Disclosures/blob/master/2023/MNDT-2023-0003.md)\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nMandiant continues to observe multiple threat actors utilizing BYOVD during intrusion\noperations. Because this TTP provides adversaries an effective means to bypass and\nmitigate EDR, we assess that it will continue to be utilized and adapted into actor tooling.\nThe continued targeting of security researchers by UNC2970 also provides an interesting\nway that the group can potentially continue to expand their toolset to gain an upper hand with\nBYOVD.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nBecause attestation signing is a legitimate Microsoft program and the resulting drivers are\nsigned with Microsoft certificates, execution-time detection is made much more difficult as\nmost EDR tools and Anti-Viruses will allow binaries signed with Microsoft certificates to load.\n[The recent blog post released by Mandiant on UNC3944 driver operations details multiple](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/hunting-attestation-signed-malware)\ntechniques that can be used by organizations to hunt for the abuse of attestation signing. If\nyou haven't already, don't forget to read [part one on North Korea's UNC2970. Additionally,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/lightshow-north-korea-unc2970)\nMicrosoft recently released a report detailing how organizations can harden their\nenvironment against potentially vulnerable third-party developed drivers.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**MD5** **Signature**\n\ndef6f91614cb47888f03658b28a1bda6 XOR’d LIGHTSHIFT\n\n\n-----\n\n9176f177bd88686c6beb29d8bb05f20c LIGHTSHIFT\n\nad452d161782290ad5004b2c9497074f LIGHTSHOW\n\n7e6e2ed880c7ab115fca68136051f9ce ENE Driver\n\nSB_SMBUS_SDK.dll LIGHTSHOW Dummy DLL\n\nC:\\Windows\\windows.ini LIGHTSHIFT Output\n\n## Signatures\n\n### LIGHTSHIFT\n```\n rule M_Code_LIGHTSHIFT\n {\n   meta:\n     author = \"Mandiant\"\n     description = \"Hunting rule for LIGHTSHIFT\"\n    sha256 =\n \"ce501fd5c96223fb17d3fed0da310ea121ad83c463849059418639d211933aa4\"\n   strings:\n     $p00_0 = {488b7c24??448d40??48037c24??488bcfff15[4]817c24[5]74??\n 488b4b??33d2}\n     $p00_1 = {498d7c01??8b47??85c075??496345??85c07e??8b0f41b9}\n   condition:\n     uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550 and\n     (\n       ($p00_0 in (750..11000) and $p00_1 in (0..8200))\n     )\n }\n\n LIGHTSHOW\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule M_Code_LIGHTSHOW\n{\n  meta:\n    author = \"Mandiant\"\n    description = \"Hunting rule For LIGHTSHOW.\"\n    md5 =\n\"ee5057da3e38b934dae15644c6eb24507fb5a187630c75725075b24a70065452\"\n  strings:\n      $E01 = { 46 75 64 4d 6f 64 75 6c 65 2e 64 6c 6c }\n      $I01 = { 62 63 72 79 70 74 2e 64 6c 6c }\n      $I02 = { 4b 45 52 4e 45 4c 33 32 2e 64 6c 6c }\n      $I03 = { 75 73 65 72 33 32 2e 64 6c 6c 00 }\n    $H1 = { 4D 5A 90 00 }\n    $H2 = { 69 73 20 70 72 6F 67 72 61 6D 20 63 61 6E 6E 6F }\n      $F01 = { 47 65 74 4d 6f 64 75 6c 65 46 69 6c 65 4e 61 6d 65 57 }\n      $F02 = { 47 65 74 4d 6f 64 75 6c 65 48 61 6e 64 6c 65 41 }\n      $F03 = { 47 65 74 46 69 6c 65 54 79 70 65 }\n      $F04 = { 47 65 74 56 65 72 73 69 6f 6e }\n      $F05 = { 51 75 65 72 79 53 65 72 76 69 63 65 53 74 61 74 75 73 }\n      $F06 = { 42 43 72 79 70 74 4f 70 65 6e 41 6c 67 6f 72 69 74 68\n6d 50 72 6f 76 69 64 65 72 }\n      $M01 = { 68 2d 79 6e b1 }\n      $M02 = { 68 ea 71 c2 55 }\n      $M03 = { 66 b8 ad eb }\n      $M04 = { 4c 8d 2c 6d b3 6c 05 39 }\n      $M05 = { 48 8d 2c 95 08 9d ec 9a }\n      $S01 = { 48 8d 0c f5 a3 cd 0a eb}\n      $S02 = { 81 f9 7f 56 e6 0a}\n  condition:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n    ($H1 in (0..2048)) and ($H2 in (0..2048)) and filesize < 100MB and\nfilesize > 5KB and all of ($M0*) and all of ($E*) and all of ($I0*) and 6 of\n($F0*) and all of ($S0*)\n}\n\n```\n\n-----",
