Four of the nine predictions we made were directly](https://securelist.com/analysis/kaspersky-security-bulletin/67864/kaspersky-security-bulletin-2014-predictions-2015/)\nconnected with threats to businesses. Our predictions proved accurate –\nthree of the four business-related threats have already been fulfilled:\n\n            - Cybercriminals embrace APT tactics for targeted attacks – yes.\n\n            - APT groups fragment, diversify attacks – yes.\n\n            - Escalation of ATM and PoS attacks – yes.\n\n            - Attacks against virtual payment systems – no.\n\nLet’s have a look back at the major incidents of 2015 and at the new\ntrends we have observed in information security within the business\nenvironment.\n\n## THE YEAR IN FIGURES\n\n            - In 2015 one or more malware attacks were blocked on 58% of\ncorporate computers. This is a 3 p.p. rise on the previous year.\n\n            - 29% of computers – i.e. almost every third business-owned\ncomputer – were subjected to one or more web-based attacks.\n\n            - Malware exploiting vulnerabilities in office applications were used\n3 times more often than in attacks against home users.\n\n            - File antivirus detection was triggered on 41% of corporate computers\n(objects were detected on computers or on removable media\nconnected to computers: flash drives, memory cards, telephones,\nexternal hard drives, or network disks).\n\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\n## TARGETED ATTACKS ON BUSINESSES: APT AND CYBERCRIMINALS\n\n2015 saw a number of APT attacks launched against businesses. The toolkits\nand methods used were very similar to those we observed when analyzing\nearlier APT attacks, but it was cybercriminals rather than state-sponsored\ngroups who were behind the attacks. The methods used may not be\ncharacteristic of cybercriminals, but the main aim of their attacks remained\nthe same: financial gain.\n\n[The Carbanak campaign became a vivid example of how APT-class targeted](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68732/the-great-bank-robbery-the-carbanak-apt/)\nattacks have shifted focus to financial organizations. The campaign was\none of bona fide bank robberies in the digital age: the cybercriminals\npenetrated a bank’s network looking for a critical system, which they then\nused to siphon off money. After stealing a hefty sum (anywhere between\n$2.5 million and $10 million) from a bank, they moved on to the next victim.\n\nMost of the organizations targeted were located in Eastern Europe.\nHowever, the Carbanak campaign has also targeted victims in the US,\nGermany and China. Up to 100 financial institutions have been affected\nacross the globe, and the total losses could be as a high as $1 billion.\n\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\nIt shouldn’t be forgotten that information can also be of great value, especially\nif it can be used when making deals or trading on the stock exchange, be\nit in commodities, securities or currency markets, including cryptocurrency\nmarkets. One example of a targeted attack that may have been hunting\nfor such information is Wild Neutron (aka Jripbot and Morpho). This cyber[espionage campaign first hit the headlines in 2013 when it affected several](https://threatpost.com/ios-developer-site-core-facebook-apple-watering-hole-attack-022013/77546/)\nreputable companies, including Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft.\nAfter these incidents received widespread publicity the actors behind the\ncyberespionage campaign suspended their activities. However, about a year\nlater Kaspersky Lab observed that Wild Neutron had resumed operations.\n\nOur research has shown that the cyberespionage campaign caused\ninfections on user computers in 11 countries and territories, namely Russia,\nFrance, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Palestine, the United\nArab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Algeria and the US. The victims included law\nfirms, investment companies, bitcoin-related companies, enterprises\nand business groups involved in M&A deals, IT companies, healthcare\ncompanies, real estate companies, as well as individual users.\n\nIt should be noted that Wild Neutron used a code signing certificate stolen\nfrom Acer.\n\nStolen Acer certificate in the Wild Neutron installer\n\nThe trend towards the diversification of APT attacks is well illustrated by\n[the change in targets attacked by the Chinese cybercriminal group Winnti.](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/70991/games-are-over/)\nIt was a long-held belief that Winnti only attacked computer gaming\ncompanies. However, in autumn 2015 evidence began to emerge that\nshowed the group had performed a test run of their tools and methods\nand were trying to make money by attacking new targets. Their attention\nis no longer limited to the entertainment industry, with recent targets\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\nincluding pharmaceutical and telecom companies. Analysis of the new\nwave of Winnti attacks has revealed that (as with Wild Neutron) the Winnti\nrootkit was signed with a stolen certificate that belonged to a division at\na major Japanese conglomerate.\n\nAnother development in 2015 was the expanding geographies of both\nthe attacks and the attackers. For example, when Kaspersky Lab experts\nwere investigating a Middle East incident, they came across activity by\na previously unknown group conducting targeted attacks. The group,\n[dubbed the Desert Falcons, is the first Arab actor to conduct full-blown](http://securelist.com/featured/68817/the-desert-falcons-targeted-attacks/)\ncyberespionage attacks. At the time the group was detected, its victims\nnumbered around 300, including financial organizations.\n\n[Another group named Blue Termite attacked organizations and companies](https://securelist.com/blog/research/71876/new-activity-of-the-blue-termite-apt/)\nin Japan:\n\nInformation about targeted attacks on businesses is available in the following\nKaspersky Lab reports: [Carbanak,](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68732/the-great-bank-robbery-the-carbanak-apt/) [Wild Neutron,](https://securelist.com/blog/research/71275/wild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks/) [Winnti,](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/70991/games-are-over/) [DarkHotel 2015,](https://securelist.com/blog/research/71713/darkhotels-attacks-in-2015/)\n[Desert Falcons,](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68817/the-desert-falcons-targeted-attacks/) [Blue Termit,](https://securelist.com/blog/research/71876/new-activity-of-the-blue-termite-apt/) [Grabit. More detailed research results are](https://securelist.com/blog/research/70087/grabit-and-the-rats/)\n[provided to subscribers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Service.](http://www.kaspersky.com/business-security/entrp/apt)\n\nAnalysis of these attacks has identified several trends in the evolution of\ntargeted attacks on businesses:\n\n         - Financial organizations such as banks, funds and exchange-related\ncompanies, including cryptocurrency exchanges, have been\nsubjected to attacks by cybercriminals.\n\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n- The attacks are meticulously planned. The cybercriminals scrutinize\nthe interests of potential victims (employees at the targeted company),\nand identify the websites they are most likely to visit; they examine\nthe targeted company’s contacts, equipment and service providers.\n\n- The information collected at the preparation stage is then put to use.\nThe attackers hack legitimate websites that have been identified and\nthe business contact accounts of the targeted company’s employees.\nThe sites and accounts are used for several hours to distribute\nmalicious code, after which the infection is deactivated. This means\nthe cybercriminals can re-use the compromised resources again later.\n\n- Signed files and legitimate software is used to collect information\nfrom the attacked network.\n\n- Attacks are diversifying to include small and medium-sized businesses.\n\n- The geography of attacks on businesses is expanding: a massive attack\noccurred in Japan, the emergence of new APT groups in Arab countries.\n\nAlthough there are relatively few APT attacks launched by cybercriminals,\nthe way they are developing will undoubtedly influence the methods and\napproaches employed by other cybercriminals in their operations against\nbusinesses.\n\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\n## STATISTICS\n\nThe statistics for corporate users (including the geography of attacks and\nratings for detected objects) tend to coincide with those for home users.\nThis is unsurprising because business users do not exist in an isolated\nenvironment and their computers are targeted by cybercriminals who\nspread malware irrespective of the nature of the target. These types of\nattacks and malware constitute the majority, while attacks specifically\ntargeting business users have little impact on the overall statistics.\n\nIn 2015, one or more malware attack was blocked on 58% of corporate\nuser computers, which is a 3 p.p. rise on last year.\n\n### Online threats (Web-based attacks)\n\nIn 2015, almost every third (29%) computer in a business environment\nwas subjected to one or more web-based attacks.\n\n#### TOP 10 web-based malicious programs\n\nPlease note that this ranking includes malicious programs only, and\nno adware.

Cloud technologies work when antivirus\ndatabases do not yet contain signatures or heuristics to detect a malicious\nprogram but the company’s cloud antivirus database already includes\ninformation about the object. When a client company cannot send statistics\nto the cloud, Kaspersky Private Security Network is used instead, meaning\nthat network computers receive protection from the cloud.\n\nMost of the remaining positions in the ranking are occupied by selfpropagating malware programs and their components.\n\n#### Geography of local threats\n\nGeography of local threat detections in 2015\n(percentage of attacked corporate users in each country)\n\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n## CHARACTERISTICS OF ATTACKS ON BUSINESSES\n\nThe overall statistics for corporate users do not reflect the specific\nattributes of attacks launched against businesses; the stats are influenced\nmore by the probability of a computer infection in a country, or by how\npopular a specific malware program is with cybercriminals.\n\nHowever, a more detailed analysis reveals the peculiarities of attacks on\ncorporate users:\n\n            - exploits for vulnerabilities found in office applications are used three\ntimes more often than in attacks on home users;\n\n            - use of malicious files signed with valid digital certificates;\n\n            - use of legitimate programs in attacks, allowing the attackers to go\nundetected for longer.\n\nWe have also observed a rapid growth in the number of corporate user\ncomputers attacked by encryptor programs.\n\nIn this particular context, the majority of cases are not APT attacks:\n“standard” cybercriminals are simply focusing on corporate users, and\nsometimes on a particular company that is of interest to them.\n\n### Use of exploits in attacks on businesses\n\nThe ranking of vulnerable applications is compiled based on information\nabout exploits blocked by Kaspersky Lab products and used by\ncybercriminals, both in web- and email-based attacks, as well as attempts\nto compromise local applications, including those on mobile devices.\n\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\nDistribution of exploits used in cybercriminal attacks by type of attacked application\n(corporate users, 2015)\n\nDistribution of exploits used in cybercriminal attacks by type of attacked application\n(home users, 2015)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\nIf we compare the use of exploits by cybercriminals to attack home and\ncorporate users, the first obvious difference is that exploits for office\nsoftware vulnerabilities are used much more often in attacks launched\nagainst businesses. They are only used in 4% of attacks on home users,\nbut when it comes to attacks on corporate users, they make up 12% of all\nexploits detected throughout the year.\n\nWeb browsers are the applications targeted most often by exploits in\nattacks on both home and corporate users. When viewing these statistics,\nit should be noted that Kaspersky Lab technologies detect exploits at\nvarious stages. Detection of landing pages from which exploits are\ndistributed are also counted in the ‘Browsers’ category. We have observed\nthat most often these are exploits for vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player.\n\nDistribution of exploits used in cybercriminal attacks by type of attacked application in\n2014 and 2015\n\nThe proportions of Java and PDF exploits have declined significantly\ncompared to 2014, by 14 p.p. and 8 p.p., respectively. Java exploits have\nlost some of their popularity in spite of the fact that several zero-day\nvulnerabilities that been found during the year. The proportion of attacks\nlaunched using vulnerabilities in office software (+8 p.p.), browsers (+9 p.p.),\nAdobe Flash Player (+9 p.p), and Android software (+3 p.p.) have risen.\n\nInvestigations of security incidents have shown that even in targeted attacks\non corporations, cybercriminals often use exploits for known vulnerabilities.\nThis is because corporate environments are slow to install appropriate\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\nsecurity patches. The proportion of exploits that target vulnerabilities in\nAndroid applications has risen to 7%, which suggests cybercriminals have\na growing interest in corporate data stored on employees’ mobile devices.\n\n### Ransomware\n\nEncryption Trojans were long considered to be a threat to home users only.\nNowadays, however, we see ransomware actors paying more attention to\norganizations as targets.\n\nIn 2015, Kaspersky Lab solutions detected ransomware on more than\n50,000 computers in corporate networks, which is double the figure for\n2014. It is important to keep in mind that the real number of incidents\nis several times higher: the statistics reflect only the results of signaturebased and heuristic detections, while in most cases Kaspersky Lab products\ndetect encryption Trojans based on behavior recognition models.\n\nThe number of unique corporate users attacked by encryption Trojans in 2014 and\n2015\n\nThere are two reasons for the surge in interest in businesses by ransomware\nactors. Firstly, they can receive much bigger ransoms from organizations\nthan from individual users. Secondly, there is a better chance the ransom\nwill be paid: some companies simply cannot continue their operations if\ninformation has been encrypted and is unavailable on critical computers\nand/or servers.\n\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\nOne of the most interesting developments of 2015 in this realm has been the\nemergence of the first Linux encryption malware (Kaspersky Lab products\ndetect it as the verdict ‘Trojan-Ransom.Linux.Cryptor’), which targets websites,\nincluding online stores. The cybercriminals exploited vulnerabilities in web\napplications to gain access to websites, and then uploaded a malicious\nprogram to the sites that encrypted the server data. In the majority of cases,\nthis brought the site down. The cybercriminals demanded a ransom of one\nbitcoin to restore the site. Around 2,000 websites are estimated to have been\ninfected. Given the popularity of *nix servers in the business environment,\nit is reasonable to assume that next year there may be more ransomware\nattacks against non-Windows platforms.\n\n#### TOP 10 encryptor Trojan families\n\nFamily % attacked users*\n\n1 Scatter 21\n\n2 Onion 16\n\n3 Cryakl 15\n\n4 Snocry 11\n\n5 Cryptodef 8\n\n6 Rakhni 7\n\n7 Crypmod 6\n\n8 Shade 5\n\n9 Mor 3\n\n10 Crypren 2\n\n*The proportion of users attacked by malicious programs from this family, as a percentage of all attacked\nusers.\n\nVirtually all the ransomware families in the Top 10 demand ransoms in\nbitcoins.\n\nThe Scatter family of Trojans occupies first place. They encrypt files on\nthe hard drive and leave encrypted files with the extension .vault. Scatter\nTrojans are multi-module, multi-purpose script-based malicious programs.\nThis malware family has quickly evolved over a short period, developing\nnew Email-Worm and Trojan-PSW capabilities on top of file encryption.\n\nIn second place is the Onion family of encryptors, known for the fact\nthat their C&C servers are located within the Tor network. In third place is\nthe Cryakl family of encryptors, which are written in Delphi and emerged\nback in April 2014.\n\nIn some cases, it may be possible to restore the data encrypted by these\nransomware programs, usually when there are mistakes of some kind in\ntheir algorithms. However, it is currently impossible to decrypt data that\nhas been encrypted by the latest versions of the malicious programs in\nthe Top 10.\n\n|Col1|Family|% attacked users*|\n|---|---|---|\n|1|Scatter|21|\n|2|Onion|16|\n|3|Cryakl|15|\n|4|Snocry|11|\n|5|Cryptodef|8|\n|6|Rakhni|7|\n|7|Crypmod|6|\n|8|Shade|5|\n|9|Mor|3|\n|10|Crypren|2|\n\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\nIt is important for companies to understand that an infection by malware\nof this kind can interfere with business operations if critical business data\nis lost or a critical server operation is blocked due to encryption. Attacks\nlike this can lead to huge losses, comparable to those caused by the\nWiper malware attacks that destroyed data in corporate networks.\n\nTo address this threat, a number of measures should be taken:\n\n         - deploy protection against exploits;\n\n         - ensure behavioral detection methods are enabled in your security\nproduct (in Kaspersky Lab products, this is done in the System Watcher\ncomponent);\n\n         - configure a data backup procedure.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n## ATTACKS ON POS TERMINALS\n\nThe security of point-of-sale (PoS) terminals has turned into another\npressing issue for businesses, especially those involved in trading activities.\nAny computer with a special card reader device connected to it and the\nright software installed can be used as a PoS terminal. Cybercriminals\nhunt for these computers and infect them with malicious programs that\nallow them to steal the details of bank cards used to pay at the terminals.\n\nKaspersky Lab’s security products have blocked over 11,500 such attacks\nacross the world. To date, there are 10 malware families in our collection\nthat are designed to steal data from PoS terminals. Seven of these emerged\nthis year. Despite the small number of attacks that are attempted, this risk\nshould not be underestimated, because just one successful attack could\ncompromise the details of tens of thousands of credit cards. Such a large\nnumber of potential victims is possible because business owners and\nsystem administrators do not see PoS terminals as devices that require\nprotection. As a result, an infected terminal could go unnoticed for a long\ntime, during which the malicious program sends the details of all the\ncredit cards passing through the terminal to cybercriminals.\n\nThis problem is especially relevant in those countries where cards with\nEMV chips are not used. The adoption of EMV chip cards should make\nit far more difficult to obtain the data required to clone banking cards,\nalthough the adoption process could take a long time. In the meantime,\nthere are some minimum measures that should be taken to protect PoS\ndevices. Fortunately, for these devices it is fairly easy to configure the\n‘default deny’ security policy, which blocks unknown programs from\nlaunching by default.\n\nWe expect that in the future cybercriminals will start targeting mobile PoS\ndevices running under Android.\n\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe data collected from Kaspersky Lab products shows that the tools\nused to attack businesses differ from those used against home users. In\nattacks on corporate users, exploits for office application vulnerabilities\nare used much more often, malicious files are often signed with valid\ndigital certificates, and cybercriminals try to use legitimate software\nfor their purposes, so they can go unnoticed for longer. We have also\nobserved strong growth in the numbers of corporate user computers\ntargeted by ransomware. This also applies to incidents not classified as\nAPT attacks, where cybercriminals merely focus on corporate users, and\nsometimes on employees of specific companies.\n\nThe fact that cybercriminal groups use APT methods and programs to\nattack businesses takes them to a different level and makes them much\nmore dangerous. Cybercriminals have begun to use these methods\nprimarily to steal large sums of money from banks. They can use the\nsame methods to steal a company’s money from bank accounts by\ngaining access to its corporate network.\n\nCybercriminals rely on exploiting known vulnerabilities to conduct their\nattacks – this is due to the fact that many organizations are slow to\nimplement software updates on their corporate computers. In addition,\ncybercriminals make use of signed malicious files and legitimate tools to\ncreate channels for extracting information: these tools include popular\nremote administration software, SSH clients, password restoration\nsoftware, etc.\n\nMore and more frequently, corporate servers are being targeted by\ncybercriminals. Besides stealing data, there have been cases when\nthe attacked servers were used to launch DDoS attacks, or the data on\n[the servers was encrypted for ransom. Recent developments have shown](http://www.zdnet.com/article/crypto-ransomware-strikes-linux-but-attackers-botch-private-key/)\nthat this is true for both Windows and Linux servers.\n\nMany of the organizations that suffered attacks have received ransom\ndemands asking for payments in return for halting an ongoing DDoS\nattack, unblocking encrypted data, or for not disclosing stolen information.\nWhen an organization faces such demands, the first thing they should do\nis contact law enforcement agencies and computer security specialists.\nEven if a ransom is paid, the cybercriminals may still not fulfil their promise,\n[as was the case with the ProtonMail DDoS attack that continued after a](https://threatpost.com/protonmail-back-online-following-six-day-ddos-attack/115303/)\nransom was paid.\n\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n\n-----\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n## PREDICTIONS\n\nGrowing numbers of attacks against financial organizations, financial\nfraud on exchange markets\n\nIn the coming year, we expect to see growing numbers of attacks\nlaunched against financial organizations, as well as a difference in the\nquality of these attacks. Besides transferring money to their own accounts\nand converting it to cash, we may also see cybercriminals employing\nsome new techniques. These could include data manipulation on trading\nplatforms where both traditional and new financial instruments, such as\ncryptocurrencies, are traded.\n\nAttacks on infrastructure\n\nEven if an organization is difficult to penetrate, it is now typical for\norganizations to store their valuable data on servers located in data centers\nrather than on the infrastructure located on their own premises. Attempts\nto gain unauthorized access to these outsourced components of a\ncompany’s infrastructure will become an important attack vector in 2016.\n\nExploiting IoT vulnerabilities to penetrate corporate networks\n\nIoT (Internet of Things) devices can be found in almost every corporate\nnetwork. Research conducted in 2015 has shown that there are a number\nof security problems with these devices and cybercriminals are likely to\nexploit them because they offer a convenient foothold at the initial stage\nof penetrating a corporate network.\n\nMore rigid security standards, cooperation with law enforcement\nagencies\n\nIn response to the growing number of computer incidents in business\nenvironments and the changes to the overall cyber-threat landscape,\nregulatory authorities will develop new security standards and update\nthose already in effect. Organizations that are interested in the integrity\nand security of their digital values will cooperate more actively with\nlaw enforcement agencies, or find themselves obliged to do so by the\nstandards mentioned above. This may lead to more concerted efforts to\ncatch cybercriminals, so expect to hear about new arrests in 2016.\n\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\n## WHAT TO DO?\n\nIn 2015, we have seen cybercriminals begin to actively use APT attack\nmethods to penetrate company networks. We are talking here about\nreconnaissance that aims to identify weak spots in a corporate infrastructure\nand gathering information about employees. There is also the use of spear\nphishing and waterhole attacks, the active use of exploits to execute code\nand gain administrator rights, the use of legitimate software along with\nTrojans for remote administration, research of the targeted network and\nabuse of password restoration software. All this requires the development\nof methods and techniques to protect corporate networks.\n\n[As for specific recommendations, the TOP 35 cyber-intrusion mitigation](https://securelist.com/blog/software/69887/how-to-mitigate-85-of-threats-with-only-four-strategies/)\n[strategies developed by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) should be](https://securelist.com/blog/software/69887/how-to-mitigate-85-of-threats-with-only-four-strategies/)\nconsulted first of all. Through comprehensive, detailed analysis of local\nattacks and threats, ASD has found that at least 85% of targeted cyber\nintrusions could be mitigated by four basic strategies. Three of them are\nrelated to specialized security solutions. Kaspersky Lab products include\ntechnological solutions to cover the first three major strategies.\n\nBelow is a list of the four basic strategies that reduce the possibility of a\nsuccessful targeted attack:\n\n            - Use application whitelisting to help prevent malicious software and\nunapproved programs from running\n\n            - Patch applications such as Java, PDF viewers, Flash, web browsers\nand Microsoft Office\n\n            - Patch operating system vulnerabilities\n\n            - Restrict administrative privileges to operating systems and applications,\nbased on user duties.\n\nFor detailed information about the ASD mitigation strategies, consult the\n[threat mitigation article in the Securelist encyclopedia.](https://securelist.com/threats/strategies-for-mitigating-advanced-persistent-threats-apts/)\n\nAnother important factor is the use of the latest threat data, i.e. threat\n[intelligence services (Kaspersky Lab, for example, provides its own Kaspersky](http://www.kaspersky.com/business-security/entrp/apt)\n[Intelligence Service). A timely configuration and checkup of the corporate](http://www.kaspersky.com/business-security/entrp/apt)\nnetwork using this data will help protect against attacks or detect an attack\nat an early stage.\n\n\n## WHAT TO DO?\n\n\n-----\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\nThe basic principles of ensuring security in corporate networks remain\nunchanged:\n\n- Train staff. Maintaining information security is not only the job of\nthe corporate security service but also the responsibility of every\nemployee.\n\n- Organize security procedures. The corporate security system must\nprovide an adequate response to evolving threats.\n\n- Use new technologies and methods. Each added layer of protection\nhelps reduce the risk of intrusion.\n\n\n#### EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\n[Securelist, the resource](https://securelist.com/)\nfor Kaspersky Lab experts’\ntechnical research,\n\nThreatPostSecureList analysis, and thoughts.\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n#### KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015\n\n\nKaspersky Lab global Website DailyThreatPostBusinessAcademyEugene Eugene Kaspersky Blog\n\nDaily Kaspersky Lab B2C Blog DailyBusiness Kaspersky Lab B2B Blog\n\nDailyThreatPostBusinessAcademy Kaspersky Lab security news service DailyBusinessAcademy Kaspersky Lab Academy\n\n\nDailyThreatPostBusinessAcademyEugeneSecureList\n\n\nDailyBusiness\n\n\nDaily\n\n\n-----",
