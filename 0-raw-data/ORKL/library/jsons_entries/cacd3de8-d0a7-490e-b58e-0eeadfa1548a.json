Metadata analysis of\nthe Windows variants of the backdoor shows that they were compiled as far back as 2021,\nalthough no samples have been detected in the wild.\n\nBOLDMOVE is designed to carry out a system survey and is capable of receiving commands\nfrom a command-and-control (C2) server that in turn allows attackers to perform file\noperations, spawn a remote shell, and relay traffic via the infected host.\n\nAn extended Linux sample of the malware comes with extra features to disable and\nmanipulate logging features in an attempt to avoid detection, corroborating Fortinet's report.\n\n\"The exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in networking devices, followed by the installation\nof custom implants, is consistent with previous Chinese exploitation of networking devices,\"\nMandiant noted.\n\n[Found this article interesting?
