In fact, the main goal was to mine cryptocurrency. During the\ninvestigation we found several tools such as password dumpers, Monero cryptocurrency\nminers, portable executable (PE) injectors and a modified version of Gh0st RAT. Even\nthough Bitdefender and TrendMicro have published reports [1] [2] describing some of the\ntools used by the group, we were not able to find any references to this specific modified\nversion of Gh0st RAT. Therefore, the purpose of this blog is to briefly describe the modified\nGh0st RAT version that is used by the group.\n\n## The malicious payload\n\nFirstly, a malicious executable file is executed which will drop a batch file (install.bat) and a\ncabinet file (data.cab) under a new folder in C:\\ProgramData with a random name. The\ncabinet file includes two files: the malicious shellcode which is partially encrypted and a\nDynamic-link library (DLL) which will execute the malicious shellcode. The malicious\nexecutable file will then execute the batch file, which will decompress and execute the DLL\nfile. Persistence is achieved by creating a new service or a new registry key, depending on\nthe privileges that the malware has.\n\nOnce the execution is passed to the shellcode, it will decrypt the rest of the encrypted data\nusing a single byte as the key in an eXclusive OR (XOR) loop. After decryption, the\nfollowing interesting string is observed:\n\nMicrosoft.Windows.BNG|[C&C IP address]:443;|1;1;1;1;1;1;1;|00-24;|1\n\nThe main goal of the shellcode is to load and execute the attacker’s plugins in memory.\n\n## Modified Gh0st RAT\n\nWhile analysing the previous files, we found a folder named ‘Plugins’ with some interesting\nDLLs inside and two files which required a password upon execution (example in Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter reversing the binary, we\nfound out that the password is not\nhardcoded. Instead, the password\nis based on the current year and\nmonth. For example, the password\nfor the month of March in 2018 is\n‘201803’.\n\nThe first file which is named ‘Noodles’ seems to be an old modified version of Gh0st RAT\nbased on compilation date and features. The second file named ‘Mozilla’ is the primary tool\nwhich was used for this attack. Below you can see how both panels look.\n\nFigure 2: Noodles Panel - Listener Settings\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Mozilla Panel – Connect Settings\n\nCurrently, both tools can listen on any given ports but only ‘Mozilla’ can connect to a bind\nport. The supported protocols include Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transmission\nControl Protocol (TCP). One of the protocols in the list is named, according to the malware\nauthors, ‘WINNET’ but this is not supported yet and an error message is displayed. This\nmight suggest that this tool is still in development and there are plans to add additional\nfunctionality.\n\nFigure 4: WININET protocol not supported\n\nAdditionally, analysis of the Mozilla tool\nidentified a Program database (PDB) path\ninside the binary:\n\nK:\\Mozilla\\Mozillav6.0.x_dll\\WorkActive\\Release\\Mozilla.pdb\n\nThe tool heavily relies on plugins. When there is a new victim connection, the attacker can\nuse the PluginManager to load new plugins to the infected machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: “Mozilla” Plugin Manager\n\nMost of the available plugins are based on the Gh0st RAT source code and a summary of\nthem can be found below:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Network communication\n\nThe network traffic between the victim and the attacker is encrypted using Rivest Cipher 4\n(RC4). The key is unique for each request and is encrypted using ‘XOR’ and ‘AND’\ninstructions. The key is stored in the first 28 bytes of the request. We wrote a Python script\nthat takes as input a network capture (PCAP) and decrypts it, which can be found in our\nGithub repository here: https://github.com/nccgroup/CyberDefence/tree/master/Scripts/gh0st_variant_c2\n\nFor example, below we can see the initial connection between a victim and the C2 server,\nwhere the machine name is sent:\n\nData to server..\n\n\n-----\n\n00000000: 0501570049004E00 2D00510047004F00 ..W.I.N. .Q.G.O.\n00000010: 3400430051004E00 49004F004E003500 4.C.Q.N.I.O.N.5.\n\nAnd below the distinctive start of a PE file is seen, as a plugin is transferred to the client.\n\nData to client..\n\n[i] Found key: C841006804EC089c84EA9020\n00000000: 4D5A900003000000 04000000FFFF0000 MZ..............\n00000010: B800000000000000 4000000000000000 ........@.......\n00000020: 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 ................\n\n00000030: 0000000000000000 00000000F0000000 ................\n00000040: 0E1FBA0E00B409CD 21B8014CCD215468 ........!..L.!Th\n\n00000050: 69732070726F6772 616D2063616E6E6F is program canno\n00000060: 742062652072756E 20696E20444F5320 t be run in DOS\n\n00000070: 6D6F64652E0D0D0A 2400000000000000 mode....$.......\n\n## IOCs\n\nCommand and Control (C&C) IPs:\n\n23.227.207.137\n89.249.65.194\n\nMalicious files directory:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\HIDMgr\nC:\\ProgramData\\Rascon\nC:\\ProgramData\\TrkSvr\n\nMalicious service name:\n\nHIDMgr\nRasconMan\nTrkSvr\n\nRegistry key for persistence:\n\n‘rundll32.exe_malicious_DLL_path’ in\n‘HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run’\n\nFile names and hashes:\n\n**Filename** **Hash(SHA-256)**\n\nMozilla.exe EE04B324F7E25B59D3412232A79D1878632D6817C3BB49500B214BF19AFA4E2C\n\nUpdateproxy.dll 0BA49FEB7784E6D33D821B36C5C669D09E58B6795ACA3EEBBF104B763B3B3C20\n\nTelnet.dll 33B7407E534B46BF8EC06D9F45ECD2D3C7D954340669E94CD7CEDCBAE5BAD2DD\n\nSocks.dll 6160AF383794212B6AD8AB9D6D104BBE7AEFB22410F3AB8EA238F98DABFC48B7\n\nShell.dll C63B01C40038CA076072A35913F56D82E32FCEE3567650F3392B5C5DA0004548\n\n\n-----\n\nSession.dll D51EC4ACEAFA971E7ABD0CF4D27539A4212A448268EF1DB285CD9CE9024D6EB3\n\nScreen.dll BD8086DE44E16EFDD380E23E49C4058D956538B01E1AE999B679B6B76B643C7D\n\nPort.dll B44A9545B697B4D46D5B96862A6F19EA72F89FED279F56309B2F245AC8380BE0\n\nFile.dll F4DF97108F18654089CFB863F2A45AA41D17A3CE8A44CCCC474F281A20123436\n\nConEmu.exe D31D38403E039F5938AE8A5297F35EB5343BB9362D08499B1E07FAD3936CE6F7\n\nNoodles.exe A591D4D5B8D23FF12E44A301CE5D4D9BF966EBA0FC0068085B4B4EC3CE352963\n\n\nCoal.exe\n(Malicious\nexecutable)\n\nAbg.exe\n(Malicious\nexecutable)\n\n23d.exe\n(Malicious\nexecutable)\n\n89d.exe\n(Malicious\nexecutable)\n\n\nEEBFF21DEF49AF4E85C26523AF2AD659125A07A09DB50AC06BD3746483C89F9D\n\n97B9D7E16CD6B78A090E9FA7863BD9A57EA5BBE6AE443FA788603EEE5DA0BFC3\n\nB6C21C26AEF75AD709F6C9CFA84BFA15B7EE709588382CE4BC3544A04BCEB661\n\nDB9B9FA9EFA53662EC27F4B74B79E745F54B6C30C547A4E5BD2754E9F635F6DB\n\n\n## References\n\n1.
