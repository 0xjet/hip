A deeper look into\nour global telemetry revealed that this piece of malware was strictly affecting a limited pool\nof hosts belonging to a number of IP addresses marked as sensitive targets.\n\nIts unusual build could have easily made it pass for a regular threat like many of those that\norganizations block on a daily basis; however, telemetry information provided by our event\ncorrelation service has pointed out that most of its victims are government agencies. Paired\nwith advanced spear phishing techniques and the malware’s primary focus to collect\nintelligence and exfiltrate it systematically, we presume that this attack is part of a high-level\ncyber-espionage campaign.\n\nThe piece of malware we look at in this report comes with quite an array of methods to steal\ninformation, ranging from keylogging to password and cookie theft. It is built around a\nlegitimate, yet controversial recovery toolkit provided by Nirsoft. The controversy stems\nfrom the fact that the applications provided by Nirsoft are used to recover cached\npasswords or monitor network traffic via powerful command-line interfaces that can be\ninstructed to run completely covertly. For a long time now, the antimalware industry has\nflagged the tools provided by Nirsoft as potential threats to security specifically because\nthey are extremely easy to abuse, and oversimplify the creation of powerful malware.\n\nEven though the Netrepser malware uses free tools and utilities to carry various jobs to\ncompletion, the technical complexity of the attack, as well as the targets attacked, suggest\nthat Netrepser is more than a commercial-grade tool\n\n\n-----\n\nSounds interesting?
