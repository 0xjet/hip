    "plain_text": "# A Closer Look at the LAPSUS$ Data Extortion Group\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/)**\n\n**Microsoft and identity management platform Okta both this week disclosed breaches**\ninvolving LAPSUS$, a relatively new cybercrime group that specializes in stealing data from\nbig companies and threatening to publish it unless a ransom demand is paid. Here’s a closer\nlook at LAPSUS$, and some of the low-tech but high-impact methods the group uses to gain\naccess to targeted organizations.\n\nFirst surfacing in December 2021 with an extortion demand on Brazil’s Ministry of Health,\nLAPSUS$ made headlines more recently for posting screenshots of internal tools tied to a\nnumber of major corporations, including NVIDIA, Samsung, and Vodafone.\n\nOn Tuesday, LAPSUS$ announced via its Telegram channel it was releasing source code\nstolen from Microsoft. In [a blog post published Mar. 22, Microsoft said it interrupted the](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction/)\nLAPSUS$ group’s source code download before it could finish, and that it was able to do so\nbecause LAPSUS$ publicly discussed their illicit access on their Telegram channel before\nthe download could complete.\n\nOne of the LAPSUS$ group members admitted on their Telegram channel that the Microsoft source\n\ncode download had been interrupted.\n\n“This public disclosure escalated our action allowing our team to intervene and interrupt the\nactor mid-operation, limiting broader impact,” Microsoft wrote. “No customer code or data\nwas involved in the observed activities. Our investigation has found a single account had\nbeen compromised, granting limited access. Microsoft does not rely on the secrecy of code\nas a security measure and viewing source code does not lead to elevation of risk.”\n\nWhile it may be tempting to dismiss LAPSUS$ as an immature and fame-seeking group,\ntheir tactics should make anyone in charge of corporate security sit up and take notice.\nMicrosoft says LAPSUS$ — which it boringly calls “DEV-0537” — mostly gains illicit access\nto targets via “social engineering.” This involves bribing or tricking employees at the target\norganization or at its myriad partners, such as customer support call centers and help desks.\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft found instances where the group successfully gained access to target\norganizations through recruited employees (or employees of their suppliers or business\npartners),” Microsoft wrote. The post continues:\n\n“DEV-0537 advertised that they wanted to buy credentials for their targets to entice\nemployees or contractors to take part in its operation. For a fee, the willing accomplice\nmust provide their credentials and approve the MFA prompt or have the user install\nAnyDesk or other remote management software on a corporate workstation allowing\nthe actor to take control of an authenticated system. Such a tactic was just one of the\nways DEV-0537 took advantage of the security access and business relationships their\ntarget organizations have with their service providers and supply chains.”\n\nThe LAPSUS$ Telegram channel has grown to more than 45,000 subscribers, and Microsoft\npoints to an ad LAPSUS$ posted there offering to recruit insiders at major mobile phone\nproviders, large software and gaming companies, hosting firms and call centers.\n\nSources tell KrebsOnSecurity that LAPSUS$ has been recruiting insiders via multiple social\nmedia platforms since at least November 2021. One of the core LAPSUS$ members who\nused the nicknames “Oklaqq” and “WhiteDoxbin” posted recruitment messages to Reddit last\nyear, offering employees at AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon up to $20,000 a week to perform\n“inside jobs.”\n\nLAPSUS$ leader Oklaqq a.k.a. “WhiteDoxbin” offering to pay $20,000 a week to corrupt employees\n\nat major mobile providers.\n\nMany of LAPSUS$’s recruitment ads are written in both English and Portuguese. According\n[to cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, the bulk of the group’s victims (15 of them) have been in](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/)\nLatin America and Portugal.\n\n“LAPSUS$ currently does not operate a clearnet or darknet leak site or traditional social\nmedia accounts—it operates solely via Telegram and email,” Flashpoint wrote in an analysis\nof the group. “LAPSUS$ appears to be highly sophisticated, carrying out increasingly high\n\n-----\n\nprofile data breaches. The group has claimed it is not state-sponsored. The individuals\nbehind the group are likely experienced and have demonstrated in-depth technical\nknowledge and abilities.”\n\nMicrosoft said LAPSUS$ has been known to target the personal email accounts of\nemployees at organizations they wish to hack, knowing that most employees these days use\nsome sort of VPN to remotely access their employer’s network.\n\n“In some cases, [LAPSUS$] first targeted and compromised an individual’s personal or\nprivate (non-work-related) accounts giving them access to then look for additional credentials\nthat could be used to gain access to corporate systems,” Microsoft wrote. “Given that\nemployees typically use these personal accounts or numbers as their second-factor\nauthentication or password recovery, the group would often use this access to reset\npasswords and complete account recovery actions.”\n\nIn other cases, Microsoft said, LAPSUS$ has been seen calling a target organization’s help\ndesk and attempting to convince support personnel to reset a privileged account’s\ncredentials.\n\n“The group used the previously gathered information (for example, profile pictures) and had\na native-English-sounding caller speak with the help desk personnel to enhance their social\nengineering lure,” Microsoft explained. “Observed actions have included DEV-0537\nanswering common recovery prompts such as “first street you lived on” or “mother’s maiden\nname” to convince help desk personnel of authenticity. Since many organizations outsource\ntheir help desk support, this tactic attempts to exploit those supply chain relationships,\nespecially where organizations give their help desk personnel the ability to elevate\nprivileges.”\n\n\n-----\n\nLAPSUS$ recruiting insiders via its Telegram channel.\n\n## SIM-SWAPPING PAST SECURITY\n\n[Microsoft said LAPSUS$ also has used “SIM swapping” to gain access to key accounts at](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sim+swapping)\ntarget organizations. In a fraudulent SIM swap, the attackers bribe or trick mobile company\nemployees into transferring a target’s mobile phone number to their device. From there, the\nattackers can intercept any one-time passwords sent to the victim via SMS or phone call.\nThey can also then reset the password for any online account that allows password resets\nvia a link sent over SMS.\n\n“Their tactics include phone-based social engineering; SIM-swapping to facilitate account\ntakeover; accessing personal email accounts of employees at target organizations; paying\nemployees, suppliers, or business partners of target organizations for access to credentials\nand multifactor authentication (MFA) approval; and intruding in the ongoing crisiscommunication calls of their targets,” Microsoft wrote.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Allison Nixon is chief research officer at** [Unit 221B, a cybersecurity consultancy based in](https://www.unit221b.com/)\nNew York that closely tracks cybercriminals involved in SIM-swapping. Working with\nresearchers at security firm Palo Alto Networks, Nixon has been tracking individual\nmembers of LAPSUS$ prior to their forming the group, and says the social engineering\ntechniques adopted by the group have long been abused to target employees and\ncontractors working for the major mobile phone companies.\n\n“LAPSUS$ may be the first to make it extremely obvious to the rest of the world that there\nare a lot of soft targets that are not telcos,” Nixon said. “The world is full of targets that are\nnot used to being targeted this way.”\n\nMicrosoft says LAPSUS$ also has been known to gain access to victim organizations by\ndeploying the “Redline” password-stealing malware, searching public code repositories for\nexposed passwords, and purchasing credentials and session tokens from criminal forums.\n\nThat last bit is interesting because Nixon said it appears at least one member of LAPSUS$\nalso was involved in the intrusion at game maker Electronic Arts (EA) last year, in which\nextortionists demanded payment in exchange for a promise not to publish 780 GB worth of\nsource code. In an interview with Motherboard, the hackers claimed to have gained access\nto EA’s data after purchasing authentication cookies for an EA Slack channel from a dark\n[web marketplace called Genesis.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/crime-shop-sells-hacked-logins-to-other-crime-shops/)\n\n“The hackers said they used the authentication cookies to mimic an already-logged-in EA\nemployee’s account and access EA’s Slack channel and then trick an EA IT support staffer\n[into granting them access to the company’s internal network,” wrote Catalin Cimpanu for](https://therecord.media/hackers-leak-full-ea-data-after-failed-extortion-attempt/)\n_The Record._\n\nWhy is Nixon convinced LAPSUS$ was behind the EA attack? The “WhiteDoxbin/Oklaqq”\nidentity referenced in the first insider recruitment screenshot above appears to be the group’s\nleader, and it has used multiple nicknames across many Telegram channels. However,\nTelegram lumps all aliases for an account into the same Telegram ID number.\n\nBack in May 2021, WhiteDoxbin’s Telegram ID was used to create an account on a\nTelegram-based service for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, where\nthey introduced themself as “@breachbase.” News of EA’s hack last year was first posted to\nthe cybercriminal underground by the user “Breachbase” on the English-language hacker\ncommunity RaidForums, which was recently seized by the FBI.\n\n## WHO IS LAPSUS$?\n\nNixon said WhiteDoxbin — LAPSUS$’s apparent ringleader — is the same individual who\nlast year purchased the Doxbin, a long-running, text-based website where anyone can post\nthe personal information of a target, or find personal data on hundreds of thousands who\nhave already been “doxed.”\n\n\n-----\n\nApparently, Doxbin s new owner failed to keep the site functioning smoothly, because top\nDoxbin members had no problems telling WhiteDoxbin how unhappy they were with his\nstewardship.\n\n“He wasn’t a good administrator, and couldn’t keep the website running properly,” Nixon said.\n“The Doxbin community was pretty upset, so they started targeting him and harassing him.”\n\nNixon said that in January 2022, WhiteDoxbin reluctantly agreed to relinquish control over\nDoxbin, selling the forum back to its previous owner at a considerable loss. However, just\nbefore giving up the forum, WhiteDoxbin leaked the entire Doxbin data set (including private\ndoxes that had remained unpublished on the site as drafts) to the public via Telegram.\n\nThe Doxbin community responded ferociously, posting on WhiteDoxbin perhaps the most\nthorough dox the community had ever produced, including videos supposedly shot at night\noutside his home in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to the denizens of Doxbin, WhiteDoxbin started out in the business of buying and\nselling zero-day vulnerabilities, security flaws in popular software and hardware that even the\nmakers of those products don’t yet know about.\n\n“[He] slowly began making money to further expand his exploit collection,” reads his Doxbin\nentry. “After a few years his net worth accumulated to well over 300BTC (close to $14 mil).”\n\nWhiteDoxbin’s Breachbase identity on RaidForums at one point in 2020 said they had a\nbudget of $100,000 in bitcoin with which to buy zero-day flaws in Github, Gitlab, Twitter,\nSnapchat, Cisco VPN, Pulse VPN and other remote access or collaboration tools.\n\n“My budget is $100000 in BTC,” Breachbase told Raidforums in October 2020. “Person who\ndirects me to someone will get $10000 BTC. Reply to thread if you know anyone or\nanywhere selling this stuff. NOTE: The 0day must have high/critical impact.”\n\nKrebsOnSecurity is not publishing WhiteDoxbin’s alleged real name because he is a minor\n(currently aged 17), and because this person has not officially been accused of a crime.\nAlso, the Doxbin entry for this individual includes personal information on his family\nmembers.\n\nNixon said that prior to launching LAPSUS$, WhiteDoxbin was a founding member of a\n[cybercriminal group calling itself the “Recursion Team.” According to the group’s now-defunct](https://web.archive.org/web/20210410013319/http://recursion.team/)\nwebsite, they mostly specialized in SIM swapping targets of interest and participating in\n[“swatting” attacks, wherein fake bomb threats, hostage situations and other violent scenarios](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=swatting)\nare phoned in to police as part of a scheme to trick them into visiting potentially deadly force\non a target’s address.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe team is made up of Cyber-enthusiasts who major in skills including security penetration,\nsoftware development, and botting,” reads the now-defunct Recursion Team website. “We\nplan to have a bright future, and we hope you do too!”\n\n**Update, March 24, 11:11 a.m. ET: The BBC is quoting City of London Police as saying**\n[seven people between the ages of 16 and 21 have been arrested in connection with an](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60864283)\ninvestigation into a hacking group. All have been released under investigation.\n\n\n-----",
