    "plain_text": "# When Karma Comes Back\n\n**blog.group-ib.com/swarmshop**\n\n08.04.2021\n\nThe rise and fall of illicit cardshop breached twice in two years\n\n\n-----\n\nSergei Kokurin\n\nThreat Intelligence Analyst, Group-IB\n\n[Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system found that user data of the Swarmshop](https://www.group-ib.com/intelligence-attribution.html)\ncardshop has been leaked online on March 17, 2021. The database was posted on a\ndifferent underground forum and contained 12,344 records of the card shop admins, sellers\nand buyers including their nicknames, hashed passwords, contact details, history of activity,\nand current balance. In addition to user data, the database exposed all compromised data\ntraded on the website, including 623,036 payment card records, 498 sets of online banking\naccount credentials and 69,592 sets of US Social Security Numbers and Canadian Social\nInsurance Numbers.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile underground hacker forums get hacked from time to time, cardhsop breaches do not\nhappen very often. In addition to buyers' and sellers' data, such breaches expose massive\namounts of compromised payment and personal information of regular users. Although the\nsource remains unknown, it must be one of those revenge hacks cases. This is a major\nreputation hit for the illicit cardshop as all the sellers lost their goods and personal data. The\ncardshop is unlikely to restore its status\n\nGroup-IB Threat Intelligence unit took a deep dive into the history of illicit cardshop,\nexamined the driving forces behind its rise and fall, and discovered that the underground\nmarketplace was breach twice in just two years by fellow cybercriminals.\n**Swarmshop profile**\n\n**Swarmshop - is an underground mid-size \"neighborhood\" store for stolen personal and**\npayment records. The cardshop has been operating since at least 2019, as the resource was\nfirst mentioned on underground forums in April 2019.\n\nThe user nicknamed \"Swarmshop\" is likely a cardshop administrator as they post information\nabout updating databases and answers user questions on various forums under different\nnicknames. It is also known that cardshop admins are Russian-speaking.\n\nBy March 2021, it had more than 12K user base and over 600K payment card records on\nsale. The total amount deposited on all the accounts was at $18,145.73 – users of card\nshops do not store large amounts of money on their accounts and top up the balance to\nmake payments if necessary.\n\nThis information was obtained from the data exposed in the March 2021 breach.\nInterestingly, it was not the first time Swarmshop has been targeted by fellow hackers. In\nJanuary 2020, the cardshop's records were leaked on an underground forum.\n\n**Swarmshop database leak in January 2020**\n\nOn January 19, 2020, a user of the \"procrd\" forum, likely motivated by revenge, posted a\nmessage with an offer to sell the Swarmshop database.\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution\n\nThe user provided two screenshots as evidence, presumably taken from the admin panel of\nthe Swarmshop.\n\nSource: Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution\n\nThe site administrators made no comment about the post, despite the fact that it was\npublished in one of their advertising threads.\n\nFour days later, an end-of-maintenance message appeared.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere were no other messages related to this database leak from neither the users nor the\nadministrators.\n\n**Swarmshop database leak in March 2021**\n\nOn March 17, 2021, a newly-registered user posted a link and password from the database\nof the \"Swarmshop\" market on the \"crdclub\" forum.\n\nScreenshot from the \"crdclub\" forum\n\nOn March 18, 2021, a user with similar nicknames posted the same link and password on\n\"tor\" and \"procrd\" forums and added one sentence: \"leak of cc shop swarmshop\".\n\nIt should be noted that in the case of all three accounts that posted these messages, they\nwere the user's first and only messages on the forums.\n\nThe post on procrd is currently deleted from the forum. Nevertheless, Group-IB Threat\nIntelligence & Attribution system was able to retrieve the original posts.\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution\n\nOn March 17, twenty minutes after the first message about the Swarmshop database\nappeared. A different user posted a message about Swarmshop on the \"bhf\" forum in the\ntopic dedicated to the market.\n\nScreenshot from the \"bhf\" forum (\"Shop leaked, full CC and users\")\n\nAs is clear from subsequent messages, the website administrator was not aware that the\ndatabase had been leaked.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot from the \"bhf\" forum\n\n(Swarmshop admin: \"Who are you, clown?\" bhf forum user: \"You're the only clown in this\nsituation. I will provide a pass in md5 at anyone's request\")\n\nIn the last message, the administrator says that the data was leaked more than a year ago.\n\n(\"The old database, since the spring of last year, after that, the passwords were all changed\nand the bug was closed. And the comments. I already sent you to the place where you came\nfrom.\")\n\nHowever, users reported that they received a recommendation to change their password on\nthe website.\n\n\n-----\n\n(\"This is probably the reason for the news about the recommendation of changing passwords\nin the shop? Keep justifying yourself - anyone who needs to will nd their username in the\ndatabase\")\n\nWithin a week of the leak, if someone tried to enter the website, occasionally a message was\ndisplayed: \"Maintenance\".\n\nAt the same time, users experienced problems with their balance, the ticket system, and\ntrying to communicate with the website administrator.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshots from the \"ascarding\" forum\n\nScreenshot from the \"bhf\" forum (\"It seems to have been accepted, but the money has not\nbeen transferred to the balance, I also replenished it through LTC\")\n\nOn March 25, the Swarmshop administrator posted a message about server maintenance\nending. The message also mentioned the high number of tickets received.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot from the \"bhf\" forum\n\nThe messages appeared on various forums in all topics related to the Swarmshop market.\n\nOn one of the forums, on March 17, a few hours after the rst message with the Swarmshop\ndatabase was posted, one of the users complained about problems with the site. They said\nthat a large balance was suddenly credited to his account, but all the purchased cards were\ninvalid.\n\n(\"I have been using this shop for a long time, recently there was an error in this store and my\nwallet was replenished with $3,300, I purchased all possible cc, to my surprise all cc were\neither empty orinvalid, I spent $3,300 on empty and dead cc! awful store, any update or bin\ncc will take away yourstrength and nerves. do not work with this shop !!!\")\n\nThe response from the administrator did not come until March 25, after the maintenance\nreport. According to the response, an error occurred in connection with updating databases\nand removing old, \"non-working\" cards.\n\n\n-----\n\n(\"Yes, old databases really were cleaned out and the system for replenishing and checking\ncards was optimized. At the time when this was being done, the site was closed, but for\nsome unknown reasonseveral buyers were able to enter the shop and, due to a bug, their\nbalances were replenished by N amount. What you bought in a panic before we noticed the\nbug were databases intended for deletion (old bases and bases with a low validity auction).\nAt the time that work was being carried out, normal bases were shut down for security\nreasons. For all buyers who replenished due to the bug,we returned their balance to what it\nwas before and the accounts have been unlocked.\")\n\n**Analysis of information exposed in March breach**\n\nThe analysis of the database found the structured data les subdivided into two categories:\n\nDetailed compromised payment and personal records traded on the cardhsop\nInformation about cardshop admins, sellers, and buyers.\n\nSwarmshop users in the database are divided into three groups: \"Admin\" (website\nadministrators and moderators),\"Seller\" (accounts belonging to sellers who post data for\nsale), and \"Buyer\" (accounts belonging to regular users).\n\nEach account is assigned one of four statuses. \"Active\" (valid account without restrictions) on\nthe one hand, and \"Archive\", \"Blocked\", and \"Suspended\" on the other (presumably accounts\nwith various kinds of restrictions to access the site).\n\nThe analysis of the freshly exposed database found that the information was new as it\nindicated the latest user activity timestamps. Considering that the most recent date in the\ndatabase is March 10, 2021 08:18:36, it can be assumed that the data was downloaded\nbetween 8:18 and 9:00 on March 10. However, the time zone cannot be deduced from the\nles.\n\nIn total, the databased revealed the records of 4 cardshop admins, 90 sellers, and 12,250\nbuyers of stolen data, including their nicknames, hashed passwords, account balance, and\ncontact details for some entries. The share of various statuses are shown in the table below.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the case of Buyer accounts, the amount of funds deposited into the account was also\nindicated: $18,145.73. Users of card shops do not store large amounts of money on their\naccounts and top up the balance to make payments if necessary.\n\nWhile the source of the breach remains unclear, the exposed records show that two card\nshop users attempted to inject a malicious script searching for website vulnerabilities in the\ncontact information field. It's impossible to determine if the two events are connected to the\nbreach.\n\nCompromised payment and personal records in the database were divided into three types:\n\n- CC - full bank card details (number, expiration date, owner name, etc.)\n\n- VBA - login and password for online bank accounts or payment systems\n\n- SSN - Social Security Number (also contained SIN – Social Insurance Numbers in\nCanada)\n\nThe dump contained 623,036 payment card records, 62.7 percent of which were issued by\nthe US banks. Other records were issued by the financial institutions from China (14.02%),\nthe UK (3.24%), Canada (3.09%), France (3.07%), Singapore (1.6%), Brazil (1.32%), Saudi\nArabia (0.99%), and Mexico (0.86%). Group-IB notified the national CERTs in the\nabovementioned countries about the breach so they could take the necessary steps to\nmitigate the threat.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to stolen bank cards, the database revealed 498 sets of online banking account\ncredentials and 68,995 sets of US Social Security Numbers and 597 pieces of Canadian\nSocial Insurance Numbers.\n\nCompanies that process user personal and payment information need to ensure the integrity\n[and security of customer data by putting in place advanced Threat Intelligence & Attribution](https://www.group-ib.com/intelligence-attribution.html)\nsolutions which allow to monitor for leaked credentials. Constant underground monitoring for\ncompromised personal and payment customer records, gives banks and financial\norganisations the ability to mitigate risks and further damage by quickly blocking stolen\ncards.\n\n**Swarmshop growth: 2019 - 2021**\n\nBased on the data obtained from the leaks that occurred in 2020 and 2021, it is possible to\nanalyze how the market developed over the years.\n\nFor example, \"Seller\" accounts increased by 36 (90 in total compared to 54 at the time of the\nrst leak). The number of \"Buyer\" accounts grew more than 2.5 times (from 4,757 to 12,250).\nIt is worth clarifying, however, that the number of discovered accounts is only a total number\nand does not reect the number of users who were active on the resource. Another\nparameter using which we were able to compare the two leaks is the unspent funds on\n\"Buyer\" accounts: $8,242 during the leak in 2020 and as much as $18,145 during the data\nbreach in March, 2021.\n\nThe net prot of the Swarmshop administrators at the time of the rst leak was about $1,300\nper month, while in 2021 it is fair to assume that it was as much as $5,300 per month. The\n\n\n-----\n\nchange is due to an increase in the total number of Buyer accounts and fees for\nSwarmshop administration services increasing from 20% to 30%.\n\n**Recommendations for financial organisations**\n\n- Notify users of possible risks in the online payment process when using bank cards.\n\n- If payment cards related to your bank have been compromised, block these cards and\nnotify the users as soon as possible.\n\n- Receive first-hand reports about compromised payment and personal records sales on the\nDark web. Check for the cards issued by the bank in the DBs for sale.\n\nTo access unique closed sources, and improve your visibility into the underground card\n[shops you may use Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution.](https://www.group-ib.com/intelligence-attribution.html)\n\nShare\n\nReceive insights on the latest cybercrime trends\n\n\n-----",
