Eventually, the campaign grew to hundreds of\ninstances.\n\nINKY caught enough of these attempts to do a thorough analysis of the campaign, which is\nset out in this edition of Fresh Phish.\n\n### Quick Take: Attack Flow Overview\n\n\n-----\n\n**Type: Phishing**\n**Vector: Spoofed DoL senders and newly created look-alike domains**\n**Payload: Malicious links in PDF attachments leading to credential harvesting sites**\n**Techniques: Brand impersonation, mail server abuse, VIP impersonation**\n**Platform: Google Workspace and Microsoft 365**\n**Target: Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 users**\n\n## The Attack\n\nIn this campaign, the majority of phishing attempts had sender email addresses spoofed to\nlook as if they came from no-reply@dol[.]gov, which is the real DoL site. A small subset was\nspoofed to look as if they came from no-reply@dol[.]com, which is, of course, not the real\nDoL domain.\n\nThe rest came from a set of newly created look-alike domains:\n\ndol-gov[.]com\ndol-gov[.]us\nbids-dolgov[.]us\n\n_Distribution of spoofed domains_\n\n\n-----\n\nThese phishing emails invited recipients to submit bids for ongoing government projects\nand claimed to be from a senior DoL employee responsible for procurement.\n\n_Email impersonating the U.S. DoL_\n\nEach phishing email had a three-page PDF attachment (shown below) with well-crafted DoL\nbranding elements.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Page 1 of PDF attachment_\n\n_Page 2 of PDF attachment_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Page 3 of PDF attachment_\n\nRecipients were instructed to click the “BID” button on Page 2 to access DoL’s procurement\nportal. Behind the button was a malicious link. The links varied, but they all led to malicious\ndomains that impersonated the DoL.\n\nHere are the variants INKY detected:\n\nopendolbid[.]us\nusdol-gov[.]com\nbid-dolgov[.]us\nus-dolbids[.]us\ndol-bids[.]us\nopenbids-dolgov[.]us\nopen-biddolgov[.]us\nopenbids-dolgov[.]com\nusdol-gov[.]us\ndolbids[.]com\nopenbid-dolgov[.]us\ndol[.]global\n\nWhat the victim saw when they reached the evil site was a set of fake instructions.\n\n_Fake instructions on how to submit a bid_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the victim closed the instructions, what they saw was an identical copy of the real DoL\nwebsite. The clever phishers had simply copied HTML and CSS from the real site and\npasted it into the phishing site.\n\n_Identical copy of DoL site (except for red “Click here to bid” button)_\n\nVictims who clicked on the red “Click here to bid” button was presented with a credential\nharvesting form with instructions to sign in and bid using a Microsoft or other business email\naccount.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Credential harvesting form_\n\nWhen an INKY engineer made the first attempt at entering fake credentials, the site\ndisplayed a fake incorrect credentials error. But behind the scenes, those fake credentials\nhad already been harvested (and either stored on the malicious site or emailed to the\nphisher).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fake incorrect credentials error_\n\nIn a classic “blow-off,” when our engineer made a second attempt at entering fake\ncredentials, they were redirected to the real DoL site. This nuanced touch, borrowed from\ncon artistry that well predates the digital era, is designed to confuse the victim and delay the\nmoment when they realize that they were taken.\n\n_The real DoL site_\n\n## Techniques\n\nIn the majority of these attacks (the ones in which the spoofed sender was either noreply@dol[.]gov or no-reply@dol[.]com), the phishers were able to send their phishing emails\nfrom abused servers nominally controlled by a non-profit professional membership group.\n\n_Received headers of a phish sent on New Year's Day_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this example s received headers (the path of servers through which the email travelled),\nthe email originated from 185.105.7.219, and the non-profit’s abused mail server accepted it\nbefore passing it off to Microsoft Outlook servers. This technique allowed the phishing email\nto receive a DKIM pass for the reputable group’s domain. An investigation into\n185.105.7.219 revealed that the IP address was associated with albacasino[.]com, a new\ndomain created barely a week prior.\n\nIn other cases, the phishers used newly created domains to both send initial phishing emails\nand host fake DoL sites. Newly created domains are a black-hat favorite because they are\nable to pass standard email authentication (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC). Since they are brand\nnew, the domains represent zero-day vulnerabilities; they have never been seen before and\ntypically do not appear in threat intelligence feeds commonly referenced by legacy antiphishing tools. Without a blemish, these sites used in this exploit did not look malicious.\n\n_A WHOIS lookup surfaced a recently created phishing domain_\n\nAlthough several email security vendors use computer vision to detect impersonation sites,\nsimplistic computer vision would not have helped in this case because the first thing the\nvictim saw was the instructions, which concealed the actual impersonated site.\n\n## Recap of Techniques\n\n**Brand impersonation — is done seamlessly by phishers who copy and paste HTML**\nand CSS directly from the real DoL site to spoof it\n**Abuse of a mail server — leverages a legitimate organization’s mail server to send**\nphishing emails\n**Newly created domains — are not yet known by threat intelligence feeds and**\ntherefore pass rudimentary security checks\n**Credential harvesting — occurs when a victim tries to log into what they think is a real**\ngovernment site and ends up instead entering credentials into a form controlled by the\nphishers\n\n\n-----\n\n## Best Practices: Guidance and Recommendations\n\nOfficial U.S. government domains usually end in .gov or .mil rather than .com or another\nsuffix.\n\nThe U.S. government does not typically send out cold emails to solicit bids for projects.\n\nPotential victims should be aware that it makes no sense to be asked to log in with email\ncredentials to view a document on a completely different network.\n\nFor message administrators, it ought to be clear that SMTP servers should not be configured\nto accept and forward emails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by\nunauthenticated and unauthorized users.\n\n**Read more of INKY’s past** **[Fresh Phish, and subscribe to receive our news and articles](https://www.inky.com/blog/tag/fresh-phish)**\n**directly to your inbox.**\n\n---------------------\n_INKY is an_ _[award-winning, cloud-based email security solution developed to proactively](https://www.inky.com/awards-recognition)_\n_eliminate phishing emails and malware while simultaneously providing real-time assistance_\n_to employees handling suspicious emails so they can make safer decisions.
