We\nhave observed these new tools being used to target U.S.-based chain restaurants, although\nFIN7 has previously targeted hospitality organizations, retailers, merchant services, suppliers\nand others. The new macros and Bateleur backdoor use sophisticated anti-analysis and\nsandbox evasion techniques as they attempt to cloak their activities and expand their victim\npool.\n\nSpecifically, the first FIN7 change we observed was in the obfuscation technique found in\ntheir usual document attachments delivering the GGLDR script [1], initially described by\nresearchers at FireEye [2]. In addition, starting in early June, we observed this threat actor\nusing macro documents to drop a previously undocumented JScript backdoor, which we\nhave named “Bateleur”, instead of dropping their customary GGLDR payload. Since its initial\nsighting, there have been multiple updates to Bateleur and the attachment macros.\n\nIn this blog we take a deep dive into Bateleur and the email messages and documents\ndelivering it.\n\n**Delivery**\n\nThe example message (Fig. 1) uses a very simple lure to target a restaurant chain. It\npurports to be information on a previously discussed check. The email is sent from an\nOutlook.com account, and the attachment document lure also matches that information by\nclaiming “This document is encrypted by Outlook Protect Service”. In other cases, when the\nmessage was sent from a Gmail account, the lure document instead claims “This document\nis encrypted by Google Documents Protect Service” (Fig. 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1:_ _[Phishing email containing JScript document dropper](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/phishing)_\n\n_Figure 2: Malicious “Outlook” document lure (left) and “Google” lure (right)_\n\n**Analysis**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email contains a macro-laden Word document. The macro accesses the malicious\npayload via a caption: UserForm1.Label1.Caption (Fig. 3). The caption contains a “|*|”delimited obfuscated JScript payload (Fig. 4). The macro first extracts the JScript from the\ncaption then saves the content to debug.txt in the current user’s temporary folder (%TMP%).\nNext, the macro executes the following commands, which are stored in an obfuscated\nmanner by reversing the character order:\n\n1. schtasks /create /f /tn \"\"GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCorefh5evfbce5bhfd37\"\" /tr\n\n_\"\"wscript.exe //b /e:jscript %TMP%\\debug.txt \"\" /sc ONCE /st \"\"05:00\"\" /sd_\n_\"\"12/12/1990\"\"_\n2. Sleep for 3 seconds\n3. schtasks /Run /I /TN \"\"GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCorefh5evfbce5bhfd37\"\"\n4. Sleep for 10 seconds\n5. schtasks /Delete /F /TN \"\"GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCorefh5evfbce5bhfd37\"\"\n\nIn the first step, the macro creates a scheduled task whose purpose is to execute debug.txt\nas a JScript. The macro then sleeps for 3 seconds, after which it runs the scheduled task.\nFinally, the macro sleeps for 10 seconds then deletes the malicious scheduled task. The\ncombined effect of these commands is to run Bateleur on the infected system in a\nroundabout manner in an attempt to evade detection.\n\n_Figure 3: Macro from_\n_c91642c0a5a8781fff9fd400bff85b6715c96d8e17e2d2390c1771c683c7ead9_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Caption containing malicious obfuscated JScript_\n\nThe malicious JScript has robust capabilities that include anti-sandbox functionality, antianalysis (obfuscation), retrieval of infected system information, listing of running processes,\nexecution of custom commands and PowerShell scripts, loading of EXEs and DLLs, taking\nscreenshots, uninstalling and updating itself, and possibly the ability to exfiltrate passwords,\nalthough the latter requires an additional module from the command and control server\n(C&C).\n\nWhen Bateleur first executes it creates a scheduled task\n“GoogleUpdateTaskMachineSystem” for persistence using the following command pattern:\n\n_schtasks /Create /f /tn \"GoogleUpdateTaskMachineSystem\" /tr \"wscript.exe //b /e:jscript_\n_C:\\Users\\[user account]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{[hex]-[hex]-[hex]-[hex]-[hex]}\\debug.txt\"_\n_/sc minute /mo 5_\n\nBateleur has anti-sandbox features but they do not appear to be used at this time. This\nincludes detection of Virtualbox, VMware, or Parallels via SMBIOSBIOSVersion and any of\nthe following strings in DeviceID:\n\n_vmware_\n_PCI\\\\VEN_80EE&DEV_CAFE_\n_VMWVMCIHOSTDEV_\n\nThe backdoor also contains a process name blacklist including:\n\n_autoit3.exe_\n_dumpcap.exe_\n_tshark.exe_\n_prl_cc.exe_\n\n\n-----\n\nBateleur also checks its own script name and compares it to a blacklist which could indicate\nthat the script is being analyzed by an analyst or a sandbox:\n\n_[malware](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)_\n_sample_\n_mlwr_\n_Desktop_\n\nThe following Table describes the commands available in the backdoor.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nget_information Return various information about the infected machine, such as\ncomputer and domain name, OS, screen size, and net view\n\nget_process_list Return running process list (name + id)\n\nkill_process Kill process using taskkill\n\nuninstall Delete installation file and path and remove scheduled task\n_GoogleUpdateTaskMachineSystem_\n\nupdate Overwrite JScript file with response content\n\nexe Perform a “load_exe” request to the C&C to retrieve an EXE, save it as\n_debug.backup in the install_path, write a cmd.exe command to a file_\nnamed debug.cmd and then execute debug.cmd with cmd.exe\n\nwexe Perform a “load_exe” request to C&C to retrieve an EXE, save it as\n_debug.log and then execute the EXE via WMI_\n\ndll Perform a “load_dll” request to the C&C to retrieve a DLL, save it as\n_debug.backup in the install_path, write a regsvr32 command to a file_\nnamed debug.cmd and then execute debug.cmd with cmd.exe\n\ncmd Perform a “load_cmd” request to the C&C to retrieve a command to\nexecute, create temp file named log_[date].cmd containing command to\nexecute, execute the command and sleep for 55 seconds. Send file\noutput to the C&C via a POST request and remove the temporary\ncommand file\n\n\n-----\n\npowershell Perform a “load_powershell” request to the C&C to retrieve a command\nto execute, create a temp file named log_[date].log containing a\nPowerShell command to execute, execute the command, and sleep for\n55 seconds. Send file output to the C&C via a POST request and\nremove the temporary command file\n\napowershell Same as powershell command but instead executes a PowerShell\ncommand directly with powershell.exe\n\nwpowershell Same as powershell command but instead executes a PowerShell\ncommand via WMI\n\nget_screen Take a screenshot and save it as screenshot.png in the install_path\n\nget_passwords Perform a “load_pass” request to the C&C to retrieve a PowerShell\ncommand containing a payload capable of retrieving user account\ncredentials\n\ntimeout Do nothing\n\n_Table 1: List of commands available in the Bateleur backdoor_\n\nThe Bateleur C&C protocol occurs over HTTPS and is fairly straightforward with no\nadditional encoding or obfuscation. Bateleur uses HTTP POST requests with a URI of “/?\npage=wait” while the backdoor is waiting for instructions. Once an instruction is received\nfrom the controller (Fig. 5), the backdoor will perform a new request related to the received\ncommand (Fig. 6).\n\n_Figure 5: Bateleur HTTP POST “wait” request_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Bateleur HTTP POST receiving command from C&C_\n\nAfter each command the backdoor will respond with typically either an OK for many\ncommands, or send the results back to the C&C with a final POST request.\n\nAlthough Bateleur has a much smaller footprint than GGLDR/HALFBAKED, lacks basic\nfeatures such as encoding in the C&C protocol, and does not have backup C&C servers, we\nexpect the Bateleur developer(s) may add those features in the near future. In less than one\nmonth, we have observed Bataleur jump from version 1.0 to 1.0.4.1; the newer version of the\nbackdoor adds several new commands including the wexe, apowershell, and wpowershell\n(Table 1) that did not exist in version 1.0.\n\n**Attribution**\n\nProofpoint researchers have determined with a high degree of certainty that this backdoor is\nbeing used by the same group that is referred to as FIN7 by FireEye [3] and as Carbanak by\nTrustWave [4] and others. In this section we will discuss each datapoint that connects this\nbackdoor with previous FIN7 activity.\n\n_Email Message/Campaign Similarity_\n\nIn June we observed similar messages separately delivering GGLDR and Bateleur to the\nsame target, with some even sharing very similar or identical attachment names, subject\nlines, and/or sender addresses. The timing and similarity between these campaigns suggest\nthat they were sent by the same actor.\n\n_Tinymet_\n\nA small Meterpreter downloader script, called Tinymet by the actor(s) (possibly inspired by\n\n[5]), has repeatedly been observed being utilized by this group at least as far back as 2016\n\n[6] as a Stage 2 payload. In at least one instance, we observed Bateleur downloading the\nsame Tinymet Meterpreter downloader (Fig. 7).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Beginning snippet from Tinymet downloaded by Bateleur_\n\nMoreover, the GGLDR/HALFBAKED backdoor was recently equipped with a new command\n_tinymet (Fig. 8) which was used in at least one occasion (Fig. 9) to download a JScript_\nversion of the Tinymet Meterpreter downloader (Fig. 10).\n\n_Figure 8: GGLDR is updated with a Tinymet command_\n\n_FIgure 9: GGLDR receiving Tinymet command from C&C (after decoding base64 with_\n_custom alphabet)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Snippet from Tinymet downloaded by GGLDR tinymet command_\n\nWe have also observed Tinymet delivered via the runps1 (Fig. 11) and runvbs (Fig. 12)\ncommands, resulting in the same version of Tinymet downloaded by Bateleur (Fig. 13). All\nobserved instances of Tinymet have utilized the same XOR key of 0x50.\n\n_Figure 11: GGLDR receiving Tinymet via runps1 command_\n\n_Figure 12: GGLDR receiving Tinymet via runvbs command_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13: Snippet from decoded Tinymet downloaded by GGLDR runps1 and runvbs_\n_commands_\n\n_Password Grabber_\n\nDuring our analysis we observed that the Powershell password grabber utilized by Bateleur\ncontained an identical DLL (stealer_component_refl.dll 8c00afd815355a00c55036e5d18482f730d5e71a9f83fe23c7a1c0d9007ced5a) as the one we\nfound embedded in a powershell contained in recent GGLDR samples. This further\ndemonstrates the payload re-use between instances using the two different backdoors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe continue to see regular changes to the tactics and tools used by FIN7 in their attempt to\ninfect more targets and evade detection. The Bateleur JScript backdoor and new macroladen documents appear to be the latest in the group’s expanding toolset, providing new\nmeans of infection, additional ways of hiding their activity, and growing capabilities for\nstealing information and executing commands directly on victim machines.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/carbanak-group-uses-google-malwarecommand-and-control\n\n[2] [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/06/obfuscation-in-the-wild.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/06/obfuscation-in-the-wild.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n[3] [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/fin7-phishing-lnk.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/fin7-phishing-lnk.html)\n\n[4] https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Carbanak-Continues-To-Evolve-Quietly-Creeping-into-Remote-Hosts/\n\n[5] [https://github.com/SherifEldeeb/TinyMet](https://github.com/SherifEldeeb/TinyMet)\n\n[6] https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/New-Carbanak-/-Anunak-AttackMethodology/\n\n[7] https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Operation-Grand-Mars--acomprehensive-profile-of-Carbanak-activity-in-2016/17/\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n_Bateleur Document Droppers_\n\ncf86c7a92451dca1ebb76ebd3e469f3fa0d9b376487ee6d07ae57ab1b65a86f8\n\nc91642c0a5a8781fff9fd400bff85b6715c96d8e17e2d2390c1771c683c7ead9\n\n_FIN7 Password Stealer Module_\n\n8c00afd815355a00c55036e5d18482f730d5e71a9f83fe23c7a1c0d9007ced5a\n\n_Bateleur C&C_\n\n195.133.48[.]65:443\n\n195.133.49[.]73:443\n\n185.154.53[.]65:443\n\n188.120.241[.]27:443\n\n176.53.25[.]12:443\n\n5.200.53[.]61:443\n\n_Tinymet C&C_\n\n185.25.48[.]186:53\n\n46.166.168[.]213:443\n\n188.165.44[.]190:53\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Coverage**\n\n\n-----\n\n2825129,ETPRO TROJAN Carbanak VBS/GGLDR v2 Checkin\n\n2825130,ETPRO TROJAN Carbanak VBS/GGLDR v2 CnC Beacon\n\n2826201,ETPRO TROJAN Carbanak VBS/GGLDR v2 CnC Beacon 2\n\n2826592,ETPRO TROJAN Carbanak VBS/GGLDR v3 CnC Beacon\n\n2826631,ETPRO TROJAN Carbanak/FIN7 Bateleur SSL Certificate Detected\n\n2826167,ETPRO TROJAN Carbanak/FIN7 Tinymet Downloader Receiving Payload\n\n2826674,ETPRO TROJAN Carbanak/FIN7 Bateleur CnC Beacon\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
