The\n[operation is called WatchDog, taken from the name of a Linux daemon called watchdogd. The WatchDog mining operation](https://linux.die.net/man/8/watchdog)\nhas been running since Jan. 27, 2019, and has collected at least 209 Monero (XMR), valued to be around $32,056 USD.\nResearchers have determined that at least 476 compromised systems, composed primarily of Windows and NIX cloud\ninstances, have been performing mining operations at any one time for over two years.\n\nCryptojacking is the process of performing cryptomining operations on systems which are not owned and maintained by the\nmining operators. Malicious cryptojacking operations are currently estimated to affect [23% of cloud environments, up from](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/highlight-cloud-threat-report-iam/)\n[8% in 2018. This increase is primarily caused by the meteoric rise in cryptocurrencies’ valuation. The global market for](https://securelist.com/ransomware-and-malicious-crypto-miners-in-2016-2018/86238/)\nblockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency, is [anticipated to reach $60.7 billion by 2024, and criminal organizations](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worldwide-blockchain-report-market-shares-strategies-and-forecasts-2018-2024-market-is-anticipated-to-reach-607-billion-with-ibm-microsft--accenture-driving-blockchain-300581333.html)\nand actor groups are trying to cash in on this.\n\nWithin this blog, Unit 42 researchers provide an overview of the WatchDog cryptojacking campaign. The WatchDog miner is\ncomposed of a three-part Go Language binary set and a bash or PowerShell script file. The binaries perform specific\nfunctionality, one of which emulates the Linux watchdogd daemon functionality by ensuring that the mining process does not\nhang, overload or terminate unexpectedly. The second Go binary downloads a configurable list of IP addresses net ranges\nbefore providing the functionality of targeted exploitation operations of identified NIX or Windows systems discovered during\nthe scanning operation Finally the third Go binary script will initiate a mining operation on either Windows or NIX operating\n\n\n-----\n\nsystems (OS) using custom configurations from the initiated bash or PowerShell script. WatchDog s usage of Go binaries\nallows it to perform the stated operations across different operating systems using the same binaries, i.e. Windows and NIX,\nas long as the Go Language platform is installed on the target system.\n\nResearchers have mapped out the infrastructure behind the mining operations. They have identified 18 root IP endpoints and\nseven malicious domains, which serve at least 125 malicious URL addresses used to download its toolset.\n\n[Unit 42 reported on Graboid, a wormable Monero mining operation on Docker Hub, in October 2019. Graboid was the largest](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/graboid-first-ever-cryptojacking-worm-found-in-images-on-docker-hub/)\nknown mining operation to date in terms of the total number of active systems. At the time of its operation, it consisted of at\nleast 2,000 exposed and compromised Docker Daemon APIs systems. Each Graboid miner was operational 65% of the time,\nmeaning around 1,300 compromised Docker containers were mining at any one time. Additionally, Graboid could have also\nachieved higher processing speeds due to the configuration script utilizing all available container central processing units\n(CPUs). However, Graboid was only known to operate for up to three months before its Docker Hub images were removed.\n\nWatchDog, on the other hand, does not rely on a third-party site to host its malicious payload, allowing it to have remained\nactive for more than two years at the time of this writing.\n\nIt is clear that the WatchDog operators are skilled coders and have enjoyed a relative lack of attention regarding their mining\noperations. While there is currently no indication of additional cloud compromising activity at present (i.e. the capturing of\ncloud platform identity and access management (IAM) credentials, access ID or keys), there could be potential for further\ncloud account compromise. It is highly likely these actors could find IAM-related information on the cloud systems they have\nalready compromised, due to the root and administrative access acquired during the implantation of their cryptojacking\nsoftware.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks Prisma Access is configured to detect each of WatchDog’s 18 IP addresses, seven domains and their](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/access)\nassociated URL addresses through PAN-OS. [Prisma Cloud also detects the usage of malicious XMRig processes used by](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud)\nthe WatchDog miner operating in cloud environments that have Prisma Cloud Compute Defender installed.\n\n## Public Mining Pools\n\nUnit 42 researchers have identified three XMR wallet addresses within WatchDog configuration files. These configuration files\nare downloaded alongside the WatchDog mining binaries and contain the XMR wallet address and the mining pool(s) to be\nused during the mining operations. See Figure 1 for an example of the configuration file config.json.\n\nFigure\n\n1. config.json file detailing the XMR wallet address.\nExamining all known config.json files used by WatchDog, Unit 42 researchers have identified three XMR wallet addresses as:\n\n43zqYTWj1JG1H1idZFQWwJZLTos3hbJ5iR3tJpEtwEi43UBbzPeaQxCRysdjYTtdc8aHao7csiWa5BTP9PfNYzyfSbbrwoR\n\n82etS8QzVhqdiL6LMbb85BdEC3KgJeRGT3X1F3DQBnJa2tzgBJ54bn4aNDjuWDtpygBsRqcfGRK4gbbw3xUy3oJv7TwpUG4\n\n87q6aU1M9xmQ5p3wh8Jzst5mcFfDzKEuuDjV6u7Q7UDnAXJR7FLeQH2UYFzhQatde2WHuZ9LbxRsf3PGA8gpnGXL3G7iWMv\n\nThese three XMR wallet addresses are used with at least three public mining pools and one private mining pool to process\nmining operations, performance, functionality and payments.\n\n**Mining Pool** **Port** **Public or Private**\n\n\n-----\n\nxmr.f2pool[.]com 13531 Public\n\nxmr-eu2.nanopool[.]org 14444 Public\n\nxmr.pool.gntl[.]co.uk 40009 Public\n\n80[.]211[.]206[.]105 6666 Private\n\n_Table 1. Public and private mining pools used by the WatchDog miner._\n\nThe following eight screenshots illustrate the findings gathered from the f2pool, nanopool and the GNTL public mining pools\nfor each of the three XMR wallets identified.\n\n**f2pool mining pool**\n\nFigures 2 and 3 illustrate the XMR address beginning with “43zq” being heavily used within the f2pool public mining pool,\npulling in roughly 200 Monero. Meanwhile, the XMR wallet address starting with “82et” operates at a much lower scale and\nhas only pulled in 2.3 XMR (see Figures 4 and 5).\n\nFigure 2. XMR wallet 43zq and its XMR total.\n\nFigure 3. XMR wallet 43zq and its 30-day hashrate.\n\nFigure 4. XMR wallet 82et and its XMR total.\n\nFigure 5. XMR wallet 82et and its 30-day hashrate.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Nanopool mining pool**\n\nXMR address beginning with “82et” was less active within the f2pool public mining pool, but it is more involved within the\nnanopool public mining pool (see Figures 6 and 7) than the XMR wallet address beginning with “43zq” (see Figures 8 and 9).\nHowever, the nanopool mining operation only equates to a fraction of the total XMR mined by the WatchDog mining operation\nas a whole, with 6.8 XMR coins mined to date.\n\nFigure 6. XMR wallet 82et and its lifetime hashrate.\n\nFigure 7. XMR wallet 82et and its XMR payouts.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. XMR wallet 43zq and its lifetime hashrate.\n\nFigure 9. XMR wallet 43zq and its XMR total payout.\n\n**GNTL XMR mining pool**\n\nA single configuration file has been identified that links the potential of the wallet that begins with “87qa” to all three public\nmining pools listed here, but only GNTL displayed any mining operations related to the “87qa” XMR wallet (see Figure 10).\nHowever, this XMR wallet address does not seem to be greatly used within the WatchDog operations. As of this writing, only\n.59 XMR has been mined from GNTL using the “87qa” XMR address (see Figures 10 and 11).\n\nFigure 10. XMR wallet 87qa and XMR hashrate.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. XMR wallet 87qa and all XMR payouts.\nOut of the data collected from all three of the public mining pools, Unit 42 researchers calculated an average of 1,037KH/s\nhash rate from the XMR wallets across the public mining pools. Researchers then developed an estimate of the current\nnumber of systems actively participating in the cryptomining operation. Researchers conservatively estimate that an average\nof 476 systems are actively involved within the WatchDog mining operation at any one time.\n\nThis estimation was calculated using the documentation on CPU architecture from several of the largest cloud providers. All\ncloud providers advertise the use of Intel Xeon E5 and AMD EPYC CPUs for a majority of their cloud VM instances.\n\n[We can use the popular XMR mining software XMRig’s benchmark hash calculator to calculate the hash rates for mid-range](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)\n[Intel Xeon E5 and](https://xmrig.com/benchmark?cpu=Intel%28R%29+Xeon%28R%29+CPU+E5-2620+v3+%40+2.40GHz) [AMD EPYC series 7 processors. A single thread on each processor can produce an estimated hash rate of](https://xmrig.com/benchmark?cpu=AMD+EPYC+7601+32-Core+Processor)\n543 H/s (hashes per second) for the AMD EPYC series 7 and 544 H/s for the Intel Xeon E5. When taking into account the\nWatchDog miner configuration file, config.json, the miner will use at most four threads on the compromised system (see\nFigure 12).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. WatchDog miner CPU configuration.\n\nThis will result in the compromised system processing a total average of 2,172-2,176 H/s using at most four threads as per\nthe configuration guide. With an average total of 1,037 KH/s (thousand hashes per second) of processing for the total\nWatchDog miner operation, this leaves a potential total of 476 systems participating in the mining operation at any one time.\n\nThe number of systems would depend upon the VM instance type that was compromised and used. It is important to note\nthat not every compromised system would be able to process XMRig operations to the same scale. It is possible that double\nthis estimated number, nearly 900 systems, could be operating at any one time. This size of a mining operation is achievable\nif smaller, less robust, cloud VM instances were compromised and used to process XMR hashes.\n\n## WatchDog Infrastructure\n\nThe WatchDog miner has been active since at least Jan. 27, 2019, as witnessed from the public mining pool data. Since that\ntime, a number of malware samples have been identified that point to WatchDog infrastructure, specifically the initialization\nbash script that begins the system and mining configuration process for newly compromised systems.\n\nThrough analysis of these initialization bash scripts, Unit 42 researchers were able to track how WatchDog actors set up\nmining operations on a compromised system. The authors of the script tipped their hand to show how they set up and\nconfigure their mining infrastructure. Within every known operation, the initialization bash script is downloaded onto the\ncompromised system and performs a series of functions. Several of the functions are common to a majority of cryptojacking\noperations, namely the removal of cloud security tools, the removal of previously installed and known malicious cryptomining\nsoftware, and then the downloading and setup of the customized malicious cryptomining software. However, the WatchDog\nbash script miner also hardcodes a primary and secondary URL address that are used to download the WatchDog mining\ntoolkit (see Figure 13).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Establishing command and control\n\n(C2).\nUsing these primary and secondary URL addresses, Unit 42 researchers were able to map a rough estimation of the network\ninfrastructure used by the WatchDog miner operators.\n\nThe following Maltego chart illustrates the overall size of the known operation infrastructure used by WatchDog (see Figure\n14).\n\nFigure 14. Maltego chart of the WatchDog miner operation.\nTo date, there are currently 18 known IP addresses and seven known domains hosting at least 125 URLs that have served or\ncontinue to serve the WatchDog miner malware and configuration files. While the majority of the malware appears to be\nfocused on *NIX OS systems, there are several Windows OS binaries that are also hosted on several of the known host\n\n\n-----\n\nsystems.\n\n39.100.33[.]209\n\n45.153.240[.]58\n\n45.9.148[.]37\n\n93.115.23[.]117\n\n95.182.122[.]199\n\n106.15.74[.]113\n\n107.173.159[.]206\n\n146.71.79[.]230\n\n185.181.10[.]234\n\n185.232.65[.]124\n\n185.232.65[.]191\n\n185.232.65[.]192\n\n185.247.117[.]64\n\n198.98.57[.]187\n\n199.19.226[.]117\n\n204.44.105[.]168\n\n205.209.152[.]78\n\n208.109.11[.]21\n\n_Table 2.

The seven known domains associated with the WatchDog miner._\n\nFor a full list of the known URL Addresses associated with the WatchDog mining operation, see the Indicators of\nCompromise (IOC) section of this blog.\n\nResearchers found that several of these host systems were still operational at the time the research for this blog was being\nconducted. Due to the live status, researchers were able to pull down several of the malicious files for further analysis. A full\nIOC breakdown of the files and their SHA-256 hash is listed below within the IOC section.\n\n## WatchDog Malware Breakdown\n\nUnit 42 researchers selected five interrelated malware samples to explain their functionality. The cryptojacking operation\nappears to begin with a bash script, newdat.sh, which defines the downloadable content for three separate Go binary files\nand one JSON configuration file config.json. The Go binaries detailed within this blog are a network scanner and exploitation\n\n\n-----\n\nbinary called networkmanager, a process monitoring binary called phpguard, and a version of the malicious XMRig\ncryptomining software called phpupdate.\n\n**newdat.sh**\n\nUnit 42 researchers have identified four different filenames for bash scripts that perform the same infrastructure, network\nscanning and system configuration operations. These file names are init.sh, newinit.sh, newdat.sh and update.sh.\n\nThere are eight unique operations within the initialization script:\n\nEnvironmental setup\n\nConfigure file and directory read/write permissions and save downloaded files to preconfigured locations.\nUninstallation of cloud security tools\n\nNamely [Alibaba Cloud Security Center and](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/42302.htm?spm=a2c63.l28256.a3.7.28a97cceyxtiqE) [Tencent Cloud Security Operations Center.](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/soc)\n[This is a common operation used by several cryptojacking operations including groups such as Rocke and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/rockein-the-netflow/)\n[TeamTnT.](https://sensorstechforum.com/teamtnt-cryptomining-operation-steals-aws-credentials/)\nDownload toolkit\n\nDownload three Go Binaries and a configuration file.\nkill_miner_proc\n\nKilling known mining processes.\nkill_sus_proc\n\nKilling previously installed WatchDog mining processes.\ndownloads\n\nDownloads IP address ranges to be used for scanning.\nunlock_cron\n\nUnlocks the /etc/crontab file.\nlock_cron\n\nLocks the /etc/crontab file.\n\nPerhaps one of the most useful script operations identified by Unit 42 researchers is the section pertaining to the download\nlocation of the WatchDog toolkit. As illustrated within the previous infrastructure section, the scripts detailed which endpoints\nare currently hosting the malicious cryptojacking files.\n\nFigure 15. Establishing command and control\n\n(C2).\nAs can be seen in Figure 15, there are hardcoded links within the newdat.sh script that point to URL addresses and identify\nthe miner binary, the configuration files, the scanning binary and the WatchDog process – and even another version of the\ninitial script itself. This could allow the actors to update the active miners in near realtime.\n\nEach of these binaries will be investigated in the following sections. First up is the Go language scanning binary,\nnetworkmanager.\n\n**networkmanager**\n\nThe networkmanager binary is a UPX-compressed Go language binary designed to scan networks and, when a vulnerable\ntarget is identified, attempt to compromise that identified system using a robust set of built-in application exploits.\nResearchers have identified two different file names used by the actors to name their binaries that perform the same\nscanning and exploitation function. Those names are networkmanager and networkservice.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile scanning operations are initiated via the newdat.sh bash script detailed above, the scanner binary will perform the\nactual scanning and exploitation operations. The WatchDog scanning binary uses a file composed of 60,634 individual\nChinese IP net ranges, which is downloaded during the system detection phase of the networkmanager binary. Within the Go\nbinary’s main initialization function, sym.go.main.ipc.download_ipdb, the networkmanager binary requests and then\ndownloads one of two possible IP address netrange files:\n\nhttp://83.97.20[.]90/cccf67356/ip_cn.txt\n\nhttp://83.97.20[.]90/cccf67356/ips_cn.txt\n\nThe IP address net ranges were stored in binary format and upon conversion to ASCII revealed the targeted IP address net\nranges (see Figure 16).\n\nFigure 16. An example of the ip_cn.txt Chinese net ranges.\n\nUnit 42 researchers downloaded these files, and at the time of their download, both of the files appear to contain the same\ncontent, as they both have the same SHA-256 hash,\nad3efb9bfd49c379a002532f43cc4867a4f0b1cd52b6f438bb7a8feb8833b8f8. These two identical files will be used by the\npnscan or masscan processes to scan the network ranges for potential victims.\n\nAt the time of their download for this blog, these two files only appear to contain Chinese-related IP addresses. It is likely the\nactors behind WatchDog are able to update the binaries to include any number of IP address network ranges they wish to\ntarget. This is likely the case as Unit 42 researchers have identified victims of the WatchDog miner operating outside of the\nChina IP address space, specifically within the United States and Europe.\n\nContinuing on, loaded within the networkmanager Go binary are 33 individual exploits functions, 32 individual remote code\nexecution (RCE) functions and several shell grab functions (see Figure 17).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Exploits loaded into the\n\nnetworkmanager binary.\nThe following applications are specifically targeted within the scanning binary:\n\nCCTV exploit\n\nIt is currently unknown if the target is a CCTV appliance or if there is another moniker “cctv” could stand for.\nDrupal\n\nVersions 7 and 8.\nElasticsearch\n\nCVE-2015-1427 (Elasticsearch sandbox evasion – version before 1.3.8 and 1.4.x before 1.4.3)\nCVE-2014-3120 (Elasticsearch before 1.2)\nApache Hadoop\nPowerShell\n\nEncoded command-line operations.\nRedis\nSpring Data Commons\n\nCVE-2018-1273, versions prior to 1.13-1.13.10, 2.0-2.0.5\nSQL Server\n\n\n-----\n\nThinkPHP\n\nVersions 5.x, 5.10, 5.0.23\nOracle WebLogic Server\n\nCVE-2017-10271 – versions 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.1.0 and 12.2.1.2.0)\n\n[The reference to “tmp_0324_scan” has been witnessed before, within a May 19, 2019, blog post from the forum.90sec.com,](https://forum.90sec.com/t/topic/155)\na Chinese-language Information Security group. The 90sec blog highlights a deep dive of a cryptojacking exploitation event\ntargeting Apache Hadoop, Redis and ThinkPHP applications.\n\nOf note, the bash script highlighted within the blog follows the same formatting as the newinit.sh shell script used by the\nWatchDog miner (see Figure 18). Aside from the different filenames and IP addresses, the two formats are practically\nidentical.\n\nFigure 18. Similar script formatting between the 90sec blog and NewInit.sh.\nAdditionally, the references to “tmp/0324/scan” within the 90sec post are listed within the same format as witnessed within the\nnetworkmanager binary functions (see Figures 17 and 19).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Image of\n\nnetworkservices exploits pulled from the 90sec forum.\nIt is clear that the activity being monitored by 90sec on May 19, 2019, is the same cryptojacking malware family researchers\nare seeing today in the form of the WatchDog miner. Several similarities can be observed between the past and present\nforms of the malware, such as that the same exploits appear to be used. However, newer techniques have been developed\nand implemented within the more current version of WatchDog. Specifically, we see this in relation to the phpguard binary.\n\nAlso of note, the [denisenkom/go-mssqldb library is added to Go binary which allows for SQL DB functions to be accessible](https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb)\nthrough the Go Language, including remote connections, error handling, bulk operations, logging and data manipulation (see\nFigure 20).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. Loaded\n\nLibraries – Denisenkom mssql-db, Go-Civil and Redis.\n[The Go binary is also loaded with the Google Cloud library Go Civil to allow for the usage of a Gregorian calendar with](https://godoc.org/cloud.google.com/go/civil)\n[exactly 24-hour days, 60-minute hours, and 60-second minutes, as well as the Github Redis Go Library, allowing for Redis](https://github.com/go-redis/redis)\nservice control by the binary.\n\n**phpguard**\n\nPhpguard is a UPX-compressed Go language binary designed to protect the mining software during operation. It performs\nthe functions of monitoring system processes and scheduled tasks or CronJobs to ensure the mining software is running. Unit\n42 researchers have identified two different filenames for binaries that perform the same protective function, phpguard and\nsysguard.\n\nThrough the use of the custom Go library “tmp_0324_dog_platform” (see Figure 21), the Go binary is able to control the\nXMRig mining software in either Windows or NIX systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21. phpguard custom Go functions for miner control in Windows and NIX.\nAdditionally, the binary embeds the mining software within the relevant OS through scheduled tasks, as is the case in\nWindows systems (see Figure 22). This can also happen via CronJobs, as is the case with NIX systems (see Figure 23).\n\nFigure\n\n22. phpguard WIN Scheduled Task creation.\n\nFigure 23.\n\nphpguard NIX CronJob creation.\nThe binary will also continually crawl through each of the OS running processes to ensure that the mining process is running\n(see Figure 24).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24. phpguard\n\nprocess crawling cycle.\nThe binary is designed to ensure the mining process is protected. If this is a first run for the binary, it will set the new process\nfor protection. If the mining software has not been started, it will start the mining software. And if the software has yet to be\ndownloaded, the binary will begin the download process (see Figure 25).\n\nFigure 25. Setting protections for the mining\n\nprocess.\n\n**phpupdate**\n\nThe phpupdate process is the XMRig mining software used by the WatchDog miner. Unit 42 researchers have identified three\ndifferent filenames for binaries that perform the same mining operations, phpupdate, zzh and trace.\n\nThere is little to disclose about the WatchDog miner’s version of XMRig or its mining operations that is outside of known\nindustry mining software operations. It offers a fully configurable operational menu, allowing the user to specify the following\nmining attributes (see Figure 26):\n\nURL of the mining pool.\nMining algorithm (or the desired coin).\nUsername.\nPassword.\nProxy information.\nSending of a keep alive packet\nSize of packet, and more.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 26. The WatchDog miner’s configuration options.\nWhile the miner can be controlled by the phpguard Go binary, as was described within the section just prior, the mining\nsoftware can also be operated through direct user interaction.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe WatchDog mining operation has been in progress since at least Jan. 27, 2019, and has collected at least 209 Monero\nCryptoCoins (XMR), valued at least $32,056 USD. The WatchDog actors are using cloud-efficient cryptojacking malware,\nthrough the use of UPX-compressed Go language binaries, ensuring they are able to compromise both Windows and Linux\noperating systems – assuming those systems have the Go platform installed. At this time, the WatchDog mining infrastructure\nis known to include 18 IP addresses and seven domains. These malicious endpoints continue to host or have hosted at least\n125 URL addresses used to download the WatchDog mining toolkit. Additionally, the scanning and exploitation binary,\nnetworkmanager, is loaded with 33 unique exploits, including 32 RCE functions. The WatchDog mining operation is quite\nlarge, as at least 476 compromised systems are estimated to be mining at any given time.\n\nIt is clear that the WatchDog operators are skilled coders and have enjoyed a relative lack of attention regarding their mining\noperations. While there is currently no indication of additional cloud compromising activity at present (i.e. the capturing of\ncloud platform IAM credentials, access ID, or keys), there could be potential for further cloud account compromise. It is highly\nlikely these actors could find IAM-related information on the cloud systems they have already compromised, due to the root\nand administrative access acquired during the implantation of their cryptojacking software.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks Prisma Access is configured to detect each of WatchDog’s 18 IP addresses, seven domains and their](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/access)\nassociated URL addresses through PAN-OS.
