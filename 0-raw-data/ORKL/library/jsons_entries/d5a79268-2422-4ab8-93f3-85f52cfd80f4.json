McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.\n“Ransomware victims should know that coming forward to law enforcement as soon as\npossible after an attack can lead to significant results like those achieved in today’s multifaceted operation ”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe NetWalker action includes charges against a Canadian national in relation to NetWalker\nransomware attacks in which tens of millions of dollars were allegedly obtained, the seizure\nof approximately $454,530.19 in cryptocurrency from ransom payments, and the disablement\nof a dark web hidden resource used to communicate with NetWalker ransomware victims.\n\n“This action reflects the resolve of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida\nto target and disrupt sophisticated, international cybercrime schemes,” said U.S. Attorney\nMaria Chapa Lopez for the Middle District of Florida. “While these individuals believe they\noperate anonymously in the digital space, we have the skill and tenacity to identify and\nprosecute these actors to the full extent of the law and seize their criminal proceeds.”\n\nAccording to court documents, NetWalker operates as a so-called ransomware-as-a-service\nmodel, featuring “developers” and “affiliates.” Developers are responsible for creating and\nupdating the ransomware and making it available to affiliates. Affiliates are responsible for\nidentifying and attacking high-value victims with the ransomware, according to the affidavit.\nAfter a victim pays, developers and affiliates split the ransom.\n\n“This case illustrates the FBI’s capabilities and global partnerships in tracking ransomware\nattackers, unmasking them, and holding them accountable for their alleged criminal actions,”\nsaid Special Agent in Charge Michael F. McPherson of the FBI’s Tampa Field Office. “If you\nare a victim of ransomware, contact your local FBI field office or submit a tip to tips.fbi.gov.\n[You can also file a complaint with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov.”](http://www.ic3.gov/)\n\nSeizure page of dark web hidden resource used to communicate with NetWalker\nransomware victims.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, once a victim’s computer network is compromised and data is\nencrypted, actors that deploy NetWalker deliver a file, or ransom note, to the victim. Using\nTor, a computer network designed to facilitate anonymous communication over the internet,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe victim is then provided with the amount of ransom demanded and instructions for\npayment.\n\nActors that deploy NetWalker commonly gain unauthorized access to a victim’s computer\nnetwork days or weeks prior to the delivery of the ransom note. During this time, they\nsurreptitiously elevate their privileges within the network while spreading the ransomware\nfrom workstation to workstation. They then send the ransom note only once they are satisfied\nthat they have sufficiently infiltrated the victim’s network to extort payment, according to the\naffidavit.\n\nAccording to an indictment unsealed today, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins of Gatineau, a\nCanadian national, was charged in the Middle District of Florida. Vachon-Desjardins is\nalleged to have obtained at least over $27.6 million as a result of the offenses charged in the\nindictment.\n\nThe Justice Department further announced that on Jan. 10, law enforcement seized\napproximately $454,530.19 in cryptocurrency, which was comprised of ransom payments\nmade by victims of three separate NetWalker ransomware attacks.\n\nThis week, authorities in Bulgaria also seized a dark web hidden resource used by\nNetWalker ransomware affiliates to provide payment instructions and communicate with\nvictims. Visitors to the resource will now find a seizure banner that notifies them that it has\nbeen seized by law enforcement authorities.\n\nThe investigation was led by the FBI’s Tampa field office.\n\nTrial Attorneys S. Riane Harper and Brian Mund of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime\nand Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Carlton C. Gammons and\nSuzanne Nebesky of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida are\nprosecuting the case against Vachon-Desjardins.\n\nSubstantial assistance was provided by the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs. Additionally, the Bulgarian National Investigation Service and General Directorate\nCombating Organized Crime provided substantial assistance in the seizure of the dark web\nhidden resource.\n\nAn indictment is merely an allegation. A defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nAttachment(s):\n\n[Download NetWalker splash page](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1360856/download)\nTopic(s):\n\nCybercrime\n\n\n-----\n\nPress Release Number:\n\n21-96\n\n\n-----",
