But how can we know with certainty? And what connection does a\n\nDDoS and disk-wiping attack from July 4, 2009, have with WannaCry, one of the largest\n\ncyberattacks in the history of the cyber sphere?\n\nFrom the Mydoom variant Brambul to the more recent Fallchill, WannaCry, and the\n\ntargeting of cryptocurrency exchanges, we see a distinct timeline of attacks beginning\n\nfrom the moment North Korea entered the world stage as a significant threat actor.\n\nBad actors have a tendency to unwittingly leave fingerprints on their attacks, allowing\n\nresearchers to connect the dots between them. North Korean actors have left many of\n\nthese clues in their wake and throughout the evolution of their malware arsenal.\n\nThis post reflects months of research; in it we will highlight our code analysis illustrating\n\nkey similarities between samples attributed to the Democratic People’s Republic of\n\nKorea, a shared networking infrastructure, and other revealing data hidden within the\n\nbinaries. Together these puzzle pieces show the connections between the many attacks\nattributed to North Korea and categorize different tools used by specific teams of their\n\ncyber army.\n\n**Valuable context**\n\nThis article is too short to dig deeply into the history, politics, and economic changes of\n\nrecent years.

What can a nation do when legal\n\ninternational economics are denied? To survive, it must gain foreign currency for trading.\n\nOne of the oldest ways to do this is to join the worlds of gambling (casinos) and drugs. In\n\n2005, the United States wanted to shut down North Korean enterprises involved in illegal\n\noperations. They investigated a couple of banks in Asia that seemed to have ties with\n\nNorth Korea and operated as money laundering sites. One bank in particular is\n\ncontrolled by a billionaire gambling mogul who started a casino in Pyongyang and has\n\nclose ties to Pyongyang. That bank, based in Macau, came back into the picture during an\n\nattack on the SWIFT financial system of a bank in Vietnam in 2015. The Macau bank was\n\nlisted twice in the malware’s code as a recipient of stolen funds:\n\n\n[https://t.co/FLgQ6Vn4yc](https://t.co/FLgQ6Vn4yc)\n\n22 hours ago\n[Reply · Retweet · Favorite](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=1028071021235130368)\n\n\n[mcafee_labs](https://www.twitter.com/mcafee_labs)\n\nBad actors are exploiting\n\nconnected home devices to find\n\nnew innocent targets.

With targeted campaigns, an adversary must keep\n\nits tools undetected for as long as possible. By identifying reused code, we gain valuable\n\ninsights about the “ancestral relations” to known threat actors or other campaigns. Our\n\nresearch was heavily focused on this type of analysis.\n\nIn our years of investigating cyber threats, we have seen the DPRK conduct multiple\n\ncyber campaigns. In North Korea, hackers’ skills determine which cyber units they work\n\nfor. We are aware two major focuses of DPRK campaigns: one to raise money, and one to\n\npursue nationalist aims. The first workforce gathers money for the nation, even if that\n\nmeans committing cybercrime to hack into financial institutions, hijack gambling\n\nsessions, or sell pirated and cracked software. Unit 180 is responsible for illegally gaining\n\nforeign currency using hacking techniques. The second workforce operates larger\n\ncampaigns motivated by nationalism, gathering intelligence from other nations, and in\n\nsome cases disrupting rival states and military targets. Most of these actions are\nexecuted by Unit 121.\n\nWe focused in our research on the larger-scale nationalism-motivated campaigns, in\n\nwhich we discovered many overlaps in code reuse. We are highly confident that nation\nstate–sponsored groups were active in these efforts.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nWe created a timeline of most of the malware samples and noticeable campaigns that we\n\nexamined. We used primarily open-source blogs and papers to build this timeline and\n\nused the malware artifacts as a starting point of our research.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Timeline of malware and campaigns._\n\n**Analysis and observations**\n\nSimilarities\n\nDuring our research, we found many malware family names that are believed to be\nassociated with North Korea’s cyber operations. To better understand this threat actor\n\nand the similarities between the campaigns, we have used Intezer’s code similarity\n\ndetection engine to plot the links between a vast number of these malware families.\n\n\n-----\n\np y g\n\nsimilarity. In defining similarities, we take into account only unique code connections, and\n\ndisregard common code or libraries. This definition holds both for this graph and our\n\nentire research.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nthe attacks associated with North Korea. Our research included thousands of samples,\n\nmostly unclassified or uncategorized. This graph was plotted using a data set of only\nseveral hundred samples, so there might be more connections than displayed here.\n\nDeep technical analysis\n\nDuring our research, we came across many code similarities between North Korean\n\nbinaries that had not been seen before. Some of these attacks and malware have not\nbeen linked to one another, at least publicly. We will showcase four examples of reused\n\ncode that has been seen only in malware attributed to North Korea.\n\n1. Common SMB module\n\nThe first code example appeared in the server message block (SMB) module of WannaCry\n\nin 2017, Mydoom in 2009, Joanap, and DeltaAlfa. Further shared code across these\nfamilies is an AES library from CodeProject. These attacks have been attributed to\n\nLazarus; that means the group has reused code from at least 2009 to 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Code overlap of a Mydoom sample._\n\nIn the next screenshots we highlight the exact code block that reflects the SMB module\nwe found in campaigns other than WannaCry and Mydoom.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: An SMB module common to several attacks._\n\n[A lot has been written about WannaCry. As we analyze the code against our databases,](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/analysis-wannacry-ransomware/)\nwe can draw the following overview:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: WannaCry code comparison overview._\n\nFor our research we compared the three major variants of WannaCry. An early release,\n\ncalled a beta, from February 2017, one from April, and the infamous one that hit the\nworld in May.\n\n2. Common file mapping\n\nThe second e ample demonstrates code responsible for mapping a file and sing the\n\n\n-----\n\nKorea’s Group 123. NavRAT and the gambling DLL share more code, making them closer\n\nvariants.\n\n_Figure 7: Code overlap in a NavRAT sample._\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: File-mapping code_\n\n3. Unique net share\n\nThe third example, responsible for launching a cmd.exe with a net share, has been seen\n\nin 2009’s Brambul, also known as SierraBravo, as well as KorDllBot in 2011. These\n\nmalware families are also attributed to the Lazarus group.\n\n_Figure 9: Code overlap of a SierraBravo (Brambul) sample._\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: A code block reused in the malware families_ _Brambul/SierraBravo and KorDllBot._\n\n4. Operation Dark Hotel\n\nIn 2014, Kaspersky reported a more than seven-year campaign against Asian hotels, in\n\nwhich the adversaries used an arsenal of tools to break into the computers of hotel\n\nvisitors. Zero days and control servers were used, along with the malware family\nTapaoux, or DarkHotel, according to the report.\n\nWhile we examined the DPRK samples, we noticed a hit with the Dark Hotel samples in\n\nour collections. By going through the code, we noticed several pieces of code overlap and\nreuse, for example, with samples from Operation Troy.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: Code overlap in a Dark Hotel sample._\n\nIdentifying a group\n\nBy applying what we learned from our comparisons and code-block identifications, we\n\nuncovered possible new links between malware families and the groups using them.\n\nWith the different pieces of malware we have analyzed, we can illustrate the code reuse\n\nand sharing between the groups known to be affiliated with North Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nmalware families spotted over the years. Lazarus is a collective name for many DPRK\ncyber operations, and we clearly see links between malware families used in different\n\ncampaigns.\n\nThe malware (NavRAT, gambling, and Gold Dragon) possibly created by Group 123 are\nconnected to each other but are separate from those used by Lazarus. Although these\n\nare different units focusing on different areas, there seems to be a parallel structure in\n\nwhich they collaborate during certain campaigns.\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK**\n\nFrom our research of these malware samples, we can identify the following techniques\n\nused by the malware families:\n\n\n-----\n\ng y g\n\nIn 2018, we saw examples of campaigns in which attackers used PowerShell to download\nand execute these droppers. Once information has been sent to a control server, the\n\nadversary determines the next steps, which often include installing a remote access tool\n\nto enable lateral movement on the network and pursue the goals of the campaign.\n\n**Final words**\n\nSecurity vendors and researchers often use different names when speaking about the\n\nsame malware, group, or attack. This habit makes it challenging to group all the malware\nand campaigns. By taking a scientific approach, such as looking for code reuse, we can\n\ncategorize our findings. We believe our research will help the security community\n\norganize the current “mess” we face in relation to North Korean malware and campaigns.\n\nWe clearly saw a lot of code reuse over the many years of cyber campaigns we examined.\n\nThis indicates the North Koreans have groups with different skills and tools that execute\n\ntheir focused parts of cyber operations while also working in parallel when large\n\ncampaigns require a mix of skills and tools.\n\nWe found our months of research, data gathering, and analysis very satisfying. By\n\ncombining our skills, data, and technology, we were able to draw connections and reveal\n\nlinks that we had not seen before. The cybersecurity industry would greatly benefit from\nmore collaboration and sharing of information, and we hope that this effort between\n\nMcAfee and Intezer will inspire the community to work together more often.\n\n_The authors thank Costin Raiu for providing them with samples they did not have in their_\n_collections._\n\n\n-----\n\nGlenn Simpson, Gordon Fairclough, and Jay Solomon, “U.S. Probes Banks’ North Korea\n\nTies.” Wall Street Journal, last updated September 8, 2005.\n\nChristiaan Beek, “Attacks on SWIFT Banking system benefit from insider knowledge.”\n\nhttps://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/attacks-swift-banking-system\nbenefit-insider-knowledge/\n\nAtif Mushtaq, “DDOS Madness Continued…” https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat\nresearch/2009/07/ddos-madness-climax.html\n\nRyan Sherstobitoff and Jessica Saavedra-Morales, “Gold Dragon Widens Olympics\nMalware Attacks, Gains Permanent Presence on Victims’ Systems.”\n\nhttps://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/gold-dragon-widens-olympics\nmalware-attacks-gains-permanent-presence-on-victims-systems/\n\nAlex Drozhzhin, “Darkhotel: a spy campaign in luxury Asian hotels.”\n\n[https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/darkhotel-apt/6613/](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/darkhotel-apt/6613/)\n\nWarren Mercer, Paul Rascagneres, and Jungsoo An, “NavRAT Uses US-North Korea\nSummit As Decoy For Attacks In South Korea.”\n\n[https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/navrat.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/navrat.html)\n\nSergei Shevchenko and Adrian Nish, “Cyber Heist Attribution.”\n[https://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html](https://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html)\n\nMydoom code reuse report. https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/113ba80f-1680-43d7\nb287-cc62f3740fad\n\n\n-----\n\nSierraBravo code reuse report. https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/8da8104e-56e4\n49fd-ba24-82978bc1610c\n\nDark Hotel code reuse report. https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/c034e0fe-7825\n4f6d-b092-7c5ee693aff4\n\nKang Jang-ho, “A foreign currency earned with a virtual currency … What is the life of a\nNorth Korean hacker?” http://m.mtn.co.kr/news/news_view.php?\n\nmmn_idx=2018062517065863930#_enliple\n\nAwesome work by the team responsible for the “Operation Blockbuster”\n[report. https://www.operationblockbuster.com/resources/](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/resources/)\n\n[ Previous Article](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/cryptojacking-campaign-mikrotik-routers/) [Next Article ](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/5-tips-to-protect-your-iot-devices/)\n\n[ Categories: McAfee Labs](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/mcafee-labs/)\n\n[ Tags:  advanced persistent threats, Advanced Threat Research, cybersecurity, hacking](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/advanced-persistent-threats/)\n\n## Leave a reply\n\n\n-----\n\nAdd a comment...\n\n\nFacebook Comments Plugin\n\n## Leave a Comment\n\nComment\n\nName * Email *\n\nPlease enter an answer in digits:\n\n\nPost CommentPost Comment\n\n\n[About | Subscribe | Contact & Media Requests | Privacy Policy | Legal](https://www.mcafee.com/us/about-us.aspx)\n[](https://www.facebook.com/McAfee) [](https://www.youtube.com/user/McAfee)\n\n\n-----\n\nSearch \n\nBack\n\n[Business](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/business/)\n\n[Consumer](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/consumer/)\n\n[Executive Perspectives](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/executive-perspectives/)\n[McAfee Partners](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/mcafee-partners/)\n\n[McAfee Labs](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/mcafee-labs/)\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish\n\nFollow us\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/McAfee) [](https://twitter.com/McAfee) [](https://www.youtube.com/user/McAfee) [](https://plus.google.com/101523649521491717960) [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mcafee) [](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/feed/)\n\n[About](https://www.mcafee.com/us/about-us.aspx)\n\n[Subscribe](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/feed/)\n\n[Contact & Media Requests](https://www.mcafee.com/us/about/contact-us.aspx#ht=tab-publicrelations)\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://www.mcafee.com/common/privacy/english/index.htm)\n\n[Legal](https://www.mcafee.com/us/about/legal/legal-notices.aspx)\n\n© McAfee LLC\n\n|English|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----",
