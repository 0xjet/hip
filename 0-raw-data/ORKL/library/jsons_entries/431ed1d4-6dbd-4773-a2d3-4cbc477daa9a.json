There was no evidence of a disruptive\n[attack on any company’s industrial networks, German authorities said. The agencies did not](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/germany/)\nrespond to a request for comment.\n\nBerserk Bear is best known in the U.S. for a years-long campaign to collect data on U.S.\n[energy companies, which the Trump administration blamed on the](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A) [Russian government in](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/russia/)\n2018. It is one of a handful of hacking teams that Moscow can call on to spy on industrial\ncomputer networks, analysts say. Another group — known as Sandworm and believed to be\noperating on behalf of Russia’s [GRU military intelligence agency — gained notoriety for](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/gru/)\n[cutting off power in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/ukraine/)\n\nBerserk Bear is less conspicuous. They have used “waterholing,” or infecting websites and\nthen picking off high-value login credentials, to compromise the IT networks of critical\ninfrastructure companies in Europe and North America. In 2018, the hacking group\n“conducted extensive, worldwide reconnaissance across multiple sectors, including energy,\nmaritime and manufacturing,” and also targeted U.S. government organizations, according to\n[a report from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/crowdstrike/)\n\nThis is far from German firms’ first encounter with Berserk Bear. In 2018, the BSI — one of\n[Germany’s main cybersecurity agencies — also accused the hacking group of trying to](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-cyber-russia/german-intelligence-sees-russia-behind-hack-of-energy-firms-media-report-idUSKBN1JG2X2)\nbreach the IT networks of German energy and power companies.\n\n[Robert M. Lee, CEO of industrial cybersecurity company Dragos, said his analysts were](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/dragos/)\naware of the group’s history — and that of a related set of hackers his company calls\n“Allanite” — of targeting German and U.S. electric utilities.\n\n“They have been aggressive and targeted numerous utilities, including those in the\nU.S., over the last couple years,” Lee said. “To date, they haven’t shown the capability or\n[intent to disrupt [utilities’] operations. Given their focus on industrial control systems and wide](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/industrial-control-systems-ics/)\ntargeting, though, we continue to track them and report on them to the community.”\n\nSven Herpig, a cybersecurity expert with the German think tank SNV, welcomed the advisory\nand urged German companies to heed the warning. The memo has “concrete\nrecommendations of how to spot and protect against an intrusion” from Berserk Bear, he\nsaid.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to a request for comment on the\nGerman agencies’ report.\n\n\n-----",
