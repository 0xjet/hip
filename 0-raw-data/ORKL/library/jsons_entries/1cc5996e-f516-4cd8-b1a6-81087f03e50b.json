    "plain_text": "# North Korea: Intelligence Assessment 2022\n\n**[analyst1.com/digital-report/north-korea-2022-intelligence-assessment](https://analyst1.com/digital-report/north-korea-2022-intelligence-assessment)**\n\n## Intro\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the United States and Russia segregated Korea\ninto two parts divided at the 38th parallel forming what is known today as North and\nSouth Korea. The division has caused political tensions and created an adversarial\nculture. While the citizens of both nations share a history and heritage, their political\nand cultural views are very different. Initially, the United States heavily influenced the\ndevelopment of South Korea and its government, whereas the Soviet Union impacted\nNorth Korea.\n\nNorth Korea is under the control of Kim Jong-Un, a son of Kim Jong-Il, who is the\ndirect descendant of Kim Il-Sung, a former Soviet Union military officer. Kim Jong-Un\ntook control after his father died in 2011. However, Kim Jong-Un had a very different\nupbringing than his father. As a young adult, he spent several years outside North\nKorea studying Computer Science secretly at the International School of Bern,\nSwitzerland. While attending, Kim lived under a secret identity, posing as a student\nnamed “Pak Chol,” and used the cover story he was the son of a driver assigned to\nescort diplomats stationed at the North Korean Embassy, also located in Bern,\nSwitzerland.\n\nDespite his exposure to the world outside of North Korea, Kim Jong-Un followed in his\nfather’s footsteps and has continued to place military needs over that of the people of\nNorth Korea, who mostly live in poverty. Additionally, Kim [eliminates anyone he](https://www.foxnews.com/world/kim-jong-un-killed-uncle-half-brother-over-china-coup-plot-report-says)\nconsiders a threat to his dictatorship, including his own family. Kim’s father was\nprimarily concerned with building and strengthening his military through equipment\nand human capital. While Kim Jong-Un appears to consider military power his biggest\nstrength, he has gone about building it differently. Kim realized the power of a cyberarmy early into his dictatorship, likely influenced by his academic background, and\nbegan developing North Korea’s offensive cyber capabilities. Today, North Korea\ncontrols an advanced, sophisticated cyber army.\n\n## Purpose\n\nAnalyst1 produced this report to:\n\n1. Assess the cyber threat presented by North Korea by combining open-source\n\ninformation, cyber threat data, and our own analysis\n2. Detail recent changes and updates to North Korea’s military structure behind\n\ncyber attacks.\n3. Associate security vendor cover names and malware with each corresponding\n\nmilitary and government organization\n\n## Executive Findings\n\n\n-----\n\nNorth Korea has been under pressure by the United States and the United Nations to\ndenuclearize and terminate its nuclear weapons program. Sanctions against North\nKorea first began in 1950 when North Korea crossed the 38th parallel and invaded\nSouth Korea. Later, additional sanctions were put in place over North Korea’s nuclear\nprograms, which further restricted and isolated North Korea from the rest of the world.\nThe economy of North Korea, or lack thereof, is a direct result of the sanctions in\n[place. The economic pressure caused by sanctions intends to compel the North](https://heavy.com/news/2017/08/kim-jong-un-education-age-switzerland-degrees/)\nKorean government to cooperate.\n\nKim Jong-Un has lost faith in the previous leadership directing North Korea’s cyber\n[units, such as the RGB and its subordinate bureaus. The regime recently replaced](https://www.dailynk.com/english/kim-son-il-appointed-deputy-director-reconnaissance-general-bureau/)\nolder, more experienced leaders with younger, tech-savvy men. The regime selected\nthese men from North Korea’s top technical universities to strengthen its most\nsuccessful military weapon: cyberwarfare.\n\nFurther, through [support and alliances with China and Russia, North Korea has](https://www.forbes.com/sites/outofasia/2017/12/01/russia-is-now-providing-north-korea-with-internet-what-that-could-mean-for-cyber-warfare/?sh=777cacb2386b)\nincreased its military power and expanded its global influence through cyberwarfare.\nThe sanctions and restrictions in place motivate North Korea to continue its attacks\nagainst the United States and its allies. As long as North Korea can survive\neconomically, cyberattacks will continue.\n\n**Note: This report is based on open-source information. Much of the material**\ndetailed in this paper originates from defector interviews, academic,\ngovernment, and security vendor reporting available in the public domain.\nHowever, we found some of these sources contradict one another with the\ninformation that exists today. To address this problem, we assessed the\ninformation and its source to determine what information is the most accurate\nand relevant today. For example, we accessed information from a defector with\nfirsthand knowledge to be more accurate than information presented in an\nacademic or scholarly paper.\n\nAdditionally, North Korea frequently updates its organizational structure and the\nmission of the units within. We believe we have put forth the most accurate\ninformation based on the available data; however, due to the nature of any\nopen-source information, caution should be used to make actionable decisions\nfor your organization. When in doubt, always conduct your own research and\nmake your own assessment to ensure accuracy by leveraging public\ninformation, such as this report.\n\n## Structure & Organization\n\nNorth Korea holds its military doctrine closely. Due to this, knowledge is sparse, and\nmany information gaps exist regarding the mission and structure of North Korea’s\ngovernment and military compared to most nations today. Further, North Korea\n\n\n-----\n\nfrequently updates both leadership and the mission of its directorates. Still, by\ncombining information from many resources, we believe the following information\ndepicts an accurate assessment of North Korea’s cyber units and their supporting\nelements.\n\nThe following diagram is a visualization of North Korea’s governing elements:\n\nFigure 1: North Korean government structure\nMuch of the information we used to map out the governing organizations and their role\nis derived from North Korea’s constitution, officially known as the “Socialist\nConstitution of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.” According to the\ndocument, North Korea’s government conducts all activities under the leadership of\nthe “Workers’ Party of Korea” (KWP), led by the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-Un.\nUnder the Workers’ Party, the State Affairs Commission plays a supervisory role\nover multiple bureaus, each of which has its own purpose and mission. While not all of\nthese state bodies will have a cyber function, understanding each will provide a\ngreater context in the “big picture” operations of how cyber is used and benefits the\nrest of North Korea’s governing body. Next, we will briefly describe each of these\norganizations and their purpose.\n\n**Cabinet of North Korea (aka “The Cabinet”) – The “administrative and**\nexecutive body of State power and an organ of overall State administration.”\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ministry of State Security – The Ministry of State Security (MSS) is**\nresponsible for counterintelligence services and reports directly to the supreme\nleader. The state security body also operates secret police actions/operations\nand facilitates the administration of concentration camps within North Korea.\nAccording to the “Human Rights Council,” North Korea is responsible for human\nrights violations. The report claims the Ministry of State Security is responsible\nfor conducting violations, including “torture, executions, enforced disappearance\nand political prison camps.”\n**[Ministry of Defence (aka “Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces”) –](https://www.38north.org/2018/07/mmadden070318/)**\nResponsible for “allocating material and human resources, administration, and\ndiplomacy with foreign militaries and defense ministries.” It also provides food,\nmedical, and structural management of North Korea’s military facilities.\n**Ministry of Social Security (aka “People’s Security Department”) – The**\n[Ministry of Social Security is the organization tasked to secure and](https://www.unikorea.go.kr/cms/getFile.do?file=2018012913454378143.pdf&orgname=north_korean_Leadership.pdf&mgmtId=MGMT_0000000754&siteId=SITE_00003&filePath=eng_unikorea/common/file/&count=Y#.pdf) [police North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Social_Security_(North_Korea))\nKorea’s government facilities, borders, and coastline. However, its most\nsignificant role is to monitor its own citizens using “local informers” to spy within\nvillage and town social communities across North Korea. When the Ministry\nidentifies citizens or groups conspiring against the regime, it takes action to\nsilence and eradicate the individuals. In some cases, if considered a political\nthreat, the Ministry of Social Security will hand over offenders to the Ministry of\nState Security, who, as stated earlier, is known to torture and kill North Korean\ncitizens.\n**Korean People’s Army (KPA) – As the name states,** this is the governing body\nof North Korea’s military. The KPA is [broken out into five elements: Ground](https://www.38north.org/2018/07/mmadden070318/)\nForce, Naval Force, Air Force, Strategic Rocket Force, and the Special\nOperations Force. Despite the term “Army” in its name, the KPA is North Korea’s\narmed forces, which encompass all of its military branches.\n**General Staff Department – North Korea’s General Staff Department (GSD)**\noversees all subordinate organizations within the (North) Korean People’s Army\n(KPA). The GSD provides direction and manages the service branches,\nincluding those responsible for cyberwarfare and cyber theft operations. The\nGSD provides leadership, dictates strategy, and sets the objectives for each\nsubordinate directorate/Bureau/Office. The most notable of these organizations\nis the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).\n\n## Reconnaissance General Bureau\n\n[Formerly known as Unit 586, the RGB is North Korea’s](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1367701/download) [premier military intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-korea-cyber-activity/)\nagency located in Pyongyang, North Korea. In 2009, North Korean leadership created\nthe RGB by [merging the Operations Bureau, Office 35, and the Reconnaissance](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20100427000663)\nbureau into one central entity as part of a massive restructure. The RGB conducts\n\n\n-----\n\n[cyberwarfare operations and employs nearly 7,000 trained hackers for espionage and](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/dprk-cyber-espionage.pdf)\nfinancial theft operations. The RGB structure includes several cyberwarfare units, as\nshown in Figure 2 below.\n\nFigure 2: Reconnaissance General Bureau unit structure\n\n[In mid-2020, North Korea appointed new leadership to the RGB as part of a personnel](https://www.dailynk.com/english/kim-son-il-appointed-deputy-director-reconnaissance-general-bureau/)\noverhaul designed to strengthen “the Workers’ Party’s chain of command over the\nRGB.” New personnel placed into key RGB leadership roles are younger, more\ntechnically skilled men in their “early to mid-30s.” Many are “Information Technology\nexperts” who graduated from North Korea’s top technical universities, such as “Kim IlSung University, Kim Chaek University of Technology, and Mirim University\n(Command Automation University).” The previous leaders volunteered to move into\nless relevant, obsolete roles, such as managing equipment and supply distribution\n[units. Under new leadership, North Korea hopes to increase its ability to use its cyber](http://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/151216_Cha_NorthKoreasCyberOperations_Web.pdf)\nassets to steal intelligence and foreign currency.\n\nTime will tell if youth and technology will further empower the RGB. However, the\nrecent personnel shuffle is not due to the RGB’s lack of success or technical ability.\nNext, we will discuss the subordinate units that make up the RGB and their mission.\n\n## Unit 121\n\n\n-----\n\nUnit 121, also known as the Cyber Warfare Guidance Unit, is the [elite cyber unit of](https://www.csis.org/analysis/north-korea%E2%80%99s-cyber-operations)\nthe RGB. Unit 121 [oversees several other military units, including Unit 180, Unit 91,](https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-cyber-army/4666459.html)\nLab 110, and its subordinate organizations. Unit 121 conducts cyberattacks to\nsabotage, deny service, and steal information from foreign nations. However, around\n2015, Unit 121 revised its goals, narrowing its operational scope to focus specifically\non hacking campaigns designed to disrupt adversarial nations’ critical infrastructure\nsuch as gas, power, transportation, aviation, etc., in addition to traditional cyber\nespionage. Many of its members are selected from the Pyongyang University of\nAutomation and [receive privileged treatment such as housing, food, and higher](https://www.vocativ.com/world/north-korea/unit-121-the-north-korea-hack-sony/index.html)\nsalaries for themselves and their family members.\n\nAs strange as it may sound, while its headquarters is located in Pyongyang, North\nKorea, service members from Unit 121 train and operate out of the basement of a\nrestaurant attached to the Chilbosan Hotel, a hotel in Shenyang, China. The hotel\nhouses North Korean hackers who train and use it to cover for their cyber operations.\n[The hotel is a joint venture between the two nations. In addition to room service, the](https://www.c4reports.org/dispatched)\nChilbosan hotel provides North Korea’s Unit 121 with the training they cannot obtain in\ntheir own country. This is how Unit 121 service members learn new hacking\nskills/techniques and conduct cyberwarfare operations.\n\n[Members of the Unit traveled to China in small teams, posing as businessmen using](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/06/asia/north-korea-hackers-shenyang/index.html)\nfake names and titles as cover. In the early 2000s, before North Korea had in-country\ninternet access, the hotel provided the regime with servers and network connectivity.\nBased on this and the continued cooperation with China, the two countries will likely\ncontinue to work collectively to target the United States and its allies. It is also worth\nnoting that the relationship between North Korea and the hotel became public\nknowledge in 2015. Due to this, we do not know if operations at the hotel will continue.\nIf not, it is highly likely that Unit 121 simply changed locations within China. Since the\ntwo nations have a strong relationship today, it is unlikely the joint program would\ncease operation.\n\n## Unit 91\n\n[Unit 91, also called Office 91, is located in the Mangkyungdae-district of Pyongyang,](https://www.afpc.org/uploads/documents/Cybersecurity%20Primer%20-%20March%202016%20(for%20web).pdf)\nNK, and “serves as the headquarters for hacking operations.” As part of its\n“headquarters” designator, [Unit 91 supplies equipment and mission-essential](https://ecci.utica.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Erlendson-Cohort-4-Draz-North-Korean-Strategic-Strategy-Combining-Conventional-Warfare-with-Asymmetrical-Effects-of-Cyber-Warfare-May-2013.pdf)\nresources to Lab 110 and its subordinate units. However, procurement is a problem\nfor North Korea since sanctions prevent international trade, including importing and\nexporting goods. Nevertheless, this has not stopped North Korea from obtaining\nmission-essential equipment necessary to facilitate its cyber operations through\n[Russia and China.](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44912)\n\nUnit 91 serves as the headquarters for hacking operations\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, Unit 91 illegally conducts business with foreign suppliers to evade\nsanctions. Since suppliers cannot legally sell their products to North Korea, Unit 91\nestablishes shell companies in China, Malaysia, and Russia to purchase essential\nequipment needed to support its cyberwarfare mission. Additionally, Unit 91 conducts\n[black market purchases to supplement their needs further.](https://www.northkoreatech.org/2011/06/02/defector-claims-up-to-3000-hackers-in-north-korea/)\n\nIn addition to acting as a headquarters element, Unit 91 also plays a significant\noperational role in supporting the RGB. Specifically, Unit 91 also conducts cyber\nespionage campaigns intended to steal technologies used to develop nuclear\nweapons. Previously, the unit [conducted cyberattacks against hydro and nuclear](https://www.heritage.org/asia/report/north-korean-cyberattacks-dangerous-and-evolving-threat)\npower organizations in South Korea.\n\n## Lab 110\n\n[Lab 110 is also known as the “110th Research Center” and the “Technology](https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/dprk/rgb-cyber.htm)\n**Reconnaissance Team” and is another arm of North Korea’s cyberwarfare program.**\nLab 110 is responsible for sabotage attacks involving destructive wiper malware,\ndenial of service attacks against media and financial institutions across South Korea.\n[Additionally, Lab 110 previously conducted financial attacks against banks globally.](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/dprk-cyber-espionage.pdf)\nOne of the [most notable attacks was the DarkSeoul campaign, which destroyed](https://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/31524/tracing-lineage-darkseoul/126346)\nthousands of financial systems in 2013 and resulted in outages at the top three\ntelevision/media companies in South Korea. Lab 110 also conducted several highprofile attacks against the Republic of Korea (ROK) (aka South Korean Army) and\nstole “confidential defence strategy plans” detailing response and defense to North\nKorean attacks. Lab 110 infiltrated the ROK Third Army headquarters operational\nnetwork in a later operation and stole chemical defense/response-related documents.\n\nLab 110 is responsible for sabotage attacks involving wiper malware, DDoS\nattacks.\n\n[According to the US government, Lab 110 is also behind financial attacks designed to](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and)\ncompromise the SWIFT messaging system. SWIFT facilitates financial transaction\nmessages, such as approval and denial for pending transactions. The attacker would\n[infiltrate institutions and maintain a presence for as long a year to observe and learn](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1092091/download)\nthe bank’s processes and systems related to financial transactions. Then, Lab 110\nwould use custom malware to compromise the institution’s local instance of SWIFT\nand approve fraudulent transaction requests.\n\n[The most notable of these attacks took place against the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016.](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/27/479760450/north-korea-linked-to-81-million-bangladesh-bank-heist#:~:text=North%20Korea%20Linked%20To%20%2481%20Million%20Bangladesh%20Bank,FBI%20says%20was%20carried%20out%20by%20North%20Korea.)\nIn that attack, Lab 110 hackers made a spelling error in the fraudulent transaction\nrequest, resulting in its discovery. Still, attackers initially made off with $81 million of\nthe bank’s money, though it later recovered some of the funds in transit before\nreaching its final destination.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to these attacks, Lab 110 is also responsible for finding zero-day\nvulnerabilities and developing malware used in operations by other units within the\n[RGB. While based in Pyongyang, Lab 110 facilitates some of its operations through](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/43956/Park_washington_0250E_20149.pdf;jsessionid=514BE7588EEC663CE353DAABE9A87943?sequence=1)\nshell companies located in China and Russia designed to allow its personnel to work\noutside North Korea to provide cover for their operation.\n\nUnderstand that, unlike most RGB directorates, Lab 110 appears to have more than\none motivation (sabotage, financial gain, espionage, etc.). This is because Lab 110\nhas three of its own subordinate units: Office 98, Office 414, and Office 35. These\nunits support and execute some of the operations attributed to Lab 110. The\nattribution is not wrong; however, it can be misleading if the reporting units and their\nmissions are not understood. Luckily, we will discuss these subordinate units next.\n\n### Office 414 & Liaison Office 128\n\nBefore developing a strong cyberwarfare capability, North Korea obtained most of its\nintelligence from human sources. At that time, North Korea would send spies to live\nwithin the target nation, using false identities to collect or steal information and report\nback to the regime. Today, the regime relies heavily on cyber espionage to provide its\nintelligence-gathering capability. As a subordinate directorate to Lab 110, Office 414’s\nrole is to [provide “information on overseas government agencies, public agencies, and](https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_08_The-All-Purpose-Sword.pdf)\nprivate companies.” To accomplish this, Office 414 develops espionage networks and\nprograms to support the RGB mission.\n\nAdditionally, Office 414 [works directly with another North Korean military organization](https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_08_The-All-Purpose-Sword.pdf)\nnamed the Liaison **Office 128, which uses hacking resources to compromise foreign**\nintelligence services. It’s also worth noting there is an information gap as to the extent\nOffice 414 and Liaison Office 128 play. Historically, in North Korea, Liaison offices\nfocus more on counterintelligence and develop and maintain covert communication\nwith other North Korean units. This, however, does not fit with the information\navailable surrounding the Liaison office. Instead, both Office 414 and Liaison Office\n[128 appear to have a larger offensive mission within the RGB.](http://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/151216_Cha_NorthKoreasCyberOperations_Web.pdf)\n\n### Office 98\n\nDefectors have provided valuable information on the North Korean regime and its\nmilitary and government structure. For example, much of the information regarding\nNorth Korea's cyber programs we know today originates from Professor Kim HeungKwang, a former North Korean university professor. This information allows outside\nnations to better understand North Korea and its operations. Due to this, North Korea\ncreated Office 98, which is responsible for collecting information, accessing, and\nmonitoring North Korean defectors, including the foreign organizations/agencies that\n\n\n-----\n\nassist them. Office 98 relies on conducting cyber espionage operations similar to other\nUnits under the RGB; however, they are focused specifically on defector-associated\ntargets.\n\n## Third Floor Offices\n\n[Three Offices/Units share the third floor of the KWP Central Committee Office](https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/38north_SR_Bermudez2.pdf)\n[Complex building in Pyongyang, known as the “Third Floor Offices.” Strangely, at their](https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/kji-2/third-floor/)\ninception, these units had no official name. Instead, each was referred to by the room\nnumber from which it operated (Room 35, 38, and 39). Over time, Third Floor Offices\nofficially adapted their room number as their military unit/office designator. Today, the\nunits do not report to the same directorates within the regime but play a role in funding\nthe regime’s military/government programs and the Kim family itself. For years, the\nOffices worked together until 2009, when the first of several restructures took place.\nNext, we discuss each Office and its role.\n\n### Office 35\n\nOffice 35, the External Investigations and Intelligence Department, is responsible for\nintelligence collection and analysis. However, unlike other components of the RGB,\n[Office 35 collects information to produce internal briefings and reports to inform and](https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/kji-2/third-floor/)\n[advise senior leadership within the regime. Its mission focuses primarily on the ROK,](https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/dprk/rgb-cyber.htm)\nUnited States, Japan, and several nations across Europe. Based on the information\nprovided by a North Korean defector, Office 35 empowers a small but sophisticated\nand effective [hacking group that develops malware and hack tools to acquire](https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/dprk/rgb-cyber.htm)\ninformation on its targets used to build its intelligence reports. Beyond information\ngained from hacking campaigns, Office 35 also collects information from human and\nopen-source means to produce its reports.\n\n\n-----\n\nOffice 35 collects information to produce internal documents to inform and\nadvise senior leadership within the regime\n\nWhile not as prevalent, Office 35 also conducts operations motivated by financial gain.\nHowever, these attacks make up a small percentage of the activity seen by Office 35.\nWe believe this may be a secondary mission for Office 35 to generate profit to support\nand fund the tools and resources used in their primary mission.\n\n### Office 38\n\nThe [mission of Office 38 is to manage the Kim family finances. Office 38 operates](https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/38north_SR_Bermudez2.pdf)\nholding companies involved in both legitimate and illegitimate business throughout\nAsia to accomplish this. The holding companies allow the regime to acquire goods\nbanned under current sanctions, such as cars, boats, and entertainment devices\n(TVs, stereos, tablets, furniture, alcohol, etc.). The funds and goods go directly to the\nKim family to furnish homes and provide luxury otherwise absent in North Korea.\nSome of the funds managed by Office 38 also go to high-ranking North Korean\nmilitary/government members to show gratitude and award leadership. The gifts and\nlifestyle provided from funds managed by Office 38 help ensure their loyalty to the Kim\nfamily.\n\n### Office 39\n\nEstablished in 1974, Office 39 is responsible for laundering stolen money\nobtained by other offices within the regime. Office 39 works closely with Offices 35\n[and 38. Much of the funds laundered by Office 39 originate from cyber theft, fraud,](https://nkleadershipwatch.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/pub975.pdf)\nand the production and sale of illegal drugs, weapons, counterfeit currency, and other\nblack-market goods. Office 39 also orchestrates the operational structure and\nmovement of money, much of which is secretly laundered and dispersed through\nvarious financial resources and organizations globally. For example, Office 39 decides\nhow to covertly move goods into and out of North Korea necessary to launder money,\nensuring it evades detection from foreign nations adhering to the restrictions and\nsanctions in place.\n\nTo do this, Office 39 relies on its military vessels or transportation from ally nations\nsuch as Russia and China. Additionally, it organizes state-run companies and criminal\nenterprises to ensure the success of its operation. Finally, Office 39 [implements the](https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/kji-2/third-floor/)\n[financial distribution of funds based on budgeting decisions from North Korean](https://nkleadershipwatch.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/pub975.pdf)\nleadership once successful laundering takes place. As of 2019, Office 39 managed\nand laundered around $1 billion per year in stolen funds.\n\n## Unit 180\n\n\n-----\n\nSimply put, Unit 180 is the primary bureau responsible for stealing money. The\norganization conducts cyber operations, targeting foreign financial institutions. North\nKorea uses the revenue from Unit 180 campaigns to fund North Korean military\noperations, including nuclear weaponization. Like other RGB components, Unit 180\nutilizes graduates from its technical universities to populate its ranks, who often\noperate outside the North Korean border to circumvent its limited internet resources.\n[For example, in one operation named FASTCash by the US government, Unit 180](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-239a)\ncompromised ATMs across Asia and Africa to fraudulently steal money from bank\nATMs.\n\n[Many targeted banks used vulnerable AIX-based servers that Unit 180 exploited to](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/symantec-uncovers-north-korean-group-s-atm-attack-malware)\nintroduce malware that fraudulently approved transactions between the legitimate\nSWIFT-based payment switch and the ATM. In addition to conducting the cyberattack\nitself, someone needed to physically access the ATM to acquire the cash funds. Then,\nNorth Korea launders the stolen funds through an extensive money mule network\nonce collected. This is just one example of operations conducted by Unit 180 but\nprovides insight into the advanced planning and execution of their attacks.\n\n**Note: Because Unit 180 is the primary unit responsible for stealing money, we**\ndid not feel Lab 110’s attribution to the Bank of Bangladesh attack fit well based\non unit missions. However, since the information originated from the United\nStates government, with far more attribution resources than us or any security\nvendor, we left the attack under Lab 110. It is also possible the SWIFT-based\nattacks against banks previously fell under Lab 110 and shifted over time to Unit\n180. However, without additional evidence to support Lab 110 attributions, we\nfeel both Units should be accessed when evaluating bank attacks geared at\ncompromising SWIFT messaging.\n\nUnlike similar RGB organizations, not all Unit 180 recruits conduct hacking operations.\n[For example, in Dandong, China, Unit 180 sends teams of men to perform legitimate](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/26/the-incredible-rise-of-north-koreas-hacking-army)\nwork, such as website and mobile app design, game development, and similar\nsoftware-based services to generate profit for the regime. Regardless of their function,\neven legitimate work that financially benefits North Korea is illegal due to sanctions.\nFor this reason, similar to Unit 121, members of Unit 180 must travel to areas of\n[partnering nations, like China, Malaysia, and Russia, covertly.](https://china-underground.com/2017/05/21/unit-180/)\n\n**Note: The relationship between North Korea and Malaysia began to deteriorate**\nin 2017 due to several high-profile incidents resulting in the closing of\nembassies in both Malaysia and North Korea. Malaysia made attempts to mend\nthe relationship in 2020. However, the effort eventually failed due to a political\ncrisis leading to a change in party leadership within Malaysia. Due to this, it\nseems unlikely North Korea still uses Malaysia as a cover for its cyber\nprograms.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Unit 204\n\nUnit 204, also known as the “Enemy Secret Department Cyber Psychological\n[Warfare,” is comprised of nearly 100 trained cyber hackers. As their name indicates,](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/north-korea-cyber-attacks-new-asymmetrical-military-strategy/)\n[this unit conducts “cyber-psychological warfare.” Information on this unit is sparse, but](https://web.archive.org/web/20170908032714/https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/8e487165-a3ef-4ebc-83ce-0ddd7898e16a/The-Republic-of-Korea-s-Counter-asymmetric-Strateg)\naccording to previous defector reports, the unit stands up “pro-North websites,” which\nspread propaganda about South Korea and the United States while reinforcing North\n[Korean views. It is likely the unit also relies on social media to conduct its mission.](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/151216_Cha_NorthKoreasCyberOperations_Web.pdf)\n\n### Bureau 325\n\n[On January 3, 2021, North Korea activated Bureau 325, a new organization within its](https://www.dailynk.com/english/north-korean-leadership-orders-public-health-officials-focus-all-efforts-vaccine-acquisition/)\ncyber ranks. The new Bureau has a distinct mission from its peer cyber Units. Bureau\n325’s only mission is to steal COVID-19 vaccine research and data. The creation and\noperation of the unit demonstrate how important COVID research is to the regime.\nFurther, unlike all other cyber units that fall under the RGB, Bureau 325 reports\ndirectly to Kim Jong-Un.\n\nBureau 325s only mission is to steal Covid-19 vaccine research and data.\n\nBureau 325’s role in the effort is to use cyber means to infiltrate government,\npharmaceutical, and medical organizations to steal vaccine data. Once acquired, the\nNorth Korean Ministry of Public Health uses the data to create vaccines and\nmedications. If successful, the measure allows North Korea to bypass the time and\ncapital necessary to develop and test vaccines. Additionally, North Korea would no\nlonger need to rely on China to provide them with vaccines and medications related to\nCOVID.\n\nFurther, Kim Jong-Un’s sister, Kim Yo-Jong, oversees the regime’s non-cyber efforts\nfrom North Korea’s medical science and health-related organizations and updates the\n“supreme leader.” According to Daily NK, a news/media outlet focused on North\nKorea, “the (North Korean) Central Committee recently ordered the Ministry of Public\nHealth and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to focus all their abilities on securing vaccines,\n[even if that means putting aside other activities.”](https://www.dailynk.com/english/north-korean-leadership-orders-public-health-officials-focus-all-efforts-vaccine-acquisition/)\n\nTime will tell if Bureau 325 is successful. We also don’t know if Bureau 325 relies on\ntools, malware, and experienced personnel from existing units to accomplish its\nmission or if it develops and uses standalone cyber espionage resources. Based on\nthe priority and oversight of Bureau 325, we believe top hackers and resources will\ntransfer from other Bureaus/Units within the RGB to bring it up to speed and make it\noperationally effective as quickly as possible.\n\n## Foreign Support\n\n\n-----\n\n## China\n\nChina and North Korea have a long-standing relationship. Despite sanctions, China\n[provides North Korea with many resources, such as energy, fuel, food, and consumer](https://web.archive.org/web/20170422015038/http:/www.cfr.org/china/china-north-korea-relationship/p11097)\ngoods. More importantly, China [supplies North Korea with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_in_North_Korea#cite_note-29) [one of the two](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/11309882/Internet-in-North-Korea-everything-you-need-to-know.html) fiber optic\nlines that the regime relies on to connect to the global internet, in addition to\ntechnology hardware and other cyber resources. China also provides North Korea’s\nstate-run telecommunication company with the IP address range it depends on to\ntraverse the internet.\n\nAs described earlier, China also provides North Korea’s cyber units within the RGB\nwith training, technology, infrastructure, and cover for their cyber espionage and\nfinancial theft operations. A relationship with China is vital to North Korea. China\nshares a border with North Korea and is one of the regime’s few allies willing to trade\nand enable North Korea’s cyberwarfare program. Further, Huawei, a China-based\ntechnology and telecommunications company widely accused of enabling surveillance\n[for the Chinese government, helped North Korea develop its first commercial wireless](https://www.axios.com/defense-department-chinese-military-linked-companies-856b9315-48d2-4aec-b932-97b8f29a4d40.html)\n[communications network. Later, China assisted the regime in developing its own cell](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/world/asia/eric-schmidt-bill-richardson-north-korea.html)\nphone called the “Kimtongmu,” though other media outlets claim China secretly\nmanufactured the phones for North Korea. The development of a wireless\ncommunications network in conjunction with North Korean-branded cell phones helps\nthe regime stay relevant in today’s evolving tech world. By controlling both the\ncountry’s network and cell phones, North Korea can also control which citizens can\nobtain access to them.\n\n## Russia\n\n[Russia provides North Korea with its second point of internet access. The access](https://web.archive.org/web/20170425103523/https:/fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R41259.pdf)\neliminates the risk of having a single point of failure and dependency on China. The\nresource is significant since China could completely control the regime’s access to the\nrest of the digital world without it. Russia also provides North Korea with military\ntechnology and weapons such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and various\n[missile-related technologies. For example, North Korea](https://web.archive.org/web/20170425103523/https:/fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R41259.pdf) relies on Russia’s satellite\nnavigation system to launch and control the orbit of ballistic missiles. Without it, the\nregime would have to rely on US GPS technology and networks, allowing the US\ngovernment to hinder or even sabotage the regime’s program.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther, Russia and North Korea have discussed jointly building a gas pipeline\nthrough North Korea. Russia could leverage the pipeline to generate billions in profit\nby supplying gas to South Korea. Additionally, in 2015, Russia and the regime\n[discussed building an electrical grid through North Korea. While North Korea would](https://carnegiemoscow.org/commentary/82892)\nshare profit from both endeavors, it is doubtful South Korea would ever welcome the\nresources due to its long-standing conflict with the north. This is likely why neither\neffort came to fruition.\n\n## Technologies\n\nIn addition to North Korean cell phones, the regime also has its own operating system\nused by the government and military, called Red Star OS.\n\n## Operating System\n\n**Red Star OS (aka Pulgunbyol) is the operating system created by the North Korean**\ntechnology research center, the Korea Computer Center (KCC). The KCC created\nversion 1 in 2008 and incrementally updated it through version 4, which they began\nusing in January 2019. Red Star OS is based on Linux, though the first versions\nvisually mimicked Windows XP, and later versions looked similar to Apple’s OSX\noperating system.\n\n[The KCC also created a custom browser to traverse the internet called Naenara, built](https://www.visitthedprk.org/made-in-north-korea-naenara-browser/)\non open-source Firefox code. The browser comes configured to use “Sam heug,”\n[North Korea’s search engine developed using Chromium open-source code. By using](https://digitaledition.baltimoresun.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=2d94be07-81fe-47cc-9e54-3e724298de8c)\ntheir own intranet, operating system, and search engine, North Korea adds several\n\n\n-----\n\nlayers of security between their data and the rest of the world. This provides additional\nsafeguards to help keep out foreign intelligence agencies; however, it also limits North\nKorea’s access to resources the global internet provides.\n\nAnalyst1 obtained a copy of Red Star OS to explore while conducting research for this\nreport. The Figures below display the Red Star OS login page, desktop, and the\nNaenara browser:\n\nFigure 3: Red Star OS login\n\nscreen\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Red Star OS desktop\n\nFigure 5: Naenara web browser configured to use 10.76.1.11, which is the address\nused to host North Korea’s search engine\n\n## Internet\n\n[Internet access is limited in North Korea and only available for official](https://www.northkoreatech.org/2011/06/26/north-koreas-chinese-ip-addresses/)\ngovernment/military business and a select demographic of high-level leadership\nofficials. Due to limited internet access, North Korea created its own intranet, known\nas “Kwangmyong,” which, with a few exceptions, is disconnected from the global\ninternet. North Korea’s intranet allows the regime to use private state-controlled\nwebsites and resources available within the country itself. This may sound limited,\nwhich it is, but using an intranet network allows the regime to share resources and\ncontrol the content available within North Korea. The Kwangmyong intranet also\nmakes it difficult for foreign adversaries to access or disrupt its connectivity since it\ndoes not rely on outside internet access.\n\nBeyond the Kwangmyong intranet, North Korea utilizes three other IP address ranges\nto allow their infrastructure to access the global internet.

At the start of this project, one of our initial goals was to\nidentify the cyber units within North Korea and map each vendor’s name to a specific\noffice or bureau.\n\n\n-----\n\nDoing so would be helpful since most vendors either do not map actual North Korean\norganizations to attack groups or attribute all activity to North Korea. At best, we see\nvendors attribute to the RGB or Unit 121. While not incorrect, the RGB and Unit 121\nare umbrella organizations with several subordinate units supporting their mission,\nmaking specific attribution less accurate. In another example, security vendors\nmapped all North Korean activity to the Lazarus group for many years. Fortunately,\nthis is evolving, and security vendors like FireEye, CrowdStrike, and several others\nhave begun mapping to “Lazarus subgroups.” Still, we are far from a one-to-one\nmapping for North Korea’s military cyberattack groups.\n\nDue to this, as we attempted to identify each cyber unit/office/bureau and its role\nwithin the North Korean regime, a lot of the attributed activity included attack attributes\nspread across multiple subordinate groups within the RGB and Unit 121. For that\nreason, we are not mapping out the groups to vendor names as it would cause more\nconfusion than clarity.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDue to many years of strict sanctions, North Korea is one of the poorest countries in\nthe world. While much of the population is starving, its government created one of the\nmost successful and dangerous cyber armies that exist today. The regime mastered\nturning something out of nothing and continues to defeat sanctions and come closer\nto becoming a global nuclear power. This is a massive accomplishment for a country\nwith two physical connections to the internet. Further, prior to 2014, many of us in the\ncybersecurity community incorrectly assessed the accurate threat level North Korea\npresented.\n\nWhile the US defense community has tracked and defended against North Korea\nheavily since at least 2009, it took the decimation of Sony Pictures Entertainment in\n2014 to get the attention of corporate America. However, if the Sony attacks were not\nenough, the 2017 WannaCry attacks certainly put the regime on the radar of most\norganizations globally. Today, outside of Sony and WannaCry, North Korea is most\nknown for conducting financial attacks.\n\n**Analyst1 assesses that North Korea will continue to conduct financial attacks**\n**and focus its resources heavily on cryptocurrency theft. While North Korea has**\nan elaborate portfolio of SWIFT-based bank and ATM attacks, recent attack\ncampaigns show the regime’s growing interest in cryptocurrency. Further,\ncryptocurrency is more difficult to track and easier to launder, making it more attractive\nto steal than traditional currency. The regime will continue to use the stolen proceeds\nto supplement the economic loss due to sanctions and fund its nuclear weapons\nprogram.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast, while we believe financial attacks are the primary motivator of North Korea,\n**espionage efforts, especially toward health and COVID-related targets, will not only**\n**continue but likely increase. Today, North Korea does not have the resources or**\nknow-how to research or develop advanced medication on its own. For this reason, it\nis highly likely that COVID research will continue to be a major priority for the regime.\nNorth Korea will continue to dedicate resources and money to cyber operations\ndesigned to steal COVID-related research and data.\n\nAnalyst1 offers organizations a more efficient method of gathering\nand enriching threat intelligence\n\n\n[Request Demo](https://analyst1.com/connect/request-demo)\n\n\n-----",
