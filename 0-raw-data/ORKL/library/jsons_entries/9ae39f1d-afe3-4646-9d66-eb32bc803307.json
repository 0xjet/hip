Of particular interest, is that this variant is now indicating\nthat the attackers are targeting entire networks rather than individual computers.\n\n[This variant was discovered by MalwareHunterTeam, who has noticed that the developers](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nare switching between different email addresses and slight variations in the extension.\n\nSigned & low detected (as usual), yesterday evening build of CryptoMix Clop\n[ransomware sample: https://t.co/20KMkc3S9X](https://t.co/20KMkc3S9X)\n\nAgain some changes in the note, and now it has 3 email addresses...\n\nAlso, new mutex and \"messages\" too.\n\n[@demonslay335](https://twitter.com/demonslay335?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\ncc [@VK_Intel](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/1wv5zJTRNB](https://t.co/1wv5zJTRNB)\n\n[— MalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam) February 26, 2019](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1100376870133161984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAs we are always looking for weaknesses, if you are a victim of this variant and decide to\n[pay the ransom, please send us the decryptor so we can take a look at it. You can also](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/submit-malware.php?channel=168)\ndiscuss or receive support for Cryptomix ransomware infections in our dedicated\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cryptomix Help & Support Topic.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/611907/cryptomix-or-crypmix-ransomware-help-topic-revenge-cryptoshield-extensions/)\n\n## The Clop CryptoMix Ransomware variant\n\nIt has been quite a while since we covered a new CryptoMix variant and some things have\nchanged since then.\n\nThis variant is currently being distributed using executables that have been code-signed\nwith a digital signature. Doing so makes the executable appear more legitimate and may\nhelp to bypass security software detections.\n\n[In an analysis by security researcher Vitali Kremez, when started this variant will first stop](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nnumerous Windows services and processes in order to disable antivirus software and close\nall files so that they are ready for encryption. Examples of processes that are shutdown\ninclude Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, BackupExec, and more.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sample of Stopped Services (Source:** **[Vitali Kremez Tweet)](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1100516315834535937)**\nAnother item noticed by BleepingComputer in this variant is that it will create a batch file\nnamed clearnetworkdns_11-22-33.bat that will be executed soon after the ransomware is\nlaunched. This batch file will disable Windows's automatic startup repair, remove shadow\nvolume copies, and then resize them in order to clear orphaned shadow volume copies.\n\n**Remove Shadow Volume Copies**\nThe ransomware will then begin to encrypt a victims files. When encrypting files it will\nappend the .Clop or .CIop extension to the encrypted file's name. For example, a test file\nencrypted by this variant has an encrypted file name of test.jpg.CIop.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypted CIop Files**\nThis variant will also create a ransom note named CIopReadMe.txt that is now indicating\nthat they are targeting an entire network rather than an individual computer. Whether this is\ntrue or not is not known at this time, as the ransomware itself does not have the ability to\nself-propagate, but could be done manually if the attackers are hacking into Remote\nDesktop Services.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransom Note**\nThis ransom note also contain the emails\n**unlock@eqaltech.su, unlock@royalmail.su, and kensgilbomet@protonmail.com that**\ncan be used to contact the attackers for payment instructions.\n\nUnfortunately, at this time the ransomware cannot be decrypted for free. You can receive\nsupport or discuss Cryptomix ransomware infections in our dedicated Cryptomix Help &\nSupport Topic.\n\n## How to protect yourself from the Ransomware\n\nIn order to protect yourself from ransomware it is important that you use good computing\nhabits and security software. The most important step is to always have a reliable and\ntested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such as a\nransomware attack.\n\nYou should also make sure that you do not have any computers running remote desktop\nservices connected directly to the Internet. Instead place computers running remote\ndesktop behind VPNs so that they are only accessible to those who have VPN accounts on\nyour network.\n\n\n-----\n\nA good security software solution that incorporates behavioral detections to combat\nransomware and not just use signature detections or heuristics is important as well. For\nexample, [Emsisoft Anti-Malware and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/emsisoft-anti-malware/) [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/)\ndetection that can prevent many, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a\ncomputer.\n\nLast, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many\ncases are the most important steps of all:\n\nBackup, Backup, Backup!\nDo not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.\nDo not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,\n[Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload)\nDo not connect Remote Desktop Services directly to the Internet. Instead, make sure\nthey can only be accessed by logging into a VPN first.\nMake sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make\nsure you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older\nprograms contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware\ndistributors. Therefore it is important to keep them updated.\nMake sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral\ndetections or white list technology. White listing can be a pain to train, but if your\nwilling to stock with it, could have the biggest payoffs.\nUse hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.\n**BACKUP!**\n\nFor a complete guide on ransomware protection, you visit our How to Protect and Harden a\nComputer against Ransomware article.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Clop Ransomware Hashes:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n2ceeedd2f389c6118b4e0a02a535ebb142d81d35f38cab9a3099b915b5c274cb\na867deb1578088d066941c40e598e4523ab5fd6c3327d3afb951073bee59fb02\n\n### Filenames associated with the Clop Cryptomix Variant:\nCIopReadMe.txt\n\n Clop Ransom Note Text:\n------------------------Your networks has been penetrated-------------------------------------All files on each host in the networks have been encrypted with a strong algorithm.\nBackups were either encrypted or deleted or backup disks were formatted.\nShadow copies also removed, so F-8 or any other methods may damage encrypted data\nbut not recover.\nWe exclusively have decryption software for your situation.\n===No DECRYPTION software is AVAILABLE in the PUBLIC===\n- DO NOT RENAME OR MOVE the encrypted and readme files.\n========================DO NOT RESET OR SHUTDOWN – FILES MAY BE\nDAMAGED========================\n========================DO NOT RESET OR SHUTDOWN – FILES MAY BE\nDAMAGED========================\n========================DO NOT RESET OR SHUTDOWN – FILES MAY BE\nDAMAGED========================\n---THIS MAY LEAD TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF RECOVERY OF THE CERTAIN FILES-----ALL REPAIR TOOLS ARE USELESS AND CAN DESTROY YOUR FILES IRREVERSIBLY--If you want to restore your files write to email.\n[CONTACTS ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SHEET] and attach 4-6 encrypted files!\n[Less than 7 Mb each, non-archived and your files should not contain valuable\ninformation!!!\n[Databases,large excel sheets, backups etc...]]!!!\n***You will receive decrypted samples and our conditions how to get the decoder***\n*^*ATTENTION*^*\n=YOUR WARRANTY - DECRYPTED SAMPLES=\n-=-DO NOT TRY TO DECRYPT YOUR DATA USING THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE-=-=-WE DONT NEED YOUR FILES AND YOUR INFORMATION-=CONTACTS E-MAILS: \nunlock@eqaltech.su\nAND\nunlock@royalmail.su\nOR\nkensgilbomet@protonmail.com\n_-_ATTENTION_-_\nIn the letter, type your company name and site!\n***The final price depends on how fast you write to us***\n^_*Nothing personal just business^_* CLOP^_--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Emails Associated with the Clop Ransomware:\n```\nunlock@eqaltech.su\nunlock@royalmail.su\nkensgilbomet@protonmail.com\n\n Embedded Public key:\n-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC01RzGfT2wX535F129PXlD5Z1n\n2O8qkkrmrg/vADiRjD7qDmYyk4rqMJZ54n/4HiyheDOX/svnCBqxrNZKJMJ3D2ho\n/yxjUFUlzpRDngNVCMMQfrqEyEZNBeKdYgdZqbPqEn26SQ+ucVzvyIRWdRBS4MMm\nNmC3la0g54+CesAv1QIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY----\n```\n[Clop](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/clop/)\n[CryptoMix](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cryptomix/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
