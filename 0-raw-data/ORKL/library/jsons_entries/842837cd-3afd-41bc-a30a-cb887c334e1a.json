We will continue to monitor the situation, but so far this is good\nnews.\n\nWe should also start to put last week’s wave of attacks into context. Why was it important to\ndisclose these attacks? What is the significance of these attacks? And what do we think\nshould be done?\n\n\n-----\n\nAt Microsoft, we receive more than eight trillion signals every day from our network. Our\nexpert cybersleuths use advanced technology and deep experience to comb this data for\nsigns of attacks so that we can notify and protect our customers. We also share information\nabout attacks we discover with the public so that others in government and the private sector\ncan take steps to defend against adversaries and so that policymakers can be well informed.\n\nLast week’s phishing attacks were important to disclose because they were evidence of a\nnew campaign by a sophisticated adversary. We saw and shared publicly Nobelium’s\nextensive experimentation in the early stages of its campaign – experiments consistent with\nNobelium’s established practice to avoid detection and remain persistent in victim networks.\nWe wanted the defender community in government and in the private sector to have this\n[technical information as soon as possible. Our disclosure has already yielded benefits as](https://twitter.com/CISAgov/status/1398648435809652742)\nCISA, the U.S. agency most responsible for our civil cyberdefense, used our information to\nidentify and help protect more potential victims.\n\nBut not every attack is the same, and so not every attack requires the same response. Last\nweek’s phishing attacks were a far cry from the ransomware attacks that, in recent years,\nhave shut down local government agencies across the U.S., interrupted health care and,\nmost recently, stopped the flow of oil in the Colonial Pipeline.\n\nSo how, then, should government respond to last week’s attacks? Some argue that\ngovernments have engaged in espionage against one another for millennia and will continue\nto do so in the internet age. They say that last week’s phishing attacks were “espionage as\nusual” and therefore do not necessitate any significant governmental response. Let’s\nexamine this statement, with which we largely agree, by comparing this past week’s phishing\nto Nobelium’s SolarWinds attacks last year.\n\nThe SolarWinds attacks were also called “espionage as usual” by some. We disagree. The\nSolarWinds attacks can be distinguished from expected espionage in two important ways.\nFirst, the attack corrupted and used the SolarWinds software update process. Online\nupdates are how all vendors keep their customers secure and must be trusted. Using\nupdates for malign purposes destroys that trust and risks the security of the entire digital\necosystem. In addition, the SolarWinds attacks were indiscriminate. Although malware that\nopened backdoors for the attacker was installed in more than 18,000 networks, the U.S.\ngovernment has found only about 100 victims that had those backdoors actually used for\nespionage purposes. This overbroad and indiscriminate attack caused business disruption\nand imposed significant expense on 18,000 organizations and enterprises needlessly. This is\nnot “espionage as usual.” Last week’s phishing attacks, in contrast, were focused on\nespionage targets and did not corrupt a core process essential to the security of the digital\necosystem. And, due in part to being caught early and good defensive technology, last\nweek’s attacks were mostly unsuccessful.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore impactful nation-state attacks continue to occur, however. With SolarWinds, the\nExchange Server attacks from early this year and now this phishing attack, it is clear we\nmust accelerate the work underway by the private sector and government to address our\ncollective cybersecurity.\n\nFirst, we must work to better defend. The best defense is to move to the cloud, where the\nmost secure technology from any cloud provider is always up to date, and where the fastest\nsecurity innovations are occurring. All users should also employ two-factor authentication\nand other basic cybersecurity hygiene. The Biden Administration has taken an important step\nforward toward advancing our defense in issuing the recent Cybersecurity Executive Order.\nThat EO, which will require strong collaboration between the public and private sectors to\nfully implement, will significantly improve the security of government agencies and the\ntechnology ecosystem broadly. The EO is a reflection of this Administration’s unprecedented\ncommitment to cybersecurity. During the Hafnium/Exchange Server attacks earlier this year,\nthe White House also led the formation of both an informal task force and a formal Unified\nCoordination Group that included, for the first time, the private sector together with\ngovernment agencies, creating coordinated efforts that resulted in only minor impacts from\nthose attacks. We need to continue to work collectively to improve our defense.\n\nSecond, we must work to deter damaging attacks. Again, this Administration has already\ntaken important steps. It attributed SolarWinds to the Russian SVR intelligence agency more\nrapidly than the U.S. has ever previously publicly attributed a cyberattack to a foreign nation.\nIt also imposed sanctions for that and other actions – a step essential to deterrence. Yes,\nmore will need to be done. Clearer rules for nation-state conduct need to be defined and\nagreed to by the international community, and clear and expected sanctions should be\ncommunicated for violation of those rules. For example, what exactly is the “espionage as\nusual” that should be tolerated, and when is this line crossed? Progress is being made\nthrough the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, established in 2018, which we\nhope the U.S. will now join. Recent United Nations processes are also resulting in consensus\nreports that will further the international effort to define these rules, and the Oxford Process\nhas convened the world’s leading international law experts to define how international law\napplies to cyberspace. These are all encouraging steps.\n\nProgress must continue. At Microsoft we will continue our efforts across all these issues and\nwill continue to work across the private sector, with the Administration and with all other\ninterested governments to make this progress. Achieving stability will take time and work, but\nit will be time well spent.\n\nTags: [cyberattacks,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberattacks/) [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [malware,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/malware/) [Nobelium,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/nobelium/) [phishing,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/phishing/) [SolarWinds](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/solarwinds/)\n\n\n-----",
