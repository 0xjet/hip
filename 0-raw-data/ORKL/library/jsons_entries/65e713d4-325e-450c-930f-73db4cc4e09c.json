But infamous ransomware hunter Fabian](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/)\n[Wosar (@fwosar), of Emsisoft begged to differ.](https://twitter.com/fwosar)\n\nThe amount of people that are thinking this was done by a disgruntled gamer is\nlaughable. Judging by the ransom note that was shared, this was done by a\nransomware group we track as \"HelloKitty\". This has nothing to do with disgruntled\n[gamers and is just your average ransomware. https://t.co/RYJOxWc5mZ](https://t.co/RYJOxWc5mZ)\n\n— Fabian Wosar (@fwosar) [February 9, 2021](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1359167108727332868?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Although what he said was an informed claim, we cannot say for sure what hit CDPR until a](https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/37783/hellokitty-ransomware-group-likely-responsible-for-cd-projekt-attack-heres-why/)\nransomware sample is retrieved and analyzed. Nevertheless, the name-check was enough\nto put the HelloKitty ransomware family in the headlines.\n\n## HelloKitty ransomware\n\nThe HelloKitty ransomware, also known as Kitty ransomware, was first seen in November\n2020, a few months after the first variants of [Egregor were spotted in the wild.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2020/12/threat-profile-egregor-ransomware-is-making-a-name-for-itself/)\n\nCEMIG (Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais), a Brazilian electric power company,\nrevealed on Facebook in late December 2020 that it was a victim of a cyberattack.\nSucceeding reports revealed that HelloKitty was the ransomware behind it, and that this\n[ransomware strain was used to steal a large amount of data about the company. The attack](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=90afa378-f082-4c05-904b-5a7371687eb1#:~:text=In%20December%20of%20last%20year,amount%20of%20the%20company's%20data.)\ndidn’t cause any damage, however, but it caused the company to suspend its WhatsApp and\nSMS channels, and its online app service.\n\nThis ransomware family was named after a mutex it used called “HelloKittyMutex.”\n\nSome researchers refer to HelloKitty as DeathRansom—a ransomware family that, based on\nits earlier variants, merely renames target files and doesn’t encrypt them. We speculate,\nhowever, that HelloKitty was built from DeathRansom. As such, Malwarebytes detects this\nransomware as Ransom.DeathRansom.\n\nThe threat actors behind HelloKitty ransomware aren’t as active as some other threat\ngroups, so there is little information about it. Below is what we know so far.\n\n**Infection vector**\n\n[According to SentinelLabs, current intelligence suggests that HelloKitty arrives via phishing](https://labs.sentinelone.com/hellokitty-ransomware-lacks-stealth-but-still-strikes-home/)\nemails or via secondary infection from an initial malware attack.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n\n-----\n\nHelloKitty ransom note\nSystems affected by HelloKitty ransomware display the following symptoms:\n\n**1. Terminated processes and Windows services. Once it reaches an affected system and**\nexecutes, HelloKitty terminates processes and Windows services that may interfere with its\noperation. These processes are generally associated with security software, backup\nsoftware, accounting software, email servers, and database servers (to name a few). Overall,\nit [can target and terminate over 1,400 processes and services.](https://cybleinc.com/2021/02/12/cd-projekt-red-gaming-studio-suffered-a-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[It performs the termination process using taskkill.exe and](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb491009(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) _[net.exe, two legitimate Microsoft](https://www.file.net/process/net.exe.html)_\nWindows programs.\n\nSentinelLabs also notes that if there are processes HelloKitty cannot terminate using these\nexecutables, it then taps into Windows’s [Restart Manager to perform the termination.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rstmgr/about-restart-manager)\n\n**2. Encrypted files with . KITTY or . CRYPTED file extensions. On Windows systems,**\nHelloKitty ransomware uses a combination of AES-128 + NTRU encryption. On Linux\nsystems, it uses the combination AES-256 + ECDH. These encryption recipes are not known\nto have any weaknesses, making decryption impossible without a key.\n\nEncrypted files will have the `.kitty or` `.crypted file extension appended to the file`\nnames. For example, an encrypted `sample.mdb file will either have the`\n```\nsample.mdb.kitty or sample.mdb.crypted file names.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**3. Targeted ransom note. The HelloKitty ransom note is usually a plain text file bearing**\neither the name `read_me_lkdtt.txt or` `read_me_unlock.txt that references its target`\nand/or its environment. For a sample content of the note, below is a portion of the CEMIG\nransom note as follows:\n\nHello CEMIG!\n\nAll your fileservers, HyperV infrastructure and backups have been encrypted!\n\nTrying to decrypt or modify the files with programs other than our decryptor can lead to\npermanent loss of data!\n\nThe only way to recover your files is by cooperating with us.\n\nTo prove our seriousness, we can decrypt 1 non-critical file for free as proof. We have\nover 10 TB data of your private files, databases, personal data… etc, you have 24\nhours to contact us, another way we publish this information in public channels, and\nthis site will be unavailable.\n\nThe ransom note also includes a `.onion URL that victims can open using the Tor browser.`\nURLs are different for each victim.\n\n**[4. Deleted shadow copies. Similar to other well-known ransomware families like Phobos](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2020/01/threat-spotlight-phobos-ransomware-lives-up-to-its-name/)**\n[and Sodinokibi, HelloKitty deletes shadow copies of encrypted files on affected systems to](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2019/07/threat-spotlight-sodinokibi-ransomware-attempts-to-fill-gandcrab-void/)\nprevent victims from restoring them.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**Tor Onion URLs:**\n\n6x7dp6h3w6q3ugjv4yv5gycj3femb24kysgry5b44hhgfwc5ml5qrdad.onion\nx6gjpqs4jjvgpfvhghdz2dk7be34emyzluimticj5s5fexf4wa65ngad.onion\n\n**SHA256 hashes:**\n\n78afe88dbfa9f7794037432db3975fa057eae3e4dc0f39bf19f2f04fa6e5c07c\nfa722d0667418d68c4935e1461010a8f730f02fa1f595ee68bd0768fd5d1f8bb\nc7d6719bbfb5baaadda498bf5ef49a3ada1d795b9ae4709074b0e3976968741e\n9a7daafc56300bd94ceef23eac56a0735b63ec6b9a7a409fb5a9b63efe1aa0b0\n38d9a71dc7b3c257e4bd0a536067ff91a500a49ece7036f9594b042dd0409339\n\n\n-----",
