Here is a blog post from Rahul Mohandas on a recent campaign:](https://blogs.mcafee.com/author/rahul-mohandas)\n\n[Stealthy Cyberespionage Campaign Attacks With Social Engineering](https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/stealthy-cyberespionage-campaign-attacks-with-social-engineering)\n\nCyberespionage attacks pose a challenge for the security industry as well as for the\norganizations trying to protect against them. Last year, McAfee Labs predicted that in 2015\nthese attacks would increase in frequency and become stealthier, and we have seen this\noccur. Cyberespionage aims at specific organization or sectors that are high-value targets,\nwith most attacks flying under the radar.\n\nThe McAfee Labs research team has tracked an advanced persistent threat for the past\ncouple of months. This group has evolved a lot in sophistication and evasion techniques to\ndefeat detection by security products. This group has been active since at least 2014 and\nuses spear-phishing campaigns to target enterprises. We have observed this group targeting\ndefense, aerospace, and legal sector companies.\n\n**The Attack**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe preceding email provides a clear indication that the attackers have researched their\ntarget and its employees. Social media sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook are\ngood sources of such valuable information, which can be used for social-engineering attacks.\n\nThe Excel attachment opens with a “password protected” window, tricking the victim into\nbelieving the file requires a password to display the content.\n\nThe Excel file is laced with a malicious macro that runs in the background. To prevent easy\ndetection, the macro is obfuscated using Base64. The Excel file drops an .hta file, which\ncontains the backdoor functionality.\n\nThis attack uses some novel techniques:\n\nA JavaScript backdoor component, unlike most exploits or malicious Office files, which\nuse an embedded or a direct download of a binary.\nThe JavaScript backdoor is obfuscated and dropped to\n%Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Protect\\CRED. It persists on the machine using a registry run\nentry created by the mshta application.\n\nThe launched window is hidden using the JavaScript command\n“window.moveTo(-100,-100), window.resizeTo(0,0).”\n\n**JavaScript backdoor capabilities**\n\nThe attack minimizes its footprint by running only a script, which has lower chance of being\nflagged as malicious. Some of the backdoor capabilities:\n\nQuerying system information using WMI.\nUsing a proxy server for connections.\nDownloading and executing remote files.\nUsing file/directory/network/process/registry and system operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Control servers**\n\nThe WMI queries collect system-related data. The following parameters are collected and\nBase64 encoded before posting to the control servers:\n\nHash of volume serial number\nComputer name\nIP address\nCurrent username\nOperating system\nProxy server\n\nThe JavaScript backdoor connects to a gateway that receives additional commands from the\nattacker. Some of the control servers:\n\nhxxp://humans.mooo[.]info/common[.]php\nhxxp://mines.port0[.]org/common[.]php\nhxxp://eholidays.mooo[.]com/common[.]php\n\nOne of the attacker’s first actions is to profile the infected host by executing commands that\ndisplay a list of domains, computers, or resources shared by the specified computer (using\nthe net view command). This is followed by gathering more information about the files on the\ndesktop and other drives. An attacker can use this information for further lateral movement.\nAll the data is posted to the control server as Base64-encoded data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection**\n\nDefending against these highly targeted social-engineering attacks involves a human\nelement. Although technical controls mitigate the risks, it’s imperative that organizations\nestablish policies to help employees spot suspicious events.\n\nMcAfee Advanced Threat Defense provides zero-day protection against this attack based on\nits behavior.\n\nThe following Yara rule detects the OLE attack vector:\n\nrule APT_OLE_JSRat\n\n{\nmeta:\n\nauthor = “Rahul Mohandas”\n\nDate = “2015-06-16″\n\nDescription = “Targeted attack using Excel/word documents”\n\nstrings:\n\n$header = {D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1}\n\n$key1 = “AAAAAAAAAA”\n\n$key2 = “Base64Str” nocase\n\n$key3 = “DeleteFile” nocase\n\n$key4 = “Scripting.FileSystemObject” nocase\n\ncondition:\n\n$header at 0 and (all of ($key*) )\n\n}\n\n_I thank my colleague Kumaraguru Velmurugan of the Advanced Threat Defense Group for_\n_his invaluable assistance._\n\nlocal_offer Tagged Items\n\n[intelsecurity](https://community.spiceworks.com/pages/intelsecurity)\n\n\n-----\n\n[McAfee.
