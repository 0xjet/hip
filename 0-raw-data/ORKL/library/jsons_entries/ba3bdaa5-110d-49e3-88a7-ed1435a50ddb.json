The University’s web site served repackaged content from\nthe [Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) with embedded JavaScript content maintaining](http://beefproject.com/)\nthe potential to hook visitors’ web browsers, identify visited websites and domains, explore\nfor vulnerabilities (we did not observe any auto-pwning), and provide tracking through\nevercookies. Even a partial listing of visited sites can be sensitive and valuable information,\nand this sort of “sites visited” data gathering via other techniques, like screengrabbing and\n[keylogging, were observed in past APT incidents like the Madi](https://securelist.com/the-madi-campaign-part-i-5/33693/) [campaigns. Currently, it’s](https://securelist.com/the-madi-campaign-part-ii/33701/)\nadvisable to avoid the site.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe embedded BeEF content appears not to be fully configured, and only partially\nimplemented. Perhaps a limited data set was of interest for this attacker, or this was an early\nattempt at deploying BeEF.\n\nThis incident is interesting because at the same time and a bit earlier, another group was\nheavily relying on repackaging open source offensive security product in their toolset by\ndeploying both BeEF and Metasploit-produced components across a select set of strategic\nweb compromises. This particular APT has years of low-tech elaborate social engineering\nschemes and re-purposed open source efforts under its belt.\n\nWhile we call them the NewsBeef APT, they have been reported in the past as Charming\nKitten or Newscaster in 2014, social engineering their way into sensitive circles of trust with\nspoofed LinkedIn profiles and phony news media organizations.\n\nThey continue to be highly active, but this time, they are using a slightly more technical\ntoolset. On one hand, they have developed skills or discovered tools to compromise select\nweb applications and sites, supporting their watering hole campaigns. On the other hand,\nthey have repackaged leaked bot source code and repackaged open source Metasploit and\nPowerSploit components to produce and administer backdoors and downloaders.\n\nNewsbeef/Newscaster will find a way to compromise a web site, usually the vulnerability\nappears to be CMS related, in an outdated WordPress plugin, Joomla version, or Drupal\nversion. Attackers usually perform one of two things, Newsbeef has been performing the first\nof the two:\n\ninject a src or iframe link into web pages or css sheets\ninject the content of an entire BeEF web page into one of the internally linked javascript\nhelpers\n\nThe injected link will redirect visitors’ browsers to a BeEF server. Usually, the attackers\ndeliver some of the tracking and system/browser identification and evercookie capabilities.\nSometimes, it appears that they deliver the metasploit integration to exploit and deliver\nbackdoors (we haven’t identified that exploitation activity in our ksn data related to this group\njust yet). Sometimes, it is used to pop up spoofed login input fields to steal social networking\n\n\n-----\n\nsite credentials. We also haven t detected that in ksn, but some partners have privately\nreported it about various incidents. But we have identified that attackers will redirect\nspecific targets to laced Adobe Flash and other installers from websites that they operate.\n\nSo, the watering hole activity isn’t always and usually isn’t delivering backdoors. Most of the\ntime, the watering hole injections are used to identify and track visitors or steal their browser\nhistory. Then, they deliver the backdoors to the right targets.\n\nIn addition to the University site and the NewsBeef APT, in the past couple of months, we\nidentified a variety of compromised sites around the world serving the BeEF. Most are\ncleaned up. Deployments to interesting and strategic web sites and their true reach on a\nglobal scale appears to be on the increase:\n\nMiddle eastern embassy in the Russian Federation\nIndian military technology school\nHigh conflict regional presidency\nUkrainian ICS Scanner mirror\nEuropean Union education diversification support agency\nRussian foreign trade management organization\nProgressive Kazakh news and politics media\nTurkish news organization\nSpecialized German music school\nJapanese textile manufacturing inspection corporate division\nMiddle Eastern social responsibility and philanthropy\nsurprisingly popular British “lifestyle” blog\nAlgerian University’s online course platform\nChinese construction group\nRussian overseas business development and holding company\nRussian gaming developer forum\nRomanian Steam gaming developer\nChinese online gaming virtual gold seller\nBrazilian music instrument retailer\n\n**BeEF Capabilities**\n\nKey to these incidents are the development, distribution, and ease of use of toolkits like\nBeEF.\n\n\n-----\n\nBeEF itself is an open source collection of tools and tricks, some years old, that combined\ntogether can effectively hook a visiting web browser for evaluation and full exploitation.\nBecause of its capabilities, we have seen increased adoption of the framework for the past\nyear or so.\n\nBrowser enumeration and reporting\nPlugin enumeration and reporting\nRetrieve visited domains (based on an old browser cache fetch timing trick)\nSocial engineering via live sessions and phishing within the browser\nNetwork exploration, discovery, and exfiltration tunneling\nMetasploit exploit integration and autopwning\nEvercookie deployment for persistent tracking – multiple platforms\nXSS evaluation and exploitation\n\nAt the same time, many of the techniques implemented are very old and public. The kit is\nextensible, customizable, and integrates with metasploit for autopwnage. Some of the\ntechniques were discussed during Jeremiah Grossman’s 2006 Black Hat conference\npresentation. The delay in deployment for techniques of this type indicates that some teams\nare dependent on open source tool packaging and ease of use. We have seen this sort of\nreliance on both open source offensive toolkits and legitimate software in the past from APT\n[like Crouching Yeti,](https://securelist.com/energetic-bear-more-like-a-crouching-yeti/65240/) [TeamSpy, and now the Newsbeef.](https://securelist.com/the-teamspy-crew-attacks-abusing-teamviewer-for-cyberespionage/35520/)\n\nFighting against the use of browser hooking frameworks for identification, tracking, live\nsession social engineering, and precision and auto-exploitation effectively requires a mix of\ntechnologies. When these JavaScript-based frameworks are used in a malicious manner, the\ncombination of network and host based detection is required to fully handle more\nserious incidents.\n\nUnfortunately, these incidents are on the increase. You can disable JavaScript in your own\nbrowser with NoScript, but that’s much like just moving to Lynx or a text-based browser –\npeople don’t want that because it kills functionality in the browser they do want. A Chrome\nplugin that detects the BeEF cookie is easily evaded by serious players. And preventing the\ntracking methods altogether is another whole ball of wax, because much of the functionality\nis tied into legitimate web pages by third party marketers and retailers.\n\nPreventing the social engineering sessions for credential theft and Metasploit exploit\nintegration makes immediate sense and can be incorporated at the network and more\neffectively at the host level. AntiAPT can help wipe out most of an operation on the network\nat scale, but these measures can be evaded as well. In other words, dealing with a\ndetermined attacker using tools like this one is difficult.\n\n**References**\n\n\n-----\n\n[NEWSCASTER – An Iranian Threat Inside Social Media](http://www.isightpartners.com/2014/05/newscaster-iranian-threat-inside-social-media/)\n[The Browser Exploitation Framework Project](http://beefproject.com/)\n[Metasploit: Penetration Testing Software](https://www.metasploit.com/)\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/cybercrime/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n[Website Hacks](https://securelist.com/tag/website-hacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nFreezer Paper around Free Meat\n\nYour email address will not be published.
