Below is an analysis of the](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nransomware's mode of operation, provided by MalwareHunterTeam and Bleeping\nComputer's Lawrence Abrams.\n\n## FireCrypt comes as a ransomware building kit\n\nMalware is usually generated by compiling it from source code, or by using automated\nsoftware that takes certain input parameters and outputs a customized malware payload on\na per-campaign basis.\n\nThe latter are known in the industry as malware builders and usually come as commandline applications or GUI-based tools.\n\nThe author of the FireCrypt ransomware uses a command-line application that automates\nthe process of putting FireCrypt samples together, allowing him to modify basic settings\nwithout having to tinker with bulky IDEs that compile its source code.\n\nFireCrypt's builder is named BleedGreen (seen below), and allows the FireCrypt author to\ngenerate a unique ransomware executable, give it a custom name, and use a personalized\nfile icon. Compared to other ransomware builders, this is a very low-end application. Similar\nbuilders usually allow crooks to customize a wider set of options, such as the Bitcoin\naddress where to receive payments, the ransom demand value, contact email address, and\nmore.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe builder's role, besides disguising an EXE file under a PDF or DOC icon, is also to\nslightly alter the ransomware's binary, in order to generate a file with a different hash at\nevery new compilation.\n\nThe technique is often used by malware developers to create so-called \"polymorphic\nmalware\" that's harder to detect by standard antivirus software. According to\nMalwareHunterTeam, \"the builder is very basic, so this shouldn't help anything against real\nAVs.\"\n\nNevertheless, this also tells us that FireCrypt author has at least some sort of experience in\ndeveloping malware, and isn't your regular script kiddie that downloaded open-source\nransomware from GitHub.\n\n## FireCrypt infection process\n\nThe FireCrypt infection process hinges on the ransomware's distributor's ability to trick\nusers in launching the EXE file they just generated.\n\nOnce this happens, FireCrypt will kill the computer's Task Manager (taskmgr.exe) and begin\nto encrypt a list of 20 file types. FireCrypt encrypts files with the AES-256 encryption\nalgorithm.\n\nAll encrypted files will have their original file name and extension appended with \".firecrypt\".\nFor example, a file named photo.png will be renamed into photo.png.firecrypt.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the file encryption process ends, FireCrypt drops its ransom note on the user's\nDesktop.\n\n\n-----\n\nFireCrypt ransom note\nThe ransom note is a nearly identical copy of the ransom note used by the Deadly for a\n[Good Purpose Ransomware, discovered on October 14 by the same MalwareHunterTeam.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-october-14-2016-exotic-lockydump-comrade-and-more/)\n\n\n-----\n\nDeadly for a Good Purpose Ransomware ransom note\nAt the time it was discovered in October 2016, the Deadly for a Good Purpose Ransomware\nappeared to be under development, as its source code would begin the file encryption\nprocess only if the victim's computer date were for a day in 2017 and later.\n\nCompared to FireCrypt, the only difference is that the Deadly for a Good Purpose\nRansomware also featured a logo at the top of the ransom note, now missing in FireCrypt.\nBut, at a close inspection of Deadly's source code, MalwareHunterTeam was able to\ndiscover that both ransomware versions used the same email and Bitcoin addresses,\nshowing a clear connection between the two, with FireCrypt being a rebranded version of\nthe original Deadly for a Good Purpose Ransomware.\n\n### The DDoS function that fills your hard drive with junk files\n\nAfter dropping the ransom note, FireCrypt doesn't stop its malicious behavior. Its source\ncode contains a function that continuously connects to a URL, downloads its content and\nsaves it to disk in a file in the %Temp% folder, named [random_chars]\n_[connect_number].html._\n\nIf users aren't aware of this function, FireCrypt will quickly fill the %Temp% folder up with\njunk files.\n\n\n-----\n\nCurrent versions of the FireCrypt ransomware will download the content of\n[http://www.pta.gov.pk/index.php, which is the official portal of Pakistan's Telecommunication](http://www.pta.gov.pk/index.php)\nAuthority. This URL cannot be modified using the ransomware's builder.\n\nFireCrypt DDoS function\nThe FireCrypt author calls this feature as a \"DDoSer,\" but this would be a stretch. The crook\nwould have to infect thousands of victims before launching a DDoS attack large enough to\ncause any problems to the Authority's website.\n\nFurthermore, all victims should be infected at the same time, and have their computers\nconnected to the Internet in order to participate in the DDoS attack.\n\nAt the time of writing, there's no known method of recovering files encrypted with FireCrypt.\nVictims infected with this threat that are unable or unwilling to pay the $500 ransom demand\nshould keep a copy of their encrypted files around, as a decrypter might be possibly\nreleased in the future.\n\n### Targeted file extensions:\n```\n.txt, .jpg, .png, .doc, .docx, .csv, .sql, .mdb, .sln, .php, .asp, .aspx, .html,\n.htm, .csx, .psd, .aep, .mp3, .pdf, .torrent\n\n Files associated with FireCrypt ransomware:\n%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\[random_chars].exe - Startup\nExecutable\n%Desktop%\\[random_chars]-READ_ME.html - Ransom Note\n%AppData%\\SysWin32\\files.txt - List of Encrypted Files\n%Desktop%\\random_chars]-filesencrypted.html - List of Encrypted Files\n%Temp%\\random_chars]-[connect_number].html - Files downloaded during the DDoS attack\n\n Hashes associated with the FireCrypt ransomware:\n\n```\n[BleedGreen builder (VirusTotal scan is currently at 2/57 detections):](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/e77df2ce34949eb11290445a411a47fb927e8871e2580897581981d17730032d/analysis/)\n```\nSHA-256: e77df2ce34949eb11290445a411a47fb927e8871e2580897581981d17730032d\n\n```\nA FireCrypt ransomware binary sample (VirusTotal scan is currently at [13/57 detections):](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/757e3242f6a2685ed9957c9e66235af889a7accead5719514719106d0b3c6fb4/analysis/)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSHA 256:757e3242f6a2685ed9957c9e66235af889a7accead5719514719106d0b3c6fb4\n\n### Email Address and Payment Contacts:\nEMAIL: gravityz3r0@sigaint.org\n\n Related Articles:\n\n```\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[DDoS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ddos/)\n[FireCrypt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/firecrypt/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
