Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, however, look to\nthose in the field of media for different purposes; ones that could have far-reaching impacts.\n\nJournalists and media organizations are well sought-after targets with Proofpoint researchers\nobserving APT actors, specifically those that are state-sponsored or state-aligned, routinely\nmasquerading as or targeting journalists and media organizations because of the unique access\nand information they can provide. The media sector and those that work within it can open doors\nthat others cannot. A well-timed, successful attack on a journalist’s email account could provide\ninsights into sensitive, budding stories and source identification. A compromised account could be\nused to spread disinformation or pro-state propaganda, provide disinformation during times of war\n\n\n-----\n\nor pandemic, or be used to influence a politically charged atmosphere. Most commonly, phishing\nattacks targeting journalists are used for espionage or to gain key insights into the inner workings\nof another government, company, or other area of state-designated import.\n\nProofpoint data since early 2021 shows a sustained effort by APT actors worldwide attempting to\ntarget or leverage journalists and media personas in a variety of campaigns, including those welltimed to sensitive political events in the United States. Some campaigns have targeted the media\nfor a competitive intelligence edge while others have targeted journalists immediately following\ntheir coverage painting a regime in a poor light or as a means to spread disinformation or\npropaganda. For the purposes of this report, we focus on the activities of a handful of APT actors\nassessed to be aligned with the state interests of China, North Korea, Iran, and Turkey.\n\n## Targeting Journalists’ Work Email Accounts\n\nAs observed in Proofpoint data, targeting journalists’ work email accounts is by far the most seen\nlocus of attack used by APT actors against this target set. It is important to note that journalists are\ncommunicating with external, foreign, and often semi-anonymous parties to gather information.\nThis outreach increases the risk of phishing since journalists, often by necessity, communicate with\nunknown recipients more so than the average user. Verifying or gaining access to such accounts\ncan be an entry point for threat actors for later stage attacks on a media organization’s network or\nto gain access to desired information.\n\n## China\n\nSince early 2021, the APT actor tracked by Proofpoint as TA412, known also as Zirconium based\non [public reporting by Microsoft about a phishing reconnaissance team within this larger APT](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/)\nthreat actor designation, has engaged in numerous reconnaissance phishing campaigns targeting\nUS-based journalists. TA412, which is believed to be aligned with the Chinese state interest and to\nhave strategic espionage objectives, has favored using malicious emails containing web beacons\nin these campaigns. This is a technique consistently used by the threat actor since at least 2016,\nhowever, it was likely in use for years prior. Web beacons, which are commonly referred to as\ntracking pixels, tracking beacons, and web bugs, embed a hyperlinked non-visible object within the\nbody of an email that, when enabled, attempts to retrieve a benign image file from an actorcontrolled server.\n\nProofpoint researchers assess these campaigns have been intended to validate targeted emails\nare active and to gain fundamental information about the recipients’ network environments. Web\nbeacons can provide the following technical artifacts to an attacker which, in turn, can serve as\nreconnaissance information as a threat actor plans their next stage of attack:\n\nExternally visible IP addresses\nUser-Agent string\nEmail address\nValidation that the targeted user account is active\n\n\n-----\n\nThe campaigns by TA412 and their ilk evolved over the course of months, adjusting lures to best fit\nthe current US political environment and switching to target US-based journalists focused on\ndifferent areas of interest to the Chinese government. The campaigns which targeted journalists\nwere part of a broader pattern of reconnaissance phishing conducted by this threat actor over\nmany years.\n\n**2021: Between January and February 2021, Proofpoint researchers identified five campaigns by**\nTA412 targeting US-based journalists, most notably those covering US politics and national\nsecurity during events that gained international attention. Of note a very abrupt shift in targeting of\nreconnaissance phishing occurred in the days immediately preceding the 6 January 2021 attack\non the US Capitol Building. Proofpoint researchers observed a focus on Washington DC and White\nHouse correspondents during this time. The malicious emails utilized subject lines pulled from\nrecent US news articles, such as “Jobless Benefits Run Out as Trump Resists Signing Relief Bill,”\n“US issues Russia threat to China,” and “Trump Call to Georgia Official Might Violate State and\nFederal Law.”\n\nThe message bodies duplicated text included in the news articles and the web beacon URLs\nincluded a benign PNG file with a 0x0 aspect ratio that was retrieved as part of the web beacon in\nthe following format:\n\nhxxp://www.actor-controlled domain[.]com/Free/<Targeted User Email\nFragment>/0103/Customer.png.\n\nThe URL structure designates an actor-controlled domain, a campaign identifier, a victim identifier,\na campaign date, and the name of the benign PNG resource.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Sample of a TA412 web beacon reconnaissance email. If an email client is configured to_\n_block downloadable content, then the web beacon URL should be presented to the target with an_\n_option to download the remote content, as seen in this image._\n\nIn August 2021, after a months-long break, TA412 again turned to targeting journalists, but this\ntime those working cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy issues with a focus on China. Those\ntargeted appeared to have written extensively on social media privacy issues and Chinese\ndisinformation campaigns, signaling an interest by the Chinese state in media narratives that could\npush a negative global opinion or perception of China. These campaigns mirrored those identified\nearlier in 2021 but demonstrated an evolving web beacon URL structure that changes over time.\nThe observed structure was:\n\nhxxp://[actor-controlled\ndomain/IP]/stringhere/AbbreviatedVictimAddress[@]AbbreviatedTargetedOrganization/filename[.\n]png.\n\n**2022: After an observed pause in targeting journalists, Proofpoint researchers identified a**\nresumption of targeting this sector on February 9, 2022. The campaigns were numerous and\noccurred over a period of ten days. These campaigns strongly resembled those noted in early\n2021 and indicated a desire to collect on US-based media organizations and contributors with a\nfocus on those reporting on US and European engagement in the anticipated Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nSubjects included:\n\nNew bill aims to prohibit US military aid to Ukraine\nUS issues Russia threat to China\nMacron reveals Putin 'guarantees'\nUK to arm Ukraine with anti-ship missiles against Russia - Kiev's envoy\nUS says how Ukraine stand-off can be resolved\nUK says invasion 'highly likely'\nWhite House says door for diplomacy with Russia remains open, but troop buildup is\ncontinuing\n\nAnother Chinese APT group, TA459, in late April 2022 targeted media personnel with emails\n[containing a malicious Royal Road RTF](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/03/vb2019-paper-attribution-object-using-rtf-object-dimensions-track-apt-phishing-weaponizers/) [attachment (acknowledge.doc) that, if opened, would](https://nao-sec.org/2020/01/an-overhead-view-of-the-royal-road.html)\ninstall and execute Chinoxy malware. This malware is a backdoor that is used to gain persistence\n[on a victim’s machine. Researchers at Bitdefender have observed the threat actor’s use of](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/379/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-Chinese-APT.pdf)\nChinoxy extensively in Southeast Asia since at least 2018. Of note, the targeted entity was\nresponsible for reporting on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which aligns with TA459’s historic\nmandate of collecting on intelligence matters related to Russia and Belarus.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. The Word document attachment, file name acknowledge.doc._\n\nThis campaign used a possibly compromised Pakistani government email address to send the\nemails and looked to entice media recipients with a lure on foreign policy in Afghanistan. To add to\nthe credibility of the emails, TA459 included links to a benign YouTube video produced by the\nIslamabad Security Dialogue, which references disinformation campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Screenshot of the YouTube video link included in the malicious emails._\n\n## North Korea\n\nIn a vengeful twist, the North Korea-aligned TA404 in early 2022 targeted a US-based media\norganization with job opportunity-themed phishing. This attack occurred after the organization\npublished an article critical of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un—a well-known motivator for\naction by North Korea-aligned APT actors. TA404, known more broadly as Lazarus, typically\nengages in highly targeted campaigns that begin with benign messages. This campaign aligned\nwith that expected behavior. It started with reconnaissance phishing that used URLs customized to\neach recipient. The URLs impersonated a job posting with landing pages designed to look like a\nbranded job posting site. If a victim interacted with the URL, which contained a unique target ID,\nthe server resolving the domain would have received confirmation that the email was delivered,\nand the intended target had interacted with it. This request also provides identifying information\nabout the computer, or device, allowing the host to keep track of the intended target.\n\nWhile Proofpoint researchers did not observe follow-up emails, considering this threat actor’s\nproclivity for later sending malware-laden email attachments, it is likely that TA404 would have\nattempted to send malicious template document attachment or something similar in the future.\nResearchers at the Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on March 24, 2022 disclosed details on\n[this campaign as part of “Operation Dream Job.” While journalism and media were not listed](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/)\namong the targeted sectors, Proofpoint has observed shared indicators of compromise utilized in\nboth campaigns identified earlier this year and those reported by Google TAG.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Targeting Journalists Social Media Accounts\n\nTargeting journalists and media organizations for their social media account credentials can have\n[significant consequences. For example, in 2013 a threat actor took over the official Associated](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-day-in-history-hacked-ap-tweet-about-white-house-explosions-triggers-panic-2018-04-23)\nPress Twitter account and posted a tweet claiming President Barack Obama had been injured in\nan attack on the White House. The stock market dropped more than 100 points in roughly two\nminutes following the tweet. Two years later, in 2015, a threat actor [compromised about 130](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/31/897815039/florida-teen-charged-as-mastermind-of-massive-twitter-hack)\nTwitter accounts of influential individuals and tricked some of their followers into transferring more\nthan $100,000 in Bitcoin to attacker-controlled accounts.\n\nWhile often times campaigns looking to compromise social media accounts, including those by\nAPTs, do not result in such severe or observable outcomes, they can still wind up requiring more\nthan just an account reset or the activation of multi-factor authentication (MFA), especially since\n[enabling MFA is not a guarantee of complete account protection.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/mfa-psa-oh-my)\n\n## Turkey\n\nSince early 2022, Proofpoint researchers have observed a prolific threat actor, tracked as TA482,\nregularly engaging in credential harvesting campaigns that target the social media accounts of\nmostly US-based journalists and media organizations. This victimology, TA482’s use of services\noriginating from Turkey to host its domains and infrastructure, as well as Turkey’s [history of](https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:vw345qt9750/20200611_turkey_report.pdf)\n[leveraging social media to spread pro-President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and pro-Justice and](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/24/turkish-hacktivists-make-cyberattacks-on-us-journalists.html)\nDevelopment Party (Turkey’s ruling party) propaganda support Proofpoint’s assessment that\nTA482 is aligned with the Turkish state.\n\nOngoing campaigns have narrowed in on Twitter credentials of any individuals that write for media\npublications. This includes journalists from well-known news outlets to those writing for an\nacademic institution and everything in-between. The malicious emails are typically Twitter security\nthemed and attempt to grab a recipient’s attention with subjects alerting the user to a suspicious or\nnew login location.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. A typical TA482 Twitter-themed credential phishing email._\n\nIf the target clicks on the link supplied in the email, they are taken to a credential harvesting\nlanding page which impersonates a Twitter login page to reset their password.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. A TA482 landing page designed to steal a user’s credentials._\n\nProofpoint researchers cannot independently verify the motivations behind these campaigns, but\nthe possibilities abound and, based on historical Turkey threat actor activity, could include using\nthe compromised accounts to target a journalist’s social media contacts, use the accounts for\ndefacement, or to spread propaganda. It is possible these attacks will ramp up as Turkey’s 2023\nparliamentary and presidential elections draw near.\n\n## Posing as Journalists\n\nThere is an inherent sense of intrigue when one is approached by a journalist to discuss an area of\nexpertise. The allure of having research highlighted in the media is often a great motivator to\noverlook or disregard signs that this opportunity may not be entirely legitimate. This social\nengineering tactic successfully exploits the human desire for recognition and is being leveraged by\nAPT actors wishing to target academics and foreign policy experts worldwide, likely in an effort to\ngain access to sensitive information.\n\n## Iran\n\nMultiple Iran-aligned APT actors use journalists or newspapers as pretexts to surveil targets and\nattempt to harvest their credentials. One of the most active in Proofpoint telemetry is TA453, also\nknown as Charming Kitten. TA453, which we assess with high confidence supports the Islamic\nRevolutionary Guard Corps intelligence collection efforts, routinely masquerades as journalists\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom around the world. The threat actor uses these personas to engage in benign conversations\nwith targets, which consist mostly of academics and policy experts working on Middle Eastern\nforeign affairs.\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 6, the content of TA453’s initial outreach emails indicate a degree of\nresearch on the intended target likely to enhance the believability of the request and to encourage\nfurther dialogue.\n\n_Figure 6. Screenshot of a benign TA453 conversation starter,_ _[posted by and used with permission](https://twitter.com/maasalan/status/1494307696178339844)_\n_from Mahsa Alimardani via Twitter._\n\nIf the initial email is ignored, TA453 will often recontact individuals to follow up (Figure 7). If the\ntargeted recipient does engage in conversation with the persona, TA453 will eventually invite them\nto a virtual meeting to have further discussions via a customized, but benign PDF (Figure 8).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Example of a TA453 follow-up email attempting to solicit a response from the target._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Example of a TA453 benign PDF uploaded to VirusTotal._\n\nThe vast majority of TA453 campaigns ultimately lead to credential harvesting. The benign PDFs,\nsimilar to Figure 8, are typically delivered from file hosting services and almost always contain a\nlink to a URL shortener and IP tracker that redirects targets to the credential harvesting domains\non actor-controlled infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Standard TA453 attack chain._\n\n**TA456, also known as Tortoiseshell, is another Iran-aligned threat actor that routinely**\nmasquerades as media organizations sending newsletters across the ideological spectrum,\nincluding Fox News and the Guardian. TA456 has repeatedly targeted the same users with\nnewsletter themed emails containing web beacons. This activity likely has complemented TA456's\n[efforts to deliver malware via relationships built on social media similar to previous campaigns.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/i-knew-you-were-trouble-ta456-targets-defense-contractor-alluring-social-media)\n\n_Figure 10. Examples of the newsletter-themes used by TA456 in the bodies of their phishing_\n_emails._\n\n\n-----\n\nLastly, TA457, an Iran-aligned threat actor active in Proofpoint data since late 2021, has been\nknown to masquerade as an “iNews Reporter” to deliver malware to public relations personnel for\ncompanies located in the US, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. For example, in early March 2022, TA457\nsent an email with the ironic subject “Iran Cyber War” and the actor-controlled domain newsspot[.]live. The campaign continued TA457’s pattern of using news themed lure websites to deliver\na malicious URL. The URL structure (news-spot[.]live/Reports/1/?id=[Campaign/Lure\nIdentifier]&pid=[TargetIdentifier]) has both an identifier to track which lure documents to deliver\nalong with a PID to determine which recipient is receiving the phish. The themes of documents\nhave included Iran, Russia, drones, war crimes, “secret weapons,” and more. When a user clicks\nthe malicious URL, two files are downloaded: a Word document and an .scr file. When macros are\nenabled on the document, it drops an embedded executable file (DnsDig.exe). When the\nreader.scr file is dropped, it downloads DnsDig.exe from the URL and also drops iran.pdf as a\ndecoy to the user. [DnsDig is a TA457 remote access trojan that uses DNS tunneling to a](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/lyceum-net-dns-backdoor)\nhardcoded domain (cyberclub[.]one).  Figure 11. Attack chain of TA457 “Iran Cyber War”\n_campaign._\n\n_Figure 11. Attack chain of TA457 “Iran Cyber War” campaign._\n\nBetween September 2021 and March 2022, Proofpoint observed TA457 campaigns approximately\nevery two to three weeks. The March 2022 campaign targeted both individual and generic, group\nemail addresses such as international.media@[redacted].com at less than ten Proofpoint\ncustomers involved in energy, media, government, and manufacturing.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTargeting journalists and media organizations is not novel. APT actors, regardless of their state\naffiliation, have and will likely always have a mandate to target journalists and media organizations\nand will use associated personas to further their objectives and collection priorities. From\nintentions to gather sensitive information to attempts to manipulate public perceptions, the\n\n\n-----\n\nknowledge and access that a journalist or news outlet can provide is unique in the public space.\nTargeting the media sector also lowers the risk of failure or discovery to an APT actor than going\nafter other, more hardened targets of interest, such as government entities.\n\nThe varied approaches by APT actors—using web beacons for reconnaissance, credential\nharvesting, and sending malware to gain a foothold in a recipient’s network—means those\noperating in the media space need to stay vigilant. Assessing one’s personal level of risk can give\nan individual a good sense of the odds they will end up as a target. Such as, if you report on China\nor North Korea or associated threat actors, you may become part of their collection requirements\nin the future. Being aware of the broad attack surface—all the varied online platforms used for\nsharing information and news—an APT actor can leverage is also key to preventing oneself from\nbecoming a victim. And ultimately practicing caution and verifying the identity or source of an email\ncan halt an APT attack in its nascent stage.\n\n[Previous Blog Post](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/how-threat-actors-hijack-attention-2022-social-engineering-report)\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
