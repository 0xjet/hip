Authorities were able to identify the individual in cooperation\nwith law enforcement in Romania and the U.K.\n\nThe cybercriminal’s identity has not been published but Office “K” of the Ministry of Internal\nAffairs in Belarus says that he is a 31-years old living in Gomel, a city in southeastern\nBelarus.\n\n## Encrypted computers in nearly 100 countries\n\nThe arrested GandCrab member was an affiliate, or 'Advert', for the organization and was\nresponsible for distributing the ransomware to victims.\n\n\"It was established that a 31-year-old resident of Gomel who had no previous convictions\ninfected more than a thousand computers. For decrypting each of them, he demanded an\namount equivalent to 1.2 thousand US dollars. Access to the admin panel for managing the\n\n\n-----\n\nransomware botnet was carried out via the darknet, which allowed the attacker to remain\nanonymous for a long time,\" said Vladimir Zaitsev, Deputy Head of the High-Tech Crimes\nDepartment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\n\"Part of the profit was transferred to the administrators (operators) of the server he leased.\nThe victims of the hacker were users from almost a hundred countries, and the largest\nnumber of victims were in India, the USA, Ukraine, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy\n[and Russia,\" Zaitsev added.](https://mvd.gov.by/ru/news/7309)\n\nIt is unclear how much money the criminal made from this operation but he shared part of\nthe paid ransoms with GandCrab administrator(s) who kept a server hidden in the darknet,\nallowing affiliates to remain hidden.\n\nAs part of their role of infecting victims, GandCrab affiliates would earn 60% for the first\nthree ransom payments they are responsible for. After the third payment, their revenue\nshare would jump to 70%.\n\nThis means if the arrested affiliate was demanding $1,200 as a ransom payment, they\nwould earn $840 per victim and the GandCrab developers would earn $360.\n\nLarger affiliates who demanded millions of dollars would stand to make far greater amounts\nof payments.\n\n[GandCrab shut down their operation on June 1st, 2019, after claiming to have generated](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-shutting-down-after-claiming-to-earn-2-billion/)\nmore than $2 billion in ransom payments and personally earning $150 million.\n\n[After GandCrab was shutdown, the FBI released the master decryption keys for the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-affiliates-continue-to-push-decryptable-versions/)\n[ransomware and BitDefender released a decryptor that allowed victims to recover their files](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/release-of-gandcrab-52-decryptor-ends-a-bad-ransomware-story/)\nfor free.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is not known how law enforcement obtained these keys, but it could have been through a\nseizure of one of the Tor payment servers.\n\nAfter GrandCrab shut down, another ransomware variant called REvil, or Sodinokibi, was\ncreated to fill the void left behind.\n\n[It has been reported that there are code similarities and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shared-code-links-sodinokibi-to-gandcrab-minus-the-fun-and-games/) [ties between the operators/affiliates](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-raas-was-a-training-ground-for-malware-distributors/)\nof REvil ransomware and GandCrab.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Arrest](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/arrest/)\n[GandCrab](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/gandcrab/)\n[Law Enforcement](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/law-enforcement/)\n[RaaS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/raas/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Ransomware-as-a-Service](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware-as-a-service/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
