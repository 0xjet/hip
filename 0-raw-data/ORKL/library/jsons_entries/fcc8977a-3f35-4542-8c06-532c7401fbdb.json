Crooks exploited some CMS vulnerabilities to upload and execute arbitrary PHP pages used to generate revenues via advertising.\n\nIn the last days of 2017, researchers at CSE Cybsec observed threat actors exploiting some\nCMS vulnerabilities to upload and execute arbitrary PHP pages used to generate revenues\nvia advertising. The huge malvertising campaign was dubbed EvilTraffic\n\nThe compromised websites involved in the EvilTraffic campaign run various versions of the\npopular WordPress CMS. Once a website has been compromised, attackers will upload a\n“zip” file containing all the malicious files. Despite the “zip” file has different name for each\ninfection, when it is uncompressed, the files contained in it have always the same structure.\nWe have found some of these archives not used yet, so we analyzed their content.\n\nThe malicious files are inserted under a path referring probably different versions of the\nsame malware (“vomiu”, “blsnxw”, “yrpowe”, “hkfoeyw”, “aqkei”, “xbiret”, “slvkty”).\n\n\n-----\n\nUnder this folder there are:\n\na php file, called “lerbim.php”;\na php file, that has the same name of the parent dir; it has initially “.suspected”\nextension and only in a second time, using “lerbim.php” file, it would be changed in\n_“.php” file;_\ntwo directories, called “wtuds” and “sotpie”, containing a series of files.\n\nAn example of this structure is shown in the following figure:\n\nThe main purpose of the “malware” used in the EvilTraffic campaign is to trigger a redirecting\nchain through at least two servers which generate advertising traffic.\n\nThe file “{malw_name}.php” becomes the core of all this context: if it is contacted by the user\nthrough the web browser, it redirects the flow first to “caforyn.pw” and then to “hitcpm.com”,\nwhich acts as a dispatcher to different sites registered to this revenue chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese sites could be used by attackers to offer commercial services that aim to increase\ntraffic for their customers, but this traffic is generated in an illegal way by compromising\nwebsites. The sites could host also fraudulent pages which pretend to download suspicious\nstuff (i.e. Toolbars, browser extensions or fake antivirus) or steal sensitive data (i.e. credit\ncard information).\n\nIn order to increase the visibility of the web, the compromised sites must have a good pagerank on search engines. So, the malware performs SEO Poisoning by leveraging on wordlist\ncontaining the trending searched words\n\nThe population of the compromised site with the wordlists and their relative query results is\ntriggered contacting the main PHP using a specific User-Agent on a path\n_“{malw_name}/{malw_name}.php?vm={keyword}”._\n\nResearchers from CSE CybSec ZLab discovered roughly 18.100 compromised websites.\n\nWhile researchers were analyzing the EvilTraffic malvertising campaign, they realized that\nmost of the compromised websites used in the first weeks of the attacks have been cleaned\nup in the last days. just in one week, the number of compromised websites dropped from\naround 35k to 18k.\n\nAccording to Alexa Traffic Rank, hitcpm.com is ranked number 132 in the world\nand 0.2367% of global Internet users visit it. Below are reported some traffic statistics related\nto hitcpm.com provided by hypestat.com\n\n**Daily Unique Visitors** **1,183,500**\n\n**Monthly Unique Visitors** 35,505,000\n\n**Pages per visit** 1.41\n\n**Daily Pageviews** 1,668,735\n\nThe analysis of the traffic shows an exponential increase in the traffic during October 2017.\n\nExperts discovered that crooks behind the Operation EvilTraffic used a malicious software to\nhijack traffic, it acts as brows a browser hijacker. The malware is distributed via various\nmethods, such as:\n\nAttachment of junk mail\nDownloading freeware program via unreliable site\nOpen torrent files and click on malicious links\nBy playing online games\nBy visiting compromised websites\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main purpose of the malware is to hijack web browsers changing browser settings such\nas DNS, settings, homepage etc. in order to redirect as more traffic as possible to the\ndispatcher site.\n\nFurther technical details about this campaign, including IoCs, are available in the report\ntitled:\n\n“Tens of thousands of compromised web sites involved in new massive malvertising\n**_campaign”_**\n\n**You can download the full ZLAB Malware Analysis Report at the following URL:**\n\n**[http://csecybsec.com/download/zlab/20180121_CSE_Massive_Malvertising_Report.pdf](http://csecybsec.com/download/zlab/20180121_CSE_Massive_Malvertising_Report.pdf)**\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n**[(Security Affairs – malvertising campaign, EvilTraffic)](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)**\n\n[Black SeoEvilTrafficHackingmalvertising campaignmalwareWordpress](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/black-seo)\n\nShare On\n\n\n-----\n\nYou might also like\n\n**[Experts believe that Russian Gamaredon APT could fuel a new round of DDoS attacks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131762/apt/gamaredon-apt-ddos-attacks.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\n**[The strange link between Industrial Spy and the Cuba ransomware operation](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131754/cyber-crime/industrial-spy-cuba-ransomware.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n\n\n-----\n\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
