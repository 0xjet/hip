In this post\nwe will focus on the most recent changes and observations of their campaign which utilizes\nspearphishing with legitimate remote administration tools.\n\n### Executive summary:\n\nDeep Instinct’s Threat Research team has identified a new campaign of the\nMuddyWater group.\nThe campaign has been observed targeting Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Iraq, Israel,\nJordan, Oman, Qatar, Tajikistan, and United Arab Emirates.\nThe campaign exhibits updated TTPs to previously reported MuddyWater activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Campaign overview\n\n### MuddyWater Exploiting Legitimate Tools\n\n[Previous research has shown that in 2020 MuddyWater sent spearphishing emails with direct](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/c/earth-vetala---muddywater-continues-to-target-organizations-in-t.html)\nlinks as well as PDF and RTF attachments containing links to archives hosted at\n“ws.onehub.com.”\n\nThose archives contained the installer for “RemoteUtilities,” a legitimate remote\nadministration tool.\n\n[Since the beginning of 2021, MuddyWater has been observed sending spearphishing emails](https://www.anomali.com/blog/probable-iranian-cyber-actors-static-kitten-conducting-cyberespionage-campaign-targeting-uae-and-kuwait-government-agencies)\ncontaining either direct links or Word documents with links to archives hosted at\n“ws.onehub.com.”\n\nThe archives from 2021 contained installers for ScreenConnect, another legitimate remote\nadministration tool.\n\nThis activity was [observed intermittently through the end of 2021 and until July 2022.](https://urlscan.io/result/2d5e994b-6c2b-462d-8ed1-5946c0799767/)\n\nIn July 2022 a [potential file related to this campaign was observed, but it contained Atera](https://twitter.com/k3yp0d/status/1543883858294210560)\nAgent instead of the usual ScreenConnect, potentially signaling the threat actor switched to\nanother remote administration tool to avoid detection of their long running campaign.\n\n### A new discovery: The current MuddyWater campaign\n\nThe most recent MuddyWater campaign was observed by Deep Instinct in the beginning of\n[October and possibly started in the September timeframe.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/76ab046de18e20fd5cddbb90678389001361a430a0dc6297363ff10efbcb0fa8)\n\nWhat makes this campaign different from previous waves is the use of a new remote\n[administration tool named “Syncro.”￼](https://syncromsp.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\nA new lure in the form of an HTML attachment was observed, along with the addition of other\nproviders for hosting the archives containing the installers of the remote administration tool.\n\nThe previous July sample with ScreenConnect mentioned earlier, was named\n“promotion.msi.”\n\nIn the current campaign there was a sample that had few names; one of them was also\n“promotion.msi.”\n\nThe above ScreenConnect sample was communicating with “instance-q927uirelay.screenconnect.com.” This instance was communicating with another MuddyWater MSI\n[installer named “Ertiqa.msi” which is a name of a Saudi organization.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/01e924ae71e12e629d09f2867fa1768ed40fa4dfc810f33f7caae7025dd0e25d)\n\n[In the current wave, MuddyWater used the same name “Ertiqa.msi,” but with Syncro installer.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/eae0acba9c9e6a93ce2d5b30a5f21515e8ccca0975fbd0e7d8862964fdfa1468)\n\nThe target geolocations and sectors also align with previous targets of MuddyWater.\nCombined, these indicators provide us with enough proof to confirm that this is the\nMuddyWater threat group.\n\n### EXAMPLE #1: Egyptian Hosting Company\n\nDirect links to Dropbox:\n\nFigure 2: Email containing direct link to Dropbox\nThis mail was sent from an Egyptian data hosting company, unlike previous campaigns using\nOneHub. This time MuddyWater used Dropbox to host the archive with the Syncro installer:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Zip archive hosted on Dropbox containing MSI installer for Syncro\nHTML attachment leading to OneDrive:\n\nFigure 4: Email containing HTML attachment\nOn the same date the email with the Dropbox link was sent, MuddyWater sent another email\nfrom the same address of an Egyptian hosting company to another Egyptian hosting\ncompany.\n\nInstead of embedding a direct link in the email message, an HTML attachment was sent.\nThis is a well-known technique to build trust. The receiving end knows the company who\nsent the mail. The attachment is not an archive or an executable which doesn’t raise enduser suspicion because HTML is mostly overlooked in phishing awareness trainings and\nsimulations.\n\nHTML is considered “safer,” at least from an anti-virus (AV) and email security solutions point\nof view. Although those solutions have the ability to scan HTML, they are often still delivered\nto the recipients and not blocked.\n\n[The HTML itself is very small; its main function is most likely to bypass email solutions that](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/html-attachments-remain-popular-among-phishing-actors-in-2022/)\nreplace any link with “safe” link.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: HTML attachment containing link to OneDrive\nThe [link inside the HTML file leads to OneDrive this time, hosting an archive containing](https://urlscan.io/result/50c685ef-2725-4e37-a30b-d97602e33010/)\nSyncro MSI installer.\n\n### EXAMPLE #2: Israeli Hospitality Industry\n\nIn another example from early November, MuddyWater sent an email from a company in the\nIsraeli hospitality industry to a wide number of contacts across different Israeli insurance\ncompanies:\n\nFigure 6: Email containing HTML attachment\nIn this mail the company from the hospitality industry is looking for insurance.\n\nThe text is written in Hebrew, but a native speaker will find it suspicious due to a poor choice\nof words.\n\nOnce again, the [link leads to an archive hosted on OneDrive which contain Syncro MSI](https://urlscan.io/result/1a2643c3-bc69-479e-a36c-e71e268cf945/)\ninstaller:\n\nFigure 7: HTML attachment containing link to OneDrive\nDespite those new TTPs, most of the Syncro installers are still hosted in OneHub:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Archive hosted on OneHub containing Syncro MSI installer\nWhat is unclear is whether or not MuddyWater gained full access to the email server or only\nthe credentials to one email box. The emails are sent from legitimate corporate accounts. We\nsee that in spite of the low level of sophistication that this tactic can be effective.\n\n### Syncro: A tool used by multiple threat actors\n\nMuddyWater is not the only actor abusing Syncro. It has also been observed recently in\n[BatLoader and](https://twitter.com/1ZRR4H/status/1575364101148114944) [Luna Moth campaigns.](https://blog.sygnia.co/luna-moth-false-subscription-scams)\n\nSyncro is a fully-featured platform for Managed Service Provider’s (MSPs) to run their\nbusiness.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Sycnro Installer inside the MSI\nSyncro provides an agent for MSPs to manage any device that has Syncro installed with the\ncustom-made provided MSI file that includes the customerID.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10:\n\nSyncro installation process with the customerID and ApiKey\nSyncro has a 21-day trial offer. You choose the subdomain to be used by your MSP:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Syncro trial sign-up screen with choice of syncromsp.com subdomain\nWhile investigating some of the installers that MuddyWater used, we see that for each\nunique mail a new MSI was used. In most cases MuddyWater used a single subdomain with\na single MSI installer.\n\nIt seems that most of the subdomains don’t have any useful meaning, although a few are\nclear:\n\nmohammadosman6060 and osmandembele4040 are football players\nnetanyahu8585 and benet5050 are the current and former prime ministers of Israel\nCham Wings is the name of a Syrian airline\n\nThe trial version contains the fully featured web GUI which allows complete control over a\ncomputer with the Syncro agent installed:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Web GUI of Syncro with available remote administration features\nThose features are standard for remote administration tools, such as terminal with SYSTEM\nprivileges, remote desktop access, full file system access, tasks, and services manager.\n\nAll those features combined with a signed MSI installer creates the perfect weapon for a\nthreat actor to gain initial access and start performing recon on the target. Later, they enable\nthe threat actors to deploy additional backdoors, exfiltrate files, or hand-off access to other\nthreat actors. A threat actor that has access to a corporate machine via such capabilities has\nnearly limitless options.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n[We have recently described other dual-use tools that are being abused for malicious](https://www.deepinstinct.com/blog/the-russian-spyagent-a-decade-later-and-rat-tools-remain-at-risk)\npurposes. We recommend that security teams monitor for remote desktop solutions that are\nnot common in the organization as they have a higher chance of being abused.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK:\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Description** **Observable**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Description** **Observable**\n\n\nInitial Access T1566.001\nPhishing:\nSpearphishing\nAttachment\n\nInitial Access T1566.002\nPhishing:\nSpearphishing\nLink\n\n\naaa9db79b5d6ba319e24e6180a7935d\n\nd1b4ca2933f49494b4400d5bf5ab502e\n\n2ed6ebaa28a9bfccc59c6e89a8990631\n\n\nCommand\nand Control\n\n\nT1219 Remote\nAccess Software\n\n\nMuddyWater\nhas\ncompromised\nthird parties\nand used\ncompromised\naccounts to\nsend\nspearphishing\nemails with\ntargeted\nattachments\nto recipients.\n\nMuddyWater\nhas\ncompromised\nthird parties\nand used\ncompromised\naccounts to\nsend\nspearphishing\nemails\ncontaining\nlinks to\nlegitimate\ndomains\nhosting\narchives with\nremote\nmanagement\nsoftware.\n\nMuddyWater\nhas used a\nlegitimate\napplication,\nSyncro, to\nmanage\nsystems\nremotely and\nmove\nlaterally.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Description** **Observable**\n\n\nResource\nDevelopment\n\nResource\nDevelopment\n\n### IOC:\n\n\nT1588.002 Obtain\nCapabilities: Tool\n\nT1583.006Acquire\nInfrastructure:\nWeb Services\n\n\nMuddyWater\nhas used a\nlegitimate\napplication,\nSyncro, to\nmanage\nsystems\nremotely and\nmove\nlaterally.\n\nMuddyWater\nhas used file\nsharing\nservices\nincluding\nOneHub,\nDropbox, and\nOneDrive to\ndistribute\ntools.\n\n\n2ed6ebaa28a9bfccc59c6e89a8990631\n\nhttps://urlscan.io/result/c6f46810-ee1947b4-8717-40dc09b4ea09/\n\n- archived scan of a Dropbox URL\ncontaining an archive with Syncro\ninstaller.\n\n\nf511bdd471096fc81dc8dad6806624a73837710f99b76b69c6501cb90e37c311\n\nefd5271bdb57f52b4852bfda05122b9ff85991c0600befcbd045f81d7a78eac5\nd65d80ab0ccdc7ff0a72e71104de2b4c289c02348816dce9996ba3e2a4c1dd62\n\n1670a59f573037142f417fb8c448a9022c8d31a6b2bf93ad77a9db2924b502af\n\ndedc593acc72c352feef4cc2b051001bfe22a79a3a7852f0daf95e2d10e58b84\n\neae0acba9c9e6a93ce2d5b30a5f21515e8ccca0975fbd0e7d8862964fdfa1468\n\n7e7292b5029882602fe31f15e25b5c59e01277abaab86b29843ded4aa0dcbdd1\n\nc7a2a9e020b4bcbfa53b37dea7ebf6943af203b94c24a35c098b774f79d532ac\n\n887c09e24923258e2e2c28f369fba3e44e52ce8a603fa3aee8c3fb0f1ca660e1\n\n01dfa94e11b60f92449445a9660843f7bea0d6aad62f1c339e88252008e3b494\n\nd550f0f9c4554e63b6e6d0a95a20a16abe44fa6f0de62b6615b5fdcdb82fe8e1\n\n61dcf1eeb616104742dd892b89365751df9bb8c5b6a2b4080ac7cf34294d7675\n\nc6cfd23282c9ff9d0d4c72ee13797a898b01cd5fd256d347e399e7528dad3bfd\n\n5578b7d126ebae78635613685d0cd07f4fb86f2e5b08e799bdc67d6d6053ede2\n32339f7ac043042e6361225b594047dd4398da489a2af17a9f74a51593b14951\n\ndab77aea8bf4f78628dcf45be6e2e79440c38a86e830846ec2bddc74ff0a36e4\nb5c7acf08d3fd68ddc92169d23709e36e45cb65689880e30cb8f376b5c91be57\n\n2a5f74e8268ad2d38c18f57a19d723b72b2dadd11b3ab993507dd2863d18008d\n\ne87fe81352ebda0cfc0ae785ebfc51a8965917235ee5d6dc6ca6b730eda494cf\n\n\n-----\n\naa282daa9da3d6fc2dc6d54d453f4c23b746ada5b295472e7883ee6e6353b671\n4e80bd62d02f312b06a0c96e1b5d1c6fd5a8af4e051f3f7f90e2976580842515\n\n697580cf4266fa7d50fd5f690eee1f3033d3a706eb61fc1fca25471dbc36e684\n\ndc7e102a2c68f7e3e15908eb6174548ce3d13a94caadf76e1a4ee834dc17a271\n\nf24ce8e6679893049ce4e5a03bc2d8c7e44bf5b918bf8bf1c2e45c5de4d11e56\n\n433b47f40f47bea0889423ab96deb1776f47e9faa946e7c5089494ed00c6cc29\n\n011cb37733cdf01c689d12fedc4a3eda8b0f6c4dcdeef1719004c32ee331198e\n\ne217c48c435a04855cf0c439259a95392122064002d4881cf093cc59f813aba8\n\n331b513cf17568329c7d5f1bac1d14f38c77f8d4adba40c48dab6baf98854f92\n\n4d24b326d0335e122c7f6adaa22e8237895bdf4c6d85863cf8e84cfcc0503e69\n\na35a1c92c001b59605efd318655d912f2bcd4e745da2b4a1e385d289e12ee905\n\n4550b4fa89ff70d8ea59d350ad8fc537ceaad13779877f2761d91d69a2c445b2\n\n653046fa62d3c9325dbff5cb7961965a8bf5f96fa4e815b494c8d3e165b9c94a\n\n76ab046de18e20fd5cddbb90678389001361a430a0dc6297363ff10efbcb0fa8\n\n[Back To Blog](https://www.deepinstinct.com/blog)\n\n\n-----",
