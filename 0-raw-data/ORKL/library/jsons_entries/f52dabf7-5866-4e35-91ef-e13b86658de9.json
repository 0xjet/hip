Today, in connection\n[with the release of the TAG Bulletin, we are sharing year-in-review insights for 2022 about](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q4-2022/)\nDRAGONBRIDGE, the most prolific IO actor TAG tracks. DRAGONBRIDGE, also known as\n“Spamouflage Dragon,” is a spammy influence network linked to China that has a presence\nacross [multiple](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/information-operations-june-2020.html) [platforms.](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/08/removing-cib-china/)\n\nMost DRAGONBRIDGE activity is low quality content without a political message, populated\nacross many channels and blogs. However, a small fraction of DRAGONBRIDGE accounts\nalso post about current events with messaging that pushes pro-China views.\nDRAGONBRIDGE narratives in 2022 spanned a wide range of news topics — ranging from\nChina’s Covid-19 response to the war in Ukraine — and included a higher volume of content\ncritical of the US. The actor has primarily targeted Chinese speakers, but some narratives\nwere in English and other languages.\n\nIn 2022, Google disrupted over 50,000 instances of DRAGONBRIDGE activity across\nYouTube, Blogger, and AdSense, reflecting our continued focus on this actor and success in\nscaling our detection efforts across Google products. We have terminated over 100,000\nDRAGONBRIDGE accounts in the IO network’s lifetime. Despite their scale and profuse\ncontent production, DRAGONBRIDGE achieved practically no organic engagement from real\nviewers — in 2022, the majority of DRAGONBRIDGE channels had 0 subscribers when\nGoogle disrupted them, and over 80% of DRAGONBRIDGE videos had fewer than 100\nviews. Engagement for DRAGONBRIDGE’s blogs on Blogger was also low, with nearly 95%\nreceiving 10 or fewer views for blogs terminated in December.\n\nBar chart showing enforcement actions\nDRAGONBRIDGE is the most prolific IO actor Google enforced against in 2022\n\nWhile DRAGONBRIDGE has not attracted an organic audience, they are persistent and\nadaptable. Since TAG started tracking the network in 2019, DRAGONBRIDGE has\nconsistently experimented with new tactics, new formats and higher quality content. As they\nevolve over time, DRAGONBRIDGE’s coordinated inauthentic activity may eventually attract\n\n\n-----\n\nthe attention of real users. For this reason, TAG and Mandiant track DRAGONBRIDGE\nclosely and Google has taken an aggressive approach to identifying and removing their\ncontent.\n\n## Content without an audience\n\nIn 2022, the overwhelming majority of DRAGONBRIDGE content Google disrupted never\nreached a real audience. Among the 53,177 channels we disabled in 2022, 58% had zero\nsubscribers and 42% of their videos had zero views. 83% of those videos had fewer than\n100 views.\n\nBar chart showing YouTube views\nNumber of views among disabled DRAGONBRIDGE YouTube channels\n\nIn the rare cases where DRAGONBRIDGE content did receive engagement, it was almost\nentirely inauthentic, coming from other DRAGONBRIDGE accounts and not from genuine\nusers. Comment activity was mostly from other DRAGONBRIDGE accounts.\n\nBlogger engagement metrics also show almost no authentic audience for\nDRAGONBRIDGE’s blogs. For blogs terminated in December, nearly 95% of\nDRAGONBRIDGE blogs received 10 or fewer views, and over 96% received no comments.\n\nside by side charts of number of DRAGONBRIDGE blogs on Blogger disabled in\nDecember 2022\nNumber of views and comments on DRAGONBRIDGE blogs on Blogger disabled in\nDecember 2022\n\n## Low quality and spammy\n\nA feature of DRAGONBRIDGE – and likely a contributing reason they have not gained an\norganic audience on YouTube and Blogger – is the low quality of their content, especially in\nEnglish. Most of their posts are spammy, nonsensical material without an overt political\nmessage — often clips of animals, landscapes, food, sports and other content. Blurry\nvisuals, garbled audio, poor translations, malapropisms, and mispronunciations are also\ncommon. The content is often hastily produced and error-prone — for example, neglecting to\nremove Lorem Ipsum text from a video.\n\nA screenshot of low quality, spammy content\nDRAGONBRIDGE video content with “Lorem Ipsum” placeholder text\n\n## Pro-China narratives and increased criticism of the US\n\nA small fraction of DRAGONBRIDGE channels and blogs post on current events, promoting\npro-China messages and criticizing the US. In 2022, DRAGONBRIDGE increased focus on\nand sharpened their criticism of the US with posts mostly in Mandarin in English and other\n\n\n-----\n\nlanguages.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nDRAGONBRIDGE’s pro-China content included narratives praising China’s pandemic\nresponse, criticism of pro-democracy protests, and significantly in 2022, more strident\nsupport for unification with Taiwan.\n\nWe saw an increase in DRAGONBRIDGE activity amidst heightened cross-strait\ndevelopments. Following the announcement of a possible visit to Taipei by then US House\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi in late July, DRAGONBRIDGE shifted some of its focus towards\ncriticism of Speaker Pelosi, along with her family and finances. This was in line with usual\nDRAGONBRIDGE patterns of attempting to discredit US political leadership.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, during and after the Chinese People s Liberation Army s (PLA) military drills\nstraddling Taiwan in early August, DRAGONBRIDGE sharply escalated its rhetoric,\nuploading militaristic videos of the PLA and political videos calling for Taiwanese President\nTsai Ing-Wen and her political allies to “surrender,” moving away from criticism of Speaker\nPelosi. DRAGONBRIDGE displayed unusually coherent behavior in using uniform hashtags\nand titles across channels, while swiftly and repeatedly uploading topical, high-productionvalue content that was not interspersed with the usual misdirecting spam. The pace and\nmanner of this pivot highlighted DRAGONBRIDGE’s additional sensitivity to geopolitical\ndevelopments in China’s immediate neighborhood, and Taiwan in particular.\n\nSide by side images of DRAGONBRIDGE uploads of militaristic videos timed to coincide\nwith large-scale PLA military drills straddling Taiwan\nDragonbridge uploaded militaristic videos timed to coincide with large-scale PLA military\ndrills straddling Taiwan\n\nIn 2022, DRAGONBRIDGE also posted narratives claiming the US was responsible for\nstoking tensions abroad and meddling in the domestic affairs of other countries.\nDRAGONBRIDGE’s US-focused narratives portrayed US society and democracy in a\nnegative light, cycling through political and social narratives that evolved with the headlines.\nIn 2022, Google removed DRAGONBRIDGE content on topics such as US Covid-19\nresponse, racial inequality, political divisions, inflation, and other controversial topics.\n\nIn the leadup to the 2022 US midterm elections, Google terminated channels where\nDRAGONBRIDGE attempted to spread narratives highlighting US political divisions, potential\nfor political violence, and threats to democracy. They presented election narratives as if they\n[were short news clips. One video, previously reported by Mandiant, attempted to cast voting](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/prc-dragonbridge-influence-elections)\nin the US as ineffective and a waste of time.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Bulk account infrastructure\n\nTo post their spam and IO content, DRAGONBRIDGE manages infrastructure consisting of\nthousands of accounts at any given time. Google has terminated 100,960 accounts\nassociated with DRAGONBRIDGE over the network’s lifetime.\n\nRather than build their account infrastructure themselves, DRAGONBRIDGE obtains Google\nAccounts from bulk account sellers who create and sell accounts for profit. We have seen\nDRAGONBRIDGE reuse accounts that were previously used for financially motivated activity,\n\n\n-----\n\nthen went dormant before they resumed activity and posted DRAGONBRIDGE videos and\nblogs. We believe accounts like this are changing hands from other bad actors to\nDRAGONBRIDGE.\n\n## Evolving tactics and experimentation\n\nDRAGONBRIDGE regularly experiments with new tactics, including producing a small\nnumber of channels with high quality, bespoke content. These evolving tactics underscore\nDRAGONBRIDGE’s willingness to experiment and their persistence. Tactics we saw\nDRAGONBRIDGE test include:\n\nHigh quality content with real human voice narration instead of a machine generated\nvoice\nTalk show format with a real person on-camera discussing events in a “news like”\nformat\nAnimated political cartoons\nIO content mixed in with high quality apolitical content, such as beauty advice and\ncooking tips\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite their failure to gain traction with an authentic audience, DRAGONBRIDGE generates\nhigh volumes of content across multiple platforms, is persistent and continues to experiment\nin their tactics and techniques. That is why we have scaled our efforts to disrupt\nDRAGONBRIDGE coordinated inauthentic activity on our platforms. We encourage others in\nthe community to continue tracking this actor and shedding light on their operations and\n[would like to thank Mandiant and](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/prc-dragonbridge-influence-elections) [Graphika for their partnership in countering](https://graphika.com/reports/spamouflage-breakout)\nDRAGONBRIDGE activity.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\nRelated stories\n\nThreat Analysis Group\n**TAG Bulletin: Q1 2023**\n\nThreat Analysis Group shares their Q1 2023 bulletin.\n\nBy Shane Huntley\n\nMay 01, 2023\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat Analysis Group\n**Ukraine remains Russia’s biggest cyber focus in 2023**\n\nGoogle's Threat Analysis Group shares first quarter cyber updates on the threat\nlandscape from the war in Ukraine.\n\nBy Billy Leonard\n\nApr 19, 2023\nThreat Analysis Group\n**How we’re protecting users from government-backed attacks from North Korea**\n\nGoogle's Threat Analysis Group shares information on ARCHIPELAGO as well as the\nwork to stop government-backed attackers.\n\nBy Adam Weidemann\n\nApr 05, 2023\nThreat Analysis Group\n**Spyware vendors use 0-days and n-days against popular platforms**\n\nGoogle’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) tracks actors involved in information operations\n(IO), government backed attacks and financially motivated abuse.
