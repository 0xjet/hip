To date, two periods of high activity have been identified following the initial attack. These were in May and October 2016. All known samples from these periods used infected Excel files attached to phishing emails to infect victims. Once infected, the victim machine can be controlled by the attacker to perform basic remote-access trojan-like tasks including command execution and file upload and download.\n\n The primary targets have evolved over time, however, they continue to be focused on critical infrastructure and governmental entities. Early attacks were focused on Middle Eastern banks and government entities. The latest attacks, in October 2016, focused on government entities. They now include other Middle Eastern countries and the U.S. In addition, these latest attacks included a number of airlines from Middle Eastern countries. It is likely that this attacker will move to other industries, but history suggests they are most interested in these espionage activities rather than, for instance, intellectual property theft.\n\n About this Report The LogRhythm Labs™ Team (Labs Team) designed this report to provide actionable intelligence regarding threat actors and the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) they use. Using this information, security operations center (SOC) analysts can better detect and respond to this specific threat.\n\n The indicators of compromise (IOC) contained within this report can help detect attacks by this threat actor. Where applicable SOC analysts can import or create signatures that can be added to different security tools to watch for activity related to this campaign or those using similar TTPs. This report has been designated as TLP:WHITE[1] and therefore may be shared publicly. For this reason, while the TTPs contained within this report were current, the threat actor will likely take measures to thwart detection.\n\n The mitigation and remediation strategies presented in this report can be used to respond to network attacks by this threat actor. SOC analysts can use SmartResponse™ plug-ins to assist in response efforts when an infected host is detected. Given the malware samples analyzed, remediation is simple and involves deletion of files and operating system objects. The Labs Team did not have a large sample of post-infection tools. Therefore, remediation of these tools is beyond the scope of this report.\n\n1 https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OILRIG CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS\n\n##### OilRig Infection Profile\n\n###### Major Findings This threat intelligence report is based on analysis by the Labs Team and examines the OilRig malware campaign. For this report, the Labs Team conducted open-source intelligence (OSINT) research for all publicly released data pertaining to this campaign and its associated malware samples. All malware samples were then analyzed using a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques. The analysis results were then combined with threat intelligence and background information to produce this report.\n\n • Phishing emails are used to deliver weaponized Microsoft Excel documents.\n\n • 23 unique samples of weaponized documents have  been identified.\n\n • The samples correspond to roughly four families of malware when grouped by malware package components and command and control methodologies.\n\n • Most malware samples, when weaponized documents are executed, use VisualBasic for application payload to infect a system with PowerShell (.ps1) and VisualBasic scripts.\n\n\n\n###### • The malware achieves persistence by Microsoft Scheduled Tasks.\n\n • Capabilities of the analyzed malware samples include very basic command execution, file upload and file download capability.\n\n • Command and control mechanisms exist for both HTTP as well as a more stealthy DNS-based command and control and data infiltration/exfiltration mechanism.\n\n • The analyzed malware samples are easily detected  and remediated.\n\n • Targets likely include government organizations, companies and government-owned companies in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Turkey and Israel.\n\n • The attacks span an eight-month time frame in 2016, punctuated by periods of high activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Intelligence Analysis\n\n\n## Threat Intelligence Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Threat Intelligence Analysis\n\n###### Previous Reporting Over the course of our investigation we identified three reports related to the OilRig campaign, one from FireEye in May of 2016,[2] and two from Palo Alto Networks—one from May 2016[3] and the other October 2016.[4] These reports put forth the following key points:\n\n • Banks in the Middle East were targeted with phishing emails that contained weaponized Microsoft Excel attachments (FireEye).\n\n • Technology organizations in Saudi Arabia were also targeted (Palo Alto Networks).\n\n • These were likely related to a previous Saudi Arabian defense industry attack (Palo Alto Networks).\n\n • One email appeared to be a legitimate conversation between employees that was then forwarded with a weaponized attachment (FireEye).\n\n • Other related campaign phishing emails used job or service offering (Palo Alto Networks).\n\n • Phishing campaigns appeared to be highly targeted (FireEye/Palo Alto Networks).\n\n • Data exfiltration and C2 were tunneled over DNS  (FireEye/Palo Alto Networks).\n\n In addition, these reports provided a list of indiciators of compromise that our analysts combined with our own findings to enumerate as many samples of related malware as possible.\n\n2 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html\n\n\n###### Malware Samples for Analysis The following is the list of all malicious files identified as related to this campaign. Our malware analysis of these files concluded that most were likely related to the OilRig campaign except for several samples. These other samples differed enough that, without further evidence, attribution was not possible.\n\n\n3 http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/the-oilrig-campaign-attacks-on-saudi-arabian-organizations-deliver-helminth-backdoor/\n\n4 http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/10/unit42-oilrig-malware-campaign-updates-toolset-and-expands-targets/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Campaign Targets The reports from Fire Eye and Palo Alto Networks suggested that Middle Eastern banks and defense organizations in Saudi Arabia, companies in Qatar, and government organizations in Turkey, Israel, and the United States had been targeted by this campaign. Our analysts identified one phishing email that appeared to be sent to an organization within the Turkish government (shown in Figure 1). Another file that was analyzed had the name “de askeri darbe.xls.” When translated from Turkish to English this likely means “military coup.” The phishing email this file was attached to was not available for analysis to confirm.\n\n In addition, our analysts knew of two airlines in the Middle East that were targeted in September 2016. During our analysis, we found multiple examples where Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, made to look like they included airline pricing information, had been weaponized. Several of these contained the names of Middle Eastern airlines such as “TurkishAirlines_Offers.xls” and “Israel Airline.xls.” This evidence suggested many airlines in the Middle East might have been targeted. At least one phishing email containing an attachment such as these was known to have been sent to a Middle Eastern airline.\n\nFigure 1: Spear Phishing Example\n\n\n###### Malware Submission Analysis The following table shows the malicious Excel files containing OilRig malware that have been submitted to open source threat intelligence, the filenames used, what country they were submitted from, and when they were submitted. To reduce the amount of noise, we have only filtered the original data to show the most relevant submissions.\n\n For instance, if a file was submitted multiple times by the same source, we only show the first submission. Or if the filename was changed to a hash value, as opposed to the original attachment name, it was filtered out. This was  done for brevity and to show the victims, as opposed to security practitioners and investigators. The table below shows that samples uploaded to open source threat intelligence from countries outside the Middle East were also uploaded from within.\n\n SHA256 Filenames Submission Date Country\n\n4b511... 111.xls South Africa 2016-05-09\n\n4b511...

Saudi Arabia likely contains the majority of targeted organizations by this actor group, as they represent the highest total number of unique submissions with 22. Great Britain and the United States follow in second and third place respectively with 11 and 9 different submissions of malware. These two countries likely represent two nations performing analysis on this campaign rather than being direct targets.\n\n Other targets include the Middle Eastern countries of United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel, Turkey, and Azerbaijan. While it is not conclusive that each of these countries contains organizations attacked by this actor group, there are several indicators that do lead to that conclusion. Filenames such as “TurkishAirline_Offers.xls” and “Israel Airlines.xls” make a strong correlation that these particular organizations were targets at one point.\n\nFigure 1: Total Submission by Country\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Domain Registrations The following domains are directly related to the malware analyzed within this report. There are several common factors between these domains and the registratars of the domains. The registrant names of Zak S. Whittaker and Aren Saginian appear within the majority of the domain registrations. A correlation exists among the following domains: dnsrecordsolver. tk, googlednsupdate.tk, and shalaghlagh.tk.\n\n The domains were registered with Private Protection enabled, so detailed data regarding their registration is not currently available. These three domains are hardcoded within the analyzed malware samples highlighted within this report. It is currently unclear as to the origin countries or registrants of these domains.\n\n Domain Known Resolution Registrant Creation Registrant Name Registrant Email\n\ndnsrecordsolver.tk Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown\n\ngooglednsupdate.tk Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown\n\nshalaghlagh.tk 195.20.46.112 Unknown Unknown Unknown\n\nwinodwsupdates.me 136.243.214.247 2015-12-28 Jason Park jasonpark1980@mail.ru\n\ngo0gIe.com 176.9.164.205, 5.157.86.5 2016-02-08 andres user3401@talahost.net\n\nupdate-kernal.net 46.4.232.65, 85.158.203.190 2016-05-15 Aren Saginian zack.patrik@mail.com\n\nwindows-dns-resolver.org 149.202.230.140 2016-05-26 Aren Saginian zack.patrik@mail.com\n\ncheck-updater.org 85.158.203.190, 164.132.2.87 2016-05-26 Aren Saginian zack.patrik@mail.com\n\nmicrosoft-kernels-pdate.net 85.158.203.190, 192.99.102.2 2016-05-26 Aren Saginian zack.patrik@mail.com\n\nupgradesystems.info 85.158.203.190, 5.152.194.227, 2016-05-26 Aren Saginian zack.patrik@mail.com\n95.219.15.23, 50.63.202.38\n\ngoogleupdate.download 192.99.102.35 2016-06-06 Unknown Unknown\n\nmslicensecheck.com 2016-08-01 Jennifer fjokovic jennifer.djokovic@mail.ru\n\nmain-google-resolver.com 136.243.203.141 2016-09-10 Zak S Whittaker zak.s.whittaker@gmail.com\n\nnet-support.info 50.63.202.66, 68.178.232.99 2016-09-11 Zak S Whittaker zak.s.whittaker@gmail.com\n\nupdateorg.com 151.80.211.144 2016-10-09 Zak S Whittaker zak.s.whittaker@gmail.com\n\nyahoooooomail.com 195.22.28.210 2016-10-12 Matthew Pynhas jgou.veia@gmail.com\n\nTable 2: Analyzed Malware Domain Associations\n\n###### Previously Attributed Domains Domain attribution noted in previous reports does not bear resemblance to the current domain usage highlighted here.

Although the actual commands and encoding are slightly different, the DNS communication methodology is similar to that utilized by “Special Offers.xls”.\n\n “DnE.ps1” crafts HTTP packets with custom headers to the server “http://main-google-resolver.com/index. aspx?id=__\\”, where the command to be executed is appended at the end of the URL. These commands are “d” for download, “u” for upload, and “b” for downloading and executing a batch file. Unlike the other analyzed samples, “DnE.ps1” performs each of the following processes every time it is executed (every three minutes):\n\n • Performs an initialization routine that checks for the existence of the three directories and creates them if not found\n\n • Downloads an unknown file from the server\n\n • Downloads and executes an unknown batch file from the server, then deletes the file\n\n • Uploads all files contained in “%Public%\\Libraries\\ RecordedTV\\up” to the server and then deletes the files\n\n\n###### C2 activity performed by “DnS.ps1” is initially driven by commands sent from the victim as crafted DNS requests to the attacker’s customized name server. When run, the script performs the following:\n\n • An initialization routine modifies the script file on disk to change the bot identifier.\n\n • A DNS request is generated as <semi-random>.main- google-resolver.com, where the hostname generated is based on the command and control functionality exercised.\n\n • The domain resolution is attempted up to 20 times, sleeping for 500ms between each request.\n\n • If resolution is unsuccessful, the bot identifier is reset to the original value “###” and the script exits.\n\n • Otherwise, the resolved address is parsed and compared to hardcoded values.\n\n -- If the address starts with “33.33.”, the global filename variable is set to “3333”.\n\n -- If the address equals “35.35.35.35”, this signifies the end of data transmission and the script exits.\n\n -- If neither case is true, and the bot identifier is “###”, the script exits.\n\n -- If neither case is true, but a global flag is set, the script appends the four octet values returned to the batch file written to the “%Public%\\Libraries\\ RecordedTV\\tp” directory.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Special Offers.xls The dropped PowerShell file appears to have very basic upload, download, and arbitrary command execution functionality. Transmitted command and file data contained within the hostname or IP address is associated with DNS queries and responses. This type of functionality could potentially be very noisy on network-based sensors. However, it also represents an exfiltration and command and control method that can often function on otherwise highly secured networks.\n\n C2 activity is initially driven by commands sent from the victim as crafted DNS requests to the attacker’s customized name server. When run, the script sends three initial DNS requests containing command data and parses the IP address returned by the request. The initial commands are structured as follows (where the <line number> field is only applicable to the “E” command and <Global ID> is a script variable that varies based upon the commands that are run):\n\n <command><Global ID><random characters>[<line number>].googlednsupdate.tk\n\n The field descriptions are provided in the tables below.\n\n Data Description\n\n<command> One character, either “N”, “C”, “T”, or “E” (if an error occurs with one of the commands).\nThe “N” command will only be sent when the <Global ID> variable is set to “A1”.\n\n<Global ID> Initially set to “A1”, but will be set to the characters represented by the third and fourth octet of the resolved IP\naddress if the address’s first and second octets equal 61. For example, if the resolved IP address is 61.61.65.51,\n<Global ID> will be set to “eQ”.\n\n<random characters> A number of characters randomly chosen from the set of printable characters.

It is the opinion of the analysts that this sample is not related to the same campaign; as such, the C2 methodology is not covered in detail. Further analysis is available upon request.\n\n The establishment of a command and control session with the server, the malicious script manually creates a UDP socket over port 53 and connects to the resolved IP address of the server.

The rules outlined below transform the remediation recommendations outlined above into operational AI Engine rules that can be leveraged to detect and respond to this threat. We recommend that users of other monitoring, detection, and prevention products refer to the remediation recommendations outlined earlier in the report or leverage the logic used in the LogRhythm SIEM  AI Engine rules outlined here to develop your own methods, signatures, or rules for detection and response.\n\n Special Offers Execution Chain The OilRig Execution Chain AI Engine rule is designed to detect the series of events for the Special Offer execution chain. The execution begins with Excel, followed by PowerShell, and finally sctask.exe. This rule is not likely to fire false positive alerts.\n\n Special Offers.xls Macro Detection The OilRig Special Offer AI Engine rule is designed to detect the creation of specific files within the environment. These files are directly related to the Special Offers style of\n\n\n###### phishing event from the campaign. The presence of these files should trigger an immediate execution of this alarm. This alert is not likely to generate false positives.\n\n Scheduled Task Creation Event The Scheduled Task Creation AI Engine Rule is designed to identify the creation and start of a scheduled task immediately after the execution of a PowerShell execution. This rule could generate a false-positive event. If this alert does fire communication, the systems administration team can rule out a false-positive event.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### udp.vbs launching PowerShell command The DN.ps1 Execution AI Engine rule is designed to identify the PowerShell command execution for starting the dn.ps1 PowerShell script. This rule will require command line execution reading capabilities from the endpoint. Using the Windows Sysmon log source, or a compatible endpoint monitoring solution, which can record command line executions is required. This rule is not likely to create false positive alerts.\n\n\n###### dn.ps1 Callout The DNS Request AI Engine rule is designed to identify the execution of PowerShell, followed by the outbound communication to the known OilRig domain ‘googlednsupdate.tk’. This AI Engine rule can be modified for future additionally identified domains associated  with the OilRig campaign. This alert is not likely to identify false positives.\n\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n###### While not the most sophisticated, the OilRig attacks are nonetheless effective. The attacker has created a simple, powerful backdoor using infected Excel files laced with malicious VBA, VBS, and PowerShell code. At this point, the attacker has primarily used Excel files attached to spear phishing emails for malicious payload delivery. However, this attack could be easily incorporated into many different file formats that could also be attached to phishing emails.\n\n\n###### Despite the fact only a few industries have been targeted by this campaign, it would be wise for security analysts to guard against similar attacks regardless of industry. This code has been publicly known and other threat actors could incoroporate it into their own campaigns. Alternatively, the OilRig campaign could move to other not-before-seen industries.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix A: Malware Sample Metadata\n\n###### The following appendix contains metadata and other information about each submitted sample for reference and correlation.
