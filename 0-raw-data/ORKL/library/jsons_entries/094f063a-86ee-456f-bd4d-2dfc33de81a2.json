This isn’t a new phenomenon. This is part of a pattern of behavior that\ndates back several years—a pattern that is likely to continue for some time to come.\n\nRansomware infections continue to have a significant impact on organizations, including—\nbut not limited to—disruptions to operations, theft of confidential information, monetary loss\ndue to ransom payout, and more. It’s why we feel it's imperative that we increase our efforts\nto raise awareness about existing and emerging ransomware variants.\n\nThis new Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the\nevolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against these\nvariants.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows**\n**Impacted parties: Microsoft Windows Users**\n\n**Impact: Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryption**\n\n**Severity level: High**\n\nThis latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Redeemer, Beamed, and\nAraicrypt ransomware families.\n\n## Redeemer Ransomware\n\nRedeemer is a ransomware variant that was first discovered in June 2021. It encrypts files\non a compromised machine and demands a ransom in Monero cryptocurrency (XMR) to\ndecrypt the affected files. As of this writing (July 29, 2022), there are four public versions of\nRedeemer ransomware; versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.7, and 2.0. This indicates that the Redeemer\nthreat actors have been applying constant effort to improve the ransomware.\n\nFigure 1. Change log for Redeemer ransomware version 1.0\n\nFigure 2. Change log for Redeemer ransomware versions 1.5 and 1.7\n\nFigure 3. Change log for Redeemer ransomware version 2.0\n\nFiles encrypted by Redeemer ransomware typically have a “.redeem” file extension. The\nmalware also leaves a ransom note in Read Me.TXT.\n\nFigure 4. Files encrypted by Redeemer ransomware and ransom note\n\nFigure 5. Redeemer ransomware’s ransom note\n\nRedeemer has its own web page on TOR that provides instructions on how to use the\nRedeemer ransomware and toolkit. The instructions are broken down into six sections.\n\n1. Part zero is for crypto usage and lists process names that affiliates should not use.\n2. Part one is how to build Redeemer ransomware, including generating a private build\n\nkey, setting a ransom amount in Monero, adding contact information, adding a\ncampaign ID, and enabling and disabling self-deletion.\n3. Part two states that the ransomware is designed to delete logs and shadow copies\n\ntwice, before and after the encryption process, and to leave a ransom note in all\ndirectories where affected files reside. This section warns affiliates that the ransomware\nmust be executed with administrator privilege or else it will not run. This indicates that\nRedeemer ransomware either uses social engineering to trick victims into running the\nransomware or uses exploits for vulnerabilities in software or hardware to elevate\nprivileges to do so. Note that the latter has not been observed.\n\n\n-----\n\n4. Part three describes how to communicate with victims. Affiliates are recommended to\n\nuse privacy-oriented services to negotiate with victims to avoid identifying the attacker’s\nIP. The Redeemer threat actors also advise against giving discounts to victims as they\nbelieve such an ask typically comes from professional negotiators.\n5. Part four is on file decryption, providing instructions on using the Affiliate Toolkit to\n\nobtain the Redeemer affiliate key using the Redeemer public key received from the\nvictim and the previously generated private build key (see part one). Affiliates will\nreceive a Redeemer master key for file decryption once the Redeemer affiliate key is\npassed to the developer and the decryption fee (20% of the ransom amount) is\ndeposited to the developer’s Monero wallet.\n6. Part five covers how victims run the Redeemer decrypter to recover the encrypted files.\n\nFigure 6. Affiliate instructions on the Redeemer page\n\nFigure 7. Files inside Redeemer version 2.0 package\n\nAs previously mentioned, the decryption fee is currently set at 20%, giving affiliates 80% of\nthe profit. The developer also provides a Tox chat address to communicate with affiliates.\n\nFigure 8.

Encrypted files have a “.beamed” file\nextension. It leaves a ransom note in “RIP YO DOCUMENTS.txt”, which contains the\nattacker’s Bitcoin address. The ransom fee is set at $200 worth of Bitcoin. As of this writing,\nno transaction has been observed in the Bitcoin wallet.\n\nFigure 9. Beamed ransomware’s “colourful” ransom note\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\n\n-----\n\nFortinet Customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected against known Beamed\nransomware variants by the following signature:\n\nMSIL/Filecoder.TA!tr\n\n## Araicrypt ransomware\n\nAraicrypt appears to be a variant of the Thanos ransomware family that encrypts files on a\nvictim’s machine. It leaves a ransom note in “READ_TO_RESTORE_YOUR_FILES.txt”. In\nthe ransom note, Araicrypt claims to have deleted shadow copies, which makes file recovery\ndifficult. It also claims to have stolen information from the victim, who is given 48 hours to\ncontact the attacker via email. The attacker threatens to publish the stolen data if the victim\nfails to make contact. Files encrypted by Araicrypt ransomware have a “.araicrypt” file\nextension.\n\nFigure 10. Arai ransomware’s ransom note\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet Customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected against known Arai\nransomware variants by the following signatures:\n\nMSIL/Filecoder.Thanos.A!tr\nMSIL/Filecoder_Thanos.A!tr.ransom\nMSIL/Filecoder_Thanos.B!tr\n\n## Best practices include not paying a ransom\n\nRansomware victims are cautioned against paying ransom by organizations such as CISA,\nNCSC, the [FBI, and HHS, partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware)\nrecovered. Ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional\norganizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit\nactivities that could potentially be illegal, according to a U.S. Department of Treasury's Office\n[of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory. The FBI has a Ransomware Complaint page,](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Ransomware)\nwhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via the Internet Crimes Complaint\nCenter (IC3).\n\n_[Learn more about Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs threat research and intelligence organization](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiguard-labs)_\n_[and the FortiGuard Security Subscriptions and Services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?tab=security-bundles&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=security-bundles)_\n\n\n-----",
