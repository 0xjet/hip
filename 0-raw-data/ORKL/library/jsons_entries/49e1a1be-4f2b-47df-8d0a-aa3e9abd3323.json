As one can imagine, that kind of access may be very attractive to bad actors –\n[and MSPs, the main driving force of RMM usage, have not escaped the targeting of](https://www.zdnet.com/article/at-least-13-managed-service-providers-were-used-to-push-ransomware-this-year/)\nransomware actors. Lately, KELA noticed RMM software being targeted as part of the\n**compromise portfolio of certain** [initial access brokers – either directly or via managed](https://ke-la.com/the-secret-life-of-an-initial-access-broker/)\nservice providers.\n\nA quick side trip, exploring the phrase “network access” as used by both KELA and threat\nactors, may be due. The term itself is very loosely defined; threat actors use it to describe\nmultiple different vectors, permission levels and entry points. One can get an intuitive sense\nof this by looking at the sub-forum dedicated to trading network access on Exploit, a major\nRussian-speaking forum:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs can be seen, actors are binding together multiple vectors and technology stacks under\nthe phrase “access” – from SQL injection to RDP access, everything goes. Not all network\naccesses are born equal, however: they vary in levels of sophistication needed to obtain the\naccess, as well as in operations that can be performed by the actors after establishing\npersistence.\n\nAs such, actors with different monetization TTPs may be interested in different access\n**types. For ransomware gangs, exfiltration of data and network-wide running of scripts is the**\ngoal – while for actors looking for PII, database access is king with endpoints being rendered\nuseless. This is why some cloud-based applications, or credentials to third-party services,\n[are a highly sought after commodity – while others may not be as interesting to actors.](https://ke-la.com/slacking-off-slack-and-the-corporate-attack-surface-landscape/)\n\nRecently, KELA has observed a case that is a perfect illustration of RMM access\n**becoming a part of the RaaS (ransomware-as-a-service) ecosystem – showcasing**\n[exactly why MSPs have become a prime target for actors.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ragnar-locker-ransomware-targets-msp-enterprise-support-tools/)\n\n## Straight from the Horse’s Mouth\n\n\n-----\n\n**In September 2020, a threat actor posted 36 accesses for sale on a Russian-speaking**\n**underground forum. The new accesses are being sold for a cumulative price of**\n**$98,400 (in addition, for some accesses, the threat actor asked to suggest a price).**\nPrior to this bunch of accesses, the actor was selling more than a dozen accesses in July,\nturning the total numbers to 53 accesses for a cumulative price of $153,850. So far, the actor\nmanaged to sell 10 accesses; they initially cost $33,800.\n\n_Description of the type of access offered for sale_\n\nBased on KELA’s analysis of multiple posts shared by the threat actor, the targeted RMM\n**software seems to be parts of the ManageEngine product suite developed by Zoho**\n**Corporation – and specifically Desktop Central .**\n\nExamining some of Desktop Central’s capabilities tells a pretty good story about why it would\nbe attractive to threat actors – and particularly for ransomware gangs. It allows multiple\noperations to be carried out on the network, including remote control of hosts and – maybe\n[most importantly – running custom scripts remotely on groups of endpoint devices.](https://www.manageengine.com/products/desktop-central/help/user_configuration/executing_custom_scripts.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n_A few of the Desktop Central features that may be attractive to ransomware actors (source:_\n_[ManageEngine)](https://www.manageengine.com/products/desktop-central/features.html)_\n\nWith multiple ransomware families depending on human-operated running of Powershell\nscripts, for example, it’s easy to understand why RMM access would be appealing: it can\nallow for network-wide ransomware deployment without having to bypass any pesky\nWindows network protections, serving as a perfect living-off-the-land technique in the cloud.\n\n**In two cases with the most expensive accesses offered by the threat actor, KELA**\n**managed to identify the victims and indirectly confirm they were using the software in**\n**question. The first target is a Turkish company with a revenue of $221 Million (the access**\ncost 1.5 BTC). The second victim is a Canadian corporation with a revenue of $338 Million,\nwhose access has been sold in a few hours – it was offered for 1 BTC.\n\n\n-----\n\n## But How?\n\nAfter establishing that Desktop Central seems to have been the vector to access obtained to\nover 30 organizations, the question is: how was the RMM compromised?\n\nGenerally speaking, two possible hypotheses exist:\n\n\n-----\n\n**1. An MSP hack: one (or more) MSP has been compromised, through which actors have**\nobtained access to RMM software installed in the clients’ environments – allowing direct\nnetwork access;\n\n**2. Direct targeting: organizations’ Desktop Central instances were compromised directly –**\nfor example, via phishing, credentials harvesting or social engineering.\n\nTrying to narrow down the options, KELA examined the prevalence of Desktop Central\n[intances on the internet as reflected by Shodan. With almost 900 servers traced at the time](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=http.title%3A%22manageengine+desktop+central%22)\nof writing this blog, the RMM platform does seem to make a decent target – providing a wide\nnet to cast for actors trying to obtain credentials for these cloud instances.\n\nExamining the actors’ victimology based on the data shared, it appears that while most of\n**the victims are US-based there’s still a wide variety of targeted geographies. The**\naffected companies, as claimed by the actor, come from the US, the UK, Canada, Spain,\nBrazil, Portugal, and other countries. They include organizations from the IT, education,\n\n\n-----\n\nconstruction, manufacturing, law, healthcare, and other sectors. He also offered a couple of\naccesses related to the government organizations, specifically, in the U.S. (Arkansas state)\nand Barbados.\n\nIntuitively speaking, this may suggest that the centralized MSP hack is less plausible\n**due to the geographic spread of victims (unless, of course, more than one MSP was**\ntargeted), tilting the odds for direct targeting or exploitation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Top countries for Desktop Central instances available over the public internet, as seen on Shodan_\n\nThis is not the first time Desktop Central is being targeted: a remote code execution\n[vulnerability (CVE-2020-10189) was reported to have been exploited in attacks designed to](https://www.securityweek.com/hackers-exploiting-recently-patched-manageengine-desktop-central-vulnerability)\ndrop malware in March 2020. While the vulnerability seems unrelated to the accessees\ndiscussed in this post (as they seem to employ legitimate credentials to access the\nsoftware), it still showcases the interest in RMM software as a vector.\n\n_Update: October 8, 2020_\n\n[Following this blog post and media exposure, the Zoho Corporation’s information security](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-sell-access-to-your-network-via-remote-management-apps/)\nteam proactively reached out to KELA in order to investigate the potential incidents. KELA\nwas able to identify several victims as described in the threat actors’ RMM sales posts – and\nprovided Zoho with the attributed victims; upon investigation, Zoho concluded that the\nidentified victims seem to have utilized weak credentials to their ManageEngine products,\nwhich seems to be the root cause for the compromise. A potential hypothesis made early in\nthe process, regarding the threat actor exploiting CVE-2020-10189 in order to create shadow\naccounts or persistent backdoors, was determined unlikely based on the victims\ninvestigated.\n\nA response summarizing the investigation by the Zoho team reads:\n\n\n-----\n\n_With the current evidence, we strongly suspect that the usage of weak credentials is the_\n_cause of the attack, so we have:_\n\n_1. Deployed live-changes that address the problem by preventing any future logins with the_\n_weak credentials._\n\n_2. Issued security guidance advisory to all our customers to help them ensure proper security_\n_measures are implemented in their installations._\n\nKELA will continue to monitor the actors’ activity and claimed victims in order to try and\nidentify further TTPs used for the compromises. Whether the root cause is indeed weak\ncredentials as concluded by Zoho, or may involve spear-phishing or other credential\nextraction methods, we recommend defenders to pay attention to the cloud attack surface\nexpanded by internet-facing applications – as they sure do seem to attract bad actors.\n\n\n-----",
