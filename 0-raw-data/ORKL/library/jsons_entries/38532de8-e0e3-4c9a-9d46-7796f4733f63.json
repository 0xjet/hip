Here's a sample under the microscope\n\n**[theregister.com/2022/03/22/arid-gopher-malware-deep-instinct/](https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/22/arid-gopher-malware-deep-instinct/)**\n\nJeff Burt\n\n**[Security](https://www.theregister.com/security/)**\n\n## Arid Gopher sticks its head out from its burrow\n\n[Jeff Burt Tue 22 Mar 2022 // 03:53 UTC](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Jeff-Burt)\n**6**\n\nThe folks at Deep Instinct say they have studied a Go-written variant of the malware used by\nthe Arid Viper cyber-crime ring.\n\nDeep Instinct, founded in 2015, says it uses deep learning to detect and block malware.\nWhile training a deep-learning model that's focused on identifying software nasties written in\nGo, the researchers uncovered an executable file built using the programming language,\nsubmitted it to the VirusTotal website, and found only six security vendors had the binary\nflagged as malicious.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther investigation uncovered two similar Go-written binaries. From these programs, we re\ntold, it became clear the team were looking at a variant of Micropsia. This malware was\nidentified in 2017 and is used exclusively by Arid Viper, an advanced persistent threat (APT)\ngroup believed to be based in Gaza and known as APT-C-23. Deep Instinct named the Gowritten malware Arid Gopher.\n\n\"This new variant is still being developed; all the three files share a common baseline, but\neach file contains unique code which is not present in the other files,\" Deep Instinct\n[researchers Simon Kenin and Asaf Gilboa wrote in an analysis this Monday. \"Beside the](https://www.deepinstinct.com/blog/arid-gopher-the-newest-micropsia-malware-variant)\nmain implant, our investigation revealed a 'helper' malware, also written in Go, and a secondstage malware which was downloaded from the C2 [command-and-control] server.\"\n\nEssentially, Arid Gopher has the same functionality of Arid Viper; it is simply written in the Go\nlanguage.\n\n\"This is also how we related it to Arid Viper,\" Moshe Hayun, Deep Instinct's threat intelligence\nteam leader, told The Register. \"We used code similarities and functionality similarities. This\nis how we found out it's the same actor, using the decompiler, reverse engineering, and\nlooking into the functionalities and how it does things.\"\n\nKenin told The Register that writing the code in Go was likely a way to bypass detection. It's\nnot unusual to see threat groups shift the programming language they use to keep malware\nunder the radar. In its [2022 Cyber Threat Landscape Report released in February, Deep](https://info.deepinstinct.com/cyber-threat-landscape-report?)\nInstinct said that in 2021 it saw a shift by gangs away from older languages like C and C++\nto newer ones, including Python and Go, which are easy to learn.\n\nAntivirus engines may be unfamiliar with the structure or identities of executables produced\nfrom these newer languages; a binary built from C++ may be in a malware database, but the\nbinary of a rewrite in Go may not be, buying its creators some extra time to avoid detection. It\ncould also be cyber-crooks are just keeping up with software development trends, tools, and\nlibraries.\n\nIn Arid Viper's case, its masterminds have used a range of programming languages, jumping\nfrom Pascal and Delphi to C++, Python, and now Go. What hasn't changed is how the\nmalware works or what it is designed to do.\n\n\"APTs, their sole purpose is to infiltrate important assets,\" Hayun said. \"I don't know if I have\nseen an APT transposing from so many languages, like Delphi [and] Pascal, but Go malware\nis kind of a trend now because it's a new language, it has a lot of open-source libraries, a lot\nof libraries like helper functions to collect information from the victim's computers and stuff\nlike that. I don't know how unique it is. APTs do that. Their models are out there in several\nlanguages. I don't recall anyone APT using these exact languages or transposing it to Go.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Deep Instinct, Arid Viper s malware targets computers running Microsoft\nWindows, and has been used primarily in the Middle East, with a specific focus on\nPalestinian targets. It has been linked in the past to Hamas, according to the researchers.\nThere also is an Android strain apparently used against Israeli targets, and last year\n[Facebook-owner Meta issued a report [PDF] that identified an iOS nasty developed by Arid](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Technical-threat-report-Arid-Viper-April-2021.pdf)\nViper.\n\nDeep Instinct outlined the Arid Gopher variants it uncovered. Arid Gopher V1 is written in Go\n1.16.5gs and includes code from libraries available from GitHub, which the researchers\nnoted \"saves the author time by not needing to write some features from scratch. It also adds\nsome degree of legitimacy because those libraries are not malicious, but the malware author\nabuses the libraries' capabilities for malicious purposes.\"\n\nThere are two versions of the Arid Gopher V2 variant that have been used since the\nbeginning of the year. Both samples were written in Go 1.17.4 and use some of the public\nlibraries from GitHub that are in V1. A key difference between the two is the content of the\nbenign documents they save on a victim's desktop, the team wrote. The variants are emailed\nto targets in .xz RAR archives, and unpack with a long filename to hopefully push their .exe\nextension out of sight. When successfully run, they infect the host Windows PC, open a\nbackdoor to a command-and-control server to receive further instructions, and drop a decoy\ndocument on the desktop and display it so that the victim thinks they've simply saved and\nopened an attached Word file and not malware.\n\nThe variants also continue Arid Viper's use of names of characters in popular TV shows in\ntheir domain names. In V1, the name Grace Fraser is used in a domain name. Grace Fraser\nis a character in the HBO series The Undoing. In V2, a name used is Pam Beesly, a\ncharacter from the sitcom The Office.\n\nGilboa and Kenin claim deep learning gives them an edge over rival cybersecurity vendors in\nfinding malicious code. The researchers wrote that some competitors rely on manually tuned\nheuristics, or manually selected features that are fed into classical machine-learning models,\nto determine if a file is malicious or legitimate. Other methods include running programs in a\nsandbox to get more information.\n\nDeep Instinct instead trains models to learn as they go.\n\n\"Researchers are manually going over samples and then are updating their signature\nmechanism,\" Hayun said. \"We do it a bit differently. We take huge amounts of data, so there\nis a really high probability that our deep learning models already saw something similar.\n\n\"They say, 'I saw something similar. I know that this and this and this will increase the\nprobability of something being malicious,' so the next time something a bit similar comes into\nthe model, it will say, 'I saw something similar like this. I will give it the highest quality to be\nthis as malicious.'\" ®\n\n\n-----\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\nBig Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation\n\nStudy claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules\n\n[Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Thomas-Claburn)\nAmazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public\nstatements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common\norganizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.\n\n[That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2022/05/26/tech-industry-groups-are-watering-down-attempts-at-privacy-regulation-one-state-at-a-time)\ncorporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown\nstate privacy bills.\n\nThe report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy\nlegislation and identified 445 lobbyists and lobbying firms working on behalf of Amazon,\nApple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, along with industry groups like TechNet and the\nState Privacy and Security Coalition.\n\n[Continue reading](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/27/big_tech_privacy/?td=keepreading-btm)\nSEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake\n\nMeanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors\n\n[Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Katyanna-Quach)\nAmerica's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed\nhis purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media\ncompany hangs in the balance.\n\n[A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he \"[did] not appear\"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000000000022003713/filename1.pdf)\n[to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter \"required 10 days](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/04/elon_musk_twitter/)\nfrom the date of acquisition,\" and asked him to provide more information.
