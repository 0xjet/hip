Dyreza was used to target customers of over 1000\nU.S. and U.K. banks and other companies during the peak of operations. Researchers at\n[Threat Geek and](http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/10/trickbot-the-dyre-connection.html) [MalwareBytes have already extensively covered general TrickBot](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/10/trick-bot-dyrezas-successor/amp/)\nfunctionality.\n\nDuring ASERT’s research, we uncovered a few new peculiarities as yet to be discussed,\nincluding links to Godzilla Loader and the ability to download and execute additional malware\npackages.\n\nFirst, when analyzing malware sample (all samples listed\nby MD5 hash) [3a55fd6b3f969b1324a1942af08e039e, we discovered links back to the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d66ccf3ba28b5016d0683854acfefcea9330d7a92da9c001307cf11a49fb9672/detection)\nsomewhat new Godzilla Loader.\n\nIn this case, Godzilla Loader (fc431f69760c598098f34eec337c8415) was used to install\nTrickBot from http://185.14.29[.]13/api.php. The login panel for the Command & Control (C2)\nserver appears at the URL admin.php as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Additional research on Virus Total shows this particular instance to be part of a spam](https://www.virustotal.com/)\ncampaign. Threat actors laced an email message with a malicious .scr executable that\ninstalled Godzilla Loader. The loader was used to subsequently download TrickBot. The\nmessage appears as such:\n\nSubject: You have received a new fax\n\nAttach: fax198-203-9153.scr\n\n[Interestingly enough, Godzilla Loader was used as the intermediary for both Bolek and](http://asert.arbornetworks.com/communications-bolek-trojan/)\n[Panda Bankers when threat actors first started distributing them. More information on](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/panda-banker-new-banking-trojan-hits-the-market)\n[Godzilla Loader functionality can be found here. T](http://www.kernelmode.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4349&p=28427&hilit=godzilla#p28427)\n\n**rickBot’s Download and Execute Command**\n\nAs referenced in the malware analyses above, TrickBot has a number of commands that use\nslightly different URLs. For its “download and execute” functionality, TrickBot uses the\nfollowing path template: /%s/%s/1/%s/ A completed URL looks something like:\n\n\n-----\n\nhXXps://138[.]201[.]44[.]28/tmt2/ADMINPC_W617601.F2F368CFEBB3F08115DB04EE5697EBBC/1/\nPB1qOLElSsGUg45wH3JyIKEMGzl60MB/\n\nThis path can be broken down into the following pieces:\n\n“gtag” – group tag\nClient ID\nCommand number\n16 to 32 random letters and digits\n\nThe response from the C2 server will look similar to:\n\nThe response can be split into three pieces using “\\r\\n” as a delimiter. The first piece is a “/”\ndelimited header which echoes back a couple of the request pieces along with a few\nadditional items: /42/tmt2/ADMINPC_W617601.23BD67ECD8AEDEC8FEAE8253B2C09D03/\nXbuepYhfjAwVBawBh1PvDHyHKZmB49/41268/ At the end is a trailer which seems to\nalways be “1234567890”. In the middle is base64-encoded data. Decoding this base64 data\nresults in the following type of output:\n\nThis is a binary structure that can be broken up into the following pieces:\n\nUnknown DWORD\n\n\n-----\n\n32-byte SHA256 digest\nURL length (DWORD)\nURL (Unicode)\nSignature (Remaining bytes)\n\n[hXXp://15616[.]merahost[.]ru/851321365.bin Which links to a Pony Loader variant known as](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/12135a638ded89b32f3028167da38f4968a00f17c5c61fa90b5ee4ed5d69bf25/analysis/)\n[“Fox Stealer”. In this case, the Pony Loader variant was utilizing 85.132.136[.]5 as the C2.](http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2016/09/fox-stealer-another-pony-fork.html)\nThe admin panel login on this site is seen below. There is not enough evidence to conclude if\nthreat actors behind TrickBot are using Pony Loader or are simply enabling access for\nadditional threat actors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nASERT analysts have taken a look at additional functionality and links between TrickBot and\nadditional threats. Reports have suggested a mix of campaign methodologies were used to\ninitially distribute TrickBot, including use of Rig Exploit Kit and malicious spam delivery. In\ngeneral, if the threat actors are associated with former Dyreza activities, they have not\nreinvigorated the overall breadth of targeting observed within the original Dyreza campaigns.\nThreat actors limited initial exposure and breadth, targeting a small amount of Australian\nbanks. Regardless, time will tell if these actors decide to match the overall expanse of\nDyreza or limit their operations in hopes of staving off additional police interactions.\n\nPosted In\n\nAnalysis\nForensics\nInteresting Research\nMalware\nReverse Engineering\nSpyware\nthreat analysis\n\n\n-----\n\n## Subscribe\n\n_Sign up now to receive the latest notifications and updates from NETSCOUT's ASERT._\n\n\n-----",
