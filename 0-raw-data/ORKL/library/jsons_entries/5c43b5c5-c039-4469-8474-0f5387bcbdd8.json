    "plain_text": "# New activity from Russian actor Nobelium\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/10/24/new-activity-from-russian-actor-nobelium/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/10/24/new-activity-from-russian-actor-nobelium/?ocid=usoc_TWITTER_M365_spl100002625922692)**\n\nOctober 25, 2021\n\nToday, we’re sharing the latest activity we’ve observed from the Russian nation-state actor\nNobelium. This is the same actor behind the cyberattacks targeting SolarWinds customers in\n2020 and which the U.S. government and others have identified as being part of Russia’s\nforeign intelligence service known as the SVR.\n\nNobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by\ntargeting organizations integral to the global IT supply chain. This time, it is attacking a\ndifferent part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that\ncustomize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their\ncustomers. We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that\nresellers may have to their customers’ IT systems and more easily impersonate an\norganization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers. We\nbegan observing this latest campaign in May 2021 and have been notifying impacted\npartners and customers while also developing new technical assistance and guidance for the\nreseller community. Since May, we have notified more than 140 resellers and technology\nservice providers that have been targeted by Nobelium. We continue to investigate, but to\ndate we believe as many as 14 of these resellers and service providers have been\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised. Fortunately, we have discovered this campaign during its early stages, and we\nare sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers, technology providers, and\ntheir customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful.\n\nThese attacks have been a part of a larger wave of Nobelium activities this summer. In fact,\nbetween July 1 and October 19 this year, we informed 609 customers that they had been\nattacked 22,868 times by Nobelium, with a success rate in the low single digits. By\ncomparison, prior to July 1, 2021, we had notified customers about attacks from all nationstate actors 20,500 times over the past three years.\n\nThis recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic\naccess to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for\nsurveilling – now or in the future – targets of interest to the Russian government. While we\nare sharing details here about the most recent activity by Nobelium, the Microsoft Digital\nDefense Report, published earlier this month, highlights continued attacks from other nationstate actors and cybercriminals. In line with these attacks, we are notifying our customers\nwhen they are targeted or compromised by those actors.\n\nThe attacks we’ve observed in the recent campaign against resellers and service providers\nhave not attempted to exploit any flaw or vulnerability in software but rather used well-known\n[techniques, like password spray and phishing, to steal legitimate credentials and gain](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/23/protecting-organization-password-spray-attacks/)\nprivileged access. We have learned enough about these new attacks, which began as early\nas May this year, that we can now provide actionable information which can be used to\ndefend against this new approach.\n\nWe’ve also been coordinating with others in the security community to improve our\nknowledge of, and protections against, Nobelium’s activity, and we’ve been working closely\nwith government agencies in the U.S. and Europe. While we are clear-eyed that nationstates, including Russia, will not stop attacks like these overnight, we believe steps like the\ncybersecurity [executive order in the U.S., and the greater coordination and information](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)\nsharing we’ve seen between industry and government in the past two years, have put us all\nin a much better position to defend against them.\n\nWe have long maintained and evolved the security requirements and policies we enforce\nwith service providers that sell or support Microsoft technology. For example, in September\n2020, we updated contracts with our resellers to expand Microsoft’s abilities and rights to\naddress reseller security incidents and to require that resellers implement specific security\nprotections for their environments, such as restricting Partner Portal access and requiring\nthat resellers enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) in accessing our cloud portals and\nunderlying services, and we will take the necessary and appropriate steps to enforce these\nsecurity commitments. We continue to assess and identify new opportunities to drive greater\nsecurity throughout the partner ecosystem, recognizing the need for continuous\n\n\n-----\n\nimprovement. As a result of what we have learned over the past several months, we are\nworking to implement improvements that will help better secure and protect the ecosystem,\nespecially for the technology partners in our supply chain:\n\nAs noted above, in September 2020, we rolled out MFA to access Partner Center and\nto use delegated administrative privilege (DAP) to manage a customer environment\nOn October 15, we launched a program to provide two years of an Azure Active\nDirectory Premium plan for free that provides extended access to additional premium\nfeatures to strengthen security controls\nMicrosoft threat protection and security operations tools such as Microsoft Cloud App\nSecurity (MCAS), M365 Defender, Azure Defender and Azure Sentinel have added\ndetections to help organizations identify and respond to these attacks\nWe are currently piloting new and more granular features for organizations that want to\nprovide privileged access to resellers\nWe are piloting improved monitoring to empower partners and customers to manage\nand audit their delegated privileged accounts and remove unnecessary authority\nWe are auditing unused privileged accounts and working with partners to assess and\nremove unnecessary privilege and access\n\n[Today, we are also releasing technical guidance that can help organizations protect](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/?p=99621)\nthemselves against the latest Nobelium activity we’ve observed as the actor has honed its\n[techniques as well as guidance for partners.](https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/)\n\nThese are just the immediate steps that we’ve taken and, in the coming months, we will be\nengaging closely with all of our technology partners to further improve security. We will make\nit easier for service providers of all sizes to access our most advanced services for managing\nsecure log-in, identity and access management solutions for free or at a low cost.\n\nAs we said in May, progress must continue. At Microsoft, we will continue our efforts across\nall these issues and will continue to work across the private sector, with the U.S.\nadministration and with all other interested governments to make this progress.\n\nTags: [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [Microsoft Digital Defense Report,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/microsoft-digital-defense-report/) [Nobelium](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/nobelium/)\n\n\n-----",
