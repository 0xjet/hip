The second is to scare the victims into paying a ransom because\nthe gang will leak the data.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Searching for valuable data\n\nYesterday, [MalwareHunterTeam shared a PowerShell script with BleepingComputer used](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nby the Pysa ransomware operation to search for and exfiltrate data from a server.\n\nThis script is designed to scan each drive for data folders whose names match certain\nstrings on a device. If a folder matches the search criteria, the script will upload the folder's\nfiles to a remote drop server under the threat actor's control.\n\nOf particular interest are the 123 keywords that the script searches for, which give us a\nglimpse into what the ransomware gang considers valuable.\n\nAs we would expect, the script seeks out files related to the companies financials or\npersonal information, such as audit, banking information, login credentials, tax forms,\nstudent information, social security numbers, and SEC filings.\n\nHowever, it also looks for more intriguing keywords that could be particularly harmful to a\ncompany if leaked, such as folders containing the words 'crime', 'investigation', 'fraud',\n'bureau', 'federal', 'hidden', 'secret', 'illegal', and 'terror.'\n\nThe full list of 123 keywords targeted by the threat actors' script is listed in the table below.\n\n941 confident Info RRHH\n\n1040 Crime insider saving\n\n1099 claim Insurance scans\n\n8822 Terror investigation sec\n\n9465 Confidential*Disclosure IRS secret\n\n401K contact ITIN security\n\n4506-T contr K-1 studen\n\nABRH CPF letter seed\n\nAudit CRH List Signed\n\nAddres Transact Login sin\n\nagreem DDRH mail soc\n\nAgreement*Disclosure Demog NDA SS#\n\nARH Detail Numb SS-4\n\nAssignment Disclosure*Agreement Partn SSA\n\n\n-----\n\nbalanc Disclosure*Confidential passport SSN\n\nbank DRH passwd Staf\n\nBank*Statement emplo password statement\n\nBenef Enrol pay Statement*Bank\n\nbilling federal payment SWIFT\n\nbudget Finan payroll tax\n\nbureau finance person Taxpayer\n\nBrok Form Phone unclassified\n\ncard fraud privacy Vend\n\ncash government privat W-2\n\nCDA hidden pwd w-4\n\nchecking hir Recursos*Humanos W-7\n\nclandestine HR report W-8BEN\n\ncompilation Human Resour w-9\n\ncompromate i-9 resurses*human W-9S\n\nconcealed illegal RHO\n\nconfid important routing\n\nIt does not make sense to change your folder names, so they do not include these strings,\nas the threat actors will likely perform manual sweeps of data.\n\nHowever, knowing what types of data a ransom gang is searching for gives you a better\nindication of how ransomware gangs will attempt to extort their victims.\n\nPysa is not the only one searching for particular files after breaching a network.\n\nEarlier this month, an angry Conti affiliate leaked the training material for the ransomware\noperation.\n\nThis [training material told affiliates to immediately search for data containing the following](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-prioritizes-revenue-and-cyberinsurance-data-theft/)\nkeywords after they gained control of a Windows domain controller.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ncyber\npolicy\ninsurance\nendorsement\nsupplementary\nunderwriting\nterms\nbank\n2020\n2021\nStatement\n\n```\nOnce again, this illustrates how vital data theft is to a ransomware attack and how important\nit is to safeguard it adequately.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Shutterfly discloses data breach after Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-discloses-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[PYSA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/pysa/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Theft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/theft/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
