Posted in Malware Reports Viewed](https://stopmalvertising.com/malware-reports/)\n43290 times\n\nA new ransomware called ZeroLocker has surfaced. The files are encrypted with AES (*)\nencryption.\n\nCurrently the threat is considered as the most destructive ransomware we have seen to\ndate.\n\nZeroLocker does not only target data files; it encrypts ALL files on the hard drive, including\nexecutables, with AES encryption unless they are located in certain folders or larger than\n20 MegaBytes.\n\nThe folders exempt from encryption are the ones containing the following keywords:\nWindows, WINDOWS, Program Files, ZeroLocker and Desktop. Encrypted files will have\n.encrypted appended to their filename.\n\nZeroLocker performs several outbound connections to 5.199.171.47, a VPs located in Skri\nLanka.\n\nWhen the threat has finished encrypting the files, it will run the\nC:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\CIPHER.EXE /W:C:\\ command in order to overwrite all deleted\ndata on the hard drive. Doing so makes it impossible to use recovery tools to restore files.\n\nThe main issue with ZeroLocker resides in the fact that when it uploads the decryption key\nto the server, the C2 returns a 404 not found because the requested page doesn’t exist on\nthe server.\n\nTherefore the key isn’t stored in any database or file for later recovery. The only way to\nrecover the key would be to manually filter through the HTTP access logs if they still exist.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis coding mistake on behalf of the developer essentially renders the encrypted computer\ncompletely useless as the victim is unable to retrieve the decryption key even after paying\nthe ransom.\n\nZeroLocker is considered as very destructive especially for companies that have custom\nsoftware installed under normal paths.\n\nCurrently the infection doesn’t delete the Windows System Restore points so files can be\nrestored using a program like Shadow Explorer or Windows built-in Previous Version. This\ncould change at any stage of course.\n\nPayment is only accepted in Bitcoins. The initial ransom is $300, after 5 days the price will\nincrease to $600 and after 10 days the victim will have to pay $1000.\n\n**_Source:_** _[Bleeping Computer](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/544555/zerolocker-a-new-destructive-encrypting-ransomware/)_\n\n[The first instance of ZeroLocker was discovered on a French forum assisting people with](http://www.commentcamarche.net/forum/affich-30620502-zerolocker-recuperer-mes-fichiers-cryptes-par-un-ransomware)\nmalware removal on August 8, 2014.\n\n**ZeroLocker**\n\nOverview of functions.\n\n[The author didn't use AES encryption but used the RijndaelManaged class from the](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) .NET\nFramework.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe random number generator is seeded Envionment.TickCount, a 32-bit signed integer\ncontaining the amount of time in milliseconds that has passed since the last time the\ncomputer was started. The strength of the password is less than 32-bit.\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon execution the threat will:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Create a folder called C:\\ZeroLocker\n2. Perform the following outbound connection and save the binary as\n\nC:\\ZeroLocker\\ZERORESCUE.EXE\nGET /patriote/sansviolence\n\n3. A corresponding registry entry is created so that ZERORESCUE.EXE runs each time\n\nthe computer starts.\n4. Retrieve the Bitcoin address used to pay the ransom and save it as\n\nC:\\ZeroLocker\\ADDRESS.DAT\n\nGET /zConfig/171386\n\n1CkwfDadjXPhp3XrUU5J8hQhUtbecH7t1N\n5. Upload the decryption key to the server. The request returns a 404.\n\nGET /zImprimer/[ID based upon MAC-ADDRESS]-[PASSWORD]-[BITCOIN\nADDRESS]\n\n6. Encrypt the files on the hard drive. For each encrypted file the original file is deleted.\n7. Perform the following outbound connection and save the response as\n\nC:\\ZeroLocker\\LOG.DAT\nGET /enc/1\n\n8. Launch an instance of C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\CIPHER.EXE with the following\n\ncommand line parameters:\ncipher.exe\" /w:c:\\\n\n\n-----\n\n9. Reboot the compromised computer using the following command:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\shutdown.exe\" /r /t 0 /f\n\n10. Upon reboot the ransomware notice is displayed via\n\nC:\\ZeroLocker\\ZERORESCUE.EXE. Clicking the \"Decrypt Files\" button opens an\ninternet connection with the VPS. Unfortunately the request returns a 404 rendering\ndecryption impossible even after paying the ransom. A message informs the victim\nthat the payment hasn’t been received or processed yet and to try again later as it\ntakes up to 24h to activate the key.\nGET /[ID based upon MAC-ADDRESS]/key\n\n\n-----\n\nGlobal overview.\n\n\n-----\n\nID based upon MAC ADDRESS\n\n\n-----\n\n**Samples Analysed**\n\nAt the time of the analysis on August 18, 2014 we were aware of the following MD5\nhashes:\n\n[bd0a3c308a6d3372817a474b7c653097: TimeDateStamp: Tue Aug 05 14:27:06](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d4c62215df74753371db33a19a69fccdc4b375c893a4b7f8b30172710fbd4cfa/analysis/)\n2014\n[3772a3deeb781803a907ed36ee10681d: TimeDateStamp: Wed Aug 06 11:01:48](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/e292cbe7ddbc036009d7ef0deaab49d12005c9267e12a338bbba7782925ef1a6/analysis/)\n2014\n\nBoth samples contain the following compile leftovers:\n\nc:\\users\\george\\desktop\\projects\\zerolocker\\testing stuff\\testing stuff\\obj\\debug\\task\nmanager.pdb\n\n[The actor behind ZeroLocker is also associated with several Bitcoin Miners.](https://www.virustotal.com/en/ip-address/5.199.171.47/information/)\n\nTags:\n\n[AES](https://stopmalvertising.com/tag/aes.html)\n[Ransomware](https://stopmalvertising.com/tag/ransomware.html)\n[RijndaelManaged](https://stopmalvertising.com/tag/rijndaelmanaged.html)\n[ZeroLocker](https://stopmalvertising.com/tag/zerolocker.html)\n\n[If our research has helped you, please consider making a donation through PayPal.](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=4SV5GCQMUP2RL)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cryptowall: Behind The Scenes](https://stopmalvertising.com/malware-reports/cryptowall-behind-the-scenes.html)\nEarlier this week we intercepted several unsolicited emails with the subject\nline \"Voice Mail\".
