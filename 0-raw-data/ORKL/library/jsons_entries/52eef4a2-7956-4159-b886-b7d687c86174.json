Recorded Future has found that\nprocurement documents associated with various Chinese government entities and stateowned enterprises have referenced the attack, with several documents explicitly calling for\ncybersecurity capabilities to counter or simulate such an attack. Likewise, cybersecurity\nresearchers associated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), state-run research\norganizations, and other such entities have discussed the implications of the incident in their\nongoing technical research, highlighting the national security relevance of protecting critical\ninfrastructure and the prominence of this infrastructure as a target in interstate conflict.\nTogether, these sources suggest that relevant parties in China recognize the conceptual\nsignificance of the 2015 attack on Ukraine’s grid and are very likely factoring lessons from\nthe incident (such as the acute need to defend critical infrastructure against state-sponsored\ncyber threats) into their cybersecurity planning. The evidence presented in this report\nsuggests that the Chinese authorities are almost certainly watching and learning from\n[Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and any accompanying cyber activity.](https://www.cfr.org/blog/tracking-cyber-operations-and-actors-russia-ukraine-war)\n\n## Cyberattacks on Ukraine’s Power Grid\n\nOn December 23, 2015, a cyberattack against Ukraine’s grid [targeted 3 regional electric](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/IR-ALERT-H-16-056-01)\npower distribution companies and disrupted the supply of power to 225,000 customers.\n[Reporting on the incident described it as the “first known successful cyber intrusion to knock](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35667989)\na power grid offline”. Another [cyberattack hit Ukraine’s grid in 2016, knocking out a portion of](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/CRASHOVERRIDE.pdf)\nKyiv’s power. In October 2020, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) [charged several officers](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and)\nin Unit 74455 of Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) in connection with the attacks\non Ukraine’s power grid and other Sandworm Team activity. According to the US DOJ, these\n\n\n-----\n\nGRU officers carried out destructive malware attacks against Ukraine s electric power grid,\nMinistry of Finance, and State Treasury Service, using malware known as BlackEnergy,\nIndustroyer, and KillDisk” from December 2015 through December 2016.\n\n## Chinese Government and State-Owned Enterprise Interest in the 2015 Attack\n\nProcurement documents from the past several years reveal that government entities and\nstate-owned enterprises in China have almost certainly incorporated lessons from the 2015\nUkraine attack (and possibly later incidents) into their cybersecurity planning. These\norganizations have demonstrated both abstract interest in the attack, naming it as an\nexample of the current cyber threat landscape, and specific interest in seeking the capability\nto simulate or otherwise counter the tactics, techniques, and procedures used to target\nUkraine’s grid. Instances that Recorded Future identified include:\n\nIn March 2022, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) Natural Resources\nRemote Sensing Institute (广西壮族自治区自然资源遥感院) published a tender for an\n“AI [artificial intelligence] high-performance data solution server”. The GZAR Natural\nResources Remote Sensing Institute is subordinate to the GZAR Department of\nNatural Resources. A technical requirements list attached to this tender states that the\nserver should have third-party (unspecified) antivirus software with the capability to\ntrace advanced threats such as the “Ukraine power cut incident”.\n[In September 2020, Guangdong Province Wind Power Generation Co., Ltd. (广东省风](https://archive.ph/75ODY)\n力发电有限公司) released a tender for a “wind farm power monitoring and control\nsystem grade protection 2.0 compliance reform” project. Guangdong Province Wind\nPower Generation is a state-owned enterprise. The document references the 2015\nattack on Ukraine’s grid as an example of a major information security threat to critical\ninfrastructure.\n[In November 2019, the Suzhou City Public Security Bureau (苏州市公安局) released a](https://archive.ph/VJ7Mn)\ntender for “antivirus gateway and antivirus handling services”. The document discusses\nthe growing importance of digital infrastructure and the protection of this infrastructure,\nreferencing cyberattacks such as one of the attacks on Ukraine’s power grid. The\ndocument also mentions that China’s Golden Shield Project — an extensive online\n[surveillance capability run by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) — has a “national](https://books.google.com/books/about/China_s_Golden_Shield.html?id=S9rP0A2q14UC)\nvirus early warning and reporting management mechanism”.\n[In September 2019, China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd. (中国南方电网有限责任公司)](https://archive.ph/zJwdh)\nreleased a tender for “power monitoring and control system network security intelligent\nanalysis application V1.0 construction project technical services”. China Southern\nPower Grid is a state-owned enterprise. The document references the 2015 attack\nagainst Ukraine’s grid as an example of the growing threat against grid control\nsystems.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In March 2019, the Shenzhen City Information Security Testing and Evaluation Center](https://archive.ph/YXpdK)\n(深圳市信息安全测评中心) published requirements for an “industrial internet attack and\ndefense exercise platform”. The document identifies the capability to “simulate the\n2015 Ukraine power grid security incident” as one of the requirements for the project’s\n“industrial control power attack tool kit”.\n\nIn addition to paying attention to the 2015 attack, certain Chinese state-owned enterprises\nlikely have a more direct interest in grid security in Ukraine. For instance, Ukraine’s\n[Donbasenergo reportedly contracted Dongfang Electric Corporation (中国东方电气集团有限](https://de.com.ua/en/structure-units)\n[公司) in 2018 for work on the](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-energy-china-idAFL8N1YQ1CM) [Sloviansk thermal power plant, with the upgraded units initially](https://de.com.ua/en/news/nocategory/view/za_11_mesjacev_2020_g._slavtes_vyrabotala_2_784_105_tys._kvtch_elektroenergii)\nprojected to start producing power in 2022 or 2023. Similarly, [China Longyuan Power Group](https://archive.ph/5KWWz)\n(龙源电力集团股份有限公司) reportedly “has a 76.6-megawatt wind power project in Yuzhne\non the country's Black Sea coast in the Southwest, which started operation last year as the\n[company's first wind power project in Europe”, according to state media. Likewise, a January](https://archive.ph/fcd8g)\n[2020 procurement document shows that China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC)](https://archive.ph/kXipV)\nEnvironmental Protection Industry Co., Ltd. (中核环保产业有限公司) was seeking to station\nengineers on a long-term basis in locations like Kramatorsk, Ukraine, and Saint Petersburg,\nRussia.\n\n## References to the 2015 Attack in Chinese Cybersecurity Research\n\nVarious cybersecurity researchers affiliated with the PLA, state-run research organizations,\nand other such entities in China have also recently discussed the implications of the 2015\n[attack on Ukraine’s power grid — as well as the implications of subsequent cyberattacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38573074)\nagainst Ukraine’s [critical infrastructure. This research does not necessarily reflect official](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/)\nPLA, Chinese government, or Chinese Communist Party (CCP) institutional positions but\ndoes offer a degree of insight into how specialists positioned within these institutions have\nreacted to (and are continuing grapple with) the 2015 Ukraine attack and other associated\nincidents. In particular, researchers stress the national security implications of the 2015\nattack and highlight how cyberattacks against critical infrastructure are now a feature of\ninterstate conflict. Recent examples include the following:\n\nIn the February 2022 issue of the Journal of _Beijing University of Aeronautics and_\n_Astronautics (北京航空航天大学学报), researchers associated with the State Grid_\nHenan Electric Power Research Institute (国网河南省电力公司电力科学研究院) and\n[PLA Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) Information Engineering University (中国人民](https://unitracker.aspi.org.au/universities/information-engineering-university-2/)\n解放军战略支援部队信息工程大学) describe the 2015 Ukraine attack as the first\ninstance of a “hacker penetration” leading to a large-scale power outage incident and\nargue that “how to ensure the security and stable operations of power grid control\nsystems has already become a major research issue for each country’s protection of\nnational security”. The authors use this assessment to frame their research on smart\ngrid network threat evaluation.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the January 2022 issue of Network Security Technology & Application (网络安全技术\n与应用), researchers from [Purple Mountain Laboratories (网络通信与安全紫金山实验](https://archive.ph/WIddj)\n室) and PLASSF Information Engineering University mention the 2015 Ukraine grid\nattack alongside other incidents as proof of the growing threat against industrial control\nsystems across the globe. The authors use this assessment to frame their research on\n[industrial control system honeypots.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8858431)\nIn the November 2021 issue of the Journal of Computer Research and Development\n[(计算机研究与发展), authors affiliated with the Harbin Institute Technology](https://unitracker.aspi.org.au/universities/harbin-institute-of-technology/)\nCybersecurity Research Institute (哈尔滨工业大学网络空间安全研究院), China\nInformation Technology Security Evaluation Center (CNITSEC; 中国信息安全测评中心),\nand other organizations referenced the 2015 cyberattack on Ukraine’s power grid as\nclear evidence of industrial control networks having become a major target in interstate\nconflict. The authors use this assessment to frame their research on industrial control\nnetwork multi-mode attack detection and evaluation.\nIn the February 2019 issue of Systems Engineering and Electronics (系统工程与电子技\n[术), researchers associated with the Air Force Engineering University School of](https://unitracker.aspi.org.au/universities/air-force-engineering-university)\nInformation and Navigation (空军工程大学信息与导航学院) and PLA Unit 93801 (中国\n人民解放军93801部队) describe cyberattacks against Ukraine’s computer networks and\npower grid as examples of incidents driving increasing research interest in the stability\nand security of “multiple elements state cyberspace”. The authors use this assessment\nto frame their research on the simulation of risk propagation in “multiple elements\nmilitary state cyberspace”.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe evidence presented in this report suggests that government entities, state-owned\nenterprises, and cybersecurity researchers in China recognize the significance of Russia’s\nattacks on Ukraine’s power grid and are working to defend China’s critical infrastructure\nagainst similar attacks, including in the context of interstate tensions or conflict. While all of\nthe sources reviewed in this report discuss defensive measures, Chinese strategists very\n[likely view offensive and defensive cyber activity as two sides of the same coin. Moreover,](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/CASI/Display/Article/2485204/plas-science-of-military-strategy-2013/)\n[Recorded Future previously observed China-linked threat activity group RedEcho targeting](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/)\n[India’s power sector during the 2020 India-China border tensions, a real-world demonstration](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/india-china-border-clashes.html)\nof China’s willingness to target other countries’ critical infrastructure. As such, not only are\nrelevant parties in China using lessons from Russia’s cyber activity in Ukraine to inform\ncybersecurity planning, but these entities might also be drawing insights related to offensive\ncyber planning.\n\n\n-----",
