However, it is being abused\nby many threat actors because it allows external control over specific systems.\n\nUnlike backdoors and RATs (Remote Access Trojans), which are mostly based on command\nlines, remote control tools (Remote Administration Tools) place emphasis on userfriendliness, so they offer remote desktops, also known as GUI environments. Even though\nthey may not have been developed with malicious intent, if they are installed on infected\nsystems, they can be used for malicious purposes by threat actors, such as for the\ninstallation of additional malware or information extortion.\n\nAs most remote control tools are used by countless users unlike other backdoors, it is easy\nfor them to be recognized as normal programs. Thus, they have the advantage of allowing\nattackers to use remote control tools, which are normal programs, to bypass the detection of\nsecurity software, while simultaneously enabling domination over the infected system in a\nGUI environment.\n\nThe following ASEC blog post covers cases where various remote control tools such as\nAnyDesk, TeamViewer, Ammyy Admin, and Tmate were used in attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ASEC analysis team recently found that the NetSupport RAT malware is being\ndistributed from a phishing page disguised as one for a Pokemon card game. Additionally,\nbecause it was not distributed in a form used for normal purposes but rather in a form\ndesigned for the threat actor to control the infected system, this blog will refer to it as\n“NetSupport RAT.” NetSupport RAT has been consistently used by threat actors and is still in\nuse even in recent days. It’s distributed via spam emails or phishing pages disguised as\nthose for original programs.\n\nThe following is the phishing page disguised as one for a Pokemon card game, and you can\nsee the “Play on PC” button down below. When the user clicks this button to install the game,\ninstead of the Pokemon card game, NetSupport RAT is downloaded.\n\nFigure 1. Forged Pokemon card game page\n\nThe downloaded file has both a disguised icon and version information, so users are prone\nto mistaking this for a game program and running it.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Malware disguised as a Pokemon card game\n\nThe malware is an installer malware developed with InnoSetup. When executed, it creates a\nfolder in the %APPDATA% path and creates hidden NetSupport RAT-related files before\nexecuting them. It also creates a shortcut in the Startup folder, allowing the malware to be\nrun even after a reboot. client32.exe, the ultimately executed file in the process tree below, is\nthe NetSupport Manager client.\n\nFigure 3. Process tree of NetSupport RAT\n\nWhile it could be said that the installed NetSupport-related programs themselves are normal\nprograms, we can see that the threat actor’s C&C server address is included in the\n“client32.ini” configuration file, as shown below. When NetSupport is executed, it reads this\nconfiguration file, access and establishes a connection to the threat actor’s NetSupport\nserver, and then allows the operator to control the infected system.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Installed NetSupport files and the configuration file\n\nFigure 5. Packet data of NetSupport RAT\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile relevant files were being examined with our ASD (AhnLab Smart Defense)\ninfrastructure and VirusTotal, we identified a different phishing page with the same format as\na fake Pokemon card game page. Each phishing page has been distributing multiple\nNetSupport RAT Dropper malware since around December 2022. Moreover, while the files\nthemselves are all different, they all include the same C&C server address in the “client32.ini”\nconfiguration file.\n\nAmong the ones uploaded to VirusTotal, there were malware samples with icons disguised\nas Visual Studio, and just like the original program, NetSupport RAT is installed in the path\n%APPDATA%\\Developer\\. From this, we can infer that the threat actor is using normal\nprograms other than the Pokemon game to distribute malware.\n\nFigure 6. NetSupport RAT dropper disguised as Visual Studio\n\nThere was also a type that creates the file “csvs.exe” disguised as a normal Windows\nprogram, svchost.exe, instead of installing the NetSupport client, “client32.exe” in the\ninstallation directory. While the icon and file size are different, the internal routine or PDB\ninformation shows that this is a “client32.exe” file modified by the threat actor to bypass\ndetection.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. client32.exe seen to have been modified by the threat actor\n\nNetSupport RAT is being used by various threat actors. Major cases show that they are\nrecently being distributed through spam emails disguised as those for invoices, shipment\n[documents, and purchase orders.[1] Additionally, in the second half of the year, there was a](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1608185209329008641)\ncase where users were led to install the malware themselves from a phishing page disguised\n[as an update page for a software called SocGholish.[2]](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/09/21/netsupport-rat-distributed-via-socgholish/)\n\nWhen NetSupport RAT is installed, the threat actor can gain control over the infected system.\nFeatures supported by NetSupport by default include not only remote screen control but also\nsystem control features such as screen capture, clipboard sharing, collecting web history\ninformation, file management, and command execution. This means that the threat actor can\nperform various malicious behaviors such as extorting user credentials and installing\nadditional malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Features supported by NetSupport\n\nRecently, threat actors have been abusing remote control tools used by various users such\nas NetSupport in their attacks. When infected with such remote control malware, the system\nis overtaken by the threat actor and becomes subject to damages such as information\nextortion and additional malware installation.\n\nWhen installing externally sourced software, users are advised to purchase or download\nthem from their official websites and refrain from opening attachments in suspicious emails.\nUsers should also apply the latest patch to programs such as their OS and internet browsers\nand update V3 to the latest version to prevent malware infection in advance.\n\n**File Detection**\n\n– Dropper/Win.NetSupport.C5345365 (2022.12.30.01)\n\n– Malware/Win.Generic.C5339867 (2022.12.23.03)\n\n– Malware/Win.Generic.C5335414 (2022.12.17.01)\n\n– Malware/Win.Generic.C5333592 (2022.12.15.01)\n\n– Malware/Win.Malware-gen.C5331507 (2022.12.13.02)\n\n– Trojan/Win.NetSupport.C5345361 (2022.12.30.01)\n\n– Backdoor/Text.NetSupport (2022.12.30.02)\n\n**IOC**\n\n**MD5**\n\n– 097051905db43d636c3f71f3b2037e02 : NetSupport RAT dropper\n(PokemonBetaGame.exe)\n\n– 1dc87bfb3613d605c9914d11a67e2c94 : NetSupport RAT dropper disguised as a Pokemon\ncard game\n\n– 5e6b966167c7fd13433929e774f038ee : NetSupport RAT dropper disguised as a Pokemon\ncard game\n\n– a9dba73b0cf1c26008fc9203684c6c22 : NetSupport RAT dropper disguised as a Pokemon\ncard game\n\n– adbe1069f82a076c48f79386812c1409 : NetSupport RAT dropper disguised as a Pokemon\n\n\n-----\n\ncard game\n– fcdc884dd581701367b284ad302efe4d : NetSupport RAT dropper disguised as a Pokemon\ncard game\n\n– ed68e69534ebdf6c8aa1398da032c147 : NetSupport RAT dropper disguised as Visual\nStudio (source.sdf)\n\n– e7792e09b0283b87b9de37b3420f69d5 : NetSupport RAT dropper disguised as a\nPokemon card game (creates csvs.exe)\n\n– 7ca97fe166c4d8a23d7d9505d9fcc1c0 : Patched client32.exe (csvs.exe)\n\n– 59048c3248025a7d4c7c643d9cf317a5 : NetSupport configuration file (client32.ini)\n\n– f26b26f6d29a4e584bd85f216b8254b9 : NetSupport configuration file (client32.ini)\n\n**C&C**\n\n– tradinghuy.duckdns[.]org:1488\n\n**Phishing Page**\n\n**– hxxps://pokemon-go[.]io/**\n\n– hxxps://beta-pokemoncards[.]io/\n\n**Download**\n\n– hxxps://pokemon-go[.]io/PokemonBetaGame.exe\n\n– hxxps://beta-pokemoncards[.]io/PokemonCardGame.exe\n\n– hxxps://beta-pokemoncards[.]io/PokemonBetaCard.exe\n\n– hxxps://beta-pokemoncards[.]io/PokenoGameCard.exe\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information-en/)\n\n[Tagged as:Game,NetSupport,Pokemon,rat](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/game-en/)\n\n\n-----",
