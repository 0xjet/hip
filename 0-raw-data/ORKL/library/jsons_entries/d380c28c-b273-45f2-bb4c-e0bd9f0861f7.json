Zelensky awarded Armed Forces\nmembers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Email with malicious jpg attachments** _(CERT-UA)_\nThe attached images contain a content-location header that links to a web resource hosting\n[JavaScript code that triggers the exploitation of the Zimbra CVE-2018-6882 vulnerability.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6882)\n\nThis cross-site scripting vulnerability affects Zimbra Collaboration Suite versions 8.7 and\nolder, enabling remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a content-location\nheader in email attachments.\n\nZimbra is an email and collaboration platform that also includes instant messaging, contacts,\nvideo conferencing, file sharing, and cloud storage capabilities.\n\nIn this case, exploiting the flaw adds a forwarding rule for the victim's emails to a new\naddress under the threat actor's control, which is clearly an espionage-supporting move.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Setting Zimbra to forward victim's emails** _(CERT-UA)_\nIt is worth noting that Zimbra had [a similar XSS problem earlier this year, affecting the most](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zimbra-zero-day-vulnerability-actively-exploited-to-steal-emails/)\nrecent 8.8.15 P29 & P30 versions of the suite.\n\nThat flaw was actively exploited as a zero-day by Chinese threat actors who used it to steal\nthe emails of European media and government organizations.\n\nAs such, CERT-UA advises all organizations in Ukraine using Zimbra to update to the latest\navailable versions of the suite immediately.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft finds severe bugs in Android apps from large mobile providers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-finds-severe-bugs-in-android-apps-from-large-mobile-providers/)\n\n[Zyxel warns of flaws impacting firewalls, APs, and controllers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zyxel-warns-of-flaws-impacting-firewalls-aps-and-controllers/)\n\n[Darknet market Versus shuts down after hacker leaks security flaw](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darknet-market-versus-shuts-down-after-hacker-leaks-security-flaw/)\n\n[Is 100% Cybersecurity Readiness Possible?
