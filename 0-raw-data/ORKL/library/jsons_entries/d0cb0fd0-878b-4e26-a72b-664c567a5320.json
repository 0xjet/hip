If so, is this simply a matter\nof accepted state espionage, or did it cross a line? Was the DNC breach part\nof a concerted effort by the Russian Government to interfere with the U.S.\npresidential election?\n\nUnfortunately, we have failed to ask the most consequential question: how will\nRussia continue to employ a variety of methods, including hacks and leaks,\nto undermine the institutions, policies, and actors that the Russian Government\nperceives as constricting and condemning its forceful pursuit of its state aims?\n\nOur visibility into the operations of APT28 - a group we believe the Russian\nGovernment sponsors - has given us insight into some of the government’s\ntargets, as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them.\nWe have tracked and profiled this group through multiple investigations, endpoint\nand network detections, and continuous monitoring. Our visibility into APT28’s\noperations, which date to at least 2007, has allowed us to understand the group’s\nmalware, operational changes, and motivations. This intelligence has been critical\nto protecting and informing our clients, exposing this threat, and strengthening\nour confidence in attributing APT28 to the Russian Government.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### OVERVIEW\n\nOn December 29, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\nand Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a Joint Analysis\nReport confirming FireEye’s long held public assessment that the Russian\nGovernment sponsors APT28. Since at least 2007, APT28 has engaged\nin extensive operations in support of Russian strategic interests.\nThe group, almost certainly compromised of a sophisticated and prolific\nset of developers and operators, has historically collected intelligence on\ndefense and geopolitical issues. APT28 espionage activity has primarily\ntargeted entities in the U.S., Europe, and the countries of the former\nSoviet Union, including governments and militaries, defense attaches,\nmedia entities, and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian\nGovernment.\n\nOver the past two years, Russia appears to have increasingly leveraged\nAPT28 to conduct information operations commensurate with broader\nstrategic military doctrine. After compromising a victim organization,\nAPT28 will steal internal data that is then leaked to further political\nnarratives aligned with Russian interests. To date these have included\nthe conflict in Syria, NATO-Ukraine relations, the European Union refugee\nand migrant crisis, the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics Russian athlete\ndoping scandal, public accusations regarding Russian state-sponsored\nhacking, and the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThis report details our observations of APT28’s\ntargeting, and our investigation into a related\nbreach. We also provide an update on shifts in the\ngroup’s tool development and use, and summarize\nthe tactics APT28 employs to compromise its victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### APT28 TARGETING AND\n INTRUSION ACTIVITY\n\nIn October 2014, FireEye released APT28: A Window into\nRussia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?, and characterized\nAPT28’s activity as aligning with the Russian Government’s\nstrategic intelligence requirements. While tracking APT28,\nwe noted the group’s interest in foreign governments and\nmilitaries, particularly those of European and Eastern\nEuropean nations, as well as regional security organizations,\nsuch as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE), among others. Table 1 highlights\nsome recent examples of this activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TABLE 1:** APT28 TARGETING OF POLITICAL ENTITIES AND INTRUSION ACTIVITY\n\n**ENTIT Y** **TIMEFRAME** **APT28 TARGETING AND INTRUSION ACTIVIT Y**\n\nThe OSCE confirmed that it had suffered an intrusion,\nOSCE NOVEMBER 2016\nwhich a Western intelligence service attributed to APT28.[1]\n\nResearchers at Trend Micro observed APT28 establish a fake\n\nGermany's Christian CDU email server and launch phishing emails against CDU\nAPRIL - MAY 2016\nDemocratic Union (CDU) members in an attempt to obtain their email credentials and access\n\ntheir accounts.[2,3]\n\nAPT28 targets Russian rockers and dissidents Pussy Riot via\nPussy Riot AUGUST 2015\nspear-phishing emails.[4]\n\nNATO, Afghan Ministry APT28 used two domains (nato-news.com and bbc-news.org) to host\nof Foreign Affairs, Pakistani JULY 2015 an Adobe Flash zero-day exploit to target NATO, the Afghan Ministry\nMilitary of Foreign Affairs, and the Pakistani military.\n\nGermany’s Federal Office for Security in Information Technology (BSI)\nannounced that APT28 was likely responsible for the spear phishing\n\nGerman Bundestag emails sent to members of several German political parties.

Russia, like many nations, has long viewed\nsuccess in the Olympic Games as a source of national prestige and soft\npower on the world stage. The doping allegations and prospective ban\nfrom the Games further ostracized Russia, and likely provided motivation\nto actively counter the allegations by attempting to discredit anti-doping\nagencies and policies.

We further\nassess that APT28 is the group responsible for the network\ncompromises of WADA and the DNC and other entities\nrelated to the 2016 U.S. presidential election cycle. These\nbreaches involved the theft of internal data - mostly emails\n– that was later strategically leaked through multiple forums\nand propagated in a calculated manner almost certainly\nintended to advance particular Russian Government aims. In\na report released on January 7 2017, the U.S. Directorate of\nNational Intelligence described this activity as an “influence\ncampaign.”\n\nThis influence campaign - a combination of network\ncompromises and subsequent data leaks - aligns closely\nwith the Russian military’s publicly stated intentions and\ncapabilities. Influence operations, also frequently called\n“information operations,” have a long history of inclusion\nin Russian strategic doctrine, and have been intentionally\ndeveloped, deployed, and modernized with the advent of\nthe internet. The recent activity in the U.S. is but one of\nmany instances of Russian Government influence operations\nconducted in support of strategic political objectives, and it\nwill not be the last. As the 2017 elections in Europe approach\n\n- most notably in Germany, France, and the Netherlands - we\nare already seeing the makings of similarly concerted efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### APPENDIX:\n###### APT28’s Tools, Tactics, and Operational Changes\n\nIn our 2014 report, we identified APT28 as a suspected Russian\ngovernment-sponsored espionage actor. We came to this conclusion\nin part based on forensic details left in the malware that APT28 had\nemployed since at least 2007. We have provided an updated version of\nthose conclusions, a layout of the tactics that they generally employ,\nas well as observations of apparent tactical shifts. For full details,\nplease reference our 2014 report, APT28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber\nEspionage Operations?\n\nAPT28 employs a suite of malware with features indicative of the group’s\nplans for continued operations, as well as the group’s access to resources\nand skilled developers.\n\n**Key characteristics of APT28’s toolset include:**\n\n**• A flexible, modular framework** that has allowed APT28\n\nto consistently evolve its toolset since at least 2007.\n\n**• Use of a formal coding environment in which to develop**\n\ntools, allowing the group to create and deploy custom\nmodules within its backdoors.\n\n**• Incorporation of counter-analysis capabilities including**\n\nruntime checks to identify an analysis environment, obfuscated\nstrings unpacked at runtime, and the inclusion of unused\nmachine instructions to slow analysis.\n\n**• Code compiled during the normal working day in the Moscow**\n\n**time zone and within a Russian language build environment.**\n\n#### OVER\n\n\n###### APT28’S MALWARE\n SAMPLES WERE COMPILED DURING\n THE WORKING WEEK\n\n\n###### SAMPLES COMPILED BETWEEN 8AM AND 6PM\n IN THE TIMEZONE THAT INCLUDES MAJOR RUSSIAN\n CITIES SUCH AS MOSCOW\n AND ST. PETERSBURG\n\n\n###### IN ADDITION,\n APT28’S DEVELOPERS\n CONSISTENTLY BUILT MALWARE IN RUSSIAN LANGUAGE SETTINGS UNTIL\n\n# 2013\n\n\n-----\n\n|TOOL CHOPSTICK|ROLE backdoor|AK A Xagent, webhp, SPLM, (.v2 fysbis)|\n|---|---|---|\n|EVILTOSS|backdoor|Sedreco, AZZY, Xagent, ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI|\n|GAMEFISH|backdoor|Sednit, Seduploader, JHUHUGIT, Sofacy|\n|SOURFACE|downloader|Older version of CORESHELL, Sofacy|\n|OLDBAIT|credential harvester|Sasfis|\n|CORESHELL|downloader|Newer version of SOURFACE, Sofacy|\n\n\n###### APT28’S MALWARE SUITE\n\n**TOOL** **ROLE** **AK A**\n\nCHOPSTICK backdoor Xagent, webhp, SPLM, (.v2 fysbis)\n\nEVILTOSS backdoor Sedreco, AZZY, Xagent, ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI\n\nGAMEFISH backdoor Sednit, Seduploader, JHUHUGIT, Sofacy\n\nSOURFACE downloader Older version of CORESHELL, Sofacy\n\ncredential\nOLDBAIT Sasfis\nharvester\n\nCORESHELL downloader Newer version of SOURFACE, Sofacy\n\n###### APT28’S OPERATIONAL CHANGES SINCE 2014\n\nAPT28 continues to evolve its toolkit and refine its tactics\nin what is almost certainly an effort to protect its operational\neffectiveness in the face of heightened public exposure and\nscrutiny. In addition to the continued evolution of the group’s\nfirst stage tools, we have also noted APT28:\n\n**• Leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player,**\n\nJava, and Windows, including CVE-2015-1701, CVE-2015-2424,\nCVE-2015-2590, CVE-2015-3043, CVE-2015-5119, and CVE-\n2015-7645.\n\n**• Using a profiling script to deploy zero-days and other**\n\ntools more selectively, decreasing the chance that researchers\nand others will gain access to the group’s tools.\n\n**• Increasing reliance on public code depositories, such**\n\nas Carberp, PowerShell Empire, P.A.S. webshell, Metasploit\nmodules, and others in a likely effort to accelerate their\ndevelopment cycle and provide plausible deniability.\n\n**• Obtaining credentials through fabricated Google**\n\n**App authorization and Oauth access requests that allow**\nthe group to bypass two-factor authentication and other\nsecurity measures.\n\n**• Moving laterally through a network relying only**\n\n**on legitimate tools that already exist within the victims’**\nsystems, at times forgoing their traditional toolset for the\nduration of the compromise.\n\nThese changes are not only indicative of APT28’s skills,\nresourcefulness, and desire to maintain operational\neffectiveness, but also highlight the longevity of the\ngroup’s mission and its intent to continue its activities\nfor the foreseeable future.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT28 TACTICS\n\nWe have observed APT28 rely on four key tactics when attempting\nto compromise intended targets. These include sending spear-phishing\nemails that either deliver exploit documents that deploy malware onto\na user’s systems, or contain a malicious URL designed to harvest the\nrecipients’ email credentials and provide access to the their accounts.\nAPT28 has also compromised and placed malware on legitimate websites\nintending to infect site visitors, and has gained access to organizations by\ncompromising their web-facing servers\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### To download this or other\n FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reports, visit: www.fireeye.com/reports.html\n\n**FireEye, Inc.**\n1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035\n408.321.6300 / 877.FIREEYE (347.3393) / info@FireEye.com\n\n**www.FireEye.com**\n\n\n-----",
