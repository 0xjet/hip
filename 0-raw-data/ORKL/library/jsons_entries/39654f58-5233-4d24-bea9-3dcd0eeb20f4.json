The primary motivation behind global cyber activity has now shifted from disparate\n\nactivities carried out by individuals, groups and criminal gangs pursuing short-term financial gain, to skilled adversaries\n\ndriven by strategic global conflicts. The economic downturn and new Five Year Plan in China will continue to drive\n\ntheir state-sponsored cyber espionage activities. The situation in the Ukraine and falling oil prices will continue to fuel\n\ntargeted intrusions from Russia. The conflict in the Middle East between Saudi Arabia and Iran over Yemen will continue\n\nto generate hacktivism from that region. CEOs and boards of directors who ignore or disregard the ramifications of\n\nglobal events such as these will pay for it in the loss of revenue, jobs, intellectual property, and shareholder value.\n\nThis shift underscores the importance for an effective intelligence program about the motivations of\n\nyour adversary. The mantra “people, processes and technology” is no longer enough for cyber se\ncurity. In today’s threat environment, it takes **people, processes, technology AND** **intelligence.**\n\nIntelligence is no longer a “nice-to-have.” It is a mandatory element of stopping breaches.\n\nHow can you expect to win if you do not have a solid understanding of how your adversary\n\noperates, what their tendencies are, what their goals are, and what motivates them? Recognize\n\nwhy they would want to come after you and your company. If you don’t know the game plan\n\nof your adversary, you will fail to defend your corporation. It sounds like common sense, but\n\nit is something that is lost in the outdated discussion of people, processes and technology.\n\nCompanies must have intelligence, either home-grown or provided by third-party sources who\n\nhave the trained personnel to monitor, capture and analyze threat data effectively.\n\nEmphasizing intelligence has been a cornerstone for CrowdStrike’s approach to security since the foun\ndation of the company five years ago: Providing cloud-based security powered by comprehensive, in-house\n\nthreat intelligence. With our Falcon Platform and Threat Intelligence team, we have a unique bird’s-eye view by having\n\nour endpoint sensors deployed in more than 170 different countries, handling more than ten billion events per day,\n\nas well as providing incident response services in response to some of the largest breaches. The “brains” behind our\n\nFalcon Platform is our Threat Graph engine, which constantly collects and analyzes billions of events, both in real time\n\nand retrospectively. As a result, on a weekly basis, we are identifying and mitigating hundreds of breaches for which\n\ntraditional defenses silently fail.\n\nThe CrowdStrike team has put tremendous effort into capturing this real attack telemetry, analyzing it, distilling how\n\nadversaries operate, and more importantly, what motivates them. We hope our experiences and the lessons learned that\n\nare manifested in the 2015 Threat Report will provide companies a sampling of the intelligence they need to protect\n\nthemselves in 2016 and beyond.\n\n**George Kurtz.

It drives our next-generation endpoint protection, it fuels our incident response teams so they can resolve incidents faster, and it is consumed by our customers and their enterprise tools, allowing them to detect and stop attacks.\n\n\nwell-known proverb captures the\n\nessence of intelligence: In the land\n\nof the blind, the one-eyed man is\n\nking. One who is better informed\n\nthan his adversaries will have the advantage. A\n\nIntelligence helps remove uncertainty from\n\ndecision making; businesses around the world\n\nuse various types of intelligence to ascertain\n\nwhat markets they should focus on, and how they\n\nshould enter those markets. Intelligence about\n\nwhat personnel, which business units, or what\n\nproducts are being targeted by malicious threat\n\nactors can similarly aid in the decision-making\n\nprocess for the business. This transcends the\n\nsecurity operations center and incident response\n\nmeasures. This information can help the business\n\nmake more informed decisions, from the IT team,\n\nthe C-suite, and even the board of directors.\n\nIncreasingly, organizations around the globe are\n\nusing threat intelligence to make their enterprises\n\nsmarter and more resilient. These organizations\n\nuse threat intelligence to stay ahead of the adver\nsary. As more and more organizations begin to\n\nutilize threat intelligence, the value in understand\ning what these threats mean to the business be\ncomes evident. Intelligence powers everything we\n\ndo, and it can power everything you do as well.\n\n\nThis year’s CrowdStrike Intelligence Global\n\nThreat Report contains a wealth of intelligence\n\nregarding adversary behavior, capabilities, and\n\nintentions. More importantly, it ties it back to\n\nthe events that influenced those activities. By\n\nunderstanding the events that shape the beliefs\n\nand motivations of threat actors—regardless if\n\nthey are criminal, nation-state, or hacktivist—it\n\nis possible to comprehend what drove the\n\nadversaries to behave as they did, and perhaps\n\nto understand what this will mean for the future.\n\nThe hope is that this report will provide a lens\n\nby which the reader can begin to view the world\n\nthrough the eyes of the attacker and use that\n\ninformation to stay ahead of the adversary—or\n\nas some might say, “to the left of boom”.\n\nCrowdStrike buckets more than 70 designated\n\nadversaries into three different motivations.\n\nThese motivations—Targeted Intrusion, eCrime,\n\nand Hacktivism—can be influenced by a wide\n\nrange of external factors. Targeted intrusion\n\nis most frequently executed by nation-states\n\nseeking to collect intelligence to facilitate\n\npublic and private decision making. These\n\nnations have collected intelligence from private\n\nenterprises, non-governmental organizations,\n\nmilitary and defense related businesses, foreign\n\n\ngovernments, and individuals deemed to be\n\ndangerous to the aggressor. Electronic crime\n\n(eCrime) is financially motivated activity by\n\nthreat actors targeting any number of victims\n\nranging from individuals to corporations. Tar\ngeted eCrime is an issue that is emergent and\n\ncovered in the report as well. Hacktivism can\n\npop up at any time, for any reason, anywhere;\n\nhacktivist actors may be nationalists, social\n\nactivists, terrorist supporters, or pranksters.\n\nThis report is organized differently from our\n\nprevious Global Threat Reports. In years past, the\n\nreports contained a review of notable activity\n\nfollowed by adversary-specific information, and\n\nthey culminated in a looking forward section.\n\nThese reports were contiguous and meant to be\n\nread from start to finish. This report is designed\n\nto flow more like a magazine; there are feature\n\nreports on various topics, smaller pieces meant\n\nto augment those topics, and profiles of select\n\nadversaries. The basic structure covers the three\n\nadversary motivations tracked by CrowdStrike:\n\nTargeted Intrusion, eCrime, and Hacktivism. This\n\nis followed by a review of predictions from last\n\nyear’s report to track how those predictions\n\npanned out, and what to expect for 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In recent years, adversaries aligned with the interests of the People’s\n\n Republic of China (PRC) have dominated vendor threat reporting, security\n\n research blogs, and mainstream news by targeting international businesses,\n\n governments, dissident groups, and not-for-profit organizations. During\n\n 2015, however, the media coverage was inundated by a series of breaches\n\n of personally identifiable information (PII) stretching back through 2014.\n\n The breaches were announced in rapid succession by a number of U.S.\n\n healthcare providers and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\n\n\nThe targeting of PII is fascinating, as targeted\n\nintrusion operators historically have not pursued\n\nsuch personal information. This targeting under\nscores that intrusion operations associated with\n\nnation-states pose a significant risk to all data,\n\nno matter how uninteresting it may seem. The\n\nintentions of these actors can be debated; one\n\nmight argue these incursions point to integration\n\nbetween cyber espionage and human intelligence\n\ntargeting. This implies the creation of a massive\n\ndatabase of information that may be used to\n\nidentify individuals who might be susceptible\n\nto recruitment for espionage. An alternate\n\nhypothesis is that the intrusions were executed\n\nin an effort to better understand western health\ncare systems in order to satisfy the healthcare\n\nobjectives of China’s 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP).\n\nIn the wake of the July breach of the Italian infor\nmation technology company Hacking Team, the\n\npublic release of stolen data included a number of\n\n\nexploits that were quickly adopted by malicious\n\nactors. The adversaries leveraging the compro\nmised exploits included numerous China-based\n\ntargeted intrusion actors who rapidly operational\nized exploit code and used it against a wide vari\nety of target organizations. The speed and similar\nities in the technical implementation of the leaked\n\nexploit code underscored the possibility that these\n\nactors may be connected to one another through\n\na shared tool development center or vendor.\n\nSeveral major events of strategic importance set\n\nthe stage for the cyber activity observed in 2015,\n\nand they will continue to influence future events in\n\nCrowdStrike’s 2016 outlook for China-based cyber\n\nadversaries. China’s increased efforts at domestic\n\ncensorship and the notion of “cyber sovereignty”\n\nare key to understanding the way that the\n\nCommunist Party of China (CPC) views the role\n\nof computer network exploitation. Territorial\n\nexpansion actions by China in the South China Sea\n\n\n###### T A R G E T E D I N T R U S I O N S\n CHINA\n\n In 2015 high-profile targeted intrusion activity was observed that revealed behavior not often associated with China-based adversaries, and which also provided some insight into how these actors operate.\n\n\n-----\n\nduring 2015 continued to be a source of tension\n\nbetween China and members of the international\n\ncommunity. President XI Jinping’s domestic\n\ncorruption crackdown and subsequent military\n\nreorganization, which were observed in 2015, will\n\nhave far-reaching effects well into the new year.\n\n###### PII BREACHES\n\neginning in early 2015, several private\n\norganizations in the U.S. healthcare sector,\n\nas well as entities in the U.S. and Japanese\n\n###### B\n\ngovernment, began announcing that they suffered\n\nmassive data breaches. These breaches com\npromised the PII of millions of individuals. While\n\ndata breaches occur frequently, these incidents\n\nwere unique in that they were not carried out\n\nby actors looking to profit from the information,\n\nbut rather by China-based targeted intrusion\n\nadversaries. While historically these actors have\n\nnot been interested in PII data, these incidents\n\nhinted toward possible new interests and collec\ntion requirements for China-based adversaries.\n\nThe first of the breaches attributed to Chi\nna-based actors was announced by healthcare\n\nprovider Anthem in February 2015; it reportedly\n\nresulted in the acquisition of customer names,\n\nSocial Security numbers, physical and email\n\naddresses, and income data for between 37.5 and\n\n78.8 million customers. Two other U.S. healthcare\n\nproviders, Premera and CareFirst (both under the\n\nBlueCross/BlueShield umbrella along with An\nthem), followed suit in March and May, respective\nly. Premera reported a PII breach of up to 11 million\n\nof its customers, while CareFirst put the number\n\naround 1.1 million. All told, these healthcare\n\nbreaches resulted in the compromise of anywhere\n\nfrom approximately 50 to 80 million Americans.\n\nIn addition to the compromises in the healthcare\n\nsector, major breaches believed to be the result\n\nof Chinese intrusion operations were reported\n\nat government organizations in the U.S. and\n\n\nJapan. On 1 June 2015, the Japanese government\n\nreported a significant breach at the Japan Pen\nsion Service (JPS). This attack was conducted\n\nduring May 2015 using a campaign of spear\n\nphishing emails with themes including requests\n\nfor comment on policy, participation in seminars,\n\nand notifications about medical expenses. As a\n\nresult of this compromise, JPS officials announced\n\nthat pension IDs, names, birthdates, and phys\nical addresses were obtained by the attacker,\n\nalthough sensitive information about premiums\n\nand benefits were not accessible through the\n\ncompromised part of the network. Three days\n\nlater, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management\n\n(OPM) reported that a breach resulted in the\n\ncompromise of approximately 4 million individ\nuals associated with the federal government.\n\nThe theft of large amounts of PII by China-based\n\ntargeted intrusion adversaries is anomalous to\n\ntheir typical tactics, techniques, and procedures\n\n(TTPs). These actors are generally interested in\n\nsensitive information of a more strategic nature\n\nsuch as intellectual property, information related\n\nto business operations, or sensitive government\n\ndocuments. Stolen PII is typically used to facil\nitate identity theft or other types of financially\n\nmotivated crimes; however, when viewed through\n\na more strategic lens, the PII compromised in\n\nthe healthcare and government breaches over\n\nthe past year could be of significant use to a\n\nforeign government or state-run enterprise.\n\nLooking specifically at the healthcare breaches,\n\nthe targeting of organizations relating to\n\npopulation welfare may be part of an intelli\ngence-collection effort intended to support the\n\naims of China’s 12th FYP, which was launched in\n\n2011. While these plans are generally broad and\n\ncover a range of topics to improve and stabilize\n\nChina’s future, an important element of the 12th\n\nPlan is the concept of “inclusive sustainable\n\ngrowth”. This includes specific considerations\n\nfor welfare of the populace, including a com\n\nmitment to boosting growth in social security,\n\nprivate pensions, and medical insurance.\n\nDrilling down into the medical sector, priorities\n\ninclude improvement in medical technology,\n\nprovision and management of a basic health\ncare service for the entire population, and\n\nthe creation of a healthcare database for 70\n\npercent of urban residents. It also empha\nsizes foreign investment in developing the\n\nChinese healthcare sector during this time.\n\nWith these requirements in mind, it is possible\n\nthat the network compromises detailed here\n\nmay have been executed to better understand\n\nhow other countries have structured their\n\nsystems and to obtain an understanding of\n\nlarge, multinational healthcare providers to\n\nsupport negotiations for foreign investment.\n\nThis emphasis on healthcare services has carried\n\nover into the 13th FYP as the CPC has promised\n\nbasic universal healthcare for all Chinese citizens\n\nby 2020. Targeting of the western healthcare\n\nsector may be as much about logistics and\n\nknow-how for running national-level health\n\ninsurance schemes as it is about siphoning data.\n\nHowever, because of the personal, individualized\n\nnature of the information that was targeted for\n\ndata exfiltration during each of these breach\n\nevents, there may be a wider strategic use for it\n\nwithin the Five-Year Plan. This raises an altogether\n\nmore disconcerting scenario for organizations and\n\ntheir customers: Information about their personal\n\ncircumstances is of value to the attackers in some\n\nway. While the official response to most of these\n\nbreaches has been to offer a period of identity\n\ntheft protection and credit monitoring to each\n\naffected individual, it is unlikely that concerted\n\nefforts to compromise multiple networks within\n\nthe same sector would be undertaken for the\n\npurpose of fraud. Another possible scenario is that\n\nthese attacks are being used to build out profiles\n\non individuals to support future operations.\n\n\n###### “ALL TOLD, THESE\n\n HEALTHCARE BREACHES\n\n RESULTED IN THE\n\n COMPROMISE OF ANYWHERE \n\n FROM APPROXIMATELY 50 to 80 MILLION AMERICANS.”\n\n\n-----\n\nmore effective, spear phishing campaigns, or\n\nalso in more traditional, real-world espionage\n\nactivity. Data contained in the SF86 documen\ntation would be particularly useful to traditional\n\nHUMINT operations as it contains details of a\n\nvery personal nature about current and former\n\ngovernment employees, as well as private sector\n\nemployees working on government contracts.\n\nIt is possible that the adversary’s goal for these\n\ncompromises was to build a dataset on a large\n\nnumber of individuals of intelligence value\n\nthrough which detailed profiles of these individ\nuals could be produced. Such a project would\n\nrequire the theft of PII from multiple organizations\n\nsuch as those observed in this campaign.\n\nIf this was the goal of this campaign, then it is\n\npossible that more PII breaches by targeted\n\nintrusion adversaries could occur in the future.\n\nWhile there is currently no indication that PII\n\ntheft is going to be a continuous trend, orga\nnizations across all sectors—but particularly\n\nthose that possess PII on government employees\n\nor other individuals that may be of counter\nintelligence value—should remain alert to the\n\npossibility of similar activity going into 2016.\n\n###### LEGAL AND REGULATORY CHALLENGES  POSED BY PII-FOCUSED TARGETED  INTRUSION OPERATIONS\n\nhe loss of any kind of information, be it\n\nPII or sensitive/strategic data, is of great\n\nconcern to all organizations; however, these\n\n###### T\n\nincidents of theft of PII by targeted intrusion\n\n\noperators may indicate a disturbing new trend.\n\nIn the past, organizations that were victims of\n\ntargeted intrusions suffered the loss of valuable\n\nbusiness information, but that loss could usually\n\nbe kept a secret as there is little in the way of\n\ndisclosure requirements associated with that\n\nsort of data. The U.S. Securities and Exchange\n\n\nCommission (SEC) does have guidance stating\n\nthat companies falling under the SEC’s purview\n\nshould report cybersecurity incidents that have\n\na material impact on the business, but the deci\nsion on what rises to the level of necessitating\n\ndisclosure is still left up to the company.\n\nIn the case of a breach of PII, numerous state\n\nand federal laws require affected organizations\n\nto disclose the breach to affected individuals.\n\nThis means that targeted intrusion incidents\n\nthat result in the theft of PII are forced into\n\nthe public eye during the disclosure process,\n\nmaking a targeted intrusion incident not only\n\npotentially damaging to a company’s strategic\n\nposition in their marketplace, but also dam\naging to it financially and reputationally.\n\nFinancial damage can come in multiple forms\n\nincluding the cost of carrying out the breach\n\nnotification processes required by the various\n\ndata breach statutes. Notification costs can\n\neasily run into the millions of dollars. A publicly\n\ndisclosed breach can also be damaging to\n\na company’s stock value. Target’s stock slid\n\n11 percent in the weeks after it announced a\n\nmassive data breach at the end of 2013.\n\nReputational damage can be as significant as\n\nthe financial cost of a breach, or even more so.\n\nPublicly acknowledging the theft of data can\n\nmake people question a company’s dedication to\n\nsecurity and overall competence. What is more,\n\na targeted intrusion incident that is disclosed\n\ndue to PII theft will also likely lead people to\n\nquestion what other data was compromised.\n\nIf the wrongdoers were able to gain access\n\nto databases containing PII, were they also\n\nable to take valuable intellectual property,\n\ninformation on key mergers and acquisitions\n\nprojects, and strategies concerning ongoing\n\nnegotiations? These types of concerns could\n\nundermine a company’s market position.\n\n\n###### “AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT\n\n OF THE 12TH PLAN IS THE\n\n CONCEPT OF  ‘INCLUSIVE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH’.\n THIS INCLUDES SPECIFIC\n\n CONSIDERATIONS FOR\n\n WELFARE OF THE POPULACE,\n\n INCLUDING A COMMITMENT\n\n TO BOOSTING GROWTH \n\n IN SOCIAL SECURITY, \n\n PRIVATE PENSIONS, AND\n\n MEDICAL INSURANCE.”\n\n\nThe breached healthcare entities are all federation\n\nmembers of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Associa\ntion, which offers coverage to state and federal\n\nemployees through the Federal Employees Health\n\nBenefit Plan. During the public broadcast of an\n\nOversight Committee hearing on 16 June regard\ning the OPM network breach, the Director of OPM\n\nstated that records held on the compromised\n\nsystems did not include actual medical record\n\ninformation on employees, but they did include\n\ndetails on their healthcare providers. It is likely\n\nthat a combination of these two datasets would\n\nbe extremely valuable to gain deeper insight into\n\nthe lives and vulnerabilities of federal employees.\n\nIn the case of OPM, information acquired by the\n\nattackers went far beyond the data obtained in\n\nthe breaches of the U.S healthcare providers. In\n\naddition to the typical personal data common\n\nto other breaches, the OPM network held data\n\ncollected through “Standard Form 86” (SF86),\n\nwhich must be completed by individuals applying\n\nfor national security positions. The SF86 is a\n\ncomprehensive document that collects large\n\namounts of highly personal information on\n\napplicants so they can be vetted for possible\n\nvulnerabilities that may be exploited by hostile\n\nactors in order to gain information. Without\n\ndoubt, access to this degree of PII for both suc\ncessful and unsuccessful applicants represents a\n\ntreasure trove of information that may be exploit\ned for counterintelligence purposes. China has\n\npublicly declared this breach the work of criminals\n\nand announced that they had arrested several\n\nindividuals who were responsible in late 2015.\n\nAt this time, it is difficult to know exactly how\n\nthis voluminous amount of information might\n\nbe leveraged in the future. It is possible that\n\ninsights could be gained into targets of interest by\n\ncorrelating information about this potential target\n\nacross the multiple compromised datasets. Knowl\nedge acquired during these operations could be\n\nused to create more individualized, and therefore\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ACTOR EXPLOIT TARGETING MALWARE\n\n\n###### DYNAMITE PANDA\n\n STONE PANDA\n\n EMISSARY PANDA\n\n GOBLIN PANDA\n\n TURBINE PANDA\n\n UNDETERMINED\n\n UNDETERMINED\n\n UNDETERMINED\n\n UNDETERMINED\n\n UNDETERMINED\n\n UNDETERMINED\n\n UNDETERMINED\n\n UNDETERMINED\n\n UNDETERMINED\n\nChart short caption here:\n\n\nIt is still too soon to tell whether PII theft is\n\ngoing to become a consistent trend for targeted\n\nintrusion operators, but the incidents disclosed\n\nin 2015 certainly underscore the potential threat.\n\nAny business that collects PII for any reason\n\nshould be aware that a targeted intrusion could\n\nresult in a PII breach that would lead to required\n\ndisclosure. This is particularly true for any\n\ncompany storing the information of government\n\nemployees, as those individuals are likely to be\n\nof particular interest to foreign governments\n\nthat carry out targeted intrusion operations.\n\n\nChina-based targeted intrusion adversaries\n\nrapidly adopted exploits for two of these vulnera\nbilities: CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-5122.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence closely tracked the\n\nproliferation of this exploit code amongst Chi\nnese actors and identified numerous incidents\n\nfrom named and still-unidentified actors.\n\nThe high degree of similarity in the exploit code\n\nfiles is an indication that the actors responsible\n\nfor the operations summarized in the table are\n\nsomehow related. Evidence of a relationship\n\nbetween these actors is further strengthened\n\nby the tight time frame in which the operations\n\nwere carried out. Seven of the actors began\n\nusing the HT_Exploit variant within 72 hours\n\nof each other, with the rest following in the\n\nsame week. The flash_exploit_002 variant\n\nbegan appearing around 14 July 2015, with five\n\nactors or sets carrying out operations using\n\nthat variant within 24 hours of each other, and\n\nthe final incident occurring a week later.\n\n###### POSSIBLE TIMELINE\n\nased on the similarity in the exploit code\n\nand usage time frame there are three\n\nprimary scenarios that could explain the\n\n###### B\n\nextent to which these actors are connected.\n\n\n\n - \u0007The tactics and timing of the observed incidents\n\nindicate that the most likely scenario is that\n\nthere is an entity that creates or repurposes\n\nexploit code and develops tools for targeted\n\nintrusion adversaries to easily operationalize that\n\ncode, such as a builder tool that would allow\n\nan actor to bind an executable to the exploit\n\ncode. The way in which the CVE-2015-5119 and\n\nCVE-2015-5122 exploit code was operationalized\n\nbetween the HT_Exploit and flash_exploit_002\n\nclusters is identical across all adversaries in\n\nthose clusters. It seems highly unlikely that the\n\n14 distinct actors identified between the two\n\nclusters independently operationalized the\n\n\n###### HACKING TEAM CAMPAIGNS\n\nn 5 July 2015, an unknown actor successfully\n\nbreached the network of the Italian infor\nmation technology company Hacking Team,\n\n###### O\n\nwhose primary business was selling offensive\n\nintrusion and surveillance capabilities to govern\nments, law enforcement, and similar organizations.\n\nSoon after the breach, the actor responsible pub\nlicly leaked all of Hacking Team’s tools and com\nmunications. Among the approximately 400 GB\n\nof leaked data was exploit code for a number of\n\ndifferent, and at the time unknown, vulnerabilities.\n\n|5119 & 5122|SOUTHEAST ASIA / FINANCIAL|GH0ST|\n|---|---|---|\n|5119|UNKNOWN|UNIDENTIFIED|\n|5119|HONG KONG / PRO-DEMOCRACY|HTTPBROWSER|\n|5119|SOUTH CHINA SEA ISSUES|PLUGX|\n|5122|U.S./AEROSPACE, DEFENSE|ISSPACE|\n|5119|UNKNOWN|TERMINATOR|\n|5119 & 5122|JAPAN|EMDIVI|\n|5119|UNKNOWN|HTTPBROWSER|\n|5119 & 5122|JAPAN|PLUGX|\n|5122|CHINESE DISSIDENTS|PLUGX|\n|5122|JAPAN|PLUGX|\n|5122|UNKNOWN|SMAC|\n|5122|CHINA ISSUES|EVILGRAB|\n\n\n###### 5119\n\n\n###### INTERNET  SERVICES\n\n\n###### SAKULA\n\n\n-----\n\ncode for the two exploits in the same way. If\n\neach actor were operating independently of the\n\nothers, it would be expected that there would\n\nbe at least minimal differences in the way the\n\nexploits were weaponized.\n\nAdditionally, the rapid time frame in which\n\nthe exploits were adopted suggests that a\n\ncentralized source disseminated a builder\n\ntool to these various actors within hours or\n\ndays of the code being leaked. Such rapid\n\nproliferation is unlikely to occur outside\n\nof a formal dissemination channel.\n\n- \u0007Another potential scenario is that these actors\n\nwere sharing tools because they are different\n\nparts of a larger overarching organization. For\n\nexample, each actor in the HT_Exploit and\n\nflash_exploit_002 clusters could represent a\n\nteam working within a Chinese government/\n\nmilitary organization or possibly a China-based\n\ndefense or intelligence contractor. There is not\n\nenough evidence at this time to make a more\n\ndefinitive statement about the likelihood of this\n\nscenario, however the sharing of tools and the\n\nclose-in-time deployment of those tools could\n\nbe explained by a scenario in which these actors\n\nare all working for the same organization.\n\nSimilar targeting amongst the adversaries from\n\nthe HT_Exploit and flash_exploit_002 cluster may\n\nalso suggest that they work for the same orga\nnization. Of the nine actors whose targeting was\n\ndirectly observed or could be inferred from their\n\nTTPs, seven targeted Southeast or East Asia. It is\n\npossible that the targeting overlap observed with\n\nthese actors is the result of a directive to target\n\nentities in Southeast and East Asia by an overar\nching organization in which the actors operate.\n\n- \u0007A third possible scenario to explain the apparent\n\nconnection between these actors is that they\n\nall obtained access to the same tools through a\n\nmore informal, shared tool dissemination channel.\n\n\n###### CENSORSHIP, CORRUPTION, AND CHINA’S “CYBER SOVEREIGNTY”\n\n015 demonstrated that China intends to\n\naggressively pursue the concept of cyber\n\nsovereignty and push it as an international\n\n###### 2\n\nnorm by going on the offensive if necessary.\n\nAlmost immediately after the New Year, there was\n\nan aggressive crackdown on those circumventing\n\nChina’s censorship apparatus commonly referred\n\n\nSuch a channel could involve sharing of code or\n\ntools from one actor to other actors, or possibly a\n\nforum or other communication channel that some\n\nChina-based actors use to share code or tools.\n\nThis seems like the least likely scenario when\n\ntaking into account the identical nature of the\n\nway in which the exploit code was operation\nalized, the close-in-time nature in which the\n\nactivity occurred, and the overlapping targeting\n\nbetween a number of adversaries. It is unlikely\n\nthat an informal, shared dissemination channel\n\nwould result in this many actors receiving access\n\nto the same tool or exploit code in such a small\n\nwindow of time and that this many actors\n\nwould then put the tool to use so quickly.\n\nThe key take-away from the Hacking Team inci\ndent is that the adversary can move quickly and\n\ncapitalize on a fortuitous release of exploit data.\n\nWhether the actors have consumed a weaponized\n\nexploit through a shared tool development, pur\nchased it from a third party that developed it, or\n\nbenefited from a released implementation of these\n\nexploits from an underground forum, they proved\n\nthat they could rapidly retool and use the new\n\nexploit to conduct intrusions. Events such as the\n\nHacking Team leak do happen; historically several\n\nsecurity companies with vulnerability or exploit\n\ndata have been breached, and if the data those\n\nfirms have is exposed, it can be expected that the\n\nadversary will find a way to make it their own.\n\n\nto as the Great Firewall of China (GFW). This\n\nincluded additional blocking of sites, shutting\n\ndown Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers,\n\nand most importantly, new methods of DNS\n\npoisoning, which directed users attempting\n\nto access forbidden sites to third-party sites,\n\nsometimes creating a Distributed Denial of Service\n\n(DDoS) on innocent servers. In response to the\n\nintensified crackdown, multiple anti-censorship\n\nsites began hosting censored material on\n\ndistributed content delivery networks (CDNs)\n\nin a concept called “collateral freedom”. One\n\nanti-censorship site, Greatfire.org, after hosting\n\ntheir censored content on CDNs and being pres\nsured to remove the content, began hosting their\n\nmaterial on open-source code sharing site Github.\n\nThe Chinese government responded by publicly\n\nunveiling for the first time its offensive counter\npart to the GFW, the so-called “Great Cannon”.\n\nThis weapon redirected a subset of international\n\nusers’ traffic that touched servers connected\n\nBaidu’s Wangmeng (Chinese equivalent to\n\nGoogle Adwords) and redirected traffic to hit\n\nGithub repositories where censored material\n\nwas being hosted, resulting in a massive DDoS\n\nattack. This crippled Github for several days.\n\nAlthough the attacks were ultimately unsuccessful\n\nat coercing Github to remove the content, this\n\nwas a clear message by China that it intended\n\nto enforce its notion of cyber sovereignty, even\n\noverseas. CrowdStrike and other industry research\ners traced the origins of the Great Cannon back\n\nto the backbone of China’s Internet, suggesting\n\nthat the China Internet Network Information\n\nCenter (CNNIC) and cyber czar LU Wei (鲁炜)\n\nwere involved at a high level in facilitating the\n\nattacks. There was virtually no repercussion against\n\nthe Chinese government for, at the very least,\n\ntacitly allowing an attack on western systems.\n\nThough the Great Cannon did not make another\n\nappearance in 2015, China continued to push\n\n\ncensorship, and to enforce cybersecurity reform.\n\nNot only was the MPS increasingly active in\n\nenforcing the CPC’s notion of cyber sovereignty,\n\nbut it was clear that 2015 marked an increase\n\nin responsibility for the MPS with regard to\n\ncybersecurity reform and operating overseas.\n\nWhile the MPS has historically been involved in\n\nenforcing internal cybersecurity practices, the\n\nincreased use of this ministry in China’s new efforts\n\nthat traditionally would have fallen under other\n\nbranches, such as the Ministry of State Security\n\n(MSS), could be indicative of a the powerful role for\n\nthe MPS under President XI Jinping. Such efforts\n\ninclude the creation of MPS units within major Chi\nnese Internet and web service providers, widespread\n\narrests for Internet crimes—both in the homeland\n\nand abroad, and leading high-level global cyber\nsecurity dialogues with countries such as the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, as the MPS is taking a prominent\n\nrole in anti-terrorism efforts, it is expected\n\nthat new Internet restrictions and enforcement\n\nefforts will be conducted under the guise of\n\n\nits concept of cyber sovereignty and continued\n\nits crackdown on VPN providers within its bor\nders. Several popular circumvention sites were\n\nshut down, and their authors often left cryptic\n\nmessages shortly before the Chinese Ministry of\n\nPublic Security (MPS) questioned them or their\n\nsocial media presence went dark. Interestingly,\n\nseveral of these circumvention tools have been\n\nobserved in use by DEEP PANDA after their\n\nshutdowns, suggesting that the MPS either took\n\ntheir tools and reused them, or the operators\n\nthemselves are reliant on them to avoid the GFW.\n\n###### RISE OF THE MPS\n\nhroughout 2015, CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nidentified a concerning number of initiatives\n\ntaken by the Communist Party of China\n\n###### T\n\n(CPC) to strengthen Internet regulation and\n\n\n-----\n\ncombatting terrorism. As President XI Jinping\n\nand the CPC continue efforts to obtain “cyber\n\nsovereignty” within China and protect its neti\nzens, it is likely the MPS will continue to play a\n\nleading role in enforcing those efforts in 2016.\n\nThe MPS, currently headed by Minister GUO\n\nShengkun, is the principal police and security\n\nauthority of the People’s Republic of China and\n\nthe government agency that exercises oversight\n\nover law enforcement duties. This includes\n\nmanagement of the system of Public Security\n\nBureaus (PSB), which are in turn are responsible\n\nfor carrying out local policing functions. The\n\nMPS ostensibly operates under the State Council.\n\nHowever, in reality, it is believed to operate\n\nunder the direct control of the CPC leadership,\n\nspecifically Politburo member MENG Jianzhu.\n\nMENG is the most recent former minister of the\n\nMPS; he leads the Central Political and Legal\n\nCommission (CPLC) of the Communist Party\n\nand reports directly to President XI Jinping.\n\nThe MPS has a history of training security officials\n\nand police officers in cybersecurity, particularly\n\ncomputer network exploitation and attack tech\nniques. The People’s Public Security University\n\nin Beijing, a part of the MPS that trains China’s\n\npolice and internal security forces, reportedly has\n\nseveral units engaged in training and operations\n\nfor carrying out cyber operations. While the\n\nmotivation behind this training appears to be\n\ninternal law enforcement operations, it provides\n\nthe MPS with a fully capable cadre skilled in\n\ncomputer network operations. According to a\n\nformer Chinese security official, the MPS holds\n\nmore power within the CPC than other organi\nzations such as the MSS, and therefore “likely\n\nhas more authority to task and manage hacker\n\nactivities both domestically and overseas.”\n\nIn mid-2015, paralleling a number of pieces of new\n\nInternet legislation and reform released by the\n\nCPC, the MPS appeared to take a stronger role in\n\ncybersecurity enforcement efforts. In early August\n\n\n2015, the MPS announced the creation and imple\nmentation of “network security offices” at major\n\nChinese Internet companies and service providers\n\nsuch as China Mobile, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.\n\nReporting indicates the primary motivations\n\nbehind the creation of these units were to assist\n\ncompanies in handling illegal Internet activities,\n\nprotecting private information, and improving\n\nincident response time by the MPS. The units will\n\nalso assist companies in preventing the spread of\n\n“disinformation” harmful to the Chinese state.\n\nHistorically, the CPC has placed the majority\n\nof responsibility for monitoring Internet con\ntent at the company level. The embedding\n\nof MPS units shifts this power back to the\n\nMPS and the CPC, and it will greatly enforce\n\nnot only regulations, but also punishment.\n\nOn 18 August, two weeks after the announcement\n\nof Internet police units, the MPS announced the\n\nincarceration of 15,000 people for crimes that\n\n“jeopardized Internet security”. According to\n\nthe MPS, the arrests were made under a new\n\nsix-month program launched in July 2015 named\n\n“Cleaning the Internet”. The details of the arrests\n\nwere not provided, but the MPS claimed the\n\nsweep had targeted approximately “66,000 web\nsites” providing “illegal and harmful information.”\n\nIn what appears to be an associated effort, on\n\n22 August a popular workaround to China’s\n\ncensorship apparatus known as the Great Firewall\n\n(GFW), ShadowSocks, was forcibly taken down\n\nfrom the code-sharing site GitHub. Shadow\nSocks’ author, clowwindy, made a final post on\n\nthe GitHub repository hosting ShadowSocks,\n\nstating that Chinese police forces enforced\n\nthe removal of the code from GitHub and\n\ndemanded any research on the project cease.\n\nThere was a significant outpouring of support\n\nfrom Chinese and western users who vowed to\n\n\nfork the code and keep the ShadowSocks project\n\nalive despite efforts to censor it. Then on 25\n\nAugust, the Github repository hosting another\n\npopular GFW circumvention tool, GoAgent, was\n\nalso removed. The author of the tool, phuslu,\n\ndeleted the repository without explanation, but\n\nhe ominously changed his account description to\n\nbe “Everything that has a beginning has an end”.\n\nAdvocates of free speech similarly suspect that\n\nChina’s police force played a role in the takedown.\n\nIn addition to enforcement of regulations in\n\nthe name of public security, the MPS is also\n\nbeing leveraged in efforts associated with state\n\nsecurity—a mission traditionally carried out\n\nby the MSS. In 2015, the CPC openly acknowl\nedged the lead role of the MPS in Operation\n\nFox Hunt, a campaign launched in July 2014\n\nto pursue and “bring home” corrupt Chinese\n\nofficials who have fled outside of the country.\n\nMPS undercover teams of “hunters” prepare and\n\ncollect information on identified targets before\n\nlocating them across the globe and “persuading”\n\nthem to return to China to answer for their crimes.\n\nLocally, the operation is seen as a success for\n\nPresident XI and his ongoing efforts at combating\n\ncorruption, with reports indicating approximately\n\n930 criminals repatriated by the MPS since July\n\n2014. Globally, however, the MPS operation is\n\ndisconcerting, as it is a brazen show of CPC power\n\nreaching outside of China’s borders by a Ministry\n\ntraditionally tasked with maintaining local security.\n\nNotably, much of this activity occurred in the\n\nbuildup to President XI’s first official visit to the\n\nU.S. in late September when he and President\n\nBarack Obama formalized the U.S./China Cyberse\ncurity Agreement. During President XI’s visit, the\n\nU.S. and China announced an agreement not to di\nrect or support cyber attacks that steal corporate\n\nrecords for economic benefit, the result of lengthy\n\nnegotiations between the two governments.\n\n\n###### “AS PRESIDENT \n\n XI JINPING AND THE CPC\n\n CONTINUE EFFORTS TO\n\n OBTAIN ‘CYBER SOVEREIGNTY’\n\n WITHIN CHINA AND PROTECT\n\n ITS NETIZENS, IT IS LIKELY THE MPS WILL CONTINUE TO  PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN ENFORCING THOSE EFFORTS  IN 2016.”\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CORRUPTION CRACKDOWN AND  MILITARY REORGANIZATION\n\nince assuming office, President XI Jinping has\n\nrejected the communist tradition of collective\n\nleadership and has established himself as\n\n###### S\n\nthe paramount leader who will guide China into\n\na new age of prosperity. Almost immediately he\n\nengaged in a massive crackdown on corruption\n\nwithin the Communist Party designed to remove\n\npolitical rivals (even from the highest positions\n\nof government) and to rapidly consolidate power\n\nwith such ruthless efficiency that it harkens back\n\nto the first early purges by communist leaders.\n\nIn office just two years, XI is now head of the Com\nmunist Party and the Central Military Commission,\n\nthe two traditional pillars of Chinese party leader\nship, as well as the head of leading groups on the\n\neconomy, military reform, cybersecurity, Taiwan,\n\nand foreign affairs. He also leads a commission\n\non national security. This same sense of urgency\n\nis now being reflected in aggressive legislation\n\nmoves that appear to have begun in early 2015\n\nwith the tightening of China’s Internet access, and\n\nthat have continued with controversial national\n\nsecurity measures, which are expected to be\n\nfinalized in 2016 and to significantly affect entities\n\n\nWhile the MPS has long been a forerunner in mon\nitoring China’s Internet content, repressing internal\n\ndissent within China and acting on information\n\nfound “harmful” to the Chinese state traditionally\n\nfell to the MSS. Although the majority of MPS’\n\nactions aim to counter internal issues and enforce\n\ncensorship for Chinese citizens, the global activi\nties carried out by the MPS not only demonstrate\n\nthe Ministry’s capability and willingness to support\n\nCPC regulations and objectives, but also its intent\n\nto carry out operations on foreign soil. As we en\nter into 2016, the MPS will likely continue to gain\n\nauthority and take a leading role in supporting and\n\nenforcing President XI and the CPC’s larger goal in\n\nmandating China’s vision of Internet sovereignty.\n\n\nin the financial, non-governmental organization\n\n(NGO), technology, and manufacturing sectors.\n\nNow past its second year, the crackdowns have\n\nnearly quadrupled, but they are finally showing\n\nresults as XI’s ability to push rapid reforms has im\nproved remarkably. Nowhere does this seem more\n\napparent than the PLA, where XI’s administration\n\nhas purged 42 senior officers across the PLA’s lead\nership on corruption charges. This follows the ap\nproach by former Chinese leaders MAO and DENG\n\nof reshuffling military leaders in order to prevent\n\ndissention and to better consolidate military power.\n\nThe purges increased dramatically in 2015 in what\n\nappears to have been preparation for a massive\n\nreorganization of China’s current PLA-centric\n\nmilitary into a more western joint-command\n\nstructure where the Air Force and Navy are more\n\nevenly represented. XI first announced this in\n\nSeptember 2015 by stating that 300,000 officers\n\nwould be cut from the PLA. Though unpopular\n\nwithin the army, the reorganization plans appear\n\nto be proceeding at an extremely rapid pace,\n\nwith the seven current military regions set to be\n\nreduced to four and additional resources being\n\ngiven to the Air Force (PLAAF) and Navy (PLAN).\n\nThe military reorganization serves\n\nseveral purposes for XI:\n\n- \u0007It increases the oversight of the Central Military\n\nCommission (CMC), which XI heads, further\n\nconsolidating the CCP’s control of the military.\n\n- \u0007It allows for a leaner, more efficient fighting\n\nforce as it looks at having to potentially defend\n\nits territorial claims in both the East China\n\nSea (ECS) and South China Sea (SCS).\n\n- \u0007It comes at a convenient time when more over\nsight into cyber operations are needed in order\n\nto avoid further upsetting the U.S., prompting\n\na reshuffling of the military’s cyber units.\n\n\n###### “ALTHOUGH THE ATTACKS\n\n WERE ULTIMATELY\n\n UNSUCCESSFUL AT\n\n COERCING GITHUB TO\n\n REMOVE THE CONTENT, THIS WAS A CLEAR MESSAGE BY CHINA THAT IT INTENDED TO ENFORCE ITS NOTION OF CYBER SOVEREIGNTY.”\n\n\nAlso announced during President XI’s U.S. visit was\n\nthe creation of a high-level cyber dialogue between\n\nChina and the U.S.—a new approach to the previ\nous working-level talks that were discontinued after\n\nthe U.S. indicted five PLA officers for cybercrimes.\n\nAccording to the White House, the dialogue “will\n\nbe used to review the timeliness and quality\n\nof responses to requests for information and\n\nassistance with respect to malicious cyber activity\n\nof concern identified by either side.” Notably,\n\nthe first dialogue of what will be bi-annual\n\nmeetings was held in December 2015 and was\n\nled by the MPS Minister, GUO Shengkun.\n\nIn addition to the agreement, open source report\ning surfaced shortly after President XI’s visit de\ntailing the quiet arrests of Chinese hackers by the\n\nMPS at the urging of the U.S. government. These\n\narrests reportedly occurred in the weeks before\n\nPresident XI came to the U.S. and are believed to\n\nbe a gesture of the CPC’s dedication in respond\ning to U.S. concerns over cybersecurity, as well as\n\na move to defuse tensions over possible sanctions.\n\nNotably, there have been limited details\n\nreleased surrounding these arrests, and there\n\nis no indication if they are connected to the\n\naforementioned “Cleaning the Internet” pro\ngram. It appears clear that regardless of the\n\nmotivations of these actions, President XI is\n\naggressively pushing an image of power and\n\ncooperation in handling concerns over cyberse\ncurity—a similar image he strives for in China.\n\nThe efforts observed throughout 2015 appear\n\nto be elevating the MPS into an increasingly\n\npowerful position of authority. As the MPS\n\ncontinues to be leveraged in enforcing CPC\n\nregulations, it is likely these actions will lead\n\nto continued arrests and harsher repercus\nsions for those not abiding by the law.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### “ WHILE A COMPLETE SHIFT AWAY FROM MILITARY-ENABLED TARGETING IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY, A BRIEF HIATUS OR SUDDEN OVERLAPPING/ SHARING OF TOOLS AMONG KNOWN  ADVERSARY GROUPS MAY OCCUR AS A MORE EFFICIENT, CENTRAL- IZED CYBER MILITARY FORCE TAKES SHAPE. ”\n\nThis last point is obviously extremely important as it\n\nshapes what CrowdStrike expects to see from China-based\n\nadversaries in 2016. While a complete shift away from\n\nmilitary-enabled targeting is highly unlikely, a brief hiatus\n\nor sudden overlapping/sharing of tools among known\n\nadversary groups may occur as a more efficient, cen\ntralized cyber military force takes shape. The complete\n\nreorganization has an end goal of 2020, however the\n\nweight cyber has on diplomatic relations has increased\n\nover the past few years, and the importance China places\n\non information dominance likely signifies that the cyber\n\nreorganization will be one of its top priorities in 2016.\n\n\n**TURBINE PANDA** is an adversary believed to be\n\noperating out of the People’s Republic of China.\n\nThis group focuses primarily on intelligence\n\ncollection against organizations in the aero-\n\nspace sector, including those developing and\n\noperating aviation technology for both civilian\n\nand defense purposes. The majority of the\n\ntargeted organizations are located in western\n\nnations including the United States, the United\n\nKingdom and Europe. In addition to this\n\nactivity, this actor has also been observed\n\nlaunching attacks against companies in the\n\nwider technology and manufacturing sectors,\n\nsuggesting an overarching objective of\n\nobtaining information about the development\n\nof related fields such as advanced materials\n\nresearch, sensing systems, radio-frequency\n\nengineering, and energy generation.\n\n###### Meet Turbine Panda:\n\n**OPERATING SINCE MID-2014**\n\n**Objectives: Theft of sensitive information**\n\npertaining to high technology and aerospace.\n\n**Victim Profile:**\n\nAerospace\n\nDefense\n\nManufacturing\n\nTechnology\n\n**Primary Malware: PlugX**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ISLAND BUILDING\n\n T A R G E T E D I N T R U S I O N S\n IN THE\n\nhereas territorially motivated cyber activity\n\nin 2014 from China-based adversaries was\n\npredominantly focused on the disputed oil\n\nrig HYSY-981 in the South China Sea (SCS)\n\n###### Wand enforcement of its unilaterally declared air defense\n\nidentification zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea (ECS),\n\n###### SOUTH 2015 saw the stakes increased significantly. Throughout\n\n2014, China began dredging up sand to make artifi\ncial islands in the Spratly Island chain and building\n\nstructures on the new islands, angering rival SCS\n\nclaimants like the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia.\n\nMuch of this activity was conducted in a low-profile\n\n###### CHINA\n\nway, and it was not until the islands were nearing\n\ncompletion in 2015 that media and several think\n\ntanks began to pay close attention to China’s efforts.\n\nAlthough most of these other countries have built\n\nupon the existing land masses in the contested areas\n\nto boost their territorial claims, China took it a step\n\nfurther by changing the physical size of the land\n\n###### SEA\n\nfeatures and adding dual-use features like airstrips\n\nand guardhouses with potential military applications.\n\nCrowdStrike observed a significant amount of cyber\n\nreconnaissance and phishing campaigns targeting rival\n\nclaimants throughout this process that increased dra\nmatically as further reporting on China’s rapid progress\n\nwas made. This targeting included campaigns carried\n\nout by the usual PANDA suspects targeting countries\n\nin the SCS to include GOBLIN, OVERRIDE, PREDATOR,\n\n\nVIXEN, MAVERICK, and LOTUS. In addition,\n\nthere was renewed activity defacing government\n\nwebsites of several countries in the SCS by some\n\nof China’s patriotic hacker groups, such as 1937cn\n\nTeam, which were previously active during the\n\n2014 clashes with Vietnam over the oil rig.\n\nWhile Chinese cyber targeting around geopolitical\n\nevents is by no means new, the activity in the\n\nSCS is particularly noteworthy because of the\n\nimportance Beijing places on securing what\n\nit sees as its territory using national security\n\nas its basis for doing so, and the impact that\n\nChinese control of the islands would have on the\n\nbalance of trade, natural resources, and territorial\n\nintegrity in Asia. China is considering enforcing\n\nan ADIZ in the SCS (in addition to its nine-dash\n\nline, which already encroaches on nearly all\n\ncountries’ exclusive economic zones [EEZ] in the\n\narea), and it is something it may seek to enforce\n\nby both cyber means and traditional military\n\nmeans. Targeting against airlines was already\n\nobserved in 2014, possibly in support of ADIZ\n\nenforcement. This would have a huge impact on\n\nthe countries and business operating in that area\n\nacross all sectors, as well as an incredible amount\n\nof global trade that passes through the SCS.\n\nChina has repeatedly stated that it does not\n\nintend to militarize the islands, however it claims\n\n\nthem as indisputably sovereign territory and\n\nhas increasingly been aggressive in its rhetoric\n\nof defending the islands as part of its normal\n\nnational security mission. This aggressiveness has\n\nonly increased after U.S. freedom of navigation\n\nexercises such as the October sailing of a guided\n\nmissile destroyer, and the November/December\n\nB-52 flights came within 12 nautical miles of\n\nthe islands and challenged China’s territorial\n\nclaims. These actions may prompt China to begin\n\nformal militarization of the islands in 2016.\n\nChina appears to be taking several steps to\n\nprepare for this possibility, including a November\n\n2015 purchase of 24 Russian Sukhoi-35 multi-role\n\nfighters by China. Their larger fuel tanks hold\n\nthe possibility for deployment on the mainland\n\nor the new airfields on the SCS islands and gives\n\na longer “loiter time”, which helps enforce their\n\nterritorial claims. Most recently China conducted\n\nsuccessful landing tests of civilian aircraft on\n\nthe Nansha Island and Fiery Cross airstrips,\n\ndespite protests from regional neighbors.\n\nThe conflict in the SCS will likely be one\n\nof the defining moments of geopolitical\n\nsignificance in 2016, and a hotbed for cyber\n\nactivity from China-based adversaries.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### International conflict, balance of power, energy issues, and the economy\n\n were the common themes observed within active intrusion campaigns\n\n conducted by Russian actors in 2015. The crisis in Ukraine as well as the\n\n Russian military involvement in Syria were major focal points for conflict\n related intrusion activity. The use of cyber warfare operations in Ukraine\n\n were manifested in at least two unique forms—overt and clandestine.\n\n\nOvert activity was conducted by a group\n\nknown as CyberBerkut; while they might not\n\nbe directly linked to actors operating on behalf\n\nof the Russian Federation, their actions do\n\nclosely align with the interests of the moth\nerland. CyberBerkut operations comprised\n\ndisinformation campaigns, DDoS attacks, and\n\nintelligence gathering against Ukrainian targets.\n\nClandestine actions involved the deployment\n\nof malware by various actors used primarily for\n\nintelligence collection. The tools employed in these\n\nactions may also have been capable of destroying\n\ndata or eliciting physical, real-world impacts as well.\n\nConversely, Russia has largely relied on a more\n\ntraditional military campaign in Syria. The use\n\nof regular warfare has not entirely removed\n\nthe potential for asymmetric tactics from\n\nthe battlespace. For example, following the\n\ndestruction of a Russian Su-24 Fencer at the\n\nhands of Turkish military, widespread DDoS\n\nattacks against Turkish targets were observed.\n\n\nAt times, these high-profile conflicts overshadowed\n\nequally significant political and strategic steps\n\nthat Russian national leadership took in tandem in\n\norder to balance power. President Vladimir Putin\n\nworked to extend the reach of Russian influence\n\nthrough the creation of strategic agreements with\n\nnations in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The\n\nformation of these alliances generated concern\n\nwith some believing these actions to be the\n\nfirst steps toward further regional annexation.\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to gauge the extent of\n\nthis concern, and in an effort to stay one step\n\nahead in strategy, Russia is believed to have\n\nproliferated stealthy and effective malware within\n\nthe European Union to engage in reconnaissance.\n\nThrough the implementation of Strategic Web\n\nCompromise (SWC), delivery of implants, and use\n\nof spear-phishing techniques, actors have been\n\nable to establish a broad intelligence-gathering\n\ncapability that targets government and national\n\ndefense in the EU. One possible target of these\n\ncollections was joint NATO exercises conducted in\n\n\n###### T A R G E T E D I N T R U S I O N S\n RUSSIA\n\n International conflict, balance of power, energy issues, and the economy were the common themes observed within active intrusion campaigns conducted by Russian actors in 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nstrengthened its military posture and refocused\n\nits strategic agreements. Russia also took several\n\nactions to tighten domestic control on the media,\n\naid groups, and specific political actors. This shift\n\nin stance necessitated an increase in information\n\ngathering for planning, advantage in negotiations,\n\nand security, and that is precisely what has been\n\nobserved within the cyber campaigns of 2015.\n\nIn February, widespread spear phishing conduct\ned by COZY BEAR was detected and analyzed.\n\nThese attacks targeted numerous entities in\n\ngovernment, defense, and non-governmental\n\norganizations (NGOs) in the U.S., Europe, Asia,\n\nand South America. Review of the email distri\nbution lists indicated targets may have been\n\nselected from previously disclosed information\n\nbreaches, such as the Strategic Forecasting,\n\nInc. (STRATFOR) breach. The involvement of\n\npublicly leaked information for targeting has\n\nnot typically been associated with advanced\n\noperators within the Russian sphere, but it could\n\nbe indicative of the greater need to expand\n\ncollection and a willingness to broaden the\n\nresources they consider acceptable for use.\n\nAdditional evidence of intelligence gathering was\n\nseen throughout April, as BERSERK BEAR collec\ntion was directed against the Middle East. While\n\nthe exact targets in this campaign are unknown,\n\nit is known that a major focus was the oil and gas\n\nsector in this region. During the early part of the\n\nyear, Russia took steps to bolster its economy\n\nand buffer the nation against the dual shocks of\n\neconomic sanctions and falling oil prices. Russia\n\nengaged in a number of monetary policy shifts,\n\nparticularly in the form of interest rate changes\n\nat the beginning of the year in order to avoid a\n\nsteep recession. The expansion of reconnaissance\n\nin this region at this time may have been an effort\n\non the part of the Russian government to seek\n\nunderstanding of changes in oil pricing in order\n\nto inform these national economic policies.\n\n\nThe focus in May was squarely on the military,\n\nas Russia celebrated the 70th anniversary\n\nof victory in Europe during WWII. Early in\n\nthe month, Russian Naval forces engaged in\n\nharassment operations in the Baltic Sea as\n\nregional nations attempted to lay undersea cable\n\ninfrastructure between Sweden and Lithuania.\n\nFollowing the annual military parade in Red\n\nSquare, Russian military forces took part in\n\njoint military exercises with Chinese Navy\n\nassets in the Mediterranean. These exercises\n\nunderscored significant strategic cooperation\n\nbetween the two nations, as China and Russia\n\nhad also recently signed a cyber non-aggression\n\npact and agreed to share information involving\n\nissues of law enforcement and security.\n\nIn the background of this regional partnership,\n\nhowever, CrowdStrike observed FANCY BEAR\n\ntargeting Chinese aerospace manufacturers.\n\nIntelligence collected from these campaigns\n\ncould potentially provide Russia with insight into\n\ndecisions involving procurement, as the Chinese\n\nhave been reliant on Russian and Ukrainian\n\nmilitary sales in the past. A postscript to this\n\nactivity may have revealed itself in November,\n\nas China purchased two billion dollars worth\n\nof Sukhoi Su-35 multi-role fighter jets from\n\nRussia. Targeting within this sector provides\n\naccess to information involving development\n\nof Chinese domestic military technologies,\n\nwhich would be of military value to Russia.\n\nMilitary activities continued through the month of\n\nMay as Russia projected its air power westward,\n\nfirst in the form of bomber flights near the UK and\n\nlater in intelligence flights over Estonia. Addition\nally, snap inspections in the northwestern region\n\nof Russia were ordered just as NATO was engag\ning in Arctic Challenge exercises in late May. One\n\nfinal item of note that supports the discussion in\nvolving Russia’s increasing control of information:\n\nPresident Putin signed a decree at the end of May\n\n\n###### “THROUGH THE CREATION\n\n OF STRATEGIC AGREEMENTS\n\n WITH NATIONS IN EASTERN\n\n EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA,\n\n THE FORMATION OF THESE\n\n ALLIANCES GENERATED\n\n CONCERN WITH\n SOME BELIEVING THESE ACTIONS TO BE THE FIRST STEPS TOWARD FURTHER REGIONAL ANNEXATION.”\n\n\n2015. As the U.S. engaged in training with EU and\n\nnon-NATO partners in the region, the Russian mil\nitary also increased its military presence in kind.\n\nConcerns regarding energy security and the\n\neconomy were also at the forefront for Putin as\n\nthe national gas industry, Gazprom, struggled to\n\nsecure agreements for infrastructure and supply\n\nagreements with Europe. As the year progressed\n\nand Russia was impacted by U.S. and EU sanctions\n\nas well as decreases in the global price of oil,\n\nthe Russian economy faced the possibility of\n\nrecession. Perhaps in an effort to hedge against\n\nthese challenges or to gain information to\n\nformulate monetary policy, Russia performed\n\nbroad intelligence-collection campaigns.\n\nAdditional challenges in the energy sphere\n\nincluded regional tensions in Ukraine that pre\ncipitated a series of high-profile events involving\n\nelectrical power infrastructure in the region as\n\nreports in December revealed the involvement\n\nof BlackEnergy malware in an external attack on\n\nat least one power station in western Ukraine.\n\nMajor geopolitical themes impacting Russia closely\n\nalign with the ongoing cyber activity observed in\n\n2015. Considering these activities, in turn, provides\n\na portrait of Russian strategic goals and gives\n\ninsight into capabilities, priorities, and what actions\n\nRussia is willing to take to achieve those ends.\n\n###### RESURGENCE OF RUSSIAN POWER &  EXPANSION OF INTEL GATHERING\n\nt the outset of 2015, Russia was haunted\n\nby the specter of economic sanctions from\n\nthe previous year. The concerted effort by\n\n###### A\n\nwestern powers to compel Russia to withdraw\n\n\nfrom Crimea only made President Putin more\n\nintransigent in his views and led to further shifts\n\naway from cooperation. As Russia sought greater\n\nautonomy from the west this past year, it has also\n\n\n-----\n\ncriminalizing the discussion of military casualties\n\nin special operations, deeming these deaths “state\n\nsecrets”. This action has the potential to support\n\nplausible deniability of involvement in irregular\n\nmilitary campaigns like the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of May, President Putin signed legisla\ntion that banned NGOs that Russia determined to\n\nbe “undesirable” and established the framework\n\nfor prosecution of employees of these groups.\n\nActive targeting of NGOs followed in July as\n\nsome of the objectives from earlier in the year\n\nwere again the focus of COZY BEAR spear\n\nphishing. Major charitable organizations that had\n\nlong been operational in Russia chose to cease\n\noperations and depart the country in late July.\n\nIncluded within this spear phishing campaign\n\nwere targets in government, aerospace, media,\n\nand energy sectors. Interestingly, following\n\nthis reconnaissance gathering, Russia again\n\nadjusted monetary policy. The Russian Central\n\nBank took steps to limit the purchase of foreign\n\ncurrency and adjusted interest rates downward.\n\nVENOMOUS BEAR conducted a wide-scale\n\nstrategic web compromise (SWC) campaign\n\nthroughout 2015 spanning multiple sectors:\n\ngovernment, NGOs, technology, energy, and\n\neducation. Potential motivations for the launch of\n\nthis broad campaign are unclear, but it is possible\n\nthat the SWC may have enabled the actor to\n\ngauge the response to the address President\n\nPutin provided to the UN Security Council on\n\n28 September or to gain insight into planning\n\nand response to the Russian engagement of air\n\noperations in Syria that began in earnest on 30\n\nSeptember. Additional intelligence-gathering\n\nmethods were deployed in early October, most\n\nlikely to either supplement earlier coverage\n\nestablished by the SWC or to add redundancies\n\nin targeting to guarantee collection material from\n\nspecific targets within that earlier campaign.\n\nRussia’s engagement in Syria not only preoccu\n\npied military leaders and the media, but it also\n\ncreated real consequences for Russian citizens\n\nin October when a civilian passenger plane that\n\ndeparted from Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula crashed as\n\na result of an improvised explosive device aboard\n\nthe flight, killing all 224 people aboard. Further\n\nimpacts of the Syrian conflict were felt when a\n\nTurkish fighter shot down a Russian fighter that\n\nwas returning from a mission conducted in Syrian\n\nterritory. This action was viewed with hostility by\n\nthe Kremlin as Turkey, a NATO member, was un\napologetic in its decision to order the shoot down,\n\nan action President Putin described as “a stab in\n\nthe back”. The event elicited both digital and eco\nnomic consequences for the Turkish government\n\nand banking sector, respectively. On 17 December,\n\nseveral Turkish national banks and government\n\nsites were hit by a massive DDoS attack. Simul\ntaneously, the Russian Federal Security Service\n\n(FSB) raided international branches of state\nowned banks for claims of money laundering.\n\nThe end of the year was no less eventful for\n\nthe Russian government. Energy struggles\n\ncontinued to predominate in the conflict in\n\nUkraine, and an attack on a power station in\n\nwestern Ukraine drew speculation of Russian\n\ninvolvement. In his regular question-and-answer\n\nshow, President Putin finally publicly admitted\n\nto a Russian military presence in Ukraine, but he\n\ndownplayed the extent of the engagement.\n\nDomestic crackdowns persisted as warrants\n\nwere issued toward the end of the month for\n\nprominent supporters of democracy in Russia.\n\nAdditionally, companies and organizations that\n\nhad long-term investments or partnerships in the\n\nregion continued to withdraw from the country.\n\nOn the final day of the year, President Putin signed\n\nthe Russian National Security Strategy, officially\n\ncodifying much of the strategy he actively\n\npursued in 2015. The document sets forth goals\n\nand policies intended to raise the global stature\n\nof Russia and contains a significant focus on\n\n\ndomestic initiatives. It also sets the stage for plans\n\nthat Russia aims to implement throughout 2016.\n\n###### THE FIFTH DOMAIN -  THE INFORMATION BATTLESPACE IN UKRAINE\n\nussia has previously employed cyber\n\ncapabilities in conjunction with military\n\ncampaigns, as was observed in the conflict\n\n###### R\n\nin Georgia in 2008. However, many of the tactics,\n\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed in\n\nUkraine are vastly improved from those observed\n\nduring the Georgia campaign. Current cyber TTPs\n\nwere informed by early experiences, driven by na\ntional strategy, and ultimately refined and integrat\ned into military doctrine in December 2014. There\nfore, the continued employment of digital attacks\n\non the military front in 2015 comes as no surprise.\n\nMuch of the clandestine cyber conflict in Ukraine\n\nfocused on directing public sentiment through the\n\napplication of pressure to centers of gravity. Some\n\nof those centers of gravity have been broadly\n\nidentified through current targeting actions as\n\nthe military, energy sectors, media, government,\n\nand and non-governmental organizations.\n\nLooking specifically at the critical infrastructure\n\ncenter of gravity, it is easy to identify a persistent\n\npattern in targeting within the energy sector.\n\nThe Ukrainian energy sector was targeted as\n\nearly as May 2014 when BlackEnergy malware was\n\ndiscovered on power company networks. These\n\nattacks came amid Ukrainian national elections\n\nas well as negotiations for gas purchases from\n\nRussia. Then, in June of 2015, the Russian energy\n\nsector was subjected to DDoS attacks when\n\nGazprom, the Russian state gas industry, and its\n\nassociated bank Gazprombank were targeted.\n\nThese attacks were observed during and sub\nsequent to joint Russia/Ukraine negotiations\n\nregarding the price of natural gas. Then, in late\n\nNovember 2015, physical attacks were directed at\n\n\n###### “THE UKRAINIAN ENERGY \n\n SECTOR WAS TARGETED\n\n AS EARLY AS MAY 2014 WHEN BLACKENERGY MALWARE WAS DISCOVERED ON POWER COMPANY NETWORKS.”\n\n\n-----\n\nmajor power lines that delivered energy from\n\nUkraine to the pro-Russian breakaway region of\n\nCrimea, leaving approximately two million people\n\nin the region without power. In what could be\n\ndescribed as a retributive attack, BlackEnergy\n\nwas again found within energy companies’\n\nnetworks in western Ukraine. In at least one of\n\nthese companies, this malware was associated\n\nwith causing a power outage in the region.\n\nThe totality of these events, from May to the\n\npresent, exemplifies how hybrid conflicts are\n\nconducted across the physical and information\n\nbattlespace, also referred to as “the fifth domain”.\n\nA force able to cause physical effects by leverag\ning the fifth domain is a force to be reckoned with.\n\n\n###### “THERE ARE INDICATIONS  THAT CYBERBERKUT\n HAS TIES TO RUSSIAN STATE SECURITY.” The BERSERK BEAR adversary group has strong ties to\n\nMoscow, as well as technical and operational overlaps\n\nwith other suspected Russian state-sponsored groups\n\nsuch as ENERGETIC BEAR, TEAM BEAR, and VOODOO\n\npurportedly stolen documents on their site.\n\nBEAR.

Numerous high-ranking officials were\n T A R G E T E D I N T R U S I O N S\n executed in 2015 as the young leader Kim Jong Un sought to solidify his control of\n\n the regime. Weapons tests, such as a spring announcement about the test of a Sub\n marine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM), and continued development of the mis\n sile and space programs, further illustrated the intentions of the Democratic Peo\n ple’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to continue agitating the international community.

In terms of\n\noffensive cyber capabilities, the DPRK focused\n\non espionage in 2015 versus more aggressive\n\noperations, which likely supported the require\nments of the DPRK leadership to navigate the\n\nvarious international riffs they created in 2015.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observed multiple\n\nmalware samples with suspected association to\n\nDPRK actors throughout 2015. The majority of\n\nthis malware appears to have been leveraged\n\n\nin activity for intelligence collection rather than\n\ndestructive purposes, and was directed primarily\n\nagainst targets within the RoK. Many of the\n\nsamples were linked back to campaigns begin\nning in 2014, suggesting either a continuation\n\nof previous activity, or a resurgence of those\n\nprograms. The identification of recent malware\n\nsamples—particularly around mid-2015—aligns\n\nwith a period of increased tensions between\n\nthe RoK and the DPRK, lending further credence\n\nthat the activity at the end of 2015 was as\nsociated with operations aimed at gleaning\n\ninformation of value for intelligence purposes.\n\n\n###### T A R G E T E D I N T R U S I O N S\n N.KOREA\n\n 2015 proved to be a tumultuous year on the Korean Peninsula, a year that started off under the cloud of the Sony Pictures Entertainment breach.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### NORTH KOREAN CYBER ESPIONAGE IN 2015\n\north Korean cyber activity in 2015 fits into\n\nthree categories by virtue of the malware\n\nthat was used. Milmanbag was identified\n\n###### N\n\nbeing used against targets in South Korea at the\n\nbeginning of 2015. Hawup utilized previously\n\nunknown vulnerabilities in a popular Korean lan\nguage word processor to deploy. AIMRAT is close\nly related to the infamous Operation Troy. One no\ntable point is that all three malware families were\n\nheavily deployed in August 2015 when relations\n\nbetween the North and South were most strained.\n\n\nthat would be of interest to DPRK intelligence op\nerations and aligns with known DPRK intentions.\n\nNotably, open source reporting in November\n\n2015 acknowledged what appeared to be a\n\nresurgence of malware connected to Operation\n\nTroy (also known as Dark Seoul) campaign from\n\n2013. Malware samples with behavior similar to\n\nthe aforementioned Operation Troy campaign\n\nwere identified dating back to June 2015, more\n\nthan two years after the original attacks in South\n\nKorea were reported. Researchers who revealed\n\nthe activity further noted that these attacks likely\n\nleveraged spear phishing to deliver a Trojanized\n\nversion of a legitimate software installation\n\nexecutable hosted by a company in the industrial\n\ncontrol systems sector. Identified targets included\n\na transportation and logistics sector in Europe.\n\nThis specific targeting could align with RoK’s\n\nparticipation in the Iron Silk Road/Eurasia\n\nInitiative, a plan to connect transport and\n\nenergy infrastructure from Asia through Russia\n\ninto Europe. RoK president Park Geun-hye has\n\nrepeatedly called on North Korea to rebuild the\n\ndisconnected railway sections in the Demilitarized\n\nZone on the North’s side in cooperation with the\n\nproject. In early July 2015, the RoK launched a\n\n20-day train journey through Asia and Europe\n\nin order to raise awareness for the initiative. It\n\nis possible, therefore, that the aforementioned\n\ntransportation targeting was an effort to garner\n\nfurther information on this particular event.\n\nWhile the identification of suspected DPRK-as\nsociated malware could be indicative of either a\n\ncontinuation or resurgence of DPRK espionage\n\noperations, one thing remains clear: DPRK actors\n\nremained active in 2015. As the observed activity\n\nappeared to be primarily directed towards RoK\n\nentities during a period of heightened tensions,\n\nit is highly likely DPRK actors will continue to\n\nstay active through 2016 as tensions between\n\nthe two countries remain unstable.\n\n\ndownloads further malware. As aforementioned,\n\ntool marks in the RAT binaries suggest a similar\n\nprogramming style as the malware used to con\nduct the wiping attack against KHNP in December\n\n2014. In addition, artifacts in the binaries suggest\n\na Korean-speaking author. Based on the use of\n\nHWP documents, it is suspected that RoK entities\n\nwere the primary targets of this malware. This\n\naligns with the previous target scope of Kimsuky\n\noperations in 2013, which targeted multiple RoK\n\nentities in the government and think tank sectors.\n\n\n###### AIMRAT\n\nuring September 2015, CrowdStrike en\ncountered another targeted RAT utilizing\n\nthe AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) protocol\n\n###### D\n\nfor Command and Control (C2), which is now\n\nreferred to as AIMRAT. The AIMRAT malware\n\nuses the Open System for CommunicAtion in\n\nRealtime (OSCAR) protocol to communicate with\n\nits controller, which is likely to consist of a custom\n\nGraphical User Interface (GUI) program sharing\n\ncommon code with the RAT. The RAT uses a set of\n\nAIM accounts set up in advance by the attackers.\n\nThe use of a normally benign protocol, and the\n\ninclusion of various obfuscation and anti-analysis\n\nfeatures over the observed course of the RAT’s\n\ndevelopment from early 2014 to late 2015,\n\nsuggests that the operators have some concern\n\nfor operational security (OPSEC) considerations.\n\nAlthough the infection vector used to deploy the\n\nRAT is unknown, the small scale of the activity\n\nsuggests that it is highly targeted in nature.\n\nTechnical analysis of AIMRAT also revealed the\n\nactivity associated with the malware appeared\n\nto be carried out by likely Korean-speaking\n\nactors since at least January 2014 through\n\nJuly 2015. Additionally, there were identified\n\ninstances of the malware author using the\n\nword “Troy” in place of Trojan in a number\n\nof identified samples, a naming convention\n\nidentified in the public reporting on DPRK\n\nactivity known as Operation Troy in 2013.\n\nThe timing of the other identified DPRK-associ\nated samples appears to be directly associated\n\nwith increased tensions between DPRK and RoK.\n\nThe majority of identified samples appear to have\n\nbeen created around July and August 2015 when\n\nlandmine blasts, loudspeakers blaring propaganda,\n\nan exchange of artillery fire, and threats of hos\ntilities quickly increased tensions between DPRK\n\nand RoK. Espionage targeting against RoK entities\n\nduring this time frame would yield information\n\n\n###### MILMANBAG\n\nn January 2015, CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nidentified three exploit documents leveraging\n\nidentical shellcode to that which was identified\n\n###### I\n\nin the attacks against the networks of Korea Hydro\n\n& Nuclear Power Co. Ltd (KHNP) by suspected\n\nDPRK actors in late 2014. The first of the exploit\n\ndocuments dropped a destructive Master Boot\n\nRecord (MBR) wiping malware that matched the\n\nmalware found at KHNP. However, the two other\n\nexploit documents dropped a Remote Access Tool\n\n(RAT) and a keylogger. Analysis of the RAT—known\n\nas Milmanbag—revealed notable similarities to an\n\nespionage campaign identified in 2013 against\n\nRoK entities known publically as “Kimsuky”. After\n\nCrowdStrike began tracking the Milmanbag RAT,\n\nfurther identified samples revealed activity occur\nring in August 2015, leading to the assessment that\n\nthe actors behind this campaign remained active or\n\nhad resurfaced. While the infection vector remains\n\nunconfirmed, it is believed to be delivered via\n\nspear phishing, as some instances of the malware\n\nare known to have been spread through exploit\n\ndocuments targeting the Hangul Word Processor\n\n(HWP) software.

The\n\ncreation of a custom-made lure document from a\n\nblog post is interesting, as advanced adversaries\n\ntend to use pre-existing documents, often to\n\nmaintain the air of legitimacy. Additionally, given\n\nthe date of the article, it is possible this lure was\n\ncreated and leveraged as early as January 2014.\n\nThe use of a subject lure directly associated with\n\na company specializing in user management\n\nand authentication services also suggests a\n\nvery specific target scope for this activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Several notable geopolitical events occurred in Iran during 2015 that shaped  cyber activity, and will continue to do so into 2016. The most important of  these was the finalization of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)  that occurred in July 2015. \n\n\nThe JCPOA, an agreement reached to ensure\n\na peaceful end to Iran’s nuclear program,\n\ndominated the coverage of Iran in 2015. Iran’s\n\nimplementation of the requirements laid out\n\nin the JCPOA will lead to the long-term lifting\n\nof sanctions currently related to Iran’s nuclear\n\nprogram. The JCPOA’s “Implementation Day” is\n\nthe day Iran confirms it has met all obligations of\n\nthe JCPOA agreement and economic sanctions\n\nwill be terminated (but can be reinstated in the\n\nevent of significant non-compliance). Imple\nmentation day occurred on 16 January 2016.\n\nThe Iranian government seems to distinctly\n\nunderstand that the lifting of sanctions, in\ncluding the unfreezing of financial assets and\n\nthe subsequent influx of funds and revenue as\n\nIran reopens trade internationally, also comes\n\nwith a certain corresponding infiltration of\n\nwestern influence. There were already political\n\nmachinations occurring in 2015 that allow the\n\nIranian government to better prepare to combat\n\n\nthese influences using its cyber capabilities,\n\nsuch as the renewed appointment of members\n\nof the Supreme Council of Virtual Space.\n\nThe Iranian government also showed constant\n\nattention to Islamic values and the Internet.\n\nIran is taking the advantages of the Internet for\n\nIran’s economic and Islam’s cultural benefit very\n\nseriously as implementation of the JCPOA nears,\n\nbut it is recognizing the significant impact western\n\ninfluence can have. It is highly likely Iran intends\n\nto use all the resources at its disposal, including\n\nnational cyber capabilities of censoring and mon\nitoring, to diminish the impact as far as possible.\n\nPortions of Iran’s 6th Five-Year Plan (6th FYP,\n\n2016-2021) also reveal the Iranian government’s\n\nfocus on improving national cyber capabilities.\n\nSuch improvements support many national\n\ngoals, several of which are likely to continue to\n\ncontrol and censor the flow of information in Iran\n\nand strengthen national capabilities to support\n\nIran’s aspirations toward regional hegemony.\n\n\n###### T A R G E T E D I N T R U S I O N S\n IRAN\n\n Several notable geopolitical events occurred in Iran during 2015 that shaped cyber activity, and will continue to do so into 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\nafter reportedly receiving a communication from\n\nIranian officials requesting monitoring tools for the\n\nprogram. Iranian officials deny the accusations.\n\nMost notably, the arrests send the message\n\nto the Iranian populace that although Internet\n\nusers in Iran can access banned or blocked\n\nwebsites via Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),\n\nthe Cyber Police continue to monitor users’\n\nactivities and are willing to arrest those acting\n\nin opposition to the beliefs and values of Islam.\n\n###### SUPREME LEADER STREAMLINES  AND OBTAINS FURTHER  CONTROL OVER THE INTERNET\n\nThe Iranian government’s focus on strength\nening and improving its cyber capabilities can\n\nbe seen clearly when observing the events\n\naround the recent reappointments for members\n\nof the Supreme Council of Virtual Space by\n\nAyatollah KHAMENEI on 5 September 2015.\n\nThe Supreme Council was first established in\n\nMarch 2012, nearly two years after the discovery\n\nof Stuxnet in June 2010, while Iran was still in\n\nthe early stages of improving its cyber defenses\n\nand capabilities. There are some criticisms,\n\nmostly by hardliners, that once President Rouhani\n\ntook office in 2013, the Supreme Council of\n\nVirtual Space was effectively non-existent, as\n\nRouhani’s administration attempted to push\n\nInternet initiatives and push back on hardlin\ners’ strict laws banning or blocking them.\n\nThose chosen for positions include the president,\n\nseveral ministers, the IRGC, and police chiefs.\n\nThe leaders chosen for the positions were not as\n\nsurprising given the move the Supreme Leader\n\nmade once choosing them—to give the authority\n\nof Internet policy and regulation within Iran\n\ncompletely to the Council by dissolving similar\n\nresponsibilities in other government entities\n\nand putting them under the responsibility of\n\n\nMarch that the program would be expanded\n\nto include other messaging and social media\n\napps, such as Instagram, Viber, and WhatsApp.\n\nIn June, another individual was arrested, ac\ncused of starting 23 anti-cultural groups on the\n\nmessaging applications LINE and WhatsApp.\n\nAt least 11 others were reported, also in June,\n\nand arrested for “anti-security activities” on\n\nsocial media and for corruption using social\n\nmedia. Lastly, in August, it was reported that\n\nfour individuals were arrested for “promot\ning prostitution and blasphemy” online.\n\n###### “ ONCE PRESIDENT ROUHANI TOOK OFFICE IN 2013, THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF VIRTUAL SPACE WAS EFFECTIVELY NON-EXISTENT, AS  ROUHANI’S ADMINISTRATION ATTEMPTED TO PUSH INTERNET INITIATIVES AND PUSH BACK ON HARDLINERS’ STRICT LAWS BANNING OR BLOCKING THEM. ”\n\nThis is not the first time the Iranian government\n\nhas been concerned about the influence of\n\nwestern online social media and messaging\n\napplications. Facebook and Twitter have been\n\nbanned since the 2009 elections, believed by\n\nthe Iranian government to have contributed to\n\nthe protests. Gmail, Yahoo, and Google were\n\nbanned from February through October 2012.\n\nIn January 2015, online apps LINE, WhatsApp, and\n\nTango were under threat of ban. Further, in Octo\nber 2015, encrypted messaging app Telegram ex\nperienced interruptions and two days of blocking\n\n\n###### “THE BLACK SPIDER\n\n PROGRAM REPORTEDLY HAD\n\n BEEN DEVELOPED SOLELY\n\n AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TOOL\n\n FOR FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS, MONITORING APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MILLION ACCOUNTS FOR CONTENT CONTRARY TO ISLAMIC VALUES.\n\n HOWEVER, IRANIAN\n\n OFFICIALS ALSO STATED IN\n\n MARCH THAT THE PROGRAM\n\n WOULD BE EXPANDED TO\n\n INCLUDE OTHER MESSAGING\n\n AND SOCIAL MEDIA APPS,\n\n SUCH AS INSTAGRAM,\n\n VIBER, AND WHATSAPP.”\n\n\n###### BLACK SPIDER AND THE  ARRESTS OF IRANIANS\n\nn March, the Iranian Cyber Police reported\n\n12 arrests that took place in January, which\n\nincluded Iranian student activists. Notably,\n\n###### I\n\ntwo of the students were previously arrested in\n\nthe 2009 election protests and were members\n\nof the Green Movement. Those students, and\n\nothers like them, had likely been continuously\n\nmonitored for other opportunities of arrest. The\n\nIranian Cyber Police stated they had employed\n\na program called Black Spider to investigate\n\nthe suspects’ Facebook accounts and had\n\narrested them for various crimes including\n\nposting content contrary to Islamic values.\n\nThe Black Spider program reportedly had been\n\ndeveloped solely as an investigative tool for Face\nbook accounts, monitoring approximately eight\n\nmillion accounts for content contrary to Islamic\n\nvalues. However, Iranian officials also stated in\n\n\nDuring 2015, law enforcement appeared to\n\nstep up arrests of Iranian Internet users posting\n\nunacceptable content online. Authorities\n\nannounced the use of technical programs,\n\nsuch as Black Spider, to locate and arrest\n\nIranian social media users, sending the message\n\npublicly that circumventing government filters\n\nmay allow visitation of blocked websites,\n\nbut does not protect Iranians from arrest.\n\n###### IRANIAN CONTROL OF WESTERN INFLUENCE\n\nIn 2015 the Iranian regime sought to shield the\n\ncountry’s netizens from dissident and pro-demo\ncratic ideas. These actions ultimately meant to pre\nvent the infusion of western ideology into Iran re\nsulted in the arrest of individuals who were seen as\n\nproblematic to the regime. Internally, Iran’s targeted\n\ncyber operations included reports of arrests of Ira\nnians for their online activities, largely for charges\n\nthat are variations of offending Islam or blasphemy.\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Council. This established ultimate authority\n\nof Iran’s Internet censorship and the develop\nment of the National Internet ultimately under\n\nthe government entity answering to him.\n\nAyatollah KHAMENEI then called for members of\n\nthe Council to quickly bring Iran out of its “existing\n\npassivity in cyberspace” and provided guidance\n\nfor them to work quickly on the National Internet,\n\nalso giving them the equally large task of develop\ning administrative and organizational parameters\n\nfor cyberspace such as security, legal, judicial, and\n\nan enforcement system among others, such as\n\nconsidering how to protect Islamic values online.\n\nThe efforts of the Iranian leadership in 2015 clearly\n\ndepict a regime struggling with the benefits\n\nand the threats of the impending JCPOA and\n\nthe outside influence that is attached to it. On\n\nthe one hand is much-needed economic relief\n\nfrom the years of isolating sanctions, on the\n\nother, the influence of western ideology that\n\nthreatens to come during crucial election cycles.\n\n\nmedia websites replicating western originals.\n\nNow that Iran is experiencing the challenge of\n\nreopening international trade while attempting\n\nto filter out western and un-Islamic ideals that\n\ncould come with it, the government has increased\n\npolitical will to complete some variation of a more\n\nshielded National Internet as a part of the solution.\n\nTo this end, Iran announced—once in January\n\n2014 and again in June 2015—that China would\n\ncooperate with Iran in the continued development\n\nand completion of Iran’s National Internet.\n\nAnother emphasis for the information, communi\ncation and technology sector (ICT) improvement\n\nby the Supreme Leader in the 6th FYP is to in\ncrease the number of indigenous social networks\n\nby at least five times. Indigenous social networks\n\nwould ease the ability of the government to\n\nmonitor users’ posts for any western influence,\n\ncontent contrary to Islamic beliefs, and threats\n\nto the regime, yet allow the Iranian population\n\nto continue to share in the widespread pastime\n\nand potential revenue-generating platform.\n\nThe 6th FYP also calls for increased infrastructure\n\ninvestments in the ICT sector to mirror the level\n\nof infrastructure in top countries in the region.\n\nThis effort undoubtedly enhances the daily life\n\nof millions of Iranians and provides vital enabling\n\ninfrastructure for what will be a rapidly expanding\n\ne-commerce system, but it also provides a stronger\n\nbackbone from which to conduct cyber operations.\n\nReference is made by the Supreme Leader to\n\nimproving cyber capability in the 6th FYP with\n\nregard to defense and security. The statement\n\nis to allocate at least five percent of the public\n\nbudget for defense to “increase the balance”\n\nas a regional power. In accomplishing this, the\n\nobjective is to create a soft power capacity and\n\nprovide cyber defense and cyber security defense\n\nfor infrastructure. However, it is not clear what\n\nthe distinction is between cyber defense and\n\ncyber security defense, as the two seem closely\n\n\nrelated and no additional details are provided.\n\nLastly, and not surprisingly considering the Iranian\n\ngovernment’s current obsession over the threat\n\nof western influence, there is one last reference\n\nin the 6th FYP regarding improving Iran’s cyber\n\ncapabilities. When discussing the future improve\nments for Iran’s culture, a focus is given to create\n\nan online presence for cultural and government\n\ninstitutions to promote “culture, concepts and\n\nIslamic identity” and also to “counter Iranian\n\nthreats”. The threat to Iranian and Islamic culture\n\nis clearly a great concern for Ayatollah KHAMENEI.\n\nHowever, there are no details about exactly how\n\nthe government would counter “Iranian threats”. It\n\nis not likely the threats are being solely considered\n\nforeign threats. It is more likely that Iranians\n\nliving in Iran will come under great scrutiny of the\n\naffiliations they develop with foreigners going\n\nforward, and any perception of them disseminat\ning western ideals as a threat against Islam or the\n\nIranian government. Additionally, foreigners in\n\nIran will likely be under great scrutiny as well.\n\n\n###### “IRAN ANNOUNCED—ONCE\n\n IN JANUARY 2014 AND AGAIN\n\n IN JUNE 2015—THAT CHINA WOULD COOPERATE WITH IRAN IN THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLETION OF IRAN’S NATIONAL INTERNET.”\n\n\n###### IRAN PRIORITIZES ITS NATIONAL INTERNET, NETWORK INFRASTRUC- TURE, AND CYBER CAPABILITIES\n\nn 30 June 2015, just before the final\nization of the JCPOA, Supreme Leader\n\nAyatollah Ali KHAMENEI revealed the\n\n###### O\n\noutline of Iran’s 6th Five-Year Plan (6th FYP).\n\nWithin the 6th FYP there are several areas\n\nthat show Iran’s upcoming focus of improving\n\nits infrastructure and cyber capabilities.\n\nThe first priority over the next five years is to gain\n\n“superior status in the region” with the develop\nment of the National Information Network (Na\ntional Internet).

The campaign used CVE\n2012-0158 and lures that referenced the U.S./Iran\n\nnuclear agreement as well as regional issues.\n\nUnderground hacking groups in India have also\n\nunited to address the ISIS threat.

The activity consisted\n\n of the recruitment of civilian hackers on the part of the Colombian security\n\n services for the purpose of spying on various targets. The main objectives were\n\n members of the FARC-EP insurgent force, but there were also victims among\n\n foreign government officials, human rights activists, and local politicians.\n\n\nThe principal attack vector for this campaign\n\nappears be spear phishing emails featuring lure\n\ndocuments thematically ranging from politics to\n\nmusic to pornography. The victim’s computer is\n\nthen infected with files from the Ragua toolkit\n\nthat is disguised as Java. The toolkit is uniquely\n\nattributed to this group and its usage dates\n\nback to at least 2008. It contains features such\n\nas logging of keystrokes and the clipboard;\n\ncapturing of audio; geolocation; screenshots;\n\nand exfiltration of files from the local hard drive\n\nor attached USB drives to a remote server or\n\na specially prepared USB storage medium.\n\nThe authors chose Python as the programming\n\nlanguage, converted the scripts to stand-alone\n\nWindows executables, and wrapped a Nullsoft\n\nScriptable Install System (NSIS) installer around\n\nthem, also including a decoy. This leads to very\n\nlarge files sizes and is, together with the choice\n\nof Python as the primary programming language,\n\nan indicator of rather low sophistication.\n\nThe context for the case is closely linked to\n\nthe evolving reality of Colombian politics and\n\nnational security policies. The Andromeda cell\n\n(and similar initiatives) was established by the\n\nColombian military during times of open conflict\n\n\nbetween the government and armed groups like\n\nFARC-EP and ELN. The president at the time was\n\nÁlvaro Uribe, and the Minister of Defense was Juan\n\nManuel Santos. By the time Santos was elected to\n\nsucceed Uribe, FARC-EP was reeling from military\n\noperations, and peace negotiations in Havana\n\nwere initiated. However, the evidence suggests\n\nthat not only did the Andromeda cell continue\n\nto target conflict-related objectives, but it also\n\nbegan targeting the Santos administration itself\n\nin retaliation for its perceived softness on FARC.\n\nDespite the fact that this campaign is known\n\nto have been dismantled, with some of its\n\nparticipants prosecuted by the executive and\n\njudiciary branches of the Colombian government,\n\nCrowdStrike is currently monitoring continuing\n\nactivity. This activity may be an indicator that\n\nthe Colombian state’s ample security apparatus\n\nstill possesses cyber-intelligence units that\n\noperate with little or no civilian supervision.\n\nPotential targets are the negotiations in Havana,\n\nand the Santos government and its former allies\n\n(now bitter rivals) in the Álvaro Uribe camp.

A number of different families\n\nhave emerged in the wake of the success of the\n\nnow-defunct CryptoLocker, with its successor\n\nCryptoWall, in its fourth generation, emerging as\n\nthe file-encrypting malware of choice. Crypto\nWall’s success was likely fueled by the adver\nsary’s ability to adapt, reading blogs by research\ners and security vendors about weaknesses in\n\ntheir product and then fixing them. Early versions\n\nof CryptoWall, for example, stored the private\n\ndecryption key locally on machines, enabling\n\nvictims to trivially decrypt their files until this\n\ninformation was made public. CryptoWall is far\n\nfrom the only ransomware available, with large\n\ncampaigns emerging toward the end of 2015 of\n\nthe new Teslacrypt and reappearance of Nymaim,\n\na loader that also contains a locker component.\n\n- \u0007Phishing emails continued to dominate crime\nware distribution throughout the year as the\n\nprimary mechanism used for the aforementioned\n\nbanking Trojans and ransomware threats. 2015\n\nsaw an increase in popularity of Office-based\n\nmacros for distributing malware, and a variety\n\nof Microsoft Word and Excel macro builder\n\nkits have become available on the criminal\n\nunderground. Some kits have added complexity\n\nthat includes macros that drop Visual Basic\n\nand Powershell scripts to disk to fetch files\n\nfrom compromised URLs, and in some cases\n\neven deploying these scripts in encrypted\n\nform via cloud services such as Pastebin or\n\nDropbox. Removing these interim scripts after\n\na campaign hampers researchers’ efforts in\n\ntracking these threats, which elongates the\n\nlifespan of the payload on infected hosts.\n\n\n\n- \u0007In addition to phishing attachments, exploit\n\nkit usage rose throughout 2015 fueled by the\n\nwealth of Flash vulnerabilities and associated\n\nexploits. This is a similar trend to the effect\n\nthe availability of Java exploits had on the\n\nexploit kit market back in 2012/2013. Angler\n\nhas emerged as the current leader partly due\n\nto the agility of the adversary in incorporating\n\nnew exploits such as those made available\n\nin the Hacking Team leak. It is also due to\n\nthe use of techniques adopted by the Angler\n\ndevelopers such as virtual machine checks,\n\nchecks for analysis tools, constantly altering\n\nobfuscation and URLs to prevent detection,\n\nand even adopting Diffie-Hellman into the\n\nencryption process of exploits to prevent\n\nanalysis. Other kits have been close behind\n\nwith Nuclear, Rig, and Neutrino all showing\n\nan increase in use throughout the year.\n\n- \u0007Botnet takedowns were less prominent this\n\nyear than last, but successful operations did\n\ntake place. During September 2015, the United\n\nKingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA) led an\n\noperation to sinkhole a large portion of the Dri\ndex botnet in conjunction with arresting Andrey\n\nGhinkul (a.k.a.

This caused a hiatus of Dridex with\n\na break in spam runs but saw the adversaries\n\nthen re-emerge throughout October with further\n\naggressive spam campaigns to rebuild their\n\nbotnets. This highlights the delicate relationship\n\nbetween technical operations and arrests where\n\nactors outside accessible jurisdictions have the\n\nmotivation and resources necessary to rebuild\n\nand carry on an operation after a takedown. In\n\ncontrast, in February Europol led a technical\n\noperation to take down and sinkhole the Ramnit\n\nbotnet. This did not see the actors attempt to\n\nrebuild their botnet, suggesting they may have\n\nfewer resources available or that they have\n\nalternative means of generating their revenue.\n\n\n###### TRENDS IN ECRIME ACTIVITY - 2015\n\n       - \u0007In 2014, CrowdStrike predicted the increased difficult to track second-stage hosts.

Leveraging far-reaching botnets—so\ncalled “stressers” or “booter” services—the goal\n\nof these financially motivated actors is not to\n\npermanently cripple a brand or business, but\n\ninstead to temporarily disrupt their target’s web\n\npresence for long enough to coerce a ransom\n\npayment in exchange for ceasing the attack.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence tracks multiple extortive\n\ncriminal groups, including the infamous group\n\nDDOS 4 Bitcoins, or DD4BC, which pioneered\n\nthe techniques replicated by other follow-on\n\ncriminal gangs. DD4BC actors, tracked by\n\nCrowdStrike as PIZZO SPIDER, primarily target\n\nbusinesses that provide payment processing\n\nvia Bitcoin or that otherwise have a nexus to\n\ncrypto-currency within their product offerings.\n\nOriginally beginning their operations in late 2014,\n\nthe group continues to follow a consistent pattern\n\nof simultaneously initiating a low-intensity (5-10\n\nGbps) DDOS attack on a target while at the\n\nsame time making contact privately via email\n\nto demand a ransom payment. Ransom notes\n\nfrom the group follow a routine format, with\n\nan introduction and explanation of the group’s\n\nprevious exploits and DDoS power, followed\n\nby a demand for a varying amount of Bitcoins.\n\nThe group also includes threats of increasingly\n\npowerful DDoS attacks and costs to resolve\n\nthe attacks if payment is not made promptly.\n\nPIZZO SPIDER actors have not utilized social\n\nmedia platforms to call out targets during the\n\ninitial stages of attacks, likely in an effort to allow\n\ntargets to retain plausible deniability during\n\nthat phase. A targeted company identified by\n\nthe actors as paying the ransom could face\n\n\nsocial media backlash for kowtowing to the\n\ngroup’s demands, and cause future targets to\n\nbe less likely to respond to ransom demands.\n\nIn 2015, extortion schemes carried out by PIZZO\n\nSPIDER broadened from Bitcoin mining pools,\n\ngambling websites, and virtual currency-based\n\nbusinesses to include larger and more mainstream\n\ncompanies and major financial institutions in\n\nthe U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. More than\n\n100 different attacks believed to be attributed\n\nto PIZZO SPIDER were observed in 2015,\n\nprompting CERTs and regulatory associations in\n\nmultiple countries to issue warnings about the\n\nthreat posed by DD4BC, leading to the arrest\n\nof two individuals associated with the group.\n\nThe success of PIZZO SPIDER has not gone\n\nunnoticed and has enticed copycat actors to\n\nemulate their TTPs. A group of criminal actors\n\noperating under the name Armada Collective\n\nbegan extortive DDoS operations in late 2015.\n\nThe group primarily targeted secure email\n\nproviders using an attack playbook almost\n\ndirectly copied from DD4BC. Attacks by Armada\n\nCollective are believed to be largely ineffective,\n\nwith actual DDoS capabilities falling well short\n\nof the group’s claimed 1 Tbps attack power.\n\nA notable event in Armada Collective attacks\n\noccurred after an initial DDoS campaign target\ning secure webmail provider ProtonMail. After\n\nProtonMail administrators paid the initial ransom\n\nto anonymous Bitcoin wallets belonging to Ar\nmada Collective attackers, a second significantly\n\nstronger DDoS attack was undertaken. Follow-up\n\ncomments from Armada Collective on social me\ndia disavowed responsibility for the second wave\n\nof attacks and stated the group did not have the\n\nresources for the sustained 50 Gbps of traffic that\n\ndisabled ProtonMail. No actors have since come\n\nforward to claim responsibility, leading to specu\nlation that nation-state-sponsored attackers with\n\na vested interest in knocking the crowdsourced\n\n\nsecure email provider offline used the Armada\n\nCollective attacks as a cover for their actions.\n\nThe anonymous nature of these attackers, com\nbined with the high media profile surrounding\n\nthe attacks, has lead to the possibility of differing\n\ngroups of attackers using the name and tactics of\n\nArmada Collective for their own uses. In late 2015,\n\nthree Greek banks were targeted by attackers\n\nusing the Armada Collective name and TTPs,\n\nhowever a significant difference was seen in the\n\namount of ransom demanded by the attackers. In\n\nthis case more than 20,000 Bitcoins were de\nmanded, a ransom equal to more than 7.2 million\n\ndollars at the time of the attack. This exponentially\n\nlarger ransom was out of character for previous\n\nArmada Collective attacks, which demanded\n\n20-50 Bitcoins from their targets. In the case of\n\nProtonMail, Armada Collective even refunded a\n\nportion of the ransom once the DDoS was sus\ntained by unknown actors after the initial attack.\n\nThese criminal actions, while illegal in many\n\ncountries, are extremely difficult and expensive\n\nto mitigate once an attack commences. Many\n\nof these attacks abate due to the attacker’s\n\nshort attention span, or over-stated capabilities,\n\nrunning out. While DDoS attacks are hardly a new\n\nphenomenon, organized criminal groups utilizing\n\ntheir skills and botnets for extortive attacks\n\nrecently re-emerged with a now-proven efficacy.\n\n###### INTELLIGENCE-POWERED  SOCIAL ENGINEERING SCAMS\n\nhe prevalence of social engineering\n\nschemes using inside knowledge of the\n\ntarget flourished in 2015. These scams,\n\n###### T\n\nwhich seem to be perpetrated by Nigeria-based\n\ncriminal groups, may be responsible for the\n\nlargest heists in 2015. CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\ntracked scammers who successfully conducted\n\nsocial engineering operations against numerous\n\norganizations across multiple business verticals\n\n\nduring the last year. These operations leverage\n\nsocial engineering techniques to deceive finan\ncial personnel into transferring money to crimi\nnals masquerading as representatives of orga\nnizations doing business with the target. The\n\nnecessary knowledge about the target organi\nzation, including the identity of vendors, social\n\nconventions, and organizational structure, is\n\nmost likely acquired in a preparation step, using\n\ncommodity malware or openly available tools\n\nsuch as njRAT, Netwire, and Keybase keylogger.\n\nGenerally, these scams fit into one of two sce\nnarios. In the first, the attacker will construct an\n\nemail from a corporate executive, spoofing the\n\nReply to field or using an approximate domain\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BLURRING LINES BETWEEN  CRIMINAL AND ESPIONAGE ACTIVITY\n\nn the past, malware has often been distin\nguished as being either commodity or specif\nically crafted to fit a certain target. Often, this\n\n###### I\n\nclassification of the malware indicates the class\n\nof the incident: Obviously, a sample of a malware\n\nfamily known to engage in spam campaigns is\n\nunlikely to have been used as part of a targeted\n\nespionage attack. Vice versa, a malware with pure\n\nsurveillance functionality does not fit a botnet-­like\n\nmonetization technique that relies on large-scale\n\ndistributed activities such as sending spam or\n\ndenial of service. In turn, the type of the incident\n\nreflected the actor’s motivation, often ranging\n\nfrom pure financial gain to state-sponsored intel\nligence gathering. While certainly applicable to\n\nsome cases, this distinction is no longer exclusive.\n\nThere are a number of examples that highlight\n\nthat the boundaries between commodity and\n\ntargeted attack malware blur. TeamViewer remote\n\nadministration software is a classic example of a\n\ntool used for both cyber espionage and criminal\n\nactivity. CrowdStrike tracks a Russia-based\n\nadversary, TEAM BEAR, that primarily used\n\nTeamViewer in targeted intrusion campaigns\n\nfocused on political and military institutions in\n\ncountries of interest to the Russian state. Crowd\nStrike has also observed a number of criminal\n\ncampaigns leveraging the TeamViewer tool.\n\nA more recent example of the crossover between\n\ncyber espionage and criminal campaigns occurred\n\nIn spring 2015, when CrowdStrike identified a\n\nmalware family it refers to as DownRage, which\n\nis used by the Russia-based adversary FANCY\n\nBEAR to conduct targeted intrusions. This\n\nmalware exhibits code overlap with the Carberp\n\nbanking Trojan. One explanation could be that\n\nCarberp and DownRage were authored by the\n\nsame entity. However, given Carberp’s source\n\ncode leak in mid-2013, it is equally reasonable\n\n\n###### “THE ATTACKER WILL\n\n ATTEMPT TO MODIFY\n\n THE PAYMENT ACCOUNT,\n\n CAUSING THE VICTIM TO UNKNOWINGLY DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS- PAYABLE FUNDS TO ATTACKERS VERSUS THE LEGITIMATE VENDOR ACCOUNT.”\n\n\n—which may only be registered temporarily\n\nusing a technique known as domain tasting—to\n\ntrick the recipient. The scam varies and is often\n\ncreated completely manually, making very\n\nspecific targeting possible and also indicating\n\ndifferent approaches by different advisaries.\n\nIn some cases the actor will simply request\n\nmoney to be sent to a specific account; in more\n\ncomplex schemes, they will spoof the first\n\nemail from a corporate executive and reference\n\nusing outside counsel. Soon after, someone\n\npurporting to be outside counsel will contact\n\nthe victim with specifics of the transaction. In\n\nat least one scam, the attacker held numerous\n\ntelephone conversations with the victim from\n\na mobile phone number. The payments may be\n\nrequested in incremental amounts or in a lump\n\nsum, again pointing to multiple adversaries.\n\nThe second scenario became more preva\nlent in the latter half of 2015, with the actor\n\ntargeting accounts payable offices spoofing\n\nvendors known to the victim. The attacker\n\nwill attempt to modify the payment account,\n\ncausing the victim to unknowingly deposit\n\naccounts-payable funds to attackers versus the\n\nlegitimate vendor account. These attacks may\n\ngo unnoticed for months until the accounts\n\npayable department is contacted by the vendor.\n\nOrganizations across all sectors should remain\n\nvigilant for these types of scams. Emails\n\nrequesting the transfer of money should be\n\nvalidated by multiple individuals to assure\n\nthat payment to the intended organization is\n\nappropriate and that the account information\n\nprovided is correct. Personnel should be trained\n\nin methods to verify that emails requesting\n\ntransfer of funds are coming from legitimate email\n\naddresses and not from spoofed addresses.\n\n\n###### “CROWDSTRIKE IDENTIFIED A MALWARE FAMILY IT REFERS TO AS DOWNRAGE,\n\n WHICH IS USED BY THE\n\n RUSSIA-BASED ADVERSARY\n\n FANCY BEAR TO CONDUCT\n\n TARGETED INTRUSIONS.\n\n THIS MALWARE EXHIBITS\n\n CODE OVERLAP WITH THE\n\n CARBERP BANKING TROJAN.”\n\n\n-----\n\n###### “THROUGH THE USE OF\n\n STEGANOGRAPHY, IT IS ABLE TO HIDE\n\n MALICIOUS CODE IN INNOCUOUS\n\n IMAGES. AT THE SAME TIME, BENIGN\n\n IMAGE-HOSTING WEBSITES SERVE AS\n\n PEERS IN ORDER TO DISTRIBUTE THE\n\n MALICIOUS CODE— A SUCCESSFUL WAY TO EVADE REPUTATION-BASED PROTECTION MEANS AND A CHALLENGE FOR TAKEDOWN ATTEMPTS.”\n\n\nthat DownRage was deliberately made to look similar for\n\ndecoy purposes. Possibly, the FANCY BEAR malware was\n\nintended to be misattributed to alleged Carberp operations\n\nin order to cover traces of targeted attack activity and\n\nblend in with the bulk of commodity malware in the wild.\n\nAs another example, variants of Black Energy, a malware\n\nfamily traditionally used for distributed denial­-of-­service\n\n(DDoS) attacks, have been adapted for targeted attacks. In this\n\nspecific case, it is likely that Black Energy was shared among\n\nmultiple actors, and thus it is reasonable to assume that the\n\ngroups performing DDoS attacks are separate from those\n\nconducting intelligence-gathering and disk wiping operations.\n\nResearch into the Gameover Zeus botnet suggests that\n\nsometimes typical cybercrime activities and intelligence\n\ngathering are performed by the same actor. While publicly\n\nwell known for its banking fraud and the distribution of\n\nadditional malware such as CryptoLocker, the peer-­to-­\n\npeer-­based Gameover Zeus botnet was leveraged to search\n\nfor information regarding foreign intelligence services of\n\nRussia’s neighbouring countries. In short, some crimeware\n\ntools have turned into targeted attack malware and no\n\nlonger allow a precise classification in either category.\n\nIn 2015, the Stegoloader malware was an example of a stealthy\n\nand sophisticated tool that fits this category. Through the\n\nuse of steganography, it is able to hide malicious code in\n\ninnocuous images. At the same time, benign image-hosting\n\nwebsites serve as peers in order to distribute the mali\ncious code—a successful way to evade reputation-based\n\nprotection means and a challenge for takedown attempts.\n\nVerbose profiling of an infected computer allows the oper\nator to selectively deploy modules required for a specific\n\npurpose, such as monetization, or intelligence gathering.\n\nPossibly as a consequence of the confluence of cybercrim\ninal and espionage activities, tomorrow’s malware may\n\nlikely develop into a multi-purpose tool that provides a\n\nplatform suitable for a wide variety of malicious operations.\n\nSuch an open-ended architecture and the complexities\n\ninvolved in determining the actor’s intent is likely to pose\n\na research challenge to defenders in the near future.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### G L O B A L T H R E A T R E P O R T\n\n## HACKTIVIST\n\nHacktivist activity may occur in concert with geo\npolitical issues such as the controversial Canadian\n\nAnti-Terrorism Act (C-51), which resulted in widespread\n\nDDoS against Canadian government organizations.\n\nIt can also manifest in the form of social activism\n\n###### Hacktivism is the loose cannon of such as the DDoS attacks against targets in Bal\ntimore, Maryland following the funeral service for\n\nFreddie Gray, a man who died in police custody.\n\n###### the threat landscape.

Understanding the motivation\n\nand core ethos of hacktivist groups can help\n\norganizations be prepared to defend themselves\n\nagainst these aggressors; no matter how\n\naltruistic their beliefs may be, the disruption\n\nand damage they cause can be quite real.\n\n\n2015 consisted largely of sensational but unsub\nstantiated threats and claims of responsibility.\n\nIn August 2015, the self-styled hacktivist group\n\nRemember EMAD claimed that it carried out an\n\nattack on U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)\n\nnetworks and threatened to leak the allegedly\n\npilfered data. No subsequent data leaks were\n\nobserved and the group’s claims could not be\n\nverified. Remember EMAD appears to have\n\nformed in 2015, and the name of the group\n\nis presumably intended as a tribute to Imad\n\nMughniyeh, a former Hezbollah commander who\n\nwas killed in 2008. Similarly, in September SOBH\n\nCyber Jihad claimed in an online communiqué\n\nto have compromised networks belonging to\n\nthe U.S. Department of Energy under the banner\n\nOpWinterIsComing. The group asserted that it\n\nutilized a custom-developed Java-based tool\n\nto carry out the attack, however no available\n\nevidence has corroborated these claims.\n\nLastly, in December 2015 the hacktivist group\n\nParastoo issued an announcement via the activist\n\norganization Cryptome after recent open source\n\nreporting revealed that a cyber attack linked\n\nto Iranian actors targeted a New York dam\n\nfacility in 2013. Parastoo’s claim indicated that\n\nits affiliate, SOBH Cyber Jihad, was responsible\n\nfor the attack but that a warning “by state-level\n\npower players” prevented the group from\n\n\n###### “HACKTIVISM SUCH AS THAT\n\n WHICH FOLLOWED THE\n\n CHARLIE HEBDO EVENTS\n\n IN PARIS, OR IN WAKE OF\n\n THE INCREASING PRESENCE\n\n OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM\n\n MANIFESTED BY DA’ESH (ISIS)\n\n AND PRO-ISIS GROUPS, MAY TAKE ON AN AGGRESSIVE HACKTIVIST VERSUS HACKTIVIST DYNAMIC.”\n\n\n###### THE RISE OF HACKTIVISM IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\neopolitical issues have increasingly served\n\nas drivers for hacktivist activity in the\n\nMiddle East/North Africa (MENA) region\n\n###### G\n\nthroughout 2015. CrowdStrike has specifically\n\nobserved a significant increase in attack ac\ntivity from both pro-ISIS and anti-ISIS actors.\n\nRegional conflicts such as those in Yemen and\n\nSyria, as well as more localized political issues\n\nsuch as the current governmental gridlock in\n\nLebanon, have also proven to be major catalysts\n\nfor politically motivated actors. Victim sets\n\nvary by campaign, however CrowdStrike has\n\nnoted an increased emphasis on government\n\nand financial sector organizations across the\n\nglobe. Additionally, sustained and disruptive\n\nhacktivist DDoS campaigns have been ob\nserved targeting organizations across multiple\n\nsectors in Saudi Arabia including government,\n\nfinancial, telecommunications, and energy.\n\n###### IRAN-RELATED GROUPS\n\n**PARASTOO, REMEMBER EMAD,**\n\n**AND SOBH CYBER JIHAD**\n\nhroughout 2015 CrowdStrike has observed\n\ncontinued activity from pro-Iranian\n\nhacktivist groups. Primary among these\n\n###### T\n\nare Parastoo, Remember EMAD, and SOBH\n\n\nIranian groups including Remember EMAD\n\nand Parastoo. Most significantly, YCA claimed\n\nresponsibility for a breach of Saudi Ministry of\n\nForeign Affairs (MOFA) networks in May 2015,\n\nand in July threatened further attacks against\n\nSaudi energy and financial sector organizations.\n\nYCA first emerged in April 2015 as a self-de\nscribed pro-Houthi and pro-Hezbollah hacktivist\n\ngroup. The impetus for the group’s formation was\n\nostensibly the Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation Council\n\n(GCC) coalition’s ongoing military action against\n\nthe Houthi rebels in Yemen. The first observed\n\nattack claimed by YCA in 2015 occurred on 13\n\nApril and targeted the London-based Al-Hayat\n\nnewspaper. The attack included a defacement\n\nof the newspaper’s website, which replaced the\n\npage’s original content with anti-Saudi rhetoric\n\nwarning readers to “accept Yemen Revolution\n\nand join us against your dictators”, adding “come\n\nwith all your Israeli and U.S. made Weapons!”\n\nDefacement imagery also showed apparent\n\nsupport for Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the\n\nLebanon-based Shiite militant group Hezbollah.\n\nIn addition to the defacement, the attackers\n\nleaked the names, email addresses, and hashed\n\npasswords of Al-Hayat’s users and subscribers.\n\nDespite being a London-based publication,\n\nAl-Hayat may have been seen as an attractive\n\ntarget due to the paper being owned by former\n\nSaudi deputy defense minister Khalid Bin Sultan.\n\nAl-Hayat also holds symbolic value as a target\n\nbecause it is widely characterized as a “pan-Arab”\n\npublication and is printed globally including\n\nin London, Beirut, Riyadh, and New York.\n\nThe second and most significant intrusion opera\ntion attributed to the YCA in 2015 was the group’s\n\nattack on the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\n(MOFA) on 20 May 2015. The adversary released\n\na statement via Pastebin and several other paste\n\nand file-sharing sites claiming that it had hacked\n\nall sub-domains and servers of mofa.gov.sa and\n\n\nCyber Jihad. The earliest activity attributed\n\nto Parastoo, the oldest of the three groups, is\n\na 2012 claim to have compromised computer\n\nsystems at the International Atomic Energy\n\nAgency (IAEA). Activity associated with Parastoo,\n\nRemember EMAD, and SOBH Cyber Jihad in\n\n\nmaking public announcement at that time.\n\n###### YEMEN CYBER ARMY\n\nn addition to the three aforementioned\n\ngroups, which openly operate as pro-Iranian\n\nhacktivists, CrowdStrike continues to track\n\n###### I\n\nactivity associated with the self-described Yemeni\n\nhacktivist group, Yemen Cyber Army (YCA). While\n\nYCA does not self-identify as an Iranian group,\n\nits attacks align with the interests of the Iranian\n\nstate. Additionally, public messaging by the group\n\nsuggests a potential association with suspected\n\n\n-----\n\nthat its operators were able to successfully breach\n\n3,000 computers and servers at the ministry.\n\nYCA’s statement, which was also posted to a vari\nety of additional paste sites to ensure redundancy,\n\nclaimed that the group was able to successfully\n\nbreach 3,000 computers and servers at the Saudi\n\nMOFA. A 1.5 Gb sample cache of documents,\n\nalong with a larger collection subsequently\n\nprovided to and published by Wikileaks, appears\n\nto substantiate YCA’s claims. Further statements\n\nand accompanying screenshots posted by the\n\ngroup claimed that the attack on the Saudi MOFA\n\ninvolved the use of wiper malware, however\n\nthis could not be independently verified.\n\n\ninclude: the hijacking of ISIS-affiliated Twitter\n\naccounts, doxxing of suspected ISIS members\n\non social media, defacement of jihadi websites\n\nand forums, and claimed intrusion and DDoS\n\nattacks against known ISIS web forums.\n\nIn addition to their disruption of extremist web\n\nforums and social media communications,\n\nanti-ISIS hacktivist activity has produced collateral\n\neffects on unrelated organizations. The most\n\nvisible example of this mistaken targeting is\n\nevidenced by the #OpISIS hacktivist campaign.\n\nLikely due in part to the ease with which hacktiv\nists can now leverage paid network stress testing\n\n(or stresser services) to conduct attacks, however,\n\ntarget vetting is often minimal and as a result,\n\nunrelated organizations throughout the Middle\n\nEast have become the victims of ensuing attacks.\n\nFor example, CrowdStrike observed repeated\n\ndisruptive DDoS attacks leveraged against a\n\nKuwaiti IT services provider throughout 2015. The\n\nfirm was mistakenly included in compiled target\n\nlists due to the presence of Arabic script on its\n\nwebsite. Because of the widespread proliferation\n\nof target lists among hacktivist actors and the\n\nlack of scrutiny given to ensuring that these lists\n\ninclude relevant targets, the firm—along with\n\nnumerous other innocent victims—has suffered\n\nattacks against its public web presence.\n\nConversely, CrowdStrike observed pro-ISIS\n\nhacktivist activity both from newly formed\n\n\ngroups supporting the so-called Islamic State\n\nas well as from known MENA-based actors\n\nformerly affiliated with the Anonymous collec\ntive. Most prominent among the newly formed\n\ngroups is the IS Hacking Division and the\n\ncurrently active Caliphate Cyber Army (CCA).\n\nThe IS Hacking Division group was active\n\nduring much of 2015 until the October arrest\n\nof its leader, Kosovoan national Ardit Ferizi,\n\nin Malaysia. The group’s activity comprised a\n\nseries of website defacement campaigns as well\n\nas an operation that entailed the compromise\n\nof a U.S. online retailer in order to obtain the\n\npersonally PII of its customers, which included U.S.\n\ngovernment employees and military personnel.\n\nThis information was provided by the IS Hacking\n\nDivision to ISIS propagandist and online recruiter,\n\nJunaid Hussain. The PII of U.S. military personnel\n\nwas reportedly used to support ISIS military\n\noperations, while additional U.S. government\n\nemployee PII was publicly disclosed by Hussain\n\nvia social media in August in a campaign\n\nintended to inspire lone-wolf attacks against\n\nU.S.-based targets. In late August, Hussain\n\nwas subsequently killed when a U.S. military\n\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) conducted\n\nan air strike in Syria against ISIS personnel.\n\nWhile pro-ISIS hacktivist groups represent the\n\nmost visible online threat associated with the\n\nterrorist organization, they are generally regarded\n\nas the least technically sophisticated and are most\n\noften inspired, but not directed, by ISIS itself.\n\nThese groups’ greatest value to ISIS as an organi\nzation lies in their ability to spread its propaganda.\n\nThis is achieved through website defacement\n\nand social media campaigns that propagate the\n\ngroup’s multimedia content and in turn serve\n\nas a recruitment tool. Although attacks carried\n\nout by pro-ISIS hacktivist groups are generally\n\nunsophisticated, they are nonetheless dam\naging to the reputation of victim organizations.\n\n\n###### “WHILE PRO-ISIS \n\n HACKTIVIST GROUPS\n\n REPRESENT THE MOST\n\n VISIBLE ONLINE THREAT\n\n ASSOCIATED WITH THE\n\n TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, THEY ARE GENERALLY REGARDED AS THE LEAST TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED AND ARE MOST OFTEN INSPIRED, BUT NOT DIRECTED, BY ISIS ITSELF.”\n\n\n###### PRO-/ANTI-ISIS ACTIVITY\n\nSIS has proven to be one of the most signifi\ncant drivers of hacktivist activity throughout\n\n2015. CrowdStrike observed sustained\n\n###### I\n\ncampaigns leveraging website defacement,\n\nDDoS, “doxxing”, and social media account\n\nhijacking TTPs carried out both by supporters\n\nand opponents of the terrorist organization.\n\nHacktivist operations opposing ISIS most often\n\nfollow kinetic events associated with the so-called\n\nIslamic State, such as the group’s release of exe\ncution videos or announced capture of territory. In\n\nJanuary 2015 a pro-ISIS campaign using the ban\nner #OpFrance was initiated following the attack\n\nagainst the satirical media outlet Charlie Hebdo in\n\nParis. Similarly, pro-ISIS online campaigns are fre\nquently conducted in retaliation to coalition mil\nitary action against the group or on the anniver\nsaries of significant dates, such as September 11.\n\nAnti-ISIS hacktivist campaigns during 2015\n\nwere most commonly led by actors and groups\n\nassociated with the Anonymous collective. Such\n\ncampaigns include #OpISIS and #OpParis, which\n\nwas launched in retaliation to the November\n\n2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. Observed tactics\n\n\n-----\n\nRegional disputes such as the war in Yemen and\n\nmulti-nation action against Da’esh continue to be\n\nflash points for Hacktivist activity in the region.\n\nThis activity emanates from actors in this region,\n\nand also targets those actors as a tete-a-tete\n\nconflict rages between opposing hacktivist groups\n\nacross the world. These incidents range from\n\ncompletely fabricated to devastating, and they\n\nonly continue to become more frequent as capa\nbilities of various actors are developed and tested.\n\n###### INTRUSION CAPABILITIES OF ISIS\n\nt is generally believed the Islamic State cur\nrently possesses internal capabilities including\n\nthe use of keyloggers and unidentified network\n\n###### I\n\nsurveillance software for investigations to identify,\n\n\nsupport to ISIS members and supporters.\n\n###### GEKKO JACKAL DEMONSTRATES RESILIENCE AND A CRIMINAL MOTIVATION IN 2015\n\n015 was a notable year for the adversary\n\nknown as LizardSquad, tracked by Crowd\nStrike Intelligence as GEKKO JACKAL.\n\n###### 2\n\nAfter gaining notoriety for a series of successful\n\nDDoS attacks against the gaming industry\n\nover the Christmas 2014 holiday, the largely\n\nunsophisticated hacker group surprised many by\n\nremaining resilient in the wake of law enforce\nment crackdowns and continuing DDoS attacks\n\nagainst a variety of sectors throughout 2015.\n\nMoreover, the group’s efforts in leveraging its\n\nnotoriety to break through into the criminal\n\nsector with their own black market service\n\nofferings was notable and is a trend that may\n\nbe continued by copycat groups.

GEKKO JACKAL posted an email exchange\n\nbetween Lenovo employees discussing Superfish,\n\nthe software that was at the center of a public\n\nuproar after researchers said they found it allowed\n\nhackers to impersonate banking websites and\n\nsteal users’ credit card information. By continuing\n\nattacks against the gaming sector and piggy\nbacking on the media attention surrounding\n\nthe Lenovo scandal, GEKKO JACKAL quickly\n\nmade it back into the headlines as a prominent\n\nhacker group and garnered further publicity.\n\nGEKKO JACKAL renewed DDoS attacks against\n\nthe gaming sector in mid-June 2015. Although\n\nthe group did not claim responsibility via its\n\nofficial social media channels, several associated\n\nactors appeared to claim responsibility, and the\n\nattacks were launched by infrastructure previously\n\nattributed to GEKKO JACKAL. The infrastructure\n\nresponsible for launching the attacks is called\n\nbashlite (also known as gayfgt), which is based on\n\nthe lightaidra malware, an open-source IRC-based\n\nmass router scanner/exploiter. GEKKO JACKAL\n\nhas previously made use of this infrastructure\n\nwhen carrying out DDoS attacks, likely using\n\nsecond-stage infrastructure to give commands to\n\nthe control server.\n\n\n###### FEBRUARY: 01 Sony PlayStation Network 07 U.S. Army Domain 14-17 Electronic Arts Network 16 Sony PlayStation + Steam Network 22 \u0007Saudi Arabian Financial Institutions 27 U.S. Army Domain 28 Sony PlayStation Domain 28 Electronic Arts Network\n\n\nover the Christmas 2015 holiday could be\n\nindicative that this resilient group will continue\n\nto be an adversary to watch out for in 2016.\n\nAfter a handful of arrests and weeks of inactivity\n\nfollowing the DDoS activity against the gaming\n\nsector in late December 2014, GEKKO JACKAL\n\nre-emerged in early 2015 continuing DDoS\n\nattacks against popular gaming platforms such\n\nas Microsoft’s Xbox Live and Daybreak Games,\n\nformerly known as Sony Online Entertainment.\n\nWhile it was largely believed that GEKKO JACKAL\n\nwas conducting this activity for little reason other\n\nthan to upset the gaming industry and increase\n\ntheir “hacker status”, CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nassessed there was another motivation behind\n\nGEKKO JACKAL’s efforts: a self-promotional effort\n\nfor their newly released LizardStresser DDoS tool\n\nand their opening in the black market with their\n\nnewly launched Shenron website. The website,\n\nbuilt atop the foundation of the LizardStresser,\n\nsold itself as a Silk Road-like black market, of\nfering services for spamming and DDoS-for-hire,\n\nas well as the purchase and delivery of drugs.\n\nShortly following this DDoS activity, GEKKO\n\nJACKAL targeted google.com.vn and\n\nlenovo.com in DNS hijacking activity. Media\n\nreports indicate that the hijackings were\n\npossible because the attackers seized control\n\nover Webnic.cc, the Malaysian registrar that\n\nserves both domains and 600,000 others.\n\n\nlocate, and arrest dissidents and suspected spies.\n\nAdditionally, open source reporting throughout\n\n2014 and 2015 has attributed at least three\n\noffensive cyber operations to ISIS, one of which\n\nincludes the use of primitive malware suspected\n\nto be leveraged in locating dissident operatives\n\nin Syria. The remaining two reported operations\n\ninvolved the alleged compromise of UK and Iraqi\n\ngovernment systems, however these reports\n\ncould not be independently confirmed.\n\nDespite the relative lack of intrusion cases\n\nattributable to ISIS operatives, the organization’s\n\npublished online content indicates that it likely\n\npossesses an adequate level of technical ability\n\n###### Timeline:\n SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS) ATTACKS FROM 2015\n\n\n###### MARCH: 01 Turkish Government and Businesses 02 Russian Security Services (FSB) 07-16 \u0007The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Domain 11 \u0007Wisconsin, Michigan, Oklahoma, and Missouri Domain 17 \u0007Global Jihad Network Domain 27 Github’s Domain\n\n\n###### APRIL: 12 U.S. Department of Energy Domain 27 \u0007Domain of Federal, State, and Local Government Agencies, Financial  Institutions, the Baltimore/Washington International Airport and Local Businesses in and around Baltimore 29 British Security Service, MI5 Domain\n\n\n-----\n\nBy early 2015, GEKKO JACKAL had developed and\n\ndeployed a new version of the bashlite malware\n\nfamily targeting Unix machines. This version took\n\nadvantage of the Shellshock vulnerability, which\n\nwas discovered in Fall 2014 and exploited the\n\nbash command shell in Linux systems, affecting\n\na wide array of users. GEKKO JACKAL has previ\nously tested out its new infrastructure and tools\n\nbefore mounting the larger attacks it takes public\n\ncredit for, suggesting that the mid-June 2015\n\nattacks were serving as the initial testing phase.\n\nAfter June 2015, GEKKO JACKAL infrastructure\n\nwas observed in what appeared to be random\n\nattacks against sectors outside of the gaming\n\nindustry, lending further evidence that the group\n\nwas beginning to leverage its resources for DDoS\nfor-hire services. On 10 July 2015, CrowdStrike\n\nobserved a DDoS attack targeting the aviation\n\nsector in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that\n\noriginated from the bashlite botnet infrastructure.\n\nThen on 13 August 2015, CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nobserved multiple DDoS attacks targeting two\n\ntechnology sector organizations originating from\n\nthe same infrastructure. While it remains unclear\n\nif these attacks were carried out personally\n\nby group members or as part of contracted\n\nservices, the latter seems more likely as there\n\nwas no claim of responsibility for these attacks.\n\nThroughout the end of August and through\n\nSeptember, CrowdStrike observed what appeared\n\n\nIt is possible that the September activity rep\nresented testing rather than actual operations.\n\nAlternatively, it may be further evidence of\n\ndivision within the group, particularly regarding\n\nthe sanctioning of “official” attacks carried\n\nout in the group’s name. During this time,\n\ngiven the code leak for the bashlite botnet in\n\nJanuary 2015, there was an observed increase\n\nin proliferation of the now-leaked code base\n\namong hacktivist groups that resulted in a\n\nnumber of new infrastructure sets not directly\n\nattributed to known GEKKO JACKAL actors.\n\nFinally, in late September, CrowdStrike observed\n\na control server associated with the GEKKO\n\nJACKAL implant issuing self-destructive com\nmands intended to terminate the implant and\n\nremove traces of the file. Analysis indicates that\n\ndue to the nature of the issued commands, the\n\nactivity was likely not carried out for maintenance\n\npurposes, but rather to ensure destruction of\n\nthe infrastructure and prevent re-propagation.\n\nThe source and specific motivation behind\n\nthe destructive termination of this botnet\n\ninfrastructure is not currently known, however\n\nseveral possibilities exist. CrowdStrike Intelli\ngence observed a significant amount of internal\n\ndispute amongst GEKKO JACKAL members,\n\nspecifically regarding which individuals are\n\ngranted access and control privileges to launch\n\nattacks from the group’s infrastructure. As such,\n\n\nto be a continuing deterioration of the group.\n\nThis activity included further target scope\n\ndeviation, clientele arrests, termination of their\n\nbotnet infrastructure, and uncharacteristic\n\nsilence. For example, in late August a DDoS\n\nattack launched against the public website of a\n\nprominent financial institution used the bashlite\n\ninfrastructure. This attack appeared to draw\n\nsignificant criticism from members worried that\n\nprovoking the financial sector had crossed a line\n\nand would lead to increased criminal investigation.\n\nAlthough the motivation for the attack against\n\nthe financial sector is unknown, it appears to\n\nhave been at the behest of a client, indicating\n\nthat many of GEKKO JACKAL’s members are\n\nlikely financially motivated and pushed the use\n\nof the botnet infrastructure for contract DDoS\n\nattacks to bring in additional revenue. However,\n\nthe group appears to have little control over\n\nthe botnet’s ultimate usage, suggesting clients\n\nare given direct access to the infrastructure.\n\nShortly following the attack on the financial insti\ntution, the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) an\nnounced the arrest of six teenagers involved in the\n\nuse of GEKKO JACKAL’s DDoS LizardStresser ser\nvice. Although there is no indication these arrests\n\nare directly related to the DDoS attacks against\n\nthe financial institution, the timing is notable,\n\nespecially after members of the group expressed\n\nspecific concern over attracting law enforcement.\n\n\nShortly after the announcement of the arrests and\n\na warning to other users of the service, GEKKO\n\nJACKAL, in true form, threatened retaliation.\n\nOn September 2 there were confirmed reports\n\nthat the NCA’s website was unreachable due to\n\na DDoS attack. While this comes as no surprise,\n\nit is notable that clientele of GEKKO JACKAL’s\n\nservices are being actively sought by law enforce\nment. The NCA further acknowledged in early\n\nSeptember that they were visiting approximately\n\n50 addresses belonging to users registered\n\non the GEKKO JACKAL Shenron website.\n\nIt is also potentially significant to note that the\n\nadversary’s indication via Twitter in early Septem\nber that the group has been inactive appears to\n\ncontrast with recent CrowdStrike observations\n\nregarding DDoS attack activity carried out\n\nby suspected GEKKO JACKAL infrastructure.\n\nThroughout September, CrowdStrike observed\n\na number of DDoS attacks leveraging the\n\nlightaidra-based botnet infrastructure against tar\ngets across a wide scope of sectors. This included\n\na popular fast food chain, a South American out\nsourcing firm, an online grocery supplier, a popular\n\nsocial networking platform, and a pharmaceutical\n\nentity. Many of the observed attacks appear\n\nconsistent with hacktivist intentions; however,\n\nGEKKO JACKAL generally claims responsibility\n\nfor its attacks, and given the lack of responsibility\n\nclaims for the September attacks, it is unclear if\n\nthis activity is directly associated with the group.\n\n\n###### MAY: 03 British Security Service, MI5 Domain 14-15 Fort Knox Domain 20-23 \u0007Russian Federation’s RosKomNadzor 22 \u0007Several Bank Domains in India, Chile, and Brazil 25 \u0007Egyptian Ministry of  Communications and IT Domain\n\n\n###### JUNE: 13 The World Cup and FIFA Domain 17 \u0007Canadian Government, Legislative, Judicial and Intelligence Agencies (CSEC and CSIS) Mid Several Gaming Sector Networks 12 Ukrainian Media’s Domain 22-23 \u0007Government Communications Headquarters’ (GCHQ) Domains\n\n\n###### JULY: 12 Telegram Servers 13 UAE Airline Domain 17 EU Financial Institution Domain 27 Gazprombank, Gazprom Domain 28 Canadian Government Domains\n\n\n###### AUGUST: 13 Cloud-based Email Provider 17 Gaming Sectors Infrastructure 18 \u0007Saudi Arabian Telecom, Financial, and Government Sector Domains, and the Infrastructure of Upstream Providers 22 \u0007U.S. Airline and Financial  Organization Domains\n\n\n###### SEPTEMBER: 09 \u0007Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) Domain 10 \u0007Several Russian Financial Institutions’ Domains 18 \u0007Brazilian Banks and Federal Government Agency’s Domains 12 \u0007Saudi Government and Financial  Sector Domains Service\n\n\n###### OCTOBER: 04, 06, & 09  \u0007 The Romanian Ministry of Education and Scientific Research 09 \u0007The Turkish E-Government & the Ministry of National Education 15 \u0007The Ukrainian Secretariat of Cabinet of Ministers 18 & 19 \u0007The Saudi Arabian Ministry\n\n\n-----\n\n###### “WHILE A COMBINATION OF CONTINUED ARRESTS AND INTERNAL INFIGHTING TOWARD THE END OF 2015 CAUSED GEKKO JACKAL TO GO SILENT, NEW THREATS EMERGING OVER THE CHRISTMAS 2015 HOLIDAY COULD BE INDICATIVE THAT THIS RESILIENT GROUP WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ADVERSARY TO WATCH OUT FOR IN 2016.”\n\n\n###### DECEMBER: 03 Saudi Investment Bank’s Domain 08 U.S. National Research Labs 17, 22 & 28-29  \u0007 Turkish Financial, Commercial and Government Domains 20 \u0007U.S. National Research Labs, the Pentagon, a Connecticut Education Network (CEN) Affiliated Domain,\n\n\nit is possible that the recently observed termi\nnation commands were issued by a disgruntled\n\nassociate or individual otherwise in competition\n\nwith the botnet’s operators for propagation and\n\ncommercial sale of similar infrastructure. Such\n\ntensions may have been exacerbated by ongoing\n\ndisputes over revenue from contracted DDoS\n\nservices provided on a hacker-for-hire basis for\n\nother clients outside of the GEKKO JACKAL\n\ngroup, as revenue from such activities has not\n\nbeen equally shared among group members.\n\nThe observed destruction of this particular\n\nbashlite infrastructure could also be the result\n\nof a third-party takedown activity; however,\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence notes that the witnessed\n\ndestructive termination with potential for collat\neral damage more likely represents red-on-red\n\nconflict between underground actors. After\n\nthe base code leak in January, proliferation of\n\nthe source code for the bashlite implant during\n\nmid- to late summer 2015 has dramatically\n\nincreased the number of potential actors that\n\nmay be familiar with this infrastructure.\n\nThe weak authentication mechanism for the\n\nbotnet C2 further created vulnerabilities that may\n\nhave been exploited for destructive action by\n\nmore experienced competing operators. GEKKO\n\nJACKAL has continuously angered members\n\nin the underground community, primarily for\n\nthe group’s lack of sophistication and propen\nsity to attack the gaming community, making\n\na red-on-red attack a feasible explanation.\n\nSince the destruction of the bashlite infrastructure\n\nin late September, GEKKO JACKAL has been\n\nuncharacteristically quiet. Previous GEKKO\n\nJACKAL attacks were quickly claimed by the\n\ngroup via an associated social media platform,\n\noften followed with pompous hacktivist rhetoric.\n\nIf, in fact, GEKKO JACKAL is experiencing\n\ninternal strife, pressure from law enforcement,\n\nand possible hostility from the underground\n\n\ncommunity, maintaining Internet silence could be\n\nthe most plausible option for the group’s survival.\n\nThe long-term effect the infrastructure loss and\n\nlaw enforcement involvement will have on future\n\nGEKKO JACKAL activity is yet to be determined,\n\nbut it is expected that this group will exhibit\n\noperational changes in the months to come, or will\n\ndisband altogether. While GEKKO JACKAL briefly\n\nresurfaced to reiterate threats against the gaming\n\nindustry during the Christmas 2015 holiday, the\n\nexpected bravado and follow-on attacks that are\n\nhallmark tactics of the group were not observed.\n\nIt should also be noted that social media mes\nsaging from GEKKO JACKAL has indicated that\n\nthe group is actively involved in populating an\n\nalternative network of infected hosts for use\n\nin DDoS attacks. Over the summer, GEKKO\n\nJACKAL was leveraging another IRC-based\n\ninfrastructure in addition to their bashlite\n\nbotnets. This may, in part, allow the group to\n\nremain resilient in the face of the destruction\n\nof the bashlite infrastructure and start anew.\n\nThreats from groups like GEKKO JACKAL are sig\nnificant, as they can impact the reputation and op\nerational effectiveness of targeted organizations\n\nboth in the short and long term. Unlike traditional\n\nhacktivist groups who target organizations based\n\non ideology and political motives, GEKKO JACKAL\n\nappears to target organizations and services\n\nprimarily for media attention to promote their\n\ncybercriminal business. Given GEKKO JACKAL’s\n\nsuccess in carrying out attacks and attracting me\ndia attention throughout 2015 (in addition to the\n\nleaked bashlite code), it is likely copycat groups\n\nwill attempt to follow GEKKO JACKAL’s lead in\n\n2016 in order to garner their own fame, create\n\ntheir own criminal service offerings, or both.\n\n\n###### Timeline:\n CONT’D\n\n\n###### NOVEMBER: 13, 17, 28-29 Saudi Arabian Government, Private  Investment, & Financial Organizations’ Domains 14 Protonmail Mail Client 15 U.S. Postal Service Domain 17 \u0007Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) Domain\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Throughout the year, the\n 2 0 1 5\n CrowdStrike Intelligence team G L O B A L provides numerous intelligence summaries to customers with T H R E A T varying periodicity.

Let’s Encrypt did not launch\n\nas expected, and it only entered public beta in\n\nthe final weeks of 2015. Even with the late 2015\n\nlaunch, public reporting indicates that certificates\n\nfrom Let’s Encrypt were misused in an Angler\n\ncampaign within weeks of the public beta.\n\nCrowdStrike also advised that it was pos\nsible that adversaries would deploy more\n\nsophisticated encryption schemes in 2015.\n\nCrowdStrike did observe a number of adver\nsaries increasingly implementing Virtual Private\n\nNetworks (VPNs), novel encryption schemes,\n\nand Point-to-Point encryption solutions in\n\n2015. This dynamic by multiple actors was\n\nobserved across all adversary motivations.\n\n**Increased Targeting of Embedded Devices**\n\nCrowdStrike assessed that we would see in\ncreased targeting of embedded devices by various\n\nactors. This is well highlighted by the actions of\n\nGEKKO JACKAL, who deployed a massive botnet\n\nusing a weakness introduced by the Shellshock\n\nvulnerability on embedded routers, cameras,\n\nand other network-attached devices. Targeted\n\nintrusion actors were observed compromising\n\nCisco routers and switches in victim environments,\n\nand an unknown actor has been tracked com\npromising embedded devices across the globe.\n\n**China Will Continue Conducting Espionage**\n\nCrowdStrike did not need a crystal ball for this\n\none; we assessed that China would continue\n\nconducting espionage that supported objectives\n\nlaid out in the 12th Five-Year Plan, supported\n\ntheir agenda in the South China Sea, and worked\n\nagainst an increasingly defiant Taiwan. We further\n\nassessed that China would continue to conduct\n\nattacks in support of “soft power” initiatives,\n\n\nfrom which efforts such as the Shanghai Coop\neration Organization (SCO) and the Silk Road\n\nInitiative would benefit. All of these activities\n\nwere observed throughout the course of 2015,\n\nwith Chinese intrusion activity expanding in\n\nall directions to include increased targeting in\n\nsupport of anti-corruption measures implement\ned by the government under President XI.\n\n**Joint Plan of Action as a Catalyst**\n\nThe CrowdStrike Intelligence team’s 2014 predic\ntions around Iranian intrusion activity vis-a-vis the\n\nsuccess or failure of the JPOA were thankfully not\n\ntested. The prediction pertained to the likelihood\n\nthat Iran would conduct retaliatory cyber attacks\n\nif the JPOA was perceived by Iran as taking a\n\ndisadvantageous turn, or outright failing. Fortu\nnately, neither of those scenarios came to fruition,\n\neven though the JPOA negotiation process\n\ntook longer than expected and was arduous.\n\nFurthermore, increased escalation of activity\n\nin Yemen by Houthi fighters and the military\n\naction of other nations diverted much of Iran’s\n\nattention to that region. Further escalation\n\nin the Syrian civil war further distracted Ira\nnian actors whose attention appears to have\n\nbeen focused on Gulf Cooperation Council\n\n(GCC) members, specifically Saudi Arabia.\n\n**Cyber Spillover from Regional Conflict**\n\nUkraine, the South China Sea, Syria, and global\n\nenergy prices were all identified in the 2014\n\nreport as being potential flash points for cyber\n\nactivity. This was all very much the case in 2015.\n\nUkraine was a hotbed of activity by a variety\n\nof Russian Federation-based adversaries who\n\nconducted extensive intelligence-collection op\nerations and possibly even kinetic attacks using\n\ncyber means. The South China Sea continued\n\nto be an issue between various nations in that\n\nregion as China continued to develop airstrips\n\nand naval stations in the contested atolls.\n\n\nChinese intrusion activity against Vietnam, the\n\nPhilippines, and Taiwan occurred routinely as the\n\nChinese sought to collect critical intelligence on\n\npotential repercussions of their aggressive pos\nture. ISIS activity in Syria and abroad spawned\n\nnumerous groups on both sides of Da’esh, who\n\nsniped at each other with compromises, data\n\nleaks, and disruptive attacks. The impact of\n\neconomic sanctions and global energy prices\n\nsurely had an impact on Russian intrusion activ\nity, as it conducted operations against countries\n\nfrom the Commonwealth of Independent States\n\n(CIS), across Europe, and into the United States.\n\n**Point-of-Sale Attacks in the Wake of EMV**\n\nCrowdStrike assessed that the instances of point\nof-sale (PoS) malware would sharply decline as\n\nEMV became the predominant technology in the\n\nUnited States. In October 2015, many payment\n\nprocessors implemented a fraud liability shift for\n\nvendors not supporting EMV technology. This\n\ntechnology does make commodity PoS malware\n\nas it existed ineffective—an unforeseen occur\nrence, despite increased usage of PoS malware at\n\nthe end of 2015. As criminals realized that the PoS\n\ntools they had developed would be rendered use\nless, they rapidly deployed their malware in a last\nditch effort to collect as much data as possible.\n\n**Destructive and Disruptive Attacks**\n\nCrowdStrike, as expected, observed an increase\n\nin disruptive and destructive attacks. The\n\nlion’s share of these attacks was conducted by\n\nhacktivist actors conducting DDoS attacks for\n\na variety of motivations. Attacks by extortionist\n\nactors such as PIZZO SPIDER, MIMIC SPIDER, and\n\nother copycat groups became an almost-daily\n\noccurrence, moving from Bitcoin businesses to\n\nlarge-scale financial and technology companies.\n\nRansomware also increased substantially in\n\ndistribution and variety over the course of 2015,\n\na constant threat with the potential to devastate\n\nanyone from an individual, small/medium business\n\nup through massive enterprises. Destructive\n\n\nattacks by nation-state actors continued through\n\n2015, with activity by VOODOO BEAR domi\nnating the headlines toward the end of 2015.\n\n###### R&D\n\nA key component of understanding the\n\nthreat landscape and where it is going is to\n\nobserve the direction of security research.\n\nTomorrow’s exploitable vulnerability or security\n\nbypass is likely being explored by research\ners today. Time and time again the security\n\ncommunity’s research has been picked up by\n\nsavvy attackers and forged into a weapon\n\nused by adversaries to achieve their goals.\n\nIn 2015, issues with encryption dominated\n\nthe headlines of attacks, as well as being\n\nrelentlessly tested by security researchers\n\nseeking to find flaws in these systems that\n\nprotect our personal data and business secrets.\n\nSecure boot processes are a key component\n\nof trusted computing; if the boot process has\n\nbeen compromised, then it’s game over.\n\nOver the years, an arms race has been raging\n\nbetween system designers and researchers\n\ndriving down to the silicon chips that support\n\nthe boot process, exposing previously unknown\n\nflaws in software that we rely on every day.\n\nThis leads to enhanced protections, and in\n\nsome cases, wily attackers can use the flaws\n\nto compromise systems at a very low level.\n\nVirtual Machine computing is another area of\n\nintense research. In the last year, it became\n\napparent here, too, that low-level drivers and\n\ncode to support antiquated devices could\n\ndiminish the security of the overall system.\n\nWith these research stories slowly percolating\n\ninto the mainstream media, it is important\n\nto keep an eye on novel research that may\n\nlead to critical exposures in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\n- \u0007In March of 2015, the Chinese root CA CNNIC\n\nwas removed from some major browsers\n\nafter a security incident was revealed by the\n\nGoogle Chrome team. CNNIC had issued a\n\nfull root CA certificate to a third party that\n\nhad used it for testing in network equipment\n\ndesigned to do transparent TLS interception.\n\n- \u0007March 2015 also saw the first large-scale attack\n\nof the so-called Great Cannon of China. In this\n\nincident, unsuspecting international visitors\n\nof the Baidu search engine had malicious\n\nJavaScript injected into their connection. As\n\nCrowdStrike pointed out at BlackHat USA\n\n2015, this attack would have been impossible\n\nwith HTTPS in place, a lesson that many large\n\nChinese companies have not yet taken to heart.\n\n- \u0007In December, the government of Kazakhstan\n\nannounced that it would require Internet users\n\nto install a custom root CA certificate, thereby\n\nmaking it possible for the government to inter\ncept all of the HTTPS connections of its citizens.\n\nOne alarming trend is for security software, such\n\nas anti-virus programs, to do TLS interception\n\nand inspection by installing their own certificate\n\ninto the browser root CA store. While these\n\ntools generate a certificate for each installation,\n\nthey sometimes introduce other weaknesses.\n\nDuring a survey, it was discovered that commonly\n\nused AV software such as Avast, Kaspersky,\n\nand ESET would degrade the security of TLS\n\nby being susceptible to the FREAK and CRIME\n\nattacks. This is facilitated by not implementing\n\nHTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) or Online\n\nCertificate Status Protocol (OCSP), stapling,\n\nand in general supporting older, less-secure\n\nciphers. Due to the difficulty of implementing\n\nTLS correctly, it is perhaps not surprising that\n\nrunning additional software to do TLS intercep\ntion increases the attack surface of a system.\n\n\n**x86 System and Firmware Security**\n\nAfter seeing adversaries deploy Basic Input\n\nOutput System (BIOS) implants for some time, the\n\ntopic of system and firmware security seems to\n\nhave finally arrived in mainstream security discus\nsions. The Hacking Team leak revealed them to be\n\ndeveloping a BIOS persistence implant deployed\n\nvia physical access; other government-backed\n\nactors such as ENERGETIC BEAR have also been\n\nobserved by CrowdStrike Intelligence to scout\n\nBIOS dumps after remote system compromise,\n\npotentially enabling BIOS implantation. Besides\n\ndeploying BIOS implants after remote compro\nmise, ensuring the integrity of a system after\n\nphysical access due to border inspections or\n\nsupply chain interdiction is a growing concern for\n\nmany medium- and high-ranking business officials.\n\n###### “ TOMORROW’S  EXPLOITABLE VULNERABILITY  OR SECURITY BYPASS\n IS LIKELY BEING  EXPLORED BY  RESEARCHERS  TODAY.\n\n ”\n\nModern flash chips that store BIOS images,\n\ncolloquially known as Read Only Memory (ROMs),\n\nshould be write-protected after system boot\n\nto protect against simple firmware reflashing\n\nattacks, which can occur after privileges have\n\nbeen escalated in the running operating system.\n\nEven with such protection, vulnerabilities in\n\nthe boot process (or sometimes after the boot\n\n\nprocess) can be exploited to circumvent this\n\nsimple write-protection. Pedro Vilaça uncovered\n\na vulnerability in how Apple OS X manages\n\nflash chip write-protection: Upon resume after\n\nsuspend-to-RAM, the boot code failed to ensure\n\nwrite-protection, effectively leaving the flash chip\n\nunprotected following the first suspend-resume\n\niteration. Since a suspend can generally also\n\nbe triggered by malicious software running\n\non the system, this effectively enables BIOS\n\nimplant deployment after remote compromise.\n\nPolish security researcher Joanna Rutkowska\n\ncovered the state of establishing a trust\nworthy boot chain on the x86 architecture\n\nin a much broader analysis in her excellent\n\npaper “Intel x86 considered harmful”. While\n\nher analysis paints a rather grim picture of the\n\ncurrent state of affairs, it is an accurate picture\n\nof analysis from a paranoid perspective.\n\nThe Purism company attempted to create a\n\n“fully liberated” laptop that did not depend on\n\nany binary or closed-source firmware for any\n\nof its components. However, to date they have\n\nnot managed to “liberate” the different firmware\n\npackages required for running modern Intel\n\nprocessors (see also Rutkowska’s analysis of Intel\n\nME and associated binary blobs). Google Chrome\nbooks rely on the open-source Coreboot firmware\n\nfor initializing the system and can be seen as fully\n\nopen-source boot chain implementation. Yet even\n\nthey have to rely on binary blobs supplied by Intel\n\nto support chipset and processor initialization\n\nand memory training. Multiple researchers are\n\nactively working on reverse engineering Intel\n\nME firmware binary blobs, and CrowdStrike\n\nexpects more publications on this in 2016.\n\nIt appears impossible to create a fully\n\nuser-controlled boot chain on x86 going\n\nforward, and it is expected that there will be\n\nfurther research into the closed binary blobs\n\nand uncovering of associated vulnerabilities.\n\n\nA new extension to the Intel processors called\n\nSoftware Guard Extensions (SGX) has been\n\ngaining attention by security researchers. SGX\n\nwas designed to bootstrap a trusted enclave in\n\nan untrusted ecosystem (such as cloud com\nputing), but it may also be abused for Digital\n\nRights Management (DRM) or rootkit purposes\n\naccording to multiple researchers’ assessments.\n\nAs the first processors implementing SGX\n\nbecome available in 2016, CrowdStrike expects\n\noffensive and defensive research leveraging\n\nthis technology to follow suit promptly.\n\n**State of the TLS Ecosystem**\n\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) is the centerpiece\n\nof modern connected systems providing a secure\n\ncommunication protocol. As such, it was not\n\nsurprising that 2015 saw a wealth of attacks on\n\nthe TLS protocol. During the same time, standards\n\nbodies were actively improving the protocol and\n\nphasing out old and insecure aspects of it in\n\norder to help mitigate possible attack surface.\n\n**ATTACKS AND INCIDENTS**\n\nThroughout 2015 numerous notable events took\n\nplace that demonstrated potential misuse of\n\nTLS and possible implications of such misuse.\n\n- \u0007In February 2015, it was revealed that com\nputer maker Lenovo had been pre-installing\n\nthe Superfish Visual Search software on its\n\ncomputers running Windows. This software\n\ninstalled a static TLS root certificate authority\n\n(CA) and corresponding private key into the\n\nsystem, thereby placing every user at risk of\n\nbeing attacked via a Man-In-The-Middle attack\n\non the TLS protocol. Lenovo published an\n\napology to its users and released a removal tool\n\nas open-source software. Later in 2015, it was\n\ndiscovered that Dell had also been pre-installing\n\na root CA and key on its Windows machines,\n\nresulting in the same security risks for users.\n\n\n-----\n\n**New Developments**\n\nOn 3 December, the first free and automated\n\nTLS Root Certificate Authority launched to the\n\ngeneral public. Called Let’s Encrypt, it offers\n\nfree certificates for manual and automated\n\nconsumption. Contrary to existing CAs, it\n\ndoes not require any manual interaction to\n\nget or refresh a TLS certificate for a website,\n\nwhich is why certificates issued by Let’s\n\nEncrypt will only be valid for three months.\n\nThe HTTP/2 specification was finalized by\n\nthe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in\n\nMay 2015 (RFC 7540). It is a major overhaul of\n\nthe venerable HTTP protocol that will greatly\n\nincrease the performance of resource-heavy\n\ninteractive websites and speed up browsing\n\nfor mobile users. While the IETF working group\n\nrefrained from making TLS/HTTPS (and thus\n\nencryption) mandatory for HTTP/2, a number\n\nof browser vendors have already announced\n\nthat they will only support HTTP/2 with HTTPS.\n\nSupport for HTTP/2 already exists in major\n\nbrowsers and web servers, but it remains to be\n\nseen whether the added functionality will result\n\nin new vulnerabilities. HTTP/2 will require less\n\nperformance trickery by application developers,\n\nand it makes dedicated external Content Delivery\n\nNetworks (CDNs) for JavaScript less attractive.\n\nIn April 2015, the Public Key Pinning Extension\n\nfor HTTP (HPKP, RFC 7469) was published by\n\nthe IETF. This is an HTTP header which tells\n\nbrowser to “pin” a public key certificate for the\n\ncurrent website, only accepting this particular\n\ncertificate for a specific time range. Used\n\ncorrectly, this extension will make intermittent\n\nTLS Man-In-The-Middle practically impossible.\n\nIn January, the Certificate Transparency project\n\nby Google started to be made mandatory for\n\nExtended Validation (EV) certificates in the\n\nChrome browser. This project, which is basically\n\na verifiable log of issued certificates, will make it\n\n\nimpossible for a CA to issue a certificate without\n\nthe rightful domain owner becoming aware of it.\n\nOther software on the web landscape is also\n\ncreating a noticeable incentive for the adoption\n\nof TLS/HTTPS. The HTML5 ServiceWorker spec\n\nwill enable fast, near-native online and offline\n\napplications, but it will only work on HTTPS\n\nwebsites. The Chrome browser will now display\n\nmixed-content warnings (HTTP and HTTPS\n\ncontent) like plain unencrypted websites. W3C\n\ninitiatives like Subresource Integrity (SRI) and\n\nthe Content Security Policy 2.0 (CSP), both\n\nactively developed during 2015, greatly increase\n\nthe security and robustness of web applications.\n\nFurthermore, these measures can mitigate some\n\nof the inherent risk emanating from insecure\n\nwebsites. In 2015, multiple (free) services ap\npeared that aid users in checking for insecure\n\nweb-server and header settings and offer\n\nready-made configuration snippets to achieve\n\nA-grade TLS security without much effort.\n\n**Changes to the Protocol**\n\nThe IETF is currently in the process of developing\n\nversion 1.3 of the TLS protocol. While TLS v1.3\n\nis still in draft state, a number of promising\n\nimprovements have already emerged. TLS v1.3\n\nwill no longer support any type of handshake that\n\ndoes not offer perfect forward secrecy (PFS).\n\nA number of cryptographically weak ciphers\n\nand options will be removed in v1.3. In terms\n\nof performance, TLS v1.3 will also enable faster\n\nhandshakes that use fewer round trips between\n\nclient and server. This will greatly increase\n\nperformance, thus further driving TLS adoption.\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nWhile an automated and free CA will hopefully\n\ndrive the adoption of TLS, it can also be used for\n\nmalicious purposes. The end of 2015 already saw\n\nLet’s Encrypt being employed for malicious ads.\n\nOur prediction for 2016 is that we will encounter\n\nmore incidents where actors leverage the ease\n\n\nand anonymity of creating TLS certificates to\n\nenable attacks and hide their tracks. With a\n\nvalid TLS certificate, malicious content can be\n\nreferenced across domains without triggering\n\nmixed content warnings. If an attacker can host\n\ncontent on a subdomain of a legitimate business,\n\nhe will be able to create a TLS certificate for\n\nthat domain that will look authentic to a user.\n\nTraffic protected by TLS can bypass systems\n\nlike an IDS more easily, as it is encrypted. As\n\nthe “green lock” of TLS-protected websites\n\nbecome more prevalent on the Internet, users\n\nwill have to be educated that it does not imply\n\ntrustworthiness of the site. In the face of these\n\nchallenges to network-based security solutions,\n\nnext-generation endpoint protection will become\n\neven more critical to enterprise security.\n\n###### CONTAINER AND VIRTUALIZATION SECURITY\n\nIn 2015, virtualization was still the go-to tech\nnology to achieve multi-tenancy for a number\n\nof applications. Dozens of companies have\n\nemerged that either offer such infrastructure\n\nas a service or provide solutions for monitoring\n\nand managing the ever-growing fleet of virtual\n\nmachines. It is not surprising that the demand\n\nfor secure deployment guidelines has surged.\n\n**Containers**\n\nAnother emerging trend in terms of multi-tenancy\n\nis the containerization of applications. Containers\n\nare not as heavyweight as VMs, and thus are\n\neasier to set up and significantly more re\nsource effective than VMs on shared hardware.\n\nFor many users, the only reason to employ VMs\n\nis the perceived lack of isolation that popular\n\ncontainer software offers at this time. Providing\n\na secure isolation layer will be paramount for\n\ndriving the future adoption of containers.\n\nDocker is a container solution built on recently\n\nadded features of the Linux kernel, and it is\n\narguably the most prominent and widely used\n\n\n###### “IN THE FACE OF THESE\n\n CHALLENGES TO NETWORK\n BASED SECURITY \n\n SOLUTIONS, NEXT- GENERATION ENDPOINT PROTECTION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE CRITICAL TO ENTERPRISE SECURITY.”\n\n\n-----\n\ncontainer software today. There has been some\n\nconfusion as to the purpose of Docker containers\n\nand the level of isolation these can offer. Since\n\napplications can easily escape Docker containers\n\nunder certain circumstances, even proponents\n\nof containers have gone so far as to point to\n\nVMs for isolation of possibly malicious code.\n\nFrom the attacks on the Docker ecosystem\n\nand the ensuing discussions in the community,\n\nit is apparent that users are frequently not\n\neducated about the implications of running\n\ncontainers with potentially malicious code.\n\nCurrently, the lack of support for user name\nspaces in Docker means that it is easy to\n\ninadvertently run an application inside a Docker\n\ncontainer as root. In 2015, Docker also added\n\nsignature verification for images, a feature that\n\nenterprise customers had been waiting for.\n\nThe Docker container ecosystem offers a way for\n\nusers to share the containers they created via\n\nthe so-called Docker Hub. This repository holds\n\na large number of pre-installed Docker container\n\nimages, both from official software vendors\n\nas well as regular users. Users can typically\n\nexpect to find an existing Docker image for the\n\nsoftware they want to run inside a container.\n\nIn May, there was an automated survey of\n\nthe official Docker images, i.e., those from\n\nthe actual software vendors. It found that\n\nabout 40 percent of the images suffered from\n\nsevere vulnerabilities that were discovered\n\nand fixed in the course of the previous year\n\n(e.g., Shellshock, POODLE, Heartbleed).\n\nDocker itself saw a number of Common Vulner\nability and Exposures (CVEs) assigned in 2015,\n\nmost of them relating to ways the container\n\ncould either disable or circumvent Linux security\n\nmodels and affect the host system. The Docker\n\nEngine is the actual software behind Docker\n\nthat is responsible for creating and managing\n\n\nof these operations both from a financial as\n\nwell as an economic perspective for Beijing,\n\nand in 2015 it came to a boiling point. The\n\nthreat of U.S. economic sanctions and potential\n\ndiplomatic fallout appears to have finally forced\n\nmeaningful dialogue between governments.\n\nIf observed campaigns in late 2015 were any\n\nindication, it is unlikely China will completely\n\ncease its cyber operations, and 2016 will show\n\nthe new direction it is headed. Although China\n\nand the U.S. signed a cyber agreement and\n\nrestarted cyber dialogue between the two nations\n\nfollowing President XI’s September 2015 visit to\n\nWashington, the wording was described by most\n\nanalysts as extremely vague and largely open to\n\ninterpretation. A short time later, China sought\n\nto sign identical agreements with the UK and\n\nGermany, and even sought to normalize a similar\n\nagreement at U.N. proceedings not long after.\n\nBeneath the surface, however, China has not\n\nappeared to change its intentions where cyber is\n\nconcerned. This is best illustrated by how Beijing\n\ntreats its allies as opposed to its rivals. Whereas\n\nthe agreements that China has been attempting to\n\nnormalize specify not hacking for economic espio\nnage purposes, China signed a May 2015 pact with\n\nRussia, a known ally, with both sides abolishing\n\nmalicious hacking of any type against one another.\n\nYet CrowdStrike actually observed an increase in\n\nactivity against Russian targets from HAMMER\n\nPANDA directly following the agreement. The Rus\nsian targeting continued over several months after\n\nthe friendly agreement had been signed, sug\ngesting that Chinese intentions are far removed\n\nfrom the agreements they sign, even with allies.\n\nChina was also observed targeting the website of\n\nthe Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague\n\nduring a week-long hearing on its SCS dispute\n\nwith the Philippines. The tribunal was intended\n\nto be a neutral ground to resolve international\n\ndisputes, but Beijing refused to acknowledge the\n\n\ncontainers on a host system. Because of the\n\npower that the Docker Engine wields with\n\nregard to the host system, tools instrumenting\n\nit will be a prime target for attackers.\n\n**Virtual Machines**\n\nThere have been a number of critical advisories\n\nrelated to virtualization technology such as Xen\n\nand KVM. For Xen, there were 10 advisories in\n\n2015 that described a way for the guest OS to\n\nescape its confinement, potentially compro\nmising the host system. Another 15 advisories\n\ndescribed various ways for guests to perform\n\na Denial of Service (DoS) of the host system.\n\nIn May, CrowdStrike discovered a vulnerability in\n\nXen that allowed x86 HVM guests to escape to\n\nthe host system through the QEMU floppy disk\n\ncontroller. The vulnerability was patched as part of\n\nXSA-133. Like other privilege-escalation vulnerabil\nities, this one affected more than one virtualization\n\nsolution since it originated in the QEMU emulator,\n\nwhich is used by multiple projects such as Xen,\n\nKVM, and VirtualBox. Other companies came for\nward with similar bugs, showing the vested inter\nest that a wide range of industries has in keeping\n\nthe security model of VMs robust and intact.\n\nBlackHat USA 2015 and DefCon featured talks\n\non cross-VM covert channel communication\n\nusing the CPU. These kinds of attacks are\n\ncertainly quite complex and may be hard to\n\nexecute, yet they show the multitude of potential\n\npitfalls for providers offering VMs to users.\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nCrowdStrike expects a number of new challenges\n\nto arise as a result of an increased adoption of\n\ncontainerization technology. The most obvious\n\none will be the fact that more developers and\n\nusers will use containers for external reasons. Ef\nficiency and the continuous march toward virtual\n\nappliances and cross-platform deployment will\n\ndrive increased adoption of these technologies.\n\n\nCurrently, the user base of containers can prob\nably be described as “educated early adopters”,\n\nwhile future generations of users might not be\n\nso savvy. As a result, there will likely be cases\n\nwhere insecure software inside of containers is\n\nnot updated because users lack the knowledge\n\nto do so or because they don’t understand the\n\nsecurity implications. Current operating systems\n\nfrequently offer automatic updates for software\n\ninstalled through system facilities, such as shared\n\nlibraries or servers. Containers, on the other hand,\n\nrequire a different approach to dealing with the\n\nupdate process. Even if the need to update is\n\nevident to the user, it remains to be seen whether\n\ncontainer and software deployment processes\n\ncan keep up with the pace of security issues.\n\n###### TARGETED INTRUSION: CHINA\n\n2016 looks to be a pivotal year for China-based,\n\nstate-sponsored cyber adversaries as China enters\n\na transformational period in terms of its economy,\n\nits global status, and the cyber methods it uses to\n\nachieve its strategic goals. This is most easily dis\ncussed by separating out Chinese intentions in cy\nberspace, the changing dynamics of Chinese cyber\n\noperators, and China’s new Five-Year Plan (FYP).\n\n**Chinese Intentions in Cyberspace**\n\nFor China, cyber operations have previously\n\nbeen a relatively inexpensive means to some\n\nof these strategic ends: It has conducted cyber\n\nreconnaissance on its neighbors to make cal\nculated territorial maneuvers; used extensive\n\ncyber monitoring capabilities to simultaneously\n\nsuppress dissidents and manage a growing\n\npopulation of domestic Internet users; and\n\nconducted cyber espionage in order to steal\n\nintellectual property, fill technological gaps,\n\nand maintain its impressive economic growth.\n\nEfforts by the private sector and the U.S. gov\nernment to expose Chinese cyber operations\n\nover the past several years has raised the cost\n\n\n-----\n\ncase as valid, instead infecting the website and\n\npotentially any victims interested in the landmark\n\ncase. This further shows Chinese intentions to\n\ncontinue to use cyber as a means to gain the\n\nupper hand in any international disputes, even\n\nwhen the victim is an impartial judge designed\n\nto equalize opponents and prevent bullying.\n\nObserved activity has shown that China may\n\nchange tactics and reduce its cyber activity\n\nwhen under close inspection. Examples of\n\nthese reductions are apparent in the drop-off of\n\nCOMMENT PANDA activity after the May 2014\n\nPLA indictments, or the cessation of PUTTER\n\nPANDA following the public release of Crowd\nStrike’s analysis of their activity in June 2014.\n\nChina has demonstrated that their operators\n\nwill resume normal activities when scrutiny has\n\ndiminished. The cyber agreements appear to be\n\nan attempt to appease the U.S., avoid economic\n\nsanctions, and offer a chance for China to seize\n\nupon a global initiative to “normalize” sanctioned\n\ncyber activity. China has promised new cyber tact,\n\nhowever the reality of its intentions is far divorced\n\nfrom what it has promised. Given its remaining\n\ntechnological gaps and the strategic edge cyber\n\ncan provide its economy, there is still plenty of\n\nincentive for China to engage in commercial\n\ncyber espionage when opportunities arise.\n\n**The Shifting Dynamics of China’s Cyber Operators**\n\nA reduction in activity by China-based adversaries\n\nin 2016 is possible; such a reduction would be\n\nindicative of a shift in the way China goes about\n\ncyber espionage. The cyber agreements come\n\nat a time when President XI has been preparing\n\na massive military overhaul that would see\n\na bloated PLA trimmed and more resources\n\ndistributed to the PLAAF and PLAN. President XI\n\nhas said that a joint-command structure similar\n\nto the U.S. military is necessary to provide China\n\nwith a modern, nimble fighting force capable of\n\ndefending China’s territory. This carries obvious\n\nimplications for enforcing China’s interests as well\n\n\nas defending them from a physical standpoint,\n\nand will likely make the SCS a continued flash\n\npoint as the reorganization will likely allow\n\nChinese military forces more mobility and\n\nfaster response times to potential conflict.\n\nThe reorganization may also split China’s military\n\ncyber forces into their own division and likely\n\nserves the dual purpose of revamping China’s\n\ncyber forces at a time when more oversight\n\nis needed while giving the impression of a\n\nreduction in U.S. targeting. CrowdStrike has\n\nfrequently observed duplicated collection efforts\n\nby multiple groups, indicating relatively little\n\noversight or coordination between units. At\n\npresent, preventing an outright violation of the\n\ncyber agreement with the U.S. is a high priority\n\nfor China, as economic sanctions would place a\n\nsevere strain on its already-troubled economy. The\n\npotential embarrassment of soldiers moonlighting\n\nas contractors and carrying out operations on\n\nbehalf of Chinese companies has likely prompted\n\na significant drop in normal activity by Chinese\n\nmilitary operators as they undergo a funda\nmental shift in how they carry out operations.\n\nThis reorganization will not happen overnight. It\n\nis slated for completion by 2020; however, cyber\n\nwill likely be a priority due to China’s emphasis\n\non winning informatized wars, meaning that the\n\nshift may be observed soonest in that arena.\n\nPotential signals that the reorganization has made\n\nChina’s cyber forces more efficient would include\n\nimproved tradecraft, better sharing of tools\n\nbetween groups, and coordination on targets.\n\nAs China’s military cyber forces undergo\n\nchanges, China will likely increase its reliance on\n\nits civilian intelligence agencies and associated\n\ncontractors, all of which generally employ better\n\ntradecraft. This includes the Ministry of Public\n\nSecurity (MPS), which has already seen some\n\nmonumental changes to its mission in 2015\n\nsuch as increased overseas operations, as well\n\n\nas the Ministry of State Security (MSS), which\n\nhas typically employed top-tier contractors.\n\nTo illustrate this point, DEEP PANDA, which\n\nCrowdStrike associates as being one of the\n\nnon-military cyber organizations China regularly\n\nuses, has engaged in activity across a wide variety\n\nof sectors since the cyber agreement with the\n\nU.S., and it is expected to continue to do so.\n\nOverall, Chinese cyber activity may shift dy\nnamics, but it is not expected to cease anytime\n\nsoon. Beijing views winning informatized wars\n\nas integral to its rejuvenation as a “great nation”,\n\nand despite the promotion of domestically\n\nsourced innovation and technologies, China\n\nstill has numerous intelligence gaps that cy\nber espionage can assist in filling to accomplish\n\nits long-term strategic goals. A cessation of\n\nintrusions associated with China is unlikely.\n\n**China’s 13th Five-Year Plan**\n\nNotably, China’s economy has reached a tipping\n\npoint as it looks to maintain medium/high growth\n\ntrajectory and to better satisfy its exponentially\n\ngrowing middle class with better access to\n\nquality food, affordable healthcare, and job\n\nopportunities. President XI and senior officials\n\nhave frequently alluded to economic reforms\n\nmultiple times in the past two years, highlighting\n\nthat the CCP recognizes a troubled economy\n\nconstitutes one of the largest threats to party rule.\n\nChina will look to transform its global status as an\n\nexporter of cheap goods (i.e., “Made in China”) to\n\nthat of a domestic powerhouse and innovator.\n\nChina also suffered two serious embarrassments\n\non a global scale: the Chinese stock market crash\nes in mid-2015 and its issuing a pollution red alert\n\nfor Beijing during the Paris climate talks. Both\n\nof these events showed significant weaknesses\n\nwhere China has been looking to brand itself as a\n\nglobal leader, and it is likely that China will seek\n\nto avoid any further incidents that reflect nega\ntively on China in the financial and energy sectors.\n\n\n###### “CHINA SIGNED A MAY 2015 PACT WITH RUSSIA, A\n\n KNOWN ALLY, WITH BOTH\n\n SIDES ABOLISHING MALICIOUS\n\n HACKING OF ANY TYPE\n\n AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.YET CROWDSTRIKE ACTUALLY OBSERVED AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITY AGAINST RUSSIAN TARGETS FROM HAMMER PANDA DIRECTLY FOLLOWING THE AGREEMENT.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThese factor heavily into the first draft of China’s\n\n13th Five-Year Plan, which was released in Novem\nber 2015 and will be finalized in early 2016. These\n\nplans typically provide a roadmap for what China\n\nwill target using cyber means. Alternative energy\n\nand domestic technological innovations will have\n\na renewed focus as China looks to transform its\n\nstandard of living and become less reliant on\n\nforeign technology. This will likely resonate with\n\nChinese citizens as increased opportunity, both\n\nin terms of everyday prospects and entrepre\nneurship, which the CCP is promoting heavily\n\nalong with private sector/military cooperation\n\nas a way to stimulate growth and innovation.\n\nThe combination of China becoming increasingly\n\nuntrusting of western information technology\n\nand a desire to promote its own sectors of\n\nindustrial manufacturing and retail may lead\n\nto a gradual tapering off of targeting against\n\nthese sectors. However, it will also likely\n\nmean increased cyber targeting in areas like\n\nagriculture, healthcare, and alternative energy\n\nthat China deems crucial to promoting the\n\nwellbeing of its growing middle class, and\n\nwhere it has the most technological gaps.\n\n2016 may see Chinese cyber operators targeting\n\nthese sectors not just for intellectual property,\n\nbut also for know-how such as building native\n\nsupply chains and administrative expertise. The\n\ntargeting of U.S. healthcare institutions in 2015\n\nwas suspected to be for espionage purposes,\n\nthough it may have had the dual purpose\n\nof providing western models for supplying\n\naffordable healthcare to citizens as China looks\n\nto modify its current healthcare system.\n\nIt is no coincidence that a plethora of key state\n\nprojects have completion goals of 2020. 2021 will\n\nmark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the\n\nCCP, and the party intends to have myriad suc\ncesses to present to the Chinese people in order\n\nto reinforce its political legitimacy. These projects\n\n\nand targets are wide ranging, with some very\n\nspecific goals (e.g., achieve a 60 percent urban\nization rate, complete the Chinese space station,\n\nreveal a domestically produced aircraft carrier,\n\ndouble 2010 levels of growth) and some extremely\n\nvague goals (e.g., become an “Internet Power” and\n\nbecome a “moderately well-off society”). However,\n\nthere are several stated goals that have strategic\n\nand economic implications for several sectors.\n\n**The included infographic gives a further break-**\n\n**down of potential targets across sectors based**\n\n**on China’s 13th FYP and its strategic projects**\n\n**that are slated for completion by 2020.**\n\n###### RUSSIA\n\nThe Russian National Security Strategy, released\n\non 31 December 2015, both establishes the plans\n\nthe leadership aims to implement throughout\n\n2016 and reflects the desire for the nation to\n\nrealign its interests, focus domestically, and\n\nimprove its influence and standing. A realignment\n\nof interests orients Russia eastward toward\n\nChina and India and places a greater focus on\n\nregional partnerships, such as the Collective\n\nSecurity Treaty Organization (CSTO), as it\n\ndistances itself from NATO. This shift portends\n\nfurther military joint training engagements and\n\nmay also be either complicated or reinforced by\n\nattempts at intelligence collection associated\n\nwith nations in Russia’s sphere of interest.\n\nThe domestic focus alluded to in the strategy\n\nis multifaceted, but in terms of technology the\n\nnation is poised to increase investments in the\n\ntechnology sector. Some of these investments\n\nwere announced or had already begun in 2015\n\nas reports of intent to develop mobile operating\n\nsystems and nationally developed hardware\n\nproliferated. Supplementing the growth in the\n\nnational technological sector will be the increasing\n\ninternalization of data resources and application\n\nof control over content. In 2015 Roskomnadzor,\n\n\nRussia’s communication, information technology,\n\nand mass media service, had enforced legislation\n\ngoverning how private data of Russian citizens’\n\ninformation is handled. The service cracked\n\ndown on foreign companies who operate in\n\nRussia and do not comply. Per legal guidance,\n\ncompanies that possess data belonging to\n\nRussian citizens must provide the government\n\naccess to the data or house their servers within\n\nRussian territory. In terms of content control,\n\nRussia has surreptitiously employed teams of\n\nonline bloggers, commentators, and “trolls” to\n\ndisseminate false information, drown out the\n\nvoices of legitimate users, and direct discussion in\n\na manner chosen by the government. Operating\n\nunder the broad moniker “Internet Research\n\nAgency,” these operators have employed their\n\ntechniques following high-profile events such\n\nas the assassination of political activist Boris\n\nNemtsov in late February, and they are expected\n\nto continue their operations throughout 2016.\n\nAdditionally expected in 2016 are domestic\n\ndeployments of systems that may allow ex\npanded government control of online resources.\n\nGosSOPKA is a government system reportedly\n\ndesigned to detect and eliminate computer\n\nattacks. First imagined in 2013, GosSOPKA is\n\nintended for development and management\n\nby the FSB. It potentially supplements existing\n\nforms of online overwatch such as SORM, but\n\nit also adds an aspect of real-time defense.\n\nGosSOPKA began its initial implementations\n\nin 2015 on Ministry of Economic Development\n\nnetwork resources. Wider plans for distribu\ntion in 2016 and beyond include government\n\nagencies as well as Russia’s diplomatic offices\n\nand consular bureaus located overseas.\n\nIn an effort to improve status and influence, Russia\n\nis still expected to project military power in the\n\nform of bomber training flights and joint military\n\nexercises, but these will likely be seen less fre\n\nquently than in 2015 due to economic challenges\n\nfaced domestically. Improvement of the economy\n\nwas a major talking point within the strategy and\n\na large portion of Russia’s focus on domestic\n\nissues. The improvements will most likely come in\n\nconcrete forms such as sales of natural resources,\n\nbut also in terms of changes to financial policy\n\nand development of partnerships for domestic in\nvestment. These shifts will most likely necessitate\n\ninformation for decision making, and therefore\n\nthey portend increased intelligence collection\n\nby Russia-based adversaries particularly against\n\nregional targets and global energy companies.\n\n###### IRAN\n\nDue to the intense concern of possible\n\nfuture degradation of Iran’s Islamic values\n\nas businesses (primarily western) renew\n\ntrade with Iran, it is highly likely the Iranian\n\ngovernment will react by increasing Internet\n\nmonitoring and censorship on a national scale\n\nas quickly and as effectively as possible.\n\nIt is likely, too, that Iran will also conduct in\ncreasing domestic cyber espionage operations\n\nto be vigilant of any influence of western ideals\n\non Iran, threatening its Islamic culture. Subse\nquently, it is also likely that arrests of Iranians\n\nfor content offensive to Islam or threatening\n\nto the Iranian government (both statements\n\nthat are broad in application to activities) will\n\nincrease as more technical apparatus is put in\n\nplace to monitor and censor network traffic.\n\nFurthermore, the Iranian government will almost\n\ncertainly be concerned about the contents\n\nof any reports from investigative regulatory\n\nbodies on Iran’s continued compliance with\n\nthe nuclear agreement. The relief of sanctions\n\nfrom the JCPOA is of vital importance to Iran\n\nand its economy.

Thus, reporting associations,\n\nreceiving parties, and third parties such as host\n\ngovernments for meetings should expect it is\n\nlikely they would be included in targeting by\n\nIranian cyber espionage operations for knowledge\n\ngathering. The threat is increased if Iran violates,\n\nor is accused of violating, the JCPOA and risks\n\nthe re-establishment of economic sanctions.\n\nLastly, as assessed once evaluating the U.S.\n\nGovernment report in June 2015, Iran separates\n\nits nuclear policy (and the JCPOA agreement\n\nwith the P5+1 countries) from its foreign policy\n\nin the Middle East. Through 2014, regardless of\n\nongoing nuclear negotiations, Iran continued to\n\nsupport Lebanese Hezbollah, a number of Iraqi\n\nShia militant groups, Hamas, Palestine Islamic\n\nJihad, and the regime of Syrian President Bashar\n\nal-Assad. Although the report was from 2014, U.S.\n\nofficials claim the activities continued into 2015.\n\nAdditionally, Iran is also strongly suspected of\n\nproviding various means of logistical and financial\n\nsupport for the Zaidi Shiite insurgent group\n\nknown as the Houthis throughout 2014 and 2015.\n\nThere are no indications that the Iranian gov\nernment will shift from its current foreign policy\n\nsupporting the aforementioned groups. Specifical\nly, there are increasing tensions between the two\n\nregional powers of Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi\n\nArabia (KSA) that increase the likelihood that Iran\n\nwould use its proven cyber capabilities in 2016,\n\ntargeting Saudi Arabia and regional governments\n\nthat are becoming involved in the two countries’\n\ndispute by choosing to align with Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne escalating tension is the Yemen conflict,\n\nin which Iran has supported the Houthi rebels\n\nagainst a Saudi-backed Yemeni government in\n\nexile. The Saudi-led coalition announced on 2\n\n\nbureaus, which have participated in illegal drugs,\n\ncounterfeiting, and other illicit activity. The cyber\n\nagreement between the U.S. and South Korea is\n\nonly likely to exacerbate the DPRK’s justification\n\nfor continuing to target the the two countries.\n\nCrowdStrike anticipates continued intelligence col\nlection activity and incremental improvements in\n\nthe technological capabilities of the DPRK in 2016.\n\n###### CRIMINAL\n\n**Targeted Criminal Intrusion**\n\nDuring 2015, cases of targeted intrusion were\n\nobserved by groups dubbed Carbanak, Butterfly\n\n(a.k.a. Wild Newtron), and FIN4. These groups\n\nhave all used customized malware to target large\n\norganizations for high-value financial gain. Crowd\nStrike assesses it is likely that targeted criminal ac\ntivity will continue to increase in the coming year.\n\nGroups operating globally but often originating\n\nout of Lagos, Nigeria used opportunistic targeting\n\nin 2015 to gain a foothold in organizations using\n\nreadily available remote access tools. These\n\ngroups used this foothold to collect intelligence\n\nabout lexicon, organizational charts, and business\n\nprocesses to conduct highly targeted social\n\nengineering. Similar groups focused research\n\non publicly available information to collect their\n\nintelligence. Such activity is likely to continue\n\ninto 2016, as the potential financial reward is high\n\nand the prosecution of such activity is difficult.\n\n**Commodity Malware**\n\nMarkets used to obtain banking Trojans and\n\nransomware will both increase and diversify with\n\nmore malware family authors attempting to gain\n\nincreased market share. Criminal actors often ob\ntain malware, exploits, and binders (packers) from\n\nunderground markets and forums; competition in\n\nthese forums has been observed and continues\n\nto increase. Authors are constantly looking to\n\ngrow their user base through novel features and\n\nincreased stealth from anti-virus technology;\n\n\nJanuary 2016 that the 15 December 2015 cease\nfire agreement, which had been violated multiple\n\ntimes by both sides, would end on that day at\n\n1100 GMT, meaning the conflict is far from over. A\n\nSaudi Arabian air strike on 8 January 2016 resulted\n\nin the near-bombing of Iran’s embassy in Sanaa,\n\nYemen. Erroneously, Iran media first reported that\n\nthe embassy had been hit during the air strike.\n\nOn the same day as the end of the Yemeni cease\nfire on 2 January 2016, Saudi Arabia executed\n\nShiite cleric Nimr Al-Nimr. Sheikh Al-Nimr had\n\nbeen charged with instigating unrest while he\n\nparticipated in protests against the Saudi gov\nernment during the Arab Spring in 2011. Al-Nimr\n\nwas convicted in October 2012, sentenced to\n\ndeath, and had been scheduled for execution with\n\n46 other prisoners at an undetermined date.\n\nFollowing the executions, Iranian protestors—\n\nmotivated by the execution of a prominent\n\nShiite cleric and seeing the action as an offense\n\nagainst Shiite Muslims by the Sunni-ruled Saudi\n\nArabia—attacked the Saudi Arabian embassy in\n\nTehran. Saudi Arabia was forced to remove its\n\ndiplomatic personnel from the embassy. Adding to\n\nthe tensions, the governments of Bahrain, Sudan,\n\nQatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates\n\n(UAE) also severed or downgraded diplomatic\n\nties in support of their alliance with Saudi Arabia.\n\nWith the regional tensions heading into 2016,\n\nthere is increased likelihood Iran would use its\n\ncyber capabilities—which are also expected to\n\nstrengthen and improve going forward—against\n\nits perceived enemies, particularly Saudi Arabia,\n\nregional governments, and their allies. This would\n\nlikely occur for a few primary reasons: to conduct\n\nnetwork reconnaissance activities to prepare for\n\nany future offensive or retaliatory cyber oper\nations; to conduct retaliatory cyber operations\n\ndamaging or destroying networks; or to obtain\n\ninformation to answer any current intelligence\n\ngaps of its enemy’s political strategies, military\n\n\nobjectives, and mission details. The lifting of\n\nsanctions will likely improve economic conditions\n\nin Iran and make infrastructure and technology\n\npurchases significantly easier. This potentially\n\nforeshadows an increase in both augmented capa\nbilities and the ability to operate more globally for\n\nIranian threat actors.\n\n###### NORTH KOREA\n\nWhile the Democratic People’s Republic of\n\nKorea (DPRK) has been involved in offensive\n\ncyber operations since at least 2009, the activity\n\nidentified in 2015 suggests a growing confidence\n\nto leverage such operations for espionage\n\npurposes during periods of heightened tension.\n\nChina has been historically inconsistent in di\nrecting North Korean behavior, recently publicly\n\ncondemning nuclear tests but privately providing\n\nmore aid, while fearing any escalation that could\n\nlead to a spillover of North Korean refugees into\n\nChinese territory. China has been the DPRK’s\n\nnumber one source of aid and trade in recent\n\nyears, and potentially a gateway for North Korean\n\ncyber operations; however, its increasing respon\nsibility in the global community consistently puts\n\nit at odds with protecting the rogue state. The\n\nDPRK has been observed increasing its ties with\n\nthe Russian Federation, potentially reducing the\n\ninfluence Beijing has over the rogue nation.\n\nA major shift in Chinese support may cause the\n\nDPRK to seek more a more aggressive cyber\n\nposture, on the high end as a preparation for\n\nmilitary readiness and on the low end as a means\n\nto reiterate its demands on the international stage\n\nby provoking western powers. It also cannot\n\nbe dismissed that DPRK cyber operations may\n\nfurther branch out into criminal activity as a\n\nway to increase the regime’s financial position.\n\nMonetization of cyber intrusion is consistent with\n\nthe responsibilities of the so called “3rd floor”\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich often mistakenly target unrelated websites.\n\nCrowdStrike assesses that the risk of organizations\n\nbeing affected as collateral damage in hacktivist\n\ncampaigns will remain prevalent throughout 2016.\n\n###### “ CROWDSTRIKE ASSESSES IT IS LIKELY THAT TARGETED CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE COMING YEAR. ”\n\nThis report previously discussed GEKKO JACKAL’s\n\ndevelopment of a botnet-based DDoS-for-hire\n\nservice using a lightaidra malware variant called\n\nbashlite. The source code for GEKKO JACKAL’s\n\nbashlite implant was publicly leaked in January\n\n2015. CrowdStrike has subsequently observed\n\na proliferation of this malware across multiple\n\nhacktivist communities and therefore assesses\n\nthat its prevalence will likely increase during 2016.\n\nSimilarly, the presence of bashlite infrastructure in\n\nidentified attacks will likely no longer be intrinsi\ncally indicative of GEKKO JACKAL involvement.\n\nIn addition to GEKKO JACKAL, CrowdStrike\n\nhas observed similar copycat hacktivist activ\nity during 2015. Like GEKKO JACKAL, these\n\ngroups originate largely from online gaming\n\ncommunities, which is often reflected in their\n\ntargeting of entertainment sector organizations.\n\nA recent example of such activity was the DDoS\n\nattacks against Xbox Live, PlayStation, and other\n\ngaming networks during the 2015 Christmas\n\nholiday by groups including Phantom Squad\n\nand OurMine Team. These groups are motivated\n\nprimarily by public recognition, and their ac\ntivity will likely remain prominent in 2016.\n\n\nthis drives the complexity of such malware up,\n\nproviding criminal elements who intend to use the\n\nmalware with increased revenue-generating oppor\ntunities. It is probable that in 2016, the introduction\n\nof new malware families with increased complexity\n\nand stealth will continue to expand. Ransomware\n\nhas been a growth market for criminals in 2015, and\n\nthis trend shows no sign of abating.\n\n###### EXTORTION\n\nExtortion actors in 2015 were extremely prevalent;\n\ngroups such as PIZZO SPIDER, MIMIC SPIDER,\n\nand other copycats targeted all manner of\n\nbusinesses. This activity may continue, however\n\ndue to increased awareness and lack of paying\n\nvictims, it is unlikely that these groups will see\n\nhigh return on investment and may disband.\n\nDue to the high visibility of these attacks,\n\ncoordinated investigation and disruption is\n\nlikely by international law enforcement.\n\nAnalysis of transactions to Bitcoin addresses\n\nobserved in various extortion schemes indicates\n\na very low number of paying victims. Businesses\n\nthat are extorted for Bitcoin often have no idea\n\nhow to find the necessary funds, and the delivery\n\nof ransom notes to email addresses that may not\n\nbe monitored or to users who have no idea what\n\nthe note is referring to result in slow response\n\ntimes. During those slow response times, the\n\nactors often move on to another target.\n\n###### HACKTIVISM\n\n**Motivation**\n\nRegional conflicts will likely remain a primary\n\ndriver of nationalistic hacktivist activity in\n\n2016. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) military\n\ninvolvement in Yemen, for example, has been\n\ncited by hacktivist actors operating on both\n\nsides of the conflict. These hacktivist cam\npaigns often occur in near-real time to the\n\n\nreal-world events that inspire them, and as\n\nsuch they can often be difficult to anticipate.\n\nWhile some nationalist groups are well estab\nlished and maintain a public web presence,\n\nsuch as DEADEYE JACKAL, others often\n\nmaterialize—seemingly instantaneously—to\n\ncarry out a sensational attack in retaliation to a\n\nreal-world event. Examples of the latter include\n\nthe previously discussed Yemen Cyber Army and,\n\nmore recently, the January 2016 compromise of\n\nSaudi-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya’s website\n\nby the Defenders of the Hijaz group. 2016 will\n\nalmost certainly see a continuation of hacktivist\n\nactivity mirroring regional conflict events.\n\nIn addition to politically motivated actors,\n\nhacktivists seeking public recognition will also\n\nlikely continue to be prominent in 2016. GEKKO\n\nJACKAL provides an example trajectory of\n\nhow such groups can increase in skill level and\n\nthus ultimately begin to move toward a finan\ncially motivated criminal operation. Copycat\n\ngroups, such as Phantom Squad, are currently\n\ninvolved primarily in DDoS attacks against\n\ngaming-sector targets; however, it should be\n\nexpected that these attacks, as seen in the case\n\nof GEKKO JACKAL, will broaden to include\n\nadditional verticals. International events such\n\nas the 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil will almost\n\ncertainly attract hacktivist actors seeking to\n\ncapitalize on the global visibility of the event.\n\n**DDoS**\n\n2015 saw a notable increase—both in frequency\n\nand effects—in DDoS attacks carried out by\n\nhacktivist actors. DDoS-based hacktivist activity\n\nthroughout the year varied in motivation and\n\nincluded more traditional protest-style cam\npaigns as well as those carried out by actors\n\ndriven solely by a desire for media attention.\n\nOne common trend identified as being in part\n\nresponsible for this increase in DDoS activity\n\nis the widespread availability of paid network\n\n\nstress testing, or stresser services. CrowdStrike\n\nassesses that the increasing adoption of paid\n\nstresser services for use in hacktivist opera\ntions will likely continue throughout 2016.\n\nThese DDoS-for-hire services allow low or\n\nunskilled actors to carry out disruptive attacks\n\nleveraging amplification TTPs. Such functionality\n\nrepresents a marked improvement over that\n\noffered by traditionally popular, freely available\n\nDDoS tools such as LOIC, Torshammer, or PyLoris.\n\nAdditionally, the use of third-party web-based\n\nDDoS services reduces the risk of attribution\n\nto the attacker, since disruptive traffic is not\n\ngenerated from the attacker’s own network as it\n\nis with the aforementioned freely available tools.\n\nIn addition to their ease of use and relatively low\n\ncost, stresser services have proven to be a power\nful tool in the hands of low-sophistication hacktiv\nist actors, enabling them to disrupt the operations\n\nof victim organizations. Attacks carried out in\n\nearly 2015 by actor Bitcoin Baron, for example,\n\nunderscore the disruptive and dangerous capa\nbility provided by such services. In March 2015,\n\nBitcoin Baron launched a series of attacks against\n\nstate and local government agencies in Wisconsin\n\nin protest of an alleged incident of police brutality.\n\nThe ensuing DDoS attack disrupted not only the\n\npublic websites of the city of Madison and local\n\nbanks, but also affected internal networks used\n\nfor emergency communication by the department\n\nof public safety. Specifically, police officer mobile\n\ndata terminals (MDT) as well as payment-pro\ncessing systems were reportedly impacted.\n\nAdditionally, due to the low barrier to entry,\n\nrelatively low risk of attribution, and ease of use\n\nassociated with stresser services, hacktivist cam\npaigns leveraging them are increasingly employing\n\nlittle vetting of target lists to ensure victim organi\nzations are in line with the operation’s stated aims.\n\nThis is best evidenced, as previously discussed,\n\nin Anonymous-led DDoS attacks opposing ISIS,\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CONCLUSION\n\n###### Bundling all of the security-related events in our increasingly connected world from the past year into one document tested all of the judgement, restraint, and nerves of the CrowdStrike Intelligence team. So many events that raced across the headlines of 2015 could not be feasibly included in this report, even though there was at least one analyst lobbying for its inclusion.\n\n\nhat is clear in this year’s report\n\nis that these events that may\n\nbelong in the digital realm are\n\nincreasingly relatable to the\n\nworld around us. The behaviors\n\nof malicious adversaries in the retrospective\n\n###### W\n\nwindow of 2015 seem so obvious when we look\n\nat the events that influenced them. Whether it\n\nbe the predictable Russian Federation intrusions\n\nfrom Ukraine through Europe to the United States,\n\nor the hacktivist-on-hacktivist attacks following\n\nthe terror attacks in Paris, or the massive uptick\n\nin Cryptographic Ransomware by eCrime actors\n\nfollowing the success of Cryptolocker—the events\n\nthat precipitated these actions are obvious.\n\nBy understanding the adversary, how they\n\nthink, and what events impact their beliefs and\n\nmotivations, it is possible to better prepare\n\n\nand react. Adversary activity is generally not\n\ninstantaneous after an event; they need to\n\nprepare, plan, and act. The instant an event\n\nthat impacts the adversary occurs, the clock\n\nbegins ticking as they enter a process described\n\nby the loop we have referenced many times\n\nbefore—observe, orient, decide, and act (OODA).\n\nIf you can go through these steps faster than the\n\nadversary, then you will know what they will do.\n\nIn 2016, practitioners of information security\n\nwill increasingly play a role in protecting and\n\nguiding businesses toward the right decisions\n\nto ensure the successful execution of their\n\nobjectives. Whether you are an IT professional, a\n\nmanager, a CEO, or a board member, in 2016 your\n\ndecisions can be more certain with the help of\n\nintelligence. It can power everything you do.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ABOUT CROWDSTRIKE\n\n CrowdStrike is the leader in next-generation endpoint protection, threat intelligence and response services.\n STOP\n CrowdStrike’s core technology, the Falcon platform, stops breaches by preventing and responding to all types of attacks – both malware and malware-free.\n\n CrowdStrike has revolutionized endpoint protection by combining three crucial elements: next BREACHES generation AV, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and a 24/7 managed hunting service — all\n\n powered by intelligence and uniquely delivered via the cloud in a single integrated solution.
