Cencosud manages a wide variety of stores\nin Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, including Easy home goods, Jumbo\nsupermarkets, and the Paris department stores.\n\nThis weekend, Cencosud was hit with a ransomware attack that encrypted devices\nthroughout their retail outlets and impacted the company's operations.\n\nAccording to Argentinian publisher Clarín, retail stores are still open, but some services are\nimpacted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, an Easy store in Buenos Aires is displaying a sign warning customers that\nthey are not accepting the 'Cencosud Card' credit card, accepting returns, or allowing the\npickup of web purchases due to technical problems.\n\n**Sign outside**\n\n**Easy store in Buenos Aires**\n\nSource: [Daniel Monastersky](https://twitter.com/identidadrobada)\nIf you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can\n[confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.](http://10.10.0.46/tel:+16469613731)\n\n## Egregor behind ransomware attack\n\nAfter learning of the attack, BleepingComputer obtain the ransom note and can confirm it\nwas conducted by Egregor and targeted the 'Cencosud' Windows domain.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cencosud's Egregor ransom note**\nEgregor is a ransomware-as-a-service operation that began operating in the middle of\nSeptember, just as another ransomware group known as Maze started shutting down their\noperation. BleepingComputer has learned from threat actors that many hackers who\npartnered with Maze are now working with Egregor.\n\n[Clarín also reported that printers in numerous retail outlets in Chile and Argentina, such as](https://www.clarin.com/tecnologia/hackearon-cencosud-pedirian-millones-dolares-publicar-informacion-privada-clientes-disco-jumbo-vea_0_XDYHVMm9s.html)\nEasy home goods stores, began printing out ransom notes as devices are encrypted.\n\nThis function is a known \"feature\" of the Egregor ransomware software, which will\nautomatically print ransom notes to attached printers after the files on a device have been\nencrypted. For network-wide attacks, this could potentially lead to thousands of ransom\nnotes being printed throughout the organization.\n\nThe ransom note does not provide links to proof of stolen data, but Egregor has a history of\nstealing unencrypted files before deploying their ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Egregor has been responsible for other high profile attacks on Crytek, Ubisoft, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crytek-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-ubisoft-data-leaked/) Barnes\nand Noble.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Cencosud with further questions but has not heard back.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Cencosud](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cencosud/)\n[Egregor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/egregor/)\n[Latin America](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/latin-america/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
