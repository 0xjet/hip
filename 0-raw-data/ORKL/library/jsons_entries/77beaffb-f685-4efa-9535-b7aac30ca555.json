According to our data, the ransomware is mainly being\ntargeted to Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan, but the ransomware has successfully infected major\n[institutions, like hospitals across England and Spanish telecommunications company,](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/12/hospitals-across-england-hit-by-large-scale-cyber-attack)\n[Telefonica.](http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-cyber-idUKKBN1881TI)\n\nBelow is a map showing the countries being targeted most by WannaCry:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe saw the first version of WannaCry in February and now the ransomware is available in\n28 different languages, from languages like Bulgarian to Vietnamese. Today at 8 am CET, we\nnoticed an increase in activity of this strain, which quickly escalated into a massive\nspreading, beginning at 10 am.\n\nThe ransomware changes the affected file extension names to “.WNCRY”, so an infected file\nwill look something like: original_name_of_file.jpg.WNCRY, for example. The encrypted files\nare also marked by the “WANACRY!” string at the beginning of the file.\n\nThis ransomware drops the following ransom notes in a text file:\n\nFurthermore, the ransom being demanded is $300 worth of bitcoins. The ransom message,\nwhere instructions on how to pay the ransom, an explanation of what happened, and a\ncountdown timer are displayed in what the cybercriminals behind the ransomware are\nreferring to as “Wana Decrypt0r 2.0”:\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, the victim’s wallpaper is changed to the following image:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis attack once again proves that ransomware is a powerful weapon that can be used\nagainst consumers and businesses alike. Ransomware becomes particularly nasty when it\ninfects institutions like hospitals, where it can put people’s lives in danger.\n\n## Infection vector: WannaCry\n\nWannaCry is most likely spreading on so many computers by using an exploit the Equation\nGroup, which is a group that is widely suspected of being tied to the NSA, used for its dirty\nbusiness. A hacker group called ShadowBrokers has stolen Equation Group’s hacking tools\nand has publicly released them. As confirmed by security researcher, [Kafeine, the exploit,](https://twitter.com/kafeine/status/863049739583016960)\nknown as ETERNALBLUE or MS17-010, was probably used by the cybercriminals behind\nWannaCry and is a Windows SMB (Server Message Block, a network file sharing protocol)\nvulnerability.\n\n[Avast antivirus detects all known versions of WannaCry, but we strongly recommend all](https://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download)\nWindows users fully update their system with the latest available patches. We will continue to\nmonitor this outbreak and update this blog post when we have further updates.\n\n**IOCs:**\n\n09a46b3e1be080745a6d8d88d6b5bd351b1c7586ae0dc94d0c238ee36421cafa\n\n\n-----\n\n24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c\n\n2584e1521065e45ec3c17767c065429038fc6291c091097ea8b22c8a502c41dd\n\n2ca2d550e603d74dedda03156023135b38da3630cb014e3d00b1263358c5f00d\n\n4A468603FDCB7A2EB5770705898CF9EF37AADE532A7964642ECD705A74794B79\n\nB9C5D4339809E0AD9A00D4D3DD26FDF44A32819A54ABF846BB9B560D81391C25\n\nd8a9879a99ac7b12e63e6bcae7f965fbf1b63d892a8649ab1d6b08ce711f7127\n\ned01ebfbc9eb5bbea545af4d01bf5f1071661840480439c6e5babe8e080e41aa\n\nf8812f1deb8001f3b7672b6fc85640ecb123bc2304b563728e6235ccbe782d85\n\n\n-----",
