Today, the United States and our\nallies and partners are exposing further details of the PRC’s pattern of malicious cyber\nactivity and taking further action to counter it, as it poses a major threat to U.S. and allies’\neconomic and national security.\n\n**An unprecedented group of allies and partners – including the European Union, the**\n**United Kingdom, and NATO – are joining the United States in exposing and criticizing**\n**the PRC’s malicious cyber activities.**\n\nThe PRC’s pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace is inconsistent with its stated\nobjective of being seen as a responsible leader in the world. Today, countries around the\nworld are making it clear that concerns regarding the PRC’s malicious cyber activities is\nbringing them together to call out those activities, promote network defense and\ncybersecurity, and act to disrupt threats to our economies and national security.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur allies and partners are a tremendous source of strength and a unique American\nadvantage, and our collective approach to cyber threat information sharing, defense, and\nmitigation helps hold countries like China to account. Working collectively enhances and\nincreases information sharing, including cyber threat intelligence and network defense\ninformation, with public and private stakeholders and expand diplomatic engagement to\nstrengthen our collective cyber resilience and security cooperation. Today’s announcement\nbuilds on the progress made from the President’s first foreign trip. From the G7 and EU\ncommitments around ransomware to NATO adopting a new cyber defense policy for the first\ntime in seven years, the President is putting forward a common cyber approach with our\nallies and laying down clear expectations and markers on how responsible nations behave in\ncyberspace.\n\nToday, in coordination with our allies, the Biden administration is:\n\n**Exposing the PRC’s use of criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber**\n**operations globally, including for their own personal profit.**\n\nThe United States is deeply concerned that the PRC has fostered an intelligence enterprise\nthat includes contract hackers who also conduct unsanctioned cyber operations worldwide,\nincluding for their own personal profit. As detailed in public charging documents unsealed in\nOctober 2018 and July and September 2020, hackers with a history of working for the PRC\nMinistry of State Security (MSS) have engaged in ransomware attacks, cyber enabled\nextortion, crypto-jacking, and rank theft from victims around the world, all for financial gain.\n\nIn some cases, we are aware that PRC government-affiliated cyber operators have\nconducted ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom\ndemands of millions of dollars. The PRC’s unwillingness to address criminal activity by\ncontract hackers harms governments, businesses, and critical infrastructure operators\nthrough billions of dollars in lost intellectual property, proprietary information, ransom\npayments, and mitigation efforts.\n\n**United States Department of Justice imposing costs and announcing criminal charges**\n**against four MSS hackers.**\n\nThe US Department of Justice is announcing criminal charges against four MSS hackers\naddressing activities concerning a multiyear campaign targeting foreign governments and\nentities in key sectors, including maritime, aviation, defense, education, and healthcare in a\nleast a dozen countries. DOJ documents outline how MSS hackers pursued the theft of\nEbola virus vaccine research and demonstrate that the PRC’s theft of intellectual property,\ntrade secrets, and confidential business information extends to critical public health\ninformation. Much of the MSS activity alleged in the Department of Justice’s charges stands\nin stark contrast to the PRC’s bilateral and multilateral commitments to refrain from engaging\nin cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial advantage.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attributing with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors affiliated with**\n**PRC’s MSS conducted cyber espionage operations utilizing the zero-day**\n**vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server disclosed in early March 2021.**\n\nBefore Microsoft released its security updates, MSS-affiliated cyber operators exploited\nthese vulnerabilities to compromise tens of thousands of computers and networks worldwide\nin a massive operation that resulted in significant remediation costs for its mostly private\nsector victims.\n\nWe have raised our concerns about both this incident and the PRC’s broader malicious cyber\nactivity with senior PRC Government officials, making clear that the PRC’s actions threaten\nsecurity, confidence, and stability in cyberspace.\n\n**The Biden Administration’s response to the Microsoft Exchange incident has**\n**strengthened the USG’s Cyber Defenses.**\n\nIn the past few months, we have focused on ensuring the MSS-affiliated malicious cyber\nactors were expelled from public and private sector networks and the vulnerability was\npatched and mitigated to prevent the malicious cyber actors from returning or causing\nadditional damage.\n\n**As announced in April, the U.S. Government conducted cyber operations and**\n**pursued proactive network defense actions to prevent systems compromised**\n**through the Exchange Server vulnerabilities from being used for ransomware**\n**attacks or other malicious purposes. The United States will continue to take all**\nappropriate steps to protect the American people from cyber threats. Following\nMicrosoft’s original disclosure in early March 2021, the United States Government also\nidentified other vulnerabilities in the Exchange Server software. Rather than\nwithholding them, the United States Government recognized that these vulnerabilities\ncould pose systemic risk and the National Security Agency notified Microsoft to ensure\npatches were developed and released to the private sector. We will continue to\nprioritize sharing vulnerability information with the private sector to secure the nation’s\nnetworks and infrastructure.\n**The U.S. Government announced and operated under a** **[new model for cyber](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/19/statement-by-deputy-national-security-advisor-for-cyber-and-emerging-technology-on-solarwinds-and-microsoft-exchange-incidents/)**\n**incident response by including private companies in the Cyber Unified**\n**Coordination Group (UCG) to address the Exchange Server vulnerabilities. The**\nUCG is a whole-of-government coordination element stood up in response to a\nsignificant cyber incident. We credit those companies for being willing to collaborate\nwith the United States Government in the face of a significant cyber incident that could\nhave been substantially worse without key partnership of the private sector. We will\nbuild on this model to bolster public-private collaboration and information sharing\nbetween the United States Government and the private sector on cybersecurity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Today, the National Security Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure**\n**Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a cybersecurity**\n**advisory to detail additional PRC state-sponsored cyber techniques used to**\n**target U.S. and allied networks, including those used when targeting the**\n**Exchange Server vulnerabilities. By exposing these techniques and providing**\nactionable guidance to mitigate them, the U.S. Government continues to empower\nnetwork defenders around the world to take action against cybersecurity threats. We\nwill continue to provide such advisories to ensure companies and government agencies\nhave actionable information to quickly defend their networks and protect their data.\n\n**The Biden Administration is working around the clock to modernize Federal networks**\n**and improve the nation’s cybersecurity, including of critical infrastructure.**\n\n**The Administration has funded five cybersecurity modernization efforts across**\n**the Federal government to modernize network defenses to meet the threat. These**\ninclude state-of-the-art endpoint security, improving logging practices, moving to a\nsecure cloud environment, upgrading security operations centers, and deploying multifactor authentication and encryption technologies.\n**The Administration is implementing President Biden’s** **[Executive Order to](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/)**\n**improve the nation’s cybersecurity and protect Federal government networks.**\nThe E.O. contains aggressive but achievable implementation milestones, and to date\nwe have met every milestone on time including:\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) convened a workshop\nwith almost 1000 participants from industry, academia, and government to obtain\ninput on best practices for building secure software.\nNIST issued guidelines for the minimum standards that should be used by\nvendors to test the security of their software. This shows how we are leveraging\nfederal procurement to improve the security of software not only used by the\nfederal government but also used by companies, state and local governments,\nand individuals.\nThe National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)\npublished minimum elements for a Software Bill of Materials, as a first step to\nimprove transparency of software used by the American public.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) established a\nframework to govern how Federal civilian agencies can securely use cloud\nservices.\n\n\n-----\n\n**We continue to work closely with the private sector to address cybersecurity**\n**vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure. The Administration announced an Industrial**\nControl System Cybersecurity Initiative in April and launched the Electricity Subsector\nAction Plan as a pilot. Under this pilot, we have already seen over 145 of 255 priority\nelectricity entities that service over 76 million American customers adopt ICS\ncybersecurity monitoring technologies to date, and that number keeps growing. The\nElectricity Subsector pilot will be followed by similar pilots for pipelines, water, and\nchemical.\n**The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued Security Directive 1 to**\n**require critical pipeline owners and operators to adhere to cybersecurity**\n**standards. Under this directive, those owners and operators are required to report**\nconfirmed and potential cybersecurity incidents to CISA and to designate a\nCybersecurity Coordinator, to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The\ndirective also requires critical pipeline owners and operators to review their current\npractices as well as to identify any gaps and related remediation measures to address\ncyber-related risks and report the results to TSA and CISA within 30 days. In days to\ncome, TSA will issue Security Directive 2 to further support the pipeline industry in\nenhancing its cybersecurity and that strengthen the public-private partnership so critical\nto the cybersecurity of our homeland.\n\nBy exposing the PRC’s malicious activity, we are continuing the Administration’s efforts to\ninform and empower system owners and operators to act. We call on private sector\ncompanies to follow the Federal government’s lead and take ambitious measures to\naugment and align cybersecurity investments with the goal of minimizing future incidents.\n\n###\n\n\n-----",
