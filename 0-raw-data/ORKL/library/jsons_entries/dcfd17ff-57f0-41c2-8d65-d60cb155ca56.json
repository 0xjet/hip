To make this already\nconvenient way of never having to leave the couch to buy new things even more convenient, people are increasingly using their smartphones\n[instead of computers to shop: in Q1 2021, smartphones accounted for 69% of all retail website visits worldwide, and smartphone purchases](https://www.statista.com/statistics/568684/e-commerce-website-visit-and-orders-by-device/)\n[made up 57% of online shopping orders. A noteworthy aspect of buying goods and services via a mobile device is that 53% of smartphone](https://buildfire.com/mobile-ecommerce-statistics-data/)\nusers do it from vendor-specific applications.\n\nSeeking the opportunity to make a profit off this behavior, cybercriminals exploit it by tricking eager shoppers into downloading malicious\napplications. In an ongoing campaign targeting the customers of eight Malaysian banks, threat actors are trying to steal banking credentials\nby using fake websites that pose as legitimate services, sometimes outright copying the original. These websites use similar domain names\nto the services they are impersonating the better to attract unsuspecting victims.\n\n## Campaign overview\n\n[This campaign was first identified at the end of 2021, with the attackers impersonating the legitimate cleaning service Maid4u. Distributed](https://ringgitplus.com/en/blog/personal-finance-news/latest-phishing-scam-hides-within-an-app-and-is-disturbingly-sophisticated.html)\nthrough Facebook ads, the campaign tempts potential victims to download Android malware from a malicious website. It is still ongoing as of\nthe publication of this blogpost, with even more distribution domains registered after its discovery. In January 2022, MalwareHunterTeam\nshared _[three](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1478371743760793605)_ _[more](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1478079926800637958)_ _[malicious websites and Android trojans attributed to this campaign.](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1478090631578890247)_\n\n\n-----\n\nO top o t at, S esea c e s ou d ou o e a e ebs tes se e ebs tes pe so ated se ces t at a e o y a a ab e\nMalaysia: six of them, Grabmaid, Maria’s Cleaning, Maid4u, YourMaid, Maideasy and MaidACall, offer cleaning services, and the seventh is a\npet store named PetsMore. The side-by-side comparison of the legitimate and copycat versions of Grabmaid and PetsMore can be seen in\nFigures 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Grabmaid: legitimate website on the left, copycat on the right_\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. PetsMore: legitimate website on the left, copycat on the right_\n\nThe copycat websites do not provide an option to shop directly through them. Instead, they include buttons that claim to download apps from\nGoogle Play. However, clicking these buttons does not actually lead to the Google Play store, but to servers under the threat actors’ control.\nTo succeed, this attack requires the intended victims to enable the non-default “Install unknown apps” option on their devices. Interestingly,\nfive of the seven legitimate versions of these services do not even have an app available on Google Play.\n\nTo appear legitimate, the applications ask the users to sign in after starting them up; there is however no account validation on the server side\n– the software takes any input from the user and always declares it correct. Keeping up the appearance of an actual e-shop, the malicious\napplications pretend to offer goods and services for purchase while matching the interface of the original stores (see Figure 3 for a screenshot\nof the shopping cart in one of the malicious apps). When the time comes to pay for the order, the victims are presented with payment options\n– they can pay either by credit card or by transferring the required amount from their bank accounts. During our research, it was not possible\nto pick the credit card option.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. The shopping cart in a malicious application_\n\nAs we already mentioned, the goal of the malware operators is to obtain the banking credentials of their victims. After picking the direct\ntransfer option, victims are presented a fake FPX payment page and asked to choose their bank out of the eight Malaysian banks provided,\nand then enter their credentials. The targeted banks are Maybank, Affin Bank, Public Bank Berhad, CIMB bank, BSN, RHB, Bank Islam\nMalaysia, and Hong Leong Bank, as seen in Figure 4.\n\n_Figure 4. Targeted banks_\n\nAfter unfortunate victims submit their banking credentials, they receive an error message informing them that the user ID or password they\nprovided was invalid (Figure 5). At this point, the entered credentials have been sent to the malware operators, as Figure 6 shows.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Error message displayed to the victim after credentials are exfiltrated_\n\n_Figure 6. Credentials being sent to the attacker’s server_\n\n\n-----\n\no a e su e t e t eat acto s ca get to t e ct s ba accou ts, t e a e e s op app cat o s a so o a d a S S essages\nreceived by the victim to the operators in case they contain Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) codes sent by the bank (see Figure 7).\n\n_Figure 7. All received SMS messages are forwarded to the attacker’s server_\n\n## Malware description\n\nThe observed malware is rather minimalistic: it is designed to request only one user permission, which is to read received SMS messages. Its\ngoal is to phish for banking credentials and forward 2FA SMS messages from the compromised device to the operators. Lacking the\nfunctionality to remove SMS messages from the device, the malware cannot hide that somebody is trying to get into the victim’s bank\naccount.\n\nSo far, the malware has been targeting only Malaysia – both the e-shops it impersonates and the banks whose customers’ credentials it is\nafter are Malaysian, and the prices in the applications are all displayed in the local currency, the Malaysian Ringgit.\n\n[One of the services impersonated in the campaign, MaidACall, has already warned its users of this fraudulent campaign via a Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/MaidACall/posts/2066087886892366)\n(see Figure 8). The rest have not publicly commented on the issue yet.\n\n_Figure 8. Warning post by a service that was impersonated during the campaign_\n\nWe have found the same malicious code in all three analyzed applications, leading us to conclude that they can all be attributed to the same\nthreat actor.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nTo protect yourself against this type of threat, first, try to ensure that you are using legitimate websites to shop:\n\nVerify if the website is secure, i.e., its URL begins with https://. Some browsers might even refuse to open non-HTTPS websites and\nexplicitly warn users or provide an option to enable HTTPS-only mode.\nBe wary of clicking ads and do not follow paid search engine results: it is possible that they do not lead to the official website\n\nApart from looking out for fake websites, here are some other useful tips to enjoy a safer online shopping experience on your smartphone:\n\nPay attention to the source of applications you are downloading. Make sure that you are actually redirected to the Google Play store\nwhen getting an application\nUse software or hardware 2FA instead of SMS when possible\nUse mobile security solutions to detect harmful websites and malicious apps\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe observed campaign is a fake e-shop scheme targeting the banking credentials of Android users in Malaysia. It exploits the popularity of\nusing smartphones to shop online. Instead of phishing for banking credentials on websites, the threat actors have introduced Android\napplications into the chain of compromise, thus making sure they have access to 2FA SMS messages the victim is likely to receive. The\nscheme relies on using ads to lure potential victims into accessing copycat versions of legitimate websites. Once there, a fake Google Play\ndownload button directs them towards a malicious application distributed by the malware operators via a third-party site.\n\n\n-----\n\ne t e ca pa g ta gets a ays a e c us e y o o, t g t e pa d to ot e cou t es a d ba s ate o t t s t e, t e attac e s a e\nafter banking credentials, but they may also enable the theft of credit card information in the future.\n\n_For any inquiries about our research published on WeLiveSecurity, please contact us at threatintel@eset.com._\n_ESET Research now also offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.
