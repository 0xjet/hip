The documents detail\nproject requirements contracted with the Russian Ministry of Defense, including in at least\n[one instance for GRU Unit 74455, also known as Sandworm Team. These projects include](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/ukraine-and-sandworm-team)\ntools, training programs, and a red team platform for exercising various types of offensive\ncyber operations, including cyber espionage, IO, and operational technology (OT) attacks.\n\nThe documents, which are dated between 2016 and 2020, offer a brief snapshot of previous\nRussian investments and considerations in scaling cyber operations and capability\ndevelopment. However, Mandiant lacks evidence to prove that the capabilities we discuss\n\n\n-----\n\nhave been implemented or are feasible.\n\nA note on source authenticity: Mandiant cannot conclusively confirm the authenticity of these\ndocuments based on limitations in our current visibility. However, we strongly suspect they\nare legitimate based on consistencies observed across the documents we reviewed, limited\ninstances where we were able to validate details externally, and an apparent alignment\nbetween the capabilities detailed for development in these programs and those that we have\npreviously observed used at high levels by Russian intelligence services.\n\n## NTC Vulkan Documents Detail Requirements to Develop Cyber and IO Capabilities\n\nNTC Vulkan is a Russian IT contractor based in Moscow, which publicly advertises working\non contracts with large companies and government agencies within Russia. The company’s\nwebsite cites compliance with Russian government standards but does not publicly state\nworking with Russian state contractors, such as research institutes or Russian intelligence\nservices. Based on our analysis of the leaked documentation, NTC Vulkan has held\ncontracts with Russian intelligence services on projects to enable cyber and IO operations,\npotentially in tandem with cyber operations against OT targets.\n\nThe documents detail three projects: Scan, Amesit, and Krystal-2B.\n\nTable 1: Summary of main projects identified in NTC Vulkan documents\n\n**Tool** **Description** **Contract**\n**Dates**\n\n\nScan\n\nAmesit\n(Alt:\nAmezit)\n\n\nA comprehensive framework likely used to enable cyber operations.\nScan consists of a variety of methods for large-scale data collection\nand contains comprehensive documentation on how to structure\ndatabases to store and handle such information. Based on the\nsignatories, Scan documentation was contracted (at least in part) by\nGRU Unit 7445, or Sandworm Team.\n\nA framework used to control the online information environment and\nmanipulate public opinion, enhance psychological operations, and\nstore and organize data for upstream communication of efforts.\nInformation confrontation and psychological operations in Amesit are\ndesigned to support IO and OT-related operations.\n\n\n~20182019\n\n20162018\n\n\n-----\n\nKrystal2B\n\n\nA training platform for exercising coordinated IO/OT attacks against\ntransportation and utility industries using Amesit. The exercise’s\nprogram highlights particular scenarios against OT environments\nand Russian infrastructure. Krystal-2B may be a red teaming or\ndefensively focused exercise, but demonstrates interest in\ncoordinating IO/OT attacks.\n\n\n20182020\n\n\n## Cyber Capabilities for Information Confrontation\n\nThe cyber operation tools and capabilities detailed in the leaked NTC Vulkan documents are\npresented as separate and distinct projects. Mandiant did not identify any evidence indicating\nhow or when the tools could be used. However, based on our analysis of the capabilities, we\nconsider it feasible that the projects represent only some pieces of a variety of capabilities\npursued by Russian-sponsored actors to conduct different types of cyber operations.\n\nScan appears to be a comprehensive framework used to gather different types of information\nsuch as network details, configurations, and vulnerabilities, among other types of data,\nto enable cyber operations. Amesit and Krystal-2B focus on developing capability to control\nthe information environment, in part by simulating IT/OT attacks. The documents included\npictures of a prototype platform that would enable operators to interact with different cyber\n[operation tools. This combination of capabilities is in line with what Russian intelligence](https://css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/resources/docs/NDC%20fm_9.pdf)\nservices deem a key part of their information confrontation strategy.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Assessment of capabilities documented in NTC Vulkan aligned with broader\nstrategic goals of Russian intelligence services\n\n## Reconnaissance, Preparation, and Enablement of the Attack Lifecycle\n\nCapabilities documented in the contracted NTC Vulkan project Scan could help automate\nparts of the reconnaissance and preparation of operations. Scan is a framework comprising\nmultiple components including a large-scale database, methods to gather data from various\nsources, and a platform to process and action such data collections.\n\nThe documentation about Scan is incredibly comprehensive, detailing data transfer between\ncomponents, open-source and foreign-made software and hardware. Additionally, the\ncapabilities described for this tool’s design take into consideration the need for coordination\nacross groups and operators in different locations. Comprehensive capability gathering and\nprocessing data—such as the one described in Scan—could enable the operators to\nsystematize and automate cyber operations to conduct activity across a range of domains\nfrom cyber espionage to OT targeted attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: High-level hardware and software specifications associated to the Scan project\n\nThe Scan framework documentation seems to present requirements and initial designs\nfor a database fed by multiple data sources and built for both automated and manual\ninput to enable cyber operations. The documentation provides examples of data\ncollection requirements including, for example, automatic scanning for vulnerabilities,\ngathering details about network infrastructure, and collecting other relevant information\nabout targets.\nScan requirements also include enabling operators to collect data manually and via\nautomation. Another requested capability is a “Processing” component, which is\nmanually operated to serve data requests at need.\nScan requirements also include outlining possible attack paths for operators,\nvisualizing network mappings and target geography. Such capabilities are supposed to\nbe supported by tooling with visualization components and processes for deconfliction\nacross regional units using the framework.\n\n## Managing and Executing Information Operations\n\nCapabilities outlined in NTC Vulkan Amesit documentation could support a full information\noperations life cycle: monitoring the media landscape, creating content to promote a specific\nnarrative, establishing and leveraging means to disseminate that content, and assessing the\neffectiveness of an operation (Figure 3). The use-case detailed in the documents suggests a\nsystematic approach to IO wherein operators can leverage a suite of options to tailor and\nadapt their operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: The documents detailing Amesit’s functionality outline a specific information\noperations cycle that the system should support\n\nRequirements detailed for components of Amesit state that various online forums are\n“actively used to form and manipulate public opinion” and that an actor interested in\nmanipulating public opinion must be able to identify and leverage the “most effective\ninformation channels” to target audiences susceptible to the desired positions.\nMonitoring and collection capabilities include those that appear intended to enable\noperators to track the promotion of a given narrative or issue across various segments\nof the online discussion, including on news portals, social media, blogs, and forums.\nContent creation requirements would allow operators to create or modify so-called\n“special materials” for dissemination in operations. This includes text, image, video,\nand audio content in various formats.\nMeans to disseminate content across multiple vectors are specified, including via social\nmedia and blogs, SMS text messaging, and email.\n\nAn individual operator should be able to manage at least 100 social media\nprofiles from their workstation, according to the requirements.\n\nThe requirements also discuss how to reduce the risk of identification and potential\nattribution. This includes the ability to clean and replace metadata attached to the files of\ncontent created for dissemination, and means of creating inauthentic profiles on social media\nand forums for content promotion.\n\nFunctions detailed in the requirements also account for the ability to localize the targeting of\nan operation within a given geographic area. While it is unclear what targets the tools would\nbe used upon, some of the social media platforms and information resources listed as\ntargets for data collection and content dissemination include those more specific to Russia\nand the surrounding region. It also includes those with broader global usership, suggesting\nthat Amnesit tooling could be used both for regional or broader targeting.\n\n## Targeting Operational Technology Systems\n\n\n-----\n\nThe documents from NTC Vulkan also include contents related to OT systems in two\nprojects: Krystal-2B and Amesit. Krystal-2B is a training platform that simulates OT attacks\nagainst different types of OT environments in coordination with some IO components by\nleveraging Amesit “for the purpose of disruption.” The Krystal-2B documentation highlights\nscenarios against Russian military infrastructure, rail systems, airports, sea ports, and\nenergy and water utilities, but does not detail specific methodologies on the malicious\nactivities executed within these exercises. Krystal-2B appears designed to support both\noffensive exercises against OT environments (Figure 4) and defensive exercises to examine\nvulnerabilities in Russian military infrastructure.\n\nFigure 4: Sample excerpt of Krystal-2B program highlighting training for OT-oriented cyber\n\n\n-----\n\nattacks\nThe Krystal-2B project relies on tooling from another project named Amesit. The OT portion\nof the project is referenced in a set of testing requirements for Amesit, which describes the\nimplementation of simulated OT test bed environments for rail and pipeline control systems.\nThe Amesit documentation indicates these models would be supported by either graphical or\nphysical models of these systems to visualize the effects of cyber attacks, clearly\nestablishing these industries as Russia’s targets of interest for OT-oriented attacks.\n\nThe only attack-related requirement for the OT test beds is that they provide “simulation of\nARP-spoofing attacks, leading to violations of simulated technological processes.” These\nviolations include either common IT-oriented impacts on the network infrastructure or\ncomplex changes in the parameters of the OT via “specialized software.” It is unclear\nwhether such software refers to Amesit tooling, legitimate programmable logic controller\n(PLC) engineering software, or some other existing capabilities. While we have not linked\n[this activity to existing toolsets, frameworks like INCONTROLLER are designed to support](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/incontroller-state-sponsored-ics-tool)\nthese types of parameter changes.\n\nThe document also specifies specific parameters of the control systems that the attacker\nshould be able to affect and physical impacts the attacker should be able to generate. These\nspecifications provide potential insight into the process-level design of these attack\nscenarios.\n\nFor rail systems, this includes manipulating the speed of trains, creating unauthorized\ntrack transfers, causing car traffic barriers to fail, and causing combined heat and\npower (CHP) units to fail, with the explicit objective of causing train collisions and\naccidents.\nFor pipeline systems, this includes closing valves, shutting down pumps, overfilling\ntanks, spilling materials, and causing pump cavitation and overheating.\n\nAlthough there is little information in both documents on how the attacks would occur in a\nreal setting, the capabilities we observed are consistent to those Mandiant has observed in\nprevious attacks and tooling from Russian-sponsored actors. Another noteworthy\nobservation is the incorporation of IO capabilities in the same projects that describe OT\ntargeting, which hints at the likelihood of deploying campaigns that leverage both resources\nto support complex information warfare operations.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nThe contracted projects from NTC Vulkan provide insight into the investment of Russian\nintelligence services into developing capabilities to deploy more efficient operations within\nthe beginning of the attack lifecycle, a piece of operations often hidden from our view. A\nframework like the one suggested in the Scan project illustrates how the GRU may be trying\n\n\n-----\n\nto enable fast-paced operations with high coordination among regional units. A oncesegmented GRU cyber operation may become streamlined and more efficient using a\nframework like Scan.\n\nThese projects also show interest in holistic operations to conduct information control and/or\nconfrontation and amplify the psychological effects of cyber operations. For example, Amesit\nand Krystal-2B demonstrate a high value placed on the psychological impact of offensive\ncyber attacks, specifically OT operations, by highlighting the role of information operations in\ndetermining the impact of an ICS incident. The combination of different tactics in cyber\noperations is familiar to Russian cyber operations: an early example is the multifaceted\nBLACKENERGY operation in 2015 leading to disruption of energy infrastructure in Ukraine.\nWe have also seen the combination of IO and disruptive cyberattacks throughout the Ukraine\nwar.\n\nThe documentation from Krystal-2B and Amesit also displays interest in critical infrastructure\ntargets, particularly energy utilities and oil and gas, but also water utilities and transportation\nsystems, including rail, sea, and air. As we continue to observe the intensification of threat\nactivity from Russian-sponsored actors in parallel to the invasion in Ukraine, defenders\nshould remain aware about the capabilities and priorities reflected in these documents to be\nprepared for protecting critical infrastructure and services.\n\n\n-----",
