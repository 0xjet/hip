These cybercriminals are\nhappy to put aside previous Ransomware-as-a-Service hierarchies to focus on the ill-gotten\ngains to be made from controlling victim’s networks, rather than the previous approach which\nprioritized control of the ransomware itself.\n\n## Introduction\n\nFor many years the world of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) was perceived as a\nsomewhat hierarchical and structured organization. Ransomware developers would\nadvertise their RaaS program on forums and gracefully open up slots for affiliates to join their\nteam to commit crime. The RaaS admins would conduct interviews with potential affiliates to\nmake sure they were skilled enough to participate. Historically, i.e., with [CTB locker, the](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/advanced-threat-research/)\nemphasis was on affiliates generating enough installs via a botnet, exploit kits or stolen\ncredentials, but it has shifted in recent years to being able to penetrate and compromise a\ncomplete network using a variety of malicious and non-malicious tools. This essentially\nchanged the typical affiliate profile towards a highly-skilled pen-tester/sysadmin.\n\nFigure 1. Recruitment posting for CTB locker from 2014\n\n**Figure 1. Recruitment posting for CTB locker from 2014**\n\nFigure 2. Recruitment posting for REvil from 2020\n\n**Figure 2. Recruitment posting for REvil from 2020**\n[Experts often describe the hierarchy of a conventional organized crime group as a pyramid](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-7/key-issues/hierarchical-model.html)\nstructure. Historically, La Cosa Nostra, drug cartels and outlaw motor gangs were organized\nin such a fashion. However, due to further professionalization and specialization of the\n\n\n-----\n\nlogistics involved with committing crime, groups have evolved into more opportunistic\nnetwork-based groups that will work together more fluidly, according to their current needs.\n\n[While criminals collaborating in the world of cybercrime isn’t](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/194364696/DEVIANT_SECURITY_EHAVANDESANDT.pdf) [a novel concept, a RaaS group’s](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/194364696/DEVIANT_SECURITY_EHAVANDESANDT.pdf)\nhierarchy is more rigid compared to other forms of cybercrime, due to the power imbalance\nbetween the group’s developers/admins and affiliates.\n\nFor a long time, RaaS admins and developers were prioritized as the top targets, often\nneglecting the affiliates since they were perceived as less-skilled. This, combined with the\nlack of disruptions in the RaaS ecosystem, created an atmosphere where those lesserskilled affiliates could thrive and grow into very competent cybercriminals.\n\nHowever, this growth isn’t without consequences. Recently we have observed certain events\nthat might be the beginning of a new chapter in the RaaS ecosystem.\n\n## Cracks in the RaaS model\n\nTrust in the cybercriminal underground is based on a few things, such as keeping your word\nand paying people what they deserve. Just like with legitimate jobs, when employees feel\ntheir contributions aren’t adequately rewarded, those people start causing friction within the\norganization. Ransomware has been generating billions of dollars in recent years and with\nrevenue like that, it’s only a matter of time before some individuals who believe they aren’t\ngetting their fair share become unhappy.\n\nRecently, a former Conti affiliate was unhappy with their financial portion and decided to\ndisclose the complete Conti attack playbook and their Cobalt Strike infrastructure online, as\nshown in the screenshot below.\n\nFigure 3. Disgruntled Conti affiliate\n\n**Figure 3. Disgruntled Conti affiliate**\nIn the past, ATR has been approached by individuals affiliated with certain RaaS groups\nexpressing grudges with other RaaS members and admins, claiming they haven’t been paid\nin time or that their share wasn’t proportionate to the amount of work they put in.\n\nRecently, security researcher [Fabian Wosar opened a dedicated Jabber account for](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1433050105872109576)\ndisgruntled cybercriminals to reach out anonymously and he stated that there was a high\nlevel of response.\n\nFigure 4. Jabber group for unhappy threat actors\n\n**Figure 4. Jabber group for unhappy threat actors**\nMoreover, the popular cybercrime forums have banned ransomware actors from advertising\nsince the Colonial Pipeline attack. Now, the groups no longer have a platform on which to\nactively recruit, show their seniority, offer escrow, have their binaries tested by moderators,\n\n\n-----\n\nor settle disputes. The lack of visibility has made it harder for RaaS groups to establish or\nmaintain credibility and will make it harder for RaaS developers to maintain their current top\ntier position in the underground.\n\n## Paying respects…. RAMP Forum and Orange\n\nAfter a turbulent shutdown of Babuk and the fallout from the Colonial Pipeline and Kaseya\nattacks, it seems that some of the ransomware-affiliated cybercriminals have found a home\nin a forum known as RAMP.\n\nFigure 5. RAMP posting by Orange, introducing Groove and explaining relationships\n\n**Figure 5. RAMP posting by Orange, introducing Groove and explaining relationships**\n**Translated Posting**\n\nWhen analyzing RAMP and looking at the posting above from the main admin Orange, it’s\nhard to ignore numerous references that are made: From the names chosen, to the avatar of\nOrange’s profile, which happens to be a picture of a legitimate cyber threat intelligence\nprofessional.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Orange_\n\n_Hello, friends!

We’re in_\n\n### RAMP Ransom Anon Mark[et] Place\n\nRAMP was created in July 2021 by a threat actor TetyaSluha, who later changed their\nmoniker to ‘Orange.’ This actor claimed the forum would specifically cater to other\nransomware-related threat actors after they were ousted from major cybercrime forums for\nbeing too toxic, following the high-profile ransomware attacks against the Colonial Pipeline\nand Washington D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department in the spring of 2021.\n\nAt the time of the initial launch, Orange claimed the forum’s name was a tribute to a nowdefunct Russian-language underground drug marketplace, “Russian Anonymous\nMarketplace,” which was taken down by Russian law enforcement agencies in 2017. The relaunched cybercrime forum’s name now supposedly stands for “Ransom Anon Mark[et]\nPlace”.\n\nThe forum was initially launched on the same TOR-based resource that previously hosted a\nname-and-shame blog operated by the Babuk ransomware gang and the Payload.bin\nmarketplace of leaked corporate data. The forum was later moved to a dedicated TORbased resource and relaunched with a new layout and a revamped administrative team,\nwhere Orange acted as the admin, with other known actors MRT, 999 and KAJIT serving as\nmoderators.\n\n### Why the name Orange?\n\nWhy the admin changed handles from TetyaSluha to Orange isn’t 100 percent clear.\nHowever, looking back, the early days of RAMP provides us some evidence on who this\nperson has been affiliated with. We found a posting from where the names Orange and\nDarkside are mentioned as potential monikers. Very shortly after that, TetyaSluha changed\ntheir handle to Orange. While the initial message has been removed from the forum itself,\nthe content was saved thanks to Intel 471.\n\n\n-----\n\n_July 12 2021 by Mnemo_\n\n_Congratulations on the successful beginning of struggle for the right to choose and not_\n_to be evicted. I hope, the community will soon fill with reasonable individuals._\n\n_Oh yeah, you’ve unexpectedly reminded everyone about the wonderful RAMP forum._\n_Are the handles Orange and Darkside still free?_\n\nThe name Darkside might sound more familiar than Orange but, as we saw with the naming\nof RAMP, TetyaSluha is one for cybercrime sentiment, so there is almost certainly some\nhidden meaning behind it.\n\nBased on ATR’s previous research, we believe the name Orange was chosen as a\ntribute to REvil/GandCrab. People familiar with those campaigns have likely heard of the\n[actor ‘UNKN’. However, there was a less well known REvil affiliate admin named Orange. A](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-atr-analyzes-sodinokibi-aka-revil-ransomware-as-a-service-the-all-stars/)\ntribute seems fitting if Tetyasluha isn’t the notorious Orange as that moniker is tied to\nsome successful ransomware families, GandCrab and REvil, that shaped the RaaS\necosystem as we know it today.\n\nIn the past, UNKN was [linked to several other monikers, however Orange was hardly](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/05/this-service-helps-malware-authors-fix-flaws-in-their-code/)\nmentioned since there wasn’t a matching public handle used on any particular cybercrime\nforum. However, REvil insiders will recognize the name Orange as one of their admins.\n\nBased on ATR’s closed-source underground research, we believe with a high level of\nconfidence, that UNKN was indeed linked to the aforementioned accounts, as well as the\ninfamous “Crab”handle used by GandCrab. Crab was one of the two affiliate-facing accounts\nthat the GandCrab team had (The other being Funnycrab). We believe with a high level of\nconfidence that after the closure of GandCrab, the individual behind the Funnycrab account\nchanged to the account name to Orange and continued operations with REvil, with only a\n[subset of skilled GandCrab affiliates, (as described in our Virus Bulletin 2019 whitepaper)](https://www.virusbulletin.com/blog/2019/11/vb2019-paper-different-ways-cook-crab-gandcrab-ransomware-service-raas-analysed-depth/)\nsince GandCrab grew too big and needed to shed some weight.\n\nThe posting in figure 5 is also shedding some light on the start of the Groove Gang, their\nrelationship to Babuk and, subsequently, BlackMatter.\n\n## Groove Gang\n\nIn the post from Figure 5, “Orange” also claims to have always had a small group of people\nthat the group collaborates with. Additionally, the actor claims that the name has not been\nmentioned in the media before, comparing the group to the Israeli secret service group\nMossad. The group’s comparison to Mossad is extremely doubtful at best, given the drama\nthat has publicly played out. Groove claims several of Babuk’s victims, including the\nMetropolitan Police Department, brought them a lot of attention. The several mentions to\n\n\n-----\n\nBabuk isn t by mistake: we have evidence the two groups also have connections, which\nwe’ve pieced together from examining the behavior of — and particularly the fallout between\n— the two groups.\n\n### Babuk’s Fallout\n\nOriginally, the Babuk gang paid affiliates by each victim they attacked. Yet on April 30, it was\n[reported that the gang suddenly had stopped working with affiliates, including the act of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-quits-ransomware-encryption-focuses-on-data-theft-extortion/)\nencrypting a victim’s system. Instead, their focus shifted to data exfiltration and extortion of\n[targeted organizations. That was followed by the group releasing the builder for the old](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-ransomware-is-back-uses-new-version-on-corporate-networks/)\nversions of its ransomware as it pivoted to a new one for themselves.\n\nThe attention that Babuk drew by hacking and extorting the Metropolitan Police Department\nmeant their brand name became widely known. It also meant that more firms and agencies\nwere interested in finding out who was behind it. This kind of heat is unwanted by most\ngangs, as any loose ends that are out there can come back to bite them.\n\nThen, on September 3, the threat actor with the handle ‘dyadka0220’ stated that they were\nthe principal developer of Babuk ransomware and posted what they claimed was the Babuk\nransomware source code. They claimed the reason they were sharing everything was due to\nbeing terminally ill with lung cancer.\n\nFigure 6. Dyadka0220 was possibly the developer that Orange hinted at in the posting\n(Figure 5) mentioned above.\n\n**Figure 6. Dyadka0220 was possibly the developer that Orange hinted at in the posting**\n**(Figure 5) mentioned above.**\nOn September 7, the Groove gang responded with a blog on their own website, titled\n“Thoughts about the meaning”, which rhymes in Russian. In this blog, the gang (allegedly)\nprovides information on several recent happenings. Per their statement, the illness of\n‘dyadka0220’ is a lie. Additionally, their response alleges that the Groove gang never created\nthe Babuk ransomware themselves, but worked with someone else to produce it.\n\nThe validity of the claims in Groove’s latest blog is hard to determine, although this does not\nmatter too much: the Babuk group, including affiliates, had a fallout that caused the group to\nbreak up, causing the retaliation of several (ex-)members.\n\n### Observed Behavior\n\n[The ATR team has covered Babuk multiple times. The first blog, published last February,](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/babuk-ransomware/)\ncovers the initial observations of the group’s malware. The [second blog, published last July,](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/babuk-biting-off-more-than-they-could-chew-by-aiming-to-encrypt-vm-and-nix-systems/)\ndives into the ESXi version of the ransomware and its issues. The group’s tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) are in-line with commonly observed techniques from\nransomware actors. The deployment of dual-use tools, which can be used for both benign\n\n\n-----\n\nand malicious purposes, is difficult to defend against, as intent is an unknown term for a\nmachine. Together with other vendors we have narrowed down some of the TTPs observed\nby the Groove gang.\n\n### Initial Access\n\nThe actor needs to get a foothold within the targeted environment. The access can be\nbought, in terms of stolen (yet valid) credentials, or direct access in the form of a live\nbackdoor on one or more of the victim’s systems. Alternatively, the actor can exploit publicly\nfacing infrastructure using a known or unknown exploit. To ATR’s understanding, the latter\nhas been used several times by exploiting vulnerable VPN servers.\n\n### Lateral Movement, Discovery and Privilege Escalation\n\nMoving around within the network is an important step for the actor, for two reasons. Firstly, it\nallows the attacker to find as much data as possible, which is then exfiltrated. Secondly,\naccess to all machines is required in order to deploy the ransomware at a later stage. By\nencrypting numerous devices at once, it becomes even harder to control the damage from a\n[defender’s point of view. The actor uses commonly known tools, such as Ad-Find and](https://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/)\n[NetScan, to gather information on the network. Based on the gathered information, the actor](https://www.netscantools.com/index.html)\nwill move laterally through the network. One of the most frequently observed methods by this\nactor to do so, is by using RDP.\n\nTo work with more than user-level privileges, the actor has a variety of options to escalate\ntheir privilege to a domain administrator. Brute forcing RDP accounts, the dumping of\ncredentials, and the use of legacy exploits such as EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144), are ways\nto quickly obtain access to one or more privileged accounts. Once access to these systems\nis established, the next phase of the attack begins.\n\n### Data Exfiltration and Ransomware Deployment\n\nThe actor navigates through the machines on the network using the earlier obtained access.\n[To exfiltrate the collected data, the attacker uses WinSCP. Note that other, similar, tools can](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)\nalso be used. Once all relevant data has been stolen, the attacker will execute the\nransomware in bulk. This can be done in a variety of ways, ranging from manually starting\n[the ransomware on the targeted machines, scheduling a task per machine, or using PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)\nto launch the ransomware.\n\n## Linking Groove to Babuk and BlackMatter\n\nAs discussed above, there was a fallout within Babuk. From that fallout, a part of the group\nstayed together to form Groove. The server that Babuk used, which we will refer to as the\n“wyyad” server due to the ending of the onion URL, rebranded in late August 2021. The\nsimilarities can be seen in the two screenshots below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. The changes to the landing page from Babuk to Groove\n\nFigure 8. The changes to the landing page from Babuk to Groove\n\n**Figure 8. The changes to the landing page from Babuk to Groove**\nAside from this, data from old Babuk victims is still hosted on this server. The ATR team\nfound, among others, leaks that belong to:\n\na major US sports team,\na British IT service provider,\nan Italian pharmaceutical company,\na major US police department,\na US based interior shop.\n\nAll these victims have previously been claimed by (and attributed to) Babuk.\n\nAnother gang, known as BlackMatter, uses a variety of locations to host their extorted files,\nwhich can be done out of convenience or to avoid a single notice and takedown to remove all\noffending files. Additionally, the ATR team assumes, with medium confidence, that different\naffiliates use different hosting locations.\n\nThe data of one of the BlackMatter gang’s victims, a Thai IT service provider, is stored on the\n“wyyad” server. As such, it can mean that the Groove gang worked as an affiliate for the\nBlackMatter gang. This is in line with their claim to work with anybody, as long as they profit\nfrom it. The image below shows the BlackMatter leak website linking to the “wyyad” server.\n\nFigure 9. screenshot of BlackMatter, where the data is stored on the Groove server\n\n**Figure 9. screenshot of BlackMatter, where the data is stored on the Groove server**\nThe Groove gang’s website contains, at the time of writing, a single leak: data from a\nGerman printing company. Even though the website is accessible via a different address, the\nleaked data is stored on the “wyyad” server.\n\nFigure 10. Another Groove victim but stored on their own page\n\n**Figure 10. Another Groove victim but stored on their own page**\nThe affected company does not meet BlackMatter’s “requirements,” the group has said it\nonly goes after companies that make more than $US 100 million. This company’s annual\nrevenue is estimated at $US 75 million, as seen in the below screenshot.\n\nFigure 11. Posting on the Exploit forum by BlackMatter\n\n**Figure 11. Posting on the Exploit forum by BlackMatter**\nAt the end of Orange’s announcement comes a call to action and collaboration: “GROOVE is\nfirst and foremost an aggressive financially motivated criminal organization dealing in\nindustrial espionage for about two years. RANSOMWARE is no more than an additional\n\n\n-----\n\nsource of income. We don t care who we work with and how. You ve got money? We re in .\n\nThe group’s primary goal, making money, is not limited to ransomware. Inversely,\nransomware would be the cherry on top. This is yet another indication of the ransomware\ngroup’s shift to a less hierarchical set-up and a more fluid and opportunistic network-based\nway of working.\n\nIn the Groove gang’s blog on September 7, a reference is made with regards to BlackMatter,\nand its links to DarkSide. If true, these insights show that the Groove gang has insider\nknowledge of the BlackMatter gang. This makes the collaboration between Groove and\nBlackMatter more likely. If these claims are false, it makes one wonder as to why the Groove\ngang felt the need to talk about other gangs, since they seem to want to make a name for\nthemselves.\n\nDue to the above outlined actions ATR believes, with high confidence, that the Groove gang\nis a former affiliate or subgroup of the Babuk gang, who are willing to collaborate with other\nparties, as long as there is financial gain for them. Thus, an affiliation with the BlackMatter\ngang is likely.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEver since Ransomware-as-a-Service became a viable, and highly profitable, business\nmodel for cybercriminals, it has operated in much the same way with affiliates being the\nsometimes underpaid workhorses at the bottom of a rigid pyramid shaped hierarchy.\n\nFor some affiliates there was an opportunity to become competent cybercriminals while, for\nmany others, the lack of recompense and appreciation for their efforts led to ill-feeling.\nCombined with underground forums banning ransomware actors, this created the perfect\nopportunity for the threat actor known as Orange to emerge, with the Groove gang in tow,\nwith the offer of new ways of working where an associate’s worth was based entirely on their\nability to earn money.\n\nTime will tell if this approach enhances the reputation of the Groove gang to the level of the\ncybercriminals they seem to admire. One thing is clear though; with the manifestation of\nmore self-reliant cybercrime groups the power balance within the RaaS eco-climate will\nchange from he who controls the ransomware to he who controls the victim’s networks.\n\n### MITRE TTPs\n\nWe have compiled a list of TTPs based on older Babuk cases and some recent cases linked\nto Groove:\n\nT1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application (VPN services)\nT1003: OS Credential Dumping\n002: Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts\n\n\n-----\n\nT1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter\nT1021:002: SMB/Windows Admin Shares\nT1210: Exploitation of Remote Services\nT1087: Account Discovery\nT1482: Domain Trust Discovery\nT1562: Impair Defense\nT1537: Transfer Data to Cloud Account\nT1567: Exfiltration Over Web Service\n\nIf a partnership is achieved with a Ransomware family:\n\nT1486 Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n\n-----",
