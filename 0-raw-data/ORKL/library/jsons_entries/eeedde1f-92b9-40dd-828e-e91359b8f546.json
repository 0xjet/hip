    "plain_text": "# Despite arrests in Spain, FluBot operations explode across Europe and Japan\n\n**[therecord.media/despite-arrests-in-spain-flubot-operations-explode-across-europe-and-japan/](https://therecord.media/despite-arrests-in-spain-flubot-operations-explode-across-europe-and-japan/)**\n\nApril 26, 2021\n\nCyber-security agencies in Germany and the UK warned the general public this month about\na spike in SMS spam messages spreading the FluBot Android malware.\n\n[In security alerts published by Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Service-Navi/Presse/Alle-Meldungen-News/Meldungen/Smishing_SMS-Phishing_090421.html)\nthe [UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the two agencies said that malware gangs](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/flubot-guidance-for-text-message-scam)\nare sending malicious links to users via SMS posing as legitimate package delivery services.\n\nIf users click the links, they are taken to a website posing as DHL or FedEx, where they are\ntold to install an app to track a parcel meant to be delivered at their location.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut BSI and NCSC officials say the apps are loaded with a new form of Android malware\nknown as [FluBot,](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodaft/malware-ioc/master/FluBot/FluBot.pdf) [Cabassous, or the](https://medium.com/csis-techblog/the-brief-glory-of-cabassous-flubot-a-private-android-banking-botnet-bc2ed7917027) [FedEx Banker.](https://hispasec.com/resources/FedexBanker.pdf)\n\nFirst seen at the end of last year, this malware has slowly become one of the most active\noperations in the Android cybercrime ecosystem.\n\nCategorized as a classic Android banking trojan, the malware operates by relying on users\ndownloading boobytrapped apps from the internet and then side-loading them on their\ndevices, despite repeated security warnings from the Android OS.\n\nOnce a device is infected, the app uses the Android Accessibility service to overlay fake\nlogin screens on top of official apps and collect users’ credentials, which it then sends to a\nremote command and control server.\n\nThe FluBot operators then use the collected credentials to access banking apps and empty\naccounts. Since the FluBot operators have full control over an infected device, they can also\neasily bypass any SMS-based two-step verification process.\n\n## One FluBot distributor gang arrested in Spain\n\nCurrently, the malware is advertised on underground cybercrime forums, where miscreants\nrent it and then distribute it to users across the world.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn fact, the first time we heard about this malware is after one of these FluBot distributor\ngroups launched a massive SMS spam campaign that targeted Spanish users and infected\nmore than 60,000 devices.\n\n[But while Spanish authorities reacted promptly and arrested four suspects believed to have](https://therecord.media/flubot-malware-gang-arrested-in-barcelona/)\nbeen involved with this campaign, other groups renting the FluBot malware are still at large\nand appear to have launched their own operations targeting German and UK users as well.\n\nNow, in an attempt to avoid similar incidents like the one in Spain, where the malware made\ntens of thousands of victims in the span of a few weeks, German and UK cybersecurity\nofficials are trying to raise awareness of this new threat before it is too late.\n\n## Expansion beyond Spain, Germany, and the UK in the works\n\nHowever, more cybersecurity agencies might soon need to warn their own users as well.\n\nNew intelligence shared this week suggests that FluBot distributors have already expanded\noperations and have launched SMS spam campaigns targeting users in other countries,\nincluding Japan, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Poland, and the Netherlands.\n\n[#Cabassous](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cabassous?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [(#FluBot) actors are heavily developing new overlay targets and also](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FluBot?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nperforming an environmental checks (av) before it executing the banker payload.\nInteresting new countries and developments coming from this private group in such a\n[short period of time. pic.twitter.com/0pWXHaMa1j](https://t.co/0pWXHaMa1j)\n\n[— ThreatFabric (@ThreatFabric) April 26, 2021](https://twitter.com/ThreatFabric/status/1386663113525800962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[First time to see a Japanese flavor version of #FluBot.](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FluBot?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nFYI [@papa_anniekey](https://twitter.com/papa_anniekey?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@bl4ckh0l3z](https://twitter.com/bl4ckh0l3z?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [https://t.co/ujgxoBEDee](https://t.co/ujgxoBEDee) [pic.twitter.com/5qfBr7BQdj](https://t.co/5qfBr7BQdj)\n\n[— にのせき (@ninoseki) April 26, 2021](https://twitter.com/ninoseki/status/1386586854531633153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nTags\n\n[Android](https://therecord.media/tag/android/)\n[Android malware](https://therecord.media/tag/android-malware/)\n[Cabassous](https://therecord.media/tag/cabassous/)\n[DHL](https://therecord.media/tag/dhl/)\n[Europe](https://therecord.media/tag/europe/)\n[FedEx](https://therecord.media/tag/fedex/)\n[FluBot](https://therecord.media/tag/flubot/)\n[Germany](https://therecord.media/tag/germany/)\n[Japan](https://therecord.media/tag/japan/)\n[malware](https://therecord.media/tag/malware/)\n[NCSC](https://therecord.media/tag/ncsc/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[smartphone](https://therecord.media/tag/smartphone/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
