Between 2004 and 2011, a person using\nthe email address jeno_1980@hotmail.com registered several domains using the names \"Tawnya Grilth\" and \"Eric Charles\". Curiously, all of\nthe \"Tawnya Grilth\" domains showed the registrant's physical address to be a post office box in the fictional/misspelled town of \"Sin Digoo\",\nCalifornia.\n\n_Figure 1. Characteristics of domains registered by jeno_1980@hotmail.com._\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, jeno_1980@hotmail.com registered a number of domains under the \"Tawnya Grilth\" alias that have appeared repeatedly on\n\nreports published by various automated malware analysis systems and antivirus websites. The Dell SecureWorks CTU[SM] research team examined malware samples using these domains and concluded that these domains were involved in a larger pattern of malware-based espionage, sometimes referred to as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activity.\n\n## Espionage malware\n\nThere are two primary malware families involved with the Sin Digoo domains. One is known as \"Enfal\", which is short for \"EtenFalcon\", a\nstring found inside early samples. The involvement of actors using this malware for espionage was first detailed in 2010 in a joint report by the\nInformation Warfare Monitor and the Shadowserver Foundation. The report, titled \"Shadows in the Cloud: Investigating Cyber Espionage\n[2.0,\" was a continuation of research from an earlier report titled \"Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network.\" A later report](http://www.nartv.org/mirror/ghostnet.pdf)\n[by antivirus firm Trend Micro titled \"The LURID Downloader\" further details a campaign of espionage by this malware against targets world-](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_dissecting-lurid-apt.pdf)\nwide.\n\n_Figure 2. Sin Digoo connection to Enfal malware._\n\nA second family of malware connecting to the \"Tawnya Grilth\" domains is less well-known, although a couple of antivirus companies have\nused the names \"RegSubsDat\", \"RegSubDat\" or \"Kirpich\" to refer to it. A recent variant was described by the information security firm CyberESI in a 2011 blog post titled \"India-United States Naval Cooperation.doc Analysis.\" Details regarding the earlier variant used in the Sin Digoo\n[activity was first analyzed in a blog posting by Don C. Weber titled \"Malware Characteristics Report - Trojan.RegSubsDat.A\" on his Security](http://www.cutawaysecurity.com/blog/archives/593)\nRipcord blog.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Sin Digoo connection to RegSubsDat malware_\n\nAlthough windowsaupdate.com is not a \"Tawnya Grilth\" domain according to the WHOIS data, the name is almost certainly related to the domain windowsaupdate.net, especially given the same subdomain naming pattern (e.g., v4, v12, v14).\n\n## Victim discovery\n\nCTU analysts sinkholed a number of the \"Tawnya Grilth\" domains in 2011 and 2012. Traffic from infected victim computers is now sent to\nservers that log connections, gather statistics, and notify victims when possible. The initial findings from the sinkholing activity are:\n\n1. Between 100 and 200 computers located in Vietnam, Brunei, and Myanmar are infected by RegSubsDat. Analysis of the IP addresses con\nnecting to the sinkhole show that many are government ministries. Additionally, more than one regional petroleum company and a\nnewspaper has been infected.\n2. A handful of victim computers in Europe and the Middle East are infected by RegSubsDat, Enfal, and one other unknown trojan. These\n\ncomputers belong to government ministries in different countries, an embassy, a nuclear safety agency, and other business-related\ngroups. Additionally, there is an embassy located inside mainland China that is infected.\n\nThe CTU researchers have notified many of the national computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) in the countries where infections\nwere detected and are continuing this notification process. The notifications include the necessary information to locate victims within the\ncountry, inform the victims, and mitigate the infections.\n\n## Link to RSA breach\n\n[In addition to the GhostNet link, connections can also be drawn between the malware used in the Sin Digoo activity and the RSA breach re-](http://www.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=3872)\n[vealed in early 2011. According to the US-CERT EWIN-11-077 bulletin, a number of command-and-control (C2) hostnames used by RegSubs-](http://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/alerts/2011/alert-2011-4.html)\nDat shared three different IP addresses at different points in time, with one of the hostnames known to be part of the RSA breach. This C2\n[hostname was used in a piece of malware known as \"Murcy\", which was detailed in \"Command and Control in the Fifth Domain,\" a 2012 re-](http://www.commandfive.com/papers/C5_APT_C2InTheFifthDomain.pdf)\nport by Command Five Pty Ltd.\n\n_Figure 4. Connection between the RegSubsDat malware and the Murcy malware._\n\nAll three IP addresses belong to the China Beijing Province Network (AS4808). Although the RegSubsDat and Murcy C2s shared these IPs a\nfew months apart, the fact that three IP different addresses at the same ISP overlapped in a short time frame seems to indicate shared infrastructure used by both the RSA breach actors and other actors using the RegSubsDat malware. AS4808 is known for many other connections to\nmalware and is considered by some to be a hotbed of espionage C2s, especially the 123.120.96.0/19, 114.248.80.0/20 and 114.248.96.0/20 subnets. These subnets have been seen in DNS records for hundreds of C2 hostnames for dozens of custom malware families, either known for or\n\n\n-----\n\ng g y g g p g\nposting by \"Cyb3rsleuth\" traced this email address to a social media profile created by a person living in Beijing named \"Wang Liang Chen.\"\nThe same email address was used to register many other RegSubsDat domains as well. The social media profile for king_public@hotmail.com\nhas since been deleted.\n\n## Tracking Tawnya\n\nThe same type of open-source intelligence can be used to gather information about the jeno_1980@hotmail.com actor. One domain registered\nby jeno_1980@hotmail.com is \"socialup.net\". This site describes a \"like exchange,\" which is a service that Internet marketers can use to promote\na story on social media sites like Digg or Reddit.\n\n_Figure 5. Screenshot of the socialup.net interface._\n\nThis type of service falls under the category of \"blackhat SEO,\" a term for a variety of techniques for manipulating search engines and social\nmedia sites for marketing purposes. These methods are considered \"blackhat\" because they usually lead to a site or user being banned from\nthe search engine or social media sites if the manipulation is discovered.\n\nThe socialup.net website has been repeatedly promoted on blackhat SEO message boards by various personas, including one named\n\"Tawnya\".\n\n_Figure 6. Example of \"Tawnya\" promoting socialup.net._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Example of interface to purchase coins._\n\nAs part of the PayPal transaction, the potential customer can see the payee email address. In the case of socialup.net, PayPal's website shows\nthat the payment for the socialup.net coins is sent to an individual with the initials jzd.\n\n_Figure 8. Order summary for coins showing payee information._\n\nOne of the other \"Tawnya Grilth\" domains is \"i-tobuy.com\". This domain was registered in 2004 using the jeno_1980@hotmail.com email address and \"Sin Digoo\" location, but the nickname \"xxgchappy\" is also shown in the registrant contact data.\n\n_Figure 9. Registrant contact data for i-tobuy.com._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Registrant contact data for 1stsale.net._\n\nThere is a profile on a Chinese programmers' forum for an \"xxgchappy\" user who has posted two different email addresses in different messages on the site. These addresses are xxgchappy@vip.sina.com and      @sina.com.cn (address redacted). The user's name is listed on the forum's profile page for \"xxgchappy\" and contains the initials ZD.\n\n_Figure 11. Profile for xxgchappy._\n\n_Figure 12. Tracing the connections between socialup.net, i-tobuy.com, and 1stsale.net._\n\nSeveral clues on the Internet point to xxgchappy, or ZD, having a working knowledge of computer programming. The use of the programmers' forum, along with postings to that site, indicates he is interested in code related to hooking Windows API functions, a common technique used in malware. Additionally, both xxgchappy@vip.sina.com and king_public@hotmail.com were the listed email addresses for users\nof the \"rootkit.com\" site, revealed when that site's database was leaked in 2011.\n\nA \"rootkit\" is a program used for hiding traces of malware on a system, and rootkit.com was a forum for discussing the latest rootkit technolo\n\n-----\n\nThe nickname \"Jeno\" appears again in the rookit.com user database entry for the user with the email address xxgchappy@vip.sina.com.\n\n(7523,'Jeno','91cec994','Jeno Alix','xxgchappy@vip.sina.com',1,0,\n'','','','','','',0,'http://www.rootkit.com/usericons/Jeno.jpg',''\n,1265784473,'123.6.89.98',0,0,0,1265721022,0,0,0,'','0','','','',-1,''),\n\n(23025,'king-rose','e211f11c0b28434bf7f1c8fb510fa9ae','Club-tom',\n'king_public@hotmail.com',1,1106582903,'','','','','','',0,'',''\n,1106837367,'61.51.59.63',0,0,0,1106583113,0,0,0,'BH','19800126',\n'','','',0,''),\n\n_Figure 13. Database entries with the xxgchappy and king_public email addresses._\n\nIn the entry for king_public@hotmail.com, we see the nicknames \"king-rose\" and \"Club-tom\", but even more interesting is the password hash\n\"e211f11c0b28434bf7f1c8fb510fa9ae\". This password hash appears in only one other entry in the rootkit.com database:\n\n(20446,'king-z','e211f11c0b28434bf7f1c8fb510fa9ae','k,z,y',\n'wzy_100@hotmail.com',1,1097652186,'','','','','','',0,'','',1284013010,\n'123.120.127.153',0,0,0,1284013010,0,0,0,'','','','','',0,''),\n\n_Figure 14. Other appearance of the password hash associated with king_public@hotmail.com._\n\nFrom this evidence, we can deduce that \"king-z\" is a second, earlier account of king_public@hotmail.com, created using the wzy_100@hotmail.com email address. Even more interesting is the 123.120.127.153 IP address the king-z account used to log in. This IP is located inside one\nof the AS4808 netblocks famous for espionage activity. In fact, it is remarkably close to 123.120.127.159, an IP used by Enfal C2 v2.windowsaupdate.net (one of the \"Tawnya Grilth\" domains) on September 27, 2010. The last account activity for king-z as shown in the rootkit.com\ndatabase is September 9, 2010. This data strongly suggests that king_public@hotmail.com is not just a stolen account used to register a domain,\nbut that the user is involved in the espionage network in some manner.\n\nThe password used by xxgchappy@vip.sina.com does not appear elsewhere in the leaked rootkit.com database; however, another leaked database may provide additional clues surrounding the xxgchappy personality.\n\nThe    @sina.com.cn (address redacted) email address associated with the user xxgchappy can be found inside an archive posted to the\n\"hackchina.com\" website.\n\nxxgchappy # 2710 #         @sina.com.cn\n\n_Figure 15. xxgchappy reference from the hackchina.com website._\n\nThe archive contains a denial-of-service attack tool called \"lankiller\". Inside the lankiller binary is the following comment:\n\nDesigned for lyh by xxgc-happy  2002.3.8\n\n_Figure 16. Reference to xxgc-happy in the lankiller tool._\n\nAlso included in the lankiller archive is a README file that describes the use of the tool. It asks the user to email the author at either\n@sina.com.cn or happy@sohu.com.cn.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17. Email addresses referenced in the lankiller README file._\n\nThere is a profile for \"happy\" on a Chinese video site showing a possible photo of the user. The photo is of a man who appears to be in his early twenties and of Asian descent.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Sin Digoo activity is only a limited view into a very large amount of espionage-by-malware that is happening in the world. The Enfal,\nRegSubsDat, and Murcy malware families possess dozens of defunct and active C2s, and these three trojans are only a tiny subset of the malware families the Dell SecureWorks CTU research team knows to be involved in espionage activity. Collaboration between government, espionage malware victims, and the computer security industry must improve to better defend against this undercurrent of activity that threatens\nto undermine an already weakened economy in countries around the world.\n\n## Appendix A – Network IDS signatures\n\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> any any (msg:\"Enfal Trojan Activity\"; flow:established,to_server;
