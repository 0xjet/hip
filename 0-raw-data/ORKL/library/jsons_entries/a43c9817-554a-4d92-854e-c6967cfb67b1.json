Like Cerber and Satan,\nShurL0ckr’s operators further monetize the ransomware by peddling it as a turnkey service\nto fellow cybercriminals, allowing them to earn additional income through a commission from\neach victim who pays the ransom.\n\nThe researchers’ analysis of ShurL0ckr indicates it can evade detection by cloud applications\nwhere it’s reported to proliferate. Like other ransomware, phishing and drive-by downloads\nare their likeliest infection vectors.\n\nShurL0ckr’s discovery was part of a larger problem: cybercriminals abusing legitimate\nplatforms and services. The researchers noted that 44% of businesses using cloud\napplications were in some way affected by malware. In fact, they found at least three\nenterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications infected with malware. The researchers\nalso found malicious scripts and executables, as well as Trojanized Office documents and\nimage files, to be the most commonly used entry point.\n\n**[RELATED NEWS:** **Security Flaw in Google Apps Script can Let Hackers Deliver**\n**Malware via SaaS Platform]**\n\nIndeed, ransomware isn’t going away any time soon.
