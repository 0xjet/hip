It’s a TA505 HTML malspam analysis\n\n**[hornetsecurity.com/en/security-information/clop-clop-ta505-html-malspam-analysis/](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/security-information/clop-clop-ta505-html-malspam-analysis/)**\n\nSecurity Lab July 7, 2020\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this article Hornetsecurity’s Security Lab outlines one of the current infection chains by the\n[operators behind the Clop ransomware. The outlined infection chain starts from an email with](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/knowledge-base/ransomware/)\na malicious HTML attachment. This attachment redirects the victim to an XLS document\n[containing the Get2 loader. This loader then installs a remote access trojan (RAT) on the](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/knowledge-base/trojan/)\nsystem, which is used to prepare the victims network for the deployment of the Clop\n[ransomware. The goal of the attack is to encrypt as many systems in the victims organization](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/knowledge-base/cryptography/)\nas possible in order to extort the highest possible ransom. To this end, the attackers also\nthreaten to publish stolen data if the ransom is not paid.\n\n## Background\n\nThis article is about the threat activity with TTPs and indicators aligning with threat activities\ntracked by other vendors as TA505 (Proofpoint), SectorJ04 (NSHC Singapore), GRACEFUL\nSPIDER (Crowdstrike), GOLD TAHOE (Securework), and Dudear (Microsoft).\n\nThis threat group has been active since at least 2014. They are financially motivated. They\nare known for using:\n\n\n-----\n\nQuant (2018), Marap (2018), Amadey (2019), AndroMut (2019), and Get2 (2019-today)\nloader\nFlawedAmmyy (2016-today), FlawedGrace (2019-today), ServHelper (2019-today),\nSDBbot (2019-today) RAT\nBart (2016), Locky (2016-2020), Jaff (2017), and Clop (2019-today) ransomware\n\nThey also use:\n\nDridex (2014-today)\nTrickBot (2017-today)\nNercus (now defunct) and Neutrino botnets\n\nThese are, however, also widely used by other threat groups, hence, these are not robust\nindicators for attribution.\n\nTA505 further use additional commonly available malware such as TinyMet, a tiny open\nsource meterpreter stager [TinyMet]. From 2016 to 2019 they have also misused the\nlegitimate software Remote Manipulator System (RMS) developed by the Russian company\nTektonIT for remote access.\n\nThe typical abstract TA505 infection chain is:\n\n1. Malspam dropping Get2.\n2. Get2 downloading SDBbot, FlawedGrace or FlawedAmmy RAT.\n3. Lateral movement in victim network.\n4. Main objective: Deploy Clop ransomware on maximum number of systems.\n\nWe will focus on one observed implementation of the infection chain as used by TA505 since\n2019. In this infection chain the initial malspam email has an HTML attachment. This HTML\nattachment redirects the victim to the download of an XLS document. This XLS document\nthen drops the Get2 loader which (in our observation) downloads SDBbot.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nSDBbot is used for reconnaissance and lateral movement in the victim’s network. When\ndeploying the Clop ransomware TA505 does not seem to care about encrypting computers of\nindividuals. Their intention is to mass encrypt computers of an entire organization. This is\npresumably done to increase leverage on the organization in order to increase the\ndemandable ransom amount as well as increase the pressure on the organization to pay the\nransom. The focus on large organizations is known as big-game-hunting. One example of a\nsuccessful TA505 attach was the attack on the Maastricht University. The university had 267\nWindows server’s data encrypted by the Clop ransomware. The university paid 30 BTC\nroughly $220,000 for a decryptor to get its data back.\n\nSince around 2020-03-24 TA505 has also started to leak stolen data from Clop ransomware\nvictims refusing to pay onto the Internet on their site called `CL0P^_- LEAKS . This is a`\nfurther attempt to increase pressure on the victims to pay the ransom.\n\nThe operational tempo is high. Malspam campaigns happen on a weekly basis. Download\nand C2 domains are rotated daily.\n\nWe now further analyze the observed outlined infection chain in more detail.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nBeing an email security provider we will focus on the initial email-based access vector of the\nattack and only briefly outline the aftermath taking place in case the initial email is received\nand opened by a victim.\n\n### Email\n\nThe emails are send from compromised email accounts. They therefore pass spam\n[reputation, DMARC, DKIM and SPF checks. The emails use signature blocks from previous](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/email-signature-and-email-disclaimer/)\ncompromised victims presumably to make the emails look more legitimate. We were able to\nconfirm these two facts for some of the emails. However, the compromised account is\n\n\n-----\n\ndifferent from the stolen signature block used in the emails. Only the display name in the\nemails from header is changed to the name used in the signature block. Some examples of\nsuch TA505 HTML malspam emails received within 1 week are as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe daily changing emails highlight the high operational tempo of TA505.\n\n### HTML attachment\n\nEach email has an HTML attachment. The HTML code will redirect victims to a compromised\nwebsite. Like the emails themselves the HTML attachments are also frequently changing. In\nthe week the previous outlined email templates were used we identified three distinct\nredirection techniques used in the HTML attachments.\n\nThe first uses the following Javascript redirect:\n\nNext, the HTML `<embed> tag was used:`\n\n\n-----\n\nThen the `<object> tag:`\n\nThe HTML attachments use hash busting via random strings. We were able to confirm this\nby finding several HTML attachment in which what appears to be placeholder marks were\nnot replaced with the random strings. In this example the `{{RND_TEXT}} was probably`\nsupposed to be replaced with a random string (as it was in the other HTML attachments):\n\nThe `{{RND_TEXT}} could be Jinja syntax. Jinja is a web template engine for the Python`\nprogramming language. It uses the `{{var}} syntax to mark placeholder locations in the`\nHTML template code that are then filled with the desired values upon instantiating HTML\ncode from the template.\n\nBesides changing the HTML redirect techniques and the URLs, the HTML attachments also\nmultiple times rearranged the HTML elements or added unused `<a> tags in order to avoid`\ndetection by static signatures.\n\n### Intermediate redirect\n\n\n-----\n\nThe HTML attachments either redirect to or embed HTML from a most likely compromised\nwebsite. This HTML code then further redirects the victim to another attacker controlled\ndomain:\n\nHow exactly TA505 acquires access to those intermediate redirect websites is not known.\nHowever, because they mostly feature only static content and no CMS web vulnerabilities\nare highly unlikely. As TA505 is known to steal FTP credentials this is a likely access vector.\n\n### XLS download domain\n\nNext, the intermediate redirects lead to domains registered by TA505. As the emails,\nattachments, and intermediate redirects, these domains also frequently change. The\ndomains observed over the course of 1 month is as follows:\n\nAs can be seen TA505 is registering fresh domains on a daily basis (during campaigns). This\nagain highlights their high operational tempo.\n\nThe following pattern can be observed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, Let s Encrypt certificates are acquired. The time at which the certificates for the above\noutlined domains were acquired can be seen in the following plot:\n\nNext, the HTML attachment malspam is send:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the malspam new domains for the next day are registered:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis, again, highlights the persistence and high operational tempo of TA505.\n\n### CAPTCHAs\n\nAs of 2020 the malicious XLS documents are protected via CAPTCHAs. The following are\nthe presented download screens. These were observed within only one week:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CAPTCHAs are likely used to hinder automated analysis by security companies. And\nagain, as before the used CAPTCHA service and layout of the download page changes\nfrequently.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the HTML code of one XLS download webpage we also found the `{{RND_TEXT}}`\nplaceholder string again:\n\nThis is, again, presumably used for hash busting.\n\n### XLS\n\nAfter the CAPTCHA has been solved, the victim downloads the TA505 XLS document. The\nnumber in the filename changes for every download. The document hash changes every\nminute. The changes are performed to the documents meta data such as title, subject and\nauthor but also the content of the document itself, as can be seen from comparing two XLS\ndocuments downloaded at different times:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$ diff <(exiftool Form\\ F 12189.xls) <(exiftool Form\\ F 44754.xls)\n2c2\n< File Name            : Form F-12189.xls\n--> File Name            : Form F-44754.xls\n4,5c4,5\n< File Size            : 816 kB\n< File Modification Date/Time   : 2020:06:25 15:13:02+02:00\n--> File Size            : 734 kB\n> File Modification Date/Time   : 2020:06:25 15:13:11+02:00\n7c7\n< File Inode Change Date/Time   : 2020:06:25 15:13:04+02:00\n--> File Inode Change Date/Time   : 2020:06:25 15:13:13+02:00\n14,16c14,16\n< Title              : Q\n< Subject             : U\n< Author             : gzh\n--> Title              : pfaE\n> Subject             : nudUSwT\n> Author             : k\n18c18\n< Revision Number         : 641\n--> Revision Number         : 458\n20c20\n< Total Edit Time         : 18.4 hours\n--> Total Edit Time         : 14.5 hours\n22c22\n< Modify Date           : 2020:06:25 07:55:19\n--> Modify Date           : 2020:06:25 07:57:12\n24,25c24,25\n< Words              : 2696\n< Characters           : 9575\n--> Words              : 2669\n> Characters           : 4214\n29,31c29,31\n< Bytes              : 28002\n< Lines              : 689\n< Paragraphs           : 75\n--> Bytes              : 75897\n> Lines              : 395\n> Paragraphs           : 15\n\n```\nThe changes are again based on random strings. The VBA project in the document stays the\nsame:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$ diff r Form\\ F 12189 Form\\ F 44754\nBinary files Form F-12189/[5]DocumentSummaryInformation and Form F44754/[5]DocumentSummaryInformation differ\nBinary files Form F-12189/[5]SummaryInformation and Form F44754/[5]SummaryInformation differ\nBinary files Form F-12189/Workbook and Form F-44754/Workbook differ\n\n```\nThe document features the typical instructions to “Enable Editing” and to “Enable Content”:\n\nIn case a victim does so, a fake “Microsoft Office Components” window appears:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe window is actually produced by the VBA macro code of the document itself:\n\nThe fake loading screen is likely deployed to prevent victims from closing the document too\nearly, i.e., before the embedded malware has completed running. This is important because\nthe Get2 loader will run within the `EXCEL.EXE process that opened the XLS document.`\nOnce that process is closed, so is this initial malware loader.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Get2 loader DLLs are embedded in the downloaded XLS document:\n```\n$ binwalk Form\\ F-12189/MBD007A19C2/\\[1\\]Ole10Native --dd=\".*\"\nDECIMAL    HEXADECIMAL   DESCRIPTION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------17513     0x4469     Microsoft executable, portable (PE)\n354857    0x56A29     Microsoft executable, portable (PE)\n\n```\nOne of the DLLs is 32-bit, the other 64-bit:\n```\n$ file *\n4469: PE32 executable (DLL) (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n56A29: PE32+ executable (DLL) (console) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\n```\nThe VBA macro code extracts the embedded object, and the embedded Get2 loader DLLs. It\nwrites them (first the 64-bit, then the 32-bit version) to\n```\n%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Templates\\libIntel{1,2}.dll . The code\n\n```\nthen uses `ExecuteExcel4Macro to call the` `libIntel{1,2}.dll, i.e. the Get2 loader.`\nThe called function is actually the path (in this case `vckpmd ) that should be queried from`\nthe C2:\n\nThe `ExecuteExcel4Macro function allows to execute arbitrary Excel 4 Macro statements.`\nIn this case, `CALL(\"C:\\Users\\...\\libIntel2.dll\",\"vckpmd\",\"J\"), which allows to`\nexecute code from the DLL directly from the `EXCEL.EXE process without having to spawn`\nan otherwise suspicious process.\n\nFirst, the 64-bit DLL is called, even in a 32-bit `EXCEL.EXE process. If that fails the 32-bit`\nversion is written to disk and called.\n\n### Get2 loader\n\nThe aforementioned `libIntel{1,2}.dll DLL is the Get2 Loader. Its purpose is to`\ndownload and execute additional TA505 malware. To this end, it first gathers some system\ninformation, then sends a POST request to the C2 server as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe parameters send to the C2 contain the follow data from the victim’s system:\n```\n   D : Hostname\n   U : Username\n   OS : Windows version\n   PR : List of running processes\n\n```\nThe C2 will then respond with URLs of the follow up malware to download.\n\n### SDBbot\n\nCurrently, the next stage malware of choice downloaded by TA505’s Get2 loader is SDBbot\n\n[SDBbot]. SDBbot is a RAT. This stage of the infection functions as a beachhead for lateral\nmovement and movement on objective, i.e., the deployment of the Clop ransomware. To this\nend, SDBbot is used to explore the infected network and load additional malware to prepare\nfor the deployment of the Clop ransomware. One of such preparations is the deactivation of\nendpoint security software before deploying the Clop ransomware.\n\n### Clop ransomware\n\n“Clop” pronounced in English sounds close to the Russian and/or Bulgarian word “клоп”,\nmeaning “bug”. Many believe this to be the origin of the name. The Clop ransomware is\nderived from the CryptoMix ransomware [CryptoMix]. It is the last stage of an TA505 attack.\nThe goal seems to be to deploy the Clop ransomware to as many systems within a victim\nnetwork as possible in order to put as much pressure on the victims to pay the ransom.\nEncryption usually happens on the weekend to reduce the risk of personal within the victim\ncompany noticing the encryption process and stopping the ransomware attack prematurely.\n\n\n-----\n\nAround 2020-03-24 TA505 has started to leak stolen data from victims refusing to pay the\nransom onto the Internet. To this end, they run a Tor hidden service website titled `CL0P^_-`\n```\nLEAKS :\n\n```\nAs of writing the site features 12 victims. This, again is used to further pressure the victims\ninto paying.\n\n## Conclusion and Countermeasure\n\nAs this article shows determined cybercriminals, such as TA505, put a large amount of effort\ninto their attacks. The daily consistency rotating domains and constantly updating their\npayloads to avoid detection clearly demonstrates that this is organized crime. The ruthless\nextortion of victims via public shaming further demonstrate the extend to which criminals will\ngo to make profit.\n\nAttacks as these can be defended against at multiple stages. As a last resort, solid backups\ncan allow a company to bootstrap themselves back from a ransomware attack without paying\nthe ransom. The general recommendation for backups follows the 3-2-1 rule [US-CERT]. 3\n\n\n-----\n\ndifferent copies, on 2 different mediums, at least 1 off-site, e.g., in the cloud. It is also\nadvised to practice restoring systems from backups, because a backup is only successful\nwhen the data has been restored, not when it has been backed up.\n\nFurther, blocking of C2 communication at any point during the infection chain can prevent the\ninfection from commencing to the next stage. To this end, webfilters can be used.\n\nLast but not least, blocking the initial email will obviously prevent the whole chain from\nunfolding in the first place. Hornetsecurity’s [Hosted Spam Filtering with the highest detection](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/spam-filter/)\nrates on the market can block the outlined malicious HTML attachments. Hornetsecurity’s\n[Advanced Threat Protection extends this protection by adding additional state of the art](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/advanced-threat-protection/)\nsecurity layers against yet unknown threats.\n\nEven though, in terms of business, paying the ransom may outbalance the costs that go\nalong with not paying the ransom, a ransom should not be paid. It finances the attackers,\nleading to more ransomware attacks. It will ensure the victim that paid will stay on the target\nlist. Afterall, these attackers are interested in financial gain and not destruction of companies,\nmeaning a victim that will not pay a ransom no matter what is not a good target. Obviously,\nthis does not mean that a company known to not paying ransoms will never fall victim to\nransomware again. It means attackers will likely not specifically target that specific company\nagain. Not paying a ransom and accepting a data leak is especially hard. However, there is\nno guarantee the leaked data will be deleted. Only the promise of criminals. The leaked data\ncould be sold in the underground economy, be used in future attacks, and even be used to\nextort the victim again at a later point in time. Last but not least, even without a public leak, a\ndata breach is still a data breach with all its legal ramifications, such as a data breach\nnotification and fines. Paying a ransom will not annul those.\n\n## References\n\n[TinyMet] [https://github.com/SherifEldeeb/TinyMet](https://github.com/SherifEldeeb/TinyMet)\n\n[SDBbot] [https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.sdbbot](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.sdbbot)\n\n[CryptoMix] [https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.cryptomix](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.cryptomix)\n\n[US-CERT] https://www.uscert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/data_backup_options.pdf\n\n\n-----",
