It came to my attention while looking at my twitter feed and spotting a tweet from @tkanalyst. I was not\n[aware of it, and as a malware analyst working at a sandbox company(tria.ge), I wanted immediately to analyze it and develop signatures. Also,](http://tria.ge/)\nI have not any background in Threat Intel or attribution, so the name was chosen due to @tkanalyst tweet.\nThe sample that was analyzed has the following information:\n\nMD5 HASH (Packed) : 126ed436b3531dd857b25b9da2c80462\nMD5 HASH (Unpacked): 3367E9FC3CDBE03D65460E5BF86EE16B\nRaccoon Version: 1.2\n\nGenerally, the sample is a typical infostealer malware. It checks for the existence of various types of applications such as browsers, email\nclients, coin wallets and attempts to steal their data by reading their configuration files or databases. The execution of the malware is closely\nrelated with the configuration that the CnC server will send, thus there is an obstacle during the dynamic analysis if the CnC domain is down.\nIn our case this was solved by writing a module in Fakenet-NG and emulating the responses of the CnC(Figure 1).\n\n**Figure 1**\n\n## Static Analysis\n\nWhile I am not that fond of malware written in C++ for obvious reasons, Raccoon was not that complicated - it does not have any ANTI methods, and its execution is straight forward. With the help of FLIRT signatures if correctly applied, the static analysis can become a lot\neasier. While spending some time doing static analysis, I noticed some patterns for string decryption. The majority of the strings are encrypted\nwith a combination of bitwise NOT/XOR (depending on the sample)(Figure 2,3). To make my life easier and to practice my IDApython skills, I\ncreated a script in order to search and decrypt these strings: [7]. Some main points from the script:\n\nIt has two major functions responsible for reading ASM instructions and gathering the data and decrypting it.\nIt is based on pre-defined regex for deciding whether there is potential encrypted data. There is often overlap between the addresses\nwhich is solved by checking the decrypted strings and deciding which one is valid.\n\n\n-----\n\nt s ea y easy to a dec ypted st g t at t s o g o as o e tte by a ot e patte you just ca o e o t e t o a a ab e\nfunctions having as a parameter the address of the instruction that one believes to move data needed for the decryption of the string.\n\n**Figure 2**\n\n**Figure 3**\n\n## Dynamic Analysis\n\nStarting to analyze the malware dynamically, the malware first checks for a mutex, in order to determine if an instance of it is already running.\nSpecifically, the mutex's name is a result of a string decryption and concatenation with the current user's name. If the mutex does not exist, it is\ncreated and the function returns 1, else it returns 0. (Figure 4)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4**\n\nImmediately after that, the malware check the privilege that is executed with. Specifically, with the help of the token is determined whether the\nprocess is run from Local System group. If that's the case, then a snapshot of running processes is acquired, and it will try to duplicate a\ntoken(with higher privileges) from another one in order to call CreateProcessWithTokenW API, restarting with higher privileges.(Figure 5)\n\n**Figure 5**\n\nAs it was mentioned in Cybereason's post[1], the malware checks the locale of the system against various other values such as: Russian,\n_Ukrainian, Belarussian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Armenian, Tajik, and Uzbek._\nIn order to continue the execution, the malware needs to get its JSON config. The CnC server serving the config does not exist inside the\nsample - instead, the sample dynamically acquires its CnC via another request. The samples firstly proceeds into decrypting a RC4 key\n(1@zFg08*@45) which is further used to decrypt a URL and sample's Config ID. (Figure 6)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6**\n\nThere are 2 hardcoded strings, encrypted with RC4 and encoded with base64 encoding .They also have multiple newline and space\ncharacters (probably to break static tool?). These strings are the URL of the first domain and the Config ID of the current sample. (Figure 7)\n\n**Figure 7**\n\nIn the current sample, a request is performed towards a drive.google.com url followed, by a lookup in the response headers in order to locate\ntwo substrings: '.txt\";filename*=UTF-8' and 'attachment;filename='(Figure 8,10). Their values are the RC4 encrypted CnC that is ought to\nrespond later with a valid JSON configuration. (Figure 9). It should be noted that, the key RC4 key for decrypting the CnC domain is different\nthan the one used before, but it is hardcoded in the sample (7effd829b15db71f1e5431670f17da25).\n\n**Figure 8**\n\n**Figure 9**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10**\n\nAfter that, it's time for the UUID of the infected workstation to be built. This is done by getting the machine GUID, user's name and the\npreviously encrypted config in the sample all together concentrated. The parameter is encoded with base64 encoding and a POST request is\nperformed to the previously decrypted CnC domain. (Figure 11, 12)\n\n**Figure 11**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 12**\n\nThe malware ensures that a response is valid by either checking for the existence of the string 'Wrong config id' or by the string 'url'. Also, if the\nresponse does not contain the 'Wrong config id' but somehow contains the string 'url', will later fail during the parsing of the configuration. (C++\nexceptions). (Figure 13)\n\n**Figure 13**\n\nIf the JSON config is valid, then the the value of 'url' json property is acquired. Also, a folder is created in TEMP with named 'TrashCan' which\nwas not used during execution. (Figure 14). It should be also noted that, all the file operations are performed via transactions, something that\nFumiko[5], another malware researcher has described in one of his blog posts.\n\n\n-----\n\n**gu e**\n\nAnother check of properties in the confiq occurs, for 'config' and 'mask'. If succesfull located the sample continues to create a string\n'C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\Log.zip' for future usage. Another property check happens, for 'attachment_url'. If it exists, its value will\nbe acquired, which in our case is a .dll. The malware will start preparing the ground to download and load the particular library.As it is common\nwith Raccoon, a string is decrypted in memory and in this case it is 'sqlite3.dll'. Later, a full TEMP path will be built in order to be used by\nUrlDownloadToFileA to download and save the file.( Figure 15)\n\n**Figure 15**\n\nThen it proceeds into checking the value of the 'history_is_enabled' property and begins its first stealing operation - loading the dropped\nsqlite3.dll library getting the data from Chrome-like browsers by searching in specific folders. This is done by iterating an array of structures\nwith size 18h, containing 4 offsets to various paths like Login Data, Cookies, Web Data and User Data for various browsers descendant of\nChrome. The index is saved in ESI register while accessing the various members of the structures holding the information about the browsers.\n(Figure 16, 17)\n\n**Figure 16**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 17**\n\nNext, the sample attempts to steal all the data associated with Internet Explorer. This is done by calling three different functions, each aimed at\nstealing different data such as auto complete information, http basic authentication passwords stored in credentials store and finally data from\nVault. The methods used here are known to the public and were detailed explained here[2]. (Figure 18)\n\n**Figure 18**\n\nLastly, another string is decrypted in memory 'libraries' and again its existence is checked against the response. If the property exists then the\nits value will be acquired resulting in a URL containing additional libraries. The sample will attempt to perform its next stealing operation\ntargeting Firefox - like browsers by downloading the additional libraries, loading them and resolving the needed APIs in order to steal the data.\nIt should be noted that, the path that the additional libraries were extracted is added as a value in the enviromental variable 'PATH'. (Figure 19)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 19**\nFirstly the malware checks if the \"C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\AdLibs\\\\nss3.dll\" (Figure 20 ) exists in disk and if not, it then\nproceeds into downloading the set of libraries to the path \"C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\AdLibs\\\\ff-funcs.zip\" and unzip the libraries\nat \"C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\AdLibs\\\\\". Finally, the 'nss3.dll' library will be loaded and the associated APIs will be resolved in\norder to be used in the next function (Figure 21). The malware attempts to steal History, Signons, cookies, places.sqlite by looping again\nagainst an array of structures holding information for Firefox-like browsers.\n\n**Figure 20**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 21**\n\nFinishing with the browsers, the sample proceeds into stealing email data associated with Outlook browser. This was covered by Cybereason's\nblogspot so we will proceed into the next stealing operation - taking data from FoxMail client. It is thourogly checks for the existence of( Figure\n22):\n\n1. D:\\\\Program Files\\\\Foxmail 7.2\\\\Storage\n2. D:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Foxmail 7.2\\\\Storage\n3. D:\\\\Foxmail 7.2\\\\Storage\n4. C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Foxmail 7.2\\\\Storage\n5. C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Foxmail 7.2\\\\Storage\n6. C:\\\\Foxmail 7.2\\\\Storage\n\nand collects all the relative data.\n\n**Figure 22**\n\nFinishing from stealing data from Email clients, next thing is to collect information from the infected workstation. The value of the 'IP' property is\nbeing parsed from the JSON response and then a function is responsible for gathering and writing to a file named 'machineinfo.txt' information.\nThe installed programs are being determined by looping through the entries of\n'SOFTWARE\\\\WOW6432Node\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Uninstall'(Table 1) . The information that is collected and written is the\nfollowing (Figure 23, 24):\n\n**Property** **Value**\n\nRaccoon's version Hardcoded\n\nBuild Time: Hardcoded\n\n\n-----\n\nBot ID Concatenation of strings (SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\ MachineGuid + _ + GetComputerNameA()\n\nSystem Language GetLocaleInfoA()\n\nUsername GetUserNameA()\n\nExternal IP (Returned by the configuration)\n\nWindows version SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ ProductName\n\nSystem arch GetSystemWow64DirectoryW()\n\nCPU CPUID\n\nRAM (MB Used etc etc) GlobalMemoryStatusEx()\n\nDisplay Devices EnumDisplayDevicesA()\n\nScreen Resolution GetSystemMetrics()\n\nInstalled APPs SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersi on\\Uninstall\n\n**(Table 1)**\n\n**Figure 23**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 24**\n\nThe malware also has the capability of taking a screenshot[1]. If the 'is_screen_enabled' property exists in the JSON config and its value is 1,\nthen the malware will take a screenshot and saved it as screen.png in TEMP. (Figure 25)\n\n**Figure 25**\nLast but not least the sample looks for various crypto coin wallets and attempt to steal their data. There is a general search in the APPDATA for\nfiles named as 'wallet.dat' and after that, famous wallets are targeted such as (Figures 26,27):\n\nElectrum\nEthereum Wallet\nExodus\nJaxx\nMonero\nBither\n\n**Figure 26**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 27**\nFinally, the sample is preparing for the exfiltration phase. That means collecting all the information that was written to Temp and zipping them\nup to a zip file named 'Log.zip'. The following files are searched up to be included in the zip and are products of the previous attempts to steal\ndata:\n\n1. password.txt\n2. CC.txt\n3. browsers\\\\firefox_cookie.txt\n4. browsers\\\\firefox_urls.txt\n5. browsers\\\\chrome_urls.txt\n6. browsers\\\\chrome_cookie.txt\n7. browsers\\\\chrome_autofill.txt\n8. browsers\\\\ie_autofill.txt\n9. browsers\\\\ie_ftp_data.txt\n10. mails\\\\outlook.txt\n11. mails\\\\thunderbird.txt\n12. mails\\\\foxmail.txt\n13. Wallets\\\\Electrum\n14. Wallets\\\\Ethereum\n15. Wallets\\\\Exodus\n16. Wallets\\\\Jaxx\n17. Wallets\\\\Monero\n18. machineinfo.txt but included in the zip as System Info.txt\n\nThe additional libraries that were dropped in disk are deleted, and so all the files that were included in the zip file. Before the sample deletes\nitself and terminate its execution[1] it does something interesting: it checks for the existence of property 'loader_urls' in the JSON config. If it\nexists, then the sample will generate a random 10 letter name, part of an executable path.(Picture). This will be the location that the executable\nwill be downloaded from the URL, which is the value of the 'loader_urls'. The executable then will be executed. The file will be executed with\nthe ShellExecuteW Windows API. (Figure 28)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 28**\n\nLastly, the malware deletes itself from the infected workstation by executing 'cmd.exe /C ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 3000 > Nul & Del /f /q \"%s\"' as it\nwas stated in Cybereason's blogspot[1]. One thing that comes in mind immediately after finishing the analysis is - did we miss to locate the\nway that the malware is acquiring persistence in the system, or it does not have any persistence method at all? In the next blogspot, we will\ndiscuss and analyze the PE file which was downloaded earlier and the way it is enforcing a persistence across the system. (Figure 29)\n\n**Figure 29**\n\n## Evolution\n\n\n-----\n\ns t s o a o t at d o a a e, t e e as a e e s o e t s a t c e as tte ot e a a e esea c e u o, as d\nenough to point me to another Raccoon sample found in his tracker ( MD5:121f7cba18bcb38e68bd4fc4f2e71815 ). During a quick static\nanalysis by running our IDAPython script, it was revealed that there was indeed a new version, specifically called '[Raccoon Stealer] - v1.3.2\nUC-International Release'(Figure 30)\n\n**Figure 30**\n\nWhile a responsible analyst would take a closer look, diff the functions in order to discover new changes etc etc, we are of the lazy type. So\ninstead of all that, all the strings from a sample with version 1.2 were dumped to a .txt file and diffed against all the strings from the new\nversion. This resulted in the following :\n\nSome new targets were added and specifically FileZilla (Figure 31)\nThere was some new SQLITE queries added (maybe to support newer browser versions?) (Figure 32)\n\n**Figure 31**\n\n**Figure 32**\n\nIn order to confirm our findings, we would have to execute the malware and monitor specific API calls to verify the above. What's the point of\nworking in a sandboxing company if not using the sandbox for that kind of things (Well, apart from malware classification)? Executing the\nmalware[8] and inspecting the logs revealed that indeed the samples is checking for that kind of paths. (Figure 33) Also, a new directory called\n(TempDir-Extended) is created and the two files are potentially stored there. The new directory also exists in our diffing thus further verifying\nthe validity of our results. (Figure 34)\n\n**Figure 33**\n\n**Figure 34**\n\n\n-----\n\no a qu c oo o t e stat c code a d based o t e e ecut o ogs ta e o t e sa dbo e ecut o e co c uded t at\nThe content of the wallets that were stolen is stored in new files based on the type of the coin ( trevor, ledge ) also in a new path but will\nbe added to the Log.zip file with the same name.\nThere seems to be a change in the way that the dumped passwords are stored in the associate .txt files based on static code compare to\nthe older versions. (Couldn't verify that as I have a VM without pre-configured data)\nSeems that in the System Info.txt was added the information of the computer's name. This was later verified by inspecting the dropped\n.txt file before being deleted by the sample. (Figure 35)\n\n**Figure 35**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRaccoon is a infostealer capable of performing a variety of actions, justifying its price and its heavy usage from a variety of criminals. From the\nabove analysis, one must remember that:\n\nThe CnC domain is acquired dynamically - there is an HTTP request beforehand to get the CnC encrypted with RC4 ( It is not hardcoded\nin the sample)\nThe credentials that were grabbed are saved in TEMP folder with specific names - easy to keep in mind during a IR assessment.\nIn version 1.2/1.3.2 there is not a persistence method - in this particular case thought, the response did have an EXE to be executed\nwhich would create a scheduled task but in general, there isn't one.\nSome numeric constants did not change - if we carefully examine the code, most of the tags used during the completion of the\nmachineinfo.txt file are 128bit constants hardcoded in the sample. Apart from the constant used to define the new version of the\nmalware, the other ones are the same. ( With the addition of one used to decrypt 'ComputerName' string ). (Figure 36)\n\n**Figure 36**\n\nLastly, there are some more things to figure out and improve during the analysis of this family such as:\n\nThere is not a clear explanation for the width property in the JSON - the same applies for the mask property too. It could be a placeholder\nfor a future capability maybe?\nBy inspecting strings, it was revealed that the author is using a famous open source JSON[6] library for C++, and specifically the version\n3.4.0. There was an attempt to produce a .lib file in order to use IDA's way of producing FLIRT signatures and make the analysis easier\nbut was not successful. ( There were problems compiling a .hpp header with template definitions and no useful information was\ngenerated. )\nThere was not further exploration of the properties of the JSON thus there is no guarantee that this analysis covered all the potential\ncapabilities of the malware.\n\n**Special Thanks:**\n\n[xorsthingsv2 for taking the time to review the analysis and the doc.](https://twitter.com/xorsthingsv2)\nFumiko, for showing me the new sample\n[@tkanalyst, for posting the raccoon samples](https://twitter.com/tkanalyst)\n\n## Appendix\n\n**Configurations (Table 2):**\n\nMD5 HASH Version CnC Response\n\n\n-----\n\nf7bcb18e5814db9fd51d0ab05f2d7ee9 V1.2 { url : http://34.89.185.248/file_handler/file.php?\nhash=252c0d60af493e46d25e7da5e10207c77b5627de&js=1f192856af8a097533d9b8f13e1d\n{\"masks\":null,\"loader_urls\":null},\"is_screen_enabled\":0,\"is_history_enabled\":0,\"depth\":3}\n\n6556a3467ec8e58756af772aa72da99f V1.2 {\"url\":\"http://34.77.197.252/file_handler/file.php?\nhash=7a48136f8f459660ec43988e0eb8bf0f77a00f0d&js=2de257efd687492ea3537ea0beed2\n{\"masks\":null,\"loader_urls\":null},\"is_screen_enabled\":0,\"is_history_enabled\":0,\"depth\":3}\n\n121f7cba18bcb38e68bd4fc4f2e71815 V1.3.2 {\"url\":\"http://34.76.145.229/file_handler/file.php?\nhash=48b77b41f7e1cb233dc4592900244912bdfe7892&js=429835ce099536a23c41ea48c69\n{\"masks\":null,\"loader_urls\":null},\"is_screen_enabled\":1,\"is_history_enabled\":1,\"depth\":3}\n\n80072d5f4bfa1ff22c87be610438792e V1.2 {\"url\":\"http://34.65.76.39/file_handler/file.php?\nhash=27c70127350a34268baf46dc23eb4e09fd24f547&js=a044f29dbf33cf8013c2cb40b27fa7\n{\"masks\":null,\"loader_urls\":null},\"is_screen_enabled\":0,\"is_history_enabled\":0,\"depth\":3}\n\n126ed436b3531dd857b25b9da2c80462 V1.2 {\"url\":\"http://35.197.207.160/file_handler/file.php?\nhash=2dfe29b8560662cbd03e409e04c32eb0a3e65028&js=47de3ce52e822b60cd7e21a1d3\n{\"masks\":null,\"loader_urls\":[\"http://185.161.210.244/signed.exe\"]},\"is_screen_enabled\":0,\"is_h\n\n**(Table 2)**\n\n## References\n\n[0] https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/243330/well-known-security-identifiers-in-windows-operating-systems\n\n[1] https://www.cybereason.com/blog/hunting-raccoon-stealer-the-new-masked-bandit-on-the-block\n\n[2] https://securityxploded.com/iepasswordsecrets.php\n\n[3] https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1167943/The-Secrets-of-Internet-Explorer-Credentials\n\n[4] [https://cofense.com/raccoon-stealer-found-rummaging-past-symantec-microsoft-gateways/](https://cofense.com/raccoon-stealer-found-rummaging-past-symantec-microsoft-gateways/)\n\n[5] [https://fumik0.com/2019/05/24/overview-of-proton-bot-another-loader-in-the-wild/](https://fumik0.com/2019/05/24/overview-of-proton-bot-another-loader-in-the-wild/)\n\n[6] [https://github.com/nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)\n\n[7] [https://github.com/Secfreaks/analysis/tree/master/raccoon/idascript](https://github.com/Secfreaks/analysis/tree/master/raccoon/idascript)\n\n[8] [https://tria.ge/reports/191129-bykghah8ge/task1](https://tria.ge/reports/191129-bykghah8ge/task1)\n\n\n-----",
