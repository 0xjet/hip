It receives and executes commands from a command-and-control (C&C) server\nand it gathers information from the compromised computer including the host name and\nthe operating system type. Interestingly, the malware author has also considered the\npossibility that the compromised computer could be running Windows 8 or Windows\nServer 2012.\n\n**_Figure 1. Operating Systems check_**\n\nWindows 8 was released in October of this year. This is not necessarily a surprise for\nsecurity researchers as we always encounter new malware when new products are\nreleased. However, this malware does not use any particular function unique to Windows 8\nand we know that this malware existed before the launch of Windows 8. Based on these\nfacts, we believe this code must be an update to the malware.\n\nNext, I would like to introduce a very unique feature of Backdoor.Makadocs. The latest\nversion of Makadocs does not connect to a C&C server directly, rather, it uses Google\ndocs as a proxy server.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2. Backdoor.Makadocs connection route_**\n\nGoogle docs has a function called viewer that retrieves the resources of another URL and\ndisplays it. Basically, this functionality allows a user to view a variety of file types in the\nbrowser. In violation of Google's policies, Backdoor.Makadocs uses this function to access\nits C&C server. It is possible that the malware author has implemented this functionality in\nan attempt to prevent the direct connection to the C&C from being discovered. The\nconnection to the Google docs server is encrypted using HTTPS, thereby making it difficult\nto be blocked locally. It is possible for Google to prevent this connection by using a firewall.\n\nWe confirmed that Backdoor.Makadocs arrives as a Rich Text Format (RTF) or Microsoft\nWord document.\n\n**_Figure 3. Malicious Microsoft Word document_**\n\nPresently, this document does not utilize any vulnerability in order to drop its component,\ninstead, it relies on social engineering tactics. It attempts to pique the user’s interest with\nthe title and content of the document and trick them into clicking on it and executing it. The\nfollowing code extract leads us to believe that the malware primarily targets people living in\nBrazil.\n\n**_Figure 4. Targeting users in Brazil_**\n\nSymantec products detect the RTF and Microsoft-Word files as [Trojan.Dropper. To stay](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2002-082718-3007-99)\nsafe, please ensure that you have the latest patches installed on your computer and keep\nyour antivirus definitions up-to-date.\n\nStatistics\n\n0 Favorited\n\n0 Views\n\n0 Files\n\n\n-----\n\n0 Shares\n\n0 Downloads\n\n## Tags and Keywords\n\n Related Entries and Links\n\nNo Related Resource entered.\n\n\n-----",
