In this paper, we will show some common techniques that**\nwe leveraged in a real case investigation that started with one SysUpdate\nsample found in December 2020, and ended with dozens of samples from\nthe same malware family, dating back to March 2015. SysUpdate is a\nmalware family that has been attributed to the Iron Tiger threat actor in\nthe past. Other malware families from the same threat actor were found,\nand the result of the investigation has been published in the Trend Micro\nblog [4]. The goal of the current paper is to discuss some of the techniques\nthat proved useful to gather related samples, with detailed examples. It\nis complementary with the investigation presented at SSTIC in 2020 [9].\n\nThis investigation started when Talent Jump [1] company handed us a\nmalware sample that they found in December 2020 in a gambling company.\nThat gambling company had already been targeted in July 2019, in what\nwe called Operation DRBControl [5]. Our goals were to find if the sample\nbelonged to a known malware family, a known threat actor, and if it was\nrelated to the previous campaign.\n\n## 1 Sample analysis\n\nFour files were initially sent to us, and the code analysis showed that\na fifth file was involved:\n— dlpumgr32.exe, a legitimate signed file that is part of the DESlock+\nproduct\n— DLPPREM32.DLL, a malicious DLL sideloaded [1] by dlpumgr32.exe\nthat loads and decodes DLPPREM32.bin\n— DLPPREM32.bin, a shellcode that decompresses and loads a launcher\nin memory\n— data.res, an encrypted file decoded by the launcher that contains\ntwo SysUpdate versions: one for a 32-bit architecture and another\nfor a 64-bit architecture\n\n1. http://www.talent-jump.com/EN_index.html\n\n\n-----\n\n2 Taking Advantage of PE Metadata\n\n— config.res, an encrypted file decoded by the launcher which\ncontains the SysUpdate command-and-control (C&C) address\nThe config.res file was not directly available to us, but we could\nconfirm by analyzing a process dump that it contained the C&C IP address.\nThe code analysis showed that the file is deleted right after being read.\n\n**Fig. 1. SysUpdate sample loading process**\n\nA quick analysis of the unobfuscated code reveals some interesting\nRTTI class names, which help figuring some of the malware features:\n\n— CMShell\n— CMFile\n— CMCapture\n— CMServices\n— CMProcess\n— CMPipeServer\n— CMPipeClient\n\n\n-----\n\nM. Lunghi 3\n\n## 2 Malware family identification\n\nThe process of obtaining unobfuscated code from the packed files\nis off-topic, but as seen on figure 1, the unobfuscated code is only\npresent in memory. After dumping the unobfuscated code, our goal was\nto identify the malware family, if known. We found a hardcoded useragent, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36\n(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/34.0.1847.116 Safari/537.36, which\nwas mentioned in an article written by Dell SecureWorks [17] in February\n27, 2019 on the Bronze Union threat actor, also known as Emissary Panda,\nAPT27, LuckyMouse or Iron Tiger [12]. The article mentions two malware\nfamilies, HyperBro [2] and SysUpdate. We were familiar with HyperBro,\nas we encountered it during our investigation on Operation DRBControl [6] in 2019, so we could discard it. We found another article [14]\nlisting the features of the SysUpdate malware family, and they matched\nthe behavior of the in-memory launcher displayed in figure 1. Thanks to\nit, we confidently assumed that this malware belonged to the SysUpdate\nfamily.\n\n## 3 Pivoting on metadata\n\nThe two previously listed articles [14,17] provided indicators of compromise (IOC) of old SysUpdate samples that we could retrieve. A quick\nanalysis showed that their loading process was quite similar, involving a\nlegitimate signed file loading a malicious DLL, which unpacks a binary\nfile in-memory. However, no launcher nor additional files were involved.\n\n**Fig. 2. Loading process of a SysUpdate sample found in NCC blog [14]**\n\n**3.1** **Filename**\n\nWe noticed the sys.bin.url filename has been used in both cases.\nThis was our first pivot, and searching for this filename followed by relevant\n\n\n-----\n\n4 Taking Advantage of PE Metadata\n\n**Fig. 3. Loading process of a SysUpdate sample found in Dell SecureWorks blog [17]**\n\nkeywords (APT, malware) returned sandbox results, but no new samples.\nIssuing the same query [2] in the Virus Total platform returned 7 results,\nsome of which were unknown to us. Searching for their MD5 hashes in\nsearch engines, we found another article [8] written in Farsi language\nwhich described the same malware, and contained further IOCs.\nIn that list, we noticed another legitimate binary being abused by the\nattacker for side-loading a malicious DLL: PYTHON33.dll. In that case,\nthe DLL unpacked a binary file named PYTHON33.hlp. A new search [3] on\nthis filename returned four samples and a new technical analysis [13] of\nour malware. We also found a security bulletin [3] from the UAE national\nCERT dated June 13, 2019 which mentioned a malware family named\nHyperSSL. After analysis, it turned out it was the same malware family,\nand thus HyperSSL could be considered an alias of SysUpdate.\nIn addition to pivoting on filenames for packed payloads, which can be\nchanged by the attacker at any moment, we noticed that the threat actor\ntended to reuse the same legitimate executables to side-load its malicious\nDLL libraries. As the attacker did not control the code of such signed\nlegitimate binaries, he could not change the names of the side-loaded\nlibraries, and thus we could leverage that behavior to hunt for malicious\nDLL libraries based on their name. As an example, we could search for\nlibraries named PYTHON33.dll, but we had to filter the results, because a\nsimple query returned 166 results. We removed corrupt samples, but there\nwere still 99 samples left. After analyzing malicious DLL files from the\nattacker, we noticed their size was always less than 100 Kb, whereas the\nofficial Python library was heavier than a megabyte. By adding a filter on\nthe file size [4], we obtained only five files, which we could analyze manually.\nIt turned out they were all related to the SysUpdate malware family.\n\n2. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name:sys.bin.url/files\n3. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name:python33.hlp/files\n4. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/name:PYTHON33.dllsize:100KbNOTtag:corrupt/files\n\n\n-----\n\nM. Lunghi 5\n\nAt this point, simple queries on filenames learned us that our threat\nactor has targeted Middle-East countries in the past (Iran, UAE), among\nwhich governmental entities, and we expanded our IOC list, not only with\nsamples but also with infrastructure. We also saw multiple reports of\nmalware families and TTPs related to our threat actor.\n\n**3.2** **Imphash**\n\n“Imphash” or “Import hashing” is a method invented by FireEye and\npublished [11] in 2014. The general idea is that the Import Address Table\n(IAT), which is built at compilation time, changes depending on which\norder the functions are placed in the source code. Thus, when a significant\namount of functions are imported and called in a malware’s source code,\nits IAT has a fingerprint unique enough to allow for correlations. Multiple\ntools [5] exist to generate this hash. In our case, this method worked pretty\nwell on the malicious DLLs compiled by our threat actor. For example,\na search [6] query on the imphash 509a3352028077367321fbf20f39f6d9\nreturned three files related to Iron Tiger. Other platforms, such as Malware\nBazaar, allow for similar search queries [7] through their API.\nIt is also possible to build a Yara rule that matches on files with a\nspecific imphash:\n\n**import \"pe\"**\n**rule** **sysupdate_dll_imphash**\n{\n\n**meta** :\n\n**author = \"Daniel** Lunghi\"\n**description = \"Matches** Iron Tiger ’s SysUpdate DLLs from 2019\"\n**purpose = \"Show an** example of imphash Yara rule for SSTIC 2021\nconference \"\n**condition :**\n\n**uint16 (0) ==0 x5a4d** **and // \"MZ\" header**\n**pe** . imphash ()== \"509 a3352028077367321fbf20f39f6d9 \"\n}\n\n**3.3** **PE RICH Header**\n\nThe RICH header is added by the Microsoft compiler to files in the\nPortable Executable (PE) format. It has been first documented [15] in\n2010. It embeds many information, such as the compiler’s version, up to\n\n5. https://github.com/Neo23x0/ImpHash-Generator\n6. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/imphash:\n509a3352028077367321fbf20f39f6d9/files\n7. https://bazaar.abuse.ch/api/#imphash\n\n\n-----\n\n6 Taking Advantage of PE Metadata\n\nthe build number. Researchers have taken advantage [10] of this header\nfor the last couple of years, because it sometimes bring useful correlations. The general idea is that a similar building environment should\nproduce a similar header, which could help finding binaries that have\nbeen compiled in the same machine. Some public tools [8] generate a MD5\nhash of the RICH header, which can then be used in a Yara rule, or in\nmalware repositories that support it. As an example, searching for the\nhash 5503d2d1e505a487cbc37b6ed423081f in Virus Total returns three\nfiles, which are all related to our threat actor.\nThe following Yara rule matches those samples:\n\n**import \"pe\"**\n**import \"hash\"**\n**rule** **sysupdate_richheader**\n{\n\n**meta** :\n\n**author = \"Daniel** Lunghi\"\n**description = \"Matches** Iron Tiger ’s SysUpdate DLLs from 2018\"\n**purpose = \"Show an** example of RICH header Yara rule for SSTIC\n2021 conference \"\n**condition :**\n\n**uint16 (0) ==0 x5a4d** **and // \"MZ\" header**\n**hash** . **md5** ( **pe** . rich_signature . clear_data )== \"5503\n\nd2d1e505a487cbc37b6ed423081f \"\n}\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this header is ignored when\nrunning an executable, and thus, it can be altered without any impact\non the code execution. In 2018, it has been proven [7] that a threat actor\npurposefully modified the RICH header of an executable to match the\nheader of another threat actor.\n\n**3.4** **Stolen certificates**\n\nPE executables can be signed using the Microsoft Authenticode technology. The purpose is to identify the publisher of the code and guarantee\nthe code integrity. Authenticode relies on x509 certificates and certification\nauthorities. Some threat actors compromise software companies to steal\nthe private key that allows them to generate a valid signature for their own\nmalicious executables. This might confuse some security solutions or young\nanalysts that might flag signed code as non malicious. From a defender\nstand point, it is useful to check for compromised certificates, as usually a\nthreat actor will sign more than one executable with a stolen certificate. In\nthe case of Iron Tiger, we found that DLL inicore_v2.3.30.dll reported\n\n8. https://gist.github.com/fr0gger/44ef948d5f129a183b4d44d3e867e097\n\n\n-----\n\nM. Lunghi 7\n\nby Palo Alto [16] was signed by a certificate stolen from the company\nKepware Technologies. Searching for its serial number [9] or thumbprint\n10 in Virus Total returns six results, which are all related to the SysUpdate malware family. Malware Bazaar provides two keywords related to\ncertificates, serial_number and issuer_cn, which are self-explanatory.\nThe following Yara rule matches samples signed by the stolen certificate:\n\n**import \"pe\"**\n**rule** **sysupdate_compromised_kepware_certificate**\n{\n\n**meta** :\n\n**author = \"Daniel** Lunghi\"\n**description = \"Matches** Iron Tiger ’s files from 2018 signed by a\nstolen certificate from Kepware Technologies \"\n**purpose = \"Show an** example of a Yara rule handling certificates\nfor SSTIC 2021 conference \"\n**condition :**\n\n**uint16 (0) ==0 x5a4d** **and // \"MZ\" header**\n**for** **any i in (0 .. pe** . number_of_signatures ) : (\n_//_ _thumbprint_ _and_ _serial_ _must_ _be_ _lower_ _case_\n**pe** . signatures [ **i** ]. serial == \"0d:02: f1 :24: c1 :64:96:22:57:06: f4:\ned:d3:8d:a6 :96\"\n**or pe** . signatures [ **i** ]. thumbprint == \"\nfa89c0cbfce8d745ef3b2f72312077799e69df72 \"\n)\n}\n\nNote that the stolen certificate has been revoked by the certification\nauthority, so the malicious files’ signature is not valid anymore.\n\n**3.5** **TLSH**\n\nMultiple “fuzzy hashing” algorithms exist that intend to match\nsimilar files automatically. They usually split the original file in blocks of\nvariable length, and then make a hash of the different blocks. The most\npopular fuzzy hashing algorithm is SSDeep. However, results on compiled\ncode are usually not good. Of all the fuzzy hashing algorithms that we\nlooked at, TLSH was the one that gave better results for correlation.\nResults should still be taken with caution. As an example, TLSH hash\n\nT112F21A0172A28477E1AE2A3424B592725D7F7C416AF040CB3F9916FA9FB16D0DA3C367\nreturned 223 results in Virus Total, and while many of them were\nrelated to our threat actor, many of them were not, and simply\n\n9. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/signature:\n0D02F124C16496225706F4EDD38DA696/file\n10. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/signature:\nFA89C0CBFCE8D745EF3B2F72312077799E69DF72/files\n\n\n-----\n\n8 Taking Advantage of PE Metadata\n\nhad a similar structure. On the other hand, searching for the hash\n\nT17A634B327C97D8B7E1D97AB858A2DA12152F250059F588C9BF7043E70F2A6509E37F0E\nreturned only two results, and both were related to our threat actor. Note\nthat Malware Bazaar also allows to search for TLSH hash in its API [11].\n\n## 4 Conclusion\n\nThe goal of this short paper was to present some techniques that\ndefenders can leverage when investigating a breach to gather additional\ninformation and IOC about the threat actor. It is complementary with the\ntalk [9] presented at SSTIC in 2020, this time focusing on PE metadata.\nBy using these techniques in a recent investigation, we started from a\nsingle unknown sample and found more than thirty samples from the same\nmalware family, around 15 C&C IP addresses, multiple reports discussing\nthe same threat actor and detailing its targets and Tactics, Techniques and\nProcedures (TTPs). It shows the importance of public research containing\nIOC, which helped us to identify the malware family. We could also\ncompare our sample to previous versions of the same malware and spot\nthe structural changes.\nWe hope that by showing examples taken from a real case investigation,\nit will help young researchers to apply these techniques to their own\ninvestigations.\n\n## References\n\n1.
