The incident is widely reported to contain three individual\ncomponents deployed by the same adversary, including a malicious bootloader that corrupts\ndetected local disks, a Discord-based downloader and a file wiper. The activity occurred at\napproximately the same time multiple websites belonging to the Ukrainian government were\ndefaced.\n\nThis blog covers the malicious bootloader in more detail.\n\n## Details\n\nThe installer component for the bootloader has an SHA256 hash of\n\n```\na196c6b8ffcb97ffb276d04f354696e2391311db3841ae16c8c9f56f36a38e92\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nand contains a build timestamp of 2022-01-10 10:37:18 UTC. It was built using MinGW,\nsimilar to the file-wiper component. This component overwrites the master boot record\n(MBR) of an infected host with a malicious 16-bit bootloader with a SHA256 hash of\n\n```\n44ffe353e01d6b894dc7ebe686791aa87fc9c7fd88535acc274f61c2cf74f5b8\n\n```\n\nthat displays a ransom note when the host boots (Figure 1) and, at the same time, performs\ndestructive operations on the infected host’s hard drives.\n\nFigure 1. Fake ransom note\n\nThe destructive wiping operation has the following pseudocode:\n```\nfor i_disk between 0 and total_detected_disk_count do\n  for i_sector between 1 and total_disk_sector_count, i_sector += 199, do\n   overwrite disk i_disk at sector i_sector with hardcoded data\n  done\ndone\n\n```\nAt periodic offsets, the bootloader overwrites sectors of an infected host’s entire hard drive,\nwith a message similar to the ransom note, padded with additional bytes (Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Hexadecimal dump of the pattern written to the disks of an infected host\n\nThe data consists of the string `AAAAA, the index of the infected drive, the ransom note and`\nthe MBR footer magic value `55 AA, followed by two null bytes.`\n\nThe bootloader accesses the disk via BIOS interrupt `13h in logical block addressing (LBA)`\nmode and overwrites every 199th sector until the end of the disk is reached. After a disk is\ncorrupted, the malware overwrites the next in the detected disk list.\n\nThis process is unsophisticated but reminiscent of the more evolved implementation of\n_NotPetya’s malicious MBR that masqueraded as the legitimate_ `chkdsk disk-repair utility`\nwhile actually corrupting the infected host’s file system.\n\nThe bootloader installer does not initiate a reboot of the infected system, as has been\nobserved in past intrusions such as BadRabbit and NotPetya. The lack of forced reboot\nsuggests the threat actor took other steps to initiate it (e.g., via a different implant) or decided\nto let users perform the reboot themselves. A delayed reboot may allow other components of\nthe WhisperGate intrusion to run (e.g., the file wiper).\n\n## Assessment\n\n\n-----\n\nThe WhisperGate bootloader malware complements its file-wiper counterpart. Both aim to\nirrevocably corrupt the infected hosts’ data and attempt to masquerade as genuine modern\nransomware operations. However, the WhisperGate bootloader has no decryption or datarecovery mechanism, and has inconsistencies with malware commonly deployed in\nransomware operations.\n\nThe displayed message suggests victims can expect recovery of their data, but this is\ntechnically unachievable. These inconsistencies very likely indicate that WhisperGate activity\naims to destroy data on the impacted assets. This assessment is made with moderate\nconfidence as technical analysis of the WhisperGate activity continues.\n\nThe activity is reminiscent of [VOODOO BEAR’s destructive NotPetya malware, which](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence-v2/actors/voodoo-bear)\nincluded a component impersonating the legitimate `chkdsk utility after a reboot and`\ncorrupted the infected host’s Master File Table (MFT) — a critical component of Microsoft’s\nNTFS file system. However, the WhisperGate bootloader is less sophisticated, and no\ntechnical overlap could currently be identified with VOODOO BEAR operations.\n\n## CrowdStrike Intelligence Confidence Assessment\n\n**High Confidence: Judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple sources.**\nHigh confidence in the quality and quantity of source information supporting a judgment does\nnot imply that that assessment is an absolute certainty or fact. The judgment still has a\nmarginal probability of being inaccurate.\n\n**Moderate Confidence: Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced and**\nplausible, but not of sufficient quantity or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of\nconfidence. This level of confidence is used to express that judgments carry an increased\nprobability of being incorrect until more information is available or corroborated.\n\n**Low Confidence: Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain, the**\ninformation is too fragmented or poorly corroborated enough to make solid analytic\ninferences, or the reliability of the source is untested. Further information is needed for\ncorroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_Find out how to stop adversaries targeting your industry — schedule a free 1:1 intel_\n_briefing with a CrowdStrike threat intelligence expert today._\n_Learn about the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the_\n_product webpage._\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ to see for yourself how](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_true next-gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
