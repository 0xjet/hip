TAG-70 overlaps with activity reported by other security\nvendors under the aliases Winter Vivern, TA473, and UAC-0114. The group likely conducts\ncyber-espionage campaigns to serve the interests of Belarus and Russia and has been active since at\nleast December 2020, primarily targeting governments in Europe and Central Asia.\n\nIn their latest campaign, TAG-70 likely started exploiting Roundcube webmail servers at the beginning\nof October 2023 and continued until at least mid-October. Insikt Group detected at least 80\norganizations targeted in this campaign; the victims were primarily entities in Georgia, Poland, and\nUkraine. This campaign has been linked to additional TAG-70 activity against Uzbekistan government\nmail servers, which involved infrastructure reported by Insikt Group in February 2023.\n\nTAG-70’s targeting of Roundcube webmail servers is only the most recent instance of targeting email\nsoftware attributed to Russia-aligned threat actor groups. In June 2023, Insikt Group discovered that\nthe Russian state-sponsored cyber-espionage group BlueDelta (APT28, Fancy Bear) was targeting\n[vulnerable Roundcube installations across Ukraine and had previously exploited CVE-2023-23397, a](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23397)\ncritical zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook in 2022. Other well-known Russian threat actor\ngroups, such as Sandworm and BlueBravo (APT29, Midnight Blizzard), have also previously targeted\n[email solutions in various campaigns (1,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/nsa-russian-hack.html) [2, 3).](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/russias-nobelium-using-usaids-email-system-for-hack-microsoft-says.html)\n\nIn the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, compromised email servers may expose sensitive\ninformation regarding Ukraine’s war effort and planning, its relationships and negotiations with its\npartner countries as it seeks additional military and economic assistance, expose third parties\ncooperating with the Ukrainian government privately, and reveal fissures within the coalition supporting\nUkraine. Furthermore, the targeting of the Iranian embassies in Russia and the Netherlands may be\nlinked to a desire to assess Iran's current diplomatic activities and foreign policy, especially as Russia\ncontinues to rely on Iran-provided weapons in Ukraine. Espionage against the Georgian Embassy in\nSweden and the Georgian Ministry of Defence is likely to have similar foreign policy-oriented\n[motivations, particularly as Georgia renewed its aspirations for European Union (EU) membership](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/georgia-eyes-eu-candidate-status-membership-still-distant-dream-2023-12-12/) and\n[North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) accession following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/how-georgia-and-ukraine-are-bolstering-their-chances-join-nato)\n2022.\n\nOrganizations can mitigate the risk of compromise in TAG-70’s Roundcube campaign by ensuring that\nRoundcube installations are patched and up-to-date, as well as by blocking and hunting for indicators\nof compromise (IoCs) in their environments (for a list of relevant IoCs, see Appendix A).\n\nInsikt Group followed responsible disclosure procedures in advance of this publication per Recorded\nFuture's notification policy.\n\n1 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - TAG-70’s espionage campaign targeted European government and military mail servers. The\ncampaign has been active since at least December 2020, primarily focusing on European and\nCentral Asian governments. TAG-70 employs advanced techniques and tools, indicating that a\nwell-funded and skilled threat actor is behind the operation.\n\n  - TAG-70 has demonstrated a high level of sophistication in its attack methods. The threat actors\nleveraged social engineering techniques and exploited cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in\nRoundcube webmail servers to gain unauthorized access to targeted mail servers, bypassing the\ndefenses of government and military organizations.\n\n  - By infiltrating mail servers, TAG-70 aims to collect intelligence on European political and military\nactivities, possibly to gain strategic advantages or undermine European security and alliances.\nThe campaign's intended victims indicate that it has been conducted to serve the interests of\nBelarus and Russia.\n\n  - This TAG-70 campaign has had a significant impact, as the malware may have intruded into email\nservers in multiple European countries, including Georgia, Poland, and Ukraine. Additionally,\nInsikt Group detected TAG-70 targeting Iran’s embassies in Russia and the Netherlands, which is\nnotable given Iran’s support of Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. TAG-70s actions highlight the\nwidespread nature of the campaign and its implications for national security.\n\n  - TAG-70’s ability to compromise mail servers poses a significant risk, as it enables the theft of\nsensitive information and manipulation of communication channels.\n\n## Background\n\n[In February 2023, CERT-UA reported](https://cert.gov.ua/article/3761104) details of TAG-70 activity in which the threat actors created a\nspoofed website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. The site lured users to download\nmalicious software for \"scanning infected PCs for viruses\".\n\nInsikt Group detected TAG-70 conducting website impersonation attacks in February 2023. In this\nactivity, TAG-70 appended a domain with legitimate domains of multiple Eastern European government\nwebsites to deliver script-based malware.\n\n[In March 2023, Proofpoint reported](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/exploitation-dish-best-served-cold-winter-vivern-uses-known-zimbra-vulnerability) a new campaign in which TAG-70 exploited publicly facing Zimbra\nwebmail portals via CVE-2022-27926. This activity aimed to gain access to the emails of military,\ngovernment, and diplomatic organizations across Europe involved in the Russia-Ukraine War.\n\nRecorded Future highlighted TAG-70 domain registrations and suspected phishing lure material linked to\nthese domains in April 2023.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, ESET [detailed](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/winter-vivern-exploits-zero-day-vulnerability-roundcube-webmail-servers/) [an XSS zero-day CVE-2023-5631, used by TAG-70 to exploit](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-5631)\nvulnerable Roundcube webmail servers. The vulnerability enabled the attackers to list and exfiltrate\n\n2 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: TAG-70 operational infrastructure in March 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n#### Malware Analysis\n\nOn July 27, 2023, a new TAG-70 domain, hitsbitsx[.]com, resolved to IP address 176.97.66[.]57. Insikt\nGroup also detected this domain in a JavaScript-based malware sample uploaded to a malware\nrepository, shown in Figure 2: SHA256:\nea22b3e9ecdfd06fae74483deb9ef0245aefdc72f99120ae6525c0eaf37de32e.\n\nThe discovered JavaScript malware matches the second-stage loader used in TAG-70’s previous\n[Roundcube exploitation described by ESET. This JavaScript is loaded via XSS from a malicious email](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/winter-vivern-exploits-zero-day-vulnerability-roundcube-webmail-servers/)\nand is used to decode a Base64-encoded JavaScript payload (jsBodyBase64). The payload is then\ninserted into the Document Object Model (DOM) of the Roundcube webpage within a newly created\n\n3 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n4 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: Abbreviated decoded Base64 JavaScript payload containing C2 domain, victim mail server, and credential exfiltration**\ncode (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nInsikt Group also [identified a related JavaScript sample from November 2022: SHA256:](https://urlscan.io/result/b127f19a-7795-47d1-ad28-dfe6024ff2b6)\n6800357ec3092c56aab17720897c29bb389f70cb49223b289ea5365314199a26. This older sample\nwas hosted on the domain bugiplaysec[.]com, used the same JavaScript loader technique, and had a\nsimilar credential exfiltration payload. The content within the payload suggests that it was used to\ntarget the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n5 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Abbreviated decoded Base64 JavaScript payload containing C2 domain, victim mail server, and credential exfiltration**\ncode from JavaScript sample from November 2022 (Source: urlscan)\n\n6 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Malicious Infrastructure Analysis\n\nHosting history for the domain hitsbitsx[.]com, detailed in Table 1, shows that on September 25, 2023,\nthe domain was moved from IP address 176.97.66[.]57 to IP address 38.180.3[.]57.\n\n**IP Address** **Date From** **Date To**\n\n176.97.76[.]118 2023-04-12 2023-07-17\n\n176.97.66[.]57 2023-07-17 2023-09-25\n\n38.180.3[.]57 2023-09-25\n\n**Table 1: Hosting history for hitsbitsx[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nAnalysis of the server banners returned from 38.180.3[.]57 showed the use of uncommon HTTP\nbanners hosted on TCP ports 80 and 443 beginning September 2023.

Previously,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/winter-vivern-exploits-zero-day-vulnerability-roundcube-webmail-servers/)\nin June 2023, the domain resolved to IP address 176.97.76[.]129. Historical server banners for\n176.97.76[.]129 were similar to those detailed in Table 2, with the exception that TCP port 80 was also\nreturning an HTTP 403 Forbidden page in addition to TCP port 443.\n\nDuring the aforementioned Roundcube campaign, TAG-70 used an infrastructure configuration similar to\nthe one detected by Recorded Future in March (Figure 1). However, Insikt Group identified a second C2\nserver within the Roundcube relay chain, which utilized TCP port 443 (as shown in Figure 5) rather than\na static high ephemeral port. As in the March campaign, Recorded Future observed TAG-70\ncommunicating with the upstream C2 via Tor to obfuscate their true location.\n\n**[Figure 5: TAG-70 operational infrastructure in October 2023 (Source: ESET& Recorded Future)](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/winter-vivern-exploits-zero-day-vulnerability-roundcube-webmail-servers/)**\n\nIn this campaign, TAG-70 began exploiting Roundcube webmail servers at the beginning of October\n2023 and continued until at least mid-October. Recorded Future detected TAG-70 targeting at least 80\nseparate organizations, primarily focusing on entities in Ukraine, Georgia, and Poland, as shown in\n**Figure 6.**\n\nNotably, there were some victims outside of these countries, such as the Embassy of Iran in Moscow,\nthe Embassy of Iran in the Netherlands, and the Embassy of Georgia in Sweden.\n\n8 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6: Geographic spread of victims of TAG-70s Roundcube exploit in October 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nTAG-70 predominantly targeted government and military webmail servers; however, the group also\ntargeted the transport and education sectors along with chemical and biological research\norganizations, as shown in Figure 7.\n\n9 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n10 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigations\n\n  - **Strengthen Email Security Measures: Implement advanced email security solutions, such as**\nmulti-factor authentication, encryption, and secure email gateways, to protect mail servers from\nunauthorized access and data breaches.\n\n  - **Conduct Regular Security Audits: Regularly audit mail servers to identify vulnerabilities,**\nmisconfigurations, and potential entry points for attackers. Address any identified weaknesses\npromptly to minimize the risk of exploitation.\n\n  - **Employee Awareness Training: Provide comprehensive training on email security best practices,**\nincluding identifying phishing emails, suspicious attachments, and links. Regularly reinforce\ntraining to maintain a high level of awareness and vigilance.\n\n  - **Implement Network Segmentation: Separate mail servers from other critical systems by**\nimplementing network segmentation. This practice limits the lateral movement of threats,\npreventing a single compromised system from compromising the entire network.\n\n  - **Collaborate with Security Vendors and Intelligence Agencies: Establish partnerships with**\nreputable security vendors and intelligence agencies to leverage their expertise and threat\nintelligence. Regularly exchange information on emerging threats and indicators of compromise\nto enhance proactive defense measures.\n\n  - **Develop Incident Response Plans: Create comprehensive incident response plans that outline**\nclear protocols for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents. Regularly\ntest and refine these plans through simulated exercises to ensure an effective response in\nreal-world scenarios.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThis latest campaign by Belarus and Russia-aligned TAG-70, which targets European government and\nmilitary-owned email servers, suggests a long-term strategic interest in gathering intelligence regarding\nthe war in Ukraine and the evolving foreign policies of regional powers. Belarus and Russia-aligned\ncyber-espionage groups will almost certainly continue, if not expand, targeting webmail software\nplatforms, including Roundcube, while the conflict in Ukraine continues and while tensions with the EU\nand NATO remain high.\n\n11 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n## Appendix B — MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\n|Appendix B — MITRE ATT&CK Techniques|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tactic: Technique|ATT&CK Code|\n|Initial Access: Phishing|T1566|\n|Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution|T1203|\n|Persistence: Valid Accounts|T1078|\n|Credential Access: Exploitation for Credential Access|T1212|\n|Credential Access: Input Capture|T1056|\n|Discovery: File and Directory Discovery|T1083|\n|Collection: Email Collection|T1114|\n|Command and Control: Non-Standard Port|T1571|\n\n\n12 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix C — Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis\n\n13 CTA-RU-2024-0217 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group, the company’s threat research division, comprises\nanalysts and security researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and\nintelligence agency experience.
