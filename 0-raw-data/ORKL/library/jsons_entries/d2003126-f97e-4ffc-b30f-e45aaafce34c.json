The details show the domain was registered to\nDong Hao and Boyusec.\n\nAPT3 has traditionally targeted a wide-range of companies and technologies, likely to fulfill intelligence collection\nrequirements on behalf of the MSS (see research below). Recorded Future has been closely following APT3 and\nhas discovered additional information corroborating that the MSS is responsible for the intrusion activity conducted\nby the group.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future Intel Card for APT3.\n\n### Background\n\nAPT3 (also known as UPS, Gothic Panda, and TG-011) is a sophisticated threat group that has been active since at\nleast 2010. APT3 utilizes a broad range of tools and techniques including spearphishing attacks, zero-day exploits,\nand numerous unique and publicly available remote access tools (RAT). Victims of APT3 intrusions include\ncompanies in the defense, telecommunications, transportation, and advanced technology sectors — as well as\ngovernment departments and bureaus in Hong Kong, the U.S., and several other countries.\n\n### Analysis\n\nOn Boyusec’s website, the company explicitly identifies two organizations that it cooperatively partners with,\n[Huawei Technologies and the Guangdong Information Technology Security Evaluation Center (or Guangdong](http://www.huawei.com/)\nITSEC).\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot of Boyusec’s website where Huawei and Guangdong ITSEC are\nidentified as collaborative partners.\n\n[In November 2016, the Washington Free Beacon reported that a Pentagon internal intelligence report had exposed](http://freebeacon.com/national-security/pentagon-links-chinese-cyber-security-firm-beijing-spy-service/)\na product that Boyusec and Huawei were jointly producing. According to the Pentagon’s report, the two companies\nwere working together to produce security products, likely containing a backdoor, that would allow Chinese\nintelligence “to capture data and control computer and telecommunications equipment.” The article quotes\ngovernment officials and analysts stating that Boyusec and the MSS are “closely connected,” and that Boyusec\nappears to be a cover company for the MSS.\n\n\n-----\n\nImagery ©2017 DigitalGlobe, Map data ©2017\n\nBoyusec is located in Room 1103 of the Huapu Square West Tower in Guangzhou, China.\n\nBoyusec’s work with its other “cooperative partner,” Guangdong ITSEC, has been less well-documented. As will be\nlaid out below, Recorded Future’s research has concluded that Guangdong ITSEC is subordinate to an MSS-run\norganization called China Information Technology Evaluation Center (CNITSEC) and that Boyusec has been working\nwith Guangdong ITSEC on a joint active defense lab since 2014.\n\nGuangdong ITSEC is one in a nation-wide network of security evaluation centers [certified and administered by](http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2011-05-20/141322500302.shtml)\n[CNITSEC. According to Chinese state-run media, Guangdong ITSEC became the sixteenth nationwide branch of](http://news.enorth.com.cn/system/2011/05/20/006588656.shtml)\n[CNITSEC in May 2011. Guangdong ITSEC’s site also lists itself as CNITSEC’s Guangdong Office on its header.](http://www.gditsec.org.cn/)\n\n[According to academic research published in China and Cybersecurity: Espionage, Strategy, and Politics in the](https://books.google.com/books?id=SbDlBgAAQBAJ&dq=china+and+cybersecurity:+espionage)\n_Digital Domain, CNITSEC is run by the MSS and houses much of the intelligence service’s technical cyber_\nexpertise. CNITSEC is used by the MSS to “conduct vulnerability testing and software reliability assessments.” Per\n[a 2009 U.S. State Department cable, it is believed China may also use vulnerabilities derived from CNITSEC’s](https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/214462)\nactivities in intelligence operations. CNITSEC’s Director, Wu Shizhong, even self-identifies as MSS, including for his\n[work as a deputy head of China’s National Information Security Standards Committee as recently as January 2016.](http://www.cesinet.com/itsforum2014/infoz.html)\n\n[Recorded Future research identified several job advertisements on Chinese-language job sites such as](http://www.jobui.com/job/151158407/)\njobs.zhaopin.com, jobui.com, and kanzhun.com since 2015, Boyusec revealed a collaboratively established joint\nactive defense lab (referred to as an ADUL) with Guangdong ITSEC in 2014. Boyusec stated that the mission of the\njoint lab was to develop risk-based security technology and to provide users with innovative network defense\ncapabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nJob posting where Boyusec highlights the joint lab with Guangdong ITSEC. The translated text is, “In 2014,\nGuangzhou Boyu Information Technology Company and Guangdong ITSEC cooperated closely to establish a joint\nactive defense lab (ADUL).”\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe lifecycle of APT3 is emblematic of how the MSS conducts operations in both the human and cyber domains.\n[According to scholars of Chinese intelligence, the MSS is composed of national, provincial, and local elements.](https://www.google.com/#q=%22peter+mattis%22+OR+%22bonnie+glaser%22+OR+%22Bates+Gill%22+OR+%22Nicholas+Eftimiades%22)\n[Many of these elements, especially at the provincial and local levels, include organizations with valid public missions](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/chinese-civilian-foreign-policy-research-institutes-evolving-roles-and-increasing-influence/017116D83D73C6158605E1420A7ACEE4)\n[to act as a cover for MSS intelligence operations. Some of these organizations include think tanks such as CICIR,](https://books.google.com/books?id=RbUhAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=china%27s+security+state&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj938jmlfLTAhXpgFQKHZsbAqUQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=china's security state&f=false)\n[while others include provincial-level governments and local offices.](http://zwgk.gd.gov.cn/006939748/201009/t20100916_12204.html)\n\nIn the case of APT3 and Boyusec, this MSS operational concept serves as a model for understanding the cyber\nactivity and lifecycle:\n\nWhile Boyusec has a website, an online presence, and a stated “information security services” mission, it\ncites only two partners, Huawei and Guangdong ITSEC.\n\nIntrusiontruth and the Washington Free Beacon have linked Boyusec to supporting and engaging in cyber\nactivity on behalf of the Chinese intelligence services.\n\nRecorded Future’s open source research has revealed that Boyusec’s other partner is a field office for a\nbranch of the MSS. Boyusec and Guangdong ITSEC have been documented working collaboratively together\nsince at least 2014.\n\nAcademic research spanning decades documents an MSS operational model that utilizes organizations,\nseemingly without an intelligence mission, at all levels of the state to serve as cover for MSS intelligence\noperations.\n\nA di t it b it B h l t ll b ti t f hi h (H i) it i ki\n\n\n-----\n\nbranch of the MSS.\n\nGraphic displaying the relationship between the MSS and APT3.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe implications are clear and expansive. Recorded Future’s research leads us to attribute APT3 to the Chinese\n[Ministry of State Security and Boyusec with a high degree of confidence. Boyusec has a documented history of](http://freebeacon.com/national-security/pentagon-links-chinese-cyber-security-firm-beijing-spy-service/)\nproducing malicious technology and working with the Chinese intelligence services.\n\nAPT3 is the first threat actor group that has been attributed with a high degree of confidence directly to the MSS.\nCompanies in sectors that have been victimized by APT3 now must adjust their strategies to defend against the\nresources and technology of the Chinese government. In this real-life David versus Goliath situation, customers\nneed both smart security controls and policy, as well as actionable and strategic threat intelligence.\n\nAPT3 is not just another cyber threat group engaging in malicious cyber activity; research indicates that Boyusec is\nan asset of the MSS and their activities support China’s political, economic, diplomatic, and military goals.\n\n[The MSS derives intelligence collection requirements from state and party leadership many of which are defined](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol.-56-no.-3/pdfs/Mattis-Understanding Chinese Intel.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nand technology, biomedical, and aerospace.\n\n\n-----",
