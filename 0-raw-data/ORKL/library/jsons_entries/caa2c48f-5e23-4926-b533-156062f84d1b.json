In the past, we’ve learned more\n[about these groups by speaking directly with operators and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/interview-with-lockbit-ransomware.html) examining these groups’\nchanging tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).\n\nTalos researchers recently spent weeks combing through chat logs and other information we\nobtained from Hive and Conti operators' conversations with victims. These conversations\nhad not previously been made public. The research paper we’re releasing today contains\nnew insights into how Conti and Hive choose their targets, negotiate with victims, operate\ninternally, and much more.\n\n\n-----",
