    "plain_text": "# Mofang: A politically motivated information stealing adversary\n\n**[blog.fox-it.com/2016/06/15/mofang-a-politically-motivated-information-stealing-adversary/](https://blog.fox-it.com/2016/06/15/mofang-a-politically-motivated-information-stealing-adversary/)**\n\nJune 15, 2016\n\nMofang (模仿, Mófa ̌ng, to imitate) is a threat actor that\nalmost certainly operates out of China and is probably\ngovernment-affiliated. It is highly likely that Mofang’s targets\nare selected based on involvement with investments, or\ntechnological advances that could be perceived as a threat\nto the Chinese sphere of influence. This is most clearly the\ncase in a campaign focusing on government and critical\ninfrastructure of Myanmar that is described in this report.\nChances are about even, though, that Mofang is a relevant\nthreat actor to any organization that invests in Myanmar or is\notherwise politically involved. In addition to the campaign in\nMyanmar, Mofang has been observed to attack targets\nacross multiple sectors (government, military, critical\ninfrastructure and the automotive and weapon industries) in\nmultiple countries.\n\nThe following countries have, in the above named sectors, been affected, although Fox-IT\nsuspects there to be more: India, Germany, United States, Canada, Singapore, South Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\nDespite its diverse set of targets Mofang is probably one group. This is based on the fact that\nits tools (ShimRat and ShimRatReporter) are not widely used, and that campaigns are not\nusually observed in parallel. Technically, the group uses distinct tools that date back to at\nleast February 2012: ShimRat and ShimRatReporter. The mofang group does not use\nexploits to infect targets, they rely on social engineering and their attacks are carried out in\nthree stages:\n\n1. Compromise for reconnaissance, aiming to extract key information about the target\n\ninfrastructure.\n2. Faux infrastructure setup, designed to avoid attracting attention.\n3. The main compromise, to carry out actions on the objective.\n\nThe name ShimRat is based on how its persistence is build up. It uses the so-called shims in\nWindows to become persistent. Shims are simply hot patching processes on the fly, to\nensure backward compatibility of software on the Microsoft Windows platform.\n\nAs far as known, the only exploits the Mofang group uses are privilege elevation exploits built\ninto their own malware. The vulnerabilities that were being exploited were already known\nabout at the time of use. The full report contains contextual as well as technical information\nabout the group and its activities. These can be used, for example, for threat assessments,\ncompromise assessments, incident response and forensics activities.\n\n**[Download ‘Mofang – a politically motivated information stealing adversary’](https://blog.fox-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fox-it_mofang_threatreport_tlp-white.pdf)**\n\n\n-----",
