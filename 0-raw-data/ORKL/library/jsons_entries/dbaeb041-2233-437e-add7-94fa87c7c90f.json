Of note, this is three years earlier than the oldest Elise sample we have found,**\n\n**suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented. In addition,**\n\n**Emissary appears to only be used against Taiwanese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the**\n\n**decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or**\n\n**military.**\n\n**We also found several different versions of Emissary that had several iterative changes that**\n\n**show how the Trojan evolved over the years. One of the most interesting observations made**\n\n**during this analysis is that the amount of development effort devoted to Emissary significantly**\n\n**[increased after we published our Operation Lotus Blossom report in June 2015, resulting in](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/operation-lotus-blossom/)**\n\n**many new versions of the Emissary Trojan. In addition, we observed a TTP shift post publication**\n\n**with regards to their malware delivery; they started using compromised but legitimate domains**\n\n**to serve their malware. Interestingly, the C2 infrastructure is also somewhat different than that**\n\n**used by Elise.**\n\n**In contrast to Elise, which was used in attacks against multiple Southeast Asian countries in**\n\n**region appropriate languages, all of the Emissary decoys we’ve collected are written in**\n\n**Traditional Chinese, which is used primarily in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The targets we have**\n\n**identified are also limited to those two regions. Despite appearing to target a more limited**\n\n**geographical range, Emissary targeted the government, higher education, and high tech**\n\n**companies with a mix of copy and pasted news articles and documents that do not appear to be**\n\n**available online. Decoys include:**\n\n**An Excel spreadsheet containing legitimate contact information for much of the Taiwanese**\n\n**government that does not appear to be available online.**\n\n**Copy and paste of a news article where the Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military**\n\n**region, Wang Huanguang, responds negatively to a 2014 magazine article from a respected**\n\n**US Taiwan scholar saying the odds of China and Taiwan reuniting is low and discussing the**\n\n**issues with an attempted military takeover.**\n\n**Copy of a news article from 2010 about the Chinese League of Victims protesting the**\n\n**involuntary removal of Shanghai residents in the lead up to the Shanghai Expo.**\n\n**Copy of the official Taiwan holiday schedule for 2016, which is the 105[th] anniversary of the**\n\n**current Taiwanese government.**\n\n|Col1|POSTED BY: Robert Falcone and Jen Miller-Osborn on February 3, 2016 11:00 AM|\n|---|---|\n|6||\n|LLiikkee|FILED IN: Malware, Threat Prevention, Unit 42 TAGGED: AutoFocus, cyber espionage, cybersecurity, Elise, Emissary, Espionage, Lotus Blossom, Trojans In December 2015, Unit 42 published a blog about a cyber espionage attack using the Emissary Trojan as a payload.

In contrast, the Elise samples used a mix of actor-registered**\n\n**and DDNS, with the actor-registered serving as one of the data points we used to tie all of the**\n\n**activity together. While the use of DDNS can make tying activity together more difficult, and**\n\n**despite the new Emissary variants since our publication, two of the most recent C2s resolved to**\n\n**IPs used by Elise C2s detailed in Operation Lotus Blossom. The Emissary samples typically**\n\n**have three hardcoded C2s that are a mix of IPs and domain names, with one of the domains or**\n\n**IPs not being used by the other three C2s in a likely effort to avoid loss of control. A full IOC list**\n\n**is included at the end of this report.**\n\n**Also new is the actors’ use of compromised legitimate Taiwanese websites to serve their**\n\n**malware, including the official website of the Democratic Progressive Party. This is particularly**\n\n**interesting as Taiwan just held a closely watched Presidential election on 16 January where**\n\n**DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen won. This marked the first time a woman was elected President of**\n\n**Taiwan and only the second time a member of the Kuomintang did not hold the office since**\n\n**being ousted from China in 1949 when the Communist Party of China took power. In line with**\n\n**her party’s stance, she is widely seen as a proponent of an independent Taiwan and not in favor**\n\n**of reunification with the People’s Republic of China.**\n\n**Our evidence suggests that malware authors created Emissary as early as 2009, which**\n\n**suggests that threat actors have relied on this tool as a payload in cyber-espionage attacks for**\n\n**many years. The Emissary Trojan is a capable tool to gain a foothold on a targeted system.**\n\n**While it lacks more advanced functionality like screen capturing, it is still able to carry out most**\n\n**tasks desired by threat actors: exfiltration of files, ability to download and execute additional**\n\n**payloads, and gain remote shell access. It appears that threat actors have continually used this**\n\n**Trojan, and developed several updated versions of Emissary to remain undetected and fresh**\n\n**over time.**\n\n**We analyzed all of the known Emissary samples to determine what changes the malware author**\n\n**made between the different versions of the Trojan. During our analysis, we examined when**\n\n**each sample was created based on its compile time and produced a simple timeline, seen in**\n\n**Figure 2, to display the development efforts expended on the Emissary Trojan. It should be**\n\n**noted that we know some Emissary samples have been used multiple times with different**\n\n**configurations, so the timeline only shows when development activity took place on Emissary**\n\n**and should not be misconstrued to when Emissary was used in attacks.**\n\n**The timeline in Figure 2 shows that the Emissary Trojan was first created (version 1.0) in May**\n\n**2009 and quickly received an update that resulted in version 1.1 in June 2009. The Trojan did**\n\n**not receive much in the form of updates until September 2011 when the author released version**\n\n**2.0. Version 2.0 received one update in October 2013 before the malware author released**\n\n**version 3.0 in December 2014. The malware author released version 4.0 in March 2015, but**\n\n**curiously created a version 3.0 sample afterwards on June 26, 2015, which was out-of-**\n\n**sequence from the incrementing versioning. Between August and November 2015 the malware**\n\n**author creates several new versions of Emissary, specifically 5.0, 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4 in a much**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Timeline of development efforts spent on Emissary**\n\n**The out-of-sequence version 3.0 appears to be an early variant of version 5.0 based on**\n\n**significant similarities (discussed in the changelog section) that are not seen in the original**\n\n**version 3.0 and other earlier versions of Emissary. One campaign code associated with of the**\n\n**out-of-sequence version 3.0 sample was “3test”, suggesting the malware author created it for**\n\n**testing purposes. The other campaign code associated with the out-of-sequence sample was**\n\n**“IC00001”, which could denote an attack payload as it appears to be a plausible code to**\n\n**describe a campaign.**\n\n**While this may be coincidental, the out-of-sequence version 3.0 sample was created ten days**\n\n**[after we published the Operation Lotus Blossom paper that exposed the Elise Trojan that is](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/operation-lotus-blossom/)**\n\n**closely related to Emissary. It is possible that the threat actors were prompted to make malware**\n\n**changes in response to our research. Regardless of causation, the rapid development of new**\n\n**versions of Emissary suggests that the malware authors are making frequent modifications to**\n\n**evade detection, which as a corollary suggests the threat actors are actively using the Emissary**\n\n**Trojan as a payload in attacks.**\n\n**In this section, we discuss the changes observed between each version of Emissary. As this**\n\n**section is focused on changes, the features and functionality are the same between Emissary**\n\n**versions unless otherwise mentioned.**\n\n**Date: 5/12/2009**\n\n**SHA256: a7d07b92e48876e2195e5d8769a47cf0a237e11ac304e41b14fc36042b0d9484**\n\n**Original Name: WUMsvc.dll**\n\n**Initial Release**\n\n**The initial loader Trojan writes Emissary to %SYSTEM%\\WSPsvc.dll and installs it as a service,**\n\n**which will run the exported function “ServiceMain” within the Emissary Trojan to carry out its**\n\n**functionality.**\n\n**Configuration data is stored in the last 1024 bytes of the payload, from which the Trojan will**\n\n**extract an 896 byte structure.

For instance, during the analysis period, the installation**\n\n**code changed the following registry key of the AppMgmt:**\n\n**1** **HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppMgmt\\Parameters\\ServiceDll**\n\n**to**\n\n**1** **HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppMgmt\\Parameters\\ServiceDll**\n\n**If the user does not have permissions to add a service, the installation routine attempts to add**\n\n**persistence by creating the following registry key that will run the functional code within**\n\n**Emissary via an exported function named “DllRegister”:**\n\n**1** **Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Resolves: \"Rundll32.ex**\n\n**This version of emissary has its configuration appended to the end of the DLL, specifically**\n\n**starting at offset 0xc600.

This blog provides a great analysis of this version of Emissary and we**\n\n**highly suggest reading it to become familiar with the Trojan.**\n\n**There is one difference in the functional code between Emissary versions 5.3 and 5.4, which**\n\n**involves the removal of the command ‘107’ used to update the Trojan. The string ‘107’ still exists**\n\n**within the Trojan, however, the command handler does not check the C2 response for this**\n\n**command and the code used to update the Trojan has been removed.**\n\n**The major difference between Emissary version 5.4 and all previous versions is how the Trojan**\n\n**is saved and loaded. First, the filenames of the various components of Emissary changed to the**\n\n**following; however, the filename for debug logs has not changed:**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n**4**\n**5**\n**6**\n**7**\n\n\n**%APPDATA%\\Programs\\Syncmgr.dll -> Loader** **Trojan**\n\n**%APPDATA%\\Programs\\60HGBC00.DAT -> Configuration** **File**\n\n**%APPDATA%\\Programs\\WEB2013BW6.DAT -> Emissary** **Trojan**\n\n**%TEMP%\\000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP -> Log file**\n\n\n**In addition to file name changes, the biggest (pardon the pun) change involves the Loader**\n\n**Trojan (Syncmgr.dll) appending junk data to the end of the Emissary DLL file to make incredibly**\n\n**large files. The reason for creating such large files is to trick antivirus applications into not**\n\n**scanning the file, as it could exceed the maximum size of files the antivirus can scan (even**\n\n**VirusTotal has a maximum file size of 128MB). For instance, the following pseudo code contains**\n\n**two loops that will end up appending 524,288,000 bytes to the end of file, resulting in a DLL that**\n\n**exceeds 500MB in size:**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n**4**\n**5**\n**6**\n**7**\n**8**\n**9**\n**10**\n**11**\n**12**\n**13**\n**14**\n**15**\n**16**\n**17**\n**18**\n\n\n**WriteFile(hFile,** **buf_EmissaryDllFromResource,** **nNumberOfBytesToWrite**\n**buf_junkData = 0;**\n**ret_time = time(0);**\n**srand(ret_time);**\n**for** **(** **i = 0;** **i < 51200; ++i** **)**\n**{**\n**for** **(** **j = 0;** **j < 640; ++j** **)**\n**{**\n**random_byte = rand() % 255;**\n**offset_in_buff_junkData = &buf_junkData + 16 * j;**\n**dword_junkData = 0x1010101 * random_byte;**\n***offset_in_buff_junkData = dword_junkData;**\n***(offset_in_buff_junkData + 1) = dword_junkData;**\n***(offset_in_buff_junkData + 2) = dword_junkData;**\n***(offset_in_buff_junkData + 3) = dword_junkData;**\n**}**\n**WriteFile(hFile, &buf_junkData,** **0x2800u, &nNumberOfBytesToWrite,**\n**}**\n\n\n**With the new filenames, malware persistence is achieved via the following registry key:**\n\n**1** **HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Syncmgr: \"rundll3**\n\n**Date: 11/24/2015**\n\n**SHA256: bfceccdd553c7e26006bb044ea6d87e597c7cce08218068e31dc940e9f55b636 (Base**\n\n**DLL with junk data removed)**\n\n**Original Name: WinDLL.dll**\n\n**In another attempt to avoid detection based on PE header hashes, the Trojan was recompiled**\n\n**without making any changes.**\n\n**The actors using Emissary, who were previously reported as behind Operation Lotus Blossom,**\n\n**have been active for at least seven years in Southeast Asia.

This**\n\n**indicates the threat actors may take note of threat intelligence reporting and are fully capable of**\n\n**making immediate changes when deemed necessary.**\n\n**In addition to the malware evolution, the actors also shifted from solely spear-phishing targets**\n\n**with attachments to also compromising legitimate websites to host malware. The consistent**\n\n**updates to the Trojan and the shift in the actor’s TTPs suggests that this threat will continue to**\n\n**use Emissary in future espionage related attacks.**\n\n**[We have updated the Emissary tag for Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus users to track this threat](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Emissary)**\n\n**using the indicators discussed in this blog.**\n\n**42b8898c07374b1fc6a4a33441aadf10e47f226d9d3bf3368a459c0e221dff73**\n\n**37f752f89b0384291af23542efc08c01be962c04e3b2c881a8bc1f8771e9179f**\n\n**52b7f93bd4c2d1b1818f2a9506551852e2e7b511c9298e71edb54a39f69f94f2**\n\n**5cda2251059c34f55ac23941b56e248b9a1111e98f62c5a307eadbb9618592dd**\n\n**70097adba2743653bc73d0a2909a13f2904dbbcc1ffdb4e9013a8e61866abf5c**\n\n**9bb0288f7b98fac909ed91ec24dad0d5a31e3eec93a1641849d9dab56c23aa59**\n\n**b201c89fd7bdfc625bacfd4850feaa81269d9b41ed10ba1f7c0cb1339f4a6abe**\n\n**ddbe42fb03bf9f4b9144396e814f13cd7054dcf238234dcb838fa9643136c03a**\n\n**e67d3cc1684c789c3bd02af7a68b783fd90dc6d2d660b174d533f4c0e07490f9**\n\n**0c550fad82f2653bc13d9629357a2a56df82602ee0ce96aa5a31f885e3aa29df**\n\n**f36b7f63f46ae6afe8882b34c1ec11597c8537a3a7fa8b6521a83308940cc77b**\n\n**fdcd10a2c2bf802ba5b6be55c16c0bf407bcbee902b66466b0f954d2951fad2d**\n\n**da29b647411153b49cbf4df862e3f36209eafb8ebe8b966429edec4fb15dbce9**\n\n**721676d529a0c439594502f1d53fec697adc80fa1301d2bf20c2600d99ceed4e**\n\n**0069029ee4029df88f700da335a06e0e3a534a94552fe966186166b526a20b6a**\n\n**9420017390c598ee535c24f7bcbd39f40eca699d6c94dc35bcf59ddf918c59ab**\n\n**26e2f4f9026f19156a73ffbfde438916f24d80b8812b6cebe98167eb9be0863c**\n\n**8e3b7dc3dca92d7458265e2bcd69caa558cbbf24bbbf1200b9aa924260c42480**\n\n**e817610b62ccd00bdfc9129f947ac7d078d97525e9628a3aa61027396dba419b**\n\n**02831316a3a04c1248605f28fb08d810230dd4411b2a1fc8187508aea6b449c5**\n\n**675869fac21a94c8f470765bc6dd15b17cc4492dd639b878f241a45b2c3890fc**\n\n**70561f58c9e5868f44169854bcc906001947d98d15e9b4d2fbabd1262d938629**\n\n**925d2f960d8db0510f3681c038311c0c2df86c5ba03f8cb61e3c8846c31bd6e1**\n\n**98fb1d2975babc18624e3922406545458642e01360746870deee397df93f50e0**\n\n**a8b0d084949c4f289beb4950f801bf99588d1b05f68587b245a31e8e82f7a1b8**\n\n**b07fbb92484fd2aff6d28f0ab04d5f51e96420b6d670f921b0bbe0e5392da408**\n\n**c72b07f2a423abc4fc45dfddc5162b8eb1ea97d5b5e66811526433f09b6cdf41**\n\n**dd8ffb9f961299f7cc9cb51e17a5cccf79b7fb583e594b05ef93b54c8cad54f6**\n\n**fbcb401cf06326ab4bb53fb9f01f1ca647f16f926811ea66984f1a1b8cf2f7bb**\n\n**e21b47dfa9e250f49a3ab327b7444902e545bed3c4dcfa5e2e990af20593af6d**\n\n\n-----\n\n**e6c4611b1399ada920730686395d6fc1700fc39add3d0d40b4f784ccb6ad0c30**\n\n**931a1284b11a3997c7a99076d582ed3436aa30409dc73bd763436dddd490f9cb**\n\n**5edf2d0270f8e7eb5be3476802e46c578c4afc4b046411be0806b9acc3bfa099**\n\n**9dab2d1b16eb0fb4ec2095d4b4e2a3ad67a707ab4f54f9c26539619691f103f3**\n\n**dcbeca8c92d6d18f2faf385e677913dc8abac3fa3303c1f5cfe166180cffbed3**\n\n**5171c9a593389011da4d72125e52bf7ef86b2da7fcd6c2a2bc95467afe6a1b58**\n\n**70bed57bc3484fe5dbcf3c732bd7b11f80a742138f4733bc7e9b6d03e721da4a**\n\n**c145bb2e4ce77c79aa01de2aec4a8b5b0b680e23bceda2c230903b5f0e119634**\n\n**375190cc8e0e75cf771d66347ea2a04b6d1b59bf2f56823eb81270618f133e2d**\n\n**e369417a7623d73346f6dff729e68f7e057f7f6dae7bb03d56a7510cb3bfe538**\n\n**29d8dc863427c8e37b75eb738069c2172e79607acc7b65de6f8086ba36abf051**\n\n**46ad72811990c1937d26e1f80ec1b9def8c112817f4bb9f94e3d1e4f0fb86f80**\n\n**bfceccdd553c7e26006bb044ea6d87e597c7cce08218068e31dc940e9f55b636**\n\n**731cd2ce87f4c4375782de0686b5b16619f8fa2de188522cbc8e64f8851bb7ed**\n\n**acf7dc5a10b00f0aac102ecd9d87cd94f08a37b2726cb1e16948875751d04cc9**\n\n**http://101.55.121[.]79/lightserver/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://101.55.33[.]92/default.aspx**\n\n**http://101.55.33[.]92:80/default.aspx**\n\n**http://101.55.33[.]95:80/default.aspx**\n\n**http://103.243.24[.]179/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://118.193.221[.]233:80/default.aspx**\n\n**http://123.1.159[.]153/lightserver/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://123.1.159[.]210/lightserver/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://140.131.39[.]11/icanxp/help/help/default.aspx**\n\n**http://163.20.127[.]27/0test/test/default.aspx**\n\n**http://203.124.14[.]214/default.aspx**\n\n**http://203.124.14[.]229/default.aspx**\n\n**http://210.209.121[.]31/lightserver/default.aspx**\n\n**http://210.209.121[.]92/lightserver/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://210.209.121[.]92/weboffice/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://appletree.onthenetas[.]com/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://bluefield.byinter[.]net/lightserver/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://booking.passinggas[.]net/lightserver/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://chairman.OnTheNetAs[.]com/weboffice/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://dnt5b.myfw[.]us/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://dnt5b.myfw[.]us/default.aspx**\n\n**http://eventlog.findhere[.]org/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://grassland.OnTheNetAs[.]com/lightserver/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://groupspace.findhere[.]org/lightserver/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://photograph.myfw[.]us/lightserver/default.aspx**\n\n**http://ustar5.PassAs[.]us/Default.aspx**\n\n**http://ustar5.PassAs[.]us/default.aspx**\n\n**http://webonline.OnTheNetAs[.]com/lightserver/default.aspx**\n\n**http://www.danangqt[.]net:80/default.aspx**\n\n**http://zooboo.PassingGas[.]net/weboffice/Default.aspx**\n\n**3test**\n\n**FJ201508**\n\n**lyk_WW**\n\n**A-1117a**\n\n**QPR-Z0330**\n\n**YUIO**\n\n**ZGP-M**\n\n**xman**\n\n**A-1117a**\n\n**Flash**\n\n\
