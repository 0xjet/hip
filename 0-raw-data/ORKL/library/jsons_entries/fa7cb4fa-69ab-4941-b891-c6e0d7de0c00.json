In\nregard to the attack lifecycle, development of tools occurs in the weaponization/staging\nphase that precedes the delivery phase, of which is typically the first opportunity we see the\nactors’ activities as they interact directly with their target. We have been presented with a\nrare opportunity to see some development activities from the actors associated with the\n[OilRig attack campaign, a campaign Unit 42 has been following since May 2016. Recently](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/oilrig-attacks/)\nwe were able to observe these actors making modifications to their ClaySlide delivery\ndocuments in an attempt to evade antivirus detection.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have identified two separate testing efforts carried out by the OilRig actors, one occurring\nin June and one in November of 2016. The sample set associated with each of these testing\nactivities is rather small, but the changes made to each of the files give us a chance to\nunderstand what modifications the actor performs in an attempt to evade detection. This\ntesting activity also suggests that the threat group responsible for the OilRig attack campaign\nhave an organized, professional operations model that includes a testing component to the\ndevelopment of their tools.\n\n## Testing Activity, Analysis, and Methodology\n\nWe collected two sets of ClaySlide samples that appear to be created during the OilRig\nactor’s development phase of their attack lifecycle. The threat actor uploaded each of these\nfiles to a popular antivirus testing website to find out which vendors detected the file. The\nactor then made subtle modifications to the file and uploaded the newly created file to the\nsame popular antivirus testing website in order to determine how to evade detection. The\nflowchart in Figure 1explains the process in which the threat actors followed during their\ntesting activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Flowchart describing the testing process carried out by OilRig actor_\n\nLucky for us, the threat actors do not modify the metadata within their delivery documents,\nwhich allows us to determine when the actor last modified each Word document. These\nuntainted timestamps allow us to create a timeline that we can use to order the files as they\nwere created by the actor. Our analysis methodology involves iteratively comparing each file\nwith the next file in the timeline to determine the changes the actor made to the first file that\nresulted in the creation of the second file.\n\nThe first testing activity we observed began with an initial sample created on June 13, 2016\nwith 17 subsequent files created for testing purposes that the actor created in a two-hour\nperiod on June 15, 2016. Table 1shows the samples we observed associated with the June\n2016 testing activity, including the iteration, the last modified timestamp, the hash, the\nfilename, and the antivirus detection rate of the newly created file. The first “ttt.xls” file and\nthe files with incrementing filenames have the same decoy contents, which is the reason we\n\n\n-----\n\ninitially included this sample with this group despite the difference in naming. Also, the\nfilename “ttt.xls” contains the acronym for “to the top”, which is common usage in Internet\nforums and could depict the actor starting testing activities.\n\n**Iteration** **Modified** **SHA256** **Filename** **AV**\n\nBase 2016:06:13 05:28:32 742a52084162d3789e19... ttt.xls 4\n\n1 2016:06:15 05:24:25 f1de7b941817438da2a4... 1.xls 6\n\n2 2016:06:15 05:28:11 b142265bb4b902837d83... 2.xls 0\n\n3 2016:06:15 05:30:45 2e226a0210a123ad8288... 3.xls 2\n\n4 2016:06:15 05:33:11 299bc738d7b0292820d9... 4.xls 4\n\n5 2016:06:15 05:39:55 6e62308b94455569b8a1... 5.xls 2\n\n6 2016:06:15 05:42:20 d64b46cf42ea4a7bf291... 6.xls 1\n\n7 2016:06:15 05:47:09 77f8a267357a8d237e0b... 8.xls 1\n\n8 2016:06:15 05:52:50 92f429b6f9b8031b5fc6... 9.xls 3\n\n9 2016:06:15 05:55:01 c2a386723d8f203e1228... 10.xls 2\n\n10 2016:06:15 05:57:50 2fb6bce8fc2f531de183... 11.xls 2\n\n11 2016:06:15 06:00:24 75b033a40a756e2536d0... 12.xls 2\n\n12 2016:06:15 06:10:46 8bb8f2bada27d14be021... 13.xls 1\n\n13 2016:06:15 06:13:30 3af6dfa4cebd82f48b66... 14.xls 2\n\n14 2016:06:15 06:16:27 82239a4e18a67f7b2ba0... 15.xls 2\n\n15 2016:06:15 06:19:45 938101a1a336ce0fff57... 16.xls 2\n\n16 2016:06:15 07:02:49 5e9ddb25bde3719c392d... ttt.xls 4\n\n17 2016:06:15 07:39:53 4190a8b8e6fa7bc37712... ttt.xls 0\n\n_Table 1 Samples associated with the June 2016 testing activities_\n\nThe second testing activity of ClaySlide delivery documents began with the actor creating a\nbase sample on November 14, 2016, followed by six subsequent test files created within a\n30-minute window on the following day. Table 2 shows the pertinent information related to\nthe ClaySlide testing activity that occurred in November 2016. Again, there was an obvious\ndifference in filenames at the beginning of this activity, but we included the first two samples\n\n\n-----\n\nin with this group based on the first two files initially sharing decoy contents, but more\nimportantly sharing the same macro code and payload scripts as the initial testing sample\nwith the filename of “weak.xls”.\n\n**Iteration** **Modified** **SHA256** **Filename** **AV**\n\nBase 2016:11:14 04:15:57 ae40262d5fad4bc48066...

Before reviewing the activities performed in the two testing sessions, the\nfollowing high level observations can be made:\n\nPatterns in filenames emerge, with testing files having the same word or incrementing\nnumbers for the filenames, or a set of testing files sharing the same exact filename\nVery structured approach, using a baseline test sample followed by small iterative\nchanges\nActor may also revert back to the baseline test sample and continue testing\nChanges made only a few minutes apart and can involve:\n\nRemoval or location change of payload\nModified decoy contents and sheet names\nChanges to function and variable names\nRemoval of entire lines of code\nObfuscating strings via concatenation or an alternate encoding (base64 or\nhexadecimal)\nReordering of functions in the code\nIn many cases, testing files are no longer functional due to:\n\nRemoval of a required component(s)\nReplacement of variables with nonsensical values\nUse of encoded strings without ability to decode\nTesting activities ceases with a very low antivirus detection rate\n\n\n-----\n\nThe number of vendors detecting the samples increases and decrease throughout the\ntesting as the actor attempts to determine what the detection signatures are triggering\non\n\n## June 2016 Testing Activity\n\nIn June 2016, an actor related to the OilRig campaign began a series of testing activities in\nan attempt to determine the portions of the ClaySlide macro code that antivirus vendors were\nusing for detection purposes. These activities resulted in 17 different iterations of the\nClaySlide delivery document, many of which no longer run properly due to the changes\nmade within the files. We have included an exhaustive analysis of the June 2016 testing\nactivity in Appendix A.\n\nIn the June testing, the actor started by removing the malicious payload from the Excel\ndelivery document to focus their testing on the malicious macro. The actor made many\niterative changes during their testing of the macro, however, the actor began these changes\nby completely removing a block of the code that was responsible for saving the payload to\nthe system and for creating the scheduled task to run the payload. The removal of this code\nbrought the detection rate to 0, which told the actor that the antivirus detection rules were\ndetecting these files based on these lines of code. The actor spent most of their subsequent\nefforts modifying portions of this code.\n\nNow that the actor knew the portion of the code that caused antivirus detection, the actor\nadded that portion of the code back to the macro and made changes in attempt to determine\nthe exact line of code that was detected. This process involved changing the commands\nused to create the payload and the scheduled task. The changes made to these two\ncommands involved their complete removal, their replacement with non-functioning strings\nsuch as keyboard mashing and their equivalent strings in a variety of different encodings,\nincluding base64 and hexadecimal representation. The actor also changed the way these\ncommands were executed as well, specifically by either using the WScript.Shell object\ndirectly or the object stored in a variable. The actor also uses intentional misspelling of\ncommands, such as “poawearshell” and “scshtassks”, as well as variations to the filenames\nfor the payloads, such as “firaeeye.vbs” instead of “fireeye.vbs”.\n\nAfter making changes to the commands above, the actor shifted their focus onto changing\nthe function names within the macro, which did not result in any change in the detection rate.\nAfter a 40-minute break, it appears the actor reverts to the base macro instead of modifying\nthe previously created test file. Again, the actor modifies the code in the base macro\nresponsible for saving and running the payload, but this time the actor changes the folder\nnames it creates for the payload to store its generated files. Also, the two files generated\nduring these activities that occurred after the actor reverted back to the base macro had\nkeyboard-mashed strings for their decoy contents, which differed dramatically from the\nprevious test files. During the entirety of this testing activity, the antivirus detection rate\nreached a high of 6 but ended with a zero vendors detecting the sample when the actor\n\n\n-----\n\nceased testing activities, which suggests that the actor was satisfied with this result.\nHowever, we do not see conclusive evidence to suggest that the actor was attempting to\nevade a specific antivirus vendor.\n\n## November 2016 Testing Activity\n\nOn November 15, 2016, an actor related to the OilRig campaign began testing the ClaySlide\ndelivery documents. While the testing activities in June began with the removal of the\npayloads from the delivery document, the files generated during the November testing all\nretained their Helminth payloads, all of which were the same payload that use the C2 domain\nof “updateorg[.]com”. We have included an exhaustive analysis of the November 2016\ntesting activity in Appendix B.\n\nIn the November testing, the actor appears to initially focus on making modifications to the\nExcel worksheet that contains the decoy contents. The changes made to the worksheet\ninvolved adding random strings to cells within the decoy, to changing the names of the\nworksheets themselves. Eventually, the actor completely changes the contents of the decoy\nto a different theme entirely, from a decoy containing routing settings to a list of weak\npasswords.\n\nIn addition to making changes to the Excel worksheets that contain the decoy content, the\nactor also made changes to the worksheet that is initially displayed to the user. Taking a step\n[back, as discussed in the Appendix in our initial OilRig blog, ClaySlide delivery documents](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/the-oilrig-campaign-attacks-on-saudi-arabian-organizations-deliver-helminth-backdoor/)\ninitially open with a worksheet named “Incompatible” that displays content that instructs the\nuser to “Enable Content” to see the contents of the document, which in fact runs the\nmalicious macro and compromises the system. When the macro runs, it hides the\n“Incompatible” worksheet and displays the worksheet that contains the decoy document. The\nactor modified the “Incompatible” worksheet to include random strings, which appears to be\nan attempt to see if detection rules are using the hash of this sheet for detection purposes.\n\nMeanwhile, during these changes to the “Incompatible” worksheet, the actor is also making\nchanges to the malicious macro as well. The actor began changing the function names in the\nmalicious macro from “Doom_Init” and “Doom_ShowHideSheets” to “Doon_Init” and\n“Doon_SHSheet” to “Ini” and “SHSheet”. At one point, the actor changed the order of the\nfunctions in the macro to see if it was the cause of detection. The actor also changed the\nvariable name used to store the VB script used to run the Helminth payload from\n“BackupVbs” to “Backup_Vbs”.\n\nAnother change made during these testing activities involved the actor splitting the command\nneeded to create the scheduled task in several strings and concatenating them back\ntogether. This technique is interesting, as the resulting command is still functional which\ndiffers dramatically from the modifications seen in the June testing where the commands\nwere changed to a point where they were no longer operational.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe last change made to the malicious macro is the locations in which the macro obtains the\npayload. In all ClaySlide delivery documents, the macro obtains scripts related to the\nHelminth Trojan from specific cells within the “Incompatible” worksheet. By changing the cells\ncontaining the scripts, the actor is checking to see if detection rules are looking for scripts at\nthese specific locations. By the time the threat actor ceased this testing activity, the actor had\nlowered the detection rate of the ClaySlide delivery document to 2, suggesting this was a\nsatisfactory result. Like the June testing activity, we do not see conclusive evidence of the\nthreat actor attempting to evade a specific antivirus vendor in the November testing.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe threat actors involved with the OilRig attack campaign have shown part of their playbook\nthat involves testing and modifying their delivery documents prior to use in attacks. The\npurpose of these modifications is to evade detection from security products to extend the\nusage of their ClaySlide delivery documents. By analyzing these testing activities, we gain\nsome helpful insight into the OilRig actors, specifically that this threat group is fairly mature\nfrom an operational standpoint and the fact that they hope to use their delivery documents as\nlong as possible.\n\nWe were already aware of this threat group making modifications to their ClaySlide delivery\n[document that we discussed in our previous blog. Now we know that there is an organized](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/10/unit42-oilrig-malware-campaign-updates-toolset-and-expands-targets/)\nprocess involved that results in these changes, rather than the threat actor arbitrarily making\nchanges to parts of the delivery documents, such as filenames and payload behavior. This\nrealization suggests that the OilRig threat group will continue to use their delivery documents\nfor extended periods with subtle modifications to remain effective.\n\n## Appendix A\n\nThis appendix contains an in-depth analysis of each iteration of testing activity carried out by\nthe OilRig actors in June 2016. We provide screenshots and diffs between files (when\navailable) to visualize the modifications made during the iteration.\n\n**Iteration 1**\n\nThe actor removed all but three bytes from the VBS and PowerShell scripts, while the macro\nitself remains unchanged. This suggests that the delivery document no longer contains the\nmalicious payload (Helminth scripts) used to infect the system. By removing the payload\nfrom the delivery document, the actor can isolate antivirus detection results based on the\ndelivery document itself. Also, without the payload the samples no longer have some\nattributes and entities that security researchers typically use to correlate samples to a\nspecific threat group, such as the C2 server of “update-kernal[.]net” that was in the payload\nin the base sample.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the payload removed, the actor focuses their efforts in subsequent iterations on\nmodifying the macro within the delivery document.\n\n**Iteration 2**\n\nThe actor completely removed code that is responsible for a majority of the functionality\nwithin the macro. The code removed, as seen in Figure 2, is responsible for the following:\n\n1. Creating folders\n\n1. \\Libraries\\up\n2. \\Libraries\\dn\n3. \\Libraries\\tp\n2. Running a PowerShell command to create\n\n1. PowerShell script\n2. VB script\n3. Running a command to create a scheduled task to run the VB script\n\n_Figure 2 Changes made in Iteration 2_\n\n**Iteration 3**\n\nThe actor adds the content removed in the previous iteration. However, the line of code\nresponsible for running the command to create the scheduled task to run the VB script was\nomitted. This suggests the threat actor was testing to see if vendors were detecting\nClaySlide samples based on this line within the macro.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Changes made in Iteration 3_\n\n**Iteration 4**\n\nThe actor adds the line of code omitted from the previous iteration, suggesting this specific\ncode was not used for detection purposes. The actor also changed the method in which it\ncalls the PowerShell script in the “cmd” variable, by using a “WScript.Shell” object stored in\nthe “wss” variable instead of creating a new “WScript.Shell” object.\n\n_Figure 4 Changes made in Iteration 4_\n\n**Iteration 5**\n\nThe actor base64 encoded the contents of the ‘cmd’ variable that stored a command to\ninvoke a PowerShell script that would save the payload to the filesystem. Also, the actor\nchanged the command to create the scheduled task to be base64 encoded as well. These\nalterations do not come with a base64 decoding routine, suggesting that the sample\ngenerated in this iteration would result in an error. The lack of a decoding routine suggests\nthat the actor does not waste time making sure the code actually works, as they could add\ncode to support these changes.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 Changes made in Iteration 5_\n\n**Iteration 6**\n\nThe actor tests to see if the base64 encoded strings added in the previous iteration were\ndetected by removing these strings and leaving the two command strings empty.\n\n_Figure 6 Changes made in Iteration 6_\n\n**Iteration 7**\n\nThe actor adds the base64 encoded string for “powershell.exe” within the ‘cmd’ variable and\nin place of the command to create the scheduled task.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 Changes made in Iteration 7_\n\n**Iteration 8**\n\nThe actor replaces the first base64 for “powershell.exe” with the base64 encoded string to\nrun the PowerShell command, but replaces the second “powershell.exe” with the cleartext\nstring to create the scheduled task. The base64 encoded PowerShell command is similar to\nthose seen in previous iterations. However, the actor changed one of the filenames used to\nsave the payload to “firaeeye.vbs” (from “fireeye.vbs”) and references a variable named\n“FireeayeVbs” (from “FireeyeVbs”) that does not appear in the code.\n\n_Figure 8 Changes made in Iteration 8_\n\n**Iteration 9**\n\nThe actor replaces the cleartext string to create the scheduled task with the base64 encoded\nversion of the string. However, the base64 encoded string changes the name of the created\ntask from “GoogleUpdatesTaskMachineUI” to “GoosgleUpdatesTaskMachineUI” and the\nscript name from “fireeye.vbs” to \"fireeyse.vbs\".\n\n_Figure 9 Changes made in Iteration 9_\n\n**Iteration 10**\n\nThe actor makes changes to the base64 encoded strings that used as a command to use\nPowerShell to install the payload and to schedule a task to run the payload. The base64\nencoded PowerShell command reintroduces the filename “fireeye vbs” and the variable\n\n\n-----\n\nname FireeyeVbs, both of which were changed in iteration 8; however, the base64 encoded\ncommand uses the string “poawearshell” instead of “powershell”.\n\nAs for the base64 string used to create the scheduled task, the actor reintroduced the\nscheduled task name of “GoogleUpdatesTaskMachineUI” and script filename of “fireeye.vbs”,\nwhich were changed in iteration 9. However, the actor uses the string “scshtassks” to see if\nthe “schtasks” string was being detected.\n\n_Figure 10 Changes made in Iteration 10_\n\n**Iteration 11**\n\nThe actor changed the base64 encoded strings within the ‘cmd’ variable and the string used\nto create the scheduled task. Instead of including the base64 encoded string of the\nPowerShell and create task command, the actor replaced these strings with the base64\nencoded representation of the following string:\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nsource code from https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threatresearch/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.htmlsource code from\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threatresearch/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.htmlsource code from\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.htmlsource\ncode from https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threatresearch/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.htmlsource code from\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.htmlsource\ncode from https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threatresearch/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.htmlsource code from\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html\n\n\n[The string above contains a link to a FireEye blog that provided an analysis of this delivery](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html)\ndocument. It should be noted that the following non-encoded string was included in previous\nsamples as a comment within the macro:\n\n'source code from https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threatresearch/2016/05/tareted_attacksaga.html\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 Changes made in Iteration 11_\n\n**Iteration 12**\n\nThe actor replaced the base64 strings within the ‘cmd’ variable and the string to create the\nscheduled task with randomly typed letters. It appears the actor performed two-handed\nkeyboard mashing to generate the strings used in these variables.\n\n_Figure 12 Changes made in Iteration 12_\n\n**Iteration 13**\n\nThe actor changed the randomly typed keys in the ‘cmd’ and the string for creating the\nscheduled task with the base64 strings from two iterations back. However, the base64\nstrings were added between opening and closing brackets.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13 Changes made in Iteration 13_\n\n**Iteration 14**\n\nThe actor changed the base64 encoded strings used for the PowerShell command and the\ncommand to create a scheduled task from the last iteration to a hexadecimal string. The\nstring contains the hexadecimal representation of the characters that make up the command\nto create the scheduled task, which was last seen in Iteration 4. Again, the script does not\ncontain decoding functions to decode the hexadecimal values to the correct characters,\ntherefore this script is not functional.\n\n_Figure 14 Changes made in Iteration 14_\n\n**Iteration 15**\n\nThe actor changed the two function names that are run when the Excel document is opened.\nIn all prior iterations, these function names were “fireeye_Init” and\n“fireeye_ShowHideSheets”, which are responsible for installing the Trojan and displaying the\ndecoy contents within the Excel spreadsheet, respectively. The actor changed these two\nfunction names to “fireeye_Init2” and “fireeye_ShowHideSheets3” to determine if the function\nnames were being detected by antivirus products.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15 Changes made in Iteration 15_\n\n**Iteration 16**\n\nThis iteration is very interesting, as we believe the actor reverts back to the base document\ninstead of making changes to the document created in the previous iteration.\n\nThe filename changed from an incrementing number to “ttt.xls”, which is the same filename\nas the base document. Also, when we compared the sample from the previous iteration,\nthere were a number of changes seen here:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16 Changes made in Iteration 16 if compared with the file in Iteration 15_\n\nHowever, if you compare the file created in this iteration with the base file, the number of and\ntype of changes seem to align closer to the modifications performed in previous iterations. If\nthe actor reverted to the base document as we suspect, then modifications were made to the\nscript filename, the folder names that store files generated by the payload, as well as the\nmethod the script invokes the PowerShell script. The actor changed the script filename from\n“fireeye.vbs” to “fireueye.vbs”, changed the “up”, “dn” and “tp” folder names to “uup”, “dgn”\nand “tup” and uses the “WScript.Shell” object stored in the “wss” variable instead of creating\na new “WScript.Shell” object to run the command.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17 Changes made in Iteration 16 if actor reverted to the base file_\n\n**Iteration 17**\n\nIn the last iteration of this testing activity, the actor changed some of the modifications made\nin the previous iteration back to the values used in the base document, specifically the\nfilenames and folder names. However, the actor also adds a new variable to store the\n“%PUBLIC%” environment variable that the script uses as the path to store the “fireeye.vbs”\nscript and the folders that the payload would use. This iteration also includes a modified\nPowerShell command that attempts to run a command stored in the “fireeye.vbs” file, but\ndoes not include the portion of the command that would write the script to that file. The actor\nalso removed the line that would run the command to create the scheduled task to run the\nVB script.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18 Changes made in Iteration 17_\n\n## Appendix B\n\nThis appendix contains an in-depth analysis of each iteration of testing activity carried out by\nthe OilRig actors in November 2016. We provide screenshots and diffs between files (when\navailable) to visualize the modifications made during the iteration.\n\n**Iteration 1**\n\nIn the first iteration of this testing, the actor changed the decoy content from the base\nsample. At a high level, the decoy contents contained commands to configure a Cisco router\nwith static routes and other settings. Originally, the base test file used in this testing activity\ncontained just these configuration settings in an Excel worksheet named “Sheet1”, as seen\nin Figure 19.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19 Original decoy contents found in the base test file_\n\nIn the first iteration of testing, the actor changed the worksheet name that contains the decoy\ncontent from “Sheet1” to “hgvc” and added a string to the worksheet “jgvchhctf”, as seen in\nFigure 20. We believe the threat actor is attempting to determine if the worksheet name or\nthe hash of the decoy worksheet were causing antivirus detection.\n\n_Figure 20 Changes made to the decoy contents in Iteration 1_\n\n**Iteration 2**\n\nThe actor then changed the name of the worksheet that contains the decoy content from\n“hgcv” to “table” and completely changed the decoy content from the Cisco routing settings\nto a list of weak passwords, as seen in Figure 21. We believe this is the threat actor testing\nthe new decoy content that they will use in an upcoming attack\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21 New decoy contents introduced in Iteration 2_\n\n**Iteration 3**\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing the lead of previous iterations, the actor made modifications to the content in the\nExcel worksheet; however, in this iteration the changes were not made to the decoy\nworksheet, rather the change was made to the initial worksheet called “Incompatible” that\ndisplays the message to instruct the user to enable content to run the macro. As seen in\nFigure 22, the actor adds the string “yy” to this worksheet to determine whether antivirus\nvendors were detecting Clayslide documents based on this worksheet.\n\n_Figure 22 Changes made to the Incompatible worksheet in Iteration 3_\n\nThe actor also made modifications to the macro in this iteration, specifically by changing\nfunction names and by splitting up strings and concatenating them back together. The\nfunction names in the macro “Doom_Init” and “Doom_ShowHideSheets” were changed to\n“Doon_Init” and “Doon_SHSheet” to determine if these function names were causing\ndetection. Also, the actor split the word “powershell” in the commands within the macro and\nconcatenated them together to retain functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 23 Changes made to the macro in Iteration 3_\n\n**Iteration 4**\n\nMuch like the previous iteration, the threat actor makes changes to the Incompatible\nworksheet and the code within the macro. First, the threat actor added the string “hi” to two\ncells within the initially displayed Incompatible worksheet, as seen in Figure 24.\n\n_Figure 24 Changes made to the Incompatible worksheet in Iteration 4_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe actor also made modifications to the macro in this iteration, as seen in Figure 25. The\nactor changed the two function names from “Doon_Ini” and “Doon_SHSheet” to “Ini” and\n“SHSheet” respectively. Also, the actor changed the variable name that stores the VB script\nobtained from the spreadsheet from “BackupVbs” to “Backup_Vbs”, and modified the\nPowerShell command to use this new variable as well. Lastly, the actor further split the name\nof the created task using concatenation to retain functionality.\n\n_Figure 25 Changes made to the macro in Iteration 4_\n\n**Iteration 5**\n\nIn this iteration, the actor rearranges the order of the functions in the script, specifically\nputting the “Ini” function before the “SHSheet” function. Figure 26 shows this function\nreordering.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 26 Changes made to the macro within Iteration 5_\n\n**Iteration 6**\n\nIn the final iteration of testing, the actor moves the base64 encoded VB Script and the two\nbase64 encoded PowerShell scripts to three different cells within the Incompatible\nworksheet. The actor also changes the macro to access the base64 encoded strings from\nthese new locations, which retains the functionality of this document.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 27 Changes made to the macro in Iteration 6_\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
