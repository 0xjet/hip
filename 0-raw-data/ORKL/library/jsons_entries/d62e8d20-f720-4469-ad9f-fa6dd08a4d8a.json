Cisco Talos recently\ndiscovered a malware campaign that does not fit in any of the two categories. This\nactor has a relatively low volume of recovered samples, which makes it difficult to\ndecide whether the campaigns are carefully targeted or mass-spammed.\nCisco Talos recently discovered a series of low volume email campaigns we're calling\n\"Fajan,\" targeting users with Bloomberg BNA-based email messages since at least\nMarch 2020.\n[These threats demonstrate several techniques of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, most](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n[notably Scripting - T1064, PowerShell -](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064/) [T1059.001, Process Injection -](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/) [T1055, Non](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)\nStandard Port - [T1571, Remote Access Software -](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571/) [T1219, Input Capture -](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219/) [T1056,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/)\nObfuscated Files or Information - [T1027 and Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder -](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)\n[T1547.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/)\n\nThe actor employs various methods to install and run a variant of either JavaScript- or\nVBScript-based remote access trojans (RATs). The command and control (C2) IP addresses\nof the script-based RATs are also shared with some other popular families such as Netwire\nRC and [Revenge RAT.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.revenge_rat)\n\n[In one instance, we also observed Nanocore RAT as the final payload with a C2 server IP](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.nanocore)\naddress shared with other RAT families such as [XpertRAT.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.xpertrat)\n\nThe campaigns are likely a work of a single actor that keeps experimenting with various\nTTPs to make the campaigns more difficult to detect and more successful.\n\n**What's new?**\n\nWe believe this is the first time anyone's documented Fajan's operations. The actor is\nactively maintaining the tools and has been active since March 2020. Based on the observed\nIOCs and TTPs, we have a moderate confidence that the actor is an Arabic-speaking person\nor group.\n\n**How did it work?**\n\nThe infection starts with an email containing a message which pretends to come from\nBloomberg's BNA division — a site dedicated to providing legal and regulatory information to\nprofessionals. The email contains an Excel spreadsheet as an attachment, containing macro\ncode to either download the next infection stage or drop and run the final payload.\n\nThe payload is always a RAT that allows the attacker to take control over the infected system\nusing HTTP over a non-standard TCP port.\n\nThe main payload is a JavaScript file, a VBScript file or a standard Windows PE binary.\n\n\n-----\n\n**So what?**\n\nThe actors behind Fajan campaigns are actively maintaining and developing functionality to\nmake the attacks more successful. The campaigns use email messages, which is still the\nmost commonly used vector in a successful compromise. The inclusion of remote access\ntrojans as payloads of the campaign indicate the actors may want to carry out surveillance\noperations or steal user data. The C2 servers were not responsive at the time of analysis\nand we could not discover the final objective of the campaigns.\n\n## Technical details\n\n**Email messages**\n\nAll Fajan email messages contain basic content that purportedly inform a subscriber of the\nBloomberg BNA service that they owe a payment to and includes an Excel spreadsheet as\nan attachment.\n\nThe attachment name always contains some form of the Bloomberg BNA Invoice name\ncombined with a random number specific for a particular campaign. Some early examples of\ncampaign email messages contain a second attachment containing a copy of the email body\ntext as a clean RTF file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example of an Fajan email campaign from April 2020._\n\nThe phone number included in Fajan's emails seems to be a private phone number located\nin New York, and is likely unrelated to the actor's true phone number.\n\n**Excel attachment VBA macro code**\n\nEach Bloomberg-themed campaign attachment contains VBA code that differs from other,\nsimilar campaigns. The changes may have been generated by an automated tool, and in\nsome instances, even coded by the actor.\n\nThe VBA code is lightly obfuscated to break the most obvious strings, such as the filenames.\nThe actors hope these small changes will be sufficient to make detection more difficult. One\nnotable feature of most Fajan droppers is that they place some of the content into the Excel\nspreadsheet cells which may make emulation of the code and detection more difficult.\nDefenders will sometimes only scan the contents of the usual macro streams to write their\ndetection, so placing it the cell could bypass this technique.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf an attachment contains VBA macro code, it s usually to drop and execute a JavaScript or a\nVBScript-based payload. The payloads are described later in this post and are rather simple\nRATs that connect to a hardcoded IP address and listen to commands sent using HTTP over\na non-standard TCP port number.\n\nThe first example is an automatically executed VBA macro that uses a combination of the\ncontent of the Excel cells and hardcoded strings to form the content of a JavaScript payload\n— jobswebsite.js. The payload is lightly obfuscated and can be easily deobfuscated with an\nemulator or by replacing the eval function with the function wscript.echo.\n\n_An example of VBA dropper dropping a JavaScript based payload._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Excel cells containing malicious code snippets used by VBA macros._\n\nThe second example we give here is a VBA dropper that drops and executes a VBScriptbased payload with the filename \"webstyle.vbs.\"\n\n_VBA macro to drop and execute webstyle.vbs._\n\nThe VBA macro code almost always ends with a snippet that deletes the cell contents\nhosting fragments of malicious code and adds additional, legitimate-looking content, to the\nfirst cells in an Excel worksheet. This means the VBA code will be rendered unusable after\nrunning once, but it makes the document slightly more difficult to discover.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Cleanup VBA code toward the end of the Workbook_Open function._\n\n**Excel 4.0 formula macros**\n\nApproximately 60 percent of the attachments use VBA to drop and run a malicious payload.\nThe rest of the attachments contain Excel 4.0 macro formulas designed to be executed when\nthe files are open. All of them contain a simple code to execute a PowerShell command line\nto download and execute the next stage from a Pastebin URL. The raw content of the\nPastebin URL is supplied as an argument to the Invoke-Expression (IEX) scriptlet, which\nexecutes the downloaded code in memory.\n\n_Excel 4.0 macro formula downloader code._\n\n**Intermediate stages**\n\nIt is not entirely clear why one or more intermediate stages are used, as the attacks can be\nstopped by blocking any individual stage. The more stages there are, the more likely the\ndetection will be effective. This may conceal the location of the final payload or to allow the\nactors the flexibility to change the payload by changing the content of intermediate stages.\n\n**Pastebins — simple PowerShell downloaders**\n\nAll of the retrieved Pastebins contain code to download and run a payload from a free filesharing site Top4top.io, all except one early example whose URL points to a payload hosted\nby the Amazon S3 service.\n\n\n-----\n\n_One outlier downloader from Pastebin with the payload hosted using the Amazon S3 storage_\n_service._\n\nTop4top.io is a free file-sharing site that is popular among users in Egypt, Algeria and\nYemen, according to its Cisco Umbrella domain requester distribution. Usually, Top4top\nURLs from the intermediate stages look like media file types but the downloaded files are\nVBScript-based payloads using filenames \"c.vbs\" or \"NoSleep.vbs\".\n\n_NoSleep.vbs, a final payload is downloaded from Top4Top.io._\n\nTop4Top.io seems to be aware of the frequent abuse of the site, as there is a dedicated\nsection for reporting it to the operators of the site, which is hosted by OVH.\n\n\n-----\n\n_In some cases, the Top4Top intermediate stage was already removed after an abuse report._\n\n**JavaScript payloads**\n\nA typical final payload dropped by Excel VBA code is a script file, which uses HTTP to\ncommunicate with the C2 server. The client collects some information about the infected\nsystem and uses the collected information as the User-Agent string in the HTTP header,\npresumably to keep the state for each individual infected system. The client uses nonstandard TCP ports such as 1111 and 1155 to communicate with the C2 server.\n\nThe client expects the C2 server to send commands and parameters in a HTTP response\nwith a typical command used to download and run additional modules from a URL. Here, we\nsee an example of the command \"RF,\" which is used to create another script file in the user's\nTemporary folder and run it using the run function of the Wscript.Shell ActiveX object.\n\n\n-----\n\n_A snippet of Fajan JavaScript RAT code._\n\nThe available commands in this JavaScript example are:\n\nSc: Download a script file into the user's Temp folder and run it.\nEx: Execute downloaded code using the eval function\nRF: Same as Sc\n\n**VBScript payloads**\n\nThe payload is a lightly obfuscated VBScript in the Pastebin download branch that could be\neasily deobfuscated.\n\n_Obfuscated Nosleep.vbs payload._\n\nOnce deobfuscated, we see that the functionality of VBScript based payloads is very similar\nto the functionality of JavaScript payloads. In this VBScript example, the client sends a\nrequest to the C2 server and expects a response which is then split based on the string\nspecified in a variable. The string for splitting for this sample is \"NAJAF\".\n\n\n-----\n\nOther similar scripts have been uploaded to VirusTotal. Their authorship is claimed by an\nactor with a handle \"Security.Najaf.\" This may imply the Fajan's author origin to be Iraq,\nalthough it could also be just a coincidence or false flag.\n\nIt is also possible that we are dealing with an entirely different actor, simply reusing the\navailable script code or employing a code generator developed by Security.Najaf.\nNevertheless, we decided to name the campaigns Fajan, reversing the string used to split\nthe command sent from the C2 server.\n\n_A snippet of Fajan VBScript-based RAT code._\n\nHere is the list of supported commands by one version of a VBScript based RAT:\n\nExc: Create a file in the user's temp folder, download and save the content and run the\nfile.\nNim: Download and save a file in the user's Startup folder, using the filename supplied\nby the C2 server.\n\n**Nanocore RAT payload**\n\nOne exception to the usual pattern of dropping or downloading a script based payload is an\ninstance discovered on Feb. 16, 2021. Here, we are dealing with an almost identical email\ncampaign, but the Excel file is a bit different.\n\n\n-----\n\n_A Fajan campaign, but with the Nanocore RAT downloader as the payload. The attachment_\n_size differs and the attachment naming scheme is slightly different._\n\nInstead of downloading the next stage from Pastebin or dropping a final payload, the VBA\nmacro drops and executes a VBScript-based downloader.\n\n\n-----\n\n_VBScript-based downloader dropped and executed by the VBA macro code._\n\nOnce again, the payload loader is downloaded from the Top4Top.io file sharing site. The\ncontent of the loader is downloaded to memory and it contains a PowerShell code very\n[similar to what we previously described in our post about recent Masslogger campaigns.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/masslogger-cred-exfil.html)\n\n_Nanocore payload stored as a lightly obfuscated PowerShell string._\n\n[This indicates that actors behind Fajan and behind related MassLogger and Agent Tesla](https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/x-labs/microsoft-compiled-html-help-threat)\ncampaigns are using a similar toolkit to generate the .NET DLL assembly loaders which\ndecode the payload and load the payload into the process space of the legitimate Windows\nprocess msbuild.exe.\n\n_Nanocore payload is injected into a msbuild.exe instance._\n\nNanocore is a well-known commercial Trojan available for sale since 2013. The author was\n[arrested in 2017 and was sentenced to 33 months in prison. Ever since, the development of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nanocore-rat-author-gets-33-months-in-prison/)\nNanocore stopped, but some versions have been successfully cracked and are widely used\nby attackers. The Nanocore client is written in C# and contains a resource segment with the\nconfiguration information which is extracted, decompressed and decrypted when the client is\nlaunched.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Nanocore configuration reading function._\n\nOnce decrypted, the configuration can be dumped from memory. Alternatively, a Nanocore\n[dumper tool released by Mario Henkel can be used to extract the information from the client](https://mariohenkel.medium.com/decrypting-nanocore-config-and-dump-all-plugins-f4944bfaba52)\nwithout debugging. We extracted the configuration information from the client that shows the\nversion 1.2.2.0 which is one of the cracked versions. The build date for the campaign\nexecuted on Feb. 16 was listed as Jan. 11, 2021 and the C2 server used was 79.134.225.33\nusing the TCP port 83.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Dumped Nanocore configuration._\n\nNanocore is a modular RAT supporting an ecosystem allowing the developer and its affiliates\nto use additional plugins embedded into the final payload using the Nanocore Builder tool.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Nanocore GUI displaying the available plugins._\n\nThis specific payload was configured to include the following plugins:\n\nClient Plugin: Handles communications with the C2 server.\nCore Plugin: Additional functions to collect recon about the client.\nManagement Plugin: Remote console, remote registry editor, file browser, task\nmanager.\nNetwork Plugin: Additional network support such as reverse SOCKS proxy.\nSecurity Plugin: Access to client firewall and anti-malware configuration.\nSurveillance Plugin: Password stealing and keylogging.\nSurveillanceEx Plugin: Remote desktop support, video and audio capture.\nTools Plugin: Miscellaneous functions, instant messaging, memory and process\ncleanup.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Infection chains observed in Fajan campaigns._\n\nWe've examined sustained campaigns using Bloomberg BNA-themed email messages as\nthe initial infection vector. Fajan's author has been actively developing the campaigns since\nat least March 2020. We named these campaigns \"Fajan\" based on the string that may\nindicate its author, taken from the body of a script payload.\n\nThere is not enough information to show if these campaigns are targeted or aiming to attack\nany user. Currently, we do not have enough information to decide what is the final goal of\nthose campaigns, since the final payload is a RAT with the ability to remotely control infected\nsystems and install additional software.\n\nNevertheless, we feel it is important to document Fajan's activities to show how the actor is\nvarying TTPs over a period of time and to describe different techniques used to make the\ncampaigns more successful.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware used](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nby these threat actors.
