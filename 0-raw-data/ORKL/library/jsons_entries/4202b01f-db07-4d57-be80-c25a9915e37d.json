This actor is associated\n**with the malware commonly known as Emotet or Geodo.**\n\nMUMMY SPIDER is a criminal entity linked to the core development of the malware most\ncommonly known as Emotet or Geodo. First observed in mid-2014, this malware shared\ncode with the Bugat (aka Feodo) banking Trojan. However, MUMMY SPIDER swiftly\n**developed the malware’s capabilities to include an RSA key exchange for command**\n**and control (C2) communication and a modular architecture.**\n\nMUMMY SPIDER does not follow typical criminal behavioral patterns. In particular, MUMMY\n**SPIDER usually conducts attacks for a few months before ceasing operations for a**\n**period of between three and 12 months, before returning with a new variant or version.**\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter a 10 month hiatus, MUMMY SPIDER returned Emotet to operation in December 2016\nbut the latest variant is not deploying a banking Trojan module with web injects, it is\ncurrently acting as a ‘loader’ delivering other malware packages. The primary modules\nperform reconnaissance on victim machines, drop freeware tools for credential collection\nfrom web browsers and mail clients and a spam plugin for self-propagation. The malware is\nalso issuing commands to download and execute other malware families such as the\nbanking Trojans Dridex and Qakbot.\n\nMUMMY SPIDER advertised Emotet on underground forums until 2015, at which time it\nbecame private. Therefore, it is highly likely that Emotet is operated solely for use by\nMUMMY SPIDER or with a small trusted group of customers.\n\n## Other Known Criminal Adversaries\n\n**_Curious about other nation-state adversaries?_** _[Visit our threat actor center to learn about](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/)_\n_the new adversaries that the CrowdStrike team discovers._\n\n## Learn More\n\nTo learn more about how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors like MUMMY\n[SPIDER please visit the Falcon Intelligence product page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/?ctm_source=Website&ctm_medium=Blog&ctm_campaign=Blog-Inline-Copy)\n**Want the insights on the latest adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures**\n**(TTPs)?
