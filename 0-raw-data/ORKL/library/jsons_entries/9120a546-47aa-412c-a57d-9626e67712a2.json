ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.\n\n Abstract\n\n This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats including hostile cyber attacks, natural disasters, structural failures, and human errors. The controls are customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process that manages information security and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and privacy requirements across the federal government and critical infrastructure, derived from legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/or mission/business needs. The publication also describes how to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays, tailored for specific types of missions/business functions, technologies, or environments of operation. Finally, the catalog of security controls addresses security from both a functionality perspective (the strength of security functions and mechanisms provided) and an assurance perspective (the measures of confidence in the implemented security capability). Addressing both security functionality and security assurance ensures that information technology products and the information systems built from those products using sound systems and security engineering principles are sufficiently trustworthy. \n\n Keywords\n\n Assurance; computer security; FIPS Publication 199; FIPS Publication 200, FISMA; Privacy Act; Risk Management Framework; security controls; security requirements.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Acknowledgements\n\n This publication was developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working Group with representatives from the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence Communities in an ongoing effort to produce a unified information security framework for the federal government.

To comply with_\nthe federal standard, organizations first determine the security category of their information\nsystem in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal\n_Information and Information Systems, derive the information system impact level from the_\nsecurity category in accordance with FIPS 200, and then apply the appropriately tailored set of\nbaseline security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for\n_Federal Information Systems and Organizations. Organizations have flexibility in applying the_\nbaseline security controls in accordance with the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-53.\nThis allows organizations to tailor the relevant security control baseline so that it more closely\naligns with their mission and business requirements and environments of operation.\n\nFIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53, in combination, ensure that appropriate security\nrequirements and security controls are applied to all federal information and information systems.\nAn organizational assessment of risk validates the initial security control selection and determines\nif additional controls are needed to protect organizational operations (including mission,\nfunctions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the\nNation. The resulting set of security controls establishes a level of security due diligence for the\norganization.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**_DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS_**\n\nCOLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES\n\nIn developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with other federal\nagencies and the private sector to improve information security, avoid unnecessary and costly\nduplication of effort, and ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and\nguidelines employed for the protection of national security systems. In addition to a\ncomprehensive public review and vetting process, NIST is collaborating with the Office of the\nDirector of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Committee on\nNational Security Systems (CNSS) to establish a unified information security framework for the\nfederal government. A common foundation for information security will provide the Civil,\nDefense, and Intelligence sectors of the federal government and their contractors, more costeffective and consistent ways to manage information security-related risk to organizational\noperations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The unified framework will\nalso provide a strong basis for reciprocal acceptance of authorization decisions and facilitate\ninformation sharing. NIST is also working with many public and private sector entities to establish\nmappings and relationships between the security standards and guidelines developed by NIST and\nthe International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission\n(ISO/IEC).\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n###### SECURITY REQUIREMENTS\n\nFROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST\n\nThe term security requirement is used by different communities and groups in different ways and\nmay require additional explanation to establish the particular context for the various use cases.\nSecurity requirements can be stated at a very high level of abstraction, for example, in legislation,\nExecutive Orders, directives, policies, standards, and mission/business needs statements. FISMA\nand FIPS Publication 200 articulate security requirements at such a level.\n\nAcquisition personnel develop security requirements for contracting purposes that address the\nprotections necessary to achieve mission/business needs. Systems/security engineers, system\ndevelopers, and systems integrators develop the security design requirements for the information\nsystem, develop the system security architecture and the architecture-specific derived security\nrequirements, and subsequently implement specific security functions at the hardware, software,\nand firmware component level.\n\nSecurity requirements are also reflected in various nontechnical security controls that address\nsuch matters as policy and procedures at the management and operational elements within\norganizations, again at differing levels of detail. It is important to define the context for each use of\nthe term security requirement so the respective communities (including individuals responsible for\npolicy, architecture, acquisition, engineering, and mission/business protection) can clearly\ncommunicate their intent.\n\nOrganizations may define certain security capabilities needed to satisfy security requirements and\nprovide appropriate mission and business protection. Security capabilities are typically defined by\nbringing together a specific set of safeguards/countermeasures (i.e., security controls) derived\nfrom the appropriately tailored baselines that together produce the needed capability.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n###### TECHNOLOGY AND POLICY NEUTRALITY\n\nCHARACTERISTICS OF SECURITY CONTROLS\n\nThe security controls in the catalog with few exceptions, have been designed to be policy- and\ntechnology-neutral. This means that security controls and control enhancements focus on the\nfundamental safeguards and countermeasures necessary to protect information during\nprocessing, while in storage, and during transmission. Therefore, it is beyond the scope of this\npublication to provide guidance on the application of security controls to specific technologies,\nenvironments of operation, communities of interest, or missions/business functions. Applicationspecific areas are addressed by the use of the tailoring process described in Chapter Three and the\nuse of overlays described in Appendix I. It should also be noted that while the security controls are\nlargely policy- and technology-neutral, that does not imply that the controls are policy- and\ntechnology-unaware. Understanding policy and technology is necessary so that the controls are\nmeaningful and relevant when implemented.\n\nIn the few cases where specific technologies are called out in security controls (e.g., mobile, PKI,\nwireless, VOIP), organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security goes well\nbeyond the requirements in a single control associated with a particular technology. Many of the\nneeded safeguards and countermeasures are obtained from the other security controls in the\ncatalog allocated to the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security\nplans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some overlap in the protections\narticulated by the security controls within the different control families.\n\nIn addition to the customer-driven development of specialized security plans and overlays, NIST\nSpecial Publications and Interagency Reports may provide guidance on recommended security\ncontrols for specific technologies and sector-specific applications (e.g., Smart Grid, healthcare,\nIndustrial Control Systems, and mobile).\n\nEmploying a technology- and policy-neutral security control catalog has the following benefits:\n\n- It encourages organizations to focus on the security capabilities required for mission/business\nsuccess and the protection of information, irrespective of the information technologies that are\nemployed in organizational information systems.\n\n- It encourages organizations to analyze each security control for its applicability to specific\ntechnologies, environments of operation, missions/business functions, and communities of\ninterest.\n\n- It encourages organizations to specify security policies as part of the tailoring process for security\ncontrols that have variable parameters.\n\nThe specialization of security plans using the tailoring guidance and overlays, together with a robust\nset of technology- and policy-neutral security controls, promotes cost-effective, risk-based\ninformation security for organizations—in any sector, for any technology, and in any operating\nenvironment.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n###### INFORMATION SECURITY DUE DILIGENCE\n\nMANAGING THE RISK TO ORGANIZATIONAL MISSIONS/BUSINESS FUNCTIONS\n\nThe security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are designed to facilitate compliance with\napplicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and\nguidance. Compliance is not about adhering to static checklists or generating unnecessary FISMA\nreporting paperwork. Rather, compliance necessitates organizations executing due diligence with\nregard to information security and risk management. Information security due diligence includes\nusing all appropriate information as part of an organization-wide risk management program to\neffectively use the tailoring guidance and inherent flexibility in NIST publications so that the\nselected security controls documented in organizational security plans meet the mission and\nbusiness requirements of organizations. Using the risk management tools and techniques that are\navailable to organizations is essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the\nsafeguards and countermeasures with the necessary and sufficient strength of mechanism to\naddress the current threats to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other\norganizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based processes, procedures, and\ntechnologies will help ensure that all federal information systems and organizations have the\nnecessary resilience to support ongoing federal responsibilities, critical infrastructure applications,\nand continuity of government.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n###### PRIVACY CONTROLS\n\nPROVIDING PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION\n\nAppendix J, Privacy Control Catalog, is a new addition to NIST Special Publication 800-53. It is\nintended to address the privacy needs of federal agencies. The Privacy Appendix:\n\n- Provides a structured set of privacy controls, based on best practices, that help organizations\ncomply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations,\npolicies, standards, guidance, and organization-specific issuances;\n\n- Establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of\nenforcing respective privacy and security requirements which may overlap in concept and in\nimplementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations;\n\n- Demonstrates the applicability of the NIST Risk Management Framework in the selection,\nimplementation, assessment, and ongoing monitoring of privacy controls deployed in federal\ninformation systems, programs, and organizations; and\n\n- Promotes closer cooperation between privacy and security officials within the federal\ngovernment to help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives in enforcing the\nrequirements in federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and\nguidance.\n\nThere is a strong similarity in the structure of the privacy controls in Appendix J and the security\ncontrols in Appendices F and G. For example, the control AR-1 (Governance and Privacy Program)\nrequires organizations to develop privacy plans that can be implemented at the organizational or\nprogram level. These plans can also be used in conjunction with security plans to provide an\nopportunity for organizations to select the appropriate set of security and privacy controls in\naccordance with organizational mission/business requirements and the environments in which the\norganizations operate. Incorporating the same concepts used in managing information security\nrisk, helps organizations implement privacy controls in a more cost-effective, risked-based manner\nwhile simultaneously protecting individual privacy and meeting compliance requirements.\nStandardized privacy controls provide a more disciplined and structured approach for satisfying\nfederal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance to those requirements.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**CAUTIONARY NOTE**\n\n_IMPLEMENTING CHANGES BASED ON REVISIONS TO SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-53_\n\nWhen NIST publishes revisions to Special Publication 800-53, there are four primary types of\nchanges made to the document: (i) security controls or control enhancements are added to or\nwithdrawn from Appendices F and G and/or to the low, moderate, and high baselines; (ii)\nsupplemental guidance is modified; (iii) material in the main chapters or appendices is modified;\nand (iv) language is clarified and/or updated throughout the document.\n\nWhen modifying existing tailored security control baselines at Tier 3 in the risk management\nhierarchy (as described in Special Publication 800-39) and updating security controls at any tier as\na result of Special Publication 800-53 revisions, organizations should take a measured, risk-based\napproach in accordance with organizational risk tolerance and current risk assessments. Unless\notherwise directed by OMB policy, the following activities are recommended to implement\nchanges to Special Publication 800-53:\n\n- First, organizations determine if any added security controls/control enhancements are\napplicable to organizational information systems or environments of operation following\ntailoring guidelines in this publication.\n\n- Next, organizations review changes to the supplemental guidance, guidance in the main\nchapters and appendices, and updated/clarified language throughout the publication to\ndetermine if changes apply to any organizational information systems and if any immediate\nactions are required.\n\n- Finally, once organizations have determined the entirety of changes necessitated by the\nrevisions to the publication, the changes are integrated into the established continuous\nmonitoring process to the greatest extent possible. The implementation of new or modified\nsecurity controls to address specific, active threats is always the highest priority for sequencing\nand implementing changes. Modifications such as changes to templates or minor language\nchanges in policy or procedures are generally the lowest priority and are made in conjunction\nwith established review cycles.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Table of Contents\n\n**CHAPTER ONE  INTRODUCTION .......................................................................................... 1**\n\n1.1  PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY .................................................................................................. 2\n1.2  TARGET AUDIENCE .................................................................................................................. 3\n1.3  RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SECURITY CONTROL PUBLICATIONS .................................................... 3\n1.4  ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES ........................................................................................ 4\n1.5  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SPECIAL PUBLICATION .......................................................................... 6\n\n**CHAPTER TWO  THE FUNDAMENTALS .................................................................................. 7**\n\n2.1  MULTITIERED RISK MANAGEMENT ............................................................................................. 7\n2.2  SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE ............................................................................................. 9\n2.3  SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES ............................................................................................. 12\n2.4  SECURITY CONTROL DESIGNATIONS ....................................................................................... 14\n2.5  EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ............................................................................................ 17\n2.6  ASSURANCE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS .................................................................................... 20\n2.7  REVISIONS AND EXTENSIONS ................................................................................................. 26\n\n**CHAPTER THREE  THE PROCESS ...................................................................................... 28**\n\n3.1  SELECTING SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES ........................................................................... 28\n3.2  TAILORING BASELINE SECURITY CONTROLS ............................................................................ 30\n3.3  CREATING OVERLAYS ............................................................................................................ 40\n3.4  DOCUMENTING THE CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS ............................................................... 42\n3.5  NEW DEVELOPMENT AND LEGACY SYSTEMS ........................................................................... 44\n\n**APPENDIX A  REFERENCES ............................................................................................

The publication was developed by NIST, the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security Systems as part of the Joint Task Force, an interagency partnership formed in 2009. This update was motivated principally by the expanding threat space—characterized by the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks and the operations tempo of adversaries (i.e., the frequency of such attacks, the professionalism of the attackers, and the persistence of targeting by attackers). State- of-the-practice security controls and control enhancements have been developed and integrated into the catalog addressing such areas as: mobile and cloud computing; applications security; trustworthiness, assurance, and resiliency of information systems; insider threat; supply chain security; and the advanced persistent threat. In addition, Special Publication 800-53 has been expanded to include eight new families of privacy controls based on the internationally accepted Fair Information Practice Principles.\n\n Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, provides a more holistic approach to information security and risk management by providing organizations with the breadth and depth of security controls necessary to fundamentally strengthen their information systems and the environments in which those systems operate—contributing to systems that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats. This “Build It Right” strategy is coupled with a variety of security controls for “Continuous Monitoring” to give organizations near real-time information that is essential for senior leaders making ongoing risk-based decisions affecting their critical missions and business functions.\n\n To take advantage of the expanded set of security and privacy controls, and to give organizations greater flexibility and agility in defending their information systems, the concept of overlays was introduced in this revision. Overlays provide a structured approach to help organizations tailor security control baselines and develop specialized security plans that can be applied to specific missions/business functions, environments of operation, and/or technologies. This specialization approach is important as the number of threat-driven controls and control enhancements in the catalog increases and organizations develop risk management strategies to address their specific protection needs within defined risk tolerances.\n\n Finally, there have been several new features added to this revision to facilitate ease of use by organizations. These include: \n\n • Assumptions relating to security control baseline development;\n\n • Expanded, updated, and streamlined tailoring guidance;\n\n • Additional assignment and selection statement options for security and privacy controls;\n\n • Descriptive names for security and privacy control enhancements;\n\n • Consolidated tables for security controls and control enhancements by family with baseline allocations;\n\n • Tables for security controls that support development, evaluation, and operational assurance; and\n\n • Mapping tables for international security standard ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria).\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### The security and privacy controls in Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, have been designed to be largely policy/technology-neutral to facilitate flexibility in implementation.

TO PROTECT INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\n###### he selection and implementation of security controls for information systems[1] and organizations are important tasks that can have major implications on the operations[2] and assets of organizations[3] as well as the welfare of individuals and the Nation. Security\n\n## T\n\n###### controls are the safeguards/countermeasures prescribed for information systems or organizations that are designed to: (i) protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information that is processed, stored, and transmitted by those systems/organizations; and (ii) satisfy a set of defined security requirements.[4] There are several key questions that should be answered by organizations when addressing the information security considerations for information systems:\n\n • What security controls are needed to satisfy the security requirements and to adequately mitigate risk incurred by using information and information systems in the execution of organizational missions and business functions?\n\n • Have the security controls been implemented, or is there an implementation plan in place?\n\n • What is the desired or required level of assurance that the selected security controls, as implemented, are effective in their application?[ 5]\n\n The answers to these questions are not given in isolation but rather in the context of an effective risk management process for the organization that identifies, mitigates as deemed necessary, and monitors on an ongoing basis, risks[6] arising from its information and information systems. NIST Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on managing information security risk at three distinct tiers—the organization level, mission/business process level, and information system level. The security controls defined in this publication and recommended for use by organizations to satisfy their information security requirements should be employed as part of a well-defined risk management process that supports organizational information security programs.[7]\n\n1 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,\nmaintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized\nsystems such as industrial/process controls systems, telephone switching/private branch exchange (PBX) systems, and\nenvironmental control systems.\n\n2 Organizational operations include mission, functions, image, and reputation.\n\n3 The term organization describes an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure\n(e.g., a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements).\n\n4 Security requirements are derived from mission/business needs, laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,\npolicies, instructions, standards, guidance, and/or procedures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\nthe information being processed, stored, or transmitted by organizational information systems.\n\n5 Security control effectiveness addresses the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as\nintended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information\nsystem in its operational environment or enforcing/mediating established security policies.\n\n6 Information security-related risks are those risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of\ninformation or information systems and consider the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets,\nindividuals, other organizations, and the Nation.\n\n7 The program management controls (Appendix G) complement the security controls for an information system\n(Appendix F) by focusing on the organization-wide information security requirements that are independent of any\nparticular information system and are essential for managing information security programs.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### It is of paramount importance that responsible officials understand the risks and other factors that could adversely affect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.[8] These officials must also understand the current status of their security programs and the security controls planned or in place to protect their information and information systems in order to make informed judgments and investments that mitigate risks to an acceptable level. The ultimate objective is to conduct the day-to-day operations of the organization and accomplish the organization’s stated missions and business functions with what the OMB Circular A-130 defines as adequate security, or security commensurate with risk resulting from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information.\n\n 1.1  PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY\n\n The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for selecting and specifying security controls for organizations and information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government to meet the requirements of FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems. The guidelines apply to all components[9] of an information system that process, store, or transmit federal information. The guidelines have been developed to achieve more secure information systems and effective risk management within the federal government by:\n\n • Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems and organizations;\n\n • Providing a stable, yet flexible catalog of security controls to meet current information protection needs and the demands of future protection needs based on changing threats, requirements, and technologies;\n\n • Providing a recommendation for security controls for information systems categorized in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems;\n\n • Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for determining security control effectiveness; and\n\n • Improving communication among organizations by providing a common lexicon that supports discussion of risk management concepts.\n\n In addition to the security controls described above, this publication: (i) provides a set of information security program management (PM) controls that are typically implemented at the organization level and not directed at individual organizational information systems; (ii) provides a set of privacy controls based on international standards and best practices that help organizations enforce privacy requirements derived from federal legislation, directives, policies, regulations, and standards; and (iii) establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of enforcing respective privacy and security requirements which may overlap in concept and in implementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations. Standardized privacy controls provide a more disciplined and structured approach for satisfying federal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance to those\n\n8 This includes risk to critical infrastructure/key resources described in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7.\n\n9 Information system components include, for example, mainframes, workstations, servers (e.g., database, electronic\nmail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, printers), network\ncomponents (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, process controllers, wireless access points,\nnetwork appliances, sensors), operating systems, virtual machines, middleware, and applications.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### requirements. Incorporating the same concepts used in managing information security risk, helps organizations implement privacy controls in a more cost-effective, risked-based manner.\n The guidelines in this special publication are applicable to all federal information systems[10] other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542.[11] The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to complement similar guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems with the approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems.[12] State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.\n\n 1.2  TARGET AUDIENCE\n\n This publication is intended to serve a diverse audience of information system and information security professionals including:\n\n • Individuals with information system, security, and/or risk management and oversight responsibilities (e.g., authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information security officers,[13] information system managers, information security managers);\n\n • Individuals with information system development responsibilities (e.g., program managers, system designers and developers, information security engineers, systems integrators);\n\n • Individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g., mission/business owners, information system owners, common control providers, information owners/stewards, system administrators, information system security officers);\n\n • Individuals with information security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., auditors, Inspectors General, system evaluators, assessors, independent verifiers/validators, analysts, information system owners); and\n\n • Commercial companies producing information technology products and systems, creating information security-related technologies, or providing information security services.\n\n 1.3  RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SECURITY CONTROL PUBLICATIONS\n\n To create a technically sound and broadly applicable set of security controls for information systems and organizations, a variety of sources were considered during the development of this special publication. The sources included security controls from the defense, audit, financial, healthcare, industrial/process control, and intelligence communities as well as controls defined by\n\n10 A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an\nexecutive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency.\n\n11 A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by\nan agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency: (i) the function, operation, or\nuse of which involves intelligence activities; involves cryptologic activities related to national security; involves\ncommand and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or\nis critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for routine\nadministrative and business applications, e.g., payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications); or\n(ii) is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically authorized under\ncriteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense\nor foreign policy.\n\n12 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides implementing guidance for national security systems.\n\n13 At the agency level, this position is known as the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations may\nalso refer to this position as the Senior Information Security Officer or the Chief Information Security Officer.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### national and international standards organizations. The objective of NIST Special Publication 800-53 is to provide a set of security controls that can satisfy the breadth and depth of security requirements[14] levied on organizations, mission/business processes, and information systems and that is consistent with and complementary to other established information security standards.\n\n The catalog of security controls in Special Publication 800-53 can be effectively used to protect information and information systems from traditional and advanced persistent threats in varied operational, environmental, and technical scenarios. The controls can also be used to demonstrate compliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security requirements. Organizations have the responsibility to select the appropriate security controls, to implement the controls correctly, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controls in satisfying established security requirements.[15] The security controls facilitate the development of assessment methods and procedures that can be used to demonstrate control effectiveness in a consistent/repeatable manner—thus contributing to the organization’s confidence that security requirements continue to be satisfied on an ongoing basis. In addition, security controls can be used in developing overlays for specialized information systems, information technologies, environments of operation, or communities of interest (see Appendix I).\n\n 1.4  ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n Organizations use FIPS Publication 199 to categorize their information and information systems. Security categorization is accomplished as an organization-wide activity[16] with the involvement of senior-level organizational personnel including, for example, authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information security officers, information owners and/or stewards, information system owners, and risk executive (function).[17] Information is categorized at Tier 1 (organization level) and at Tier 2 (mission/business process level). In accordance with FIPS Publication 200, organizations use the security categorization results from Tiers 1 and 2 to designate organizational information systems at Tier 3 (information system level) as low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact systems. For each organizational information system at Tier 3, the recommendation for security controls from the baseline controls defined in Appendix D is the starting point for the security control tailoring process. While the security control selection process is generally focused on information systems at Tier 3, the process is generally applicable across all three tiers of risk management.\n\n FIPS Publication 199 security categorization associates information and the operation and use of information systems with the potential worst-case adverse impact on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.[18] Organizational assessments of risk, including the use of specific and credible threat information, vulnerability information, and the likelihood of such threats exploiting vulnerabilities to cause adverse impacts, guide and inform\n\n14 Security requirements are those requirements levied on an information system that are derived from laws, Executive\nOrders, directives, policies, instructions, regulations, standards, guidelines, or organizational (mission) needs to ensure\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted.\n\n15 NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of security controls.\n\n16 See FIPS Publication 200, Footnote 7.\n\n17 Organizations typically exercise managerial, operational, and financial control over their information systems and the\nsecurity provided to those systems, including the authority and capability to implement or require the security controls\ndeemed necessary to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.\n\n18 Considerations for potential national-level impacts and impacts to other organizations in categorizing organizational\ninformation systems derive from the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPDs).\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### the tailoring process and the final selection of security controls.[19] The final, agreed-upon set of security controls addressing specific organizational mission/business needs and tolerance for risk is documented with appropriate rationale in the security plan for the information system.[20] The use of security controls from Special Publication 800-53 (including the baseline controls as a starting point in the control selection process), facilitates a more consistent level of security for federal information systems and organizations, while simultaneously preserving the flexibility and agility organizations need to address an increasingly sophisticated and hostile threat space, specific organizational missions/business functions, rapidly changing technologies, and in some cases, unique environments of operation.\n\n Achieving adequate information security for organizations, mission/business processes, and information systems is a multifaceted undertaking that requires:\n\n • Clearly articulated security requirements and security specifications;\n\n • Well-designed and well-built information technology products based on state-of-the-practice hardware, firmware, and software development processes;\n\n • Sound systems/security engineering principles and practices to effectively integrate information technology products into organizational information systems;\n\n • Sound security practices that are well documented and seamlessly integrated into the training requirements and daily routines of organizational personnel with security responsibilities;\n\n • Continuous monitoring of organizations and information systems to determine the ongoing effectiveness of deployed security controls, changes in information systems and environments of operation, and compliance with legislation, directives, policies, and standards;[21] and\n\n • Information security planning and system development life cycle management.[22]\n\n From an engineering viewpoint, information security is just one of many required operational capabilities for information systems that support organizational mission/business processes— capabilities that must be funded by organizations throughout the system development life cycle in order to achieve mission/business success. It is important that organizations realistically assess the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from mission/business processes and by placing information systems into operation or continuing operations. Realistic assessment of risk requires an understanding of threats to and vulnerabilities within organizations and the likelihood and potential adverse impacts of successful exploitations of such vulnerabilities by those threats.[23] Finally, information security requirements must be satisfied with the full knowledge and consideration of the risk management strategy of\n\n19 Risk assessments can be accomplished in a variety of ways depending on the specific needs of organizations. NIST\nSpecial Publication 800-30 provides guidance on the assessment of risk as part of an overall risk management process.\n\n20 Authorizing officials or designated representatives, by accepting the completed security plans, agree to the set of\nsecurity controls proposed to meet the security requirements for organizations (including mission/business processes)\nand/or designated information systems.\n\n21 NIST Special Publication 800-137 provides guidance on continuous monitoring of organizational information\nsystems and environments of operation.\n\n22 NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on the information security considerations in the system\ndevelopment life cycle.\n\n23 NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides guidance on the risk assessment process.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### the organization, in light of the potential cost, schedule, and performance issues associated with the acquisition, deployment, and operation of organizational information systems.[24]\n\n 1.5  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SPECIAL PUBLICATION\n\n The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:\n\n • Chapter Two describes the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection and specification including: (i) multitiered risk management; (ii) the structure of security controls and how the controls are organized into families; (iii) security control baselines as starting points for the tailoring process; (iv) the use of common controls and inheritance of security capabilities; (v) external environments and service providers; (vi) assurance and trustworthiness; and (vii) revisions and extensions to security controls and control baselines.\n\n • Chapter Three describes the process of selecting and specifying security controls for organizational information systems including: (i) selecting appropriate security control baselines; (ii) tailoring the baseline controls including developing specialized overlays; (iii) documenting the security control selection process; and (iv) applying the selection process to new and legacy systems.\n\n • Supporting appendices provide essential security control selection and specification-related information including: (i) general references;[ 25] (ii) definitions and terms; (iii) acronyms; (iv) baseline security controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems; (v) guidance on assurance and trustworthiness in information systems; (vi) a catalog of security controls;[26] (vii) a catalog of information security program management controls; (viii) mappings to international information security standards; (ix) guidance for developing overlays by organizations or communities of interest; and (x) a catalog of privacy controls.\n\n24 In addition to information security requirements, organizations must also address privacy requirements that derive\nfrom federal legislation and policies. Organizations can employ the privacy controls in Appendix J in conjunction with\nthe security controls in Appendix F to achieve comprehensive security and privacy protection.\n\n25 Unless otherwise stated, all references to NIST publications in this document (i.e., Federal Information Processing\nStandards and Special Publications) are to the most recent version of the publication.\n\n26 The security controls in Special Publication 800-53 are available online and can be downloaded in various formats\n[from the NIST web site at: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home.](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home)\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### CHAPTER TWO\n\n THE FUNDAMENTALS\n\nSECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION, BASELINES, AND ASSURANCE\n\n###### his chapter presents the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection and specification including: (i) three-tiered risk management; (ii) the structure of security controls and the organization of the controls in the control catalog; (iii) security control\n\n#### T\n\n###### baselines; (iv) the identification and use of common security controls; (v) security controls in external environments; (vi) security control assurance; and (vii) future revisions to the security controls, the control catalog, and baseline controls.\n\n 2.1  MULTITIERED RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n The selection and specification of security controls for an information system is accomplished as part of an organization-wide information security program for the management of risk—that is, the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation associated with the operation of information systems. Risk-based approaches to security control selection and specification consider effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. To integrate the risk management process throughout the organization and more effectively address mission/business concerns, a three-tiered approach is employed that addresses risk at the: (i) organization level; (ii) mission/business process level; and (iii) information system level. The risk management process is carried out across the three tiers with the overall objective of continuous improvement in the organization’s risk-related activities and effective inter-tier and intra-tier communication among all stakeholders having a shared interest in the mission/business success of the organization. Figure 1 illustrates the three-tiered approach to risk management.\n\n STRATEGIC RISK\n\n - Traceability and Transparency of  - Inter-Tier and Intra-Tier\n\n**Risk-Based Decisions** **TIER** **1** **Communications**\n\n                                           - Feedback Loop for\n\n - Organization-Wide **ORGANIZATION**\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n**Risk Awareness**\n\n###### TIER 2\n**MISSION / BUSINESS PROCESSES**\n\n###### TIER 3\n**INFORMATION SYSTEMS**\n\n###### TACTICAL RISK\n\n**FIGURE 1: THREE-TIERED RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH**\n\n\n###### STRATEGIC RISK\n\n - Traceability and Transparency of  - Inter-Tier and Intra-Tier\n\n**Risk-Based Decisions** **TIER** **1** **Communications**\n\n                                           - Feedback Loop for\n\n - Organization-Wide **ORGANIZATION**\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n**Risk Awareness**\n\n###### TIER 2\n**MISSION / BUSINESS PROCESSES**\n\n###### TIER 3\n**INFORMATION SYSTEMS**\n\n###### TACTICAL RISK\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Tier 1 provides a prioritization of organizational missions/business functions which in turn drives investment strategies and funding decisions—promoting cost-effective, efficient information technology solutions consistent with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization and measures of performance. Tier 2 includes: (i) defining the mission/business processes needed to support the organizational missions/business functions; (ii) determining the security categories of the information systems needed to execute the mission/business processes; (iii) incorporating information security requirements into the mission/business processes; and (iv) establishing an enterprise architecture (including an embedded information security architecture) to facilitate the allocation of security controls to organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate. The Risk Management Framework (RMF), depicted in Figure 2, is the primary means for addressing risk at Tier 3.[27] This publication focuses on Step 2 of the RMF, the security control selection process, in the context of the three tiers in the organizational risk management hierarchy.\n\n**Architecture Description** **Organizational Inputs**\n\n      - Mission/Business Processes **Starting**      - Laws, Directives, Policy, Guidance\n\n     - FEA Reference Models **Point**      - Strategic Goals and Objectives\n\n      - Segment and Solution Architectures      - Information Security Requirements\n\n      - Information System Boundaries      - Priorities and Resource Availability\n\n**Repeat as necessary**\n\n**Step 1**\n\n**CATEGORIZE**\n**Information Systems**\n\n**Step 6** **FIPS 199 / SP 800-60** **Step 2**\n\n**MONITOR** **SELECT**\n**Security Controls** **Security Controls**\n\n**SP 800-137** **FIPS 200 / SP 800-53**\n\n###### RISK MANAGEMENT\n FRAMEWORK\n\n**Step 5** **Security Life Cycle** **Step 3**\n\n**AUTHORIZE** **IMPLEMENT**\n**Information Systems** **Security Controls**\n\n**SP 800-37** **SP 800-160**\n\n**Step 4**\n\n**ASSESS**\n**Security Controls**\n\n**SP 800-53A**\n\n**_Note: CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance for RMF Steps 1 and 2 for National Security Systems (NSS)._**\n\n**FIGURE 2: RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK**\n\n###### The RMF addresses the security concerns of organizations related to the design, development, implementation, operation, and disposal of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate.

For ease of use in the security control selection and specification process, controls are organized into eighteen families.[30] Each family contains security controls related to the general security topic of the family. A two-character identifier uniquely identifies security control families, for example, PS (Personnel Security). Security controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision, manual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms implemented by information systems/devices. Table 1 lists the security control families and the associated family identifiers in the security control catalog.[31]\n\n**TABLE 1: SECURITY CONTROL IDENTIFIERS AND FAMILY NAMES**\n\n**ID** **FAMILY** **ID** **FAMILY**\n\nAC Access Control MP Media Protection\n\nAT Awareness and Training PE Physical and Environmental Protection\n\nAU Audit and Accountability PL Planning\n\nCA Security Assessment and Authorization PS Personnel Security\n\nCM Configuration Management RA Risk Assessment\n\nCP Contingency Planning SA System and Services Acquisition\n\nIA Identification and Authentication SC System and Communications Protection\n\nIR Incident Response SI System and Information Integrity\n\nMA Maintenance PM Program Management\n\n28 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security categorization guidance for national security systems.\n\n29 NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of security controls.\n\n30 Of the eighteen security control families in NIST Special Publication 800-53, seventeen families are described in the\nsecurity control catalog in Appendix F, and are closely aligned with the seventeen minimum security requirements for\nfederal information and information systems in FIPS Publication 200. One additional family (Program Management\n\n[PM] family) provides controls for information security programs required by FISMA. This family, while not\nspecifically referenced in FIPS Publication 200, provides security controls at the organization level rather than the\ninformation system level. See Appendix G for a description of and implementation guidance for the PM controls.\n\n31 _Privacy controls listed in Appendix J, have an organization and structure similar to security controls, including the_\nuse of two-character identifiers for the eight privacy families.\n\n|ID|FAMILY|ID|FAMILY|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|AC|Access Control|MP|Media Protection|\n|AT|Awareness and Training|PE|Physical and Environmental Protection|\n|AU|Audit and Accountability|PL|Planning|\n|CA|Security Assessment and Authorization|PS|Personnel Security|\n|CM|Configuration Management|RA|Risk Assessment|\n|CP|Contingency Planning|SA|System and Services Acquisition|\n|IA|Identification and Authentication|SC|System and Communications Protection|\n|IR|Incident Response|SI|System and Information Integrity|\n|MA|Maintenance|PM|Program Management|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### The security control structure consists of the following components: (i) a control section; (ii) a supplemental guidance section; (iii) a control enhancements section; (iv) a references section; and (v) a priority and baseline allocation section. The following example from the Auditing and Accountability family illustrates the structure of a typical security control.\n\n**AU-3** **CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS**\n\nControl: The information system generates audit records containing information that establishes\nwhat type of event occurred, when the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the\nevent, the outcome of the event, and the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with the\nevent.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of\nthis control includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process\nidentifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or\nflow control rules invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and\nevent-specific results (e.g., the security state of the information system after the event occurred).\nRelated controls: AU-2, AU-8, AU-12, SI-11.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | ADDITIONAL AUDIT INFORMATION_\n\n**The information system generates audit records containing the following additional information:**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed information].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records\nincludes, for example, full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities\nof group account users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit information to\nonly that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements.

The term information system refers to those functions that generally involve the implementation of information technology (e.g., hardware, software, and firmware). Conversely, the term organization refers to activities that are generally process- driven or entity-driven—that is, the security control is generally implemented through human or procedural-based actions. Security controls that use the term organization may still require some degree of automation to be fulfilled. Similarly, security controls that use the term information system may have some elements that are process-driven or entity-driven. Using the terms organization and/or information system does not preclude the application of security controls at any of the tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, information system level), as appropriate. \n\n|P1|LOW AU-3|MOD AU-3 (1)|HIGH AU-3 (1) (2)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### For some security controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing organizations to define values for certain parameters associated with the controls. This flexibility is achieved through the use of assignment and selection statements embedded within the security controls and control enhancements. Assignment and selection statements provide organizations with the capability to tailor security controls and control enhancements based on: (i) security requirements to support organizational missions/business functions and operational needs; (ii) risk assessments and organizational risk tolerance; and (iii) security requirements originating in federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, or guidelines.[32]\n\n For example, organizations can specify additional information needed for audit records to support audit event processing. See the AU-3(1) example above (i.e., [Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed information]). These assignments may include particular actions to be taken by information systems in the event of audit failures, the frequency of conducting system backups, restrictions on password use, or the distribution list for organizational policies and procedures.[33] Once specified,[34] the organization-defined values for assignment and selection statements become part of the security control, and the control implementation is assessed against the completed control statement. Assignment statements offer a high degree of flexibility by allowing organizations to specify parameter values, without requiring those values to be one of two or more specific predefined choices. In contrast, selection statements narrow the potential input values by providing a specific list of items from which organizations must choose.[35]\n\n The supplemental guidance section provides non-prescriptive, additional information for a specific security control. Organizations can apply the supplemental guidance as appropriate, when defining, developing, and/or implementing security controls. The supplemental guidance can provide important considerations for implementing security controls in the context of operational environments, mission/business requirements, or assessments of risk and can also explain the purpose or meaning of particular controls. Security control enhancements may also contain supplemental guidance when the guidance is not applicable to the entire control but instead focused on a particular control enhancement. The supplemental guidance sections for security controls and control enhancements may contain a list of related controls. Related controls: (i) directly impact or support the implementation of a particular security control or control enhancement; (ii) address a closely related security capability; or (iii) are referenced in the supplemental guidance. Security control enhancements are by definition related to the base control. Related controls that are listed in the supplemental guidance for the base controls are not repeated in the supplemental guidance for the control enhancements. However, there may be related controls identified for control enhancements that are not listed in the base control.\n\n The security control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) add functionality/specificity to a control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a control. In both cases, control enhancements are used in information systems and environments of operation requiring\n\n32 In general, organization-defined parameters used in assignment and selection statements in the basic security\ncontrols apply also to all control enhancements associated with those controls.\n\n33 Organizations determine whether specific assignment or selection statements are completed at Tier 1 (organization\nlevel), Tier 2 (mission/business process level), Tier 3 (information system level), or a combination thereof.\n\n34 Organizations may choose to define specific values for security control parameters in policies, procedures, or\nguidance (which may be applicable to more than one information system) referencing the source documents in the\nsecurity plan in lieu of explicitly completing the assignment/selection statements within the control as part of the plan.\n\n35 Security controls are generally designed to be technology- and implementation-independent, and therefore do not\ncontain specific requirements in these areas. Organizations provide such requirements as deemed necessary in the\nsecurity plan for the information system.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### greater protection than provided by the base control due to the potential adverse organizational impacts or when organizations seek additions to the base control functionality/specificity based on organizational assessments of risk. Security control enhancements are numbered sequentially within each control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement the base control. Each security control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended security capability provided by the control enhancement. In the AU-3 example, if the first control enhancement is selected, the control designation becomes AU-3(1). The numerical designation of a control enhancement is used only to identify the particular enhancement within the control. The designation is not indicative of either the strength of the control enhancement or any hierarchical relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements are not intended to be selected independently (i.e., if a control enhancement is selected, then the corresponding base security control must also be selected). This intent is reflected in the baseline specifications in Appendix D and in the baseline allocation section under each control in Appendix F.\n\n The references section includes a list of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines (e.g., OMB Circulars/Memoranda, Homeland Security Presidential Directives, FIPS Publications, and NIST Special Publications) that are relevant to a particular security control.[36] The references provide federal legislative and policy mandates as well as supporting information for the implementation of security controls and control enhancements. The references section also contains pertinent websites for organizations to use in obtaining additional information for security control implementation and assessment.\n\n The priority and security control baseline allocation section provides: (i) the recommended priority codes used for sequencing decisions during security control implementation; and (ii) the initial allocation of security controls and control enhancements to the baselines. Organizations can use the priority code designation associated with each security control to assist in making sequencing decisions for control implementation (i.e., a Priority Code 1 [P1] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 2 [P2] control, a Priority Code 2 [P2] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 3 [P3] control, and a Priority Code 0\n [P0] indicates the security control is not selected in any baseline). This recommended sequencing prioritization helps to ensure that the foundational security controls upon which other controls depend are implemented first, thus enabling organizations to deploy controls in a more structured and timely manner in accordance with available resources. The implementation of security controls by sequence priority code does not imply the achievement of any defined level of risk mitigation until all of the security controls in the security plan have been implemented. The priority codes are intended only for implementation sequencing, not for making security control selection decisions. \n\n 2.3  SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES\n\n Organizations are required to adequately mitigate the risk arising from use of information and information systems in the execution of missions and business functions. A significant challenge for organizations is to determine the most cost-effective, appropriate set of security controls, which if implemented and determined to be effective, would mitigate risk while complying with security requirements defined by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, regulations, policies, directives, or standards (e.g., FISMA, OMB Circular A-130, HSPD-12, FIPS Publication 200). There is no one correct set of security controls that addresses all organizational security concerns in all situations. Selecting the most appropriate set of security controls for a specific situation or\n\n36 Publications listed in the references section refer to the most recent versions of the publications. References are\nprovided to assist organizations in applying the security controls and are not intended to be inclusive or complete.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### information system to adequately mitigate risk is an important task that requires a fundamental understanding of organizational mission/business priorities, the mission and business functions the information systems will support, and the environments of operation where the systems will reside. With that understanding, organizations can demonstrate how to most effectively assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information and information systems in a manner that supports mission/business needs while demonstrating due diligence. Selecting, implementing, and maintaining an appropriate set of security controls to adequately protect the information systems employed by organizations requires strong collaboration with system owners to understand ongoing changes to missions/business functions, environments of operation, and how the systems are used.\n\n To assist organizations in making the appropriate selection of security controls for information systems, the concept of baseline controls is introduced. Baseline controls are the starting point for the security control selection process described in this document and are chosen based on the security category and associated impact level of information systems determined in accordance with FIPS Publication 199 and FIPS Publication 200, respectively.[37] Appendix D provides a listing of the security control baselines. Three security control baselines have been identified corresponding to the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems using the high water mark defined in FIPS Publication 200 and used in Section 3.1 of this document to provide an initial set of security controls for each impact level.[38]\n\n Appendix F provides a comprehensive catalog of security controls for information systems and organizations, arranged by control families. Chapter Three provides additional information on how to use FIPS Publication 199 security categories and FIPS Publication 200 system impact levels in applying the tailoring guidance to the baseline security controls to achieve adequate risk mitigation. Tailoring guidance, described in Section 3.2, helps organizations to customize the security control baselines selected using the results from organizational assessments of risk. Baseline tailoring actions include: (i) identifying and designating common controls; (ii) applying scoping considerations; (iii) selecting compensating controls; (iv) assigning specific values to security control parameters; (v) supplementing initial baselines with additional security controls or control enhancements; and (vi) providing additional information for control implementation.\n\n\n**_Implementation Tip_**\n\nThere are security controls and control enhancements that appear in the security control catalog\n(Appendix F) that are found in only higher-impact baselines or are not used in any of the baselines.\nThese additional security controls and control enhancements for information systems are available to\norganizations and can be used in tailoring security control baselines to achieve the needed level of\nprotection in accordance with organizational assessments of risk. The set of security controls in the\nsecurity plan must be sufficient to adequately mitigate risks to organizational operations and assets,\nindividuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the organizational risk tolerance.\n\n\n37 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance on security control baselines for national security systems.\n\n38 The baseline security controls contained in Appendix D are not necessarily absolutes in that the guidance described\nin Section 3.2 provides organizations with the ability to tailor controls in accordance with the terms and conditions\nestablished by their authorizing officials and documented in their respective security plans.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### 2.4  SECURITY CONTROL DESIGNATIONS\n\n There are three distinct types of designations related to the security controls in Appendix F that define: (i) the scope of applicability for the control; (ii) the shared nature of the control; and (iii) the responsibility for control development, implementation, assessment, and authorization. These designations include common controls, system-specific controls, and hybrid controls.\n\n Common controls are security controls whose implementation results in a security capability that is inheritable by one or more organizational information systems. Security controls are deemed inheritable by information systems or information system components when the systems or components receive protection from the implemented controls but the controls are developed, implemented, assessed, authorized, and monitored by entities other than those responsible for the systems or components—entities internal or external to the organizations where the systems or components reside. Security capabilities provided by common controls can be inherited from many sources including, for example, organizations, organizational mission/business lines, sites, enclaves, environments of operation, or other information systems. Many of the controls needed to protect organizational information systems (e.g., security awareness training, incident response plans, physical access to facilities, rules of behavior) are excellent candidates for common control status. In addition, there can also be a variety of technology-based common controls (e.g., Public Key Infrastructure [PKI], authorized secure standard configurations for clients/servers, access control systems, boundary protection, cross-domain solutions). By centrally managing and documenting the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of common controls, security costs can be amortized across multiple information systems.\n\n The organization assigns responsibility for common controls to appropriate organizational officials (i.e., common control providers) and coordinates the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the controls.[39] The identification of common controls is most effectively accomplished as an organization-wide exercise with the active involvement of chief information officers, senior information security officers, the risk executive (function), authorizing officials, information owners/stewards, information system owners, and information system security officers. The organization-wide exercise considers the security categories of the information systems within the organization and the security controls necessary to adequately mitigate the risks arising from the use of those systems (see baseline security controls in Section 2.3).[40] Common control identification for the controls that impact multiple information systems, but not all systems across the organization could benefit from taking a similar approach. Key stakeholders collaborate to identify opportunities to effectively employ common controls at the mission/business line, site, or enclave level.\n\n When common controls protect multiple organizational information systems of differing impact levels, the controls are implemented with regard to the highest impact level among the systems. If the common controls are not implemented at the highest impact level of the information systems, system owners will need to factor this situation into their assessments of risk and take appropriate risk mitigation actions (e.g., adding security controls or control enhancements, changing assigned values of security control parameters, implementing compensating controls, or changing certain aspects of mission/business processes). Implementing common controls that are less than\n\n39 The Chief Information Officer, Senior Information Security Officer, or other designated organizational officials at\nthe senior leadership level assign responsibility for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and\nmonitoring of common controls to appropriate entities (either internal or external to the organization).\n\n40 Each common control identified by the organization is reviewed for applicability to each specific organizational\ninformation system, typically by information system owners and authorizing officials.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### effective or that provide insufficient security capability for higher-impact information systems can have a significant adverse impact on organizational missions or business functions.\n\n Common controls are generally documented in the organization-wide information security program plan unless implemented as part of a specific information system, in which case the controls are documented in the security plan for that system.[41] Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents with references or pointers, as appropriate. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security program plan contains multiple documents, organizations specify in each document the organizational officials responsible for development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support multiple systems.  When common controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational information systems), the information security program plan indicates which separate security plan contains a description of the common controls.\n\n\n**_Implementation Tip_**\n\nThe selection of common controls is most effectively accomplished on an organization-wide basis\nwith the involvement of senior leadership (i.e., mission/business owners, authorizing officials, chief\ninformation officers, senior information security officers, information system owners, information\nowners/stewards, risk executives). These individuals have the collective knowledge to understand\norganizational priorities, the importance of organizational operations and assets, and the importance\nof the information systems that support those operations/assets. The senior leaders are also in the\nbest position to select the common controls for each security control baseline and assign specific\nresponsibilities for developing, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring those controls.\n\n\n###### Common controls, whether employed in organizational information systems or environments of operation, are authorized by senior officials with at least the same level of authority/responsibility for managing risk as the authorization officials for information systems inheriting the controls. Authorization results for common controls are shared with the appropriate information system owners and authorizing officials. A plan of action and milestones is developed and maintained for common controls that have been determined through independent assessments, to be less than effective. Information system owners dependent on common controls that are less than effective consider whether they are willing to accept the associated risk or if additional tailoring is required to address the weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls. Such risk-based decisions are influenced by available resources, the trust models employed by the organization, and the risk tolerance of authorizing officials and the organization.[42]\n\n41 Information security program plans are described in Appendix G. Organizations ensure that any security capabilities\nprovided by common controls (i.e., security capabilities inheritable by other organizational entities) are described in\nsufficient detail to facilitate adequate understanding of the control implementation by inheriting entities.\n\n42 NIST Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on trust models, including validated, direct historical, mediated,\nand mandated trust models.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Common controls are subject to the same assessment and monitoring requirements as system- specific controls employed in individual organizational information systems. Because common controls impact more than one system, a higher degree of confidence regarding the effectiveness of those controls may be required.\n\n Security controls not designated as common controls are considered system-specific or hybrid controls. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of information system owners and their respective authorizing officials. Organizations assign a hybrid status to security controls when one part of the control is common and another part of the control is system-specific. For example, an organization may choose to implement the Incident Response Policy and Procedures security control (IR-1) as a hybrid control with the policy portion of the control designated as common and the procedures portion of the control designated as system-specific. Hybrid controls may also serve as predefined templates for further control refinement. Organizations may choose, for example, to implement the Contingency Planning security control (CP-2) as a predefined template for a generalized contingency plan for all organizational information systems with information system owners tailoring the plan, where appropriate, for system-specific uses.\n\n Partitioning security controls into common, hybrid, and system-specific controls can result in significant savings to organizations in implementation and assessment costs as well as a more consistent application of security controls organization-wide. While security control partitioning into common, hybrid, and system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive conceptually, the actual application takes a significant amount of planning and coordination. At the information system level, determination of common, hybrid, or system-specific security controls follows the development of a tailored baseline. It is necessary to first determine what security capability is needed before organizations assign responsibility for how security controls are implemented, operated, and maintained.\n\n Security plans for individual information systems identify which security controls required for those systems have been designated by organizations as common controls and which controls have been designated as system-specific or hybrid controls. Information system owners are responsible for any system-specific implementation details associated with common controls. These implementation details are identified and described in the security plans for the individual information systems. Senior information security officers for organizations coordinate with common control providers (e.g., facility/site managers, human resources managers, intrusion detection system owners) to ensure that the required controls are developed, implemented, and assessed for effectiveness. Collectively, the security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information security program plans provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within organizations. \n\n The determination as to whether a security control is a common, hybrid, or system-specific is context-based. Security controls cannot be determined to be common, hybrid, or system-specific simply based on reviewing the language of the control. For example, a control may be system- specific for a particular information system, but at the same time that control could be a common control for another system, which would inherit the control from the first system. One indicator of whether a system-specific control may also be a common control for other information systems is to consider who or what depends on the functionality of that particular control. If a certain part of an information system or solution external to the system boundary depends on the control, then that control may be a candidate for common control identification.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**_Implementation Tip_**\n\n- Organizations consider the inherited risk from the use of common controls. Security plans,\nsecurity assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls (or a\nsummary of such information) are made available to information system owners (for systems\n_inheriting the controls) after the information is reviewed and approved by the senior official or_\nexecutive responsible and accountable for the controls.\n\n- Organizations ensure that common control providers keep control status information current\nsince the controls typically support multiple organizational information systems. Security plans,\nsecurity assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls are used\nby authorizing officials to make risk-based decisions in the security authorization process for\ntheir information systems and therefore, inherited risk from common controls is a significant\nfactor in such risk-based decisions.\n\n- Organizations ensure that common control providers have the capability to rapidly broadcast\nchanges in the status of common controls that adversely affect the protections being provided by\nand expected of the common controls. Common control providers inform system owners when\nproblems arise in the inherited common controls (e.g., when an assessment or reassessment of\na common control indicates the control is flawed or deficient in some manner, or when a new\nthreat or attack method arises that renders the common control less than effective in protecting\nagainst the new threat or attack method).\n\n- Organizations are encouraged to employ automated management systems to maintain records\nof the specific common controls employed in each organizational information system to enhance\nthe ability of common control providers to rapidly communicate with system owners.\n\n- If common controls are provided to organizations by entities external to the organization (e.g.,\nshared and/or external service providers), arrangements are made with the external/shared\nservice providers by the organization to obtain information on the effectiveness of the deployed\ncontrols. Information obtained from external organizations regarding effectiveness of common\ncontrols is factored into authorization decisions.\n\n\n###### 2.5  EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS\n\n Organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on information system services provided by external providers to conduct important missions and business functions. External information system services are computing and information technology services implemented outside of the traditional security authorization boundaries established by organizations for their information systems. Those traditional authorization boundaries linked to physical space and control of assets, are being extended (both physically and logically) with the growing use of external services. In this context, external services can be provided by: (i) entities within the organization but outside of the security authorization boundaries established for organizational information systems; (ii) entities outside of the organization either in the public sector (e.g., federal agencies) or private sector (e.g., commercial service providers); or (iii) some combination of the public and private sector options. External information system services include, for example, the use of service- oriented architectures (SOAs), cloud-based services (infrastructure, platform, software), or data center operations. External information system services may be used by, but are typically not part of, organizational information systems. In some situations, external information system services may completely replace or heavily augment the routine functionality of internal organizational information systems.\n\n FISMA and OMB policies require that federal agencies using external service providers to process, store, or transmit federal information or operate information systems on behalf of the\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### federal government, assure that such use meets the same security requirements that federal agencies are required to meet. Security requirements for external service providers including the security controls for external information systems are expressed in contracts or other formal agreements.[43] Organizations are responsible and accountable for the information security risk incurred by the use of information system services provided by external providers. Such risk is addressed by incorporating the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as part of the terms and conditions of the contracts with external providers. Organizations can require external providers to implement all steps in the RMF except the security authorization step, which remains an inherent federal responsibility directly linked to managing the information security risk related to the use of external information system services.[44] Organizations can also require external providers to provide appropriate evidence to demonstrate that they have complied with the RMF in protecting federal information. However, federal agencies take direct responsibility for the overall security of such services by authorizing the information systems providing the services.\n\n Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, service-level agreements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. The growing use of external service providers and new relationships being forged with those providers present new and difficult challenges for organizations, especially in the area of information system security. These challenges include:\n\n • Defining the types of external information system services provided to organizations;\n\n • Describing how those external services are protected in accordance with the information security requirements of organizations; and\n\n • Obtaining the necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of the external services is acceptable.\n\n The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in external service providers. In some cases, the level of trust is based on the amount of direct control organizations are able to exert on external service providers with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the protection of the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls.[45] The level of control is usually established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or service- level agreements with the external service providers and can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating contracts or agreements that specify detailed security requirements for the providers) to very limited control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity\n\n43 Organizations consult the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) when acquiring cloud\nservices from external providers. FedRAMP addresses required security controls and independent assessments for a\n[variety of cloud services. Additional information is available at http://www.fedramp.gov.](http://www.fedramp.gov/)\n\n44 To effectively manage information security risk, organizations authorize information systems of external providers\nthat are part of the information technologies or services (e.g., infrastructure, platform, or software) provided to the\nfederal government. Security authorization requirements are expressed in the terms and conditions of contracts with\nexternal providers of those information technologies and services.\n\n45 The level of trust that organizations place in external service providers can vary widely, ranging from those who are\nhighly trusted (e.g., business partners in a joint venture that share a common business model and common goals) to\nthose who are less trusted and represent greater sources of risk (e.g., business partners in one endeavor who are also\ncompetitors in another market sector). NIST Special Publication 800-39 describes different trust models that can be\nemployed by organizations when establishing relationships with external service providers.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### services such as commercial telecommunications services).[46] In other cases, levels of trust are based on factors that convince organizations that required security controls have been employed and that determinations of control effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external information system services provided to organizations through well-established lines of business relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable risk range of the authorizing officials and organizations using the services.\n\n The provision of services by external providers may result in certain services without explicit agreements between organizations and the providers. Whenever explicit agreements are feasible and practical (e.g., through contracts, service-level agreements), organizations develop such agreements and require the use of the security controls in Appendix F of this publication. When organizations are not in a position to require explicit agreements with external service providers (e.g., services are imposed on organizations, services are commodity services), organizations establish and document explicit assumptions about service capabilities with regard to security. In situations where organizations are procuring information system services through centralized acquisition vehicles (e.g., governmentwide contracts by the General Services Administration or other preferred and/or mandatory acquisition organizations), it may be more efficient and cost- effective for contract originators to establish and maintain stated levels of trust with external service providers (including the definition of required security controls and level of assurance with regard to the provision of such controls). Organizations subsequently acquiring information system services from centralized contracts can take advantage of the negotiated levels of trust established by the procurement originators and thus avoid costly repetition of activities necessary to establish such trust.[47] Centralized acquisition vehicles (e.g., contracts) may also require the active participation of organizations. For example, organizations may be required by provisions in contracts or agreements to install public key encryption-enabled client software recommended by external service providers.\n\n Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks arising from the use of external information system services remains with authorizing officials. Organizations require that appropriate chains of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with information system security. Organizations establish and retain a level of trust that participating service providers in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provide adequate protection for the services rendered to organizations. The chain of trust can be complicated due to the number of entities participating in the consumer-provider relationship and the types of relationships between the parties. External service providers may also outsource selected services to other external entities, making the chain of trust more difficult and complicated to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may find it impossible to place significant trust in external providers. This situation is due not to any inherent untrustworthiness on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services.[48]\n\n46 Commercial providers of commodity-type services typically organize their business models and services around the\nconcept of shared resources and devices for a broad and diverse customer base. Therefore, unless organizations obtain\nfully dedicated services from commercial service providers, there may be a need for greater reliance on compensating\nsecurity controls to provide the necessary protections for the information system that relies on those external services.\nOrganizational assessments of risk and risk mitigation activities reflect this situation.\n\n47 For example, procurement originators could authorize information systems providing external services to the federal\ngovernment under the specific terms and conditions of the contracts. Federal agencies requesting such services under\nthe terms of the contracts would not be required to reauthorize the information systems when acquiring such services\n(unless the request included services outside the scope of the original contracts).\n\n48 There may also be risk in disallowing certain functionality because of security concerns. Security is merely one of\nmultiple considerations in an overall risk determination.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or providers, organizations can: (i) mitigate the risk by employing compensating controls; (ii) accept the risk within the level of organizational risk tolerance; (iii) transfer risk by obtaining insurance to cover potential losses; or (iv) avoid risk by choosing not to obtain the services from certain providers (resulting in performance of missions/business operations with reduced levels of functionality or possibly no functionality at all).[49] For example, in the case of cloud-based information systems and/or services, organizations might require as a compensating control, that all information stored in the cloud be encrypted for added security of the information. Alternatively, organizations may require encrypting some of the information stored in the cloud (depending on the criticality or sensitivity of such information)—accepting additional risk but limiting the risk of not storing all information in an unencrypted form.\n\n 2.6  ASSURANCE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS\n\n Assurance and trustworthiness of information systems, system components, and information system services are becoming an increasingly important part of the risk management strategies developed by organizations. Whether information systems are deployed to support, for example, the operations of the national air traffic control system, a major financial institution, a nuclear power plant providing electricity for a large city, or the military services and warfighters, the systems must be reliable, trustworthy, and resilient in the face of increasingly sophisticated and pervasive threats. To understand how organizations achieve trustworthy systems and the role assurance plays in the trustworthiness factor, it is important to first define the term trust. Trust, in general, is the belief that an entity will behave in a predictable manner while performing specific functions, in specific environments, and under specified conditions or circumstances. The entity may be a person, process, information system, system component, system-of-systems, or any combination thereof. \n\n From an information security perspective, trust is the belief that a security-relevant entity will behave in a predictable manner when satisfying a defined set of security requirements under specified conditions/circumstances and while subjected to disruptions, human errors, component faults and failures, and purposeful attacks that may occur in the environment of operation. Trust is usually determined relative to a specific security capability[50] and can be decided relative to an individual system component or the entire information system. However, trust at the information system level is not achieved as a result of composing a security capability from a set of trusted system components—rather, trust at the system level is an inherently subjective determination that is derived from the complex interactions among entities (i.e., technical components, physical components, and individuals), taking into account the life cycle activities that govern, develop, operate, and sustain the system. In essence, to have trust in a security capability requires that there is a sufficient basis for trust, or trustworthiness, in the set of security-relevant entities that are to be composed to provide such capability. \n\n Trustworthiness with respect to information systems, expresses the degree to which the systems can be expected to preserve with some degree of confidence, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information that is being processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems across a range of threats. Trustworthy information systems are systems that are believed to be capable of operating within a defined risk tolerance despite the environmental disruptions, human errors,\n\n49 Alternative providers offering a higher basis for trust, usually at a higher cost, may be available.\n\n50 A security capability is a combination of mutually reinforcing security controls (i.e., safeguards/countermeasures)\nimplemented by technical means (i.e., functionality in hardware, software, and firmware), physical means (i.e., physical\ndevices and protective measures), and/or procedural means (i.e., procedures performed by individuals).\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### structural failures, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the environments in which the systems operate—systems that have the trustworthiness to successfully carry out assigned missions/business functions under conditions of stress and uncertainty.[51]\n\n\n**_Security Capability_**\n\nOrganizations can consider defining a set of security capabilities as a precursor to the security\ncontrol selection process. The concept of security capability is a construct that recognizes that the\nprotection of information being processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems, seldom\nderives from a single safeguard or countermeasure (i.e., security control). In most cases, such\nprotection results from the selection and implementation of a set of mutually reinforcing security\ncontrols. For example, organizations may wish to define a security capability for secure remote\nauthentication. This capability can be achieved by the selection and implementation of a set of\nsecurity controls from Appendix F (e.g., IA-2[1], IA-2[2], IA-2[8], IA-2[9], and SC-8[1]). Moreover,\nsecurity capabilities can address a variety of areas that can include, for example, technical means,\nphysical means, procedural means, or any combination thereof. Thus, in addition to the above\nfunctional capability for secure remote access, organizations may also need security capabilities that\naddress physical means such as tamper detection on a cryptographic module or anomaly\ndetection/analysis on an orbiting spacecraft.\n\nAs the number of security controls in Appendix F grows over time in response to an increasingly\nsophisticated threat space, it is important for organizations to have the ability to describe key security\ncapabilities needed to protect core organizational missions/business functions, and to subsequently\ndefine a set of security controls that if properly designed, developed, and implemented, produce\nsuch capabilities. This simplifies how the protection problem is viewed conceptually. In essence,\nusing the construct of security capability provides a shorthand method of grouping security controls\nthat are employed for a common purpose or to achieve a common objective. This becomes an\nimportant consideration, for example, when assessing security controls for effectiveness.\n\nTraditionally, assessments have been conducted on a control-by-control basis producing results that\nare characterized as pass (i.e., control satisfied) or fail (i.e., control not satisfied). However, the\nfailure of a single control or in some cases, the failure of multiple controls, may not affect the overall\nsecurity capability needed by an organization. Moreover, employing the broader construct of security\ncapability allows an organization to assess the severity of vulnerabilities discovered in its information\nsystems and determine if the failure of a particular security control (associated with a vulnerability) or\nthe decision not to deploy a certain control, affects the overall capability needed for mission/business\nprotection. It also facilitates conducting root cause analyses to determine if the failure of one security\ncontrol can be traced to the failure of other controls based on the established relationships among\ncontrols. Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the\ndegree to which the desired security capabilities have been effectively achieved and are meeting the\nsecurity requirements defined by an organization. These risk-based decisions are directly related to\norganizational risk tolerance that is defined as part of an organization’s risk management strategy.\n\n\n###### Two fundamental components affecting the trustworthiness of information systems are security functionality and security assurance. Security functionality is typically defined in terms of the security features, functions, mechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented within organizational information systems or the environments in which those systems operate. Security assurance is the measure of confidence that the security functionality is implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system—thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate and enforce established security policies. Security controls address both security functionality and\n\n51 While information is the primary area of concern, trustworthiness applies to the protections for all assets deemed\ncritical by organizations. Furthermore, protections are provided by technology (i.e., hardware, software, firmware),\nphysical elements (i.e., doors, locks, surveillance), and human elements (i.e., people, processes, procedures).\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### security assurance. Some controls focus primarily on security functionality (e.g., PE-3, Physical Access Control; IA-2, Identification and Authentication; SC-13, Cryptographic Protection; AC-2, Account Management). Other controls focus primarily on security assurance (e.g., CA-2, Security Assessment; SA-17, Developer Security Architecture and Design; CM-3, Configuration Change Control). Finally, certain security controls can support security functionality and assurance (e.g., RA-5, Vulnerability Scanning; SC-3, Security Function Isolation; AC-25, Reference Monitor). Security controls related to functionality are combined to develop a security capability with the assurance-related controls implemented to provide a degree of confidence in the capability within the organizational risk tolerance.\n\n Assurance Evidence—From Developmental and Operational Activities\n\n Organizations obtain security assurance by the actions taken by information system developers, implementers, operators, maintainers, and assessors. Actions by individuals and/or groups during the development/operation of information systems produce security evidence that contributes to the assurance, or measures of confidence, in the security functionality needed to deliver the security capability. The depth and coverage of these actions (as described in Appendix E) also contribute to the efficacy of the evidence and measures of confidence. The evidence produced by developers, implementers, operators, assessors, and maintainers during the system development life cycle (e.g., design/development artifacts, assessment results, warranties, and certificates of evaluation/validation) contributes to the understanding of the security controls implemented by organizations.\n\n The strength of security functionality[52] plays an important part in being able to achieve the needed security capability and subsequently satisfying the security requirements of organizations. Information system developers can increase the strength of security functionality by employing as part of the hardware/software/firmware development process: (i) well-defined security policies and policy models; (ii) structured/rigorous design and development techniques; and (iii) sound system/security engineering principles. The artifacts generated by these development activities (e.g., functional specifications, high-level/low-level designs, implementation representations\n [source code and hardware schematics], the results from static/dynamic testing and code analysis) can provide important evidence that the information systems (including the components that compose those systems) will be more reliable and trustworthy. Security evidence can also be generated from security testing conducted by independent, accredited, third-party assessment organizations (e.g., Common Criteria Testing Laboratories, Cryptographic/Security Testing Laboratories, and other assessment activities by government and private sector organizations).[53]\n\n In addition to the evidence produced in the development environment, organizations can produce evidence from the operational environment that contributes to the assurance of functionality and ultimately, security capability. Operational evidence includes, for example, flaw reports, records of remediation actions, the results of security incident reporting, and the results of organizational continuous monitoring activities. Such evidence helps to determine the effectiveness of deployed security controls, changes to information systems and environments of operation, and compliance with federal legislation, policies, directives, regulations, and standards. Security evidence,\n\n52 The security strength of an information system component (i.e., hardware, software, or firmware) is determined by\nthe degree to which the security functionality implemented within that component is correct, complete, resistant to\ndirect attacks (strength of mechanism), and resistant to bypass or tampering.\n\n53 For example, third-party assessment organizations assess cloud services and service providers in support of the\nFederal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). Common Criteria Testing Laboratories test and\nevaluate information technology products using ISO/IEC standard 15408. Cryptographic/Security Testing Laboratories\ntest cryptographic modules using the FIPS 140-2 standard.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### whether obtained from development or operational activities, provides a better understanding of security controls implemented and used by organizations. Together, the actions taken during the system development life cycle by developers, implementers, operators, maintainers, and assessors and the evidence produced as part of those actions, help organizations to determine the extent to which the security functionality within their information systems is implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting stated security requirements and enforcing or mediating established security policies—thus providing greater confidence in the security capability.\n\n\n**_The Compelling Argument for Assurance_**\n\nOrganizations specify assurance-related controls to define activities performed to generate relevant\nand credible evidence about the functionality and behavior of organizational information systems and\nto trace the evidence to the elements that provide such functionality/behavior. This evidence is used\nto obtain a degree of confidence that the systems satisfy stated security requirements—and do so\nwhile effectively supporting the organizational missions/business functions while being subjected to\nthreats in the intended environments of operation.\n\n\n###### With regard to the security evidence produced, the depth and coverage of such evidence can affect the level of assurance in the functionality implemented. Depth and coverage are attributes associated with assessment methods and the generation of security evidence. Assessment methods can be applied to developmental and operational assurance. For developmental assurance, depth is associated with the rigor, level of detail, and formality of the artifacts produced during the design and development of the hardware, software, and firmware components of information systems (e.g., functional specifications, high-level design, low-level design, source code). The level of detail available in development artifacts can affect the type of testing, evaluation, and analysis conducted during the system development life cycle (e.g., black-box testing, gray-box testing, white-box testing, static/dynamic analysis). For operational assurance, the depth attribute addresses the number and types of assurance-related security controls selected and implemented. In contrast, the coverage attribute is associated with the assessment methods employed during development and operations, addressing the scope and breadth of assessment objects included in the assessments (e.g., number/types of tests conducted on source code, number of software modules reviewed, number of network nodes/mobile devices scanned for vulnerabilities, number of individuals interviewed to check basic understanding of contingency responsibilities).[54]\n\n Addressing assurance-related controls during acquisition and system development can help organizations to obtain sufficiently trustworthy information systems and components that are more reliable and less likely to fail. These controls include ensuring that developers employ sound systems security engineering principles and processes including, for example, providing a comprehensive security architecture, and enforcing strict configuration management and control of information system and software changes. Once information systems are deployed, assurance- related controls can help organizations to continue to have confidence in the trustworthiness of the systems. These controls include, for example, conducting integrity checks on software and firmware components, conducting penetration testing to find vulnerabilities in organizational\n\n54 NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on the generation of security evidence related to security\nassessments conducted during the system development life cycle.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### information systems, monitoring established secure configuration settings, and developing policies/procedures that support the operation and use of the systems.\n\n The concepts described above, including security requirements, security capability, security controls, security functionality, and security assurance, are brought together in a model for trustworthiness for information systems and system components.

Determining what parts of the organization’s information technology infrastructure demand higher assurance of implemented security functionality is a Tier 1/Tier 2 risk management activity (see Figure 1 in Chapter Two). This type of activity occurs when organizations determine the security requirements necessary to protect organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Determining security requirements and the associated security capabilities needed to generate the appropriate protection is an integral part of the organizational risk management process described in NIST Special Publication 800- 39—specifically, in the development of the risk response strategy following the risk framing and risk assessment steps (where organizations establish priorities, assumptions, constraints, risk tolerance and assess threats, vulnerabilities, mission/business impacts, and likelihood of threat occurrence). After the security requirements and security capabilities are determined at Tiers 1 and 2 (including the necessary assurance requirements to provide measures of confidence in the desired capabilities), those requirements/capabilities are reflected in the design of the enterprise architecture, the associated mission/business processes, and the organizational information systems that are needed to support those processes. Organizations can use the Risk Management Framework (RMF), described in NIST Special Publication 800-37, to ensure that the appropriate assurance levels are achieved for the information systems and system components deployed to carry out core missions and business functions. This is primarily a Tier 3 activity but can have some overlap with Tiers 1 and 2, for example, in the area of common control selection.\n\n Trustworthy information systems are difficult to build from a software and systems development perspective. However, there are a number of design, architectural, and implementation principles that, if used, can result in more trustworthy systems. These core security principles include, for example, simplicity, modularity, layering, domain isolation, least privilege, least functionality, and resource isolation/encapsulation. Information technology products and systems exhibiting a higher degree of trustworthiness (i.e., products/systems having the requisite security functionality and security assurance) are expected to exhibit a lower rate of latent design/implementation flaws and a higher degree of penetration resistance against a range of threats including, for example, sophisticated cyber attacks, natural disasters, accidents, and intentional/unintentional errors.[55] The vulnerability and susceptibility of organizational missions/business functions and supporting information systems to known threats, the environments of operation where those systems are deployed, and the maximum acceptable level of information security risk, guide the degree of trustworthiness needed.\n\n Appendix E describes the minimum assurance requirements for federal information systems and organizations and highlights the assurance-related controls in the security control baselines in Appendix D needed to ensure that the requirements are satisfied.[56]\n\n55 Organizations also rely to a great extent on security assurance from an operational perspective as illustrated by the\nassurance-related controls in Tables E-1 through E-3. Operational assurance is obtained by other than developmental\nactions including for example, defining and applying security configuration settings on information technology\nproducts, establishing policies and procedures, assessing security controls, and conducting a rigorous continuous\nmonitoring program. In some situations, to achieve the necessary security capability with weak or deficient information\ntechnology, organizations compensate by increasing their operational assurance.\n\n56 CNSS Instruction 1253 designates security control baselines for national security systems. Therefore, the assurancerelated controls in the baselines established for the national security community, if so designated, may differ from those\ncontrols designated for non-national security systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**_Why Assurance Matters_**\n\nThe importance of security assurance can be described by using the example of a light switch on a\nwall in the living room of your house. Individuals can observe that by simply turning the switch on and\noff, the switch appears to be performing according to its functional specification. This is analogous to\nconducting black-box testing of security functionality in an information system or system component.\nHowever, the more important questions might be—\n\n- Does the light switch do anything else besides what it is supposed to do?\n\n- What does the light switch look like from behind the wall?\n\n- What types of components were used to construct the light switch and how was the switch\nassembled?\n\n- Did the switch manufacturer follow industry best practices in the development process?\n\nThis example is analogous to the many developmental activities that address the quality of the\nsecurity functionality in an information system or system component including, for example, design\nprinciples, coding techniques, code analysis, testing, and evaluation.\n\nThe security assurance requirements and associated assurance-related controls in Appendix E\naddress the light switch problem from the front of the wall perspective, and potentially from the\n_behind the wall perspective, depending on the measure of confidence needed about the component_\nin question. For organizational missions/business functions that are less critical (i.e., low impact),\nlower levels of assurance might be appropriate. However, as missions/business functions become\nmore important (i.e., moderate or high impact) and information systems and organizations become\nsusceptible to advanced persistent threats by high-end adversaries, increased levels of assurance\nmay be required. In addition, as organizations become more dependent on external information\nsystem services and providers, assurance becomes more important—providing greater insight and\nmeasures of confidence to organizations in understanding and verifying the security capability of\nexternal providers and the services provided to the federal government. Thus, when the potential\nimpact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation is\ngreat, an increasing level of effort must be directed at what is happening behind the wall.\n\n\n###### 2.7  REVISIONS AND EXTENSIONS\n\n The security controls listed in this publication represent the state-of-the-practice safeguards and countermeasures for federal information systems and organizations. The security controls[57] will be carefully reviewed and revised periodically to reflect:\n\n • Experience gained from using the controls;\n\n • New federal legislation, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, or policies;\n\n • Changing security requirements;\n\n • Emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack methods; and\n\n • Availability of new technologies.\n\n The security controls in the security control catalog are expected to change over time, as controls are withdrawn, revised, and added. The security controls defined in the low, moderate, and high baselines are also expected to change over time as the level of security and due diligence for mitigating risks within organizations changes. In addition to the need for change, the need for stability is addressed by requiring that proposed modifications to security controls go through a\n\n57 The privacy controls listed in Appendix J will also be updated on a regular basis using similar criteria.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### rigorous public review process to obtain both public and private sector feedback and to build consensus for such change.

This process, known as security categorization, is described in FIPS Publication 199.[58] The security categorization standard is based on a simple and well-established concept—that is, determining the potential adverse impact for organizational information systems. The results of security categorization help guide and inform the selection of appropriate security controls (i.e., safeguards and countermeasures) to adequately protect those information systems. The security controls selected for information systems are commensurate with the potential adverse impact on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation if there is a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. FIPS Publication 199 requires organizations to categorize information systems as low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact for the stated security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (RMF Step 1). The potential impact values assigned to the security objectives are the highest values (i.e., high water mark) from the security categories that have been determined for each type of information processed, stored, or transmitted by those information systems.[59] The generalized format for expressing the security category (SC) of an information system is:\n\n**SC** information system = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)},\n\nwhere the acceptable values for potential impact are low, moderate, or high.\n\n###### Since the potential impact values for confidentiality, integrity, and availability may not always be the same for a particular information system, the high water mark concept (introduced in FIPS Publication 199) is used in FIPS Publication 200 to determine the impact level of the information system for the express purpose of selecting the applicable security control baseline from one of the three baselines identified in Appendix D.[60] Thus, a low-impact system is defined as an information system in which all three of the security objectives are low. A moderate-impact system is an information system in which at least one of the security objectives is moderate and\n\n58 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security categorization guidance for national security systems.\n\n59 NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security\n_Categories, provides guidance on the assignment of security categories to information systems._\n\n60 The high water mark concept is employed because there are significant dependencies among the security objectives\nof confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In most cases, a compromise in one security objective ultimately affects\nthe other security objectives as well. Accordingly, security controls are not categorized by security objective. Rather,\nthe security controls are grouped into baselines to provide a general protection capability for classes of information\nsystems based on impact level.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### no security objective is greater than moderate. Finally, a high-impact system is an information system in which at least one security objective is high.\n\n\n**_Implementation Tip_**\n\nTo determine the impact level of an information system:\n\n###### • First, determine the different types of information that are processed, stored, or transmitted by the\ninformation system. NIST Special Publication 800-60 provides common information types.\n\n###### • Second, using the impact values in FIPS Publication 199 and the recommendations of NIST\nSpecial Publication 800-60, categorize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of each\ninformation type.\n\n###### • Third, determine the information system security categorization, that is, the highest impact value\nfor each security objective (confidentiality, integrity, availability) from among the categorizations\nfor the information types associated with the information system.\n\n###### • Fourth, determine the overall impact level of the information system from the highest impact value\namong the three security objectives in the system security categorization.\n\n**Note:** _For national security systems, organizations use CNSSI 1253 for security categorization._\n\n\n###### Once the impact level of the information system is determined, organizations begin the security control selection process (RMF Step 2). The first step in selecting and specifying security controls for the information system is to choose the appropriate security control baseline.[61] The selection of the security control baseline is based on the FIPS 200 impact level of the information system as determined by the security categorization process described above. The organization selects one of three security control baselines from Appendix D corresponding to the low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact rating of the information system.[62] Note that not all security controls are assigned to baselines, as indicated in Table D-2 by the phrase not selected. Similarly, as illustrated in Tables D-3 through D-19, not all control enhancements are assigned to baselines. Those control enhancements that are assigned to baselines are so indicated by an “x” in the low, moderate, or high columns. The use of the term baseline is intentional. The security controls and control enhancements in the baselines are a starting point from which controls/enhancements may be removed, added, or specialized based on the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2.\n\n The security control baselines in Appendix D address the security needs of a broad and diverse set of constituencies (including individual users and organizations). Some assumptions that generally underlie the baselines in Appendix D include, for example: (i) the environments in which organizational information systems operate; (ii) the nature of operations conducted by organizations; (iii) the functionality employed within information systems; (iv) the types of threats facing organizations, missions/business processes, and information systems; and (v) the type of information processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems. Articulating the underlying assumptions is a key element in the initial risk framing step of the risk management process described in NIST Special Publication 800-39. Some of the assumptions that underlie the baselines in Appendix D include:\n\n61 The general security control selection process may be augmented or further detailed by additional sector-specific\nguidance as described in Section 3.3, Creating Overlays, and Appendix I, template for developing overlays.\n\n62 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security control baselines for national security systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### • Information systems are located in physical facilities;\n\n • User data/information in organizational information systems is relatively persistent;[63]\n\n • Information systems are multi-user (either serially or concurrently) in operation;\n\n • Some user data/information in organizational information systems is not shareable with other users who have authorized access to the same systems;\n\n • Information systems exist in networked environments;\n\n • Information systems are general purpose in nature; and\n\n • Organizations have the necessary structure, resources, and infrastructure to implement the controls.[64]\n\n If one or more of these assumptions is not valid, then some of the security controls assigned to the initial baselines in Appendix D may not be applicable—a situation that can be readily addressed by applying the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 and the results of organizational assessments of risk. Conversely, there are also some possible situations that are specifically not addressed in the baselines. These include:\n\n • Insider threats exist within organizations;\n\n • Classified data/information is processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems;\n\n • Advanced persistent threats (APTs) exist within organizations;\n\n • Selected data/information requires specialized protection based on federal legislation, directives, regulations, or policies; and\n\n • Information systems need to communicate with other systems across different security domains.\n\n If any of the above assumptions apply, then additional security controls from Appendix F would likely be needed to ensure adequate protection—a situation that can also be effectively addressed by applying the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 (specifically, security control supplementation) and the results of organizational assessments of risk.\n\n 3.2  TAILORING BASELINE SECURITY CONTROLS\n\n After selecting the applicable security control baseline from Appendix D, organizations initiate the tailoring process to modify appropriately and align the controls more closely with the specific conditions within the organization (i.e., conditions related to organizational missions/business functions, information systems, or environments of operation). The tailoring process includes:\n\n • Identifying and designating common controls in initial security control baselines;\n\n • Applying scoping considerations to the remaining baseline security controls;\n\n • Selecting compensating security controls, if needed;\n\n63 Persistent data/information refers to data/information with utility for a relatively long duration (e.g., days, weeks).\n\n64 In general, federal departments and agencies will satisfy this assumption. The assumption becomes more of an issue\nfor nonfederal entities such as municipalities, first responders, and small (business) contractors. Such entities may not\nbe large enough or sufficiently resourced to have elements dedicated to providing the range of security capabilities that\nare assumed by the baselines. Organizations consider such factors in their risk-based decisions.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### • Assigning specific values to organization-defined security control parameters via explicit assignment and selection statements;\n\n • Supplementing baselines with additional security controls and control enhancements, if needed; and\n\n • Providing additional specification information for control implementation, if needed.\n\n The tailoring process, as an integral part of security control selection and specification, is part of a comprehensive organizational risk management process—framing, assessing, responding to, and monitoring information security risk. Organizations use risk management guidance to facilitate risk-based decision making regarding the applicability of security controls in the security control baselines. Ultimately, organizations use the tailoring process to achieve cost-effective, risk-based security that supports organizational mission/business needs. Tailoring activities are approved by authorizing officials in coordination with selected organizational officials (e.g., risk executive\n [function], chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system owners, common control providers) prior to implementing the security controls. Organizations have the flexibility to perform the tailoring process at the organization level for all information systems (either as a required tailored baseline or as the starting point for system-specific tailoring activities), in support of a particular line of business or mission/business process, at the individual information system level, or by using a combination of the above.[65]\n\n Conversely, organizations do not remove security controls for operational convenience. Tailoring decisions regarding security controls should be defensible based on mission/business needs and accompanied by explicit risk-based determinations.[66] Tailoring decisions, including the specific rationale for those decisions, are documented in the security plans for organizational information systems. Every security control from the applicable security control baseline is accounted for either by the organization (e.g., common control provider) or by the information system owner. If certain security controls are tailored out, then the associated rationale is recorded in security plans (or references/pointers to other relevant documentation are provided) for the information systems and approved by the responsible organizational officials as part of the security plan approval process.[67]\n\n Documenting significant risk management decisions in the security control selection process is imperative in order for authorizing officials to have the necessary information to make credible, risk-based decisions with regard to the authorization of information systems. Since information systems, environments of operation, and personnel associated with the system development life cycle are subject to change, providing the assumptions, constraints, and rationale supporting those important risk decisions allows for a better understanding in the future of the security state of the information systems or environments of operation at the time the original risk decisions were made and facilitates identifying changes, when previous risk decisions are revisited.\n\n65 See also Section 3.3, Creating Overlays, and Appendix I, template for developing overlays.\n\n66 Tailoring decisions can also be based on timing and applicability of selected security controls under certain defined\nconditions. That is, security controls may not apply in every situation or the parameter values for assignment statements\nmay change under certain circumstances. Overlays can define these special situations, conditions, or timing-related\nconsiderations.\n\n67 The level of detail required in documenting tailoring decisions in the security control selection process is at the\ndiscretion of organizations and reflects the impact levels of the respective information systems implementing or\ninheriting the controls.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Identifying and Designating Common Controls\n\n Common controls are controls that may be inherited by one or more organizational information systems. If an information system inherits a common control, then that system does not need to explicitly implement that control—that is, the security capability is being provided by another entity. Therefore, when the security controls in Appendix F call for an information system to implement or perform a particular security function, it should not be interpreted to mean that all systems that are part of larger, more complex systems or all components of a particular system need to implement the control or function. Organizational decisions on which security controls are designated as common controls may greatly affect the responsibilities of individual system owners with regard to the implementation of controls in a particular baseline. Common control selection can also affect the overall resource expenditures by organizations (i.e., the greater the number of common controls implemented, the greater potential cost savings).\n\n Applying Scoping Considerations\n\n Scoping considerations, when applied in conjunction with risk management guidance, provide organizations with a more granular foundation with which to make risk-based decisions.[68] The application of scoping considerations can eliminate unnecessary security controls from the initial security control baselines and help to ensure that organizations select only those controls that are needed to provide the appropriate level of protection for organizational information systems— protection based on the missions and business functions being supported by those systems and the environments in which the systems operate. Organizations may apply the scoping considerations described below to assist with making risk-based decisions regarding security control selection and specification—decisions that can potentially affect how the baseline security controls are applied and implemented by organizations:\n\n • CONTROL ALLOCATION AND PLACEMENT CONSIDERATIONS— The term information system can refer to systems at multiple levels of abstraction ranging from system-of-systems to individual single-user systems. The growing complexity of many information systems requires careful analysis in the allocation/placement of security controls within the three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (organization level, mission/business process level, and information system level) without imposing any specific architectural views or solutions.[69] Security controls in the initial baselines represent an information system-wide set of controls that may not be applicable to every component in the system. Security controls are applicable only to information system components that provide or support the information security capability addressed by the controls.[70] Organizations make explicit risk-based decisions about where to apply or allocate specific security controls in organizational information systems in order to achieve the needed security capability and to satisfy security requirements.[71] An example of this type of allocation is applying the\n\n68 The scoping considerations listed in this section are exemplary and not intended to limit organizations in rendering\nrisk-based decisions based on other organization-defined considerations with appropriate rationale.\n\n69 This is especially true with the advent of service-oriented architectures where specific services are provided to\nimplement a single function.\n\n70 For example, auditing controls are typically applied to components of an information system that provide auditing\ncapability (e.g., servers, etc.) and are not necessarily applied to every user-level workstation within the organization.\nOrganizations should carefully assess the inventory of components that compose their information systems to\ndetermine which security controls are applicable to the various components.\n\n71 As information technology advances, more powerful and diverse functionality can be found in smart phones, tablets,\nand other types of mobile devices. While tailor guidance may support not allocating a particular security control to a\nspecific technology or device, any residual risk associated with the absence of that control must be addressed in risk\nassessments to adequately protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### requirement from AC-18(1) (i.e., protecting wireless access to information systems using authentication/encryption) to all wireless access except for wireless access to visitor subnetworks which are not connected to other system components.\n\n • OPERATIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS— Several of the security controls in the baselines are based on the assumption of the existence of certain operational/environmental factors. Where these factors are absent or significantly diverge from the baseline assumptions, it is justifiable to tailor the baseline. Some of the more common operational/environmental factors include:\n\n - Mobility The mobility of physical hosting environments can impact the security controls selected for organizational information systems. As noted above, the set of security controls assigned to each baseline in Appendix D assumes the operation of information systems in fixed facilities and nonmobile locations. If those information systems operate primarily in mobile environments, the security control baseline should be tailored appropriately to account for the differences in mobility and accessibility of the specific locations where the systems reside. For example, many of the security controls in the Physical and Environmental Protection (PE) family that are selected in all three baselines reflect the assumption that the information systems reside in physical facilities/complexes that require appropriate physical protections. Such controls would likely not provide added value for mobile environments such as ships, aircraft, automobiles, vans, or space-based systems.[72]\n\n - Single-User Systems and Operations For information systems that are designed to operate as single-user systems (e.g., smart phones), several of the security controls that address sharing among users may not be needed. A single-user system or device refers to a system/device that is only intended to be used by a single individual over time (i.e., exclusive use). Systems or devices that are shared by multiple users over time are not considered single-user. Security controls such as AC-10, Concurrent Session Control, SC-4, Information in Shared Resources, and AC- 3, Access Enforcement[73] may not be required in single-user systems/operations and could reasonably be tailored out of the baseline at the discretion of organizations.\n\n - Data Connectivity and Bandwidth While many information systems are interconnected, there are some systems which for security or operational reasons, lack networking capabilities—that is, the systems are air gapped from the network. For nonnetworked systems, security controls such as AC-17, Remote Access, SC-8, Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity, and SC-7, Boundary Protection, are not applicable and may be tailored out of the security control baselines at the discretion of organizations. In addition to nonnetworked information systems, there are systems that have very limited or sporadic bandwidth (e.g., tactical systems that support warfighter or law enforcement missions). For such systems, the application of security controls would need to be examined carefully as the limited and/or sporadic bandwidth could impact the practicality of implementing those controls and the viability of adversaries staging cyber attacks over the limited bandwidth.\n\n72 The mobile nature of devices means that it is possible that, for some period of time, the devices may reside in fixed\nfacilities or complexes in fixed locations. During that time, the PE controls would likely apply.\n\n73 Organizations consider whether individual users have administrator privileges before removing AC-3 from security\ncontrol baselines.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### - Limited Functionality Systems or System Components What constitutes an information system under the E-Government Act of 2002 is quite broad. Fax machines, printers, scanners, pagers, smart phones, tablets, E-readers, and digital cameras can all be categorized as information systems (or system components). These types of systems and components may lack the general processing capabilities assumed in the security control baselines. The nature of these constraints may limit the types of threats that these systems face, and hence the appropriateness of some of the security controls. Thus, a control such as SI-3, Malicious Code Protection (required in all control baselines) may not be practical for information systems or components that are not capable of executing code (e.g., text-only pagers). However, because there is often no clear delineation between these types of information systems or components (e.g., smart phones combine the digital capabilities of telephones, cameras, and computers), it is important that the application of security controls to limited functionality systems or components be done judiciously and always take into account the intended use of the systems, system capabilities, and the risk of compromise.\n\n - Information and System Non-Persistence There is often an assumption that user information within organizational information systems is persistent for a considerable period of time. However, for some applications and environments of operation (e.g., tactical systems, industrial control systems), the persistence of user information is often very limited in duration. For information systems processing, storing, or transmitting such non-persistent information, several security controls in the Contingency Planning (CP) family such as CP-6, Alternate Storage Site, CP-7, Alternate Processing Site, and CP-9, Information System Backup, may not be practical and can be tailored out at the discretion of organizations. For similar reasons, controls such as MP-6, Media Sanitization, and SC-28, Protection of Information at Rest, are good candidates for removal through tailoring.[74] In addition to the non-persistence of information, the information systems/services may be non-persistent as well. This can be achieved by the use of virtualization techniques to establish non-persistent instantiations of operating systems and applications. Depending on the duration of the instantiations, some baseline controls might not be applicable.\n\n - Public Access When public access to organizational information systems is allowed, security controls should be applied with discretion since some security controls from the specified control baselines (e.g., identification and authentication, personnel security controls) may not be applicable for public access. Thus, in the case of the general public accessing federal government websites (e.g., to download publically accessible information such as forms, emergency preparedness information), security controls such as AC-7, Unsuccessful Logon Attempts, AC-17, Remote Access, IA-2, Identification and Authentication, IA-4, Identifier Management, and IA-5, Authenticator Management, typically would not be relevant for validating access authorizations or privileges. However, many of these controls would still be needed for identifying and authenticating organizational personnel that maintain and support information systems providing such public access websites and services. Similarly, many of the security controls may still be required for users accessing nonpublic information systems through such public interfaces, for example, to access or change personal information.\n\n74 Organizations balance information persistence with the sensitivity of the information. Non-persistent information\nmay still require sanitization after deletion. In addition, organizations consider the duration of information sensitivity—\nsome information may be persistent, but only be sensitive for a limited time.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### • SECURITY OBJECTIVE-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS— Security controls that support only one or two of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security objectives may be downgraded to the corresponding control in a lower baseline (or modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower baseline) only if the downgrading action: (i) reflects the FIPS Publication 199 security category for the supported security objective(s) before moving to the FIPS Publication 200 impact level (i.e., high water mark);[75] (ii) is supported by an organizational assessment of risk; and (iii) does not adversely affect the level of protection for the security-relevant information within the information system.[76] For example, if an information system is categorized as moderate impact using the high water mark concept because confidentiality and/or integrity are moderate but availability is low, there are several controls that only support the availability security objective and that potentially could be downgraded to low baseline requirements—that is, it may be appropriate not to implement CP-2(1) because the control enhancement supports only availability and is selected in the moderate baseline but not in the low baseline. The following security controls and control enhancements are potential candidates for downgrading:[77]\n\n - Confidentiality: AC-21, MA-3(3), MP-3, MP-4, MP-5, MP-5(4), MP-6(1), MP-6(2), PE- 4, PE-5, SC-4, SC-8, SC-8(1);\n\n - Integrity: CM-5, CM-5(1), CM-5(3), SC-8, SC-8(1), SI-7, SI-7(1), SI-7(5), SI-10; and\n\n - Availability: CP-2(1), CP-2(2), CP-2(3), CP-2(4), CP-2(5), CP-2(8), CP-3(1), CP-4(1), CP-4(2), CP-6, CP-6(1), CP-6(2), CP-6(3), CP-7, CP-7(1), CP-7(2), CP-7(3), CP-7(4), CP-8, CP-8(1), CP-8(2), CP-8(3), CP-8(4), CP-9(1), CP-9(2), CP-9(3), CP-9(5), CP- 10(2), CP-10(4), MA-6, PE-9, PE-10, PE-11, PE-11(1), PE-13(1), PE-13(2), PE-13(3), PE-15(1). \n\n • TECHNOLOGY-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS— Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography, public key infrastructure) are applicable only if those technologies are employed or are required to be employed within organizational information systems. Security controls that can be explicitly or implicitly supported by automated mechanisms do not require the development of such mechanisms if the mechanisms do not already exist or are not readily available in commercial or government off-the-shelf products. If automated mechanisms are not readily available,\n\n75 When applying the high water mark in Section 3.1, some of the original FIPS Publication 199 confidentiality,\nintegrity, or availability security objectives may have been upgraded to a higher security control baseline. As part of\nthis process, security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security objectives may\nhave been upgraded unnecessarily. Consequently, it is recommended that organizations consider appropriate and\nallowable downgrading actions to ensure cost-effective, risk-based application of security controls.\n\n76 Information that is security-relevant at the information system level (e.g., password files, network routing tables,\ncryptographic key management information) is distinguished from user-level information within the same system.\nCertain security controls are used to support the security objectives of confidentiality and integrity for both user-level\nand system-level information. Caution should be exercised in downgrading confidentiality or integrity-related security\ncontrols to ensure that downgrading actions do not result in insufficient protection for the security-relevant information\nwithin the information system. Security-relevant information must be protected at the high water mark in order to\nachieve a similar level of protection for any of the security objectives related to user-level information.\n\n77 Downgrading actions apply only to the moderate and high baselines. Security controls that are uniquely attributable\nto confidentiality, integrity, or availability that would ordinarily be considered as potential candidates for downgrading\n(e.g., AC-16, AU-10, IA-7, PE-12, PE-14, SC-5, SC-13, SC-16) are eliminated from consideration because the controls\nare either selected for use in all baselines and have no enhancements that could be downgraded, or the controls are\noptional and not selected for use in any baseline. Organizations should exercise caution when downgrading security\ncontrols that do not appear in the list in Section 3.2 to ensure that downgrading actions do not affect security objectives\nother than the objectives targeted for downgrading.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### cost-effective, or technically feasible, compensating security controls, implemented through nonautomated mechanisms or procedures, are used to satisfy specified security controls or control enhancements (see terms and conditions for applying compensating controls below).\n\n • MISSION REQUIREMENTS-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS— Some security controls may not be applicable (or appropriate) if implementing those controls has the potential to degrade, debilitate, or otherwise hamper critical organizational missions and/or business functions. For example, if the mission requires that an uninterrupted display of mission-critical information be available at an operator console (e.g., air traffic controller console), the implementation of AC-11, Session Lock, or SC-10, Network Disconnect, may not be appropriate.\n\n Selecting Compensating Security Controls\n\n Organizations may find it necessary on occasion to employ compensating security controls. Compensating controls are alternative security controls employed by organizations in lieu of specific controls in the low, moderate, or high baselines described in Appendix D—controls that provide equivalent or comparable protection for organizational information systems and the information processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems.[78] This may occur, for example, when organizations are unable to effectively implement specific security controls in the baselines or when, due to the specific nature of the information systems or environments of operation, the controls in the baselines are not a cost-effective means of obtaining the needed risk mitigation. Compensating controls are typically selected after applying the scoping considerations in the tailoring guidance to the applicable security control baseline. Compensating controls may be employed by organizations under the following conditions:\n\n • Organizations select compensating controls from Appendix F; if appropriate compensating controls are not available, organizations adopt suitable compensating controls from other sources;[79]\n • Organizations provide supporting rationale for how compensating controls provide equivalent security capabilities for organizational information systems and why the baseline security controls could not be employed; and\n\n • Organizations assess and accept the risk associated with implementing compensating controls in organizational information systems.\n\n Assigning Security Control Parameter Values\n\n Security controls and control enhancements containing embedded parameters (i.e., assignment and selection statements) give organizations the flexibility to define certain portions of controls and enhancements to support specific organizational requirements. After the initial application of scoping considerations and the selection of compensating controls, organizations review the security controls and control enhancements for assignment/selection statements and determine appropriate organization-defined values for the identified parameters. Parameter values may be prescribed by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Once organizations define the parameter values for security controls and control\n\n78 More than one compensating control may be required to provide the equivalent protection for a particular security\ncontrol in Appendix F. For example, organizations with significant staff limitations may compensate for the separation\nof duty security control by strengthening the audit, accountability, and personnel security controls.\n\n79 Organizations should make every attempt to select compensating controls from the security control catalog in\nAppendix F. Organization-defined compensating controls are employed only when organizations determine that the\nsecurity control catalog does not contain suitable compensating controls.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### enhancements, the assignments and selections become a part of the control and enhancement.[80] Organizations may choose to specify the values for security control parameters before selecting compensating controls since the specification of the parameters completes the control definitions and may affect compensating control requirements. There can also be significant benefits in collaborating on the development of parameter values. For organizations that work together on a frequent basis, it may be useful for those organizations to develop a mutually agreeable set of uniform values for security control parameters. Doing so may assist organizations in achieving a greater degree of reciprocity when depending upon the information systems and/or services offered by other organizations.\n\n Supplementing Security Control Baselines\n\n The final determination of the appropriate set of security controls necessary to provide adequate security for organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate is a function of the assessment of risk and what is required to sufficiently mitigate the risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.[81] In many cases, additional security controls or control enhancements (beyond those controls and enhancements contained in the baselines in Appendix D) will be required to address specific threats to and vulnerabilities in organizations, mission/business processes, and/or information systems and to satisfy the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations.[82] The risk assessment in the security control selection process provides essential information in determining the necessity and sufficiency of the security controls and control enhancements in the initial baselines. Organizations are encouraged to make maximum use of Appendix F to facilitate the process of supplementing the initial baselines with additional security controls and/or control enhancements.[83]\n\n Situations Requiring Potential Baseline Supplementation\n\n Organizations may be subject to conditions that, from an operational, environmental, or threat perspective, warrant the selection and implementation of additional (supplemental) controls to achieve adequate protection of organizational missions/business functions and the information systems supporting those missions/functions. Examples of conditions and additional controls that might be required are provided below.\n\n • ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT Security control baselines do not assume that the current threat environment is one where adversaries have achieved a significant foothold and presence within organizations and organizational information systems—that is, organizations are dealing with an advanced persistent threat (APT). Adversaries continue to attack organizational information systems and the information technology infrastructure and are successful in some aspects of such attacks. To more fully address the advanced persistent threat, concepts such as insider threat\n\n80 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides assignment of minimum values for organization-defined variables applicable to\nnational security systems. Parameter values can also be defined as part of overlays described in Section 3.4.\n\n81 Considerations for potential national-level impacts and impacts to other organizations in categorizing organizational\ninformation systems derive from the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives.\n\n82 In previous versions of Special Publication 800-53, tailoring referred only to the removal of security controls from\nbaselines and supplementation referred only to the addition of controls to baselines. In this document, the term tailoring\nhas been redefined to include both the addition of security controls to baselines (i.e., tailoring up) and the removal of\ncontrols from baselines (i.e., tailoring down).\n\n83 Security controls and control enhancements selected to supplement baselines are allocated to appropriate information\nsystem components in the same manner as the control allocations carried out by organizations in the initial baselines.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### protection (CM-5(4)), heterogeneity (SC-29), deception (SC-26 and SC-30), non-persistence (SC-25 and SC-34), and segmentation (SC-7(13)) can be considered.\n\n • CROSS-DOMAIN SERVICES Security control baselines do not assume that information systems have to operate across multiple security domains. The baselines assume a flat view of information flows (i.e., the same security policies in different domains when information moves across authorization boundaries). To address cross-domain services and transactions, some subset of the AC-4 security control enhancements can be considered to ensure adequate protection of information when transferred between information systems with different security policies. \n\n • MOBILITY The use of mobile devices might result in the need for additional security controls and control enhancements not selected in the initial baselines. For example, AC-7(2), which requires the purging/wiping of information after an organization-defined number of unsuccessful logon attempts, or MP-6 (8), which requires the capability for remote purging/wiping, could be selected in order to address the threat of theft or loss of mobile devices.\n\n • CLASSIFIED INFORMATION In some environments, classified and sensitive information[84] may be resident on national security systems without all users having the necessary authorizations to access all of the information. In those situations, additional security controls are required to ensure that information requiring strict separation is not accessed by unauthorized users. More stringent access controls include, for example, AC-3(3) and AC-16. When classified information is being processed, stored, or transmitted on information systems that are jointly owned by multiple entities (e.g., coalition partners in military alliances), more restrictive controls for maintenance personnel may be required including, for example, MA-5(4).\n\n Processes for Identifying Additional Needed Security Controls\n\n Organizations can employ a requirements definition approach or a gap analysis approach in selecting security controls and control enhancements to supplement initial baselines. In the requirements definition approach, organizations obtain specific and credible threat[85] information (or make reasonable assumptions) about the activities of adversaries with certain capabilities or attack potential (e.g., skill levels, expertise, available resources). To effectively withstand cyber attacks from adversaries with the stated capabilities or attack potential, organizations strive to achieve a certain level of defensive capability or cyber preparedness. Organizations can select additional security controls and control enhancements from Appendix F to obtain such defensive capability or level of preparedness. In contrast to the requirements definition approach, the gap analysis approach begins with an organizational assessment of its current defensive capability or level of cyber preparedness. From that initial capability assessment, organizations determine the types of threats they can reasonably expect to counter. If the current organizational defensive capabilities or levels of cyber preparedness are insufficient, the gap analysis determines the required capabilities and levels of preparedness. Organizations subsequently define the security controls and control enhancements from Appendix F needed to achieve the desired capabilities or cyber-preparedness levels. Both of the approaches described above require timely and accurate\n\n84 The example is illustrative only. CNSS Instruction 1253 provides specific guidance regarding security controls\nrequired for national security systems.\n\n85 While this example focuses on threats to information systems from purposeful attacks, the threat space of concern to\norganizations also includes environmental disruptions and human errors.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### threat information. It is essential that organizations work with the appropriate threat identification component to obtain such information.\n\n During the tailoring process, organizations consider reevaluating the priority codes from the security control baselines to determine if any changes to those priorities are appropriate. This is especially important when adding security controls that are not included in any of the baselines, because those controls have priority codes of P0. The reevaluation of priority codes can be based on organizational assessments of risk or design/developmental decisions related to the security architecture or the systems and security engineering process that may require certain sequencing in security control implementation.\n\n Enhancing Information Security without Changing Control Selection\n\n There may be situations in which organizations cannot apply sufficient security controls within their information systems to adequately reduce or mitigate risk (e.g., when using certain types of information technologies or employing certain computing paradigms). Therefore, alternative strategies are needed to prevent organizational missions/business functions from being adversely affected— strategies that consider the mission and business risks resulting from an aggressive use of information technology. Restrictions on the types of technologies used and how organizational information systems are employed provide an alternative method to reduce or mitigate risk that may be used in conjunction with, or instead of, supplemental security controls. Restrictions on the use of information systems and specific information technologies may be, in some situations, the only practical or reasonable actions organizations can take in order to have the capability to carry out assigned missions/business functions in the face of determined adversaries. Examples of use restrictions include:\n\n • Limiting the information that information systems can process, store, or transmit or the manner in which organizational missions/business functions are automated;\n\n • Prohibiting external access to organizational information by removing selected information system components from networks (i.e., air gapping); and\n\n • Prohibiting moderate- or high-impact information on organizational information system components to which the public has access, unless an explicit risk determination is made authorizing such access.\n\n Providing Additional Specification Information for Control Implementation\n\n Since security controls are statements of security capability at higher levels of abstraction, the controls may lack sufficient information for successful implementation. Therefore, additional detail may be necessary to fully define the intent of a given security control for implementation purposes and to ensure that the security requirements related to that control are satisfied. For example, additional information may be provided as part of the process of moving from control to specification requirement, and may involve refinement of implementation details, refinement of scope, or iteration to apply the same control differently to different scopes. Organizations ensure that if existing security control information (e.g., selection and assignment statements) is not sufficient to fully define the intended application of the control, such information is provided. Organizations have the flexibility to determine whether additional detail is included as a part of the control statement, in supplemental guidance, or in a separate control addendum section. When providing additional detail, organizations are cautioned not to change the intent of the security control or modify the original language in the control. The additional implementation information can be documented either in security plans or systems and security engineering plans. The type of\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### additional detail that might be necessary to fully specify a security control for implementation purposes is provided in the SI-7(6) example below:\n\n**SI-7** **SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY**\n\n**(6)** _SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION_\n\n**The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to**\n**software, firmware, and information.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Cryptographic mechanisms used for the protection of integrity include,\nfor example, digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using\nasymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash,\nand using the public key to verify the hash information. Related control: SC-13.\n\nAdditional implementation detail for SI-7(6):\n\n_Digital signatures are applied to all traffic for which non-repudiation is required employing_\n_SHA-256 or another approved NIST algorithm demonstrably of at least the same strength of_\n_mechanism._\n\n###### 3.3  CREATING OVERLAYS\n\n The previous sections described the process of tailoring security control baselines to achieve a more focused and relevant security capability for organizations. In certain situations, it may be beneficial for organizations to apply tailoring guidance to the baselines to develop a set of security controls for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or unique missions/environments of operation.[86] For example, the federal government may decide to establish a governmentwide set of security controls and implementation guidance for: (i) public key infrastructure (PKI) systems that could be uniformly applied to all PKI systems implemented within federal agencies; (ii) cloud-based information systems that are uniformly applied to all federal agencies procuring or implementing cloud services; or (iii) industrial control systems (ICSs) at federal facilities producing electric power or controlling environmental systems in federal facilities. Alternatively, to address particular communities of interest with specialized requirements, the Department of Defense, for example, may decide to establish a set of security controls and implementation guidance for its tactical operations and environments by applying the tailoring guidance to the standard security control baselines for national security systems to achieve more specialized solutions. In each of the above examples, tailored baselines can be developed for each information technology area or for the unique circumstances/environments and promulgated to large communities of interest—thus achieving standardized security capabilities, consistency of implementation, and cost-effective security solutions.\n\n To address the need for developing community-wide and specialized sets of security controls for information systems and organizations, the concept of overlay is introduced. An overlay is a fully specified set of security controls, control enhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from the application of tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 to security control baselines in Appendix D.[87] Overlays complement the initial security control baselines by: (i) providing the opportunity to add or eliminate controls; (ii) providing security control applicability and interpretations for specific information technologies, computing paradigms, environments of operation, types of information systems, types of missions/operations, operating modes, industry sectors, and statutory/regulatory requirements; (iii) establishing community-wide parameter values for assignment and/or selection statements in security controls and control enhancements; and (iv) extending the supplemental guidance for security controls, where necessary. Organizations typically use the overlay concept\n\n86 This type of tailoring can be conducted at the federal level or by individual organizations.\n\n87 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides tailoring guidance and security control baselines for national security systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### when there is divergence from the basic assumptions used to create the initial security control baselines (see Section 3.1). If organizations are not divergent from the basic assumptions for the initial baselines, there is likely no need to create an overlay. Alternatively, the baselines may be missing key assumptions which would justify creating an overlay with additional assumptions.\n\n The full range of tailoring activities can be employed by organizations to provide a disciplined and structured approach for developing tailored baselines supporting the areas described above. Overlays provide an opportunity to build consensus across communities of interest and develop security plans for organizational information systems that have broad-based support for very specific circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. Categories of overlays that may be useful include, for example:\n\n • Communities of interest, industry sectors, or coalitions/partnerships (e.g., healthcare, law enforcement, intelligence, financial, transportation, energy, allied collaboration/sharing);\n\n • Information technologies/computing paradigms (e.g., cloud/mobile, PKI, Smart Grid, cross- domain solutions);\n\n • Environments of operation (e.g., space, tactical);\n\n • Types of information systems and operating modes (e.g., industrial/process control systems, weapons systems, single-user systems, standalone systems);\n\n • Types of missions/operations (e.g., counterterrorism, first responders, research, development, test, and evaluation); and\n\n • Statutory/regulatory requirements (e.g., Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Privacy Act).\n\n Organizations can effectively use the risk management concepts defined in NIST Special Publication 800-39 when developing overlays. The successful development of overlays requires the involvement of: (i) information security professionals who understand the specific subject area that is the focus of the overlay development effort; and (ii) subject matter experts in the overlay area who understand the security controls in Appendix F and the initial baselines in Appendix D. The format and structure for developing overlays is provided in Appendix I.\n\n Multiple overlays can be applied to a single security control baseline. The tailored baselines that result from the overlay development process may be more or less stringent than the original security control baselines. Risk assessments provide information necessary to determine if the risk from implementing the tailored baselines falls within the risk tolerance of the organizations or communities of interest developing the overlays. If multiple overlays are employed, it is possible that there could be a conflict between the overlays. If the use of multiple overlays results in conflicts between the application or removal of security controls, the authorizing official (or designee), in coordination with the mission/business owner and/or information owner/steward, can resolve the conflict. In general, overlays are intended to reduce the need for ad hoc tailoring of baselines by organizations through the selection of a set of controls and control enhancements that more closely correspond to common circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. However, the use of overlays does not preclude organizations from performing further tailoring to reflect organization-specific needs, assumptions, or constraints. Tailoring of overlays is accomplished within the constraints defined within the overlay and may require the concurrence/approval of the authorizing official or other organization-designated individuals. For example, an overlay created for an industrial control system (ICS) may require tailoring for applicability to a specific type of ICS and its environment of operation. But it is anticipated that the use of overlays would greatly reduce the number and extent of organization-specific ad hoc tailoring.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### 3.4  DOCUMENTING THE CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS\n\n Organizations document the relevant decisions taken during the security control selection process, providing a sound rationale for those decisions. This documentation is essential when examining the security considerations for organizational information systems with respect to the potential mission/business impact. The resulting set of security controls and the supporting rationale for the selection decisions (including any information system use restrictions required by organizations) are documented in the security plans. Documenting significant risk management decisions in the security control selection process is imperative so that authorizing officials can have access to the necessary information to make informed authorization decisions for organizational information systems.[88] Without such information, the understanding, assumptions, constraints, and rationale supporting those risk management decisions will, in all likelihood, not be available when the state of the information systems or environments of operation change, and the original risk decisions are revisited. Figure 4 summarizes the security control selection process, including the selection of initial baselines and the tailoring of the baselines by applying the guidance in Section 3.2.\n\n**Tailoring Guidance**\n\n                      - Identifying and Designating Common Controls\n\n                      - Applying Scoping Considerations\n\n**INITIAL**        - Selecting Compensating Controls **TAILORED**\n**SECURITY**      - Assigning Security Control Parameter Values **SECURITY**\n**CONTROL**      - Supplementing Baseline Security Controls **CONTROL**\n**BASELINE**      - Providing Additional Specification Information **BASELINE**\n**(Low, Mod, High)** _for Implementation_ **(Low, Mod, High)**\n\n**Creating Overlays**\n\n**_Before Tailoring_** **_After Tailoring_**\n\n**Assessment of Organizational Risk**\n\n**DOCUMENT SECURITY CONTROL DECISIONS**\n\n**Rationale that the agreed-upon set of security controls for the information system provide adequate**\n**protection of organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.**\n\n**FIGURE 4: SECURITY CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS**\n\n###### Iterative and Dynamic Nature of Security Control Tailoring\n\n The security control tailoring process described above, while appearing to be sequential in nature, can also have an iterative aspect. Organizations may choose to execute the tailoring steps in any order based on organizational needs and the information generated from risk assessments. For example, some organizations may establish the parameter values for security controls in the initial baselines prior to selecting compensating controls. Other organizations may delay completing assignment and selection statements in the controls until after the supplementation activities have been completed. Organizations may also discover that when fully specifying security controls for the intended environments of operation, there may be difficulties that arise which may trigger the need for additional (supplemental) controls. Finally, the security control tailoring process is not static—that is, organizations revisit the tailoring step as often as needed based on ongoing organizational assessments of risk.\n\n88 The security control selection process also applies to common control providers and the authorizing officials\nrendering authorization decisions for common controls deployed within organizations.\n\n\n**Tailoring Guidance**\n\n                      - Identifying and Designating Common Controls\n\n                      - Applying Scoping Considerations\n\n**INITIAL**        - Selecting Compensating Controls **TAILORED**\n**SECURITY**      - Assigning Security Control Parameter Values **SECURITY**\n**CONTROL**      - Supplementing Baseline Security Controls **CONTROL**\n**BASELINE**      - Providing Additional Specification Information **BASELINE**\n**(Low, Mod, High)** _for Implementation_ **(Low, Mod, High)**\n\n**Creating Overlays**\n\n**_Before Tailoring_** **_After Tailoring_**\n\n**Assessment of Organizational Risk**\n\n**DOCUMENT SECURITY CONTROL DECISIONS**\n\n**Rationale that the agreed-upon set of security controls for the information system provide adequate**\n**protection of organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.**\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### In addition to the iterative and dynamic nature of the security control tailoring process, there may also be side effects as controls are added and removed from the baselines. Security controls in Appendix F can have some degree of dependency and functional overlap with other controls. In many cases, security controls work together to achieve a security capability. Thus, removing a particular security control from a baseline during the tailoring process may have unintended side effects (and potentially adverse impacts) on the remaining controls. Alternatively, adding a new security control to a baseline during the tailoring process may eliminate or reduce the need for certain specific controls because the new control provides a better security capability than the capability provided by other controls. For example, if organizations implement SC-30(2) using virtualization techniques to randomly/frequently deploy diverse and changing operating systems and applications, this approach could potentially limit the requirement to update the security configurations in CM-2(2). Therefore, the addition or removal of security controls is viewed with regard to the totality of the information security needs of the organization and its information systems, and not simply with regard to the controls being added or removed.\n\n\n**_Implementation Tip_**\n\nIn diverging from the security control baselines during the tailoring process, organizations consider\nsome very important linkages between various controls and control enhancements. These linkages\nare captured in the selection of controls and enhancements in the baselines and are especially\nsignificant when developing overlays (described in Section 3.3 and Appendix I). In some instances,\nthe linkages are such that it is not meaningful to include a security control or control enhancement\nwithout some other control or enhancement. The totality of the controls and enhancements provide a\nrequired security capability. Some linkages are obvious such as the linkage between Mandatory\nAccess Control enhancement (AC-3(3)) and Security Attributes (AC-16). But other linkages may be\nmore subtle. This is especially true in the case where the linkage is between security functionalityrelated controls and security assurance-related controls as described in Appendix E. For example, it\nis not particularly meaningful to implement AC-3(3) without also implementing a Reference Monitor\n(AC-25). Organizations are encouraged to pay careful attention to the related controls section of the\n_Supplemental Guidance for the security controls to help in identifying such linkages._\n\n\n###### Other Considerations\n\n Organizational tailoring decisions are not carried out in a vacuum. While such decisions are rightly focused on information security considerations, it is important that the decisions be aligned with other risk factors that organizations address routinely. Risk factors such as cost, schedule, and performance are considered in the overall determination of which security controls to employ in organizational information systems and environments of operation. For example, in military command and control systems in which lives may be at stake, the adoption of security controls is balanced with operational necessity. With respect to the air traffic control system and consoles used by air traffic controllers, the need to access the consoles in real time to control the air space outweighs the security need for an AC-11, Session Lock. In short, the security control selection process (to include tailoring activities described in Section 3.2) should be integrated into the overall risk management process as described in NIST Special Publication 800-39.\n\n Finally, organizations factor scalability into the security control selection process—that is, controls are scalable with regard to the extent/rigor of the implementation. Scalability is guided by the FIPS Publication 199 security categorizations and the associated FIPS Publication 200 impact levels of the information systems where the controls are to be applied. For example, contingency plans for high-impact information systems may contain significant amounts of\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### implementation detail and be quite lengthy. In contrast, contingency plans for low-impact systems may contain considerably less detail and be quite succinct. Organizations use discretion in applying the security controls to organizational information systems, giving consideration to the scalability factors in particular operational environments. Scaling controls to the appropriate system impact level facilitates a more cost-effective, risk-based approach to security control implementation—expending only the level of resources necessary to achieve sufficient risk mitigation and adequate security.\n\n\n**_Implementation Tip_**\n\nMaintaining a record of security control selection and control status can be addressed in one or\nmultiple documents or security plans. If using multiple documents, consider providing references to\nthe necessary information in the relevant documents rather than requiring duplication of information.\nUsing references to relevant documentation reduces the amount of time and resources needed by\norganizations to generate such information. Other benefits include greater security awareness and\nunderstanding of the information system capabilities. Increased security awareness/understanding\nsupports more effective integration of information security into organizational information systems.\n\n\n###### 3.5  NEW DEVELOPMENT AND LEGACY SYSTEMS\n\n The security control selection process described in this section can be applied to organizational information systems from two different perspectives: (i) new development; and (ii) legacy. For new development systems, the security control selection process is applied from a requirements definition perspective since the systems do not yet exist and organizations are conducting initial security categorizations. The security controls included in the security plans for the information systems serve as a security specification and are expected to be incorporated into the systems during the development and implementation phases of the system development life cycle. In contrast, for legacy information systems, the security control selection process is applied from a gap analysis perspective when organizations are anticipating significant changes to the systems (e.g., during major upgrades, modifications, or outsourcing). Since the information systems already exist, organizations in all likelihood have completed the security categorization and security control selection processes resulting in the establishment of previously agreed-upon security controls in the respective security plans and the implementation of those controls within the information systems. Therefore, the gap analysis can be applied in the following manner:\n\n • First, reconfirm or update as necessary, the security category and impact level for the information system based on the types of information that are currently being processed, stored, or transmitted by the system.\n\n • Second, review the existing security plan that describes the security controls that are currently employed considering any updates to the security category and information system impact level as well as any changes to the organization, mission/business processes, the system, or the operational environment. Reassess the risk and revise the security plan as necessary, including documenting any additional security controls that would be needed by the system to ensure that the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, remains at an acceptable level.\n\n • Third, implement the security controls described in the updated security plan, document in the plan of action and milestones any controls not implemented, and continue with the remaining steps in the Risk Management Framework in the same manner as a new development system.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Applying Gap Analyses to External Service Providers\n\n The gap analysis perspective is also applied when interacting with external service providers. As described in Section 2.5, organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on external providers for information system services. Using the steps in the gap analysis described above, organizations can effectively use the acquisition process and appropriate contractual vehicles to require external providers to carry out the security categorization and security control selection steps in the RMF.  The resulting information can help determine what security controls the external provider either has in place or intends to implement for the information system services that are to be provided.  If a security control deficit exists, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks arising from the use of external information system services remains with authorizing officials. In such situations, organizations can reduce the organizational risk to an acceptable level by:\n\n • Using the existing contractual vehicle to require the external provider to meet the additional security control requirements established by the organization;\n\n • Negotiating with the provider for additional security controls if the existing contractual vehicle does not provide for such added requirements;\n\n • Approving the use of compensating controls by the provider; or\n\n • Employing alternative risk mitigation actions[89] within the organizational information system when a contract either does not exist or the contract does not provide the necessary leverage for organizations to obtain the needed security controls.\n\n\n**_Implementation Tip_**\n\nMany organizations operate and maintain complex information systems, often referred to as a\nsystem-of-systems. Enterprise architecture plays a key part in the security control selection process\nfor these types of information systems. Organizations can address the complex system problem by\ndividing the system into two or more subsystems and applying the FIPS 199 security categorization\nand FIPS 200 impact level determination to each subsystem. Applying separate impact levels to\neach subsystem does not change the overall impact level of the information system; rather, it allows\nconstituent subsystems to receive a separate allocation of security controls instead of deploying\nhigher-impact controls across every subsystem. It is not valid to treat the subsystems as entirely\nindependent entities, however, since the subsystems are interdependent and interconnected.\n\nOrganizations develop security architectures to allocate security controls among subsystems\nincluding monitoring and controlling communications at key internal boundaries within the system\nand provide system-wide controls that meet or exceed the highest information system impact level of\nthe constituent subsystems inheriting security capabilities from those controls. Organizations also\nconsider that replicated subsystems within complex systems may exhibit common vulnerabilities that\ncan be exploited by common threat sources—thereby negating the redundancy that might be relied\nupon as a risk mitigation measure. The impact due to a security incident against one constituent\nsubsystem might cascade and impact many subsystems at the same time.\n\n\n89 For example, local policies, procedures, and/or compensating controls could be established by organizations to serve\nas alternative mitigation actions for risks identified in a gap analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### APPENDIX A\n\n REFERENCES\n\nLAWS, POLICIES, DIRECTIVES, REGULATIONS, MEMORANDA, STANDARDS, AND GUIDELINES\n\n\n**LEGISLATION AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS**\n\n\n###### 1.

If a security control is not used in a particular baseline, the entry is marked not selected. Security control enhancements, when used to supplement security controls, are indicated by the number of the enhancement. For example, the IR-2 (1) (2) entry in the high baseline for IR-2 indicates that the second control from the Incident Response family has been selected along with control enhancements (1) and (2). Some security controls and enhancements are not used in any of the baselines in this appendix but are available for use by organizations if needed. This situation occurs, for example, when the results of a risk assessment indicate the need for additional security controls or control enhancements in order to adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. \n\n Organizations can use the recommended priority code designation associated with each security control in the baselines to assist in making sequencing decisions for control implementation (i.e., a Priority Code 1 [P1] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 2 [P2] control; a Priority Code 2 [P2] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 3 [P3] control, and a Priority Code 0 [P0] indicates the security control is not selected in any baseline). This recommended sequencing prioritization helps ensure that security controls upon which other controls depend are implemented first, thus enabling organizations to deploy controls in a more structured and timely manner in accordance with available resources. The implementation of security controls by sequence priority code does not imply any defined level of risk mitigation until all controls in the security plan have been implemented. The priority codes are used only for implementation sequencing, not for making security control selection decisions. Table D-1 summarizes sequence priority codes for the baseline security controls in Table D-2.\n\n**TABLE D-1: SECURITY CONTROL PRIORITIZATION CODES**\n\n**Priority Code** **Sequencing** **Action**\n\nPriority Code 1 (P1) FIRST Implement P1 security controls first.\n\nPriority Code 2 (P2) NEXT Implement P2 security controls after implementation of P1 controls.\n\nPriority Code 3 (P3) LAST Implement P3 security controls after implementation of P1 and P2 controls.\n\nUnspecified Priority Code (P0) NONE Security control not selected in any baseline.\n\n90 A complete description of all security controls is provided in Appendices F and G. In addition, separate documents\n[for individual security control baselines (listed as Annexes 1, 2, and 3) are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications)\n[An online version of the catalog of security controls is also available at http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home.](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home)\n\n91 The hierarchical nature applies to the security requirements of each control (i.e., the base control plus all of its\nenhancements) at the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact level in that the control requirements at a\nparticular impact level (e.g., CP-4 Contingency Plan Testing—Moderate: CP-4(1)) meets a stronger set of security\nrequirements for that control than the next lower impact level of the same control (e.g., CP-4 Contingency Plan\n_Testing—Low: CP-4)._\n\n|Priority Code|Sequencing|Action|\n|---|---|---|\n|Priority Code 1 (P1)|FIRST|Implement P1 security controls first.|\n|Priority Code 2 (P2)|NEXT|Implement P2 security controls after implementation of P1 controls.|\n|Priority Code 3 (P3)|LAST|Implement P3 security controls after implementation of P1 and P2 controls.|\n|Unspecified Priority Code (P0)|NONE|Security control not selected in any baseline.|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Table D-2 provides a summary of the security controls and control enhancements from Appendix F that have been allocated to the initial security control baselines (i.e., low, moderate, and high).

controls and control enhancements in Appendix F. Each table focuses on a different security control family. Whereas Table D-2 includes only those security controls and control enhancements allocated to the three security control baselines, Tables D-3 through D-19 include all controls and enhancements for the respective security control families. The tables include the following information: (i) the security controls and control enhancements that have been selected for the security control baselines as indicated by an “x” in the column for the selected baseline;[93] (ii) the security controls and control enhancements that have not been selected for any security control baseline (i.e., the controls and control enhancements available for selection to achieve greater protection) as indicated by blank cells in the baseline columns; (iii) the security controls and control enhancements that have been withdrawn from Appendix F as indicated by an “x” in the respective withdrawn column; and (iv) the security controls and control enhancements that have assurance-related characteristics or properties (i.e., assurance-related controls) as indicated by an “x” in the respective assurance column. Assurance-related controls are discussed in greater detail in Appendix E to include the allocation of such controls to security control baselines (see Tables E-1 through E-3).\n\n93 The security control baselines in Tables D-3 through D-19 are only applicable to non-national security systems.\nSecurity control baselines for national security systems are included in CNSS Instruction 1253.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**TABLE D-3: SUMMARY — ACCESS CONTROLS**\n\n|CNTL NO.|CONTROL

AND ASSIGNMENT OF PRIORITY SEQUENCING CODES\n\nWith each revision to SP 800-53, minor adjustments may occur with the security control baselines\nincluding, for example, allocating additional controls and/or control enhancements, eliminating\nselected controls/enhancements, and changing sequencing priority codes (P-codes). These changes\nreflect: (i) the ongoing receipt and analysis of threat information; (ii) the periodic reexamination of\nthe initial assumptions that generated the security control baselines; (iii) the desire for common\nsecurity control baseline starting points for national security and non-national security systems to\nachieve community-wide convergence (relying subsequently on specific overlays to describe any\nadjustments from the common starting points); and (iv) the periodic reassessment of priority codes\nto appropriately balance the workload of security control implementation. Over time, as the security\ncontrol catalog expands to address the continuing challenges from a dynamic and growing threat\nspace that is increasingly sophisticated, organizations will come to rely to a much greater degree on\noverlays to provide the needed specialization for their security plans.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### APPENDIX E\n\n ASSURANCE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS\n\nMEASURES OF CONFIDENCE FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\n###### ecurity assurance is a critical aspect in determining the trustworthiness of information systems. Assurance is the measure of confidence that the security functions, features, practices, policies, procedures, mechanisms, and architecture of organizational information\n\n### S\n\n###### systems accurately mediate and enforce established security policies.[94] The objective of this appendix is:\n\n • To encourage organizations to include assurance requirements in procurements of information systems, system components, and services;\n\n • To encourage hardware, software, and firmware developers to employ development practices that result in more trustworthy information technology products and systems;\n\n • To encourage organizations to identify, select, and use information technology products that have been built with appropriate levels of assurance and to employ sound systems and security engineering techniques and methods during the system development life cycle process;\n\n • To reduce information security risk by deploying more trustworthy information technology products within critical information systems or system components; and\n\n • To encourage developers and organizations to obtain on an ongoing basis, assurance evidence for maintaining trustworthiness of information systems.\n\n Minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems are defined in FIPS Publication 200. These requirements can be satisfied by selecting, tailoring, implementing, and obtaining assurance evidence for the security controls in the low, moderate, or high baselines in Appendix D.[95] The baselines also include the assurance-related controls for the minimum assurance requirements that are generally applicable to federal information and information systems.[96] However, considering the current threat space and the increasing risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, posed by the advanced persistent threat (APT), organizations may choose to implement additional assurance-related controls from Appendix F. These additional controls can be selected based on the tailoring guidance provided in Section 3.2. Organizations can also consider developing high-assurance overlays for critical missions/business functions, specialized environments of operation, and/or information technologies (see Section 3.3 and Appendix I). When assurance-related controls cannot be satisfied, organizations can propose compensating controls (e.g., procedural/operational\n\n94 Section 2.6 provides an introduction to the concepts of assurance and trustworthiness and how the two concepts are\nrelated. A trustworthiness model is illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n95 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security control baselines for national security systems. Therefore, the assurancerelated controls in the baselines established for the national security community, if so designated, may differ from those\ncontrols designated in Tables E-1 through E-3.\n\n96 It is difficult to determine if a given security control baseline from Appendix D provides the assurance needed across\nall information technologies, users, platforms, and organizations. For example, while the use of formal methods might\nbe appropriate in a cross-domain product, different assurance techniques might be appropriate for a complex air traffic\ncontrol system or for a web server providing emergency preparedness information from the Department of Homeland\nSecurity. Still, the existing baselines do have assurance aspects that reflect the minimum assurance that is anticipated to\nbe common across all technologies, users, platforms, and organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### solutions to compensate for insufficient technology-based solutions) or assume a greater degree of risk with regard to the actual security capability achieved.\n\n\n**_The New Look for Assurance_**\n\nWhile previous versions of Special Publication 800-53 addressed minimum assurance requirements,\nthe focus was on higher-level, more abstract requirements applied to the low, moderate, and high\nbaselines. This revision takes a fundamentally different approach to assurance by defining specific\nassurance-related security controls in Appendix F that can be implemented by organizations based\non the security categorizations of their information systems—making the assurance requirements\nmore actionable and providing opportunities for increasing the levels of assurance based on mission\nand business needs, current/projected threats, unique operating environments, or the use of new\ntechnologies. The identification of specific assurance-related controls in the low, moderate, and high\nbaselines in easy-to read tables (Tables E-1, E-2, E-3) helps organizations to quickly define controls\nnecessary to satisfy minimum assurance requirements. The optional assurance-related controls in\nTable E-4 provide organizations with specification language to use in acquisitions targeted at the\ndevelopers of information systems, system components, and information system services. The\ncontrols address specific methodologies, techniques, design, and architectural considerations as\nwell as sound system and security engineering principles to fundamentally improve the quality of\nhardware, software, and firmware components that will be integrated into organizational information\nsystems or the critical infrastructure. The designation of assurance-related controls is not intended to\nimply a greater level of importance for such controls. Achieving adequate security for organizational\ninformation systems requires the correct combination of both functionality- and assurance-related\nsecurity controls. Only by understanding the importance of the concept of assurance and recognizing\nwhich security controls are more assurance-oriented versus functionality-oriented can organizations\nselect the most appropriate combination of controls to protect their organizational operations and\nassets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.\n\n\n###### The following sections provide a description of the assurance-related controls that are included in each of the security control baselines in Appendix D. The criteria for whether a security control is assurance-related or functionality-related is based on the overall characteristics of the control. In general, assurance-related controls are controls that: (i) define processes, procedures, techniques, or methodologies for designing and developing information systems and system components (i.e., hardware, software, firmware); (ii) provide supporting operational processes including improving the quality of systems/components/processes; (iii) produce security evidence from developmental or operational activities; (iv) determine security control effectiveness or risk (e.g., audit, testing, evaluation, analysis, assessment, verification, validation, monitoring); or (v) improve personnel skills, expertise, and understanding (e.g., security awareness/training, incident response training, contingency training).\n Security controls may be designated as assurance-related controls even when the controls exhibit some functional characteristics or properties (e.g., SI-4, Information System Monitoring). The distinction between functionality and assurance is less important when describing the assurance- related controls in the baselines—primarily because the security controls in the three baselines after the tailoring process is applied, become part of the security plans for information systems and for organizations.[97] However, the distinction becomes more important when organizations exercise the option of selecting additional security controls to increase the level of assurance (or the degree of confidence) in the security functionality and security capability.\n\n97 Organizations are cautioned to carefully examine the assurance-related controls in the baselines during the tailoring\nprocess, including the development of overlays, to help ensure that controls are not being inadvertently eliminated that\nprovide the measures of confidence in the security functionality needed for mission/business protection.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Minimum Assurance Requirements – Low-Impact Systems**\n\nAssurance Requirement: The organization, based on its security requirements, security policies, and needed\nsecurity capabilities, has an expectation of: (i) a limited strength of security functionality; and (ii) a limited\ndegree of confidence supported by the depth and coverage of associated security evidence, that the security\nfunctionality is complete, consistent, and correct.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Security functionality and assurance for low-impact systems are achieved by the\nimplementation of security controls from the tailored low baseline in Appendix D. Assurance requirements\nfor low-impact systems (including the information technology components that are part of those systems),\nalign with that which is readily achievable with unmodified, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products and\nservices. Due to the limited strength of functionality expected for low-impact systems, the depth/coverage\nof security evidence[98] produced is minimal and is not expected to be more than what is routinely provided\nby COTS manufacturers, vendors, and resellers. The depth/coverage evidence is further supplemented by\nthe results of security control assessments and the ongoing monitoring of organizational information\nsystems and environments in which the systems operate. For other than technology-based functionality, the\nemphasis is on a limited degree of confidence in the completeness, correctness, and consistency of\nprocedural and/or operational security functionality (e.g., policies, procedures, physical security, and\npersonnel security). Assurance requirements specified in the form of developmental and operational\nassurance controls for low-impact systems are listed in Table E-1. Organizations, through the tailoring\nprocess (including an organizational assessment of risk), may choose to add other assurance-related\ncontrols and/or control enhancements to the set included in Table E-1.\n\n**TABLE E-1: ASSURANCE-RELATED CONTROLS FOR LOW-IMPACT SYSTEMS[99]**\n\n**ID** **CONTROLS** **ID** **CONTROLS**\n\n**AC** AC-1 **MP** MP-1\n**AT** AT-1, AT-2, AT-3, AT-4 **PE** PE-1, PE-6, PE-8\n**AU** AU-1, AU-6 **PL** PL-1, PL-2, PL-4\n**CA** CA-1, CA-2, CA-3, CA-5, CA-6, CA-7, CA-9 **PS** PS-1, PS-6, PS-7\n**CM** CM-1, CM-2, CM-4, CM-8 **RA** RA-1, RA-3, RA-5\n**CP** CP-1, CP-3, CP-4 **SA** SA-1, SA-2, SA-3, SA-4, SA-4(10), SA-5, SA-9\n**IA** IA-1 **SC** SC-1, SC-39\n**IR** IR-1, IR-2, IR-5 **SI** SI-1, SI-4, SI-5\n**MA** MA-1\n\n98 NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides additional information on depth and coverage in security control\nassessments.\n\n99 The assurance-related controls in Table E-1 are a subset of the security controls contained in the security control\nbaseline for low-impact systems in Appendix D.

This is accomplished by adding assurance-related controls to the controls in the baselines to increase both the strength of security functionality and degree of confidence that the functionality is correct, complete, and consistent—making the functionality highly resistant to penetration, tamper, or bypass. Security functionality that is highly resistant to penetration, tamper, and bypass requires a significant work factor on the part of adversaries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information system or system components where that functionality is employed.\n\n Since high-assurance information technology products may be more costly and difficult to obtain, organizations may choose to partition their information systems into distinct subsystems to isolate the critical components and focus the high-assurance efforts on a more narrowly defined subset of information resources. Organizations that find it difficult to achieve high-assurance information technology solutions may have to rely to a greater extent on procedural or operational protections to ensure mission and business success. This includes, for example, reengineering critical mission and business processes to be less susceptible to high-end threats. Table E-4 provides additional developmental and operational activities (e.g., in the SA, SI, and CM security control families), that organizations can select to achieve an enhanced level of assurance (up to and including high assurance). The list of assurance-related controls is not intended to be exhaustive. Organizations, during the tailoring process, may choose to designate other security controls as assurance-related and add to the exemplar set in Table E-4.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**TABLE E-4: SECURITY CONTROLS FOR ENHANCED ASSURANCE[104]**\n\n**ID** **CONTROLS** **ID** **CONTROLS**\n\n**AC** **AC-25** **MP** No additional controls.\n**AT** **AT-2(1), AT-3 (all enhancements)** **PE** **PE-6(2), PE-6(3)**\n**AU** **AU-6(4), AU-6(7), AU-6(8), AU-6(9), AU-6(10), AU-10 (all** **PL** **PL-8 (all enhancements), PL-9**\nenhancements), AU-11(1), AU-13 (plus enhancements), AU**14 (plus enhancements)**\n\n**CA** **CA-2(3), CA-5(1), CA-7(3), CA-8 (all enhancements), CA-9(1)** **PS** **PS-6(2), PS-6(3)**\n**CM** **CM-2(6), CM-4(2), CM-8(6), CM-8(7), CM-8(8), CM-8(9)** **RA** **RA-5(3), RA-5(6), RA-5(8), RA-5(10), RA-6**\n**CP** **CP-3(2), CP-4(3), CP-4(4), CP-12** **SA** **SA-4(3), SA-4(5), SA-4(6), SA-4(7), SA-4(8), SA-9(1), SA-**\n**9(3), SA-9(4), SA-9(5), SA-10 (all enhancements), SA-11 (all**\nenhancements), SA-12 (all enhancements), SA-13, SA-14,\n**SA-15 (all enhancements), SA-17 (all enhancements), SA-18**\n(plus enhancements), SA-19 (plus enhancements), SA-20,\n**SA-21 (plus enhancement), SA-22 (plus enhancement)**\n**IA** No additional controls. **SC** **SC-2(1), SC-3 (all enhancements), SC-6, SC-7(22), SC-11**\n(plus enhancement), SC-29 (plus enhancement), SC-30 (plus\nenhancements), SC-31 (plus enhancements), SC-32, SC-34\n(plus enhancements), SC-36 (plus enhancement), SC-37 (plus\nenhancement), SC-38, SC-39 (all enhancements)\n**IR** **IR-3(1)** **SI** **SI-4(1), SI-4(3), SI-4(7), SI-4(9), SI-4(10), SI-4(11), SI-4(12),**\n\n**MA** No additional controls. **SI-4(13), SI-4(14), SI-4(15), SI-4(16), SI-4(17), SI-4(18), SI-**\n\n**4(19), SI-4(20), SI-4(21), SI-4(22), SI-4(23), SI-4(24), SI-7(3),**\n**SI-7(6), SI-7(8), SI-7(9), SI-7(10), SI-7(11), SI-7(12), SI-7(13),**\n**SI-7(15), SI-7(16), SI-10 (all enhancements), SI-13 (plus**\nenhancements), SI-14 (plus enhancement), SI-15, SI-17\n\n104 The assurance-related controls in Table E-4 represent the additional security controls needed to achieve enhanced\nlevels of assurance (i.e., the controls needed to go beyond the minimum assurance levels that are represented by the\nassurance-related controls in Tables E-1, E-2, and E-3).

The security controls in the catalog with few exceptions, have been designed to be policy- and technology-neutral. This means that security controls and control enhancements focus on the fundamental safeguards and countermeasures necessary to protect information during processing, while in storage, and during transmission. Therefore, it is beyond the scope of this publication to provide guidance on the application of security controls to specific technologies, communities of interest, environments of operation, or missions/business functions. These areas are addressed by the use of the tailoring process described in Chapter Three and the development of overlays described in Appendix I.\n\n In the few cases where specific technologies are called out in security controls (e.g., mobile, PKI, wireless, VOIP), organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security goes well beyond the requirements in a single control associated with a particular technology. Many of the needed safeguards/countermeasures are obtained from the other security controls in the catalog allocated to the initial control baselines as the starting point for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. In addition to the organization-driven development of specialized security plans and overlays, NIST Special Publications and Interagency Reports may provide guidance on recommended security controls for specific technologies and sector-specific applications (e.g., Smart Grid, healthcare, Industrial Control Systems, and mobile).\n\n Employing a policy- and technology-neutral security control catalog has the following benefits:\n\n • It encourages organizations to focus on the security capabilities required for mission/business success and the protection of information, irrespective of the information technologies that are employed in organizational information systems;\n\n • It encourages organizations to analyze each security control for its applicability to specific technologies, environments of operation, missions/business functions, and communities of interest; and\n\n[105 An online version of the catalog of security controls is also available at http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home.](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home)\n\n106 Compliance necessitates organizations executing due diligence with regard to information security and risk\nmanagement. Information security due diligence includes using all appropriate information as part of an organizationwide risk management program to effectively use the tailoring guidance and inherent flexibility in NIST publications so\nthat the selected security controls documented in organizational security plans meet the specific mission and business\nrequirements of organizations. Using the risk management tools and techniques that are available to organizations is\nessential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the safeguards and countermeasures with the necessary and\nsufficient strength of mechanism to address the current threats to organizational operations and assets, individuals,\nother organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based processes, procedures, and technologies will help\nensure that all federal information systems and organizations have the necessary resilience to support ongoing federal\nresponsibilities, critical infrastructure applications, and continuity of government.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### • It encourages organizations to specify security policies as part of the tailoring process for security controls that have variable parameters.\n\n For example, organizations using smart phones, tablets, or other types of mobile devices would start the tailoring process by assuming that all security controls and control enhancements in the appropriate baseline (low, moderate, or high) are needed. The tailoring process may result in certain security controls being eliminated for a variety of reasons, including, for example, the inability of the technology to support the implementation of the control. However, the elimination of such controls without understanding the potential adverse impacts to organizational missions and business functions can significantly increase information security risk and should be carefully analyzed. This type of analysis is essential in order for organizations to make effective risk-based decisions including the selection of appropriate compensating security controls, when considering the use of these emerging mobile devices and technologies. The specialization of security plans using the tailoring guidance and overlays, together with a comprehensive set of technology- and policy-neutral security controls, promotes cost-effective, risk-based information security for organizations—in any sector, for any technology, and in any operating environment.\n\n The security controls in the catalog are expected to change over time, as controls are withdrawn, revised, and added. In order to maintain stability in security plans and automated tools supporting the implementation of Special Publication 800-53, security controls will not be renumbered each time a control is withdrawn. Rather, notations of security controls that have been withdrawn are maintained in the catalog for historical purposes. Security controls are withdrawn for a variety of reasons including, for example: the security capability provided by the withdrawn control has been incorporated into another control; the security capability provided by the withdrawn control is redundant to an existing control; or the security control is deemed to be no longer necessary.\n\n There may, on occasion, be repetition in requirements that appear in the security controls and control enhancements that are part of the security control catalog. This repetition in requirements is intended to reinforce the security requirements from the perspective of multiple controls and/or enhancements. For example, the requirement for strong identification and authentication when conducting remote maintenance activities appears in the MA family in the specific context of systems maintenance activities conducted by organizations. The identification and authentication requirement also appears in a more general context in the IA family. While these requirements appear to be redundant (i.e., overlapping), they are, in fact, mutually reinforcing and not intended to require additional effort on the part of organizations in the development and implementation of security programs.\n\n\n**_Implementation Tip_**\n\nNew security controls and control enhancements will be developed on a regular basis using state-ofthe-practice information from national-level threat and vulnerability databases as well as information\non the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by adversaries in launching cyber attacks. The\nproposed modifications to security controls and security control baselines will be carefully weighed\nduring each revision cycle, considering the desire for stability of the security control catalog and the\nneed to respond to changing threats, vulnerabilities, attack methods, and information technologies.\nThe overall objective is to raise the basic level of information security over time. Organizations may\nchoose to develop new security controls when there is a specific security capability required and the\nappropriate controls are not available in Appendices F or G.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**_SECURITY CONTROL CLASS DESIGNATIONS_**\n\nMANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL, AND TECHNICAL REFERENCES\n\nBecause many security controls within the security control families in Appendix F have various\ncombinations of management, operational, and technical properties, the specific class designations\nhave been removed from the security control families. Organizations may still find it useful to\napply such designations to individual security controls and control enhancements or to individual\nsections within a particular control/enhancement. Organizations may find it beneficial to employ\nclass designations as a way to group or refer to security controls. The class designations may also\nhelp organizations with the process of allocating security controls and control enhancements to: (i)\nresponsible parties or information systems (e.g., as common or hybrid controls); (ii) specific roles;\nand/or (iii) specific components of a system. For example, organizations may determine that the\nresponsibility for system-specific controls they have placed in the management class belong to the\ninformation system owner, controls placed in the operational class belong to the Information\nSystem Security Officer (ISSO), and controls placed in the technical class belong to one or more\nsystem administrators. This example is provided to illustrate the potential usefulness of designating\nclasses for controls and/or control enhancements; it is not meant to suggest or require additional\ntasks for organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**CAUTIONARY NOTE**\n\n_DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES_\n\nWith the renewed emphasis on trustworthy information systems and supply chain security, it is\nessential that organizations have the capability to express their information security requirements\nwith clarity and specificity in order to engage the information technology industry and obtain the\nsystems, components, and services necessary for mission and business success. To ensure that\norganizations have such capability, Special Publication 800-53 provides a set of security controls in\nthe System and Services Acquisition family (i.e., SA family) addressing requirements for the\ndevelopment of information systems, information technology products, and information system\nservices. Therefore, many of the controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those\nsystems, components, and services. It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of\nthe security controls in the SA family includes all system/component/service development and the\ndevelopers associated with such development whether the development is conducted by internal\norganizational personnel or by external developers through the contracting/acquisition process.\nAffected controls include SA-8, SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Fundamentals of the Catalog\n\n Security controls and control enhancements in Appendices F and G are generally designed to be policy-neutral and technology/implementation-independent. Organizations provide information about security controls and control enhancements in two ways:\n\n • By specifying security control implementation details (e.g., platform dependencies) in the associated security plan for the information system or security program plan for the organization; and\n\n • By establishing specific values in the variable sections of selected security controls through the use of assignment and selection statements.\n\n Assignment and selection statements provide organizations with the capability to specialize security controls and control enhancements based on organizational security requirements or requirements originating in federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, or guidelines. Organization-defined parameters used in assignment and selection statements in the basic security controls apply also to all control enhancements associated with those controls. Control enhancements strengthen the fundamental security capability in the base control but are not a substitute for using assignment or selection statements to provide greater specificity to the control. Assignment statements for security controls and control enhancements do not contain minimum or maximum values (e.g., testing contingency plans at least annually). Organizations should consult specific federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines as the definitive sources for such information. The absence of minimum and maximum values from the security controls and control enhancements does not obviate the need for organizations to comply with requirements in the controlling source publications.\n\n The first security control in each family (i.e., the dash-1 control) generates requirements for specific policies and procedures that are needed for the effective implementation of the other security controls in the family. Therefore, individual controls and control enhancements in a particular family do not call for the development of such policies and procedures. Supplemental guidance sections of security controls and control enhancements do not contain any requirements or references to FIPS or NIST Special Publications. NIST publications are, however, included in a references section for each security control. \n\n In support of the Joint Task Force initiative to develop a unified information security framework for the federal government, security controls and control enhancements for national security systems are included in this appendix. The inclusion of such controls and enhancements is not intended to impose security requirements on organizations that operate national security systems. Rather, organizations can use the security controls and control enhancements on a voluntary basis with the approval of federal officials exercising policy authority over national security systems. In addition, the security control priorities and security control baselines listed in Appendix D and in the priority and baseline allocation summary boxes below each security control in Appendix F, apply to non-national security systems only unless otherwise directed by the federal officials with national security policy authority.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Using the Catalog\n\n Organizations employ security controls[107] in federal information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, FIPS Publication 200, and NIST Special Publications 800-37 and 800-39. Security categorization of federal information and information systems, as required by FIPS Publication 199, is the first step in the RMF.[108] Next, organizations select the appropriate security control baselines for their information systems by satisfying the minimum security requirements set forth in FIPS Publication 200. Appendix D includes three security control baselines that are associated with the designated impact levels of information systems as determined during the security categorization process.[109] After baseline selection, organizations tailor the baselines by: (i) identifying/designating common controls; (ii) applying scoping considerations; (iii) selecting compensating controls, if needed; (iv) assigning control parameter values in selection and assignment statements; (v) supplementing the baseline controls with additional controls and control enhancements from the security control catalog; and (vi) providing additional information for control implementation. Organizations can also use the baseline tailoring process with the overlay concept that is described in Section 3.2 and Appendix I. Risk assessments, as described in NIST Special Publication 800-30, guide and inform the security control selection process.[110]\n\n\n**CAUTIONARY NOTE**\n\n_USE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY_\n\nIf cryptography is required for the protection of information based on the selection of security\ncontrols in Appendix F and subsequently implemented by organizational information systems, the\ncryptographic mechanisms comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,\npolicies, regulations, standards, and guidance. This includes, for NSA-approved cryptography to\nprotect classified information, FIPS-validated cryptography to protect unclassified information, and\nNSA-approved and FIPS-compliant key management technologies and processes. Security controls\nSC-12 and SC-13 provide specific information on the selection of appropriate cryptographic\nmechanisms, including the strength of such mechanisms.\n\n\n107 The security controls in Special Publication 800-53 are available online and can be downloaded in various formats\n[from the NIST web site at: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home.](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home)\n\n108 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance for security categorization of national security systems.\n\n109 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance on security control baselines for national security systems and specific\ntailoring requirements associated with such systems.\n\n110 There are additional security controls and control enhancements that appear in the catalog that are not used in any of\nthe initial baselines. These additional controls and control enhancements are available to organizations and can be used\nin the tailoring process to achieve the needed level of protection in accordance with organizational risk assessments.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**FAMILY: ACCESS CONTROL**\n\n**AC-1** **ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or\n_roles]:_\n\n1. An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,\nmanagement commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;\nand\n\n2.

Security program policies and procedures at the organization\nlevel may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can\nbe included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can\nbe represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The\nprocedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information\nsystems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing\npolicy and procedures.

Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment:\n_organization-defined frequency]; and_\n\nk. Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when\nindividuals are removed from the group.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared,\ngroup, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and\nservice. Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by\norganizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information\nsystem and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security\ncontrols in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system\naccounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner,\nmission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such\naccounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other\nattributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for\nauthorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-oforigin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements\n(e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time\nzone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to\nconsider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency\naccounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a\npart of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without\nthe demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in\nresponse to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency\naccount activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary\naccounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used\nfor special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such\naccounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions\nfor disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or\ntemporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated.\nSome types of information system accounts may require specialized training.

While user identities may remain\nrelatively constant over time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing\nmission/business requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege\nmanagement can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges from users, as\nopposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in\nprivileges. Dynamic privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the\nprivileges of users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This\ntype of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if\nusers are operating out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress\nor in emergency maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the ancillary\neffects of privilege changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for\ncommunications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements for information\nsystem resiliency.

The above class of\nmandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects can take with information\nobtained from data objects for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing\nthe subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of\nmandatory access control policies also constrains what actions subjects can take with respect\nto the propagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass\nthat privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects\nto which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be\ncircumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an implementation that meets the\nreference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is bounded by the information system\nboundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional\nmeans may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect). The\ntrusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least\nprivilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges relative to the\nabove policy necessary for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is\nmost applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or\nregulation) that establishes a policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and\nsome users of the information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified\ninformation resident in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction with\nAC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by this control is\nstill able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by\nthis control take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example,\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nwhile a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from\npassing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label, AC-3 (4)\npermits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same sensitivity label as the\nsubject. Related controls: AC-25, SC-11.\n\n**(4)** _ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL_\n\n**The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined discretionary access control**\n**_policy] over defined subjects and objects where_** **the policy specifies that a subject that has been**\n**granted access to information can do one or more of the following:**\n\n**(a) Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;**\n\n**(b) Grant its privileges to other subjects;**\n\n**(c) Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or the information**\n**system’s components;**\n\n**(d) Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects; or**\n\n**(e) Change the rules governing access control.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects\nare not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they\nhave already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information\nare not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information\nto other subjects or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with AC-3\n(3). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by AC-3 (3) is still able\nto operate under the less rigorous constraints of this control enhancement. Thus, while AC-3\n(3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject\noperating at a different sensitivity level, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information\nto any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system\nboundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system,\nadditional means may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While the\nolder, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access\ncontrol, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.\n\n**(5)** _ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY-RELEVANT INFORMATION_\n\n**The information system prevents access to [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant**\n**_information] except during secure, non-operable system states._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Security-relevant information is any information within information\nsystems that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of\nsecurity services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce system security policies or\nmaintain the isolation of code and data. Security-relevant information includes, for example,\nfiltering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration\nparameters for security services, and access control lists. Secure, non-operable system states\ninclude the times in which information systems are not performing mission/business-related\nprocessing (e.g., the system is off-line for maintenance, troubleshooting, boot-up, shut down).\nRelated control: CM-3.\n\n**(6)** _ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | PROTECTION OF USER AND SYSTEM INFORMATION_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-4 and SC-28].\n\n**(7)** _ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL_\n\n**The information system enforces a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and**\n**objects and controls access based upon [Assignment: organization-defined roles and users**\n**_authorized to assume such roles]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that\nrestricts information system access to authorized users. Organizations can create specific roles\nbased on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations\non organizational information systems associated with the organization-defined roles. When\nusers are assigned to the organizational roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges\ndefined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because\nprivileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a significant number of\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nindividuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but are instead acquired through role\nassignments. RBAC can be implemented either as a mandatory or discretionary form of\naccess control. For organizations implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the\nrequirements in AC-3 (3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.\n\n**(8)** _ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS_\n\n**The information system enforces the revocation of access authorizations resulting from changes**\n**to the security attributes of subjects and objects based on [Assignment: organization-defined rules**\n**_governing the timing of revocations of access authorizations]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Revocation of access rules may differ based on the types of access\nrevoked. For example, if a subject (i.e., user or process) is removed from a group, access may\nnot be revoked until the next time the object (e.g., file) is opened or until the next time the\nsubject attempts a new access to the object. Revocation based on changes to security labels\nmay take effect immediately. Organizations can provide alternative approaches on how to\nmake revocations immediate if information systems cannot provide such capability and\nimmediate revocation is necessary.\n\n**(9)** _ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | CONTROLLED RELEASE_\n**The information system does not release information outside of the established system boundary**\n**unless:**\n\n**(a) The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined information system or system component]**\n**provides [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]; and**\n\n**(b) [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are used to validate the**\n**appropriateness of the information designated for release.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information systems can only protect organizational information\nwithin the confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards may be\nneeded to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the\nestablished information system boundaries. Examples of information leaving the system\nboundary include transmitting information to an external information system or printing the\ninformation on one of its printers. In cases where the information system is unable to make a\ndetermination of the adequacy of the protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as\na mitigating control, organizations determine procedurally whether the external information\nsystems are providing adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of the\nsecurity provided by external information systems include, for example, conducting\ninspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization and its\ncounterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to\nprotect the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but\nthe means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to\nprotect the information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ\ntechnical or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external\nsystems. For example, if the information system passes information to another system\ncontrolled by another organization, technical means are employed to validate that the security\nattributes associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving system.\nAlternatively, if the information system passes information to a printer in organizationcontrolled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately\nauthorized individuals gain access to the printer. This control enhancement is most applicable\nwhen there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that\nestablishes policy regarding access to the information, and that policy applies beyond the\nrealm of a particular information system or organization.\n\n**(10)** _ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | AUDITED OVERRIDE OF ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS_\n\n**The organization employs an audited override of automated access control mechanisms under**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined conditions].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Related controls: AU-2, AU-6.\n\nReferences: None.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP1 **LOW  AC-3** **MOD  AC-3** **HIGH  AC-3**\n\n**AC-4** **INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT**\n\nControl: The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of\ninformation within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment:\n_organization-defined information flow control policies]._\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel\nwithin an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to\naccess the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information.\nFlow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being\ntransmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the\norganization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy\nserver, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and\ncontent. Transferring information between information systems representing different security\ndomains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more\ndomain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at\ndesignated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider\nmandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies.\nEnforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected\nsystems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way\ninformation flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security\nattributes and security labels.\n\nOrganizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms\nto control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks,\nindividuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow\ncontrol is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement\noccurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted\ntunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information\nsystem services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or messagefiltering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using\ndocument characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection\nmechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information\nflow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution\nneeds which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow\nenforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance\nguards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information\ntechnology products. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, AC-21, CM-6, CM-7, SA-8, SC-2,\nSC-5, SC-7, SC-18.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | OBJECT SECURITY ATTRIBUTES_\n**The information system uses [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] associated**\n**with [Assignment: organization-defined information, source, and destination objects] to enforce**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control**\n**decisions.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes\nassociated with information (data content and data structure) and source/destination objects,\nand respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the mechanisms\nencounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies. For example,\nan information object labeled Secret would be allowed to flow to a destination object labeled\n_Secret, but an information object labeled Top Secret would not be allowed to flow to a_\n\n|P1|LOW AC-3|MOD AC-3|HIGH AC-3|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\ndestination object labeled Secret. Security attributes can also include, for example, source and\ndestination addresses employed in traffic filter firewalls. Flow enforcement using explicit\nsecurity attributes can be used, for example, to control the release of certain types of\ninformation. Related control: AC-16.\n\n**(2)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PROCESSING DOMAINS_\n\n**The information system uses protected processing domains to enforce [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Within information systems, protected processing domains are\nprocessing spaces that have controlled interactions with other processing spaces, thus\nenabling control of information flows between these spaces and to/from data/information\nobjects. A protected processing domain can be provided, for example, by implementing\ndomain and type enforcement. In domain and type enforcement, information system processes\nare assigned to domains; information is identified by types; and information flows are\ncontrolled based on allowed information accesses (determined by domain and type), allowed\nsignaling among domains, and allowed process transitions to other domains.\n\n**(3)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DYNAMIC INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL_\n\n**The information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on [Assignment:**\n**_organization-defined policies]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizational policies regarding dynamic information flow control\ninclude, for example, allowing or disallowing information flows based on changing conditions\nor mission/operational considerations. Changing conditions include, for example, changes in\norganizational risk tolerance due to changes in the immediacy of mission/business needs,\nchanges in the threat environment, and detection of potentially harmful or adverse events.\nRelated control: SI-4.\n\n**(4)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | CONTENT CHECK ENCRYPTED INFORMATION_\n**The information system prevents encrypted information from bypassing content-checking**\n**mechanisms by [Selection (one or more): decrypting the information; blocking the flow of the**\n**_encrypted information; terminating communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted_**\n**_information; [Assignment: organization-defined procedure or method]]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Related control: SI-4.\n\n**(5)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | EMBEDDED DATA TYPES_\n\n**The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined limitations]** **on embedding**\n**data types within other data types.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Embedding data types within other data types may result in reduced\nflow control effectiveness. Data type embedding includes, for example, inserting executable\nfiles as objects within word processing files, inserting references or descriptive information\ninto a media file, and compressed or archived data types that may include multiple embedded\ndata types. Limitations on data type embedding consider the levels of embedding and prohibit\nlevels of data type embedding that are beyond the capability of the inspection tools.\n\n**(6)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | METADATA_\n\n**The information system enforces information flow control based on [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined metadata]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Metadata is information used to describe the characteristics of data.\nMetadata can include structural metadata describing data structures (e.g., data format, syntax,\nand semantics) or descriptive metadata describing data contents (e.g., age, location, telephone\nnumber). Enforcing allowed information flows based on metadata enables simpler and more\neffective flow control. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata with regard to\ndata accuracy (i.e., knowledge that the metadata values are correct with respect to the data),\ndata integrity (i.e., protecting against unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding\nof metadata to the data payload (i.e., ensuring sufficiently strong binding techniques with\nappropriate levels of assurance). Related controls: AC-16, SI-7.\n\n**(7)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ONE-WAY FLOW MECHANISMS_\n\n**The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined one-way information flows]**\n**using hardware mechanisms.**\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**(8)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTERS_\n\n**The information system enforces information flow control using [Assignment: organization-defined**\n**_security policy filters] as a basis for flow control decisions for [Assignment: organization-defined_**\n**_information flows]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organization-defined security policy filters can address data structures\nand content. For example, security policy filters for data structures can check for maximum\nfile lengths, maximum field sizes, and data/file types (for structured and unstructured data).\nSecurity policy filters for data content can check for specific words (e.g., dirty/clean word\nfilters), enumerated values or data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits\nthe interpretation of data content by applications. Unstructured data typically refers to digital\ninformation without a particular data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate\nthe development of rule sets to address the particular sensitivity of the information conveyed\nby the data or the associated flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured data consists of: (i)\nbitmap objects that are inherently non language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and\n(ii) textual objects that are based on written or printed languages (e.g., commercial off-theshelf word processing documents, spreadsheets, or emails). Organizations can implement\nmore than one security policy filter to meet information flow control objectives (e.g.,\nemploying clean word lists in conjunction with dirty word lists may help to reduce false\npositives).\n\n**(9)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | HUMAN REVIEWS_\n\n**The information system enforces the use of human reviews for [Assignment: organization-defined**\n**_information flows] under the following conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined conditions]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations define security policy filters for all situations where\nautomated flow control decisions are possible. When a fully automated flow control decision\nis not possible, then a human review may be employed in lieu of, or as a complement to,\nautomated security policy filtering. Human reviews may also be employed as deemed\nnecessary by organizations.\n\n**(10)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ENABLE / DISABLE SECURITY POLICY FILTERS_\n\n**The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to enable/disable**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] under the following conditions:**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined conditions].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: For example, as allowed by the information system authorization,\nadministrators can enable security policy filters to accommodate approved data types.\n\n**(11)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | CONFIGURATION OF SECURITY POLICY FILTERS_\n\n**The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to configure**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] to support different security policies.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: For example, to reflect changes in security policies, administrators can\nchange the list of “dirty words” that security policy mechanisms check in accordance with the\ndefinitions provided by organizations.\n\n**(12)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DATA TYPE IDENTIFIERS_\n\n**The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, uses**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined data type identifiers] to validate data essential for information**\n**flow decisions.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Data type identifiers include, for example, filenames, file types, file\nsignatures/tokens, and multiple internal file signatures/tokens. Information systems may allow\ntransfer of data only if compliant with data type format specifications.\n\n**(13)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DECOMPOSITION INTO POLICY-RELEVANT SUBCOMPONENTS_\n\n**The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,**\n**decomposes information into [Assignment: organization-defined policy-relevant subcomponents]**\n**for submission to policy enforcement mechanisms.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Policy enforcement mechanisms apply filtering, inspection, and/or\nsanitization rules to the policy-relevant subcomponents of information to facilitate flow\nenforcement prior to transferring such information to different security domains. Parsing\ntransfer files facilitates policy decisions on source, destination, certificates, classification,\nattachments, and other security-related component differentiators.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**(14)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTER CONSTRAINTS_\n\n**The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,**\n**implements [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] requiring fully enumerated**\n**formats that restrict data structure and content.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Data structure and content restrictions reduce the range of potential\nmalicious and/or unsanctioned content in cross-domain transactions. Security policy filters\nthat restrict data structures include, for example, restricting file sizes and field lengths. Data\ncontent policy filters include, for example: (i) encoding formats for character sets (e.g.,\nUniversal Character Set Transformation Formats, American Standard Code for Information\nInterchange); (ii) restricting character data fields to only contain alpha-numeric characters;\n(iii) prohibiting special characters; and (iv) validating schema structures.\n\n**(15)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DETECTION OF UNSANCTIONED INFORMATION_\n\n**The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,**\n**examines the information for the presence of [Assignment: organized-defined unsanctioned**\n**_information] and prohibits the transfer of such information in accordance with the [Assignment:_**\n**_organization-defined security policy]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Detection of unsanctioned information includes, for example, checking\nall information to be transferred for malicious code and dirty words. Related control: SI-3.\n\n**(16)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | INFORMATION TRANSFERS ON INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-4].\n\n**(17)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DOMAIN AUTHENTICATION_\n\n**The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination points by**\n\n**[Selection (one or more): organization, system, application, individual] for information transfer.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Attribution is a critical component of a security concept of operations.\nThe ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in information\nsystems, allows the forensic reconstruction of events when required, and encourages policy\ncompliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations/individuals. Successful\ndomain authentication requires that information system labels distinguish among systems,\norganizations, and individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating\ninformation. Related controls: IA-2, IA-3, IA-4, IA-5.\n\n**(18)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY ATTRIBUTE BINDING_\n\n**The information system binds security attributes to information using [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined binding techniques] to facilitate information flow policy enforcement._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Binding techniques implemented by information systems affect the\nstrength of security attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance\nassociated with binding techniques play an important part in the trust organizations have in\nthe information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and\ndegree of additional reviews required by organizations. Related controls: AC-16, SC-16.\n\n**(19)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | VALIDATION OF METADATA_\n\n**The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, applies**\n**the same security policy filtering to metadata as it applies to data payloads.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires the validation of metadata and the\ndata to which the metadata applies. Some organizations distinguish between metadata and\ndata payloads (i.e., only the data to which the metadata is bound). Other organizations do not\nmake such distinctions, considering metadata and the data to which the metadata applies as\npart of the payload. All information (including metadata and the data to which the metadata\napplies) is subject to filtering and inspection.\n\n**(20)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | APPROVED SOLUTIONS_\n\n**The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined solutions in approved**\n**_configurations] to control the flow of [Assignment: organization-defined information] across_**\n**security domains.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations define approved solutions and configurations in crossdomain policies and guidance in accordance with the types of information flows across\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nclassification boundaries. The Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO)\nprovides a baseline listing of approved cross-domain solutions.\n\n**(21)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PHYSICAL / LOGICAL SEPARATION OF INFORMATION FLOWS_\n\n**The information system separates information flows logically or physically using [Assignment:**\n**_organization-defined mechanisms and/or techniques] to accomplish [Assignment: organization-_**\n**_defined required separations by types of information]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Enforcing the separation of information flows by type can enhance\nprotection by ensuring that information is not commingled while in transit and by enabling\nflow control by transmission paths perhaps not otherwise achievable. Types of separable\ninformation include, for example, inbound and outbound communications traffic, service\nrequests and responses, and information of differing security categories.\n\n**(22)** _INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ACCESS ONLY_\n\n**The information system provides access from a single device to computing platforms,**\n**applications, or data residing on multiple different security domains, while preventing any**\n**information flow between the different security domains.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The information system, for example, provides a desktop for users to\naccess each connected security domain without providing any mechanisms to allow transfer\nof information between the different security domains.\n\nReferences: None.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP1 **LOW  Not Selected** **MOD  AC-4** **HIGH  AC-4**\n\n**AC-5** **SEPARATION OF DUTIES**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na. Separates [Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals];\n\nb. Documents separation of duties of individuals; and\n\nc. Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized\nprivileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of\nduties includes, for example: (i) dividing mission functions and information system support\nfunctions among different individuals and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support\nfunctions with different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration\nmanagement, quality assurance and testing, and network security); and (iii) ensuring security\npersonnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions.

The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring\nthat the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required\norganizational missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional\nprocesses, roles, and information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege.\nOrganizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of\norganizational information systems.

Security-relevant information includes, for\nexample, filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information,\nconfiguration parameters for security services, and access control lists. Explicitly authorized\npersonnel include, for example, security administrators, system and network administrators,\nsystem security officers, system maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other\nprivileged users.

The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations\nimplement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of\nrole provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the\nuser and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between\na privileged and non-privileged account. Related control: PL-4.\n\n**(3)** _LEAST PRIVILEGE | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED COMMANDS_\n**The organization authorizes network access to [Assignment: organization-defined privileged**\n**_commands] only for [Assignment: organization-defined compelling operational needs] and_**\n**documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of\nlocal access (i.e., user being physically present at the device). Related control: AC-17.\n\n**(4)** _LEAST PRIVILEGE | SEPARATE PROCESSING DOMAINS_\n\n**The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation**\n**of user privileges.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of\nuser privileges includes, for example: (i) using virtualization techniques to allow additional\nprivileges within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to\nthe underlying actual machine; (ii) employing hardware and/or software domain separation\nmechanisms; and (iii) implementing separate physical domains. Related controls: AC-4, SC-3,\nSC-30, SC-32.\n\n**(5)** _LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS_\n**The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to [Assignment:**\n**_organization-defined personnel or roles]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically\ndescribed as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating\nsystems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day\nusers from having access to privileged information/functions. Organizations may differentiate\nin the application of this control enhancement between allowed privileges for local accounts\nand for domain accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control information\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nsystem configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently\nmitigate risk.

Periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if\nthe rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated,\norganizations take appropriate corrective actions.

However, if the privileges required for\nexecution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking\nsuch applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than\nassigned by organizations.\n\n**(9)** _LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS_\n\n**The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally\nby authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information\nsystem accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts\non organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse,\nand in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat\n(APT).

Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate\nauthorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious\ncode protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from\nnon-privileged users.\n\nReferences: None.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\n|P1|LOW Not Selected|MOD AC-6 (1) (2) (5) (9) (10)|HIGH AC-6 (1) (2) (3) (5) (9) (10)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**AC-7** **UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS**\n\nControl: The information system:\n\na.

Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by\ninformation systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time\nperiod established by organizations.

A logical session (for local, network, and\nremote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an\norganizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user\naccess) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes\nassociated with a user’s logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the\nuser (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events\nrequiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of\nuser inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, time-of-day restrictions on\ninformation system use.

Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch\nthat commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored\nuse. This control does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already\noccurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations where identification and authentication have\nnot yet occurred.

Establishes the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] for\n\n[Assignment: organization-defined information systems]; and\n\nd. Determines the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined values or ranges] for each of the\nestablished security attributes.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information is represented internally within information systems using\nabstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of\nentities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated\nwith individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known\nas objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, interprocess pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions\nrepresenting the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to\nsafeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects)\nthat have the potential to send or receive information, to cause information to flow among objects,\n\n|P3|LOW AC-14|MOD AC-14|HIGH AC-14|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nor to change the information system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive\nentities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes to\nsubjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value\nand the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement\nof information security policies for access control and information flow control, either through\norganizational processes or information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned\nvalues of security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational\ninformation.\n\nOrganizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information systems to support\nmissions/business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to\nany given security attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or\nNOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and\nvalues, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The\nterm security labeling refers to the association of security attributes with subjects and objects\nrepresented by internal data structures within organizational information systems, to enable\ninformation system-based enforcement of information security policies. Security labels include,\nfor example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration),\nnationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and\ncompliance requirements. The term security marking refers to the association of security attributes\nwith objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based enforcement of\ninformation security policies. The AC-16 base control represents the requirement for user-based\nattribute association (marking). The enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements\nincluding information system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes include,\nfor example, classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level for subjects.\nAn example of a value for both of these attribute types is Top Secret.

Security attributes may change, for\nexample, due to information aggregation issues (i.e., the security characteristics of individual\ninformation elements are different from the combined elements), changes in individual access\nauthorizations (i.e., privileges), and changes in the security category of information.

The association of such security attributes\ncan be accomplished with technologies/techniques providing different levels of assurance. For\nexample, information systems can cryptographically bind security attributes to information\nusing digital signatures with the supporting cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices\n(sometimes known as hardware roots of trust).\n\n**(9)** _SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE REASSIGNMENT_\n\n**The organization ensures that security attributes associated with information are reassigned only**\n**via re-grading mechanisms validated using [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or**\n**_procedures]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Validated re-grading mechanisms are employed by organizations to\nprovide the requisite levels of assurance for security attribute reassignment activities. The\nvalidation is facilitated by ensuring that re-grading mechanisms are single purpose and of\nlimited function. Since security attribute reassignments can affect security policy enforcement\nactions (e.g., access/flow enforcement decisions), using trustworthy re-grading mechanisms is\nnecessary to ensure that such mechanisms perform in a consistent/correct mode of operation.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**(10)** _SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE CONFIGURATION BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS_\n\n**The information system provides authorized individuals the capability to define or change the type**\n**and value of security attributes available for association with subjects and objects.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect\nthe ability of individuals to access organizational information.

Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and\nimplementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and\n\nb. Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or\nprocesses acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet).\nRemote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations\noften employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity\nover remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote;\nhowever, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g.,\nemploying appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may\nprovide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as\ninternal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN\ndoes not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can\naffect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for\nmalicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web\nservers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to\nallowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations\nmay use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such\nagreements are not required by this control.

Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and\ncapabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices.\nUsage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example,\nconfiguration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory\nprotective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code,\nupdating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting\nprimary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling\nunnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to\nprovide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many\nsafeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls in the\ncatalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security\nplans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the\nrequirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls.

Access the information system from external information systems; and\n\nb. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external information\nsystems.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: External information systems are information systems or components of\ninformation systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by organizations\nand for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application\nof required security controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information\nsystems include, for example: (i) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook\ncomputers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and\ncommunications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations,\nconvention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by\nnonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned\nby, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of organizations. This control also\naddresses the use of external information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of\norganizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as\na service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational information systems.\n\nFor some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal\nagencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have\nbeen established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that\nno explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations\nwould not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing\nsharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or\norganizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by\napplicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for\nexample, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to\norganizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose\nrules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on\nauthorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the\ntrust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different\nsecurity restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.\n\nThis control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces\nto organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through\nwww.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information\nsystems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions\naddress as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational information\nsystems from external information systems; and the highest security category of information that\ncan be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions\nwith the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations may impose\nrestrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.

In those situations, organizations need\nconfidence that the external information systems contain the necessary security safeguards\n(i.e., security controls), so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational\ninformation systems. Verification that the required security controls have been implemented\ncan be achieved, for example, by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other\nmeans, depending on the confidence level required by organizations.

There\nare risks to using non-organizationally owned devices. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently\nhigh as to prohibit such use. In other cases, it may be such that the use of non-organizationally\nowned devices is allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include, for example: (i)\nrequiring the implementation of organization-approved security controls prior to authorizing\nsuch connections; (ii) limiting access to certain types of information, services, or applications;\n(iii) using virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities to servers or\nother system components provisioned by the organization; and (iv) agreeing to terms and\nconditions for usage.

Data mining prevention and detection techniques include, for example: (i) limiting\nthe types of responses provided to database queries; (ii) limiting the number/frequency of database\nqueries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of such databases; and (iii)\nnotifying organizational personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur. This control\nfocuses on the protection of organizational information from data mining while such information\nresides in organizational data stores.

In contrast, access enforcement\noccurs when information systems enforce access control decisions. While it is very common to\nhave access control decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not\nrequired and it is not always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and\ndistributed information systems, different entities may perform access control decisions and access\nenforcement.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | TRANSMIT ACCESS AUTHORIZATION INFORMATION_\n\n**The information system transmits [Assignment: organization-defined access authorization**\n**_information] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment:_**\n**_organization-defined information systems] that enforce access control decisions._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: In distributed information systems, authorization processes and access\ncontrol decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such instances, authorization\ninformation is transmitted securely so timely access control decisions can be enforced at the\nappropriate locations. To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit\nas part of the access authorization information, supporting security attributes. This is due to\nthe fact that in distributed information systems, there are various access control decisions that\nneed to be made and different entities (e.g., services) make these decisions in a serial fashion,\neach requiring some security attributes to make the decisions. Protecting access authorization\n\n|P3|LOW AC-22|MOD AC-22|HIGH AC-22|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n|P0|LOW Not Selected|MOD Not Selected|HIGH Not Selected|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\ninformation (i.e., access control decisions) ensures that such information cannot be altered,\nspoofed, or otherwise compromised during transmission.\n\n**(2)** _ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | NO USER OR PROCESS IDENTITY_\n**The information system enforces access control decisions based on [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined security attributes] that do not include the identity of the user or process acting on behalf_**\n**of the user.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: In certain situations, it is important that access control decisions can be\nmade without information regarding the identity of the users issuing the requests. These are\ngenerally instances where preserving individual privacy is of paramount importance. In other\nsituations, user identification information is simply not needed for access control decisions\nand, especially in the case of distributed information systems, transmitting such information\nwith the needed degree of assurance may be very expensive or difficult to accomplish.\n\nReferences: None.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP0 **LOW  Not Selected** **MOD  Not Selected** **HIGH  Not Selected**\n\n**AC-25** **REFERENCE MONITOR**\n\nControl: The information system implements a reference monitor for [Assignment: organization_defined access control policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be_\nsubject to analysis and testing, the completeness of which can be assured.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information is represented internally within information systems using\nabstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of\nentities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated\nwith individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known\nas objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, interprocess pipes, and communications ports. Reference monitors typically enforce mandatory access\ncontrol policies—a type of access control that restricts access to objects based on the identity of\nsubjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The access controls are mandatory because\nsubjects with certain privileges (i.e., access permissions) are restricted from passing those\nprivileges on to any other subjects, either directly or indirectly—that is, the information system\nstrictly enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The\n_tamperproof property of the reference monitor prevents adversaries from compromising the_\nfunctioning of the mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing\nthe mechanism and hence violating the security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the\ncompleteness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect weaknesses or deficiencies\n(i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security policy.

Personnel are\ntrained to look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected\nemail, receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an\nunfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are\nalso trained on how to respond to such suspicious email or web communications (e.g., not\nopening attachments, not clicking on embedded web links, and checking the source of email\naddresses). For this process to work effectively, all organizational personnel are trained and\nmade aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to\nrecognize anomalous behaviors in organizational information systems can potentially provide\nearly warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of such anomalous behavior by\norganizational personnel can supplement automated malicious code detection and protection\ntools and systems employed by organizations.\n\nReferences: C.F.R.

Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to\n\n|P1|LOW AU-1|MOD AU-1|HIGH AU-1|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nthe security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order\nto meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password\nchanges, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege\nusage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable\nevents, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be\nimplemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control\nalso requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time.\nFor example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the capability to\nlog every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for\nspecific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements,\nincluding the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and control\nenhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal\nlaws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be\ngenerated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the\nnetwork. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and\ncan facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition\nof auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed,\ntransaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and\nactions that occur in service-oriented architectures.

This control applies to each\naudit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are\nstored), the total audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories\ncombined), or both. Related controls: AU-4, SI-12.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | AUDIT STORAGE CAPACITY_\n\n**The information system provides a warning to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles,**\n**_and/or locations] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when allocated audit_**\n**record storage volume reaches [Assignment: organization-defined percentage]** **of repository**\n**maximum audit record storage capacity.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations may have multiple audit data storage repositories\ndistributed across multiple information system components, with each repository having\ndifferent storage volume capacities.\n\n**(2)** _RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | REAL-TIME ALERTS_\n**The information system provides an alert in [Assignment: organization-defined real-time period] to**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles, and/or locations] when the following audit**\n**failure events occur: [Assignment: organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time**\n**_alerts]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts\nprovide these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to\nalert occurs in seconds or less).\n\n**(3)** _RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | CONFIGURABLE TRAFFIC VOLUME THRESHOLDS_\n**The information system enforces configurable network communications traffic volume thresholds**\n**reflecting limits on auditing capacity and [Selection: rejects; delays] network traffic above those**\n**thresholds.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations have the capability to reject or delay the processing of\nnetwork communications traffic if auditing such traffic is determined to exceed the storage\ncapacity of the information system audit function. The rejection or delay response is triggered\nby the established organizational traffic volume thresholds which can be adjusted based on\nchanges to audit storage capacity.\n\n**(4)** _RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | SHUTDOWN ON FAILURE_\n\n**The information system invokes a [Selection: full system shutdown; partial system shutdown;**\n**_degraded operational mode with limited mission/business functionality available] in the event of_**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined audit failures], unless an alternate audit capability exists.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the types of audit failures that can trigger\nautomatic information system shutdowns or degraded operations. Because of the importance\nof ensuring mission/business continuity, organizations may determine that the nature of the\naudit failure is not so severe that it warrants a complete shutdown of the information system\nsupporting the core organizational missions/business operations. In those instances, partial\ninformation system shutdowns or operating in a degraded mode with reduced capability may\nbe viable alternatives.

Rather, the enhancement\nrequires that the analysis of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated\nwith the analysis of audit information. Security Event and Information Management System\ntools can facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple information system\ncomponents as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit\nrecord analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as\nnecessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information\ncollected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information\nis important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection\nevents with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can help uncover denial of\nservice attacks or cyber attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with\nsystem monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit\ninformation to operational situations. Related controls: AU-12, IR-4, RA-5.\n\n**(6)** _AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH PHYSICAL MONITORING_\n**The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from**\n**monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate,**\n**unusual, or malevolent activity.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs from\ninformation systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious behavior\nor supporting evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individual’s\nidentity for logical access to certain information systems with the additional physical security\ninformation that the individual was actually present at the facility when the logical access\noccurred, may prove to be useful in investigations.\n\n**(7)** _AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | PERMITTED ACTIONS_\n\n**The organization specifies the permitted actions for each [Selection (one or more): information**\n**_system process; role; user] associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit_**\n**information.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations specify permitted actions for information system\nprocesses, roles, and/or users associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit\nrecords through account management techniques. Specifying permitted actions on audit\ninformation is a way to enforce the principle of least privilege. Permitted actions are enforced\nby the information system and include, for example, read, write, execute, append, and delete.\n\n**(8)** _AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | FULL TEXT ANALYSIS OF PRIVILEGED COMMANDS_\n\n**The organization performs a full text analysis of audited privileged commands in a physically**\n**distinct component or subsystem of the information system, or other information system that is**\n**dedicated to that analysis.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires a distinct environment for the\ndedicated analysis of audit information related to privileged users without compromising such\ninformation on the information system where the users have elevated privileges including the\ncapability to execute privileged commands. Full text analysis refers to analysis that considers\nthe full text of privileged commands (i.e., commands and all parameters) as opposed to\nanalysis that considers only the name of the command. Full text analysis includes, for\nexample, the use of pattern matching and heuristics. Related controls: AU-3, AU-9, AU-11,\nAU-12.\n\n**(9)** _AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH INFORMATION FROM NONTECHNICAL SOURCES_\n\n**The organization correlates information from nontechnical sources with audit information to**\n**enhance organization-wide situational awareness.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources records\ndocumenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment incidents, improper use\nof organizational information assets). Such information can lead organizations to a more\ndirected analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive\nnature of the information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access to\nsuch information to minimize the potential for the inadvertent release of privacy-related\ninformation to individuals that do not have a need to know. Thus, correlation of information\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nfrom nontechnical sources with audit information generally occurs only when individuals are\nsuspected of being involved in a security incident.

Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information\nand organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit\nreduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same information\nsystem or from the same organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction\ncapability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to\nidentify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the\ninformation system can generate customizable reports.

Granularity of time\nmeasurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and\nreference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within\ntens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for different system\ncomponents.

The\nenhancement does not apply to the initial generation of audit records prior to being written to\nan audit trail. Write-once, read-many (WORM) media includes, for example, Compact DiskRecordable (CD-R) and Digital Video Disk-Recordable (DVD-R).

Non-repudiation protects individuals against later\nclaims by: (i) authors of not having authored particular documents; (ii) senders of not having\ntransmitted messages; (iii) receivers of not having received messages; or (iv) signatories of not\nhaving signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information\noriginated from a particular individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an\nemail, signing a contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information.\nOrganizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms\n(e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts).

Provides the results of the security control assessment to [Assignment: organization-defined\n_individuals or roles]._\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations assess security controls in organizational information\nsystems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of: (i) initial and ongoing\nsecurity authorizations; (ii) FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv)\nsystem development life cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security\nis built into organizational information systems; (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in\nthe development process; (iii) provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions\nas part of security authorization processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation\nprocedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F\n(main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System\nSecurity Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of\nassessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the\nsecurity posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports\ndocument assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to\ndetermine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are\nimplemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to\nmeeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls at least\nannually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in\norganizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the\nindividuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example,\nassessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing\nofficials or authorizing official designated representatives.\n\nTo satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the\nfollowing sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous\nmonitoring; or (iii)  system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security\nassessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and\nobtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment\nresults can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with\nadditional assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with\nOMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations\nestablish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments in accordance with organizational\ncontinuous monitoring strategies. Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful\nexamples of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities\nsuch as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control.

Impartiality\nimplies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with regard to\nthe development, operation, or management of the organizational information systems under\nassessment or to the determination of security control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality,\nassessors should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where\nthe assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or\nemployees of the organizations they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in positions of\nadvocacy for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be\nobtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private sector\nentities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of\nindependence based on the security categories of information systems and/or the ultimate risk\nto organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also\ndetermine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nare sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining\nwhether contracted security assessment services have sufficient independence, for example,\nwhen information system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot\nunduly influence the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations,\nfor example, when organizations that own the information systems are small or organizational\nstructures require that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental,\noperational, or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes\ncan be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by\nindependent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability\nof the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed for purposes other than\ndirect support to authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient\nindependence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need to\nrepeat assessments.\n\n**(2)** _SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | SPECIALIZED ASSESSMENTS_\n**The organization includes as part of security control assessments, [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined frequency], [Selection: announced; unannounced], [Selection (one or more): in-depth_**\n**_monitoring; vulnerability scanning; malicious user testing; insider threat assessment;_**\n**_performance/load testing; [Assignment: organization-defined other forms of security assessment]]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations can employ information system monitoring, insider\nthreat assessments, malicious user testing, and other forms of testing (e.g., verification and\nvalidation) to improve readiness by exercising organizational capabilities and indicating\ncurrent performance levels as a means of focusing actions to improve security. Organizations\nconduct assessment activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,\ndirectives, policies, regulations, and standards.

Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e., reusing\nexisting assessment evidence) can significantly decrease the time and resources required for\norganizational assessments by limiting the amount of independent assessment activities that\norganizations need to perform. The factors that organizations may consider in determining\nwhether to accept assessment results from external organizations can vary. Determinations for\naccepting assessment results can be based on, for example, past assessment experiences one\norganization has had with another organization, the reputation that organizations have with\nregard to assessments, the level of detail of supporting assessment documentation provided, or\nmandates imposed upon organizations by federal legislation, policies, or directives.\n\nReferences: Executive Order 13587; FIPS Publication 199; NIST Special Publications 800-37,\n800-39, 800-53A, 800-115, 800-137.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP2 **LOW  CA-2** **MOD  CA-2 (1)** **HIGH  CA-2 (1) (2)**\n\n**CA-3** **SYSTEM INTERCONNECTIONS**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na.

Organizations carefully consider the risks that may be introduced\nwhen information systems are connected to other systems with different security requirements and\nsecurity controls, both within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials\ndetermine the risk associated with information system connections and the appropriate controls\nemployed. If interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, organizations do not\nneed to develop Interconnection Security Agreements. Instead, organizations can describe the\ninterface characteristics between those interconnecting systems in their respective security plans.\nIf interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within the same organization,\norganizations can either develop Interconnection Security Agreements or describe the interface\ncharacteristics between systems in the security plans for the respective systems. Organizations\nmay also incorporate Interconnection Security Agreement information into formal contracts,\nespecially for interconnections established between federal agencies and nonfederal (i.e., private\nsector) organizations. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same\nnetworks. For certain technologies (e.g., space, unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices),\nthere may be specialized connections in place during preoperational testing.

Ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for processing before\ncommencing operations; and\n\nc. Updates the security authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed\nthrough authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or executives (i.e.,\nauthorizing officials) to authorize operation of information systems and to explicitly accept the\nrisk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based\non the implementation of agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary\noversight for organizational information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business\noperations supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an inherently federal\nresponsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security\nauthorization process, authorizing officials assume responsibility and are accountable for security\nrisks associated with the operation and use of organizational information systems. Accordingly,\nauthorizing officials are in positions with levels of authority commensurate with understanding\nand accepting such information security-related risks. OMB policy requires that organizations\nconduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous monitoring\nprograms. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization requirements, so\nseparate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive\ncontinuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e.,\nsecurity plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an\nongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information system owners with an up-to-date\nstatus of the security state of organizational information systems and environments of operation.\nTo reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results\nof continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering\nreauthorization decisions.

Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to [Assignment:\n_organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]._\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats,\nvulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The\nterms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess/analyze security controls and\ninformation security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based\ndecisions. The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response\nactions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain\nthe security authorizations of information systems and common controls over time in highly\ndynamic environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities,\nand technologies. Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through\nreports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely\nrisk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions. Automation\nsupports more frequent updates to security authorization packages, hardware/software/firmware\ninventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous\nmonitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable,\nrelevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security\ncategories of information systems.

Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to\nthe monitoring process. To achieve such impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual\nor conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; (ii)\nassess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are\nserving; or (iv) place themselves in advocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their\nservices.\n\n**(2)** _CONTINUOUS MONITORING | TYPES OF ASSESSMENTS_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CA-2].\n\n**(3)** _CONTINUOUS MONITORING | TREND ANALYSES_\n\n**The organization employs trend analyses to determine if security control implementations, the**\n**frequency of continuous monitoring activities, and/or the types of activities used in the continuous**\n**monitoring process need to be modified based on empirical data.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Trend analyses can include, for example, examining recent threat\ninformation regarding the types of threat events that have occurred within the organization or\nacross the federal government, success rates of certain types of cyber attacks, emerging\nvulnerabilities in information technologies, evolving social engineering techniques, results\nfrom multiple security control assessments, the effectiveness of configuration settings, and\nfindings from Inspectors General or auditors.\n\nReferences: OMB Memorandum 11-33; NIST Special Publications 800-37, 800-39, 800-53A, 800115, 800-137; US-CERT Technical Cyber Security Alerts; DoD Information Assurance\nVulnerability Alerts.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP2 **LOW  CA-7** **MOD  CA-7 (1)** **HIGH  CA-7 (1)**\n\n**CA-8** **PENETRATION TESTING**\n\nControl: The organization conducts penetration testing [Assignment: organization-defined\n_frequency] on [Assignment: organization-defined information systems or system components]._\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on\ninformation systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be\nexploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine\nthe degree of resistance organizational information systems have to adversaries within a set of\nspecified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills). Penetration testing attempts to duplicate\nthe actions of adversaries in carrying out hostile cyber attacks against organizations and provides a\nmore in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the\nresults of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be\nconducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components of an information system and can\nexercise both physical and technical security controls. A standard method for penetration testing\nincludes, for example: (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest\nidentification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to\ndetermine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement\nbefore the commencement of penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the penetration\ntesting rules of engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be\nemployed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Organizational risk assessments guide decisions on\nthe level of independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing.

Impartiality\nimplies that penetration agents or teams are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of\ninterest with regard to the development, operation, or management of the information systems\nthat are the targets of the penetration testing. Supplemental guidance for CA-2 (1) provides\nadditional information regarding independent assessments that can be applied to penetration\ntesting.

As such, red team exercises reflect simulated adversarial attempts to compromise\norganizational mission/business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the\nsecurity state of information systems and organizations. Simulated adversarial attempts to\ncompromise organizational missions/business functions and the information systems that\nsupport those missions/functions may include technology-focused attacks (e.g., interactions\nwith hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission/business processes) and\nsocial engineering-based attacks (e.g., interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or\npersonal conversations). While penetration testing may be largely laboratory-based testing,\norganizations use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect\n\n|P2|LOW CA-7|MOD CA-7 (1)|HIGH CA-7 (1)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nreal-world conditions.

Security program policies and procedures at the organization\nlevel may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can\nbe included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can\nbe represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The\nprocedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information\nsystems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing\npolicy and procedures.

Baseline configurations\nserve as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline\nconfigurations include information about information system components (e.g., standard software\npackages installed on workstations, notebook computers, servers, network components, or mobile\ndevices; current version numbers and patch information on operating systems and applications;\nand configuration settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those\ncomponents within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating\nnew baselines as organizational information systems change over time. Baseline configurations of\ninformation systems reflect the current enterprise architecture.

Such tools\ncan be deployed and/or allocated as common controls, at the information system level, or at\nthe operating system or component level (e.g., on workstations, servers, notebook computers,\nnetwork components, or mobile devices). Tools can be used, for example, to track version\nnumbers on operating system applications, types of software installed, and current patch\nlevels. This control enhancement can be satisfied by the implementation of CM-8 (2) for\norganizations that choose to combine information system component inventory and baseline\nconfiguration activities.

Separate baseline configurations allow\norganizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of\nconfiguration. For example, management of operational configurations typically emphasizes\nthe need for stability, while management of development/test configurations requires greater\nflexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror the configurations in the operational\nenvironment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of the\nproposed changes to the operational systems.

For\nexample, organizational policies and procedures for notebook computers used by individuals\ndeparting on and returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are\nof concern, defining required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the devices are\nconfigured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying specific safeguards to the\ndevice after travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include, for\nexample, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and additional hardening\n(e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified safeguards applied to mobile devices\nupon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for signs of physical\ntampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive.

Configuration change\ncontrol includes changes to baseline configurations for components and configuration items of\ninformation systems, changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g.,\noperating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled/unauthorized\nchanges, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities. Typical processes for managing configuration\nchanges to information systems include, for example, Configuration Control Boards that approve\nproposed changes to systems. For new development information systems or systems undergoing\nmajor upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from development organizations\non the Configuration Control Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities before and after\nchanges are made to organizational information systems and the auditing activities required to\nimplement such changes.

Organizations\nensure that testing does not interfere with information system operations. Individuals/groups\nconducting tests understand organizational security policies and procedures, information\nsystem security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental\nrisks associated with particular facilities/processes. Operational systems may need to be taken\noff-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If information\nsystems must be taken off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned\nsystem outages whenever possible. If testing cannot be conducted on operational systems,\norganizations employ compensating controls (e.g., testing on replicated systems).\n\n**(3)** _CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | AUTOMATED CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION_\n\n**The organization employs automated mechanisms to implement changes to the current**\n**information system baseline and deploys the updated baseline across the installed base.**\n\n**(4)** _CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE_\n\n**The organization requires an information security representative to be a member of the**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined configuration change control element].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information security representatives can include, for example, senior\nagency information security officers, information system security officers, or information\nsystem security managers. Representation by personnel with information security expertise is\nimportant because changes to information system configurations can have unintended side\neffects, some of which may be security-relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process\ncan help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security\nstate of organizational information systems. The configuration change control element in this\ncontrol enhancement reflects the change control elements defined by organizations in CM-3.\n\n**(5)** _CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | AUTOMATED SECURITY RESPONSE_\n**The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined security responses]**\n**automatically if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Security responses include, for example, halting information system\nprocessing, halting selected system functions, or issuing alerts/notifications to organizational\npersonnel when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.\n\n**(6)** _CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | CRYPTOGRAPHY MANAGEMENT_\n\n**The organization ensures that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide [Assignment:**\n**_organization-defined security safeguards] are under configuration management._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Regardless of the cryptographic means employed (e.g., public key,\nprivate key, shared secrets), organizations ensure that there are processes and procedures in\nplace to effectively manage those means. For example, if devices use certificates as a basis for\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nidentification and authentication, there needs to be a process in place to address the expiration\nof those certificates.

Security\nimpact analysis may include, for example, reviewing security plans to understand security control\nrequirements and reviewing system design documentation to understand control implementation\nand how specific changes might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also include\nassessments of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional\nsecurity controls are required.

Organizations\nmaintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to\nsupport after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized changes. Access\nrestrictions for change also include software libraries. Access restrictions include, for example,\nphysical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries,\nabstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into\ninformation systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times,\nmaking unauthorized changes easy to discover).

Information technology products for which securityrelated configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers\n(e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations,\ninput/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls,\nrouters, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors),\noperating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters\nimpacting the security state of information systems including the parameters required to satisfy\nother security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: (i) registry\nsettings; (ii) account, file, directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports,\nprotocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide\nconfiguration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The\nestablished settings become part of the systems configuration baseline.\n\nCommon secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown\nand hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide\nrecognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings\nfor specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those\ninformation system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations\ncan be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology\nproduct developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and\nother organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include the\n\n|P1|LOW Not Selected|MOD CM-5|HIGH CM-5 (1) (2) (3)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nUnited States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the implementation of\nCM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7.

Additionally, it is sometimes convenient\nto provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases\nrisk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit\ncomponent functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not\nboth). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual\ncomponents of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for\nelimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing).\nOrganizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g.,\nUniversal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information\nsystems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or\nunauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and\nprevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection\n\n|P1|LOW CM-6|MOD CM-6|HIGH CM-6 (1) (2)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nsystems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.\nRelated controls: AC-6, CM-2, RA-5, SA-5, SC-7.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | PERIODIC REVIEW_\n\n**The organization:**\n\n**(a) Reviews the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to identify**\n**unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services; and**\n\n**(b) Disables [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, and services within**\n**_the information system deemed to be unnecessary and/or nonsecure]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The organization can either make a determination of the relative\nsecurity of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the\nassessment of other entities.

Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the information system;\n\n3. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and\n\n4. Includes [Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve\n_effective information system component accountability]; and_\n\nb. Reviews and updates the information system component inventory [Assignment:\n_organization-defined frequency]._\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system\ncomponent inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. In\nsuch situations, organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific\ninformation required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system association,\ninformation system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective accountability of\ninformation system components includes, for example, hardware inventory specifications,\nsoftware license information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked\ncomponents or devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include,\nfor example, manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location.

Virtual machines, for example, can be difficult to monitor because such machines are\nnot visible to the network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-todate, complete, and accurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable.

Monitoring for unauthorized system\ncomponents may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the periodic scanning of systems\nfor that purpose. Automated mechanisms can be implemented within information systems or\nin other separate devices. Isolation can be achieved, for example, by placing unauthorized\ninformation system components in separate domains or subnets or otherwise quarantining\nsuch components. This type of component isolation is commonly referred to as sandboxing.\nRelated controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, RA-5.\n\n**(4)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ACCOUNTABILITY INFORMATION_\n**The organization includes in the information system component inventory information, a means for**\n**identifying by [Selection (one or more): name; position; role], individuals responsible/accountable**\n**for administering those components.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Identifying individuals who are both responsible and accountable for\nadministering information system components helps to ensure that the assigned components\nare properly administered and organizations can contact those individuals if some action is\nrequired (e.g., component is determined to be the source of a breach/compromise, component\nneeds to be recalled/replaced, or component needs to be relocated).\n\n**(5)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | NO DUPLICATE ACCOUNTING OF COMPONENTS_\n\n**The organization verifies that all components within the authorization boundary of the information**\n**system are not duplicated in other information system component inventories.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses the potential problem of duplicate\naccounting of information system components in large or complex interconnected systems.\n\n**(6)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ASSESSED CONFIGURATIONS / APPROVED DEVIATIONS_\n\n**The organization includes assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to**\n**current deployed configurations in the information system component inventory.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on configuration settings established\nby organizations for information system components, the specific components that have been\nassessed to determine compliance with the required configuration settings, and any approved\ndeviations from established configuration settings. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6.\n\n**(7)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY_\n\n**The organization provides a centralized repository for the inventory of information system**\n**components.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to implement centralized information\nsystem component inventories that include components from all organizational information\nsystems. Centralized repositories of information system component inventories provide\nopportunities for efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware, software, and\nfirmware assets. Such repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify the location\nand responsible individuals of system components that have been compromised, breached, or\nare otherwise in need of mitigation actions. Organizations ensure that the resulting centralized\ninventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability\n(e.g., information system association, information system owner).\n\n**(8)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED LOCATION TRACKING_\n**The organization employs automated mechanisms to support tracking of information system**\n**components by geographic location.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The use of automated mechanisms to track the location of information\nsystem components can increase the accuracy of component inventories. Such capability may\nalso help organizations rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of system\ncomponents that have been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation\nactions.\n\n**(9)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ASSIGNMENT OF COMPONENTS TO SYSTEMS_\n**The organization:**\n\n**(a) Assigns [Assignment: organization-defined acquired information system components] to an**\n**information system; and**\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**(b) Receives an acknowledgement from the information system owner of this assignment.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the criteria for or types of information system\ncomponents (e.g., microprocessors, motherboards, software, programmable logic controllers,\nand network devices) that are subject to this control enhancement.

Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the system development\nlife cycle and for managing the configuration of the configuration items;\n\nc. Defines the configuration items for the information system and places the configuration items\nunder configuration management; and\n\nd. Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration\nmanagement policies while being tailored to individual information systems. Such plans define\ndetailed processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system\ndevelopment life cycle activities at the information system level. Configuration management plans\nare typically developed during the development/acquisition phase of the system development life\ncycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management processes, how to\nupdate configuration settings and baselines, how to maintain information system component\ninventories, how to control development, test, and operational environments, and how to develop,\nrelease, and update key documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent\nand timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Such templates\ncan represent a master configuration management plan for the organization at large with subsets of\nthe plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes\ninclude designation of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving\nproposed changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security impact analyses\nprior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the information\nsystem items (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed. As\ninformation systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items\nmay be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under\nconfiguration control.

Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders are routinely provided\nunder software license agreements that permit individuals to study, change, and improve the\nsoftware. From a security perspective, the major advantage of open source software is that it\nprovides organizations with the ability to examine the source code. However, there are also\nvarious licensing issues associated with open source software including, for example, the\nconstraints on derivative use of such software.\n\nReferences: None.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP2 **LOW  CM-10** **MOD  CM-10** **HIGH  CM-10**\n\n**CM-11** **USER-INSTALLED SOFTWARE**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na.

Protects the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall\norganizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions.\nContingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of\nalternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised. The effectiveness of\ncontingency planning is maximized by considering such planning throughout the phases of the\nsystem development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and\nfirmware development can be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency.\nContingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information\nsystems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of\noperations desired. Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive\nOrders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information\nsystem availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a\nreduction in mission and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the\nconfidentiality or integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans\ninclude, for example, orderly/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a\nmanual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are\nunder attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities,\norganizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning activities are in place and\nactivated in the event of a security incident.

This control\napplies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and documented in AC14; and (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual\nauthentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts\n(e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations\nemploy passwords, tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor\nauthentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is\ndefined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational\ninformation systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is\nobtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to\n\n|P1|LOW IA-1|MOD IA-1|HIGH IA-1|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\norganizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such\naccess is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type\nof network access that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet).\nInternal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of\nencrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between organizationcontrolled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal\nnetworks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information\ntraversing the network.\n\nOrganizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by\ncomplying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with\nthe specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of\ntwo or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: (i) something\nyou know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g.,\ncryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor\nsolutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for\nexample, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart\ncards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD common\naccess card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level\n(i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication mechanisms at the\napplication level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Identification and\nauthentication requirements for other than organizational users are described in IA-8.

The second path (i.e., the out-of-band\npath) is used to independently verify the authentication and/or requested action. For example,\na user authenticates via a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires\naccess, and requests some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently, the\nserver contacts the user via the user’s cell phone to verify that the requested action originated\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nfrom the user. The user may either confirm the intended action to an individual on the\ntelephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. This type of authentication can\nbe employed by organizations to mitigate actual or suspected man-in the-middle attacks. The\nconditions for activation can include, for example, suspicious activities, new threat indicators\nor elevated threat levels, or the impact level or classification level of information in requested\ntransactions.

Information\nsystems typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or\nTransmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or\norganizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol\n\n[EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to\nidentify/authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. Organizations determine the\nrequired strength of authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems.\nBecause of the challenges of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to\nonly apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this\ncapability.

A network connection is any connection with a device that\ncommunicates through a network (e.g., local area or wide area network, Internet). A remote\nconnection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g.,\nthe Internet). Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity\nof other devices for connections that are of greater risk (e.g., remote connections).

This might be determined via\nsome cryptographic hash of the device. If device attestation is the means of identification and\nauthentication, then it is important that patches and updates to the device are handled via a\nconfiguration management process such that the those patches/updates are done securely and\nat the same time do not disrupt the identification and authentication to other devices.\n\nReferences: None.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP1 **LOW  Not Selected** **MOD  IA-3** **HIGH  IA-3**\n\n**IA-4** **IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT**\n\nControl: The organization manages information system identifiers by:\n\na.

Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and\n\ne. Disabling the identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period of inactivity].\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control\n(MAC), Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of\nindividual identifiers is not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and\nanonymous accounts). Typically, individual identifiers are the user names of the information\nsystem accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management\nactivities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control also addresses individual\nidentifiers not necessarily associated with information system accounts (e.g., identifiers used in\nphysical security control databases accessed by badge reader systems for access to information\nsystems). Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used\nindividual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices.\nRelated controls: AC-2, IA-2, IA-3, IA-5, IA-8, SC-37.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | PROHIBIT ACCOUNT IDENTIFIERS AS PUBLIC IDENTIFIERS_\n**The organization prohibits the use of information system account identifiers that are the same as**\n**public identifiers for individual electronic mail accounts.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Prohibiting the use of information systems account identifiers that are\nthe same as some public identifier such as the individual identifier section of an electronic\nmail address, makes it more difficult for adversaries to guess user identifiers on organizational\ninformation systems.

Related control: AT-2.\n\n**(5)** _IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC MANAGEMENT_\n\n**The information system dynamically manages identifiers.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: In contrast to conventional approaches to identification which presume\nstatic accounts for preregistered users, many distributed information systems including, for\nexample, service-oriented architectures, rely on establishing identifiers at run time for entities\nthat were previously unknown. In these situations, organizations anticipate and provision for\nthe dynamic establishment of identifiers.

Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to\nprotect authenticators; and\n\nj. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens,\nbiometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g.,\nthe initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum\npassword length). In many cases, developers ship information system components with factory\ndefault authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default\nauthentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant\nsecurity risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control\nPL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and\nSC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored\nin hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with\nadministrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management by\norganization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including,\nfor example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time\nsynchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of\nbiometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for\nexample, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual\nauthenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately.\nAuthenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators\nfor temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include,\nfor example, certificates and passwords.

This control enhancement does not\napply when passwords are used to unlock hardware authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nVerification cards). The implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of\nthe requirements in the enhancement. Cryptographically-protected passwords include, for\nexample, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords.\nThe number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to\nthe total number of positions in the current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not\napply to temporary passwords. To mitigate certain brute force attacks against passwords,\norganizations may also consider salting passwords.

For PIV cards, validation of\ncertifications involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common\nPolicy Root trust anchor including certificate policy processing. Related control: IA-6.\n\n**(3)** _AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | IN-PERSON OR TRUSTED THIRD-PARTY REGISTRATION_\n\n**The organization requires that the registration process to receive [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined types of and/or specific authenticators] be conducted [Selection: in person; by a trusted_**\n**_third party] before [Assignment: organization-defined registration authority] with authorization by_**\n\n**_[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]._**\n\n**(4)** _AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PASSWORD STRENGTH DETERMINATION_\n**The organization employs automated tools to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently**\n**strong to satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined requirements].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on the creation of strong passwords\nand the characteristics of such passwords (e.g., complexity) prior to use, the enforcement of\nwhich is carried out by organizational information systems in IA-5 (1). Related controls: CA2, CA-7, RA-5.\n\n**(5)** _AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | CHANGE AUTHENTICATORS PRIOR TO DELIVERY_\n\n**The organization requires developers/installers of information system components to provide**\n**unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement extends the requirement for organizations to\nchange default authenticators upon information system installation, by requiring developers\nand/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system\ncomponents prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to the\ndevelopers of commercial off-the-shelve information technology products. Requirements for\nunique authenticators can be included in acquisition documents prepared by organizations\nwhen procuring information systems or system components.\n\n**(6)** _AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PROTECTION OF AUTHENTICATORS_\n**The organization protects authenticators commensurate with the security category of the**\n**information to which use of the authenticator permits access.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: For information systems containing multiple security categories of\ninformation without reliable physical or logical separation between categories, authenticators\nused to grant access to the systems are protected commensurate with the highest security\ncategory of information on the systems.\n\n**(7)** _AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | NO EMBEDDED UNENCRYPTED STATIC AUTHENTICATORS_\n\n**The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications**\n**or access scripts or stored on function keys.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations exercise caution in determining whether embedded or\nstored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nmanner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators.

Possible alternatives include, for example:\n(i) having different authenticators on all systems; (ii) employing some form of single sign-on\nmechanism; or (iii) including some form of one-time passwords on all systems.\n\n**(9)** _AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | CROSS-ORGANIZATION CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT_\n**The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for**\n**cross-organization management of credentials.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Cross-organization management of credentials provides the capability\nfor organizations to appropriately authenticate individuals, groups, roles, or devices when\nconducting cross-organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of\ninformation.\n\n**(10)** _AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC CREDENTIAL ASSOCIATION_\n\n**The information system dynamically provisions identities.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and\nthe authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, this binding is\nestablished by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the information\nsystem. For example, the binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e.,\nauthenticator) is accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the\ninformation system. New authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity\nand the authenticator to be implemented outside an information system. For example, with\nsmartcard credentials, the identity and the authenticator are bound together on the card. Using\nthese credentials, information systems can authenticate identities that have not been preprovisioned, dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication. In these situations,\norganizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities. Preestablished trust\nrelationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related\ncredentials are essential.\n\n**(11)** _AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | HARDWARE TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION_\n\n**The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs mechanisms that**\n**satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined token quality requirements].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Hardware token-based authentication typically refers to the use of\nPKI-based tokens, such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.\nOrganizations define specific requirements for tokens, such as working with a particular PKI.\n\n**(12)** _AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | BIOMETRIC-BASED AUTHENTICATION_\n\n**The information system, for biometric-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined biometric quality requirements].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Unlike password-based authentication which provides exact matches\nof user-input passwords to stored passwords, biometric authentication does not provide such\nexact matches. Depending upon the type of biometric and the type of collection mechanism,\nthere is likely to be some divergence from the presented biometric and stored biometric which\nserves as the basis of comparison. There will likely be both false positives and false negatives\nwhen making such comparisons. The rate at which the false accept and false reject rates are\nequal is known as the crossover rate.

Performing other [Assignment: organization-defined actions].\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive\ninformation is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not authorized to process such\ninformation. Such information spills often occur when information that is initially thought to be of\nlower sensitivity is transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined to be\nof higher sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational\nresponse is generally based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security\ncategory or classification level), the security capabilities of the information system, the specific\nnature of contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations (e.g., security clearances) of\nindividuals with authorized access to the contaminated system. The methods used to communicate\ninformation about the spill after the fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual\nspill to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such contamination is\nisolated and eradicated.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | RESPONSIBLE PERSONNEL_\n\n**The organization assigns [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] with responsibility**\n**for responding to information spills.**\n\n**(2)** _INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | TRAINING_\n\n**The organization provides information spillage response training [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined frequency]._**\n\n**(3)** _INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | POST-SPILL OPERATIONS_\n\n**The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined procedures] to ensure that**\n**organizational personnel impacted by information spills can continue to carry out assigned tasks**\n**while contaminated systems are undergoing corrective actions.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Correction actions for information systems contaminated due to\ninformation spillages may be very time-consuming.

Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers, implementers, and\noperators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat in order to implement defensive measures\nthat will enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid\ndetection of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective\ndefensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated security analysis\nteam can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new\nincident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence development.

Such maintenance provides for the systematic\ninspection, tests, measurements, adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of\nincipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects. The\nprimary goal of preventive maintenance is to avoid/mitigate the consequences of equipment\nfailures. Preventive maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by\nreplacing worn components before they actually fail. Methods of determining what preventive\n(or other) failure management policies to apply include, for example, original equipment\nmanufacturer (OEM) recommendations, statistical failure records, requirements of codes,\nlegislation, or regulations within a jurisdiction, expert opinion, maintenance that has already\nbeen conducted on similar equipment, or measured values and performance indications.\n\n**(2)** _TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE_\n**The organization performs predictive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined**\n**_information system components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to\nevaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online) equipment\ncondition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a\nscheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the\nequipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive\nmaintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition.\nThis approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the\nfuture maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are\nperformed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system\noperations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system\nreliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the item. To evaluate\nequipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such\nas infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration\nanalysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online tests.\n\n**(3)** _TIMELY MAINTENANCE | AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE_\n\n**The organization employs automated mechanisms to transfer predictive maintenance data to a**\n**computerized maintenance management system.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: A computerized maintenance management system maintains a\ncomputer database of information about the maintenance operations of organizations and\nautomates processing equipment condition data in order to trigger maintenance planning,\nexecution, and reporting.\n\nReferences: None.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\n|P2|LOW Not Selected|MOD MA-6|HIGH MA-6|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**FAMILY: MEDIA PROTECTION**\n\n**MP-1** **MEDIA PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na.

Updates the plan to address changes to the information system/environment of operation or\nproblems identified during plan implementation or security control assessments; and\n\ne. Protects the security plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and\ncontrol enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and\ncontrol enhancements meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical\ndescriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans\ncontain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and\nselection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is\nunambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to\norganizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is\nimplemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control\nbaselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use\nor to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g.,\nDoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and Access\nManagement, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on developing overlays.\n\nSecurity plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents\nincluding documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references\nto policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications)\nwhere more detailed information can be obtained.

Ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected in the security\nplan, the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and organizational\nprocurements/acquisitions.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and\ndevelopment of information systems. The information security architecture at the individual\ninformation system level is consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide\ninformation security architecture described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the\nenterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description,\nthe placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related\ninformation for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the\nprotection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can\ninclude other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges\nassigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information processed, stored,\nand transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and information\nsystem services, and any other specific protection needs.\n\nIn today’s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all\ninformation resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services\nand service providers. Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is\nimportant to developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing,\ndeveloping, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration\nfor organizational information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective\ninformation security architecture. The development of the information security architecture is\ncoordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to\nensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively\nimplemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure\nthat organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and\nthat the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture\nthrough the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily\ndirected at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although\nSA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17,\nwhich is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of\ninformation systems or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to\ndemonstrate/show consistency with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information\nsecurity architecture. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6, PL-2, PM-7, SA-5, SA-17, Appendix J.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH_\n**The organization designs its security architecture using a defense-in-depth approach that:**\n\n**(a) Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment:**\n**_organization-defined locations and architectural layers]; and_**\n\n**(b) Ensures that the allocated security safeguards operate in a coordinated and mutually**\n**reinforcing manner.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural,\ntechnical, or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have to overcome multiple\nsafeguards to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple mechanisms\nmakes it more difficult to successfully attack critical information resources (i.e., increases\nadversary work factor) and also increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination of\nallocated safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack that involves one safeguard does not\ncreate adverse unintended consequences (e.g., lockout, cascading alarms) by interfering with\nanother safeguard. Placement of security safeguards is a key activity. Greater asset criticality\nor information value merits additional layering. Thus, an organization may choose to place\nanti-virus software at organizational boundary layers, email/web servers, notebook computers,\nand workstations to maximize the number of related safeguards adversaries must penetrate\nbefore compromising the information and information systems.

Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings.\nFor example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at\ndifferent times, often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms according to\ntheir priorities and development schedules. By having different products at different locations\n(e.g., server, boundary, desktop) there is an increased likelihood that at least one will detect\nthe malicious code.

Central management includes\nplanning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally\nmanaged security controls and processes. As central management of security controls is generally\nassociated with common controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of\nsecurity control implementations and management and judicious use of organizational resources.\nCentrally-managed security controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for\nassessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate as part of organizational\ncontinuous monitoring. As part of the security control selection process, organizations determine\nwhich controls may be suitable for central management based on organizational resources and\ncapabilities. Organizations consider that it may not always be possible to centrally manage every\naspect of a security control. In such cases, the security control is treated as a hybrid control with\nthe control managed and implemented either centrally or at the information system level.

Updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or whenever there\nare significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the\nidentification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the\nsecurity state of the system.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective\nrisk assessments. Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and\nimpact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation\nbased on the operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also take into account\nrisk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on\nbehalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing\nentities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of\npublic users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or\nprivacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access\nto federal information systems.\n\nRisk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk\nmanagement hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information\nsystem level) and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be\nconducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security\ncontrol selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information\nsystem authorization, and security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must\nbe partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the\nfirst two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role\nin security control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance,\nwhich includes security control supplementation.

Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;\n\n2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and\n\n3. Measuring vulnerability impact;\n\nc. Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;\n\nd. Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in\naccordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and\n\ne. Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control\nassessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate\nsimilar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or\ndeficiencies).\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Security categorization of information systems guides the frequency and\ncomprehensiveness of vulnerability scans. Organizations determine the required vulnerability\nscanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities\nsuch as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for\ncustom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic\nanalysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these\nanalysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis\ntools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example:\n(i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should\nnot be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly\noperating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express\nvulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that\nuse the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of\nvulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness\nEnumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security\ncontrol assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities\nfor which to scan. Organizations also consider using tools that express vulnerability impact by the\nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

Integrates the organizational information security risk management process into system\ndevelopment life cycle activities.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation for\nthe successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems.\nTo apply the required security controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic\nunderstanding of information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical\nmissions/business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly\napplied if individuals that design, code, and test information systems and system components\n(including information technology products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations\ninclude qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers, security architects,\nsecurity engineers, and information system security officers in system development life cycle\nactivities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated into organizational information\nsystems. It is equally important that developers include individuals on the development team that\npossess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are\neffectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training programs can\nhelp ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the appropriate\nexperience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The\neffective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that\nimportant security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that\nthose considerations are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This\nprocess also facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise\narchitecture, consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies.\nRelated controls: AT-3, PM-7, SA-8.\n\nControl Enhancements: None.\n\nReferences: NIST Special Publications 800-37, 800-64.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP1 **LOW  SA-3** **MOD  SA-3** **HIGH  SA-3**\n\n**SA-4** **ACQUISITION PROCESS**\n\nControl: The organization includes the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly\nor by reference, in the acquisition contract for the information system, system component, or\ninformation system service in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,\ndirectives, policies, regulations, standards, guidelines, and organizational mission/business needs:\n\n|P1|LOW SA-2|MOD SA-2|HIGH SA-2|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n|P1|LOW SA-3|MOD SA-3|HIGH SA-3|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\na.

Requirements for protecting security-related documentation;\n\nf. Description of the information system development environment and environment in which\nthe system is intended to operate; and\n\ng. Acceptance criteria.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information system components are discrete, identifiable information\ntechnology assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks of an\ninformation system. Information system components include commercial information technology\nproducts. Security functional requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and\nsecurity mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions,\nand mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to direct attack, and\nresistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance requirements include: (i) development\nprocesses, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development and\nassessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security functionality has\nbeen implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security documentation\nrequirements address all phases of the system development life cycle.\n\nSecurity functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of\nsecurity controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process.\nThe security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values\nthrough the use of assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform\ndependencies and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and\nadministrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security controls. The level\nof detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level\nof the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security\ncapability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the\norganizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally\nmandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services.\nAcceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and information\nsystem services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational acquisition\nor procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information\nsecurity requirements from FISMA.

Information systems can be partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem\nwithin the system can contain one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is\nexpressed in terms of multiple subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing\nsecurity-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system is expressed in terms of\nmodules with particular emphasis on software and firmware (but not excluding hardware) and\nthe interfaces between modules providing security-relevant functionality.

This early involvement in the life cycle\nhelps organizations to avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that\npose unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific\nports, protocols, or services (or when requiring information system service providers to do\nso). Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting\nof security controls after the information system, system component, or information system\nservice has been implemented.

Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine\nthe quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation\nmay occur, for example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support\nfrom developers and contractors. In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected\ndocumentation if such documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of\nsecurity controls. The level of protection provided for selected information system, component, or\nservice documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system.\nFor example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons system or command and control\nsystem would typically require a higher level of protection than a routine administrative system.\nDocumentation that addresses information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased\nlevel of protection. Secure operation of the information system, includes, for example, initially\nstarting the system and resuming secure system operation after any lapse in system operation.\nRelated controls: CM-6, CM-8, PL-2, PL-4, PS-2, SA-3, SA-4.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION | FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SECURITY CONTROLS_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-4 (1)].\n\n**(2)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION | SECURITY-RELEVANT EXTERNAL SYSTEM INTERFACES_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-4 (2)].\n\n**(3)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION | HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-4 (2)].\n\n**(4)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION | LOW-LEVEL DESIGN_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-4 (2)].\n\n**(5)** _INFORMATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION | SOURCE CODE_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-4 (2)].\n\nReferences: None.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP2 **LOW  SA-5** **MOD  SA-5** **HIGH  SA-5**\n\n**SA-6** **SOFTWARE USAGE RESTRICTIONS**\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-10 and SI-7].\n\n|P2|LOW SA-5|MOD SA-5|HIGH SA-5|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**SA-7** **USER-INSTALLED SOFTWARE**\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-11 and SI-7].\n\n**SA-8** **SECURITY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES**\n\nControl: The organization applies information system security engineering principles in the\nspecification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the information system.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations apply security engineering principles primarily to new\ndevelopment information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems,\norganizations apply security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the\nextent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware within those systems.\nSecurity engineering principles include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii)\nestablishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; (iii)\nincorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle; (iv) delineating\nphysical and logical security boundaries; (v) ensuring that system developers are trained on how to\nbuild secure software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet organizational and operational needs;\n(vii) performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors, and attack\npatterns as well as compensating controls and design patterns needed to mitigate risk; and (viii)\nreducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions.

Requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational\ninformation security requirements and employ [Assignment: organization-defined security\n_controls] in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,_\nregulations, standards, and guidance;\n\nb. Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard\nto external information system services; and\n\nc. Employs [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques] to monitor\nsecurity control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: External information system services are services that are implemented\noutside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This includes\nservices that are used by, but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB\npolicy require that organizations using external service providers that are processing, storing, or\ntransmitting federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal\ngovernment ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies\nare required to meet. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a\nvariety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts,\ninteragency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply chain\nexchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information system\nservices remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust\nrequires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating\n\n|P1|LOW Not Selected|MOD SA-8|HIGH SA-8|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nprovider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection\nfor the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the\nrelationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis\nfor trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External information\nsystem services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and\nresponsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of\nperformance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and\nresponse requirements for identified instances of noncompliance. Related controls: CA-3, IR-7,\nPS-7.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | RISK ASSESSMENTS / ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVALS_\n\n**The organization:**\n\n**(a) Conducts an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of**\n**dedicated information security services; and**\n\n**(b) Ensures that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is**\n**approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Dedicated information security services include, for example, incident\nmonitoring, analysis and response, operation of information security-related devices such as\nfirewalls, or key management services. Related controls: CA-6, RA-3.\n\n**(2)** _EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS / PORTS / PROTOCOLS / SERVICES_\n**The organization requires providers of [Assignment: organization-defined external information**\n**_system services] to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and other services required for the use_**\n**of such services.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information from external service providers regarding the specific\nfunctions, ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be\nparticularly useful when the need arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting\ncertain functions/services or blocking certain ports/protocols. Related control: CM-7.\n\n**(3)** _EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | ESTABLISH / MAINTAIN TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVIDERS_\n\n**The organization establishes, documents, and maintains trust relationships with external service**\n**providers based on [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements, properties, factors,**\n**_or conditions defining acceptable trust relationships]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is\nat an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in the external providers,\nindividually or in combination. Trust relationships can help organization to gain increased\nlevels of confidence that participating service providers are providing adequate protection for\nthe services rendered. Such relationships can be complicated due to the number of potential\nentities participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and\nlevels of trust, and the types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of\ntrust is based on the amount of direct control organizations are able to exert on external\nservice providers with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the protection\nof the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those\ncontrols. The level of control is typically established by the terms and conditions of the\ncontracts or service-level agreements and can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating\ncontracts or agreements that specify security requirements for the providers) to very limited\ncontrol (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity services such as\ncommercial telecommunications services). In other cases, levels of trust are based on factors\nthat convince organizations that required security controls have been employed and that\ndeterminations of control effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external\ninformation system services provided to organizations through well-established business\nrelationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable risk range of\nthe organizations using the services. External service providers may also outsource selected\nservices to other external entities, making the trust relationship more difficult and complicated\nto manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may find it very difficult to\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nplace significant trust in external providers. This is not due to any inherent untrustworthiness\non the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services.\n\n**(4)** _EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | CONSISTENT INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS_\n**The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure that**\n**the interests of [Assignment: organization-defined external service providers] are consistent with**\n**and reflect organizational interests.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: As organizations increasingly use external service providers, the\npossibility exists that the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational\ninterests. In such situations, simply having the correct technical, procedural, or operational\nsafeguards in place may not be sufficient if the service providers that implement and control\nthose safeguards are not operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming\norganizations. Possible actions that organizations might take to address such concerns include,\nfor example, requiring background checks for selected service provider personnel, examining\nownership records, employing only trustworthy service providers (i.e., providers with which\norganizations have had positive experiences), and conducting periodic/unscheduled visits to\nservice provider facilities.\n\n**(5)** _EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND SERVICE LOCATION_\n**The organization restricts the location of [Selection (one or more): information processing;**\n**_information/data; information system services] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations]_**\n**based on [Assignment: organization-defined requirements or conditions].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The location of information processing, information/data storage, or\ninformation system services that are critical to organizations can have a direct impact on the\nability of those organizations to successfully execute their missions/business functions. This\nsituation exists when external providers control the location of processing, storage or services.\nThe criteria external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations\nmay be different from organizational criteria. For example, organizations may want to ensure\nthat data/information storage locations are restricted to certain locations to facilitate incident\nresponse activities (e.g., forensic analyses, after-the-fact investigations) in case of information\nsecurity breaches/compromises. Such incident response activities may be adversely affected\nby the governing laws or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur and/or\nthe locations from which information system services emanate.\n\nReferences: NIST Special Publication 800-35.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP1 **LOW  SA-9** **MOD  SA-9 (2)** **HIGH  SA-9 (2)**\n\n**SA-10** **DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT**\n\nControl: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or\ninformation system service to:\n\na.

Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the\nconfiguration management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective\nsecurity safeguards. Safeguards include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification\nor destruction, the master copies of all material used to generate security-relevant portions of the\nsystem hardware, software, and firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information\nsystem, information system component, or information system service requires configuration\ncontrol throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent\nunauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under configuration management (if\nexistence/use is required by other security controls) include: the formal model; the functional,\nhigh-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation;\nsource code and hardware schematics; the running version of the object code; tools for comparing\nnew versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code with\nprevious versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs\nof organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide\nconfiguration management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle.\nRelated controls: CM-3, CM-4, CM-9, SA-12, SI-2.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | SOFTWARE / FIRMWARE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION_\n**The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or**\n**information system service to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized\nchanges to software and firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or\nmechanisms provided by developers. Integrity checking mechanisms can also address\ncounterfeiting of software and firmware components.

Produce evidence of the execution of the security assessment plan and the results of the\nsecurity testing/evaluation;\n\nd. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and\n\ne. Correct flaws identified during security testing/evaluation.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post-design phases\nof the system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that the required security\ncontrols are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security policy,\nand meeting established security requirements. Security properties of information systems may be\naffected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These\ninterconnections or changes (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may\nadversely affect previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types\nof security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws.\nTesting custom software applications may require approaches such as static analysis, dynamic\n\n|P1|LOW Not Selected|MOD SA-10|HIGH SA-10|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nanalysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Developers can employ these\nanalysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis\ntools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific\nactivities that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and\nreviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be applied, and the types of\nartifacts produced during those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation refers to the\nrigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or white\nbox testing). The coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type)\nof the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for\nsecurity assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans/processes\nhave been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence,\nand documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the\ninformation system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements. Related\ncontrols: CA-2, CM-4, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5, SI-2.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | STATIC CODE ANALYSIS_\n\n**The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or**\n**information system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and**\n**document the results of the analysis.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for\nsecurity reviews. Such analysis can be used to identify security vulnerabilities and enforce\nsecurity coding practices. Static code analysis is most effective when used early in the\ndevelopment process, when each code change can be automatically scanned for potential\nweaknesses. Static analysis can provide clear remediation guidance along with defects to\nenable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of correct implementation of static analysis\ncan include, for example, aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that\ndefects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were\nfixed. An excessively high density of ignored findings (commonly referred to as ignored or\nfalse positives) indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or tool. In such cases,\norganizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.\n\n**(2)** _DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | THREAT AND VULNERABILITY ANALYSES_\n\n**The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or**\n**information system service to perform threat and vulnerability analyses and subsequent**\n**testing/evaluation of the as-built system, component, or service.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Applications may deviate significantly from the functional and design\nspecifications created during the requirements and design phases of the system development\nlife cycle. Therefore, threat and vulnerability analyses of information systems, system\ncomponents, and information system services prior to delivery are critical to the effective\noperation of those systems, components, and services. Threat and vulnerability analyses at\nthis phase of the life cycle help to ensure that design or implementation changes have been\naccounted for, and that any new vulnerabilities created as a result of those changes have been\nreviewed and mitigated. Related controls: PM-15, RA-5.\n\n**(3)** _DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT PLANS /_\n_EVIDENCE_\n\n**The organization:**\n\n**(a) Requires an independent agent satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined independence**\n**_criteria] to verify the correct implementation of the developer security assessment plan and_**\n**the evidence produced during security testing/evaluation; and**\n\n**(b) Ensures that the independent agent is either provided with sufficient information to complete**\n**the verification process or granted the authority to obtain such information.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Independent agents have the necessary qualifications (i.e., expertise,\nskills, training, and experience) to verify the correct implementation of developer security\nassessment plans.

Such code reviews are uniquely effective at\nidentifying weaknesses that require knowledge of the application’s requirements or context\nwhich are generally unavailable to more automated analytic tools and techniques such as\nstatic or dynamic analysis. Components benefiting from manual review include for example,\nverifying access control matrices against application controls and reviewing more detailed\naspects of cryptographic implementations and controls.\n\n**(5)** _DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | PENETRATION TESTING_\n\n**The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or**\n**information system service to perform penetration testing at [Assignment: organization-defined**\n**_breadth/depth] and with [Assignment: organization-defined constraints]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which assessors,\nusing all available information technology product and/or information system documentation\n(e.g., product/system design specifications, source code, and administrator/operator manuals)\nand working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent implemented security features\nof information technology products and information systems. Penetration testing can include,\nfor example, white, gray, or black box testing with analyses performed by skilled security\nprofessionals simulating adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to uncover\npotential vulnerabilities in information technology products and information systems resulting\nfrom implementation errors, configuration faults, or other operational deployment weaknesses\nor deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual\ncode reviews to provide greater levels of analysis than would ordinarily be possible.\n\n**(6)** _DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | ATTACK SURFACE REVIEWS_\n**The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or**\n**information system service to perform attack surface reviews.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Attack surfaces of information systems are exposed areas that make\nthose systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. This includes any accessible areas where\nweaknesses or deficiencies in information systems (including the hardware, software, and\nfirmware components) provide opportunities for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities. Attack\nsurface reviews ensure that developers: (i) analyze both design and implementation changes\nto information systems; and (ii) mitigate attack vectors generated as a result of the changes.\nCorrection of identified flaws includes, for example, deprecation of unsafe functions.\n\n**(7)** _DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | VERIFY SCOPE OF TESTING / EVALUATION_\n**The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or**\n**information system service to verify that the scope of security testing/evaluation provides**\n**complete coverage of required security controls at [Assignment: organization-defined depth of**\n**_testing/evaluation]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Verifying that security testing/evaluation provides complete coverage\nof required security controls can be accomplished by a variety of analytic techniques ranging\nfrom informal to formal. Each of these techniques provides an increasing level of assurance\ncorresponding to the degree of formality of the analysis. Rigorously demonstrating security\ncontrol coverage at the highest levels of assurance can be provided by the use of formal\nmodeling and analysis techniques including correlation between control implementation and\ncorresponding test cases.\n\n**(8)** _DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | DYNAMIC CODE ANALYSIS_\n**The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or**\n**information system service to employ dynamic code analysis tools to identify common flaws and**\n**document the results of the analysis.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Dynamic code analysis provides run-time verification of software\nprograms, using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption, user privilege\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nissues, and other potential security problems. Dynamic code analysis employs run-time tools\nto help to ensure that security functionality performs in the manner in which it was designed.\nA specialized type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by\ndeliberately introducing malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing\nstrategies derive from the intended use of applications and the functional and design\nspecifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and\nhence the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage\nanalysis (checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent\nof subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test\nsuite) and/or concordance analysis (checking for words that are out of place in software code\nsuch as non-English language words or derogatory terms).\n\nReferences: ISO/IEC 15408; NIST Special Publication 800-53A;\nWeb: [http://nvd.nist.gov,](http://nvd.nist.gov/) [http://cwe.mitre.org,](http://cwe.mitre.org/) [http://cve.mitre.org, http://capec.mitre.org.](http://cve.mitre.org/)\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP1 **LOW  Not Selected** **MOD  SA-11** **HIGH  SA-11**\n\n**SA-12** **SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION**\n\nControl: The organization protects against supply chain threats to the information system, system\ncomponent, or information system service by employing [Assignment: organization-defined\n_security safeguards] as part of a comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information security strategy._\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information systems (including system components that compose those\nsystems) need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design,\ndevelopment, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations,\nmaintenance, and retirement). Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished\nthrough threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at\neach phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to\nrespond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply\nchain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the\nacquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the\nacquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security\nsafeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply\nchain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking\ndelivery of such systems/components. This control also applies to information system services.\nSecurity safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems,\ndevelopment facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development\npersonnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing.

Organizations use available all-source intelligence analysis to inform the tailoring of\nacquisition strategies, tools, and methods. There are a number of different tools and\ntechniques available (e.g., obscuring the end use of an information system or system\n\n|P1|LOW Not Selected|MOD SA-11|HIGH SA-11|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\ncomponent, using blind or filtered buys). Organizations also consider creating incentives for\nsuppliers who: (i) implement required security safeguards; (ii) promote transparency into their\norganizational processes and security practices; (iii) provide additional vetting of the\nprocesses and security practices of subordinate suppliers, critical information system\ncomponents, and services; (iv) restrict purchases from specific suppliers or countries; and (v)\nprovide contract language regarding the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components. In\naddition, organizations consider minimizing the time between purchase decisions and required\ndelivery to limit opportunities for adversaries to corrupt information system components or\nproducts. Finally, organizations can use trusted/controlled distribution, delivery, and\nwarehousing options to reduce supply chain risk (e.g., requiring tamper-evident packaging of\ninformation system components during shipping and warehousing).

These reviews provide organizations with increased levels of visibility\ninto supplier activities during the system development life cycle to promote more effective\nsupply chain risk management. Supplier reviews can also help to determine whether primary\nsuppliers have security safeguards in place and a practice for vetting subordinate suppliers, for\nexample, second- and third-tier suppliers, and any subcontractors.\n\n**(3)** _SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | TRUSTED SHIPPING AND WAREHOUSING_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-12 (1)].\n\n**(4)** _SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | DIVERSITY OF SUPPLIERS_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-12 (13)].\n\n**(5)** _SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | LIMITATION OF HARM_\n\n**The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to limit harm**\n**from potential adversaries identifying and targeting the organizational supply chain.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Supply chain risk is part of the advanced persistent threat (APT).\nSecurity safeguards and countermeasures to reduce the probability of adversaries successfully\nidentifying and targeting the supply chain include, for example: (i) avoiding the purchase of\ncustom configurations to reduce the risk of acquiring information systems, components, or\nproducts that have been corrupted via supply chain actions targeted at specific organizations;\n(ii) employing a diverse set of suppliers to limit the potential harm from any given supplier in\nthe supply chain; (iii) employing approved vendor lists with standing reputations in industry,\nand (iv) using procurement carve outs (i.e., exclusions to commitments or obligations).\n\n**(6)** _SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | MINIMIZING PROCUREMENT TIME_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-12 (1)].\n\n**(7)** _SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ASSESSMENTS PRIOR TO SELECTION / ACCEPTANCE / UPDATE_\n\n**The organization conducts an assessment of the information system, system component, or**\n**information system service prior to selection, acceptance, or update.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Assessments include, for example, testing, evaluations, reviews, and\nanalyses. Independent, third-party entities or organizational personnel conduct assessments of\nsystems, components, products, tools, and services. Organizations conduct assessments to\nuncover unintentional vulnerabilities and intentional vulnerabilities including, for example,\nmalicious code, malicious processes, defective software, and counterfeits. Assessments can\ninclude, for example, static analyses, dynamic analyses, simulations, white, gray, and black\nbox testing, fuzz testing, penetration testing, and ensuring that components or services are\ngenuine (e.g., using tags, cryptographic hash verifications, or digital signatures). Evidence\ngenerated during security assessments is documented for follow-on actions carried out by\norganizations.

All-source intelligence\nconsists of intelligence products and/or organizations and activities that incorporate all\nsources of information, most frequently including human intelligence, imagery intelligence,\nmeasurement and signature intelligence, signals intelligence, and open source data in the\nproduction of finished intelligence. Where available, such information is used to analyze the\nrisk of both intentional and unintentional vulnerabilities from development, manufacturing,\nand delivery processes, people, and the environment. This review is performed on suppliers at\nmultiple tiers in the supply chain sufficient to manage risks.

This control enhancement\nexpands the scope of OPSEC to include suppliers and potential suppliers. OPSEC is a process\nof identifying critical information and subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to\noperations and other activities to: (i) identify those actions that can be observed by potential\nadversaries; (ii) determine indicators that adversaries might obtain that could be interpreted or\npieced together to derive critical information in sufficient time to cause harm to organizations;\n(iii) implement safeguards or countermeasures to eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level,\nexploitable vulnerabilities; and (iv) consider how aggregated information may compromise\nthe confidentiality of users or uses of the supply chain. OPSEC may require organizations to\nwithhold critical mission/business information from suppliers and may include the use of\nintermediaries to hide the end use, or users, of information systems, system components, or\ninformation system services.\n\n**(10)** _SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | VALIDATE AS GENUINE AND NOT ALTERED_\n\n**The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to validate that**\n**the information system or system component received is genuine and has not been altered.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: For some information system components, especially hardware, there\nare technical means to help determine if the components are genuine or have been altered.\nSecurity safeguards used to validate the authenticity of information systems and information\nsystem components include, for example, optical/nanotechnology tagging and side-channel\nanalysis. For hardware, detailed bill of material information can highlight the elements with\nembedded logic complete with component and production location.\n\n**(11)** _SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PENETRATION TESTING / ANALYSIS OF ELEMENTS, PROCESSES, AND ACTORS_\n\n**The organization employs [Selection (one or more): organizational analysis, independent third-**\n**_party analysis, organizational penetration testing, independent third-party penetration testing] of_**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and actors] associated with**\n**the information system, system component, or information system service.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses analysis and/or testing of the\nsupply chain, not just delivered items. Supply chain elements are information technology\nproducts or product components that contain programmable logic and that are critically\nimportant to information system functions. Supply chain processes include, for example: (i)\nhardware, software, and firmware development processes; (ii) shipping/handling procedures;\n(iii) personnel and physical security programs; (iv) configuration management tools/measures\nto maintain provenance; or (v) any other programs, processes, or procedures associated with\nthe production/distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain actors are individuals with\nspecific roles and responsibilities in the supply chain.

Early notification of supply chain\ncompromises that can potentially adversely affect or have adversely affected organizational\ninformation systems, including critical system components, is essential for organizations to\nprovide appropriate responses to such incidents.\n\n**(13)** _SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS_\n\n**The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure an**\n**adequate supply of [Assignment: organization-defined critical information system components].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Adversaries can attempt to impede organizational operations by\ndisrupting the supply of critical information system components or corrupting supplier\noperations. Safeguards to ensure adequate supplies of critical information system components\ninclude, for example: (i) the use of multiple suppliers throughout the supply chain for the\nidentified critical components; and (ii) stockpiling of spare components to ensure operation\nduring mission-critical times.\n\n**(14)** _SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | IDENTITY AND TRACEABILITY_\n\n**The organization establishes and retains unique identification of [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined supply chain elements, processes, and actors] for the information system, system_**\n**component, or information system service.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is\ncritical to gaining visibility into what is happening within such supply chains, as well as\nmonitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable visibility and\ntraceability into supply chains (i.e., elements, processes, and actors), it is very difficult for\norganizations to understand and therefore manage risk, and to reduce the likelihood of adverse\nevents. Uniquely identifying acquirer and integrator roles, organizations, personnel, mission\nand element processes, testing and evaluation procedures, delivery mechanisms, support\nmechanisms, communications/delivery paths, and disposal/final disposition activities as well\nas the components and tools used, establishes a foundational identity structure for assessment\nof supply chain activities. For example, labeling (using serial numbers) and tagging (using\nradio-frequency identification [RFID] tags) individual supply chain elements including\nsoftware packages, modules, and hardware devices, and processes associated with those\nelements can be used for this purpose. Identification methods are sufficient to support the\nprovenance in the event of a supply chain issue or adverse supply chain event.\n\n**(15)** _SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PROCESSES TO ADDRESS WEAKNESSES OR DEFICIENCIES_\n\n**The organization establishes a process to address weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain**\n**elements identified during independent or organizational assessments of such elements.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Evidence generated during independent or organizational assessments\nof supply chain elements (e.g., penetration testing, audits, verification/validation activities) is\ndocumented and used in follow-on processes implemented by organizations to respond to the\nrisks related to the identified weaknesses and deficiencies. Supply chain elements include, for\nexample, supplier development processes and supplier distribution systems.\n\nReferences: NIST Special Publication 800-161; NIST Interagency Report 7622.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\n|P1|LOW Not Selected|MOD Not Selected|HIGH SA-12|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**SA-13** **TRUSTWORTHINESS**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na. Describes the trustworthiness required in the [Assignment: organization-defined information\n_system, information system component, or information system service] supporting its critical_\nmissions/business functions; and\n\nb. Implements [Assignment: organization-defined assurance overlay] to achieve such\ntrustworthiness.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions\nwhen designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to conduct\ncritical organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property of\nan information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or\ntransmits. Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to\noperate within defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and\npurposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified environments of operation.\nTrustworthy systems are important to mission/business success. Two factors affecting the\ntrustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security\nfeatures, functions, and/or mechanisms employed within the system and its environment of\noperation); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security\nfunctionality is effective in its application). Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers\nof organizational information systems can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness),\nfor example, by employing well-defined security policy models, structured and rigorous hardware,\nsoftware, and firmware development techniques, sound system/security engineering principles,\nand secure configuration settings (defined by a set of assurance-related security controls in\nAppendix E).\n\nAssurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development\nlife cycle. Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the\nassociated assurance requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table E4 in Appendix E (designated as optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance\nsolutions for specific information systems and system components using the concept of overlays\ndescribed in Appendix I. Organizations select assurance overlays that have been developed,\nvalidated, and approved for community adoption (e.g., cross-organization, governmentwide),\nlimiting the development of such overlays on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations\ncan conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information systems,\nsystem components, or information system services that require high-assurance solutions.\nTrustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security plans for\norganizational information systems.

Information system engineers can\nconduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of an information system to identify missioncritical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of\ncore organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to\nperform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that\nimplement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within\nand beyond the information system boundary. Information system components that allow for\nunmediated access to critical components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent\nvulnerabilities such components create. Criticality is assessed in terms of the impact of the\nfunction or component failure on the ability of the component to complete the organizational\nmissions supported by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed whenever an\narchitecture or design is being developed or modified, including upgrades.

Metrics may include quality gates which are collections\nof completion criteria or sufficiency standards representing the satisfactory execution of\nparticular phases of the system development project. A quality gate, for example, may require\nthe elimination of all compiler warnings or an explicit determination that the warnings have\nno impact on the effectiveness of required security capabilities. During the execution phases\nof development projects, quality gates provide clear, unambiguous indications of progress.\nOther metrics apply to the entire development project.

Re-implementation\nor custom development of such components helps to satisfy requirements for higher assurance.\nThis is accomplished by initiating changes to system components (including hardware, software,\nand firmware) such that the standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations\nwhere no alternative sourcing is available and organizations choose not to re-implement or custom\ndevelop critical information system components, additional safeguards can be employed (e.g.,\nenhanced auditing, restrictions on source code and system utility access, and protection from\ndeletion of system and application files.

To ensure that\norganizations have such capability, this publication provides a set of security controls in the System\nand Services Acquisition family (i.e., SA family) addressing requirements for the development of\ninformation systems, information technology products, and information system services. Therefore,\nmany of the controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those systems, components, and\nservices. It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of the security controls in the\nSA family includes all system/component/service development and the developers associated with\nsuch development whether the development is conducted by internal organizational personnel or by\nexternal developers through the contracting/acquisition process. Affected controls include SA-8,\nSA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**FAMILY: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION**\n\n**SC-1** **SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na.

Security program policies and procedures at the organization\nlevel may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can\nbe included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can\nbe represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The\nprocedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information\nsystems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing\npolicy and procedures.

The separation of user functionality from information\nsystem management functionality is either physical or logical. Organizations implement separation\nof system management-related functionality from user functionality by using different computers,\ndifferent central processing units, different instances of operating systems, different network\naddresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of these or other methods, as appropriate.\nThis type of separation includes, for example, web administrative interfaces that use separate\nauthentication methods for users of any other information system resources. Separation of system\nand user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and\nwith additional access controls.

Such\nrestrictions include, for example, not presenting administration options until users establish\nsessions with administrator privileges.

Such\nisolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that\nperform those security functions. Information systems implement code separation (i.e., separation\nof security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including, for example,\nthrough the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel\ncode, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to\nprotect the code on disk, and address space protections that protect executing code. Information\nsystems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by\nimplementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all of the code within the security\nfunction isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to\ninclude nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundary as an exception. Related controls: AC3, AC-6, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-13, SC-2, SC-7, SC-39.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | HARDWARE SEPARATION_\n**The information system utilizes underlying hardware separation mechanisms to implement**\n**security function isolation.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Underlying hardware separation mechanisms include, for example,\nhardware ring architectures, commonly implemented within microprocessors, and hardwareenforced address segmentation used to support logically distinct storage objects with separate\nattributes (i.e., readable, writeable).\n\n**(2)** _SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | ACCESS / FLOW CONTROL FUNCTIONS_\n\n**The information system isolates security functions enforcing access and information flow control**\n**from nonsecurity functions and from other security functions.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Security function isolation occurs as a result of implementation; the\nfunctions can still be scanned and monitored. Security functions that are potentially isolated\nfrom access and flow control enforcement functions include, for example, auditing, intrusion\ndetection, and anti-virus functions.\n\n**(3)** _SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MINIMIZE NONSECURITY FUNCTIONALITY_\n\n**The organization minimizes the number of nonsecurity functions included within the isolation**\n**boundary containing security functions.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: In those instances where it is not feasible to achieve strict isolation of\nnonsecurity functions from security functions, it is necessary to take actions to minimize the\nnonsecurity-relevant functions within the security function boundary. Nonsecurity functions\n\n|P1|LOW Not Selected|MOD SC-2|HIGH SC-2|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\ncontained within the isolation boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or\nmaliciousness in such software, by virtue of being within the boundary, can impact the\nsecurity functions of organizational information systems. The design objective is that the\nspecific portions of information systems providing information security are of minimal\nsize/complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity functions in the security-relevant\ncomponents of information systems allows designers and implementers to focus only on those\nfunctions which are necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically access\nenforcement). By minimizing nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundaries, the\namount of code that must be trusted to enforce security policies is reduced, thus contributing\nto understandability.\n\n**(4)** _SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MODULE COUPLING AND COHESIVENESS_\n\n**The organization implements security functions as largely independent modules that maximize**\n**internal cohesiveness within modules and minimize coupling between modules.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The reduction in inter-module interactions helps to constrain security\nfunctions and to manage complexity. The concepts of coupling and cohesion are important\nwith respect to modularity in software design. Coupling refers to the dependencies that one\nmodule has on other modules. Cohesion refers to the relationship between the different\nfunctions within a particular module. Good software engineering practices rely on modular\ndecomposition, layering, and minimization to reduce and manage complexity, thus producing\nsoftware modules that are highly cohesive and loosely coupled.\n\n**(5)** _SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | LAYERED STRUCTURES_\n\n**The organization implements security functions as a layered structure minimizing interactions**\n**between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or**\n**correctness of higher layers.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The implementation of layered structures with minimized interactions\namong security functions and non-looping layers (i.e., lower-layer functions do not depend on\nhigher-layer functions) further enables the isolation of security functions and management of\ncomplexity.\n\nReferences: None.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP1 **LOW  Not Selected** **MOD  Not Selected** **HIGH  SC-3**\n\n**SC-4** **INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES**\n\nControl: The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information transfer via\nshared system resources.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control prevents information, including encrypted representations of\ninformation, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on\nbehalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes)\nthat obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those\nresources have been released back to information systems. The control of information in shared\nresources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. This\ncontrol does not address: (i) information remanence which refers to residual representation of data\nthat has been nominally erased or removed; (ii) covert channels (including storage and/or timing\nchannels) where shared resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or (iii)\ncomponents within information systems for which there are only single users/roles.

For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain\ntypes of packets to protect information system components on internal organizational networks\nfrom being directly affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and\nbandwidth combined with service redundancy may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of\nservice attacks. Related controls: SC-6, SC-7.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | RESTRICT INTERNAL USERS_\n\n**The information system restricts the ability of individuals to launch [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined denial of service attacks] against other information systems._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial of service attacks\nrequires that the mechanisms used for such attacks are unavailable. Individuals of concern can\ninclude, for example, hostile insiders or external adversaries that have successfully breached\nthe information system and are using the system as a platform to launch cyber attacks on third\nparties. Organizations can restrict the ability of individuals to connect and transmit arbitrary\ninformation on the transport medium (i.e., network, wireless spectrum). Organizations can\nalso limit the ability of individuals to use excessive information system resources. Protection\nagainst individuals having the ability to launch denial of service attacks may be implemented\non specific information systems or on boundary devices prohibiting egress to potential target\nsystems.\n\n**(2)** _DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | EXCESS CAPACITY / BANDWIDTH / REDUNDANCY_\n**The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the**\n**effects of information flooding denial of service attacks.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available\nto counter flooding attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example, establishing\nselected usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning.\n\n**(3)** _DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | DETECTION / MONITORING_\n\n**The organization:**\n\n**(a) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined monitoring tools] to detect indicators of denial of**\n**service attacks against the information system; and**\n\n|P1|LOW Not Selected|MOD SC-4|HIGH SC-4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**(b) Monitors [Assignment: organization-defined information system resources] to determine if**\n**sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial of service attacks.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations consider utilization and capacity of information system\nresources when managing risk from denial of service due to malicious attacks. Denial of\nservice attacks can originate from external or internal sources. Information system resources\nsensitive to denial of service include, for example, physical disk storage, memory, and CPU\ncycles. Common safeguards to prevent denial of service attacks related to storage utilization\nand capacity include, for example, instituting disk quotas, configuring information systems to\nautomatically alert administrators when specific storage capacity thresholds are reached, using\nfile compression technologies to maximize available storage space, and imposing separate\npartitions for system and user data.

Subnetworks that are physically or logically\nseparated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs.

The Trusted\nInternet Connection (TIC) initiative is an example of limiting the number of external network\nconnections.\n\n**(4)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | EXTERNAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES_\n**The organization:**\n\n**(a) Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;**\n\n**(b) Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;**\n\n**(c) Protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each**\n**interface;**\n\n**(d) Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need**\n**and duration of that need; and**\n\n**(e) Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]**\n**and removes exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission/business need.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Related control: SC-8.\n\n**(5)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DENY BY DEFAULT / ALLOW BY EXCEPTION_\n\n**The information system at managed interfaces denies network communications traffic by default**\n**and allows network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to both inbound and outbound\nnetwork communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications\ntraffic policy ensures that only those connections which are essential and approved are\nallowed.\n\n**(6)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESPONSE TO RECOGNIZED FAILURES_\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-7 (18)].\n\n**(7)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT SPLIT TUNNELING FOR REMOTE DEVICES_\n**The information system, in conjunction with a remote device, prevents the device from**\n**simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with the system and communicating via**\n**some other connection to resources in external networks.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is implemented within remote devices (e.g.,\nnotebook computers) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those devices,\nand by preventing those configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This\ncontrol enhancement is implemented within the information system by the detection of split\ntunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by\nprohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. Split tunneling might\nbe desirable by remote users to communicate with local information system resources such as\nprinters/file servers. However, split tunneling would in effect allow unauthorized external\nconnections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\ninformation. The use of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately provisioned with\nappropriate security controls, may provide the organization with sufficient assurance that it\ncan effectively treat such connections as non-remote connections from the confidentiality and\nintegrity perspective. VPNs thus provide a means for allowing non-remote communications\npaths from remote devices. The use of an adequately provisioned VPN does not eliminate the\nneed for preventing split tunneling.\n\n**(8)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ROUTE TRAFFIC TO AUTHENTICATED PROXY SERVERS_\n\n**The information system routes [Assignment: organization-defined internal communications traffic]**\n**to** **[Assignment: organization-defined external networks] through authenticated proxy servers at**\n**managed interfaces.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A\nproxy server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as an intermediary\nfor clients requesting information system resources (e.g., files, connections, web pages, or\nservices) from other organizational servers. Client requests established through an initial\nconnection to the proxy server are evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional\nprotection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most\ncommon proxy servers providing access to the Internet. Proxy servers support logging\nindividual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions and blocking specific Uniform\nResource Locators (URLs), domain names, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Web proxies\ncan be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites.\nRelated controls: AC-3, AU-2.\n\n**(9)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT THREATENING OUTGOING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC_\n**The information system:**\n\n**(a) Detects and denies outgoing communications traffic posing a threat to external information**\n**systems; and**\n\n**(b) Audits the identity of internal users associated with denied communications.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Detecting outgoing communications traffic from internal actions that\nmay pose threats to external information systems is sometimes termed extrusion detection.\nExtrusion detection at information system boundaries as part of managed interfaces includes\nthe analysis of incoming and outgoing communications traffic searching for indications of\ninternal threats to the security of external systems. Such threats include, for example, traffic\nindicative of denial of service attacks and traffic containing malicious code. Related controls:\nAU-2, AU-6, SC-38, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4.\n\n**(10)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED EXFILTRATION_\n\n**The organization prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Safeguards implemented by organizations to prevent unauthorized\nexfiltration of information from information systems include, for example: (i) strict adherence\nto protocol formats; (ii) monitoring for beaconing from information systems; (iii) monitoring\nfor steganography; (iv) disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly\nneeded; (v) disassembling and reassembling packet headers; and (vi) employing traffic profile\nanalysis to detect deviations from the volume/types of traffic expected within organizations or\ncall backs to command and control centers. Devices enforcing strict adherence to protocol\nformats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These\ndevices verify adherence to protocol formats and specification at the application layer and\nserve to identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or\ntransport layers. This control enhancement is closely associated with cross-domain solutions\nand system guards enforcing information flow requirements. Related control: SI-3.\n\n**(11)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT INCOMING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC_\n\n**The information system only allows incoming communications from [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined authorized sources] to be routed to [Assignment: organization-defined authorized_**\n**_destinations]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement provides determinations that source and\ndestination address pairs represent authorized/allowed communications. Such determinations\ncan be based on several factors including, for example, the presence of source/destination\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\naddress pairs in lists of authorized/allowed communications, the absence of address pairs in\nlists of unauthorized/disallowed pairs, or meeting more general rules for authorized/allowed\nsource/destination pairs. Related control: AC-3.\n\n**(12)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | HOST-BASED PROTECTION_\n\n**The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based boundary protection**\n**_mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Host-based boundary protection mechanisms include, for example,\nhost-based firewalls. Information system components employing host-based boundary\nprotection mechanisms include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices.\n\n**(13)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ISOLATION OF SECURITY TOOLS / MECHANISMS / SUPPORT COMPONENTS_\n\n**The organization isolates [Assignment: organization-defined information security tools,**\n**_mechanisms, and support components] from other internal information system components by_**\n**implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of**\n**the system.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful,\nfor example, in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing\nnetworks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques of\norganizations. Related controls: SA-8, SC-2, SC-3.\n\n**(14)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PROTECTS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS_\n\n**The organization protects against unauthorized physical connections at [Assignment:**\n**_organization-defined managed interfaces]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information systems operating at different security categories or\nclassification levels may share common physical and environmental controls, since the\nsystems may share space within organizational facilities. In practice, it is possible that these\nseparate information systems may share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable\ndistribution paths. Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for\nexample, by employing clearly identified and physically separated cable trays, connection\nframes, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with physical access controls\nenforcing limited authorized access to these items. Related controls: PE-4, PE-19.\n\n**(15)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ROUTE PRIVILEGED NETWORK ACCESSES_\n\n**The information system routes all networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed**\n**interface for purposes of access control and auditing.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AU-2, SI-4.\n\n**(16)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT DISCOVERY OF COMPONENTS / DEVICES_\n\n**The information system prevents discovery of specific system components composing a managed**\n**interface.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement protects network addresses of information\nsystem components that are part of managed interfaces from discovery through common tools\nand techniques used to identify devices on networks. Network addresses are not available for\ndiscovery (e.g., network address not published or entered in domain name systems), requiring\nprior knowledge for access. Another obfuscation technique is to periodically change network\naddresses.\n\n**(17)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT OF PROTOCOL FORMATS_\n\n**The information system enforces adherence to protocol formats.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information system components that enforce protocol formats include,\nfor example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. Such system components\nverify adherence to protocol formats/specifications (e.g., IEEE) at the application layer and\nidentify significant vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network\nor transport layers. Related control: SC-4.\n\n**(18)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | FAIL SECURE_\n\n**The information system fails securely in the event of an operational failure of a boundary**\n**protection device.**\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Fail secure is a condition achieved by employing information system\nmechanisms to ensure that in the event of operational failures of boundary protection devices\nat managed interfaces (e.g., routers, firewalls, guards, and application gateways residing on\nprotected subnetworks commonly referred to as demilitarized zones), information systems do\nnot enter into unsecure states where intended security properties no longer hold. Failures of\nboundary protection devices cannot lead to, or cause information external to the devices to\nenter the devices, nor can failures permit unauthorized information releases. Related controls:\nCP-2, SC-24.\n\n**(19)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | BLOCKS COMMUNICATION FROM NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY CONFIGURED HOSTS_\n\n**The information system blocks both inbound and outbound communications traffic between**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined communication clients] that are independently configured by**\n**end users and external service providers.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Communication clients independently configured by end users and\nexternal service providers include, for example, instant messaging clients. Traffic blocking\ndoes not apply to communication clients that are configured by organizations to perform\nauthorized functions.\n\n**(20)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DYNAMIC ISOLATION / SEGREGATION_\n\n**The information system provides the capability to dynamically isolate/segregate [Assignment:**\n**_organization-defined information system components] from other components of the system._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The capability to dynamically isolate or segregate certain internal\ncomponents of organizational information systems is useful when it is necessary to partition\nor separate certain components of dubious origin from those components possessing greater\ntrustworthiness. Component isolation reduces the attack surface of organizational information\nsystems. Isolation of selected information system components is also a means of limiting the\ndamage from successful cyber attacks when those attacks occur.\n\n**(21)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ISOLATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS_\n\n**The organization employs boundary protection mechanisms to separate [Assignment:**\n**_organization-defined information system components] supporting [Assignment: organization-_**\n**_defined missions and/or business functions]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations can isolate information system components performing\ndifferent missions and/or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized information\nflows among system components and also provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of\nprotection for selected components. Separating system components with boundary protection\nmechanisms provides the capability for increased protection of individual components and to\nmore effectively control information flows between those components. This type of enhanced\nprotection limits the potential harm from cyber attacks and errors. The degree of separation\nprovided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms\ninclude, for example, routers, gateways, and firewalls separating system components into\nphysically separate networks or subnetworks, cross-domain devices separating subnetworks,\nvirtualization techniques, and encrypting information flows among system components using\ndistinct encryption keys. Related controls: CA-9, SC-3.\n\n**(22)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | SEPARATE SUBNETS FOR CONNECTING TO DIFFERENT SECURITY DOMAINS_\n\n**The information system implements separate network addresses (i.e., different subnets) to connect**\n**to systems in different security domains.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Decomposition of information systems into subnets helps to provide\nthe appropriate level of protection for network connections to different security domains\ncontaining information with different security categories or classification levels.\n\n**(23)** _BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DISABLE SENDER FEEDBACK ON PROTOCOL VALIDATION FAILURE_\n\n**The information system disables feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Disabling feedback to senders when there is a failure in protocol\nvalidation format prevents adversaries from obtaining information which would otherwise be\nunavailable.\n\nReferences: FIPS Publication 199; NIST Special Publications 800-41, 800-77.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP1 **LOW  SC-7** **MOD  SC-7 (3) (4) (5) (7)** **HIGH  SC-7 (3) (4) (5) (7) (8) (18) (21)**\n\n**SC-8** **TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY**\n\nControl: The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of\ntransmitted information.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control applies to both internal and external networks and all types of\ninformation system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile\ndevices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines). Communication\npaths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of\ninterception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of organizational\ninformation can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., by employing protected distribution\nsystems) or by logical means (e.g., employing encryption techniques). Organizations relying on\ncommercial providers offering transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully\ndedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual customer needs),\nmay find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed\nsecurity controls for transmission confidentiality/integrity. In such situations, organizations\ndetermine what types of confidentiality/integrity services are available in standard, commercial\ntelecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary\nsecurity controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles,\norganizations implement appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accept the\nadditional risk.

Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect\ninformation integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which have common\napplication in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. Alternative\nphysical security safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems.

These\nunauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the\ninformation. Related control: AU-10.\n\n**(3)** _TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION FOR MESSAGE EXTERNALS_\n\n**The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect message externals**\n**unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical safeguards].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses protection against unauthorized\ndisclosure of information. Message externals include, for example, message headers/routing\ninformation. This control enhancement prevents the exploitation of message externals and\napplies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who\nare not authorized users. Header/routing information is sometimes transmitted unencrypted\nbecause the information is not properly identified by organizations as having significant value\n\n|P1|LOW SC-7|MOD SC-7 (3) (4) (5) (7)|HIGH SC-7 (3) (4) (5) (7) (8) (18) (21)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nor because encrypting the information can result in lower network performance and/or higher\ncosts.

Communication patterns include, for example, frequency, periods,\namount, and predictability. Changes to communications patterns can reveal information\nhaving intelligence value especially when combined with other available information related\nto missions/business functions supported by organizational information systems. This control\nenhancement prevents the derivation of intelligence based on communications patterns and\napplies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who\nare not authorized users. Encrypting the links and transmitting in continuous, fixed/random\npatterns prevents the derivation of intelligence from the system communications patterns.\nAlternative physical safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems.

The mechanisms can be activated only by users or the\nsecurity functions of organizational information systems. User responses via trusted paths are\nprotected from modifications by or disclosure to untrusted applications.

Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity\nprotections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity\nprotection can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM)\ntechnologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including, for example,\nsecure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate protection of information at rest\ncannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest.\nRelated controls: AC-3, AC-6, CA-7, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, PE-3, SC-8, SC-13, SI-3, SI-7.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION_\n\n**The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized**\n**disclosure and modification of [Assignment: organization-defined information] on [Assignment:**\n**_organization-defined information system components]._**\n\n|P0|LOW Not Selected|MOD Not Selected|HIGH Not Selected|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n|P0|LOW Not Selected|MOD Not Selected|HIGH Not Selected|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect\nthe confidentiality and integrity of organizational information.

This control\nenhancement applies to significant concentrations of digital media in organizational areas\ndesignated for media storage and also to limited quantities of media generally associated with\ninformation system components in operational environments (e.g., portable storage devices,\nmobile devices). Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage\ndevices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or\nfields).

Changing virtual operating systems\nor applications, as opposed to changing actual operating systems/applications, provide virtual\nchanges that impede attacker success while reducing configuration management efforts.

For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations\nwith the ability to disguise information systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful\nattacks without the cost of having multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment/misdirection\ntechniques including, for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may sufficiently\nconfuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing\ntradecraft. Concealment/misdirection techniques may also provide organizations additional time to\nsuccessfully perform core missions and business functions. Because of the time and effort required\nto support concealment/misdirection techniques, it is anticipated that such techniques would be\nused by organizations on a very limited basis.

Such actions may\nimpede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations\nsupporting critical missions/business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to\nhesitate before initiating or continuing attacks. Misdirection techniques involving randomness\ninclude, for example, performing certain routine actions at different times of day, employing\ndifferent information technologies (e.g., browsers, search engines), using different suppliers,\nand rotating roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel.\n\n**(3)** _CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CHANGE PROCESSING / STORAGE LOCATIONS_\n\n**The organization changes the location of [Assignment: organization-defined processing and/or**\n**_storage] [Selection: [Assignment: organization-defined time frequency]; at random time intervals]]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Adversaries target critical organizational missions/business functions\nand the information resources supporting those missions and functions while at the same time,\ntrying to minimize exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and\ndeterministic nature of organizational information systems targeted by adversaries, make such\nsystems more susceptible to cyber attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful.\nChanging organizational processing and storage locations (sometimes referred to as moving\ntarget defense) addresses the advanced persistent threat (APT) using techniques such as\nvirtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This enables organizations to relocate\nthe information resources (i.e., processing and/or storage) supporting critical missions and\nbusiness functions. Changing locations of processing activities and/or storage sites introduces\nuncertainty into the targeting activities by adversaries. This uncertainty increases the work\nfactor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to organizational information systems\nmuch more difficult and time-consuming, and increases the chances that adversaries may\ninadvertently disclose aspects of tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational\nresources.\n\n|P0|LOW Not Selected|MOD Not Selected|HIGH Not Selected|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**(4)** _CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | MISLEADING INFORMATION_\n\n**The organization employs realistic, but misleading information in [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined information system components] with regard to its security state or posture._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement misleads potential adversaries regarding the\nnature and extent of security safeguards deployed by organizations. As a result, adversaries\nmay employ incorrect (and as a result ineffective) attack techniques. One way of misleading\nadversaries is for organizations to place misleading information regarding the specific security\ncontrols deployed in external information systems that are known to be accessed or targeted\nby adversaries. Another technique is the use of deception nets (e.g., honeynets, virtualized\nenvironments) that mimic actual aspects of organizational information systems but use, for\nexample, out-of-date software configurations.\n\n**(5)** _CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CONCEALMENT OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS_\n**The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to hide or conceal**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined information system components].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: By hiding, disguising, or otherwise concealing critical information\nsystem components, organizations may be able to decrease the probability that adversaries\ntarget and successfully compromise those assets.

The OPSEC process involves\nfive steps: (i) identification of critical information (e.g., the security categorization process); (ii)\nanalysis of threats; (iii) analysis of vulnerabilities; (iv) assessment of risks; and (v) the application\nof appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC safeguards are applied to both organizational information\nsystems and the environments in which those systems operate. OPSEC safeguards help to protect\nthe confidentiality of key information including, for example, limiting the sharing of information\nwith suppliers and potential suppliers of information system components, information technology\nproducts and services, and with other non-organizational elements and individuals. Information\ncritical to mission/business success includes, for example, user identities, element uses, suppliers,\nsupply chain processes, functional and security requirements, system design specifications, testing\nprotocols, and security control implementation details.

By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing configuration management\nprocesses, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and verified. Flaw remediation\nactions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether organizations\nfollow US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-defined\ntime periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of\nfactors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of\nthe update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw\nremediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree and\ntype of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and\nalso the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations\nmay determine that the testing of software and/or firmware updates is not necessary or practical,\nfor example, when implementing simple anti-virus signature updates.

Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE,\nUnicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography.\nMalicious code can be transported by different means including, for example, web accesses,\nelectronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code\ninsertions occur through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code\nprotection mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based\ntechnologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of\nmalicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity\ncontrols may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial\noff-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could\ninclude, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect\norganizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms\ncannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards\nincluding, for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted\nprocurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform\nfunctions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in response to the\ndetection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted.

Organizations can monitor\ninformation systems, for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other\nsystem aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring\nobjectives may guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is\nachieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion\nprevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring\nsoftware, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for\nexample, selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with\nsuch devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7\nand AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can\nalso be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information collected is\nbased on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to\nsupport such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper Text\nTransfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is\nan integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output\nfrom system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs.\nA network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g.,\nlocal area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating\nthrough an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be\neither wired or wireless.

Software applications typically follow well-defined\nprotocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between\nsoftware modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured\ndata interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attackersupplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then\nthe attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be\ninterpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that\nreceives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the\ndata incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from\nbeing unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and\ncorrect inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | MANUAL OVERRIDE CAPABILITY_\n\n**The information system:**\n\n**(a) Provides a manual override capability for input validation of [Assignment: organization-**\n**_defined inputs];_**\n\n**(b) Restricts the use of the manual override capability to only [Assignment: organization-defined**\n**_authorized individuals]; and_**\n\n**(c) Audits the use of the manual override capability.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Related controls: CM-3, CM-5.\n\n**(2)** _INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | REVIEW / RESOLUTION OF ERRORS_\n\n**The organization ensures that input validation errors are reviewed and resolved within**\n\n**[Assignment: organization-defined time period].**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Resolution of input validation errors includes, for example, correcting\nsystemic causes of errors and resubmitting transactions with corrected input.\n\n**(3)** _INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR_\n\n**The information system behaves in a predictable and documented manner that reflects**\n**organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: A common vulnerability in organizational information systems is\nunpredictable behavior when invalid inputs are received. This control enhancement ensures\nthat there is predictable behavior in the face of invalid inputs by specifying information\nsystem responses that facilitate transitioning the system to known states without adverse,\nunintended side effects.\n\n**(4)** _INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | REVIEW / TIMING INTERACTIONS_\n\n**The organization accounts for timing interactions among information system components in**\n**determining appropriate responses for invalid inputs.**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: In addressing invalid information system inputs received across\nprotocol interfaces, timing interactions become relevant, where one protocol needs to consider\nthe impact of the error response on other protocols within the protocol stack. For example,\n802.11 standard wireless network protocols do not interact well with Transmission Control\nProtocols (TCP) when packets are dropped (which could be due to invalid packet input). TCP\nassumes packet losses are due to congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically\ndropped due to collisions or noise on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nprecisely the wrong action in response to a collision event. Adversaries may be able to use\napparently acceptable individual behaviors of the protocols in concert to achieve adverse\neffects through suitable construction of invalid input.\n\n**(5)** _INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | RESTRICT INPUTS TO TRUSTED SOURCES AND APPROVED FORMATS_\n\n**The organization restricts the use of information inputs to [Assignment: organization-defined**\n**_trusted sources] and/or [Assignment: organization-defined formats]._**\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies the concept of whitelisting to\ninformation inputs. Specifying known trusted sources for information inputs and acceptable\nformats for such inputs can reduce the probability of malicious activity.\n\nReferences: None.\n\nPriority and Baseline Allocation:\n\nP1 **LOW  Not Selected** **MOD  SI-10** **HIGH  SI-10**\n\n**SI-11** **ERROR HANDLING**\n\nControl: The information system:\n\na. Generates error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without\nrevealing information that could be exploited by adversaries; and\n\nb. Reveals error messages only to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages.\nThe extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided\nby organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by\nadversaries includes, for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as\nthe username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by)\ninformation recorded, and personal information such as account numbers, social security numbers,\nand credit card numbers. In addition, error messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting\ninformation.

Provides substitute information system components and a means to exchange active and\nstandby components at [Assignment: organization-defined MTTF substitution criteria].\n\nSupplemental Guidance: While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, this control addresses potential\nfailures of specific information system components that provide security capability. Failure rates\nreflect installation-specific consideration, not industry-average. Organizations define criteria for\nsubstitution of information system components based on MTTF value with consideration for\nresulting potential harm from component failures. Transfer of responsibilities between active and\nstandby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capability\n(e.g., preservation of state variables). Standby components remain available at all times except for\nmaintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.

By implementing the concept of\nnon-persistence for selected information system components, organizations can provide a known\nstate computing resource for a specific period of time that does not give adversaries sufficient time\non target to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational information systems and the environments in\nwhich those systems operate. Since the advanced persistent threat is a high-end threat with regard\nto capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period of time, a\npercentage of cyber attacks will be successful. Non-persistent information system components and\nservices are activated as required using protected information and terminated periodically or upon\nthe end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries in attempting to\ncompromise or breach organizational information systems.\n\nNon-persistent system components can be implemented, for example, by periodically re-imaging\ncomponents or by using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services\ncan be implemented using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances\nof processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent).The benefit of periodic\nrefreshes of information system components/services is that it does not require organizations to\nfirst determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that\nmay often be difficult for organizations to determine). The refresh of selected information system\ncomponents and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact\nof attacks, but not with such frequency that it makes the information system unstable. In some\ninstances, refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically in order to\nhinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities.

The information security program management (PM) controls described in this appendix are typically implemented at the organization level and not directed at individual organizational information systems. The program management controls have been designed to facilitate compliance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. The controls are independent of any FIPS Publication 200 impact levels and therefore, are not directly associated with any of the security control baselines described in Appendix D. The program management controls do, however, complement the security controls in Appendix F and focus on the programmatic, organization- wide information security requirements that are independent of any particular information system and are essential for managing information security programs. Tailoring guidance can be applied to the program management controls in a manner similar to how the guidance is applied to security controls in Appendix F. Organizations specify the individual or individuals responsible and accountable for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the program management controls. Organizations document program management controls in the information security program plan. The organization-wide information security program plan supplements the individual security plans developed for each organizational information system. Together, the security plans for the individual information systems and the information security program cover the totality of security controls employed by the organization.\n\n In addition to documenting the information security program management controls, the security program plan provides a vehicle for the organization, in a central repository, to document all security controls from Appendix F that have been designated as common controls (i.e., security controls inheritable by organizational information systems).[111] The information security program management controls and common controls contained in the information security program plan are implemented, assessed for effectiveness,[112] and authorized by a senior organizational official, with the same or similar authority and responsibility for managing risk as the authorization officials for information systems. Plans of action and milestones are developed and maintained for the program management and common controls that are deemed through assessment to be less than effective. Information security program management and common controls are also subject to the same continuous monitoring requirements as security controls employed in individual organizational information systems.\n\n Table G-1 provides a summary of the security controls in the program management family from Appendix G. Organizations can use the recommended priority code designation associated with each program management control to assist in making sequencing decisions for implementation\n\n111 Common controls are those security controls that are inheritable by one or more organizational information systems,\nand thus are separate and distinct from information security program management controls.\n\n112 Assessment procedures for program management controls and common controls can be found in NIST Special\nPublication 800-53A.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### (i.e., a Priority Code 1 [P1] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 2 [P2] control; and a Priority Code 2 [P2] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 3 [P3] control.\n\n**TABLE G-1: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONTROLS**\n\n**INITIAL CONTROL BASELINES**\n\n**CNTL**\n\n**NO.** **CONTROL NAME**\n\n**LOW** **MOD** **HIGH**\n\nPM-1 Information Security Program Plan P1\n\nPM-2 Senior Information Security Officer P1\n\nPM-3 Information Security Resources P1\n\nPM-4 Plan of Action and Milestones Process P1\n\nPM-5 Information System Inventory P1\n\n**Deployed organization-wide.**\n\nPM-6 Information Security Measures of P1 **Supporting information security program.**\nPerformance **Not associated with security control baselines.**\n\n**Independent of any system impact level.**\n\nPM-7 Enterprise Architecture P1\n\nPM-8 Critical Infrastructure Plan P1\n\nPM-9 Risk Management Strategy P1\n\nPM-10 Security Authorization Process P1\n\nPM-11 Mission/Business Process Definition P1\n\nPM-12 Insider Threat Program P1\n\nPM-13 Information Security Workforce P1\n\nPM-14 Testing, Training, and Monitoring P1\n\nPM-15 Contacts with Security Groups and P3\nAssociations\n\nPM-16 Threat Awareness Program P1\n\n|CNTL NO.|CONTROL NAME|PRIORITY|INITIAL CONTROL BASELINES|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||LOW|MOD|HIGH|\n|PM-1|Information Security Program Plan|P1|Deployed organization-wide.

The successful implementation of security controls\nfor organizational information systems depends on the successful implementation of organization-wide\nprogram management controls. However, the manner in which organizations implement the program\nmanagement controls depends on specific organizational characteristics including, for example, the size,\ncomplexity, and mission/business requirements of the respective organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PM-1** **INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM PLAN**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na. Develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program plan that:\n\n1. Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a description of\nthe security program management controls and common controls in place or planned for\nmeeting those requirements;\n\n2. Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management\ncommitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;\n\n3. Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the different aspects\nof information security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical); and\n\n4. Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being\nincurred to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and\nreputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;\n\nb. Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan [Assignment: organization_defined frequency];_\n\nc. Updates the plan to address organizational changes and problems identified during plan\nimplementation or security control assessments; and\n\nd. Protects the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure and\nmodification.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information security program plans can be represented in single documents\nor compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program\nmanagement controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security program\nplans provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common controls\n(including specification of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly\nor by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of\nthe plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.\n\nThe security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information\nsecurity program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed\nwithin the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s\ninformation security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for\nan information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system\nproviding organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational\ninformation systems). The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate\nwhich separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.\n\nOrganizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple\ndocuments. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are\nincluded as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security\nprogram plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the\norganizational official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment,\nauthorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization\nmay require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and\ncontinuously monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family\nwhen such controls are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support\nmultiple information systems.

Employs a business case/Exhibit 300/Exhibit 53 to record the resources required; and\n\nc. Ensures that information security resources are available for expenditure as planned.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations consider establishing champions for information security\nefforts and as part of including the necessary resources, assign specialized expertise and resources\nas needed.

Document the remedial information security actions to adequately respond to risk to\norganizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and\n\n3. Are reported in accordance with OMB FISMA reporting requirements.\n\nb. Reviews plans of action and milestones for consistency with the organizational risk\nmanagement strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the information\nsecurity program and is subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB. With the\nincreasing emphasis on organization-wide risk management across all three tiers in the risk\nmanagement hierarchy (i.e., organization, mission/business process, and information system),\norganizations view plans of action and milestones from an organizational perspective, prioritizing\nrisk response actions and ensuring consistency with the goals and objectives of the organization.\nPlan of action and milestones updates are based on findings from security control assessments and\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\ncontinuous monitoring activities.

The integration of information security requirements and\nassociated security controls into the organization’s enterprise architecture helps to ensure that\nsecurity considerations are addressed by organizations early in the system development life cycle\nand are directly and explicitly related to the organization’s mission/business processes. This\nprocess of security requirements integration also embeds into the enterprise architecture, an\nintegral information security architecture consistent with organizational risk management and\ninformation security strategies. For PM-7, the information security architecture is developed at a\nsystem-of-systems level (organization-wide), representing all of the organizational information\nsystems. For PL-8, the information security architecture is developed at a level representing an\nindividual information system but at the same time, is consistent with the information security\narchitecture defined for the organization. Security requirements and security control integration\nare most effectively accomplished through the application of the Risk Management Framework\nand supporting security standards and guidelines. The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology\nprovides guidance on integrating information security requirements and security controls into\nenterprise architectures.

Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage risk to organizational operations and assets,\nindividuals, other organizations, and the Nation associated with the operation and use of\ninformation systems;\n\nb. Implements the risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and\n\nc. Reviews and updates the risk management strategy [Assignment: organization-defined\n_frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes._\n\nSupplemental Guidance: An organization-wide risk management strategy includes, for example, an\nunambiguous expression of the risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable risk assessment\nmethodologies, risk mitigation strategies, a process for consistently evaluating risk across the\norganization with respect to the organization’s risk tolerance, and approaches for monitoring risk\nover time. The use of a risk executive function can facilitate consistent, organization-wide\napplication of the risk management strategy. The organization-wide risk management strategy can\nbe informed by risk-related inputs from other sources both internal and external to the organization\nto ensure the strategy is both broad-based and comprehensive.

Designates individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities within the organizational\nrisk management process; and\n\nc. Fully integrates the security authorization processes into an organization-wide risk\nmanagement program.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Security authorization processes for information systems and environments\nof operation require the implementation of an organization-wide risk management process, a Risk\nManagement Framework, and associated security standards and guidelines. Specific roles within\nthe risk management process include an organizational risk executive (function) and designated\nauthorizing officials for each organizational information system and common control provider.\nSecurity authorization processes are integrated with organizational continuous monitoring\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nprocesses to facilitate ongoing understanding and acceptance of risk to organizational operations\nand assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

Defines mission/business processes with consideration for information security and the\nresulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other\norganizations, and the Nation; and\n\nb. Determines information protection needs arising from the defined mission/business processes\nand revises the processes as necessary, until achievable protection needs are obtained.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Information protection needs are technology-independent, required\ncapabilities to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise\nof information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs\nare derived from the mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business\nprocesses selected to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy.\nInformation protection needs determine the required security controls for the organization and the\nassociated information systems supporting the mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an\norganization’s information protection needs is an understanding of the level of adverse impact that\ncould result if a compromise of information occurs. The security categorization process is used to\nmake such potential impact determinations.

The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified\nenvironments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of Controlled Unclassified\nInformation in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include security controls to\ndetect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of\nboth technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior\norganizational official is designated by the department/agency head as the responsible individual\nto implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and\nanalysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department/agency insider\nthreat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual\nemployee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness\ntraining to employees, receive access to information from all offices within the department/agency\n(e.g., human resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information technology,\ninformation system security, and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and conduct selfassessments of department/agency insider threat posture.\n\nInsider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams organizations may\nalready have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nrecords are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some\ntypes of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace (e.g.,\nongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues).\nThese precursors can better inform and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted\nmonitoring efforts. The participation of a legal team is important to ensure that all monitoring\nactivities are performed in accordance with appropriate legislation, directives, regulations,\npolicies, standards, and guidelines.

Such workforce programs can also include associated information security career paths\nto encourage: (i) information security professionals to advance in the field and fill positions with\ngreater responsibility; and (ii) organizations to fill information security-related positions with\nqualified personnel. Information security workforce development and improvement programs are\ncomplementary to organizational security awareness and training programs. Information security\nworkforce development and improvement programs focus on developing and institutionalizing\ncore information security capabilities of selected personnel needed to protect organizational\noperations, assets, and individuals.

Implements a process for ensuring that organizational plans for conducting security testing,\ntraining, and monitoring activities associated with organizational information systems:\n\n1. Are developed and maintained; and\n\n2. Continue to be executed in a timely manner;\n\nb. Reviews testing, training, and monitoring plans for consistency with the organizational risk\nmanagement strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control ensures that organizations provide oversight for the security\ntesting, training, and monitoring activities conducted organization-wide and that those activities\nare coordinated. With the importance of continuous monitoring programs, the implementation of\ninformation security across the three tiers of the risk management hierarchy, and the widespread\nuse of common controls, organizations coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring\nactivities that are routinely conducted as part of ongoing organizational assessments supporting a\nvariety of security controls. Security training activities, while typically focused on individual\ninformation systems and specific roles, also necessitate coordination across all organizational\nelements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and activities are informed by current threat and\nvulnerability assessments.

To facilitate ongoing security education and training for organizational personnel;\n\nb. To maintain currency with recommended security practices, techniques, and technologies; and\n\nc. To share current security-related information including threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Ongoing contact with security groups and associations is of paramount\nimportance in an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Security groups and\nassociations include, for example, special interest groups, forums, professional associations, news\ngroups, and/or peer groups of security professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select\ngroups and associations based on organizational missions/business functions. Organizations share\nthreat, vulnerability, and incident information consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive\nOrders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Related control: SI-5.\n\nControl Enhancements: None.\n\nReferences: None.\n\n**PM-16** **THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM**\n\nControl: The organization implements a threat awareness program that includes a crossorganization information-sharing capability.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of\nadversaries, especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it is becoming more likely that\nadversaries may successfully breach or compromise organizational information systems. One of\nthe best techniques to address this concern is for organizations to share threat information. This\ncan include, for example, sharing threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that\norganizations have experienced, mitigations that organizations have found are effective against\ncertain types of threats, threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that are\nlikely to occur). Threat information sharing may be bilateral (e.g., government-commercial\ncooperatives, government-government cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g., organizations taking\npart in threat-sharing consortia). Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring special\nagreements and protection, or less sensitive and freely shared.

NIST Special Publication 800-39 includes guidance on managing risk at the organizational level, mission/business process level, and information system level, is consistent with ISO/IEC 27001, and provides additional implementation detail for the federal government and its contractors. ISO/IEC 15408 (also known as the Common Criteria) provides functionality and assurance requirements for developers of information systems and information system components (i.e., information technology products). Since many of the technical security controls defined in Appendix F are implemented in hardware, software, and firmware components of information systems, organizations can obtain significant benefit from the acquisition and employment of information technology products evaluated against the requirements of ISO/IEC 15408. The use of such products can provide evidence that certain security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired effect in satisfying stated security requirements.\n\n Previously, the ISO/IEC 27001 mappings were created by relating the primary security topic identified in each of the Special Publication 800-53 base controls to a similar security topic in the ISO/IEC standard. This methodology resulted in a mapping of security control relationships rather than a mapping of equivalent security control requirements. The ISO/IEC 27001:2013 update provided an opportunity to reassess whether the implementation of a security control from Special Publication 800-53 satisfied the intent of the mapped control from ISO/IEC 27001 and conversely, whether the implementation of a security control from ISO/IEC 27001 satisfied the intent of the mapped control from Special Publication 800-53. To successfully meet the mapping criteria, the implementation of the mapped controls should result in an equivalent information security posture. However, this does not mean that security control equivalency based solely on the mapping tables herein should be assumed by organizations. While the revised security control mappings are more accurate, there is still some degree of subjectivity in the mapping analysis because the mappings are not always one-to-one and may not be completely equivalent. The following examples illustrate some of the mapping issues:\n\n • Example 1: Special Publication 800-53 contingency planning and ISO/IEC 27001 business continuity management were deemed to have similar, but not the same, functionality.\n\n • Example 2: In some cases, similar topics are addressed in the two security control sets but provide a different context, perspective, or scope. Special Publication 800-53 addresses\n\n113 ISO/IEC 27001 was published in October 2013 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n\n114 ISO/IEC 15408 was published in September 2012 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and\nthe International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n\nAPPENDIX H PAGE H-1\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### information flow control broadly in terms of approved authorizations for controlling access between source and destination objects, whereas ISO/IEC 27001 addresses information flow more narrowly as it applies to interconnected network domains.\n\n • Example 3: Security control A.6.1.1, Information Security Roles and Responsibilities, in ISO/IEC 27001 states that “all information security responsibilities shall be defined and allocated” while security control PM-10, Security Authorization Process, in Special Publication 800-53 that is mapped to A.6.1.1, has three distinct parts. The first part states that the organization “designates individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities…” If A.6.1.1 is mapped to PM-10 without providing any additional information, organizations might assume that if they implement A.6.1.1 (i.e., all responsibilities are defined and allocated), then the intent of PM-10 would also be fully satisfied. However, this would not be the case since the other two parts of PM-10 would not have been addressed. To resolve and clarify the security control mappings, when a security control in the right column of Tables H-1 and H-2 does not fully satisfy the intent of the security control in the left column of the tables, the control in the right column is designated with an asterisk (*). \n\n In a few cases, an ISO/IEC 27001 security control could only be directly mapped to a Special Publication 800-53 control enhancement. In such cases, the relevant enhancement is specified in Table H-2 indicating that the corresponding ISO/IEC 27001 control satisfies only the intent of the specified enhancement and does not address the associated base control from Special Publication 800-53 or any other enhancements under that base control. Where no enhancement is specified, the ISO/IEC 27001 control is relevant only to the Special Publication 800-53 base control.\n\n And finally, the security controls from ISO/IEC 27002 were not considered in the mapping analysis since the standard is informative rather than normative.\n\nAPPENDIX H PAGE H-2\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Table H-1 provides a mapping from the security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 to the security controls in ISO/IEC 27001.

requirements in ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria) to the security controls in Special Publication 800-53. The table represents an informal correspondence between security requirements and security controls (i.e., the table is not intended to determine whether the ISO/IEC 15408 security requirements are fully, partially, or not satisfied by the associated security controls). However, the table can serve as a beneficial starting point for further correspondence analysis. Organizations are cautioned that satisfying ISO/IEC 15408 security requirements for an particular evaluated and validated information technology product as represented by the presence of certain security controls from Appendix F, does not imply that such requirements have been satisfied throughout the entire information system (which may consist of multiple, integrated individual component products). Additional information explaining the specific mappings that appear in Table H-3 is available at the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) website at: http://www.niap-ccevs.org.\n\n**TABLE

CONDITIONS OR COMMUNITY-WIDE USE[116]\n\n###### rganizations may use the following template when developing tailored baselines using the concept of overlays.[117] The template is provided as an example only—organizations may choose to use other formats or modify the format in this appendix based on organizational\n\n### O\n\n###### needs and the type of overlay being developed. The level of detail included in the overlay is at the discretion of the organization initiating the overlay but should be of sufficient breadth and depth to provide an appropriate rationale and justification for the resulting tailored baseline developed, including any risk-based decisions made during the overlay development process. Security control baseline tailoring using the concept of overlays results in security plans that are subject to approval by authorizing officials. The example template consists of eight sections:\n\n • Identification;\n\n • Overlay Characteristics;\n\n • Applicability;\n\n • Overlay Summary;\n\n • Detailed Overlay Control Specifications;\n\n • Tailoring Considerations;\n\n • Definitions; and\n\n • Additional Information or Instructions.\n\n How Overlays Can Be Used\n\n Within the Risk Management Framework (RMF), overlays are implemented as part of the tailoring process after the completion of an initial security categorization process described in Section 3.1 and any organization-specific guidance. The security categorization process results in the determination of an impact level of the information system, and is subsequently used to select an initial set of security controls from one of the security control baselines in Appendix D.[118] After the initial set of security controls is identified, organizations initiate the tailoring process to modify and align the controls more closely with the specific conditions within the organizations. Overlays provide tailoring guidance from a community-wide perspective to address specialized requirements, missions/business functions, technologies, or environments of operation. Overlays provide uniformity and efficiency of security control selection by presenting tailoring options\n\n116 Tailored baselines produced using the concept of overlays can be published independently in a variety of venues and\npublications including, for example, OMB policies, CNSS Instructions, NIST Special Publications, industry standards,\nand sector-specific guidance. As part of the overlay initiative, the previous guidance in Appendix I regarding industrial\nand process control system security will be transferred to NIST Special Publication 800-82.\n\n117 While organizations are encouraged to use the overlay concept to tailor security control baselines, generating widely\ndivergent overlays on the same topic may prove to be counterproductive. The overlay concept is most effective when\ncommunities of interest work together to create consensus-based overlays that are not duplicative.\n\n118 CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security categorization guidance and security control baselines for national security\nsystems.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### developed by security experts and other subject matter experts to information system owners responsible for implementing and maintaining such systems.\n\n There is a considerable range of options that can be used to construct overlays, depending on the specificity desired by the overlay developers. Some overlays may be very specific with respect to the hardware, firmware, and software that form the key components the information system and the environment in which the system operates. Other overlays may be more abstract in order to be applicable to a large class of information systems that may be deployed in different environments. The example template described below can be used for any level of specificity on this continuum of potential options for overlays.\n\n Overlays that provide greater specificity are typically developed by organizations with authority over the information system owners and environments of operation. Organizations decide on the appropriate tailoring actions for the selected baseline security controls as described in Section 3.2. Many of the variables and conditions that qualify the overlay for use on a specific information system are made explicit to ensure consistency when applying the overlay. Overlays that provide less specificity can also be developed by security and subject matter experts for application to large classes of information systems or in situations where there is less than full knowledge about the specific implementation details related to the system. Less specific overlays may require additional tailoring to customize the set of security controls for the specific information system. These overlays leave many of the assignment and selection statements in the security controls (i.e., the variable portion of the controls) to be completed by the organization that owns and operates the information system. The eight sections comprising the overlay are described below.\n\n Identification\n\n Organizations identify the overlay by providing: (i) a unique name for the overlay; (ii) a version number and date; (iii) the version of NIST Special Publication 800-53 used to create the overlay; (iv) other documentation used to create the overlay; (v) author or authoring group and point of contact; and (vi) type of organizational approval received. Organizations define how long the overlay is to be in effect and any events that may trigger an update to the overlay other than changes to NIST Special Publication 800-53 or organization-specific security guidance. If there are no unique events that can trigger an update for the overlay, this section provides that notation.\n\n Overlay Characteristics\n\n Organizations describe the characteristics that define the intended use of the overlay in order to help potential users select the most appropriate overlay for their missions/business functions. This may include, for example, a description of: (i) the environment in which the information system will be used (e.g., inside a guarded building within the continental United States, in an unmanned space vehicle, while traveling for business to a foreign country that is known for attempting to gain access to sensitive or classified information, or in a mobile vehicle that is in close proximity to hostile entities); (ii) the type of information that will be processed, stored, or transmitted (e.g., personal identity and authentication information, financial management information, facilities, fleet, and equipment management information, defense and national security information, system development information); (iii) the functionality within the information system or the type of system (e.g., standalone system, industrial/process control system, or cross-domain system); and (iv) other characteristics related to the overlay that help protect organizational missions/business functions, information systems, information, or individuals from a specific set of threats that may not be addressed by the assumptions described in Chapter Three.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### Applicability\n\n Organizations provide criteria to assist potential users of the overlay in determining whether or not the overlay applies to a particular information system or environment of operation. Typical formats include, for example, a list of questions or a decision tree based on the description of the characteristics of the information system (including associated applications) and its environment of operation at the level of specificity appropriate to the overlay.\n\n Overlay Summary\n\n Organizations provide a brief summary of the salient characteristics of the overlay. This summary may include, for example: (i) the security controls and control enhancements that are affected by the overlay; (ii) an indication of which controls/enhancements are selected or not selected based on the characteristics and assumptions in the overlay, the tailoring guidance provided in Section 3.2, or any organization-specific guidance; (iii) the selected controls/enhancements including an overview of new supplemental guidance and parameter values; and (iv) references to applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations, policies, or standards. \n\n Detailed Overlay Control Specifications\n\n Organizations provide a comprehensive expression of the security controls/control enhancements in the overlay as part of the tailoring process. This may include, for example: (i) justification for selecting or not selecting a specific security control/control enhancement; (ii) modifications to the supplemental guidance or the addition of new supplemental guidance for the security controls and control enhancements to address the characteristics of the overlay and the environments in which the overlay is intended to operate; (iii) unique parameter values for security control selection or assignment statements; (iv) specific statutory and/or regulatory requirements (above and beyond FISMA) that are met by a security control or control enhancement; (v) recommendations for compensating controls, as appropriate; and (vi) guidance that extends the basic capability of the control/enhancement by specifying additional functionality, altering the strength of mechanism, or adding or limiting implementation options.\n\n Tailoring Considerations\n\n Organizations provide information to information system owners and authorizing officials to consider during the tailoring process when determining the set of security controls applicable to their specific information systems. This is especially important for overlays that are used in an environment of operation different from the one assumed by the security control baselines (as defined in Section 3.1). In addition, organizations can provide guidance on the use of multiple overlays applied to a security control baseline and address any potential conflicts that may arise between overlay specifications and baseline controls.\n\n Definitions\n\n Organizations provide any terms and associated definitions that are unique and relevant to the overlay. The terms and definitions are listed in alphabetical order. If there are no unique terms or definitions for the overlay, this is stated in this section.\n\n Additional Information or Instructions \n\n Organizations provide any additional information or instructions relevant to the overlay not covered in the previous sections.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### APPENDIX J\n\n PRIVACY CONTROL CATALOG\n\nPRIVACY CONTROLS, ENHANCEMENTS, AND SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE\n\n###### he need to protect an individual's privacy is as important today as it was in 1974 when the Privacy Act first sought to balance the government's need to collect information from an individual with a citizen's right to be notified as to how that information was being used,\n\n# T\n\n###### collected, maintained, and disposed of after the requisite period of use. These concerns are also shared in the private sector, where healthcare, financial, and other services continue to be delivered via the web with increasingly higher levels of personalization. The proliferation of social media, Smart Grid, mobile, and cloud computing, as well as the transition from structured to unstructured data and metadata environments, have added significant complexities and challenges for federal organizations in safeguarding privacy. These challenges extend well beyond the traditional information technology security view of protecting privacy which focused primarily on ensuring confidentiality. Now there are greater implications with respect to controlling the integrity of an individual's information, and with ensuring that an individual's information is available on demand. The challenging landscape requires federal organizations to expand their view of privacy, in order to meet citizen expectations of privacy that go beyond information security.\n\n Privacy, with respect to personally identifiable information (PII),[119] is a core value that can be obtained only with appropriate legislation, policies, procedures, and associated controls to ensure compliance with requirements. Protecting the privacy of individuals and their PII that is collected, used, maintained, shared, and disposed of by programs and information systems, is a fundamental responsibility of federal organizations. Privacy also involves each individual’s right to decide when and whether to share personal information, how much information to share, and the particular circumstances under which that information can be shared. In today’s digital world, effective privacy for individuals depends on the safeguards employed within the information systems that are processing, storing, and transmitting PII and the environments in which those systems operate. Organizations cannot have effective privacy without a basic foundation of information security. Privacy is more than security, however, and includes, for example, the principles of transparency, notice, and choice.\n\n This appendix provides a structured set of controls for protecting privacy and serves as a roadmap for organizations to use in identifying and implementing privacy controls concerning the entire life cycle of PII, whether in paper or electronic form. The controls focus on information privacy as a value distinct from, but highly interrelated with, information security. Privacy controls are\n\n119 OMB Memorandum 07-16 defines PII as information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s\nidentity such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc., alone, or when combined with other\npersonal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth,\nmother’s maiden name, etc. OMB Memorandum 10-22 further states that “the definition of PII is not anchored to any\nsingle category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an\nindividual can be identified by examining the context of use and combination of data elements. In performing this\nassessment, it is important for agencies to recognize that non-PII can become PII, whenever additional information is\nmade publicly available, in any medium and from any source that, when combined with other available information,\ncould be used to identify an individual.” NIST Special Publication 800-122 also includes a definition of PII that differs\nfrom this appendix because it was focused on the security objective of confidentiality and not privacy in the broad\nsense. Organizational definitions of PII may vary based on the consideration of additional regulatory requirements. The\nprivacy controls in this appendix apply regardless of the definition of PII by organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n###### the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within organizations to protect and ensure the proper handling of PII. [120] Organizations may also engage in activities that do not involve the collection and use of PII, but may nevertheless raise privacy concerns and associated risk. The privacy controls are equally applicable to those activities and can be used to analyze the privacy risk and mitigate such risk when necessary.\n\n The privacy controls in this appendix are based on the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs)[121] embodied in the Privacy Act of 1974, Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies. The FIPPs are designed to build public trust in the privacy practices of organizations and to help organizations avoid tangible costs and intangible damages from privacy incidents. There are eight privacy control families, each aligning with one of the FIPPs. The privacy families can be implemented at the organization, department, agency, component, office, program, or information system level, under the leadership and oversight of the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)[122] and in coordination with the Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Information Officer, program officials, legal counsel, and others as appropriate. Table J-1 provides a summary of the privacy controls by family in the privacy control catalog. \n\n**TABLE J-1: SUMMARY OF PRIVACY CONTROLS BY FAMILY**\n\n**ID** **PRIVACY CONTROLS**\n\n**AP** **Authority and Purpose**\n\nAP-1 Authority to Collect\n\nAP-2 Purpose Specification\n\n**AR** **Accountability, Audit, and Risk Management**\n\nAR-1 Governance and Privacy Program\n\nAR-2 Privacy Impact and Risk Assessment\n\nAR-3 Privacy Requirements for Contractors and Service Providers\n\nAR-4 Privacy Monitoring and Auditing\n\nAR-5 Privacy Awareness and Training\n\nAR-6 Privacy Reporting\n\nAR-7 Privacy-Enhanced System Design and Development\n\nAR-8 Accounting of Disclosures\n\n**DI** **Data Quality and Integrity**\n\nDI-1 Data Quality\n\nDI-2 Data Integrity and Data Integrity Board\n\n**DM** **Data Minimization and Retention**\n\nDM-1 Minimization of Personally Identifiable Information\n\nDM-2 Data Retention and Disposal\n\n120 In 2010, the Federal CIO Council Privacy Committee issued a framework for designing and implementing a privacy\nprogram entitled Best Practices: Elements of a Federal Privacy Program (Elements White Paper). The privacy controls\nin this appendix mirror a number of the elements included in the paper. Organizations can use the privacy controls and\nthe guidance in the paper to develop an organization-wide privacy program or enhance an already existing program.\n\n121 The FIPPs are widely accepted in the United States and internationally as a general framework for privacy and are\nreflected in other federal and international laws and policies. In a number of organizations, FIPPs serve as the basis for\nanalyzing privacy risks and determining appropriate mitigation strategies. The Federal Enterprise Architecture Security\nand Privacy Profile (FEA-SPP) also provided information and materials in development of the privacy controls.\n\n122 All federal agencies and departments designate an SAOP/CPO as the senior organizational official with the overall\norganization-wide responsibility for information privacy issues. OMB Memorandum 05-08 provides guidance for the\ndesignation of SAOPs/CPOs. The term SAOP/CPO as used in this appendix means an organization’s senior privacy\nleader, whose job title may vary from organization to organization.\n\n|Col1|TABLE J-1: SUMMARY OF PRIVACY CONTROLS BY FAMILY|\n|---|---|\n|ID|PRIVACY CONTROLS|\n|AP|Authority and Purpose|\n|AP-1|Authority to Collect|\n|AP-2|Purpose Specification|\n|AR|Accountability, Audit, and Risk Management|\n|AR-1|Governance and Privacy Program|\n|AR-2|Privacy Impact and Risk Assessment|\n|AR-3|Privacy Requirements for Contractors and Service Providers|\n|AR-4|Privacy Monitoring and Auditing|\n|AR-5|Privacy Awareness and Training|\n|AR-6|Privacy Reporting|\n|AR-7|Privacy-Enhanced System Design and Development|\n|AR-8|Accounting of Disclosures|\n|DI|Data Quality and Integrity|\n|DI-1|Data Quality|\n|DI-2|Data Integrity and Data Integrity Board|\n|DM|Data Minimization and Retention|\n|DM-1|Minimization of Personally Identifiable Information|\n|DM-2|Data Retention and Disposal|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**ID** **PRIVACY CONTROLS**\n\nDM-3 Minimization of PII Used in Testing, Training, and Research\n\n**IP** **Individual Participation and Redress**\n\nIP-1 Consent\n\nIP-2 Individual Access\n\nIP-3 Redress\n\nIP-4 Complaint Management\n\n**SE** **Security**\n\nSE-1 Inventory of Personally Identifiable Information\n\nSE-2 Privacy Incident Response\n\n**TR** **Transparency**\n\nTR-1 Privacy Notice\n\nTR-2 System of Records Notices and Privacy Act Statements\n\nTR-3 Dissemination of Privacy Program Information\n\n**UL** **Use Limitation**\n\nUL-1 Internal Use\n\nUL-2 Information Sharing with Third Parties\n\n###### There is a strong similarity between the structure of the privacy controls in this appendix and the structure of the security controls in Appendices F and G. For example, the control AR-1 (Governance and Privacy Program) requires organizations to develop privacy plans that can be implemented at the organizational or program level. These plans can also be used in conjunction with security plans to provide an opportunity for organizations to select the appropriate set of security and privacy controls in accordance with organizational mission/business requirements and the environments in which the organizations operate. Incorporating the fundamental concepts associated with managing information security risk helps to ensure that the employment of privacy controls is carried out in a cost-effective and risk-based manner while simultaneously meeting compliance requirements. Standardized privacy controls and assessment procedures (developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the controls) will provide a more disciplined and structured approach for satisfying federal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance with those requirements.\n\n In summary, the Privacy Appendix achieves several important objectives. The appendix:\n\n • Provides a structured set of privacy controls, based on best practices, that helps organizations comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations, policies, standards, guidance, and organization-specific issuances;\n\n • Establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of enforcing respective privacy and security requirements that may overlap in concept and in implementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations;\n\n • Demonstrates the applicability of the NIST Risk Management Framework in the selection, implementation, assessment, and ongoing monitoring of privacy controls deployed in federal information systems, programs, and organizations; and\n\n • Promotes closer cooperation between privacy and security officials within the federal government to help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives in enforcing the requirements in federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and guidance.\n\n|ID|PRIVACY CONTROLS|\n|---|---|\n|DM-3|Minimization of PII Used in Testing, Training, and Research|\n|IP|Individual Participation and Redress|\n|IP-1|Consent|\n|IP-2|Individual Access|\n|IP-3|Redress|\n|IP-4|Complaint Management|\n|SE|Security|\n|SE-1|Inventory of Personally Identifiable Information|\n|SE-2|Privacy Incident Response|\n|TR|Transparency|\n|TR-1|Privacy Notice|\n|TR-2|System of Records Notices and Privacy Act Statements|\n|TR-3|Dissemination of Privacy Program Information|\n|UL|Use Limitation|\n|UL-1|Internal Use|\n|UL-2|Information Sharing with Third Parties|\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n###### HOW TO USE THIS APPENDIX\n\nThe privacy controls outlined in this publication are primarily for use by an organization’s Senior\nAgency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) when working with program managers,\nmission/business owners, information owners/stewards, Chief Information Officers, Chief Information\nSecurity Officers, information system developers/integrators, and risk executives to determine how\nbest to incorporate effective privacy protections and practices (i.e., privacy controls) within\norganizational programs and information systems and the environments in which they operate. The\nprivacy controls facilitate the organization’s efforts to comply with privacy requirements affecting those\norganizational programs and/or systems that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of personally\nidentifiable information (PII) or other activities that raise privacy risks. While the security controls in\nAppendix F are allocated to the low, moderate, and high baselines in Appendix D, the privacy controls\nare selected and implemented based on the privacy requirements of organizations and the need to\nprotect the PII of individuals collected and maintained by organizational information systems and\nprograms, in accordance with federal privacy legislation, policies, directives, regulations, guidelines, and\nbest practices.\n\nOrganizations analyze and apply each privacy control with respect to their distinct mission/business and\noperational needs based on their legal authorities and obligations. Implementation of the privacy\ncontrols may vary based upon this analysis (e.g., organizations that are defined as covered entities\npursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] may have additional\nrequirements that are not specifically enumerated in this publication). This enables organizations to\ndetermine the information practices that are compliant with law and policy and those that may need\nreview. It also enables organizations to tailor the privacy controls to meet their defined and specific\nneeds at the organization level, mission/business process level, and information system level.\nOrganizations with national security or law enforcement authorities take those authorities as well as\nprivacy interests into account in determining how to apply the privacy controls in their operational\nenvironments. Similarly, organizations subject to the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical\nEfficiency Act (CIPSEA), implement the privacy controls consistent with that Act. All organizations\nimplement the privacy controls consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, subject to any\nexceptions and/or exemptions.\n\nPrivacy control enhancements described in Appendix J reflect best practices which organizations should\nstrive to achieve, but are not mandatory. Organizations should decide when to apply control\nenhancements to support their particular missions/business functions. Specific overlays for privacy,\ndeveloped in accordance with the guidance in Section 3.2 and Appendix I, can also be considered to\nfacilitate the tailoring of the security control baselines in Appendix D with the requisite privacy controls\nto ensure that both security and privacy requirements can be satisfied by organizations. Many of the\nsecurity controls in Appendix F provide the fundamental information protection for confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability within organizational information systems and the environments in which\nthose systems operate—protection that is essential for strong and effective privacy.\n\nOrganizations document the agreed upon privacy controls to be implemented in organizational\nprograms and information systems and the environments in which they operate. At the discretion of\nthe implementing organization, privacy controls may be documented in a distinct privacy plan or\nincorporated into other risk management documents (e.g., system security plans). Organizations also\nestablish appropriate assessment methodologies to determine the extent to which the privacy controls\nare implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to\nmeeting designated privacy requirements. Organizational assessments of privacy controls can be\nconducted either by the SAOP/CPO alone or jointly with the other organizational risk management\noffices including the information security office.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Implementation Tip**\n\n- Select and implement privacy controls based on the privacy requirements of organizations and\nthe need to protect the personally identifiable information (PII) of individuals collected and\nmaintained by systems and programs.\n\n- Coordinate privacy control selection and implementation with the organizational Risk Executive\nFunction, mission/business owners, enterprise architects, Chief Information Officer, SAOP/CPO,\nand Chief Information Security Officer.\n\n- View the privacy controls in Appendix J from the same perspective as the Program\nManagement controls in Appendix G—that is, the controls are implemented for each\norganizational information system irrespective of the FIPS 199 categorization for that system.\n\n- Select and implement the optional privacy control enhancements when there is a demonstrated\nneed for additional privacy protection for individuals and PII.\n\n- Apply the privacy controls consistent with any specific exceptions and exemptions included in\nlegislation, Executive Orders, directives, policies, and regulations (e.g., law enforcement or\nnational security considerations).\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**FAMILY: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE**\n\n\nThis family ensures that organizations: (i) identify the legal bases that authorize a particular\npersonally identifiable information (PII) collection or activity that impacts privacy; and (ii) specify in\ntheir notices the purpose(s) for which PII is collected.\n\n\n**AP-1** **AUTHORITY TO COLLECT**\n\nControl: The organization determines and documents the legal authority that permits the collection,\nuse, maintenance, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII), either generally or in\nsupport of a specific program or information system need.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Before collecting PII, the organization determines whether the\ncontemplated collection of PII is legally authorized. Program officials consult with the Senior\nAgency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel regarding the\nauthority of any program or activity to collect PII. The authority to collect PII is documented in\nthe System of Records Notice (SORN) and/or Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) or other\napplicable documentation such as Privacy Act Statements or Computer Matching Agreements.\nRelated controls: AR-2, DM-1, TR-1, TR-2.\n\nControl Enhancements: None.\n\nReferences: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (e); Section 208(c), E-Government Act of\n2002 (P.L. 107-347); OMB Circular A-130, Appendix I.\n\n**AP-2** **PURPOSE SPECIFICATION**\n\nControl: The organization describes the purpose(s) for which personally identifiable information\n(PII) is collected, used, maintained, and shared in its privacy notices.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Often, statutory language expressly authorizes specific collections and uses\nof PII. When statutory language is written broadly and thus subject to interpretation, organizations\nensure, in consultation with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer\n(CPO) and legal counsel, that there is a close nexus between the general authorization and any\nspecific collection of PII. Once the specific purposes have been identified, the purposes are clearly\ndescribed in the related privacy compliance documentation, including but not limited to Privacy\nImpact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records Notices (SORNs), and Privacy Act Statements\nprovided at the time of collection (e.g., on forms organizations use to collect PII). Further, in order\nto avoid unauthorized collections or uses of PII, personnel who handle PII receive training on the\norganizational authorities for collecting PII, authorized uses of PII, and on the contents of the\nnotice. Related controls: AR-2, AR-4, AR-5, DM-1, DM-2, TR-1, TR-2, UL-1, UL-2.\n\nControl Enhancements: None.\n\nReferences: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (e)(3)(A)-(B); Sections 208(b), (c), EGovernment Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347).\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**FAMILY: ACCOUNTABILITY, AUDIT, AND RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\n\nThis family enhances public confidence through effective controls for governance, monitoring, risk\nmanagement, and assessment to demonstrate that organizations are complying with applicable\nprivacy protection requirements and minimizing overall privacy risk.\n\n\n**AR-1** **GOVERNANCE AND PRIVACY PROGRAM**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na. Appoints a Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)\naccountable for developing, implementing, and maintaining an organization-wide governance\nand privacy program to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding\nthe collection, use, maintenance, sharing, and disposal of personally identifiable information\n(PII) by programs and information systems;\n\nb. Monitors federal privacy laws and policy for changes that affect the privacy program;\n\nc. Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined allocation of budget and staffing] sufficient\nresources to implement and operate the organization-wide privacy program;\n\nd. Develops a strategic organizational privacy plan for implementing applicable privacy\ncontrols, policies, and procedures;\n\ne. Develops, disseminates, and implements operational privacy policies and procedures that\ngovern the appropriate privacy and security controls for programs, information systems, or\ntechnologies involving PII; and\n\nf. Updates privacy plan, policies, and procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency,\n_at least biennially]._\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The development and implementation of a comprehensive governance and\nprivacy program demonstrates organizational accountability for and commitment to the protection\nof individual privacy. Accountability begins with the appointment of an SAOP/CPO with the\nauthority, mission, resources, and responsibility to develop and implement a multifaceted privacy\nprogram. The SAOP/CPO, in consultation with legal counsel, information security officials, and\nothers as appropriate: (i) ensures the development, implementation, and enforcement of privacy\npolicies and procedures; (ii) defines roles and responsibilities for protecting PII; (iii) determines\nthe level of information sensitivity with regard to PII holdings; (iv) identifies the laws, regulations,\nand internal policies that apply to the PII; (v) monitors privacy best practices; and (vi)\nmonitors/audits compliance with identified privacy controls.\n\nTo further accountability, the SAOP/CPO develops privacy plans to document the privacy\nrequirements of organizations and the privacy and security controls in place or planned for\nmeeting those requirements. The plan serves as evidence of organizational privacy operations and\nsupports resource requests by the SAOP/CPO. A single plan or multiple plans may be necessary\ndepending upon the organizational structures, requirements, and resources, and the plan(s) may\nvary in comprehensiveness. For example, a one-page privacy plan may cover privacy policies,\ndocumentation, and controls already in place, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) and\nSystem of Records Notices (SORN). A comprehensive plan may include a baseline of privacy\ncontrols selected from this appendix and include: (i) processes for conducting privacy risk\nassessments; (ii) templates and guidance for completing PIAs and SORNs; (iii) privacy training\nand awareness requirements; (iv) requirements for contractors processing PII; (v) plans for\neliminating unnecessary PII holdings; and (vi) a framework for measuring annual performance\ngoals and objectives for implementing identified privacy controls.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nControl Enhancements: None.\n\nReferences: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a; E-Government Act of 2002 (P.L. 107347); Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, 44 U.S.C. § 3541; OMB\nMemoranda 03-22, 05-08, 07-16; OMB Circular A-130; Federal Enterprise Architecture Security\nand Privacy Profile.\n\n**AR-2** **PRIVACY IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na. Documents and implements a privacy risk management process that assesses privacy risk to\nindividuals resulting from the collection, sharing, storing, transmitting, use, and disposal of\npersonally identifiable information (PII); and\n\nb. Conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for information systems, programs, or other\nactivities that pose a privacy risk in accordance with applicable law, OMB policy, or any\nexisting organizational policies and procedures.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life\ncycles of all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The\ntools and processes for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and resources. They\ninclude, but are not limited to, the conduct of PIAs. The PIA is both a process and the document\nthat is the outcome of that process. OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations\nfor implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on\nwhen PIAs are required for information systems. Some organizations may be required by law or\npolicy to extend the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting\nprivacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to identify privacy risks and\nidentify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also conducted to ensure that programs or\ninformation systems comply with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as\nnotice to the public of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring\ninformation systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use, maintain, or share PII and\nare updated when changes create new privacy risks.\n\nControl Enhancements: None.\n\nReferences: Section 208, E-Government Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347); Federal Information Security\nManagement Act (FISMA) of 2002, 44 U.S.C. § 3541; OMB Memoranda 03-22, 05-08, 10-23.\n\n**AR-3** **PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na. Establishes privacy roles, responsibilities, and access requirements for contractors and service\nproviders; and\n\nb. Includes privacy requirements in contracts and other acquisition-related documents.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Contractors and service providers include, but are not limited to,\ninformation providers, information processors, and other organizations providing information\nsystem development, information technology services, and other outsourced\napplications. Organizations consult with legal counsel, the Senior Agency Official for Privacy\n(SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), and contracting officers about applicable laws, directives,\npolicies, or regulations that may impact implementation of this control.

These assessments can be self-assessments or thirdparty audits that result in reports on compliance gaps identified in programs, projects, and\ninformation systems. In addition to auditing for effective implementation of all privacy controls\nidentified in this appendix, organizations assess whether they: (i) implement a process to embed\nprivacy considerations into the life cycle of personally identifiable information (PII), programs,\ninformation systems, mission/business processes, and technology; (ii) monitor for changes to\napplicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies; (iii) track programs, information systems, and\napplications that collect and maintain PII to ensure compliance; (iv) ensure that access to PII is\nonly on a need-to-know basis; and (v) ensure that PII is being maintained and used only for the\nlegally authorized purposes identified in the public notice(s).\n\nOrganizations also: (i) implement technology to audit for the security, appropriate use, and loss of\nPII; (ii) perform reviews to ensure physical security of documents containing PII; (iii) assess\ncontractor compliance with privacy requirements; and (iv) ensure that corrective actions identified\nas part of the assessment process are tracked and monitored until audit findings are corrected. The\norganization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) coordinates\nmonitoring and auditing efforts with information security officials and ensures that the results are\nprovided to senior managers and oversight officials.

Develops, implements, and updates a comprehensive training and awareness strategy aimed at\nensuring that personnel understand privacy responsibilities and procedures;\n\nb. Administers basic privacy training [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least\n_annually] and targeted, role-based privacy training for personnel having responsibility for_\npersonally identifiable information (PII) or for activities that involve PII [Assignment:\n_organization-defined frequency, at least annually]; and_\n\nc. Ensures that personnel certify (manually or electronically) acceptance of responsibilities for\nprivacy requirements [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually].\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Through implementation of a privacy training and awareness strategy, the\norganization promotes a culture of privacy. Privacy training and awareness programs typically\nfocus on broad topics, such as responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974 and E-Government\nAct of 2002 and the consequences of failing to carry out those responsibilities, how to identify\nnew privacy risks, how to mitigate privacy risks, and how and when to report privacy incidents.\nPrivacy training may also target data collection and use requirements identified in public notices,\nsuch as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) or System of Records Notices (SORNs) for a program\nor information system. Specific training methods may include: (i) mandatory annual privacy\nawareness training; (ii) targeted, role-based training; (iii) internal privacy program websites; (iv)\nmanuals, guides, and handbooks; (v) slide presentations; (vi) events (e.g., privacy awareness week,\nprivacy clean-up day); (vii) posters and brochures; and (viii) email messages to all employees and\ncontractors.

Reporting also helps\norganizations to determine progress in meeting privacy compliance requirements and privacy\ncontrols, compare performance across the federal government, identify vulnerabilities and gaps in\npolicy and implementation, and identify success models. Types of privacy reports include: (i)\nannual Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) reports to OMB; (ii) reports to Congress\nrequired by the Implementing Regulations of the _9/11 Commission Act; and (iii) other public_\nreports required by specific statutory mandates or internal policies of organizations.

By building\nprivacy controls into system design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII,\nthereby reducing the likelihood of information system breaches and other privacy-related\nincidents. Organizations also conduct periodic reviews of systems to determine the need for\nupdates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act and the organization’s privacy policy.\nRegardless of whether automated privacy controls are employed, organizations regularly monitor\ninformation system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the use/sharing is consistent with the\nauthorized purposes identified in the Privacy Act and/or in the public notice of organizations, or in\na manner compatible with those purposes.

Issues guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity of\ndisseminated information.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations take reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy and relevance\nof PII. Such steps may include, for example, editing and validating addresses as they are collected\nor entered into information systems using automated address verification look-up application\nprogramming interfaces (API). The types of measures taken to protect data quality are based on\nthe nature and context of the PII, how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. Measures taken to\nvalidate the accuracy of PII that is used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or\nprivileges of individuals under federal programs may be more comprehensive than those used to\nvalidate less sensitive PII. Additional steps may be necessary to validate PII that is obtained from\nsources other than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals.\n\nWhen PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (e.g., when it is used for annual reconfirmation of a\ntaxpayer’s income for a recurring benefit), organizations incorporate mechanisms into information\nsystems and develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the\ninformation is to be updated.

Identifies the minimum personally identifiable information (PII) elements that are relevant\nand necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose of collection;\n\nb. Limits the collection and retention of PII to the minimum elements identified for the purposes\ndescribed in the notice and for which the individual has provided consent; and\n\nc. Conducts an initial evaluation of PII holdings and establishes and follows a schedule for\nregularly reviewing those holdings [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least\n_annually] to ensure that only PII identified in the notice is collected and retained, and that the_\nPII continues to be necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations take appropriate steps to ensure that the collection of PII is\nconsistent with a purpose authorized by law or regulation. The minimum set of PII elements\nrequired to support a specific organization business process may be a subset of the PII the\norganization is authorized to collect. Program officials consult with the Senior Agency Official for\nPrivacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel to identify the minimum PII\nelements required by the information system or activity to accomplish the legally authorized\npurpose.\n\nOrganizations can further reduce their privacy and security risks by also reducing their inventory\nof PII, where appropriate. OMB Memorandum 07-16 requires organizations to conduct both an\ninitial review and subsequent reviews of their holdings of all PII and ensure, to the maximum\nextent practicable, that such holdings are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Organizations\nare also directed by OMB to reduce their holdings to the minimum necessary for the proper\nperformance of a documented organizational business purpose. OMB Memorandum 07-16\nrequires organizations to develop and publicize, either through a notice in the Federal Register or\non their websites, a schedule for periodic reviews of their holdings to supplement the initial\nreview. Organizations coordinate with their federal records officers to ensure that reductions in\norganizational holdings of PII are consistent with NARA retention schedules.\n\nBy performing periodic evaluations, organizations reduce risk, ensure that they are collecting only\nthe data specified in the notice, and ensure that the data collected is still relevant and necessary for\nthe purpose(s) specified in the notice.

Uses [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or methods] to ensure secure deletion or\ndestruction of PII (including originals, copies, and archived records).\n\nSupplemental Guidance: NARA provides retention schedules that govern the disposition of federal\nrecords. Program officials coordinate with records officers and with NARA to identify appropriate\nretention periods and disposal methods. NARA may require organizations to retain PII longer than\nis operationally needed. In those situations, organizations describe such requirements in the notice.\nMethods of storage include, for example, electronic, optical media, or paper.\n\nExamples of ways organizations may reduce holdings include reducing the types of PII held (e.g.,\ndelete Social Security numbers if their use is no longer needed) or shortening the retention period\nfor PII that is maintained if it is no longer necessary to keep PII for long periods of time (this\neffort is undertaken in consultation with an organization’s records officer to receive NARA\napproval). In both examples, organizations provide notice (e.g., an updated System of Records\nNotice) to inform the public of any changes in holdings of PII.\n\nCertain read-only archiving techniques, such as DVDs, CDs, microfilm, or microfiche, may not\npermit the removal of individual records without the destruction of the entire database contained\non such media.

By providing\nindividuals with access to PII and the ability to have their PII corrected or amended, as appropriate,\nthe controls in this family enhance public confidence in organizational decisions made based on the\nPII.\n\n\n**IP-1** **CONSENT**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na. Provides means, where feasible and appropriate, for individuals to authorize the collection,\nuse, maintaining, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII) prior to its\ncollection;\n\nb. Provides appropriate means for individuals to understand the consequences of decisions to\napprove or decline the authorization of the collection, use, dissemination, and retention of PII;\n\nc. Obtains consent, where feasible and appropriate, from individuals prior to any new uses or\ndisclosure of previously collected PII; and\n\nd. Ensures that individuals are aware of and, where feasible, consent to all uses of PII not\ninitially described in the public notice that was in effect at the time the organization collected\nthe PII.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Consent is fundamental to the participation of individuals in the decisionmaking process regarding the collection and use of their PII and the use of technologies that may\nincrease risk to personal privacy. To obtain consent, organizations provide individuals appropriate\nnotice of the purposes of the PII collection or technology use and a means for individuals to\nconsent to the activity. Organizations tailor the public notice and consent mechanisms to meet\noperational needs. Organizations achieve awareness and consent, for example, through updated\npublic notices.\nOrganizations may obtain consent through opt-in, opt-out, or implied consent. Opt-in consent is\nthe preferred method, but it is not always feasible. Opt-in requires that individuals take affirmative\naction to allow organizations to collect or use PII. For example, opt-in consent may require an\nindividual to click a radio button on a website, or sign a document providing consent. In contrast,\nopt-out requires individuals to take action to prevent the new or continued collection or use of\nsuch PII. For example, the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call Registry allows individuals\nto opt-out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by requesting to be added to a list. Implied\nconsent is the least preferred method and should be used in limited circumstances. Implied consent\noccurs where individuals’ behavior or failure to object indicates agreement with the collection or\nuse of PII (e.g., by entering and remaining in a building where notice has been posted that security\ncameras are in use, the individual implies consent to the video recording). Depending upon the\nnature of the program or information system, it may be appropriate to allow individuals to limit\nthe types of PII they provide and subsequent uses of that PII. Organizational consent mechanisms\ninclude a discussion of the consequences to individuals of failure to provide PII. Consequences\ncan vary from organization to organization.

Effective redress processes demonstrate organizational commitment to data\nquality especially in those business functions where inaccurate data may result in inappropriate\ndecisions or denial of benefits and services to individuals. Organizations use discretion in\ndetermining if records are to be corrected or amended, based on the scope of redress requests, the\nchanges sought, and the impact of the changes. Individuals may appeal an adverse decision and\nhave incorrect information amended, where appropriate.\n\nTo provide effective redress, organizations: (i) provide effective notice of the existence of a PII\ncollection; (ii) provide plain language explanations of the processes and mechanisms for\nrequesting access to records; (iii) establish criteria for submitting requests for correction or\namendment; (iv) implement resources to analyze and adjudicate requests; (v) implement means of\ncorrecting or amending data collections; and (vi) review any decisions that may have been the\nresult of inaccurate information.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOrganizational redress processes provide responses to individuals of decisions to deny requests for\ncorrection or amendment, including the reasons for those decisions, a means to record individual\nobjections to the organizational decisions, and a means of requesting organizational reviews of the\ninitial determinations.

Includes Privacy Act Statements on its forms that collect PII, or on separate forms that can be\nretained by individuals, to provide additional formal notice to individuals from whom the\ninformation is being collected.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations issue SORNs to provide the public notice regarding PII\ncollected in a system of records, which the Privacy Act defines as “a group of any records under\nthe control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by\nsome identifying number, symbol, or other identifier.” SORNs explain how the information is\nused, retained, and may be corrected, and whether certain portions of the system are subject to\nPrivacy Act exemptions for law enforcement or national security reasons. Privacy Act Statements\nprovide notice of: (i) the authority of organizations to collect PII; (ii) whether providing PII is\nmandatory or optional; (iii) the principal purpose(s) for which the PII is to be used; (iv) the\nintended disclosures (routine uses) of the information; and (v) the consequences of not providing\nall or some portion of the information requested. When information is collected verbally,\norganizations read a Privacy Act Statement prior to initiating the collection of PII (for example,\nwhen conducting telephone interviews or surveys). Related control: DI-2.\n\nControl Enhancements:\n\n**(1)** _SYSTEM OF RECORDS NOTICES AND PRIVACY ACT STATEMENTS | PUBLIC WEBSITE PUBLICATION_\n\n**The organization publishes SORNs on its public website.**\n\nReferences: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (e)(3); OMB Circular A-130.\n\n**TR-3** **DISSEMINATION OF PRIVACY PROGRAM INFORMATION**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na. Ensures that the public has access to information about its privacy activities and is able to\ncommunicate with its Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer\n(CPO); and\n\nb. Ensures that its privacy practices are publicly available through organizational websites or\notherwise.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations employ different mechanisms for informing the public about\ntheir privacy practices including, but not limited to, Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System\nof Records Notices (SORNs), privacy reports, publicly available web pages, email distributions,\nblogs, and periodic publications (e.g., quarterly newsletters). Organizations also employ publicly\nfacing email addresses and/or phone lines that enable the public to provide feedback and/or direct\nquestions to privacy offices regarding privacy practices. Related control: AR-6.\n\nControl Enhancements: None.\n\nReferences: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a; Section 208, E-Government Act of 2002\n(P.L. 107-347); OMB Memoranda 03-22, 10-23.\n\n\n-----\n\nand Organizations\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**FAMILY: USE LIMITATION**\n\n\nThis family ensures that organizations only use personally identifiable information (PII) either as\nspecified in their public notices, in a manner compatible with those specified purposes, or as\notherwise permitted by law. Implementation of the controls in this family will ensure that the scope\nof PII use is limited accordingly.\n\n\n**UL-1** **INTERNAL USE**\n\nControl: The organization uses personally identifiable information (PII) internally only for the\nauthorized purpose(s) identified in the Privacy Act and/or in public notices.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: Organizations take steps to ensure that they use PII only for legally\nauthorized purposes and in a manner compatible with uses identified in the Privacy Act and/or in\npublic notices. These steps include monitoring and auditing organizational use of PII and training\norganizational personnel on the authorized uses of PII. With guidance from the Senior Agency\nOfficial for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and where appropriate, legal counsel,\norganizations document processes and procedures for evaluating any proposed new uses of PII to\nassess whether they fall within the scope of the organizational authorities. Where appropriate,\norganizations obtain consent from individuals for the new use(s) of PII. Related controls: AP-2,\nAR-2, AR-3, AR-4, AR-5, IP-1, TR-1, TR-2.\n\nControl Enhancements: None.\n\nReferences: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (b)(1).\n\n**UL-2** **INFORMATION SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES**\n\nControl: The organization:\n\na. Shares personally identifiable information (PII) externally, only for the authorized purposes\nidentified in the Privacy Act and/or described in its notice(s) or for a purpose that is\ncompatible with those purposes;\n\nb. Where appropriate, enters into Memoranda of Understanding, Memoranda of Agreement,\nLetters of Intent, Computer Matching Agreements, or similar agreements, with third parties\nthat specifically describe the PII covered and specifically enumerate the purposes for which\nthe PII may be used;\n\nc. Monitors, audits, and trains its staff on the authorized sharing of PII with third parties and on\nthe consequences of unauthorized use or sharing of PII; and\n\nd. Evaluates any proposed new instances of sharing PII with third parties to assess whether the\nsharing is authorized and whether additional or new public notice is required.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief\nPrivacy Officer (CPO) and, where appropriate, legal counsel review and approve any proposed\nexternal sharing of PII, including with other public, international, or private sector entities, for\nconsistency with uses described in the existing organizational public notice(s). When a proposed\nnew instance of external sharing of PII is not currently authorized by the Privacy Act and/or\nspecified in a notice, organizations evaluate whether the proposed external sharing is compatible\nwith the purpose(s) specified in the notice. If the proposed sharing is compatible, organizations\nreview, update, and republish their Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records\nNotices (SORNs), website privacy policies, and other public notices, if any, to include specific\ndescriptions of the new uses(s) and obtain consent where appropriate and feasible. Informationsharing agreements also include security protections consistent with the sensitivity of the\ninformation being shared.
