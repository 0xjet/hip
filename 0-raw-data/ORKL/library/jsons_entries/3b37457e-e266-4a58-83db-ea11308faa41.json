On Twitter,\nCISA said \"there is an imminent and increased cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and\nhealthcare providers.\"\n\"CISA, FBI, and (the Department of Health and Human Services) have credible information\nof an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers,\"\nthe advisory stated. \"CISA, FBI, and HHS are sharing this information to provide warning to\nhealthcare providers to ensure that they take timely and reasonable precautions to protect\ntheir networks from these threats.\"\nA Trump administration official told CNN that some hospitals have already been affected.\nRansomware is a type of malware, or malicious software, that encrypts a victim's files. The\nattacker then typically demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data upon\npayment. Users are often shown instructions for how to pay a fee to get the decryption key.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe costs can range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, often payable to\ncybercriminals in Bitcoin.\nRead More\nRansomware and other cyber attacks have seen a sharp rise this year, and hospitals have\nbeen particularly vulnerable since the start of the global pandemic. Since July, hospitals in\nstates including New York, Nebraska, Ohio, Missouri and Michigan have all been attacked by\nsome form of ransomware.\nA Trump administration official told CNN that several hospitals have been targeted in the\nattacks over the past two days, and while it's still early, the official said the incidents may be\nconnected. The federal government is investigating the attacks, the official said.\nSo far, St. Lawrence Health Systems in New York and the Sky Lakes Medical Center in\nOregon confirmed to CNN that they were targeted over the past few days. The University of\nVermont Health Network said in a press release Thursday that it is experiencing a\n\"significant\" and \"ongoing\" system-wide network issue, and is investigating all possible\ncauses, including \"a malicious cyberattack.\"\nExperts with Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm, said they identified at least three attacks on\nTuesday and one on Wednesday, with patients getting diverted to other hospitals as a result.\n\"We are experiencing the most significant cyber security threat we've ever seen in the United\nStates,\" Charles Carmakal, SVP and CTO of Mandiant, said. \"An Eastern European\nfinancially motivated threat actor, is deliberately targeting and disrupting U.S. hospitals,\nforcing them to divert patients to other healthcare providers. Patients may experience\nprolonged wait time to receive critical care.\"\nAllan Liska, an intelligence analyst for the firm Recorded Future, told CNN that his company\nknows of at least six attacks in the last 24 hours and \"there are probably more.\"\nIt is \"absolutely the biggest thing we've ever seen. In terms of ransomware it's the biggest\nattack we've ever seen,\" he said, adding that it's \"crushing to see so many hospitals hit at the\nsame time.\"\nChris Krebs, director of CISA, warned health care and public health individuals to have their\n\"shields up! Assume Ryuk is inside the house. Executives - be ready to activate business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery plans. IT sec teams - patch, MFA, check logs, make sure\nyou have a good backup point.\"\nIn a statement from the St. Lawrence Health Systems, the virus has been identified as a new\nvariant of Ryuk ransomware, previously unknown to antivirus software providers and security\nagencies.\nIt is not known who carried out the attacks, but overall, the incidents represent a solid\nexpansion of hospital targets in a short period of time who have sought to take advantage of\nthe crush facing hospitals in the wake of the global pandemic.\nRansomware can have devastating effects. Most recently, it crippled the IT network of a\nGerman hospital resulting in the death of a woman seeking emergency treatment.\nAccording to Microsoft Corporate Vice President for Customer Security and Trust Tom Burt,\nRyuk is a sophisticated crypto-ransomware because it identifies and encrypts network files\nand disables Windows System Restore to prevent people from being able to recover from\n\n\n-----\n\nthe attack without external backups. Ryuk has been attacking organizations, including\nmunicipal governments, state courts, hospitals, nursing homes, enterprises and large\nuniversities.\nAccording to Burt, Ryuk has been attributed to attacks targeting a contractor for the\nDepartment of Defense, the North Carolina city of Durham, an IT provider for 110 nursing\nhomes and a number of hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n_CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to remove references to Universal Health_\n_Services, which was not targeted in the most recent attack._\n\n\n-----",
