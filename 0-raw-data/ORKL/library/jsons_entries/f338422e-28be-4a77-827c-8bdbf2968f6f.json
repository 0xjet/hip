Command added when the Koadic RAT is downloaded (use of {Variable}.shell.exec_\n\n_command)_\n\nIf Koadic finds that the system is conducive to the attacker’s interests, it downloads a base64-\nencrypted version of the ANEL malware from the Command-and-Control (C&C) server and\n\nexecutes it. Encrypted ANEL is decrypted using the “certutil -docode” command. When ANEL\n\nexecutes, a decrypted DLL file with the filename “lena_http_dll.dll” is expanded in memory. This file\ncontains one export function — either “crt_main” or “lena_main”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Base64 encoded ANEL downloaded by Koadic_\n\nANEL will send the infected environment’s information to the C&C server. When sending the\n\ninformation, ANEL encrypts the data using blowfish, XOR, and Base64-based encryption methods.\nThe format ANEL uses to send data is similar to ChChes, but ANEL’s encryption method is easier\n\nto use.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Encryption key using blowfish_\n\nWe initially discovered the malware known as ANEL back in November 2017. At that time,\nChessMaster was using ANEL as a backdoor into the target system then injects code into\n\nsvchost.exe, which then decrypts and activates the embedded backdoor. This initial version of\nANEL had a hardcoded version labeled “5.0.0 beta1” that contained incomplete code. We noted\n\nthat this might signify the release of a future variant.\n\nInstead of just one new variant, we discovered four different versions of ANEL:\n\n5.0.0 beta1\n\n5.1.1 rc\n\n5.1.2 rc1\n\n5.2.0 rev1\n\n\n-----\n\n|CMD ID|5.0.0 beta1/5.1.1 rc/5.1.2 rc1|5.2.0 rev1|\n|---|---|---|\n|0x97A168D9697D40DD|Save File||\n|0x7CF812296CCC68D5|Upload File||\n|0x652CB1CEFF1C0A00|NA|Load New PE file|\n|0x27595F1F74B55278|Save File and Execute||\n|If no match above|Execute Command or File||\n\n\n_Figure 11. Summary of the changes between each version of ANEL_\n\nDifferences with regards to Backdoor commands:\n\nCMD ID 5.0.0 beta1/5.1.1 rc/5.1.2 5.2.0 rev1\n\nrc1\n\n0x97A168D9697D40DD Save File\n\n0x7CF812296CCC68D5 Upload File\n\n0x652CB1CEFF1C0A00 NA Load New PE file\n\n0x27595F1F74B55278 Save File and Execute\n\nIf no match above Execute Command or File\n\nThe differences shown in the table above are subtle but present. For example, the initial ANEL\nversion, “5.0.0 beta1,” uses a different C&C server compared to the other versions. Once ANEL\n\nevolved to “5.1.1 rc,” it changed its file type to an executable, while also changing the C&C server.\n\nThe third version we found (5.1.2 rc1) reverts to a DLL file type but retains the C&C server. The\nfourth version of ANEL (5.2.0 rev1) changes both the export function in the expanded main ANEL\n\nDLL and uses a different C&C server. Overall, we can see subtle changes, which indicate that the\nthreat actors behind ANEL are making incremental improvements to the malware to refine it.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. Backdoor function differences between ANEL 5.0.0 beta1/5.1.1 rc/5.1.2 rc1 (left) and_\n\n_ANEL 5.2.0 rev1 (right)_\n\nOnce ANEL enters the user’s system, it will download various tools that could be used for malicious\n\npurposes, including password retrieval tools as well as malicious mail services and accessibility\ntools that will allow it to gather information about the system. These include Getpass.exe and\n\nMail.exe, which are password and information stealers.\n\nIt also downloads the following:\n\n_Accevent exe <-> Microsoft Accessible Event Watcher 7 2 0 0_\n\n\n-----\n\nHijacking. In this scenario, accevent.exe is the primary executable, which is usually legitimate.\n\nAfter the execution of accevent.exe, it loads event.dll, which will be placed in the same folder (so it\ntakes loading priority), after which event.dll decrypts and loads the encrypted backdoor\n\n_ssssss.ddd, which is BKDR_ANEL. When we analyzed ANEL 5.1.1 rc, encrypted ANEL 5.1.2 rc1_\nwas downloaded and executed.\n\n**_Short-term mitigation_**\n\nWhen the user opens the document DDEAUTO or Link Auto Update, Office will display a message.\n\nIf the user clicks on the “No” button, malicious activity will not initiate.\n\n_Figure 13: Popup message when users open the document that abuses DDEAUTO_\n\n\n-----\n\nthe traffic.\n\n_Figure 15. Koadic’s communication traffic_\n\n**_Medium- to long-term mitigation_**\n\nAt first glance, it seems ChessMaster’s evolution over the past few months involves subtle\n\nchanges. However, the constant addition and changing of features and attack vectors indicate that\nthe attackers behind the campaign are unlikely to stop and are constantly looking to evolve their\n\ntools and tactics.\n\nOrganizations can implement various techniques and best practices to defend against targeted\n\nattacks, such as regular patching to prevent vulnerability exploitation and using tools that provide\nprotection across different network levels. Solutions that feature behavior monitoring, application\n\n[control, email gateway monitoring, and intrusion/detection systems can help with this.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/infosec-guide-email-threats)\n\nGiven how cybercriminal tools, tactics and procedures are evolving, organizations will have to go\n\n\n-----\n\nsystem. A proactive strategy can be much more effective for targeted attacks, as these kinds of\nattacks are often designed to be elusive and difficult to detect, thus the need to scope them out. A\n\ncomprehensive security strategy that involves proactive incident response will need the input of\n\nboth decision makers and tech-savvy personnel, as they will need to be on the same page for it to\n\nbe effective.\n\nIn addition to implementing both mitigation techniques and proactive strategies, organizations can\n\nalso strengthen their security by employing solutions such Trend Micro™ Deep\n\n[Security™, Vulnerability Protection, and TippingPoint, which protects endpoints from threats that](https://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/product-security/vulnerability-protection/)\n\nabuse vulnerabilities.\n\nIn addition, comprehensive security solutions can be used to protect organizations from attacks.\n\n[These include Trend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/business/complete-user-protection/index.html)\n\n[and Worry-Free™ Business Security, which can protect users and businesses from these threats](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/small-business/product-security/)\n\n[by detecting malicious files, well as blocking all related malicious URLs.
