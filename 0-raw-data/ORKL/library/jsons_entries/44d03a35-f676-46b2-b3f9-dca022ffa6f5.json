Newbies open up the media, see some crazy virtual millions\nof dollars that they will never get. They don't want anything, they don't learn anything,\nthey don't code anything, they just don't even think, the whole essence of being comes\ndown to \"encrypt - get $\". They just run to github, look for locker sorts there and run to\nencrypt everything they see. Since our forum is aimed at beginners, this factor is\nimportant to us.\n\nToo much PR. Lockers (ransom) have accumulated a critical mass of nonsense,\nnonsense, hype, noise. When you meet the \" Ransomvarny negotiator \" Profession,\nyou understand that you are in the looking glass or just crazy. Moreover, 90% of this\nmadness was created artificially, feeding this hype. Those who make good money on\nthis noise (exchanges, insurance, intermediaries, media, etc.)\n\nPolicy and hazard level. Peskov is forced to make excuses in front of our overseas\n\"friends\" - this is some kind of nonsense and exaggeration. The word ranso was\nequated with a number of unpleasant phenomena - geopolitics, extortion, government\nhacking. This word has become dangerous and toxic.\n\nLockers will exist for a long time. This phenomenon was too loudly promoted.\"\n\n## Ransomware gangs not happy\n\nShortly after the posting of the topics, representatives of the REvil ransomware gangs\nshowed their displeasure.\n\n**Post by REvil representative**\n\n**Post by LockBit operator**\n\n\n-----\n\nWith ransomware gang s core members keeping a low profile, law enforcement targets the\naffiliates to weaken or force an operation to close down.\n\nAs more hacking communities make ransomware operations unwelcome, it will become\nharder for RaaS operations to recruit new affiliates and promote their activities.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Screencastify Chrome extension flaws allow webcam hijacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/screencastify-chrome-extension-flaws-allow-webcam-hijacks/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
