The campaign leveraged news about Russia’s war against Ukraine to encourage recipients\nto open emails, which immediately compromised vulnerable Roundcube servers (an open-source\nwebmail software), using [CVE-2020-35730, without engaging with the attachment. We found that the](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35730)\ncampaign overlaps with historic BlueDelta activity exploiting the Microsoft Outlook zero-day\n[vulnerability CVE-2023-23397 in 2022. The campaign overlaps with activity attributed by CERT-UA to](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23397)\nAPT28 (also known as Forest Blizzard and Fancy Bear), which multiple Western governments attribute\nto the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU).\n\nBased on the targeting and geopolitical backdrop and the group’s organizational links, the highlighted\nBlueDelta activity was likely intended to enable military intelligence-gathering to support Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine. Infrastructure related to BlueDelta activity has likely been operational since at least\nNovember 2021. This infrastructure was identified by Insikt Group via Recorded Future® Malicious\nTraffic Analysis (MTA) which surfaced multiple Ukrainian entities, including government institutions,\ncommunicating with this BlueDelta infrastructure. Organizations within Ukraine are likely the primary\ntargets of this activity. Potential targets can help to mitigate the risk of exploitation of these known\nvulnerabilities by ensuring that any Roundcube software is fully patched and up-to-date.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - We identified BlueDelta activity highly likely targeting a regional Ukrainian prosecutor's office and\na central Ukrainian executive authority, as well as reconnaissance activity involving additional\nUkrainian government entities and an organization involved in Ukrainian military aircraft\ninfrastructure upgrade and refurbishment.\n\n  - [The analyzed BlueDelta phishing campaign exploits the vulnerabilities CVE-2020-35730,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35730)\n[CVE-2020-12641, and CVE-2021-44026](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12641) in the open-source webmail software Roundcube in\norder to run multiple reconnaissance and exfiltration scripts.\n\n  - The malicious scripts are designed to redirect a victim’s future incoming emails to an\nactor-controlled email address, perform reconnaissance on the target Roundcube server,\nexfiltrate the victim’s Roundcube session cookie and address book, along with session and user\ninformation from Roundcube’s database.\n\n## Background\n\n[Insikt Group has monitored open-source reports (1, 2) surrounding the critical elevation of privilege](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/microsoft-mitigates-outlook-elevation-of-privilege-vulnerability/)\n[(EoP) vulnerability CVE-2023-23397, published by Microsoft on March 14, 2023, which affects all](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23397)\nsupported versions of Microsoft Outlook for Windows. The vulnerability allows an attacker to send a\nmalicious email to a vulnerable version of Microsoft Outlook to obtain the Net-NTLMv2 hash of the\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nemail recipient. The attacker can use this hash to perform an NTLM relay attack and authenticate to\n[other services, impersonating a victim. Exploitation of CVE-2023-23397 does not require](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/03/24/guidance-for-investigating-attacks-using-cve-2023-23397/) user\ninteraction and is triggered once the vulnerable Outlook client receives the malicious email.\n\nShortly after its original disclosure we became aware of multiple security vendors linking zero-day\nexploitation of this vulnerability to Russian state-sponsored actors, a narrative that has developed\ntoward attributing the activity specifically to APT28 (aka Forest Blizzard or Fancy Bear) by CERT-UA.\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence originally [assessed](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/microsoft-mitigates-outlook-elevation-of-privilege-vulnerability/) that an unspecified Russia-based threat actor used\nthe exploit patched in CVE-2023-23397 in targeted attacks against a limited number of organizations in\ngovernment, transportation, energy, and military sectors in Europe. Open-source [reporting has stated](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-outlook-zero-day-used-by-russian-hackers-since-april-2022/)\nthat (pre-disclosure) exploitation was suspected to have been limited to fewer than 15 target\norganizations between April and December 2022.\n\nBased on our visibility into these intrusions, we identified threat activity that indicated this campaign\nbegan as early as February 2022. Insikt Group tracks this cluster of activity as a distinct threat group,\n[BlueDelta. An examination of port use and banner data on known IP addresses used by BlueDelta since](https://github.com/ruppde/yara_rules/blob/main/CVE-2023-23397/munin_check-results_CVE-2023-23397.csv)\n2022 revealed the consistent use of port 445, the default port for SMB, to assist in the exploitation of\nCVE-2023-23397. Nearly all of the devices identified in connection with this activity had banner\ninformation that was associated with the Ubiquiti EdgeOS operating system commonly found in Ubiquiti\nEdge routing devices and were likely compromised for use in this BlueDelta operation.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n#### Infrastructure Analysis\n\nThe earliest IP address identified as being [used in association with BlueDelta CVE-2023-23397](https://github.com/ruppde/yara_rules/blob/main/CVE-2023-23397/munin_check-results_CVE-2023-23397.csv)\nexploitation activity was 5.199.162[.]132. Unlike other IP addresses related to BlueDelta\nCVE-2023-23397 exploitation activity, this IP address was likely actor-owned rather than a\ncompromised Ubiquiti device. Analysis of the historical server banners hosted on IP address\n5.199.162[.]132 between March and April 2022 revealed an uncommon HTTP banner hosted on TCP\nport 443, detailed in Figure 1.\n```\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\nExpires: 0\nPragma: no-cache\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nDate: <REDACTED>\nContent-Length: 19\n\n```\n**Figure 1: HTTP banner observed on 5.199.162[.]132:443 (Source: Shodan)**\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nThe server also hosted an SMB banner on port TCP port 445.

These domains were present — either\nin the TLS certificate hosted on the IP address or discovered via historical passive DNS data — at the\nsame time as the aforementioned banner shown in Figure 1:\n\n  - global-news-world\n\n  - global-world-news\n\n  - armpress\n\n  - **newsnew**\n\n  - globalnewsnew\n\n  - namenews\n\nAt the time of reporting, 4 out of the 12 domains were still active. Unlike the earlier BlueDelta IP address\naffiliated with ​CVE-2023-23397 activity, these IP addresses did not have TCP port 445 open and were\nnot Ubiquiti EdgeOS devices. All 4 IP addresses used Let’s Encrypt TLS certificates and returned the\nsame “404 Not Found” response when navigating directly to the IP address or domain name over TCP\nport 443.\n\nAll 12 IP addresses are likely dedicated actor VPS infrastructure, which is in contrast to all but 1 IP\naddress observed within the previous BlueDelta activity regarding CVE-2023-23397 where\ncompromised Ubiquiti devices were used.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA)\n\nA review of Recorded Future’s MTA data set identified suspicious communications from several\nUkrainian entities to BlueDelta infrastructure since March 2023. Of particular note were communications\ninvolving multiple Ukrainian government entities throughout different regions of the country.\n\nWe also observed communications originating from BlueDelta IP addresses to Ukrainian IP addresses\nwhich were likely related to reconnaissance activities. DNS information related to the Ukrainian IP\naddresses revealed a number of Ukrainian government organizations and state enterprises that are\nhighly likely to be potential future targets.\n\nIn addition, we surfaced communications between BlueDelta infrastructure to IP addresses owned by\nMETA UA, a Ukrainian search engine and webmail provider, over TCP port 25. Based on intelligence\nshared by CERT-UA, this activity is likely related to BlueDelta operators disseminating their\nspearphishing emails via smtp.meta[.]ua.\n\n#### Spearphishing\n\nIn collaboration with CERT-UA, Insikt Group reviewed a sample of a spearphishing email attributed to\nthis BlueDelta campaign activity, the body of which is shown in Figure 4. A JavaScript file attachment\n[included within the spearphishing email was designed to exploit CVE-2020-35730, targeting users of](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35730)\nthe Roundcube webmail platform. Upon exploitation, the JavaScript code fetches and executes 2\nfurther JavaScript payloads from a remote server. Insikt Group was also able to identify a third\nmalicious JavaScript file associated with the same infrastructure. An infographic detailing the overlap\nbetween the Outlook and Roundcube attack methods is shown in Figure 3.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: BlueDelta Outlook and Roundcube spearphishing infection chain overlap (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nThe header section of the email included the sender IP address, 77.243.181[.]238, previously identified\nas hosting the same uncommon banners as IP address 5.199.162[.]132 and the domains\nglobal-news-world[.]com and global-world-news[.]net. Additionally, the spearphishing email was sent\nvia meta[.]ua MX servers from the email address ukraine_news@meta[.]ua, corroborating the MTA\nfindings noted above.\n\n**News Lure**\n\nAs seen in Figure 4, the subject line of the email, Новини України (Eng: Ukraine News), mirrors the\ncontent contained within the body of the email, which includes the heading Сьогодні в Україні (Eng:\nNews in Ukraine). This content was almost certainly obtained from The New Voice of Ukraine, a\nlegitimate media source.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: HTML email lure (Source: CERT-UA)**\n\nThe news lure shown in Figure 4 was sent from the email address ukraine_news@meta[.]ua, which\naligns with the subject of the email (“Ukraine News”) and also continues to follow previously observed\nnews themes. The lure contained a byline from a New Voice of Ukraine (NV) journalist and bears the\ndate May 12, 2023, the same date the media [content](https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/events/kontrnastup-zsu-ukrajina-formuye-operaciji-novini-ukrajini-50323940.html) was published on the NV website. The email body\ncontent appears to be a direct copy of an NV email newsletter, which discusses Ukraine’s military\ncounter-offensive. This shows a level of preparedness on the part of BlueDelta operators, who were\nable to weaponize the newsletter into a lure within hours of its initial publication. Other than opening the\nemail, no interaction between the victim and the attachment is required in order for the exploit to occur.\n\n**Email Exploit**\n\nThe phishing email attachment contains an exploit for CVE-2020-35730, a cross-site scripting (XSS)\nvulnerability that exists in Roundcube Webmail versions prior to 1.2.13, 1.3.16, and 1.4.10. The\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nvulnerability, originally disclosed on December 28, 2020, allows an attacker to perform a XSS attack by\nsending an email with JavaScript embedded inside a link reference element.\n\n**Figure 5: Exploit for CVE-2020-35730 (XSS in Roundcube) (Source: CERT-UA)**\n\nThe JavaScript code used within the XSS exploit retrieves and executes 2 further JavaScript files from\n2 distinct URLs referenced in Figures 6 and 7 that were hosted on one of the BlueDelta-controlled\ndomains highlighted previously (global-world-news[.]net).\n```\ndownload_url = hXXps://global-world-news[.]net:443/e?m=<Base64 encoded victim\nemail address>&r=<Base64 encoded actor controlled email address>=&s=<Base64\nencoded date yyyy-mm-dd>\n\n```\n**Figure 6: Download URL Communicating with BlueDelta Infrastructure (Source: CERT-UA)**\n```\nsql_url = hXXps://global-world-news[.]net:443/q?m=<Base64 encoded victim email\naddress>&r=<Base64 encoded actor controlled email address>\n\n```\n**Figure 7: SQL URL Communicating with BlueDelta Infrastructure (Source: CERT-UA)**\n\nInsikt Group also identified an XML file containing JavaScript associated with a BlueDelta IP address,\n5.199.162[.]132, which contained the historical URL shown in Figure 8. Files associated with the IP\n[address 5.199.162[.]132 were previously attributed by Insikt Group to BlueDelta’s earlier exploitation](https://github.com/ruppde/yara_rules/blob/main/CVE-2023-23397/munin_check-results_CVE-2023-23397.csv) of\nthe zero-day Microsoft Outlook vulnerability CVE-2023-23397. The URL format found within this\nprevious BlueDelta file is structurally identical to the URL format observed in the phishing email\nprovided by CERT-UA in connection with more recent BlueDelta activity. When decoded, the URL\ncontained a Ukrainian government institution email address that was likely an additional BlueDelta\ntarget. It is likely that this file was used as an attachment in a phishing email to exploit\n[CVE-2020-13965, another vulnerability that allows for XSS when previewing XML attachments in](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13965)\nRoundcube versions before 1.3.12 and between 1.4.x and 1.4.5.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n**Figure 5: Exploit for CVE-2020-35730 (XSS in Roundcube) (Source: CERT-UA)**\n\nThe JavaScript code used within the XSS exploit retrieves and executes 2 further JavaScript files from\n2 distinct URLs referenced in Figures 6 and 7 that were hosted on one of the BlueDelta-controlled\ndomains highlighted previously (global-world-news[.]net).\n```\ndownload_url = hXXps://global-world-news[.]net:443/e?m=<Base64 encoded victim\nemail address>&r=<Base64 encoded actor controlled email address>=&s=<Base64\nencoded date yyyy-mm-dd>\n\n```\n: Download URL Communicating with BlueDelta Infrastructure (Source: CERT-UA)\n```\nsql_url = hXXps://global-world-news[.]net:443/q?m=<Base64 encoded victim email\n  &r=<Base64 encoded actor controlled email address>\n\n```\n: SQL URL Communicating with BlueDelta Infrastructure (Source: CERT-UA)\n\nInsikt Group also identified an XML file containing JavaScript associated with a BlueDelta IP address,\n5.199.162[.]132, which contained the historical URL shown in Figure 8.

The created filter automatically\nforwards all emails received by the victim to a specified email address. After creating the filter, it\nretrieves a copy of Roundcube’s About page, which contains the installation’s version number and a list\nof installed plugins, and sends the data to\n```\nhXXps://global-world-news[.]net:443/about/<Base64 encoded victim email address>\n\n```\nvia an HTTP POST request.

The most recent\nactivity very likely represents a continued focus on these entities and specifically those within Ukraine.\nWe assess that BlueDelta activity is likely intended to enable military intelligence-gathering to support\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine and believe that BlueDelta will almost certainly continue to prioritize\ntargeting Ukrainian government and private sector organizations to support wider Russian military\nefforts. Recorded Future’s collaboration with CERT-UA further emphasizes the importance of\npartnerships between industry and governments to enable collective defense against strategic threats\n— in this case, Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A — Indicators\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B — Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n\n|Appendix B — Mitre ATT&CK Techniques|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tactic: Technique|ATT&CK Code|\n|Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment|T1566.001|\n|Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution|T1203|\n|Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter: JavaScript|T1059.007|\n|Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information|T1027|\n|Defense Evasion: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information|T1140|\n|Credential Access: OS Credential Dumping: /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow|T1003.008|\n|Discovery: System Information Discovery|T1082|\n|Discovery: System Network Configuration Discovery|T1016|\n|Discovery: System Owner/User Discovery|T1033|\n|Discovery: System Network Connections Discovery|T1049|\n|Collection: Email Collection: Email Forwarding Rule|T1114.003|\n|Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols|T1071.001|\n|Command and Control: Data Encoding: Standard Encoding|T1132.001|\n|Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol|T1048|\n|Exfiltration: Automated Exfiltration|T1020|\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix C — YARA Rule\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nInsikt Group is Recorded Future’s threat research division, comprising analysts and\nsecurity researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and intelligence\nagency experience.
