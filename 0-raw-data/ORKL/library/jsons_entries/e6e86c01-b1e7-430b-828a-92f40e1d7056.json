The campaign pivoted\nfrom distributing the Ursnif banking trojan in early messages to later distributing Adhubllka\n[ransomware, which encrypts files on compromised systems. While this campaign was widely](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/ransomware)\ndistributed across industries, construction, transportation, entertainment and media,\naerospace, and manufacturing were among the most commonly observed.\n\n[Proofpoint researchers believe this campaign is the work of TA547, an actor known for](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/danabot-new-banking-trojan-surfaces-down-under-0)\nabusing email service providers and distributing banking trojans across various geographic\nregions. This campaign is also the latest example of TA547 targeting Australians. A prior\n[effort included a ZLoader banking malware campaign disguised as job applicant emails.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/zloader-loads-again-new-zloader-variant-returns)\n\nIn this case over 2,000 messages were sent during July 12-14 with lures informing intended\nrecipients that their order “has been processed” and urging them to their view their “order\ndetails.” The subject lines contained “salesforce.com Order Confirmation” followed by a fake\norder number.\n\nThe messages contain Microsoft Excel attachments (Figure 1) or URLs linking to Excel\ndocuments hosted by an email service provider (Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Malicious Microsoft Excel attachment\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Link to malicious Excel document\n\nThe email lure with malware attached (Figure 1) is not particularly interesting or customized,\nbut the lure that contains a link to the malware (Figure 2) is a bit more creative. It contains a\nlure with branding for a construction workers’ resource group, which is notable because the\nconstruction industry was one of the sectors most targeted in this campaign.\n\nIn initial messages, the files used XL4 macros (Figure 3) to download Ursnif but shifted to\ndownloading Adhubllka ransomware on July 13 around 08:00am GMT (Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Excel document containing malicious macros\n\nThe pivot to delivering a new payload isn’t unusual on its own, but it is unclear why the actor\nswitched away from using highly valuable crimeware like Ursnif to Adhubllka ransomware.\n\nFigure 4: Ransomware note\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Ransomware payment page\n\nThe initial payment page for Adhubllka includes a link to a Freshdesk ticketing software\ninstance. The link is behind a URL shortener that collects the victim’s IP address if they visit\nthe link to report an issue. The actor might be suggesting the victim visit the ticketing site in a\nbrowser other than Tor because it isn’t a .onion link, but this could also be an attempt to\ncollect the victim’s unmasked IP address.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Ransomware payment portal\n\nThe ransom of $3,700 is requested in bitcoin, complete with a QR code to facilitate the\ntransaction. Instructions for creating a bitcoin wallet are found on the “How to get my files\nback” tab of the site.\n\nAs of this publication, the Tor site is still online, though no transactions involving associated\nbitcoin addresses appear to have taken place.\n\nThe techniques used in this campaign are not uncommon for TA547, but the mid-campaign\npayload switch is unusual. While the motivation for the switch isn’t immediately clear, it’s\npossible that the actor is experimenting with different payloads, or simply wants different\ntypes of infections at their disposal.\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
