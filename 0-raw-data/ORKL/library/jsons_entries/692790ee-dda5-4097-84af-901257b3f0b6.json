We partner with stakeholders across public and private sectors to raise\nawareness and find solutions to best tackle this important issue.\n\nStalkerware enables people to secretly spy on other people’s private lives via smart devices\nand is often used to facilitate psychological and physical violence against intimate partners.\nThe software is commercially available and can access an array of personal data, including\ndevice location, browser history, text messages, social media chats, photos and more. The\nmarketing of stalkerware is not illegal, but its use without the victim’s consent is. Perpetrators\nbenefit from this vague legal framework that still exists in many countries. Stalkerware is a\n\n\n-----\n\nbreach of privacy and a form of tech abuse. To address this complex threat in a\ncomprehensive way that best supports victims and survivors, innovative tools from a\nlegislative, social and technological point of view are needed.\n\n2021 data highlights\n\n**In 2021, Kaspersky’s data shows that 32,694 unique users were affected by**\n**[stalkerware globally. This is a decrease from our 2020 numbers and a historic low](https://securelist.com/the-state-of-stalkerware-in-2020/100875/)**\nsince we first started gathering data on stalkerware in 2018. While this could be seen\nas a reason for celebration, it is not.\n**Cyber-violence is on the rise, especially since the beginning of the pandemic. As**\npeople have continued to socialize less and spend more time at home, perpetrators\nfeel more in control, possibly making them less prone to installing stalkerware to spy on\ntheir partner. In addition, abusers, unfortunately, have a wider range of means, in the\nform of smart devices, to spy on or stalk their victims. Non-profit organizations (NPOs)\nwith which Kaspersky works closely have shared similar observations from working\nwith perpetrators and victims of stakerware. It is important to remember that these\nnumbers only include Kaspersky users: they do not take into account users who use\nthe IT security solutions of our competitors or those who do not have any IT security\nsolutions installed on their mobiles. Therefore, we see only the tip of the iceberg: while\nit is difficult to calculate the exact number of affected users in the world, members from\nthe [Coalition against Stalkerware estimate that it could be at least 30 times higher, with](https://stopstalkerware.org/)\nclose to one million victims globally, each year.\nBased on data obtained from the Kaspersky Security Network, the most affected\n**countries remain Russia, Brazil and the United States. This is in line with statistics**\nfrom the past two years. At the regional level, we find the highest numbers of affected\nusers in:\n\nGermany, Italy and the UK (Europe)\nTurkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia (Middle East and Africa)\nIndia, Indonesia and Vietnam (Asia-Pacific)\nBrazil, Mexico and Columbia (Latin America)\nThe United States (North America)\nThe Russian Federation, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (Russia and Central Asia)\n**Cerberus and Reptilicus were the most used stalkerware applications, with 5,575**\nand 4,417 affected users, respectively, globally.\n\n## Trends observed by Kaspersky\n\n### Methodology\n\nThe data in this report has been taken from aggregated threat statistics obtained from the\nKaspersky Security Network. The Kaspersky Security Network is dedicated to processing\ncybersecurity-related data streams from millions of volunteer participants around the world.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll received data is anonymized. To calculate our statistics, we review the consumer line of\nKaspersky’s mobile security solutions applying only the Coalition Against Stalkerware’s\ndetection criteria on stalkerware. This means that the affected number of users were targeted\nby stalkerware only. Other types of monitoring or spyware apps that fall outside of the\nCoalition’s definition are not included in our statistics.\n\nThe statistics reflect unique mobile users affected by stalkerware: this is different from the\nnumber of detections. The number of detections can be higher as we may detect stalkerware\nseveral times on the same device of the same unique user if they decided not to remove the\napp after receiving our notification.\n\nFinally, the statistics reflect only mobile users using Kaspersky’s IT security solutions. Some\nusers may use another cybersecurity solution on their devices, while some do not use any\nsolution at all.\n\n### Global detection figures: affected users\n\nIn this section, we highlight the global and regional numbers observed by Kaspersky in 2021\nand how they compare with those from previous years.\n\nIn 2021, a total of 32,694 single users were affected by stalkerware. The graphic below\nshows the evolution of affected users year on year since 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe graphic below shows unique affected users per month over the 2019-2021 period. We\ncan see that in 2021 the trend was more stable than in 2020, which saw a visible decrease\nduring the months most impacted by lockdowns and quarantine measures.\n\n### Global and regional detection figures: geography of affected users\n\nStalkerware continues to affect people across the world: in 2021, Kaspersky detected\naffected users in 185 countries or territories.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs in 2020, Russia, Brazil, the United States and India are, again, the top four countries with\nthe most identified single affected users. Interestingly, Mexico has fallen from fifth to ninth\nplace and Algeria, Turkey and Egypt have entered the top 10. They have replaced Italy, the\nUnited Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, which are no longer in the top 10 countries most affected\nby stalkerware.\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n1 Russian Federation 7541\n\n2 Brazil 4807\n\n3 United States of America 2319\n\n4 India 2105\n\n5 Germany 1012\n\n6 Iran (Islamic Republic of) 891\n\n7 Algeria 665\n\n8 Turkey 660\n\n9 Mexico 657\n\n10 Egypt 640\n\n**_Table 1 – 2021’s top 10 countries affected by stalkerware – globally_**\n\nIn this year’s report, we provide more detailed regional statistics with numbers for Europe,\nAsia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Russia and Central Asia and the Middle East\nand Africa.\n\nIn Europe, the total number of single affected users was 4,236 in 2021. Germany, Italy and\nthe United Kingdom rank at the top of the list, repeating their top rankings last year. Austria\nhas been replaced in the top 10 by Czechia.\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n1 Germany 1012\n\n2 Italy 611\n\n3 United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 430\n\n4 France 410\n\n5 Poland 321\n\n\n-----\n\n6 Spain 321\n\n7 Netherlands 165\n\n8 Romania 125\n\n9 Belgium 94\n\n10 Czechia 82\n\n**_Table 2 – 2021’s top 10 countries affected by stalkerware – Europe_**\n\nIn Russia and Central Asia, the total number of single affected users was 9,207. The top\nthree countries were Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n1 Russian Federation 7541\n\n2 Ukraine 490\n\n3 Kazakhstan 461\n\n4 Belarus 250\n\n5 Uzbekistan 223\n\n6 Azerbaijan 92\n\n7 Republic of Moldova 51\n\n8 Tajikistan 49\n\n9 Kyrgyzstan 40\n\n10 Turkmenistan 19\n\n**_Table 3 – Eastern Europe (excluding EU countries), Russia and Central Asia_**\n\nIn the Middle East and Africa region, the total number of affected users in the entire region\nwas 6,270 with Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia having the most affected users.\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n1 Turkey 660\n\n2 Egypt 640\n\n3 Saudi Arabia 575\n\n\n-----\n\n4 Kenya 271\n\n5 South Africa 240\n\n6 United Arab Emirates 143\n\n7 Nigeria 123\n\n8 Kuwait 68\n\n9 Oman 58\n\n10 Ethiopia 46\n\n**_Table 4 – 2021’s top 10 countries affected by stalkerware – Middle East and Africa_**\n\nIn APAC, the total number of affected users was 4,243. India was substantially ahead of\nother countries with 2,105 single users affected. It was followed by Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n1 India 2105\n\n2 Indonesia 353\n\n3 Vietnam 258\n\n4 Philippines 240\n\n5 Malaysia 229\n\n6 Australia 205\n\n7 Bangladesh 169\n\n8 Japan 167\n\n9 Pakistan 98\n\n10 Sri Lanka 83\n\n**_Table 5 – 2021’s top 10 countries affected by stalkerware – Asia Pacific_**\n\nThe Latin America and Caribbean region ranking was dominated by one country: Brazil,\nwhich represented 72.5% of the total number of affected users in the region (and accounts\nfor roughly 32% of the region’s population). Brazil was followed by Mexico and Colombia.\nThe entire region had 6,609 affected users.\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n\n-----\n\n1 Brazil 4807\n\n2 Mexico 657\n\n3 Colombia 202\n\n4 Ecuador 192\n\n5 Peru 179\n\n6 Argentina 90\n\n7 Chile 73\n\n8 Venezuela 58\n\n9 Bolivia 46\n\n10 Haiti 36\n\n**_Table 6 – 2021’s top 10 countries affected by stalkerware – Latin America_**\n\nFinally, in North America, the United States accounted for 87% of all affected users in the\nregion, which was expected given that its population is ten times larger than that of Canada.\nThe total number of affected users in North America, excluding Mexico which has been\nincluded with the Latin America data, is 2,666.\n\n**Country** **Affected users**\n\n1 United States of America 2319\n\n2 Canada 347\n\n**_Table 7 – 2021’s affected users by stalkerware – North America_**\n\n### Common functionalities of stalkerware applications\n\nThis section lists the stalkerware applications that are the most used to control mobile\ndevices on a global level. Cerberus and Reptilicus were the most used stalkerware\napplications with 5,575 and 4,417 affected users, respectively, globally.\n\n**Application name** **Affected users**\n\n1 Cerberus 5,575\n\n2 Reptilicus (aka Vkurse) 4,417\n\n3 Track My Phones 1,919\n\n\n-----\n\n4 AndroidLost 1,731\n\n5 MobileTracker Free 1670\n\n6 Hoverwatch 1,094\n\n7 wSpy 1,050\n\n**_Table 8 – 2021’s top list of stalkerware applications_**\n\nStalkerware applications can give tremendous power and access to its users, depending on\nthe applications and whether they are used in free or paying mode. Some of them are\nmarketed as anti-theft or parental control applications, however, they are different in many\nways, beginning with the fact that they work in stealth mode without the consent and\nknowledge of the victim.\n\nMost of the popular applications provide common stalkerware functionality such as:\n\nHiding app icon\nReading SMS, MMS and call logs\nGetting lists of contacts\nTracking GPS location\nTracking calendar events\nReading messages from popular messenger services and social networks, such as\nFacebook, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Viber, Instagram, Skype, Hangouts, Line, Kik,\nWeChat, Tinder, IMO, Gmail, Tango, SnapChat, Hike, TikTok, Kwai, Badoo, BBM,\nTextMe, Tumblr, Weico, Reddit etc.\nViewing photos and pictures from phones’ image galleries\nTaking screenshots\nTaking front (selfie-mode) camera photos\n\n### Are Android OS and iOS equally affected by stalkerware?\n\nStalkerware tools are less frequent on iPhones than Android devices because iOS is\ntraditionally a closed system. However, perpetrators can work around this limitation on\n[jailbroken iPhones, but they still require direct physical access to the phone to jailbreak it.](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/jailbreak/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\niPhone users who fear surveillance should always keep an eye on their device.\n\nAlternatively, an abuser can offer their victim an iPhone – or any other device – with preinstalled stalkerware. There are many companies that make these services available online,\nallowing abusers to have these tools installed on new phones, which can then be delivered in\nfactory packaging under the guise of a gift to the intended victim.\n\n## The use of stalkerware may be decreasing, but violence is not\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile we observe a decrease of 39% of affected users from our 2020 data, the fight against\nstalkerware and against cyber violence is far from over. The number of affected users and\nsome of the behaviors and perceptions around the use of stalkerware are still concerning. In\n[November 2021, Kaspersky commissioned a global survey of more than 21,000 participants](https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2021/11/17164103/Kaspersky_Digital-stalking-in-relationships_Report_FINAL.pdf)\nin 21 countries on their attitudes towards privacy and digital stalking in intimate relationships.\nWhile the majority of respondents (70%) do not believe it is acceptable to monitor their\npartner without consent, a significant share of people (30%) doesn’t see any issue with it and\nfind it acceptable under certain circumstances. Of those who think there are justifiable\nreasons for secret surveillance, almost two thirds would engage in the behavior if they\nbelieved their partner was being unfaithful (64%) or if it was related to their safety (63%) and\nhalf would if they believed their partner was involved in criminal activities (50%).\n\nHigh-speed internet in conjunction with the rapid spread of information and communication\ntechnology (ICT) has supported cyber-violence by creating another tool for abusers to share\nviolent and dangerous materials or engage in behaviors that affect emotional, psychological\nor physical damage. While these technologies have given people the ability to maintain\nsocial and emotional relationships across wide-ranging physical distances, ICT has also\nenabled cyber-violence – a consequence that’s far-reaching effects extend to the offline\nworld with real-life negative impacts on its victims.\n\nThe results of our survey corroborate this, with 15% of respondents worldwide being required\nby their partner to install a monitoring app and 34% of those also experiencing physical\nand/or verbal abuse by that intimate partner.\n\nWhile it is too early to make definitive conclusions on the decrease of affected users in 2021,\nthere are two theories that could explain this trend.\n\nFirstly, we believe that all aspects of our lives are still heavily impacted by the pandemic.\nRecent studies[1] show that new behaviors are emerging across areas of life such as work,\nlearning, home, consumption, communications and information, travel and mobility. In short,\npeople are staying at home more (49% avoid leaving their homes and 50% are working from\nhome partially or entirely), reducing face to face interactions (57% indicate that they are\nsocially distancing from friends and the community) and traveling, and shopping, educating\nand entertaining themselves increasingly online. From an abuser’s point of view, this could\nresult in less need to spy on their partner, who is now in their sight most of the time.\n\nSecondly, the Internet of Things (IoT) and digitization are now everywhere in our lives. It fills\nour daily routines and our homes, cars and offices. While the opportunities and advantages\n[are endless, many devices also enable tracking by third parties. Our research suggests that](https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2021/11/17164103/Kaspersky_Digital-stalking-in-relationships_Report_FINAL.pdf)\nperpetrators might also use other means, aside from stalkerware, to track their partners, with\n50% of respondents to our survey indicating that they have been tracked through phone\napps, another 29% mentioning they had been traced through tracking devices, 22% through\nwebcams and 18% through smart home devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nApple s recent January 2022 publication of a safety manual for its AirTag product marks a\nshift in the perception of the situation.\n\nNNEDV, the National Network to End Domestic Violence and WWP EN, the European\nNetwork for the Work with Perpetrators of Domestic Violence share with us their experience\nand views on these two theories and on tech abuse in general.\n\n**How measures imposed by governments during the pandemic facilitated and**\n**reinforced perpetrators’ coercive control –** _Berta Vall Castelló, Research and_\n_Development manager and Anna McKenzie, Communications manager at WWP EN_\n\n_[The European Network for the Work With Perpetrators of domestic violence (WWP EN) is a](https://www.work-with-perpetrators.eu/)_\n_membership association of organisations directly or indirectly working with people who_\n_perpetrate violence in close relationships. The main focus of WWP EN is violence_\n_perpetrated by men against women and children. The mission of WWP EN is to improve the_\n_safety of women and their children and others at risk from violence in close relationships,_\n_through the promotion of effective work with those who perpetrate this violence, mainly men._\n\nCoercive control is defined as “a pattern of abusive behavior designed to exercise\ndomination and control over the other party to a relationship. It can include a range of\nabusive behaviors – physical, psychological, emotional or financial – the cumulative effect of\nwhich over time robs victim-survivors of their autonomy and independence as an individual”\n(McGorrery and McMahon, 2020). As we write in our manual “Same Violence, New Tools –\nHow to work with violent men who use cyberviolence,” perpetrators isolate their partners and\nmake them emotionally dependent. They use assaults, threats, intimidation, humiliation,\nisolation and more to create a constant sense of fear, as well as a general loss of a sense of\nfreedom. ICT technologies are powerful tools for perpetrators exerting coercive control,\nespecially in relationships where violence is already present offline.\n\nA recent review on domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic found that the\nmeasures imposed by the government during lockdown facilitate and reinforce perpetrators’\ncoercive control. The authors suggested that the conditions of isolation/physical distancing\nimposed by the governments overlap with coercive control strategies used by perpetrators to\ncontrol their partners (Pentaraki and Speake, 2020). Considering these results, it seems\nlikely that perpetrators feel less of a “need” to use stalkerware to exert coercive control over\ntheir partners. Moreover, recent research has observed that technology-facilitated abuse\noften escalates during a period of separation (George and Harris 2014; Woodlock 2016).\nTherefore, during a lockdown situation where couples were forced to stay together at home,\nthey are less likely to use technology-facilitated abuse.\n\nWe must remember that a decrease in the use of stalkerware does not equal a decrease in\noverall intimate partner violence (IPV) during the pandemic. On the contrary, Boxall, Morgan\nand Brown (2020) note that IPV has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore,\nthe results in this report indicate that stalkerware has been replaced with other tools. As\n\n\n-----\n\nElena Gajotto, from Italian NGO Una Casa per l Uomo, remarks: It is so easy to monitor and\ntrack someone, for example by using their Google account, that you don’t really need to use\nstalkerware.” The wide variety of possible technology-facilitated abuse might have had an\nimpact on the decrease in the use of stalkerware specifically. Letizia Baroncelli, from Italian\nNGO Centro Ascolto Uomini Malttratanti (CAM), agrees and adds: “I think we see less\nstalkerware because there are so many other forms of perpetrating digital abuse.”\n\nHowever, NGOs, governments and researchers have reported a substantial increase in\nimage-based abuse and sextortion since the start of the pandemic (Boniello, 2020; CCRI,\npersonal communication, June 2, 2020; FBI, 2020, 2021). It seems that this type of\ntechnology-facilitated abuse has escalated, especially among teenagers and couples who do\nnot live together. As Letizia Baroncelli notes: “Sharing personal pictures has increased a lot\nsince the pandemic, especially among young perpetrators. They do not understand that they\nare committing a crime.” As Elena Gajotto adds: “Image-based abuse causes devastating\nharm to the women who experience it, while the men don’t even understand that they did\nsomething bad.”\n\nSeveral WWP EN members have shared that the most common form of digital violence is\nmen monitoring their partners’ digital activities, e.g. by checking emails, phones and social\naccounts. This is in line with observations from Daniel Antunovic, from Croatian NGO UZOR,\nwho agrees that the ‘primitive’ forms of digital stalking are the ones he sees most often.\n\nAt WWP EN, we consider it key to focus on tech-facilitated abuse to ensure victim safety.\nElena Gajotto adds: “Around half of the men share their digital violence, without realizing that\nthis is abuse. If we don’t explicitly focus on this violence in our work with perpetrators, it\ndoesn’t come up.” Therefore, there is a need to increase the capacity of professionals\nworking with perpetrators and professionals working with victims of domestic violence to\nscreen for and intervene in cases of digital violence. As Daniel Antunovic adds: “We haven’t\nencountered as many cases of digital violence as I expected since COVID-19. However,\ntechnology-facilitated abuse is in some ways like sexualized violence. It happens a lot, but it\nremains hidden.”\n\n**There is a growing rate of “smart devices” used in intimate partner violence –** _Toby_\n_Shulruff, Tech Safety Project Manager at NNEDV_\n\n_[NNEDVs Safety Net Project focuses on the intersection of technology, privacy, confidentiality,](https://nnedv.org/content/technology-safety/)_\n_and innovation, as it relates to safety and abuse by advocating for policies, educating and_\n_training advocates and professionals in the justice system, and working with communities,_\n_agencies, and technology companies to respond to technology abuse, support survivors in_\n_their use of tech, and harness tech to improve services._\n\nWhile stalkerware is a common concern, there are many other tools available for tech abuse\nthat may appear to be stalkerware, but are not. For example, personal information available\nonline and the everyday features of devices and accounts can be used to find a person’s\n\n\n-----\n\nlocation or track their activity. The complexity and connections between devices, accounts,\nand information on the internet can make it difficult for victims and those who work with them\nto assess what’s happening, and to implement an effective response. It can be terrifying and\noverwhelming for a survivor to realize an abuser knows multiple details about their everyday\nlives.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a growing rate of “smart” devices— including home assistants,\nconnected appliances, and security systems connected to WiFi networks and smartphones—\nused in intimate partner violence.\n\nIn a [survey conducted by the NNEDV in December 2020 and January 2021, responses](https://www.techsafety.org/blog/2021/10/7/tech-abuse-in-the-pandemic-amp-beyond-reflections-from-the-field-2021)\nrevealed an increase in every type of tech abuse during the pandemic. While phones are the\ntechnology most often misused, NNEDV’s needs assessment shows this to be the case 87%\nof the time, “smart” or connected devices were also identified as technologies that are\nincreasingly misused in the context of tech abuse, seen regularly by about a third of support\nprofessionals.\n\nAs more people adopt the use of IoT devices, this will likely grow. These products are\nintended to increase convenience and efficiency. The manufacture of IoT devices is a rapidly\nemerging global market with both larger, well-established players as well as many smaller,\nnewer companies[2]. IoT is made possible by several overlapping trends in technology:\nminiaturization, increased processing capacity, increased data storage, decreased cost of\nmanufacturing, and connectivity.\n\n\nDue to a variety of factors – market pressures, the rapid emergence of the technology, and\nthe complexity of the IoT – profound risks to security and privacy are increasingly apparent[3].\nSmart home devices in particular are being misused in the context of intimate partner\nviolence to control, threaten, and cause harm to victims. [Researchers at the Gender + IoT\nproject at University College London[4] have been exploring these harms] [and proposing\nremedies in partnership with support professionals in the field.]\n\nNNEDV’s recent needs assessment documented increases in tech abuse tactics throughout\nthe pandemic. We are concerned that as we emerge from this public health crisis, abusers\nwho have adopted these tactics or have increased their misuse of technology during this\ntime will not have any incentive to discontinue this form of abuse. Recent research[5]\nsuggests support professionals should ask about all kinds of tech abuse, including\nstalkerware and smart home devices. There is a strong likelihood the spike in tech abuse\nsupport professionals have seen will stay with us. It’s imperative we continue to support\nvictims, and work to prevent technology abuse.\n\n## How Kaspersky and its partners are collaborating to fight stalkerware\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat of stalkerware is not just a technical problem: all parts of society need to be\ninvolved in resolving the issue. For the past few years, Kaspersky has been at the forefront\nof the stalkerware debate. We are reaching out to public and private stakeholders to better\nunderstand this issue and find common solutions. We are contributing to the development of\ntraining materials and practical tools to support non-profit organizations, corporations,\ninstitutions and individuals with developing resilience to stalkerware. We are organizing and\nparticipating in webinars and roundtables with institutions to share our voices and contribute\nto discussions that will shape tomorrow’s legislation.\n\nKaspersky is one of the co-founders and drivers of the Coalition Against Stalkerware\n**(CAS) – an international working group dedicated to tackling stalkerware and combating**\ndomestic violence. The Coalition brings together organizations that work with victims and\nabusers, digital activists and cybersecurity vendors. It is a unique platform that enables all\nrelevant stakeholders to share best practices and join forces to tackle the issue of\nstalkerware.\n\n[Kaspersky is also one of the partners of the DeStalk project. Funded by the European](https://www.work-with-perpetrators.eu/destalk)\nCommission, this research project aims to develop a strategy to train and support\nprofessionals working in victims support services and perpetrator programmes, officers of\ninstitutions and local governments along with other relevant groups. The consortium plans to\nupgrade and test existing tools for practitioners and is developing a regional pilot awareness\ncampaign in Italy.\n\nIn 2021, we teamed up with INTERPOL and two respected non-profit organizations from the\nUS and Australia to provide law enforcement officials with two online training sessions.\nThese courses were attended by over 210 participants from around the world.\n\nAt the end of 2021, Kaspersky also participated in an event, “Combating violence against\nwomen in a digital age – utilising the Istanbul Convention”, organized by the Council of\nEurope. This event was an opportunity to discuss the recommendations of the Group of\nExperts on combating violence against women and domestic violence (GREVIO).\n\n### TinyCheck: a tool to support victims of domestic violence\n\n[Kaspersky’s work with the TinyCheck tool is an initiative worth highlighting. It is a free, open-](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/TinyCheck)\nsource tool developed and supported by Kaspersky. Initially created to help NPOs protect\nvictims of domestic violence and their privacy, TinyCheck facilitates the detection of\nstalkerware on victims’ devices and on any OS in a simple, quick and non-invasive way\nwithout making the perpetrator aware. While security solutions can also check for and alert\nabout stalkerware, they need to be installed on the device, so there is a risk of the\nperpetrator also being alerted. Developments like the TinyCheck tool aim to ensure that\nsurvivors can use their devices without concerns about being surveilled.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith TinyCheck, no application needs to be installed on the device to perform the check, and\nthe results of the check are not displayed on or transmitted to the potentially infected device.\nIn addition, TinyCheck allows victims to check any device regardless of whether it uses iOS,\nAndroid or another OS. These features address the two major issues in the fight to protect\nusers against stalkerware. The tool has been developed to run on a Raspberry Pi, using a\nregular Wi-Fi connection. TinyCheck quickly analyzes a mobile device’s outgoing traffic and\nidentifies Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), such as interactions with known malicious\nsources like stalkerware-related servers. Currently, the tool uses IOCs collected not only by\nKaspersky researchers but also by repositories maintained by independent security\nresearchers (special thanks to Etienne Maynier, also known as Tek, from [Echap and](https://echap.eu.org/) Cian\nHeasley). We hope that the community will continue this work by keeping IOCs up-to-date.\n\nHaving said that, the limitations of TinyCheck need to be understood. The tool should be\nused with the following warning in mind: IOCs do not provide complete real-time detection of\n[all stalkerware apps like an IT Security solution does. Therefore, a result detecting no](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/stalkerware-detection-tactics/)\nstalkerware does not exclude the possibility that stalkerware has been installed but not\ndetected by TinyCheck.\n\nIn 2021, more NPOs in the field of domestic violence tested TinyCheck and provided\nfeedback to help improve the service. Police forces and judicial bodies in several countries\nhave also taken an interest in the tool to better support victims.\n\n## 2021 has seen positive developments on the regulatory and institutional fronts\n\nAcross the world, 2021 has seen some positive developments in the fight against\nstalkerware from a regulatory and institutional point of view. In May 2021, the Diet, Japan’s\n[parliament, enacted a bill to amend their stalker regulation law. Under the revised law, in](https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2021051800656/)\naddition to other stipulations, obtaining location information of people’s smartphones through\napps without their authorization is now illegal.\n\n[In August 2021, the Federal Trade Commission in the United States barred one app maker](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-finalizes-order-banning-stalkerware-provider-spyware-business)\nfrom offering stalkerware. It was the first ban of its kind.\n\nOn August 17, 2021, the German Bundestag passed the “Act to Amend the Criminal Code –\nMore Effective Combating of Stalking and Better Coverage of Cyberstalking” (translated from\nGerman). The new law entered into force on October 1, 2021, and now includes\ncyberstalking in their catalog of offenses. The change is because of continued technological\nprogress and the associated increase in cyberstalking, particularly via stalking apps or\nstalkerware. In addition, an important part of the new law is that it classifies a case as\nserious if the offender “in the course of an offense, uses a computer program whose purpose\nis the digital spying on other persons.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Council of Europe has been very active on this topic in 2021. In its first recommendation\n[on the “digital dimension” of violence against women, the Council of Europe’s Group of](https://rm.coe.int/grevio-rec-no-on-digital-violence-against-women/1680a49147)\nExperts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO)\ndefines and outlines the problems of both gender-based violence against women committed\nonline and technology-enabled attacks against women, such as legally obtainable tracking\ndevices that enable perpetrators to stalk their victims. This was shortly followed in December\n2021 by a legislative initiative report on gender-based cyberviolence that was adopted by the\nEuropean Parliament. The report calls for (i) a common definition of gender-based\ncyberviolence and (ii) capacity building for stakeholders. It highlights stalkerware among the\nkey methods of cyberviolence and “dismisses the notion that stalkerware applications can be\nconsidered parental control applications”. Following the general recommendations of the\nCouncil of Europe, this report, although non-binding, is another positive official document\nhighlighting the stalkerware issue and pushing European states to adapt their legislations\nand actions to counter the issue. Finally, on March 8, 2022, the European Commissionth\npublished a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on\ncombating violence against women and domestic violence. The document covers cyber\nviolence and dedicates two articles to cyber stalking (Art 8) and cyber harassment (Art 9)\nthat it proposes to criminalize.\n\n## Think you are a victim of stalkerware? Here are a few tips\n\nWhether or not you are a victim of stalkerware, here are a few tips if you want to better\nprotect yourself:\n\nProtect your phone with a strong password that you never share with your partner,\nfriends or colleagues\nChange passwords for all of your accounts periodically and don’t share them with\nanyone\nOnly download apps from official sources, such as Google Play or the Apple App Store\nInstall a reliable IT security solution like Kaspersky Internet Security for Android on\ndevices and scan them regularly. However, in the case of potentially already installed\nstalkerware, this should only be done after the risk to the victim has been assessed, as\nthe abuser may notice the use of a cybersecurity solution.\n\nVictims of stalkerware may be victims of a larger cycle of abuse, including physical. In some\ncases, the perpetrator is notified if their victim performs a device scan or removes a\nstalkerware app. If this happens, it can lead to an escalation of the situation and further\naggression. This is why it is important to proceed with caution if you think you are being\ntargeted by stalkerware.\n\n**Reach out to a local support organization: to find one close to you, check the**\n[Coalition Against Stalkerware website.](https://stopstalkerware.org/resources/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Keep an eye out for the following warning signs: these can include a fast-draining**\nbattery due to unknown or suspicious apps using up its charge and newly-installed\napplications with suspicious access to use and track your location, send or receive text\nmessages and other personal activities. Also check if your “unknown sources” setting is\nenabled, it may be a sign that unwanted software has been installed from a third party\nsource. It is important to note that the above signs are only symptoms of possible\nstalkerware installation, not a definitive indication.\n**Do not try to erase the stalkerware, change any settings or tamper with your**\n**phone: this may alert your potential perpetrator and lead to an escalation of the**\nsituation. You also risk erasing important data or evidence that could be used in a\nprosecution.\n\n[1] https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/consumer-markets/library/covid-19-consumer\nbehavior-survey.html;\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/how%20covid\n[%2019%20is%20changing%20consumer%20behavior%20now%20and%20forever/how-](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/how%20covid%2019%20is%20changing%20consumer%20behavior%20now%20and%20forever/how-covid-19-is-changing-consumer-behaviornow-and-forever.pdf)\ncovid-19-is-changing-consumer-behaviornow-and-forever.pdf;\n\n\n\n[2] Internet Society.
