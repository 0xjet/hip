Considering the high-profile nature of all the victims we discovered, it\nis likely they were of interest to several APT groups,\" Dedola added.\n\n\"Moreover, despite the occasional proximity in staging locations, we have no concrete\nevidence of the two malware families directly interacting (for instance, one deploying the\nother), and the specific directories are frequently used by multiple attackers.\n\n\"The affected organizations, both governmental and military, show that this group is focused\non very high-profile targets and is probably used to achieve critical goals, likely related to\ngeopolitical interests.\"\n\nAdditional technical details on the malware used by and indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n[linked to ToddyCat can be found in Kaspersky's report.](https://securelist.com/toddycat/106799/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Evilnum hackers return in new operation targeting migration orgs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evilnum-hackers-return-in-new-operation-targeting-migration-orgs/)\n\n[Microsoft Exchange bug abused to hack building automation systems](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-exchange-bug-abused-to-hack-building-automation-systems/)\n\n[Chinese hacking group Aoqin Dragon quietly spied orgs for a decade](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hacking-group-aoqin-dragon-quietly-spied-orgs-for-a-decade/)\n\n[Bitter cyberspies target South Asian govts with new malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitter-cyberspies-target-south-asian-govts-with-new-malware/)\n\n[Cyberspies use IP cameras to deploy backdoors, steal Exchange emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberspies-use-ip-cameras-to-deploy-backdoors-steal-exchange-emails/)\n\n[APT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt/)\n[Asia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/asia/)\n[Europe](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/europe/)\n[Hacking Group](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hacking-group/)\n[Microsoft Exchange](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft-exchange/)\n[Ninja Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ninja-trojan/)\n[Samurai](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/samurai/)\n[ToddyCat](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/toddycat/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
