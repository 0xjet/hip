Zebrocy is mainly used against governments and commercial](https://analyze.intezer.com/families/2196bcb4-94b0-4773-beb6-87900b338521)\norganizations engaged in foreign affairs. The lures consisted of documents about\nSinopharm International Corporation—a pharmaceutical company that COVID-19 vaccine is\ncurrently going through phase three clinical trials—and an impersonated evacuation letter\nfrom Directorate General of Civil Aviation\n\n\n-----\n\nThe lure was delivered as part of a Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) file that requires victims to use\nWindows 10 to access the files. While the malware samples were heavily obfuscated, it was\n[possible to attribute them to the Sofacy threat actor since they shared genomes with](https://analyze.intezer.com/families/4b0df7b0-b079-4a21-a72d-a35efabef6d8)\nsamples used in previous campaigns.\n\nIt appears that the threat actor switched from delivering VHD files with the Delphi version of\nZebrocy, to the Go version in the middle of November. Given that many COVID-19 vaccines\nare about to be approved for clinical use, it’s likely that APTs (Advanced Persistent Threat)\nand financially motivated threat actors will use this malware in their attacks.\n\n## Zebrocy Evolution\n\n[Zebrocy is a malware used by the threat group Sofacy, also known as Sednit, APT28,](https://analyze.intezer.com/families/2196bcb4-94b0-4773-beb6-87900b338521)\nFancy Bear, and STRONTIUM. Sofacy was one of the groups [indicted by the Department of](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/grand-jury-indicts-12-russian-intelligence-officers-hacking-offenses-related-2016-election)\nJustice (DOJ) for the compromise of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The\n[Zebrocy toolset was first reported by Kaspersky Labs as part of theirAPT Trends report in](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2017/79332/)\n[2017. The malware was first used in2015 and overlapped with known Sofacy infrastructure](https://securelist.com/zebrocys-multilanguage-malware-salad/90680/)\nat the time. Zebrocy operates as a downloader and collects information about the infected\nhost that is uploaded to the command and control (C&C) server before downloading and\nexecuting the next stage.\n\nThe first version of the downloader was written in Delphi and was based on aprevious\nmalware used by Sofacy. One unique aspect of the operators behind Zebrocy is their choice\nof evolving the malware. Instead of improving their codebase to add new functionalities and\nincrease their chance of staying undetected, the group has opted to keep the malware\nsimple by implementing new versions in different programming languages. Zebrocy\nsamples written in AutoIT, C++, C#, Delphi, Go, and VB.NET have been [discovered by the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\n[research community.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/sofacy-creates-new-go-variant-of-zebrocy-tool/)\n\nWhile Zebrocy is known to be used by a subset of the Sofacy threat group, Kaspersky Labs\n[reported in January 2019 that they had discovered infrastructure used both by Zebrocy and](https://securelist.com/greyenergys-overlap-with-zebrocy/89506/)\n[GreyEnergy. GreyEnergy was discovered by ESET and reported on inOctober 2018. The](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ESET_GreyEnergy.pdf)\ngroup is believed to be the successor of BlackEnergy, also known as Sandworm.\nSandworm was recently attributed to Russia’s GRU by the United States government in an\n[indictment for the NotPetya and Olympic Destroyer campaigns. Generally speaking, Sofacy](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and)\nand BlackEnergy have diverging goals and have been known to go after different targets. In\nthis case, the common infrastructure and targets between the Sofacy subgroup using\nZebrocy and GreyEnergy suggests a relationship between the groups.\n\n[Zebrocy is mainly used againstgovernments and commercial organizations engaged](https://securelist.com/masha-and-these-bears/84311/)\n[inforeign affairs. Victims have been locatedin: “Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks)\nHerzegovina, China, Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyzstan,\n\n\n-----\n\nMongolia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan,\nUkraine, Uruguay, and Zimbabwe.” The delivery of Zebrocy is usually via a spear[phishingemail. The email has contained Microsoft Office documents or archive files.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/)\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nAt the end of November, we discovered a Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) file\n(a7b446d79d3fc05a7e1881d6d4abaf55) named 30-22-243.vhd that was uploaded from\nAzerbaijan to VirusTotal. VHD is the native file format for virtual hard drives used by\nMicrosoft’s hypervisor, Hyper-V. Windows 10 has native support for the file format and\nallows the user to mount the file and access its content. Figure 1 shows what the user\nwould see if they downloaded the file to their desktop. According to timestamps stored in\nthe file, the disk was created on November 20, 2020, 10 days before it was uploaded to\nVirusTotal.\n\n_Figure 1: VHD phishing lure._\n\nIf the user double-clicks on the file, Windows will mount the drive and it appears as an\nexternal hard drive. Figure 2 shows the content of the VHD.\n\n_Figure 2: Content of the VHD file. It contains two files: A PDF file and an executable that is_\n_masquerading as a Microsoft Word document._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe VHD file includes two files, a PDF document and an executable that is masquerading\nas a Microsoft Word document. The PDF file consists of presentation slides about\n_Sinopharm International Corporation. Figure 3 displays a screenshot of the first slide._\n\n_Figure 3: PDF of presentation slides used as part of the lure._\n\nSinopharm International Corporation is a China-based manufacturer of pharmaceutical\nproducts. It is one of the companies in China that is currently working on a vaccine for\n[COVID-19. Their vaccine is currently undergoingphase three clinical trials but it has already](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-coronavirus-drug-vaccine-status/)\n[beengiven to nearly one million people. It may not come as a surprise that the threat group](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-sinopharm/china-sinopharms-coronavirus-vaccine-taken-by-about-a-million-people-in-emergency-use-idUKKBN27Z0PS)\nbehind Zebrocy is using COVID-19-themed related lures when many vaccines are about to\nget approved for use. The group is known to usecurrent events as part of their phishing\nlures.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second file is the malware. By default, Windows hides known file extensions and the\nuser can be easily tricked into believing that it’s a Word document. The scan results of the\n[executable from VirusTotal is shown in Figure 4 and Intezer Analyze in Figure 5. Only nine](https://analyze.intezer.com/)\nof the 70 antivirus engines detected the file as generic malware while Analyze detected the\nfile as malware associated with Sofacy.\n\n_Figure 4: VirusTotal scan results of the binary file with generic detection._\n\n_Figure 5: Intezer Analyze detects the file as genetically similar to malware used by Sofacy_\n_one year ago._\nThe malware is a new sample of Zebrocy written in Go. Earlier this year,\n[QuoIntelligence detected an ongoing campaign by Sofacy, assessing with medium-high](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/09/apt28-zebrocy-malware-campaign-nato-theme/)\nconfidence that the group was targeting Azerbaijan. In that campaign, the Delphi version\nwas used. It appears that the threat group has now switched from delivering the Delphi\ndownloader to the Go downloader.\n\n[The downloader is similar to the original downloader reported byPalo Alto Networks Unit 42.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/sofacy-creates-new-go-variant-of-zebrocy-tool/)\n[The sample has been obfuscated with gobfuscator, the same tool used by the](https://github.com/unixpickle/gobfuscate)\n[Blackrota malware The sample doesn’t collect the same amount of information about the](https://blog.netlab.360.com/blackrota-an-obfuscated-backdoor-written-in-go-en/)\n\n\n-----\n\ninfected machine (i.e., running processes, local disk information, and system information\nfrom “systeminfo”) as in previous campaigns. Instead, it collects the hostname and the path\nto the user’s TEMP folder. This information is used to generate an identifier by hashing the\nvalues with MD5. The screenshot functionality is not performed by an imported third-party\nlibrary. Rather, the malware author has included the screenshot code from the library\ndirectly in the main codebase. The malware has some anti-debugging checks. In Figure 6, it\ncan be seen how the malware calls the Windows API function IsDebuggerPresent. If true\nis returned, it enters an infinite sleeping loop.\n\n_Figure 6: Logic that checks if the process is being debugged. If true, it enters a sleeping_\n_loop._\n\nThe screenshot is uploaded to the C&C located at the URL: hxxps://support**cloud[.]life/managment/cb-secure/technology.php. If the C&C returns a second stage,**\nthe file is written to the disk and executed. The URL scheme for the C&C is similar to the\n[URL scheme used in the originalGo version (hxxp://89.37.226[.]148/technet-](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/sofacy-creates-new-go-variant-of-zebrocy-tool/)\n**support/library/online-service-description php) The domain name was registered with**\n\n\n-----\n\nNameCheap on October 20, 2020, and uses a certificate issued by Let s Encrypt. The\ncertificate was issued on November 2, 2020. The infrastructure is hosted on\n**80.90.39.24 which is owned by the Luxembourg-based hosting company, Visual Online.**\nThe infrastructure appears to be new.\n\n## Earlier Campaigns\n\nUsing the icon resource from the original phishing lure, we found another phishing lure\n(395e166af5197967503f45c3ac134ff7) that was uploaded to VirusTotal from Kazakhstan on\nNovember 12. This VHD file was named No.243.CB3-EVACUATION LETTER.vhd. The\ncontent of the file is shown in Figure 7.\n\n_Figure 7: Content of No.243.CB3-EVACUATION LETTER.vhd. The disk file includes an_\n_executable file and a PDF file._\n\nThe executable is another Go version of Zebrocy. It uses the same C&C URL. The sample\nis obfuscated using the same technique the group has used for their prior versions. The\nfunction names have been mangled and the strings have been obfuscated. In this version,\nthe strings are obfuscated by rotating the characters in the string one step. For example,\n**A has been rotated to B.**\n\n[The PDF file is corrupted. This is not the first time the group is usingcorrupt files as part of](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/sednit-whats-going-zebrocy/)\n[its lures. CorruptMicrosoft Excel files were used in the campaign uncovered by](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/09/apt28-zebrocy-malware-campaign-nato-theme/)\nQuoIntelligence earlier this year. The technique is likely used to trick the user into executing\nthe application rather than just viewing the lure.\n\nBased on the file name, one theory we have is a message from India’s Directorate General\n[of Civil Aviation is being impersonated. It was announced in August that a flight network](https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/will-develop-flight-network-to-russia-central-asian-countries-in-next-few-months-indigo-official/1920413)\nbetween India, Russia, and other Central Asian countries was being developed. While India\n\n\n-----\n\nhas suspended international flights due to the pandemic, some airlines have operated\ncharter flights to “Russia, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.”\n\nIt turns out the same VHD file was uploaded in October to VirusTotal with different content\n(855005fee45e71c36a466527c7fad62f); both samples share the same disk ID. The content\nof this sample is shown in Figure 8. As with the other VHD files, this also has a PDF file and\nan executable masquerading as a Microsoft Word Document. Instead of delivering the Go\nversion of Zebrocy, the Delphi loader was used.\n\n_Figure 8: Content of VHD uploaded to VirusTotal in October._\n\nThe PDF lure is written in Russian. The title is, according to Google Translate: “NATIONAL\nLIST INDIVIDUALS AND LEGAL ENTITIES INVOLVED IN TERRORIST AND EXTREMIST\nACTIVITIES OR THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.” The\ncontent of the first page is shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Redacted screenshot of PDF lure written in Russian._\n\nAccording to timestamps, the VHD was created on October 21, the day after the domain\n(support-cloud[.]life) was registered. The domain was used in a spear-phishing attack\nagainst a Kazakhstan government ministry the same day. The VHD file was uploaded to\nVirusTotal the next day. On November 11, the same VHD file was reused but the lure and\npayload were changed. This version of the VHD was uploaded to VirusTotal the next day.\nBy applying this logic to the VHD file used to deliver the Sinopharm-based lure, we can\nestimate that it was used around November 20.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nZebrocy is a malware toolset used by the Sofacy threat group. While the group keeps\nchanging obfuscation and delivery techniques, code reuse allowed Intezer to detect and\ncorrectly classify this malware. With these recent phishing lures, it’s clear that COVID-19\nthemed attacks are still a threat and we might see more as vaccines become available to\nthe general public.\n\nIt’s important that companies use defense-in-depth strategies to protect against threats.\nEmployers should also ensure employees are trained on detecting and reacting to phishing\nattempts. Phishing attempts do not always originate from an external email address; they\ncan also come from a compromised account within the enterprise.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IoCs\n\n Network\n\nhxxps://support-cloud[.]life/managment/cb-secure/technology.php\n\n## VHD files\n\nd5d9210ef49c6780016536b0863cc50f6de03f73e70c2af46cc3cff0e2bf9353 301868.vhd\n43c65d87d690aea7c515fe84317af40b7e64b350304b0fc958a51d62826feade 30-22243.vhd\nd444fde5885ec1241041d04b3001be17162523d2058ab1a7f88aac50a6059bc0\nNo.243.CB3-EVACUATION LETTER.vhd\n\n## Zebrocy\n\nf36a0ee7f4ec23765bb28fbfa734e402042278864e246a54b8c4db6f58275662\n243_BIO_SINOPHARM.exe\n61c2e524dcc25a59d7f2fe7eff269865a3ed14d6b40e4fea33b3cd3f58c14f19\n243.CB3.EVACUATION LETTER.exe\n6449d0cb1396d6feba7fb9e25fb20e9a0a5ef3e8623332844458d73057cf04a1 301868 20.10.2020.exe\n\n**Joakim Kennedy**\nDr. Joakim Kennedy is a Security Researcher analyzing malware and tracking threat actors\non a daily basis.
