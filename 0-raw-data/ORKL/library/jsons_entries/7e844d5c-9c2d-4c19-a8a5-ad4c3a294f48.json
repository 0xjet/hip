We recommend you upgrade to\n[the latest available release (2020.2.5) as soon as is practical. For more information, review the Release Notes here, and KB article](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/content/release_notes/orion_platform_2020-2-5_release_notes.htm) [here.](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Remote-Code-Execution-CVE-Frequently-Asked-Questions?language=en_US)\n\nIf you have recently upgraded to 2020.2.1 HF2 or 2019.4 HF 6, you are also protected from SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA. However, as\npart of our response to the [SUNBURST vulnerability, the code-signing certificate used by SolarWinds to sign the affected software versions](https://www.solarwinds.com/sa-overview/securityadvisory)\nwas revoked March 8, 2021, and you may experience performance issues if you do not apply the more recent updates. Please visit our\n**[SolarWinds New Digital Code-Signing Certificate page atsolarwinds.com/trust-center/new-digital-certificate for more information.](https://www.solarwinds.com/sa-overview/new-digital-certificate)**\n\n**QUESTION 2**\n\n_Recent as of 4/6/2021_\n\n**Am I safe if I disconnect my Orion server from the internet?**\n\nDisconnecting any product from the internet can reduce your attack surface. The Orion Platform is fully functional without an internet\nconnection. Based on our investigations to date, SUNBURST requires an internet connection to be activated and disconnecting your Orion\nserver from the internet should immediately protect your environment from SUNBURST. The vulnerability in the product that allows for the\ndeployment of SUPERNOVA, however, may still be exploited by a malicious actor who accesses your network from inside and not over the\ninternet. Disconnecting from the internet will limit the ability of an external actor exploiting this vulnerability over an internet connection.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: Disconnecting from the internet is not a recommended substitute for upgrading your Orion software to versions 2019.4.2,**\n2020.2.4, or 2020.2.5, or applying appropriate patches to older versions if a full upgrade is not possible at this time.\n\n**QUESTION 3**\n\n_Recent as of 4/6/2021_\n\n**How has SolarWinds addressed SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA?**\n\nWe have:\n\nremoved the software builds known to be affected by SUNBURST from our download sites;\nprovided software updates, which include security enhancements, that are designed to address both SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA in\nsupported versions of the Orion server; and\nprovided a fix for customers on unsupported versions further described below.\n\n**RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**\n\n[As part of our response to the SUNBURST vulnerability, the code-signing certificate used by SolarWinds to sign the affected software versions](https://www.solarwinds.com/sa-overview/securityadvisory)\nwas revoked March 8, 2021. Please visit our SolarWinds New Digital Code-Signing Certificate page atsolarwinds.com/trust-center/newdigital-certificate for more information.\n\nWe strongly encourage customers to upgrade their Orion products to the latest versions available in the Customer Portal at\n[customerportal.solarwinds.com that are designed to protect you from SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA. Doing so allows you to the get the full](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/)\nbenefit of our updates, improvements, and enhancements.\n\nIf you have already upgraded to 2020.2.5, additional security fixes and protections unrelated to SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA are\n[included in this version.

have determined that Orion Platform version 2019.4 unpatched, released in October 2019,\ncontained test modifications to the code base. While this version is not impacted by the SUNBURST vulnerability, it is the first version in which\nwe have seen activity from the attacker at this time. Subsequent releases 2019.4 HF 1, 2019.4 HF 2, 2019.4 HF 3, and 2019.4 HF 4 did not\ninclude either test modifications contained in the 2019.4 version or the SUNBURST vulnerability contained in 2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 unpatched,\nand 2020.2 HF 1.\n\n** [If you apply a SUPERNOVA security patch per the above chart, please visit this KB article to validate the patch was applied to all Orion](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Use-a-script-to-verify-that-the-Supernova-patch-was-applied-to-all-Orion-web-servers?language=en_US)\nPlatform web servers. If you reinstall your Orion server, you will need to reapply the respective patch.\n\n***** If you used the SUPERNOVA Mitigation Script to address the Supernova vulnerability, use the guidance in the document within that**\npackage to confirm the temporary patch.

While this version is not impacted by the SUNBURST vulnerability, it is the first version in which\nwe have seen activity from the attacker at this time. Subsequent releases 2019.4 HF 1, 2019.4 HF 2, 2019.4 HF 3, and 2019.4 HF 4 did not\ninclude either test modifications contained in the 2019.4 version or the SUNBURST vulnerability contained in 2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 with no\nhotfix and 2020.2 HF 1.\n\n[** If you apply a SUPERNOVA security patch per the above chart, please visit this KB article to validate the patch was applied to all Orion](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Use-a-script-to-verify-that-the-Supernova-patch-was-applied-to-all-Orion-web-servers?language=en_US)\nPlatform web servers.

Our\ninvestigations into these matters are ongoing, and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, intelligence and other government\nagencies around the world to investigate them. We are also working with leading security experts in these investigations and to help further\nsecure our products and internal systems.\n\n**QUESTION 22**\n\n_Recent as of 2/5/2020_\n\n**What about the vulnerabilities disclosed by Trustwave?**\n\nFirst, it’s important to note these vulnerabilities are not related to the SUNBURST attack, or to SUPERNOVA.\n\nVulnerabilities of varying degrees are common in all software products, including recent patches for Apple and Microsoft that solve critical\nvulnerabilities, but we understand there is heightened scrutiny on SolarWinds right now. SolarWinds has always been committed to working\nwith our customers and other organizations to identify and remediate any vulnerabilities across our product portfolio in a responsible way.\nTrustwave is a leading threat detection company that responsibly reports product vulnerabilities to companies as they are discovered prior to\nbroader announcement to allow companies to develop remediations to protect their customers.\n\nThe vulnerabilities announced by Trustwave concerning the Orion Platform were addressed in Orion Platform version 2020.2.4, released®\nJanuary 25, 2021. The vulnerabilities concerning Serv-U were addressed in Serv-U version 15.2.2 HF1, released January 22, 2021. To review\n[the list of currently supported versions of these products, please review the documentation.](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Currently-supported-software-versions?language=en_US)\n\nTrustwave identified three vulnerabilities, two in the Orion Platform and one in our Serv-U file transfer product. To our knowledge, none of\nthese vulnerabilities have been exploited. The three vulnerabilities could be described as follows:\n\nThe first, which affects the Orion Platform, allows for an unprivileged user to extract passwords from the SQL Server database.\nThe second allows a remote user to execute a command against the Microsoft Message Queue service used by the Orion Platform.\nThe third allows an attacker to gain access to the Serv-U FTP server by creating an unauthorized user account.\n\n**QUESTION 23**\n\n_Recent as of 2/5/2020_\n\n**What about the issue disclosed by Sophos?**\n\nIn the case of the Sophos announcement, it is important to note this is NOT a reported vulnerability in the Orion Platform product. This\nsituation was the result of a compromise within an individual company's network unrelated to SolarWinds. That breach enabled attackers to\nadd malicious code to the Orion Platform software instance within the customer's network.\n\nIn November of 2020, Sophos investigated an environment infected with a Ragnar Locker attack in which hundreds of computers were\ncompromised.\nOne of the computers compromised in the Ragnar Locker attack was a Windows server hosting the Orion product.\nThe threat actor had full administrative access to the Windows server and was able to copy and replace a signed .dll shipped with the\nOrion Platform software with an unsigned, compromised version.\nThis compromised code was not shipped with the Orion Platform software.\nFollowing the Orion Secure Configuration Guide mitigates the risk of this type of attack.\n\n**QUESTION 24**\n\n_Recent as of 1/29/2021_\n\n**What is SUPERNOVA?**\n\n\n-----\n\nS o t y a te SU U S as a ou ced, t d pa t es a d t e ed a pub c y epo ted o a a a e, o e e ed to as SU O\nBased on our investigation, this malware could be deployed through an exploitation of a vulnerability in the Orion Platform. Like other software\ncompanies, we seek to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in our products to our customers while also mitigating the risk that bad actors seek\nto exploit those vulnerabilities by releasing updates to our products before we disclose the vulnerabilities.\n\n[CISA released a malware analysis report on SUPERNOVA on January 27, 2021. The SUPERNOVA malware consisted of two](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-027a)\ncomponents. The first was a malicious, unsigned webshell .dll “app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll” specifically written to be used\non the Orion Platform. The second is the exploitation of a vulnerability in the Orion Platform to enable deployment of the malicious code. The\nlatest updates were designed to remediate this vulnerability in all supported versions of the Orion Platform.\n\nWe constantly work to enhance the security of our products and to protect our customers and ourselves because hackers and other\ncybercriminals are always seeking new ways to find and attack their victims. We work closely with our customers to address and remediate\nany potential concerns, and we encourage all customers to run only supported versions of our products and to upgrade to the latest versions to\nthe get the full benefit of our updates, improvements, and enhancements.\n\n**QUESTION 25**\n\n_Recent as of 12/26/2020_\n\n**Is SUPERNOVA another supply chain attack?**\n\nBased on our investigation to date, SUPERNOVA is not malicious code embedded within the builds of our Orion Platform as a supply chain®\nattack. It is malware that is separately placed on a server that requires unauthorized access to a customer’s network and is designed to appear\nto be part of a SolarWinds product.\n\n**QUESTION 26**\n\n_Recent as of 12/29/2020_\n\n**What indicators of compromise (IOCs) of the SUPERNOVA malware have you identified?**\n\nThrough our investigations, our retention of a third-party cybersecurity firm, and in cooperation with the law enforcement, intelligence and other\ngovernment agencies around the world in investigations related to the SUPERNOVA vulnerability, we’ve identified the following IOC:\n\nThe SUPERNOVA malware [app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll] with the file hash:\nsha256 of the file app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll is:\nc15abaf51e78ca56c0376522d699c978217bf041a3bd3c71d09193efa5717c71\n\n**QUESTION 27**\n\n_Recent as of 12/31/2020_\n\n**How can I confirm if I’ve applied either the SUPERNOVA mitigation script or one of the SUPERNOVA security fixes to my Orion**\n**server(s)?**\n\n[If you’re running Orion Platform version 2018.2, 2018.4, or 2019.2, you can run the script available here to verify one of the SUPERNOVA](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Use-a-script-to-verify-that-the-Supernova-patch-was-applied-to-all-Orion-web-servers?language=en_US)\nSecurity Fixes (2018.2 HF6 Security Fix, 2018.4 HF3 Security Fix, 2019.2 HF3 Security Fix) for the recent SUPERNOVA security\nvulnerability has been applied to your main Orion server and any additional web servers. If you reinstall your Orion server, you will need to\nreapply the respective patch.\n\nIf you used the SUPERNOVA Mitigation Script to address the Supernova vulnerability, use the guidance in the document within that package to\nconfirm the temporary patch. If you reinstall your Orion server, you will need to reapply this script.\n\n**QUESTION 28**\n\n_Recent as of 12/18/2020_\n\n**What is SUNBURST?**\n\nSolarWinds was the victim of a cyberattack that inserted a vulnerability (SUNBURST) within our Orion Platform software builds for versions®\n**2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 unpatched, and 2020.2 HF 1, which, if present and activated, could potentially allow an attacker to compromise the**\nserver on which the Orion Platform products run. SUNBURST was very sophisticated supply chain attack, which refers to a disruption in a\nstandard process resulting in a compromised result with a goal of being able to attack subsequent users of the software.\n\nBased on our investigation, it appears that the code was intended to be used in a targeted way as its exploitation requires manual intervention.\nWe’ve been advised that the sophistication and nature of SUNBURST indicates that it may have been conducted by an outside nation state,\nbut SolarWinds has not verified the identity of the attacker.\n\n**QUESTION 29**\n\n\n-----\n\n_ece t as o_ _/ 8/ 0 0_\n\n**How extensive is the impact of SUNBURST?**\n\nBased on our investigations to date, which are ongoing, we believe that the SUNBURST vulnerability was inserted within the Orion Platform\nproducts and existed in updates released between March and June 2020 (which we call the “relevant period”) as a result of a compromise of\nthe Orion software build system and was not present in the source code repository of the Orion Platform products. SolarWinds has taken steps\nto remediate the compromise of the Orion software build system and we’re investigating what additional steps, if any, should be taken. Also,\n**while we are still investigating our non-Orion products, we have not seen any evidence that they are impacted by SUNBURST. Based**\non our investigations to date, SolarWinds currently believes that:\n\nOrion Platform products downloaded, implemented or updated during the relevant period contained the SUNBURST vulnerability;\nOrion Platform products downloaded and implemented before the relevant period and not updated during the relevant period did not\ncontain the SUNBURST vulnerability;\nOrion Platform products downloaded and implemented after the relevant period did not contain the SUNBURST vulnerability; and\nPreviously affected versions of the Orion Platform products that were updated with a build released after the relevant period no longer\ncontained the SUNBURST vulnerability; however, the server on which the affected Orion Platform products ran may have been\ncompromised during the period in which the SUNBURST vulnerability existed.\n\n**QUESTION 30**\n\n_Recent as of 4/6/2021_\n\n**What should I do if I believe my environment has been compromised by the SUNBURST vulnerability?**\n\nIf you believe your environment has been compromised by the SUNBURST vulnerability, below are the recommended steps to take:\n\n[First, determine the version of the Orion® Platform products you have installed here, and verify which hotfix updates you have installed here.](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Determine-which-version-of-a-SolarWinds-Orion-product-I-have-installed?language=en_US)\n\nIf you have already upgraded to 2020.2.5, additional security fixes and protections unrelated to SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA are\n[included in this version. For more information, review the Release Notes here, and KB article](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/content/release_notes/orion_platform_2020-2-5_release_notes.htm) [here.](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Remote-Code-Execution-CVE-Frequently-Asked-Questions?language=en_US)\n\nIf you have upgraded to 2020.2.4 or 2019.4 HF 2, both the SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA vulnerabilities have been addressed in these\nversions—and they have also been digitally re-signed by newly obtained digital code-signing certificates.\n\nIf you have not already upgraded to 2020.2.5, 2020.2.4, or 2019.4.2, follow the guidance identified for your current version of your Orion\nPlatform products below to help ensure the security of your environment:\n\nIf you’re currently running Orion Platform version 2019.4 HF 4, we recommend you upgrade to 2020.2.5, or 2019.4.2 if you are unable to\nupgrade to the latest version at this time.\nIf you’re currently running Orion Platform version 2019.4 HF 5, we recommend you rebuild your Orion server/VM for all pollers and install\nOrion Platform version 2020.2.5 or 2019.4.2 if you are unable to upgrade to the latest version at this time.\nIf you’re currently running Orion Platform version 2020.2.1, but have run any of the previous infected versions, rebuild your Orion\nserver and/or VM for all pollers and install Orion Platform version 2020.2.5 on a fresh machine.\nIf you are running a version prior to Orion Platform version 2019.4 HF 4, we do not believe that your system was compromised with this\nvulnerability. We still recommend as a best practice that you upgrade to the latest version, Orion Platform version 2020.2.5, to take\nadvantage of the latest security improvements.\n\nTo help protect your system, you should also block DNS access to any of the following:\n\navsvmcloud[.]com\npanhardware[.]com\ndatabasegalore[.]com\nfreescanonline[.]com\nthedoccloud[.]com\ndeftsecurity[.]com\n\nIf you have the expertise to take the additional following action items, please do so:\n\nForensically image system memory and/or host operating systems hosting all instances of SolarWinds Orion Platform [versions 2019.4\n**HF 5, 2020.2** **unpatched, and 2020.2 HF 1].**\nAnalyze stored network traffic for indications of compromise, including new external DNS domains.\nConsult with any security vendors with whom you currently have a relationship on their recommendations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**QUESTION 31**\n\n_Recent as of 4/6/2021_\n\n**If my Orion server currently or previously had a SUNBURST vulnerable version, should I simply upgrade or should I rebuild my**\n**Orion server? What about my database?**\n\nWe encourage all customers to run only supported versions of our products and to upgrade to the latest versions to the get the full benefit of\nour updates, improvements and enhancements.\n\nIf you never ran a known, affected version on your Orion server, we do not recommend that you rebuild. We still recommend as a\nbest practice that you upgrade to the latest version, Orion Platform version 2020.2.5,to take advantage of the latest security\nimprovements.\nIf you ran a known, affected version of your Orion server and it had access to the internet, we recommend that you rebuild the server.\nIf your Orion server had no access to the internet, we do not recommend that you rebuild. An upgrade to Orion Platform version\n**2020.2.5 will be sufficient.**\n\nIf you rebuild your servers, here are the factors to consider in deciding whether to retain your Orion Database:\n\n**[Reference the CISA Alert (AA20-352A):](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a)**\n\nIf you fall into Category 2, you should be able to re-install the software and retain your Orion databases for the platform, for flow,\nand for logs—consistent with a thorough risk evaluation.\n\nIf you fall into Category 3, your Orion installation—including the Orion databases—are equally as vulnerable as the rest of the\nenvironment, and you should follow your incident response procedures.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\nWe are not aware of any indications at this time that the SUNBURST vulnerability routinely altered the Orion databases in any way.\nYou may want to audit configurations stored in the database, like alert actions, or executable scripts to confirm they have not been\ntampered with.\nIf you chose to rebuild your databases, follow your incident response procedures to image and retain your databases, particularly\nyour flow database for forensic analysis.\n\n**QUESTION 32**\n\n_Recent as of 12/16/2020_\n\n**I want to manually check my version of the SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll for the SUNBURST vulnerability. Do you know**\n**a way to do that?**\n\nYou should check your Orion server, any additional polling engine, high availability (HA) engines, and additional web servers. You can use the\nfollowing file hash information to check whether you have the version with the inserted vulnerability:\n\n**From Windows, open PowerShell and run the following (adjusting the file path if a different installation path was used):**\n\nGet-FileHash \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SolarWinds\\Orion\\SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll\"\n\n**_Versions not known to contain the SUNBURST vulnerability:_**\n\n2020.2.1 RTM sha256sum of SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll (file version 2020.2.15300.12766)\n\n143632672dcb6ef324343739636b984f5c52ece0e078cfee7c6cac4a3545403a\n\n**(No hotfix applied, not the known compromised version)**\n\n2020.2.1 HF 1 sha256sum of SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll (file version 2020.2.15300.12766)\n\n143632672dcb6ef324343739636b984f5c52ece0e078cfee7c6cac4a3545403a\n\n**(Not the known compromised version; NOTE: same as 2020.2.1 RTM – this hotfix does not update that DLL)**\n\n2019.4 HF6 - file version 2019.4.5200.9106 - sha256 8DFE613B00D495FB8905BDF6E1317D3E3AC1F63A626032FA2BDAD4750887EE8A\n\n2020.2.1 HF2 - file version 2020.2.15300.12901 - sha256\nCC870C07EEB672AB33B6C2BE51B173AD5564AF5D98BFC02DA02367A9E349A76F\n\n**_Versions known to contain the SUNBURST vulnerability:_**\n\n\n-----\n\ns a 56 o So a ds O o Co e us ess aye d o 0 9 5\n32519b85c0b422e4656de6e6c41878e95fd95026267daab4215ee59c107d6c77\n\nsha256 of SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll from 2020.2:\nce77d116a074dab7a22a0fd4f2c1ab475f16eec42e1ded3c0b0aa8211fe858d6\n\n**Hashes from fixes provided to individual customers, sometimes called “Buddy Drops”**\n\n019085a76ba7126fff22770d71bd901c325fc68ac55aa743327984e89f4b0134\n\nac1b2b89e60707a20e9eb1ca480bc3410ead40643b386d624c5d21b47c02917c\n\nc09040d35630d75dfef0f804f320f8b3d16a481071076918e9b236a321c1ea77\n\ndab758bf98d9b36fa057a66cd0284737abf89857b73ca89280267ee7caf62f3b\n\neb6fab5a2964c5817fb239a7a5079cabca0a00464fb3e07155f28b0a57a2c0ed\n\n**Path: SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.**\n\n**By default, the file is located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SolarWinds\\Orion.**\n\n**NOTE: If you’re checking files using MacOS or Linux, the standard “sha256sum” tool can be used.**\n\n**QUESTION 33**\n\n_Recent as of 12/15/2020_\n\n**What indicators of compromise (IOCs) of the SUNBURST vulnerability have you identified?**\n\nThrough our investigations, our retention of a third-party cybersecurity firm, and in cooperation with the law enforcement, intelligence, and\nother government agencies around the world in investigations related to the SUNBURST vulnerability, we’ve identified the following IOCs:\n\n[SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll] with one of the file hashes listed below:\nsha256 of SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll from 2019.4 HF 5:\n32519b85c0b422e4656de6e6c41878e95fd95026267daab4215ee59c107d6c77\nsha256 of SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll from 2020.2:\nce77d116a074dab7a22a0fd4f2c1ab475f16eec42e1ded3c0b0aa8211fe858d6\n\n**Additional Hashes from Hotfix and Buddy drop releases**\n\n019085a76ba7126fff22770d71bd901c325fc68ac55aa743327984e89f4b0134\nac1b2b89e60707a20e9eb1ca480bc3410ead40643b386d624c5d21b47c02917c\nc09040d35630d75dfef0f804f320f8b3d16a481071076918e9b236a321c1ea77\ndab758bf98d9b36fa057a66cd0284737abf89857b73ca89280267ee7caf62f3b\neb6fab5a2964c5817fb239a7a5079cabca0a00464fb3e07155f28b0a57a2c0ed\n\n**QUESTION 34**\n\n_Recent as of 12/20/2020_\n\n**How do I know someone didn't exploit the SUNBURST vulnerability and move horizontally in my environment and compromise**\n**another system?**\n\nIf the SUNBURST vulnerability was exploited in your environment, you may see network traffic from the Orion server to the internet. This traffic\nwould be directed to a domain other than SolarWinds domain. Horizontal or lateral movement by an attacker would indicate that they have\ngained privileged level access to your environment. Increased security event monitoring, close inspection of server and application access\nlogs, and understanding what local accounts exist on your corporate systems will help to identify any signs of misuse.\n\nFor further details, please see CERT Alert (AA20-352A), Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical\n**[Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations, updated December 19, 2020: https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a)**\n\n**QUESTION 35**\n\n_Recent as of 12/24/2020_\n\n\n-----\n\n**at p oducts a e a ected by t e SU** **U S** **u** **e ab** **ty**\n\nWe have identified the following products as being affected: Orion Platform versions 2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 unpatched, and 2020.2 HF 1,\nincluding:\n\nApplication Centric Monitor (ACM)\nDatabase Performance Analyzer Integration Module* (DPAIM*)\nEnterprise Operations Console (EOC)\nHigh Availability (HA)\nIP Address Manager (IPAM)\nLog Analyzer (LA)\nNetwork Automation Manager (NAM)\nNetwork Configuration Manager (NCM)\nNetwork Operations Manager (NOM)\nNetwork Performance Monitor (NPM)\nNetFlow Traffic Analyzer (NTA)\nServer & Application Monitor (SAM)\nServer Configuration Monitor (SCM)\nStorage Resource Monitor (SRM)\nUser Device Tracker (UDT)\nVirtualization Manager (VMAN)\nVoIP & Network Quality Manager (VNQM)\nWeb Performance Monitor (WPM)\n\n***NOTE: Please note DPAIM is an integration module and is not the same as Database Performance Analyzer (DPA), which we do not believe**\nis affected.\n\nWe encourage all customers to run only supported versions of our products and to upgrade to the latest versions to the get the full benefit of\nour updates, improvements and enhancements.\n\n**QUESTION 36**\n\n_Recent as of 12/20/2020_\n\n**What products are NOT affected by the SUNBURST vulnerability?**\n\nOur investigations are still ongoing, but based on our investigations to date, we have found no evidence that other versions of our Orion\nPlatform products or any of our other products, Orion agents, or Web Performance Monitor (WPM) Players are affected by the SUNBURST\nvulnerability.\n\nSolarWinds products NOT KNOWN TO BE AFFECTED by this security vulnerability are as follows:\n\n\n8Man\n\nAccess Rights Manager (ARM)\n\nAppOptics\n\nBackup Document\n\nBackup Profiler\n\nBackup Server\n\nBackup Workstation\n\nCatTools\n\nDameware Mini Remote Control\n\nDameware Patch Manager\n\nDameware Remote Everywhere\n\nDameware Remote Manager\n\nDatabase Performance Analyzer (DPA)\n\nDatabase Performance Monitor (DPM)\n\nDNSstuff\n\n\nService Desk\n\nServ-U FTP Server\n\nServ-U Gateway\n\nServ-U MFT Server\n\nStorage Manager\n\nStorage Profiler\n\nThreat Monitor\n\nVirtualization Profiler\n\nWeb Help Desk\n\nSQL Sentry\n\nDB Sentry\n\nV Sentry\n\nWin Sentry\n\nBI Sentry\n\nSentryOne Document\n\n\n-----\n\ng\n\nEngineer's Web Toolset\n\nFailOver Engine\n\nFirewall Security Monitor\n\nIdentity Monitor\n\nipMonitor\n\nKiwi CatTools\n\nKiwi Syslog Server\n\nLANSurveyor\n\nLibrato\n\nLog & Event Manager (LEM)\n\nLog and Event Manager Workstation Edition\n\nLoggly\n\nMobile Admin\n\nNetwork Topology Mapper (NTM)\n\nPapertrail\n\nPatch Manager\n\nPingdom\n\nPingdom Server Monitor\n\nSecurity Event Manager(SEM)\n\nSecurity Event Manager Workstation Edition\n\nServer Profiler\n\n**QUESTION 37**\n\n_Recent as of 12/15/2020_\n\n\ny\n\nTask Factory\n\nDBA xPress\n\nPlan Explorer\n\nAPS Sentry\n\nDW Sentry\n\nSQL Sentry Essentials\n\nSentryOne Monitor\n\nBI xPress\n\n**SolarWinds MSP Products:**\n\nN-central – Probe\n\nN-central – Topology\n\nN-central – NetPath\n\nN-central\n\nNetPath – Server\n\nRMM\n\nBackup Disaster Recovery\n\nM365 Backup\n\nBackup\n\nMail Assure\n\nSpamExperts\n\nMSP Manager\n\nPassPortal\n\nTake Control\n\nPatch\n\nAutomation Manager\n\nWebprotection\n\n\n**Why didn’t SolarWinds catch the SUNBURST vulnerability before it happened?**\n\nThis SUNBURST vulnerability was very complex and sophisticated.
