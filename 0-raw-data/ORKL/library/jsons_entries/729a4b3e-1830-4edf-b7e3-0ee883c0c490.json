    "plain_text": "# Sphinx: New Zeus Variant for Sale on the Black Market\n\n**web.archive.org/web/20160130165709/http://darkmatters.norsecorp.com/2015/08/24/sphinx-new-zeus-variant-for-sale-**\non-the-black-market/\n\nAugust 24, 2015\n\nThe 0Day marketplace was a busy beaver this weekend. I’ve been waiting and watching\nSphinx for the past 10 days to see if the 0Day admin would verify this new threat:\n\n## New Zeus Variant\n\nOn Sunday evening, Sphinx, a new variant of the Zeus banking trojan was admin-verified.\nSphinx is coded in C++ and based on ZeuS source code and operates fully through the Tor\nnetwork using a Tor hidden service. This variant is listed as being immune to sinkholing,\n[blacklisting, and the ZeuS tracker.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160130165709/https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/)\n\nThe seller claims that you do not need bulletproof hosting (generally immune from takedown\nrequests) when operating a Sphinx botnet, though he still recommends it.\n\n**Sphinx Features (as listed in the forum with minor edits):**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malware:**\n\nFormgrabber and Webinjects for latest Internet Explorer, Mozilla.\nFirefox and Tor Browser with cookie grabber and transparent page redirect(Webfakes).\nBackconnect SOCKS, VNC.\nSocks 4/4a/5 with UDP and IPv6 support.\nFTP, POP3 grabber.\nCertificate grabber.\nKeylogger.\n\n**Certificate grabber:**\n\nBy intercepting windows functions, Sphinx is able to intercept certificates when they are in\nuse. For example: for signing a file – this is useful for getting file-signing certificates for\nsigning your\nmalware to bypass all anti-virus\n\n**Backconnect VNC:**\n\nThis is the most essential feature of a banking trojan. It allows you to make money transfers\nfrom the victims computer. Your VNC is done on a different desktop than the victim’s\ndesktop, so its completely hidden.\n\nYou can steal money from the bank while the victim is playing multiplayer games or watching\nmovies. Forget about configuring the browser, because when carding with Sphinx you don’t\nneed to.\n\nWith Backconnect VNC you can also remove anti-virus/rapport software from the victim’s\ncomputer. Port-forwarding for the victim is not required due to the use of Reverse\nconnection.\n\n**Backconnect SOCKS:**\n\nUse your victims as a SOCKS proxy. Port-forwarding is not required due to use of Reverse\nconnection.\n\n**Webinjects:**\n\nUsed for speeding up report gathering. With Webinjects you can change the content of a\nwebsite and ask for more information. You can do such things as asking for credit-card data\nfrom victims PayPal/Amazon/Ebay/Facebook for successful login.\n\nWebinjects use ZeuS format. You have to create your own web injects or use those that are\npublicly available. Sphinx uses ZeuS format so all released webinjects for\nZeus/Spyeye/Citadel are compatible.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Webfakes:**\n\nUsed to do phishing attacks without having to trick the victim into going in to a fake domain.\nFor example: When configured for bankofamerica, the user is transparently redirected to\nyour phishing site without changing the url.\n\n**Installation:**\n\nAt the moment, the bot is primarily designed to work under Windows Vista/Seven, with\nenabled UAC, and without the use of local exploits. Therefore, the bot is designed to work\nwith minimal privileges (including the user “Guest”).\n\nIn this regard the bot is always working within sessions-per-user. The bot can be set for\neach user in the OS, and the bots do not know about each other. When you run the bot as a\n“LocalSystem” user it will attempt to infect all users on the system.\n\nWhen you install Sphinx, the bot creates its copy in the user’s home directory. This copy is\ntied to the current user and OS, and cannot be run by another user. The original copy of the\nsame bot that was used for installation, will be automatically deleted, regardless of\nthe installation success.\n\n**Communication:**\n\nSession with the server through a variety of processes from an internal “white list” that allows\nyou to bypass most firewalls. During the session, the bot can get the configuration to send\nthe accumulated reports, report their condition to the server, and receive commands\nto execute on the computer.\n\nThe session takes place via HTTP-protocol, all data sent by a bot and received from the\nserver is encrypted with a unique key for each botnet.\n\n**Webpanel:**\n\nSphinx command and control (C&C) has not changed from ZeuS. Old ZeuS fans will be\npleased to use this comfortable bot network control system again. Its coded in PHP using\nextensions mbstring and mysql.\n\n**Features:**\n\nXMPP notification.\nStatistics.\nBotlist.\nScripts\n\n**XMPP notification:**\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can receive notifications from the Control Panel in a Jabber-account.\n\nAt the moment there is the possibility of receiving notifications about a user entering defined\nHTTP/HTTPS-resources. For example: it is used to capture a user session at an online bank.\n\n**Scripts:**\n\nYou can control the bots by creating a script for them. Currently, syntax and scripting\ncapabilities, are very primitive.\n\n**Botlist:**\n\nFiltering the list by country, botnets, IP-addresses, NAT-status, etc.\nDisplaying desktop screenshots in real time (only for bots outside NAT).\nMass inspection of the Socks-servers state.\n\n**Displays detailed information about the bots:**\n\nWindows version, user language and time zone.\nLocation and computer IP-address (not for local).\nInternet connection speed (measured by calculating the load time of a predetermined\nHTTP-resource).\nThe first and last time of communication with the server.\nTime online.\nAbility to set comment for each bot.\n\n**Statistics:**\n\nNumber of infected computers.\nCurrent number of bots in the online.\nThe number of new bots.\nDaily activity of bots.\nCountry statistics.\nStatistics by OS.\n\nThe seller recommends “using Internet Explorer traffic for the exploit-kit in order to\nget maximal profit while using Sphinx.”\n\nThe Sphinx kit is currently selling for $500 USD per binary, with Bitcoin and DASH as the\nonly accepted method of payment. To purchase: the seller has you register on a website\nwhere an address for both BTC and DASH are generated.\n\nAfter the payment is received the buyer account is automatically validated and rights to edit\nthe config and request a build are granted. Upon finalization of the purchase, all wheeling\nand dealing is handled via XMPP. The seller also includes escrow.\n\n\n-----\n\nNo further activity has been noted regarding Sphinx since the admin verified this new\nmalware. Though there was some rattling of bones when someone made mention of security\nresearchers possibly discovering it and blogging about it – all transactions appear to be\noccurring behind closed doors now.\n\n\n-----",
