The event was a supply chain attack on SolarWinds Orion software conducted byⓇ](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\nsuspected nation-state operators that we are tracking as SolarStorm. Unit 42 was able to\n[connect this event back to an attack we successfully prevented earlier this year. On Dec. 18,](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2020/12/solarwinds-statement-solarstorm/)\n[we launched a SolarStorm Rapid Assessment program resulting in more than 600 companies](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/solarstorm-rapid-response)\nrequesting this service within the first four days.\n\nWhile this is not the first software supply chain compromise, it may be the most notable, as\nthe attacker was trying to gain widespread, persistent access to a number of critical networks.\nGiven the importance of the event, we are publishing a timeline of the attack based on our\nextensive research into the information available to us and our direct experience defending\nagainst this threat. We believe this will be invaluable to cybersecurity professionals in the\nindustry responding to this attack, as well as to other researchers piecing together the event\ndetails. And as we learn that this threat actor used additional attack vectors, we urge\neveryone to share what they know about this attack so that we as a cybersecurity community\nget a complete picture of it as quickly as possible.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that we do not have complete knowledge of when the planning and\nexecution of this campaign began. We do, however, have evidence that SolarStorm command\nand control (C2) infrastructure was set up as early as August 2019. The first modified\nSolarWinds software was released in October 2019, and the earliest related Cobalt Strike\npayload we’ve identified was generated using Cobalt Strike 4.0, which was built in December\n2019. We do not know when SolarStorm first compromised the SolarWinds software supply\nchain or the method by which they accomplished this task.\n\nAdditionally, [multiple reports indicate that SolarStorm employed additional initial access](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a)\nvectors beyond the compromised SolarWinds software. We are tracking these reports but\nhave not confirmed other techniques used to obtain initial access to networks at this time. Of\ncourse, we should expect that an adversary with the capability to execute this campaign could\nhave used many additional means to accomplish their goal.\n\nThose seeking details on how Palo Alto Networks is protecting its customers from this threat,\n[please read our Threat Brief on SolarStorm and SUNBURST containing those details, which](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fireeye-solarstorm-sunburst/)\n[is being updated as new information comes to light. The SolarStorm ATOM is also being](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/solarstorm/)\nupdated as new details emerge.\n\n## SolarStorm Timeline Summary\n\n[Researchers reported a supply chain attack affecting organizations around the world on Dec.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\n13, 2020. This incident involved malicious code identified within the legitimate IT\nperformance and statistics monitoring software, Orion, developed by SolarWinds.Ⓡ\n\nSince then, details from other security vendors and organizations have been released, further\nbuilding on the events leading up to the initial disclosure. Unit 42 has conducted research\nbased on what is publicly available and what information has been identified within internal\n\n\n-----\n\ndata.\n\nThe timeline in Figure 1 displays a high-level summary of the events observed, beginning as\nearly as August 2019 and continuing through December 2020.\n\nFigure 1. SolarStorm Visual Timeline\n\n[Analysis of the SolarWinds software revealed code modification as early as October 2019,](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/sunburst-the-next-level-of-stealth)\nalthough the first weaponized software updates, denoted as SUNBURST malware, were not\nreleased until approximately March 2020. Unit 42 has also observed two samples of the\nmodified SolarWinds software which appear as early as October 2019.\n\nThe majority of the infrastructure observed in this campaign was acquired between\nDecember 2019 and March 2020; however, at least one domain, incomeupdate[.]com, noted\n[in Cobalt Strike BEACON activity, was registered in August 2019 as depicted in Table 1.](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures/blob/main/indicator_release/Indicator_Release_NBIs.csv)\nSolarStorm operators acquired SSL certificates for many of the associated domains between\nFebruary and April 2020, with at least one certificate extending to July.\n\nThe extensive infrastructure build-out throughout this timeline helps to visualize the\npersistence of the operation from initial targeting to completion of the objective. SolarStorm\nthreat actors are highly skilled and thorough in their operational handling.\n\nTo better understand the timing around when organizations installed the malicious\nSUNBURST update, we reviewed our DNS Security logs for requests to avsvmcloud[.]com,\nthe domain used with a domain generation algorithm (DGA) in this activity. Industry\n[partners ultimately seized this domain in December 2020.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-and-industry-partners-seize-key-domain-used-in-solarwinds-hack/)\n\n\n-----\n\nOur search returned responses from April-November 2020. The counts of requests observed\nin DNS Security logs each month are shown in Figure 2 below.\n\nFigure 2: Number of requests for avsvmcloud[.]com (and subdomains) per month.\n\nThe requests begin in April, shortly after SolarStorm distributed the malicious update. They\nthen slowly rise with a peak in July and begin to trail off. This pattern could be explained by\norganizations slowly installing the malicious updates in the weeks after release, but we can’t\nsay for sure. Microsoft and industry partners seized control of this domain on Dec. 15. They\nused it to send a form of “killswitch” command, instructing SUNBURST to terminate itself\nand prevent further execution.\n\n## Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR Blocked an Attempted SolarStorm Attack\n\n[As our CEO Nikesh Arora described on Dec. 17, Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR successfully](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2020/12/solarwinds-statement-solarstorm/)\nprevented a SolarStorm attack by immediately detecting and preventing an attempt to\nexecute Cobalt Strike Beacon on one of our IT SolarWinds servers last year. To help provide\nmore insight into the timeline around this threat, we are sharing more details about what our\nsecurity operations center (SOC) observed at that time.\n\nThere are three initial phases to an intrusion from SolarStorm:\n\n1. A SolarWinds Orion server updates its software and downloads the malicious update\n\ncontaining the SUNBURST backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. SUNBURST then sends DNS requests to check in with the attacker, which contain\n\ninformation identifying the organization. The attacker chooses to designate some\norganizations as being of interest for further intrusion.\n3. For SUNBURST to gain further access into the network, additional steps are needed\n\nstarting with downloading and executing an additional malicious payload.\n\nThe Palo Alto Networks SOC observed a DNS request from our Solarwinds Orion server for\nthe avsvmcloud[.]com domain on Sept. 29, 2020. During this short-lived connection, no\nmalicious content was downloaded but the system was likely labeled for further intrusion.\n\nSix days later, on Oct. 5, 2020, a second connection occurred in which a new payload was\ndownloaded. With the use of Cortex XDR’s Behavioral Threat Protection capability, this\npayload was instantly detected and the attempt to execute was prevented. Our SOC then\nimmediately isolated the server, initiated an investigation and verified our infrastructure was\nsecure. Additionally, at this time, our SOC notified SolarWinds of the activity observed. The\ninvestigation by our SOC concluded that the attempted attack was unsuccessful and no data\nwas compromised.\n\nWe thought this was an isolated incident. However, on Dec. 13, when SolarWinds disclosed\nSUNBURST, it became clear that the incident we prevented was an attempted SolarStorm\nattack. Given this new information, our SOC exercised due diligence and analyzed our entire\ninfrastructure extensively again to revalidate the security of our entire network. We remain\nconfident that our network continues to be secure.\n\n## Observed TEARDROP Activity\n\nUnit 42 has and continues to research this campaign to identify additional details that could\nlead to further defensive actions.\n\nDuring analysis of the information available, Unit 42 identified related activity involving\nTEARDROP malware that was used to execute a customized Cobalt Strike BEACON. This\nsample contains a beacon request to the previously unreported domain mobilnweb[.]com.\n\nThe TEARDROP DLL has a SHA256 of:\n118189f90da3788362fe85eafa555298423e21ec37f147f3bf88c61d4cd46c51\n\nand contains a beacon request for the URI /2019/Person-With-Parnters-Brands-Our/ with\nthe User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,\nlike Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.83 Safari/537.36. Within that same configuration, we also\nobserved an additional URI setting containing the string /2019/This-Person-Two-JoinWith/.\n\nThe following watermark setting was also present and appears to be unique to this sample\n0x38383430 (943207472). This watermark likely indicates that the operators used a licensed\nversion of Cobalt Strike\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional configuration details of interest include:\nSETTING_C2_POSTREQ:\nReferer: https://yahoo[.]com/\nHost: mobilnweb[.]com\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-US\nConnection: close\nname=\"uploaded_1\";filename=\"91018.png\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nSETTING_SPAWNTO_X86:\n%windir%\\syswow64\\msinfo32.exe\n\nSETTING_SPAWNTO_X64:\n%windir%\\sysnative\\control.exe\n\nAlthough the configuration details above show the referer as https://yahoo[.]com, we do not\nhave evidence that Yahoo was used in an actual beacon.\n\n## SolarStorm Infrastructure Establishment Timeline\n\nWhile some of these domains have a registration date earlier than the dates depicted here,\nthe dates shown are the domain modification dates believed to be when the actors acquired\ncontrol over the domain. The variation in registration date vs. the time of acquisition by\nSolarStorm provides an added sense of legitimacy for the domains in use.\n\n**Domain** **Assessed Actor Controlled Date** **Registrar**\n\nincomeupdate[.]com 8/6/19 NameCheap\n\nzupertech[.]com 10/10/19 NameSilo\n\navsvmcloud[.]com 12/6/2019 GoDaddy\n\nmobilnweb[.]com 12/19/19 NameCheap\n\nhighdatabase[.]com 12/26/19 NameSilo\n\nsolartrackingsystem[.]net 1/7/20 NameSilo\n\nwebcodez[.]com 1/15/20 NameCheap\n\npanhardware[.]com 1/18/20 NameSilo\n\nwebsitetheme[.]com 1/27/20 NameSilo\n\nthedoccloud[.]com 2/5/20 NameSilo\n\n\n-----\n\nseobundlekit[.]com 2/6/20 NameCheap\n\nfreescanonline[.]com 2/10/20 NameCheap\n\ndeftsecurity[.]com 2/12/20 NameSilo\n\nvirtualwebdata[.]com 2/13/20 NameSilo\n\ndigitalcollege[.]org 3/5/20 NameCheap\n\ndatabasegalore[.]com 3/12/20 NameCheap\n\nzupertech[.]com 3/15/20 NameSilo\n\nlcomputers[.]com 6/22/20 NameSilo\n\n_Table 1.

SSL certificates associated with SolarStorm domain activity_\n\n## Additional Tools and Techniques\n\nThere have been many reports indicating that SolarStorm used additional techniques and\ntools with this incident. A summary of our current knowledge of this use is as follows:\n\n**VMware**\n\nAccording to recent reporting, VMware has been associated with this attack in two ways.\n\n[First, the National Security Agency released an advisory earlier this month about CVE-2020-](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA_VMWARE%20ACCESS_U_OO_195076_20.PDF)\n4006, a command injection vulnerability, stating that Russian state-sponsored actors were\nactively exploiting the vulnerability and suggesting US Government agencies patch\n\n\n-----\n\nimmediately. This vulnerability exists in five VMware software products focused on identity\nand access management. Exploitation allows attackers to deploy a webshell on the system\nand gain access to protected data. This vulnerability can only be exploited by someone who\nhas already authenticated to the system and indicates that when leveraged, it likely is used to\ngain additional access once the attacker is already inside the networks. More information\nabout CVE-2020-4006 can be found in our previously released Threat Brief: VMware\nCommand Injection Vulnerability.\n\n[Second, VMware stated they have SolarWinds Orion systems in their environment, but theyⓇ](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/vmware-flaw-a-vector-in-solarwinds-breach/)\nhave not seen any evidence of exploitation. Unit 42 has not seen any indication that\nVMware’s software was used as an infection vector or a TTP utilized within the SolarStorm\nattack.\n\n**Microsoft / SAML**\n\n\nMicrosoft has published multiple reports on activity related to this attack campaign,\n[including a summary of the backdoor implanted into SolarWinds Orion (referred to byⓇ](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/18/analyzing-solorigate-the-compromised-dll-file-that-started-a-sophisticated-cyberattack-and-how-microsoft-defender-helps-protect/)\n[Microsoft as Solorigate), as well as guidance for their customers on protecting themselves.](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/)\n[They have publicly stated they are working with more than 40 companies who have been](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/?ranMID=24542&ranEAID=je6NUbpObpQ&ranSiteID=je6NUbpObpQ-w.1CwjIwATSDTIBSErlPqQ&epi=je6NUbpObpQ-w.1CwjIwATSDTIBSErlPqQ&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2000142_aff_7593_1243925&tduid=%28ir__j29eh6uwlskfqhcekk0sohzn3e2xsexeh9p3kpau00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28je6NUbpObpQ-w.1CwjIwATSDTIBSErlPqQ%29%28%29&irclickid=_j29eh6uwlskfqhcekk0sohzn3e2xsexeh9p3kpau00)\ntargeted in this attack.\n\nOne specific component of the attack that Microsoft has discussed in detail is what they have\n[observed in compromised networks with regard to identity infrastructure. Specifically, the](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/understanding-quot-solorigate-quot-s-identity-iocs-for-identity/ba-p/2007610)\nattackers have exfiltrated SAML token signing certificates that allow them to forge tokens\nand access any resources trusted by those certificates. Microsoft has observed these forged\ntokens presented to the Microsoft cloud on behalf of their customers.\n\nThe impact of a compromise of these certificates implies the attacker gained the highest level\nof privileges inside the network and used them to establish long-term access to the network.\n\n**SUPERNOVA Webshell**\n\nFireEye’s initial report on the SolarWinds compromise included indicators for a webshell\nthey call SUPERNOVA. Since publication, FireEye has removed those indicators as they no\nlonger believe they were used as a result of the SolarWinds software compromise. This\nwebshell may not be related, but it is still vital to defend against it. Unit 42 has already\n[published an analysis of the SUPERNOVA webshell.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/solarstorm-supernova/)\n\n**MFA Bypass**\n\nThe SAML token-forging attack described above would allow an attacker to evade multifactor authentication systems, as in that case, the authentication system itself is\n[compromised. Volexity published a report about a threat group named Dark Halo who they](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)\nhave now connected to SolarStorm. Their report describes that the attacker targeted the\n\n\n-----\n\nintegration secret key used to connect Cisco s Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\nsolution to an Outlook Web Access server. With that key, they were able to pre-compute the\ntoken codes necessary for authentication.\n\nOnce again, similar to the SAML token-forging attack, this MFA bypass requires a significant\ncompromise of the systems used to authenticate users and would have been performed postcompromise to extend the attacker’s access to the network.\n\n**Other Initial Access Vectors**\n\n[On Dec. 19, CISA updated their alert on this threat to include this note:](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a)\n\n_“CISA has evidence that there are initial access vectors other than the SolarWinds Orion_\n_platform. Specifically, we are investigating incidents in which activity indicating abuse of_\n_Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens consistent with this adversary’s_\n_behavior is present, yet where impacted SolarWinds instances have not been identified._\n_CISA is working to confirm initial access vectors and identify any changes to the TTPs._\n_CISA will update this Alert as new information becomes available.”_\n\nUnit 42 does not yet know what additional initial access vectors may have been used in this\nattack. Detecting the forged SAML tokens is a clear indication of a compromise, so it makes\nsense that if that appears in an environment with no SolarWinds Orion servers, anotherⓇ\nroute must have existed. We should expect that an adversary with the capability to execute\nthis campaign could have used many additional means to accomplish their goal.\n\n## Software Supply Chain Attacks\n\nSolarWinds is not the first developer to have their software supply chain mishandled. At the\nend of 2017, we published an article titled “The Era of Software Supply Chain Attacks Has\nBegun,” which laid out previous software supply chain attacks and predicted an increased\nfocus on attacking trusted developers. Below is a summary of these significant events.\n\n**September 2015 –** [XcodeGhost: An attacker distributed a version of Apple’s Xcode](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/malware-xcodeghost-infects-39-ios-apps-including-wechat-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-users/)\nsoftware (used to build iOS and macOS applications), which injected additional code\ninto iOS apps built using it. This attack resulted in thousands of compromised apps\nidentified in Apple’s app store.\n**March 2016 –** [KeRanger: Popular open source BitTorrent client, Transmission, was](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/03/new-os-x-ransomware-keranger-infected-transmission-bittorrent-client-installer/)\ncompromised to include macOS ransomware in its installer. Attackers compromised\nthe legitimate servers used to distribute Transmission, so users who downloaded and\ninstalled the program would be infected with malware that held their files for ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\n**June 2017 –** [NotPetya: Attackers compromised a Ukrainian software company and](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/06/unit42-threat-brief-petya-ransomware/)\ndistributed a destructive payload with network-worm capabilities through an update to\nthe “MeDoc” financial software. After infecting systems using the software, the malware\nspread to other hosts in the network and caused a worldwide disruption affecting many\norganizations.\n**[September 2017 – CCleaner: Attackers compromised Avast’s CCleaner tool, used by](https://blog.avast.com/progress-on-ccleaner-investigation)**\nmillions to help keep their PC working properly. The compromise was used to target\nlarge technology and telecommunications companies worldwide with a second-stage\npayload.\n\n[In September 2019, attackers again likely targeted Avast’s CCleaner tool after gaining access](https://blog.avast.com/ccleaner-fights-off-cyberespionage-attempt-abiss)\nto Avast’s network through a temporary VPN profile. It is not clear whether or not the same\noperators from 2017 were involved in this incident.\n\nIn each case, including the recent SolarStorm activities, rather than targeting an organization\ndirectly through phishing or exploitation of vulnerabilities, the attackers chose to\ncompromise software developers directly and use the trust we place in them to access other\nnetworks. This can effectively evade certain prevention and detection controls that have been\ntuned to trust well-known programs.\n\nThis pattern of software supply chain compromises will continue, and security teams can not\nafford to ignore them. Protecting against these attacks is not simple for any enterprise, and\nthose who are responsible for writing and deploying software need to take responsibility for\nthe integrity of that code.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSince the events of the SolarWinds supply chain attack have unfolded, Unit 42 has actively\nworked to gather full event details using both publicly available information and internal\nanalysis of an attack against our own network that matches event details reported by FireEye.\n\nWhile we do not have complete knowledge of the full planning and execution of this\ncampaign, analysis thus far has concluded that the activities of SolarStorm began as early as\nAugust 2019 during the infrastructure build-out phase of their operation. SolarStorm\noperators displayed a tactical and persistent method of operation throughout the entire\nattack cycle.\n\nWhile SolarStorm is capable of utilizing many techniques to accomplish their goal, details on\ninitial access vectors beyond the compromised SolarStorm software have not yet been\nconfirmed.\n\nFor additional details on how Palo Alto Networks is protecting its customers from this threat,\n[please refer to our Threat Brief on SolarStorm and SUNBURST, which is being updated as](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fireeye-solarstorm-sunburst/)\nnew information comes to light.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Palo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of_\n_compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.
