The group exhibited new tradecraft in its efforts to conduct cyberenabled information operations into mid-2024 using a myriad of cover personas, including multiple cyber\noperations that occurred during and targeting the 2024 Summer Olympics – including the compromise of a\nFrench commercial dynamic display provider. ASA has also undertaken a project to harvest content from IP\ncameras and used online resources related to Artificial Intelligence. Since 2023, the group has exhibited\nnew tradecraft including the use of fictitious hosting resellers to provision operational server infrastructure\nto its own actors as well as to an actor in Lebanon involved in website hosting. Recently released reporting\nfrom Microsoft indicates this group has demonstrated interest in election-related websites and media\noutlets, suggesting preparations for future influence operations.\n\nThis CSA provides the threat group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including its leveraging of\nonline resources related to Artificial Intelligence, and indicators of compromise (IOCs). The CSA also\nhighlights similar activity from a previous FBI advisory that was published on 20 October 2022. This new\nadvisory’s information and guidance are derived from FBI investigative activity and technical analysis of\nthis group’s intrusion activity against U.S. and foreign organizations and engagements with numerous\nentities impacted by this malicious activity.\n\nThe authoring agencies recommend all organizations follow guidance provided in the Mitigations section to\ndefend against the Iranian cyber group’s activities.\n\nIf you suspect your organization has been targeted or compromised by the Iranian cyber actors, the\nauthoring agencies recommend immediately contacting your local FBI field office for assistance.\n\nFor more information on Iranian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s Iran Cyber Threat\nwebpage.\n\n_This document is marked TLP:CLEAR. Disclosure is not limited. Sources may use TLP:CLEAR when information_\n_carries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public_\n_release.

FBI assesses these\noperations are intended to undermine public confidence in the security of the victim’s network and data, as\nwell as embarrass victim companies and targeted countries. These hack-and-leak campaigns involve a\ncombination of hacking/theft of data and information operations that impact victims through financial\nlosses and reputational damage. Similar to the Emennet campaign that targeted the 2020 U.S.\nPresidential election[4], FBI judges the group's recent campaigns include a mix of computer intrusion activity\nand exaggerated or fictitious claims of access to victim networks or stolen data to enhance the\npsychological effects of their operations.\n\nSince the publication of this PIN, FBI has acquired new information on cyber tradecraft the group has\nemployed in recent cyber operations impacting numerous countries, including Israel, France, Sweden, and\nthe U.S. Further details regarding the ”Anzu Team” cyber-enabled information operation against Sweden\nhave been outlined in public statements made by Swedish government authorities.[5,6 ]Recently released\ninformation from Microsoft indicates this group has been actively scouting election-related websites and\nmedia outlets, suggesting preparations for more direct influence operations as Election Day nears.[7]\n\n### New Attribution Details\n\nFBI obtained reliable information in mid-2024 indicating Emennet Pasargad has more recently been using\nthe Iranian company name Aria Sepehr Ayandehsazan (ASA, Iranian Registration Number 504415) as a\nnominal cover, including for human resources and financial-related purposes.\n\n1 FBI | PIN | Iranian Cyber Group Emennet Pasargad Conducting Hack-and-leak Operations Using False-Flag Personas\n| 20 October 2022 | ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/221020.pdf.\n2 Emennet Pasargad was previously known as Eeleyanet Gostar. (Reference: justice.gov/opa/pr/two-iraniannationals-charged-cyber-enabled-disinformation-and-threat-campaign-designed)\n3 The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice program is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information\non Emennet Pasargad malign activities.

These two providers are ”Server-Speed”\n(server-speed[.]com) and ”VPS-Agent” (vps-agent[.]net[8]). Whereas actors typically procure virtual\ninfrastructure from hosting resellers, ASA set up its own resellers and procured server space from Europebased providers, including the Lithuania-based company BAcloud and Stark Industries Solutions/PQ\nHosting (located in the United Kingdom and Moldova, respectively). ASA then leverages these cover resellers to provision operational servers to its own cyber actors for malicious cyber activities. FBI has also\nobserved ASA using these cover re-sellers to provide technical support to identified Lebanon-based\nindividuals, including with hosting for HAMAS-affiliated or themed websites. For example, FBI assesses the\nwebsite alqassam[.]ps - a website associated with the military wing of HAMAS - was supported by both ASA\nand its contacts in Lebanon. ASA has also provided hosting support for Lebanon-based actors operating\nthe website almaq.org.\n\nFBI assesses these cover hosting providers were set up by ASA to centralize and manage provisioning of\noperational infrastructure, while providing plausible deniability that malicious infrastructure was being\nassigned by a legitimate hosting provider. FBI previously observed ASA use ”Server-Speed” from\napproximately April 2023 until May 2024, when the actors pivoted to using the entity ”VPS-Agent.”\n\n8 This domain has been seized in accordance with a seizure warrant issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1030(i) and 21\nU.S.C. § 853 issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as part of a joint law\nenforcement operation and action by The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI | Treasury | INCD\n\n(Images of vps-agent[.]net website)\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI | Treasury | INCD\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI | Treasury | INCD\n\n### Continuing Cyber-Enabled Information Operations\n\nThe authoring agencies have continued to observe ASA conducting cyber-enabled information operations\nover the past year. In particular, following the October 7, 2023, HAMAS attack against Israel, ASA used\nvarious cover personas such as \"Cyber Flood\" and \"Contact-HSTG.\" In its “Contact-HSTG” operation, ASA\nattempted to contact family members of Israeli hostages, likely in an effort to cause additional\npsychological effects and inflict further trauma on family members. An example of this messaging is shown\nbelow:\n\nSMS translation:\n\n_“Family_\n\n_This the message from Al-Qasam_\n\n_We offered your government hostage exchange deal, but_\n\n_It did not accept it._\n\n_This is our message:_\n\n_Releasing all the Zionists hostages in exchange_\n\n_To all Palestinians prisoners_\n\n_In order to know what is the condition of all your hostages_\n\n_Keep in touch with us”_\n\nASA was also responsible for a cyber-enabled influence operation in December 2023 that impacted a USbased Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) streaming company. The operation, which used the persona name\n\"For-Humanity,\" leveraged unauthorized access to IPTV streaming services to disseminate crafted\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI | Treasury | INCD\n\nmessaging pertaining to the Israel-HAMAS military conflict. The authoring agencies warn that future ASA\ncyber operations may either directly target, or collaterally impact, US organizations.\n\nThe authoring agencies assess that, since April 2024, ASA has used the online persona “Cyber Court” to\npromote the activities of several purported hacktivist groups conducting malicious activity against various\ncountries as a means of protesting the Israel-HAMAS conflict in Gaza. Using “Cyber Court,” ASA promotes\nthe hacking activities of cover-hacktivist groups - run by ASA itself - including “Makhlab al-Nasr,” “NET\nHunter,” “Emirate Students Movement,” and “Zeus is Talking.” “Cyber Court” posted updates regarding\nthese groups' purported activities on its Telegram channel (@cybercourt_io) as well as its website\ncybercourt[.]io[9]. ASA has also been developing an information operation campaign named ”Sample,”\nintended to intimidate Israelis via crowdsourcing reporting to positively identify specified individuals, such\nas members of Israeli law enforcement.\n\n(Content related to ”Sample” information operations campaign)\n\nIn July 2024, the actors used \"VPS-agent\" infrastructure to compromise a French commercial dynamic\ndisplay provider, attempting to display photo montages denouncing the participation of Israeli athletes in\nthe 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This cyberattack was coupled with disinformation maneuvers\nincluding publication of a fake news article onto a French collaborative media website and the spread of\nthreat messages to several Israeli athletes and their entourage under the banner of a fake French far-right\ngroup 'Regiment GUD', impersonating the real French far-right group 'GUD'.\n\n### IP Camera Targeting Activity\n\nASA also undertook a significant effort to enumerate and obtain content from IP cameras in Israel,\nincluding hours after the October 7, 2023, HAMAS attack. ASA enumerated IP addresses running the Real\nTime Streaming Protocol (TCP Port 554), primarily in Israel but also in Gaza and Iran. ASA made images\nand content from Israeli cameras available for clients to access via several servers beginning in October\n2023, including 5.230.56[.]148 and 77.91.74[.]158 – the latter IP being used between January and\n\n9 This domain has been seized in accordance with a seizure warrant issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1030(i) and 21\nU.S.C. § 853 issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as part of a joint law\nenforcement operation and action by The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI | Treasury | INCD\n\nOctober 2024. FBI has reliable information indicating this platform currently resides at the following three\nIP addresses:\n\n     - 195.26.87[.]80\n\n     - 213.109.147[.]97\n\n     - 185.110.188[.]112\n\nBelow is an example of Iranian camera content obtained by ASA:\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI | Treasury | INCD\n\n### Harvesting of Open Source Information\n\nAlso following October 7, 2023, ASA attempted to identify information concerning Israeli fighter pilots and\nUAV operators by searching for information across numerous platforms including Pastebin and LinkedIn.\nASA also used a Python script to identify location data from Instagram and correlate the data with the\nservice openstreetmap.org. ASA uses numerous online services for identifying people, reverse-image\nsearching, and username checks through open source software including knowem.com, facecheck.id,\nsocialcatfish.com. The actors also use online resources such as ancestry.com and familysearch.org in their\noperations. ASA will also search for information concerning previously leaked data sets, including using the\nresource ghostproject.fr.\n\n### Incorporation of Artificial Intelligence into Operations\n\nThe aforementioned “For-Humanity” operation is well-known for its incorporation of generative Artificial\nIntelligence (an AI-generated news anchor) as part of its messaging efforts. This is consistent with a greater\nASA effort to incorporate AI-related services into its operations including using the Remini AI Photo\nEnhancer, Voicemod (voicemod.net) and Murf AI (murf.ai) for voice modulation, and Appy Pie for image\ngeneration.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK[®] for Enterprise framework, version 15.1. See the MITRE\nATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK\ntactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&CK\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI | Treasury | INCD\n\nframework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK’s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping and CISA’s Decider\nTool.\n\n### Overview of Observed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nThe following sections outline cyber TTPs used by the ASA group during its current and historical cyber\noperations.\n\nASA will likely seek opportunities where they can achieve a high number of compromises with minimal\neffort by targeting hosting providers that would offer access to other entities, or targeting a specific content\nmanagement system used by entities in a specific sector.\n\n### Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Persistence, and Credential Access\n\nASA leverages numerous types of online datasets to conduct research against its targets, including both\nindividual users and organizations. When targeting individuals, ASA uses websites to identify email\naddresses associated with particular domains, conduct username checks against social media, and\nreverse image and email searching. When conducting target reconnaissance and enumeration against\norganizations, ASA uses open source resources such as Shodan, IP2location, and\nsubdomainfinder.c99[.]nl.\n\nFor initial access and exploitation, ASA uses commercially available tools such as Masscan, Acunetix, Burp\nSuite, and SQLMap.\n\n### Resource Development\n\nASA has used the aforementioned cover hosting resellers ”Server-Speed” and ”VPS-Agent” to procure\noperational infrastructure. The actors also heavily leverage commercial VPN service providers such as\nPrivate Internet Access, Windscribe, ExpressVPN, Urban VPN, and NordVPN.\n\n### Credential Access\n\nASA has accessed victim infrastructure via automated password-guessing attempts as well as online\nresources for cracking password hashes.\n\n### Command and Control\n\nASA has used an exploitation tool for gathering information about an end point and running remote\ncommands.\n\nASA has also used the file 'Google Chrome Installer.msi', which is a Microsoft Software Installer package\nfile. This file originally contained the instructions and information needed to install a security patch for the\nGoogle Chrome Web browser (version 126.0.6478.255). The msi file has been altered to run an\nexecutable after the Google Chrome install/update. This executable was compiled with the name bd.exe\nand was compiled by the threat actor under a project name of 'bd'.\n\nThe 'bd' executable is a remote access trojan (RAT) program that is heavily obfuscated. This program will\ncollect basic system information about the infected computer and connect to a web-server that is specified\nwhen the program is run on the command line, when an appropriate de-obfuscation key is also passed on\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI | Treasury | INCD\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI | Treasury | INCD\n\nthe command line. As encoded in this specific MSI package, the de-obfuscation key is '8765' and the webserver address is 'connect.il-cert.net'. Once the malicious MSI package is run, Google Chrome will be\ninstalled on the victim computer and then the RAT is executed. This malicious program will check in to the\nweb-server and await instructions to be passed to it via responses to the requests 'bd' issues.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques\n\nSee Table 1 to Table for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory and previous\nFBI reports on this particular actor.\n\n_Table 1.

The CPGs provide a minimum set of\npractices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST\nbased the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance designed to protect against the most\ncommon and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector\nCybersecurity Performance Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended\nbaseline protections.\n\nThe authoring agencies recommend all organizations implement the following mitigations:\n\n  - Closely review any successful authentications to your network or company accounts from Virtual\nPrivate Network services such as Private Internet Access, Windscribe, ExpressVPN, Urban VPN, and\nNordVPN.\n\n  - If your organization’s information was previously compromised, take appropriate measures to\nensure security measures are in place to protect against the leveraging of any exfiltrated data to\nconduct further malicious activity against your network.\n\n  - Employ regular updates to applications and the host operating system to ensure protection against\nknown vulnerabilities.\n\n  - Establish, and backup offline, a \"known good\" version of the relevant server and a regular change\nmanagement policy to enable monitoring for alterations to servable content with a file integrity\nsystem.\n\n  - Employ user input validation to restrict local and remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.\n\n  - Implement a least-privileges policy on the Webserver to:\n\n`o` Reduce adversaries’ ability to escalate privileges or pivot laterally to other hosts.\n\n`o` Control creation and execution of files in particular directories.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR** FBI | Treasury | INCD\n\n     - If not already present, consider deploying a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between your organization’s\nWeb-facing systems and corporate network. Limiting the interaction and logging traffic between the\ntwo provide a method to identify possible malicious activity.\n\n     - Consider reputable hosting services for websites and content management systems (CMS), if you\nneed assistance in configuring and maintaining your external facing applications.\n\n     - Consider employing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block inbound malicious traffic.\n\n     - Review the logs generated by security devices for signs that your organization’s external networks\nare being scanned for vulnerabilities.\n\n     - Ensure a secure configuration of Webservers. All unnecessary services and ports should be\ndisabled or blocked. All necessary services and ports should be restricted where feasible. This can\ninclude whitelisting or blocking external access to administration panels and not using default login\ncredentials.\n\n     - Use a reverse proxy or alternative service to restrict accessible URL paths to known legitimate\nones.\n\n     - Conduct regular system and application vulnerability scans to establish areas of risk. While this\nmethod does not protect against zero-day attacks, it will highlight possible areas of concern.\n\n     - Disable CMS features if they are not needed, and configure them to:\n\n       - Disable remote file editing\n\n       - Restrict file execution to specific directories\n\n       - Limit login attempts applications.\n\n## Validate Security Controls\n\nIn addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and validating\nyour organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for\nEnterprise framework in this advisory.
