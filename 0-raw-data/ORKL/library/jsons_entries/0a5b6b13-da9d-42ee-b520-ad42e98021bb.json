The detection opportunities rely on open-source tools (e.g., Velociraptor)\nand rules (e.g., Yara, Sigma) so they can be used by any company or the wider community.\n\nSEC Defence offers Threat Hunting and Incident Response services to support clients in\npromptly detecting and responding to cyber threats such as BumbleBee. To request\n[immediate support in case of a potential incident or breach, get in touch with SEC Defence.](https://sec-consult.com/incident-response/sec-defence/)\n\n## Introduction\n\n**Ransomware attacks, combined with data exfiltration, are one of the most relevant cyber**\n**[threats for companies worldwide, as reported by the Enisa Threat Landscape 2022.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022)**\nAccording to the [NIST's Incident Handling guide, the prevention and detection phases of](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf)\nthose types of attacks can be crucial to minimize the potential incident's impacts (e.g.,\noperational, legal, etc.).\n\n\n-----\n\nTo gain initial access into a victim s infrastructure, ransomware operators abuse mostly the\nfollowing techniques:\n\n**Phishing campaigns, also conducted by initial access brokers, that deliver malware1**\nwhich acts as a loader for subsequent post-exploitation frameworks like Cobalt Strike\nor Meterpreter.\n**Exposed vulnerable services that can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands**\nremotely.\n**Compromised accounts that allow the threat actor to login into services like VPN.**\n\n[One of the newest malware families, first discovered by the Google Threat Analysis Group in](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/exposing-initial-access-broker-ties-conti/)\n2021, and delivered by initial access brokers is called BumbleBee and it has been used by\n[the well-known Russian group Wizard Spider which has been linked to ransomware like](https://blog.bushidotoken.net/2022/11/the-continuity-of-conti.html)\nConti, Quantum, Royal, etc.\n\nIn this article, SEC Defence shows the analysis that has been performed of a BumbleBee\nsample and provides some threat hunting methods to detect BumbleBee techniques.\n\n## BumbleBee\n\n[BumbleBee is commonly distributed via malicious ISO images. and abuses thread-hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1039/)\nemails to induce the victims to download the ISO file and subsequently open it. When\nexecuted, BumbleBee performs mainly the following actions:\n\nVerifies if it is running in an analysis or sandboxing environment by performing various\nchecks like enumerating the registry keys and drivers related to VMware or VirtualBox.\nGathers information about the compromised system through WMI queries.\nConnects to the command and control (C2) servers embedded into the malware\nconfiguration that is RC4 encrypted.\n\nFurthermore, BumbleBee can also receive specific commands from the threat actors that can\nbe useful for further malicious actions like achieving persistence and downloading other\nmalware (e.g., Cobalt Strike).\n\n\n-----",
