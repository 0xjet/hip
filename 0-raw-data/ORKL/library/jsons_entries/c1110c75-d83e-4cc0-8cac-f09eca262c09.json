These threat intelligence reports\nsummarize individual threat exploits and provide practical recommendations for protecting\nagainst them.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this [free research report, we analyze Quasar RAT which has been widely leveraged by](https://www.qualys.com/docs/whitepapers/qualys-wp-stealthy-quasar-evolving-to-lead-the-rat-race-v220727.pdf)\nmultiple threat actor groups targeting both government and private organizations in\nSoutheast Asia and other geographies.\n\nQuasar RAT (aka: CinaRAT, Yggdrasil) is an open-source remote access trojan (RAT) that\nhas been widely adopted by bad actors due to its powerful techniques. Quasar RAT has\nbeen behind multiple attack campaigns by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and\nmost recently, a Chinese threat group APT10 was observed using it for targeted attacks.\n\nThe intelligence in this report can be used by SOC analysts, threat hunting teams,\ncyberthreat intelligence analysts, and digital forensics teams.\n\nThis complementary paper examines the evolution of the Quasar RAT payload, unpacks its\nconfiguration, details a technical analysis of the malware payload, and finally presents\n[possible detection parameters using Qualys Multi-Vector EDR.](https://www.qualys.com/apps/endpoint-detection-response/)\n\n[Download your copy of the report now to learn about our key research findings:](https://www.qualys.com/docs/whitepapers/qualys-wp-stealthy-quasar-evolving-to-lead-the-rat-race-v220727.pdf)\n\nQuasar RAT is a full featured remote administration tool that has been open source\nsince at least 2014\nThe .NET executable has its communication encrypted through HTTPS which uses a\nTLS1.2 protocol\nQuasar RAT features provide techniques related to persistence, injection, and defense\nmechanisms\nThe RAT has been actively leveraged by various APT groups such as APT10 to\nachieve its malicious objectives\n\nGet your copy of this new Qualys Threat Research Report now.
