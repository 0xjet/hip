Specifically, we address a ransomware variant (EDA2) observed in attacks on a Canadian government healthcare\norganization and a Canadian medical research university, as well as an infostealer variant (AgentTesla) observed in attacks against various\nother targets (e.g, a United States defense research entity, a Turkish government agency managing public works, a German industrial\nmanufacturing firm, a Korean chemical manufacturer, a research institute located in Japan and medical research facilities in Canada).\n\n[None of the malware samples mentioned in this blog were successful in reaching their intended targets. Our threat prevention platform](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention)\nwith [WildFire detects activity associated with these threat groups while simultaneously updating the ‘malware’ category within the URL](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\nFiltering solution for malicious and/or compromised domains that have been identified.\n\n## Ransomware Campaign\n\n**Campaign Overview**\n\nBetween March 24, 2020 at 18:25 UTC and March 26 at 11:54 UTC, Unit 42 observed several malicious emails sent from the spoofed address\nnoreply@who[.]int (actual sender IP address at the time of the attack was 176.223.133[.]91) to several individuals associated with a Canadian\ngovernment health organization actively engaged in COVID-19 response efforts, and a Canadian university conducting COVID-19 research.\nThe emails all contained a malicious Rich Text Format (RTF) phishing lure with the file name 20200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.doc, (SHA256:\n62d38f19e67013ce7b2a84cb17362c77e2f13134ee3f8743cbadde818483e617), which, when opened with a vulnerable application, attempted\nto deliver a ransomware payload using a known shared Microsoft component vulnerability, [CVE-2012-0158.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-0158)\n\nIt is interesting to note that even though the file name clearly references a specific date (March 23, 2020), the file name was not updated over\nthe course of the campaign to reflect current dates. It is also interesting that the malware authors did not attempt to make their lures appear\nlegitimate in any way; it is clear from the first page of the document that something is amiss.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Ransomware phishing lure\n\n**SHA256** **Subjects** **Spoofed Sender** **File name** **C2 Domain**\n\n\n62d38f19e67013ce7b2a84cb17362c77e2f13134ee3f8743cbadde818483e617 Coronavirus\ndisease\nCOVID19\n\n_Table 1. Ransomware campaign attributes_\n\n**Post-Infection**\n\n\nnoreply@who[.]int 20200323sitrep-63covid19.doc\n\n\nwww.tempinfo.96\n\n\nOnce opened with vulnerable document viewing software, the malicious attachment drops a ransomware binary to disk at C:\\Users\\<victim\nusername>\\AppData\\Local\\svchost.exe, then executes it. It is worth mentioning that the dropped binary has the hidden attribute set, and has\nan Adobe Acrobat icon.\n\nWhen the ransomware binary is executed, an HTTP GET request for the resource tempinfo.96[.]lt/wras/RANSOM20.jpg is initiated. This image\nis the main ransomware infection notification displayed to the victim:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Ransomware notification image\nThis image is then saved to disk at C:\\Users\\<victim username>\\ransom20.jpg, and is subsequently set as the victim user’s desktop wallpaper.\nAt the time of the attack, the domain tempinfo.96[.]lt resolved to the IP address 31.170.167[.]123.\n\nAfter the image is downloaded, an HTTP POST request to the resource www.tempinfo.96[.]lt/wras/createkeys.php is made containing the user\nname and host name of the victim. Of particular note is that connectivity to the remote host is first checked via use of HTTP 100 Continue\nprior to the malware transmitting the host details:\n\nFigure 4. Network traffic, victim host detail transfer\n\n\n-----\n\nO ce t e e ote co a d a d co t o (C ) se e success u y ece es t e ct s deta s, t t e p oceeds to c eate a custo ey based o\nthe username/hostname details and sends the key back to the infected host for further processing. Once the key is received from the C2\nserver, the infected host then initiates an HTTP POST request to the resource www.tempinfo.96[.]lt/wras/savekey.php containing its hostname\nand the main decryption key for the host, which is, in itself, AES encrypted:\n\nFigure 5. Network traffic, ransomware key exchange\n\nAt this point, encryption of the victim’s files begins. This particular ransomware binary is configured to encrypt files with the following file\nextensions:\n\n\".abw\", \".aww\", \".chm\", \".dbx\", \".djvu\", \".doc\", \".docm\", \".docx\", \".dot\", \".dotm\", \".dotx\", \".epub\", \".gp4\", \".ind\", \".indd\", \".key\", \".keynote\", \".mht\",\n\".mpp\", \".odf\", \".ods\", \".odt\", \".ott\", \".oxps\", \".pages\", \".pdf\", \".pmd\", \".pot\", \".potx\", \".pps\", \".ppsx\", \".ppt\", \".pptm\", \".pptx\", \".prn\", \".prproj\", \".ps\",\n\".pub\", \".pwi\", \".rtf\", \".sdd\", \".sdw\", \".shs\", \".snp\", \".sxw\", \".tpl\", \".vsd\", \".wpd\", \".wps\", \".wri\", \".xps\", \".bak\", \".bbb\", \".bkf\", \".bkp\", \".dbk\", \".gho\",\n\".iso\", \".json\", \".mdbackup\", \".nba\", \".nbf\", \".nco\", \".nrg\", \".old\", \".rar\", \".sbf\", \".sbu\", \".spb\", \".spba\", \".tib\", \".wbcat\", \".zip\", \"7z\", \".dll\", \".dbf\"\n\nThe encryption algorithm is fairly simple, and, when encrypted, files are renamed with a .locked20 extension:\n\nFigure 6. Ransomware encryption source code\n\nAdditionally, this ransomware binary has a particularly substantial limitation; it is hardcoded to only encrypt files and directories that are on the\nvictim’s desktop.\n\nFigure 7. Ransomware encryption initiation source code\n\n**Threat Identification**\n\nFrom the code structure of the binary and the host based and network based behaviors of the ransomware, Unit 42 has determined that the\nransomware variant used in this attack is EDA2, an open-source ransomware variant associated with a larger, parent ransomware family\ncalled HiddenTear.\n\n[Additional information on this ransomware variant can be found here.](https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2016/01/25/eda2-open-source-ransomware-code-used-real-life-attacks/)\n\n### AgentTesla Campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nt s ot a su p se to see a spa acto s a so ta g ad a tage o t e o go g CO 9 pa de c c s s a d us g CO 9 as a u e to\nentice victims to click on malicious attachments and infect their systems. Figure 9 gives an example of one such malspam campaign with a\nCOVID-19 lure.\n\nFigure 8.

After further analysis of the attachments we found that the\nsamples were droppers delivering variants of the AgentTesla malware family. AgentTesla is an info-stealing malware which has been around\n[since 2014. Since AgentTesla has been sold in multiple forums commonly visited by cyber criminals, it’s use has significantly grown in the past](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/who-is-agent-tesla/)\nyears and has been one of the top malware family of choice of the SilverTerrier threat actor, infamous for BEC campaigns. More details on the\n[SilverTerrier campaigns can be found in the recent Unit 42 update here.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/silverterrier-2019-update/)\n\nFigure 9. Maltego chart of the AgentTesla campaign\n\nAll the associated samples connected to the same C2 domain for exfiltration- ftp[.]lookmegarment[.]com. Our analysis also shows that the\nAgentTesla samples had hard coded credentials used to communicate with the C2 over FTP. Figure 11 shows the exfiltration over FTP, where\nthe C2 is running a Pure-FTPd server.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Network traffic, exfiltration\n\nIt is also important to note that the email sender domain, liquidroam[.]com, and the C2 domain, lookmegarment[.]com, are legit business\ndomains providing sales of electric skateboards and garment textiles, respectively. It is likely that the domains have been compromised and\ntheir infrastructure being used in the wider campaign of the cyber criminals.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe objective of this blog was to give a deeper understanding on some of the types of cybercrime campaigns being faced by multiple critical\nindustries dealing with the urgent and critical response efforts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is clear from these cases that the threat actors\nwho profit from cybercrime will go to any extent, including targeting organizations that are in the front lines and responding to the pandemic on\na daily basis.\n\nWhile this blog specifically focused on two campaigns, Unit 42 is tracking multiple campaigns with COVID-19 themes being used by threat\nactors on a daily basis and this trend is likely going to continue for weeks to come. We will continue updating the Unit 42 blog with new findings\nand observations on how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is being leveraged by cyber criminals for illicit profit.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are already protected from the mentioned threats by:\n\nDeploying Threat ID 1114703, 2878137, 2855181, 2850820, 2811429, 2888946\nWildfire successfully classifies the samples as malware\nC2 domains are classified as malicious in DNS Security\n\n### IOCs\n\nRansomware Campaign:\n\nRTF Phishing Lure: 62d38f19e67013ce7b2a84cb17362c77e2f13134ee3f8743cbadde818483e617\n\nAdditional related RTF Lure (origin unknown):\n\n42f04025460e5a6fc16d6182ee264d103d9bcd03fffd782c10f0b2e82b84f768\n\nRansomware Binary:\n\n2779863a173ff975148cb3156ee593cb5719a0ab238ea7c9e0b0ca3b5a4a9326\n\nMailing Infrastructure:\n\n176.223.133[.]91\n\nC2:\n\ntempinfo.96[.]lt\n\n31.170.167[.]123\n\nAgentTesla Campaign:\n\nAgentTesla Samples:\n\nfd4b4799079cdd970eec3884bef4771624a55297086041fd4e7fcefb1a86d08e\n\n67b44bbf3f69e170f1e8ddea8d992dc83cfd351f06a28338b37dc16ad74826ef\n\n14f6b1979ccc5d29c7b143009472d1edcfcdf0025bc2fa84ee445f17f091dd9a\n\n\n-----\n\n590f84008dfd489fbf98d83e281fbb38c40d890169a9dbd482ff1f184cfb0970\n408bd4ffdff006738289dc51f1e51b00662508628ef8bb6147e3d88d4740ec4b\n\nC2:\n\nftp[.]lookmegarment[.]com\n\n157[.]245.78[.]47\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
