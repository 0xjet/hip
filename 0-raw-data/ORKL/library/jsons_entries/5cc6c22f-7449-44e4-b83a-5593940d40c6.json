The intrusion used IcedID as the initial access\nbroker: many ransomware actors use another malware campaign to gain access to an\ninternal network and IcedID has become a very popular choice for that.\n\nIn this blog post, I use the IOCs shared by the DFIR Report to uncover more command and\ncontrol infrastructure linked to IcedID, some of which has not been published before.\n\n[IcedID, also known as Bokbot, was discovered by IBM X-Force in November 2017. Initially](https://securityintelligence.com/new-banking-trojan-icedid-discovered-by-ibm-x-force-research/)\noperating as a banking trojan, it has since made the same move that Emotet had made\npreviously and is now used to serve a foothold within a network that is than later used by a\nransomware operation.\n\nThe DFIR Report’s analysis lists cikawemoret34[.]space and nomovee[.]website as IcedID\ncommand and control servers used during the intrusion. These domains were hosted on the\nIP addresses 206.189.10[.]247 and 161.35.109[.]168 respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is always a good idea to see what other domains were hosted on these IP addresses.\nUsing Silent Push passive DNS data, on 206.189.10[.]247 I also found the following\ndomains:\n```\n33nachoscocso[.]website\nberxion9[.]online\nchinavillage[.]uno\nemanielepolikutuo1[.]website\ngommadrilla[.]space\noskolko[.]uno\nprolomstenn[.]fun\n\n```\nWhile on 161.35.109[.]168 I also found:\n```\naspergerr[.]top\nkneelklil[.]uno\nnewstationcosmo8[.]space\n\n```\nUnsurprisingly, most of these domains have been publicly linked to IcedID.\n\nAll the domains were registered through Porkbun in February or March and parked there\ninitially before switching to Cloudflare’s nameservers and pointing to the aforementioned IP\naddresses. This switching happened at different times for different domains, suggesting that\nthe switch was made just before a domain was used in a campaign.\n\nOne domain stands out: emanielepolikutuo1[.]website first switched to using nameservers\nbelonging to Russia’s Server Space and pointing to the IP address 143.198.25[.]214, before\nswitching to Cloudflare and 206.189.10[.]247 a little over a week later.\n\nSo, I had a look at 143.198.25[.]214 and found the following domains hosted there:\n```\napouvtios2[.]uno\nawefoplou5[.]site\nchajkovsky[.]space\ndaserwewlollipop[.]club\ndastemodaste[.]fun\nemanielepolikutuo1[.]website\nohbluebennihill[.]website\nseconwowa[.]cyou\nviolonchelistto[.]space\nzomonedu3[.]website\n\n```\nAll but one of these domains were registered at Porkbun, the exception is the slightly older\nseconwowa[.]cyou, which was registered through NameSilo.\n\nJust like the previous set of domains, all these domains switched to using Cloudflare’s\nnameservers at some point and switched IP addresses at the same time. However, some\nfirst pointed to 83.97.20[.]176 before pointing to 143.198.25[.]214. On the former IP\naddresses, I also found four more domains:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nameripermanentno[.]website\nmazzappa[.]fun\nodichaly[.]space\nvaccnavalcod[.]website\n\n```\nAgain, these used same pattern of registering at Porkbun before switching to Cloudflare’s\nnameservers and the above IP address.\n\nOf the latter two lists of domains, only some have been publicly linked to IcedID activity.\nHowever, the similarities noted above, as well as the choice of TLDs, make me confident\nthese domains belong to the same infrastructure and either have been or will be used in\nIcedID campaigns.\n\nThere is a pattern there: a domain gets registered, usually at Porkbun, and parked there for\na while before its nameservers switch to those of Cloudflare when the domain points to a\nnew IP address. This IP address hosts multiple of these domains. There is also a\npreference for slightly unusual top-level domains.\n\nUsing this pattern, I dug into the Silent Push data trove to look for other domains that\nsatisfied this pattern. I had to sift through the results to filter out false positives, but I ended\nup with a list of domain names and corresponding IP addresses of which I consider it very\nlikely they belong to IcedID’s infrastructure.\n\nMany of these indicators have been published previously, for example on Maltrail’s [GitHub,](https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail/blob/master/trails/static/malware/icedid.txt)\nbut many others have not been publicly linked to IcedID before.\n\nYou can find the full list of 58 IP addresses and 323 domain names (and 402 combinations:\n[some domain names have pointed to multiple IP addresses) on our GitHub page.](https://github.com/Silent-Push/IOCs/blob/main/icedid_c2.csv)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMalware like IcedID plays a crucial role in many large cybercrime campaigns, including\nransomware, which can be very costly for the victim organization. Early knowledge of\nindicators is thus important, even if these indicators haven’t all been publicly linked to the\nmalware. In this blog post, I have shown how I was able to find hundreds of such indicators\nby spotting some patterns in the domain behaviour.\n\n_Thanks to John Jensen and Ken Bagnall for their contributions._\n\n## Subscribe\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nThank you!\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ken Bagnall](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6081bc3c4920d358398731f8)\n\n\n-----",
