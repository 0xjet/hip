[Telegram was the](https://sensortower.com/ios/us/telegram-fz-llc/app/telegram-messenger/686449807/overview) most\ndownloaded app worldwide for January 2021 with more than 63 million installs, and has\nsurpassed 500 million monthly active users. This popularity also extends to the cybercriminal community. Malware authors are increasingly using Telegram as a ready-made\ncommand and control (C&C) system for their malicious products, because it offers several\nadvantages compared to conventional web-based malware administration.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore why criminals are increasingly using Telegram for malware control,\nusing the example of a new malware variant called ‘ToxicEye’ that we have recently\nobserved in the wild.\n\n**Why hackers are turning to Telegram for malware control**\n\nThe first use of Telegram as the C&C infrastructure for malware was the ‘Masad’ infostealer back in 2017. The criminals behind Masad realized that using a popular IM service\nas an integral part of their attacks gave them a number of operational benefits:\n\n\n-----\n\nTelegram is a legitimate, easy-to-use and stable service that isn t blocked by\nenterprise anti-virus engines, nor by network management tools\nAttackers can remain anonymous as the registration process requires only a mobile\nnumber\nThe unique communications features of Telegram mean attackers can easily exfiltrate\ndata from victims’ PCs, or transfer new malicious files to infected machines\nTelegram also enables attackers to use their mobile devices to access infected\ncomputers from almost any location globally.\n\nSince Masad became available on hacking forums, dozens of new types of malware that\nuse Telegram for C&C and exploit Telegram’s features for malicious activity, have been\nfound as ‘off-the-shelf’ weapons in hacking tool repositories in GitHub.\n\n**ToxicEye, a new remote access trojan**\n\nOver the past three months, Check Point Research (CPR) has seen over 130 attacks using\na new multi-functional remote access trojan (RAT) dubbed ‘ToxicEye.’ ToxicEye is spread\nvia phishing emails containing a malicious .exe file. If the user opens the attachment,\nToxicEye installs itself on the victim’s PC and performs a range of exploits without the\nvictim’s knowledge, including:\n\nstealing data\ndeleting or transferring files\nkilling processes on the PC\nhijacking the PC’s microphone and camera to record audio and video\nencrypting files for ransom purposes\n\nToxicEye is managed by attackers over Telegram, communicating with the attacker’s C&C\nserver and exfiltrating data to it.\n\n**ToxicEye’s infection chain**\n\nThe attacker first creates a Telegram account and a Telegram ‘bot.’ A Telegram bot account\nis a special remote account with which users can interact by Telegram chat or by adding\nthem to Telegram groups, or by sending requests directly from the input field by typing the\nbot’s Telegram username and a query.\n\nThe bot is embedded into the ToxicEye RAT configuration file and compiled into an\nexecutable file (an example of a file name we found was ‘paypal checker by saint.exe’).\nAny victim infected with this malicious payload can be attacked via the Telegram bot, which\nconnects the user’s device back to the attacker’s C&C via Telegram.\n\nIn addition, this telegram rat can be downloaded and run by opening a malicious document\nseen in the phishing emails called solution.doc and by pressing on “enable content.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ToxicEye infection chain\n\n\n-----\n\nCode snippet example from open source telegram RAT repositories\n\n**Telegram RAT functionality**\n\nObviously, every RAT using this method has its own functionality, but we were able to\nidentify a number of key capabilities that characterize most of the recent attacks we\nobserved:\n\nData stealing features – the RAT can locate and steal passwords, computer\ninformation, browser history and cookies.\nFile system control – Deleting and transferring files, or killing PC processes and taking\nover the PC’s task manager.\nI/O hijacking – the RAT can deploy a keylogger, or record audio and video of the\nvictim’s surroundings via the PC’s microphone and camera, or hijack the contents of\nthe clipboard.\nRansomware features – the ability to encrypt and decrypt victim’s files.\n\n\n-----\n\nA functionality snippet example from chosen Telegram Rat project\n\n\n-----\n\n_[After installing the executable file, the attacker can hijack the computer through the bot (Source)](https://github.com/LimerBoy/ToxicEye?fbclid=IwAR1wJ-rQI_GYiLOiPSIxnnOuhmVfuD4APEQJgb9po-RwwC6bwNfa21bfgfw)_\n\n**How to spot if you’ve been infected and tips to remain protected**\n\n1. Search for a file called C:\\Users\\ToxicEye\\rat.exe – if this file exists on your PC,\n\nyou have been infected and must immediately contact your helpdesk and erase this\nfile from your system.\n2. Monitor the traffic generated from PCs in your organization to a Telegram C&C –\n\nif such traffic is detected, and Telegram is not installed as an enterprise solution, this\nis a possible indicator of compromise\n3. Beware of attachments containing usernames – malicious emails often use your\n\nusername in their subject line or in the file name of the attachment on it. These\nindicate suspicious emails: delete such emails, and never open the attachment nor\nreply to the sender.\n4. Undisclosed or unlisted recipient(s) – if the email recipient(s) has no names, or the\n\nnames are unlisted or undisclosed – this is a good indication this email is malicious\nand / or a phishing email.\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Always note the language in the email – Social engineering techniques are\n\ndesigned to take advantage of human nature. This includes the fact that people are\nmore likely to make mistakes when they’re in a hurry and are inclined to follow the\norders of people in positions of authority. Phishing attacks commonly use these\ntechniques to convince their targets to ignore their potential suspicions about an email\nand click on a link or open an attachment.\n6. Deploy an automated anti-phishing solution – Minimizing the risk of phishing\n\nattacks to the organization requires AI-based anti-phishing software capable of\nidentifying and blocking phishing content across all of the organization’s\ncommunication services (email, productivity applications, etc.) and platforms\n(employee workstations, mobile devices, etc.). This comprehensive coverage is\nnecessary since phishing content can come over any medium, and employees may\n[be more vulnerable to attacks when using mobile devices.
