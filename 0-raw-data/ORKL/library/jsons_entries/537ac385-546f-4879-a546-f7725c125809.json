This effort uses web\nanalytics—the technologies to collect, analyze, and report data from\nthe web—on compromised websites to passively collect information\nfrom website visitors.[1] The individuals behind this activity have\namassed vast amounts of information on web traffic and visitors\nto over 100 websites—sites that the threat actors have selectively\ncompromised to gain access to their collective audience.\n\nWeb analytics is used every day in much the same way by advertisers,\nmarketers and retailers for insight into the most effective ways to\nreach their customers and target audiences. This paper explores the\ndark side of web analytics by demonstrating how the same tools and\nmethods that fuel effective content delivery and e-commerce can\npotentially allow malicious actors to identify and target victims with\npinpoint precision.\n\n1 Kaspersky Labs, Symantec and iSIGHT Partners have reported on campaigns similar, and possibly\n\nrelated to, the activity we describe in this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### KEY FINDINGS\n\n\nThreat actors use web\nanalytics and open source\ntools to collect information\nabout desired victims and\ntheir computers to track,\nprofile, and possibly infect\nthem with targeted malware.\n\n\nThe perpetrators alter\nspecific websites to redirect\nvisitors to a profiling script\nwe call WITCHCOVEN.\nThis script collects detailed\ninformation about the user’s\ncomputer and installs a\npersistent tracking tool,\ncalled a “supercookie,” which\nbecomes part of a unique\n\"browser fingerprint\" that\ncan identify the user’s\ncomputer moving forward.\n\n\nWe believe the actors\nanalyze the collected data\nto identify unique users and\npair them with information\nabout their computer\nto later deploy exploits\ntailored to their particular\nsoftware and computer\nconfiguration.\n\n\nThe operation is most\nlikely the work of threat\nactors aligned with a\ngovernment based on\nthe extensive collection\nof data, the culprits’\noperational restraint, and\nour assessment of their\nprobable targets.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE OPERATION\n\n\neginning last year, we identified cyber\nactors integrating free, publicly available\ntools with custom scripts to monitor the\n\n#### B\n\nonline activities of Internet users without their\nknowledge,[2] just as corporations track the online\nactivity of web users around the world. We\nbelieve these cyber threat actors are building\nprofiles of potential victims and learning about\nthe vulnerabilities in users’ computers. These very\nsame technologies that marketing firms use to\ntrack their clients and ensure their websites work\non different types of web browsers can help cyber\nthreat actors better identify their victims and\ntailor future infection attempts.\n\nThe cyber threat actors start by compromising\nlarge numbers of legitimate websites. The\nwebsites are not randomly chosen targets of\nopportunity, but specifically selected as part of\na tactic called a strategic web compromise.[3] The\nattackers then modify the underlying HTML\ncode on the website’s home page (and often\nseveral subpages). This modification silently\nredirects visitors to a second website that has\nalso been compromised to host a profiling script\nthat we call WITCHCOVEN. WITCHCOVEN\nexecutes in the background without the user’s\nknowledge, capturing the visitor’s computer and\nbrowser configuration (see Figure 1 for more\ndetail) and placing a highly persistent tracking\ncookie (a “supercookie”) on their computer. In all,\nwe identified over 100 compromised websites\nredirecting visitors to more than a dozen\nWITCHCOVEN profiling servers.\n\n\nWhen an unsuspecting user visits any of the\nover 100 compromised websites, a small piece\nof inserted code—embedded in the site’s HTML\nand invisible to casual visitors—quietly redirects\nthe user’s browser to a second compromised\nwebsite without the user’s knowledge. This\nsecond website hosts the WITCHCOVEN\nscript,[4] which uses profiling techniques to collect\ntechnical information on the user’s computer.\nAs of early November 2015, we identified a\ntotal of 14 websites hosting the WITCHCOVEN\nprofiling script.\n\n###### We believe these cyber threat actors are building profiles of potential victims and learning about the vulnerabilities in users’ computers.\n\nThe script provides the perpetrators with data\non certain applications installed on the user’s\ncomputer. WITCHCOVEN uses a number\nof open source web tools to retrieve this\ninformation such as the software version. These\nweb tools are freely available, and website\ndesigners commonly use these (or similar) tools\nto enhance a users’ browsing experience. For\nexample, a site may routinely collect information\nabout the type and version of visitors’ web\nbrowsers to ensure that the site content displays\ncorrectly for as many visitors as possible.\n\n\n2 We detected a component of the process—the WITCHCOVEN profiling script—discussed later in the report.\n3 A strategic web compromise (SWC), also known as a “watering hole” attack, is a method of passively ensnaring victims as opposed to conducting an active attack such as a spear-phishing campaign. In\n\nan SWC, threat actors place exploit code on legitimate websites they anticipate their desired victims will visit as part of their normal online activity. If a targeted user travels to the compromised\nwebsite with a vulnerable computer, malware can be installed on their machine.\n4 Technical details on the WITCHCOVEN profiling script are available in the appendix.\n5 https://github.com/beefproject/beef/tree/master/modules/browser/detect_office\n6 http://www.pinlady.net/PluginDetect/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### WITCHCOVEN IN ACTION – PROFILING COMPUTERS AND TRACKING USERS\n\nA person browsing the web visits one\nof the more than 100 websites with malicious\ncode placed there by the threat actors\n**1**\n\nLegitimate—but compromised—websites\ncontain a script redirecting visitors to\nanother website\n\n**2**\n\nThe WITCHCOVEN script profiles\nthe computer, places a supercookie,\nand reads the browser fingerprint\n\n**3**\n\nThe threat actors collect the data from the\nWITCHCOVEN script and browser fingerprint\nand have several options for follow-on activity\n\n**4**\n\n**Figure 1 Strategic web compromise redirecting to WITCHCOVEN profiling script**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to collecting data about installed applications, browser plugins\nand their versions, the WITCHCOVEN script uses another open source tool\nknown as “evercookie”. evercookie is designed to create “extremely persistent\ncookies” on a user’s computer by:\n\ncreating cookies recreating deleted attempting\nin multiple storage cookies, as long to propagate\nlocations on the as any one cookie evercookies between\ncomputer remains intact on the browsers on the same\n\ncomputer computer\n\n\nFor these reasons, evercookies may be referred\nto as “supercookies” (because they use a broad\nrange of storage mechanisms) or “zombie cookies”\n(because they may be recreated after deletion).\nIn short, the evercookie provides a way to\nconsistently identify and track a specific website\nvisitor and is nearly impossible for the average\nuser to remove. The evercookie and the other data\ngathered by the WITCHCOVEN script are sent\nback to the compromised web server using an\nHTTP POST request.\n\n|creating cookies in multiple storage locations on the computer|recreating deleted cookies, as long as any one cookie remains intact on the computer|attempting to propagate evercookies between browsers on the same computer|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n###### COOKIES, THIRD-PARTY COOKIES, AND SUPERCOOKIES\n\n\nA website often uses HTTP\ncookies to track a visitor’s\nactions on that site. For\nexample, a news website\nmight track the user’s regional\npreference and an e-commerce\nsite might track items in a\nvisitor’s shopping cart while\nthey continue to browse other\ngoods. Normal HTTP cookies\nare used by a single website\nand typically enhance a user’s\nexperience on the web.\n\nThird-party cookies are HTTP\ncookies that can be set and\nread by third-party providers\n(such as ad companies or\n\n7 https://github.com/samyk/evercookie\n\n\nanalytics services) that place\ncontent on other websites.\nBecause these third-party\nproviders host content across\nmultiple websites, their\ncookies can track users across\nthose sites. A provider who\nhosts content on a sports site\nand a shopping site can tell\nif the same user visits both\nsites based on data (such as\nunique identifier) within the\nthird-party cookie. Over time,\nby noting the types of sites the\nuser visits, these companies\ncould build a demographic\nprofile of the user (age,\n\n\nincome, geographical\nlocation, interests), even\nif the user’s identity is not\nknown. While these cookies\nare not inherently malicious,\nsome users view them as\na privacy concern.\n\nBoth regular cookies and\nthird-party cookies are\ntypically stored in the user’s\nweb browser; modern\nbrowsers can be configured\nto periodically delete cached\ncookies or block certain\ntypes of cookies altogether.\nA “supercookie” refers to a\ncookie that uses alternate\n\n\nmethods for storage, such as\nFlash cookies. In most cases,\nthese cookies are not deleted\nby clearing the browser\ncache, making them much\nharder to find and remove. A\nsupercookie—with its unique\nidentifier—can therefore be\nused to persistently track and\nidentify a particular user over\ntime, even if the user attempts\nto block or delete cookies.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### A MEANS TO A SINISTER END?\n\n\nlthough the WITCHCOVEN profiling\nactivity may seem insidious or intrusive, so\nfar nothing we have described is overtly\n\n#### A\n\nmalicious. No exploit code has been delivered.\nNo website visitors have been compromised.\nAs we noted above, these types of profiling and\ntracking techniques have legitimate purposes to\noptimize user experience and support marketing,\ndemographic and sales analysis. So why did this\nparticular activity capture our attention?\n\nFirst, while many sites engage in profiling and\ntracking for legitimate purposes, those activities\nare typically conducted using normal third-party\nbrowser-based cookies and commercial ad\nservices and analytics tools. In this case, while\nthe individuals behind the activity used publicly\navailable tools, those tools had very specific\npurposes. Using evercookie in particular implies\nthat the actors wanted to ensure that visitors\ncould be identified and tracked persistently\nover time, without having to worry about users\nenabling private browsing or deleting persistent\ncookies. This goes beyond “normal” web analytics.\n\nSecond, the legitimate websites that redirected\nvisitors to the WITCHCOVEN script were\nthemselves compromised. This was not part\nof a generic marketing campaign or routine\nweb traffic analysis; someone deliberately and\nsurreptitiously placed the redirect code on\nmore than 100 compromised websites to profile\nvisitors to those sites.\n\nFinally—as we discuss below—while the redirect\ncode was widespread, the compromised websites\nthemselves were not arbitrary, but fell into\nan overall pattern. This led us to believe that\nthe activity was not random, but targeted, and\ntargeted at a specific set of users for what we\nbelieve is a unique purpose.\n\nThese observations led us to ask the questions:\nWhy would someone be gathering this particular\ndata in this manner? What could be the purpose\nbehind this activity?\n\nWe believe that the computer profiling data\ngathered by the WITCHCOVEN script, combined\nwith the evercookie that persistently identifies\na unique user, can— when combined with basic\nbrowser data available from HTTP logs—be used\nby cyber threat actors to identify users of interest\nand narrowly target those individuals with exploits\nspecifically tailored to vulnerabilities in their\ncomputer system.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ASSEMBLING\n THE PIECES\n\now could mostly innocuous information-gathering lead to\ninsidious, personalized attacks? Consider the implications\nof the data available to the WITCHCOVEN threat actors.\n\n#### H\n\nIn addition to the data explicitly collected by WITCHCOVEN\nitself, the threat actors behind this activity would also have access\nto additional data about the user’s browser, captured as part of\nnormal web traffic in the HTTP logs of the compromised server\nhosting the WITCHCOVEN script. This data would likely contain,\nat minimum,[8] standard information such as:\n\n\n###### …the threat actors behind this activity would also have access to additional data about the user’s browser, captured as part of normal web traffic in the HTTP logs of the compromised server hosting the WITCHCOVEN script.\n\n\nthe user’s IP address browser type and browser language how a visitor arrived\n\nversion (via the User- settings (via the Accept- at the site (via the\nAgent header) Language header) Referer header)\n\n8 Extensive research has been conducted on “browser fingerprinting”—using data available from a user’s web browser to uniquely identify individual users. While we have no indication that the\n\nindividuals behind WITCHCOVEN are leveraging browser fingerprinting to the full extent possible, the research shows the extent to which “innocuous” browser data can be used to identify\nindividuals with a high degree of accuracy. See, for example, the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s “Panopticlick” website (https://panopticlick.eff.org/index.php) illustrating this issue, and their\nassociated whitepaper (https://panopticlick.eff.org/browser-uniqueness.pdf).\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough we do not know for certain whether\nthe threat actors are making use of the log data,\nthe data would be readily available to them. If we\nsummarize the data available to the attackers (see\nTable 1), we see how they could build up a profile\n\n\nof potential victims. The threat actors could\nleverage the same data also used by legitimate\nbusinesses to perform web analytics to identify\nand profile users for potential malicious activity.\n\n\n**Table 1: Data available to threat actors and possible use**\n\n|DATA Version of Microsoft Office Version of browser plugins (Java, Flash, etc.) evercookie unique identifier evercookie date Referring website IP address Browser type / version User’s language|SOURCE WITCHCOVEN script WITCHCOVEN script evercookie (WITCHCOVEN script) evercookie (WITCHCOVEN script) WITCHCOVEN script and HTTP logs HTTP logs HTTP logs HTTP logs|POSSIBLE USE Identify older, unpatched, or vulnerable applications Identify older, unpatched, or vulnerable applications Identify specific “user” (even if identity not known) Date/time of first visit to any of the compromised sites; timestamp can be correlated with HTTP logs to identify visitor IP address May help further identify or refine victim profile Source network of potential victim; may identify a particular corporation or organization of interest Identify older, unpatched, or vulnerable browsers; identify browser with which another exploit (such as a Flash exploit) must be compatible May help further identify or refine victim profile|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### FINDING A NEEDLE IN A PILE OF NEEDLES\n\nhile the information above is potentially\nquite revealing about an individual user,\nit represents just one profile of one\n\n#### W\n\nrandom visitor to one website. The threat actors\nbehind WITCHCOVEN compromised more than\n100 websites, each of which might have thousands\nof unique visitors each day. If, as we suspect, the\nculprits intended to use the data to target specific\nvictims, they would need some means to analyze\nall of the data collected by the WITCHCOVEN\nprofiling script (and presumably the web server\nlog files) to identify specific targets for follow-on\ncyber operations.\n\nWe do not know exactly how the threat actors\nare using or processing the data. However,\ngiven the amount of data they have presumably\n\n\ncollected in a year of activity, it is likely that they\nwould need to use a large-scale data management\nand analysis system. At a minimum, this would\ninvolve a database of potential targets; it may\nalso involve performing web analytics on the\ncollected data to help identify targets of interest.\nTo do this, they may use web analytics tools such\nas a customer relationship management (CRM)\ndatabase just as many legitimate companies do. A\nCRM allows businesses to track sales, customer\ninteractions, and online marketing campaigns. The\nthreat actors behind this activity could mine the\ncollected data based on their targeting criteria,\nsearching for potential victims. The refinement\nprocess might look something like this:\n\n|1|Determine whether desired types of victims are visiting the compromised sites|\n|---|---|\n|2|Determine what other sites desired victims are visiting (to find possible new collection points)|\n|3|Identify specific victims|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTENDED TARGET\n\n An American diplomat assigned to Europe\n\n TARGET’S REAL-LIFE PROFILE\n\n Lives in a major European city\n\n Primarily speaks English\n\n Spends time online gathering data from European government and policy websites\n\n POSSIBLE WEB ANALYTICS PROFILE\n\n Supercookie tracking IP address shows User’s web browser shows that target location / source has English as its has visited other network matches that language setting infected embassy and of the intended target government websites\n\n**Figure 2 Example of refining the targeting**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### EMPLOY THE DATA\n TO DELIVER MALWARE\n\n\nnce specific targets have been\nidentified from the collected The perpetrators might note that a user is running an outdated version\ninformation, we believe the actors of Adobe Flash, known to be vulnerable to particular exploits.

When viewed\nas a whole, the sites were not random; they focused on a diverse but\nrelatively narrow set of interests. The compromised websites would attract\nvisitors involved in international travel, diplomacy, energy production and\npolicy, and international economics, as well as those serving in foreign\ngovernments—all individuals that would likely have information pertinent\nto a state’s strategic interests (see Figure 4 for the industry breakdown of\ncompromised websites).\n\n\n-----\n\nHigh Other includes Business\n\nVisa Tech Services, Healthcare,\n\nGovernmentLocal 3%Services 2% 6%Other Management, Manufacturing, Religious Institution,\n\nand Tourism.\n\nConstruction 3%\nand Engineering\n\n###### 3%\n\nInternational\n\nCulture\nand Exchange 4%\n\n###### 16%\n\nGovernment\n\nEnergy 5%\n\n###### 5%\n\nConsumer\n\nGoods\nand Retail\n\n###### 13%\n 8% Embassy\n\nMedia\n\n###### 7%\n\nInternational\n\nLaw\n\n###### 12%\n\nHigher Education\nand Research\n\n###### 8%\n\nNGO\n\n###### 10%\n\nEntertainment\nand Culture\n\n**Figure 4 Breakdown of compromised websites hosting the redirect to WITCHCOVEN script by industry as of Nov. 1, 2015**\n\n|Col1|Government|16%|Col4|International Law|7%|Col7|Construction and Engineering|3%|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||Embassy|13%||Media|8%||Local Government|3%|\n||Higher Education and Research|12%||Consumer Goods and Retail|5%||Visa Services|3%|\n||Entertainment and Culture|10%||Energy Company|5%||High Tech|2%|\n||NGO|8%||International Culture and Exchange|4%||Other|6%|\n\n\n-----\n\nGERMANY\n\n\n-----\n\n##### LIKELY INTENDED TARGETS:\n###### Government Officials and Executives\n in the U.S. and Europe\n\n\ne believe the compromised websites\nindicate the threat actors are especially\ninterested in collecting data from\n\n#### W\n\nexecutives, diplomats, government officials and\nmilitary personnel, particularly those in the U.S.\nand Europe.

The compromised sites in\nEurope probably attract Internet users interested\nin European politics, diplomacy, research\ninstitutes and business ties between Europe\nand the United States. In addition, compromised\nsites indicate the actors’ interest in targeting\nindividuals who work in the energy discovery,\nproduction, and technology industries, particularly\nthose involved in natural gas extraction and other\n\n\nenergy-related activities.

For the activity described in\n\n#### C\n\nthis report, mitigation is a challenge because the\nthreat actors are collecting information about\npotential targets in the course of a user's normal\nweb browsing activity. The collection is done using\nsimilar scripts, tools and methods that legitimate\nwebsites use to profile customers and enhance\nthe browsing experience.\n\nWhile profiling may feel invasive, it does not\ncompromise a victim’s computer. Individuals and\norganizations can take steps such as blocking\nscript execution or using third-party cookies,\n\n\nenabling privacy-enhanced browsing, or using\nanonymization services (such as the TOR browser)\nto help mask their identity. However, these\nmeasures may be burdensome to implement and,\nwhile blocking potentially malicious activity, may\nalso prevent legitimate site content from loading.\n\nOrganizations may be better off focusing on\ndetecting or preventing any follow-on attacks\nthrough best practices, including disabling\nunneeded plugins, ensuring that systems and\napplications are patched, and monitoring hosts\nand networks for suspicious traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### APPENDIX:\n###### Technical Details\n\n[The WITCHCOVEN profiling script (example MD5: 634438A50AE1990C4F8636801C410460) is](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/b8a609caefd4df29c0a251bb326c30f7c58793d2d353daefc0970f471e23e7b6/analysis/)\nwritten in JavaScript. The script contains the jQuery JavaScript library that is obfuscated to remove\nvariable names. The full script is quite lengthy but is largely comprised of identical or slightly modified\nversions of publicly available scripts, including evercookie, PluginDetect and the “detect Office” module\nfrom the Browser Exploitation Framework Project.\n\nThe script gathers the information listed in Table 1 and encodes it in a URL request to the compromised\nwebsite hosting the WITCHCOVEN script.\n\n**Table 2: URL request variables**\n\n|VARIABLE NAME sid fid aid mid jaid rid cid cart_id|VARIABLE DATA Adobe Shockwave version Adobe Flash version Adobe Reader version Microsoft Office version Oracle Java version HTTP Referer First date the evercookie supercookie was set (in epoch time), or the current date if the evercookie was never set 55 (static value; may vary across WITCHCOVEN instances)|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### To download this or other\n FireEye Threat Intelligence reports,\n\n visit: https://www.fireeye.com/reports.html\n\n\n[FireEye, Inc. | 1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035 | 408.321.6300 | 877.FIREEYE (347.3393) | info@fireeye.com | www.fireeye.com](mailto:info%40FireEye.com)\n\n© 2015 FireEye, Inc.
