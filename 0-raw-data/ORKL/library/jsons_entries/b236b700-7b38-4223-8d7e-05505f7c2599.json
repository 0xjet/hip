CryptoWall was the first ransomware to provide\ncustomer support on their payment sites, but PadCrypt's use of live chat allows victims to\ninteract with malware developers in real time. A feature like this could potentially increase\nthe amount of payments as the victim can receive \"support\" and be guided on the confusing\nprocess of making a payment.\n\n## PadCrypt offers a Live Support Chat Feature\n\nWith the release of PadCrypt, customer support is taken to a new level by the malware\ndevelopers offering live chat. In the main screen for the PadCrypt ransomware there is a link\ncalled Live Chat as shown in the image below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PadCrypt Ransomware Screen**\n\nIf a user clicks on the Live Chat option, it will open up another screen that allows the victim\nto send a message to the developers. When the developers respond, their reply will be shown\nin the same screen.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Live Chat feature of PadCrypt**\n\nAt this time, the Command & Control servers for PadCrypt are offline, so the ransomware\nwill not actually encrypt anything even though it shows you the ransomware screen.\nFurthermore, as the live support chat requires an active C2 server, the live chat functionality\nis broken as well.\n\n## PadCrypt makes it easy to remove the infection\n\nFor those who wish to remove the infection, PadCrypt makes it easy by also downloading and\ninstalling an uninstaller. We recently have seen a ransomware that allows you to enable and\ndisable the autorun for it, but this is the first time we have seen a ransomware that provides\nan uninstall program as well. When PadCrypt is installed, an uninstaller will also be\ndownloaded and installed at %AppData%\\PadCrypt\\unistl.exe.  Once the uninstaller is\nexecuted, it will remove all ransom notes and files associated with the PadCrypt infection.\nUnfortunately, all encrypted files will remain.\n\n## Ransomware developers love CryptoWall\n\nThere is something about CryptoWall that other ransomware developers just love to imitate\nit. This is also the case with PadCrypt as the executable has numerous references to\nCryptoWall in it. For example, the PDB for the PadCrypt executable is:\n```\nC:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2013\\Projects\\Cryptowall\n2.0\\Cryptowall\\bin\\Debug\\Obfuscated\\PadCrypt.pdb\n\n```\nThere are also numerous references to CryptoWall within the C# project for this ransomware.\nFor example, one of the namespaces for the ransomware is called Cryptowall.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CryptoWall Namespace**\n\n## PadCrypt Encryption Process\n\n**Update on 2/15/16 with more information about the encryption process. Thx**\n**MalwareHunterTeam.**\n\nPadCrypt is distributed via SPAM that contains a link to a zip archive that contains what\nappears to be a PDF file with a name like DPD_11394029384.pdf.scr. This PDF file, though,\nis actually an executable renamed to have the .scr .extension that when executed downloads\nthe package.pdcr and unistl.pdcr files from the now disabled Command & Control\nservers. The known C2 servers used by this ransomware include annaflowersweb.com,\nsubzone3.2fh.co, and cloudnet.online. The package.pdcr is the PadCrypt executable and the\nuninstl.pdcr is the uninstaller. Both of these files will be stored in the\n**%AppData%\\PadCrypt folder.**\n\nWhen PadCrypt.exe encrypts files, it will encrypt any data files, regardless of extension, that\nare in the targeted folders. When encrypting a victim's files it starts by scanning and\nencrypting the following folders.\n```\nC:\\Users\\[login_name]\\Downloads, C:\\Users\\[login_name]\\Documents, C:\\Users\\\n[login_name]\\Pictures, and C:\\Users\\[login_name]\\\n\n```\nWhen it has finished encrypting those folders it will then scan the C: drive and encrypt all\nfiles that are not located in the following folders or the contain the strings ProgramData,\nPerfLogs, Config.Msi, and $Recyle.Bin.\n```\nC:\\Users, C:\\NVIDIA, C:\\Intel, C:\\Documents and Settings, C:\\Windows, C:\\Program\nFiles, C:\\Program Files (x86), C:\\System Volume Information, and C:\\Recycler\n\n```\nFinally, PadCrypt will enumerate all local drives and encrypt any files that are detected.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the encryption process, PadCrypt will also delete the Shadow Volume Copies on the\ncomputer by executing the following command:\n```\nvssadmin delete shadows /for=z: /all /quiet\n\n```\nWhen it has finished encrypting the data it will create a IMPORTANT READ ME.txt file\non the desktop that contains ransom instructions as shown below.\n\n**IMPORTANT READ ME.txt**\n\nFinally, it will show the ransom screen as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PadCrypt Ransomware Screen**\n\nThis ransom screen will provide instructions on how to make .8 bitcoin payment or a ~$350\npayment via PaySafeCard or Ukash. The instructions also state that you have 96 hours to\nmake payment or the key will be destroyed.\n\nAt this time, it is currently unknown if there is a way to decrypt these files for free, but if we\nlearn anything further we will be sure to post it.\n\n## PadCrypt goes retro with its decrypter\n\nPadCrypt is the ransomware with many surprises including its colorful retro decryption\nprogram. When run, the decrypter will import a list of encrypted files\nfrom %AppData%\\PadCrypt\\Files.txt.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PadCrypt Decrypter**\n\nWhen a victim types start and press enter, the decrypter will look for the decryption key in\nthe %AppData%\\PadCrypt\\data.txt file. If one is detected it will decrypt any encrypted\nfiles listed in the files.txt file.\n\n### Files associated with PadCrypt\n```\n%Desktop%\\IMPORTANT READ ME.txt\n%AppData%\\PadCrypt\\unistl.exe\n%AppData%\\PadCrypt\\decrypted_files.dat\n%AppData%\\PadCrypt\\File Decrypt Help.html\n%AppData%\\PadCrypt\\PadCrypt.exe\n%AppData%\\PadCrypt\\Files.txt\n\n Registry entries associated with PadCrypt\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \"Microsoft Corp\" =\n\"%AppData%\\PadCrypt\\PadCrypt.exe\"\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \"PadCrypt\" =\n\"%AppData%\\PadCrypt\\PadCrypt.exe\"\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop \"Wallpaper\" =\n\"%AppData%\\PadCrypt\\Wallpaper.bmp\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop \"WallpaperStyle\" = 1\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop \"TileWallpaper\" = 0\n\n Related Articles:\n\n```\n[Indian airline SpiceJet's flights impacted by ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/indian-airline-spicejets-flights-impacted-by-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[PadCrypt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/padcrypt/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.

A flaw we may be able to use to decrypt the files without\npaying the ransom or at least study this interesting piece of malware more than the\ndevelopers intended.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Angoid - 6 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/4035/angoid/)\n\nUntil the C&amp;C servers come online, the malware is ineffective anyway by the looks\nof things:\nFrom the article:\n\n\"At this time, the Command &amp; Control servers for PadCrypt are offline, so the\nransomware will not actually encrypt anything even though it shows you the\nransomware screen.\"\n\nSo all you need to do if you suspect you're infected is to back all your data up (or ensure\nyour backup is up-to-date) and rip the ransomware out (Lawrence says that the\nuninstaller is downloaded at install time, and if this is from the same C&amp;C servers\nthen it won't be available).\n\n[julesPerox - 6 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/990187/julesperox/)\n\nHas anyone any solid advice on removal for a bit of a noob?! Had the SOS from the\nFinL this afternoon and tried first 'SpyHunter' software...I know... :(\nAppreciate any advice..download links to something that ACTUALLY works, and\ndoesn't hint of being a virus itself?!\nThanks all...\n\n[Post a Comment Community Rules](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/posting-guidelines/)\n\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\n\n[Not a member yet?
