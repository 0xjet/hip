    "plain_text": "# SunCrypt ransomware is still alive and kicking in 2022\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/suncrypt-ransomware-is-still-alive-and-kicking-in-2022/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/suncrypt-ransomware-is-still-alive-and-kicking-in-2022/)**\n\nBill Toulas\n\nBy\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nMarch 28, 2022\n02:35 PM\n0\n\n\n-----\n\nSunCrypt, a ransomware as service (RaaS) operation that reached prominence in mid-2020,\nis reportedly still active, even if barely, as its operators continue to work on giving its strain\nnew capabilities.\n\nSunCrypt was one of the early pioneers of triple extortion, including file encryption, threat to\npublish stolen data, and DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks on non-paying victims.\n\n[Despite this and the lack of ethic-minded targeting restrictions within the affiliate program,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/suncrypt-ransomware-shuts-down-north-carolina-school-district/)\nSunCrypt has failed to grow larger than a small private RaaS of a closed circle of affiliates.\n\n[According to a report by Minerva Labs, this stagnation hasn't stopped the malware authors](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/suncrypt-ransomware-gains-new-abilities-in-2022)\nfrom working on a new and better version of their strain, which the analysts analyzed to\ndetermine what changed.\n\n## New SunCrypt features\n\nThe new capabilities of the 2022 SunCrypt variant include process termination, stopping\nservices, and wiping the machine clean for ransomware execution.\n\nThese features have long existed on other ransomware strains, but for SunCrypt, they are\nvery recent additions. As Minerva comments, this makes it seem like it's still in an early\ndevelopment phase.\n\nThe process termination includes resource-heavy processes that can block the encryption of\nopen data files, such as WordPad (documents), SQLWriter (databases), and Outlook\n(emails).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cleaning feature is activated at the end of the encryption routine, using two API calls to\nwipe all logs. Although one would be enough, the author probably used two for redundancy.\nAfter all the logs are erased, the ransomware deletes itself from the disk using cmd.exe.\n\n**API calls that clear the event**\n\n**log** _(Minerva)_\nOne of the important [old features retained in the newest version is the use of I/O completion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/suncrypt-ransomware-sheds-light-on-the-maze-ransomware-cartel/)\nports for faster encryption through process threading.\n\nAlso, SunCrypt continues to encrypt both local volumes and network shares, and still\nmaintains an allowlist for the Windows directory, boot.ini, dll files, the recycle bin, and other\nitems that render a computer inoperable if they're encrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Latest ransom note used by SunCrypt** _(Minerva)_\n\n## Activity and outlook\n\nAccording to stats from submissions to ID Ransomware, which provides a good idea of\nransomware strain activity, SunCrypt is still encrypting victims but appears to have limited\nactivity.\n\n**SunCrypt submissions on ID Ransomware**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group may be targeting high-value entities and keeping the ransom payment\nnegotiations private, not drawing law enforcement attention and media coverage.\n\nMinerva mentions Migros as one of SunCrypt's recent victims, which Switzerland's largest\nsupermarket chain employing over 100,000 people.\n\nIn summary, SunCrypt is undoubtedly a real threat that hasn't been cracked yet, but whether\nor not the RaaS will grow into something more significant remains to be seen.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Clop ransomware gang is back, hits 21 victims in a single month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-gang-is-back-hits-21-victims-in-a-single-month/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
