In this article, yet another\npart of their ongoing campaign is uncovered. The amount of infected sites for this campaign\nis higher than in the previous cases.\n\nBefore diving into the infected sites, and the rough duration of the infections, information\nregarding the skimmer itself will be given.\n\n## Modus operandi\n\nThe modus operandi for this campaign is slightly different when comparing it to the other\nresearch that has been published so far. The skimmer, hosted on jquerycdn.su, changed four\ntimes during the campaign. The earliest recorded date of a hacked site linking to the\nskimmer domain is on the 30th of September 2019, whereas the latest new infection date is\nthe 19th of February 2020.\n\nIn the four versions of the skimmer that were used in this campaign, the used obfuscation\nmethod is the same as in the other reported campaigns. The first stage loads the actual\nskimmer script, which is polluted with garbage code. The skimmer itself is different,\ncompared to the first versions. The skimmer grabs all fields from the page, rather than all\nforms. Although the approach and script are different, the general concept remains the\nsame: obtaining credit card credentials.\n\nThe exfiltration domains are linked to other skimming campaigns from MageCart 12, like the\n[one Marco Ramilli wrote about, as well as](https://marcoramilli.com/2020/02/19/uncovering-new-magecart-implant-attacking-ecommerce/) [Jacob‘s blog.](https://www.goggleheadedhacker.com/blog/post/16)\n\n## Infected web shops\n\nAll but three affected web shops have been contacted via e-mail or their web form on the\n21st of February 2020. For each of the three uninformed web shops, there is a note in the list\nwith the reason why. Similar to previous cases, I did not receive any response back at the\ntime of writing (which is the 25th of February 2020).\n\nThe given dates are based upon the data set I created. This set is, by definition, not 100%\naccurate. As such, the actual dates might slightly differ. Additionally, it is possible that a\nwebsite was not infected for the complete time between the begin and the end date, but this\ninformation is not present in my data set.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe mentioned dates are based upon the most accurate information from the data set and\nlimited to this skimmer domain. Some sites are infected with another domain that is operated\nby the same group. To avoid confusion and keep things clear, this has not been included in\nthis post.\n\nNote that the skimmer domain (jquerycdn.su) has been down for a few days at least. This\nmeans that several sites that are still infected, are currently not actively sharing credit cards\nwith the criminal actors, but this is subject to change at any given moment.\n\nThe list below is ordered from the past until the present, meaning the oldest infections are\nlisted first. The end date is not taken into account at the sorting.\n\n[BioPets was infected from the](https://biopets.ro/) [30th of September 2019 and the infection is ongoing](https://urlscan.io/result/3972f36d-6525-490f-a97c-8087238d23a0/)\n[until now.
