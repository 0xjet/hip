Additionally, tutorials for the development\nand support of botnets specifically designed to execute malware\nwith functions specifically repurposed to conduct fraudulent\nactivity such as logging keystrokes (keylogging) remained\nplentiful within the criminal underground throughout 2020.\n\nThe figure above breaks down the botnet activity of the most\nactive botnets since Emotet’s takedown. After the takedown\nin January 2021, the use of the other four main botnets has\nincreased at varying levels for campaigns targeting victims.\n\n\nOutside of basic tutorials or methods for the development\nof a botnet with limited features, statistics across the security\n[community in 2020 continued to reveal that more prolific strains](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/01/07/december-2020s-most-wanted-malware-emotet-returns-as-top-malware-threat/)\nof malware commonly associated with malicious botnet activity\nremained the most popular strains affecting all industry verticals\nby the end of the year.\n\nThe successful law enforcement takedown of the Emotet\nbotnet has left a void in the loader space. Despite frequent breaks,\nthe botnet was one of the most prolific and profitable threats in\n2019 and 2020. While a large number of malware families use\nspam and loaders to generate infections, only some of them\nrepresent a threat to enterprises because of their capabilities,\ntheir follow-on infection chains to deploy ransomware and their\nsheer volume. This eliminates common keyloggers such as\nAgentTesla or Formbook and narrows the focus to 4 main botnet\nfamilies: TrickBot, QakBot, IcedID, and Dridex. There are also\nspecific distribution tools and methods that these botnets use\nto supplement or substitute their spam campaigns.\n\nAlthough law enforcement [succeeded in taking down the](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\nEmotet botnet, Emotet and TrickBot were suspected to have been\noperated for a time by different threat actor groups. However,\nTrickBot’s operators have used Emotet as a dropper/loader for\ntheir own malware variant. The hosts are being distributed to\nbrokers and used as initial access vectors for corporate network\ncompromise and potential distribution of ransomware variants,\nincluding the Ryuk ransomware variant. 2 malware strains that\n\n\n-----\n\nhave continued to be observed working in tandem via the\n[operators of Emotet in 2021 include TrickBot and QakBot, with](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-is-now-heavily-spreading-qakbot-malware/)\nthe latter suspected of having replaced TrickBot for a time given\nthe shift in payloads being deployed onto victim systems to steal\nbanking information to the appeal of criminals conducting fraud.\n\nConsidered to be the successor to the infamous Dyre banking\ntrojan, TrickBot banking trojan leverages multiple attack vectors,\n[including redirection attacks and web injects, to attempt to steal](https://www.recordedfuture.com/banking-web-injects/)\ninformation from financial institutions and initiate fraudulent wire\ntransfers. The primary methods used by threat actors to distribute\nbanking web injects continue to be phishing and exploit kits, with\ninjects often flourishing within cybercriminal communities that\noffer customized options catered to threat actors attempting to\ntarget a specific company. Additionally, administrative panels\nassociated with web injects sold within underground sources\nhave historically been observed promoting features such as the\ninclusion of plugins to connect with botnet infrastructure.\n\nThreat actors continue to generate profit from the\ndevelopment or sale of malware strains that incorporate keylogger\nfunctionality to steal information of interest, particularly on lowtier forums that likely attract a broader audience. TrickBot has\npreviously been co-opted to distribute ransomware and other\nbanking trojans, using the botnet formed by a large number of\ninfections.

TrickBot’s operators have](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/attacks-aimed-at-disrupting-the-trickbot-botnet/)\nsplit their infrastructure into 2 distinct branches. Each branch\nwas built by distinct server types in early 2021, before using\nidentical but distinct C2 nodes beginning in March 2021. Our\nvisibility indicates the original branch continues to service\nTrickBot clients, while the secondary branch has been only used\nfor in-house TrickBot operations. The shift is likely a resiliency\neffort; TrickBot’s operators can continue spamming operations\nvia a secondary botnet branch, even if the more used one gets\ntaken down or blocked based on the volume of infections.\n\nTrickBot is a sophisticated malware variant, offering\noperators various evasion techniques, as well as different\nmethods of spreading, and a large number of capabilities to\ngenerate revenue for criminal users. One of the primary functions\nof TrickBot (similar to other banking trojans) is to lift credentials\nand other sensitive login-related data appealing to financially\nmotivated threat actors using methods such as web injects and a\nkeylogging function. As database breaches and login credentials\nwith passwords have become widely marketed by threat actors,\nkeylogging as a standalone attack vector to harvest credentials\nthrough the deployment of botnets has become less relevant.\nInformation of interest to threat actors includes usernames,\npasswords, personal identification numbers, and possibly\nanswers to security questions. The role of the malware acting\nas a loader to download additional payloads of malware cannot\nbe overstated.\n\nWhile TrickBot has made efforts to harden its infrastructure,\nit has decreased the volume of spam campaigns. TrickBot has\nused both BazarCall and Campo distributions as mentioned\nabove, but also relies heavily on its own [spam](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/12/trickbot-spam-millions-emails/) [campaigns to](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/trickbot-campaigns-targeting-users-via-department-of-labor-fmla-spam/)\ngenerate infections.

The most [prolific of these is TR, which, unlike](https://www.binarydefense.com/icedid-gziploader-analysis/)\nothers, does not get appended with incrementing numbers\nfor each new campaign. TR-based spam uses hijacked email\n[threads from prior victims, and is identified with the beaconing](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/browse/tag/TR/)\nURI structure, which is typically “/ds/<DDMM>.gif”. TR is used to\n[conduct phishing campaigns for other malware families including](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2021/02/22/index.html)\n[IcedID and has been used to drop Cobalt Strike in DoppelPaymer-](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2021/02/12/index.html)\nlinked intrusions.\n\nThe TR distributor has been linked to the use of the\nEtterSilent (aka SilentBuilder) malicious document builder, which\n[is also used by other criminal syndicates, to build malicious Excel](https://app.any.run/tasks/31db7cea-fcf7-4bef-ba11-d3ba13fed1e6)\n4.0 macro spreadsheets for distribution.\n\nSQUIRRELWAFFLE is a lightweight loader first deployed at\nscale by the TR distributor in September 2021.

Dridex is typically\ndistributed via phishing campaigns as a malicious attachment or\nlink. The malicious attachment often contains macros that once\nopened reach out to a C2 server to download the actual Dridex\nmalware. In some instances, Dridex is embedded in the attached\nfile and will be extracted when opened by the user.\n\n[Dridex had 4 active affiliates, at the time of analysis, all of](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2020-CTI-008.pdf)\nwhich use a different [configuration file embedded in Dridex’s](https://countuponsecurity.com/tag/dridex-malware-analysis/)\nmain payload. The affiliate IDs are regularly rotated or aged\noff, making it difficult to track customers or methods used for\ndistribution over time.\n\n\n###### IcedID\n\nIcedID, also known as BokBot, is a banking trojan that has\n[been active since 2017.

IcedID is also less mature in its infrastructure\noperational security, continuing to use the same pool of servers\nfor its operations. Although this is effective in generating\ninfections, it does not display the same maturity as the other\nfamilies mentioned.\n\n##### Financially Motivated Cybercrime\n\nCybercriminals have continued to demonstrate flexibility\nand ingenuity in using botnet operations. Recorded Future\nanalyzed threat actor dark web posts and publicly reported\nintelligence to gain insight into which nations and regions appear\nto be particularly targeted by threat actors advertising botnets\nas a service in various languages. During our investigation,\nRecorded Future found Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, English,\nand Chinese to be among some of the more popular languages\nfor conversations about botnets being sold, created, and used\nto target victims.\n\n###### Portuguese and Spanish\n\nAlthough on January 27, 2021, a global team of law\nenforcement agencies [announced the seizure and takedown](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\nof Emotet, during its life the [majority of Emotet controllers](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0314.pdf)\nresolved to IP addresses in Latin American countries. The threat\nactors behind the infamous botnet (which has evolved from its\nbeginnings as a banking trojan into a full-service threat delivery\n[service) were surging in the region, targeting an array of sectors,](https://www.computing.co.uk/news/3072536/latin-america-the-capital-of-emotet-trojan-activity)\nfrom automotive to finance and retail to technology. While there\nare other botnets leveraged in the region, Emotet was heavily\nfavored in comparison to other botnets prior to its takedown\namong Portuguese and Spanish-speaking threat actors.\n\nSince its dismantling, Recorded Future analysts have seen\ncybercriminals in Latin America take to underground forums and\nmarketplaces to advertise and sell their self-created as well as\npopularly known botnets. Below is a sample of events pertaining\nto botnets that have occurred within the past year on Spanish\nand Portuguese-speaking threat actors across the criminal\n\nd d\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Spanish-speaking threat actor “leet331” shared a post in which they\n Cebolla sought botnet partners to collaborate and Chan\n administer a homemade botnet which Forums includes modules such as keylogging,\n screenshot module, and cookie stealer module.\n\n_Table 1: Breakdown of Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking threat actors (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n###### Chinese\n\n APT use of botnets\n\nOn July 21, 2021, the Record [reported that China’s APT31](https://therecord.media/chinese-hacking-group-apt31-uses-mesh-of-home-routers-to-disguise-attacks/)\nhas been hijacking home routers to form a proxy botnet around\nits server infrastructure to relay and disguise its origins. A\nsecurity alert published by the French National Cybersecurity\nAgency, also known as ANSSI (Agence Nationale de la Sécurité\ndes Systèmes d’Information), listed 161 IP addresses hijacked\nby APT31 in recent attacks against French organizations. French\nofficials said that APT31’s proxy botnet was used to perform\nboth reconnaissance operations against their targets, but also\nto carry out the attacks themselves.\n\n\n###### Cybercriminal use of botnets\n\nOn September 1, 2021, the Record [reported that Chinese](https://therecord.media/mozi-botnet-authors-arrested-in-china/)\nauthorities had arrested the authors of the Mozi Internet\nof Things (IoT) botnet. At its peak, the Mozi botnet infected\n160,000 systems/day in September 2020 and had historically\ninfected more than 1.5 million different devices, with more than\nhalf of them located inside China. The botnet also used the DHT\nprotocol to create a P2P system between all the infected devices,\nallowing bots to send updates and operational instructions to\neach other directly, which also permitted Mozi to continue\nto operate even without a central C2 server. For this reason,\nresearchers believe it will take months for the botnet to die\nout. In addition, prior to their arrests, new features were added\nto the Mozi module which enabled cryptocurrency mining on\ninfected systems in an attempt to monetize the botnet beyond\nDDoS attacks.\n\nScripts and tutorials for cryptocurrency mining that uses\na botnet are widely offered on Chinese-language dark web\nmarketplaces. On June 3, 2021, the threat actor “wo98998998”\nadvertised an offer for the script and tutorial for utilizing a botnet\nfor cryptocurrency mining on Dark Web Exchange. A similar offer\nwas posted by the threat actor “456811” on Tea Horse Road\nMarket on June 4, 2021.\n\nBotnet capability is often packaged with other hacking tools\nand offered for purchase across the Chinese-language dark web\necosystem. On June 11, 2021, the threat actor “409272” offered\na toolkit dubbed the “Hack Pack” on Tea Horse Road Market that\nincluded anti-antivirus, password cracker, DDoS, vulnerability\nscanner, and other functions. A similar offer was posted by the\nthreat actor “665317” on Exchange Market on June 17, 2021.\n\nIn a telegram post on August 7, 2021, the threat actor\n“aihacker” stated the sale of the botnet for DDoS started on July\n25, 2021, with UDP at 1 T, ACK at 500 G, large packet SYN at 260\nG, and small packet SYN at 140 G. Customers have the option\nto purchase daily, weekly, and monthly DDoS service packages.\n\nIn addition to dark web marketplaces and Telegram,\nadvertisements of botnet/DDoS services can often be found\non Chinese-language clearnet hacking forums. Below are 2\nadvertisement banners from 16hk[.]com. The top one is for “\n云溪 (Cloud Creek) Specialized DDoS Service”, whose operator\nclaims to have been in operation for 3 years and takes orders\nfor DDoS and CC stress testing services. It also lists the QQ\nnumber of 156740798 as a contact. The bottom one is for “孙悟空\n(Sun Wukong, or Monkey King) DDoS Service”, whose operator\nprovides L4/L7 DDoS attacks.\n\n|Source|Intelligence|\n|---|---|\n|Cracked|The Portuguese-speaking threat actor “Pleek” posted an advertisement for botnet tutorials amongst other tools in September 2020 as a hacking package.|\n|Cracked|The Portuguese-speaking threat actor “skandalozem” shared in March 2020 a botnet that they claim can perform distrib­ uted-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on any server.|\n|Boveda Forum|The Spanish-speaking threat actor “there­ alghostcard” advertised their services and product for what they claim to be a 100% functional and stable botnet for android which includes 24/7 assistance, adminis­ tration, injections, SMS interceptors, and hidden SMS interceptors.|\n|Boveda Forum|The Spanish-speaking threat actor “Design3rK” requested business partner­ ships and associates to set up a botnet to generate scams in Spain.|\n|Cebolla Chan Forums|The Spanish-speaking threat actor “leet331” shared a post in which they sought botnet partners to collaborate and administer a homemade botnet which includes modules such as keylogging, screenshot module, and cookie stealer module.|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Botnet/DDoS service ad banners on the Chinese-language hacking forum 16hk[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\nIn addition, we observed possible Chinese-speaking threat\nactors offering botnets on Russian and English-language forums.\nThe threat actor “everlongddos” advertised a 700 GBPS UDP\nbotnet in both Chinese and Russian on the mid-tier Russian\nlanguage forum Best Hack Forum, with everlongddos offering\nto perform demonstrations for serious customers. There is an\ninstance of Chinese-language usage that hinted the threat actor\nmight not be a native speaker, but the posting was clearly aimed\ntoward Chinese-speaking forum users.\n\n###### English\n\nOverall, cybercriminals have continued to demonstrate the\nflexibility and dynamic aspect of a botnet operation by exploiting\nrouters and other similar devices to perform unconventional\ntasks. Vulnerable IoT devices will likely remain instrumental in\nbotnet operations, assisting with malware propagation efforts\nand attempts by threat actors to disrupt the networks for financial\nor political gain. Cybercriminal stresser/booter services are\noften sold as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), with tutorials and\nuser support​ offered. These services provide the user with the\nsoftware to direct an attack, including control of DDoS method(s).\nThese stresser services generally incorporate botnets consisting\nof compromised hosts into the attack service. These services\n[can often cost as little as $10 an hour. Additionally, IP stresser](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ddos-attacks-are-10-per-hour-on-the-dark-web/)\nservices usually hide the identity of the actual attacker using\nproxy servers and botnets for an attack, or by spoofing the traffic\nsource in a reflective attack.\n\nGeneral open-source [searches for “stresser” and “booter”](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=Y8PpX9XoF6Gx5NoPlKekkAI&q=stresser+booter&oq=stresser+booter&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCAAQyQMyAggAMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjoICAAQsQMQgwE6CAguELEDEIMBOggILhDHARCjAjoFCAAQsQM6DgguELEDEIMBEMcBEKMCOhEILhCxAxDHARCvARDJAxCTAjoFCC4QsQM6CAguEMcBEK8BOgIILjoICAAQsQMQyQM6CggAELEDEMkDEAo6BAgAEAo6CAgAEBYQChAeULUKWL1NYMlUaABwAHgAgAGBAogBohCSAQUzLjkuM5gBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiVpo2Ny_DtAhWhGFkFHZQTCSIQ4dUDCAk&uact=5)\nservices typically result in dozens of listings including some that\nadvertise DDoS services along with botnets and servers for hire.\nThe accessibility of these services (regardless of the degree\nof their sophistication) is likely to continue to be appealing\nfor fledgling cybercriminal entities attempting to learn how\nto efficiently use a botnet in support of financially motivated\ncriminal activity.\n\n\nRecorded Future analysts have continued to observe a\ngeneral shift among cybercriminal and financially motivated\nthreat actors to disrupt business operations, often incorporating\nDDoS attacks as a secondary tactic or technique to support\nother threat activities such as the deployment of ransomware\nonto targets. “UNKN” (alias “Unknown”), an operator of\nransomware, historically stated that they like the idea of the\n[SunCrypt ransomware group encrypting the files, threatening to](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/5KOmwJ3458oZ)\nexpose the data, and would also launch a massive DDoS attack\nagainst the infrastructure of a victim. In October 2020, UNKN had\nadmitted that REvil was expanding on this concept, one that was\n[incorporated by multiple ransomware groups throughout 2021 in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-now-uses-ddos-attacks-to-force-victims-to-pay/)\na trend reminiscent of the rise of extortion websites. Additions\nsuch as this continue to demonstrate ransomware operators’\nwillingness to incorporate features originally adopted by other\nransomware crews so long as they have some degree of success\nin generating additional profit.\n\nDespite takedown efforts from law enforcement entities\nworldwide, we continue to observe threat actors on underground\nforums and clearnet sources advertising a variety of DDoS\n[services or tools on a regular basis. Many IoT botnets found on](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercriminal-underground-economy-series)\nunderground forums, and typically sold as separate services,\nare either based on source code from the Mirai botnet or other\nsimilar malware. As noted by [TrendMicro, low-cost rentals](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercriminal-underground-economy-series)\nmean that this type of botnet is readily available to all levels\nof cybercriminals, even those that may not have the skills to\nbuild and run their own botnets. We also noticed that some of\nthese Mirai botnet rentals come with guarantees of protection\nagainst disruption of botnet hosting as part of the service. The\npredominant model for earning revenue with these botnets is\nstill DDoS. However, we do expect cybercriminals to innovate\nmore over time.\n\nVulnerabilities, when unpatched or ineffectively mitigated,\ncan expose IoT devices on the network to outside attacks, such\nas use in botnets, network infiltration, data exposure/exfiltration,\ndevice takeover, and potentially compromise other devices,\nincluding non-IoT devices on the network. Additionally, some\nvulnerabilities in IoT devices can remain invisible and unpatched\nfor some time due to their use in proprietary settings leaving the\n\nf\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3:​ Advertisement for “stressers along with botnets’’ available for hire (Source: freestresser[.]to)_\n\n_Figure 4: Discussions regarding IoT technology vulnerabilities within underground source reporting (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral of the top threats associated with IoT devices that\ncontinue to be referenced within underground discussions\ninclude:\n\n  - Exploitation by IoT botnet malware (and being targeted\n\nby said botnets)\n\n  - Targeting/disruption of network infrastructure associated\n\nwith legitimate businesses\n\n  - Brand damage through theft (or destruction) of\n\nemployee personal or company data targeted by botnets\ndistributing malware strains such as ransomware\n\nThe use of IoT technology on a network can greatly reduce\noperational costs, mitigate system issues, and improve acrossthe-board efficiencies. However, this innovation comes with\nunique security risks often resulting from attempts to combine\nthis technology with legacy systems already functioning within\na host environment. Among these risks to IoT systems include:\n\n  - A lack of uniform security standards in the maintenance\n\nof this technology\n\n  - Their utilization by building or facility managers rather\n\nthan security professionals\n\n  - Their diverse irregularly secured attack surface allows\n\nthreat actors potential access to company servers\nstoring personal, proprietary, or financial data.\n\nAs society continues to place a large emphasis on making\ntechnology more efficient, both from a customer standpoint and\nan operational perspective, there continue to be security risks\nas modern technology is leveraged for convenience purposes\nrather than focusing on the end-to-end security of technologies\nthey are utilizing.\n\n##### Botnets Training: Inside the Bot-Herders School\n\nIn addition to the above botnet activities, Insikt Group\nanalysts have identified dark web threat actors offering botnetrelated services, including tutorials and lessons on how to use\nbotnets in targeting victims. Since 2019, the Russian-language\nunderground forum OpenCard has been offering a training\ncourse on botnets and bot-herders. OpenCard forum operates\nas a marketplace and discussion board focused on carding,\ne-commerce fraud, and money laundering. According to the\ncourse authors, “bot-herders are operators of botnets who use\nmalware to break into computers and computer networks to form\na botnet for personal gain and malicious purposes”.\n\n\nThe price of entry into the Botnets and Bot-Herders School\nin September 2021 was $1,400. The courses are taught by 5 to\n10 instructors — cybercriminals with a reputation in financial\nfraud, and OpenCard forum administrators and moderators.\nAccording to the OpenCard forum administrators, among the\nschool instructors is a large botnet owner and a professor of a\nleading Russian university, and a chairperson of its IT faculty.\n\nThe average group of the Botnets and Bot-Herders School\nconsists of 40 to 50 individuals with different levels of cybercrime\nexperience, with most being novice fraudsters looking to build,\nmaintain, and monetize botnets.\n\n_Figure 5: Botnets and Bot-Herders School. The description reads: “Training. Bot-herding & Logs._\n_Sign Up” (Source: OpenCard Forum)_\n\nThe Botnets and Bot-Herders School curriculum consists of\nthe following training sessions:\n\n1. Vulnerabilities of corporate networks\n\n2. Examples of attacks on corporate IT infrastructure\n\n3. Malware types and distribution methods\n\n4. Installs: buying and making your own malware\n\n5. Botnets: general concepts, classification,\nand monetization\n\n6. Preparing, testing, and launching a botnet\n\n7. Practical use cases with examples of successful\nbotnet operations\n\n8. Botnet security: avoiding closure and law\nenforcement attention\n\n9. Web injects and exploits\n\n10. Overview of the current botnet-related market\n\n11. Logs: buying, mining, processing, and monetization\n\nmethods\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: “CustomDrive”, a graduate of the Botnets and Bot-Herders School, brags about stolen cryptocurrency and illegally purchased items using PII and login credentials obtained from_\n_infected users’ computers (Source: WWH Club Forum)_\n\n\nOpenCard forum offers the Botnets and Bot-Herders School\ngraduates a platform to find partners, and acquire the necessary\ncomponents for launching and monetizing botnets.\n\nThe Botnets and Bot-Herders School instructors suggest\nusing botnets for:\n\n  - Stealing PII, financial, and confidential information\n\n  - Launching DDoS attacks\n\n  - Creating SOCKS v4/v5 proxy servers, for example, for\n\nmimicking real users, sending spam, and facilitating\npayment card and other fraud\n\n  - Keylogging to record PII and confidential data, such as\n\nvictims’ logins and passwords\n\n  - Brute-forcing to use multiple infected machines and their\n\ncomputational power for password cracking\n\n  - Click-bots for monetization on the advertisement, such\n\nas auto-clicks on supplied URL links\n\n\n\n  - Adware for showing a contextual advertisement to\n\ninfected users, rerouting victims’ internet browsing\nto advertisements, and collecting marketing data on\ninfected users\n\n  - Cryptocurrency mining, which according to the training\n\ninstructors, is less profitable than other above-mentioned\nattack vectors\n\nA botnet with 5,000 to 10,000 infected computers, according\nto the training instructors, can earn its operator up to $10,000\na day. At the same time, training instructors note that running\na botnet is an expensive, risky, and not necessarily stable\nbusiness. Yet, the Botnets and Bot-Herders School is well known\nin underground communities for enabling novice cybercriminals\nto enter the fraud stage. The Botnets and Bot-Herders School\nprovides instructions on how to build and monetize a botnet\nand many graduates choose to use acquired skills for financial\nand credit card-related fraud, with some of the graduates using\nlogin and PII data they initially gain from infected computers for\ncarding and shipment fraud.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: “cinstaller” website offering a platform to earn money from installs and web traffic (Source: cinstaller[.]com)_\n\n\nUsing labor/freelance exchanges is a popular method for\nthreat actors to infect multiple computers to form a botnet. Some\nlabor/freelance exchanges allow the advertisement of software\non their websites. Threat actors use this as means to advertise\npaid testing of software that is presented as legitimate products\nwhereas it is packed with malware. Users who download and\ninstall this software, infect their computers that are turned into\nbots in a few clicks.\n\nThe malware is hidden inside the downloaded files that are\nusually not larger than 30 MB and appears as useful software,\nsuch as patches, utilities to enhance computer productivity,\nfitness applications, programs for accounting, management, IT,\nand many others. A cruel joke is for the threat actors to advertise\nmalware-infused software as “cleaners, optimizers, or repair\nprograms”. Bots or infected machines are sometimes referred to\nas “installs” across the criminal underground. The most soughtafter installs are from the US and the price varies between $500\nto $800 per 1,000 installs. When infecting targeted computers,\nthreat actors use loaders and crypters to elude anti-virus\ndetections. The method of using labor exchanges in this fashion\nis very common but not considered among threat actors as the\n\n\nbest for adding quality bots to a botnet. Threat actors pay as\nlittle as $1 per 1 installed piece of allegedly useful program that\nvictims believe they test by downloading and installing while\ngetting paid for a seemingly easy task. Some of the websites\nused for this method recommended by the Botnets and BotHerders School instructors are installunion[.]com, cinstaller[.]\ncom, and installppi[.]com.\n\nLotteries and prizes are other popular methods threat\nactors use to infect multiple computers to form a botnet. For\nthis method to work, threat actors can create a business page\non a social network, such as Facebook, draw users to join the\npage, and make a post offering a lottery or a prize to those\nmembers who download and install software for testing and/\nor review purposes. This method requires many steps on the\nthreat actor’s part but is considered better for getting higher\nquality bots.\n\nAnother method widely employed by threat actors is to\nupload a malicious file, for example, listed as a new and popular\ncomputer game, onto a torrent-sharing service. According to\nthreat actors, this method requires a significant amount of time\n\n\n-----\n\nand maintenance to be successful but often brings high-quality\nbots, rich with PII and financial data ready to be pilfered. There\nare many other more and less targeted methods used by the\nthreat actors to infect computers to form a botnet.\n\nBy the end of the Botnets and Bot-Herders School training,\nthe new cohort of threat actors know how to find and distribute\nmalware, infect computers, and form and monetize a botnet.\nSome of the trainees form smaller groups to join forces and\nshare experiences of what works and does not work for them\nin bot-herding. Although the contents of the Botnets and BotHerders School may not always offer the latest tactics, since\ntraining instructors are likely to exploit novel methods before\nsharing them with the larger criminal underground audience,\nthe materials and curriculum of Botnet and Bot-Herders School\nprovide an insight into possible vulnerabilities as well as schemes\nand techniques used by threat actors.\n\n##### Mitigations\n\nThere are several measures that organizations can implement\nto significantly reduce the risk of their Internet-enabled\nembedded devices from becoming targeted by roaming botnets.\nThese security measures include:\n\n  - Ensuring that device firmware remains current and up to\n\ndate at all times\n\n  - Integrating a virtual private network service\n\n  - Ensuring that the default manufacturer passwords are\n\nimmediately changed upon acquiring a new device and\nthat any existing devices within your enterprise that\ncontain default credentials are immediately adjusted\n\n  - Ensuring that all ports unnecessary to the function of the\n\ndevice in question are closed\n\nWe proactively detect new botnet C2 servers to help\nclients prevent infections in their enterprises. We recommend\nautomatically ingesting these servers for detection in firewall\nand IDS appliances and running them over SIEM logs to correlate\ninfections. This includes proactive detections for all of the botnet\nfamilies mentioned in this reporting.\n\n\nWe offer over 350 hunting packages that security teams can\nuse to detect malicious activity based on malware signatures\nwithin their network. Due to the consistent shifting of packers\nused by the malware, we recommend using our SIGMA rules,\nwhich are available to clients, to detect the malware’s behavior\nin place of static detection.\n\nFurther, we recommend the following mitigation strategies:\n\n  - Use the Recorded Future Platform to help identify\n\nactively exploited vulnerabilities and CVEs that\nhave been positively associated with ransomware\nvariants, which can help with patch management and\nprioritization.\n\n  - Keep systems and software up to date and have a\n\nreliable and tested backup method.\n\n  - Exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers are\n\nabused by threat actors to gain initial access into a\ntarget’s network. If remote access solutions are crucial\nto daily operations, all remote access services (such as\nCitrix and RDP) should be implemented with two-factor\nor multi-factor authentication.\n\n  - Protect sensitive files using strong, complex passwords.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Outlook\n\nThe takedown attempt against TrickBot in the fall of 2020,\nand the successful takedown of Emotet in January 2021, have\nconvinced botnet operators of the need to diversify. We expect\nbotnet operators to continue to separate their operational\ninfrastructure among affiliates to maintain their revenue streams.\nThey will very likely continue to update their payloads with new\npackers, obfuscation techniques, and delivery tools, as they\nhave always done, but they will likely apply those stealthy habits\nto their infrastructure as well. Continually evolving botnets will\nrepresent an ongoing threat to multiple industries due to their\ngrowing capability to not only disrupt, but to permanently render\ndevices and services inoperable. Recorded Future has continued\nto see a growing level of technical sophistication among multiple\nthreat groups, with entities backed by foreign governments\ndemonstrating through their actions an interest in leveraging\nbotnets to target critical infrastructure in both public and private\nsectors as well as SCADA/ICS devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future is the world’s largest provider of intelligence for enterprise\n\nsecurity.
