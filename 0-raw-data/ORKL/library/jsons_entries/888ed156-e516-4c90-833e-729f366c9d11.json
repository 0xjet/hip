Per our in-house naming convention for threat actors, the use of the colour 'White' indicates that we have not yet\nformally attributed White Tur as being based in a specific geographic location.\n\nOur journey began when hunting for newly registered domains with TLS certificates that use the term ‘qov’, spoofing the\nlegitimate term ‘gov’. Spoofing the word ‘gov’ has previously been a favoured technique of several unrelated threat actors,\nsuch as Blue Athena (a.k.a. Sofacy, APT28) .1 On 31st January 2021, we observed the subdomain mail[.]mod[.]qov[.]rs being\nused to phish for Serbian Ministry of Defence credentials. The phishing page shown in Figure 1 when visited not only logged\ncredentials, but logged visits to the phishing page itself.\n\nFigure 1 - Serbian Ministry of Defence phishing page mail[.]mod[.]qov[.]rs\n\nWhen tracking domain registrations and domain resolutions to White Tur attributed infrastructure, we observed it to be a\npersistent threat actor operating over a number of years, from at least 2017 through to 2021, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2 - Timeline of domain registration and domain resolution activity by White Tur\n\nThe techniques used by White Tur included:\n\nWeaponised documents - Ranging from documents containing macros to exploits such as CVE-2017-0199;\nHTA scripts - Scripts that lead to the execution of PowerShell were often observed being used as an alternative to\nweaponised documents as an initial infection vector;\nXSL Scripts - Used inside weaponised documents to execute a payload. From our observations the XSL scripts can be\nused to execute a JScript or Windows binary backdoor;\nPowerShell Scripts - Part of the infection chain to download and execute the final payload;\nJScript - One of the backdoors used by White Tur was developed in JScript (One of the interpreted languages used in\nWindows Script Host);\nWindows binaries - Another backdoor used by White Tur was packaged as a Windows binary; and,\nPhishing - Phishing activity with governmental, defence, research and development and telecommunications themes.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis blog is focused on our analysis of White Tur s use of the open source project OpenHardwareMonitor for payload\nexecution. This project monitors temperature sensors, fan speeds, voltage and load and clock speeds of a computer .2 We\nobserved an archive named OpenHardwareMonitor-revised.zip with patterns we commonly associate with White Tur.\n\n**Filename** OpenHardwareMonitor-revised.zip\n\n**SHA-256** 317f14542cba69453d1f5da8c7d5a2ecad2b502ebcbb6256cc397a9fdb18bb9c\n\n**File type** Zip archive\n\n**File size** 2,810,227 bytes\n\n**First Observed** 2021-05-26 17:50:34\n\n## Analysis\n\nAfter analysing the contents of the ZIP file, we assessed that White Tur was likely packaging the OpenHardwareMonitor\nproject and backdooring parts of it to execute its payloads. There were three files that White Tur had modified or created\ninside the archive, listed in Table 1.\n\n**Table 1 - Malicious files in the OpenHardwareMonitor archive**\n\n**Filename** **SHA-256** **Description**\n\nOpenHardwareMonitorLib.csproj 7e187735d3701b681e60605563e4bb9c0febab5f4af2cbf40ba92722bf3e8f9e Modified\nVisual\nStudio\nproject\nthrough the\npre-build\nevent\n\ncommand.dat 3e59b5a07becf6956ee9271d57135d4d6524bfc3f4e9bd7866c16810f4ff3020 Windows\nbinary\nmalware\n\nCWRITE.ps1 3f99e107781c531db626e94a457bb630df4f4f37893ec2dfb2789a0b3115064b PowerShell\ndownloader\n\n### OpenHardwareMonitorLib.csproj\n\nIn the file OpenHardwareMonitorLib.csproj, White Tur modified the file to inject PowerShell code into the pre-build event,\navailable in Visual Studio projects. This technique for gaining execution was discussed by Microsoft in January 2021, when\nthey observed the North Korea-based threat actor ZINC (which we track as Black Artemis) using this method .3 The\nPowerShell code retrieves environmental information from the victim using PowerShell WMI objects and utilises the\nBitsTransfer Module available in PowerShell to download a payload shown in Figure 3. The payload is downloaded and\ncopied to \\APPDATA\\Local\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\\WOFUTIL.dll - this filename has been observed in previous White Tur activity.4\n\n\nFigure 3 - PowerShell code contained in the PreBuildEvent tag\n\nThe PowerShell script will generate a unique ID for the infected machine and name it a ‘UUID’. This unique identifier is sent to\nthe C2 when the payload is downloaded through the URL:\n\nhxxp[:]//onedrive-login[.]us/download.php?uuid=<unique_ID>\n\n### CWRITE ps1\n\n\n-----\n\nCWRITE.ps1 is a PowerShell downloader script; however, unlike the prebuild event, it uses a different technique for C2\ncommunication and logs environmental information to a separate IP. The PowerShell script sends environmental information\nto the following URL via BitsTransfer:\n\nhxxp[:]//193.37.213[.]135/BitsData/\n\nThe PowerShell script will then download the payload to the same folder via the same URL as the previous script:\n\nhxxp[:]//onedrive-login[.]us/download.php?uuid=<unique_ID>\n\nHowever, its method for communication has been modified; in this sample, the PowerShell script initiates a COM object,\nspecifically XML HTTP 3.0 .5 The script uses the .Open() method to send a HTTP request shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4 - Payload being downloaded using XML HTTP 3.0 COM object in PowerShell\n\n### Command.dat\n\nThe binary command.dat is a DLL that contains exports previously observed in White Tur payloads. These exports are:\n\nGetAdaptersAddresses;\nGetAdaptersInfo;\nGetLoaderInterface; and,\nGetTeamViewerInterface.\n\n\nThe payload correctly functions by executing the default DLL entry point, DllEntrypoint. PwC assesses White Tur likely uses\nthe name WOFUTIL.dll for payloads in a DLL search order hijacking attack. The Windows binary\nOneDriveStandAloneUpdater.exe is vulnerable to DLL side order hijacking and loads the DLL WOFUTIL.dll .6 The DLL also\nmakes use of the BitsTransfer COM objects, it calls CoCreateInstance with class identifiers (CLSIDs) related to the\nBitsTransfer control class shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5 - Malware utilising BitsTransfer control class COM objects\n\nLike the PowerShell scripts, the Windows binary will generate a unique identifier for the victim. This is achieved by\ndynamically loading the library RPCRT4.dll and calling UuidCreateSequential(). The malware will use the following URL with\nthe BitsTransfer COM object for C2 communication:\n\nhxxp[:]//onedrive-login[.]us/tp/reply.php\n\nFrom our observations, this is the most functional backdoor we have observed from White Tur which is capable of:\n\nFile management;\nUpload and download of files;\nExecution of commands; and,\nSet malware sleep time.\n\nHowever, White Tur has been experimenting with malware development and open-source projects. For example, we identify\nan open-source malware project name present on the command.dat PDB path. “Storm Kitty” is an open-source C# stealer\nused to capture credentials and keylogs by the victim.\n\nC:\\Users\\tensho\\Desktop\\StormKitty-master\\Cameleon\\Release\\Cameleon.pdb\n\nThis threat actor uses several techniques often observed by a wide variety of threats actors, such as DLL search order\nhijacking, phishing and use of COM objects. The unique feature this threat actor has is its victimology, targeting defence,\ngovernmental and research organisations based in Serbia and Republika Srpska. The full infection chain we observed with\nthis technique is shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6 - Part of the infection chain used by White Tur\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nWe are still in the technical phases of attribution with this threat actor; if we refer to the 4C model of attribution phases we are\ncurrently at the clustering phase. With some threat actors it is clear there are links to other APTs. However, from our\nassessment, this particular threat actor has a range of motivations with no clear links to well-known threat actors which are\nattributed to a government or organisation.\n\nThe threat actor focuses attacks on a region where there is little coverage in threat intelligence blogs, in this blog we aim to\nencourage some public dialogue about who would want to backdoor OpenHardwareMonitor and target these regions? This\nblog complements a talk presented at the SANS CTI Summit on 27th January 2021, which explores the wider context of this\ntechnical analysis.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK\n\n[Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/)\n\n[User Execution: Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/)\n\n[Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)\n\n[Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005/)\n\n[Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003/)\n\n[Bits Jobs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1197/)\n\n[Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/)\n\n[XSL Script Processing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1220/)\n\n[Template Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/)\n\n[File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082)\n\n[Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/)\n\n[Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001/)\n\n[System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n15265520a6622fc5a254854768da0545\n\nf6aea82e0be4863e5535759f9ddea659\n\n7bdb4b03eaf03db90f02c5b2e59a8282\n\n5e149c121a1015cb90132645c44bf87a\n\n9a958fd2053d610dd380f75f028da308baa39eb1\n\n672629577295fa71192a737bc196de2bfea65c9b\n\n42e32d40607e29b761b6be42ccf93ea78cd65021\n\n50203cbf82be50616d2992c2d8cad5a432a22d6a\n\n7e187735d3701b681e60605563e4bb9c0febab5f4af2cbf40ba92722bf3e8f9e\n\n3e59b5a07becf6956ee9271d57135d4d6524bfc3f4e9bd7866c16810f4ff3020\n\n3f99e107781c531db626e94a457bb630df4f4f37893ec2dfb2789a0b3115064b\n\n50483830696fd3b1be3a893e39c98fdcf615412dd7f4c02fe462304ff6d6136e\n\n\n-----\n\nonedrive login[.]us\n\nwindows[.]system-update[.]org\n\nvladars[.]co\n\nonedrive-login[.]net\n\nsystem-update[.]org\n\n94[.]156[.]189[.]122\n\n193.37.213[.]135\n\nstucked[.]bobcked23@protonmail[.]com\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[1] ‘APT28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?’, FireEye, https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeyewww/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-apt28.pdf (5th February 2010)\n\n[2] 'Open Hardware Monitor - Core temp, fan speed and voltages in a free software gadget', OpenHardwareMonitor,\nhttps://openhardwaremonitor.org/ (n.d)\n\n[3] ‘ZINC attacks against security researchers’, Microsoft, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/28/zinc-attacksagainst-security-researchers/ (28th January 2021)\n\n[4] CTO-TIB-20210903-01A - Darth Vladars under attack Part 3\n\n[5] ‘MSXML 3.0 GUIDs and ProgIDs’, Microsoft, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previousversions/windows/desktop/ms766426(v=vs.85) (27th October 2018)\n\n[6] ‘Hunting for Evidence of DLL Side-Loading With PowerShell and Sysmon’, SecurityIntelligence,\n[https://securityintelligence.com/posts/hunting-evidence-dll-side-loading-powershell-sysmon/ (18th August 2021)](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/hunting-evidence-dll-side-loading-powershell-sysmon/)\n\n[7] 'Attribution of Advanced Persistent Threats', Springer: Timo Steffens, 20th July 2020,\nhttps://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-61313-9\n\n## {{filterContent.facetedTitle}}\n\n{{contentList.loadingText}}\n\n{{item.videoDuration}}\n\n**{{item.title}}**\n\n{{item.thumbnailText}}\n\n{{item.videoDuration}}\n\n{{item.publishDate}}\n\n**{{item.title}}**\n\n{{item.thumbnailText}}\n\n{{contentList.loadingText}}\n\n{{contentList.loadMoreLabel}} {{contentList.viewAllLabel}}\n\n\n-----\n\n## Contact us\n\n[Jack Simpson](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/contacts/j/jack-simpson.html)\n\nCyber Threat Intelligence Manager, PwC United Kingdom\n\nTel: +44 7730 598416\n\nEmail\n\nLouise Taggart\n\nCyber Threat Intelligence Senior Manager, PwC United Kingdom\n\nTel: +44 (0)77 0269 9119\n\nEmail\n\n\n-----",
