Security consulting offered by Suncrypt\n\n1. Defend your credentials from mimikatz\n\nLimit administrator privileges to the smallest group possible\nEven if you have thousands of user accounts, you should probably only have 2–5 administrator accounts\nStart with two accounts and force users to justify any additional accounts added to the administrator group\nupgrade the schema and functional level of your forest and domain to at least 2012 R2\n\n**This domain functional level adds a fairly new group called “Protected Users”. Along with other protections, the members\nof the Protected Users group cannot authenticate by using NTLM, Digest Authentication, or CredSSP. These changes\nprovide powerful protections that make Mimikatz almost worthless.\n\n2. Verify KB2871997 has been installed to apply additional required security.\n\nAfter you install this security update, the default setting for non-protected users on Windows 7 and Windows 8 is to not\nforce clear leaked logon session credentials\nTo override this default you can add the following registry dword,, and set it to a recommended value of 30 seconds\n\n**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\TokenLeakDetectDelaySecs\n\nStop storing passwords in memory by changing the “UseLogonCredential” registry setting to ‘0’ instead of the default\nvalue of “1” and passwords are no longer available to Mimikatz\n\n**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest\n\n\n-----\n\nUseLogonCredential 0 : not store credentials in memory\n\nUseLogonCredential 1 : store credentials in memory\n\n3. Start monitoring your systems for unauthorized software and malware, which should help identify Mimikatz installation\nand activity\n\n4. In your specific case the critical vulnerabiliry contained Forti VPN, please update FortiVpn and monitor for updates and\nWindows updates\n\n5. Inform your IT stuff to remove the posibility of storing user passwords within the network\n\n6. Also we recommend you to use SentinelAV and dattoo backup system. Also Veeam Tapes is good,but pc with veeam\nshould be in WORKGROUP and user should be different from main domain\n\n7. Every PC should have AV. Don’t let any pc without AV\n\n8. Also try configure 2FA (at all network pc) when you connect to remote desktop\n\n9. Use password on AV\n\n10. Also tip for you: If you want chage Fortigate VPN to other . We dont reccomend you to use Sonic VPN,Pulse Secure,\nbecause its under massive hack\n\n## A-3.
