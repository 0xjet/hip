Our data suggests that\nactors have deployed the RGDoor backdoor on webservers belonging to eight Middle Eastern government organizations, as\nwell as one financial and one educational institution.\n\nWe believe the actors deploy RGDoor as a secondary backdoor to regain access to a compromised webserver in the event\na victim organization detects and removes the TwoFace shell. We do not have HTTP logs that show the actor interacting\nwith RGDoor, so we do not know the activities the actors carry out using the backdoor. However, we were able to create a\nclient application to interact with RGDoor for testing purposes, which allowed us to interact with the backdoor to see how it\noperates on an IIS server.\n\n### RGDoor\n\nUnlike TwoFace, the actors did not develop RGDoor in C# to be interacted with at specific URLs hosted by the targeted IIS\nweb server. Instead, the developer created RGDoor using C++, which results in a compiled dynamic link library (DLL). The\nDLL has an exported function named “RegisterModule”, which is important as it led us to believe that this DLL was used as\na custom native-code HTTP module that the threat actor would load into IIS. Starting with IIS 7\n(https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb757040.aspx), developers could create modules in C++ that the IIS webserver\nwould load to extend IIS’ capabilities, such as carry out custom actions on requests. The fact that RGDoor is an IIS HTTP\nmodule suggests that there is no visual representation of the shell for actors to interact with, which also differs from\nTwoFace’s interface that actors can interact with by visiting the URL to the TwoFace ASPX file.\n\n[According to Microsoft’s documentation (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771133(v=ws.10).aspx), native-code](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771133(v=ws.10).aspx)\nmodules can be installed either in the IIS Manager GUI or via the command-line using the “appcmd” application. While we\ndo not have logs to determine exactly how the actors install RGDoor, the actor can use the TwoFace webshell to install the\nRGDoor module via the command line. The following command could be used to install the HTTP module on an IIS server:\n\n%systemroot%\\system32\\inetsrv\\APPCMD.EXE install module /name:[module name] /image:[path to\nRGDoor DLL] /add:true\n\nWe confirmed the command above successfully installed the RGDoor backdoor in our test environment. Figure 1 shows the\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Command-line used to install RGDoor module into IIS_\n\nWe confirmed RGDoor installed correctly into IIS by checking the HTTP Modules display in IIS Manager. Figure 2 shows the\nRGDoor DLL (HTTPParser.dll) was loaded into IIS using the module name HTTPParser.\n\n_Figure 2 Installed RGDoor module displayed in the HTTP Modules list in IIS Manger_\n\n### Listening for Commands\n\nWe analyzed RGDoor samples and found that the “RegisterModule” function does very little other than calling the\nIHttpModuleRegistrationInfo::SetRequestNotifications method. According to MSDN (https://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/library/ms693045(v=vs.90).aspx), the SetRequestNotifications function has the following prototype, which allows a\ndeveloper to configure the module to handle GET requests (dwRequestNotifications) and/or POST requests\n(dwPostRequestNotifications):\n\nSetRequestNotifications(\n\nIN IHttpModuleFactory * pModuleFactory,\n\nIN DWORD        dwRequestNotifications,\n\nIN DWORD        dwPostRequestNotifications\n\n)\n\nIn RGDoor, the code calls this function with arguments that ignore inbound HTTP GET requests, but act on all HTTP POST\nrequests seen by the IIS server, even POST requests issued over HTTPS. RGDoor calls this function with the following\narguments, the third of which (dwPostRequestNotifications) is set to “RQ_BEGIN_REQUEST”, which is an event triggered\nimmediately after IIS receives the POST request:\n\nSetRequestNotifications(pModuleFactory,0,RQ_BEGIN_REQUEST)\n\nRGDoor is notified immediately when the IIS server receives an inbound HTTP POST request. RGDoor parses these POST\nrequests, specifically looking for the HTTP “Cookie” field by accessing the HTTP header with the following function call:\n\npHttpContext­>GetRequest()­>GetHeader(“Cookie”,NULL)\n\nAfter accessing the cookie field, RGDoor parses this field by looking for the string “RGSESSIONID=”, which is the basis for\nthe name RGDoor. If present, the code uses the two-bytes immediately following the “RGSESSIONID=” string as a\ndecryption key, specifically treating the two character bytes as a single hexadecimal byte. For instance, the two-byte key of\n“00” would represent the hexadecimal value of 0x00, where “FF” would represent 0xff, and so on. The key is followed by a\nBase64 encoded string that contains ciphertext. The following represents the structure of the cookie filed in inbound\nRGDoor requests:\n\nRGSESSIONID=[two­bytes for key][Base64 encoded ciphertext]\n\nRGDoor decodes the Base64 encoded string and then decrypts the decoded string using a custom algorithm. The custom\nalgorithm iterates through the ciphertext using the ‘pxor’ instruction to XOR each byte of ciphertext with the single-byte\nhexadecimal value from the two-byte character key provided in the cookie field.\n\nThe code will parse the cleartext looking for one of three commands: “cmd$”, “upload$” and “download$”. The code treats\nthe string immediately following the command as the command’s argument. Table 1 provides the arguments and further\ndetails on the three commands.\n\n|Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nexecute] command. It enters a loop that calls\n“fgets” to get the command results. The\nloop finishes when a call to “feof”\ndesignates the end of the command\nresults, which are relayed back to the actor\nvia the HTTP response.\n\nupload$[path to file] Gets the length of uploaded data by\n\nchecking the “Content-Length” field within\nthe HTTP request. Uses the\nIHttpRequest::GetRemainingEntityBytes\nand IHttpRequest::ReadEntityBody\nmethods to obtain base64 encoded data\nwithin the body of the HTTP POST request.\nThe code decrypts the decoded data using\nthe XOR algorithm and writes the data to\nthe specified file. It will respond to this\nrequest with either “write done ⧵r⧵n” or\n“can’t open file: “.\n\ndownload$[path to Reads a specified file and encrypts it with\nfile] the XOR algorithm, Base64 encodes the\n\nciphertext and sends the data back to the\nactor via the HTTP response.\n\n_Table 1 Commands available within RGDoor_\n\n### Responding to Commands\n\nWhen responding to inbound requests, the code will clear the response that IIS would have responded to the HTTP POST\nrequest by calling the following functions:\n\npHttpContext­>GetResponse()­>Clear()\n\nRGDoor then constructs its own HTTP response by first setting the “Content-Type” field within the HTTP header to\n“text/plain”. Figure 3 shows the code that uses the IHttpResponse::SetHeader method to set the “Content-Type” field within\nthe HTTP response to “text/plain”, specifically by using a value of 0xC (0xA + 2) for the ulHeaderIndex within\nHTTP_HEADER_ID enumeration.\n\n_Figure 3 RGDoor code to set the HTTP Content-Type to “text/plain”_\n\nThe sample then transmits the data back to the actor by creating a loop that calls the IHttpResponse::WriteEntityChunk\nmethod until all of the data is sent to the actor within HTTP responses. If the WriteEntityChunk method fails at any point\nduring this loop, the code will respond to the actor with a HTTP 500 “Server Error” response by using the\nIHttpResponse::SetStatus method.\n\n### Interacting with RGDoor\n\nWe created a client application to interact with the RGDoor module, specifically to issue commands to the backdoor and to\nsee how it operates on the IIS server. As mentioned previously in this blog, RGDoor has three available commands,\nspecifically “cmd$”, “upload$” and “download$”. We used our client to issue one of each of these commands.\n\nFigure 4 shows the HTTP request and response to our first interaction with the RGDoor module. The command issued in\nthis request was “cmd$whoami”, which instructs RGDoor to run the ‘whoami’ command in command prompt. The key used\nto encrypt this command was “54” (0x54), which resulted in Base64 encoded string of “NzkwcCM8OzU5PQ==”. The HTTP\nresponse shows the RGDoor module returned the Base64 encoded string of\n“PT0ndDUkJCQ7OzgIMDEyNSE4IDUkJCQ7OzheVA==”, which when decrypted using the same “54” key is the result of the\n\n|Col1|“fgets” to get the command results. The loop finishes when a call to “feof” designates the end of the command results, which are relayed back to the actor via the HTTP response.|\n|---|---|\n|upload$[path to file]|Gets the length of uploaded data by checking the “Content-Length” field within the HTTP request. Uses the IHttpRequest::GetRemainingEntityBytes and IHttpRequest::ReadEntityBody methods to obtain base64 encoded data within the body of the HTTP POST request. The code decrypts the decoded data using the XOR algorithm and writes the data to the specified file. It will respond to this request with either “write done ⧵r⧵n” or “can’t open file: “.|\n|download$[path to file]|Reads a specified file and encrypts it with the XOR algorithm, Base64 encodes the ciphertext and sends the data back to the actor via the HTTP response.|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Issuing ‘whoami’ command and RGDoor’s response_\n\nFigure 5 shows our testing of RGDoor’s upload command, specifically “upload$c:⧵windows⧵temp⧵test.txt” that uploads a file\nfrom our local system to the webserver. The inbound request uses a key of “54” (0x54) that results in an encoded command\nstring of “ISQ4OzUwcDduCCM9OjA7IycIIDE5JAggMScgeiAsIA=”. The request also includes the string\n“IDEnID06M2VmZ14=” within the POST data, which is the string “testing123⧵n” from the file on our local system encrypted\nusing the “54” key that will be written to the “test.txt” file on the server. As you can see from the HTTP response, RGDoor\nresponded to this command with “write done”, which is interesting as the response was in cleartext and not encrypted using\nthe custom algorithm.\n\n_Figure 5 Uploading a file to server via RGDoor Downloading a file from the server via RGDoor_\n\nFigure 6 shows our testing of the download command within RGDoor, specifically a command\n“download$c:⧵windows⧵temp⧵test.txt” that downloads the file uploaded in our previous test. We chose to use the key “89”\n(0x89) in this test to showcase RGDoor’s ability to use any hexadecimal byte as a key, which resulted in an encoded\ncommand string of “7eb+5+Xm6O2t6rPV/uDn7eb++tX97OT51f3s+v2n/fH9”. RGDoor responds to this command with the\nencoded string “/ez6/eDn7ri7uoM=”, which when decrypted with the “89” key results in the string ‘testing123⧵n’, which is\nthe contents of the “test.txt” file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Downloading a file from the server via RGDoor_\n\nTo determine how the RGDoor client requests appears within the IIS request logs, we checked the logs of our default IIS\ninstallation in our test environment. By default, IIS does not log the values within Cookie fields of inbound HTTP requests,\nwhich would contain commands issued by actors to RGDoor. To see inbound RGDoor requests, an administrator must\nconfigure logging of Cookie fields in IIS, which can be selected in the W3C Logging Fields dialog in IIS Manager, as seen in\nFigure 7.\n\n_Figure 7 W3C Logging Fields dialog in IIS Manager with Cookie fields enabled_\n\n\n-----\n\ngg, y q\nRGDoor is an IIS module that checks all inbound POST requests for commands, so an actor does not need to use one\nparticular URL to interact with RGDoor. However, the following shows the IIS log generated from the first testing request we\nmade using our RGDoor client, which shows the “RGSESSIONID=” string, the “54” key and the Base64 encoded command\nwithin the Cookie field:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n\n#Software: Microsoft Internet Information Services 7.5\n#Version: 1.0\n#Date: 2017-10-03 19:30:13\n#Fields: date time s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) cs(Cookie) sc-status\nsc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken\n2017-10-03 19:30:13 192.168.45.5 POST / - 80 - 192.168.45.1 python-requests/2.13.0 RGSESSIONID=54NzkwcCM8OzU5PQ== 200 0\n0 28\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRGDoor is an IIS backdoor that actors used the TwoFace webshell to load onto an IIS web server. The RGDoor provides\nbackdoor access to the compromised server, which we speculate the actors loaded in order to regain access to the server\nin the event the TwoFace webshell was removed. This backdoor has a rather limited set of commands, however, the three\ncommands provide plenty of functionality for a competent backdoor, as they allow an actor to upload and download files to\nthe sever, as well as run commands via command prompt. The use of RGDoor suggests that this group has contingency\nplans to regain access to a compromised network in the event their webshells are discovered and remediated.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from RGDoor by the following:\n\nAll RGDoor samples have malicious verdicts in WildFire\nAutoFocus customers can investigate this activity with the RGDoor\n(https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.RGDoor) tag\nIPS Signature RGDoor.Gen Command and Control Traffic (ID 11885) detects RGDoor network traffic\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n**RGDoor SHA256**\n\n497e6965120a7ca6644da9b8291c65901e78d302139d221fcf0a3ec6c5cf9de3\n\na9c92b29ee05c1522715c7a2f9c543740b60e36373cb47b5620b1f3d8ad96bfa\n\n**RGDoor Filenames**\n\nHTTPParser.dll\n\nTrafficHandler.dll\n\niishandler6.dll\n\n##### Got something to say?\n\nLeave a comment...\n\n**Notify me of followup comments via e-mail**\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\n-----\n\nWebsite\n\n\nSUBMIT\n\n**SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTERS**\n\nEmail\n\n**COMPANY**\n\n[Company (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)\n\n[Careers (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/careers)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/careers)\n\n[Sitemap (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)\n\n[Report a Vulnerability (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/security-disclosure)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/security-disclosure)\n\n**LEGAL NOTICES**\n\n[Privacy Policy (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy)\n\n[Terms of Use (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n**ACCOUNT**\n\n[Manage Subscription (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/subscriptions)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/subscriptions)\n\n##  (https://www.linkedin.com/company/palo-alto-networks)   (https://www.facebook.com/PaloAltoNetworks/)   (https://twitter.com/PaloAltoNtwks)\n\n(https://ignite.paloaltonetworks.com/usa/?\n\nCampaignId=7010g000001IH8U&utm_content=Ignite18USA&utm_medium=390x90banner&utm_source=website)\n\n© 2016 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
