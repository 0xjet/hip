Wednesday, April 27, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit_\n_Research Team_\n\n\n-----\n\nGovernment-sponsored threat actors collect intelligence to benefit their country, and changes\nto the political landscape can impact the collection requirements. The war in Ukraine has\nprompted many countries to deploy their cyber capabilities to gain insight about global\nevents, political machinations, and motivations. This desire for situational awareness often\n[extends to collecting intelligence from allies and “friends,” which could explain why](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-says-friendship-with-russia-is-rock-solid-2022-03-07/)\nSecureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers detected what appears to be an\nattempt by China to deploy advanced malware to computer systems of Russian officials.\n\nIn March 2022, CTU™ researchers analyzed a malicious executable file masquerading as a\nRussian-language document. The filename is Благовещенск - Благовещенский\nпограничный отряд.exe (\"Blagoveshchensk - Blagoveshchensk Border Detachment.exe\"),\nbut the default settings on Windows system do not display the .exe file extension. The file\nuses a portable document file (PDF) icon for credibility. Blagoveshchensk is a Russian city\nclose to the China border and is home to the 56th Blagoveshchenskiy Red Banner Border\nGuard Detachment. This connection suggests that the filename was chosen to target officials\nor military personnel familiar with the region.\n\nThe heavily obfuscated executable file downloads additional files from a staging server at\n107 . 178 . 71 . 211 (see Table 1).\n\nTarget file on staging server Comment\n\nhttp: //107 . 178 . 71 . 211/eu/Report.pdf Decoy document\n\nhttp: //107 . 178 . 71 . 211/eu/FontEDL.exe Legitimate signed file\n\nhttp: //107 . 178 . 71 . 211/eu/DocConvDll.dll Malicious DLL loader\n\nhttp: //107 . 178 . 71 . 211/eu/FontLog.dat Encrypted payload (likely PlugX)\n\n_Table 1. Files downloaded from staging server._\n\nThe executable file displays the decoy document (see Figure 1) to the victim. This document\nis written in English and appears to be legitimate, although CTU researchers were unable to\nlocate the original source. It describes the migratory pressure and asylum applications in\ncountries that border Belarus (Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland) and discusses European Union\n(EU) sanctions against Belarus at the beginning of March 2022. CTU researchers are\nunclear why a file with a Russian filename downloads an English-language document.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Decoy document displayed to victims. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe other three files downloaded from the staging server are typical of the China-based\n[BRONZE PRESIDENT threat group's use of](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-president) [DLL search order hijacking to execute PlugX](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/)\nmalware payloads. The inclusion of the ping command with the \"-n 70\" option (see Figure 2)\nadds a significant delay before executing the legitimate signed file. The IP address used for\nthe ping command is Google's public DNS service.\n\n_Figure 2. Using ping command to incorporate delay. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe legitimate signed file originates from UK-based Global Graphics Software Ltd. Because\nit is vulnerable to DLL search order hijack, it imports the malicious DocConvDll.dll DLL\nloader. This DLL exports eight functions, several of which use seemingly random names and\ncontain no useful instructions. The only export called by the parent executable is\ncreateSystemFontsUsingEDL (see Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Exported functions of DocConvDll.dll. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe createSystemFontsUsingEDL function loads, decrypts, and executes FontLog.dat. The\n.dat sample obtained by CTU researchers was corrupt, but based on similar campaigns the\nfile is likely a PlugX payload. However, analysis of the loader suggests that the malware\ncreates a directory structure under C:\\ProgramData (C:\\ProgramData\\Fuji Xerox\\Fonts\\) and\nthen copies the three files that DLL side-load and execute the payload to this directory. Once\nPlugX is installed, the malware provides access to the compromised host to extract sensitive\nsystem information, upload and download files, and execute a remote command shell.\n\nThe staging server (107 . 178 . 71 . 211) hosts the zyber-i . com domain. This domain has\nbeen [implicated in a broad PlugX campaign targeting European diplomatic entities. The](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european)\ndomain was hosted on 103 . 107 . 104 . 19 from March 2-13, when it served a similarly\n[named group of files for DLL search order hijack. A third-party report links the campaign to](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/23/mustang-panda-hodur-old-tricks-new-korplug-variant/)\n[the locvnpt . com domain. Another report associates the locvnpt . com domain with attacks in](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0915.pdf)\n2020 against the Vatican that CTU researchers attribute to BRONZE PRESIDENT. This 2020\ncampaign also used customized decoy documents and downloaded PlugX .dat files that\nwere loaded by DLL search order hijack. The locvnpt . com domain was hosted on 2EZ\nNetworks (IP address 167 . 88 . 177 . 151) in September 2020. BRONZE PRESIDENT\nextensively used that company's IP range in a 2020 campaign targeting Hong Kong,\nMyanmar, and Vietnam (see Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. BRONZE PRESIDENT network infrastructure used in 2020 campaign. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT appears to be changing its targeting in response to the political\n[situation in Europe and the war in Ukraine. The threat group has primarily focused on](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-president-targets-ngos)\nSoutheast Asia, gathering political and economic intelligence valuable to the People's\nRepublic of China (PRC). Targeting Russian-speaking users and European entities suggests\nthat the threat actors have received updated tasking that reflects the changing intelligence\ncollection requirements of the PRC.\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 2.
