For more than three years, we have monitored and reported PoS threats\n[targeting diverse verticals beyond retail; we have seen attacks affecting airports and parking](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/planes-trains-automobiles-are-you-safe-from-pos-malware-anywhere/)\n[lots, among others. It is a mainstream threat that has continuously evolved its tactics to expand](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/planes-trains-automobiles-are-you-safe-from-pos-malware-anywhere/)\ntheir target base.\n\nWhile PoS threats have similarities in terms of techniques, each variant has its own unique\ncharacteristic. Take the case of this newly discovered PoS malware which is notable for its\nspeed in how the information is stolen and sent back to attackers. We call this malware\nFastPOS, due to the said speed and efficiency of its credit card theft capabilities.\n\nIn this technical brief, we will cover the infection vectors of FastPOS, its information theft\nroutines, and its novel way of conducting data exfiltration.\n\n## Installation\n\nBased on the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network data, the operators behind FastPOS used\nthe following three infection vectors to install this threat:\n\n  - A compromised medical website that serves as a download location\n\n  - A web-based, real-time file sharing service used as download location\n\n  - Direct file transfer via virtual networking computer (VNC); we assume that access to this\nis either through stolen credentials or through a brute-force attack\n\nEarlier versions of FastPOS require an administrative account to run the file. A pop-up box\nappears if a non-administrative account runs the file:\n\n_Figure 1: pop-up to run the file as administrator_\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\nThis pop-up box forces the users to manually circumvent the user account control (UAC), built\non Windows Vista® and higher. After running the file with an administrative account, the copies\nof the malware are copied to the following locations:\n\n  - %Windows%\\system32\\winlogon_r.exe (Windows 32-bit)\n\n  - %Windows%\\SysWOW64\\winlogon_r.exe (Windows 64-bit)\n\nRunning the file would result to a pop-up box indicating that the installation has been completed:\n\n_Figure 2: Pop-up box of initial installation_\n\nIn the later versions of FastPOS, we observed that the cyber crooks removed the requirement to\nrun as administrator but preserved the “Installation Complete” pop-up box. This made infection\neasier as the end-user is no longer required to be logged on as administrator. Based on the\nupdated file set that we have, a copy of the malware is placed in the following locations:\n\n  - %ProgramData%\\cssrs.exe (Windows Vista® and above)\n\n  - %ALLUSERPROFILE%\\cssrs.exe (Windows XP)\n\nThe “Installation Complete” pop-up box may be seen as a simple effort to avoid automation or\nsandbox execution that could possibly thwart full infection. Real infection, however, would still\nrequire clicking on the said pop-up box in order to pass the control to the newly written file.\nAside from copying the file to the desired location, this threat has other indicators:\n\n  - Creation of the mutex, “uniqyeidclaxemain”\n\n  - Creation of an autorun entry, csrss = {malware path and filename} under\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nAfter the initial execution, file invoking, and successful installation, this threat connects to a\ncommand-and-control (C&C) server that is predefined in the file itself. The complete list of C&C\nservers can be found at the Appendix.\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\n## Information theft routines\n\nFastPOS has three separate threads, pertaining to its notable capabilities:\n\n  - Keylogger\n\n  - Main RAM scraper process\n\n(Note: The latest file set avoids several process names: Firefox.exe, Chrome.exe,\nSvchost.exe, Dwm.exe, and Skype.exe)\n\n  - Self-updating mechanism\n\nThe first two threads, the keylogger and the main RAM scraper process, are for information theft\npurposes. We will tackle the third thread in the data exfiltration phase.\n\nIn the first thread, FastPOS captures keystrokes and sends back the entire string to the C&C\nserver once the return key is pressed. Keyloggers often go together with PoS threats as the\nformer enable the attackers to do reconnaissance and obtain other information aside from the\nstolen data from the credit card scrape. Stolen information from keyloggers may also vary\nbetween the products or services purchased and the card security code (unique card code/card\nidentification number) being asked in some establishments.\n\nFastPOS implements a simple key-logging functionality similar to another PoS threat,\n[NewPosThings, in that keylogged data are held in memory with no file written in disk. As such,](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/newposthings-has-new-pos-things/)\nthis poses challenges to detection and removal of the malware from PoS systems. Although,\nsuch routine may result to some level of network noise, there are relatively few instances of the\nreturn key being used. This is also seen when you compare the normal operations of PoS\nterminal to that of a regular workstation.\n\nThe main RAM scraping process handled by the second thread and a custom algorithm is\nimplemented in the following flow:\n\n1. Check field separator ('=' or 'D')\n2. Check first digit of the primary account number (aka, primary account number or\n\nPAN) (3,4,5,6)\n3. Check expiry year (not later than 2040)\n4. Check expiry month (no value above 12)\n5. Service code should be 201 or 101 (magnetic stripe card/IC card, PIN not required)\n6. Must pass Luhn validation\n7. Data after service code should be digits from 0-9 up to 16 characters, and ends with\n\n'?'\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\nThis process also checks if the number of digits is 16 numbers. The PAN checking indicates\nthat it allows cards from major players like American Express, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, and\nVISA among others. The steps taken by this RAM scraper is quite common, except to one\nprocedure where it checks the service code. Based on our analysis of one particular sample\n(sha1: 01cdb9f7935434df31196660a7542e0b46bcf480), FastPOS looks for a specific service\ncode 201 or 101, namely:\n\n  - Position 1, value 1: International interchange OK\n\n  - Position 1, value 2: International interchange, use IC (chip) where feasible\n\n  - Position 2, value 0: Normal\n\n  - Position 3, value 1: No Restrictions\n\n_Figure 3: Service code checking_\n\nThis filtering ensures that the credit card data that it searches for are international cards\n(position 1), unrestricted for authorization (position 2), and does not require a pin (position 3). A\n[full list of possible service code combinations can be read here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card)\n\n## Data exfiltration\n\nThis RAM scraper has an unusual way of data exfiltration. It does not have any HTTP useragent. Instead of HTTP POST, the HTTP GET verb is used. This implies that a server would\nhave to do post-processing on their server-side logs. GET method is usually employed to\nrequest data from a specific HTTP resource while POST is for submitting data to the specified\nHTTP resource. Analysis of the HTTP responses indicates that a positive HTTP 200 response is\ngiven by the C&C server – meaning that the HTTP GET request is processed correctly.\nHowever, no content is provided back to the client from the server.\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. HTTP GET request to C&C server_\n\nFurthermore, because of the use of HTTP GET, the requests are cached on the infected\nendpoints and remain in web browser history. FastPOS either deletes the URL cache entry to\nhandle the cached content or when it attempts to update using the third thread for self-update.\n\nAside from implementing HTTP GET (instead of HTTP POST) on the client-side, the command\nand control server does not implement HTTPS to encrypt the traffic. This makes the requests\nand responses, including the credit card data, exposed in the network traffic. In turn, this makes\nthe network traffic easy to spot as it exposes all gathered information from the endpoint in every\nHTTP transaction. However, this threat does so in a quick and easy manner, hence the name\nFastPOS.\n\nTypically, PoS threats either log data locally or send it out to their respective C&C servers\nimmediately. In the case of FastPOS, it does not store any scraped information or status logs\nlocally but sends it to C&C server hard-coded in the malware. It does this using the following\ncommands/parameters:\n\nkey&log=TWND%sKWND%s Used to send the logged keystrokes. First\nstring is the window title; second string is the\nkey log\nadd&log=%s&foundin=%s Used by the RAM Scraper thread during data\nexfiltration. First string is the card dump;\nsecond string is the process name.\n_Table 1. Commands for sending the stolen information_\n\nIt also continuously sends status logs to the C&C server using the parameters listed below:\n\nnew&username=%s&computername=%s&os=%s&architecture=%s Registers\n\nnew infected\nsystem with\nuser name,\ncomputer\nname, OS\nand\narchitecture\nstatuslog&log=scanning-%s Indicates\nprocesses\nbeing\n\n5\n\n|key&log=TWND%sKWND%s|Used to send the logged keystrokes. First string is the window title; second string is the key log|\n|---|---|\n|add&log=%s&foundin=%s|Used by the RAM Scraper thread during data exfiltration. First string is the card dump; second string is the process name.|\n\n|new&username=%s&computername=%s&os=%s&architecture=%s|Registers new infected system with user name, computer name, OS and architecture|\n|---|---|\n|statuslog&log=scanning-%s|Indicates processes being|\n\n\n-----\n\nscanned for\ncredit card\ndata\nupdate&username=%s Sends when\na software\nupdate is\nrequested\nstatuslog&log=CheckedForUpdate Sends after\nrequest for\nsoftware\nupdate\nstatuslog=&log=GetLastError%d Reports\nencountered\nerror with an\nerror code\n_Table 2. Parameters for sending logs_\n\nFastPOS has implemented a functionality that indicates the process name where the credit card\nis found. This is usually used to pre-filter if the entry is valid or not. They can also reuse this\nlater for profiling purposes or for determining the PoS software running on the infected terminal.\n\n## Other research findings\n\nWe found interesting hints or clues regarding the perpetrators behind FastPOS and its possible\nusers. We spotted a forum site which has a code snippet with the exact mutex as FastPOS\nwhen configured to use.\n\n_Figure 5: This forum site has the same mutex name_\n\nThe error message (see figure 6) bears semblances to the pop-up box in our sample set.\n\n6\n\n|Col1|scanned for credit card data|\n|---|---|\n|update&username=%s|Sends when a software update is requested|\n|statuslog&log=CheckedForUpdate|Sends after request for software update|\n|statuslog=&log=GetLastError%d|Reports encountered error with an error code|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Pop-up box when the mutex is duplicated_\n\nWe surmise that the user who posted in the said forum, inquiring about the keylogger is actually\nthe creator of FastPOS. There’s a possibility that he is employing the platform and its user base\nto refine his code. The said code in question appears like the FastPOS keylogger thread.\n\n_Figure 7: Form post with code details_\n\nThe existing sample set of FastPOS communicating back to the C&C server.\n\n_Figure 8: Example of a C&C communication matching exactly the code snippet in Fig 7._\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\nOur research also indicated that around January 24-25 of this year, there were advertisements\nof a site called SwipeIt[.]pw in some forums with this content.\n\n_Figure 9: SwipeIt[.]pw advertisement_\n\nIronically, the IP address (5[.]100[.]156[.]107)of SwipeIt[.]pw is actually used as the C&C server\nof this threat. Perhaps, the operators behind FastPOS thought it would be simple as to make the\nforum as the C&C server where they can also sell their wares.\n\nThis forum also provides information about the dumps available for purchase. It also allows the\nusers to add balance to their accounts, view and filter existing dumps, check the existing credit\ncard bins, view the FAQ page, and access chat-based technical support page. All transactions\nare done in bitcoin only.\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Dump selection for purchase at SwipeIT[.]pw_\n\nAs of posting, there’s a total of 3,354 credit card numbers for purchase with the following prices:\n\n**Issuing bank location** **Price**\nSouth Korea US $10 - $12\nBrazil US$12\nUnited Kingdom US $10 - $12\nJapan US $40\nFrance US $25\nPhilippines US $25\nUnited States US $12\n_Table 3. Price range for credit cards up for purchasing in SwipeIT[.]pw_\n\nThe site also provides information regarding the current locations these cybercriminals are\nlooting. Our findings show that the current locations are South Korea, United Kingdom, and\nBrazil.\n\nBased on our research findings, here’s a rough timeline of the events related to this.\n\n9\n\n|Issuing bank location|Price|\n|---|---|\n|South Korea|US $10 - $12|\n|Brazil|US$12|\n|United Kingdom|US $10 - $12|\n|Japan|US $40|\n|France|US $25|\n|Philippines|US $25|\n|United States|US $12|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. Timeline of FastPOS-related events_\n\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the two domains (aquaspa-oi[.]re and sabebien[.]cl) were registered some time ago,\nthese were just recently observed with FastPOS.\n\n## Affected countries\n\nOur Smart Protection Network data shows the following countries have FastPOS-related\ninfections in the last five months.\n\n_Figure 12. Country distribution of FastPOS-related infections_\n\nTrend Micro has observed infections in small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), as well as\nenterprises. We also surmise that the locations which have FastPOS infections are sometimes\nthe remote offices with open remote VNC access.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSome of the affected entities of FastPOS are based in locations with open remote VNC access.\nIn certain instances, these organizations have DSL router as their primary separation between\nthe terminal (that processes credit card information) and the internet with just port-forward\nfunctionality enabled directly to the terminal itself. This introduces risks to the environment given\nthat there’s only a thin line separating the terminal and external access. While remote access\nallows remote administration, the same channels have always been abused. A similar\nmethodology has been seen and documented early on with point-of-sale systems infected by\n[Backoff with in this advisory from US-CERT almost 2 years ago which, as it stands to show,](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-212A)\nsimilar methodology are still being used on infections still persist today.\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, based on the design and behavior of FastPOS, it implies that the targeted\nterminals have bare internet access with installed endpoint security software as the only line of\ndefense. While complying with the bare minimum of having anti-malware software on systems, it\nis recommended to separate traffic and employ strict access controls on such terminals.\nIn cases when an endpoint security solution is used to secure systems against PoS threats, it\nalso best to track and monitor activities within the endpoint. Implementing a context-aware\nendpoint security monitor that would speed up the discovery, investigation and response to\n[security incidents may be desired such as Trend Micro Endpoint Sensor.](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/#endpoint-protection)\n\n_Figure 13. Visual representation of the infection via Trend Micro Endpoint Sensor_\n\n[Businesses should also consider another approach, such as implementing endpoint application](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/product-security/endpoint-application-control/pos-system-security/app-whitelisting/index.html)\n[control or whitelisting technology that reduces attack exposure by ensuring only updates](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/product-security/endpoint-application-control/pos-system-security/app-whitelisting/index.html)\nassociated with whitelisted applications can be installed.
