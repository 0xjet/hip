Background\ninformation on this story can be found in our recent publications:\n\nYesterday (January 19th) we discovered a new wave of these attacks, where a number of\nelectricity distribution companies in Ukraine were targeted again following the power outages\nin December. What’s particularly interesting is that the malware that was used this time is not\nBlackEnergy, which poses further questions about the perpetrators behind the ongoing\noperation. The malware is based on a freely-available open-source backdoor – something no\none would expect from an alleged state-sponsored malware operator.\n\n# Details of the cyberattacks\n\n\n-----\n\npost. The attackers sent spearphishing emails to potential victims yesterday. The email\ncontained an attachment with a malicious XLS file.\n\nSpearphishing email from January 19, 2016\n\nThe email contains HTML content with a link to a .PNG file located on a remote server so that\nthe attackers will get a notification that the email was delivered and opened by the target. We\nhave observed the same interesting technique used by the BlackEnergy group in the past.\n\nHTML content of email with PNG file on remote server\n\nJust as interestingly, the name of PNG file is the base64-encoded string “mail_victim’s_email”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe XLS file used in attacks\n\nThe malicious macro-enabled XLS file is similar to the ones we’ve seen in previous attack\nwaves. It tries, by social engineering, to trick the recipient into ignoring the built-in Microsoft\nOffice Security Warning, thereby inadvertently executing the macro. The text in the document,\ntranslated from Ukrainian reads: Attention! This document was created in a newer version of\n_Microsoft Office. Macros are needed to display the contents of the document._\n\nExecuting the macro leads to the launch of a malicious trojan-downloader that attempts to\ndownload and execute the final payload from a remote server.\n\nDisassembled code from dropped executable\n\nThe server hosting the final payload is located in Ukraine and was taken offline after a\n\ntifi ti f [CERT UA](http://cert.gov.ua/) [d C S CERT](https://www.first.org/members/teams/cys-cert)\n\n\n-----\n\n[was used this time. The attackers used modified versions of an open-source gcat backdoor](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/gcat)\nwritten in the Python programming language. The python script was converted into a stand[alone executable using PyInstaller program.](http://www.pyinstaller.org/)\n\nObfuscated code of GCat backdoor\n\nThis backdoor is able to download executables and execute shell-commands. Other GCat\nbackdoor functionality, such as making screenshots, keylogging, or uploading files, was\nremoved from the source code. The backdoor is controlled by attackers using a GMail account,\nwhich makes it difficult to detect such traffic in the network.\n\nESET security solutions detect the threat as:\n\n**VBA/TrojanDropper.Agent.EY**\n**Win32/TrojanDownloader.Agent.CBC**\n**Python/Agent.N**\n\n# Thoughts and conclusions\n\n[Ever since the first blogposts following our discovery of these cyberattacks, they have gained](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/03/blackenergy-sshbeardoor-details-2015-attacks-ukrainian-news-media-electric-industry/)\nwidespread media attention. The reasons for that are twofold:\n\nIt is probably the first case where a mass-scale electrical power outage has been caused\nby a malware cyberattack.\nMainstream media have popularly attributed the attacks to Russia, based on claims of\nseveral security companies that the organization using BlackEnergy, a.k.a. Sandworm,\na.k.a. Quedagh, is Russian state-sponsored.\n\n[The first point has been a subject of debate as to whether the malware actually caused the](https://ics.sans.org/blog/2016/01/09/confirmation-of-a-coordinated-attack-on-the-ukrainian-power-grid)\npower outage or whether it only “enabled” it. While there is a difference in the technical\naspects between the two, and while we’re naturally interested in the smallest details when\nconducting malware analysis, on a higher level, it doesn’t really matter. As a matter of fact, it is\nthe very essence of malicious backdoors – to grant attackers remote access to an infected\nsystem.\n\nThe second point is even more controversial. As we have stated before, great care should be\ntaken before accusing a specific actor, especially a nation state. We currently have no\nevidence that would indicate who is behind these cyberattacks and to attempt attribution by\n\n\n-----\n\nor it might not. In any case, it is speculation at best. The current discovery suggests that the\npossibility of false flag operations should also be considered.\n\nTo sum it up, the current discovery does not bring us any closer to uncovering the origins of\nthe attacks in Ukraine. On the contrary, it reminds us to avoid jumping to rash conclusions.\n\n_We continue to monitor the situation for future developments.
