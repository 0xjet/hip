This campaign uses social engineering and decoy documents related to geopolitical\naffairs and relations between the Palestinian government, and references Egypt, Hezbollah, and Iran.\n\nDuring the attacks, victims are infected with a previously undocumented backdoor, dubbed Pierogi by Cybereason. This backdoor allows\nattackers to spy on targeted victims. Cybereason suspects that the backdoor may have been obtained in underground communities rather than\nhome-grown, as the evidence found in the code of the backdoor suggests it may have been developed by Ukranian-speaking hackers.\n\nThe tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), content, and theme of the decoy documents, as well as the victimology observed in the\ncampaign, resemble previous attacks that have targeted Palestinians. In particular, these campaigns appear to be related to attacks carried out\nby a group called MoleRATs (aka, [Gaza Cyber Gang,](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0021/) [Moonlight), an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has been operating in the](https://www.vectra.ai/blogpost/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks)\nMiddle East since 2012.\n\n## Key Points\n\n**Cyber Espionage with a New Malware: The Cybereason Nocturnus team has discovered recent, targeted attacks in the Middle East to**\ndeliver the Pierogi backdoor for politically-driven cyber espionage.\n**Targeting Palestinians: The campaigns seems to target Palestinian individuals and entities, likely related to the Palestinian government.**\n**Using Geopolitically-charged Lure Content: The attackers use specially crafted lure content to trick their targets into opening**\nmalicious files that infect the victim’s machine with the Pierogi backdoor. The decoy content of the malicious files revolves around various\npolitical affairs in the Middle East, specifically targeting the tension between Hamas and other entities in the region.\n**Perpetrated by an Arabic-speaking APT, MoleRATs: The modus-operandi of the attackers as well as the social engineering decoy**\ncontent seem aligned with previous attacks carried out by an Arabic-speaking APT group called MoleRATs (aka Gaza Cybergang). This\ngroup has been operating in the Middle East since 2012.\n\n[For a synopsis of this research, check out the Molerats & Pierogis Threat Alert.](https://www.cybereason.com/threat-alert-molerats-pierogis)\n\n\n-----\n\n## ab e o Co te ts\n\n Infection Vector via Social Engineering\n\n[Similar to previous attacks, this campaign starts with social engineering. In one instance, it lures victims to open an email attachment. In](https://www.vectra.ai/blogpost/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks)\nothers, it persuades victims to download a report about a recent political affair pertaining to the Middle East and specifically to Palestinian\nmatters. In most cases, the downloaded file is either an executable that masquerades as a Microsoft Word document or a weaponized\nMicrosoft Word document.\n\n_Malicious file named “Reports on major developments__347678363764”, uploaded to VirusTotal from the Palestinian territories._\n\n**Backdoor Dropper File Name** **SHA-256**\n\n\n347678363764_ﺗﻘﺮﯾﺮ ﺣﻮل أﻫﻢ اﻟﻤﺴﺘﺠﺪات.exe\n\n**Translation: Report on major developments_347678363764.exe**\n\nEntelaqa_hamas_32_1412_847403867_rar.exe\n\n**Translation: Hamas_32th_Anniversary__32_1412_847403867_rar.exe**\n\n\n4e77963ba7f70d6777a77c158fab61024f384877d78282d31ba7bbac067\n\n094e318d14493a9f56d56b44b30fd396af8b296119ff5b82aca01db9af83\n\n\nfinal_meeting_9659836_299283789235_rar.exe 050a45680d5f344034be13d4fc3a7e389ceb096bd01c36c680d8e7a75d\n\nEmployee-entitlements-2020.doc b33f22b967a5be0e886d479d47d6c9d35c6639d2ba2e14ffe42e7d2e5b\n\nCongratulations_Jan-7_78348966_pdf.exe 4be7b1c2d862348ee00bcd36d7a6543f1ebb7d81f9c48f5dd05e19d6ccd\n\n## Decoy Content\n\nAs soon as the victim double-clicks on the dropper, they are presented with the decoy document. The document lowers the victim’s suspicions\nby distracting them with a real document while the dropper installs the backdoor. However, some of the documents also play an additional role\nin the attack. While some are more neutral, quoting from newspapers and the media, others seem to report fake news to spread\nmisinformation that serves a political agenda. With regards to decoy content themes, this campaign resembles previous campaigns reported in\nblogs by [Vectra,](https://www.vectra.ai/blogpost/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks) [Unit 42, and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-targeted-attacks-middle-east-using-kasperagent-micropsia/) [Talos.

It enables the attackers to spy on victims using rather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software))\nbasic backdoor capabilities. While it is unknown at this point whether the backdoor was coded by the same members of the group behind the\nattacks, there are indications that suggest that the malware was authored by Ukranian-speaking malware developers. The commands used to\ncommunicate with the C2 servers and other strings in the binary are written in Ukrainian.\n\n[This is why we chose to name the malware Pierogi, after the popular East European dish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi)\n\n_Strings embedded in the backdoor binary that show Ukranian words._\n\nThe backdoor has the following capabilities:\n\nCollects information about the infected machine.\nUploads files to the attackers’ server.\nDownloads additional payloads.\nTakes screenshots from the infected machine.\nExecutes arbitrary commands via the CMD shell.\n\nIn addition to spy features, the backdoor also implements a few checks to ensure it is running in a safe environment. Specifically, it looks for\nantivirus and other security products.\n\n1. The backdoor queries Windows for installed antivirus software using WMI: SELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct\n\n\n-----\n\nt oo s o spec c a t us a d secu ty p oducts sta ed o t e ected ac e, suc as aspe s y, eSca, secu e a d\nBitdefender.\n\n_Strings of security products found in the backdoor code._\n\n## Persistence Mechanism\n\nThe backdoor achieves persistence using a classic startup item autorun technique:\n\n1. A shortcut is added to the the startup folder: C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup.\n2. Once the user logs on to the infected machine, the shortcut points to the file binary location in the C:\\ProgramData\\ folder.\n\n_The backdoor persistence shown via Sysinternals Autoruns tool._\n\nThe GUID generated by the malware is saved in a file called GUID.bin. This file is created in the same folder as the binary of the backdoor\n(C:\\ProgramData\\GUID.bin).\n\n_Contents of the GUID.bin file generated by the backdoor._\n\n## C2 Communication by the Pierogi Backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\ne bac doo as at e bas c C u ct o a ty p e e ted t oug a p ede ed set o U s\n\n**1. Sending machine information and a heartbeat to the C2:**\nURL: hxxp://nicoledotson[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Yortysnr\n\nThe information sent to the C2 includes:\n\n**cname: computer name, username, and GUID**\n**av: Name of detected antivirus**\n**osversion: version of the operating system**\n**aname: the location of the malware on the infected machine**\n\n_Sending basic information about the infected machine_\n\n**2.

Cybereason suspects this campaign targets Palestinian individuals and\nentities in the Middle East, specifically directed at those in the Palestinian government. The threat actors behind the campaign use social\nengineering to infect their victims with the Pierogi backdoor for cyber espionage purposes.\n\nThe threat actor behind the attack invested considerable time and effort to lure their victims with specially-crafted documents that target\nPalestinian individuals and entities in the Middle East. In our analysis, we reviewed the TTPs and the decoy content, and pointed out the\nsimilarities between previous attacks that have been attributed to MoleRATs, an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has operated\nin the Middle East since 2012.\n\n\n-----\n\ne e og bac doo d sco e ed by Cybe easo du g t s est gat o see s to be u docu e ted a d g es t e t eat acto s esp o age\ncapabilities over their victims. Based on the Ukranian language embedded in the backdoor, Cybereason raises the possibility that the backdoor\nwas obtained in underground communities by the threat actors, rather than developed in-house by the group.\n\n[Learn how to protect against these types of attacks with the right roles for SIEM and EDR.
