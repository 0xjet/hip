The last instance we saw_\n_occurred in July 2020 as described in our blogpost._\n\n_On December 11th, Able Soft stated in an email to us that the trojanized installers and Able_\n_Desktop’s updates have not been used since the incident was reported to them. They also_\n_stated that, as a precaution against further attacks, Able Soft halted the Able Desktop_\n_updates, and that the last occurrence they observed of such attacks was in July 2020._\n\n_ESET has no information that allows us to corroborate or dispute these statements._\n\nESET researchers discovered that chat software called Able Desktop, part of a business\nmanagement suite popular in Mongolia and used by 430 government agencies in\nMongolia (according to [Able), was used to deliver the HyperBro backdoor (commonly used](https://web.able.mn/customers/a)\nby LuckyMouse), the Korplug RAT (also known as PlugX), and\n[a RAT called Tmanger (which was first documented by NTT Security and was used during](https://vblocalhost.com/conference/presentations/operation-lagtime-it-colourful-panda-footprint/%22%20/)\nOperation Lagtime IT campaigns attributed to [TA428 by Proofpoint). A connection with the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/chinese-apt-operation-lagtime-it-targets-government-information-technology%22%20/)\nShadowPad backdoor, which is now used by at least five different threat actors, was also\nfound.\n\nTwo different trojanized installers, as well as a likely compromised update system, were\nused to deliver the payloads. According to our telemetry we think the Able update\nsystem has been compromised since at least June 2020 and trojanized installers delivered\nsince at least May 2018.\n\nAdditionally, yesterday, Avast published a blogpost documenting a\ncampaign targeting government agencies and a national data center in Mongolia.\nDuring that campaign, the attackers compromised an unknown company that was providing\ngovernment institutions in East Asia and leveraged that compromise to deliver HyperBro by\nemail. We believe that compromised company was Able, as the filename used in\nthat malicious email attachment is probably AbleTimeAccess_Update.exe, and we observed\nsuch a file being used to drop the same HyperBro sample as described in Avast’s blogpost.\n\nA diagram summarizing the connections between LuckyMouse, TA428 and\nthe ShadowPad backdoor C&C infrastructure is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Summary of the connections between LuckyMouse, TA428 and the ShadowPad backdoor\n\nRegarding the attribution of Operation StealthyTrident, considering that HyperBro is\ncommonly attributed to LuckyMouse, that Tmanger was attributed to TA428 and that it uses\none of the ShadowPad C&C servers, multiple competing hypotheses exist:\n\nLuckyMouse has access to Tmanger and ShadowPad.\nLuckyMouse share its access to the compromised Able Desktop update server with\nthe TA428 group or some other group having access to Tmanger.\nHyperBro is now shared with TA428 or some other group having access to\nTmanger and ShadowPad.\nLuckyMouse and TA428 are subgroups of the same threat actor.\n\nAlthough originally only known to be used by the Winnti Group, it should also be noted here\nthat since at least October 2019, ShadowPad has been shared amongst multiple threat\n[actors including the Winnti Group,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/14/connecting-dots-exposing-arsenal-methods-winnti/) [CactusPete,](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/) [TICK,](https://www.macnica.net/pdf/mpressioncss_ta_report_2019_4_en.pdf) [IceFog and KeyBoy.](https://youtu.be/YCwyc6SctYs?t=1347)\n\nAdditional elements regarding the connection between Tmanger and TA428 will be\npublished in a second blogpost documenting another campaign where the attackers used\nboth Tmanger and ShadowPad.\n\nWe called this campaign Operation StealthyTrident because the attackers make extensive\nuse of a three-pronged “trident” side-loading technique.\n\n### Compromised Able Desktop \n\nAble Desktop is chat software included\nas part of the Able business management suite used in Mongolia. It is a Chromiumbased JavaScript app making use of the NodeJS library. [According to Able, their software](https://web.able.mn/customers/a)\n\n\n-----\n\nsuite is used by 430 government agencies in Mongolia.\n\nIn mid-2018, we observed a first occurrence of the\n[legitimate Able Desktop application being used to download and execute HyperBro.](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/)\nHyperBro is a backdoor commonly attributed to LuckyMouse (also known as Emissary\nPanda or APT27). Able Desktop was also used to download and execute Tmanger; in that\ncase, the Able Desktop software itself was not trojanized (i.e. it did not contain malicious\ncode). The most likely hypothesis is that the Able Desktop update system was\ncompromised.\n\nIn addition to legitimate Able Desktop applications used to drop and execute HyperBro,\nlikely using its update system, we also found two Able Desktop installers that\nwere actually trojanized and contained the HyperBro backdoor and the Korplug RAT. The\nfirst occurrence of this trojanized Able Desktop installer dates back to December 2017. A\ntimeline of these events is shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Timeline of the various implants used with either a trojanized Able Desktop installer or\n\nlikely delivered through Able Desktop update\n\nWe notified Able about these compromises.\n\n### Able Desktop update mechanism\n\nTo update itself, Able Desktop downloads the update installer through HTTPS. The code\nresponsible for the update is shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. JavaScript code responsible for Able Desktop updates\n\nThe downloaded update installer is saved to %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\Able\\Able\nDesktop.exe. Once downloaded, the installer is executed. In the case of a legitimate update\ninstaller, a new version of Able Desktop will be installed. We observed,\nhowever, that starting in mid-2018, the executable downloaded wasn’t a legitimate\ninstaller, but rather the HyperBro backdoor. Since, in that case, the executable is not an\nAble Desktop installer but plain malware, no update installation takes place and HyperBro is\nexecuted instead —and Able Desktop is not updated anymore.\n\nMultiple elements support the hypothesis of a compromise of the update server:\n\nThe filename and the path used to download HyperBro are the filename and path\nused by the update system.\nThe update is downloaded through HTTPS, so a man–in–the–middle attack is\nunlikely.\nHyperBro was dropped on all computers using Able Desktop during the same\ntimeframe as previous legitimate updates.\nThe malicious Able Desktop.exe is dropped by the real Able Desktop software and\nnot malware masquerading as Able Desktop.\nNo legitimate updates have been installed since the beginning of the campaign.\n\nWe believe this is enough to state that the update mechanism was compromised. It should\nbe noted that Able Desktop has multiple update servers, some of them hosted at customer\norganizations. Since we have no information on which update server was\nused by these victims, we don’t know whether Able was compromised, or one of\ntheir customer’s update servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe list of update servers used by Able Desktop is shown in Figure 4. We can see from that\nlist that Able Desktop is indeed used by several government entities such as the Mineral\nResource Authority of Mongolia, the Ministry of Justice and Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of\nConstruction and Urban Development, the Development Bank of Mongolia or the Mongolian\nState University of Education.\n\nFigure 4.

It is unknown to us whether these\ninstallers were downloadable from the Able website or from another source.\n\nAble Desktop installers, both legitimate and trojanized, are 7-Zip SFX installers and are not\nsigned. In the case of trojanized installers, the legitimate Able Desktop software is bundled\nwith either HyperBro or Korplug. The payload and its side–loading host are packaged in\na data1.dat file which is a 7-Zip SFX archive while Able Desktop is packaged\nin a data.dat file which is an Advanced Installer. The content of the trojanized installer is\nsummarized in Figure 5. The same IntgStat.exe side–loading\nhost and pcalocalresloader.dll are used in both the root of the Able Desktop.exe archive\nand data1.dat archive.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Trojanized Able Desktop installer content\n\nThe 7-Zip SFX installer first executes IntgStat.exe, a legitimate Symantec executable, which\nis a DLL side–loading host used to load pcalocalresloader.dll. This DLL is used to decrypt\nand load the XOR-encoded payload stored in thumb.db. This payload, XOR encoded\nwith 0x04, once mapped into memory by the payload loader, will decompress and execute\nan embedded, LZNT1–compressed PE executable that is used to rename data.dat (the\nlegitimate installer) and data1.dat (the malicious payload) as Able\nDesktop.exe and data1.exe respectively, and then execute them.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce executed, the newly renamed data1.exe 7-Zip SFX archive will extract its\ncontents and execute the second IntgStat.exe side–loading host, which then\nloads pcalocalresloader.dll. Again pcalocalresloader.dll is used to load the XORencoded payload stored in the thumb.db file. As before, this payload will decompress and\nexecute an embedded LZNT1–compressed PE executable, which is actually HyperBro.\n\nNote that, in the case of the Able Desktop installer trojanized with Korplug, the same side–\nloading host and DLL are used to execute data1.dat, while the side–loading host used to\nexecute Korplog itself is not IntgStat.exe, but siteadv.exe – a legitimate\nexecutable from McAfee – and the loader DLL is called siteadv.dll. Apart from this change of\nside–loading host, the payload delivery mechanism is the same.\n\n## HyperBro\n\nThe HyperBro backdoor is LuckyMouse’s custom backdoor used since at least 2013 and in\ncontinuous development. The variant being used here is similar to the variant described\nby [Palo Alto Networks and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/emissary-panda-attacks-middle-east-government-sharepoint-servers/%22%20/) [Kaspersky. HyperBro was delivered to victims by both the](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/)\nlegitimate Able Desktop software and a trojanized Able Desktop installer.\n\nSimilar to the version used with the trojanized Able Desktop installer, in the case of the\nHyperBro implant downloaded by the legitimate Able Desktop, its first stage consists in a 7Zip SFX containing:\n\nthinprobe.exe, a legitimate Symantec executable used for DLL side–loading\nthinprobe.dll, a HyperBro loader\nthumbs.db, the XOR-encoded payload\n\nHyperBro’s loader DLL, thinprobe.dll, is executed by DLL side–loading\nusing the thinprobe.exe executable, which is a legitimate, signed Symantec\nexecutable. While the side–loading host used with the downloaded HyperBro is different,\nthe DLL used to decode and execute the thumbs.db payload is exactly the same.\n\nThis technique is very similar to the three–pronged trident attack reported by a Kaspersky\nresearcher. Both thinprobe.exe and Intgstat.exe side–loading hosts were previously used\nby LuckyMouse to load HyperBro.\n\nNote, however, that contrary to previously documented HyperBro droppers employing such\na trident, the payload here is not Shikata Ga Nai encoded but XOR encoded with the\nvalue 0x04.\n\nThe C&C URL of the HyperBro implant used with the trojanized Able Desktop installer\nis https://developer.firefoxapi[.]com/ajax, while the C&C URL used by the one downloaded\nby the legitimate Able Desktop is https://139.180.208[.]225/ajax.\n\n\n-----\n\nConsidering HyperBro s compilation timestamps, the version used with the trojanized\ninstaller was compiled Fri Dec 08 05:22:23 2017 while the version downloaded by Able\nDesktop was compiled Mon Mar 11 03:23:54 2019. This suggests that the trojanized\ninstaller was used before the version downloaded by the Able Desktop updater. The\ntrojanized installer was first seen in our telemetry in May 2018, while the version\ndownloaded by Able Desktop was first seen in June 2020 (see the timeline in Figure 2).\n\n## Korplug\n\nThe Korplug RAT (also known as PlugX) is used by multiple different threat groups. In\nthis case, it was only delivered via the trojanized Able Desktop installer and we have seen\nno occurrence of Korplug being downloaded by legitimate Able Desktop software.\n\nAs mentioned previously, and similar to installers trojanized\nwith HyperBro, Korplug is bundled in the installer with the legitimate Able Desktop and\nexecuted twice via the trident model by DLL side–loading using IntgStat.exe as host\nexecutable and then siteadv.exe. The identical DLL is used to decode and execute\nthe thumbs.db XOR-encoded payload as the one used with the installer trojanized\nwith HyperBro, providing a strong link between these two trojanized installers.\n\nThe C&C address used by Korplug is 45.77.173[.]124:443. Interestingly, this address was\nalso used by a CobaltStrike implant targeting a school in Mongolia during the same\ntimeframe.\n\nIts compilation timestamp (Sun Dec 08 06:22:34 2019) as well as the compilation\ntimestamp of the installer (Wed Sep 04 16:52:04 2019) suggest that it was used after the\nAble Desktop installer trojanized with HyperBro and before HyperBro was downloaded by\nlegitimate Able Desktop software. See the timeline in Figure 2.\n\n## Tmanger\n\nTmanger is a RAT that was first documented by [NTT Security and](https://vblocalhost.com/conference/presentations/operation-lagtime-it-colourful-panda-footprint/)\nthat was used in Operation Lagtime IT which was [attributed to TA428 by Proofpoint. It is](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/chinese-apt-operation-lagtime-it-targets-government-information-technology)\ncalled Tmanger because it is apparently the name given by its developer, as we can see\nfrom its PDB path, as an example:\n\nc:\\users\\waston\\desktop\\20190403_tmanger\\20191118 tm_new 1.0\\release\\mloaddll.pdb\n\nConsidering the variant we observed during Operation StealthyTrident no PDB path was\npresent but it is still very similar to the one documented by NTT Security in\ntheir blogpost. As an example of similarity between the two samples, the connection\nprocedure used by one of the Tmanger samples documented by\nNTT Security (14140782A68FF20000C7E9F58336620A65D4D168) and the one dropped\nby Able Desktop are shown side-by-side in Figure 6\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Comparison of the connection routine in Tmanger sample dropped by legitimate Able Desktop\n\n(left) and one of the samples documented by NTT SecurityOne notable difference is that in the case of\nthe Able Desktop variant, Tmanger is packaged is one single executable, while the variant described by\n\nNTT Security consists of three DLLs.\n\nESET telemetry shows the first download of this Tmanger variant by the legitimate Able\nDesktop software in July 2020. Tmanger replaced HyperBro on that system and HyperBro\nwas not seen downloaded to it after that.\n\nThe C&C addresses used by this Tmanger implant, downloaded by Able Desktop, are\nstored in an RC4-encrypted configuration and are the following:\n\n45.77.55[.]145:80\n45.77.55[.]145:443\n45.77.55[.]145:8080\n\nThe communication protocol is TCP and the messages are RC4 encrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, the first address is part of the ShadowPad network infrastructure and, to the\nbest of our knowledge, none of these addresses are overlapping with LuckyMouse\ninfrastructure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nESET Research discovered a campaign targeting Mongolian\norganizations that relied on compromised Able Desktop installers and compromises to the\nAble update system to deliver HyperBro, Korplug and Tmanger malware.\n\nThis campaign shows a connection with the ShadowPad backdoor, as we observed network\ninfrastructure overlaps between the ShadowPad C&C network infrastructure and one of the\nTmanger C&C addresses.\n\nApart from the use of HyperBro, developed and commonly used by LuckyMouse, we found\nno significant overlap with the LuckyMouse toolset or network\ninfrastructure. Does this mean that LuckyMouse has access to ShadowPad and Tmanger or\ndid LuckyMouse share their access to a compromised Able Desktop update\nserver with the TA428 group? Another hypothesis could be that, similarly to\nShadowPad, HyperBro is now shared with other threat actors. Finally, one last hypothesis\ncould be that LuckyMouse and TA428 are closely related threat actors or are actually\nthe same.\n\n[Indicators of Compromise can also be found on GitHub.
