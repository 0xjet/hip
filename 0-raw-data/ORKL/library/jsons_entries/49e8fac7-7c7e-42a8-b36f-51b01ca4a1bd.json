backdoor\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/defense-contractors-hit-by-stealthy-sockdetour-windows-backdoor/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/defense-contractors-hit-by-stealthy-sockdetour-windows-backdoor/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nFebruary 24, 2022\n11:43 AM\n0\n\n_Image:_ _[Milo Bauman](https://unsplash.com/@mjearlb)_\n\nA new custom malware dubbed SockDetour found on systems belonging to US defense\ncontractors has been used as a backup backdoor to maintain access to compromised\nnetworks.\n\nThe malicious payload was spotted by Unit 42 security researchers, who believe that its\noperators kept the backdoor under the radar for a long time as it has been used in the wild\nsince at least July 2019.\n\nSockDetour's stealthiness can be explained by the fact that it \"operates filelessly and\nsocketlessly\" on infected Windows servers by hijacking network connections, making it a lot\nharder to detect at the host and network levels.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The connection hijacking is done using the legitimate Microsoft Detours library package used](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours)\nfor Windows API call monitoring and instrumentation.\n\n\"With such implementation, SockDetour [..] serves as a backup backdoor in case the primary\n[backdoor is detected and removed by defenders,\" Unit 42 explained.](http://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/sockdetour/)\n\nIn one of the attacks, the threat actors also used a very specific delivery server, a QNAP\nnetwork-attached storage (NAS) device typically used by small businesses and previously\ninfected with QLocker ransomware — they likely exploited the same security flaw (the CVE2021-28799 remote code execution bug) to gain access to the server.\n\n_SockDetour backdoor workflow (Unit 42)_\nThe researchers first spotted the malware being deployed onto the Windows server of at\nleast one US defense contractor on July 27, 2021, which led to the discovery of three other\ndefense orgs being targeted by the same group with the same backdoor.\n\n\"Based on Unit 42’s telemetry data and the analysis of the collected samples, we believe the\nthreat actor behind SockDetour has been focused on targeting U.S.-based defense\ncontractors using the tools,\" the researchers revealed.\n\n\"Unit 42 has evidence of at least four defense contractors being targeted by this campaign,\nwith a compromise of at least one contractor.\"\n\n## The Chinese connection\n\nThe SockDetour backdoor is used in attacks by an APT activity cluster tracked by Unit 42 as\nTiltedTemple and previously linked to attacks exploiting several vulnerabilities in Zoho\nproducts, including ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus (CVE-2021-40539) and ServiceDesk\nPlus (CVE-2021-44077).\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the company did not attribute the SockDetour malware to a specific hacking group,\nUnit 42 researchers suspected in November that the TiltedTemple campaign is the work of a\n[Chinese-sponsored threat group tracked as APT27.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0027/)\n\nThe partial attribution is based on tactics and malicious tools matching APT27's previous\nactivity and similar targeting of the same range of industry sectors (e.g., defense, technology,\nenergy, aerospace, government, and manufacturing) for cyber espionage.\n\nTiltedTemple attacks focused on Zoho vulnerabilities led to the breach of networks belonging\nto critical infrastructure orgs organizations worldwide in three different campaigns throughout\n2021, using:\n\n[an ADSelfService zero-day exploit between early-August and mid-September,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-and-cisa-warn-of-state-hackers-exploiting-critical-zoho-bug/)\n[an n-day AdSelfService exploit until late October,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/state-hackers-breach-defense-energy-healthcare-orgs-worldwide/)\n[and a ServiceDesk one starting with October 25.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-in-house-zoho-servicedesk-exploit-to-drop-webshells/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[US, UK link new Cyclops Blink malware to Russian
