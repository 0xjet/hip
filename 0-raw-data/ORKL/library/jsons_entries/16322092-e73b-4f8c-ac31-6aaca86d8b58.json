Organizations\n\naround the world are at risk of APT attacks. Top targets of APT\n\ngroups include governments, industrial companies, the financial\n\nsector, and science and education.\n\n� [TA505, an APT group, has expanded its reach to new countries](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/ta505-rising-to-become-worlds-most-dangerous-cybercriminal-group/)\n\nand sectors.\n\n� By a two-to-one ratio, data theft is a more common motivation for\n\nattackers than direct financial gain.\n\n� Personal data accounted for one quarter of all data stolen from or\nganizations. From individuals, data thieves most frequently made\n\noff with usernames and passwords (which comprised 47% of data\n\nstolen from individuals).\n\n� Malware infections are on the rise. Three quarters of attacks on\n\norganizations, and nearly two thirds of attacks on individuals, in\nvolved malware infections.\n\n� Spyware was responsible for one in three malware infections\n\namong both organizations and individuals. Just as ransomware\n\naccounts for a high percentage of infections of organizations\n\n(27%), adware hits individuals particularly hard (21%).\n\n� In 81 percent of cases, malware infections of corporate infrastruc\nture started with a phishing message. For individuals, the most\n\nfrequent attack vector included visiting a malicious website: 35\n\npercent of malware infections in Q3 took place in this way.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Statistics\n\nIn Q3, data theft was the motivation for 61 percent of attacks on organizations and 64 percent of attacks\n\non individuals (compared to 58% and 55%, respectively, in Q2). Direct financial gain, at 31 percent, was\n\nequally popular as motivation for attacks against both organizations and individuals. Attackers seeking\n\ndirect financial gain from organizations generally use ransomware to demand a ransom for decrypting\n\nthe victim's data. Against individuals, such direct gain tends to involve intrusive advertising and mobile\n\napps with subscriptions to paid services.\n\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\nAccess to information\n\nFinancial profit\n\nHacktivism\n\nCyberwar\n\n\n31%\n\n\n7% 1% 61% 31% 5% 64%\n\nin attacks in attacks\non organizations on individuals\n\nFigure 1. Attackers' motives\n\n\nBreaches of personal data remain a major concern. In Q3, personal data accounted for one fourth of all\n\n[data stolen from organizations.

Almost half (47%) of data stolen from individ\nuals consisted of credentials. Users may fall victim to clever phishing attacks designed to trick them into\n\n[revealing usernames and passwords. For example, over 200 clients of Halyk Bank in Kazakhstan failed](https://news.myseldon.com/en/news/index/213399649)\n\n[to notice a slight discrepancy in the online address of the bank.

From 47 percent\n\nin the first quarter, they rose to 59 percent in the second quarter and now 65 percent in the third quarter.\n\nWe associate this trend with increased activity by APT groups. In Q3, the PT Expert Security Center (PT\n\nESC) detected attacks by APT groups including TA505, RTM, Cobalt, Bronze Union, APT-C-35, KONNI,\n\nand Gamaredon.\n\nAttackers continue to be interested in government targets. Such targets accounted for 23 percent of\n\nattacks, representing an increase of 4 percentage points over Q2. Attackers also pursue targets relating\n\nto industrial companies, finance, and education and science.

Number of incidents in Q3 2019 (by week)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Attack methods\n\nHere we will describe the attack methods used by criminals, based on some of the highest-profile cy\nberincidents in Q3 2019.\n\n##### Malware use\n\n[During the third quarter, the PT ESC regularly recorded attacks by APT group TA505. The group's arse-](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/ta505-rising-to-become-worlds-most-dangerous-cybercriminal-group/)\n\nnal includes Dridex (a banking trojan), Cryptomix (ransomware signed with certificates issued to dummy\n\nlegal entities), ServHelper and FlawedAmmyy (remote administration trojans), and Upxxec (a plugin able\n\nto detect and disable a large range of antivirus software). The attackers made active use of phishing to\n\nsend messages to organizations around the world related to finance, industry, government, science, and\n\ntransportation. Some of their campaigns are analyzed in more detail in individual sections of this report.\n\nIn Q3, our experts also detected new activity by Bronze Union (also known as LuckyMouse or APT27),\n\nwhich uses ZxShell malware for remote access. The malware components had been digitally signed with\n\ncompromised certificates belonging to various companies. Once installed, ZxShell is difficult to detect\n\nwith normal antivirus techniques: the attackers place a special rootkit on infected systems to swap out\n\nthe installation paths to malware modules with the paths to legitimate utilities upon access.\n\nFigure 8. ZxShell installer signed with a compromised certificate\n\n[The operators of the Sodinokibi ransomware, which we already covered in the second quarter, continue](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2019-q2/)\n\n[to act aggressively. A breach of cloud provider PerCSoft resulted in encryption of data belonging to](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-hits-hundreds-of-dentist-offices-in-the-us/)\n\n[the company's client base of approximately 400 dental clinics. In August, over 20 Texas communities](https://dir.texas.gov/View-About-DIR/Information-Security/Pages/Content.aspx?id=155)\n\n[fell victim to this ransomware. The attackers constantly invent new methods for placing Sodinokibi on](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/in/security/news/cyber-attacks/texas-municipalities-hit-by-revil-sodinokibi-paid-no-ransom-over-half-resume-operations)\n\nvictim computers.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the third quarter, mining software fell to 3 percent of attacks on organizations and just 2 percent of\n\nattacks on individuals. In our view, this is because attackers are gradually switching to malware with\n\nmultifunction capabilities. One example is the Clipsa trojan, which can stealthily mine cryptocurrency,\n\nsteal passwords, tamper with addresses of cryptocurrency wallets, and launch brute-force attacks\n\nagainst WordPress sites.\n\n\n2% 11% 34%\n\n\n35%\n\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\nSpyware\n\nAdware\n\nBanking trojans\n\nRATs\n\nCryptolockers\n\nDroppers\n\nMultifunctional malware\n\nMiners\n\nOther\n\n\n1%\n3%\n3%\n\n6%\n\n1%\n5%\n\n12%\n\n\n9%\n\nin attacks in attacks\non organizations on individuals\n\n23%\n\n26%\n\nFigure 10.

The botnet's operators offer malware as a service (MaaS): by providing access to Emotet\ninfected computers, they enable other cybercriminals to infect victims with additional malware. Since\n\nSeptember, they have been sending out malicious mailings disguised as invoices, financial documents,\n\n[and even a free version of the new book by Edward Snowden. The attachments to these messages](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-tries-to-infect-you-by-claiming-its-snowdens-book/)\n\ninfect the victim with the Emotet trojan. With it, the botnet operators can place yet more malware on\n\ncompromised devices, such as the Trickbot trojan or Ryuk ransomware, which are frequently found\n\n[together on infected machines.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/)\n\n\n1% 81%\n\n\n5% 2% 35%\n\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\nEmail\n\nCompromised servers\nand workstations\n\nWebsites\n\nOfficial app stores\n\nChat and SMS\nmessages\n\nFake updates\n\nSocial networks\n\n\nFor attackers, social engineering is a perennial favorite. This method figured in 69 percent of attacks\n\non organizations in the third quarter, compared to 37 percent in the second quarter. Cybercriminals\n\ncontinue to rack up huge amounts by forging messages or employing business email compromise\n\n(BEC) to send phishing messages. They present themselves as belonging to a trusted company (such\n\nas a vendor) and send an invoice with their own bank account number. In the state of North Carolina,\n\n[Cabarrus County received an email stating that the account number of the county's construction con-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/north-carolina-county-lost-17-million-in-bec-scam/)\n\ntractor had changed. Not realizing that the message was a fake, the county transferred $2.5 million to\n\n\n-----\n\n[an account belonging to cybercriminals instead of the contractor. A similar attack hit Toyota Boshoku](https://www.toyota-boshoku.com/global/content/wp-content/uploads/190906e.pdf)\n\n[Corporation, which lost a whopping $37.5 million. According to the U.S.-based Internet Crime](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/business-email-compromise-is-a-26-billion-scam-says-the-fbi/)\n\nComplaint Center (IC3), worldwide losses from BEC fraud in the last three years top $26 billion.\n\nA malicious link, even if sent from a trusted address, can be blocked by email security gateways. But\n\n[cybercriminals keep finding ways to evade anti-phishing systems. In Q3, attackers sent messages to](https://cofense.com/phishing-emails-using-sharepoint-slip-past-symantecs-gateway-attack-banks/)\n\nbank employees with a link to a compromised SharePoint site. There the attackers had posted a doc\nument with another link, which led victims to a fake page asking for their username and password. If\n\nthe phishing link had been included directly in the email message, anti-phishing systems might have\n\nblocked it. But SharePoint links had been whitelisted and therefore were not blocked.\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\nFigure 11. Phishing attack involving compromised SharePoint resources\n\n##### Hacking\n\nAs we regularly remind readers, it is critical to keep software up to date. When a software vulnerability\n\nbecomes known to the public, the first to get attacked are the organizations and individuals who have\n\nfailed to install the relevant updates quickly. In one example in Q3, the eGobbler criminal group respon\n[sible for inserting malicious ads into web pages continued to exploit vulnerability CVE-2019-5840, af-](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5840)\n\nfecting the Chrome browser for iOS, which had been patched back in June. But soon after the browser\n\n[update was released, eGobbler found a new vulnerability, this time in the WebKit engine. The vulnera-](https://blog.confiant.com/malvertiser-egobbler-exploits-chrome-webkit-bugs-infects-over-1-billion-ads-6b8ccc41b0e6)\n\nbility allows displaying pop-up ads every time the keyboard is used for site navigation. The vulnerability\n\nhas been fixed in iOS 13 and Safari 13.0.1.\n\n[Last quarter, we mentioned critical RDS vulnerability CVE-2019-0708, better known as BlueKeep. In](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2019-q2/)\n\n[August, Microsoft fixed another two vulnerabilities in RDS. These new critical vulnerabilities CVE-2019-](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1181)\n\n[1181 and CVE-2019-1182 resemble BlueKeep but affect more recent versions of Windows, including serv-](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1181)\n\ner versions.\n\n##### Web attacks\n\n[In late September, an exploit became public for a zero-day vulnerability in the vBulletin forum engine.](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Sep/31)\n\n[News spread quickly of Remote Code Execution vulnerability CVE-2019-16759, exploitation of which](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16759)\n\n[does not require logging in to a vulnerable forum. Some security experts state that they had knowledge](https://twitter.com/cBekrar/status/1176803541047861249)\n\nof the vulnerability years prior. At the end of September, the issue with vBulletin enabled attackers to\n\n[breach the Comodo forums. Reports indicate that data for over 170,000 users is being sold on the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/comodo-forums-breached-data-of-over-170-000-users-up-for-grabs/)\n\ndarkweb.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor users who make online purchases, MageCart JavaScript sniffers remain a hazard. These sniffers are\n\nsmall scripts that attackers use to infect sites with online payment functionality. In Q3 2019, Trend Micro\n\n[researchers discovered malicious scripts on the sites of two major hotel chains. The attacks affected](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/magecart-skimming-attack-targets-mobile-users-of-hotel-chain-booking-websites/)\n\nguests who paid for their stays via mobile devices. Experts established that the hotels had fallen victim\n\n[to a supply chain attack. MageCart sniffers were placed on the site by means of an infected JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/supply-chain-malware)\n\nlibrary. This library was used by the company responsible for developing both of the hotel sites.\n\nBut web security is an issue for more than just online services and Internet stores. A file upload vulner\n[ability in property management software SuperINN Plus enabled attackers to hack the application by](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/Sark Notice of Data Security Incident (California)_1.PDF)\n\nuploading a web shell (a PHP script that, when run on a server, enables remote command execution). In\n\n[addition, the attackers were able to perform SQL injection. They obtained the encrypted card numbers,](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/how-to-prevent-sql-injection-attacks/)\n\npersonal data, and contact details for over 43,000 people. The attackers are believed to have succeed\ned in obtaining the decryption key. This incident underscores the need to regularly audit the security of\n\nweb applications. Arbitrary File Upload is a widespread critical vulnerability, which in 2018 our experts\n\n[found in one out of every four web applications tested.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/upload/corporate/ww-en/analytics/Web-Vulnerabilities-2019-eng.pdf)\n\n##### Credential compromise\n\nNo company is immune to compromised credentials.

In Q3 2019, the PT ESC detected phishing mailings by\n\nTA505 to governmental entities in South Korea, China, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe RTM group has also turned its gaze to government. In Q3, PT ESC experts detected phishing mes\nsages sent to governmental organizations in Russia and Belarus.\n\nFigure 15. Phishing message from the RTM group to a Russian governmental organization\n\n\n-----\n\nPT ESC has also noted attacks on government entities by the Gamaredon group. The attackers are inter\nested only in entities related to the Ukrainian government: their C2 servers filter by geographic region.\n\nIn their attacks, the group uses a chain of scripts that download the Ultra VNC remote control utility to\n\nthe victim's computer.\n\nFigure 16. Phishing message from the Gamaredon group supposedly from the OSCE\n\nIn addition in Q3, the PT ESC recorded attacks by APT-C-35 (also known as Donot). The group sent\n\nphishing mailings containing an Office document linking to an RTF file, which contained an exploit for\n\n[vulnerability CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office Equation Editor. yty malicious modules were installed](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0802)\n\non compromised computers.\n\nRansomware operators also have governments in their sights. They hope to receive large payouts for\n\nrestoring encrypted files. And their appetites are constantly increasing. Besides Sodinokibi attacks on\n\ngovernments in Texas, mentioned already in the report, another wave of attacks by Ryuk ransomware\n\n[hit throughout the U.S. La Porte County in Indiana paid ransom of $130,000 to cybercriminals.

PT ESC experts detected phishing mailings to Russian and\n\nEuropean banks. As spear phishing emails, they are carefully prepared and well composed. In July, the\n\ngroup sent messages from a hacked email address belonging to an employee of a Moscow airport.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24. Malicious attachment from Cobalt phishing message\n\nFigure 25.

One possible reason is the start of the academic year. Schools are on the receiving\n\n[end of numerous ransomware attacks. Cyberattacks on Louisiana schools led to declaration of a state](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/89194/cyber-crime/louisiana-schools-cyber-attacks.html)\n\n[of emergency.](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/89194/cyber-crime/louisiana-schools-cyber-attacks.html)\n\n[The APT group Cobalt Dickens has resumed its hunt for intellectual property. Experts at Secureworks](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/cobalt-dickens-goes-back-to-school-again)\n\nindicated that among the regular recipients of the group's phishing messages, there are 60 educational\n\ninstitutions. In these messages, the criminals lured victims to fake library websites, on which users were\n\nasked to log in. By entering their username and password on the page, users effectively handed their\n\ncredentials over to attackers.\n\n[In summer 2019, Microsoft detected new malware, which was dubbed Nodersok. Most Nodersok in-](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/09/26/bring-your-own-lolbin-multi-stage-fileless-nodersok-campaign-delivers-rare-node-js-based-malware/)\n\nfections (42%) are in the educational sector. Infections take place via malicious website advertising.\n\nCompromise begins with download of an HTA file. The result of this multistage attack is that the comput\ner is infected with malware that turns it into a proxy server for forwarding malicious traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### What companies can do to stay safe\n\n###### Use proven security solutions\n\n� Centrally manage software updates and patches. To prioritize update plans\n\ncorrectly, the most pressing security threats must be taken into account.\n\n� Install antivirus software with a sandbox for dynamically scanning files and\n\nthe ability to detect and block threats such as malicious email attachments\n\nbefore they are opened by employees. Ideally, antivirus software should\n\nsimultaneously support solutions from multiple vendors and have the ability\n\nto detect signs of hidden or obfuscated malware, as well as block malicious\n\nactivity across diverse data streams: email, web traffic, network traffic, file\n\nstorage, and web portals. It should be able to check files both in real time\n\nand retrospectively, by automatically re-scanning files when signature data\nbases are updated to detect previously unknown threats.\n\n� We also recommend using SIEM solutions for timely detection and effective\n\nresponse to information security incidents. This will help identify suspicious\n\nactivity, prevent infrastructure hacking, detect attackers' presence, and en\nable prompt measures to neutralize threats.\n\n� Use automated software audit tools to identify vulnerabilities.\n\n� Deploy web application firewalls as a preventive measure.\n\n� Detect sophisticated targeted attacks in real time and in saved traffic with\n\ndeep traffic analysis. Using such solutions will allow you to detect previously\n\nunnoticed attacks and monitor network attacks in real time, including use of\n\nmalware and hacking tools, exploitation of software vulnerabilities, and at\ntacks on the domain controller. Such an approach quickly identifies attacker\n\npresence in the infrastructure, minimizes the risk of loss of critical data and\n\ndisruption to business systems, and decreases the financial damage caused\n\nby attackers.\n\n� Employ specialized anti-DDoS services.\n\n###### Protect your data\n\n� Encrypt all sensitive information. Do not store sensitive information where\n\nit can be publicly accessed.\n\n� Perform regular backups and keep them on dedicated servers that are iso\nlated from the network segments used for day-to-day operations.\n\n� Minimize the privileges of users and services as much as possible.\n\n� Use a different username and password for each site or service.\n\n� Use two-factor authentication where possible, especially for privileged\n\naccounts.\n\n###### Do not allow weak passwords\n\n� Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.\n\n\n-----\n\n� Require password changes every 90 days.\n\n� Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.\n\n###### Monitor the security situation\n\n� Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.\n\n� Test and educate employees regarding information security.\n\n� Make sure that insecure resources do not appear on the network perimeter.\n\nRegularly take an inventory of Internet-accessible resources, check their se\ncurity, and remediate any vulnerabilities found. It is a good idea to monitor\n\nthe news for any new vulnerabilities: this gives a head start in identifying\n\naffected resources and taking necessary measures.\n\n� Filter traffic to minimize the number of network service interfaces acces\nsible to an external attacker. Pay special attention to interfaces for remote\n\nmanagement of servers and network equipment.\n\n� Regularly perform penetration testing to identify new vectors for attacking\n\ninternal infrastructure and evaluate the effectiveness of current measures.\n\n� Regularly audit the security of web applications, including source-code\n\nanalysis, to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities that put application sys\ntems and clients at risk of attack.\n\n� Keep an eye on the number of requests per second received by resources.\n\nConfigure servers and network devices to withstand typical attack scenari\nos (such as TCP/UDP flooding or high numbers of database requests).\n\n###### Help clients to stay safe\n\n� Improve security awareness among clients.\n\n� Regularly remind clients how to stay safe online from the most common\n\nattacks.\n\n� Urge clients to not enter their credentials on suspicious websites and to not\n\ngive out such information by email or over the phone.\n\n� Explain what clients should do if they suspect fraud.\n\n� Inform of security-related events.\n\n#### How vendors can secure their products\n\n� All the measures described for organizations, plus:\n\n� Implement a secure development lifecycle (SSDL).\n\n� Regularly audit the security of software and web applications, including\n\nsource-code analysis.\n\n� Keep web servers and database software up to date.\n\n� Do not use libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### How users can avoid falling victim\n\n###### Do not skimp on security\n\n� Use only licensed software.\n\n� Maintain effective antivirus protection on all devices.\n\n� Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.\n\n###### Protect your data\n\n� Back up critical files. In addition to storing them on your hard drive, keep a\n\ncopy on a USB drive, external disk, or a backup service in the cloud.\n\n� Use an account without administrator privileges for everyday tasks.\n\n� Use two-factor authentication where possible, such as for email accounts.\n\n###### Do not use trivial passwords\n\n� Use complex passwords consisting of at least eight hard-to-guess letters,\n\nnumbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to\n\ncreate and store passwords securely.\n\n� Do not re-use passwords. Set a unique password for each site, email\n\naccount, and system that you use.\n\n� Change all passwords at least once every six months, or even better, every\n\ntwo to three months.\n\n###### Be vigilant\n\n� Scan all email attachments with antivirus software.\n\n� Be mindful of sites with invalid certificates. Remember that data entered on\n\nsuch sites could be intercepted by criminals.\n\n� Pay close attention when entering passwords or making payments online.\n\n� Do not click links to unknown suspicious sites, especially if a security warning\n\nappears.\n\n� Do not click links in pop-up windows, even if you know the company or\n\nproduct being advertised.\n\n� Do not download files from suspicious sites or unknown sources.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### About the research\n\nIn this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the\n\nmost important and emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn from\n\nour own expertise, outcomes of numerous investigations, and data from\n\nauthoritative sources.\n\nFor the purposes of this report, any particular mass incident (such as a vi\nrus attack in which criminals send phishing messages to a large number of\n\ntargets) is counted as one unique security threat. Terms used in this report:\n\nA cyberthreat is a combination of factors and circumstances that create\n\nthe risk of information security compromise. In this report, we look at cyber\nthreats in terms of the actions of malefactors in cyberspace who attempt\n\nto breach an information system in order to steal money or data, or with\n\nother intentions potentially causing harm to government, business, or indi\nviduals. Attacker actions may be directed against the target company's IT\n\ninfrastructure, workstations, mobile devices, other equipment, or at people\n\nas a factor in cyberspace.\n\nA cyberattack consists of unauthorized actions targeting information sys\ntems by cybercriminals leveraging techniques and software to obtain ac\ncess to information, impair the normal functioning or availability of systems,\n\nor to steal, alter, or delete information.\n\nAn attack target is the target of unauthorized actions by cybercriminals. In\n\ncases when social engineering is used to obtain information directly from\n\nan individual, client, or employee, the attack target is \"Humans.\" On the\n\nother hand, when social engineering is part of an attempt to place malware\n\non corporate infrastructure or on the computer of an individual, the attack\n\ntarget is \"Computers, servers, and network equipment.\"\n\nAttack motive is the overall goal of cybercriminals. If an attack results in\n\ntheft of payment card information, the motive is \"data theft.\"\n\nAttack methods are a set of techniques used to achieve a goal. For instance,\n\nan attacker might perform reconnaissance, detect vulnerable network ser\nvices available for connection, exploit vulnerabilities, and get access to re\nsources or information. For the purposes of this report, such a process is\n\nreferred to as \"hacking.\" Credential compromise and web attacks are put in\n\nseparate categories for greater granularity.\n\nVictim categories are the economic sectors in which the attacked com\npanies operate (or individuals, if the attack was indiscriminate with respect\n\nto employer). For example, the \"Hospitality and entertainment\" category\n\nincludes companies providing paid services, such as consulting agencies,\n\nhotels, and restaurants. The \"Online services\" category includes platforms\n\nwhere users can fulfill their needs online, such as ticket and hotel aggrega\ntor websites, blogs, social networks, chat platforms and other social media\n\nresources, video sharing platforms, and online games. Large-scale cyber\nattacks affecting more than one industry (most often, malware outbreaks)\n\nhave been placed in the \"Multiple industries\" category.\n\nIn our view, the majority of cyberattacks are not made public due to repu\ntational risks. The result is that even organizations that investigate incidents\n\nand analyze activity by hacker groups are unable to perform a precise count.\n\nThis research is conducted in order to draw the attention of companies and\n\n\n-----\n\nordinary individuals who care about the state of information security to the\n\nkey motives and methods of cyberattacks, as well as to highlight the main\n\ntrends in the changing cyberthreat landscape.\n\n#### Group profiles\n\nAPT-C-35 (Donot, SectorE02), active since 2016, attacks organizations in\n\nSouth Asia: Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and\n\ncountries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The attackers take the\n\nguise of governmental institutions, military entities, and telecom companies.\n\nBronze Union, also known as TG-3390, LuckyMouse, APT27, or Emissary\n\nPanda, has been involved in cyberespionage attacks since 2010. To gain\n\na foothold on networks, the group often uses watering hole attacks: they\n\ntarget the websites frequented by targeted users and place malware on\n\nthe websites in order to automatically infect visitors' computers. Currently\n\nthe group targets governmental entities and companies involved in indus\ntry, military manufacturing, energy, aerospace, and other high-tech fields\n\naround the world.\n\nCobalt has been known since 2016 for its attacks on financial institutions.\n\nThe group started off by stealing from banks in CIS countries. Since 2017,\n\nit has expanded its range of targets to include banks in Eastern Europe\n\nand Southeast Asia. The group was named after Cobalt Strike, the pene\ntration testing software used by the group to develop attacks within target\n\nnetworks. Its primary method of breaching corporate networks is phishing\n\nmessages with malicious files in various formats: executable files, Office\n\ndocuments with macros or exploits, LNK files, and passworded archives\n\ncontaining executable files.\n\nCobalt Dickens first caught attention in 2017. In 2019, the group attacked at\n\nleast 380 post-secondary educational institutions in over 30 countries in or\nder to obtain intellectual property. University faculty and students received\n\nphishing messages claiming to come from libraries. The messages pointed\n\nto phishing pages, where users were prompted to enter their credentials,\n\nwhich were then used by the attackers to access research of interest.\n\neGobbler, known since early 2019, exploited Chrome vulnerability CVE\n2019-5840 to show malicious advertising to users of iOS mobile devices. In\n\nthe second half of 2019, the group increased its reach to all WebKit brows\ners, including desktop versions, running on Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n\nFrom August 1 to September 23, the group was able to show around 1.16 bil\nlion impressions to potential victims, in the hope of drawing them to fraud\nulent and phishing-related sites.\n\nGamaredon has been active since 2013. The attackers focus exclusively\n\non Ukrainian governmental entities: their C2 servers perform filtering by\n\ngeographic region. In their attacks, the group uses a chain of scripts to\n\ndownload the Ultra VNC remote management utility to the victim's com\nputer. They use a self-developed framework named Pteranodon for full\nfledged management of infected hosts. With it, the attackers can collect\n\ninformation about the system and users, steal passwords, run scripts and\n\ncommands, and exfiltrate information to C2 servers.\n\nKONNI has been active since at least 2014. The group's name comes from\n\nthe malware named KONNI, which it used in its attacks. The malware can\n\n\n-----\n\nsteal files containing sensitive information, intercept and save passwords\n\nentered by users, take screenshots, and run commands on infected com\nputers. The main objective of the group is espionage and access to data.\n\nThe history of RTM dates back to 2016. The group attempts to access cor\nporate bank accounts and steal funds. They use phishing messages to ob\ntain access to corporate networks. Since the very start, the group has used\n\na consistent format in such messages. Positive Technologies data indicates\n\nthat in 2018 alone, the group carried out 59 mailings, the recipients of which\n\nincluded financial institutions. In 2019, the group moved to use of the Bitcoin\n\nblockchain. Most targets are financial institutions, although cases have also\n\nincluded industry, government, and IT-related organizations. In addition,\n\nthe group has used .bit domains for C2. The .bit zone is powered by the\n\nNamecoin blockchain, which acts as a censor-proof and confiscation-re\nsistant alternative to traditional DNS registrars. Experts at the PT Expert\n\nSecurity Center were able to use the blockchain architecture to devise an\n\nalgorithm for monitoring registration of new domains by RTM and changes\n\nin their IP addresses. This enabled warning financial institutions and the se\ncurity community of new C2 servers in a matter of minutes (or sometimes\n\neven before) they entered use by the attackers.\n\nTA505 has operated since 2014. The group's targets include major financial,\n\nmanufacturing, transportation, and governmental organizations in Canada,\n\nSouth Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States, and dozens of other\n\ncountries. Phishing messages are the group's main method for penetrating\n\ntarget networks. With each new wave of attacks, the group has made quali\ntative changes to its toolkit and advanced to more sophisticated techniques\n\nfor maintaining stealth. Since 2014, the group's arsenal has included the\n\n[Dridex banking trojan, Neutrino botnet, and several families of ransomware,](http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2019/08/finding-neutrino.html)\n\nincluding Locky, Jaf, and GlobeImposter. Since spring 2018 the group has\n\nused the FlawedAmmyy remote access trojan, and since late 2018, the new\n\nServHelper backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout\nPositive Technologies\n\n\nPositive Technologies is a leading global provider of enterprise security solutions for vulnerability and compliance management, incident\nand threat analysis, and application protection.
