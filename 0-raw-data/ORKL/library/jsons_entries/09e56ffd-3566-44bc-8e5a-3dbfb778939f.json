    "plain_text": "# North Korean H0lyGh0st Ransomware Has Ties to Global Geopolitics\n\n**[blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/08/h0lygh0st-ransomware](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/08/h0lygh0st-ransomware)**\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThreat actors in North Korea claim to be on a holy mission to help the poor — and increase\nsecurity awareness — by attacking organizations with ransomware and demanding\npayment for a decryptor.\n\nCalling itself “H0lyGh0st,” it's quite possible that this threat actor has stronger ties to global\ngeopolitical activity than initially meets the eye.\n\nThe ransomware in question – also dubbed “H0lyGh0st” – has been taking victim’s\nmachines and files hostage since June 2021. Several variants of H0lyGh0st have been\ndeveloped in that time, with each iteration becoming more functional and increasingly\ninsidious.\n\n### Operating System\n\n\n-----\n\n### Risk & Impact\n\n H0lyGh0st’s PLUTONIUM Connection\n\n[The H0lyGh0st threat actor, first tracked by Microsoft using the name “DEV-0530,” is](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/07/14/north-korean-threat-actor-targets-small-and-midsize-businesses-with-h0lygh0st-ransomware/)\nbelieved to have ties to the North Korean group PLUTONIUM, which has been active since\n2014. Both H0lyGh0st and PLUTONIUM use the same infrastructure, as well as custom\nmalware controllers with similar names. And most notably, H0lyGh0st has been observed\ncommunicating with known PLUTONIUM email accounts.\n\n[PLUTONIUM is commonly considered to be a subgroup operating under the Lazarus](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2019/10/mobile-malware-and-apt-espionage-prolific-pervasive-and-cross-platform)\numbrella. Lazarus is a threat actor group apparently sanctioned by the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea’s (DPRK) Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).\n\n### Malware Groups’ Mysterious Motivations\n\nWhile the links between these groups are clear, the goals of these actors are regrettably\nless so. With the relatively small amount of information that normally comes out of the\nDPRK, and the highly contentious global political atmosphere that comes along with any\nstate-sponsored espionage, it’s difficult to discern a clear picture of H0lyGh0st’s motivation.\n\nIt would be natural to assume that H0lyGh0st is another RGB-approved effort. This would\nhardly set any precedents, as DPRK has long been suspected of launching financially\nmotivated attacks. With increased sanctions on the reclusive country in recent years, global\neconomic pressures could be expected to drive the North Korean government to seek\nadditional revenue through illicit means. However, this same reasoning could also be used\nto support the argument that H0lyGh0st is driven by the threat group’s desire to increase its\nown personal wealth.\n\nAs both H0lyGh0st and PLUTONIUM likely originate in the DPRK, the commonalities\nbetween the groups could simply be due to information exchange between two black hat\ngroups. Their actions might not necessarily be sanctioned by the North Korean government.\n\n\n-----\n\nA look at the H0lyGh0st website (shown in Figure 1 below) seems intent on giving the\nimpression that they are an “ethical hacking” group of sorts. The words paint a picture of a\n“Robin Hood” style code of morals, along with claims that the group is “increasing security\nawareness.” (How noble! “Free” security testing, for the low, low cost of a few bitcoins —\nand your company’s reputation!) An angelic dove beside the logo completes this pious\nimage.\n\n_Figure 1 – The H0lyGh0st website landing page_\n\nWhile the landing page boasts that the group is helping the poor by taking from the rich, its\nattack pattern tells a different story. The actors behind H0lyGh0st have been using\nransomware to compromise machines from a wide range of businesses, including small and\nmedium-sized organizations that are likely to be running on shoestring budgets.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce on a victim s machine, the H0lyGh0st ransomware first exfiltrates a copy of all files\nprior to encryption. And as one would expect, next comes the demand for ransom. If the\nvictim does not comply and pay up, the threat actor then threatens to publish all of the\nexfiltrated files online. (So much for nobility of purpose!)\n\nAlthough it has not yet been confirmed exactly how victims’ machines are infected, there is\nsome suspicion that the threat group has used the DotCMS remote code execution\n[vulnerability (CVE-2022-26352), or a similar exploit to gain access to targets before](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26352)\ndropping the payload for execution.\n\n### H0lyGh0st’s SiennaPurple Ransomware\n\nThe H0lyGh0st ransomware variants are grouped into two different families, based on code\nsimilarity and other factors. The first family is known as SiennaPurple and has just one\nvariant, “BTLC_C.exe.”\n\nFirst appearing on victim machines around June 2021, one major distinguishing\ncharacteristic of this variant is that it is written in C++. The most rudimentary of all\nH0lyGh0st variants, this file can’t be opened without admin permissions. A quick pop-up\nrequesting permission in broken English (shown in Figure 2) is a tip-off to a potential victim\nthat they are being asked to assist the threat actor in compromising their own device.\n\n_Figure 2 – BTLC_C.exe pop up requesting admin privileges_\n\nIf given admin permission, H0lyGh0st begins to de-obfuscate strings hidden within itself,\nuntil the IP address 193[.]56[.]29[.]123 is revealed. This is an address we will see again,\nalong with other common command-and-control (C2) infrastructure shared between\ndifferent variants.\n\n### SiennaBlue Ransomware Family\n\nThe other H0lyGh0st variants are grouped into the SiennaBlue family. These variants, all\n[written in the somewhat obscure programming language Go, began appearing in October](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/old-dogs-new-tricks-attackers-adopt-exotic-programming-languages)\n2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile each iteration of these variants was imbued with some new functionality, they all\noperate in a similar fashion. SiennaBlue’s first variant, “HolyRS.exe,” can be seen opening\na command window and the system file “Net.exe” upon execution. In the command window,\nwe can see an attempt to connect to the address 193[.]56[.]29[.]123:8888 via TCP – the\nsame address revealed in the SiennaPurple ransomware.\n\nIf the malware is unable to reach the ServerBaseUrl, it then tries its intranet method. By\nlooking at the command run from Net.exe (shown in Figures 3 and 4), we can see the\nintranet URL 10[.]10[.]3[.]43, as well as the username “adm-karsair.”\n\n_Figures 3 and 4 – C2 information for HolyRS.exe_\n\nOnce the connection is made, the victim’s files are all copied over the network before being\nencrypted on their device. After encryption, all files will have been renamed to the Base64encoded versions of their original names and given the extension “.h0lyenc.”\n\n\n-----\n\nAs is standard with ransomware, there will also be an html file on the device, in this case\nnamed “FOR_DECRYPT.html.” Opening this file will display the ransom note shown in\nFigure 5, declaring that an email must be sent to H0lyGh0st@mail2tor[.]com to negotiate\npayment for decryption. Included with these instructions are vague threats directed against\nthose who might be inclined to try other means of remediation instead of paying the\nransom.\n\n_Figure 5 – Ransom note contained in FOR_DECRYPT.html_\n\nThe latest variant of SiennaBlue ransomware, “BTLC.exe,” first appeared in April 2022.\nWhile similar in nature to its previous variants, it has updated encryption functionality, as\nwell as a method for achieving persistence. There also appear to be some differences in C2\ninformation from previous variants.\n\nWhen executed, BTLC.exe pops open a command window similar to the one seen in Figure\n6. And if it fails to reach the ServerBaseUrl, it also switches to the intranet method.\nHowever, as shown in the command window, the desired IP address is now\n192[.]168[.]168[.]5, the username is “atrismsp,” and the password is ”banker!@12.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – Command window for BTLC.exe with C2 information_\n\nNot long after achieving a successful intranet connection, commands begin flying by on the\nwindow (as shown in Figure 7), displaying each file being copied, encrypted, and\nsubsequently renamed. As its most significant upgrade, BTLC.exe also creates a scheduled\ntask (lockertask) to achieve persistence on the infected system.\n\n_Figure 7 – Encryption in progress_\n\nAfter encryption is complete, the same HTML file is dropped, providing the victim with a\nransom note. The note for BTLC.exe is roughly the same as in its previous variant,\nincluding a wide variety of threats regarding failure to pay, and a link proving that the threat\nactor now has copies of the victim’s files.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother major difference is the email address provided for the victim to reach the threat\ngroup. Rather than the H0lyGh0st@mail2tor[.]com address used in the HolyRS.exe\nexample, this ransom message asks for the victim to contact\nH0lyGh0st0228@outlook[.]com.\n\n### Cybercrime Costs More Than Money\n\nThe ransoms demanded by the threat group range from 1.2 to 5 BTC (between about\n$29,000 and $120,000 USD, at the time of writing this post). In some cases, the threat\nactors were willing to negotiate with victims to lower their demands to a fraction of the\noriginal asking price.\n\nDealing with a H0lyGh0st ransomware infection can be costly in more ways than just\nfinancial. Ransomware can cause significant destruction of data and business/reputational\ndisruption, regardless of whether the ransom is paid.\n\n### Who is Affected?\n\nAt this time, known victims affected have included schools, banks, and other small to\nmidsized businesses.\n\n### Mitigation Tips\n\nEnsure you stay up to date with all software security updates from Microsoft to patch\nvulnerabilities to exploits such as CVE-2022-26352.\nMonitor accounts for unusual and unauthorized access that falls outside of the\n[baseline (MITRE D3FEND techniques D3-AZET,](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:AuthorizationEventThresholding/) [D3-LAM).](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:LocalAccountMonitoring)\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\n-----\n\n99fc54786a72f32fd44c7391c2171ca31e72ca52725c68e2dde94d04c286fccd –\n**BTLC_C.exe**\n\nf8fc2445a9814ca8cf48a979bff7f182d6538f4d1ff438cf259268e8b4b76f86 – HolyRS.exe\n\nbea866b327a2dc2aa104b7ad7307008919c06620771ec3715a059e675d9f40af –\n**BTLC.exe**\n\nH0lyGh0st@mail2tor[.]com – Ransom email for HolyRS.exe\n\n193[.]56[.]29[.]123 – C2 IP Address for BTLC_C.exe and HolyRS.exe\n\n10[.]10[.]3[.]43 – Intranet URL for HolyRS.exe\n\nH0lyGh0st0228@outlook[.]com – Ransom email for BTLC.exe\n\n192[.]168[.]168[.]5 – Intranet URL for BTLC.exe\n\n### BlackBerry Assistance\n\nIf you’re battling this malware or a similar threat, you’ve come to the right place, regardless\nof your existing BlackBerry relationship.\n\n[The BlackBerry Incident Response team is made up of world-class consultants dedicated to](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/services/incident-response)\nhandling response and containment services for a wide range of incidents, including\nransomware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) cases.\n\nWe have a global consulting team standing by to assist you, providing around-the-clock\nsupport where required, as well as local assistance.
