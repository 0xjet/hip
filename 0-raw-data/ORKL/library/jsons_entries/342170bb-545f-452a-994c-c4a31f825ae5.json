We could not trace the IP addresses. Which means, we hit the end of the road.\nWhatever happened on the Bitcoin blockchain was visible and that’s why we were able to get\nreasonably far. But with Monero blockchain, that was the point where the investigation has\nended. So this is a classical example of one of several cases we had where the suspect\ndecided to move funds from Bitcoin or Ethereum to Monero,\" Europol's Jerek Jakubcek said\nin [a webinar.](https://www.bitchute.com/video/PWXU7D4VV0lB/)\n\nLast month, the ransomware operators behind the Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware posted to a\nhacker and malware forum that they are starting to accept the Monero cryptocurrency to\nmake it harder for law enforcement to trace them.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis principle has led to allegations that Monero could be used for drug trafficking, the\ndissemination of child pornography and more. In this regard, Europol in 2017 expressed\nconcern about the growing popularity of Monero. In 2020, Europol made an official statement\n\n- Monero is impossible to track.\n\nDue to CryptoNote and the obfuscation added to the protocol, passive mixing is provided: all\ntransactions in the system are anonymous, and all participants in the system can use\nplausible denial in case of capture.\n\nThe combination of an anonymous browser Tor and Monero can quite successfully make a\nperson’s financial activity completely invisible to the police and government agencies. We are\nextremely worried about the anonymity and security of our adverts, so we began a “forced”\ntransition from the BTC to Monero.\"\n\nThe operators go on to say that they will eventually remove bitcoins as a payment option and\nthat victims need to start to learn more about Monero and how to acquire it.\n\n\"In this regard, we inform you that after a while the BTC will be removed as a payment\nmethod. Victims need to begin to understand the new cryptocurrency, as well as other\ninterested parties who work with us,\" the threat actors warned.\n\n## Tor ransom payment site uses Monero by default\n\nOn the Sodinokibi Tor payment site, the ransomware operators have already started to move\naway from bitcoin by making Monero the default payment currency.\n\nIf a victim wants to use bitcoin to make a ransom payment, the amount is increased by 10%.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tor payment site accepting Monero**\nThe ransomware operators are also offering \"partners\" who help victims pay the ransom a\ndiscount that will make them \"pleasantly surprised\".\n\n\"Companies that assist our victims in acquiring the decryptor will be pleasantly surprised by\nthe% discount on the amount of the ransom. In order to start working with us, it is enough to\nwrite in a chat and introduce yourself as a company of this type of activity. Our collaboration\nis completely anonymous. We do not disclose the data of our partners,\" the ransomware\noperators offered.\n\nMany of these \"data recovery\" companies add a significant surcharge to victims they help,\nand with this additional discount, they stand to make a much larger profit by helping\nSodinokibi switch to Monero.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[REvil's TOR sites come alive to redirect to new ransomware operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revils-tor-sites-come-alive-to-redirect-to-new-ransomware-operation/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
