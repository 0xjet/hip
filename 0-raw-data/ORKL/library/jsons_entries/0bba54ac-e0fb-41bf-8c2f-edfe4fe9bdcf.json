The report is declassified as TLP: WHITE in the_**\n**_interest of public awareness._**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Our investigative intelligence work at AdvIntel is primarily directed at top-tier cybercriminal_\n_groups. We perceive cybercrime as a constantly-maturing community from which its most_\n_skilled actors merge together to form elite collectives, capable of taking down GDP-size_\n_infrastructures and extorting tens of millions of dollars, while the less gifted are left to gossip_\n_on darknet forums._\n\n_In past years, we’ve established visibility into even the most advanced cyber gangs and_\n_syndicates, but within this selective world, there has been one group that has been_\n_especially outstanding—TrickBot._\n\n_AdvIntel’s TrickBot card, from 2020_\n\n**TrickBot: Origins**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdvIntel has been closely following TrickBot since it was primarily a banking trojan designed\nto steal personal financial data. By 2019, it had evolved into the most prolific tool of\ninformation theft.\n\nTrickBot relies on a modular system. This means that its separate modules can be utilized for\n[different purposes, making it especially flexible malware. For instance, in July 2020, TrickBot](https://www.advintel.io/post/trickbot-group-launches-test-module-alerting-on-fraud-activity)\ntest piloted a mysterious module known as grabber.dll linked to the arrest of Vladimir\n_Dunaev, identified by AdvIntel earlier. The module version was meant for browser theft and_\naffected Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge as well as\n_browser cookies._\n\n_A sample for AdvIntel TrickBot monitoring - Fall 2020_\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Future of Cybercrime**\n\nIn October 2021, TrickBot even developed a function designed to inspect the UEFI/BIOS\nfirmware of its targets, in order to survive any system re-imagining efforts during the recovery\nphase of a Ryuk (Conti) ransomware event, further allowing adversaries to semi-permanently\nbrick an affected device. The installation framework of TrickBot’s notorious AchorDNS\nmalware has also been used by some of the most notorious (specifically Russian and North\nKorean) threat actors to target healthcare, finance, telecoms, education, and critical\ninfrastructure.\n\n_By 2019, TrickBot possessed a highly developed organizational network, with operations in_\n_all avenues of cybercrime._\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the most salient and worrisome prediction for TrickBot was its role as the most\ndangerous tool in ransomware’s future arsenal. The group’s elite division, called Overdose,\nmanaged the TrickBot campaigns that resulted in the creation of Conti and Ryuk\nransomware. The group has made at least $200 million USD with one extreme case\nextorting ~$34 million USD from a single victim and has perpetrated a spate of attacks on\n[numerous healthcare organizations, including Universal Health Services (UHS) via](https://www.hipaajournal.com/universal-health-services-ransomware-attack-cost-67-million-in-2020/)\n[BazarBackdoor to Ryuk ransomware (the attack was estimated for an account for $67 Million](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/universal-health-services-faces-67-million-loss-after-cyberattack#:~:text=The%20September%202020%20apparent%20ransomware,the%20health%20system's%20U.S.%20facilities.&text=Universal%20Health%20Services%20reported%20an,shutdown%20throughout%20its%20U.S.%20facilities)\nUSD in damages).\n\n_Typical TrickBot-Ransomware Kill Chain. (Source: AdvIntel)_\n\nAdvIntel has been tracking this specialization of TrickBot since its early stages, remaining\nvigilant in monitoring its relationship with Ryuk (now Conti) which became one of the most\ndamaging cybercrime alliances in recent history. After Ryuk’s rebrand and subsequent\nattempt to take down TrickBot in October, we have observed that this partnership in crime\nbegan to change.\n\nNotably, [Alla Witte, a Latvian national who was hired under the alias \"max\" to develop](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization)\nanother ransomware internally called \"Enigma\" or \"Diavol\" for TrickBot backwards\ncompatibility, is to be extradited and arrested by the Department of Justice.\n\n\n-----\n\n**An Offer TrickBot Couldn t Refuse**\n\nIn 2022, Conti has expanded to the point that they now fit the definition of a crime syndicate,\nhitting many key hallmarks such as A) the unification of many highly skilled and proficient\n_members of the same craft with little autonomy (in contrast to other RaaS groups) and B) the_\n_organization’s clear end-goal to monopolize the market. Currently, only EvilCorp has earned_\nthis title in the ransomware community.\n\nIts relationship with TrickBot was one of the primary reasons for the rapid rise of Conti,\npossibly even for its survival. The Emotet-TrickBot-Ryuk supply chain was extremely\nresilient. And with a stable and high-quality supply of accesses coming from a single\norganized source, Conti was able to maintain its image without any major structural changes.\nWhen the rest of the ransomware gangs were massively hiring random affiliates and\ndelegating them to breach corporate networks, Conti was working in a trust-based, teambased manner. And when said random affiliates began to randomly hack Western\ninfrastructure and randomly blackmail Western leaders, calling the wrath of the Russian\nsecurity apparatus on their heads, Conti merely kept a clear code of conduct and continued\noperations as normal.\n\nAs its competitors began going down one-by-one, either hit by the sudden crackdown of\nRussia’s government or simply incapable of breaching enough networks to survive, Conti\nprospered. Suddenly TrickBot, formally Conti’s partner and equal, was turning into its\nsubsidiary. At the same time, Conti turned into the sole end-user of TrickBot’s botnet product.\nBy the end of 2021, Conti had essentially acquired TrickBot, with multiple elite developers\nand managers joining the ransomware cosa nostra.\n\n**BazarBackdoor’s Kiss of Death**\n\nAt this point, AdvIntel’s adversarial visibility can clearly confirm that TrickBot is still\noperational, however, the botnet is reaching its limits. According to our sensitive source\nintelligence, the availability of TrickBot IOCs has made it highly detectable, and Conti is no\nlonger using it.\n\n\n-----\n\nConti has already hired TrickBot s top members, and can now invest in newer and better\n[products. TakeBazarBackdoor - TrickBot group’s newer, stealthier replacement malware that](https://www.advintel.io/post/front-door-into-bazarbackdoor-stealthy-cybercrime-weapon)\nis now being leveraged at high-value targets. BazarBackdoor was formerly a part of\nTrickbot’s toolkit arsenal but has now become its own fully autonomous tool.\n\nMoreover, the Conti syndicate is powerful enough to have even summoned Emotet from the\ndead, not to mention QBot and IcedID, with more sophisticated email campaigns dropping\n_Cobalt Strike._\n\n**Leaving the “Backdoor” Open for a Sequel**\n\nIn name, at least, this means that TrickBot’s four-year saga is now coming to a close—the\nliaison that has defined the cybercrime domain for years has been reborn into a newer,\npossibly even deadlier form.\n\nHowever, the people who have led TrickBot throughout its long run will not simply disappear.\nAfter being “acquired” by Conti, they are now rich in prospects with the secure ground\nbeneath them, and Conti will always find a way to make use of the available talent.\n\n_In addition to monitoring TrickBot, AdvIntel provides early warning services for all its_\n_alternatives used by the top-ransomware groups, including Emotet, QBot, IcedID, Log4shell_\n_CVE adversarial datasets, and others._\n\n**_To learn more on how to efficiently defend yourself from these precursors, please_**\n**_reach out to us._**\n\n\n-----",
