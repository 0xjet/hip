Well truth is I’m still looking at EK’s\nbut a lot of my sources have dried up and I don’t have the tech and tools to be able to search\nwide and far for them. I took a break and now I’ve decided to just post things that interest me\nand hopefully they will interest you as well. I’m not a reverse engineer so the tech details\nhere are light.\n\nNow onto the main event. I tweeted about a malware called Snatch Loader: Reloaded mid\nNovember. This is a not a new malware but Arbor Networks recently revealed multiple\nchanges within it. I actually received a phishing email in my inbox which I deleted as you do\nbut I kept the URL and decided to Tweet on it after some help from [@James_inthe_box.](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box?lang=en)\n\nI’ve been tracking it since and now I’ve decided to quickly blog on it. I found some interesting\nfiles on the C2 domain and saw some notable changes in the processes.\n\n[Not from EK and no blog, just something different and playing with #procdot](https://twitter.com/hashtag/procdot?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) 😀This is\n[#SnatchLoader Reloaded:](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SnatchLoader?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nVT – [https://t.co/pR7pzkhGkY](https://t.co/pR7pzkhGkY)\n\n[Big Picture – https://t.co/WR0qx3J0aw](https://t.co/WR0qx3J0aw)\n\nFile – [https://t.co/Lpj6BGXHUB](https://t.co/Lpj6BGXHUB) [pic.twitter.com/ctYkqc7jAD](https://t.co/ctYkqc7jAD)\n\n[— 🌃Zerophage🌌 (@Zerophage1337) November 15, 2017](https://twitter.com/Zerophage1337/status/930888020047355904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Background Information:\n\nArticle by Arbor about Snatch Loader: Reloaded\n\n[https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/snatchloader-reloaded/](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/snatchloader-reloaded/)\n\n## Downloads\n\nSnatch Loader: Reloaded – [Snatchloader-10-Dec-2017](https://zerophagemalware.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/snatchloader-120917.zip)\nVirus Total –\n[d38945a93a926169cbe878afa6b292a5b52c570b61dc096725a0ddb8fdd5209e](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d38945a93a926169cbe878afa6b292a5b52c570b61dc096725a0ddb8fdd5209e/analysis/)\n\n## Notable Details:\n\n185.211.246.50 – tryntruiyuk[.]eu:443/css/order.php – Snatch Loader C2\n\n\n-----\n\n## Analysis:\n\nSnatch Loader would have arrived via a phishing email. I do not have one to show you at\nhand but they all contain (so far) a fake “Trusted sender” message like below. The emails\nthemselves are rather convincing and contain addresses, etc.\n\nThis email would contain a link that downloads a ZIP file that contains an LNK (shortcut) that\nactually runs a script in CMD. When ran this leads to a series of events such as in the image\nbelow but bear in mind that is from a sample in early November.\n\nI have found a sample on Virus Total which was last submitted on the 09-Dec-2017. So I ran\nit. Below you can see that it differs somewhat to the sample above. I did not have any\niexplore or control.exe running.\n\n\n-----\n\nI noticed that iexplore.exe was making the C2 calls\n\nThe calls were over HTTPS and I do not currently have a setup that can let me debug it to\nuse HTTP or some way to man in the middle it. You can see the domain though in the DNS\nrequests.\n\nNow I waited some time but it did not seem to load any other malware at least not to my\nknowledge. It has been known to drop Ramnit though and contain a crypto mining (XMR)\nmodule.\n\nInstead I decided to peek around and found some interesting stuff on the C2 domain.\n\nFirst I found some encrypted data at the C2 which I guessed the rest of the URL based on\npast C2’s for Snatch Loader.\n\n\n-----\n\nI did not seek to decrypt this but it looks like it has multiple layers to it.\n\nAfter some digging around I found an “admin” panel.\n\nFinally and most interestingly I found what appears to be data files. Note the date on some of\nthem.\n\n\n-----\n\nClicking on one shows they can probably be streamed and turned into an executable.\n\nI don’t know what these are but they likely files that can be loaded by Snatch Loader. I’m not\nsure what conditions are required for this. Though I presume if connected to the Snatch\nLoader botnet, the operators can then manually load files.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat s all for now. It s clear the malware is still being updated and configured. As it is sent via\nphishing emails that contain a URL, it is likely to bypass systems that can’t sandbox URL’s.\nWatch out for emails that contain a fake “Trusted Sender” message.\n\n\n-----",
