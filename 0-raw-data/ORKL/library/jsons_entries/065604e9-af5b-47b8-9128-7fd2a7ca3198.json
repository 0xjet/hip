This report serves as the\nnext installment, focusing on the relevant activities that we observed during Q1 2018.\n\nThese summaries serve as a representative snapshot of what has been discussed in greater\ndetail in our private reports, in order to highlight the significant events and findings that we\nfeel people should be aware of. For brevity’s sake, we are choosing not to publish indicators\nassociated with the reports highlighted. However, if you would like to learn more about our\nintelligence reports or request more information on a specific report, readers are encouraged\nto contact: [intelreports@kaspersky.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Remarkable new findings\n\n\n-----\n\nWe are always very interested in analyzing new techniques used by existing groups, or in\nfinding new clusters of activity that might lead us to discover new actors. In Q1 2018 we\nobserved a bit of both, which are briefly summarized in this section.\n\nWe would like to start by highlighting all the new exploitation techniques applicable for the\nMeltdown/Spectre vulnerabilities that affect different CPU architectures and vendors. Even\nthough we haven’t seen any of them exploited in the wild so far (only several PoCs) and\nalthough vendors have provided various patches to mitigate them, there is still no real\nsolution. The problem relies on the optimization methods used at the processor’s\narchitecture level. Given that a massive hardware replacement is not a realistic solution,\nMeltdown and Spectre might very well open the door to new infection vectors and\npersistence methods that we will see in the future.\n\nA similar case was the announcement of several flaws for AMD processors. Even when the\nfull technical details were not yet available, AMD confirmed that these flaws could be\nexploited for privilege escalation and persistence once a target has been compromised.\n\nWe also observed an increasing interest from attackers, including sophisticated actors, in\ntargeting routers and networking hardware. Some early examples of such attacks driven by\nadvanced groups include Regin and CloudAtlas. Additionally, the US Government published\nan advisory on unusual reboots in a prominent router brand, which might indicate that these\nspecific devices are being actively targeted.\n\nIn our Slingshot analysis, we described how the campaign was using Mikrotik routers as an\ninfection vector, compromising the routers to later infect the final victim through the very\npeculiar mechanism that Mikrotik used for the remote management of devices. In actual fact,\nwe recognised the interest of some actors in this particular brand when the Chimay-red\nexploit for Mikrotek was mentioned in Wikileak´s Vault7. This same exploit was later reused\nby the Hajime botnet in 2018, showing once again how dangerous leaked exploits can be.\nEven when the vulnerability was fixed by Mikrotik, networking hardware is rarely managed\nproperly from a security perspective. Additionally, Mikrotik reported a zero day vulnerability\n[(CVE-2018-7445) in March 2018.](https://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/mikrotik-routeros-smb-buffer-overflow)\n\nWe believe routers are still an excellent target for attackers, as demonstrated by the\nexamples above, and will continue to be abused in order to get a foothold in the victim´s\ninfrastructure.\n\nOne of the most relevant attacks during this first quarter of 2018 was the Olympic Destroyer\nmalware, affecting several companies related to the Pyeongchang Olympic Games’\norganization and some Olympic facilities. There are different aspects of this attack to\nhighlight, including the fact that attackers compromised companies that were providing\nservices to the games´ organization in order to gain access, continuing the dangerous supply\nchain trend.\n\n\n-----\n\nBesides the technical considerations, one of the more open questions is related to the\ngeneral perception that attackers could have done much more harm than they actually did,\nwhich opened some speculation as to what the real purpose of the attack was.\n\n**_MZ DOS and Rich headers of both files (3c0d740347b0362331c882c2dee96dbf –_**\n**_OlympicDestroyer, 5d0ffbc8389f27b0649696f0ef5b3cfe – Bluenoroff) are exactly the same._**\n\nIn addition, a very relevant aspect is the effort attackers put in to planting several elaborative\nfalse flags, making this attack one of the most difficult we have analyzed in terms of\nattribution.\n\nIn February, we published a report about a previously unknown advanced Android backdoor\nthat we call Skygofree. It seems that the author could be an Italian company selling the\nproduct in a similar way to how Hacking Team did in the past, however we don’t yet have any\nproof of this. Interestingly, shortly after we detected the Android samples of this malware, we\nalso found an early iOS version of the backdoor. In this case, attackers had abused a rogue\nMDM (Mobile Device Management) server in order to install their malware in victims’\ndevices, probably using social engineering techniques to trick them into connecting with the\nrogue MDM.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, we would like to highlight three new actors that we have found, all of them focused in\nthe Asia region:\n\nShaggypanther – A Chinese-speaking cluster of activity targeting government entities,\nmainly in Taiwan and Malaysia, active since 2008 and using hidden encrypted payloads\nin registry keys. We couldn’t relate this to any known actor.\n\nSidewinder – An actor mainly targeting Pakistan military targets, active since at least\n2012. We have low confidence that this malware might be authored by an Indian\ncompany. To spread the malware, they use unique implementations to leverage the\nexploits of known vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2017-11882) and later deploy a\nPowershell payload in the final stages.\n\nCardinalLizard – We are moderately confident that this is a new collection of Chinesespeaking activity targeting businesses, active since 2014. Over the last few years, the\ngroup has shown an interest in the Philippines, Russia, Mongolia and Malaysia, the\nlatter especially prevalent during 2018. The hackers use a custom malware featuring\nsome interesting anti-detection and anti-emulation techniques. The infrastructure used\nalso shows some overlaps with RomaingTiger and previous PlugX campaigns, but this\ncould just be due to infrastructure reuse under the Chinese-speaking umbrella.\n\n## Activity of well-known groups\n\nSome of the most heavily tracked groups, especially those that are Russian-speaking, didn´t\nshow any remarkable activity during the last three months, as far as we know.\n\nWe observed limited activity from Sofacy in distributing Gamefish, updating its Zebrocy\ntoolset and potentially registering new domains that might be used for future campaigns. We\nalso saw the group slowly shift its targeting to Asia during the last months.\n\nIn the case of Turla (Snake, Uroburos), the group was suspected of breaching the German\nGovernmental networks, according to some reports. The breach was originally reported as\nSofacy, but since then no additional technical details or official confirmation have been\nprovided.\n\nThe apparent low activity of these groups – and some others such as The Dukes – could be\nrelated to some kind of internal reorganization, however this is purely speculative.\n\n## Asia – high activity\n\nThe ever-growing APT activity in this part of the World shouldn´t be a surprise, especially\nseeing as the Winter Olympic Games was hosted in South Korea in January 2018. More\nthan 30% of our 27 reports during Q1 were focused on the region.\n\n\n-----\n\nProbably one of the most interesting activities relates to Kimsuky, an actor with a NorthKorean nexus interested in South Korean think tanks and political activities. The actor\nrenewed its arsenal with a completely new framework designed for cyberespionage, which\nwas used in a spear-phishing campaign against South Korean targets, similar to the one\ntargeting [KHNP in 2014. According to McAfee, this activity was related to attacks against](http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/38919.html)\ncompanies involved in the organization of the Pyeongchang Olympic Games, however we\ncannot confirm this.\n\nThe Korean focus continues with our analysis of the Flash Player 0-day vulnerability (CVE2018-4878), deployed by Scarcruft at the end of January and triggered by Microsoft Word\ndocuments distributed through at least one website. This vulnerability was quickly reported\nby the Korean CERT (KN-CERT), which we believe helped to quickly mitigate any\naggressive spreading. At the time of our analysis, we could only detect one victim in South\nAfrica.\n\n_Forgotten PDB path inside the malware used by Scarcruft with CVE-2018-4876_\n\nFurthermore, IronHusky is a Chinese-speaking actor that we first detected in summer 2017.\nIt is very focused on tracking the geopolitical agenda of targets in central Asia with a special\nfocus in Mongolia, which seems to be an unusual target. This actor crafts campaigns for\nupcoming events of interest. In this case, they prepared and launched one right before a\nmeeting with the International Monetary Fund and the Mongolian government at the end of\nJanuary 2018. At the same time, they stopped their previous operations targeting Russian\nmilitary contractors, which speaks volumes about the group’s limitations. In this new\ncampaign, they exploited CVE-2017-11882 to spread common RATs typically used by\nChinese-speaking groups, such as PlugX and PoisonIvy.\n\nThe final remark for this section covers the apparently never-ending greed of BlueNoroff,\nwhich has been moving to new targets among cryptocurrencies companies and expanding\nits operations to target PoS’s. However, we haven´t observed any new remarkable changes\nin the modus operandi of the group.\n\n## Middle East – always under pressure\n\nThere was a remarkable peak in StrongPity’s activity at the beginning of the year, both in\nJanuary and March. For this new wave of attacks, the group used a new version of its\nmalware that we simply call StrongPity2. However, the most remarkable aspect is the use of\n\n\n-----\n\nMiTM techniques at the ISP level to spread the malware, redirecting legitimate downloads to\ntheir artifacts. The group combines this method with registering domains that are similar to\nthe ones used for downloading legitimate software.\n\nStrongPity also distributed FinFisher using the same MiTM method at the ISP level, more\ndetails of which were provided by CitizenLab.\n\nDesert Falcons showed a peak of activity at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018.\nTheir toolset for this new campaign included Android implants that they had previously used\nback in 2014. The group continues to heavily rely on social engineering methods for malware\ndistribution, and use rudimentary artifacts for infecting their victims. In this new wave we\nobserved high-profile victims based mostly in Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon and\nTurkey.\n\nA particularly interesting case we analyzed was the evolution of what we believe to be the\nGaza Team actor. What makes us question whether this is the same actor that we have\ntracked in the past, is the fact that we observed a remarkable boost in the artifacts used by\nthe group. We actually can´t be sure whether the group suddenly developed these new\ntechnical capabilities, or if they had some internal reorganization or acquired improved tools.\nAnother possibility is that the group itself was somehow hacked and a third actor is now\ndistributing their artifacts through them.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAs a summary of what happened during the last 3 months, we have the impression that\nsome well-known actors are rethinking their strategies and reorganizing their teams for future\nattacks. In addition, a whole new wave of attackers are becoming much more active. For all\nthese new attackers we observe different levels of sophistication, but let´s admit that the\nentry barrier for cyberespionage is much lower than it used to be in terms of the availability of\ndifferent tools that can be used for malicious activities. Powershell, for instance, is one of the\nmost common resources used by any of them. In other cases, there seems to be a\nflourishing industry of malware development behind the authorship of the tools that have\nbeen used in several campaigns.\n\nSome of the big stories like Olympic Destroyer teach us what kind of difficulties we will likely\nfind in the future in terms of attribution, while also illustrating how effective supply chain\nattacks still are. Speaking of new infection vectors, some of the CPU vulnerabilities\ndiscovered in the last few months will open new possibilities for attackers; unfortunately there\nis not an easy, universal protection mechanism for all of them. Routing hardware is already\nan infection vector for some actors, which should make us think whether we are following all\nthe best practices in protecting such devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe will continue to track all the APT activity we can find and will regularly highlight the more\ninteresting findings, but if you want to know more please reach out to us at\nintelreports@kasperksy.com.\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[PlugX](https://securelist.com/tag/plugx/)\n[RAT Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/rat-trojan/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities/)\n[Zero-day vulnerabilities](https://securelist.com/tag/zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nAPT Trends report Q1 2018\n\nYour email address will not be published.
