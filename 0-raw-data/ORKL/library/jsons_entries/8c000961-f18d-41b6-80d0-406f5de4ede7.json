I explain this by the fact that the\ndeveloper deliberately made these mistakes, what was the motivation? I can't tell\nyou, I would be glad to understand it myself3 attack on PDAround this time, we\nentered into a partnership with a certain RA, who stated that he had access to PD,\nand he wanted to use our product, I was not against the attack, as time passed the\npolice did not move, I started to put pressure on Ra, who began to change about the\npressure on PD, and began to take the initiative himself, when I realized that the\nperson on that wire is an ordinary link that does not carry any action at all for his\nwords, I wrote to RA and my uncle that I take the project blog and they take the\nsource code, we shook hands, I took the blog and posted Pd there, this RA began to\nshow aggression, except for the aggression, some other actions were not implemented\nPlus, the floor of my Team fell off the same links as RA and the project died without\nme.4. Subnellular cancerThe other day, the project developer released the source code\nof the product, while he mentioned that he has cancer and threw off the wallet for\ndonations, he does not have cancer, I have a reason to think so, there were many\nfactors of not reliable information on his part5. Groove and black meterBut let it be\nan intrigue, I will say only one thing, blackmetter is not a darksad, these people\njust bought the source code of darkside, most likely these are one of the old adverts\nof this affiliate program\n\n```\n\n-----",
