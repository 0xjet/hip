We have detailed FIN11's various\ntactics, techniques and procedures in a report that is available now by signing up\nfor [Mandiant Advantage Free.](https://www.fireeye.com/advantage/)\n\nIn some ways, FIN11 is reminiscent of APT1; they are notable not for their sophistication, but\nfor their sheer volume of activity. There are significant gaps in FIN11’s phishing operations,\nbut when active, the group conducts up to five high-volume campaigns a week. While many\nfinancially motivated threat groups are short lived, FIN11 has been conducting these\nwidespread phishing campaigns since at least 2016. From 2017 through 2018, the threat\ngroup primarily targeted organizations in the financial, retail, and hospitality sectors.\nHowever, in 2019 FIN11’s targeting expanded to include a diverse set of sectors and\ngeographic regions. At this point, it would be difficult to name a client that FIN11 hasn’t\ntargeted.\n\n\n-----\n\nfin11 services\n\n\nMandiant has also responded to numerous FIN11 intrusions, but we’ve only observed the\ngroup successfully monetize access in few instances. This could suggest that the actors cast\na wide net during their phishing operations, then choose which victims to further exploit\nbased on characteristics such as sector, geolocation or perceived security posture. Recently,\nFIN11 has deployed CLOP ransomware and threatened to publish exfiltrated data to\npressure victims into paying ransom demands. The group’s shifting monetization methods—\nfrom point-of-sale (POS) malware in 2018, to ransomware in 2019, and hybrid extortion in\n2020—is part of a larger trend in which criminal actors have increasingly focused on postcompromise ransomware deployment and data theft extortion.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Notably, FIN11 includes a subset of the activity security researchers call TA505, but we do](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta505-dridex-globeimposter)\nnot attribute TA505’s early operations to FIN11 and caution against using the names\ninterchangeably. Attribution of both historic TA505 activity and more recent FIN11 activity is\ncomplicated by the actors’ use of criminal service providers. Like most financially motivated\nactors, FIN11 doesn’t operate in a vacuum. We believe that the group has used services that\nprovide anonymous domain registration, bulletproof hosting, code signing certificates, and\nprivate or semi-private malware. Outsourcing work to these criminal service providers likely\nenables FIN11 to increase the scale and sophistication of their operations.\n\nTo learn more about FIN11’s evolving delivery tactics, use of services, post-compromise\n[TTPs, and monetization methods, register for Mandiant Advantage Free. The full FIN11](https://www.fireeye.com/advantage/)\n[report is also available through our FireEye Intelligence Portal (FIP). Then for even more](https://www.fireeye.com/advantage/threat-intelligence)\n[information, register for our exclusive webinar on Oct. 29 where Mandiant threat intelligence](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/7451/447347)\nexperts will take a deeper dive into FIN11, including its origins, tactics, and potential for\nfuture activity.\n\n\n-----",
