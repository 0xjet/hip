We have notified the FBI of this incident and\nare actively cooperating with them as they conduct their investigation of the incident.\"\n\n## Cyberinsurance companies are a valuable target\n\nThe attack on CNA could have tremendous impact on other companies, especially those\nthat have cyberinsurance policies through the company.\n\nConducting attacks on companies with cyberinsurance policies are often lucrative for\nransomware gangs as the insurance companies may be more likely to pay the ransom\n\n\n-----\n\nThere could be no better way to create a list of insured companies to target than to hack an\ninsurer's network and steal policy information about their customers.\n\nUsing this information, a ransomware operation can create a list of insured companies and\ntheir policy limits. The ransomware operators could then create ransom demands tailored\naround a particular victim's policy coverage.\n\nAt this time, it is not known if the threat actors stole unencrypted files before encrypting\nCNA's devices.\n\nHowever, stealing unencrypted data has become a common tactic used by ransomware\noperations, so it is likely that some data was stolen during the attack.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[CNA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cna/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Evil Corp](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/evil-corp/)\n[Phoenix Cryptolocker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phoenix-cryptolocker/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
