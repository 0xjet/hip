The file was\nsubmitted from South Korea. The OneNote file asks survey participants to fill out a hangul\nword processor(.HWP) document (Personal Information Use Agreement) in order to receive\nrecompense. To do this, the image contains a .hwp file icon and file name disguised as a\ndownload, and the user is encouraged to double-click it. The double-click triggers the\nexecution of a malicious VBS file hidden behind the image, which then downloads additional\nmalware from an external server.\n\nFigure 1. The image is seen when opening OneNote\nWhen the image is moved as shown below, the VBS file icon appears behind it, and the\npreviously known exploitation method of OneNote is applied in the same way. At this time,\nthe same VBS files are arranged in a row, which is to ensure that the VBS file is executed\neven if the victim presses any part of the file.\n\nFigure 2. Malicious VBS scripts behind the image\nWhen the script is executed, the obfuscated code is executed and additional files are\ndownloaded from the address below. No additional downloads were made at the time of\nanalysis. The downloaded HWP file will be stored in the Downloads\npath(%Userprofile%\\Downloads\\personal.hwp), which is presumed to be a normal document\nto appear as if the target downloads the document normally.\n\nFigure 3. Embedded VBS script code\n\nDownload HWP file: hxxp[:]//delps.scienceontheweb[.]net/ital/info/sample.hwp\nDownload malware : hxxp[:]//delps.scienceontheweb[.]net/ital/info/list.php?query=1\n\nIn addition to downloading additional files, access specific registries and change values as\nshown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main => no => 1\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Edge\\IEToEdge => 0\n\nThe Kimsuky group has been distributing malware by sending phishing e-mails containing\nfalse compensation for several years. The image in OneNote discovered this time also deals\nwith the same theme. In addition, the URL that the VBS script requests to download is the\nsame as the address format used when distributing the Babyshark malware, and the hosting\nserver that the Kimsuky group frequently uses is used for the same purpose.\n\nAddress format has been used by the Kimsuky group: hxxp[:]//[URL]/\n\nThis URL format has already been disclosed in the past and has been attributed to the\nKimsuky group.\n\nIn addition, the server that downloads the additional malware resolves to 185.176.43[.]98,\n[which the Kimsuky group has been using continuously.](https://download.ahnlab.com/global/brochure/04.%20ATIP_Threat%20Trend%20Report%20on%20Kimsuky%20Group%202021_20220128.pdf)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe’ve seen a number of recent cases of cybercrime-related malware such as Qakbot,\nRedline Stealer, and AsyncRAT being distributed by attaching malicious OneNote files\nto emails, but this is the first time we’ve seen it utilized by an APT group from North\nKorea.\nHowever, there is a possibility that it is a test stage before full-scale use in that a\nnumber of strings “ were confirmed in the script.\nMicrosoft mentioned on March 10th that they will introduce an option for embedded\nfiles to prevent malware infection due to malicious OneNote files, and it is highly likely\nthat the Kimsuky group will be used as a new distribution method until the introduction.\nIn order to prevent malware infection from malicious OneNote, if a suspicious OneNote\nfile is attached to an e-mail received from outside, care must be taken not to open the\nfile.\n\n## IoC\n\naa756b20170aa0869d6f5d5b5f1b7c37 (OneNote)\nf2a0e92b80928830704a00c91df87644 (VBS)\nhxxp[:]//delps.scienceontheweb[.]net/ital/info/sample.hwp\nhxxp[:]//delps.scienceontheweb[.]net/ital/info/list.php?query=1\n\n\n-----",
