    "plain_text": "# Anthem Breach May Have Started in April 2014\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/anthem-breach-may-have-started-in-april-2014/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/anthem-breach-may-have-started-in-april-2014/)**\n\nAnalysis of open source information on the cybercriminal infrastructure likely used to siphon\n80 million Social Security numbers and other sensitive data from health insurance giant\n**Anthem suggests the attackers may have first gained a foothold in April 2014, nine months**\nbefore the company says it discovered the intrusion.\n\n_The Wall Street Journal reported last week that security experts involved in the ongoing_\nforensics investigation into the breach say the servers and attack tools used in the attack on\nAnthem bear the hallmark of a state-sponsored Chinese cyber espionage group known by a\n[number of names, including “Deep Panda,” “Axiom,”](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/deep-thought-chinese-targeting-national-security-think-tanks/) [Group 72,” and the “Shell_Crew,” to](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/threat-spotlight-group-72)\nname but a few.\n\n[Deep Panda is the name given to this group by security firm CrowdStrike. In November](http://www.crowdstrike.com/)\n2014, Crowdstrike published a snapshot of a graphic showing the malware and malicious\nInternet servers used in what security experts at PriceWaterhouseCoopers dubbed the\n[ScanBox Framework, a suite of tools that have been used to launch a number of cyber](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2014/10/scanbox-framework-whos-affected-and-whos-using-it-1.html)\nespionage attacks.\n\nA Maltego transform published by CrowdStrike. The graphic is intended to illustrate some tools and\nInternet servers thought to be closely tied to a Chinese cyber espionage group that CrowdStrike calls\n\n“Deep Panda.”\n\n\n-----\n\n[Crowdstrike s snapshot (produced with the visualization tool Maltego) lists many of the tools](https://www.paterva.com/)\nthe company has come to associate with activity linked to Deep Panda, including a password\n[stealing Trojan horse program called Derusbi, and an Internet address —](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?name=TROJANSPY:WIN32/DERUSBI.A)\n198[dot]200[dot]45[dot]112.\n\nCrowdStrike’s image curiously redacts the resource tied to that Internet address (note the\nblack box in the image above), but a variety of open source records indicate that this\nparticular address was until very recently the home for a very interesting domain:\n**we11point.com. The third and fourth characters in that domain name are the numeral one,**\n_but it appears that whoever registered the domain was attempting to make it look like_\n_“Wellpoint,” the former name of Anthem before the company changed its corporate name in_\n_late 2014._\n\nWe11point[dot]com was registered on April 21, 2014 to a bulk domain registration service in\nChina. [Eight minutes later, someone changed the site’s registration records to remove any](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/we11point-whoischanges.png)\ntrace of a connection to China.\n\nIntrigued by the fake Wellpoint domains, Rich Barger, chief information officer for Arlington,\nVa. security firm [ThreatConnect Inc., dug deeper into so-called “passive DNS” records —](http://threatconnect.com/)\nhistoric records of the mapping between numeric Internet addresses and domain names.\nThat digging revealed a host of other subdomains tied to the suspicious we11point[dot]com\nsite. In the process, Barger discovered that these subdomains\n_— including myhr.we11point[dot]com, and hrsolutions.we11point[dot]com –mimicked_\n_components of Wellpoint’s actual network as it existed in April 2014._\n\n“We were able to verify that the evil we11point infrastructure is constructed to masquerade\nas legitimate Wellpoint infrastructure,” Barger said.\n\nAnother fishy subdomain that Barger discovered was extcitrix.we11point[dot]com. The\n[“citrix” portion of that domain likely refers to Citrix, a software tool that many large](http://www.citrix.com/go/receiver.html)\ncorporations commonly use to allow employees remote access to internal networks over a\nvirtual private network (VPN).\n\nInterestingly, that extcitrix.we11point[dot]com domain, first put online on April 22, 2014, was\nreferenced in a malware scan from a malicious file that someone uploaded to malware\nscanning service Virustotal.com. According to [the writeup on that malware, it appears to be](https://www.virustotal.com/en-gb/file/8d168092d5601ebbaed24ec3caeef7454c48cf21366cd76560755eb33aff89e9/analysis/)\na backdoor program masquerading as Citrix VPN software. The malware is digitally signed\nwith a certificate issued to an organization called DTOPTOOLZ Co. According to\nCrowdStrike and other security firms, that digital signature is the calling card of the Deep\nPanda Chinese espionage group.\n\nCONNECTIONS TO OTHER VICTIMS?\n\n\n-----\n\n[As noted in a story in HealthITSecurity.com, Anthem has been sharing information about the](http://healthitsecurity.com/2015/02/06/lessons-learned-from-the-anthem-data-breach/)\nattack with the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) and the National Health\n**Information Sharing and Analysis Center (NH-ISAC), industry groups whose mission is**\nto disseminate information about cyber threats to the healthcare industry.\n\nA news alert published by HITRUST last week notes that Anthem has been sharing so-called\n“indicators of compromise” (IOCs) — Internet addresses, malware signatures and other\ninformation associated with the breach. “It was quickly determined that the IOCs were not\nfound by other organizations across the industry and this attack was targeted a specific\norganization,” HITRUST wrote in its alert. “Upon further investigation and analysis it is\nbelieved to be a targeted advanced persistent threat (APT) actor. With that information,\nHITRUST determined it was not necessary to issue a broad industry alert.”\n\nAn alert released by the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) about the APT attack on\n\nAnthem.\n\nBut a variety of data points suggest that the same infrastructure used to attack Anthem may\nhave been leveraged against a Reston, Va.-based information technology firm that primarily\nserves the Department of Defense.\n\nA [writeup on a piece of malware that Symantec calls “Mivast” was produced on Feb. 6, 2015.](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/earthlink_writeup.jsp?docid=2015-020623-0740-99)\nIt describes a backdoor Trojan that Symantec says may call out to one of a half-dozen\ndomains, including the aforementioned extcitrix.we11point[dot]com domain and another —\n\n\n-----\n\n**sharepoint-vaeit.com. Other domains on the same server include ssl-vaeit.com, and wiki-**\n**vaeit.com. Once again, it appears that we have a malware sample calling home to a domain**\n[designed to mimic the internal network of an organization — most likely VAE Inc. (whose](http://vaeit.com/customers/government/)\nlegitimate domain is vaeit.com).\n\nBarger and his team at ThreatConnect discovered that the sharepoint-vaeit.com domain also\nwas tied to a malware sample made to look like it was VPN software made by networking\ngiant Juniper. That malware was created in May 2014, and was also signed with the\nDTOPTOOLZ Co. digital certificate that CrowdStrike has tied to Deep Panda.\n\nIn response to an inquiry from KrebsOnSecurity, VAE said it detected a targeted phishing\nattack in May 2014 that used malware which phoned home to those domains, but the\ncompany said it was not aware of any successful compromise of its users.\n\nIn any case, the Symantec writeup on Mivast also says the malware tries to contact the\nInternet address 192[dot]199[dot]254[dot]126, which resolved to just one Web domain:\n**topsec2014[dot]com. That domain was registered on May 6, 2014 to a bulk domain reseller**\nwho immediately changed the registration records and assigned the domain to the email\naddress topsec_2014@163.com. That address appears to be the personal email of one\n[Song Yubo, a professor with the](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/song-yubo/2b/285/43b?trk=pub-pbmap) [Information Security Research Center at the Southeast](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=http://infosec.seu.edu.cn/more.php%3Fsort%3D02%26flag%3Dpost%26tid%3D377&prev=search)\nUniversity in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.\n\nYubo and his university were named in a March 2012 report, “Occupying the Information\nHigh Ground: Chinese Capabilities for Computer Network Operations and Cyber Espionage,”\n(PDF) produced by U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. for the U.S.-China\n\n\n-----\n\n**Economic and Security Review Commission. According to the report, Yubo s center is**\none of a handful of civilian universities in China that receive funding from the Chinese\ngovernment to conduct sensitive research and development with information security and\ninformation warfare applications.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nOf course, it could well be that this is all a strange coincidence, and/or that the basic\ninformation on Deep Panda is flawed. But that seems unlikely given the number of\nconnections and patterns emerging in just this small data set.\n\nIt’s remarkable that the security industry so seldom learns from past mistakes. For example,\none of the more confounding and long-running problems in the field of malware detection\nand prevention is the proliferation of varying names for the same threat. We’re seeing this\nonce again with the nicknames assigned to various cyberespionage groups (see the second\nparagraph of this story for examples).\n\nIt’s also incredible that so many companies could see the outlines of a threat against such a\nhuge target, and that it took until just this past week for the target to become aware of it. For\n[its part, ThreatConnect tweeted about its findings back in November 2014, and shared the](https://twitter.com/ThreatConnect/status/533327104742809600)\ninformation out to its user base.\n\nCrowdStrike declined to confirm whether the resource blanked out in the above pictured\ngraphic from November 2014 was in fact we11point[dot]com.\n\n“What I can tell you is that this domain is a Deep Panda domain, and that we always try to\nalert victims whenever we discover them,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of\nCrowdStrike.\n\nAlso, it’s myopic for an industry information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) to decide not\nto share indicators of compromise with other industry ISACs, let alone its own members. This\nshould not be a siloed effort. Somehow, we need to figure out a better — more timely way —\nto share threat intelligence and information across industries.\n\n[Perhaps the answer is crowdsourcing threat intelligence, or maybe it’s something we haven’t](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2015/02/05/crowdsourcing-americas-cybersecurity-is-an-idea-so-crazy-it-might-just-work/)\nthought of yet. But one thing is clear: there is a yawning gap between the time it takes for an\nadversary to compromise a target and the length of time that typically passes before the\nvictim figures out they’ve been had.\n\nThe most staggering and telling statistic included in Verizon’s 2014 Data Breach\nInvestigations Report (well worth a read) is the graphic showing the difference between the\n“time to compromise” and the “time to discovery.” TL;DR: That gap is not improving, but\ninstead is widening.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen again, maybe this breach at Anthem isn’t as bad as it seems. After all, if the above data\nand pundits are to be believed, the attackers were likely looking for a needle in a haystack —\nsearching for data on a few individuals that might give Chinese spies a way to better siphon\nmilitary technology or infiltrate some U.S. defense program.\n\nPerhaps, as Barger wryly observed, the Anthem breach was little more than the product of a\nclass assignment — albeit an expensive and aggravating one for Anthem and its 80 million\naffected members. In May 2014, the aforementioned Southeast University Professor Song\n[Yubo posted a “Talent Cup” tournament challenge to his information security students.](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=http://infosec.seu.edu.cn/more.php%3Fsort%3D02%26flag%3Dpost%26tid%3D377&prev=search)\n\n[“Just as the OSS [Office of Strategic Services] and CIA used professors to recruit spies, it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services)\ncould be that this was all just a class project,” Barger mused.\n\n\n-----",
