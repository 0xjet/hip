Such a process does not start in a void, but rather requires understanding tendencies and patterns\nassociated with adversary infrastructure creation and management. This is especially effective when viewing individual\n[network observables – or indicators – as natural composite objects, items that accrue multiple sub-observations relating to](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects/)\n[the given object’s creation, use, and potentially even intention.](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/extrapolating-adversary-intent-through-infrastructure/)\n\n[One historical example of such activity is ThreatConnect’s analysis of (then) long-running infrastructure tendencies linked to](https://threatconnect.com/blog/using-fancy-bear-ssl-certificate-information-to-identify-their-infrastructure/)\n[APT28, also known as](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007/) [FancyBear, but](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-fancy-bear/) [associated with Russian Military Intelligence (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/13/2002476465/-1/-1/0/CSA_DROVORUB_RUSSIAN_GRU_MALWARE_AUG_2020.PDF)\n(GTsSS). ThreatConnect’s reporting publicized patterns used by intelligence professionals for several years prior, using a\ncombination of x509 certificate information, domain registration tendencies, and domain hosting patterns to identify new\nAPT28 infrastructure with high confidence as it was created. Unfortunately, the adversary largely migrated away from these\npatterns shortly after the blog’s publication, but the overall idea remains a solid mechanism to systematize external threat\n[hunting as well as implementing an intelligence-driven pivoting process.](https://pylos.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pivoting.pdf)\n\nThere are multiple ways to approach domain hunting and tracking. One reasonable mechanism is to utilize internal visibility of\n[newly-observed network objects or external feeds such as DomainTools to look for infrastructure objects fitting certain](https://www.domaintools.com/products/platform/iris-investigate/)\npatterns based on domain sub-characteristics. Using this methodology, the following domain came to light on 22 November\n2022:\n```\nmsn-imap[.]com\n\n```\n[Even at first glance, this appears suspicious given naming conventions, spoofing a combination of MSN and](https://www.msn.com/en-us) [IMAP services.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-are-imap-and-pop-ca2c5799-49f9-4079-aefe-ddca85d5b1c9)\nFurther research, in this case using DomainTools Iris Investigate, shows further details that call this item out as likely\nmalicious:\n\n\n-----\n\nDomainTools Iris Screenshot\n\n\n-----\n\nDomainTools Iris ScreenShot\nWe can spot several items that look suspicious here – anonymized registration, dedicated hosting (on IP address\n92.38.135.213), suspicious authoritative name server use – but unfortunately there’s very little to pivot on to learn more about\nthis item (or identify related infrastructure) using just domain information.\n\n[We can dig further by looking at the hosting address. In this case, using Censys Search we can profile this further:](https://search.censys.io/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCensys Search Screenshot\n\n\n-----\n\nCensys Search Screenshot\n\n\n-----\n\nCensys Search Screenshot\nNow we’re starting to get more details on how this object might be used by an adversary, as well as other observables that\ncan be used for searching, hunting, and follow-on pivoting. Among other items, we’ve learned the following:\n\nThe adversary’s infrastructure characteristics:\n\nUbuntu Linux\nPostfix SMTP server\nApache HTTP/HTTPS server\nUse of Let’s Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates\nJA3S hashes for various TLS services\nAdditional potential indicators, such as the domain onkrdot[.]info associated with the SMTP server\n\n\n-----\n\nOne item that immediately stands out is the SMTP server. Given our original domain s email theme, we can hypothesize that\nthis server may be utilized for future phishing infrastructure or email relay activity. However, we also have HTTP/HTTPS\nservers that appear active – but in a strange way. As seen in the above screenshot, an HTTPS request returns a status code\nof 200 (success), but the page content (based on the HTML title) says “404 Not Found.” What is going on here?\n\n[To simplify our research, we can utilize another service – urlscan.io – to handle our interactions for us. And this serves up](https://urlscan.io/)\nsomething strange:\n\nWebsite Capture from URLScan\nThis may seem unhelpful, but we’ve identified an interesting mismatch. Examination of the server through application\n[fingerprinting indicates we are interacting with an Apache webserver, while the server itself is displaying a custom webpage](https://httpd.apache.org/)\nmodeled off of (but not exactly mirroring) an [Ngnix webserver 404 landing page. While not a sign of obvious maliciousness,](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/)\nthis mismatch and customization provides an interesting foothold for further exploration. One easy follow-on item lies within\nurlscan itself, where we can look for instances of similar landing pages based on the content hash of the delivered page –\n9b43f670273b6a12b2b6894a9e29157c1859717594e98ccc5fb3eea05e71f4ed. This reveals something VERY interesting:\n\n\n-----\n\nURLScan Pivot Results\nWe seem to have stumbled upon something reasonably unique, and linked to a variety of additional infrastructure – many of\nwhich spoof a variety of legitimate services. Among the items covered in this, we can see:\n\n[Korean web portal Daum](https://www.daum.net/)\n[Korean web portal Naver](https://www.naver.com/)\nGoogle services\nVarious mail, cloud, and certificate themes\n\nInfrastructure is overwhelmingly concentrated in Korean or East Asian hosting providers, and all items appear to be created\nbetween March and November 2022 (see Table 1 below for a list of all identified indicators).\n\nAdditionally, looking at pDNS records (in this case from VirusTotal) for the IP addresses from urlscan shows additional\ninfrastructure of interest likely linked to this campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\nVirusTotal pDNS Information\nAt this stage we’ve collected a lot of information about various infrastructure created (and potentially used) in 2022 with\nsimilar themes, characteristics, and other observables. Yet it is important not to lose overall context as to what we might be\nlooking at – so some external enrichment and research is required to learn more.\n\nWith no actual threat to go off of (yet), we can start our search looking for entities that typically host phishing infrastructure\n(either for sending email, or as landing pages for links) in East Asia (and especially South Korea), that focus on spoofing\n[legitimate services with an emphasis on South Korean major web portals. Based on multiple](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-301a) [reports from](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2021/06/kimsuky-apt-continues-to-target-south-korean-government-using-appleseed-backdoor) [various entities,](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/03/vb2019-paper-kimsuky-group-tracking-king-spearphishing/)\n[one threat group stands out matching these characteristics: North Korean-related entity](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-301a) [Kimsuky.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/kimsuky)\n\nWhile we cannot be certain at this stage, based on an initial suspicious feeling around one suspect domain, we have\nuncovered an entire ecosystem of related infrastructure that may be related to an in-progress Kimsuky-associated campaign,\nlikely with a focus on website spoofing and phishing. Defenders, especially those with reason to believe they may be targeted\nby this North Korean-linked threat actor, should take the indicators provided in Table 1 and search historical logs to see if they\nhave interacted with any of these infrastructure items as an initial defensive measure. Going forward, threat intelligence\nresearchers can incorporate the characteristics in infrastructure creation documented in this report and the various linked\nresources to build a new hunting-and-pivoting profile for infrastructure related to this entity. Overall, network indicator\nresearch and refinement can yield fantastic results if you know both where to look, and what to look for.\n\n## Table 1 – Indicators From Research\n\n**Source Item** **Hosting IP** **Hosting Provider** **Name Server** **Registrar** **Create**\n**Date**\n\n118.128.149[.]119 118.128.149.119 LG Dacom Boranet N/A N/A N/A\n\n210.92.18[.]161 210.92.18.161 EHOSTICT N/A N/A N/A\n\n210.92.18[.]164 210.92.18.164 EHOSTICT N/A N/A N/A\n\n\n-----\n\n23.106.122[.]16 23.106.122.16 LeaseWeb Asia\nPacific Pte.

But more usefully, we continued to refine our understanding of adversary infrastructure creation tendencies.](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/)\nAdditionally, with the important caveat that pDNS data is not complete, we established rough timelines of when different\ninfrastructure items appear to be “active” – allowing us to guide defenders as to when activity was most likely to have\noccurred.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears most of the infrastructure identified is no longer “live.” But there’s more that we can do looking at\nother resources. For example, we can attempt to find mappings to file objects through resources such as VirusTotal. Similar\nto urlscan, we can search for the hash of the displayed, fake “404” page, which identifies additional items:\n\nVirusTotal Result\n\nFor Fake Ngnix 404 Page\n\n\n-----\n\nMore interestingly, we can contingently verify that these campaigns are tied to credential theft via website spoofing by looking\nat the full submitted URL for one of the domains in question:\n\nURL Submitted To\n\nVirusTotal\nWhile we can’t completely confirm with available information, it does appear that there is a “passthrough” on the link that on\nsubmission will redirect the user (or input) to the legitimate Gmail site.\n\nIdeally, we would find a file – an email, a payload, or some other object – that would allow us to link the infrastructure to\nfollow-on capabilities. In this case, a cursory research effort fails to identify any such objects, limiting our ability to take this\nfurther. But, if this actor – likely Kimsuky – is of interest to you, the following provides an interesting overview of how this actor\nappears to utilize infrastructure to facilitate credential capture for services such as Google, Naver, Daum, and others.\n\n\n-----",
