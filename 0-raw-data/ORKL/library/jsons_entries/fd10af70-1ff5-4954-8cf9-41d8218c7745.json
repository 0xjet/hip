    "plain_text": "# What to Expect When You’re Electing: Preparing for Cyber Threats to the 2022 U.S. Midterm Elections\n\n**[mandiant.com/resources/blog/2022-midterm-election-threats](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/2022-midterm-election-threats)**\n\nSecuring the individuals, organizations, and infrastructure involved in elections from\nmalicious cyber activity continues to be a challenge in an ever-evolving threat landscape as\nthe number of threat actors targeting this important democratic process has grown over the\nyears.Elections face the range of the adversary motivations and operations that Mandiant\ntracks across the globe—espionage threats, destructive and disruptive attacks, information\noperations, and criminal extortion.\n\nThe particulars of why an actor might target a specific election vary, and the lack of\nfrequency of elections that an actor might decide to target can make it challenging to\n[anticipate who, what, and how. As we observed in 2020, when Iranian actors impersonated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/doj-charges-iranian-hackers-who-posed-as-pro-trump-proud-boys)\nthe ‘Proud Boys’ organization to send threatening emails to voters in Florida, new election\ncycles can bring new threat activity, even if low effort. With an eye toward historic threat\nactivity here and abroad, we can leverage past observations to prepare for and respond to a\nrange of threats to the November 2022 U.S. midterm elections should they materialize.\n\nMandiant assess with moderate confidence that cyber threat activity surrounding the midterm\nelections will cause disruptions and divisiveness, but we believe notable compromises of\nactual voting devices or other activity impacting the integrity of votes is unlikely.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn particular, we will likely see information operations (IO) that target U.S. populations\naround the election. We believe that Russia, Iran, and China remain the most\nsignificant foreign IO threats, having observed numerous examples of information\noperations that we suspected to support Russian, Iranian, and Chinese interests\ncommenting on U.S. politics and 2020 candidates and issues, including activity\nintended to intimidate or influence voters.\nDuring the lead up to elections—as recent activity demonstrates—ongoing IO\ncampaigns may pivot their messaging to focus on relevant political issues as part of\ntheir broader aims of sowing divisions within the U.S. populace, undermining\ndemocratic institutions, and promoting narratives aligned with each respective\ncampaign’s interests.\nWe are also highly confident that espionage campaigns will target U.S. election\norganizations, infrastructure, political parties, government, and other related groups\nand individuals. We have tracked activity from groups associated with Russia, China,\nIran, North Korea, and other nations targeting organizations and individuals related to\nelections in the U.S. and/or other nations with apparent goals ranging from information\ncollection and establishing footholds or stealing data for later activity to one known\ncase of a destructive attack against critical election infrastructure.\nDuring the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential election cycles, we observed significant,\nmulti-pronged campaigns involving information operations, including those supported\nby cyber intrusion activity.\nWe assess with moderate confidence that disruptive and/or destructive activity, such as\ndistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or ransomware, will impact government\nand election-related organizations and infrastructure.\n\n## Recently Observed IO Activity Highlights Campaigns’ Pivot to Promotion of Narratives Around the 2022 Midterm Elections\n\nMandiant recently observed activity by three separate IO campaigns promoting narratives\npertaining to U.S. political issues, including those surrounding the 2022 U.S. midterm\nelections. IO campaigns often involve the ongoing promotion of content targeting political\ndiscourse, including that supporting specific stances or politicians outside election cycles.\n\nPreviously identified IO activity targeting the U.S. and attributed to foreign actors has shown\nattempts to influence local or regional politics. While this may not directly correlate with a\ngiven actor’s interest in influencing a midterm election, such demonstrations at least signal\ntheir interest in influencing U.S. politics at the sub-national level. For example, various\nRussia-linked online and real-life influence activity has had local and regional U.S. targeting,\nincluding support for successionist movements in states like California and Texas.\n\n### “Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens” (NAEBC)\n\n\n-----\n\nMandiant has observed continued activity by two inauthentic personas, Niels Holst and\n“Alan Krupka,” that previously claimed to be editors at the inauthentic news website NAEBC.\n[According to a Reuters article citing a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation,](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-russia-disinformation-idUSKBN26M5OP)\nNAEBC was run by individuals associated with the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA).\nWhile the news site itself is no longer accessible, a limited subset of the personas that we\nlinked to the site remain active, and promote content targeting U.S. right-leaning audiences\non the Gab social media platform. Recently, these personas have promoted narratives\nrelated to current U.S. political topics, including the midterm elections, the economy, energy\nprices, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Both persona accounts post semi-regularly, often\nreposting content from other seemingly unaffiliated users interspersed with seemingly\noriginal posts created by the accounts' operators.\n\nFigure 1: Example posts by inauthentic persona accounts affiliated with NAEBC on Gab\n\n\n-----\n\n### DRAGONBRIDGE\n\nMandiant assesses with high confidence that social media accounts associated with\nDRAGONBRIDGE, an information operations campaign we judged to be operating in support\nof the political interests of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), are promoting content\nnegatively portraying the U.S. political system and commenting on a range of domestic\npolitical, social, and economic issues, including on topics related to the 2022 U.S. midterm\nelections. Accounts highlighted economic and social issues facing the U.S., and portrayed\nthe country as riven by political infighting and polarization. Utilizing a tactic first observed\n[during DRAGONBRIDGE messaging targeting Western rare earths mining companies, some](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/dragonbridge-targets-rare-earths-mining-companies)\naccounts posted comments using first-person pronouns to feign concern, implying that they\nwere American.\n\n### EvenPolitics\n\nMandiant identified and reported to our customers on what we assessed with high\nconfidence to be an inauthentic news site, EvenPolitics, promoted by a network of\ncoordinated and inauthentic social media accounts, including those posing as U.S.\nindividuals. We further assessed with low confidence that EvenPolitics and social media\naccounts promoting the site are operated in support of Iranian political interests. While the\nsocial media accounts have since been suspended, EvenPolitics has continued to publish\narticles including those on election-related topics, such as polling models forecasting\npotential election results, the Georgia Senate race, the Republican primary race for U.S.\nRepresentative Liz Cheney’s seat, the Arizona Republican gubernatorial primary race, and\nthe Forward political party. As with other EvenPolitics articles, content appears to have been\nplagiarized and altered from original news articles published by mainstream media outlets\nsuch as The Week and The Guardian.\n\nFigure 2: Sample Twitter accounts that promoted EvenPolitics content and posing as\nindividuals from both sides of the U.S. political spectrum\n\n\n-----\n\n### Activity Around Previous U.S. Midterm Elections\n\nMandiant has identified and reported on information operations serving foreign interests\nduring the last three U.S. election cycles. For example, the pro-Iran \"Distinguished\nImpersonator\" influence campaign leveraged inauthentic personas impersonating U.S.\npolitical candidates running for office during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections to promote\ndesired narratives. The campaign also successfully published letters, blog posts, and guest\ncolumns in local U.S. news outlets and leveraged inauthentic journalist personas to conduct\ninterviews with real individuals which the interviewees expressed views in line with Iranian\ninterests.\n\n## Cyber Espionage\n\nBased on recently observed activity patterns and/or past election targeting, including U.S.\nraces, we anticipate that APT41, APT31, APT29, and APT42 are likely to target U.S.\ngovernment and other election-related organizations. We suggest that this list could\nrepresent a useful guide for prioritizing defensive strategies and hunt missions for relevant\ngovernment, civil society, media, and technology organizations ahead of the 2022 U.S.\nmidterm election. However, this list should not be viewed as comprehensive; it is possible\nthat additional known actors or previously unobserved groups will also engage in relevant\ncyber threat activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Cyber espionage groups likely to target the 2022 U.S. midterm elections\n\n\n**Recent targeting of U.S.**\n**government or other election**\n**related organizations**\n\n**APT41** Mandiant observed multiple\nAPT41 campaigns targeting U.S. state\ngovernments in 2021, including this\ncampaign, which involved exploitation\nof vulnerabilities in USAHERDS and\nLog4J.\n\n\n**Past targeting of U.S. or international**\n**elections**\n\nIn July and August 2016, APT41\ntargeted Hong Kong media outlets\nusing SOGU malware ahead of the\nlegislative council election. The group\nlikely targeted media organizations with\nspear-phishing campaigns due to their\npro-democracy editorial content.\n\n\n-----\n\n**APT31** Google [reported that it successfully](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/21-00023222)\nblocked an APT31 phishing campaign\ntargeting \"high-profile Gmail users\naffiliated with the U.S. government\" in\nFebruary 2022.\n\n**APT29** Mandiant continues to detect and\nreport APT29 phishing campaigns and\nthird-party compromises that primarily\nappear to be targeting diplomatic and\nforeign policy entities in Europe and\nthe Americas.\n\n**APT42** Between March and June\n[2021, APT42 used a compromised](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/20-00023902)\nemail account of a U.S.-based think\ntank to target Middle East researchers\nat similar organizations, U.S.\ngovernment officials involved in Middle\nEast and Iran policy, and other\nindividuals.\n\n## Cybercrime\n\n\n[In June 2020, Google reported that](https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1268589219842109440)\nAPT31 targeted staff of the Biden\ncampaign with phishing attempts. In\n[October 2020, Google reported](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-were-tackling-evolving-online-threats)\nadditional APT31 phishing of Biden\ncampaign staff using spoofed McAfee\ncredential collection attempts.\n\n[According to open sources, APT29](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/fancy-bear-cozy-bear-russia.html)\ncompromised the Democratic National\nCommittee (DNC) ahead of the 2016\nU.S. election, likely separately from\nAPT28's concurrent compromise.\n\n[Microsoft and](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/04/recent-cyberattacks-require-us-all-to-be-vigilant/) [Google independently](https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1268589219842109440)\nreported Iranian threat activity targeting\nU.S. election campaign staff and others\nin late 2019 and summer 2020.\nMandiant believes that both reports\nrefer to [APT42 activity.](https://vblocalhost.com/conference/presentations/unc788-irans-decade-of-credential-harvesting-and-surveillance-operations/)\n\n\nMany election-related organizations are also at risk of being targeted or impacted by\nransomware and other types of cybercrime. Though this activity may not be driven by threat\nactors seeking to disrupt the electoral process due to political motivations, nonetheless it\ncould impact business processes that may have cascading impacts to execution of the\nelection. However, state-sponsored or affiliated threat actors such as UNC2448 may also\nleverage ransomware under the guise of financially motivated activity to disrupt the electoral\nprocess.\n\n## Hacktivism\n\nHacktivists may be motivated by election-related issues to conduct activities such as data\nleaks or website defacements with the intent of expressing a viewpoint or causing\ndisruptions. Examples include a November 2020 data leak by a Portuguese hacktivist group\nthat leaked what appeared to be old and possibly fabricated data regarding a Brazilian\nelection and an Iranian hacktivist defacing a U.S. commercial website to display messages\ncritical of the U.S. in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. We also note that nation\nstate-sponsored actors have a history of leveraging false hacktivist fronts as a tactic to\n\n\n-----\n\nsupport their operations, including those targeting elections. For example, the false hacktivist\npersona Guccifer 2.0 was leveraged by Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate of the General\nStaff (GRU) as part of its targeting of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n## Insider Threats\n\nInsider Threats have become a concern for election officials. In 2021, a judge barred an\nelected county official from supervising any future elections after it came to light that the\nofficial had allowed an individual not affiliated with the election commission to photograph\nand publish confidential voting-machine passwords, as well as making copies of the hard\ndrives and changing settings on the machine that introduced security vulnerabilities into the\nprocess. Similar incidents have occurred in other states, speaking to a concerning rise in\nsecurity breaches by insiders.\n\n## The Targets—The Election Ecosystem\n\nJust as there are a broad array of threat actors, there is a diversity to where (and how) cyber\nthreats to elections might play out. Cyber espionage and cyber attacks from state-sponsored\nactors, information operations, hacktivism, and even cybercrime can all pose a threat to\nentities evolved in elections in different ways.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Targets of threat activity\nAt a high level, the attack surface of an election involves election systems and infrastructure,\nelection administrators and entities involved in running the election, and organizations\ninvolved in the political campaigning process—to include news and media organizations that\nmight be exploited or leveraged by threat actors. The ease of targeting and nature of threat\nactivity (cyber espionage, information operations, extortion, etc.) can vary across entities\nwithin these categories.\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\nIn comparison with safeguarding other types of infrastructure or potential targets, election\nadministrators and security practitioners face some unique challenges. It is important to\nemphasize that not all these threats represent an equal risk in impact to the electoral\nprocess.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Event-specific activity: The reasons why a certain actor might target an election**\nmight vary from one event to another. In observance of election-related IO activity,\npresidential and general elections seem to be targeted at higher volume than midterms,\nbased on the limited sample size of Mandiant and public third-party reporting. However,\nthis assessment may be influenced by attention bias; it is likely that more defenders\nspend more time hunting for activity surrounding presidential and general elections\nthan regional, local, or midterm elections.\n**Assessing intent: One challenge in assessing risk from threat actors targeting**\n[elections is that the targeting of certain entities (such as state infrastructure) could be](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt41-us-state-governments)\nfor purposes other than election-related threat activity; simultaneously though, a\nfoothold in such infrastructure could also be leveraged in the future for election-centric\nactivity. Visibility into specific data or victims targeted, as well as historical missions’\ntaskings attributed to a specific group may provide additional insight into adversary\nmotivations.\n**Communication of threats: As trust in the electoral process is essential,**\ncommunication of the details of an ongoing incident that may occur during an election\n—with stakeholders being the broader public—increases the complexity of response.\nTimely communication of what targets were impacted and in what manner becomes an\nimportant component in ensuring trust in the process that election administrators must\nnavigate.\n\nA historical understanding of threats to election participants and infrastructure—and global\nvisibility into current operations by threat actors that have demonstrated an interest in\ntargeting elections—can prove valuable for security teams to scope, prioritize, and anticipate\nfuture threat emergence. Threat intelligence that informs and provides visibility into the\nrecent tools, tactics, and procedures of such threat actors in other operations can better arm\nelection defenders. Organizations can operationalize such insights to proactively harden\nnetworks and potential targets to better prepare for threats to this critical democratic process.\n\n[Head over to our election security page for more on how Mandiant is helping to secure](https://www.mandiant.com/solutions/defending-elections-against-cyber-threats)\nelections.\n\n\n-----",
