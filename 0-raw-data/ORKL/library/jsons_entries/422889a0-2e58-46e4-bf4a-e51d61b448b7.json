Those consistencies include naming similarities, registration through\nNameCheap, and reuse of the same CIDR blocks for hosting. However, those consistencies\nare not unique and most of the identified infrastructure is not hosted on ASNs seen in the\nprevious infrastructure, SSL certificates have not been created for most of the domains, and\nwe have no information on Cobalt Strike or Bazar communicating with this infrastructure.\nAdditionally, one of the domains — service-boostter.com — uses a Let’s Encrypt SSL\ncertificate, which differs from the previously identified infrastructure. New SSL certificates or\nrelevant malicious file behavior consistent with the previously identified infrastructure would\nhelp increase our confidence in the assessed relationship to Ryuk.\n\nThe identified infrastructure includes the following:\n\n[service-hellper[.]com (45.138.172[.]95)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=service-hellper.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[open1vpn[.]com (45.147.229[.]253)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=open1vpn.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[nasmastrservice[.]com (45.147.230[.]87)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=nasmastrservice.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[nasmasterservice[.]com (45.147.229[.]128)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=nasmasterservice.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[nas-helper[.]com (45.147.228[.]164)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=nas-helper.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[elephantdrrive[.]com (45.147.229[.]180)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=elephantdrrive.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[backupnas1[.]com (45.147.230[.]30)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=backupnas1.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[backupmastter[.]com (45.147.228[.]77)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=backupmastter.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[backup1service[.]com (45.138.172[.]51)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=backup1service.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[backup1nas[.]com (45.138.172[.]30)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=backup1nas.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[service-boostter[.]com (185.25.51[.]76)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=service-boostter.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\nWe identified several additional possible Ryuk domains based on consistencies with Incident\n20200930A. At least two of the domains were also identified in behavioral information for\nCobalt Strike executables, similar to those in the aforementioned Incident. The domains’\nconsistencies include naming similarities, registration through NameCheap, and reuse of the\nsame CIDR blocks for hosting It should be noted that those consistencies are not unique\n\n\n-----\n\nand most of the identified infrastructure is not hosted on ASNs seen in the previous\ninfrastructure and SSL certificates have not been created for most of the domains. New SSL\ncertificates or relevant malicious file behavior consistent with the previously identified\ninfrastructure would help increase our confidence in the assessed relationship to Ryuk.\n\nThe identified infrastructure and files includes the following:\n\n[backup-helper[.]com (45.147.229[.]44)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=backup-helper.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[backup-leader[.]com (45.147.229[.]52, Cobalt Strike](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=backup-leader.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n[4544b478b2029ec38eb4bda111741a10f0684e38f1b29ce092b93df882d11f9e)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/file.xhtml?file=7430F8E3F9F8716B8DBC548997AD8F8A)\n\n[backup-simple[.]com (45.147.229[.]68)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=backup-simple.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[bakcup-checker[.]com (45.147.229[.]92)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=bakcup-checker.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[bakcup-monster[.]com (45.147.230[.]131, Cobalt Strike](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=bakcup-monster.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n[2376a8da650c124b3d916765f82929b4109f20bc4f211a39a4d1cd4391780d1f)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/file.xhtml?file=BA17A1FD0E350C77A58C88AE6AA28AAA&owners=2,2022,5965,7032,2027,631,3117827561,850,981,4699,1817,1308,5954,728,10945,2175,3266,1331,1310,6263,4504,3308,2716,2414,1354,2194,8198,3963,3288,5837,689,1765,4352,14837,957925814,11014,1291053953,1366072189,11070,1254149353,2062,9525,9689,1930973938,1930974303,1930974969,8609,1930975114,1930977088,1930994355,2092,8373,4070,2094,3037,3038,3039,3906,9367,3576,3136646679,3256663302,3029726749,3029724245,3029729457,3029726855,1931001500,1931002777,3578,3486,7316,5862,4668,4667,1931013370,8071,945995801,1931023406,2631,4258,1943253936,1940687317,1943254027,1940764808,9205,1946179136,1946179227,1946179318,9366,7317,1937489682,3907,7319,1937489411,7318,2093,1937489522,2412124678,7202,1937560369,7321,2169615013,3134860420,7122,9206,7322,2120189823,1076843703,1937489104,7726,7725,7727,10666,7981,2182417454,10651,7324,7325,2800,8659,8918,4068,7979&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[boost-servicess[.]com (45.147.230[.]132)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=boost-servicess.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[nas-leader[.]com (45.147.230[.]133)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=nas-leader.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[nas-simple-helper[.]com (45.147.230[.]140)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=nas-simple-helper.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[service-checker[.]com (45.147.230[.]141)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=service-checker.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[service-leader[.]com (45.147.230[.]159)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=service-leader.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n**ThreatConnect Research Team Intelligence: Items recently created or updated in the**\nThreatConnect Common Community by our Research Team.\n\n[20201011A: File Matching YARA Rule Associated to Mustang Panda PlugX](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=4226887793#/)\nThreatConnect Research identified a Mustang Panda PlugX binary and extracted\nCommand and Control locations from the embedded configuration.\n\n**Technical Blogs and Reports Incidents with Active and Observed Indicators: Incidents**\nassociated to one or more Indicators with an Active status and at least one global\nObservation across the ThreatConnect community.
