Wednesday, April 8,_\n2020 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) pandemic is creating challenges for\norganizations and individuals around the world. Most organizations have implemented\nremote working for their employees where possible. This transition changes how employees\naccess data and communicate with colleagues and customers. That change creates an\nopportunity for threat actors who seek to exploit the situation for financial gain or intelligence\ngathering.\n\nSecureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers are tracking multiple coronavirusthemed campaigns across customer telemetry and third-party reporting. As of this\npublication, there has not been a noticeable increase in detections across customers’\nmanaged security controls since the beginning of 2020. However, there is clear evidence of\nwell-established cybercriminal and government-sponsored threat actors leveraging general\ninterest in COVID-19 to entice victims to open malicious links and attachments. CTU™\nresearchers have observed government-sponsored hackers weaponizing coronavirusthemed Office documents and sophisticated criminal operators targeting critical infrastructure\nand organizations in areas hit hard by the pandemic.\n\nThe international response to the pandemic will be the subject of intelligence focus for some\ncountries, as they seek to understand what other countries and international organizations\nare doing, saying, and thinking beyond public statements. This focus has likely shifted\ntargeting requirements for some intelligence agencies and their associated cyberespionage\n[operations. For example, Iranian government-sponsored threat actors reportedly attempted](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-cyber-iran-exclusi/exclusive-hackers-linked-to-iran-target-who-staff-emails-during-coronavirus-sources-idUSKBN21K1RC)\nto infiltrate the World Health Organization.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional cyberespionage activity continues. There have been many examples\nof government-sponsored actors incorporating the COVID-19 situation into their standard\ntargeting operations:\n\nWord documents using Taiwanese, Vietnamese, and English language coronavirus[themed lures in February and March have been attributed to BRONZE PRESIDENT](https://www.anomali.com/blog/covid-19-themes-are-being-utilized-by-threat-actors-of-varying-sophistication)\n(also known as Mustang Panda).\n\n\n-----\n\nCTU researchers analyzed a malicious RTF document in February linked to threat\nactors suspected to be based in China. This purported update from the Mongolian\nMinistry of Health on the global COVID-19 situation (see Figure 1) dropped the\nPoisonIvy remote access trojan.\n\n_Figure 1. Malicious RTF document linked to suspected China-based threat actors._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe Pakistan-based COPPER FIELDSTONE threat group (also known as APT36)\n[reportedly leveraged the coronavirus pandemic in a lure document supposedly from the](https://threatpost.com/apt36-taps-coronavirus-as-golden-opportunity-to-spread-crimson-rat/153776/)\ngovernment of India. The document dropped the threat group’s signature CrimsonRAT\nmalware.\nIn March, a file named “COVID-19 and North Korea.docx” was uploaded to the\nVirusTotal analysis service and was observed contacting a command and control (C2)\ndomain associated with the North Korean NICKEL KIMBALL threat group (also known\nas Kimsuky).\n[On April 3, researchers noted a COVID-themed malicious document (maldoc) that](https://twitter.com/Circuitous__/status/1246069523108835328)\nused a C2 domain linked to the TILDEN threat group (also known as Gamaredon).\nCTU researchers assess that TILDEN may be associated with Russian intelligence\nservices.\n\n\n-----\n\nWell-resourced cyberespionage groups can rapidly adapt their targeting to take advantage of\nemerging opportunities. Due to public interest in COVID-19, spearphishing attacks using this\ntheme are more likely to be successful. It is highly likely that threat groups will also explore\ntheir targets’ increased attack surface as employees transition to working from home and the\nuptake in remote access and conferencing solutions continues.\n\nAlthough hostile foreign intelligence services might not factor into every organization’s threat\nmodel, all organizations should consider risks posed by financially motivated cybercriminals.\nThose groups have also quickly pivoted to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n[The Italian government implemented quarantines in Lombardy and 14 other affected](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51787238)\n[provinces on March 8 and then extended the lockdown nationwide on March 10 in](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51810673)\nresponse to rising numbers of infections. On March 2 and 3, when it was clear that Italy\nwas facing a challenge in containing the spread of the disease, several high-volume\nItalian-language spam campaigns began distributing the TrickBot malware. On March\n13, CTU researchers observed Italian banks being added to TrickBot web inject\n[configurations. This timing could be a coincidence, or GOLD BLACKBURN could have](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/trickbot-modifications-target-us-mobile-users)\nrecognized that social isolation might result in an increased dependency on online\nbanking.\nIn late February, [REvil ransom notes containing the names of Italian manufacturing](https://www.secureworks.com/research/revil-sodinokibi-ransomware)\ncompanies began to appear. It is possible that one or more REvil affiliates are\ndeliberately targeting organizations that might be more susceptible to extortion\nbecause they are already facing an extremely challenging economic outlook.\n[A legitimate coronavirus tracking map was weaponized with the AZORult information-](https://blog.reasonsecurity.com/2020/03/09/covid-19-info-stealer-the-map-of-threats-threat-analysis-report/)\nstealing malware and sold on underground forums.\n[The LokiBot information stealer has been dropped via a maldoc that uses a World](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/latest-global-covid-19-coronavirus-spearphishing-campaign-drops-infostealer.html)\nHealth Organization theme.\nAn email sent in March claiming to provide tips on how to avoid COVID-19 scams\n[delivered the Gozi ISFB (also known as Ursnif) banking trojan.](https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/covid-19-phishing-update-email-posing-as-scam-guidance-delivers-malware-instead)\n[Threat actors have purportedly attempted to brute force Linksys routers so they could](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/03/new-router-dns-hijacking-attacks-abuse-bitbucket-to-host-infostealer/)\nmodify DNS records to redirect network traffic to a coronavirus-themed malicious\nwebsite delivering the Oski stealer malware.\nThe [corona live 1.1 app claims to track the coronavirus but actually delivers the](https://blog.lookout.com/commercial-surveillanceware-operators-latest-to-take-advantage-of-covid-19)\ncommercially available SpyMax spyware in a campaign targeting Libyans.\n\nThe fundamental business model and revenue generation of these sophisticated criminal\ngroups does not really change as a result of the global pandemic. But fear, uncertainty, and a\nthirst for information about the current situation increases the number of potential victims and\nthe likelihood of successful attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome threat actors have granted the healthcare sector a partial reprieve from this activity.\nGOLD VILLAGE, which operates the Maze ransomware, stated on March 18 that it would no\nlonger target healthcare. However, the threat actors subsequently advertised compromised\nhealthcare organizations. Since March 24, the GOLD TAHOE threat group, which operates\nthe Clop ransomware, has included a message on its public name-and-shame website that\nthe group will not target healthcare. It is perhaps too early to determine if there is some\nhonor among thieves.\n\nThe activity receiving the most public attention includes spoofed domains, disruptive acts\ntargeting remote conferencing services, and other scams. Unlike some of the threats\ndiscussed earlier in this blog post, the challenge for security teams in these incidents is\nidentifying the malicious activity amid the noise.\n\nOver 90,000 coronavirus-themed domains that included terms such as covid, corona,\n[chineseflu, and wuhan were created between January 1 and April 1. The vast majority](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/free-covid-19-threat-list-domain-risk-assessments-for-coronavirus-threats)\nof these domains will not be linked to active cybercrime or targeted activity, but some\nundoubtedly will be.\n[Threat actors are taking advantage of increased teleconferencing use, spoofing](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/03/30/covid-19-impact-cyber-criminals-target-zoom-domains/)\nlegitimate applications to deliver malware and creating malicious domains imitating\nplatforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Hangouts.\nThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned of teleconferencing services\nbeing hijacked (also known as Zoom-bombing), noting incidents in two U.S. schools. A\nsignificant proportion of activity targeting remote conferencing services will be\nopportunistic and intended to cause minor disruption. However, sophisticated threat\nactors will try to find and exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in those platforms.\nThreat actors [created sextortion emails that threaten to infect the victim’s family](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/03/19/dirty-little-secret-extortion-email-threatens-to-give-your-family-coronavirus/)\nmembers with coronavirus if a payment of $4,000 USD is not received. While these\nthreats cannot be fulfilled, they may be convincing enough to scare victims.\nThe FBI [identified an SMS phishing (smishing) campaign that appeared to be a](https://twitter.com/FBISanDiego/status/1245343925923168258)\nmessage from consumer products wholesaler Costco. The message offered money for\ncompleting a survey, but the survey is hosted on a malicious website.\n[Alleged government-funding opportunities have been advertised through Facebook](https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/16920-bbb-tip-government-grant-scam)\nMessenger. These scams instruct the recipient to pay $20 USD for shipping of a “grant”\ncheck that never arrives.\n\nCTU researchers recommend that organizations apply the following mitigations for\ncoronavirus-themed threats. Many of these security practices protect organizations against\nother threats as well.\n\nTrain employees to recognize and report phishing and other scams. These attempts\ncould leverage via email, phone, social media, SMS (text), or other messaging\napplications\n\n\n-----\n\nConduct regular vulnerability scans, particularly of Internet-facing infrastructure. Ensure\nthat devices and applications are centrally managed, are installed from known-good\nmedia, and are regularly patched.\nUse multi-factor authentication where possible. Requiring additional authentication\nelements makes it difficult for threat actors to gain access using stolen user credentials.\nImplement endpoint and network monitoring controls to detect malicious activity. Focus\non detecting and investigating unusual activity from weaponized files, such as\nlaunching PowerShell, WMI, WScript, or unusual network communications.\nWhere possible, require users to connect through corporate resources such as virtual\nprivate networks (VPNs) and DNS servers to access the Internet. This approach\nprovides additional monitoring opportunities if user endpoints are compromised.\nConsider the organization’s security requirements when selecting a remote\nconferencing tool and vendor to ensure that the tool allows for an appropriate level of\nprotection for conversations and data.\nIssue guidance to employees regarding proper use of remote conferencing services.\nUse passcodes or other authentication features, and do not publicly disclose meeting\nIDs where possible.\nReview incident response plans to ensure that remain appropriate for the modified\nwork environment. Consider how to test those plans without adding unnecessary stress\nto the organization.\nSelect a full-service threat intelligence provider, or several complementary ones, that\noffers coverage to support the organization’s threat model and that reduces the\npotential of internal security teams spending their time chasing false leads.\n\n\n-----",
