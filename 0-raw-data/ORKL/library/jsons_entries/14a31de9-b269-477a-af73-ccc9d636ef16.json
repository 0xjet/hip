The result was that the attackers gained access to some of the companies’\nindustrial control systems and several companies had to go into island mode operation.\n\n\n**The largest attack**\nAs far as we know, such a large cyber attack against the Danish critical infrastructure\nhas not previously been carried out.\nThe attackers gained access to the infrastructure of 22 companies in a few days.\n\n**Attackers with thorough preparation**\nThe attackers knew in advance who they were going to target and got it right every\ntime.\n\n\n**Coordinated, successful attacks against Danish critical infrastructure**\nDenmark is constantly under attack. But it is unusual that we see so many concurrent,\nsuccessful attacks against the critical infrastructure.\n\n**Possible involvement of state actors**\nThere are indications that a state actor may have been involved in one or more attacks.\n\n\n**SektorCERT’s sensor network and a strong collaboration**\nWithout SektorCERT’s sensor network to detect the attacks, our skilled analysts as well\nas close cooperation with our members, their suppliers, and authorities, the attack could\nhave had operational consequences for the Danish infrastructure.\n\n\n**The 25 recommendations**\nBased on the attack, we have highlighted those of our 25 recommendations which are\nrelevant in connection to the concrete attack techniques.\nWe continue to recommend everyone who operates Danish, critical infrastructure to\nimplement all SektorCERT’s 25 recommendations.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### About SektorCERT\n\nSektorCERT is the cyber security centre for the critical sectors.\n\n\nSektorCERT is an essential part of the sectors’ defence against cyber threats. We help detect\nand manage when critical infrastructure is exposed to cyber attacks, and we are where the\ncrucial knowledge that can prevent the next attack is built and shared.\n\nAmong other things, we monitor the companies in the sectors that are connected to our\nextensive sensor network. Through the sensor network, we monitor internet traffic in order\nto detect cyber attacks against Danish critical infrastructure.\n\n\nSektorCERT is a non-profit organisation owned and funded by Danish critical infrastructure\ncompanies. We collaborate with Europe’s other CERTs and are members of a number of cyber\nsecurity organisations, which means we have extensive knowledge of the threats to critical\ninfrastructure.\n\n##### Classification\n\n\nSektorCERT utilises Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)\nversion 2 when sharing information to indicate\nhow the information can be shared further.\n\nThe TLP scale is divided into four levels as shown\nin the image. Each level indicates whether and to\nwhat extent the information can be shared. The\nrestrictions on sharing apply both when sharing\nthe actual document and in other verbal and\nwritten communication about the content.\n\n\nThis document is classified as\nTLP:CLEAR.\n\n\nRead more about Traffic Light Protocol\nat FIRST: www.first.org/tlp/.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### About the report\n\nThe report describes the most extensive, cyber-related attack against Danish, critical\ninfrastructure that we know of so far.\n\n\nThe purpose of the report is to ensure that we learn from the attacks, so that we are\ncollectively better equipped against the next attacks to come.\n\n##### The description of the attack is structurally divided into two parts\n\n\n\n- Analysis\nIn the analysis, SektorCERT has taken the facts about the attack and compared them with\nthe information we have about threat actors, geopolitics, knowledge of attack methods\nand techniques as well as our knowledge of previous attacks. This part of the report is\nsubjective.\n\n- Timeline\nIn the timeline, only the facts are reviewed. What exactly happened and when did it hap­\npen. This section is objective.\n\n\nThe analysis can be read independently of the timeline, if you do not need all the technical\ndetails.\n\n\n**Facts vs analysis**\nIt is important to note the difference between facts and analysis.\n\nThe timeline for the attacks goes through, minute by minute, the\nactual attack against the Danish critical infrastructure.\nOnly the facts are described here: the things we are aware of that\nhappened based on direct observations. These are things we\nknow.\n\n\nThe analysis is subjective and is our assessment. It has been\ndeveloped on the basis of actual observations, visits to the\naffected members, cooperation with the authorities and review\nof large amounts of information on threat actors.\n\nBased on the same facts, different analyses can be developed.\nOur analysis is therefore a description of what we believe and\nmean.\n\n\nIn the section after the analysis, SektorCERT draws a number of conclusions based on the\nanalysis, as well as describe the recommendations we have in relation to preventing future\nattacks.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### SektorCERTs sensor network\n\nSektorCERT runs a sensor network that we use to create a picture of the threats to the Danish\ncritical infrastructure. It is of course also used to detect attacks against the companies that are\npart of the sensor network.\n\n\nIn relation to the attacks described in this report, the sensor network has been essential\nin terms of discovering the patterns of the attacks across the companies and being able to\nrespond quickly.\nIn cases where the individual attack could have gone unnoticed, the sensor network has\nensured that by looking at data across companies, we have been able to identify the attackers\nand their methods.\n\nin total implemented in\nDanish, critical\n\n# 270 infrastructure\n\n**SENSORS** (May 2023)\n\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### A N A L Y S I S\n\nBased on the actual observations, visits to the affected\n\nmembers, cooperation with suppliers and the authorities\n\nand review of large amounts of information on threat actors,\n\nSektorCERT has prepared an analysis of the attack.\n\nThe timeline with the technical details surrounding the attack\n\ncan be found from page 21 onwards.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Detailed analysis of the case\n\nIn the following, the case is reviewed analytically. This means that SektorCERT takes the facts (see\nthe timeline from page 21) about the attack and compares it with the information we have about\nthreat actors, geopolitics, knowledge of attack methods and techniques as well as our knowledge\nof previous attacks.\nThis part of the report is subjective and we may be wrong in our assessments.\n\n\n**Before the attack**\n\n**25/4**\nOn April 25, 2023, Zyxel, which produces firewalls used by many of SektorCERT’s members,\nannounced that there was a critical vulnerability in a number of their products.\nThe vulnerability received a score of 9.8\non a scale of 1-10, which means that the\n\n**Zyxel**\n\nvulnerability was both relatively easy to exploit\n\nZyxel is a large manufacturer of, among\n\nand that it could have major consequences.\n\nother things, firewalls which are often\n\nThe reference for the vulnerability was\n\nused in slightly smaller companies or in\n\nCVE-2023-28771.\n\nnetwork segments where there is less\ntraffic.\n\nIn this specific case, there was a vulnerability\n\nIn Denmark, we have experience\n\nwhich allowed an attacker to send network\n\nthat Zyxel is used to a large extent to\n\npackets to a Zyxel firewall and gain complete\n\nprotect the critical infrastructure and\n\ncontrol of the firewall without knowing either\n\nwe know that many OT environments in\n\nusernames or passwords for the device.\n\nsmaller, Danish companies within critical\ninfrastructure use Zyxel firewalls.\n\nWhat made the situation extra serious was\nthat it is precisely the firewall that must\nprotect the equipment behind it that was\nvulnerable.\nAt the same time, we knew that many of our\nmembers used these firewalls to protect\nthe industrial control systems. Thus, these\nunits were often all that stood between the\nattackers and the control of Danish critical\ninfrastructure.\n\n\nShadowserver, a non-profit organization that monitors threats on the Internet, stated:\n_”At this stage if you have a vulnerable device exposed, assume compromise.”_\n\n\nWe were therefore in a situation where the attack groups had a publicly known vulnerability\nthey could use to penetrate the industrial control systems. And the primary defense against\nthat happening was precisely the equipment that was vulnerable.\nIt was a so-called worst case scenario – the worst imaginable scenario.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n**1/5**\nSektorCERT had previously warned the members about the importance of patching Zyxel\nfirewalls in particular, but on May 1 we issued an extraordinary warning to install the latest\nupdate. At this time, no attacks had been\nobserved in Denmark, but it was clear\nfrom our partners in other countries that **Updates (patches)**\nit was only a matter of time before the Most of the attacks described here in the\nattackers would turn their spotlight on report were possible because the devices that\nDenmark. were attacked had not had the latest updates\n\ninstalled.\n\n\nFor many of our members this was a surprise.\nMany believed that because the firewall was\n\n**11/5** relatively new, it must be assumed to have\nIt happened on May 11. the latest software, while others mistakenly\nIn a coordinated attack against 16 assumed that their vendor was responsible for\ncarefully selected targets among Danish the updates.\nenergy companies, an attack group Other members had deliberately opted out\nattempted to exploit the vulnerability of the updates as there was a cost from the\nCVE-2023-28771. supplier to install them (the software itself is\n\nfree).\n\nThe attackers knew in advance who they Still others simply did not know they had the\nwanted to hit.

Precisely in this decoder was the said vulnerability. The result was that the attacker\ncould execute commands with root privileges directly on the device without authentication.\nAn attack that could be performed by sending a single packet towards the device.\n\n\n**First wave**\n\n\n**11/5**\nIt happened on May 11.\nIn a coordinated attack against 16\ncarefully selected targets among Danish\nenergy companies, an attack group\nattempted to exploit the vulnerability\nCVE-2023-28771.\n\n\nThe attackers knew in advance who they\nwanted to hit.

This means that the attackers gained control\nof the firewall at these companies and thus had access to the critical infrastructure behind it.\n\nThe other 5 did not end up completing the commands. Possibly because the packets sent\nwere incorrectly formatted, resulting in the attacks failing.\n\n\nFor the 11 that were compromised, the attackers executed code on the firewall that caused it\nto hand their configuration and current usernames back to the attackers.\nSektorCERT estimated that the attackers used this command as reconnaissance to see how\nthe respective firewalls were configured and then choose how the further attack should\nproceed.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\nTime was of the essence. It was now a battle between attackers and defenders: could\nSektorCERT, together with our members, manage to act quickly enough to stop the attacks\nbefore the attackers could cause damage to the critical infrastructure we collectively protect.\n\nAn incident team was quickly formed in SektorCERT.\nOver the next few hours, a series of parallel tracks ran:\n\n- In one track, it was for the analysts to ensure that all the companies, that were under\nattack, had been identified and that new attacks would be detected immediately.\n\n- In another track, the focus was to get in touch with the members who had already been\naffected and ensure that we managed the situation together with the members.\n\n- In the third track, the suppliers were in focus. We wanted to work with the suppliers of\nthese firewalls to identify any other companies that had not yet installed the updates and\nensure that this happened before the attackers also found them.\n\n- In the last track, the authorities were contacted and the information shared. Both\nnational and international partners were involved, and the authorities were briefed. At\nthe same time, we again sent out a notice to the members to immediately install the\nupdates as Danish, critical infrastructure was now under active attack.\n\n\nSeveral things about the attack were notable:\nFirstly, as mentioned, the attackers knew exactly who to attack. At this time, information\nabout who had vulnerable devices was not available on public services such as Shodan.\nTherefore, the attackers had to have\nobtained information about who had\nvulnerable firewalls in some other way. **Unauthorized scans**\nSektorCERT cannot identify in our data SektorCERT analyzes data from the sensor\nscans prior to the attacks, which could network and compiles a list of observed\nhave provided the attackers with the unauthorized scans that members can use to\nnecessary information. block these scans.\nTo this day, there is no clear explanation\nof how the attackers had the necessary The aim is to ensure\ninformation, but we can state that among that you appear on as\nthe 300 members, they did not miss a few of the attackers’\nsingle shot. lists of possible targets\n\nas possible.\n\n\nThe other remarkable thing was that so\nmany companies were attacked at the\nsame time. This kind of coordination\nrequires planning and resources.\nThe advantage of attacking\nsimultaneously is that the information\nabout one attack cannot spread to the\nother targets before it is too late. This\nputs the power of information sharing out\nof play because no one can be warned in advance about the ongoing attack since everyone is\nattacked at the same time.\nIt is unusual – and extremely effective.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\nIt also had another consequence: that SektorCERT had to handle 16 simultaneous cases. It\nwas a task that demanded something extraordinary from the incident team.\n\n\nOn 11 May, there was no doubt that\nwork had to be done around the clock\nto ensure that the attackers did not gain\naccess to the critical infrastructure that\nsupplies the Danes with electricity and\nheat.\n\n\n**24x7**\nSektorCERT currently does not have the staff\nto respond to attacks outside normal working\nhours.\n\n\nTherefore, the team made a decision that would later prove decisive: to continue handling\nthe incidents outside working hours, even though there was actually no staffing in SektorCERT\nto handle this.\n\nBecause of this, through the afternoon, evening and night, it was possible to secure each and\nevery one of the 11 compromised energy companies via a very large effort from the team as\nwell as from benevolent suppliers and quickly responding members.\n\nA huge victory for the protection of the critical infrastructure. And a big defeat for the\nattackers. And at the same time a completely invisible incident for the Danes, who still had\nelectricity and heat in their homes. Quite unaware of the battles that had been fought in\ncyberspace to protect the infrastructure we all depend on.\n\n\nDespite good preparatory work, the attackers had to see their first attack wave fail. Well, they\ndid manage to gain a foothold and gain control of the energy companies’ firewalls, but before\nthey could exploit access to the critical infrastructure, they were discovered and stopped.\n\nFor the next 10 days there was silence from the attackers.\n\n\n**Second wave**\n\n**22/5**\nOn May 22, the second wave began. With a attack group possibly armed with new, neverbefore-seen cyber weapons.\n\n\nWhether the same attack group during this period was preparing for the second wave or\nother groups came into play, we do not know.\nWe are mostly inclined to believe that there were two different attack groups based on the\n’style’ of the attacks. But whether the groups worked together, worked for the same employer\nor were completely unaware of each other’s existence, we do not yet know.\n\n\n**22/5 at 14:44**\nOn 22 May at 14:44, another alarm went off at SektorCERT. We could see that a member was\ndownloading new software for their firewall over an insecure connection.\nSuch an alarm is not in itself necessarily proof that the member is under attack. But with the\nexperience of the previous weeks fresh in the memory, it was a clear sign that something was\nup.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\nIt was remarkable that the alarm only went off when the member’s firewall had started\ndownloading new software. Prior to this, there must have been an attack that enabled the\nattackers to get the firewall to download this new software. We did not yet have insight into\nthis attack.\n\nSektorCERT monitored the traffic and observed that the firewall in question subsequently\nbegan to behave as if it were part of the known Mirai botnet. It was a positive sign as it could\nmean that the attackers only wanted to use the access to the firewall to carry out DDoS\nattacks and not to affect the critical infrastructure they had (perhaps unknowingly) gained\naccess to at the same time.\n\n\nThere was also Command & Control traffic. However, due to encryption, it was not possible\nto see what commands the Command & Control server sent back. But we could see the\nconsequence. It was that the member subsequently participated in DDoS attacks with two\ntargets in the USA and Hong Kong and thus - without knowing it - became part of a cyber\nattack against other companies.\n\nFollowing the recommendation of SektorCERT, the member closed, just before 15, their\ninternet connection completely and went into island operation.\nThis bought some time to get help from their vendor to reset the firewall, install updates and\nensure that the attackers had not used the access for anything other than the DDoS attack.\n\n\nAt the same time, we in SektorCERT began to investigate whether the attackers had other\ngoals than this one, but also which attack method had been used.\n\nAt this time, it was not yet clear which vulnerability had been exploited in connection with\nthese attacks. Zyxel had not yet announced any new vulnerabilities, and SektorCERT’s analysis\nof the attacks led it to believe it was a different type of attack than those observed on May 11.\n\n\nA few days later (on May 24), Zyxel announced two new vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-33009 and\nCVE-2023-33010.\nHowever, these were unknown vulnerabilities at the time of the attack (May 22) and it is\nSektorCERT’s assessment that the attackers possibly knew about the vulnerabilities before\nthey were announced by Zyxel and chose to use this knowledge to attack Danish, critical\ninfrastructure, among other things .\n\nOn 22 May, SektorCERT could only ascertain that Danish critical infrastructure was still under\nattack and that Zyxel firewalls appeared to be vulnerable.\n\n\nHowever, it wasn’t long before the next attack demanded the team’s focus.\n\n\n**22/5 at 18:13**\nAs early as 18:13, the next attack started with the same modus operandi as earlier in the day.\nAgain, the team worked long after normal working hours to help the member out with the\nattackers and, around 20, the member did cut off the internet connection to go into island\noperation.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\nIt later proved necessary to completely replace the firewall to get the attackers out, and the\nold one thus never came into operation again.\nIn approx. for a day there was silence from the attackers.\n\n**23/5 at 18:43**\nBut on 23 May at 18:43 came the next attack where a new member was compromised. Here\nthe attackers managed to exploit the member’s infrastructure to participate in a brute force\nattack via SSH against a company in Canada before SektorCERT, together with the member,\nstopped the attack.\n\n\n**24/5**\nOn May 24th came the announcement from Zyxel that the two new vulnerabilities had been\nidentified (CVE-2023-33009 and CVE-2023-33010). It also meant that this knowledge was now\navailable to all the world’s hackers, who, however, still had to develop the attacks themselves\n\n- the so-called exploits.\n\n**24/5 at 10:27**\nWhen the next member was attacked on May 24 at 10:27, we could see that the member’s\nZyxel firewall picked up 4 different payloads.\nIt is SektorCERT’s assessment that the attackers tried different payloads to see what would\nwork best, which is why several different ones were downloaded. They subsequently used,\namong other things, the access to carry out DDoS attacks from the member against various\ntargets before SektorCERT could manage to stop the attack in cooperation with the member.\n\n\n**24/5 at 10:31 - 10:58**\nOver a period of 17 minutes, 3 more members were compromised and a payload named\nMIPSkiller was used in all cases, and all three members’ firewalls were then used to\nparticipate in attacks against other targets.\nIn a single case, with such volume that the firewall became overloaded and could no longer\nfunction, causing both attacks – and the member’s network – to stop working.\n\nFor the next five hours, there was a lull in the attacks, giving SektorCERT time to establish new\nrules to ensure that future attacks could be better identified before another member was\ncompromised in the afternoon.\n\n\n**24/5 at 15:59**\nAt 15:59 came the next attack, this time using different payloads than before and the\nmember was then included in the well-known Mirai Moobot network.\n\nWhat was a bit special about this attack was that the member didn’t think they had a Zyxel\nfirewall. But after a thorough investigation after SektorCERT’s call, it turned out that a supplier\nhad used a Zyxel firewall in connection with the installation of cameras and that it was this\nfirewall that had now been attacked.\n\n\nIt was notable for these second-wave attacks that the attackers may have had knowledge of\nvulnerabilities that Zyxel had not yet disclosed. It could indicate that one or more attackers\nthese days were in possession of cyber weapons that few others knew about and which were\ntherefore very difficult to detect.\n\n\nOften an attacker will be very careful about where these weapons are used. Because once\nthe weapon is discovered, defenses against them can quickly be developed.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n**The unthinkable**\n\n**24/5 at 19:02**\nOn 24 May at 19:02 one of the alarms, that we at SektorCERT never expected to see, went\noff.\nIt is an alarm that notifies us if we see traffic to or from one of the known APT groups.\n\n\nOne of the best and most well-known APT group is Sandworm. A group which, under the\nRussian GRU unit, has carried out some of the most sophisticated attacks against industrial\ncontrol systems ever seen. Among other things, Sandworm was behind the destructive\nattack against Ukraine in 2015\nand 2016, where hundreds of\nthousands of citizens were left **APT**\nwithout power as a consequence Attack groups, which with almost infinite resources and\nof the cyber attack. often with a state behind them, take their time, are\n\ncareful and are very skilled.\n\nIn SektorCERT’s three years of\noperation, we have never seen These groups are called APT groups for Advanced,\nsigns that these APT groups Persistent Threat.\nhave attacked Danish, critical\ninfrastructure. Their activities\ntend to be reserved for goals that the states, they work for, want to disrupt due to various\npolitical or military considerations.\n\n\nWhen an alarm goes off, it is not necessarily because something is wrong. It is a so-called\n_indicator. A sign that something is worth investigating further._\nFortunately, at SektorCERT, we have a solid data base to do just that – to investigate what is\nthe basis of alarms. Not just at the individual company – but across a sector or even several\nsectors.\nThis work is time-consuming, but necessary, in order to create an overview of what the\nattackers have done prior to an attack, as well as who the targets have been and how\nthe attack was carried out. As well as – most importantly – whether the attack has been\nsuccessful.\n\nUsually there are large amounts of data to work with. An attack requires preparation,\nreconnaissance, execution, pursuit and more (see Cyber Kill Chain on page 27).\n\n\nBut not this time.\nTucked away among the billions of other network packets SektorCERT received from the\nsensor network that day, the attackers sent only a single packet back after the compromise.\n’One ping only’ as one of the analysts observed, with reference to the film The Hunt for Red\nOctober.\nIt was highly unusual and was in all likelihood a maneuver designed for one thing: to avoid\ndetection.\nIt is roughly equivalent to hiding a grain of sugar in a sandbag. A grain of sugar that we had\nfound and now had to find out why – and how – had been hidden there.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat the analysts at SektorCERT had specifically observed was that there was traffic to\n217.57.80[.]18 on port 10049 over the protocol TCP. And that this traffic consisted of one\nnetwork packet of 1340 bytes and that no response was returned. ’One ping only’.\nWe had reliable information that this IP address belonged to the Sandworm group, which\nhad been using it actively approx. a year earlier. From other sources, it was validated that the\nIP address had continued to be used by the group just a few months earlier.\nIt is therefore possible that this was communication back to Sandworm.\n\n**25/5 at 01:22**\nThe situation repeated itself at 01:22 in the night between May 24 and 25 when a new\nmember was attacked. And this time, too, the attackers sent a single packet to another\nsuspected Sandworm server: 70.62.153[.]174 on port 20600 over protocol TCP.\n\n\nAgain, it was a single packet of 1340 bytes. In contrast to the attack at 19:02 this attack had\nhowever, major, visible consequences for the member. It was only something we became\naware of at 11:45 when the member reported that they had lost all visibility to three remote\nlocations and that the firewall was subsequently completely out of order.\nThey started manually driving out to all remote locations to handle the manual operation.\nA situation that was handled both professionally and with a bit of good, Danish humor (”It’s\ngood weather to drive in”, as the operational manager stated).\nSince this firewall also functioned as an internal router for the OT network, this meant that all\ninternal traffic in the production network also stopped working at the member.\n\n**25/5 at 7:55 - 8:22**\nBefore the morning was over, there were two more attacks which did not follow the ”recipe”\nfrom the previous two. In these new attacks, which came at 7:55 and 8:22, many different\npayloads were used, which were attempted to be retrieved several times. That gave us an\nindication that it might be another attacker.\nIn the attack, there was no communication back to infrastructure that could be related to\nSandworm, which again suggests that it was a different attacker or a different grouping from\nthe same attacker.\n\n\nThe attacks were similar, but the last attack at 8:22 had the complexity that the member\nchose not to patch his firewall afterwards. This resulted in repeatedly compromises of the\nmember by several different attackers in the following days.\n\n\n**25/5 at 12:00**\nBased on the possible involvement of Sandworm and the concrete consequences for the\noperation of Danish, critical infrastructure, SektorCERT took at 12 contact to both the police’s\nNational Center for Cybercrime (NC3) and the Center for Cyber Security. At the same time,\nSektorCERT sent out analysts to the member to gather as much information as possible.\nIt was agreed with the member that all connections to the Internet were shut down, but that\nthe firewall continued to run to ensure that any malware in memory was not deleted when it\nwas turned off.\nDue to the seriousness of the attack, the member chose to order a new firewall from the\nsupplier and therefore ended up running in island operation for 6 days as a consequence.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the coming days, SektorCERT worked closely with the police to collect malware code and\ncreate an overview of the attack. NC3’s analysts subsequently began an in-depth analysis of\nthe malware that SektorCERT had collected.\n\nAt the same time, information about the new attacks was shared on SektorForum where\nSektorCERT again called for patching firewalls.\n\n\n**30/5**\nAfter the exploit code for some of the vulnerabilities became publicly known around 30/5,\nattack attempts against the Danish critical infrastructure exploded - especially from IP\naddresses in Poland and Ukraine.\nWhere previously individual, selected companies were targeted, now everyone was shot with\na hail of bullets - including firewalls that were not vulnerable.\nHowever, it had no consequences for SektorCERT’s members, who by this time had taken the\nnecessary measures to protect themselves and were therefore no longer vulnerable to these\nattack attempts.\n\n\n**31/5**\nThe recommendations were repeated at SektorCERT’s monthly call with our members on\n31/5, where more than 100 members participated.\n\n**Reflection**\nWhether Sandworm was involved in the attack cannot be said with certainty. Individual indicators\nof this have been observed, but we have no opportunity to neither confirm nor deny it.\n\n\nA situation which as such is not unusual. Cyber attacks are notoriously difficult to attribute to a\nspecific attacker and often it is small, almost insignificant errors from the attacker that can indicate\nwho the attacker may be.\nThere is therefore no evidence to accuse Russia of being involved in the attack. The only thing we\ncan ascertain is that Danish critical infrastructure is in the spotlight and that cyber weapons are\nbeing used against our infrastructure, which require careful monitoring and advanced analysis to\ndetect.\nAnd that the only thing that saved the infrastructure in this case was that SektorCERT, in\ncooperation with the members and suppliers, managed to react quickly so that the attackers could\nbe stopped before their access could be used to damage the critical infrastructure.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### C O N C L U T I O N A N D R E C O M M A N D A T I O N S\n\nBased on our analysis of the case, SektorCERT has drawn up a\n\nconclusion and a number of recommendations.\n\nThe purpose of the conclusion is to highlight both what has worked\n\nwell and the areas where there is room for improvement.\n\nThe recommendations are made to help prevent future attacks from\n\nhaving major consequences for the Danish critical infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclution\n\nSektorCERT’s conclusion on the attack is the following:\n\n\n**Systemic vulnerabilities**\nDenmark has a highly decentralized energy system with many, smaller operators. Often an\nattack against one of these operators will therefore not be critical for society.\nWe have long been concerned about “systemic vulnerabilities”. In other words, a situation\nwhere the same vulnerability exists in many companies and thus creates a potentially critical\nsituation for society if the vulnerability is exploited across companies.\nThat is exactly what we saw happening here. And it is something that we, as a society, should\nprobably focus more on as the consequences can be great.\n\n**Visibility across**\nSome attacks - like the one we describe here in this report - can be carried out so that they\nare very difficult to detect. In SektorCERT, we do not look at one company’s data, but across\nhundreds of companies’ data. This way we can - as here - detect when someone tries to\nattack several companies at the same time and we can thus create an insight that is not\npossible when the companies are monitored individually.\nThis monitoring across a sector - and across sectors - helps to ensure that we can also detect\nand respond to attacks with many, simultaneous targets in the future.\n\n\n**Constant attacks**\nDanish, critical infrastructure is under constant cyber attack from foreign actors. Therefore,\neveryone who runs critical infrastructure should pay extra attention and ensure that the right\nmeasures are taken to be able to prevent, detect and deal with these attacks.\n\n**Possible consequences**\nHad SektorCERT not been there to detect the attacks and quickly shut down the attackers’\naccess, the consequences of these attacks could have been far more serious.\nHad the attackers been allowed to maintain their access, they could have taken control of\nthe operation of large parts of Danish critical infrastructure, which could have had large\nconsequences for society.\n\n\n**Cooperation**\nThe cooperation between SektorCERT and our members and their suppliers, as well as with\nthe police department NC3, has worked excellently and contributed to the fact that the\nattacks have had minimal consequences for the critical infrastructure.\n\n\n**State actor**\nThere are indications that state actors may have been involved in attacks against Denmark.\nHowever, it is outside SektorCERT’s area of responsibility to consider any geopolitical\nconsequences of this.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### Recommendations\n\nBased on SektorCERT’s analysis above of the attack waves against 22 Danish energy companies,\nwe have the following recommendations for all companies that operate critical infrastructure:\n\n\n**Generally: Implement SektorCERT’s 25 recommendations**\nBased on our knowledge of both actors and our knowledge of cyber security within critical infra­\nstructure, SektorCERT has made 25 general recommendations for technical and organizational\nmeasures that all companies should implement.\n\nSpecifically for the attacks mentioned in this report, the focus should be on the following. The\nfigures refer to SektorCERT’s recommendation from the ”Handbook on SektorCERT’s Threat\nAssessments”.\n\n\n###### 2\n\n\n###### 10\n\n\n**Exposure of services**\nSince the vulnerabilities concerned specific services (including VPN), it is important to ensure\nthat only the services that are needed are exposed to the Internet\n\n**Update**\nIn relation to the first attack wave, Zyxel had warned in advance about the vulnerabilities and\ndelivered patches. It is therefore important to ensure that the internal processes for receiving\ninformation about vulnerabilities and ensuring that the systems are patched are in place\n\n\n###### 12\n\n\n###### 13\n\n\n**Contingency plan**\nOnce the damage has occurred and the systems have been compromised, it is important to\nhave a plan in place for how it will be handled. In the specific cases, several members had to\ngo into island operation. A well-described and rehearsed contingency plan can ensure that\nthe right decisions are made quickly and efficiently and that damage is thus limited.\n\n**Log collection**\nIn order to detect attacks, it is important to collect and analyze logs. In some cases, however,\nit is not enough to look at your own logs. Certain attacks are best detected by looking across\nan entire sector. SektorCERT provides services for this on both networks and systems.\n\n\n###### 15\n\n\n###### 16\n\n\n**Map network inputs**\nSeveral of the members we spoke to in connection with these attacks did not know about the\nnetworks that were attacked. It is therefore important to ensure that all network inputs to the\nOT systems have been mapped.\n\n**Segmentation**\nSometimes it is not possible to protect all systems - for example against vulnerabilities that\nare not yet known about. Therefore, it is important to have segmented the network so that\nyou can “seize” the attacks behind the systems that are exposed to the Internet.\n\n\n###### 17\n\n\n**Identify devices**\nIndividual members did not know about the devices that were attacked (often because a\nvendor had set up the devices). Thus they were not patched either. It is important to identify\nall devices on the network, otherwise the attackers will find ways inside that you don’t know\nabout.\n\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 22\n\n\n###### 24\n\n\n**Supplier management**\nSeveral of the mentioned attacks could be performed because there was lack of clarity\nbetween the members and the suppliers regarding agreements on, for example, updating\nfirewalls. Close cooperation - and good agreements - with the suppliers is important to\nensure a secure infrastructure.\n\n**Emergency procedures**\nA single member were in island operation for 6 days. It requires good emergency\nprocedures for the business-critical processes to maintain operations under such\nconditions. At the same time, it requires good, well-integrated procedures to handle the\ntransition to island operation.\n\n\n###### 25\n\n\n**Vulnerability scans**\nWhen vulnerabilities become publicly known, they can often be identified via vulnerability\nscans. Some of the members who were attacked thought their firewalls had been patched\nwhen they were not. A vulnerability scan would have revealed this and can therefore\nact as an additional validation of whether things are as they should be and whether any\nagreements with suppliers about updates are being respected.\n\n\n**Stay informed on SektorForum**\nIf you are a member of SektorCERT, make sure you follow SektorForum every day, so that you\nare constantly aware of new threats and recommendations.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### T I M E L I N E\n\nThe timeline for the attacks goes through, minute by minute, the\n\nactual attack against the Danish critical infrastructure.\n\nOnly the facts are described here: the things we know happened,\n\nbased on direct observations. The timeline therefore contains no\n\nanalyzes or assessments of the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Timeline of the attacks\n\nIn what follows, a chronological review of the attacks is given, where only the actual attacks are\ndescribed. This part of the report is objective.\n\n\nThe timeline covers from 25/4-2023 to 2/6-2023.\nPrior to this, SektorCERT called on members several times in 2022, to ensure that Zyxel\nfirewalls in particular were continuously patched due to previous vulnerabilities in these\ndevices and because SektorCERT is aware that these types of devices are widely used in the\nsectors.\n\n**25/4**\nZyxel announced that a critical vulnerability had been found in a number of their products.\n\n\n**1/5**\nSektorCERT issued an additional warning to install the latest update.\n\n**11/5 (the first 11 attacks)**\n16 companies were attempted to be attacked by one or more attackers using CVE-202328771. A specially formatted network packet was used on port 500 against the firewall’s VPN\nservice. 11 of the companies were successfully compromised. The other 5 did not end up\ncompleting the commands.\n\n\nFor the 11 that were compromised, the firewalls in question contacted the IP address\n46.8.198.196 on port 8080/8081. From here they received the following command:\nzysh -p 100 -e ’show username’;zysh -p 100 -e ’show running-config’\nThis command was intended to retrieve the firewall’s configuration and current usernames.\nInformation about the attacks was shared on SektorForum.\n\n\n**22/5 at 14:44 (attack number 12)**\nSektorCERT\nobser­\nved that a\nmember was\ndownloading\nnew software\nfor their\nfirewall over\nan insecure\nconnection.\n\nOur data showed that 2 different files were downloaded:\n\n\nThe handling of the alarms on 22/5\n\n\nURL = http://45.89.106[.]147:8080/mpsl\nMD5 = 5b0f10b36a240311305f7ef2bd19c810\n\n\nURL = http://45.89.106[.]147:8080/mips\nMD5 = 9a7823686738571abf19707613155012\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\nThese files were new software for Zyxel firewalls that changed how the member’s firewalls\nworked. A few minutes later, SektorCERT could observe that the firewall in question began to\nbehave as if it were part of the known Mirai botnet.\n\nIt was confirmed when the firewall started communicating with a server named ”www.joshan[.]\npro” which had the IP address 185.44.81[.]147.\nThis address belongs to Panama and had been created only 3 weeks before. The IP address\nbelongs to France.\n\n\nThe communication took place on port 56999 over the protocol TCP. An address and a port\ncombination that is known to handle so-called ”Command & Control” traffic in relation to the\nvariant of Mirai called MooBot.\n\nSektorCERT could observe that the member immediately afterwards participated in DDoS\nattacks with two goals:\nThe first goal in Hong Kong: 156.241.86[.]2\nThe second goal in the United States: 63.79.171[.]112\n\n\n**22/5 at 15**\nFollowing the recommendation of SektorCERT, the member shut down their internet\nconnection completely and went into island operation.\n\n**22/5 at 18:13 (attack number 13)**\nAnother member was attacked with the same modus operandi as earlier in the day. This\nmember also went into island operation.\n\n\n**22/5 at 20:01**\nInformation about the attacks was shared on SektorForum.\n\n**23/5 at 18:43 (attack number 14)**\nA new member was attacked. The attackers exploited the member’s infrastructure to engage\nin a brute force attack via SSH against a company in Canada.\n\n\n**24/5 at 9**\nSektorCERT, together with the member, stopped the attack that started at 18:43 the day befo­\nre.\n\n**24/5 at 10**\nZyxel announced two new vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-33009 and CVE-2023-33010)..\n\n\n**24/5 at 10:27 (attack number 15)**\nThe next member was attacked. This time, SektorCERT could observe that the member’s Zyxel\nfirewall retrieved 4 different payloads:\n\n    - http://145.239.54[.]169/mipskiller\n\n    - http://176.124.32[.]84/mipskiller\n\n    - http://185.180.223[.]48/mipskiller\n\n    - http://91.235.234[.]81/proxy2\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n**24/5 at 10:31 (attack number 16)**\nAnother member was attacked.\nThis time the following payload was used:\n\n- http://176.124.32[.]84/mipskiller\n\nAgain, the attackers used their access to the infrastructure to let the member participate in a\nDDoS attack.\n\n\n**24/5 at 10:33 (attack number 17)**\nA new member was attacked using exactly the same recipe and using the same payload. And\nagain, the attackers used their access to let the member participate in DDoS attacks.\n\n**24/5 at 10:58 (attack number 18)**\nAnother attack on a member. Here, the attackers downloaded the same payload three times\nwithin 30 minutes:\n\n- http://176.124.32[.]84/mipskiller\n\n- http://145.239.54[.]169/mipskiller\n\n- http://185.180.223[.]48/mipskiller\n\n\nAgain, the attackers used their access to make the member part of a DDoS attack against\nother companies.\n\n**24/5 at 15:59 (attack number 19)**\nAnother member was attacked. A number of new payloads were tried here:\n\n- http://205.147.101[.]170:82/fuckjewishpeople.mips\n\n- http://45.89.106[.]147:8080/mips\n\n- http://45.89.106[.]147:8080/mpsl\n\n- http://45.128.232[.]143/bins/paraiso.mips\n\n- http://45.128.232[.]143/bins/libcurl1337.mips\n\n\nThis time there was communication with a Command and Control server at the address\n185.44.81[.]147 on port 56999 over the protocol TCP. A server we know, as part of the Mirai\nMoobot network.\n\n**24/5 at 19:02**\nSektorCERT observed traffic to 217.57.80[.]18 on port 10049 over protocol TCP. The traffic\nconsisted of one network packet of 1340 bytes and no response was returned. This IP\naddress previously belonged to the Sandworm group.\n\n\n**24/5 at 01:22 (attack number 20)**\nA new member attacked. And this time, too, the attackers sent a single packet to another\nsuspected Sandworm server:\n70.62.153[.]174 on port 20600 over protocol TCP.\n\n\nAgain, it was a single packet of 1340 bytes.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n**25/5 at 7:55 (attack number 21)**\nAnother member was attacked.\nMany payloads were used here, and many of these payloads were attempted to be retrieved\nseveral times. The different payloads were:\n\n- http://145.239.54[.]169/mipskiller\n\n- http://205.147.101[.]170:82/fuckjewishpeople.mips\n\n- http://45.128.232[.]143/bins/libcurl1337.mips\n\n- http://45.128.232[.]143/bins/paraiso.mips\n\n- http://45.89.106[.]147:8080/mips\n\n- http://45.89.106[.]147:8080/mpsl\n\nAgain, Command and Control communication was established with 185.44.81[.]147 on port\n56999 over protocol TCP, and again the attackers used the member’s infrastructure to engage\nin attacks against others.\n\n\n**25/5 at 8:22 (attack number 22)**\nAnother attack against a member that was compromised and a single payload was used:\nhttp://91.235.234[.]251/proxy1\n\nOtherwise, the attack was very similar to the attack at 7:55 on the same day.\n\n\n**25/5 at 11:45**\nThe affected member on 5/24 at 01:22 reported that they had lost all visibility to three remote\nlocations and that the firewall was subsequently completely down.\n\n**25/5 at 12:00**\nBased on the possible involvement of Sandworm and the concrete consequences for the\noperation of Danish critical infrastructure, at 12.00 SektorCERT contacted both the police’s\nNational Center for Cybercrime (NC3) and the Center for Cyber Security.\nAt the same time, SektorCERT sent out analysts to the member to gather as much information\nas possible.\n\n\n**25/5 at 16:01**\nInformation about the new attacks was shared on SektorForum, where SektorCERT again\ncalled for patching firewalls.\n\n**26/5 at 10:07**\nSektorCERT informed on SektorForum as well as to authorities about the attacks and related\nrecommendations.\n\n\n**30/5**\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the United States chose to\nplace these vulnerabilities from Zyxel on the list of vulnerabilities that were actively exploited\nby attackers. This happened because it had been observed that the attackers had now\ndeveloped so-called ”exploit code” which made it possible to carry out the attack and that\nseveral attack groups were in the process of attacking companies which were still vulnerable.\nThe fact that the exploit code was now publicly available meant that any attacker could now\ntake the code and use it directly.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\nThe result was that the attack attempts against the Danish critical infrastructure exploded especially from IP addresses in Poland and Ukraine. SektorCERT saw around 200,000 attack\nattempts per day against CVE-2023-28771 against our members.\nShots were fired here - also against members whose firewalls were not vulnerable.\n\n**31/5 at 8:52**\nSektorCERT informed on SektorForum about the attacks.\n\n\n**31/5 at 13:00**\nSektorCERTs held a monthly call with our members, where the recommendations were\nrepeated.\n\n\n**2/6**\nZyxel came out with a warning, where they said that there were active attacks in progress\nagainst companies with Zyxel firewalls and recommended here, too, to install the latest\npatches.\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cyber Kill Chain for the overall attack\n\nThe Cyber Kill Chain is an international standard for describing the steps necessary to carry\nout a successful cyber attack.\n\n\nThe Cyber Kill Chain describes the seven stages that a cyber attack can go through.\nBelow is the Cyber Kill Chain for the overall attack described in this report.\n\n**Reconnaissance**\n\n**..............................................** **1**\n\nWe do not know how\nthe attackers had the\nnecessary information,\nbut we can state that **Weaponization**\namong 300 members they **2** **..............................................**\ndid not miss their target a Based on knowledge of\nsingle time. the vulnerabilities, the\n\nattackers developed so\n**Delivery** called exploit code that\n\n**..............................................** **3** could be executed on the vulnerable Zyxel devices.\n\nIn many cases, a specially\nformatted network\npacket is sent on port 500\ntowards the firewall’s VPN **Exploitation**\nservice. **4** **..............................................**\n\n\n**Installation**\n\n**..............................................** **5**\n\nFrom the server, various\n_payloads were installed_\non the now compromised\nfirewalls which ensured\nthat the attackers had\ncontrol of the firewall.\n\n**Actions**\n\n**..............................................** **7**\n\nIn all but one case, the\nfirewall could still be used\nby the member. Therefore, it\nwas not necessarily easy to\ndiscover that the attackers\nwere using the firewall for\nother purposes, which is why\nthe attackers’ access could be\nmaintained.\n\n\nThe network packet\ncontains instructions for\n\nthe firewall to contact\nthe attacker’s server and\n\nexecute additional code.\n\n**Exploitation**\n\n**..............................................**\n\nAmong other things, these\n\npayloads ensure that\ncontact is established with\n\nthe attackers via so-called\n\nCommand & Control\n\nchannels.\n\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### A P P E N D I X\n\nThe observed IOCs, the mentioned CVEs and relevant links are\n\ncollected here.\n\n\n-----\n\n### IOCs\n\nThe following IOCs have been observed (see also the Timeline):\n\n\n**Files**\nhttp://45.89.106[.]147:8080/mpsl (MD5 = 5b0f10b36a240311305f7ef2bd19c810)\nhttp://45.89.106[.]147:8080/mips (MD5 = 9a7823686738571abf19707613155012)\nhttp://145.239.54[.]169/mipskiller\nhttp://176.124.32[.]84/mipskiller\nhttp://185.180.223[.]48/mipskiller\nhttp://91.235.234[.]81/proxy2\nhttp://205.147.101[.]170:82/fuckjewishpeople.mips\nhttp://45.128.232[.]143/bins/paraiso.mips\nhttp://45.128.232[.]143/bins/libcurl1337.mips\nhttp://91.235.234[.]251/proxy1\n\n**Domains**\nwww.joshan[.]pro\n\n\n**IP addresses**\n45.89.106[.]147\n145.239.54[.]169\n176.124.32[.]84\n185.180.223[.]48\n91.235.234[.]81\n205.147.101[.]170\n45.128.232[.]143\n91.235.234[.]251\n46.8.198[.]196\n156.241.86[.]2\n185.44.81[.]147\n63.79.171[.]112\n217.57.80[.]18\n70.62.153[.]174\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### CVEs\n\nDescription of the CVEs mentioned in the report.\n\n\n**CVE-2023-28771**\nZyxel itself describes the vulnerability as follows:\n_Improper error message handling in some firewall versions could allow an unauthenticated attack­_\n_er to execute some OS commands remotely by sending crafted packets to an affected device_\nThe vulnerability received a score of 9.8 out of 10\n\n**CVE-2023-33009**\nZyxel itself describes the vulnerability as follows:\n_A buffer overflow vulnerability in the notification function in some firewall versions could allow an_\n_unauthenticated attacker to cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions and even a remote code execu­_\n_tion on an affected device_\nThe vulnerability received a score of 9.8 out of 10\n\n\n**CVE-2023-33010**\nZyxel itself describes the vulnerability as follows:\n_A buffer overflow vulnerability in the ID processing function in some firewall versions could allow an unau­_\n_thenticated attacker to cause DoS conditions and even a remote code execution on an affected device._\nThe vulnerability received a score of 9.8 out of 10\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### Links\n\nLinks to relevant articles about the Zyxel vulnerabilities:\n\n\n\n- https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/researchers-tell-owners-to-as­\nsume-compromise-of-unpatched-zyxel-firewalls/\n\n- https://www.zyxel.com/global/en/support/security-advisories/zyxel-security-adviso­\nry-for-multiple-buffer-overflow-vulnerabilities-of-firewalls\n\n\n\n- https://www.zyxel.com/global/en/support/security-advisories/zyxels-guidance-for-the-re­\ncent-attacks-on-the-zywall-devices\n\n**SEKTOR** CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n### Contact us\n\n**Contact SectorCERT**\n**on the following number:**\n\n+45 88327140\n\n**If you have any questions about or to SektorCERT,**\n**you are also welcome to send an email:**\n\ninfo@SektorCERT.dk\n\n**PGP key:**\n\nC2EF 6314 7860 2B1E 2341 ACF4 DBC3 511D 3D06 BB3A\n\n**Visiting and mailing addresses:**\n\nSommerfuglevej 2A Bredgade 45\n6000 Kolding 1260 København K\n\n\n-----",
