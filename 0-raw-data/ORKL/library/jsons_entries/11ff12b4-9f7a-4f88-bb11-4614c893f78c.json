What started out as a somewhat limited attack surface more than a decade ago\nhas grown into a vast landscape of devices utilizing the iOS and Android operating systems.\nThese devices include mobile phones, tablets, televisions, medical devices, alarm systems, and\npoint-of-sale credit card payment systems, among others.\n\nMobile platforms are primed for exploitation by governments engaged in espionage. They provide\na quick, all-in-one means to acquire sensitive data from precisely chosen targets. Mobile phones\ntoday offer access to user location, contacts, email, texts and instant messaging, as well as\nencrypted communication applications and business files. Mobile devices also often bridge the\ngap between a target’s professional and personal lives.\n\n### Targeted mobile espionage campaigns complement traditional computer network, human, and signals intelligence efforts and play to the advantage of governments stuck in an asymmetrical power imbalance with other nations. They also offer something traditional espionage means do not: plausible deniability and a lighter attack footprint.\n\nBecause of these advantages, the market for exploits targeting mobile devices has skyrocketed.\nAs of this publication, the going rate for a zero-click exploit for the Android operating system\nhas hit $2.5 million dollars, while zero-click iPhone exploits have dropped to $1 million dollars\n(Greenberg, 2019). These nosebleed prices are reflective of the increasing difficulty of producing\nreliable exploits given the significant financial and technological investments in security by\nsmartphone manufacturers over the past several years. Yet, difficult does not mean impossible.\n\nIndeed, the sheer scale of mobile malware that is in-use by state or state-sponsored APT groups\nthat BlackBerry researchers observed in producing this report and the ease with which this mobile\nmalware has been interwoven with desktop malware campaigns, shows definitively that at least\nseveral nation states have overcome that barrier.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n##### Mobile Malware and APT Espionage:  Prolific, Pervasive, and Cross-Platform\n\nUntil now, the public’s exposure to mobile phone malware has been dominated by news about\nthe privately run “greyware” vendors who have made headlines for being purveyors of spyware\ntools. These commercial smartphone spyware tools reportedly end up in the hands of autocrats\nwho use it to hamper free speech, quash dissent, or worse. Consumers of these news stories are\noften left with the impression that mobile malware is just something paranoid dictators purchase\nfor use within their own borders in remote third world nations. It is not.\n\nIn this report, BlackBerry researchers reveal what the focus on those groups has overshadowed:\nseveral governments with well-established cyber capabilities have long ago adapted to and\nexploited the mobile threat landscape for a decade or more. In this context, mobile malware is\nnot a new or niche effort, but a longstanding part of a cross-platform strategy integrated with\ntraditional desktop malware in diverse ways across the geopolitical sphere.\n\nThis approach has allowed state and state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups\nto exploit a mobile dimension for espionage campaigns with impunity. Low threat detection\nrates and a false sense of security have made mobile users an easy target. Given an immature\nmarket, security solutions intended to block mobile malware are few in number, forensic access\nto smartphones remains relatively limited, and existing public research into the mobile malware\nthreat posed by governments has been scattershot at best and maladroit at worst.\n\nIn the pages that follow, BlackBerry researchers expose several previously unknown attack\ncampaigns conducted by APTs both familiar and newly identified. The research will also\nexamine some already known, ongoing, targeted operations and reveal new intelligence and\nconnections that fill in existing gaps in previously published research. This report also represents\na broader survey of the strategic use of mobile malware by the Chinese, Iranians, Vietnamese,\nNorth Koreans, and two other unknown but likely state-sponsored groups targeting Pakistan’s\ngovernment and military.\n\nThrough this research, the researchers seek to redefine the meaning of “state-sponsored APT” in\nregard to threats targeting mobile devices and further define the notion of a Golden Age of APT\n_Mobile Malware that dawned long ago with little notice, yet through persistence and pervasiveness_\ncontinues to impact us all today.\n\nThis report provides a detailed survey of the strategic and tactical use of mobile malware by\nvarious governments. It attempts to fill in gaps in earlier research on the subject of mobile\nmalware, and identifies and names new malware, new campaigns, and new threat actors — all of\nwhich yields a new and redefined understanding of nation-state APT operations. The conclusions\ndrawn here are intelligence assessments representing judgments based on available data.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Key Findings\n\n##### Strategic Intelligence Assessments:\n\n - A collection of established state or state-sponsored APT groups acting in the interests of\nthe Chinese, Vietnamese, North Korean, and Iranian governments have demonstrated the\ncapability to develop native Android and/or iOS mobile malware. The malware is employed\nin both stand-alone campaigns targeting mobile devices as well as incorporated into crossplatform mobile/desktop espionage campaigns. This activity has been ongoing for a decade\nor more but has only recently garnered attention.\n\n  - Many of the government mobile espionage efforts examined had roots in campaigns\ndesigned to spy on targets of interest of some of the nations covered in this report for\npolitical purposes. Yet, we have also observed these APT groups pivot to traditional foreign\nintelligence and/or economic espionage targets. This suggests a more mature, un-siloed\nand collaborative effort inside different government entities where tools, infrastructure, and\nintelligence are being shared.\n\n  - The ability of state and state-sponsored APT groups to develop and deploy mobile\nsurveillance campaigns within their existing cyber espionage efforts has outpaced the\nsecurity industry’s ability to detect and deter this malware on the endpoints.\n\n##### Tactical Intelligence Assessments:\n\n - A recent mobile espionage campaign against targets of interest can be traced back to the\nChinese state-sponsored APT group known under the umbrella term WINNTI, known for\ndesktop malware campaigns targeting global gaming companies, pharmaceutical giants,\nindustrial manufacturing, chemical companies, and the United States defense industrial base.\n\n  - The earliest documented mobile campaign against targets of interest is connected to desktop\nespionage campaigns by a Chinese state or state-sponsored APT BlackBerry researchers\nrefer to as BBCY-TA1 (a.k.a. IRON HUSKY). This group’s targets also include the Russian\nmilitary and ongoing surveillance of the Mongolian government.\n\n - Another early mobile campaign against targets of interest can be attributed to the Chinese\n[state or state-sponsored APT known as REAVER (a.k.a. SUTR), whose previously observed](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/reaver-mapping-connections-between-disparate-chinese-apt-groups.html)\ncampaigns involve desktop malware and a range of Western economic and government\nespionage targets. Several other well-known Chinese APT groups, including LOTUS BLOSSOM\nand SCARLET MIMIC, are also linked to this activity.\n\n  - Targets of interest are the focus of a cross-platform (mobile and desktop malware)\nespionage campaign utilizing newly identified malware families for Android and Windows\nthat BlackBerry researchers dubbed PWNDROID3 and PWNWIN1. This is the work of a\nnewly identified Chinese state or state-sponsored APT group BlackBerry researchers have\ndubbed BBCY-TA2 conducting a newly identified campaign BlackBerry researchers dubbed\nOPERATION DUALCRYPTOEX. The group shares infrastructure with another newly identified\nChinese state or state-sponsored APT group BlackBerry researchers have dubbed BBCY-TA3\nwhich is engaged in economic espionage and whose targets include a range of Western and\nSouth Asian commercial enterprises in telecommunications and chemical manufacturing\nin nearly every major chemical manufacturing company in the world outside China, with\nparticular interest in companies based in Germany, the U.S., and Canada.\n\n\n-----\n\n- In fewer than three years, the Iranian effort to add mobile surveillance capabilities underwent\ndrastic improvement in terms of the quality and complexity of its Android malware, the\nsophistication of its socially engineered delivery mechanisms, the ability to pivot between\ndomestic and foreign target sets, and the implantation of a cross-platform strategy that\nintegrates mobile and desktop malware.\n\n- North Korea (DPRK) has at least two APT groups, LAZARUS and SCARCRUFT, engaged in\nespionage campaigns with a mobile dimension. In one campaign, it appears that SCARCRUFT\ninexplicably engaged in false-flag activity designed to implicate LAZARUS.\n\n- Vietnam’s OCEANLOTUS (a.k.a. APT32) has been conducting isolated mobile operations\nsince at least early 2014, predating the identification and examination of the group.\n\n- A newly identified OCEANLOTUS espionage campaign BlackBerry researchers have dubbed\nOPERATION OCEANMOBILE has both a mobile and a desktop dimension. The newly\nidentified mobile malware family, which BlackBerry researchers have dubbed PWNDROID1,\nis obfuscated to escape detection and is propagated via fake apps made available on\nlegitimate app stores by way of elaborately concocted cover stories as well as through\nwell-known third-party app stores.\n\n- The Pakistani government is the target of a newly identified and ongoing espionage campaign\nBlackBerry researchers have dubbed OPERATION DUALPAK which is employing newly\nidentified malware BlackBerry researchers have dubbed PWNDROID2. BlackBerry researchers\ndetermined the campaign to be the work of a likely state-sponsored APT group known as\nBITTER. The malware was propagated via fake apps and elaborate phishing schemes that\nmimic real entities including Pornhub Premium and the Ansar Foundation.\n\n- The Pakistani military, other government agencies and their officials were also the subject\nof a concurrent espionage campaign employing both mobile and desktop components\nBlackBerry researchers have dubbed OPERATION DUALPAK2 which utilizes newly identified\nWindows malware family BlackBerry researchers have dubbed PWNWIN2. BlackBerry\nresearchers determined this effort to be the work of another state-sponsored APT group\nknown as CONFUCIUS.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## China\n\nThe earliest publicly available security research detailing the use of mobile malware by a nationstate APT focused on China. The most frequent focus of Chinese mobile malware are targets of\ninterest perceived to be a potential threat to the power of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nAnalysts point out that, in attempts to influence how China is perceived both at home and abroad\nand solidify The Party’s authority, the CCP has for many years prioritized efforts to “win over” (or\nundermine) groups critical of official national narratives put forward by Beijing. That imperative\nbrought about something of a “whole of government” response involving different agencies, each\nof which is tasked with distinct but overlapping missions which eventually dovetail on similar\npolicy issues. These efforts come from different angles, but all feature some form of domestic\nespionage (Bowe, 2018).\n\nChinese state-run organizations dedicated to this effort include the overt and purportedly civilian\nUnited Front Work Department, the Ministry of State Security (an intelligence agency) that runs\ncovert operations both at home and abroad, and a section of the Chinese military engaged in\nboth overt and covert warfare that until recently was known as the Liaison Department of the\n_PLA’s General Political Department. After a 2016 reorganization of the Chinese military, it is now_\nlikely called the Central Military Commission’s Political Work Department (Bowe, 2018).\n\n### The Political Work Department and its predecessor have a long and fascinating history dating back to the 1930s and the start of World War II.\n\nAnalysts have noted that much of its work was borrowed or heavily influenced by the former\nSoviet Union’s “active measures” playbook. This branch of the Chinese military is understood to\nengage in work that “operates at the nexus of politics, finance, military operations, and intelligence\nto amplify or attenuate the political effect of the military instrument of national power,” (Stokes\n& Hsiao, 2013).\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHINA’S COMBINED THREAT:**\n**EXAMPLE 1 — RECENT TARGETING OF POLITICAL TARGETS BY WINNTI**\n\nThe mobile malware campaign efforts BlackBerry researchers observed against Chinese targets\nof interest can be understood as a single covert stage in a larger active measures influence\noperation and strategy. The question becomes: who was and is currently behind these attacks?\nMight the Political Work Department have a cyber capability and field activity groups?\n\nBlackBerry researchers examined the most recent mobile malware case to come to public\nattention: campaigns against targets of interest in diaspora via iOS and Android malware as\ndescribed by Volexity (Case, Meltzer, & Adair, 2019) and Google’s Project Zero (Beer, 2019). Google\ndid not specifically mention who was targeted, but they detailed the iOS exploits and implants\nemployed in great depth. In this campaign, mobile malware was distributed via a number of\npopular websites of interest to or only accessible to the targets of interest and their supporters\noutside of China.\n\nBlackBerry researchers found, after investigating these two reports, that the attack group behind\nthe campaign was likely not a previously unknown Chinese APT group — one who might represent\nthe hidden cyber wing of the Political Work Department. Instead we found these recent espionage\nattacks to be linked to a very familiar Chinese APT group known as WINNTI, particularly as\ndescribed in its later iteration as BURNING UMBRELLA (Hegel, 2018).\n\nWINNTI has been categorized within the security community as something of a conglomerate\nutility player working in support of the Chinese government with various, disparate targets\nin desktop malware campaigns, including global gaming companies, pharmaceutical giants,\nindustrial manufacturing, chemical companies, and the United States defense industrial base.\n\n### While WINNTI has been known to target multiple desktop platforms, including Linux, BlackBerry research reveals for the first time here that WINNTI also engages in mobile espionage campaigns. Here’s a brief description of how the connection was made:\n\n  - The IP address “142.4.50[.]213” mentioned in the Volexity report had “d.scanvpn[.]com”\nresolve to it beginning in November of 2014. We found an additional subdomain “mail.\nscanvpn[.]com” which resolved to “133.130.89[.]39” in October of 2018. The domain “mail.\nopenmd5[.]com” also resolved to this IP address beginning in June of 2018. The “openmd5[.]\ncom” domain was first registered with the email address “rooterit@outlook[.]com”. This email\naddress was used to register the following domains:\n\n - aboluewang[.]com classifyonline[.]com freesss[.]net\n\n - gistal[.]com huixunnews[.]com lycostal[.]com\n\n - openmd5[.]com openncheckmail[.]com openother[.]com\n\n - rooter[.]tk siddiq1ar[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n - “rooter[.]tk” and was previously documented by several different organizations.\n\n  - ThreatConnect observed the domains used to directly target and infect targets of interest in\n2013 as well as being used in the strategic compromise of the legitimate websites to deliver\nmalware (ThreatConnect Research Team, 2013).\n\n  - Palo Alto’s Unit42 noticed the domains were used as command-and-control servers for\nseveral “FFRAT” samples in 2015 (Flacone, Scott, & Cortes, 2015).\n\n  - Citizen Lab found the same domains were linked to an operation used to target several\nChinese language news sites in 2017 (Dalek, Alexander, & Brooks, 2017).\n\n  - “rooterit@outlook.com” more recently appeared in a larger report titled BURNING UMBRELLA\n(Hegel, 2018) providing a direct link to the WINNTI umbrella.\n\nAs demonstrated above, many different security companies had a snapshot in time of one small\npiece of the WINNTI elephant, but none possessed a complete picture. Given this APT’s consistent\nfocus on targets of interest, it should come as no surprise that this group is also continuing to\npursue China’s interests in monitoring targets of interest living abroad.\n\nThe most recent effort compliments a domestic campaign that also features a mobile dimension.\nFor several years, the Chinese government has compelled those entering the Xinjiang region in\nChina to install Android applications on their smartphones (AFP, 2017), some of which have been\nfound to have atrociously bad security (Cox, 2018), raising suspicions that they are really meant\nas backdoors focused on certain targets of interest.\n\nThe connection between the political espionage campaign and a threat actor best known for\nmilitary and economic espionage on other platforms was surprising. Analysts have written\nabout the crossover between China’s active measures effort and its wider intelligence apparatus\nsince before APT1 was named and shamed. In 2013, Mark Stokes and Russell Hsiao wrote\nabout the converging interests of the then PLA’s General Political Department or GPD (now the\n_CMC’s Political Work Department) and the Ministry of State Security (MSS). “Given common roots_\ntracing back to the 1930s,” they wrote, “GPD liaison work and MSS operations may sometimes\nbe indistinguishable,” (Stokes & Hsiao, 2013).\n\nIndeed, Stokes and Hsiao suggest that China’s political warfare unit was (and is) likely also a\nconsumer of intelligence from other units of the Chinese military, including signals and foreign\nintelligence. The crossover is understandable, as certain targets of interest are not just the focus\nof the government for domestic issues, but also for alleged counterterrorism reasons. China\nconsiders elements of some targets of interest an extremist threat to its government both at\nhome and abroad.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHINA’S COMBINED THREAT:**\n**EXAMPLE 2 — BBCY-TA1**\n\nBlackBerry researchers found that the domestic/foreign intelligence crossover is not limited to\nthe one example presented above.\n\n### The connections between China’s mobile attack campaigns aimed at specific targets of interest and traditional desktop campaigns aimed elsewhere go back to the earliest public security research detailing China’s mobile surveillance.\n\nOne report, published by Kaspersky Lab in March of 2013, was the first to document Android\nattacks against targets of interest. The attacks followed the compromise of an email account\nbelonging to a high-profile target of interest. This email account was subsequently used to send\nspear-phishing emails to the target’s contacts. One of the payloads sent in these emails was\nwritten for Android, and the subject of the email itself purported to be related to a high profile\ntarget of interest group (Baumartner, Raiu, & Maslennikov, 2013).\n\nThe Android malware did not automatically send harvested information from infected phones,\nbut instead waited until a specially crafted text message was received. Another piece of Android\nmalware (known as an APK file), also identified by Kaspersky, referenced the disputed Senkaku\nIslands/ Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, which continue to be a geopolitical flashpoint\nbetween China and Japan to this day.\n\nIn revisiting Kaspersky’s early work, BlackBerry researchers were able to connect those earliest\nattacks to a threat group active today in targeted desktop attacks aimed at the Mongolian\ngovernment. BlackBerry researchers refer to this group as BBCY-TA1. Kaspersky was the first\nto identify this group (which they called IRON HUSKY) a few years ago and documented prior\ndesktop campaigns targeting the Mongolian government as well as the Russian government and\nmilitary, but they appear not to have made the connection to the early mobile campaign against\ntargets of interest, and indeed have only published limited information on IRON HUSKY since.\n\nHere is how BlackBerry researchers identified this new connection:\n\n  - Both of the Android backdoors mentioned in the 2013 Kaspersky report communicated with\nthe IP address “64.78.161[.]133,” which was subsequently used by another malicious domain\n“www.mol-government[.]com” in July of 2014.\n\n - This domain was linked to multiple China-affiliated attacks on the Mongolian government\nand the email address “hlemonk@163[.]com” (Fagerland, 2012).\n\n  - One of the domains associated with that email address has remained operationalized\nto this day and continues to be used in isolated, targeted attacks against the Mongolian\ngovernment by BBCY-TA1.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat’s notable about this connection is that it suggests either that two Chinese APT groups with\ndifferent targets and different missions are sharing infrastructure, or that a single APT group has\nexpanded its targeting portfolio well beyond its initial scope. Both possibilities have implications\nwhich are addressed below.\n\n\n**A COMBINED THREAT: EXAMPLE 3 — REAVER**\n\n\nIn the month following the Kaspersky research on the mobile malware campaign, in April of 2013,\nCitizen Lab published research that showed a different mobile campaign had been deployed\nnearly five months prior, in December of 2012, focusing on targets of interest with trojanized\nAndroid applications. In this case, the attacker’s use of command-and-control infrastructure\nwas considerably more complex and used encoded web comments to issue commands to the\ninfected devices.\n\nAfter further investigating the Citizen Lab report, BlackBerry researchers connected the 2012\nmobile attacks on activists to several well-known, traditional desktop APT espionage groups\nincluding REAVER (aka SUTR), SCARLET MIMIC, and LOTUSBLOSSOM, whose tools notably do\nnot typically include mobile malware. Instead, REAVER and LOTUSBLOSSOM are better known\nfor Windows-based espionage campaigns linked to recent attacks on the automotive industry,\nthe defense industry, the European Union, and the United Nations.\n\n[BlackBerry researchers previously wrote about similar crossover with targets of interest](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/reaver-mapping-connections-between-disparate-chinese-apt-groups.html)\n(BlackBerry Cylance Threat Intelligence Team, 2019). BlackBerry researchers made the new\nconnection as follows:\n\n - The domain “android.uyghur.dnsd[.]me” first resolved to the IP address “184.82.123[.]143”\nnearly seven months prior in May of 2012 and changed to IP address “216.176.190[.]44” in\nSeptember of 2012, which would strongly indicate that it was likely used before December.\n\n  - The domain “internet.3-a[.]net” also resolved to both IP addresses around the same timeframe\nand was later directly attributed to SUTR by Citizen Lab. In the same vein another dynamic\nDNS domain was also connected to this one “ios.dnsd[.]info” which would indicate that iOS\ndevices were likely targeted around the same timeframe.\n\n  - Several other dynamic DNS domains linked to this early attack continued to resolve into\nthe present and connect to REAVER/SUTR, SCARLET MIMIC, and even LOTUSBLOSSOM.\n\nThis would again indicate either shared infrastructure among different APT groups with vastly\ndifferent targeting priorities, which in the BlackBerry researcher’s estimation is rare, or a single\nAPT group with a wildly disparate target set over time, which would also be anomalous. Both\npossibilities present significant challenges to the conventional wisdom surrounding Chinese\nAPT groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHINA’S COMBINED THREAT:**\n**EXAMPLE 4 — BBCY-TA2 AND BBCY-TA3**\n\nIn retracing the history of the first publicly available reports on Chinese mobile malware\ncampaigns, BlackBerry researchers found one campaign could be traced from the earliest\nreported activity straight through to the present day. It should come as no surprise that it was\naimed at other political targets of interest making headlines. BlackBerry researchers observed\na resurgence in the group’s activity whenever domestic unrest began to arise in specific regions\nof the country.\n\nBlackBerry researchers dubbed this newly identified campaign OPERATION DUALCRYPTOEX.\nThe researchers also identified new malware families that target both Android and Windows,\nwhich BlackBerry researchers dubbed PWNDROID3 and PWNWIN1, respectively. The effort is\nthe work of a newly identified Chinese APT group BlackBerry researchers dubbed BBCY-TA2.\n\nBBCY-TA2’s malware is distributed via mobile applications that mimic a popular peer-to-peer\nmarketplace called “localbitcoins[.]com” designed to convert Bitcoin to cash at the regional level.\nChina has seen a sharp rise in cryptocurrency adoption and demand following the ongoing unrest\nbecause certain targets of interest rely on Bitcoin for operational security and concerns over local\ncurrency instability. Numerous local retailers have begun to accept various cryptocurrencies while\nBitcoin Cash is becoming a near de-facto standard among certain Chinese targets of interest\n(Redman, 2019), (Hamacher, 2019). But to be truly useful, crypto cash must often become hard\ncash in the local currency. And that is what sites like Local Bitcoins offer.\n\nBBCY-TA2 has taken note and taken advantage. PWNDROID3 offered a wide range of capabilities\nincluding geolocation tracking, call monitoring, screen monitoring, and a host of other functions.\nPerhaps the most intriguing feature was a function that holds a list of specific locations or\naddresses and sends BBCY-TA2 geofencing alerts when they are visited. Here is a brief overview\nof the technical connections between BBCY-TA2 and the 2014 campaigns, as well as a quick\ntour of OPERATION DUALCRYPTOEX:\n\n - The 2014 mobile campaigns, which came in September of that year, involved the “Occupy\nCentral with Love and Peace” movement. Reporting at the time was often conflicting; however,\ngiven access to better data sources now, the majority of these mobile campaigns were all\nclosely related and most likely deployed by the same set of operators, BBCY-TA2.\n\n  - The first campaign mimicked Code4HK, a group of developers. A message, “Check out\nthis Android app designed by Code4HK for the coordination of Occupy Central!” was sent\nto a number of targets of interest and contained a trojan which communicated back to the\ndomains “www.xsser[.]com” and “mm.v1lady[.]com” (Boehler & Sam, 2014). The Code4HK\nmalware was also signed with the email address “STREAM@V1LADY[.]COM” on July 7, 2014.\n\n - Shortly thereafter Lacoon Mobile Security (now Check Point) discovered what they called\nXsser iOS mRAT (Bublil, Brodie, & Bashan, 2014). mRAT also communicated to “www.xsser[.]\ncom” and was one of the first targeted iOS threats to be found in the wild. However, it would\nhave only been able to infect already jailbroken devices. Conveniently, according to research\nat the time, roughly 14% of the nearly 60 million iOS devices in China had been jailbroken to\nsupport Chinese keyboard applications.\n\n  - The domain “mm.v1lady[.]com” resolved to “112.124.47[.]157” beginning on September\n17, 2014. This IP would be a lynchpin for the group for nearly three years and link to both\n“mm.bbmouseme[.]com” and “mm.outputinfo[.]com”. Lookout found the same operators\nhad created a new Android RAT they termed xRAT in 2017 (Flossman, 2017), and newer\nundisclosed variants continue to infect users even in 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nRegarding OPERATION DUALCRYPTOEX:\n\n  - “63c9a6108c056cfd3962c2608d262384d65ac199d5ec480f6e8779e470915df8” is one\nrecent sample signed on July 11, 2018 which communicates to BBCY-TA2’s C2, “huaian.\nbbmouseme[.]com”, and portends to be related to “localbitcoins[.]com”.\n\n  - The sample utilized the “javax.crypto.Cipher” DES implementation to encode sensitive strings\nin the APK with the secret key “i_want_you_and_i_need_you”. This key appears in some of\nBBCY-TA2’s Windows backdoors as well. The author(s) may not have fully understood the\nmobile implementation, though, as only the first 8-bytes of the previous string would be used\nin the encryption and decryption process.\n\n### OPERATION DUALCRYPTOEX marks the fourth example BlackBerry researchers identified in this report where there was established crossover in infrastructure with another APT group’s activity.\n\nIn this case BBCY-TA2’s infrastructure crosses into the activity of another desktop-malwarefocused APT group, though it too appears to be new. BlackBerry researchers have dubbed this\nnewly identified yet traditional cyber espionage APT group BBCY-TA3.\n\nBlackBerry researchers observed this group most recently targeting telecommunications providers\nacross the countries that ring the South China Sea for espionage purposes. In addition, BlackBerry\nresearchers observed extensive campaigns throughout 2018 and 2019 in which BBCY-TA3\npursued nearly every major chemical manufacturing company in the world outside China, with\nparticular interest in companies based in Germany, the U.S., and Canada.\n\n##### Conclusions on Chinese Activity\n\nAfter an historic retrospective look at China’s mobile surveillance, it is clear the majority of it\nwas consistently domestic in focus. During this introspection BlackBerry researchers uncovered\nunexpected connections to a range of additional APT groups whose targets run the gamut of\nverticals from government to military to commercial, and which crisscross the globe.\n\nThese connections are significant because they challenge an assessment some China analysts\nhave made about the government’s ability to integrate horizontally and coordinate across a vast\nbureaucracy rife with its own problems of dysfunction, corruption and stove-piping, as represented\nin the seminal Chinese Industrial Espionage (Hannas, Mulvenon, & Puglisi, 2013).\n\nIf Chinese APT groups are coordinating efforts and/or sharing tools, they become more difficult\nto defend against. The shared tool sets also pose a challenge for organizations whose risk\nprofile relies on blacklisting domains or looking only for certain types malware, and who might\nmistakenly allow access on the basis of the belief that they are outside of China’s target profile.\n\nOur perception of the Chinese APT groups must expand to include both mobile and desktop\nthreats, domestic and foreign organizations, and domestic/economic/government/military target\nprofiles. It’s also worth expanding our notion of the typical target of the Chinese government:\nmalware meant for targets of interest in diaspora for domestic reasons may very well end up\ni id W t b i th t tt ti t t f l\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Iran\n\nIran’s mobile surveillance capability has historically been primarily focused inward to target\nvarious people of interest to the Iranian government. While some of the first documented cases\ninvolved journalists and activists abroad, the motivation behind the attacks appeared to be\ndomestically driven.\n\n### The Iranian APT strategy for adoption of the mobile dimension is thus in line with that of\n the Chinese attack groups, whose earliest mobile campaigns were similarly motivated by an imperative to keep track of certain individuals both in and out of country who challenged the authority of the government.\n\n\n**DOMESTIC KITTENS?**\n\n\nPublic research on Iranian mobile attacks was first published in 2016 and revealed a statesponsored effort still in the initial stages of development, where threat actors deployed a relatively\nimmature and simplistic toolset which included variants of “DroidJack” and Android Metasploit\npayloads (Guarnieri & Anderson, 2016). Following this early activity, it was clear the Iranian\ngovernment took on significant development efforts, as revealed in the exposure of several\nsubsequent and more sophisticated mobile campaigns such as Check Point’s DOMESTIC KITTEN\nreport last year (Check Point Research, 2018).\n\nIn their report, Check Point detailed how a more advanced set of Android malware was quickly\nleveraged in a prolonged campaign of Iranian government espionage that was focused on Kurdish\nand Turkish natives, as well as ISIS supporters. At first glance this would suggest an outwardfacing mobile espionage effort driven by counterterrorist and foreign policy concerns. None of\nthat would be particularly surprising given that all these groups are in play in the Syrian conflict\nwhere Iran supports the Assad regime.\n\nHowever, Check Point assessed that the targets were in fact all Iranian citizens. What we still do\nnot know, based on Check Point’s analysis, is whether this domestic campaign was motivated\nby a larger, politically driven influence operation strategy as with the Chinese, or if it represents\none facet of a larger political security strategy, or both. In a follow up post, Check Point added\n\n\n-----\n\nmore insight and clarified that “despite the heavy targeting of Iranians, there were also Kurdish\nand Urdu natives, ISIS supporters and even Yemeni citizens among the victims,” (Check Point\nResearch, 2018).\n\nWhile only a limited number of indicators of compromise (IoCs) were shared in Check Point’s\ninitial report, BlackBerry researchers used the IoCs provided to find a much larger list of hashes\nas well as command-and-control infrastructure detailed in the Appendix. BlackBerry researchers\nexpanded on the intelligence for the public to better understand and assess this threat.\n\nIn Check Point’s follow-up post published a month later and referred to above, a number of\nadditional details were released regarding DOMESTIC KITTEN, including the name of one of\nthe more complex Android samples BlackBerry researchers observed: “com.eracomteck/\nexample.badoo”.\n\nThis Android malware is relatively unique, and BlackBerry researchers used it along with other\nforensic indicators to draw a clear connection to a different campaign written about in a June\n2019 report by TrendMicro called “Bouncing Golf” (Xu & Guo, 2019). TrendMicro noticed the\nconnection to DOMESTIC KITTEN but did not adhere to it conclusively. In our view, “Bouncing\nGolf” was very clearly a continuation of DOMESTIC KITTEN’s activities.\n\nWhat’s significant about that connection is that it represents a dramatic shift in targeting from\ndomestic to foreign espionage. The majority of the data TrendMicro was able to identify in the\nmost recent campaigns was related to stolen military documents and images, all taken primarily\nfrom other Middle Eastern countries. This is also indicative of a concurrent shift in motivation\nbehind the espionage, from domestic to military.\n\nIn a relatively short amount of time, Iran can be seen to have followed an implementation strategy\nfirst employed by other non-democratic countries like China in honing a capability initially on\ndomestic targets of interest before turning it outward for other espionage purposes. Iran has\npreviously been observed following this course in the development and implementation of its\ntraditional desktop cyber operations strategy (Anderson & Sadjadpour, 2018).\n\n\n-----\n\n**MUDDYWATER GOES MOBILE**\n\n\nBlackBerry researchers uncovered how DOMESTIC KITTEN, an Iranian APT group that uses\nmobile malware, has expanded its portfolio from domestic target to include foreign espionage\ntargets in a short amount of time. Let’s consider another example, this time with another Iranian\nAPT group that has been traditionally focused on foreign espionage using desktop malware, but\nwhich has recently been observed adding a mobile component to its campaigns — MUDDYWATER.\n\nIn June of 2019, TrendMicro pointed out that the MUDDYWATER group had started deploying\nAndroid payloads. In their report, TrendMicro explained how a number of pieces of Android\nmalware reached their targets, detailing an SMS phishing campaign that sent messages in\nTurkish with a link which, if clicked, took victims to a website which they identified as a “legitimate\nwebsite belonging to a non-profit research organization in Turkey.” They wrote, “most likely, the\norganization’s website was compromised, which is not surprising as its website was hosted on\nWordPress, a platform MuddyWater is fond of targeting,” (Lunghi & Horejsi, New MuddyWater\nActivities Uncovered, 2019).\n\nHere is a technical explanation of how TrendMicro made that connection:\n\n  - TrendMicro was able to identify four unique android payloads based upon a common\ncommand and control server “78.128.139[.]131”. The following Six unique Android APK’s\nwere available in a common malware repository:\n\n02f54da6c6f2f87ff7b713d46e058dedac1cedabd693643bb7f6dfe994b2105d\n\n26de4265303491bed1424d85b263481ac153c2b3513f9ee48ffb42c12312ac43\n\n3bfec096c4837d1e6485fe0ae0ea6f1c0b44edc611d4f2204cc9cf73c985cbc2\n\n6b4d271a48d118843aee3dee4481fa2930732ed7075db3241a8991418f00d92b\n\n9af8a93519d22ed04ffb9ccf6861c9df1b77dc5d22e0aeaff4a582dbf8660ba6\n\ndff2e39b2e008ea89a3d6b36dcd9b8c927fb501d60c1ad5a52ed1ffe225da2e2\n\n  - One variant, e9617764411603ddd4e7f39603a4bdaf602e20126608b3717b1f6fcae60981f2,\nwas slightly different from the six above but still contained a reference to a unique image\nhosted at the URL:\n\n“http://airplanesandmore[.]com/prodimages/largeSpace%20Shuttle%20Endeavour.jpg”.\n\n  - The SMS spreading function also still linked to a malicious APK hosted from the URL:\n“http://setav[.]org/wp-includes/APK/SetaNews.apk”, which served the SHA256 hash\nbe9fb556a3c7aef0329e768d7f903e7dd42a821abc663e11fb637ce33b007087.\n\nIndeed, the website in question, “setav[.]org, is the website for SETA, which in English is The\n_Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research, a political policy think tank based in_\nAnkara, Turkey. TrendMicro did not discuss that although the think tank describes itself as\n“independent, nonprofit, and nonpartisan,” a German news organization uncovered evidence\nthat it is more than that.\n\n_Deutsche Welle, a German broadcast media company published a news item claiming that “the_\nfoundation is run by [Turkish Prime Minister] Erdogan loyalists and headed by Serhat Albayrak,\nthe elder brother of Erdogan’s son-in-law, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak. He is also Chairman of\nthe Board of the largest government-related media group in Turkey. Virtually all of SETA’s senior\nmanagement is active in an advisory capacity for Erdogan,” (Mumay, 2019).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Deutsche Welle also provided evidence that the supposed non-profit was used in information and_\ninfluence operations beneficial to the Turkish government. BlackBerry researchers assess that\nMUDDYWATER was aware of this connection, and that the SETA domain was chosen precisely\nbecause of its relationship with the Turkish government, given the likelihood that it would be\nimplicitly trusted by government officials targeted by the SMS text messages.\n\nIran is continuing to conduct mobile surveillance on its own citizens, minority ethnic groups, and\nneighboring countries involved in strategic regional conflicts. BlackBerry researchers suspect\nthe increased interest in countries like Turkey is due to recently forged military ties with Russia.\n\n### In fewer than three years, Iran has drastically improved the quality and complexity of its\n Android malware, the sophistication of its socially engineered delivery mechanisms, the ability to pivot between domestic and foreign target sets, and the implantation of a cross-platform strategy that integrates mobile and desktop malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)\n\nNorth Korean APT groups have historically focused on traditional South Korean espionage\ntargets. A dramatic shift occurred in 2014 with the high profile and highly damaging attack against\nSony Pictures Entertainment. Following this attack North Korea gained a significant amount of\nattention from western researchers who attempted to lift the fog surrounding North Korea’s larger\ncyber strategy. Research efforts, like Novetta’s “Operation Blockbuster” did a phenomenal job of\ndetailing LAZARUS’ known malware at the time (Novetta, 2016).\n\nThat effort expanded to include North Korea’s mobile malware strategy. Following Novetta’s\nlandmark publication, both Palo Alto and McAfee published research about LAZARUS’ known\nAndroid malware in 2017 (Kasza, Cortes, & Yates, 2017), (Han, 2017). With this connection made,\nNorth Korea joined the league of government APT groups with an operational mobile surveillance\nelement in their offensive cyber strategy.\n\n### What’s worth noting about the research into North Korean mobile malware is that LAZARUS’ initial set of Android malware was markedly different than that of other nation-state APT group’s early work.\n\nInstead of writing malware in Java, the language of the Android operating system and its apps,\nLAZARUS elected instead to create native executable (ELF ARM) binaries to perform the malicious\nfunctionality.\n\nThis strategy indicates one of the following:\n\n - LAZARUS was either not comfortable enough with the Android platform to write for it, or\nelse they were simply accustomed to coding for Linux; or\n\n  - LAZARUS deliberately chose to avoid writing malware in Java for Android in order to attempt\nto evade detection.\n\nWhether intentional or not, LAZARUS’ mobile malware did in fact escape detection for a period\nof time, but eventually this unique characteristic made their samples relatively easy to reliably\ndetect as well.\n\nMost of the observed North Korean mobile malware has been trained on a range of targets in\nSouth Korea, which seems to bear the brunt of most of their desktop malware attacks as well.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result of the Korean language barrier and the inherent interest of the South Korean\ngovernment to exaggerate the North Korean threat, much of the cutting-edge intelligence on\nthe mobile threat remains foggy. And even when BlackBerry researchers examined the Korean\nlanguage research and lifted one layer of that fog, another took its place, as detailed in the\nnext example.\n\n\n**SCARCRUFT — THE FOG OF FALSE FLAGS**\n\n\nWhile LAZARUS, which the US government also calls HIDDEN COBRA (US-CERT, 2017), has\nearned the most media attention, it is worth remembering that is not the only North Korean\nstate-sponsored APT group in action. Another group, which Kaspersky first named SCARCRUFT\n(a.k.a. APT37, GEUMSEONG121) is engaged in mobile malware campaigns that are the subject\nof recent research from South Korean antivirus firm Alyac (Alyac, 2019).\n\nAlyac described how SCARCRUFT began leveraging cloud provider services like DropBox\nand Yandex to download additional malicious files and upload stolen data. One of the\nmore recent Android samples Alyac wrote about, from August 2019, carries the hash value\n“8863dc53aba8dbaa7a76ab4653d54a4a7412dc9bb986b8fe1d3d8350bbb730f1.” In examining\nthis piece of Android malware, Alyac observed a direct crossover with similar desktop malware\nbeing served from the same Dropbox account.\n\n### This crossover is significant because it provides evidence that multiple North Korean APT groups have implemented a cross-platform strategy that combines the simultaneous use of mobile and desktop malware on the same target.\n\nInterestingly, McAfee also documented the use of cloud providers by yet another likely North\nKorean state-sponsored APT group called SUN TEAM in a blog post about the mobile monitoring\nof North Korean defectors, which may expand the list to three such groups with this crossplatform surveillance capability (Min, 2018).\n\nShortly before that McAfee blog post, Alyac identified another interesting find in a second piece\nof Korean-language research: strong evidence suggesting that SCARCRUFT attempted to plant\nfalse flags in one of their extremely targeted operations against South Korea (Alyac, 2019). What\nwas even more interesting was the false flag pointed to LAZARUS. While it’s not entirely clear\nwhy one North Korean APT group would wish to lead investigators and/or its target to believe\nthat another North Korean APT group was responsible, the implication is clear: a dense haze still\nlingers over the internal workings of the North Korean government.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Vietnam\n\n\n-----\n\n## Vietnam\n\nBlackBerry researchers established that the only reported state or state-sponsored APT group in\nVietnam, first identified by Chinese security company 360Safe and dubbed OCEANLOTUS (a.k.a.\nAPT32), has integrated mobile and desktop malware vertically in the same campaigns since the\nvery beginning of its observed activity. BlackBerry researchers delved into more of the mobile\naspects of OCEANLOTUS’ campaigns.\n\nThat OCEANLOTUS was even a player in the mobile malware arena had gone undetected until\njust recently, when in August of 2019 an obscure Chinese antivirus company wrote about a\nsmall number of different mobile operations conducted through 2017 (Antiy PTA Team, 2019).\nBlackBerry researchers reviewed these findings and discovered additional IoCs associated with\nthis past activity which included evidence that OCEANLOTUS has been a player in the mobile\nmalware arena since at least early 2014, predating the identification and naming of the group\nitself which occurred in May of 2015.\n\nBlackBerry researchers assessed with a high degree of confidence that the mobile malware\ncampaigns identified are under the control of OCEANLOTUS, primarily due to code similarity to\nknown OCEANLOTUS desktop campaigns as well as simultaneous use of command-and-control\ninfrastructure for both these new mobile campaigns and separate novel desktop campaigns\nassociated with the group. What’s more, as alluded to above,\n\n### BlackBerry researchers observed OCEANLOTUS engaged in cross-platform attacks that involved both mobile and desktop malware simultaneously in use on the same target in the same campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n**A NEW MOBILE CAMPAIGN: OPERATION OCEANMOBILE**\n\n\nIn the newly identified operation BlackBerry researchers dubbed OPERATION OCEANMOBILE,\nthey observed OCEANLOTUS initiate a mobile espionage campaign delivered via a sophisticated\ntrio of fake apps for Android. One of these apps supposedly provided support for high-resolution\ngraphics on the phone (e.g. for use in games), while another purported to block ads on your\nphone, and a third presented itself as a browser and cache cleaner. The apps were distributed\nthrough phishing, but also to a wider set of targets via third-party app stores as well as the official\nGoogle Play Store.\n\nIt is worth noting that OCEANLOTUS distributed its apps in part via phishing, which connotes\na specific target. They also chose to seed the apps in several stores for anyone to download\nanywhere, which suggests the net may have in fact been much wider, or perhaps entirely\nindiscriminate.\n\nFor now, one question raised by the campaign caught our attention — namely exactly how it was\nthat the apps laden with malware made it into the Google Play Store itself? What BlackBerry\nresearchers discovered was that OCEANLOTUS went to the trouble of establishing an entire\nfake backstory to give its malicious apps an air of legitimacy. They created modified GitHub\nrepositories that theoretically showed evidence of the developers’ code for each app, complete\nwith public facing “contact us” email addresses to answer any questions that might arise about\ntheir “products.” They even went to lengths to concoct entire privacy policies for their apps, which\nfew people tend to actually read, but nevertheless was ironic, given that OCEANLOTUS’ entire\npremise was to spy on its targets.\n\nThe newly discovered malware family these apps delivered, which BlackBerry researchers dubbed\nPWNDROID1, was first identified by Russian antivirus company Dr. Web in 2019, though they\ndid not name it, nor were they able to attribute it to a specific group (Dr. Web Antivirus, 2019).\n\nIn reverse engineering the malware, it was particularly intriguing to observe that OCEANLOTUS\napplied a technique commonly seen in desktop malware campaigns to help it escape detection\nby scanning. They created an otherwise benign looking application which when analyzed in\ndetail would in fact load and execute an additional encrypted payload. This helped ensure that\nthe apps would pass muster with Google and App Store administrators and fly under the radar\nof other antivirus companies.\n\nFurther technical information regarding the PWNDROID1 backdoors used in this newly revealed\noperation that BlackBerry researchers dubbed OPERATION OCEANMOBILE is as follows:\n\n - Fake OpenGL ES Updater:\n\nInitial Campaign: June 6, 2019\n\nPolicy: https://gist.github.com/lijustharma/1771c2852eb687a1f193ff58a10d5dd2\n\nSHA256: 669f21afd98391abd0d1d72af57aa5d57b9b3f93f379773e5696e5495f27f1e2\n\nSHA256: c8e78a4fbc26c78110259dd1e1d7330443935a406731a38715e5e84ec613e3cd\n\n - Fake Ad Blocking Program:\n\nInitial Campaign: June 6, 2019\n\nPolicy: https://gist.github.com/agcondiefoun/806b89fbb683f55f3f6cae275f8902cb\n\nSHA256: a2d75b3bca022d4439fc5abbd43c8d0a6adda08548691b05c7ba6ac17e9cc815\n\nSHA256: c1aa3b0e24958547765c90659021c9a2cd65d9bec532b1d93d46ceeaacb33a32\n\n\n-----\n\n - Fake Browser Cleaner:\n\nInitial Campaign: June 6, 2019\n\nPolicy: https://gist.github.com/rhenchesttija/ef404116cda4e7c1bfda5ebf179d4fc0\n\nSHA256: 99eba5020158332510da7732473142492010ce7a3ae2f0e4749212764f9f4528\n\n  - “c1aa3b0e24958547765c90659021c9a2cd65d9bec532b1d93d46ceeaacb33a32”, the most\nrecent sample, was only identified by four antivirus vendors at the time it was submitted to\na commonly used malware repository. BlackBerry researchers ascribed this to the fact that\nthe embedded payload (assets/libcore), which performed all of the malicious functionality,\nwas AES-encrypted within the APK.\n\n  - The username “agcondiefoun” was used to post the fake ad blocking app to various places.\nA profile matching the username was identified on GitHub: “https://gist.github.com/\nagcondiefoun” and contained the following gist: the file was dated May 10, 2019, although\nthe gist was created on June 6, 2019, which indicates the actors were likely planning the\nattack for some time prior to distribution. The gist contained an additional email address\n“adsgroup@gmail[.]com”. A matching document was posted to Pastebin anonymously\non June 17, 2019; it’s not clear if this activity is related to the group or was just someone\nrepublishing the information elsewhere. However, the APK’s first started to appear in\nnumerous third-party app stores on that date as well.\n\n  - OCEANLOTUS used a similar process with the fake OpenGL updater app, leveraging the\nusername “lijustharma” to post the application to various app stores.\n\n  - A related GitHub page was identified here: “https://gist.github.com/\nlijustharma/1771c2852eb687a1f193ff58a10d5dd2”\n\n - The page was created on June 6, 2019, and contained another email address of interest\n“plugin.support@hotmail[.]com”. An identical post was also created on Pastebin on June\n17, 2019, at the following URL: “https://pastebin.com/mBMHevsh”.\n\n  - BlackBerry researchers were then able to identify another associated GitHub account:\n“https://gist.github.com/rhenchesttija/ef404116cda4e7c1bfda5ebf179d4fc0”,\nPastebin URL: “https://pastebin.com/EdmjAbFX”, and another malicious APK. The\ngist was dated May 6, 2019 but was created on June 6, 2019. BlackBerry researchers\nwere able to identify one additional GitHub account likely associated with the actor,\nbut it does not appear to have been operationalized yet: “https://gist.github.com/\nhoenihahav/9b3e64fc03568a4c4f2f8b5e3da3c72d”.\n\nOCEANLOTUS has been a constant threat to Vietnamese targets of interest, regional players in\nSouth Asia and farther afield, and will continue to exploit new avenues of surveillance as they\nbecome available. They have readily adapted their malware to alternative platforms including\nmacOS, so it is not surprising to discover continuing operations in the Android space.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackBerry researchers are still analyzing the full extent of OCEANLOTUS’ mobile campaigns\nto better understand its scale, scope, and targets, and retrieved some statistics relating to a\ndifferent piece of OCEANLOTUS malware used in a past campaign in 2018 (one that presented\nitself as a codec library but was clearly not). The website AppBrain calculates and disseminates\ndata on apps distributed via the Google Play Store. In this case, OCEANLOTUS’ malware-laden\napp was installed at least 5,000 times before it became unavailable in February of 2019 as seen\nin the image below:\n\n_Figure 1: Details from AppBrain About One OCEANLOTUS Mobile Application_\n\n\nIt’s not entirely clear just how wide-reaching OCEANLOTUS’ mobile operations truly are, but they\nare undoubtedly significantly larger than what’s been discovered and published to date.\n\n##### Target: Pakistan\n\n\nIn early August of 2019, India stripped the disputed Kashmir region of its autonomy, re-igniting a\ndecades-long row with its neighbor, Pakistan, who also claims authority over parts of the region.\nThere were thousands of arrests, a build-up of military forces and, for a period of nearly a month,\ndirect armed conflict between two nuclear-armed countries seemed imminent.\n\nIn light of episodes like this, in addition to the constant churn of Pakistan’s often violent brand\nof politics and its overnight celebrity as the conduit for China’s major Belt and Road Initiative,\nPakistan has remained one of the world’s most sought after espionage targets.\n\n\nNearly all the governments with a developed cyber capability have an interest in, and ability to\nspy on the Pakistani government and its influential military. Even APT groups with unattributed\nstate backing have had a go at it. BlackBerry researchers have written extensively about one\n[such group, THE WHITE COMPANY, previously (Livelli, Smith, & Gross, 2018).](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/the-white-company-inside-the-operation-shaheen-espionage-campaign.html)\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the collective APT espionage effort targeting Pakistan has\nbeen cross-platform and includes mobile malware, but evidence proving the assumption is\nnevertheless sporadic and sparse. BlackBerry researchers identified two such campaigns and\nwill discuss their mobile dimension below. They each involve two, known, unattributed but likely\nstate-backed APT groups, BITTER and CONFUCIUS. While the latter group has been reported to\nhave used mobile malware before, the former has not.\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|3 0 . 3 7 5 3 ° N 6 9 . 3 4 5 1 ° E||\n\n\n-----\n\n**OPERATION DUALPAK — TARGET: PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT**\n\n\nA newly identified espionage campaign BlackBerry researchers dubbed OPERATION DUALPAK\ntargets members of the Pakistani government. We assess that it is the work of a state-backed APT\ngroup known as BITTER. This threat actor was first identified by Chinese security firm 360 in 2016.\n\nBITTER is known for its relentless espionage campaigns targeting Pakistan. To a lesser degree,\nit has also been observed targeting China, India and other countries in South Asia, as well as\nSaudi Arabia. While their traditional desktop malware campaigns are well documented, we\nbelieve OPERATION DUALPAK to be the first publicly documented instance in which newly\nidentified BITTER mobile malware that BlackBerry researchers dubbed PWNDROID2 has been\nused. In addition, this operation also featured an unusually extensive, traditional desktop malware\ncampaign in parallel.\n\nLike other APT groups discussed in this report, e.g. OCEANLOTUS, the chosen method of malware\ndistribution was fake apps, in this case distributed via SMS, WhatsApp, and various social media\nplatforms in June and July of 2019. What intrigued us was the choice of subject matter BITTER\nselected for the malware-laden apps, which were designed to appeal to both low-brow and highbrow elements of the Pakistani government.\n\nFirst, the low brow: One of the applications purported had an adult entertainment theme, calling\nitself Pornhub Premium. Technical details regarding this phase of the operation are here:\n\nAll of the identified mobile malware samples communicated to the dynamic DNS domain\n“newsbroadcastlive.ddns[.]net” which currently resolves to the IP address “188.215.229[.]220”.\n\n  - Based upon our initial investigation it appears that the applications were spread via various\nplatforms as discussed above in June and July of 2019. The URL shortener “tinyurl[.]com”\nwas employed in at least one phishing instance.\n\n - The following shortened address: “http://tinyurl[.]com/y485gdjo” expanded to:\n\n - “http://intlopenpipeservice[.]net/HBL/PornhubPremium.mp4.apk”\n\n  - An additional URL was identified which also served up the exact same APK, “http://\nspiceworld.rf[.]gd/Premium.php” with a different filename “P-Hub Premium.apk”.\n\n - “intlopenpipeservice[.]net” above resolved to “162.222.215[.]183” from January 2019 until\nJuly 2019. Another domain of interest appeared on this IP address in July “rnail.googlle.\nconn.pk.intlopenpipeservice[.]net” and was likely used to phish Gmail account credentials.\n\n### Following that trail, our research led us out of the gutter and toward a series of new malware samples which, in turn, connected us to the high-brow method of delivery.\n\n\n-----\n\nPerhaps the most interesting of those was a fake app purporting to bear association with the\n_Ansar Foundation. Ansar is a real UK-based NGO which has been operating in Pakistan for more_\nthan a decade. Ansar is the Arabic word for “helper,” and according to its website the foundation\nhas conducted relief work for those affected by flood and earthquakes as well as victims caught\nin military operations conducted in Northern Pakistan.\n\nAlthough the evidence BlackBerry researchers uncovered in relation to the fake Ansar-related\nmalware did not indicate precise targeting, it did roughly coincide with the time a number of other\nNGOs were kicked out of Pakistan.\n\nOne of the domains BITTER used in OPERATION DUALPAK, “wdibitmapservice[.]net”, overlapped\nwith multiple other unique IP addresses with a common set of related dynamic DNS domains\nbelonging to the same actor. This allowed BlackBerry researchers to conclude that this recent\nAndroid campaign is highly likely to be associated with ongoing Windows targeting related\nto BITTER.\n\n\n**OPERATION DUALPAK2 — TARGET: PAKISTAN MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT**\n\n\nBlackBerry researchers uncovered a second newly identified campaign dubbed OPERATION\nDUALPAK2, which also targeted various Pakistani government departments as well as military\nofficials. The campaign features the well-integrated use of cross-platform malware aimed at both\nmobile devices and desktop computers. Based on our research, OPERATION DUALPAK2 is the\nwork of another, well-known and likely state-sponsored APT called CONFUCIUS.\n\nCONFUCIUS has historically targeted Pakistan for espionage and was first identified and named\nby Palo Alto in 2016 (Lancaster & Yates, 2016). Following that report, TrendMicro has published\nseveral additional papers and updates on the group.\n\nRecently, researchers gave a talk in which they attempted to link several seemingly disparate\nAPT groups targeting Pakistan into a singular connected nexus (Lunghi & Jaromir, Linking\nCyberespionage Groups Targeting Victims in South Asia, 2019). They also alluded to the fact\nthat Phronesis, an Indian cybersecurity firm founded by former Indian military officers, is likely\ninvolved with one or more of the activity sets which include APT groups known as PATCHWORK,\nCONFUCIUS, URPAGE, HANGOVER, DONOT/EHDEVEL, and SNAKE IN THE GRASS. Whether this\nambitious assessment holds up over time remains to be seen.\n\nFor now, BlackBerry researchers delineate additional historic and recent mobile campaigns\nconducted by CONFUCIUS. This is not the first time CONFUCIUS’ mobile operations were exposed;\nin February of 2018, TrendMicro documented the use of fake chat apps that were created to\nconduct mobile surveillance of isolated targets (Lunghi & Horejsi, Deciphering Confucius’\nCyberespionage Operations, 2018).\n\nFollowing that disclosure by TrendMicro, CONFUCIUS adopted several new domains and\nconcurrently switched their other existing mobile operations to new IP addresses. But in their\nretooling, they adopted a particularly interesting tactic to ensure that their mobile malware was\ndelivered only to desired targets — inserting a human element.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Never before had BlackBerry researchers encountered an opportunity to interact with the human face of an APT group live during an ongoing espionage operation. This presented a unique opportunity.\n\nCONFUCIUS embedded a chat program on one of the websites used to distribute “dating/\nromance” chat apps that really enabled CONFUCIUS to surveil its targets.\n\n_Figure 2: Screenshot of Phillionschat.com_\n\nAs clearly demonstrated in the figure above, in order to receive the (malicious) iOS or Android\napplication one must click to initiate a conversation with the administrator. This was done through\nan embedded JavaScript version of the RocketChat application which used the subdomain “web.\nphilionschat[.]com.” BlackBerry researchers were able to find an associated “web” subdomain\nfor each actively used domain involved in mobile distribution.\n\nA newly identified Windows payload Blackberry researchers dubbed PWNWIN2 could easily be\ndownloaded from each individual site without any additional interaction and closely imitated one\nof the previous operations (TweetyChat).\n\nBlackBerry researchers attempted to initiate a conversation with CONFUCIUS but were shut\ndown pretty quickly, as seen in the figure below. Obviously, the time zone difference didn’t help,\nbut it also seemed CONFUCIUS did not want to provide the Android payload to us, or to chat:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: BlackBerry Gets Rejected by CONFUCIUS_\n\nOther fake apps distributed by CONFUCIUS in this campaign carried a more serious tone,\nincluding one that promised news about the crisis in Kashmir referenced above in the beginning\nof this section.\n\nThough espionage campaigns that do not bear the identity of the threat actor frequently do not\ninterest the press, operations like the two described above are arguably more disconcerting.\nBITTER and CONFUCIUS bear all the hallmarks of government-sponsored resources and targeting\npriorities. Their operations reveal a mature skillset that fluently interweaves both desktop and\nmobile malware, as well as infrastructure and delivery methods for each. CONFUCIUS took the\nextra step to develop realistic web pages and supporting applications to provide an additional\nlevel of deception.\n\n### In stark contrast to nearly every other government-related APT mobile campaign discussed in this overview, this one bore no overt political motivation. Instead what BlackBerry researchers found was conventional yet sophisticated espionage targeting the nation’s military and government.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis report is intended to provide a detailed survey of the strategic and tactical use of mobile\nmalware by various governments. It attempts to fill in gaps from earlier research on the subject\nof mobile malware to offer a new and redefined understanding of nation-state APT operations.\nThe conclusions drawn here are intelligence assessments representing judgments based on\navailable data.\n\nTaken together, this report provides an examination of the complex nature of mobile espionage\ncampaigns deployed by different governments, revealing that previously held perceptions were\nboth shallow and incomplete. When the term APT comes to mind, everyone naturally tends to\nexplore what’s familiar: Windows, Mac, Linux, or the occasional odd industrial control system.\n\nBut as this report shows, the mobile space was already under attack for some time. In many\nregards, mobile surveillance has always been an ingredient of individual nation-state’s APT\noperations. Attacks on Android and iOS will undoubtedly become more prevalent and blended\ninto traditional desktop-centric operations.\n\nThe evidence is all around just waiting to be uncovered. Even so, the security solutions, antivirus\nsoftware, and incident response services that might have detected these operations are only\nnow starting to appear in a significant way. Mobile security is definitely an area that needs to be\nmore fully addressed, but we are already a decade behind.\n\nThe public-facing security research on targeted mobile threats has pioneered a new way forward.\nGood mobile research was sporadically published in the past and, in many cases, presented as\na niche phenomenon — another subdiscipline for specialization. Research that examines threats\nholistically is hard to come by.\n\nBlackBerry hopes this report conveys a deeper appreciation for how the Chinese, Vietnamese,\nIranians, North Koreans and other state-backed groups view, implement and execute upon\ntheir mobile strategies. Although considerably different, those strategies had a common\ndenominatora — they all approached the mobile facet in a way that ran counter to how the\noverwhelming majority of the security industry treats it. All the APT groups BlackBerry surveyed\npurposefully interwove mobile malware into their espionage operations not as a niche effort,\nbut as a holistic one.\n\nLooking ahead, businesses and other organizations that are grappling with how to build resilience\nagainst a relentless onslaught of cyber espionage campaigns would do well to adjust their\nstrategy to incorporate mobile defense, both for company-issued smartphones as well as those\npermitted for use in a “bring your own device” plan.\n\nGovernments and policy experts hard at work defining deterrence strategies, cyber norms and\nred lines in the international community will be challenged by what the findings reveal and\nportend regarding the incorporation of mobile threats into the broader espionage picture. There\nis considerably more than is covered in this comprehensive report to reveal and comprehend.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Works Cited\n\nAFP. (2017, July 14).
