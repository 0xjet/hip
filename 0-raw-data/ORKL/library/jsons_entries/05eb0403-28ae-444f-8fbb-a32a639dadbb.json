While first engaged in espionage activity, Agrius attackers shifted to extorting targets, claiming they stole and encrypted their data. Their data, however, could\n not be retrieved for any ransom - as it was destroyed in a wiping attack.\n\nAn analysis of what at first sight appeared to be a ransomware attack revealed new variants of\n\nwipers that were deployed in a set of destructive attacks against Israeli targets. The operators\n\nbehind the attacks intentionally masked their activity as ransomware attacks, an uncommon\n\nbehavior for financially motivated groups. Considering this and the nature of the known targets,\n\nwe assess this is a nation-sponsored threat group.\n\nOne of the wipers used in the attack, dubbed ‘Apostle’, was later turned into a fully functional\n\nransomware, replacing its wiper functionalities. The message inside it suggests it was used to\n\ntarget a critical, nation-owned facility in the United Arab Emirates. The similarity to its wiper\n\nversion, as well as the nature of the target in the context of regional disputes, leads us to believe\n\nthat the operators behind it are utilizing ransomware for its disruptive capabilities.\n\nThe usage of ransomware as a disruptive tool is usually hard to prove, as it is difficult to determine a\n\nthreat actor’s intentions. Analysis of the Apostle malware provides a rare insight into such attacks,\n\ndrawing a clear line between what began as a wiper malware to a fully operational ransomware.\n\nBased on technical analysis of the tools and attack infrastructure, we assess with medium\n\nconfidence that the attacks were carried out by a threat group affiliated with Iran. While some\n\nlinks to known Iranian actors were observed, the set of TTPs and tools appear to be unique to this\n\nset of activities. SentinelLabs tracks this threat actor as Agrius.\n\n### ATTACK LIFE CYCLE\n\nThe Agrius threat group utilizes VPN services (primarily ProtonVPN) for anonymization when\n\naccessing the public facing applications of its targets. Upon successful exploitation, the threat\n\nactor deploys webshells or simply accesses the target by using the target organization’s VPN\n\n\nsolution. The webshells Agrius deploys are mostly variations of ASPXSpy\n\n[1https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0073/](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0073/)\n\n\n1.\n\n\n-----\n\nAgrius uses those webshells to tunnel RDP traffic in order to leverage compromised accounts\n\nto move laterally. During this phase, the attackers use a variety of publicly available offensive\n\nsecurity tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement.\n\nFig 1: A summary of Agrius attack life cycle\n\nOn interesting hosts, the threat actor deploys its own custom malware – _‘IPsec Helper’. This_\n\nbackdoor is written in .NET and appears exclusive to Agrius. The malware registers itself as a\n\nservice to achieve persistence. It can be used to exfiltrate data or deploy additional malware.\n\nAgrius has deployed two different wipers. The first, dubbed ‘Apostle’, appears to be written by the\n\nsame developer as ‘IPsec Helper’. Both are written in .NET, share functions, and execute tasks in a\n\nsimilar manner. Interestingly, Apostle was later modified into functioning ransomware. The second\n\nwiper, DEADWOOD, was previously involved in a wiping attack in the Middle East and tentatively\n\nattributed to Iran though we have been unable to confirm this independently.\n\n\n-----\n\n### INITIAL INFECTION VECTOR\n\nAgrius’ main infection vector is exploitation of public facing applications, most likely utilizing\n\npublicly available exploits. During our investigation, we observed wide attempts by Agrius to\n\nexploit FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 against Israeli targets. Focusing primarily on Israel, we believe\n\nthe group chooses its targets opportunistically.\n\nOther than attempted exploitation of CVE-2018-13379, Agrius was observed attempting to exploit\n\na variety of 1-day vulnerabilities in web-based applications, as well as attempting SQL injection.\n\nMost of the attempts were performed from IPs belonging to VPN services, such as ProtonVPN.\n\nUpon successful exploitation, the threat actor uploads a webshell. Those webshells are used to\n\ntunnel traffic into the network in order to leverage compromised credentials to move laterally\n\nusing RDP.\n\n### TOOLSET\n\n**We b s h e l l s**\n\nWebshells play an important role in Agrius’ operations. Though their webshells appear to vary,\n\ncloser inspection reveals that they are mostly variations of ASPXSpy.\n\nThree of the webshells identified in Agrius intrusions were uploaded to VirusTotal. While submitter\n\ncountries are an inconclusive indicator, it’s interesting to note that they were uploaded from Iran,\n\nPakistan, and Israel. Two of the webshells are quite similar, other than an additional obfuscation\n\nadded in the form of a custom base64 encoding function unique to Agrius.\n\nFig 2 + 3: Modified ASPXSpy - base64 obfuscated version (left) and simple version (right)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe two samples above contain functionality that enables the threat actor to run commands\n\nusing _‘cmd.exe’. In the unobfuscated version ‘cmd.exe’ is hardcoded, while the obfuscated_\n\nversion can run any existing file but uses cmd.exe by default.\n\nThe third one appears to be a fully functional ASPXspy with the same base64 implementation.\n\nThis version is referred to in the code as ‘PRIVATECODE’:\n\nFig 4: Webshell internally referred to as PRIVATECODE\n\nAlthough some of the variables remain the same as in publicly available versions of ASPXSpy,\n\nsome modifications in the code were unique and noteworthy:\n\n1. The naming of the process object ‘prcsss’.\n\n2. The definition of the base64 function ‘public string base64ToStr(string instr)’.\n\nWhile searching for similar files in VirusTotal we came across one additional webshell using the\n\n_‘prcsss’ variable name, originally uploaded from Turkey. This version is also a modification of_\n\nASPXSpy and exhibits the same functionality as the base64 obfuscated version without the custom\n\nbase64 functionality.\n\nThe specific implementation of the base64 function was identified on a total of six webshells on\n\nVirusTotal, all of which were ASPXSpy variations. Three of the webshells were uploaded from Iran\n\nwhile the rest were uploaded from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. Although\n\nwe can not confirm this implementation is exclusive to Agrius, it is apparent it is limited to regional\n\nactors, most likely Iranian.\n\n**I P s e c H e l p e r - C u s t o m B a c k d o o r**\n\nThe main implant used by Agrius is IPsec Helper, which is a custom .NET backdoor. The backdoor\n\nprovides basic functionality like uploading of files from the infected system, running commands,\n\nand deploying additional executables. It connects back to C2 servers over HTTP based on a\n\nconfiguration file. The tool is run as a service, suggesting it is executed once the threat actor has\n\nachieved elevated privileges.\n\nWhat appears to be authentic victim uploads of IPsec Helper samples were submitted to VirusTotal\n\nfrom Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n-----\n\n**I P s e c H e l p e r A n a l y s i s**\n\nThe backdoor malware requires installation as a service. It is registered\n\nas _‘IPsec Helper’. Upon execution, it sleeps for a random number of_\n\nseconds (iterating 200 times over sleeps between 1 to 3 seconds). It\n\nthen checks for an internet connection by connecting to a predefined\n\nlist of Microsoft servers.\n\nFig 5: Malware initialization process\n\nThe malware operates based on an XML configuration file, which is\n\ncreated on the first execution. It is written to disk based on parameters\n\nembedded within the file and contains the malware C2 servers,\n\nreferred to as ‘relays’. The relays are encrypted before being written\n\nto the configuration file, although they reside in clear text within\n\nthe executable. The configuration file also contains a ‘super relay’\n\ncontacted in specific situations.\n\nFig 6: ‘IPsec Helper’ configuration file\n\n\n-----\n\ncontains basic information on the infected machine. After its first registration, the malware will\n\nenter the main loop, awaiting commands from its relays. Supported commands are as follows:\n\n**CmdType** **Command Name** **Description**\n\nReceive a list of relays and check if available.\n\n2 NewRelays If not, connect to the super relay and ask for\n\nnew relays.\n\nSend recon information on the infected\n3 NodeFullInfo\nmachine (Node).\n\nDownload a file from the relay, and replace\n\n6 UpdateEngine the existing malware executable. Restart\n\nthe service.\n\nDelete related registry keys, service traces\n7 SelfDelete\nand delete the executable. Stop execution.\n\nSleep for the number of seconds listed\n8 Sleep\nin the interval.\n\nReturn malware engine version (Embedded\n11 EngineVersion\nwithin the malware).\n\nDownload an executable from the relay and\n12 DownloadExecuteFile\nexecute it.\n\nDownload an executable from a URL given by\n13 DownloadExecuteUrl\nthe relay and execute it.\n\nRun a command. If the file ‘%TEMP%\\VBE.exe’\nexists, run the command with it. If not, run it\n\n14 CommandExecute\n\nwith PowerShell. If PowerShell does not exist,\nrun the command using CMD.\n\nReceive file path and send the file to\n15 UploadFile\nthe relay.\n\nReceive new configuration values and update\n16 UpdateConfig\nthe configuration file accordingly.\n\n17 ProcessId Send the malware current process ID.\n\nFig 7: List of supported ‘IPsec Helper’ commands\n\n\nThe backdoor randomly chooses a relay and connects to it using HTTP POST requests based\n\non parameters hardcoded within the executable. The first message is sent for registration and\n\n\n-----\n\nA very thorough analysis of the malware, detailing each of the supported commands, as well as\n\n\nadditional features not described in this report, can be found in a Medium post by Hido Cohen\n\n**A p o s t l e - F r o m W i p e r t o R a n s o m w a r e**\n\n\n2.\n\n\n_Apostle is a .NET malware whose functionality iteratively developed from a wiper to full-fledged_\n\nransomware. We believe the implementation of the encryption functionality is there to mask its\n\nactual intention: destroying victim data. This thesis is supported by an early version of Apostle\n\nthat the attacker’s internally named ‘wiper-action’. This early version was deployed in an attempt\n\nto wipe data but failed to do so possibly due to a logic flaw in the malware. The flawed execution\n\nled to the deployment of the DEADWOOD wiper. This, of course, did not prevent the attackers from\n\nasking for a ransom.\n\nThe two versions of Apostle we analyzed share significant portions of code yet demonstrate\n\nthe evolution of the threat actor. Improvements include repairing logic flaws, implementing\n\nransomware functionality, and passing the compiled code through an obfuscator.\n\nApostle also shares significant portions of code with IPsec Helper, a closed-source tool which,\n\nto our knowledge, is used exclusively by Agrius. The two share code overlaps as well as display\n\nevolution between incidents, suggesting that Apostle is developed in-house.\n\n**A p o s t l e A n a l y s i s**\n**A p o s t l e W i p e r v a r i a n t ( e a r l y )**\n\nThe early wiper variant of Apostle was compiled on November 29, 2020. This timestamp appears\n\nauthentic due to the proximity to its deployment. It is internally named ‘wiper-action’, indicating\n\nits purpose. This variant was observed targeting an organization in Israel.\n\n[2https://hidocohen.medium.com/shirbits-breach-backdoor-analysis-cd8273594f60](https://hidocohen.medium.com/shirbits-breach-backdoor-analysis-cd8273594f60)\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon execution, Apostle verifies there’s only one instance by invoking the function ‘IsFirstInstance()’,\n\nsearching for the mutex ‘Global-XSjzmQixFXFfHO3npSYS’. It then achieves persistence by creating\n\n\na scheduled task named ‘MicrosoftCrashHandlerUAC’, using ‘AddToStartup()’:\n\nFig 8: Apostle schedule task creation\n\nNext, it gets a list of fixed drives on the infected machine, and creates a thread for each of the\n\ndrives excluding the main system drive. Those threads will handle the wiping of each drive. The\n\nwiping process searches files based on a list of extensions embedded within the sample.\n\nHowever, matching between the enumerated files and the embedded file extensions list fails as\n\nthe extensions in the list do not contain a ‘.’, while the function searching the extension from the\n\nfile does. This guarantees that the wiper will not match any file, effectively preventing it from\n\nexecuting properly.\n\nFig 9: Failed search of file extensions in enumerated files. List presented is partial.\n\n\n-----\n\nAssuming files are found (although in this version none will), the wiping\n\nprocess for each file would have been:\n\na. Write random bytes, in 4096 chunks, repeated 6 times.\n\nb. Resize the file to size zero.\n\nc. Change the 3 time properties (Creation time, Last Access Time,\n\nLast Write Time) to 2037-01-01 00:00:00.\n\nd. Delete the file.\n\nNext, the wiper will attempt to delete all event logs:\n\nFig 10: Clearing all event logs\n\nAfterwards, it writes a file named ‘system.bat’ to %TEMP% and executes\n\nit. The file attempts to delete all files under the system drive, followed\n\nby instructing Windows to process idle tasks, and finally deleting itself.\n\nFig 11: ‘system.bat’ content\n\nAfter running ‘system.bat’, the malware writes an additional BAT file\n\nto %TEMP%, named ‘remover.bat’. This script attempts to delete the\n\noriginal program as well as itself. A similar process was observed in\n\n_IPsec Helper._\n\nFig 12: ‘remover.bat’ content, given the wiper is executed from\n\n_‘C:\\wiper_path\\wiper.exe’_\n\n\n-----\n\nLastly, the program calls for a reboot by running the following (pseudo) code:\n\nFig 13: Reboot pseudo code\n\nThe malware contains additional functions that remain unused. Those functions include:\n\n   - _WriteRegistryKey: Writes a given string to a given location in the registry._\n\n    - Interestingly, this function is almost identical to the WriteRegistryKey function of IPsec\n\n_Helper. One of many similarities between Apostle wiper and the IPsec Helper backdoor._\n\n   - _KillAllProcess: Send a process kill signal to all processes, except for the current process._\n\n   - _StopAllService: Stop all running services._\n\n**A p o s t l e R a n s o m w a r e Va r i a n t**\n\nThe compilation timestamp of the ransomware variant, internally named ‘Apostle’, was most likely\n\nmodified by an obfuscator (Agile.NET). The sample was uploaded to VirusTotal on March 29 from\n\nthe United Arab Emirates, and is clearly an evolution of the original wiper version. This means\n\nit was most likely developed between November 29, 2020 to March 29, 2021. The File Version\n\nInformation corroborates that it was developed in 2021.\n\nMuch like the wiper, upon execution the malware checks whether it is the first instance running on\n\nthe machine using the same function ‘IsFirstInstance()’. The mutex searched for in this version of\n\nApostle is different, but follows a similar pattern - ‘Global-CeikEKrAmr5lh8GJwsDk’.\n\nProper execution of the ransomware version requires supplying it with a base64 encoded argument\n\ncontaining an XML of an _‘RSAParameters’ object. This argument is passed on and saved as the_\n\nPublic Key used for the encryption process and is most likely generated on a machine owned by\n\nthe threat actor. If executed without any arguments, it automatically runs the SelfDelete function,\n\nwhich is almost identical to the one in the older version.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 14: Deobfuscated Apostle initiation\n\nThe malware then retrieves a list of all running services and stops all\n\nservices containing the string ‘sql’. This might be an attempt to enable\n\nthe ransomware to successfully access database files.\n\nFig 15: Deobfuscated snippet of SQL services shutdown\n\nThe ransomware continues by enumerating through the machine drives\n\nin a similar task to the wiper version. For each one of the drives, the\n\nmalware will:\n\n1. Drop a text file named ‘__READ__ME__.txt’ in each one of the\n\ndrives using the function ‘CreateMessage()’.\n\n2. Create a thread which generates a list of files to encrypt and\n\ninitiates the encryption process. This list is generated based\n\non an allow list of extensions (similar to the wiper version) and\n\na specific block list of folders for the Windows drive. In this\n\nversion, the flawed extension search was fixed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 16: Fixed deobfuscated MatchExtensions function\n\nThe ransomware encrypts files using the RijndaelManaged algorithm. The key and IV for the\n\nencryption are generated based on a random salt and password. The password is encrypted using\n\nthe public key given as a command line argument at execution. The encrypted files will be written\n\nto a new file, whose name is a random GUID with the extension ‘.lock’. The format of the file will\n\nbe as follows:\n\na. Salt value (32 bytes), which remain in clear text.\n\nb. Encrypted file content.\n\nc. base64 of encrypted original filename, followed by 8 bytes of length.\n\nd. base64 of password encrypted with the public key passed on the command line, followed\n\nby 8 bytes of length.\n\nAfter writing the encrypted file, the ransomware continues to delete the original file. The deletion\n\nof the original file resembles the wiping mechanism of the old Apostle version:\n\na. Write random bytes.\n\nb. Resize the file to size zero.\n\nc. Change the 3 time properties (Creation time, Last Access Time, Last Write Time) to 2037\n01-01 00:00:00.\n\nd. Delete the file.\n\nThe ransomware finishes execution by leaving another message text file on the machine’s Desktop\n\nas well as a wallpaper image. It then sleeps for one second, changes the wallpaper to the picture,\n\nattempts to delete itself and shuts down the computer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 17: Apostle ransomware program end\n\nThe message shown belows was embedded within the identified sample and addressed to a\n\nspecific victim in the United Arab Emirates. The embedded message is similar to a message left by\n\nanother ransomware variant known as Target777. We believe it was most likely copied, possibly as\n\na false flag, and that the two threat actors are not related. The message is as follows:\n```\n   Hello [REDACTED]\n   Please, check this message in detail and contact a person from IT department.\n   Your personam computer has been infected by ransomware virus.\n   All your personal files ( Passport,visas etc. ) are encrypted .\n   If you want to restore your files including your clients personal data, you will need to make\n   the payment.\n   Otherwise all your files will be posted in the internet which may lead you to the loss of\n   reputation and cause the troubles for your business .\n   let us know if you have any questions.\n   Our email address : [REDACTED]@protonmail.com\n   If you don't get an answer from us within one day, we will contact you at [REDACTED]\n\n```\nFig 18: Apostle ransom note\n\nInterestingly, the function responsible for writing the message to file attempts to replace strings\n\nsuch as ‘<hostname>’ and ‘<id>’ to customize the message to the machine. Those strings, however,\n\nwere not found in the message embedded in this sample, which might indicate there are additional,\n\nyet undiscovered, versions of this ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 19: Apostle built in wallpaper\n\n**A p o s t l e a n d S i m i l a r i t i e s t o I P s e c H e l p e r**\n\nThroughout our analysis of _Apostle, we noticed it shares significant code overlaps with the main_\n\nbackdoor used by Agrius, IPsec Helper. This may be the result of a shared code base or being\n\nwritten by the same developer.\n\n_Apostle shares the naming conventions with_ _IPsec Helper, as well as implementing entire_\n\nfunctions from it. The class ‘PublicFunction’ exists in both Apostle and IPsec Helper, and contains\n\nthree overlapping functions: _ExecuteProcess(), GetOwnPath() and_ _GetWindowsTempPath(). The_\n\nimplementation of those functions is very similar as well.\n\nThe self deletion mechanisms of both are implemented in a similar manner and are both named\n\n_SelfDelete(). Both malware delete themselves by writing a BAT file named ‘remover.bat’ to ‘%TEMP%’_\n\nand executing it, utilizing the above mentioned functions. As shown below, the implementation is\n\nsimilar, except that IPsec Helper contains additional functionalities to delete a service.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 20: Similarities in SelfDelete() functions of\n\nIPsec Helper and Apostle\n\n**D E A D W O O D W I P E R**\n\nAgrius also utilized DEADWOOD (aka ‘Detbosit’), a wiper malware\n\nwritten in C++ using the Boost libraries. This wiper was previously\n\nreported, although barely discussed compared to other Middle-Eastern\n\nwiper malware. According to publicly available information, it was\n\ninvolved in a wiping attack in Saudi Arabia in 2019.\n\n**D E A D W O O D A n a l y s i s**\n\nThe wiper can be executed in two modes: as a Service and as a\n\nWindows Application. Executing it in either of the modes will also\n\ncause an attempt to execute the other as some of the features work\n\nin only one of the modes. The name of the service varies across\n\ndifferent versions. In the most recent version, the service created by\n\nDEADWOOD is named ‘ScDeviceEnums’.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 21 + 22: DEADWOOD attempts to execute a service and a WinApp\n\nThe malware operates based on a configuration file, which lists which functionalities to execute. The\n\nconfiguration file for newer DEADWOOD samples is embedded within the executable as a resource\n\nnamed ‘METADATA’, encrypted using AES. In older versions of the malware, the configuration\n\ncomes as a single flag passed on the command line or read from a file on disk.\n\nFig 23: Decrypted DEADWOOD parameters extracted from sample\n\nOne of the parameters within the configuration file is _‘TimeStamp’, which is used to determine_\n\nwhen the wiper functionality starts. When the timestamp is met, a trigger file will be created on the\n\nWindows drive, initiating the wiping activity. If the timestamp is in the past, the wiper will execute\n\nimmediately. This can help coordinate wiping of different machines within the network, enabling\n\nmaximum impact.\n\nFig 24: DEADWOOD checks for existence of trigger file ‘Microsoft.Help.dll.iso’\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the commands within the configuration file are there to ensure its proper execution by\n\npreventing the user from accessing the machine. Those include:\n\n\n-----\n\nRegardless of the configuration, DEADWOOD will attempt to overwrite files using random data.\n\nThe additional commands within the configuration file regard the actual wiping operation, and\n\ninclude the following:\n\n**Command Name** **Description**\n\nManually opens and writes zeros to the first 512\nbytes of each drive (deleting the MBR).\n\nCOMMAND_DESTROY_DISK Following that, it will also send the control code\n\nIOCTL_DISK_DELETE_DRIVE_LAYOUT, which\nwill basically do the same, to be extra safe in the\nMBR destruction.\n\nCauses the files, overwritten with random data,\nCOMMAND_DELETE_FILES\nto also be deleted.\n\nWithout this flag, the wiping is not executed on\nthe system drive, but only on other ones.\n\nCOMMAND_DELETE_WINDOWS_\nDRIVE\n\nIf this flag is on, the Windows drive will also be\nincluded in the wiping.\n\nWith a proper configuration, the impact of the malware might actually look like ransomware,\n\nas random data is written over the original content of the files without deleting them. Unlike\n\nransomware, however, data wiped by DEADWOOD can not be recovered by the threat actor (it\n\ncan only be restored from a previous backup, if one exists).\n\nThe parameter ‘COMMAND_ALL’ appears to be deprecated and does not affect the actual\n\nexecution of the malware.\n\nThe version of DEADWOOD deployed by Agrius is a newer version of the previously reported\n\nmalware. Other than the minor changes, such as the change of the service name and trigger\n\nfile, new features were introduced including:\n\n  - Some of the strings within the binary are XORed with the byte 0xD5 and are\n\ndeobfuscated at runtime.\n\n  - The configuration is embedded within the executable using AES.\n\n  - The Windows Application part checks if it is executed in the active session,\n\nand if not, reruns itself in the active session.\n\n\n-----\n\n### AGRIUS ATTRIBUTION\n\n\nThroughout our analysis of Agrius techniques, tools, and infrastructure, we found no solid links\n\nto any known threat groups. While it is hard to provide a definitive attribution for Agrius, a set of\n\nindications pointing the activity towards an Iranian nexus came up throughout the investigation:\n\n1. **Correlation with Iranian interests and past actions**\n\nWhile this is not a strong link, it is worth noting when correlated with other, technical links.\n\nIranian threat actors have a long history of deploying wipers, dating back to 2012, when\n\nIranian hackers deployed the notorious Shamoon malware against Saudi Aramco. Since\n\nthen, Iranian threat actors have been caught deploying wiper malware in correlation with\n\nthe regime’s interests on several occasions.\n\nAgrius wiping activity within Israel may have been part of an ongoing cyber feud between\n\nIsrael and Iran that was happening at the same time. Among the reported attacks in this\n\nfeud were the targeting of water systems in Israel and a disruptive attack against a port in\n\nIran. While we can’t conclusively link Agrius’ activity to this feud, the timing is worth noting.\n\nOne of the confirmed targets for Agrius is an organization in the United Arab Emirates, which\n\nis well known for having been previously targeted by suspected Iranian threat actors. The\n\nspecific entity targeted is a nation-owned critical infrastructure facility whose disruption\n\nwould have an outsized local impact.\n\n2. **Webshells VirusTotal submissions**\n\nSome of the webshells deployed by Agrius throughout its intrusions were modified versions\n\nof ASPXSpy, deploying additional obfuscation and changing variable names. Three of the\n\nvariants of this webshell were uploaded from Iran, the rest from other countries within the\n\nMiddle East region.\n\nWhile VirusTotal submissions are not an exact form of determining where a sample was\n\ndeployed from, the sources reinforce a Middle Eastern regional focus.\n\nFig 25 + 26: Modified Agrius webshells uploaded from Iran\n\n\n-----\n\nthe access was performed from non-VPN nodes, it originated from servers that have also\n\nresolved to Iranian domains in the past.\n\n[Fig 26 + 27: Agrius infrastructure resolving to Iranian domains (source: PassiveTotal)](https://community.riskiq.com/)\n\n4. **The usage of the DEADWOOD wiper**\n\nAgrius utilized the DEADWOOD wiper, which was previously attributed to an Iranian-nexus\n\n\n3. **Infrastructure links to Iran**\n\nThe threat actor often used public VPN providers, such as ProtonVPN. On instances where\n\n\nactor. Some of the reports tie this wiper to APT33\n\n\n3, although not a lot of information was\n\n\nmade public regarding this attribution, and we cannot independently corroborate it. The ties\n\nbetween Agrius and the threat actor who originally deployed DEADWOOD remain unclear.\n\nWe believe it’s possible that the two groups have access to shared resources.\n\nThe thesis is based on two observations:\n\n   - The DEADWOOD variant Agrius attackers used appears to be a newer version of the\n\npreviously reported DEADWOOD variants, implementing additional obfuscations and\n\nfeatures. This suggests Agrius have access to the source code or are in collaboration\n\nwith the original development team.\n\n   - The deployment of DEADWOOD, however, came shortly after an attempt to deploy\n\nApostle. From the looks of it, DEADWOOD was not Agrius’s first choice. This, as well as\n\nthe fact Apostle shares significant portions of code with IPsec Helper, indicate that it is\n\npart of the groups ‘in-house’ arsenal, unlike DEADWOOD, which was most likely obtained\n\nfrom an external source.\n\n[3https://www.recordedfuture.com/iranian-cyber-response/](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iranian-cyber-response/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nAgrius is a new threat group that we assess with medium confidence to be of Iranian origin,\n\nengaged in both espionage and disruptive activity. The group leverages its own custom toolset,\n\nas well as publicly available offensive security tools, to target a variety of organizations in the\n\nMiddle East. In some cases, the group leveraged its access to deploy destructive wiper malware,\n\nand in others a custom ransomware. Considering this, we find it unlikely that Agrius is a financially\n\nmotivated threat actor.\n\nOur analysis of Agrius activity does not come in a vacuum. Early May 2021 saw another set of\n\n[disruptive ransomware attacks attributed to Iran targeting Israel from the n3tw0rm ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/n3tw0rm-ransomware-emerges-in-wave-of-cyberattacks-in-israel/)\n\n[group, a newly-identified threat actor with links to the 2020 Pay2Key attacks. The close proximity](https://assets.sentinelone.com/labs/lessons-learned-from)\n\nof the Agrius and n3tw0rm campaigns suggest they may be part of a larger, coordinated Iranian\n\nstrategy. Leaks from Lab Dookhtegan and the [Project Signal ransomware operation also support](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/second-iranian-ransomware-operation-project-signal-emerges/)\n\nthis claim.\n\nWhile being disruptive and effective, ransomware activities provide deniability, allowing states to\n\nsend a message without taking direct blame. Similar strategies have been used with devastating\n\neffect by other nation-state sponsored actors. The most prominent of those was NotPetya in 2017,\n\n[a destructive malware targeting Ukraine masked as ransomware and attributed to Russian state-](https://wccftech.com/australia-us-uk-russia-notpetya/)\n\nsponsored threat actors by Western intelligence agencies.\n\n\n-----\n\n### INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\n**I P s e c H e l p e r**\nS a m p l e s\n\n  - b451592c0934e8d91197dab1d846d9c8\n\n  - 9d7d20a21cf00f43e1b1701df368e172\n\n  - 02aa4ba656d49ebbe930b923b8399b6b\n\n  - ef0740198be26c0ba32c0332a2afe133\n\n  - 01ed1914b55a2d6ca4e4c97827fba3f4\n\n  - 4ea373d0ab8d50b644c95f415e1c0694\n\n  - 3259b88515f97d999256fcd3bb7a75a0d4173e9c\n\n  - 5ab8582a892c603b00c0989eedca668e55abbba5\n\n  - a64924df986c1682fd4f37153a917ee454a18315\n\n  - 58d58356b7a1aa69e60b72be4dc2e2499929274a\n\n  - 2e488d98a99a0fdffd1e8ae85b3485366ae8287b\n\n  - 84aad01489fe6eefd79ef1cbb771eb76fce58fe3\n\n  - fc949bd5aa0e704901f12624badd591768ea5613560bd3d88c396479235da095\n\n  - 96cc69242a7900810c4d2e9f3f55aad8edb89137959f4c370f80a6e574ddc201\n\n  - 40f329d0aaba0d55fc657802761c78be74e19a553de6fd2df592bccf3119ec16\n\n  - b30405d654c1bfcd5e2bd338cc16e971738ceb6ba069da413195358b9ca3a2a2\n\n  - 6505ecd35e45e521f5e37febd01be04166d725ba87552777c17517533afc6329\n\n  - 7b525fe7117ffd8df01588efb874c1b87e4ad2cd7d1e1ceecb5baf2e9c052a52\n\nR e l a y s U R L\n\n  - hxxp://195.123.208.152/Admins/login.php\n\n  - hxxp://5.2.67.85/View/list.php\n\n  - hxxp://5.2.73.67/Panel/new/File/css/boot.php\n\n  - hxxp://185.142.98.32/Scripts/_Data/25/lastupdate.php\n\n  - hxxp://185.142.97.81/css/v1/template/main.php\n\nS u p e r R e l a y s\n\n  - hxxp://theisnonamelikethis29123.com/mail.php\n\n  - hxxp://whynooneistherefornoneofthem.com/about.php\n\n\n-----\n\nH a r d c o d e d U s e r A g e n t\n\n  - Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;
