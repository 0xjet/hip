In Bitcoin alone, Suex’s deposit addresses hosted at large exchanges have\nreceived over $160 million from ransomware actors, scammers, and darknet market\noperators. Chainalysis’ investigation reveals that the OTC is converting cryptocurrency into\ncash at physical branches located in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and possibly also at other\noffices outside of Russia as well. Suex is also found to have received over $50 million worth\n\n\n-----\n\nof Bitcoin sent from addresses hosted at illicit cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e from 2018\nthrough 2021, well after BTC-e was shut down by U.S. authorities for its own money\nlaundering activity on behalf of cybercriminals.\n\nChainalysis has been tracking Suex’s money laundering activity for some time now.\nFollowing this investigation, we can reveal that multiple Suex addresses are included in the\n[group of 273 service deposit addresses we identified as receiving 55% of all funds sent from](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/cryptocurrency-money-laundering-2021)\n[illicit addresses in 2020 in our most recent Crypto Crime Report. Suex addresses also](https://go.chainalysis.com/2021-Crypto-Crime-Report.html)\n[appear in the Rogue 100, a list of 100 OTC deposit addresses we identified as belonging to](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/money-laundering-cryptocurrency-2019)\nmajor money laundering facilitators in 2019.\n\nToday’s designation is important because it represents significant action taken by the U.S.\ngovernment to combat the money launderers who make all other forms of cryptocurrencybased crime profitable. As we discussed in our most recent Crypto Crime Report, a very\nsmall group of illicit services facilitates the majority of the money laundering for all\ncryptocurrency-based crime. Suex is one of the biggest and most active of those services.\nShutting them down would represent a significant blow to many of the biggest cyber threat\nactors operating today, including leading ransomware attackers, scammers, and darknet\nmarket operators.\n\n## Who is Suex?\n\nSuex is a cryptocurrency OTC broker legally registered in the Czech Republic. However, it\nhas no known physical presence there and instead operates out of branch offices in Moscow\nand St. Petersburg, as well as other locales in and around Russia and in the Middle East.\nSuex claims it can convert cryptocurrency holdings into cash at these branch locations and\neven facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrency for physical assets like real estate, cars, and\nyachts.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Photo (L) of alleged Suex employees at elevator bank at reported Suex office location at 12_\n_Federation East Tower, Moscow City, Moscow and photo (R) reportedly taken within the_\n_Suex office suite (map courtesy of Google Maps)._\n\n## Suex’s blockchain footprint\n\nSuex operates as a nested service, meaning it operates using addresses hosted by larger\nexchanges in order to tap into those exchanges’ liquidity and trading pairs. While many\nnested services are legitimate, some exchanges don’t hold nested services to high enough\ncompliance standards, meaning they can be exploited for money laundering.\n\nBlockchain analysis reveals that Suex has received tens of millions worth of cryptocurrency\npayments from addresses associated with several forms of cybercrime, as well as from\naddresses associated with the now-shuttered exchange BTC-e. While Suex’s activity\nspanned several cryptocurrencies, we’ll dive more into its Bitcoin transaction history below\nusing [Chainalysis Reactor.](https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-reactor/)\n\nSuex has received over $481 million in Bitcoin alone since becoming active in February\n2018, based on the value at the time of transfers. Those transfers include substantial funds\nreceived from cybercriminals. Specifically, Suex has received:\n\n[Nearly $13 million from ransomware operators including Ryuk, Conti, Maze, and](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ransomware-update-may-2021)\nseveral others\nOver $24 million from cryptocurrency scam operators including the fraudsters\n[behind Finiko, a scam that took in over $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency from victims](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/eastern-europe-cryptocurrency-geography-report-2021-preview)\nprimarily in Russia and Ukraine\n[Over $20 million from darknet markets, primarily the Russia-based Hydra Market](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/darknet-markets-2021-geographic-breakdown)\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, Suex received over $50 million worth of cryptocurrency from addresses\nassociated with BTC-e, an illicit cryptocurrency exchange shut down by authorities in 2017\nfor facilitating large-scale money laundering on behalf of cybercriminals.\n\nInterestingly, the transfers from BTC-e to Suex took place well after BTC-e was shuttered,\nwith some occurring as recently as this year. We believe Suex may have processed these\ntransfers on behalf of BTC-e administrators, associates, or former users attempting to\nliquidate cryptocurrency trapped at the exchange. Our analysis of Suex’s blockchain activity\ncombined with proprietary investigative techniques suggests to us that the OTC carried out\ncryptocurrency-for-cash exchanges on behalf of users at its Moscow and St. Petersburg\nbranch locations, but possibly at others as well.\n\n## Suex cryptocurrency addresses named in the OFAC SDN listing\n\nThe following Suex cryptocurrency addresses were named in OFAC’s SDN designation\nagainst the OTC broker:\n\n12HQDsicffSBaYdJ6BhnE22sfjTESmmzKx (BTC)\n1L4ncif9hh9TnUveqWq77HfWWt6CJWtrnb (BTC)\n13mnk8SvDGqsQTHbiGiHBXqtaQCUKfcsnP (BTC)\n1Edue8XZCWNoDBNZgnQkCCivDyr9GEo4x6 (BTC)\n1ECeZBxCVJ8Wm2JSN3Cyc6rge2gnvD3W5K (BTC)\n1J9oGoAiHeRfeMZeUnJ9W7RpV55CdKtgYE (BTC)\n1295rkVyNfFpqZpXvKGhDqwhP1jZcNNDMV (BTC)\n1LiNmTUPSJEd92ZgVJjAV3RT9BzUjvUCkx (BTC)\n1LrxsRd7zNuxPJcL5rttnoeJFy1y4AffYY (BTC)\n1KUUJPkyDhamZXgpsyXqNGc3x1QPXtdhgz (BTC)\n\n\n-----\n\n1CF46Rfbp97absrs7zb7dFfZS6qBXUm9EP (BTC)\n1Df883c96LVauVsx9FEgnsourD8DELwCUQ (BTC)\nBc1qdt3gml5z5n50y5hm04u2yjdphefkm0fl2zdj68 (BTC)\n1B64QRxfaa35MVkf7sDjuGUYAP5izQt7Qi (BTC)\n0x2f389ce8bd8ff92de3402ffce4691d17fc4f6535 (ETH)\n0x19aa5fe80d33a56d56c78e82ea5e50e5d80b4dff (ETH)\n0xe7aa314c77f4233c18c6cc84384a9247c0cf367b (ETH)\n0x308ed4b7b49797e1a98d3818bff6fe5385410370 (ETH)\n0x2f389ce8bd8ff92de3402ffce4691d17fc4f6535 (USDT)\n0x19aa5fe80d33a56d56c78e82ea5e50e5d80b4dff (USDT)\n1KUUJPkyDhamZXgpsyXqNGc3x1QPXtdhgz (USDT)\n1CF46Rfbp97absrs7zb7dFfZS6qBXUm9EP (USDT)\n1LrxsRd7zNuxPJcL5rttnoeJFy1y4AffYY (USDT)\n1Df883c96LVauVsx9FEgnsourD8DELwCUQ (USDT)\n16iWn2J1McqjToYLHSsAyS6En3QA8YQ91H (USDT)\n\nChainalysis has labeled these addresses in all of our products as being associated with a\nsanctioned entity and today will be alerting any customers with any exposure to these\naddresses.\n\n## A big win in the fight against money laundering\n\nShutting down cryptocurrency-based money launderers is one of the most important\nstrategies to combat cryptocurrency-related crime. It all comes down to incentives. If\ncybercriminals have no way of moving ill-gotten cryptocurrency to services where it can be\nstored safely or converted into cash, there’s much less reason for them to use\ncryptocurrency in the first place. A small group of illicit services facilitate the majority of\ncryptocurrency-based money laundering, and Suex is one of the worst offenders, so today’s\naction represents a positive step forward in the fight against cybercrime. We commend\nOFAC for making this designation and look forward to working with our partners in the public\nand private sectors to continue the fight against money laundering service providers.\n\n**_Want to learn more about the sanctions against Suex and what this means for the_**\n**_larger fight against ransomware?_** **_Watch Chainalysis investigators and U.S. Treasury_**\n**_executives discuss the Suex investigation and new OFAC guidance on sanctions risk_**\n**_for ransomware payments now._**\n\n\n-----",
