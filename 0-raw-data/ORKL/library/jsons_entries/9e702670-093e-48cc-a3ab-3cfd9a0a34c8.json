In cyber, this is turned around,” says Erik van de\nSandt, operational specialist with the Dutch National Police’s National High Tech Crime Unit.\n“They know what crimes are committed, but not who are behind these acts.”\n\n\n-----\n\nVan de Sandt, who holds a Ph.D. in computer science and serves as an honorary research\nfellow at the University of Bristol’s Cyber Security Research Group, both chases\ncybercriminals and studies them. He talked to Recorded Future expert threat intelligence\nanalyst Dmitry Smilyanets recently about how cybercriminals avoid detection and the\nchanges police departments need to make to pursue them. The interview was conducted via\nemail and has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\n**Dmitry Smilyanets: How would you rate law enforcement’s ability to catch**\n**cybercriminals?**\n\n**Erik van de Sandt: There is, unfortunately, a digital divide between law enforcement**\nagencies. Agencies do not have the same cyber capabilities. Let’s focus on those who excel\nin their work. In my opinion, several teams, departments, and agencies—the FBI, U.S.\nSecret Service, the U.K.’s National Crime Agency, Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office\nto name a few—truly understand their role within and added value for the broader\ncybersecurity community. They closely collaborate with the cybersecurity community, while\nshowing the self-confidence and authority that conducting truth-seeking investigations for\nprosecution purposes are the sole responsibility of governments.\n\nAttribution—who did what—is both science and art. Police investigators are specialized in\nmaking statements about reality that go beyond a reasonable doubt. But attribution is not an\neasy practice, and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are increasingly depending on\ncollaboration with the cybersecurity community. That is a blessing: many companies and\ninstitutions want to confront crime as well. Generally, these stakeholders have a far better\nsight on victims and attack infrastructure. Ultimately, LEAs too have to fill in the Diamond\nmodel—actors, capabilities, infrastructure, and victims—but rigorously, without making a\nsingle mistake. So ultimately, LEAs are about diligence, about checking and re-checking\nassumptions, verifying and falsifying hypotheses, until we can make factual statements,\nwhile the private security industry is about efficiency. That might be a field of tension, but I\nhave experienced so many situations in which LEAs and cyber threat companies were\nactively collaborating while acknowledging these differences. The major challenge is when\nidentified suspects are in a jurisdiction where extradition is difficult, and this happens\nregularly. Therefore, LEAs must formulate alternative interventions such as disrupting\ncriminal infrastructure, seizing assets, assisting victims, or writing threat analyses.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Dutch National Police’s National\n\nHigh Tech Crime Unit focuses on complex cybercrime investigations.\n**DS: In your view, is it harder to catch cybercriminals than other types of criminals? If**\n**so, what factors make it more difficult and how can the police overcome them?**\n\n**EvdS: There is a causal relation between on the one side the complexity of the security of**\ncriminals, and on the other side the duration and complexity of police investigations. While\nthere is academic, corporate, media, and political attention for attacks by the ‘bad guys’ and\ncybersecurity of the ‘good guys,’ the security practices of cybercriminals are largely known\nunknowns. Unless we know what cybercriminals secure, against whom, and to what extent,\nformulating effective offensive countermeasures—i.e., investigations—is a challenge.\n\nThe bad guys acknowledge the importance of security. Organized cybercrime and traditional\ncrime both put a lot of resources in protecting their members and crimes. There is nowadays\na complete underground economy for deviant security products and services. The security\nmeasures of both traditional and cybercriminals are comparable. Both distribute their assets\nover multiple jurisdictions, apply deception, use trust and distrust mechanisms, etc. Yet the\nemphasis and implementation might differ. Cybercriminals, for example, obviously rely more\non offensive technical security measures like DDoS-attacks to cover digital tracks, RATs to\nspy on co-conspirators, etc. But traditional criminals are catching up, and I expect that the\ndistinction between traditional organized crime and organized cybercrime will blur even more\nin the next few years. From an investigative point of view, the big difference between\ntraditional and cybercriminals is their manifestation in the physical world. Generally, LEAs\nknow who the traditional criminals are, but have a hard time to prove what they are doing. In\ncyber, this is turned around. LEAs know what crimes are committed, but not who are behind\nthese acts.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DS: What resources (tools, skills, etc.) do the most successful cybercrime police units**\n**invest in?**\n\n**EvdS: Simple answer: successful agencies invest in data science. We launched a white**\npaper with the first framework for data scientific investigations in March 2021. The framework\nis called CSAE (pronounced as ‘see-say’, and an abbreviation of Collect, Store, Analyze, and\nEngage). While CSAE focuses on LEAs, the framework is helpful for the academic and\ncorporate sector as well. Our data science approach is mixing the social/behavioral\nperspective of traditional investigators, technical perspective of digital (forensic) investigators\nwith the numerical perspective of police officers with a mathematical background. Together,\nthey are able to collect raw data, normalize and convert data into information, analyze the\ninformation and create intelligence, and eventually make factual statements about reality and\nexecute a range of interventions. These interventions go beyond the prosecution of\nsuspects, and include disruption of TTPs, victim assistance, and damage mitigation. We\nexplain in detail how data science is used in all four phases to create sight (i.e., hindsight,\nforesight, insight, and oversight) what to collect, what to store, what to analyze and what\ninterventions are needed. We have developed, tested and implemented this framework for\nthe last five years, and not only applied it to financially-driven cybercrime, but also drugstrafficking and child abuse images. I can truly say that the Dutch police now regards ‘big\nevidence’ as an opportunity, rather than a challenge.\n\n**DS: You’ve worked on many cases that crossed international borders. Indeed,**\n**cybercrime is often considered a crime that knows no borders. What are some of the**\n**biggest obstacles when working across borders, and how do you overcome them?**\n\n**EvdS: Policymakers, politicians, and legislators have done a lot to promote legal and**\norganizational harmonization such as signing international treaties and promoting operational\ncollaboration. So, in most instances, LEAs are allowed to share evidence with international\npartners and they know with whom they need to align their operations. But then a new\nproblem arises and everybody who participated in operational meetings recognizes the\nfollowing challenge. Generally, the output formats of one agency cannot be an input for\nanother agency because all agencies use different systems, software, formats, and data\nschemes. In practice, colleagues make exports in spreadsheets because that is the only\nformat their counterpart accepts. So what we miss is technical harmonization. Technical\nharmonization is about shared ethics and resources, and establishing technically uniform\nnorms, criteria, methods, and principles to process evidence by law enforcement agencies.\nWe have had some major technological breakthroughs at the Dutch National Police, such as\nvery advanced ETL-tooling [extraction, transformation, and loading]. We share these key\ntechnologies, including corresponding data schemes, with other law enforcement agencies in\nliberal democracies. That’s why we love industry standards such as MISP, Diamond, CRISPDM, and the Intelligence Cycle. CSAE builds upon these standards to push forward the new\nfield of data scientific investigations.\n\n\n-----\n\nI expect that the distinction between traditional organized crime and organized\ncybercrime will blur even more in the next few years.”\n\n**DS: Does having something like the EU make it easier to go after cybercriminals**\n**within its borders?**\n\n**EvdS: Yes definitely. The EU and Europol are examples of legal and organization**\nharmonization. It is nice to come together under a single roof and meet international\ncolleagues that share the same passion as you. I am always happy when we detect a\nmalicious server or identify a suspect within the EU because you’re certain that a\npreservation or an arrest will be a fact. The downside is, again, the lack of a shared language\nfor (data scientific) investigations. Imagine sitting for days in the same room with colleagues\nof 27 member states who all try to explain their business process… If you would make a\nmovie of that part of our job, the movie would be categorized as ‘comedy’ rather than ‘thriller.’\nCSAE was truly inspired to solve that problem and push towards technical harmonization.\n\n**DS: It seems like governments focus their indictments on state-sponsored APT**\n**groups, while ransomware operators and other criminals are a lower priority. Do you**\n**agree? If so, do you think the average citizen stands more to fear nation-state actors**\n**or criminal groups?**\n\n**EvdS: I agree, but we have to put this observation into context. Cybercrime exploded over**\nrecent years, and COVID accelerated events even more. Although governments have\ninvested in cybercrime units, the growth is quite linear as compared to the exponential\ngrowth of cybercrime. It takes time to hire, train, and build new investigation teams. There is\na bright side to the story—look for example at the Netherlands. In the past, my own team—\nthe National High Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU)—had to do all types of cybercrime\ninvestigations, from fake pop-up web shops to DDoS attacks. We also successfully\ninvestigated ransomware and set up the No More Ransomware Project. But such projects\nare very labor-intensive and gladly Europol adopted the project. Nowadays, all regional\npolice units in the Netherlands have fully functioning teams. On a national level, the regional\ncyber team of ‘Oost-Brabant’ set up a Dutch Ransomware Task Force and are responsible\nfor ransomware investigations. This really helps the NHTCU to focus on financially-driven\nAPTs and large cybercrime-as-a-service providers such as Emotet. So, while the NHTCU\nfocuses on harm to large companies and vital infrastructure, regional units focus more on\nharm to citizens and small and medium enterprises. Ransomware, unfortunately, harms\nsociety as a whole, and therefore the NHTCU closely collaborates with the regional unit of\n‘Oost-Brabant.’ By the way, this region is an economic powerhouse that holds a very high\nnumber of innovative companies (ranked 15th in the world based on the number of patents).\nThis creates a range of opportunities for the regional police unit. So, I am convinced that\nregional units are not lesser national units. If properly equipped, they will create their own\nniche, specialization, and network.\n\n\n-----\n\nA depiction of the CSAE process, or Collect, Store, Analyze, and Engage.\n**DS: Cryptocurrency has made ransomware attacks especially hard to trace, and there**\n**have been relatively few arrests in this area compared with the size of the damages.**\n**What’s the solution?**\n\n**EvdS: What I find fascinating is the concept of time. Cryptocurrencies are just a decade old,**\nbut revolutionized the commission and protection of crime. Against that background,\nlegislators, politicians, and policymakers have to come up with a range of interventions to\nregulate this new sector. The next step is the enforcement of these regulations. Supervisory\nand compliance institutions have to figure out how such a new sector works, who the bad\napples are, and if the sector is able to apply self-governance. Then there is the ultimum\nremedium of criminal investigations, and LEAs should indeed focus more on financial trails.\nReally good technical LE units tend to be poor in financial investigations and vice versa. But I\nhave seen the first examples of successful multidisciplinary LE teams, so I think the number\nof investigations against crypto money laundering schemes will slowly increase. At the same\ntime, there are parts of the world where there is no regulation or enforcement at all. As a\nconsequence, these jurisdictions become ‘crypto safe havens.’\n\n**DS: You published a very comprehensive work, The Technical Computer Security**\n**_Practices of Cyber Criminals—how would you summarize the security measures the_**\n**threat actors implement to avoid prosecution?**\n\n**EvdS: While the protective practices of cybercriminals are not necessarily deemed criminal**\nby law, security policies and mechanisms of cybercriminals frequently deviate from\nprescribed bonafide cybersecurity standards. As such, my study is the first to present a full\n\n\n-----\n\npicture on these deviant security practices, based on unique access to confidential sources\nrelated to some of the world’s most serious and organized cybercriminals. Besides\ndescribing the protection of crime and the criminal, the observed practices are explained by\nthe economics of deviant security: a combination of technical computer security principles\nand microeconomic theory. The new security paradigm lets us realize that cybercriminals\nhave many countermeasures at their disposal in the preparation, pre-activity, activity, and\npost-activity phases of their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Their controls are\nnot only driven by technical innovations, but also by cultural, economic, legal, and political\ndimensions. Deviant security is very much democratized, and indeed one of the prime\ncauses of today’s efficiency and effectiveness crisis in police investigations. Yet every modus\noperandi comes with all kinds of minor, major, and even unavoidable weaknesses, and\ntherefore suggestions are made how police investigations can exploit these vulnerabilities,\nwhile serving and protecting citizens.\n\n**DS: What are the most common mistakes cybercriminals make? What was the most**\n**epic one, in your experience?**\n\n**EvdS: I have so many examples… But generally, I like the ‘I-cannot-tell-my-girlfriend-about-**\nwhat-I-do-for-a-living-but-nevertheless-I-came-up-with-a-set-of-rules-that-she-did-not-obeysuch-as-not-using-my-computer-for-personal-stuff’ related mistakes. What I also like are\nreally complicated deviant security schemes that in theory are brilliant but are poorly\nexecuted in practice. I can really imagine somebody passionately telling a co-conspirer how\nto protect a TTP, only to imagine the frustration when he/she finds out that his/her partner\nlacks the same enthusiasm… Ultimately, human beings, including criminals and myself, are\nimperfect and prone to error.\n\nI have so many examples… But generally, I like the ‘I-cannot-tell-my-girlfriend-aboutwhat-I-do-for-a-living-but-nevertheless-I-came-up-with-a-set-of-rules-that-she-did-notobey-such-as-not-using-my-computer-for-personal-stuff’ related mistakes.”\n\n**DS: How do you see the threat landscape changing in the next 5 to 10 years?**\n\n**EvdS: Well, the future is today, and I described several trends in my new book The Deviant**\n_Security of Cyber Crime. More centralization towards, and collaboration between, a few big_\ncybercriminal key players. More professionalization, specialization, and niche players. More\ndisruptive actions without any regard for human costs. More acceptance of cybercrime as a\nlegitimate job in some parts of the world. More state-involvement as cybercrime becomes a\npolitical tool in an ever-increasing multipolar world. And all of this against a background of an\never-increasing number of cybercriminals and increasingly complex—thus vulnerable—\nnetworks and systems.\n\n**DS: What is your opinion on ransomware? What is the most effective method to**\n**combat ransomware?**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EvdS: Society as a whole still does not take information security seriously. Apparently,**\ncorporations immediately save on information security during economic crises, while more\nindividuals are drawn into crime during such times of hardship. Dmitry, I knock every now\nand then on the door of Recorded Future for a chat. We discussed ransomware in the past,\nand your analysis is spot on when you said that this is one of the biggest threats.\nUnauthorized access to networks is nowadays fully monetized by criminals, with ransomware\nas the icing on the cake. Companies will end up with all their data stolen, paying a high price\nfor ransom, while their customers are victimized because of compromised client databases.\nSo, a proactive stance on information security is key, including cyberthreat intelligence for a\nlarger group than only those who can afford it. When an incident occurs, collaboration is vital\nand this is going in the right direction. But I also see a growing number of legitimate\ncompanies that make a living out of ransomware attacks such as insurance companies,\nemergency response teams, and even startups that focus on ransomware negotiations. Time\nwill tell whether these new kids on the block will collaborate with the broader cybersecurity\ncommunity, or not.\n\n**DS: What industry do you worry about the most? Who do you feel is least prepared for**\n**cyberattacks?**\n\n**EvdS: There are quite some companies in the world with large revenues and a low number**\nof employees that nobody knows. These companies seem to be interesting targets because\nthey really focus on making a profit and try to avoid overhead, including security. Just a\npersonal anecdote: in the Netherlands, we have many companies in the agriculture industry\nthat fit within this profile. Once, I had to call such a company on a Friday evening because\nwe received intelligence that their email system was compromised. Because of CEO fraud,\n**€200,000 was wired to China. An assistant gave me the cell number of—let us say—CEO**\nPeter. His company had a turnover of over a billion euros a year while only employing 20\npeople at their HQ. When I told him how much was lost, Peter was relieved: only €200,000!\nBut he also told me frankly that his company was putting all their efforts in acquisitioning\ncompanies around the world, and this incident was just the downside of that strategy.\n\n**DS: There have often been fears expressed about collaboration between more**\n**traditional organized crime groups and cybercriminal groups. Have you ever seen**\n**instances of cooperation between the two?**\n\n**EvdS: In 2013, the NHTCU investigated a case where Dutch drug traffickers deployed a**\nhacker to access the network of the port of Antwerp. Since then, we have had a number of\ncases where traditional criminals relied on cybercriminals, mostly hackers-for-hire. But this\nwill change—traditional criminals, such as drug traffickers, need bulletproof internet\nconnections, servers, communications, payments, etc. CyberBunker is a nice example of this\npattern. I am also curious how the cybersecurity industry will respond to this trend.\n\n**DS: Tell me a secret, what was the most exciting case you investigated?**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EvdS: In October 2021, I will celebrate my 12 ½ years in cyber service, a milestone!**\nGenerally, our job ensures that you will have a lot of exciting stories that you cannot share.\nAlthough I experienced cases that involved espionage, hundreds of millions of stolen dollars,\nand massive undercover ops, an investigation against a bulletproof hoster was emotionally\nmore satisfying. I generally focus on intelligence and the preparatory investigative phase,\nand I overlooked that these suspects were also involved in the commercial distribution of\nchild sexual abuse images. My initial feelings of guilt were replaced by absolute pride when\nmy extremely talented colleagues successfully investigated all crimes committed, including\nthose against children. Although it was their success, you feel part of a team with a mission,\nand that’s what motivates me to work at the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit.\n\nMission-driven and Russian-speaking intelligence analyst with type A personality.
