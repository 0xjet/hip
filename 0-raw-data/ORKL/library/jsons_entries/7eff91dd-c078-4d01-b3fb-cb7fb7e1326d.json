Key findings\n\n     - The Russian autonomous system PROSPERO (AS200593) could be linked with a high level\n\nof confidence to **_Proton66_** **(AS198953), another Russian AS, that we believe to be**\n\nconnected to the bulletproof services named 'SecureHost' and 'BEARHOST'. We notably\n\nobserved that both network’s configurations are almost identical in terms of peering\n\nagreements and their respective share of loads throughout time.\n\n     - Amongst the activities shared by the two networks, we noticed that both GootLoader and\n\n**SpyNote malwares recently changed their infrastructure of** **command-and-control**\n\n**servers and** **phishing pages from** _PROSPERO_ to _Proton66. Additionally, the domains_\n\nhosting the phishing pages deploying SpyNote were hosted on either one of the two AS\n\nand had already been used in previous campaigns delivering **revoked AnyDesk** and\n\n**LiveChat** **versions for both Windows and Mac.**\n\n     - Regarding the other malicious activities found on _PROSPERO’s IPs, we found that_\n\nthroughout September, multiple **SMS spam campaigns targeting citizens from various**\n\ncountries were leading to phishing domains hosted on _PROSPERO_ and _Proton66. While_\n\nmost phishing templates were usurping bank login pages to steal credit card details, we\n\nalso noticed that some of them were used to deploy **android spywares such as Coper**\n\n(a.k.a. Octo).\n\n     - **SocGholish, another initial access broker (IAB) that we found to be hosting a major part**\n\nof its infrastructure on _Proton66, continues to leverage this autonomous system to host_\n\n**fingerprinting scripts contained on the websites it infects. Along SocGholish, we found out**\n\nthat **FakeBat, another loader that infects systems through compromised websites, was**\n\nusing the same IPs to host both screening and redirection scripts.\n\n# 2. Introduction\n\nIn the continuity of our constant monitoring of bulletproof networks, we discovered **an**\n\n**autonomous system named PROSPERO OOO (AS200593)** based in Russia. We believe that it could\n\nbe linked to Proton66 OOO (AS198953), another Russian and anonymous autonomous system that\n\nwe previously found to be connected to a bigger infrastructure composed of multiple AS and offshore\n\ncompanies all operated by a common Russian national. This individual notably promotes its\n\nbulletproof hosting businesses named 'UNDERGROUND' and 'BEARHOST' on various Russian-speaking\n\nunderground marketplaces stating that the service is “100% bulletproof […] we completely ignore all\n\n_abuses and complaints, including Spamhaus”. He notably used to work with another bulletproof_\n\nprovider named 'SecureHost', advertised on the same underground platforms that we believe with a\n\nhigh level of confidence to be the present operator of both PROSPERO OOO and Proton66 OOO.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Bulletproof hosting\n\nA bulletproof hosting service is a type of web hosting service known for offering **high levels of**\n**privacy, security, and leniency regarding the content and activities allowed on their servers. These**\n\nservices typically provide robust protection against **takedown requests,** **legal actions, and** **law**\n**enforcement investigations, often by locating their servers in jurisdictions with** **minimal**\n\n**regulations or weak enforcement of international laws. Bulletproof hosting is often associated with**\n**hosting illicit content or activities, such as malware distribution, spam operations, or copyright-**\n\n**infringing materials, due to its permissive stance and commitment to client confidentiality.**\nHowever, it's important to note that not all uses of such services are illegal, as some users may seek\n\nsuch hosting for legitimate privacy concerns.\n\n\nThe connection between PROSPERO and Proton66 could be made through similarities in the way both\n\nnetworks are operated, notably in their respective peering agreements shared with other Russian\n\nnetworks. Additionally, we noticed that botnets operated by GootLoader, an initial access broker, and\n\n**SpyNote, an android RAT, had moved their infrastructure from** _PROSPERO_ to _Proton66, or would_\n\nsometimes host their command-and-control servers on both AS. We previously noticed the same\n\n[occurrence in the Matanbuchus campaigns that we reported in May 2024 (see blog post), where the](https://www.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TLP-CLEAR-Matanbuchus-Co-Code-Emulation-and-Cybercrime-Infrastructure-Discovery-1.pdf)\n\nC2s were hosted on both _Chang Way Technologies and Proton66. This could potentially mean that_\n\n_Proton66 was operated by BEARHOST, as we unveiled his administration role of_ _Chang Way_\n\n_Technologies Co. Limited (AS207566). Along those finds, this report aims to provide an overview of all_\n\nthe malicious activities that are hosted on PROSPERO OOO.\n\n\n##### Legal format of Russian companies\n\nAs a reminder, the Russian format “OOO” stands for “Obschestvo s Ogranichennoy\n\n**Otvetstvennostyu” which corresponds to the Anglo-Saxon format “LLC” or “limited liability**\n**company”.**\n\n\n# 3. Linking Hostway and Chang Way to Proton66\n\n### 3.1. Hostway and Chang Way\n\nDuring a previous private investigation on BEARHOST’s network, we described how multiple\n\ncompanies and websites were used as legal fronts for his bulletproof hosting business advertised on\n\nunderground forums.\n\nThis started with the company Hostway LLC, registered in Russia in 2019, from which he was appointed\n\nthe role of director[1]. The billing page of the company’s website (billing.hostway[.]ru) displays a clear\n\nrelation with **_Chang Way Technologies Co. Limited, a_** **Hong Kongese company operating its own**\n\nautonomous system AS207566.\n\n1 _[https://www.rusprofile.ru/id/11936277](https://www.rusprofile.ru/id/11936277)_\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Login page hosted on billing.hostway[.]ru._\n\nThe website is also hosted on AS207566, which is part of an as-set named 'AS-SET-HOSTWAY'.[2] Finally,\n\nto strengthen the bond that these two companies share, AS207566’s description previously was\n\n“HOSTWAY-AS”, before changing to 'CHANGWAY007-AS' in May 2022.[3] Based on those elements, we\n\ncan assess with _a high level of confidence that this Russian national could also be the director of_\n\n_Chang Way Technologies Co. Limited._\n\nHowever, the website currently displays the name of an offshore **Cypriot company ”Starcrecium**\n\n_Limited” and not its original company_ _Hostway LLC. This is probably with the intention of hiding the_\n\npast mistake that he made of registering a company with his own name in Russia and taking\n\nadvantage of Cyprus’ favourable tax regime and overall corporate confidentiality.\n\n### 3.2. IT Resheniya LLC and Proton66 LLC\n\nIn addition to AS207566, Hostway LLC can be linked to another Russian autonomous system\n\nnamed “IT Resheniya LLC” or ООО \"АйТи Решения\" (AS49943). Despite redirecting to an offline website\n\n“rentaserv[.]ru”, this autonomous system used to display Hostway’s website 'hostway[.]ru' in its Whois\n\ndetails.\n\nIndeed, the following Whois information from May 2023 of one of AS49943’s IPv4 range '5.42.199[.]0/24'\n\nused to display Hostway’s website:\n\n\norganisation: ORG-ITR1-RIPE\norg-name: IT Resheniya LLC\n\nIT REShENIYa LLC | LLC AyTi Resheniya | ООО \"АйТи Решения\"\n\nul. Novoselov, d. 8A, of. 692\nRU-193079 Saint Petersburg, Russie\n\nTel: +7 903 271 28 22\nEmails: itresh7811764289@yandex.ru | abuse@hostway.ru\n\nWebsites: http://itreshenia.ru | http://www.hostway.ru\n\n\n_[2 https://bgp.he.net/irr/as-set/AS-SET-HOSTWAY](https://bgp.he.net/irr/as-set/AS-SET-HOSTWAY)_\n\n_[3 https://bgpranking.circl.lu/](https://bgpranking.circl.lu/)_\n\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\nOverall, IT Resheniya LLC announced three IPv4 ranges, all owned by the same company “Proton66\n\n_LLC”._\n\nIPv4 range Company name\n\n194.32.236[.]0/24 Proton66 LLC\n\n213.226.123[.]0/24 Proton66 LLC\n\n5.42.199[.]0/24 Proton66 LLC\n\n_Proton66 LLC or ООО \"Протон66\", happen to possess its own autonomous system; AS198953, which was_\n\nnotably used to host a project that was created before Hostway named 'cyberpol[.]net' that shared\n\nthe same email address 'dl@hostway[.]ru' as 'hostway[.]ru'. Before being turned off, the website\n\ndisplayed the same addresses as Starcrecium Limited in Cyprus and Chang Way Technologies Co.\n\n_Limited in Hong Kong on the contact form._\n\nFurthermore, one can notice the similarities in the websites design in the figure below (figure 2). While\n\nthese elements may not constitute an undeniable proof that Proton66 OOO could be operated by the\n\nsame person as Hostway LLC, it already constitutes a strong lead towards this hypothesis.\n\n_Figure 2. Snippet of the websites cyberpol[.]net and hostway[.]ru._\n\n### 3.3. Intel from clashes between bulletproof providers\n\nIn July 2023, a client of the bulletproof service “SecureHost” filed a complaint on an\n\nunderground forum against the owner of the service. In the complaint, the client states that\n\nSecureHost had scammed him “under a false name”. Indeed, the client tried to contact BEARHOST\n\n(the bulletproof provider that we previously mentioned) through Telegram with an old contact of his\n\nbut was instead answered by SecureHost.\n\n© I t i\n\n|IPv4 range|Company name|\n|---|---|\n|194.32.236[.]0/24|Proton66 LLC|\n|213.226.123[.]0/24|Proton66 LLC|\n|5.42.199[.]0/24|Proton66 LLC|\n\n\n-----\n\nUnintentionally, this complaint unveiled the relationship between the two bulletproof providers, as\n\nBEARHOST immediately answered to the complaint by explaining in a long paragraph how his previous\n\nTelegram “@bearhost” had been hacked and was now under the control of SecureHost.\n\nIn his complaint, the user happened to provide a proof of their exchange with screenshots even\n\ndisplaying the two IPs that were given to him: '45.140.17[.]3' and '45.134.26[.]63', both part of AS198953\n\n– Proton66 OOO. Clearly implicating that SecureHost is operating Proton66 OOO.\n\n\n##### SecureHost\n\nSecureHost is a bulletproof hosting provider advertised since 2022 on underground Russian\nspeaking forums. It notably declares **ignoring DMCA and** **Spamhaus requests. The servers are**\nlocated in Russia, with a direct access to an Internet Exchange Point (IX).\n\n\nThe following layout (figure 3) aims to summarize the links that we could find between the previously\n\nmentioned entities and highlight the key elements strongly suggesting that they could be part of a\n\ncommon network.\n\n_Figure 3. Layout of the links that the above-mentioned entities share with one another._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n# 4. Linking Proton66 to PROSPERO\n\n### 4.1. Network infrastructure similarities\n\nWe noticed that, in October 2024, _Proton66 OOO_ (AS198953) shared almost the **same**\n\n**percentage of peering agreements[4] with larger Russian ISPs as another anonymous Russian**\n\nautonomous system named PROSPERO OOO (AS200593). Indeed, Both AS get their upstream from the\n\n**same ISPs with almost the same percentage of load and are both connected in the datacentre PITER-**\n\n**IX located in St. Petersburg.[5]This corroborates with SecureHost’ statements, that mentioned how his**\n\nnetwork is directly connected to an internet exchange point in Russia.\n\nAS3216 AS9002 AS35000\n\n_PROSPERO OOO_ **51%** **35%** **11%**\n\nAS200593\n\n_Proton66 OOO_ **44.6%** **29.7%** **22.8%**\n\nAS198953\n\n_Source: Hurricane Electric._\n\n_Figure 4. Pie charts of the percentage of load shared with the above-mentioned autonomous_\n\n_systems.

Pie charts of the percentage of load shared with the above-mentioned autonomous_\n\n_systems.

The network’s links with Access Brokers\n\n### 5.1. GootLoader’s command-and-control servers\n\n**GootLoader is an** **initial access broker known for leveraging SEO techniques and**\n\ncompromised WordPress websites to make them host fake forum discussions related to trending or\n\ncommon topics that users may search on search engines; the most common subjects being related\n\nto legal or financial issues. Deepwatch notably discovered[6] that a compromised WordPress website\n\ncould host up to 200 blog posts covering all kinds of subjects.\n\nRegarding GootLoader affiliation with PROSPERO, as mentioned on a blog post[7] operated by an\n\nanonymous security researcher “dedicated to pissing off the GootLoader threat actor” (as he\n\nindicates), GootLoader recently changed its command-and-control server in early September 2024.\n\nIt moved from 'temporary[.]fail' hosted on '91.215.85[.]21' along '91.215.85[.]111', both owned by\n\n_PROSPERO OOO, to 'setting[.]cc' hosted on '45.135.232[.]53'_ and owned by Proton66 OOO.\n\nThe operators of GootLoader seem to be long-time clients of _PROSPERO: in_ **February 2023 the DFIR**\n\nReport reported[8] on an intrusion that started with a GootLoader infection in which the threat actor\n\ndeployed a Cobalt Strike beacon with watermark 206546002. The payload then communicated with\n\na C2 hosted on another IP owned by PROSPERO: '91.215.85[.]143'.\n\n\n##### Leveraged by ransomware affiliates\n\nAccording to a tweet[9] by Microsoft posted in September, GootLoader was notably observed being\n\nused as an initial access vector for ransomware attacks operated by the INC ransomware group\nto target US healthcare providers.\n\nAdditionally, CrowdStrike revealed that Vice Spider, a cybercrime threat actor that used to deploy\nthe Rhysida ransomware, has been leveraging GootLoader for initial access purposes since at least\n\nJune 2024. More recently in October 2024, Vice Spider used it to access two U.S-based entities.[10]\nIn August 2024, CISA notably warned in its #StopRansomware report[11] that BlackSuit actors used\n\nSystemBC and GootLoader to “load additional tools and maintain persistence”.\n\n\n### 5.2. SpyNote infrastructure\n\n**SpyNote is a malware targeting Android users usually via fake applications. Once installed on**\n\nthe victim’s machine, SpyNote exfiltrates sensitive information such as the **device’s location,** **the**\n\n**contacts list, SMS, and can record audios or phone calls.**\n\nWe recently discovered an infrastructure of domains hosted on _PROSPERO_ distributing SpyNote\n\npayloads through **fake Chrome updates. Once one is visiting those domains, the download of a**\n\nSpyNote APK would launch automatically. When executed, some payloads would communicate with\n\n6 _https://5556002.fs1.hubspotusercontent-_\n\n_[na1.net/hubfs/5556002/2022%20PDF%20Download%20Assets/ADA%20Compliant%20pdfs/Reports/PUBLIC_Gootloa](https://5556002.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5556002/2022%20PDF%20Download%20Assets/ADA%20Compliant%20pdfs/Reports/PUBLIC_Gootloader%20-%20Foreign%20Intelligence%20Service.pdf)_\n_[der%20-%20Foreign%20Intelligence%20Service.pdf](https://5556002.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5556002/2022%20PDF%20Download%20Assets/ADA%20Compliant%20pdfs/Reports/PUBLIC_Gootloader%20-%20Foreign%20Intelligence%20Service.pdf)_\n\n_[7 https://gootloader.wordpress.com/2024/09/05/gootloader-c2-sails-to-new-hoster-and-new-url/](https://gootloader.wordpress.com/2024/09/05/gootloader-c2-sails-to-new-hoster-and-new-url/)_\n\n_[8 https://thedfirreport.com/2024/02/26/seo-poisoning-to-domain-control-the-gootloader-saga-continues/](https://thedfirreport.com/2024/02/26/seo-poisoning-to-domain-control-the-gootloader-saga-continues/)_\n\n_[9 https://x.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1836456417315656076](https://x.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1836456417315656076)_\n\n_10_ _CrowdStrike CSA-241150_\n\n_11_ _[https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-061a](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-061a)_\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 '45.94.31[.]96' on port 7544, and others with '45.141.58[.]120' on port 5353.

Simultaneously distributing revoked AnyDesk versions\n\nBefore deploying SpyNote, some of these domains were used to distribute revoked AnyDesk\n\n**versions for both Windows and Mac. For example, the domain “avastcsw[.]com” hosted on PROSPERO**\n\nIP 91.215.85[.]79, continues to host both AnyDesk on URL 'avastcsw[.]com/anydesk.dmg', and SpyNote\n\non URL 'avastcsw[.]com/Avastavv.apk'.\n\n\n##### AnyDesk leaked data\n\nIn January 2024, the French Cybersecurity Agency ANSSI released a security bulletin[12] regarding the\n\ndata leak suffered by AnyDesk Software GmbH, resulting in private keys and certificates disclosure\nand thus forcing the company to revoke some versions of the software. Those campaigns prove\n\nthat this leak continues to be abused by threat actors in campaigns distributing revoked versions.\n\n\n12 _[https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/alerte/CERTFR-2024-ALE-003/](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/alerte/CERTFR-2024-ALE-003/)_\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8.

SocGholish fingerprinting scripts\n\nPlaced on the 11[th] position of most seen malwares C2 in Spamhaus’ threat update of January\n\nto June 2024[13], SocGholish is a loader used as an initial access vector for ransomware attacks. It was\n\nnotably used by ransomware groups such as Evil Corp and LockBit.[14]\n\nWe mentioned in a previous analysis[15] how SocGholish was hosting its fingerprinting script on domain\n\n'marvin-occentus[.]net/statistic/js/stat.js' resolving the IP **91.212.166[.]21 owned by** _Proton66 OOO_ –\n\nAS198953. We recently discovered that SocGholish was still using that IP to host a new domain for its\n\nfingerprinting script: 'www-wpx[.]net/assets/core.js'.\n\nThis new URL and script can already be found in many infected websites (see “Indicators of\n\ncompromise” section of this report) and redirects to the same domain that we previously found:\n\n'pluralism.themancav[.]com'.\n\n13 _[https://info.spamhaus.com/hubfs/Botnet%20Reports/Jan-Jun%202024%20Botnet%20Threat%20Update.pdf](https://info.spamhaus.com/hubfs/Botnet%20Reports/Jan-Jun%202024%20Botnet%20Threat%20Update.pdf)_\n\n_[14 https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc2165-shifts-to-evade-sanctions?hl=en](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc2165-shifts-to-evade-sanctions?hl=en)_\n\n_[15 https://www.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TLP-CLEAR-Matanbuchus-Co-Code-Emulation-and-](https://www.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TLP-CLEAR-Matanbuchus-Co-Code-Emulation-and-Cybercrime-Infrastructure-Discovery-1.pdf)_\n_[Cybercrime-Infrastructure-Discovery-1.pdf](https://www.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TLP-CLEAR-Matanbuchus-Co-Code-Emulation-and-Cybercrime-Infrastructure-Discovery-1.pdf)_\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 5.3.1. FakeBat scripts\n\nOn the same IP '91.212.166[.]21', a domain hosting a different script could also be found:\n\n'letmespellmoons[.]com/bg/js/stat.js/', this time operated by another loader named “FakeBat”, a\n\nmalware regularly mistaken with SocGholish. This specific script was used to display a fake Chrome\n\nupdate template depending on the system language of the victim visiting the website infected with\n\nFakeBat’s script.\n\n_Figure 9. Content of the script found on websites infected by FakeBat._\n\nOnce the victim tries to download this fake update, the payload is downloaded from a different\n\ndomain also hosted on the same IPs:\n\n  - doggygangers[.]com/YfMv2QsjpCQl845BWSYNfNOQitweyze_Z6lIlrRr43MRjX_HrM/get_downl\n\noad_file_name.php\n\nThis domain was previously found in an investigation[16] led by eSentire in April 2024, regarding a\n\nFakeBat campaign. Nonetheless, they didn’t mention at that time the other domain\n\n“letmespellmoons[.]com” that we found to be hosting FakeBat’s fingerprinting script.\n\n16 _[https://www.esentire.com/blog/fakebat-malware-distributing-via-fake-browser-updates](https://www.esentire.com/blog/fakebat-malware-distributing-via-fake-browser-updates)_\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n# 6. Leveraging PROSPERO for ransomware activities\n\nAmong the other malwares that briefly used PROSPERO for their infrastructure, we can mention\n\nthe ransomware group “Buthi” in 2023, in an incident reported by Symantec,[17] and the ransomware\n\ngroup “Mallox” in September 2024, mentioned in a blog post written by Securelist.[18]\n\nThe botnet Gozi used IPs managed by PROSPERO for its command-and-control servers in campaigns\n\ntargeting Italian companies in 2023.[ 19] This Russian-speaking group notably changed activities from\n\nbanking account theft to initial access for its own ransomware group.[20]\n\n**PikaBot, the successor of** **QakBot, known for deploying the** **BlackBasta ransomware, also used**\n\nmultiple IPs from PROSPERO to host its command-and-control servers as reported by Sekoia[21] in June\n\n2024.\n\nIn February 2023, The DFIR Report responded to an incident[22] that started with an IcedID infection,\n\nanother initial access broker, and ended with the encryption of the victim’s network by the Nokoyawa\n\nransomware group. In this attack the threat actor used a PROSPERO IP for its Cobalt Strike C2.\n\n# 7. Deploying Coper (Octo) spyware in Greece\n\nAlong SpyNote, we found another spyware targeting android devices named “Coper”, being\n\nhosted on domains spoofing the Greek bank _Alpha Bank. For example, the URL “allphaa-_\n\n_gr[.]com/assets/myAlpha.apk”, hosted on PROSPERO IP '91.215.85[.]79', would launch the download of_\n\na Coper infected APK when visited. These malicious domains were spread to Greek citizens through\n\nSMS spam campaigns.\n\nWhen executed, the Coper APK would communicate with two C2 servers hosted on a different\n\n_PROSPERO IP '91.202.233[.]138':_\n\n  - _mine-495834[.]xyz_\n\n  - _mine-495834[.]net_\n\nThis specific range, '91.202.233[.]0/24', was notably added to the Spamhaus blocklist (SBL631395)[23] in\n\nDecember 2023.\n\n17 _[https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/threat-intelligence/buhti-ransomware](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/threat-intelligence/buhti-ransomware)_\n\n_[18 https://securelist.com/mallox-ransomware/113529/](https://securelist.com/mallox-ransomware/113529/)_\n\n_[19 https://x.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/1641002609765916672](https://x.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/1641002609765916672)_\n\n_[20 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ursnif-malware-switches-from-bank-account-theft-to-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ursnif-malware-switches-from-bank-account-theft-to-initial-access/)_\n_[initial-access/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ursnif-malware-switches-from-bank-account-theft-to-initial-access/)_\n\n_[21 https://blog.sekoia.io/pikabot-a-guide-to-its-deep-secrets-and-operations/](https://blog.sekoia.io/pikabot-a-guide-to-its-deep-secrets-and-operations/)_\n\n_[22 https://thedfirreport.com/2024/04/01/from-onenote-to-ransomnote-an-ice-cold-intrusion/](https://thedfirreport.com/2024/04/01/from-onenote-to-ransomnote-an-ice-cold-intrusion/)_\n\n_[23 https://check.spamhaus.org/results/?query=SBL631395](https://check.spamhaus.org/results/?query=SBL631395)_\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10.

Conclusion\n\nInvestigating those networks unveiled additional malware infrastructures and reinforced our\n\nbeliefs on these autonomous systems’ malicious nature. Finding the links between them expanded\n\nour capacities to map the entire infrastructure of this bulletproof provider. This enabled us to block\n\nmore efficiently the threats hosted on them, from loaders operated by initial access brokers providing\n\nan entry into corporate networks for ransomware groups, to fraud schemes and phishing pages in\n\ngeneral.\n\nInternational cooperation is often required to tackle cybercrime, and political tensions can complicate\n\nor delay this process. Russia in this case, may not always cooperate with international takedown\n\nrequests, particularly if it perceive it as intrusive or politically motivated. Such actors like bulletproof\n\nservices based in Russia, could be considered as “Privateer” groups, a concept first introduced by\n\nTalos[27], defining them as groups that “are not sponsored directly by a state and are financially\n\n_motivated but do benefit from direct or indirect protection from that state […] The protecting state_\n\n_[Russia] doesn't receive direct benefit from these groups, but it is shielded from their activities, which_\n\n_frequently target the geopolitical adversaries of the protecting state”. Both services analysed in this_\n\nreport indeed mentioned how the malicious activities operated by their clients couldn’t be operated\n\nagainst countries of the CIS region.\n\nTherefore, as long as bigger ISPs do not “de-peer” with those networks and provide them with\n\nconnectivity to the internet, the activities hosted on their servers will continue to prosper.\n\n27 [https://blog.talosintelligence.com/privateer-groups/](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/privateer-groups/)\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n# 11.
