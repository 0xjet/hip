    "plain_text": "# Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to Compromise Enterprise and Cloud Environments\n\n## Executive summary\n\nSince at least mid-2019 through early 2021, Russian General Staff Main Intelligence\nDirectorate (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS), military unit 26165, used\na Kubernetes[®] cluster to conduct widespread, distributed, and anonymized brute force\naccess attempts against hundreds of government and private sector targets worldwide.\nGTsSS malicious cyber activity has previously been attributed by the private sector\nusing the names Fancy Bear, APT28, Strontium, and a variety of other identifiers. The\n85[th] GTsSS directed a significant amount of this activity at organizations using Microsoft\nOffice 365[®] cloud services; however, they also targeted other service providers and onpremises email servers using a variety of different protocols. These efforts are almost\ncertainly still ongoing.\n\nThis brute force capability allows the 85[th] GTsSS actors to access protected data,\nincluding email, and identify valid account credentials. Those credentials may then be\nused for a variety of purposes, including initial access, persistence, privilege escalation,\nand defense evasion. The actors have used identified account credentials in conjunction\nwith exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities, such as exploiting Microsoft Exchange\nservers using CVE 2020-0688 and CVE 2020-17144, for remote code execution and\nfurther access to target networks. After gaining remote access, many well-known\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are combined to move laterally, evade\ndefenses, and collect additional information within target networks.\n\nNetwork managers should adopt and expand usage of multi-factor authentication to\nhelp counter the effectiveness of this capability. Additional mitigations to ensure strong\naccess controls include time-out and lock-out features, the mandatory use of strong\npasswords, implementation of a Zero Trust security model that uses additional attributes\nwhen determining access, and analytics to detect anomalous accesses. Additionally,\norganizations can consider denying all inbound activity from known anonymization\nservices, such as commercial virtual private networks (VPNs) and The Onion Router\n(TOR), where such access is not associated with typical use.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Description of targets\n\nThis campaign has already targeted hundreds of U.S. and foreign organizations\nworldwide, including U.S. government and Department of Defense entities. While the\nsum of the targeting is global in nature, the capability has predominantly focused on\nentities in the U.S. and Europe. Types of targeted organizations include:\n\n\nGovernment and military\n\norganizations[[1]]\n\nEnergy companies\n\nHigher education\n\ninstitutions\n\n## Known TTPs\n\n\nPolitical consultants and\n\nparty organizations[[2]]\n\nLogistics companies\n\nLaw firms\n\n\nDefense contractors\n\nThink tanks\n\nMedia companies\n\n\nThe actors used a combination of known TTPs in addition to their password spray\noperations to exploit target networks, access additional credentials, move laterally, and\ncollect, stage, and exfiltrate data, as illustrated in the figure below. The actors used a\nvariety of protocols, including HTTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3, and NTLM. The actors also\nutilized different combinations of defense evasion TTPs in an attempt to disguise some\ncomponents of their operations; however, many detection opportunities remain viable to\nidentify the malicious activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Example of several TTPs used together as part of this type of brute force campaign_**\n\nThe following table summarizes the known TTPs used in conjunction with the password\nspray capability. As the structure of target networks can vary greatly, the 85[th] GTsSS\nmay employ a subset of these TTPs, or other TTPs not included in this summary,\nagainst different victims.\n\n**_Table I: Summary of known tactics, techniques, and procedures_**\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Procedure/Comments**\n\nThe actors used a variety of public exploits, including CVE\n2020-0688 and CVE 2020-17144 to gain privileged\n\nT1190[1] - Exploitation of\n\nremote code execution on vulnerable Microsoft Exchange\n\nInitial Access Public Facing\n\nservers.

Authentication attempts that did not use TOR\nor a VPN service were also occasionally delivered directly to targets from nodes in the\nKubernetes cluster.\n\nThe scalable nature of the password spray capability means that specific indicators of\ncompromise (IOC) can be easily altered to bypass IOC-based mitigation. In addition to\nblocking activity associated with the specific indicators listed in this Cybersecurity\n\nAdvisory, organizations should consider denying all inbound activity from known TOR\nnodes and other public VPN services to exchange servers or portals where such access\nis not associated with typical use.\n\n### IP addresses\n\nAlthough the exact makeup of the Kubernetes cluster may change over time, a number\nof nodes have been identified as responsible for sending and routing the brute force\nauthentication attempts. At some point between November 2020 and March 2021, the\n\nfollowing IP addresses were identified as corresponding to nodes in the Kubernetes\ncluster:\n\n\n-----\n\n  - 158.58.173[.]40\n\n  - 185.141.63[.]47\n\n  - 185.233.185[.]21\n\n  - 188.214.30[.]76\n\n  - 195.154.250[.]89\n\n### User agents\n\n\n\n- 93.115.28[.]161\n\n- 95.141.36[.]180\n\n- 77.83.247[.]81\n\n- 192.145.125[.]42\n\n- 193.29.187[.]60\n\n\nIn cases where HTTP was the underlying protocol used to deliver authentication\nrequests, the actors used many different User-Agent strings, which are crafted to\nappear consistent with those sent by legitimate client software. Some of the User-Agent\nstrings delivered in the authentication requests are incomplete or truncated versions of\nlegitimate User-Agent strings, offering the following unique detection opportunities:\n\n  - ‘Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/70.’\n\n  - ‘Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\n\nGecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.110 Safari/537.36’\n\n  - ‘Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:63.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/63.0’\n\n  - ‘Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.110 Safari/537.36’\n\n  - ‘Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_1) AppleWebKit/605.1.15\n(KHTML, like Gecko) Version/12.0.1 Safari/605.1.15’\n\n  - ‘Microsoft Office/14.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Microsoft Outlook 14.0.7162; Pro’\n\n  - ‘Microsoft Office/14.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Microsoft Outlook 14.0.7166; Pro)’\n\n  - ‘Microsoft Office/14.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Microsoft Outlook 14.0.7143; Pro)’\n\n  - ‘Microsoft Office/15.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Microsoft Outlook 15.0.4605; Pro)’\n\n### Yara rule\n\nThe following Yara rule matches the reGeorg variant web shell used by the actors. As\nthis is a publicly available web shell, the rule does not uniquely identify 85[th] GTsSS\nmalicious activity.[[3]]\n```\nrule reGeorg_Variant_Web shell {\n strings:\n $pageLanguage = \"<%@ Page Language=\\\"C#\\\"\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n $obfuscationFunction = \"StrTr\"\n $target = \"target_str\"\n $IPcomms = \"System.Net.IPEndPoint\"\n $addHeader = \"Response.AddHeader\"\n $socket = \"Socket\"\n condition:\n 5 of them\n}\n\n### General mitigations\n\n```\nAs with mitigations for other credential theft techniques, organizations can take the\nfollowing measures to ensure strong access control:\n\n  - Use multi-factor authentication with strong factors and require regular reauthentication[[4]]. Strong authentication factors are not guessable, so they would\nnot be guessed during brute force attempts.\n\n  - Enable time-out and lock-out features whenever password authentication is\nneeded. Time-out features should increase in duration with additional failed login\nattempts. Lock-out features should temporarily disable accounts after many\nconsecutive failed attempts. This can force slower brute force attempts, making\nthem infeasible.\n\n  - Some services can check passwords against common password dictionaries\nwhen users change passwords, denying many poor password choices before\nthey are set. This makes brute-force password guessing far more difficult.\n\n  - For protocols that support human interaction, utilize captchas to hinder\nautomated access attempts.\n\n  - Change all default credentials and disable protocols that use weak authentication\n(e.g., clear-text passwords, or outdated and vulnerable authentication or\nencryption protocols) or do not support multi-factor authentication. Always\nconfigure access controls on cloud resources carefully to ensure that only wellmaintained and well-authenticated accounts have access[[5]].\n\n  - Employ appropriate network segmentation and restrictions to limit access and\nutilize additional attributes (such as device information, environment, access\npath) when making access decisions, with the desired state being a Zero Trust\nsecurity model[[6]].\n\n  - Use automated tools to audit access logs for security concerns and identify\nanomalous access requests.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Works cited\n\n[1] Norwegian Police Security Service (PST), “Datainnbruddet mot Stortinget er ferdig etterforsket,”\n\nDecember 8, 2020. https://www.pst.no/alle-artikler/pressemeldinger/datainnbruddet-motstortinget-er-ferdig-etterforsket/\n\n[2] Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), “STRONTIUM: Detecting new patterns in credential\n\nharvesting.” September 10, 2020. https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/09/10/strontiumdetecting-new-patters-credential-harvesting/\n\n[3] National Security Agency, “Detect and Prevent Web Shell Malware.” April 22, 2020.\n\nhttps://www.nsa.gov/cybersecurity-guidance\n\n[4] National Security Agency, “Selecting Secure Multi-factor Authentication Solutions.” October 16,\n\n2020. https://www.nsa.gov/cybersecurity-guidance\n\n[5] National Security Agency, “Mitigating Cloud Vulnerabilities.” January 22, 2020.\n\nhttps://www.nsa.gov/cybersecurity-guidance\n\n[6] National Security Agency, “Embracing a Zero Trust Security Model.” February 25, 2021.\n\nhttps://www.nsa.gov/cybersecurity-guidance\n\n**_Disclaimer of warranties and endorsement_**\n\nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or\nguarantees.
