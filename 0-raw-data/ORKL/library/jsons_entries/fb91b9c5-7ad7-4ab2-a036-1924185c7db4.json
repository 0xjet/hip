The advisory, identified](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-283a)\nas Alert AA20-283A, provides insight into advanced persistent threat (APT) actors’ activity\n[against networks associated with federal and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT)](https://www.dhs.gov/taxonomy/term/4517/all/feed)\ngovernments. The alert details how APT actors are using vulnerability chaining or exploit\nchaining, incorporating a recently disclosed elevation of privilege vulnerability in their attacks.\n\nThe following is a list of vulnerabilities referenced in the CISA/FBI joint cybersecurity alert:\n\n\n**CVE** **Vendor/Product** **CVSSv3**\n\n\n**Tenable**\n**VPR*** **Disclosed**\n\n\nCVE-201911510\n\nCVE-201813379\n\n\nPulse Connect Secure SSL\nVPN\n\n\n10.0 10.0 Apr 2019\n\n\nFortinet FortiOS SSL VPN 9.8 9.8 May 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n**CVE** **Vendor/Product** **CVSSv3**\n\n\n**Tenable**\n**VPR*** **Disclosed**\n\n\nCVE-201919781\n\n\nCitrix Netscaler 9.8 9.9 Dec 2019\n\n\n[CVE-2020-1631](http://tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-1631) Juniper Junos OS 9.8 6.7 Apr 2020\n\n[CVE-2020-2021](http://tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-2021) Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS 10.0 10.0 Jun 2020\n\n[CVE-2020-5902](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-5902) F5 BIG-IP 9.8 9.9 Jul 2020\n\n\nCVE-202015505\n\n\nMobileIron 9.8 9.5 Jul 2020\n\n\n[CVE-2020-1472](http://tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-1472) Microsoft Netlogon 10.0 10.0 Aug 2020\n\n*Please note Tenable VPR scores are calculated nightly. This blog post was published on\nOctober 12 and reflects VPR at that time.\n\n## Analysis\n\n**Initial access gained through SSL VPN vulnerability**\n\nAccording to the CISA/FBI alert, the APT actors are “predominantly” using CVE-2018-13379\nto gain initial access to target environments.\n\nCVE-2018-13379 is a path traversal vulnerability in Fortinet’s FortiOS Secure Socket Layer\n(SSL) virtual private network (VPN) solution. It was patched by Fortinet in April 2019.\nHowever, it wasn’t until after exploitation details were made public in August 2019 that\n[reports emerged of attackers exploiting it in the wild.](https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2018-13379-cve-2019-11510-fortigate-and-pulse-connect-secure-vulnerabilities-exploited-in)\n\nIn addition to the Fortinet vulnerability being used to gain initial access, CISA/FBI have also\nobserved “to a lesser extent,” APT actors using CVE-2020-15505, a remote code execution\nvulnerability in MobileIron’s Core and Connector.\n\n**Post exploitation elevation of privilege using Zerologon**\n\nOnce the APT actors have gained an initial foothold into their target environments, they are\nelevating privileges using CVE-2020-1472, a critical elevation of privilege vulnerability in\nMicrosoft’s Netlogon. Dubbed “Zerologon,” the vulnerability has gained notoriety after it was\n[initially patched in Microsoft’s August Patch Tuesday release.](https://www.tenable.com/blog/microsoft-s-august-2020-patch-tuesday-addresses-120-cves-cve-2020-1337)\n\nOn September 18, CISA [issued Emergency Directive 20-04 in an effort to ensure Federal](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/20-04/)\nCivilian Executive Branch systems were patched against the vulnerability.\n\n**Zerologon observed as part of attacks in the wild**\n\n\n-----\n\n[On September 23, Microsoft s Security Intelligence team tweeted that they had observed the](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1308941504707063808)\nZerologon exploits being “incorporated into attacker playbooks” as part of threat actor\nactivity.\n\nMicrosoft is actively tracking threat actor activity using exploits for the CVE-2020-1472\nNetlogon EoP vulnerability, dubbed Zerologon. We have observed attacks where public\nexploits have been incorporated into attacker playbooks.\n\n[— Microsoft Security Intelligence (@MsftSecIntel) September 24, 2020](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1308941504707063808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[In a follow-up tweet on October 6, Microsoft’s Security Intelligence team noted a new](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1313598440719355904)\ncampaign leveraging CVE-2020-1472 originating from a threat actor known as\n[CHIMBORAZO, also known as TA505, a financially motivated nation-state actor.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0092/)\n\nWe’re seeing more activity leveraging the CVE-2020-1472 exploit (ZeroLogon). A new\ncampaign shrewdly poses as software updates that connect to known CHIMBORAZO\n(TA505) C2 infrastructure. The fake updates lead to UAC bypass and use of\nwscript.exe to run malicious scripts.\n\n[— Microsoft Security Intelligence (@MsftSecIntel) October 6, 2020](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1313598440719355904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**CISA/FBI warn of additional vulnerabilities being targeted for initial access**\n\nIn addition to the Fortinet and MobileIron vulnerabilities identified in recent campaigns, the\nCISA/FBI alert also warns that these APT threat actors may also leverage one of the\nfollowing vulnerabilities to gain entry into their targeted networks:\n\n[CVE-2019-11510 is an arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability in Pulse Connect Secure](https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2019-11510-proof-of-concept-available-for-arbitrary-file-disclosure-in-pulse-connect-secure)\nSSL VPN\nCVE-2019-19781 is a path traversal vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery\nController (ADC), Citrix Gateway and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP appliances\nCVE-2020-1631 is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in Juniper’s Junos OS\nHTTP/HTTPS service\nCVE-2020-2021 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Security Assertion\nMarkup Language (SAML) authentication in PAN-OS when certain prerequisites are\nmet\nCVE-2020-5902 is a path traversal vulnerability in the traffic management user\ninterface (TMUI) in F5’s BIG-IP application delivery service.\n\n**Evergreen vulnerabilities remain popular amongst threat actors**\n\nMany of the vulnerabilities referenced in this joint alert from CISA/FBI have become\nevergreen flaws for threat actors. As part of CISA’s Top 10 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities\nalert, they reference both the Pulse Secure and Citrix ADC vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In September, CISA issued two separate alerts (AA20-258A,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-258a) [AA20-259A) that highlight how](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-259a)\n[APT actors from China and Iran are targeting unpatched vulnerabilities in Pulse Connect](https://www.tenable.com/blog/us-cybersecurity-agency-cisa-alert-foreign-threat-actors-target-unpatched-vulnerabilities)\nSecure, Citrix ADC, and F5’s BIG-IP.\n\n**Elections support systems accessed, yet elections data integrity intact**\n\nIn Alert AA20-283A, CISA mentions that they observed activity that “resulted in unauthorized\naccess to elections support systems.” However, they also mention that despite said\nunauthorized access, they have no evidence to support that the “integrity of elections data\nhas been compromised.”\n\n**Zerologon needs to be patched immediately**\n\nWith the latest alert from CISA and the FBI, coupled with reporting from other vendors, it\nseems clear that Zerologon is becoming one of the most critical vulnerabilities of 2020.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nA number of proofs-of-concept (PoC) and exploit scripts were made available soon after\nthese vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed.
