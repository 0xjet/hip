Otherwise,\nread on for a quick breakdown of what happened, how to detect it, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Recent SUPERNOVA Attack, Now with Masquerading\n\n[The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an analyst report (AR21-112A) on](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-112a)\nApril 22, 2021 that discussed a recent incident that they supported. As you read the first paragraph, it\nhits recent hot buttons: Pulse Secure and SolarWinds. Then you start wondering where is this going?\n\n“The threat actor connected to the entity’s network via a Pulse Secure virtual private network\n(VPN) appliance, moved laterally to its SolarWinds Orion server, installed malware referred to by\nsecurity researchers as SUPERNOVA (a .NET webshell), and collected credentials.”\n_—_ _[Analysis Report (AR21-112A)](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-112a)_\n\nAll of a sudden, we see SUPERNOVA and we breathe a sigh of relief; we’ve got this, in fact, we\n[blogged about this back in January 2021 in Detecting Supernova Malware Solarwinds Continued.](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/detecting-supernova-malware-solarwinds-continued.html)\nBut as we read farther, we come to find out that the adversary lovingly decided to take their copy of\n[procdump.exe — a command line tool that is used to create dumps of processes and has been used](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump)\nby various actors to dump credentials — renamed it Splunklogger.exe, and placed it on the\ncompromised SolarWinds server.\n\n**Great.**\n\nThis blog will highlight some new detections that were seen in this attack along with a discussion\naround masquerading. We will also provide some detections that you can take advantage of in your\nown environment. As mentioned before, we won’t go deep into SUPERNOVA itself as we already have\n[covered that in a previous blog, but these actions on objective are important to call out.](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/detecting-supernova-malware-solarwinds-continued.html)\n\n## What You Need to Know\n\n\n-----\n\nThis specific attack has a few interesting traits. The first is that the adversary is using residential IP\naddresses based in the United States (US) to make them appear as US-based employees and then\nleveraging valid accounts to gain access via the VPN.\n\nFrom there, the adversary used a virtual machine and obfuscated PowerShell scripts to move laterally\nto the SolarWinds server. At this point, the SUPERNOVA webshell is installed. Due to logs being\n[cleared during the attack, CISA was not able to determine if the adversary exploited CVE-2020-10148,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10148)\nan authentication bypass vulnerability of SolarWinds Orion or another method to gain access.\n\nAt this point, the adversary is\ncollecting credentials as well as\ndeploying tools to maintain\npersistence, evade defenses and\nother activities. A common tool\nthat certain adversaries use is\n[procdump.exe. Procdump.exe is](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump)\na Microsoft command line utility\nthat is used to monitor\napplications and can create crash\ndumps. Adversaries have been\nobserved using procdump to\ndump credentials. To obfuscate\nthe existence of procdump.exe\non the SolarWinds server, the\nadversary renamed their copy of\nprocdump.exe to\nsplunklogger.exe. This\nmasquerading technique is fairly\ncommon with certain utilities\nbecause the existence of that\nutility on certain systems may\ntrigger alarms for organizations,\nwhereas a tool like Splunk is used in many organizations and would raise less concern when seen.\n\nAfter credentials were dumped from LSASS memory, the adversary used the organization’s web\nserver to exfiltrate the credentials and then deleted the web server logs in an effort to cover their\ntracks.\n\nAdditional access occurred after the initial attack by leveraging credentials that were likely cracked\noffline from the initial credential dump. A final identified access event occurred where both\nprocdump.exe and winrar.exe were seen masquerading as wininit.exe and the adversary made an\nattempt to archive credentials, probably before they were exfiltrated.\n\n## Detecting Masquerading As Well as Indicators of the SUPERNOVA Attack in Splunk\n\n\n-----\n\nHere we will give you some hot-off-the-press searches to help find some of the badness derived from\nthe [CISA Analysis Report on this recent SUPERNOVA attack. If we have coverage for these searches](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-112a)\nin Splunk security content, we call them out further below in the MITRE ATT&CK section.\n\n[We covered some thoughts on detecting the SUPERNOVA webshell in our previous post on the](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/detecting-supernova-malware-solarwinds-continued.html)\nsubject as well as the associated vulnerabilities, so today we will focus on the activities that took place\nafter the webshell was established, specifically around masquerading and file integrity of the files\nmanipulated.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n[CISA published IOCs, including file names, hashes and IPs, in their blog post. So we collected the](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-112a)\ncommon hashes for procdump.exe, along with the IOCs that CISA identified and converted these\n[indicators into simple CSV format so that you may use them as lookup tables — they are posted](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Knowledge/Aboutlookupsandfieldactions) [here.](https://github.com/mnatkin-splunk/supernova-splunk-csvs)\nBut what’s a lookup table, and how does it help with security detection in Splunk? Got you covered\nthere, too.\n\n**Process Monitoring**\n\nWe frequently are asked \"why should we use Sysmon for process monitoring instead of native\nWindows capability via Event ID 4688?\" This situation is a perfect example as to why the rich data\ngathered by Sysmon is so valuable to defenders and threat hunters: hashes.\n\n[Microsoft's documentation for 4688 is available here. If we look in the example Event XML, we will only](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4688)\nsee information such as the NewProcessId or NewProcessName. If we've turned on CommandLine\ntracking, we'll be provided that information as well.\n\nComparatively, Sysmon [Event Code 1 has a number of other fields including multiple types of hashes,](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90001)\nthe Company, and even the parent process id to better contextualize the process that was created.\n\nIf we compare files being executed based on the name of the original file and the process, we can use\nSysmon data with a search like this to get a side by side comparison and use the match function with\nthe eval command to get a comparative.\n```\nEventCode=1 OriginalFileName=* process_name=*\n| eval OriginalFileName=upper(OriginalFileName) | eval process_name=upper(process_name)\n| eval match=if(OriginalFileName=process_name,\"Match\",\"No Match\")\n| search match=\"No Match\"\n| table _time host OriginalFileName process_name match\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see above, we can see that psexec.c is running under the name of smb.exe. It is important\nto note that without additional filtering, the search above is a bit noisy. However, for our purposes, we\ncould easily swap out the OriginalFileName value of * in this search to look for just procdump.exe or\nadd the string “splunklogger” like the search below.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother technique that we can use to identify masquerading is the use of file hashes. To do this, we\ncan again use a favored capability of Splunk, that is the lookup!\n\nWe mentioned them above, and just to make sure this blog is super long, let’s cover them in greater\ndetail. A very effective way of determining whether or not a process executing on one of your\nproduction servers is legit is to use lookups sourced with “known good” metadata about processes\nnormally found in your environment. Assuming you have tight control over upgrades that will change\nlegitimate binaries (e.g. a change control process/board), any executing binaries on your production\nservers that are “unknown” when compared to “known good” can be flagged.\n\n\n-----\n\nHere s one way of accomplishing that in Splunk. First, we leverage Sysmon s Event Code 1, which\nprovides hash values and a lot of other interesting process metadata, to harvest this data from a\nknown-good “golden image” server in the environment, and we pipe it to a lookup called\nUFKnownLookup.csv. Note, there’s all sorts of interesting metadata in these events, like the company\nname, the version number of the file, a description, and so forth:\n```\nindex=endpoint process_name=splunk* EventCode=1 host=frostbite\n| eval knowngood=1\n| stats values(process_name) as process_name values(Company) as vendor values(Description) as\ndescription values(FileVersion) as version values(knowngood) as known_good by SHA256,MD5\n| outputlookup UFKnownGood.csv\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nNow, we can leverage it in subsequent searches. For example, let s rip a page from the CISA\nSUPERNOVA report, take a copy of procdump.exe (which is a Sysinternals binary) and rename it\n“splunklogger.exe” and then put it on our desktop and run it. It will look like this in a Sysmon event.\n\nNow, let’s run a search to find Splunk binaries that are “unknown” to us, leveraging the lookup:\n```\nindex=endpoint process_name=splunk* EventCode=1 host=frostbite \n| lookup UFKnownGood.csv SHA256 OUTPUT known_good \n| eval known_good = case(known_good == 1, \"1\", 1=1, \"0\") \n| search known_good=0 \n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n| stats values(process_name) as process_name values(Company) as vendor values(Description) as\ndescription values(FileVersion) as version values(known_good) as known_good by SHA256,MD5\n\n```\nAnd voila! We can see that a binary called “splunklogger.exe” executed, but it wasn’t in our approved\nlookup list, and oh, by the way, even though it is called “splunklogger.exe” it certainly isn’t a real Splunk\nbinary, based on the Company and Description metadata.\n\nIn production, generating the lookup itself against raw data is a reasonable thing to do on an\noccasional basis. But for matching voluminous Sysmon data in Splunk, a tstats search against an\naccelerated data model from the Common Information Model is more optimal, like this one against\nEndpoint.Processes:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n| tstats summariesonly t prestats t count,values(Processes.process),values(host) as host from\ndatamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process=\"*splunk*.exe*\" AND\nProcesses.process!=\"*cmd.exe*\") by Processes.process_hash \n| rename Processes.process_hash as hashes \n| stats values(*) by hashes \n| rex field=hashes \"SHA256=(?<SHA256>.*),\" \n| lookup UFKnownGood.csv SHA256 \n| eval known_good = case(known_good == 1, \"1\", 1=1, \"0\") \n| search known_good=0\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Fee Fi Fo FIM\n\nWe also figured file integrity monitoring (FIM) was a super appropriate topic to cover since, ya know,\nprocdump.exe went all splunklogger.exe on us. The goal we’re trying to accomplish with FIM is simple:\ndetect unauthorized changes made to files, directories, network devices, OS and more. This can be\naccomplished by establishing a “baseline” for a file state, and monitoring for changes made to that\nstate. It’s a great way to quickly identify file discrepancies, modifications, and additions.\n\nNeed a FIM solution now? There are multiple software solutions that are designated for file integrity\n[monitoring like Tripwire and](https://www.tripwire.com/) [Qualys FIM.](https://www.qualys.com/apps/file-integrity-monitoring/)\n\n\n-----\n\nMore of an open source kind of person? Not a problem, there are several solutions available\ndepending on your requirements. Some of the more popular open source FIM solutions include\n[OSSEC and](https://www.ossec.net/) [osquery.](https://www.osquery.io/)\n\nGot none of that? You can always use “native” file activity monitoring, from things like Sysmon’s\n[FileCreate and FileDelete events, or even Windows 4663 events. All of the solutions we mention](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4663)\nintegrate well with Splunk, and many populate our Change data model for ease of use.\n\n## Splunk Enterprise Security and ESCU\n\n### Threat Intelligence Framework\n\n[If you are using Splunk Enterprise Security, the lookups of IOCs that are listed above can be ingested](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/enterprise-security.html)\neasily into the threat intelligence framework. Perhaps you aren’t sure how to do that. No worries, we\npublished some guidance and a how-to on integrating lists of IOC into the Enterprise Security threat\nintelligence framework.\n\n### Enterprise Security Content Updates (ESCU)\n\nFor folks using ESCU, our Threat Research team already has a number of detections around\nmasquerading. While they are not all in a single analytic story, they can be found by using the Keyword\nSearch. In fact, if you check out the MITRE ATT&CK table below, you can cut and paste those Splunk\nSearch titles into the Keyword Search (place * between the words in place of spaces) to view them in\nESCU. If you have ESCU running today, you already have some great coverage!\n\n\n-----\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\nReviewing the CISA Analysis Report (AR-21-112A), we mapped the adversary’s activity to MITRE\nATT&CK. Each tactic is then linked to Splunk content to help you hunt for that information. Be aware;\nthese searches are provided as a way to accelerate your hunting. We recommend you configure them\nvia the [Splunk Security Essentials App. You may need to modify them to work in your environment!](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/)\nMany of these searches are optimized for use with the tstats command.\n\nFinally, as more information becomes available, we will update these searches if more ATT&CK TTPs\nbecome known.\n\n\n-----\n\n**ATT&CK**\n**Technique**\n\n\n**Technique/**\n**Sub-Technique Title**\n\n\n**Splunk Searches**\n\n\nT1105 Ingress Tool Transfer [Suspicious Curl Network Connection](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/experimental/endpoint/suspicious_curl_network_connection.yml)\n\nT1036.003 Rename System Utilities [System Processes Run From Unexpected Locations](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/system_processes_run_from_unexpected_locations.yml)\n\nT1505.003 Web Shell [Detect Exchange Web Shell](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/detect_exchange_web_shell.yml)\n\n[W3WP Spawning Shell](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/w3wp_spawning_shell.yml)\n\n[Supernova Webshell](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/experimental/web/supernova_webshell.yml)\n\nT1078 Valid Accounts Reconnaissance of Access and Persistence\nOpportunities via PowerSploit modules\n\n[Setting Credentials via DSInternals modules](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/ssa___setting_credentials_via_dsinternals_modules.yml)\n\nProbing Access with Stolen Credentials via PowerSploit\nmodules\n\n[Setting Credentials via PowerSploit modules](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/ssa___setting_credentials_via_powersploit_modules.yml)\n\nReconnaissance of Credential Stores and Services via\nMimikatz modules\n\nReconnaissance and Access to Accounts and Groups\nvia Mimikatz modules\n\nReconnaissance of Privilege Escalation Opportunities\nvia PowerSploit modules\n\n[Applying Stolen Credentials via Mimikatz modules](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/ssa___applying_stolen_credentials_via_mimikatz_modules.yml)\n\n[Applying Stolen Credentials via PowerSploit modules](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/ssa___applying_stolen_credentials_via_powersploit_modules.yml)\n\n[Setting Credentials via Mimikatz modules](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/ssa___setting_credentials_via_mimikatz_modules.yml)\n\n\nT1047 Windows Management\nInstrumentation\n\nT1018 Remote System\nDiscovery\n\n\n[Script Execution via WMI](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/script_execution_via_wmi.yml)\n\n[Process Execution via WMI](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/process_execution_via_wmi.yml)\n\n[Remote Process Instantiation via WMI](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/remote_process_instantiation_via_wmi.yml)\n\nReconnaissance and Access to Operating System\nElements via PowerSploit modules\n\n[WMI Permanent Event Subscription](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/experimental/endpoint/wmi_permanent_event_subscription.yml)\n\n[WMI Temporary Event Subscription](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/experimental/endpoint/wmi_temporary_event_subscription.yml)\n\n[Windows AdFind Exe](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/experimental/endpoint/windows_adfind_exe.yml)\n\n\n-----\n\nT1070.001 Clear Windows Event\nLogs\n\nT1021.002 SMB/Windows Admin\nShares\n\n\n[Windows Event Log Cleared](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/windows_event_log_cleared.yml)\n\n[Suspicious wevtutil Usage](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/suspicious_wevtutil_usage.yml)\n\nReconnaissance of Connectivity via PowerSploit\nmodules\n\nReconnaissance and Access to Shared Resources via\nPowerSploit modules\n\nReconnaissance and Access to Shared Resources via\nMimikatz modules\n\n[Detect PsExec With accepteula Flag](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/endpoint/detect_psexec_with_accepteula_flag.yml)\n\n[SMB Traffic Spike](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/detections/experimental/network/smb_traffic_spike.yml)\n\n[SMB Traffic Spike -

We realize that attacks are continually occurring, but with the\nmasquerading of procdump.exe as splunklogger.exe as well as the use of the SUPERNOVA malware,\nwhich was so recent, it felt like a good time to talk about this specific attack. Masquerading and\nobfuscation are capabilities that many adversaries use during their attacks. Hopefully, these searches\nwill provide you the ability to have more visibility into your environment and any malicious activity that\nyou might be experiencing. If they don’t work perfectly, think of them as “SplunkSpiration” :-). Again,\nyou may have to modify them to work in your unique environment. If we uncover additional information,\nwe will update this blog.\n\n\n-----\n\nPosted by\n\n**[John Stoner](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/author/jstoner.html)**\n\nI grew up in Virginia, graduated from Penn State and came back to Virginia where I have worked with\ndatabases and cyber for over 20 years.
