Researchers previously had noted\nTrickBot connections with Conti.\n\n“In name, at least, this means that TrickBot’s four-year saga is now coming to a close — the\nliaison that has defined the cybercrime domain for years has been reborn into a newer,\npossibly even deadlier form,” Boguslavskiy wrote. “However, the people who have led\nTrickBot throughout its long run will not simply disappear. After being ‘acquired’ by Conti,\nthey are now rich in prospects with the secure ground beneath them, and Conti will always\nfind a way to make use of the available talent.”\n\nThe Conti group, meanwhile, put its support behind Russia on Friday, saying it would use its\nfull capabilities to strike back at any entity that threatens Russian critical infrastructure.\n\n“See you soon … or not” AdvIntel CEO [Vitali Kremez tweeted at Trickbot Thursday.](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1496944228135493638)\n\n### Busy, but in other ways\n\nTrickBot first drew attention as trojan malware aimed at the banking industry, but it soon\ndeveloped into a broader framework of tools for gaining access to sensitive networks in\ngeneral. Separate takedowns led by U.S. Cyber Command and Microsoft in late 2020, as\nwell as [prosecutions of TickBot leaders by U.S. law enforcement in 2021, put a significant](https://www.cyberscoop.com/latvia-trickbot-indictment-malware-witte/)\ndent in the gang’s operations.\n\nThe skills of TrickBot’s core group remain sharp, researchers say. A report earlier this month\n[from Check Point Research noted recent upgrades to some Trickbot modules. The](https://www.cyberscoop.com/trickbot-analysis-check-point-research/)\nBazarBackdoor tool, for example, has become a brand unto itself for cybercriminals who\nwant access to high-value targets, according to Intel471 and AdvIntel.\n\nAlexander Chailytko, Check Point’s cybersecurity research and innovation manager, told\nCyberScoop that there were some signs of successful requests of TrickBot command-andcontrol servers as recently as this week. Old infrastructure for the malware appeared to be\n“still maintained and operational” into 2022, Chailytko said, but has not been nearly as busy\nover the past two months.\n\n\n-----",
