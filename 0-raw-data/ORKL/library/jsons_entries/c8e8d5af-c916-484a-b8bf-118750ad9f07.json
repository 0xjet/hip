Using [ransomware data leak sites, Maze warned victims that they](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/)\nwould publicly leak stolen data if victims did not pay a ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\nOther gangs quickly adopted this extortion tactic.\n\nSome threat actors have told BleepingComputer that the practice of stealing data and\nthreatening to release it often generates more ransom payments than the loss of encrypted\nfiles.\n\nYou can see this shift in tactics with Babuk ransomware's recent announcement that they\n[would no longer encrypt devices and are moving solely to data-theft extortion.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-quits-ransomware-encryption-focuses-on-data-theft-extortion/)\n\n## The rise of stolen data marketplaces\n\nWith breaches happening almost every day, and governments issuing heavy fines for the\nexposure of personal information, threat actors are now capitalizing on these fears by using\ndedicated marketplaces that sell stolen data.\n\nWhile dark web marketplaces for illicit goods are not new and have been used to sell stolen\ndata in the past, they were not designed solely for data-theft extortion.\n\nRecently, BleepingComputer has identified two new marketplaces called Marketo and File\nLeaks created to sell data to other threat actors or back to the victim themselves. In\naddition, there is one marketplace called 'Dark Leak Market' that appears to have been\ncreated in 2019.\n\n### Dark Leak Market\n\nThe oldest of these marketplaces is Dark Leak Market who has been selling stolen data\nsince 2019.\n\nThe data sold at this site ranges from $100 to $9,000 and has been gathered from\nransomware gang's data leak sites and hacking forums, such as RaidForums.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Dark Leak Market**\nUsing KELA's DarkBeast intelligence platform, BleepingComputer found a post by REvil\nRansomware's Unknown confirming that the data is being resold from other data leaks.\n\n**Post by REvil Ransomware's Unknown calling the site a scam**\n\n### Marketo marketplace\n\nLast month, threat actors launched a new marketplace called Marketo, with the owner\ncontacting journalists and security researchers to promote the site\n\n\n-----\n\nWe would like to present the new marketplace Marketo, soon to be the best place to find,\nbuy and sell any information about any company,\" a threat actor behind Marketo emailed\nBleepingComputer.\n\n**Marketo leaked data marketplace**\nWhen we asked if this data was stolen as part of their own attacks or others, they stated, \"It\nis a marketplace for people who have information for sale, we don't hack companies.\"\n\nThey also claimed to be against ransomware and are not affiliated with \"those who block\nnetworks and extort funds.\"\n\nWhile most of the data found on the site does not appear to be associated with known\nransomware attacks, that does not mean they are not hosting data from those types of\nattacks.\n\nBleepingComputer was recently alerted by someone in the automotive cybersecurity\nindustry who saw data on Marketo for a dealership known to have recently suffered from a\nransomware attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n### File Leaks marketplace\n\nThe File Leaks marketplace was launched in April 2021 and dumps all of the stolen data at\nonce, telling victims to contact them to pay to remove it.\n\nThe File leaks marketplace is the smallest of the sites, with two victims from Italy and one\nfrom India.\n\n**File Leaks marketplace**\n\n## Paying the ransom is throwing money away\n\nAs we [reported in November, victims should never pay a ransom for stolen data as there is](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scam-psa-ransomware-gangs-dont-always-delete-stolen-data-when-paid/)\nno guarantee that their data will be deleted and not sold to other threat actors.\n\nRansomware negotiation firm Coveware told BleepingComputer that cybercriminals are\nincreasingly failing to keep their promises after a ransom was paid.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn some cases, victims who paid were later extorted again using the same data, or the\nthreat actors leaked the data anyway.\n\nFurthermore, as shown by the Dark Leak Market, once data is leaked, there is no way to\ncontain it as it spreads between different hacking forums and sites frequented by threat\nactors.\n\nWith this in mind, Coveware tells victims always to expect the following if they decide to pay\na ransomware gang not to leak data:\n\nThe data will not be credibly deleted. Victims should assume it will be traded to other\nthreat actors, sold, or held for a second/future extortion attempt\n\nStolen data custody was held by multiple parties and not secured. Even if the threat\nactor deletes a volume of data following a payment, other parties that had access to it\nmay have made copies so that they can extort the victim in the future\n\nThe data may get posted by mistake or on purpose before a victim can even respond\nto an extortion attempt\n\nInstead, data theft victims should always treat an attack as a data breach and properly\ndisclose the breach to all customers, employees, and business partners to prevent them\nfrom being harmed by the stolen data.\n\n**_Update 5/7/21 11:14 AM EST: We incorrectly stated Lorenz is a data leak marketplace,_**\n_[when in fact it is a ransomware group's data leak site.
