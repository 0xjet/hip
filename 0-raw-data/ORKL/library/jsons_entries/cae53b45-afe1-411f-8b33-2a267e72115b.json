    "plain_text": "# You never walk alone: The SideWalk backdoor gets a Linux variant\n\n**[welivesecurity.com/2022/09/14/you-never-walk-alone-sidewalk-backdoor-linux-variant/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/09/14/you-never-walk-alone-sidewalk-backdoor-linux-variant/)**\n\nSeptember 14, 2022\n\nESET researchers have uncovered another tool in the already extensive arsenal of the SparklingGoblin APT\ngroup: a Linux variant of the SideWalk backdoor\n\nESET researchers have discovered a Linux variant of the SideWalk backdoor, one of the multiple custom\nimplants used by the SparklingGoblin APT group. This variant was deployed against a Hong Kong university in\nFebruary 2021, the same university that had already been targeted by SparklingGoblin during the student\nprotests in May 2020. We originally named this backdoor StageClient, but now refer to it simply as SideWalk\nLinux. We also discovered that a previously known Linux backdoor – the Specter RAT, first [documented by 360](https://blog.netlab.360.com/ghost-in-action-the-specter-botnet/)\nNetlab – is also actually a SideWalk Linux variant, having multiple commonalities with the samples we identified.\n\nSparklingGoblin is an APT group whose tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) partially overlap with APT41\nand BARIUM. It makes use of Motnug and ChaCha20-based loaders, the CROSSWALK and SideWalk\nbackdoors, along with Korplug (aka PlugX) and Cobalt Strike. While the group targets mostly East and Southeast\nAsia, we have also seen SparklingGoblin targeting a broad range of organizations and verticals around the\nworld, with a particular focus on the academic sector. SparklingGoblin is one of the groups with access to the\nShadowPad backdoor.\n\nThis blogpost documents SideWalk Linux, its victimology, and its numerous similarities with the originally\ndiscovered SideWalk backdoor.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe SideWalk backdoor is exclusive to SparklingGoblin. In addition to the multiple code similarities between the\nLinux variants of SideWalk and various SparklingGoblin tools, one of the SideWalk Linux samples uses a C&C\naddress (66.42.103[.]222) that was [previously used by SparklingGoblin.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/higaisa-or-winnti-apt-41-backdoors-old-and-new/)\n\n\n-----\n\nConsidering all of these factors, we attribute with high confidence SideWalk Linux to the SparklingGoblin APT\ngroup.\n\n## Victimology\n\nEven though there are various SideWalk Linux samples, as we now know them, on VirusTotal, in our telemetry\nwe have found only one victim compromised with this SideWalk variant: a Hong Kong university that, amidst\n[student protests, had previously been targeted by both SparklingGoblin (using the Motnug loader and the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/29/eset-threat-report-q22020/)\n[CROSSWALK backdoor) and Fishmonger (using the ShadowPad and Spyder backdoors). Note that at that time](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/)\nwe put those two different clusters of activity under the broader Winnti Group denomination.\n\nSparklingGoblin first compromised this particular university in May 2020, and we first detected the Linux variant\nof SideWalk in that university’s network in February 2021. The group continuously targeted this organization over\na long period of time, successfully compromising multiple key servers, including a print server, an email server,\nand a server used to manage student schedules and course registrations.\n\n## The road to Sidewalk Linux\n\n[SideWalk, which we first described in its Windows form in our blogpost on August 24, 2021, is a multipurposeth](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/24/sidewalk-may-be-as-dangerous-as-crosswalk/)\nbackdoor that can load additional modules sent from the C&C server. It makes use of Google Docs as a deaddrop resolver, and Cloudflare workers as its C&C server. It can properly handle communication behind a proxy.\n\nThe compromise chain is currently unknown, but we think that the initial attack vector could have been\nexploitation. This hypothesis is based on the 360 Netlab article describing the Specter botnet targeting IP\ncameras, and NVR and DVR devices, and the fact that the Hong Kong victim used a vulnerable WordPress\nserver, since there were many attempts to install various webshells.\n\n[We first documented the Linux variant of SideWalk as StageClient on July 2nd, 2021, without making the](https://twitter.com/esetresearch/status/1410864752948043778)\nconnection at that time to SparklingGoblin and its custom SideWalk backdoor. The original name was used\nbecause of the repeated appearances of the string StageClient in the code.\n\n[While researching StageClient further, we found a blogpost about the Specter botnet described by 360 Netlab.](https://blog.netlab.360.com/ghost-in-action-the-specter-botnet/)\nThat blogpost describes a modular Linux backdoor with flexible configuration that uses a ChaCha20 encryption\nvariant – basically a subset of StageClient’s functionality. Further inspection confirmed this hypothesis; we\nadditionally found a huge overlap in functionality, infrastructure, and symbols present in all the binaries.\n\nWe compared the StageClient sample E5E6E100876E652189E7D25FFCF06DE959093433 with Specter\nsamples 7DF0BE2774B17F672B96860D013A933E97862E6C and found numerous similarities, some of which\nwe list below.\n\nFirst, there is an overlap in C&C commands. Next, the samples have the same structure of configuration and\nencryption method (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. StageClient’s configuration with modified symbols_\n\n_Figure 2. Specter’s configuration with modified symbols_\n\nAdditionally, the samples’ modules are managed in almost the same way, and the majority of the interfaces are\nidentical; modules of StageClient only need to implement one additional handler, which is for closing the module.\nThree out of the five known modules are almost identical.\n\n\n-----\n\nLastly, we could see striking overlaps in the network protocols of the compared samples. A variant of ChaCha20\nis used twice for encryption with LZ4 compression in the very same way. Both StageClient and Specter create a\nnumber of threads (see Figure 3 and Figure 4) to manage sending and receiving asynchronous messages along\nwith heartbeats.\n\n_Figure 3. A part of StageClient’s StageClient::StartNetwork function_\n\n_Figure 4. A part of Specter’s StartNetwork function_\n\nDespite all these striking similarities, there are several changes. The most notable ones are the following:\n\nThe authors switched from the C language to C++. The reason is unknown, but it should be easier to\nimplement such modular architecture in C++ due to its polymorphism support.\nAn option to exchange messages over HTTP was added (see Figure 5 and Figure 6).\n\n_Figure 5. Sending a message in StageClient_\n\n_Figure 6. Sending a message in Specter_\n\n\n-----\n\nDownloadable plugins were replaced with precompiled modules that fulfill the same purpose; a number of\nnew commands and two new modules were added.\nAdded the module TaskSchedulerMod, which operates as a built-in cron utility. Its cron table is stored in\nmemory; the jobs are received over the network and executed as shell commands.\nAdded the module SysInfoMgr, which provides information about the underlying system such as the list of\ninstalled packages and hardware details.\n\nThese similarities convince us that Specter and StageClient are from the same malware family. However,\nconsidering the numerous code overlaps between the StageClient variant used against the Hong Kong university\nin February 2021 and SideWalk for Windows, as described in the next section, we now believe that Specter and\nStageClient are both Linux variants of SideWalk, so we have decided to refer to them as SideWalk Linux.\n\n### Similarities with the Windows variant\n\nSideWalk Windows and SideWalk Linux share too many similarities to describe within the confines of this\nblogpost, so here we only cover the most striking ones.\n\n**ChaCha20**\n\nAn obvious similarity is noticeable in the implementations of ChaCha20 encryption: both variants use a counter\nwith an initial value of 0x0B, which was previously mentioned in our blogpost as a specificity of SideWalk’s\nChaCha20 implementation.\n\n**Software architecture**\n\nOne SideWalk particularity is the use of multiple threads to execute one specific task. We noticed that in both\nvariants there are exactly five threads executed simultaneously, each of them having a specific task. The\nfollowing list describes the function of each; the thread names are from the code:\n\nStageClient::ThreadNetworkReverse\n\nIf a connection to the C&C server is not already established, this thread periodically attempts to retrieve the\nlocal proxy configuration and the C&C server location from the dead-drop resolver. If the previous step was\nsuccessful, it attempts to initiate a connection to the C&C server.\nStageClient::ThreadHeartDetect\n\nIf the backdoor did not receive a command in the specified amount of time, this thread can terminate the\nconnection with the C&C server or switch to a “nap” mode that introduces minor changes to the behavior.\nStageClient::ThreadPollingDriven\n\nIf there is no other queued data to send, this thread periodically sends a heartbeat command to the C&C\nserver that can additionally contain the current time.\nStageClient::ThreadBizMsgSend\n\nThis thread periodically checks whether there is data to be sent in the message queues used by all the\nother threads and, if so, processes it.\nStageClient::ThreadBizMsgHandler\n\nThis thread periodically checks whether there are any pending messages received from the C&C server\nand, if so, handles them.\n\n**Configuration**\n\nAs in SideWalk Windows, the configuration is decrypted using ChaCha20.\n\n**_Checksum_**\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, before decrypting, there is a data integrity check. This check is similar in both implementations of SideWalk\n(see Figure 7 and Figure 8): an MD5 hash is computed on the ChaCha20 nonce concatenated to the encrypted\nconfiguration data. This hash is then checked against a predefined value, and if not equal, SideWalk exits.\n\n_Figure 7. SideWalk Linux: Configuration integrity check_\n\n_Figure 8. SideWalk Windows: Configuration integrity check_\n\n**_Layout_**\n\nFigure 9 presents excerpts of decrypted configurations from the samples that we analyzed.\n\n_Figure 9. Configuration parts from E5E6E100876E652189E7D25FFCF06DE959093433 (left) and_\n\nFA6A40D3FC5CD4D975A01E298179A0B36AA02D4E (right)\n\nThe SideWalk Linux config contains less information than the SideWalk Windows one. This makes sense\nbecause the majority of the configuration artifacts in SideWalk Windows are used as cryptography and network\nparameters, whereas most of these are internal in SideWalk Linux.\n\n**_Decryption using ChaCha20_**\n\nAs previously mentioned, SideWalk uses a main global structure to store its configuration. This configuration is\nfirst decrypted using the modified implementation of ChaCha20, as seen in Figure 10.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. ChaCha20 decryption call in SideWalk Windows (left) and in SideWalk Linux (right)_\n\nNote that the ChaCha20 key is exactly the same in both variants, strengthening the connection between the two.\n\n**Dead-drop resolver**\n\nThe dead-drop resolver payload is identical in both samples. As a reminder from our blogpost on SideWalk,\nFigure 11 depicts the format of the payload that is fetched from the dead-drop resolver.\n\n_Figure 11. Format of the string hosted in the Google Docs document_\n\nFor the first delimiter, we notice that the PublicKey: part of the string is ignored; the string AE68[…]3EFF is\ndirectly searched, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n_Figure 12. SideWalk Linux’s first delimiter routine (left), end delimiter and middle delimiter routines (right)_\n\nThe delimiters are identical, as well as the whole decoding algorithm.\n\n**Victim fingerprinting**\n\nIn order to fingerprint the victim, different artifacts are gathered on the victim’s machine. We noticed that the\nfetched information is exactly the same, to the extent of it even being fetched in the same order.\n\nAs the boot time in either case is a Windows-compliant time format, we can hypothesize that the operators’\ncontroller runs under Windows, and that the controller is the same for both Linux and Windows victims. Another\nargument supporting this hypothesis is that the ChaCha20 keys used in both implementations of SideWalk are\nthe same.\n\n**Communication protocol**\n\n**_Data serialization_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe communication protocol between the infected machine and the C&C is HTTP or HTTPS, depending on the\nconfiguration, but in both cases, the data is serialized in the same manner. Not only is the implementation very\nsimilar, but the identical encryption key is used in both implementations, which, again, accentuates the similarity\nbetween the two variants.\n\n**_POST requests_**\n\nIn the POST requests used by SideWalk to fetch commands and payloads from the C&C server, one noticeable\npoint is the use of the two parameters gtsid and gtuvid, as seen in Figure 13. Identical parameters are used in\nthe Linux variant.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\nPOST /M26RcKtVr5WniDVZ/5CDpKo5zmAYbTmFl HTTP/1.1\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nConnection: close\n\nPragma: no-cache\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/72.0.3626.109 Safari/537.36\n\ngtsid: zn3isN2C6bWsqYvO\n\ngtuvid: 7651E459979F931D39EDC12D68384C21249A8DE265F3A925F6E289A2467BC47D\n\nContent-Length: 120\n\nHost: update.facebookint.workers[.]dev\n\n\n_Figure 13. Example of a POST request used by SideWalk Windows_\n\nAnother interesting point is that the Windows variant runs as fully position-independent shellcode, whereas the\nLinux variant is a shared library. However, we think the malware’s authors could have just taken an extra step,\n[using a tool such as sRDI to convert a compiled SideWalk PE to shellcode instead of manually writing the](https://github.com/monoxgas/sRDI)\nshellcode.\n\n**Commands**\n\nOnly four commands are not implemented or implemented differently in the Linux variant, as listed in Table 1. All\nthe other commands are present – even with the same IDs.\n\n_Table 1. Commands with different or missing implementation in the Linux version of SideWalk_\n\n**Command**\n**ID (from**\n**C&C)** **Windows variants** **Linux variants**\n\n0x7C Load a plugin sent by the C&C server. Not implemented in SideWalk Linux.\n\n\n0x82 Collect domain information about running processes, and\nowners (owner SID, account name, process name,\ndomain information).\n\n\nDo nothing.\n\n\n0x8C Data serialization function. Commands that are not handled, but\nfall in the default case, which is\nbroadcasting a message to all the\nloaded modules.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command**\n**ID (from**\n**C&C)** **Windows variants** **Linux variants**\n\n0x8E Write the received data to the file located at\n%AllUsersProfile%\\UTXP\\nat\\<filename>, where\n<filename> is a hash of the value returned by VirtualAlloc\nat each execution of the malware.\n\n**Versioning**\n\nIn the Linux variant, we observed a specificity that was not found in the Windows variant: a version number is\ncomputed (see Figure 14).\n\n_Figure 14. Versioning function in SideWalk Linux_\n\nThe hardcoded date could be the beginning or end of development of this version of SideWalk Linux. The final\ncomputation is made out of the year, day, and month, from the value Oct 26 2020. In this case, the result is\n1171798691840.\n\n**Plugins**\n\nIn SideWalk Linux variants, modules are built in; they cannot be fetched from the C&C server. That is a notable\ndifference from the Windows variant. Some of those built-in functionalities, like gathering system information\n(SysInfoMgr, for example) such as network configuration, are done directly by dedicated functions in the\nWindows variant. In the Windows variant, some plugins can be added through C&C communication.\n\n**Defense evasion**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Windows variant of SideWalk goes to great lengths to conceal the objectives of its code. It trimmed out all\ndata and code that was unnecessary for its execution and encrypted the rest. On the other hand, the Linux\nvariants contain symbols and leave some unique authentication keys and other artifacts unencrypted, which\nmakes the detection and analysis significantly easier.\n\nAdditionally, the much higher number of inlined functions in the Windows variant suggests that its code was\ncompiled with a higher level of compiler optimizations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe backdoor that was used to attack a Hong Kong university in February 2021 is the same malware family as\nthe SideWalk backdoor, and actually is a Linux variant of the backdoor. This Linux version exhibits several\nsimilarities with its Windows counterpart along with various novelties.\n\n_For any inquiries about our research published on WeLiveSecurity, please contact us at_ _[threatintel@eset.com.](mailto:threatintel@eset.com)_\n_ESET Research now also offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.
