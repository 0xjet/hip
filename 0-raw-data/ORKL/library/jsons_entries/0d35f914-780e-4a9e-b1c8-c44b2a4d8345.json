    "plain_text": "### TRUSTWAVE SPIDERLABS FACT SHEET\n\n# New Vulnerabilities Discovered in\n SolarWinds Products by Trustwave SpiderLabs\n\n\n## What Trustwave SpiderLabs Found\n\n- Two security vulnerabilities in SolarWinds Orion Platform\n\n(CVE-2021-25274 and CVE-2021-25275) and one vulnerability\nin SolarWinds Serv-U FTP for Windows (CVE-2021-25276).\n\n- All three vulnerabilities are severe bugs, with the most critical\n\none in SolarWinds Orion Platform (CVE-2021-25274) allowing\nremote code execution with high privileges.\n\n- To the best of Trustwave’s knowledge, none of these identified\n\nvulnerabilities were exploited in the recent SolarWinds attacks\nor in any attacks “in the wild”.\n\n- Trustwave reported all three findings to SolarWinds and\n\npatches were released in a very timely manner.\n\n- [Full details can be found in our vulnerability blog post.](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/full-system-control-with-new-solarwinds-orion-based-and-serv-u-ftp-vulnerabilities/)\n\n## Why It’s Important\n\n- SolarWinds Orion Platform (CVE-2021-25275): SolarWinds\n\ncredentials are stored in an insecure manner that could allow\nany local users, despite privileges, to take complete control\nover the SOLARWINDS_ORION database. From here, one can\nsteal information or add a new admin-level user to be used\ninside SolarWinds Orion products.\n\n- SolarWinds Orion Platform (CVE-2021-25274): Improper use of\n\nMicrosoft Messaging Queue (MSMQ) could allow any remote\nunprivileged user the ability to execute any arbitrary code in\nthe highest privilege.\n\n- SolarWinds Serv-U FTP for Windows (CVE-2021-25276):\n\nAny local user, regardless of privilege, can create a file that can\ndefine a new Serv-U FTP admin account with full access to the\nC:\\ drive. This account can then be used to log in via FTP and\nread or replace any file on the drive.\n\n\n## Immediate Recommended Protections\n\n- Trustwave recommends all SolarWinds Orion Platform and\n\nServ-U FTP users immediately patch. Fixes are available in the\nfollowing versions of SolarWinds products:\n\n› [Orion Platform 2020.2.4](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/content/release_notes/orion_platform_2020-2-4_release_notes.htm)\n\n› [Download ServU-FTP 15.2.2 Hotfix 1 Patch Now (.zip file)](https://downloads.solarwinds.com/solarwinds/Release/HotFix/Serv-U-15.2.2-Hotfix-1.zip)\n\n## Planned Future Updates from\n Trustwave SpiderLabs\n\n- We have purposely left out specific Proof of Concept (PoC)\n\ncode in the full blog post in order to give SolarWinds users\nlonger to patch. A blog update with PoC code will go live on\nFeb. 9.\n\n- PoC code helps information security professionals better\n\nunderstand these issues and can help them develop\nprotections or test for vulnerable systems in ways specific to\ntheir environment.\n\n## Trustwave Product Protections\n\n- Trustwave vulnerability scanning products can detect these\n\nvulnerabilities and Trustwave IDS/IPS products include\nsignatures that can detect network exploitation of\nCVE-2021-25274.\n\n\n-----",
