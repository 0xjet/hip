When visited, their landing pages will also automatically\ndownload a zip file containing the Ficker malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fake Spotify landing page**\nOnce a user unzips the file and launches the executable, instead of being greeted by a new\nonline Chess application or the Spotify software, the Ficker malware will run and begin\nstealing the data stored on their computer.\n\n## What is the Ficker malware\n\nFicker is an information-stealing Trojan released on Russian-speaking hacker forums in\nJanuary when the developer began renting out the malware to other threat actors.\n\nIn a forum post, the developer describes the malware's capabilities and allows other threat\nactors to rent the software from anyone from one week up to six months.\n\n\n-----\n\n**A forum post marketing the FickerStealer malware**\nUsing this malware, threat actors can steal saved credentials in web browsers, desktop\nmessaging clients (Pidgin, Steam, Discord), and FTP clients.\n\nIn addition to stealing passwords, the developer claims the malware can steal over fifteen\ncryptocurrency wallets, steal documents, and take screenshots of the active applications\nrunning on victims' computers.\n\nThis information is then compiled into a zip file and transmitted back to the attacker, where\nthey can then extract the data and use it for other malicious activities.\n\nDue to the Ficker malware's extensive functionality, victims of this campaign should\nimmediately change their online passwords, check firewalls for suspicious port forwarding\nrules, and perform a thorough antivirus scan of your computer to check for additional\nmalware.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[New powerful Prynt Stealer malware sells for just $100 per month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-powerful-prynt-stealer-malware-sells-for-just-100-per-month/)\n\n[New ZingoStealer infostealer drops more malware, cryptominers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-zingostealer-infostealer-drops-more-malware-cryptominers/)\n\n[New ChromeLoader malware surge threatens browsers worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-chromeloader-malware-surge-threatens-browsers-worldwide/)\n\n[Fake Binance NFT Mystery Box bots steal victim's crypto wallets](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-binance-nft-mystery-box-bots-steal-victims-crypto-wallets/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
