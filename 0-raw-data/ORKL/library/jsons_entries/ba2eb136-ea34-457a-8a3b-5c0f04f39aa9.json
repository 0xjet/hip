C# Ransomware for educational purposes\nonly\n\n## About\n\nRansomware is a type of malware that prevents or limits users from accessing their files in\ntheir sysem. It locks the user's files until the ransom is paid, in this case, a Discord nitro\nsubscription. If a user wants to unlock their files, a decryption key is needed. The\nransomware asks for the ransom in exchange for the decryption key.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis Ransomware should not be used to harm/threat/hurt others. Its purpose is only to share\nknowledge and awareness about Malware/Cryptography/Operating Systems/Programming.\nNitroRansomware is an academic ransomware made for learning and spreading awareness\nabout how security/cryptography can be used maliciously.\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen the .exe file is run, it encrypts the user's Documents, Desktop, and Pictures folder. It\nthen recursively checks for any nested folders in the folders, and encrypts all of its contents.\nIn order to decrypt the files the user has to paste a valid Discord nitro gift subscription and\n\n\n-----\n\nsubmit it. The program checks if it is valid, and if it is, it is sent to your webhook. The user\nreceives the decryption key which allows them to decrypt the encrypted files. If it is not, the\ndecrypion key will not be sent, and the user wil not be able to open their files.\n\nThis program should only be used for educational purposes only. Do not use this on others\nmaliciously.\n\n## Preview\n\nWebhook Preview\n\nRansomware\n\n\n-----\n\n## Features\n\nAES Encryption/ Decryption\nAdds to startup registry\nGrabs user's PC username, name, and uuid\nDiscord Nitro Checker\nToken Grabber\nIP Grabber\nDiscord Webhook Logs\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Make sure you have Visual Studio 2019 with C# installed. (.NET Desktop\n\nDevelopment)\n2. Open `NitroRansomware.sln, then open` `Program.cs .`\n3. Pase your webhook link next to `WEBHOOK .`\n4. You can change the decryption key too, if you want. `DECRYPT_PASSWORD`\n5. Click on release, then build the solution. Do NOT run it, because it is malware and may\n\nencrypt your files.\n6. You can now test it in a protected environment such as a virtual machine.\n\n\n-----",
