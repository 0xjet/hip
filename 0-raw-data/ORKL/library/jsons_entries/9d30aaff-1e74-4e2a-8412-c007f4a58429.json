    "plain_text": "# Last Dash for Joker’s Stash: Carding forum may close in 30 days\n\n**intel471.com/blog/jokers-stash-closed-february-2021**\n\nJan 15, 2021\n\nOne of the most notable carding shops may be shutting down for good.\n\nThe Joker’s Stash shop will be closing operations on Feb. 15, 2021, according to the site’s\nowner. In a message board post on a popular Russian-language cybercrime forum, the\noperator said the site is closing “forever” and its team is heading into a “well-deserved\nretirement.”\n\n“When we opened years ago, nobody knew us. Today we are one of the largest cards/dumps\nmarketplace,” the post reads. “Unfortunately, or fortunately - nothing lasts forever. It’s time\nfor us to leave forever.”\n\nThe announcement comes weeks after the U.S. Department of Justice and INTERPOL\n[allegedly seized proxy servers used in connection with the blockchain-based domains](https://intel471.com/blog/jokers-stash-fbi-interpol-dns-takedown-temporary/)\nbelonging to Joker’s Stash. Shortly after the action, the site’s operators took to several\nunderground forums to stress that the shop would go back to normal after access was\nrestored.\n\nJoker’s Stash's fall comes after a very turbulent close to 2020. In October, the actor who\nallegedly runs the site announced he had contracted COVID-19, spending a week in the\nhospital. The condition impacted the site’s forums, inventory replenishments and other\noperations. Intel 471 also observed the site’s clients complaining that the shop’s payment\ncard data quality was increasingly poor.\n\nIn the post, the operator said he plans to keep the site open for 30 days so users can spend\ntheir account balance. Any partners would be paid out before the site shuts down.\n\nThe post also stresses that the site’s servers and backups will be wiped after February 15.\n\n\"We are also want to wish all young and mature ones cyber-gangsters not to lose themselves\nin the pursuit of easy money,” the post reads. “Remember, that even all the money in the\nworld will never make you happy and that all the most truly valuable things in this life are\nfree.”\n\n\n-----",
