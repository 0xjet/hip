This is likely one of many third parties Transparent Tribe employs to\nprepare, stage and/or deploy components of their operation.\n\n## Overview\n\nCisco Talos recently discovered an ongoing campaign conducted by the Transparent Tribe\nAPT group against students at various educational institutions in India. This campaign was\n[partially covered by another security firm, but our findings reveal more details regarding the](https://labs.k7computing.com/index.php/transparent-tribe-targets-educational-institution/)\nadversary's operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nTypically, this APT group focuses on targeting government (government employees, military\npersonnel) and pseudo-government entities (think tanks, conferences, etc.) using remote\naccess trojans (RATs) such as CrimsonRAT and ObliqueRAT. However, in this new campaign\ndating back to December 2021, the adversary is targeting students of universities and\ncolleges in India. This new campaign also suggests that the APT is actively expanding its\nnetwork of victims to include civilian users.\n\nWe also assess with high confidence that a Pakistani web hosting services provider,\n\"ZainHosting\" was employed by the APT for deploying and operating parts of Transparent\nTribe's infrastructure used in this campaign.\n\n## Threat actor profile\n\nTransparent Tribe is a suspected Pakistan-linked threat actor. This group typically targets\nindividuals and entities associated with governments and military personnel in the Indian\nsubcontinent, specifically Afghanistan and India. Transparent Tribe has also been known to\n[use their CrimsonRAT implant against human rights activists in Pakistan.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa33/8366/2018/en/)\n\nThe group primarily uses three Windows-based malware families to carry out espionage\nactivities against their targets.\n\nCrimsonRAT is a .NET-based implant that is the group's malware of choice since at\n[least 2020. Transparent Tribe's multiple campaigns leveraging CrimsonRAT over the](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.crimson)\nyears indicate a steady evolution in the implant's capabilities.\n[ObliqueRAT is a C/C++-based implant discovered by Talos in early 2020. ObliqueRAT](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/02/obliquerat-hits-victims-via-maldocs.html)\nis primarily reserved for hyper-targeted attacks on government personnel and in\noperations where stealth is a prime focus of the attackers' infection chain. This implant\n[has also seen a constant evolution in deployment tactics and malicious functionalities](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/obliquerat-new-campaign.html)\nover time.\nCustom malware used by Transparent Tribe consists of easily and quickly deployable\ndownloaders, droppers and lightweight RATs containing limited capabilities as opposed\nto CrimsonRAT and ObliqueRAT.\n\nTransparent Tribe also maintains a suite of mobile implants in their arsenal. Implants such as\n[CapraRAT are constantly modified to be deployed against targets. These implants contain a](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/a/investigating-apt36-or-earth-karkaddans-attack-chain-and-malware.html)\nplethora of malicious capabilities meant to steal data from mobile devices.\n\n## Attack details: Infection chain\n\nThe attack consists of a maldoc delivered to the target as an attachment or a link to a remote\nlocation via a spear-phishing email. The maldocs consist of malicious VBA macros\n\n\n-----\n\ncommonly observed in previous Transparent Tribe campaigns. The macros extract an\nembedded archive file from the maldoc and unzip it to execute a copy of the malware in the\n[archive file. The malware in the archive files is CrimsonRAT.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.crimson)\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious macro dropping embedded zip to disk.\n\n### CrimsonRAT\n\nThe CrimsonRAT payloads deployed in this campaign are very similar to those from past\nTransparent Tribe campaigns. It is the staple implant of choice for Transparent Tribe to\nestablish long-term access into victim networks. This RAT is actively updated, adding new\ncapabilities and obfuscating the implant.\n\nThe latest version of CrimsonRAT seen in this campaign contains a number of capabilities,\nincluding:\n\nList files and folders in a directory path specified by the command and control (C2).\nRun specific processes on the endpoint, such as keylogger and USB modules.\nList process IDs and names running on the endpoint.\nGet information, such as name, creation times and size of image files (pictures such as\nBMP, JPG, etc.) specified by the C2.\nTake screenshots of the current screen and send them to the C2.\nUpload keylogger logs from a file on disk to the C2.\nSend system information to the C2, including:\n\nComputer name, username, operating system name, the file path of implant and\nparent folder path.\nIndicator of whether the keylogger module is in the endpoint and running and its\nversion.\nIndicator of whether the USB module is in the endpoint and running and its\nversion.\n\nRun arbitrary commands on the system.\nWrite data sent by the C2 to a file on disk.\nRead contents of a file on disk and exfiltrate to the C2.\nList all drives on the system.\nList all files in a directory.\nDownload the USB worm and keylogger modules from the C2 and write them to disk.\nSend a file's name, creation time and size to the C2- file path as specified by the C2.\nDelete files specified by the C2 from the endpoint.\nGet names, creation times and size of all files containing the file extension specified by\nthe C2.\n\n## Infrastructure and attribution\n\n\n-----\n\n### Campaign Infrastructure\n\nA number of these maldocs and archives containing these maldocs were hosted on the\ndomains registered by the attackers, with the earliest domain registered in June 2021. These\ndomains were named so that they would appear relevant to students and educational entities\nin India. Some examples of domains registered by the threat actor are:\n\nstudentsportal[.]live\nstudentsportal[.]website\nstudentsportal[.]co\n\nHowever, we've also discovered the use of additional media-themed domains that the\nattackers are preparing to use in parallel campaigns against their targets. These domains are\nin line with Transparent Tribe's tactic of using malicious file-sharing domains we've observed\nin [previous attacks and campaigns.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/transparent-tribe-infra-and-targeting.html)\n\ncloud-drive[.]store\nuser-onedrive[.]live\ndrive-phone[.]online\n\nDuring the course of our research, we discovered SSL certificate overlaps with another\ndomain registered by the attackers in June 2021, geo-news[.]tv, using the email address\nimmikhan034[@]gmail[.]com. This domain is a typo-squatted version of geo[.]tv, a legitimate\nPakistani news website. Subdomains on the malicious typo-squatted domains include those\nthat hosted SSL certificates for the student and media-themed malicious domains:\n\ncloud-drive.geo-news.tv\ndrive-phone.geo-news.tv\nstudentsportal.geo-news.tv\nuser-onedrive.geo-news.tv\n\nAll the malicious domains have recently resolved to the same IP address:\n198[.]37[.]123[.]126. This strongly suggests shared infrastructure among all the malicious\ndomains.\n\n\n-----\n\nSSL certificate for geo-news[.]tv.\n\n### Honeytraps\n\nMany of the domains registered by the attackers for this campaign consisted of rudimentary\nwebsites with front pages containing embedded Google Drive folders. All of these folders\ncontained pictures of women. It is highly likely that these front pages will be used as stagers\nfor honeytrap-based attacks in the future, another tactic typical of the Transparent Tribe APT.\n\n\n-----\n\nGoogle Drive folder embedded in the fake website operated by Transparent Tribe.\n\n### Infrastructure attribution\n\nThe DNS SOA records for all the malicious domains utilized in this APT campaign contain a\ncommon administrator email address: rupees001[at]gmail[.]com. This email address has\nbeen used to register and administer approximately 2,000 legitimate and malicious domains.\nHowever, there are a couple of domains in this list that stand out:\n\nzainhosting[.]net\nvebhost[.]com\n\nOf the two domains, vebhost[.]com hosts a dummy website that advertises website-building\nservices. The malicious domains used in this campaign, such as studentsportal[.]live and\nothers, use vebhost[.]com name servers, specifically:\n\nns1[.]vebhost[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nns2[.]vebhost[.]com\n\nTherefore, it is highly likely that the operators registering and maintaining the malicious\ndomains also operate web-hosting services through vebhost[.]com.\n\nThe second domain, zainhosting[.]net belongs to a seemingly legitimate web services and\nhosting provider called \"Zain Hosting\" based out of Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nApart from zainhosting[.]net, the hosting provider also operates zainhosting[.]com, which is\nthis business' primary front for their legitimate operations. Interestingly, vebhost[.]com uses\nzainhosting[.]com's name servers:\n\nns5.zainhosting.com\nns6.zainhosting.com\n\nZainHosting advertises their services heavily on Facebook and has been active since at least\n2010. Their webpage from 2010 listed rupees001[at]gmail[.]com as a contact address for the\nbusiness. This email has since been used to register, renew and administer several\nmalicious web pages over time, including the malicious domains used by the Transparent\n_Tribe APT in their most recent campaign._\n\n\n-----\n\nZainHosting webpage from 2010 listing rupees001[at]gmail[.]com as a contact address.\n\nAll three sets of domains -- the malicious Transparent Tribe infrastructure, vebhost[.]com and\nzainhosting[.]net/com -- are clearly related, with \"ZainHosting\"' owning and operating the\nmalicious infrastructure. However, the entire scope of ZainHosting's role in the Transparent\nTribe organization is still unknown. We believe with high confidence that ZainHosting is just\none of the many infrastructure contractors hired by Transparent Tribe. Such contractors\nmight be hired to simply prepare and stage the APT's infrastructure and possibly be given\npackages (archives, etc.) containing malicious artifacts to deploy, that are then distributed by\nthe APT operators themselves to targets of interest.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTransparent Tribe has been aggressively trying to widen its net of victims in the Indian\nsubcontinent. Their operations started as early as at least 2016 and have largely focussed\non infecting government and military officials in Afghanistan and India. Over the past few\nyears, we saw the APT begin targeting pseudo-government entities and individuals\nbelonging to think tanks and defense contractors.\n\nHowever, their new campaign indicates that the threat actors' strategy is evolving to target\ncivilian personnel, specifically those connected to educational institutions. This might be in\naccordance with their nation-state's goal to establish long-term access and steal valuable\nand restricted research from premier research institutions associated with the Indian\ngovernment. Keeping tabs on an adversary nation's research endeavors is a strategic goal\nadopted by many APT groups observed across the world.\n\nOrganizations must be diligent against such highly motivated adversaries that are rapidly\nevolving their strategies and expanding their network of targets. In-depth defense strategies\nbased on a risk analysis approach can deliver the best results in the prevention. However,\nthis should always be complemented by a good incident response plan which has been not\nonly tested with tabletop exercises and reviewed and improved every time it's put to the test\non real engagements.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
