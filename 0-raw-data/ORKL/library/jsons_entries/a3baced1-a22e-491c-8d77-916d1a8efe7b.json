    "plain_text": "# Multiple Security Updates Affecting TCP/IP: CVE-2021- 24074, CVE-2021-24094, and CVE-2021-24086\n\n**[msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/02/09/multiple-security-updates-affecting-tcp-ip/](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/02/09/multiple-security-updates-affecting-tcp-ip/)**\n\nToday Microsoft released a set of fixes affecting Windows TCP/IP implementation that\n[include two Critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-24074,](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-24074) CVE[2021-24094) and an Important Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability (CVE-2021-24086). The](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-24086)\ntwo RCE vulnerabilities are complex which make it difficult to create functional exploits, so\nthey are not likely in the short term. We believe attackers will be able to create DoS exploits\nmuch more quickly and expect all three issues might be exploited with a DoS attack shortly\nafter release. Thus, we recommend customers move quickly to apply Windows security\nupdates this month.\n\nThe DoS exploits for these CVEs would allow a remote attacker to cause a stop\nerror. Customers might receive a blue screen on any Windows system that is directly\nexposed to the internet with minimal network traffic.\n\nIt is essential that customers apply Windows updates to address these vulnerabilities\nas soon as possible. If applying the update quickly is not practical, workarounds are detailed in\nthe CVEs that do not require restarting a server. These three vulnerabilities are unique and\nrequire separate workarounds depending on the exposure of an affected system; however,\nthey can be thought of in terms of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol\nversion 6 (IPv6) solutions.\n\nThe IPv4 workaround simply requires further hardening against the use of Source Routing,\nwhich is disallowed in Windows default state. This workaround is documented in CVE-202124074 and can be applied through Group Policy or by running a NETSH command that does\n[not require a reboot. The IPv6 workarounds are documented in CVE-2021-24094 and CVE-](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-24094)\n2021-24086, and require blocking IPv6 fragments, which may negatively impact services\nwith dependencies on IPv6.\n\n**Note: IPv4 Source Routing requests and IPv6 fragments can be blocked on an edge device,**\nsuch as a load balancer or a firewall. This option can be used to mitigate systems with highrisk exposure and then allow the systems to be patched following their standard cadence.\n\nThese vulnerabilities were discovered by Microsoft as part of our continual focus on\nstrengthening the security of our products. At this time, we have no evidence that these\nvulnerabilities were known to any third party. These vulnerabilities result from a flaw in\nMicrosoft’s implementation of TCP/IP and affect all Windows versions. Non-Microsoft\nimplementations are not affected.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important that affected systems are patched as quickly as possible because of the\nelevated risk associated with these vulnerabilities, and downloads for these can be found in\nthe [Microsoft Security Update Guide. Customers who have automatic updates enabled](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide)\nare automatically protected from these vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----",
