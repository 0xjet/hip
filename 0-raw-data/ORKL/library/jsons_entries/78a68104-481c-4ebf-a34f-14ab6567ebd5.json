First discovered by security researcher JAMESWT, this](https://twitter.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/961544389364461568)\nransomware will modify the master boot record of the victim's computer so that it shows a\nransom note before Windows starts.\n\nUnfortunately, I was not able to get this sample to run, so I have no first hand analysis of this\nransomware. The [AnyRun video posted by JAMESWT, though, shows that once you install](https://app.any.run/tasks/0a7e643f-7562-4575-b8a5-747bd6b5f02d)\nthe ransomware, it immediately reboots the computer and the victim is greeted with an ascii\nskull and a message to send 30 yaun to the 2055965068 qq address in order to get access to\ntheir computer again.\n\n**DexCrypt Lock Screen**\n\nMicrosoft's Windows Defender Security Team saw Jame's tweet and tweeted that they have\nlabeled the MBRLocker as Ransom:DOS/Dexcrypt.A and that it can be detected by Windows\nDefender.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ICYMI: New #ransomware writes code to the Master Boot Record (MBR) and immediately](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ransomware?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nrestarts computer to show a note that asks for 30 yuan as ransom. Windows Defender AV\ndetects and blocks this ransomware as Ransom:Win32/Dexcrypt and its MBR-writing code as\nRansom:DOS/Dexcrypt.A.

If this password](https://twitter.com/xiaopaosister)\ndoes not work and it does only replace the MBR, it can be fixed by booting up into the\nWindows Recovery Console and restoring the Master Boot Record using the following\ncommands:\n```\nbootrec /RebuildBcd\nbootrec /fixMbr\nbootrec /fixboot\n\n```\nOnce you enter these commands, you can reboot and get access again to Windows again.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Hashes:\n```\ndfc56a704b5e031f3b0d2d0ea1d06f9157758ad950483b44ac4b77d33293cb38\n\n Ransom Note:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n  . .\n /      \\ \n |       |\n |, .-. .-.,|\n | )(__/ \\__)( |\n |/   /\\   \\|\n (_   ^^   _)\n \\__|IIIIII|__/\n  | \\IIIIII/ |\n  \\     /\n  `yao mi ma gei 30 yuan jia qq 2055965068`\n\n```\nAD\n\n[DexCrypt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/dexcrypt/)\n[MBR](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mbr/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
