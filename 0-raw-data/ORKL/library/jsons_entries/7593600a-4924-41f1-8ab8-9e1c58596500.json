It is also known as Troldesh. Shade has been\n[distributed through malicious spam (malspam) and exploit kits. A recent report focused on](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/01/28/russia-hit-new-wave-ransomware-spam/)\nRussian language emails that deliver Shade, but this ransomware is also distributed through\nEnglish-language malspam.\n\nWhere is Shade currently appearing? To answer this question, we reviewed recent trends in\nShade ransomware among our customer base. Our results indicate the majority of recent\nShade ransomware executables have also targeted users outside of Russia.\n\nIn fact, our research shows that the top five countries affected by Shade ransomware are not\nRussia or nations of the former Soviet Union, they are the United States, Japan, India,\nThailand, and Canada, Russia only occurs at number seven and the only other country we\nfound in the top ten where Russian is an official language is Kazakhstan at number ten. The\ntop industries attacked in these countries were High-Tech, Wholesale, and Education.\n\n**Very Little Change Since 2016**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Shade ransomware executable (EXE) has been remarkably consistent. All EXE samples\n[we have analyzed since 2016 use the same Tor address at cryptsen7f043rr6.onion as a](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Malspam+distributing+Troldesh+ransomware/21717/)\ndecryptor page. The desktop background that appears during an infection has been the\nsame since Shade was first reported as Troldesh in late 2014.\n\n[Shade ransomware infections may include other activity like click fraud traffic as noted here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_fraud)\n\n**Russian and English Language Distribution**\n\n[Recent reports of malspam pushing Shade ransomware have focused on distribution through](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/01/28/russia-hit-new-wave-ransomware-spam/)\nRussian language emails. However, Shade decryption instructions have always included\nEnglish as well as Russian text. English language waves of malspam have been noted\npushing Shade ransomware, like this wave of IRS notifications targeting recipients in the\nUnited States in 2017.\n\n**What does a Shade infection look like?**\n\nWhen a Windows host is infected with Shade ransomware, its desktop background\nannounces the infection, and ten text files appear on the desktop named README1.txt\nthrough README10.txt as shown in Figure 1.\n\n_Figure 1. Desktop of a Windows host infected with Shade ransomware._\n\nThe ten README files all contain the same instructions as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Decryption instructions from a recent Shade ransomware infection._\n\nSince June 2016, file extensions for any encrypted files are .crypted000007 as shown in\nFigure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Examples of encrypted files from a Shade ransomware infection._\n\nShade Distribution through Malspam\n\nMalspam-based infections for Shade ransomware involve a JavaScript (.js) or other type of\nscript-based file disguised as an invoice or bill. In some cases, Shade malspam has links for\nthese script-based files. In other cases, the files are directly attached to the emails within a\n[zip file or other type of archive. In February 2019, waves of Russian-language malspam used](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/More+Russian+language+malspam+pushing+Shade+Troldesh+ransomware/24668/)\nattached PDF files with links to download zip archives containing these script-based files.\n\nIn all cases we have reviewed, a .js or other script-based file was involved as indicated in\nFigure 4. These script-based files are designed to retrieve executable files for Shade\nransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Flow chart for malspam-based Shade ransomware infections._\n\nExecutable delivery during the infection chain\n\nMalspam-based Shade infection chains have one thing in common. They all involve\nretrieving an executable file from a compromised server. By focusing on the executable in\nthis chain of events, we can determine where Shade ransomware infection attempts have\noccurred.\n\nAutoFocus search parameters\n\n[AutoFocus has a Shade ransomware tag that identifies any items associated with Shade](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Shade)\nransomware. We searched on attempted deliveries of a Shade ransomware executable\nduring an infection chain, and we focused our search on packed executable (PE) files sent\nthrough a URL over TCP port 80.\n\nSince we're trying to determine geographic locations among our customer base where\nShade ransomware attempts have happened, we looked for the country of Palo Alto\nNetworks devices that discovered these attempts.\n\nThis search is for the first quarter of 2019.\n\nFinally, our query eliminated any obvious malware submissions to online sandboxes and\nonline sharing services. Our search parameters from the AutoFocus database were:\n\nDate is in the range from January 1st through March 31st\nUnit 42 tag is for Shade ransomware\nFile type is PE\nFile URL has any value but is not unknown\nSource port (the TCP port the file came from) is 80\nDevice Country has any value (is not blank or unidentified)\nFile URL does not contain the string /malware/\nFile URL does not contain the string malshare.com\nFile URL does not contain the string paloaltonetworks\n\n\n-----\n\nFile URL does not contain the string local\n\n_Figure 5. An AutoFocus query for Shade ransomware executables in the first quarter of_\n_2019._\n\n**Results from January through March 2019**\n\nOur search results from January through March 2019 revealed 307 Shade ransomware\nsamples over 6,536 sessions. Each session represents an HTTP request for a URL hosting\na Shade ransomware executable. Many of these URLs were seen multiple times in separate\nsessions. Locations of our top ten results were:\n\nUnited States - 2,010 sessions\nJapan - 1,677 sessions\nIndia - 989 sessions\nThailand - 723 sessions\nCanada - 712 sessions\nSpain - 505 sessions\nRussian Federation - 86 sessions\nFrance - 71 sessions\nUnited Kingdom - 67 sessions\nKazakhstan - 21 sessions\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Top ten countries from our AutoFocus search results as shown on a world map._\n\nThe top country with Shade ransomware infection attempts among our customer base was\nthe United States. The vast majority of these for URLs hosting Shade ransomware\nexecutables were reported from customer devices outside of Russia and Russian language\ncountries.\n\nThe top 10 verticals for this period were:\n\nHigh Tech: 5,009 sessions\nWholesale and Retail: 722 sessions\nEducation: 720 sessions\nTelecommunications: 311 sessions\nFinance: 51 sessions\nTransportation and Logistics: 24 sessions\nManufacturing: 32 sessions\nProfessional and Legal Services: 8 sessions\nUtilities and Energy: 4 sessions\nState and Local Government: 1 session\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe top country with Shade ransomware infection attempts among our customer base was\nthe United States. The vast majority of these for URLs hosting Shade ransomware\nexecutables were reported from customer devices outside of Russia and Russian language\ncountries.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most common target for Shade ransomware infection attempts were organizations that\nfell under the High Tech category.\n\nThese results are likely skewed towards English due to our customer base. However, they\nindicate Shade ransomware is very active outside of Russia and possibly targeting more\nEnglish-speaking victims than Russian.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from Shade ransomware by our threat\n[prevention platform which easily detects these executables. AutoFocus users can track](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/autofocus)\n[Shade ransomware attempts by using the Shade tag.
