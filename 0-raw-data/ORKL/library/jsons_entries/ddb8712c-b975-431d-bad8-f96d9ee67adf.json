Over time, the threat actors have\ndemonstrated a high level of organization, a wide range of criminal activity, and the ability to\n\n\n-----\n\nsteal significant amounts of money. Many of the same threat actors have been involved with\nthe different incarnations of the group for more than 15 years, and they used various\nmalware families to achieve their goals. The adaptability to enhanced fraud controls and\ninfrastructure takedowns demonstrates GOLD EVERGREEN’s resourcefulness,\nsophistication, and resilience.\n\n## Background\n\nGOLD EVERGREEN evolved from the Eastern European threat group Rock Phish (also\nknown as the [Rock gang), which was active from 2004 to 2008. The Rock Phish name is](http://www.bcs.org/content/ConWebDoc/16125)\nbased on strings in the group’s phishing URLs. Its large-scale and geographically focused\n[phishing campaigns impersonated several banks using multiple phishing sites hosted on the](http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Security/Inside-Rock-Phishing/1)\nsame infrastructure. In early 2007, Rock Phish was one of the first threat groups to use fast[flux DNS on a large scale. It also used a centralized collector system to send stolen](http://www.h-online.com/security/features/Rock-Phishing-747346.html)\ncredentials through layers of proxies and collect them in a central database hosted on a\n[bulletproof infrastructure. Standard phishing kits were vulnerable to hijacking because they](https://www.quora.com/What-is-bulletproof-hosting)\n[were easily backdoored or they stored stolen credentials with world-readable permissions.](http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/ifip11-9/df2011/McCalleyWW11.pdf)\n\n[In late 2008, the Rock Phish threat group incorporated the Asprox botnet into an upgraded](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/05/rock_phish_and_asprox_team_up/)\ninfrastructure. The evolution to hosting phishing sites on a botnet of compromised home\ncomputers rather than on compromised websites or purchased infrastructure made the\ncompromised systems much more difficult to seize or take down. Centralized backend\ncollectors located in Eastern Europe were used with globally distributed proxies. While this\nbotnet and hosting platform were used for other criminal activity, it was Rock Phish’s phishing\nattack style and use of the botnet that earned notoriety. However, the activity was attributed\nto the [Avalanche threat group.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_(phishing_group))\n\n[In a 2009 report, the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) named Avalanche “the world’s](http://docs.apwg.org/reports/APWG_GlobalPhishingSurvey_2H2009.pdf)\nmost prolific phishing gang” and deemed it “responsible for two-thirds of the phishing attacks\nlaunched in the second half of 2009.” CTU™ researchers assess it is highly likely that many\nof the Rock Phish threat actors moved to the Avalanche hosting network to improve their\nphishing activity. Most of the Rock Phish threat actors were of Ukrainian and Russian origin,\nwith reported Romanian and Moldovian involvement. Due to the limitations of law\nenforcement and cybercrime investigative capability in 2009, there were no arrests or\nindictments of Rock Phish or Avalanche threat actors. As the Avalanche network grew, it\nbecame a popular hosting platform for many criminal enterprises until November 2016, when\nit was dismantled and its administrators (including Ukrainian Hennadiy Kapkanov) were\narrested after a four-year investigation. Kapkanov appeared before a Ukrainian court but was\nreleased, and his location is unknown as of this publication. The threat group evolved into\nGOLD EVERGREEN when it began using Gameover Zeus for its activities.\n\n## Related malware\n\n\n-----\n\nOver the years, the threat group used different malware families to conduct their activities.\nSome of the malware families shared code and infrastructure.\n\n### Zeus and Jabberzeus\n\nThe [Zeus information-stealing malware created by Evgeniy Bogachev (also known as Slavik,](https://www.secureworks.com/research/zeus)\nA-Z, Pollingsoon, and Lucky12345) was first observed in late 2006. Zeus offered advanced\nfunctionality such as dynamically interacting with bank websites, not requiring lookalike\nphishing domains (which required registration and were subject to takedown), and providing\nkeylogging to steal a wide range of credentials. It was distributed via the Avalanche\ninfrastructure in late-2009, but the volume of Avalanche phishing attacks dropped\nsignificantly by mid-2010 (see Figure 1). CTU researchers assess that the Avalanche threat\ngroup tested the Zeus malware using the Avalanche hosting infrastructure and then switched\nto distributing Zeus directly via email messages, causing the drop in observed phishing\nattacks.\n\n_Figure 1. Avalanche phishing attacks between July 2009 and June 2010. (Source: APWG)_\n\nBy leveraging Zeus, the Avalanche threat group increased earnings and diversified its\n[activities. The group rented the Cutwail spam botnet in early 2010 to send spam emails](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/avalanche-botnet-moves-from-distributing-spam-to-zeus-lures/article/561212/)\ncontaining Zeus attachments. The transition to information-stealing malware was pragmatic\nbecause stolen credentials resulted in fewer successful fraudulent transactions as banks\nincreased their fraud controls. New solutions were needed for criminals to bypass challenge\nquestions and fraud detection based on IP addresses in specific geographic locations.\n\n[Around mid-2009, suspected Avalanche members worked with Zeus trojan creator Bogachev](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/fbi-3m-bounty-for-zeus-trojan-author/#more-30070)\nto develop a customized version. Jabberzeus incorporated the Jabber communication\nprotocol to notify threat actors when a victim logged into their online banking account.\nSecureWorks [reported that banks lost approximately $100 million in 2009 due to the](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-06-18/the-hunt-for-the-financial-industry-s-most-wanted-hacker)\nJabberzeus botnet. The Avalanche threat group used it in conjunction with the Leprechaun\nprivate inject framework (see Figure 2) to automate fraudulent transactions on Internet\n\n\n-----\n\nbanking platforms. Leprechaun was likely developed by Alexey Tikonov (also known as\nKusanagi and Kusunagi), whom Microsoft also named as a coder and inject writer involved\n[with Zeus in its 2012 John Doe lawsuit. The Leprechaun framework was highly customizable](http://www.zeuslegalnotice.com/images/Debenham_Decl_Part_1.pdf)\nand allowed threat actors to write web injects for each targeted organization. The web injects\ncould be customized to each victim’s online experience and could anticipate security and\nanti-fraud controls. Leprechaun also allowed threat actors to alter a victim’s banking\ntransactions in real time. For example, when a victim logged into their banking account to\ntransfer money, the threat actors could surreptitiously modify the transaction (including the\nvalue and destination) as it was sent from the web browser. This approach circumvents twofactor authentication.\n\n_Figure 2. Leprechaun framework. (Source: NSS Labs)_\n\nRock Phish and Avalanche were the first threat groups to perform Automated Clearing\n[House (ACH) fraud, which involves wire transfers from compromised accounts to domestic](http://www.csoonline.com/article/2125833/malware-cybercrime/ach-fraud--why-criminals-love-this-con.html)\nmoney mules who forward the money overseas. The threat actors also used the Leprechaun\nframework for ACH fraud. Targeted financial institutions were unsure how to detect and block\nfraudulent transfers before a money mule withdrew the funds. However, this type of fraud\nwas easily identifiable after financial institutions established processes and technical controls\naddressing user-session fraud detection.\n\n**Infrastructure disruption**\n\nIn March 2010, an effort to [take down some of Zeus infrastructure impacted Troyak, a](http://www.itworld.com/article/2762789/it-management/zeus-botnet-dealt-a-blow-as-isp-troyak-knocked-out.html)\nbulletproof hosting provider running servers in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia, and Moldova.\nTroyak was [used by Rock Phish, Avalanche, Gozi, and Jabberzeus threat actors. Although](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/03/researchers-map-multi-network-cybercrime-infrastructure/)\nthe disruption was temporary, it represented the largest number of Zeus servers going offline\nin one instance. CTU analysis indicates that Andrey Ghinkul, who provided infrastructure to\nthe Rock Phish and Avalanche threat groups, was a key contributor in establishing and\noperating Troyak.\n\n**Operation Trident breACH arrests**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn September 2010, law enforcement from the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands,\nUkraine, and the United States (U.S.) arrested more than 50 individuals suspected of ACH\n[fraud related to Jabberzeus as part of Operation Trident breACH. The U.S. Federal Bureau](http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/10/01/cyber.theft/)\nof Investigation (FBI) noted that the cybercriminals had attempted to steal $220 million and\n[successfully stole $70 million in the U.S. UK law enforcement arrested an additional 19](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1316022/Nineteen-arrested-online-bank-raid-netted-20m.html)\nsuspects for fraud. The suspects, [led by Ukrainian nationals Yevhen Kulibaba (also known as](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-15542016)\n[Jonni) and Yuriy Konovalenko (also known as jtk0), operated the UK division of the cash-out](https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/5922014411104621620917.pdf)\nmoney mule operations for Jabberzeus and potentially other threat groups that used Zeus.\nBoth were sentenced to almost five years in prison.\n\nA U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) [affidavit unsealed in August 2012 named the following](https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/2162014411104532407242.pdf)\nJabberzeus core members. The affidavit also outlines their involvement in ACH fraud and\nprovided probable cause for offenses committed in May 2009.\n\nYvacheslav Igorevich Penchukov (also known as tank and father)\nIvan Viktorvich Klepikov (also known as petr0vich and nowhere)\nAlexey Dmitrievich Bron (also known as thehead)\nAlexey Tikonov (also known as kusanagi)\nYevhen Kulibaba (also known as jonni)\nYuriy Konovalenko (also known as jtk0)\nJohn Doe #1 (also known as lucky12345)\nJohn Doe #2 (also known as aqua)\nJohn Doe #3 (also known as mricq)\n\n**Zeus resiliency**\n\nFollowing the Operation Trident breACH arrests, computers infected with Jabberzeus were\n[infected with a new Zeus version named Licat (also known as Murofet), suggesting that the](http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/emerging-murofet-botnet-poses-new-threat-researchers-say/d/d-id/1134733?)\nthreat group continued malicious activities using new malware. This malware was fully\nfunctional and ready for deployment before the Jabberzeus members were arrested.\n\nIn addition, Spyeye information-stealing malware author Alexander Panin (also known as\n[Harderman and Gribodemon) announced that Bogachev had delivered the Zeus source code](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/10/spyeye-v-zeus-rivalry-ends-in-quiet-merger/)\nand Panin would now support Zeus users and offer a 30% discount on his Spyeye trojan. In\nJanuary 2011, he released Spyeye version 1.3.05, which merged core Zeus functionality,\nmultiple network backdoors, a credit card number stealer, and web injects. During this\n[period, there were rumors in the criminal underground that Bogachev had not retired from](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/25/spyeye_zeus_merger/)\nmalware development but was “keeping a lower profile” while continuing to work on Zeus\nversions.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In March 2011, Zeus source code was available for purchase on underground forums, and it](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/23/zeus_source_code_sale/)\nwas publicly leaked in May 2011. Figure 3 shows Zeus versions created by various threat\nactors between 2006 and 2013.\n\n_Figure 3. Zeus timeline. (Source: S21)_\n\n### Gameover Zeus\n\nIn September 2011, researchers identified a new Zeus variant named Gameover Zeus (also\n[known as Zeus Game Over, GoZ, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Zeus), which added a complex](http://www.syssec-project.eu/m/page-media/3/zeus_malware13.pdf)\ncommand and control (C2) architecture that used layers of proxies and P2P communication.\nThis new functionality frustrated traditional takedown and attribution activities by law\nenforcement and security researchers. Gameover Zeus also included an automated transfer\n[system (ATS). Known within the group as “The World Bank Center,” this system evolved](http://blog.mindedsecurity.com/2012/09/zeus-gameover-overview.html)\nfrom the Leprechaun framework used with Jabberzeus. It allowed threat actors to conduct\nadvanced automated transaction alterations, such as checking the account balance and\nsetting maximum amounts to transfer (see Figure 4). These actions were communicated in\nreal time to threat group members.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. The Gameover Zeus ATS panel. (Source:_ _[Minded Security)](http://blog.mindedsecurity.com/2012/09/zeus-gameover-overview.html)_\n\n[Between 2011 and 2014, Gameover Zeus and the ATS module were used to steal several](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/03/fbi-busts-russian-hacked-created-zeus-cryptolocker/9919985/)\nhundred thousand dollars to multimillions in individual ACH transfers and other bank transfer\nmethods. Another common tactic was to access payroll systems and add money mules as\npayroll recipients. By mid-2014, the Gameover Zeus botnet included approximately one\nmillion compromised computers and was responsible for tens of millions of dollars in\n[fraudulent transactions. The Gameover Zeus threat group, which CTU researchers labeled](http://www.securityweek.com/gameover-zeus-gang-leader-engaged-espionage-researchers)\nGOLD EVERGREEN, included more than 50 individuals. Bogachev was one of the leaders.\n\nThreat actors could rent a portion of the Gameover Zeus network or its keylogged data store\nfor their criminal enterprises. Renters were required to tithe a portion of the takings to GOLD\nEVERGREEN. Gameover Zeus was [spread by almost every malware distribution method](https://www.secureworks.com/research/the_lifecycle_of_peer_to_peer_gameover_zeus)\navailable at the time: spam messages with malicious attachments sent by the Cutwail botnet,\n[Blackhole exploit kit installations, Upatre infections purchased using a pay-per-install (PPI)](https://www.secureworks.com/research/analyzing-upatre-downloader)\nmodel, and the Pony Loader malware. The threat actors aimed to install Gameover Zeus on\nas many computers as possible and had such high confidence in the network’s resilience\nand the bulletproof hosting of its backend infrastructure that it did not attempt to hide the\ngrowth and use of this botnet. In 2011, Bogachev created a separate Gameover Zeus\n[network exclusively for espionage. The FBI](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Peterson-GameOver-Zeus-Badguys-And-Backends.pdf) [detected searches for stolen information related](http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/08/05/gameover-zeus-surveillance-links/#15d9f0e34a29)\nto the Ukrainian federal security service, several Georgian government departments, and\nTurkey’s links to Syria.\n\nGameover Zeus uses several layers of communication to maintain uptime and obfuscate the\ntrue location of the final layer of C2 and stolen data collection servers. Its operators also\n[used several bulletproof hosting suppliers. A U.S. government's criminal complaint against](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/legacy/2014/05/30/complaint.pdf)\nGOLD EVERGREEN members alleged that the threat group used Gameover Zeus to\n[download and install the CryptoLocker ransomware. After encrypting victims’ computers, the](https://www.secureworks.com/research/cryptolocker-ransomware)\nthreat actors demanded approximately $750 to decrypt the files.\n\n**Operation Tovar**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn June 2014, law enforcement and private security companies including SecureWorks\n[participated in Operation Tovar, a coordinated effort to take down the Gameover Zeus botnet.](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/operation-tovar-dell-secureworks-contributes-to-efforts-targeting-gameover-zeus-and-cryptolocker)\n[The takedown disrupted Gameover Zeus activity, and despite a re-emergence in July 2014, it](http://www.scmagazineuk.com/operation-tovar-targets-major-zeuscryptolocker-botnet-driven-campaign/article/349717/)\nnever returned to its previous scale.\n\nThe DoJ published detailed documents listing the names and nicknames of the GOLD\nEVERGREEN members. Members Temp Special, DED, and CHINGZ 911 (also known as\nCHINGZ and MR KYKYPYKY) were listed without real names. The documents name\nBogachev as a leader of the threat group and author of Gameover Zeus. The FBI offered a\n[reward of $3 million for information leading to his capture (see Figure 5). As of this](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/evgeniy-mikhailovich-bogachev)\npublication, Bogachev remains at large and is thought to reside in the Russian Federation.\n[Russian authorities have not publicly arrested Bogachev and have given no indication of that](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/world/europe/russia-hacker-evgeniy-bogachev.html)\nintent.\n\n_Figure 5. Bogachev FBI most wanted poster. (Source: FBI)_\n\n### Dyre and Bugat v5/Dridex\n\n\n-----\n\n[Two weeks after the Gameover Zeus takedown, the Dyre (also known as Dyreza) banking](https://www.secureworks.com/research/dyre-banking-trojan)\ntrojan was observed on the Internet. CTU researchers noted a connection between Dyre and\nthe Gozi Neverquest trojan that suggested the same threat actors were responsible for both\n[malware families. Dyre developers and users typically operated during standard working](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/dyre-emerging-threat.pdf)\n[hours: 9 am to 4 pm Monday to Friday (UTC+2 or UTC+3). Reports indicated that some Dyre](https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/%E2%80%9Csmash-grab%E2%80%9D-cybercrime-attacks-have-been-active-since-mid-june)\nattacks could be connected to the GOLD EVERGREEN threat group based on the timing,\nthe Upatre downloader, a sophisticated ATS, and the same large-scale cashout\nmethodology.\n\nThe Bugat v5 (also known as Dridex) banking trojan, which was observed in July 2014,\nincorporated a modular architecture and a complex P2P network similar to Gameover Zeus.\nBugat v5 is a variant of the Bugat (also known as Cridex) trojan, which CTU researchers\n[identified in 2010. A new threat group named Evil Corporation (also known as EvillCorp)](http://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-and-uk-cops-smash-dridex-a-high-stakes-bank-raiding-botnet/)\nused Bugat v5 as its primary malware to steal credentials and money. Bugat v5 operators\nalso exhibited a standard Monday to Friday working pattern. They primarily targeted financial\ninstitutions in Western countries and used the Cutwail spam botnet to send emails containing\nmalicious Office document attachments.\n\nCTU researchers assess that GOLD EVERGREEN diversified its malware portfolio using the\nDyre and Bugat v5 trojans to minimize the risks associated with another takedown. In\n[addition to stealing banking credentials, both malware families could be used for espionage.](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/09/dyre-malware-branches-out-from-banking-adds-corporate-espionage/)\nGOLD EVERGREEN used Dyre almost exclusively to steal from large business banking and\nwealth management accounts, while Bugat v5 was primarily used to steal from retail banking\naccounts.\n\n**Takeover and arrests**\n\nIn October 2015, CTU researchers worked with the FBI, the UK National Crime Agency\n[(NCA), and the Shadowserver Foundation to take over the Bugat v5 network. On the same](https://www.secureworks.com/research/dridex-bugat-v5-botnet-takeover-operation)\n[day, the DoJ unsealed an indictment announcing that Andrey Ghinkul, who had a history of](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/bugat-botnet-administrator-arrested-and-malware-disabled)\ninvolvement with infrastructure used by GOLD EVERGREEN, had been arrested in Cyprus\nand was facing extradition to the United States. Ghinkul was extradited to the U.S. in\nFebruary 2016 to stand trial in federal court for charges related to administering the Bugat v5\nbotnets. He [pled guilty to charges of conspiracy and damaging a computer and is scheduled](http://triblive.com/local/allegheny/11915989-74/bank-district-account)\nto be sentenced on July 13, 2017.\n\nThe indictment also described various fraudulent transactions conducted by the Evil\nCorporation threat group. As of this publication, the Bugat v5 criminal enterprise continues to\noperate. The NCA [arrested 14 suspects in November 2016 and charged them with money](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/948-nca-targets-international-cyber-crime-network)\nmule and laundering offenses. The suspects were linked to thefts of approximately $13.6\nmillion using the Bugat v5 network.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In November 2015, Russian authorities reportedly arrested some GOLD EVERGREEN](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/10/moscow_raids_could_signal_end_of_global_dyre_bank_trojan_menace/)\nmembers operating Dyre, but law enforcement did not announce the arrests until February\n2016. Coincidentally, CTU researchers observed Dyre becoming inactive in November.\n\n**TrickBot/TheTrick**\n\nIn October 2016, the [TrickBot (also known as TheTrick) information-stealing malware](http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/10/trickbot-the-dyre-connection.html)\ntargeted banks in Australia. CTU researchers identified many similarities with Dyre and\nconcluded that TrickBot was derived from Dyre. Between October and early November 2016,\nthe TrickBot threat actors added Canadian, German, and UK banks to their list of targets but\nhave not conducted any fraud as of this publication. Despite the connection to Dyre, there is\ninsufficient information to determine if GOLD EVERGREEN is using TrickBot. It is possible\nthat a copycat threat actor acquired the Dyre source code.\n\n**White House sanctions**\n\n[In late December 2016, the President of the United States issued Executive Order 13964,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/29/fact-sheet-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity-and)\nwhich sanctioned nine entities responsible for Russian government-based cyberattacks on\nthe U.S. The entities included Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (Glavnoe\nRazvedyvatel’noe Upravlenie (GRU)) and Federal Security Service (Federalnaya Sluzhba\nBezopasnosti (FSB)), organizations that supported the GRU and FSB, and key staff\nmembers. The order also sanctioned Aleksey Alekseyevich Belan (also known as Magg,\nM4G, and Moy.Yawik) from Riga, Latvia and GOLD EVERGREEN leader Bogachev for\n“using cyber-enabled means to cause misappropriation of funds and personal identifying\ninformation” against U.S. citizens.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis group of tight-knit and loosely connected threat actors has been active for at least 15\nyears. In spite of multiple indictments and arrests, they continue to represent a major threat\nto global economies, and appear to be well-versed in the methods and tools used by\ntraditional organized crime groups. CTU researchers conclude that GOLD EVERGREEN is\nlikely operating in a limited capacity as of this publication.\n\nAs banks refine their fraud controls and authentication mechanisms, threat groups improve\ntheir technical abilities, tools, and targeting capabilities. Threat groups have reduced their\nfocus on retail banking because effective fraud controls defeat a relatively small payout and\nbanks can block a money mule after a single fraudulent transaction. Instead, they are\nincreasingly targeting business banking, share trading, wealth management,\nsuperannuation/retirement savings, and payroll systems, where large amounts of money are\nprotected by less sophisticated fraud controls.\n\nCTU researchers recommend that organizations monitor information about active threat\ngroups and their evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), adapting security\ncontrols as appropriate Although persistent threat actors focus on circumventing security\n\n\n-----\n\nmeasures, organizations can limit impact by following best practices such as implementing\nand regularly testing detection and prevention controls, educating users about the risks of\nspearphishing campaigns and email attachments, and using the principle of least privilege to\nlimit access to sensitive data.\n\n\n-----",
