This attack led to widespread gasoline shortages\nthat affected tens of millions of Americans. Other recent\ntargets include entities in the manufacturing, legal services,\ninsurance, financial services, health care, energy, and food\nproduction sectors.\n\n\n**SAR Filing Request**\n\nproduction sectors.\n\nFinCEN requests financial\ninstitutions reference this FinCEN issued the original advisory to alert financial\nadvisory in SAR field 2 (Filing institutions to predominant trends, typologies, and potential\nInstitution Note to FinCEN) and indicators of ransomware and associated money laundering\nthe narrative by including the activities. The advisory provided information on: (1) the role\nfollowing key term: “CYBER of financial intermediaries in the processing of ransomware\n**FIN-2021-A004” and select**\n\npayments; (2) trends and typologies of ransomware and\n\nSAR field 42 (Cyber Event).\n\nassociated payments; (3) ransomware-related financial red\n\nAdditional guidance for filing\n\nflag indicators; and (4) reporting and sharing information\n\nSARs appears near the end of\n\nrelated to ransomware attacks. This amended advisory\n\nthis advisory.\n\nreflects information released by FinCEN in its Financial\nTrend Analysis Report issued on October 15, 2021, and is part of the Department of the Treasury’s\nbroader efforts to combat ransomware.[2] In particular, this updated advisory identifies new trends\n\n\n1. FIN-2020-A006\n2. _[See U.S. Department of the Treasury Press Release, “Treasury Continues Campaign to Combat Ransomware As Part](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0410)_\n[of Whole-of-Government Effort,” (Oct. 15, 2021); and FinCEN, Financial Trend Analysis: Ransomware Trends in Bank](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0410)\n[Secrecy Act Data Between January 2021 and June 2021 (FinCEN 2021 Ransomware Report) at 3 (Oct 15 2021); see also](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/Financial Trend Analysis_Ransomeware 508 FINAL.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nand typologies of ransomware and associated payments, including the growing proliferation of\nanonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies (AECs) and decentralized mixers.[3]\n\nAdditionally, in October 2020, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released “Cryptocurrency: An\nEnforcement Framework,” a publication produced by the Attorney General’s Cyber-Digital\nTask Force. The Framework provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and\nenforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency;\ndetails the important relationships that the DOJ has built with regulatory and enforcement partners\nboth within the U.S. government and around the world; and outlines the DOJ’s response strategies.\nAmong other topics, the Framework discusses the use of cryptocurrency as a payment method by\nbad actors to facilitate ransom and blackmail.[4]\n\nThe information contained in this advisory is derived from FinCEN’s analysis of cyber and\nransomware-related Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) data, open source reporting, and law enforcement partners.\n\n\n**_Ransomware is a form of malicious software (“malware”) designed to block access to a_**\ncomputer system or data, often by encrypting data or programs on information technology (IT)\nsystems to extort ransom payments from victims in exchange for decrypting the information\nand restoring victims’ access to systems or data.[5] In some cases, in addition to the encrypting\ninformation, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive files belonging to the victims, which\ncan be individuals or business entities (including financial institutions). The consequences of\na ransomware attack can be severe and far-reaching—with losses of sensitive, proprietary, and\ncritical information and/or loss of business functionality.\n\n\n## The Role of Financial Intermediaries in Facilitating\n\n Ransomware Payments\n\nRansomware attacks are a growing concern for the financial sector because of the critical role\nfinancial institutions play in the collection of ransom payments. Processing ransomware payments\nis typically a multi-step process that involves at least one depository institution and one or more\nentities directly or indirectly facilitating victim payments, including money services businesses\n(MSB). Most ransomware schemes involve convertible virtual currency (CVC), the preferred\npayment method of ransomware perpetrators. Following the delivery of the ransom demand, a\nransomware victim will typically transmit funds via wire transfer, automated clearinghouse, or\ncredit card payment to a CVC exchange to purchase the type and amount of CVC specified by the\nransomware perpetrator. Next, the victim or an entity working on the victim’s behalf sends the\nCVC, often from a wallet hosted[6] at the exchange, to the perpetrator’s designated account or CVC\n\n3. _See_ [FinCEN 2021 Ransomware Report, at 2, 3, 9, 12-13 (Oct. 15, 2021).](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/Financial Trend Analysis_Ransomware 508 FINAL.pdf)\n4. _[See DOJ Report of the Attorney General’s Cyber Criminal Task Force, Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework](https://www.justice.gov/archives/ag/page/file/1326061/download)_\n[(Oct. 2020) (hereinafter, DOJ Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework); see also DOJ Press Release, “Attorney General](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-announces-publication-cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework)\n[William P. Barr Announces Publication of Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework,” (Oct. 8, 2020).](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-announces-publication-cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework)\n5. Both extortion and computer fraud and abuse are specified unlawful activities and predicate offenses to money\nlaundering. See 18 U.S.C § 1956(c)(7).\n6. “Hosted wallets” are CVC wallets where the CVC exchange receives, stores, and transmits the CVCs on behalf of their\n[accountholders See FinCEN Guidance FIN-2019-G001 “Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Certain Business](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN Guidance CVC FINAL 508.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\naddress. The perpetrator then launders the funds through various means — including mixers,\ntumblers,[7] and chain hopping[8] — to convert funds into other CVCs. These transactions may be\nstructured into smaller “smurfing”[9] transactions involving multiple people, and across many\ndifferent CVC addresses, accounts, and exchanges, including peer-to-peer (P2P)[10] and nested\nexchanges. Criminals prefer to launder their ransomware proceeds in jurisdictions with weak antimoney laundering and countering financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls.\n\nCyber insurance companies (CICs) and digital forensic and incident response (DFIR) companies\ncan also play a role in ransomware transactions. CICs issue policies designed to mitigate an\nentity’s losses from a variety of cyber incidents, such as data breaches, business interruption,\nand network damage. CICs may reimburse policyholders for particular remediation services\nincluding the use of DFIRs if needed. As part of incident remediation, affected entities may hire\na DFIR company to negotiate with the cybercriminal, facilitate payment to the cybercriminal, and\ninvestigate the source of the cybersecurity breach.\n\n**Figure 1.

Mixing or tumbling involves the use of mechanisms to break the connection between an address sending CVC and\nthe addresses receiving CVC. For more information, see [FinCEN 2021 Ransomware Report, at 13 (Oct. 15, 2021).](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/Financial Trend Analysis_Ransomeware 508 FINAL.pdf)\n8. Chain hopping is a cross-virtual-asset layering technique for users attempting to conceal criminal behavior. Criminals\nobfuscate the trail of virtual currency by shifting the trail of transactions from the blockchain of one virtual currency\n[to the blockchain of another virtual currency, often in rapid succession. See DOJ Cryptocurrency Enforcement](https://www.justice.gov/archives/ag/page/file/1326061/download)\n[Framework, at 41-44.](https://www.justice.gov/archives/ag/page/file/1326061/download)\n9. Smurfing refers to a layering technique in money laundering that involves breaking total amounts of funds into\nsmaller amounts to move through multiple accounts before arriving at the ultimate beneficiary.\n10. P2P exchangers are individuals or entities offering to exchange fiat currencies for virtual currencies or one virtual\n\ncurrency for another virtual currency. P2P exchangers usually operate informally, typically advertising and marketing\ntheir services through online classified advertisements or fora social media and by word of mouth See FinCEN\n\n\n-----\n\nSome DFIR companies and CICs, as well as some MSBs that offer CVCs, facilitate ransomware\npayments to cybercriminals, often by directly receiving customers’ fiat funds, exchanging them for\nCVC, and then transferring the CVC to criminal-controlled accounts. Depending on the particular\nfacts and circumstances, this activity could constitute money transmission. Entities engaged in\nMSB activities (such as money transmission) are required to register as an MSB with FinCEN, and\nare subject to BSA obligations, including filing SARs.[11] FinCEN will not hesitate to take action\nagainst entities and individuals engaged in money transmission or other MSB activities if they fail\nto register with FinCEN or comply with their other AML obligations.\n\nPersons involved in ransomware payments must also be aware of any Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC)-related obligations that may arise from that activity.[12] On September 21, 2021,\nOFAC issued an updated advisory highlighting the sanctions risks associated with facilitating\nransomware payments on behalf of victims targeted by malicious cyber-enabled activities.[13]\nAdditionally, in October 2021, OFAC issued sanctions compliance guidance for the virtual currency\nindustry, which provides an overview of key items such as reporting instructions, consequences of\nnon-compliance, and compliance best practices.[14]\n\n## Trends and Typologies of Ransomware and Associated Payments\n\nThe severity and sophistication of ransomware attacks continue to rise[15] across various sectors,\nparticularly across governmental entities, and financial, educational, and healthcare institutions.[16]\nRansomware attacks on small municipalities and healthcare organizations have increased, likely\ndue to the victims’ weaker cybersecurity controls, such as inadequate system backups and\nineffective incident response capabilities.[17]\n\nCybercriminals using ransomware often resort to common tactics, such as wide-scale phishing\nand targeted spear-phishing campaigns that induce victims to download a malicious file or go to a\nmalicious site, exploit remote desktop protocol endpoints and software vulnerabilities, or deploy\n“drive-by” malware attacks that host malicious code on legitimate websites. Proactive prevention\nthrough effective cyber hygiene, cybersecurity controls, and business continuity resiliency is\noften the best defense against ransomware.[18] On July 15, 2021, the U.S. government announced\n\n11. _See generally 31 CFR Part 1022; and 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)._\n12. _[See OFAC, “Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry,” (Oct. 15, 2021);](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/virtual_currency_guidance_brochure.pdf)_\n\n[FinCEN Ransomware Report 2021, at 13 (Oct. 15, 2021); and White House, FACT SHEET: Ongoing Public U.S. Efforts](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/Financial Trend Analysis_Ransomware 508 FINAL.pdf)\n[to Counter Ransomware, (Oct. 13, 2021).](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/13/fact-sheet-ongoing-public-u-s-efforts-to-counter-ransomware/)\n13. _[See OFAC, “Updated Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risks for Facilitating Ransomware Payments,” (Sept. 21, 2021).](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf)_\n14. _[See OFAC, “Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry,” (Oct. 15, 2021).](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/virtual_currency_guidance_brochure.pdf)_\n15. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received 20% more reports of\n\nransomware incidents in 2020 than in 2019, with a 225% increase in ransom demands, totaling $29 million in 2020\n[up from $9 million in 2019. See FBI IC3, 2020 Internet Crime Report, (2020). In the first six months of 2021, FinCEN](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf)\nidentified $590 million in ransomware-related SARs, a 42 percent increase, compared to 2020’s total of $416 million.\n_See_ [FinCEN 2021 Ransomware Report, at 3 (Oct. 15, 2021).](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/Financial Trend Analysis_Ransomeware 508 FINAL.pdf)\n16. _[See FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2019-A005, “Advisory on Cybercrime and Cyber-Enabled Crime Exploiting the](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/advisory/2020-07-30/FinCEN Advisory Covid Cybercrime 508 FINAL.pdf)_\n\n[Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,” (July 30, 2020).](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/advisory/2020-07-30/FinCEN Advisory Covid Cybercrime 508 FINAL.pdf)\n17. _See_ [FinCEN 2021 Ransomware Report, at 3 (Oct. 15, 2021).

The DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), together with federal partners,\nlaunched a new website to combat the threat of ransomware.[19] StopRansomware.gov establishes a\none-stop hub for ransomware resources for individuals, businesses, and other organizations. This\nnew hub is a collaborative effort across the federal government and is the first joint website created\nto help private and public organizations mitigate their ransomware risk.[20]\n\n**_Extortion Schemes: Cybercriminals are increasingly engaging in “double extortion schemes,”_**\nwhich involve removing sensitive data from the targeted networks and encrypting the system\nfiles and demanding ransom.[21] The cybercriminals then threaten to publish or sell the stolen data\nif the victim does not pay the ransom. Other extortion schemes have also emerged whereby the\ncybercriminals use the system breach to target additional parties related to the initial victim, such\nas the victim’s business partners and customers, in an attempt to identify follow-on targets.[22] These\nthird parties may provide new leverage for the attacker to use against the victim.\n\n**_Use of Anonymity-Enhanced Cryptocurrencies (AECs): Cybercriminals usually require_**\nransomware payments to be denominated in CVCs, most commonly in Bitcoin. However, they are\nalso increasingly requiring or incentivizing victims to pay in AECs that reduce the transparency\nof CVC financial flows, through anonymizing features, such as mixing and cryptographic\nenhancements.[23] Cybercriminals have even offered discounted rates to victims who pay their\nransoms in AECs. One such AEC increasingly demanded by ransomware criminals is Monero.\n\n**_Unregistered CVC Mixing Services: In order to protect their illicit gains, cybercriminals often use_**\nmixers to obfuscate their illicit activities.[24] Mixers aim to “break” the connection between the\nsender and the receiver of the CVC transaction by commingling CVC belonging to other mixer\nusers and splitting the value into many small pieces that pass through a number of different\nintermediary accounts. The result is that cybercriminals trade CVC directly associated with any\none particular crime for other CVC of equal value originating from alternative sources. Mixers\ninclude both anonymizing service providers, and anonymizing software providers.\n\n**_Cashing Out Through Foreign CVC Exchanges: In order to launder and cash out their illicit proceeds,_**\ncybercriminals often use CVC exchanges that have lax compliance controls or that operate in\njurisdictions with little regulatory oversight. These exchanges often operate in high-risk jurisdictions\nor in jurisdictions that do not maintain effective information sharing agreements with other\ncountries. Cybercriminals and their affiliates may use these exchanges to facilitate conversion of the\n“dirty” CVC to their preferred legal tender or fiat currency to integrate back into the financial system.\n\n19. _[See DOJ Press Release, “U.S. Government Launches First One-Stop Ransomware Resource at StopRansomware.gov,”](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-launches-first-one-stop-ransomware-resource-stopransomwaregov)_\n\n(July 15, 2021).\n20. _[See CISA, https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware - StopRansomware.gov is the U.S. Government’s official one-stop](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware)_\n\nlocation for resources to tackle ransomware more effectively.\n21. _[See FinCEN 2021 Ransomware Report, at 3 (Oct. 15, 2021).](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/Financial Trend Analysis_Ransomeware 508 FINAL.pdf)_\n22. _[See FBI and DHS CISA, “Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: Ransomware Awareness for Holidays and Weekends,”](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-243A-Ransomware_Awareness_for_Holidays_and_Weekends.pdf)_\n\n(Aug. 31, 2021).\n23. _[See FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2019-A003, “Advisory on Illicit Activity Involving Convertible Virtual Currency,”](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/advisory/2019-05-10/FinCEN Advisory CVC FINAL 508.pdf)_\n\n(May 9 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Ransomware Criminals Forming Partnerships and Sharing Resources: Many cybercriminals_**\nengage in profit sharing through ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), a business model in which\nransomware developers sell or otherwise deliver ransomware software to individuals or groups\nthat have separately gained illicit access to the victim network. RaaS allows cybercriminals\nof varying skill levels to monetize their illicit access by infecting computer networks with\nransomware. As part of the profit sharing arrangement, the RaaS developer often receives a\npercentage of any ransom paid by the victim. A recent example of this model is the DarkSide\nransomware, which cybercriminals deployed against Colonial Pipeline in early 2021.[25]\n\n**_Use of “Fileless” Ransomware: Fileless ransomware is a sophisticated tool that can be challenging to_**\ndetect because the malicious code is written to a computer’s memory rather than into a file on a hard\ndrive, which allows cybercriminals to circumvent off-the-shelf antivirus and malware defenses.[26]\n\n**_“Big Game Hunting” Schemes: Cybercriminals are increasingly engaging in selective targeting_**\nof larger enterprises to demand bigger payouts – commonly referred to as “big game hunting.”[27]\nCybercriminals may target organizations with weaker security controls and a higher propensity to\npay the ransom due to the criticality of their services.\n\n## Recent Examples of Ransomware Attacks\n\nIn 2021, there have been some noteworthy ransomware attacks against critical U.S. infrastructure\nconducted by cybercriminal groups:\n\n- As noted above, in May 2021, a cybercriminal group perpetrated an attack that disrupted\n\nColonial Pipeline causing widespread U.S. gasoline shortages. The FBI subsequently attributed\nthe attack to a Russian-speaking group known as DarkSide.[28] DarkSide developed ransomware\nfor a criminal organization that then perpetrated the attack. This other criminal organization\ntransferred a portion of the ransom proceeds to DarkSide as payment for the development of\nthe ransomware. (As discussed earlier in this advisory, the development of ransomware as a\nservice is known as RaaS.) The FBI successfully seized criminal proceeds from a bitcoin wallet\nthat DarkSide ransomware actors used to collect a ransom payment from a victim.[29]\n\n- Also in May 2021, a cybercriminal group conducted a ransomware attack of JBS Meat Packing\n\nCorporation, causing a shutdown to their entire production process. The FBI attributed this\nattack to Sodinokibi/REvil.[30]\n\n25. _[See DOJ Press Release, “DAG Monaco Delivers Remarks at Press Conference on Darkside Attack on Colonial](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/dag-monaco-delivers-remarks-press-conference-darkside-attack-colonial-pipeline)_\n\n[Pipeline,” (June 7, 2021).](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/dag-monaco-delivers-remarks-press-conference-darkside-attack-colonial-pipeline)\n26. The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) observed a 153% increase of reported instances\n\nof ransomware targeting state, local, tribal, and territorial governments from 2018 to 2019. See MS-ISAC,\n[Security Primer – Ransomware, (May 2020).](https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/security-primer-ransomware/)\n27. _[See FBI Public Service Announcement, Alert No. I-100219-PSA, “High-Impact Ransomware Attacks Threaten U.S.](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2019/PSA191002)_\n\n[Businesses and Organizations,” (Oct. 2, 2019).](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2019/PSA191002)\n28. _[See FBI, Press Conference Regarding the Ransomware Attack on Colonial Pipeline, (June 7, 2021).](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-deputy-director-paul-m-abbates-remarks-at-press-conference-regarding-the-ransomware-attack-on-colonial-pipeline)_\n29. _See id._\n\n\n-----\n\n- In July 2021, Sodinokibi/REvil attacked Kaseya, a U.S.-based critical infrastructure entity in\n\nthe IT Sector and implementations of their remote monitoring and management tool, affecting\nhundreds of organizations—including multiple managed service providers and their customers.[31]\n\nFinCEN’s review of BSA data has identified DarkSide and Sodinokibi/REvil as among the most\ncostly ransomware variants in the first six months of 2021. During this timeframe, 458 ransomware\nrelated transactions were reported with a total value of $590 million.[32]\n\n## Financial Red Flag Indicators of Ransomware and\n\n Associated Payments\n\nFinCEN has identified the following financial red flag indicators of ransomware-related illicit\nactivity to assist financial institutions in detecting, preventing, and reporting suspicious\ntransactions associated with ransomware attacks. As no single financial red flag indicator is\nindicative of illicit or suspicious activity, financial institutions should consider the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each transaction, in keeping with their risk-based approach to compliance.[33]\n\nA financial institution or its customer detects IT enterprise activity that is connected to\n\nransomware cyber indicators or known cyber threat actors. Malicious cyber activity may be\nevident in system log files, network traffic, or file information.[34]\n\nWhen opening a new account or during other interactions with the financial institution, a\n\ncustomer provides information that a payment is in response to a ransomware incident.\n\nA customer’s CVC address, or an address with which a customer conducts transactions is\n\nconnected to ransomware variants,[35] payments, or related activity. These connections may\nappear in open sources or commercial or government analyses.\n\nAn irregular transaction occurs between an organization, especially an organization from\n\na sector at high risk for targeting by ransomware (e.g., government, financial, educational,\nhealthcare) and a DFIR or CIC, especially one known to facilitate ransomware payments.\n\n31. _[See FBI and CISA, “Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: Ransomware Awareness for Holidays and Weekends,”](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-243A-Ransomware_Awareness_for_Holidays_and_Weekends.pdf)_\n\n(August 31, 2021).\n32. _[See FinCEN, FinCEN 2021 Report, at 3 (Oct. 15, 2021).](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/Financial Trend Analysis_Ransomeware 508 FINAL.pdf)_\n[33.

Ransomware actors develop their own versions of ransomware, known as “variants.” For more information,\n\n\n-----\n\nA DFIR or CIC customer receives funds from a counterparty and shortly after receipt of funds\nsends equivalent amounts to a CVC exchange.\n\nA customer shows limited knowledge of CVC during onboarding or via other interactions\n\nwith the financial institution, yet inquires about or purchases CVC (particularly if in a large\namount or rush requests), which may indicate the customer is a victim of ransomware.\n\nA customer that has no or limited history of CVC transactions sends a large CVC transaction,\n\nparticularly when outside a company’s normal business practices.\n\nA customer that has not identified itself to the CVC exchanger, or registered with FinCEN as\n\na money transmitter, appears to be using the liquidity provided by the exchange to execute\nlarge numbers of offsetting transactions between various CVCs, which may indicate that the\ncustomer is acting as an unregistered MSB.\n\nA customer uses a foreign-located CVC exchanger in a high-risk jurisdiction lacking, or\n\nknown to have inadequate, AML/CFT regulations for CVC entities.\n\nA customer receives CVC from an external wallet, and immediately initiates multiple, rapid\n\ntrades among multiple CVCs, especially AECs, with no apparent related purpose, followed by\na transaction off the platform. This may be indicative of attempts to break the chain of custody\non the respective blockchains or further obfuscate the transaction.\n\nA customer initiates a transfer of funds involving a mixing service.\n\nA customer uses an encrypted network (e.g., the onion router) or an unidentified web portal\n\nto communicate with the recipient of the CVC transaction.\n\n\n## Reminder of Regulatory Obligations for U.S. Financial Institutions Regarding Suspicious Activity Reporting Involving Ransomware and\n USA PATRIOT ACT Section 314(b) Information Sharing Authority\n\n\n### Suspicious Activity Reporting\n\nFinancial institutions play an important role in protecting the U.S. financial system from\nransomware threats through compliance with their BSA obligations. Financial institutions should\ndetermine if filing a SAR is required or appropriate when dealing with an incident of ransomware\nconducted by, at, or through the financial institution, including ransom payments made by financial\ninstitutions that are victims of ransomware. As a reminder, a financial institution is required to file\na SAR if it knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect a transaction conducted or attempted by, at,\n\n\n-----\n\nor through the financial institution involves or aggregates to $5,000 (or, with one exception, $2,000\nfor MSBs)[36] or more in funds or other assets and involves funds derived from illegal activity,\nor attempts to disguise funds derived from illegal activity; is designed to evade regulations\npromulgated under the BSA; lacks a business or apparent lawful purpose; or involves the use of\nthe financial institution to facilitate criminal activity. Reportable activity can involve transactions,\nincluding payments made by financial institutions, related to criminal activity like extortion and\nunauthorized electronic intrusions that damage, disable, or otherwise affect critical systems. SAR\nobligations apply to both attempted and successful transactions, including both attempted and\nsuccessful initiated extortion transactions.[37]\n\nFinancial institutions are required to file complete and accurate reports that incorporate all relevant\n_information available, including cyber-related information. When filing a SAR regarding suspicious_\ntransactions that involve cyber events (including ransomware), financial institutions should\nprovide all pertinent available information on the event and associated with the suspicious activity,\nincluding cyber-related information and technical indicators, in the SAR form and narrative. When\nfiling is not required, institutions may file a SAR voluntarily to aid law enforcement in protecting\nthe financial sector. Valuable cyber indicators for law enforcement investigations for ransomware\ncan include relevant email addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses with their respective\ntimestamps, login information with location and timestamps, CVC wallet addresses, mobile device\ninformation (such as device International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers), malware\nhashes, malicious domains, and descriptions and timing of suspicious electronic communications.\n\nWhen a financial institution files a SAR, it is required to maintain a copy of the SAR and the\noriginal or business record equivalent of any supporting documentation for a period of five years\nfrom the date of filing the SAR.[38] Financial institutions must provide any requested SAR and all\ndocumentation supporting the filing of a SAR upon request by FinCEN or an appropriate law\nenforcement or supervisory agency.[39] When requested to provide supporting documentation,\nfinancial institutions should take special care to verify that a requestor of information is, in\nfact, a representative of FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or supervisory agency. A\nfinancial institution should incorporate procedures for such verification into its BSA compliance\nor anti-money laundering program. These procedures may include, for example, independent\nemployment verification with the requestor’s field office or face-to-face review of the\nrequestor’s credentials.[40]\n\n\n36. _See 31 CFR §§ 1020.320, 1021.320, 1022.320, 1023.320, 1024.320, 1025.320, 1026.320, 1029.320, and 1030.20. The_\n\nmonetary threshold for filing money services businesses SARs is, with one exception, set at or above $2,000. See also\n31 CFR § 1022.320(a)(2).\n37. FinCEN assesses that ransomware-related activity is under-reported.\n38. _See 31 CFR §§ 1020.320(d), 1021.320(d), 1022.320(c), 1023.320(d), 1024.320(c), 1025.320(d), and 1026.320(d)._\n39. _[Id. See also FinCEN Guidance, FIN-2007-G003, “Suspicious Activity Report Supporting Documentation,”](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance/suspicious-activity-report-supporting-documentation)_\n\n(June 13 2007)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Ransomware Payments Require Immediate Attention\n\nIt is critical that financial institutions (including CVC exchanges) identify and immediately\nreport any suspicious transactions associated with ransomware attacks. For purposes of meeting\na financial institution’s SAR obligations, FinCEN and law enforcement consider suspicious\ntransactions involving ransomware attacks to constitute “situations involving violations that\nrequire immediate attention.”[41] Financial institutions wanting to report suspicious transactions\nrelated to recent or ongoing ransomware attacks should contact FinCEN’s Financial Institution\nHotline at 1-866-556-3974. Financial institutions must subsequently file a SAR using FinCEN’s\nBSA E-filing System, providing as much of the relevant details around the activity as available at\nthat time. Amended SARs should be filed to include additional information related to the same\nactivity that is learned later; completely new activity should be filed in a new “initial” SAR filing.\n\n### SAR Filing Instructions\n\nFinCEN requests that financial institutions reference this advisory by including the key term:\n\n### “CYBER-FIN-2021-A004”\n\n**In SAR field 2 (Filing Institution Note to FinCEN) and the narrative to indicate a connection**\n**between the suspicious activity being reported and ransomware-related activity.**\n\n**Financial institutions should also select SAR field 42 (Cyber event) as the associated suspicious**\n**activity type, as well as select SAR field 42z (Cyber event - Other) while including “ransomware”**\n**as keywords in SAR field 42z, to indicate a connection between the suspicious activity being**\nreported and possible ransomware activity. Additionally, financial institutions should include any\n**relevant technical cyber indicators related to the ransomware activity and associated transactions**\n**within the available structured cyber event indicator SAR fields 44(a)-(j), (z).**\n\n### Information Sharing\n\nInformation sharing among financial institutions is critical to identifying, reporting, and\npreventing evolving ransomware schemes. Financial institutions sharing information under\nthe safe harbor authorized by section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act are reminded that they\nmay share information relating to transactions that the institution suspects may involve the\nproceeds of one or more specified unlawful activities (“SUAs”) and such an institution will still\nremain protected from civil liability under the section 314(b) safe harbor. The SUAs listed in 18\nU.S.C. §§ 1956 and 1957 include an array of fraudulent and other criminal activities, including\nextortion and computer fraud and abuse. FinCEN strongly encourages information sharing\nvia section 314(b) where financial institutions suspect that a transaction may involve terrorist\nfinancing or money laundering, including one or more SUAs.[42]\n\n\n41. _See e.g., 31 CFR § 1020.320(b)(3) (Banks), 31 CFR § 1022.320(b)(3) (Money Services Businesses), and 31 CFR §_\n\n1025 320(b)(3) (Insurance Companies)\n\n\n-----\n\n### For Further Information\n\nQuestions or comments regarding the contents of this advisory to the FinCEN Regulatory Support\n[Section at frc@fincen.gov.](mailto:frc%40fincen.gov?subject=)\n\n\n**The mission of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is to safeguard**\n**the financial system from illicit use, combat money laundering and its**\n**related crimes including terrorism, and promote national security through**\n**the strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and**\n**dissemination of financial intelligence.**\n\n\n-----",
