[Sandworm is known to be a Russian](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-russia-ukraine-blackout-gru/)\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) group affiliated with The Main Directorate of the General\nStaff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU). In this research, we present\nhow to manually “unpack” a sample from a recent campaign. Unpacking means reaching the\nfinal stage of the malware, which contains its main functionality. We also share some threathunting signatures and indicators of compromise which can be utilized in defense and\ntracking efforts.\n\n## About Colibri\n\nColibriLoader is a Malware-as-a-Service family, first advertised on XSS.is cybercrime forum\nin August 2021 to \"people who have large volumes of traffic and lack of time to work out the\nmaterial\" (Fig. 1). For $150/week or $400/month, it offers a small, unpacked, obfuscated\nloader written in C and assembly, along with a control panel written in PHP. As its name\nsuggests, it’s meant to deliver and manage payloads onto infected computers. Moreover, the\n\n\n-----\n\n[malware ignores systems from Commonwealth of Independent States countries (Armenian,](https://fr3d.hk/blog/colibri-loader-back-to-basics)\nAzerbaijani, Belarusian, Hungarian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Romanian, Russian, Tajik, Turkmen,\nUzbek).\n\n[Fig. 1 - Post on XSS.is cybercrime forum by user “c0d3r_0f_shr0d13ng3r”](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2022-0919.pdf)\n\n## PrivateLoader distributing Packed Colibri\n\n[PrivateLoader is a loader from a pay-per-install malware distribution service that has been](https://www.bitsight.com/blog/tracking-privateloader-malware-distribution-service)\nutilized to distribute info stealers, banking trojans, loaders, spambots, rats, miners and\nransomware on Windows machines. While monitoring PrivateLoader malware distribution\n[activity, we spotted ColibriLoader being distributed between July and October. Many security](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/signature/ColibriLoader/)\nproducts automatically classified these samples and we noticed that all of them have the tag\n_[“Build1”, which may represent the botnet or campaign id. Contradicting the author's](https://tria.ge/s?q=botnet%3Abuild1)_\nadvertisements, we noticed some indicators suggesting that the samples are packed, such\nas their size, which should be around 20KB, and the fact that it contains only two sections,\nthe .text and .reloc, which was not the case.\n\nIn order to evade antivirus security products and frustrate malware reverse engineering,\nmalware operators leverage encryption and compression via executable packing to protect\ntheir malicious code. Malware packers are software programs that either encrypt or\ncompress the original binary, making it unreadable until it’s placed in memory. In general,\nmalware packers consist of two components, a packed buffer, the actual malicious code, and\nan unpacking stub responsible for unpacking and executing the packed buffer. Threat Actors\nmake use of packers when distributing their malware as they remain an effective way to\nevade detection and make the malware harder to analyze. Manual analysis can defeat these\nprotections and help develop tools that aid in this costly task.\n\n## Unpacking ColibriLoader\n\n\n-----\n\nLet s have a look at a [sample dropped by PrivateLoader on September 4, 2022. First, we](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/6c179c2b5cda41d940a552f19def20711f7389d3188d7646c45b7963f2049667/)\ntried to use [unpac.me service to try to unpack it automatically but we were unlucky. So, let’s](https://www.unpac.me/results/dbc2e107-983e-420e-a2b9-35e16bfd6da0/#/)\ndive deep into this sample.\n\n### Resolving the Windows API\n\nOpening it on IDA Pro, on the main function (Fig. 3), we can see a pattern that seems to be a\nway of dynamically resolving some Windows API functions, which are usually crucial to\nunderstand the code behavior quickly. The malware walks the process environment block\n(PEB), looking for the in-memory loaded modules base addresses on the current process,\nfinds the functions exported by each, hashes them, and compares it with the hash of\nLoadLibrary. Then, it calls LoadLibraryA to load kernel32.dll to get a module handle for it, but\ndoes not actually load it since it is already loaded by default, and then searches for the target\n[export function (a more detailed explanation can be found here). By searching on Google for](https://cocomelonc.github.io/tutorial/2022/04/02/malware-injection-18.html)\nthe constants in the code that generates the hash, we confirmed the hashing algorithm in\nuse is [Fowler–Noll–Vo.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function)\n\nFig. 3 - Example of Windows API resolution.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Encrypted Shellcode and Executable\n\nLooking a bit further through the code, we can spot what seems to be an XOR decryption of\n520 bytes of shellcode at 0x454708, where the key is “2760”, and also the change in the\nprotection of that region (VirtualProtect) to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40), as well\nas four calls of a function within that region (Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 4 - Shellcode decryption.\nWe can confirm it by disassembling the shellcode function at 0x4547A8 after running it on\nx32dbg (Fig. 5)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 5 - Decrypted shellcode #1 function at 0x4547A8.\nThis function allocates memory on the heap and copies some data to it. The size of the\nregion to be allocated is on the second argument. Going back to the main code, there’s XOR\ndecryption done on each piece of data, and subsequently a call to VirtualProtect to enable\nexecution of the newly decrypted shellcode (Fig. 6). Their arguments are what seems to be a\nfile path, a pointer to an executable, what seems to be an XOR key, and probably the size of\nthe executable (0x12C00 bytes, or 76.8KB)\n\nFig. 6 - Decrypted executable at 0x78ECA80.\nAfter saving to file that executable and sending it to VirusTotal, we can see that it was\n[already uploaded. Again, no luck on unpacking it with unpac.me. Entering the last decrypted](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2b00d8c2bcc6b48e90524cdd41a07735dc94548ed41925baff86e43a61a4c37f)\nshellcode, it seems to dynamically resolve some Windows API functions by passing a hash\n\n\n-----\n\nand then it creates a file at C:\\ProgramData\\conhost.exe (Fig. 7).\n\nFig. 7 - Decrypted shellcode #2.\nAfter running it, a file was indeed dropped at the expected location, which turns out to be the\nsame file we manually dumped. VirusTotal shows [173 executables dropping this file, most](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2b00d8c2bcc6b48e90524cdd41a07735dc94548ed41925baff86e43a61a4c37f/relations)\nwith compilation and first-seen timestamps from September 2022.\n\nLet's have a look at the dropped file. Opening again on IDA Pro, looking at the main function,\nit seems very similar to the previous stage, almost a copy, with some minor changes. In the\nend, we can quickly spot the same pattern of resolving VirtualProtect, calling it, and then\ncalling the decrypted shellcode, just as seen before. After running on x32dbg with a\nbreakpoint at that last call, we can see as before that the pointer to the newly decrypted\nexecutable is the second argument (Fig. 8). However, this time the size is not being passed\nas an argument, but we can get it from other places, such as the call to a function that\ndecrypts the executable, where the size to be decrypted is passed on the first argument.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 8 - Decrypted executable at 0x7DCC838.\nGoing back, by putting a breakpoint on the call to decrypt the executable, we can see that\nthe size is 0x5000 bytes (or 20KB). We can now extract the executable from memory and\nhave a look at it. The file seems to be a valid executable with only two sections, .text and\n_.reloc. There’s sufficient evidence to conclude that we have successfully unpacked the_\nColibriLoader.\n\nAt the time of this research, this last stage was not yet on VirusTotal. Later, we found a\n[quicker way of unpacking the malware. We used this script to extract executables from](https://r136a1.info/2022/05/25/introduction-of-a-pe-file-extractor-for-various-situations/)\nmemory dumps (from a sandbox run for example) and then the YARA rule we share below\nwas used to find the Colibri sample.\n\n## Deobfuscating ColibriLoader\n\nFinally, let’s have a very quick look at the actual malware. The first anti-analysis trick we\nencounter is called opaque predicates (Fig. 9); It’s a commonly used technique in program\nobfuscation, intended to add complexity to the control flow. There are many patterns of this\ntechnique but in this case, the malware author simply takes an absolute jump (JMP) and\ntransforms it into two conditional jumps, jump if zero (JZ) and jump if not zero (JNZ).\nDepending on the value of the Zero flag (ZF), the execution will follow the first or second\nbranch. However, disassemblers are tricked into thinking that there is a fall-through branch if\nthe second jump is not taken (which is impossible as one of them must be taken) and try to\ndisassemble the unreachable instructions (often invalid) resulting in garbage code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 9 - Example of ColibriLoader opaque predicates anti-analysis technique.\nIn order for IDA Pro to load it properly, we need to patch the first conditional jump to an\nabsolute jump and NOP out the second jump (Fig. 10). We’ve automated this task using\n[myrtus0x0’s code since SmokeLoader also uses this technique.](https://github.com/myrtus0x0/smoke_conf_extract/blob/8629f13b083242e59279dc9c2d15e869ab84615e/main.py#L121)\n\nFig. 10 - Patched ColibriLoader.\nThe last analysis we did was trying to extract the strings the malware uses, which will contain\nindicators of compromise, such as command and control servers. After looking a bit through\nthe code, it wasn’t hard to find the string decryption function at 0x40594B since there are 71\ncross-references for it so it’s probably the most used function (Fig 11 and 12)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 11 - Example call to the string decryption function.\n\nFig. 12 - String decryption loop from function at 0x40594B.\nThis code seems straightforward enough. Strings are encrypted with an XOR key passed as\nan argument to the function. Yet, we didn’t need to script this out because we’ve found a\n[working IDA script from Casperinous. Here are the results:](https://github.com/Casperinous/colibri_loader/blob/main/colibri_decrypt_str.py)\n\n0x401faf %s\\\\%s\n\n0x401fd4 \\\\Microsoft\\\\WindowsApps\n\n0x401ffa Get-Variable.exe\n\n0x402020 powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden\n\n0x402046 %s:Zone.Identifier\n\n0x40229c %s\\\\%s\n\n0x4022c1 \\\\WindowsPowerShell\n\n0x4022e7 dllhost.exe\n\n0x40230d %s:Zone.Identifier\n\n0x402579 %s\\\\%s\n\n0x40259e \\\\Microsoft\\\\WindowsApps\n\n0x4025c4 Get-Variable.exe\n\n0x402706 %s\\\\%s\n\n0x40272b \\\\WindowsPowerShell\n\n0x402751 dllhost.exe\n\n0x4028e5 %s:Zone.Identifier\n\n0x402999 runas\n0x4029bf cmd.exe\n\n0x4029e5 /c %s%s%s %s\n\n\n-----\n\n0x402b49 %s\\\\rundll32.exe %s,%s\n0x402c4e %s /s\n\n0x402c74 runas\n\n0x402ca8 %s\\\\System32\\\\regsrv32.exe\n\n0x402cff %s\\\\SysWOW64\\\\regsrv32.exe\n\n0x402e48 /c %s%s%s %s\n\n0x402e6e cmd.exe\n\n0x402e94 open\n\n0x403041 %s%s\n\n0x403612 6rmUi1hRdfbV0QyXqAoT\n\n0x4037c0 /c chcp 65001 && ping 127.0.0.1 && DEL /F /S /Q /A %s%s%s\n\n0x4037e5 cmd.exe\n\n0x4038db Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\n\n0x403903 ProductName\n\n0x4039cc Unknown\n\n0x403c07 %08lX%04lX%lu\n\n0x403c81 /create /tn COMSurrogate /st 00:00 /du 9999:59 /sc once /ri 1 /f /tr\n\n0x403ca7 %s\\\\schtasks.exe\n\n0x403e4b %s\\\\schtasks.exe\n\n0x403e71 /delete /tn COMSurrogate /f\n\n0x404058 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n0x404488 zpltcmgodhvvedxtfcygvbgjkvgvcguygytfigj.cc\n\n0x4044ad yugyuvyugguitgyuigtfyutdtoghghbbgyv.cx\n\n0x404582 /gate.php\n\n0x4045a8 hf9qkeO66MP7WJXkg9rp\n\n0x4045ce 2OrnJZG6Wtbzd4bKJoS0\n\n0x4045f4 %s?type=%s&uid=%s\n\n0x40461a check\n\n0x404640 GET\n\n0x404666 HTTP/1.1\n\n0x40489d 1.2.0\n\n0x4048c3 Build1\n\n0x4048e9 /gate.php\n\n0x40490f hf9qkeO66MP7WJXkg9rp\n\n0x404934 2OrnJZG6Wtbzd4bKJoS0\n\n0x40495a %s?type=%s&uid=%s\n\n0x404980 update\n\n0x4049a6 POST\n\n0x4049cc HTTP/1.1\n\n0x4049f2 %s|%s|%s|%s|%s|%s|%s\n\n0x404a18 32bit\n\n0x404a3e 64bit\n\n\n-----\n\n0x404d9c Build1\n0x404dc3 /gate.php\n\n0x404dec hf9qkeO66MP7WJXkg9rp\n\n0x404e13 2OrnJZG6Wtbzd4bKJoS0\n\n0x404e3a %s?type=%s&uid=%s\n\n0x404e61 ping\n\n0x404e88 POST\n\n0x404eaf HTTP/1.1\n\n0x404ed6 %s|%s|%s|%s|%s|%s|%s\n\n0x4054d3 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n\nThese decrypted strings also allow us to further reverse the malware more quickly if we need\nto.\n\n## Wrap-up\n\nWe presented a way to manually unpack the ColibriLoader samples from a campaign linked\nto the threat actor [UAC-0113.
