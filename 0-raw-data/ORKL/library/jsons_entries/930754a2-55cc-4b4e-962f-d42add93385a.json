In more recent years, ransomware\n\n actors did not just rely on phishing emails to enter the targeted network, they have also\n\n leveraged unpatched servers as an initial means into the network.[4] Ransomware actors\n\n also obtain network admin credentials and exploit vulnerabilities for lateral movement,[5]\n\n aiming to encrypt servers that host critical data.\n\n Advanced cybersecurity technologies have made their way to corporate networks the world\n\n over to counter this nefarious threat. The application of machine learning technologies and\n\n behavior-based blocking in cybersecurity solutions have resulted in a dramatic reduction\n\n in the success rates of opportunistic ransomware attacks.[6] Additionally, modern disaster\n\n recovery and business continuity (DR/BC) processes are constantly improving, reducing\n\n recovery times and the need for companies to even consider paying ransom demands.[7]\n\n In our opinion, the wide adoption of these technological advances has reduced the success\n\n of old-style opportunistic ransomware attacks. However, it has also forced cybercriminals\n\n to evolve their strategies out of sheer necessity, paving the way for what we now call\n\n modern ransomware.\n\n Ransomware actors have learned to adapt and level up. Once they have identified the data\n\n that they would want to encrypt from a victim organization, they would often exfiltrate it\n\n out of the network instead of merely encrypting it. This strategy allows for a plan B: If the\n\n victim organization does not want to pay the ransom to recover their encrypted data, the\n\n attackers can threaten to publicize it. For modern enterprises, a data leak that involves\n\n intellectual property, proprietary information, employee personally identifiable information\n\n (PII), and customer data, comes with a significant price tag — not to mention regulatory\n\n penalties, lawsuits, and reputational damage.\n\n The most remarkable commonality of modern ransomware attacks is their focus on taking\n\n over networks in various human-supervised stages, and not click-on-the-link, automatically\n\n driven events. This makes a modern ransomware attack appear to resemble a plain hacking\n\n incident with a ransomware payload.\n\n The process of manually hacking a victim’s network can be time consuming, as it can take\n\n days or months to successfully pull off. This means that the attackers can already be in\n\n multiple places within the network before unleashing the ransomware payload. This lack\n\n of visibility alone can make defending networks and systems against ransomware attacks\n\n substantially more difficult. It can also be challenging for cybersecurity professionals to\n\n put together the separate traces of a modern ransomware attack and realize that it is\n\n happening. To make things even more difficult, these ransomware actors usually perform\n\n lateral movement with common admin tools that are more likely to fly under the radar. This\n\n helps add a sense of invisibility for these kinds of attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### To put all of these together, the modern ransomware strategy of employing targeted attacks\n\n as opposed to merely automated ones is geared toward targeted ransomware rather than\n\n infecting by the numbers or “spraying and praying.” Modern ransomware actors first look\n\n for a big target, then spend a significant amount of time conquering each section of the\n\n victim network until they are ready to set off the ransomware payload. In this respect, these\n\n attacks look more like nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks instead of\n\n traditional ransomware incidents.\n\n To better describe this new wave of ransomware, we present an in-depth case study of\n\n the Nefilim ransomware family. Nefilim has been known to target mainly multi-billion dollar\n\n companies, making for a great case study on the topic. We also show how enterprises\n\n can formulate a defense strategy that will help prevent and mitigate the effects of modern\n\n ransomware attacks within the corporate network. Cross-layered detection and response\n\n tools and technologies[8] allow threat analysts and incident response (IR) teams to uncover\n\n hard-to-spot threats.\n\n It is our opinion that there is a possible distinction between the cybercriminal groups that\n\n handle the different stages of these ransomware attacks. The actors who break into the\n\n network may not necessarily be the same ones who deploy the ransomware payload. This\n\n difference is the byproduct of a recent evolution in cybercriminal business operations:\n\n hackers, who previously just sold access to corporate networks, are now working with\n\n ransomware actors to monetize hacking-related breaches.[9] We explore this shift in\n\n cybercriminal business models in the next section.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Shifts in Criminal Business Models\n\n###### Ransomware has been around for several decades. The AIDS trojan, or PC Cyborg, of 1989 was the\n\n first-ever ransomware, albeit it having been a rudimentary attempt at encryption.[10] Since then, the tactics,\n\n techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that make up a typical ransomware attack — and consequently, the\n\n ransomware business model — has changed significantly, primarily to take advantage of new technologies\n\n that enhance the attackers’ capabilities.\n\n#### Payment\n\n###### The first technological advancement is related to the different financial instruments that actors use to\n\n receive payment from their victims. A decade ago, when mobile phones were first utilized as payment\n\n platforms, ransomware actors forced affected users to pay ransom by means of sending SMS to a\n\n premium rate number or adding money to an account that is linked to the phone number mentioned in\n\n the ransom note.\n\n An alternative payment system called electronic wallets, or e-wallets, soon triggered the next wave of\n\n ransomware. Ransomware attacks that utilized e-wallets for payouts asked for larger ransom amounts.[11]\n\n The major issues with these payment methods, however, were that they were either localized to a particular\n\n geographical region or were regulated by governments, at least in relation to cross-border transfers or the\n\n maximum volume of anonymized transactions. \n\n Next, and possibly the biggest development in the realm of ransomware payments, was the popularization\n\n of Bitcoin.[12] A general comprehension of Bitcoin shifted from it being an innovative technology into a\n\n currency with the capability of transferring money around the globe and bypassing regulations. By 2014,\n\n an estimated 80,000 merchants have started accepting Bitcoin as a valid form of payment, with current\n\n numbers being much higher.[13] The profitability and anonymity offered by Bitcoin were exactly what\n\n ransomware actors needed to bump up the number of ransomware incidents, the number of ransomware\n\n families, and ransom amounts.[14]\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Underground Communities and\n\n Communication Platforms\n\n###### The second technological factor is related to how underground actors collaborate with one another.\n\n Communications among underground actors are implemented using different platforms, including forums,\n\n messengers, and sometimes even social media platforms.[15] New security and anonymization features\n\n of these platforms improved these actors’ capability to covertly collaborate online.[16] The collaboration\n\n between botnet masters, other access brokers for compromised networks, and ransomware actors is one\n\n example of such developments.[17]\n\n#### Cybercriminal Partnerships and Outsourcing\n\n###### An example of cybercriminal collaboration came in the form of ransomware as a service (RaaS), which\n\n enabled actors to look for affiliates to carry out ransomware attacks. Instead of having just one ransomware\n\n group doing all of the work, several collaborators split roles and ransomware profits.[18] During this time, we\n\n saw a combination of actors who had access to compromised assets collaborate closely with actors who\n\n have developed ransomware. The evolution of these affiliate programs increased the involvement of more\n\n cybercriminals into the increasingly effective monetization of compromised assets, which is profitable for\n\n all parties involved. A clear sign of this deeper collaboration is visible in underground forums, wherein\n\n compromised assets are sold explicitly for encryption since the other monetization paths had already\n\n been utilized.[19]\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Data-Driven Victim Profiling and Pipelining\n\n###### 2010\n\n**Model 1**\nLocal and regional capabilities but actions at scale\n\nCollaboration Ransom Payments sent �100 - �1,000\namong bot payments sent via e-wallets\nmasters and via premium-rate and alternative\nransomware SMS numbers payment systems\nactors\n\nImpact is localized to ransom withdrawal capabilities\nwithin the region.

Number of victims is\nmoderate for targeted victims, large for mass victims.\n\n###### 2021\n\nRansomware actors make enough profit to target\n0-day vulnerabilities on high-profile targets\n\n###### Figure 1. Major shifts related to the evolution of ransomware business processes and monetization campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\n###### A different combination of items from the first two developments discussed earlier illustrates the evolution\n\n and the major shifts in different ransomware business models and their respective monetization methods.\n\n Model 1 is related to early monetization strategies, wherein actors were limited by localized payment\n\n methods. This model is outdated and rarely used compared with Models 2 and 3. Some underground\n\n actors still prefer Model 2, which provides moderate monetization from a large number of victims.\n\n Ransomware groups who make use of Model 2 do not perform deep victim profiling prior to initiating\n\n ransomware deployment. This approach has been used by actors for many years and normally pose a\n\n lower risk to victims in contrast with Model 3.\n\n Model 3 is related to more targeted monetization of victim assets and includes the deployment of several\n\n additional steps in the cybercriminal business process.\n\n The first signs of targeted monetization that we know of appeared almost a decade ago in Russia.\n\n Cybercriminals targeted and manually encrypted accounting software database servers using ransomware\n\n and other tools before asking victims to pay a ransom to recover sensitive financial data. Due to the\n\n limited technologies and payment methods available during that time, attacks were restricted in terms of\n\n both geography and scale. The screenshot in Figure 2, which was taken from a forum discussion that was\n\n initiated by a victim of this attack type, shows that attackers used phone-linked e-wallets to receive the\n\n ransom. The ransom amount was RUB10,000, which was about US$320 at the time.\n\n Figure 2. Example of a predecessor of the current APT-like ransomware monetization schemes using phone-linked\n\n e-wallets as a means of payment\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Vulnerability and Exploit Market\n\n###### Over the past few years, we have started seeing a clear shift toward targeted attacks or so-called APT-like\n\n ransomware monetization schemes. It is not just about searching for bigger payoffs; a targeted approach\n\n is needed due to the improved defensive capabilities of organizations. This means that the number of\n\n potential targets for opportunistic attacks is decreasing. The deployment of better recovery systems\n\n means that attackers need to seek out backups in order to prevent recovery.\n\n At the same time, cybercriminals are eager to adopt new technologies for their own profit. Several key\n\n factors have contributed to this shift toward a more targeted criminal monetization scheme, including:\n\n • The increased computing power of machines, which provides cybercriminals the ability to deeply\n\n automate processing and collect additional information about victims.[20]\n\n • The availability of public and private databases and automation tools that help perform precise\n\n categorization of victims based on their location, industry, company name, size, and revenue.\n\n • The capability to initiate anonymized high-volume cross-border money transfers using\n\n cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency mixers.\n\n • The extensive use of communication platforms that allow secure, interactive, and anonymized\n\n interactions and increased collaboration between various cybercriminal groups. \n\n These four factors allowed criminals to add several notable steps that improved their business processes.\n\n This shift enhanced the impact of the ransomware incidents as well as the risks associated with each\n\n attack, making defense and mitigation strategies more difficult for targeted organizations. The shift means\n\n deep victim profiling has been performed before an attack is initiated, followed by a collaboration among\n\n multiple groups who are sharing accesses and are using optimized monetization strategies. This shift\n\n can be compared to a shift from perimeter security to perimeterless security in the terms of impact and\n\n after-effects.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Asset takeover|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\nIf not If not\n\nEncrypt Extort on encryption Extort on data Expose data\n\n**Legends**\n\nRelated to a typical pre-modern ransomware process\n\nAuxiliary processes that are not directly related to ransomware monetization, but can be the\nstages that ransomware actors can go through prior to ransomware monetization\n\nModern ransomware-related monetization processes\n\nPrerequisites of modern criminal monetization processes\n\n###### Figure 3. Updates to the business process of ransomware monetization\n\n Figure 3 illustrates how the business process of ransomware monetization has progressed. During the\n\n earlier days of ransomware, when a victim asset or even an infrastructure was encrypted using automated\n\n tools, the ransom amount was either fixed or estimated by the attacker only after the victim initiated\n\n the negotiation. With today’s updated business process, the attacker knows a substantial amount of\n\n information about the victim. This often includes the organization’s name, the number of employees, its\n\n revenue, and the industry in which it belongs – allowing for a more tailored, victim-specific extortion\n\n ransom pricing.\n\n With more experience using the updated business process, attackers now have a much more accurate\n\n estimation of the range of possible ransom amounts for a specific victim. They are also more knowledgeable\n\n of the reasonable volume of resources that they can invest for each victim. The whole attack chain often\n\n involves two or more groups who are responsible for the different attack stages. Since it is normal for\n\n this market to have a ransom for big organizations in the seven-digit range, attackers may be able to\n\n afford zero-day local privilege escalation (LPE) and remote code execution (RCE) exploits. We have seen\n\n mentions of these capabilities in underground forum threads related to ransomware affiliate programs.\n\n|Encrypt|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n|Col1|If not|\n|---|---|\n|Extort on encryption|If no|\n|||\n\n|Col1|If not|\n|---|---|\n|Extort on data|If not|\n|||\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 4. Mention of the use of zero-day LPE and RCE exploits in ransomware operations\n\n Modern affiliate programs often involve collaboration between an actor who owns the ransomware and\n\n another actor who controls the compromised infrastructure and distributes malware over a network. The\n\n ransomware actors usually agree to a 20/80 or 30/70 split of the profit; the smaller cut goes to the group\n\n that provides the ransomware and negotiates with a victim while the majority of the profit goes to the\n\n group that handles network access and implements the active phase of the attack. Typically, the group\n\n that negotiates with a victim receives the full ransom amount and distributes the share to the participants\n\n responsible for the other attack stages. Most of the profits go to the affiliate actor responsible for obtaining\n\n network access and deploying the ransomware payload. Initial access to the victim infrastructure can be\n\n obtained by the same affiliate group, or that group can choose to sub-contract it and instead specialize\n\n on privilege escalation, lateral movement, and complete takeover of the victim infrastructure.\n\n The price for access varies greatly — it can range from tens of dollars for a random victim asset, to several\n\n hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a categorized asset; access to the infrastructure of a large\n\n organization can cost five to six figures.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### It should be noted, that by its very nature, a ransomware attack will eventually be very visible to the\n\n infrastructure owner once it is deployed. Therefore, several actors often implement other monetization\n\n paths prior to the ransomware deployment to make the overall intrusion as profitable as possible.[21] Because\n\n of this — and the fact that multiple cybercriminal groups often operate together sharing accesses, and\n\n following parallel monetization lifecycles — infrastructure owners can often see a crossover in attacker\n\n kill chains. This can be very confusing for defenders who may not be aware that they are looking at traces\n\n coming from several groups, which can be related to many parallel — and even unrelated — incidents.\n\n A situation with a crossover in kill chains can make attacker attribution based on TTPs alone extremely\n\n difficult. Due to this, it is important to understand criminal business models clearly, and attribute TTPs to\n\n separate simultaneous attacks or a single attack performed with close collaboration between actors who\n\n share access and join forces.\n\n The increased visibility of the ransomware component invariably attracts more attention from the victim or\n\n law enforcement. However, it is important to understand the bigger picture — it is the affiliate groups who\n\n profit the most from this arrangement and who enable these compromises in the first place. Yet, these\n\n same groups are rarely investigated as meticulously as their ransomware partners, therefore helping this\n\n overall trend persist.\n\n Defenders also need to note that when multiple cybercrime groups unite, they have experts working\n\n on the different attack stages or monetization paths of a targeted ransomware attack. The complexity\n\n of defending against sophisticated attacks can be greater compared to defending against traditional\n\n targeted attacks or APT groups. It may be comparable to an organization defending against the attacks\n\n of a penetration tester who is armed with seemingly unlimited capabilities.\n\n For defenders, the prevalence of these sophisticated ransomware attacks means a shorter reaction time\n\n and a much higher potential impact. For threat hunting, incident mitigations, and attack investigations, it\n\n is critical to have XDR solutions that offer complete and central visibility over every critical component,\n\n whether it be an organization’s endpoints, network, the cloud, or other devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Modern Ransomware Case Study: Nefilim\n\n###### The previous sections described a shift in the ransomware business model and how this fundamental\n\n change has reshaped the whole ransomware attack plan. The next sections will illustrate this with a case\n\n study.\n\n Nefilim is one of the less-studied ransomware families and it will be used as an example of a modern\n\n ransomware attack here. This section will describe Nefilim’s entry points to the corporate network and its\n\n general method for lateral movement. It will then show how the attackers trigger the ransomware payload\n\n once they firmly establish their foothold in the network and after they determine the most valuable data.\n\n Finally and most importantly, the case study will provide a defensive strategy to make an attack’s various\n\n pieces become visible to defenders. This defensive strategy is not Nefilim-specific; it can be applied to\n\n the ransomware business model in general. This procedure will involve software that can put together\n\n each of the attacker’s separate and often disparate pieces and correlate them as being part of a single\n\n concerted attack.\n\n We begin with how we think Nefilim first came to be. Based on our observations on Nefilim attacks to date,\n\n our hypothesis is that Nefilim is a RaaS operation whose business model closely resembles that of Nemty,\n\n another RaaS operation first spotted in August 2019.[22] We have tracked the actors behind both malware\n\n families under the intrusion set we track as “Water Roc.” The Nefilim code seen in earlier versions is very\n\n similar to that of the Nemty ransomware. Interestingly, around the same time, two actors associated with\n\n Nemty (Jingo and jsworm) were seen actively recruiting affiliates. Both actors were advertising a 70/30\n\n profit split, offering 70% to affiliates responsible for access and deployment and Nemty developers taking\n\n the remaining 30% of the profits. A volume discount for affiliates who can regularly supply high-quality\n\n victims was also advertised, increasing profit margins for affiliates to 90/10.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 5. Actor jsworm mentioned the Nemty business model’s 70/30 profit split in a forum\n\n This profit model also means that initial access can vary based on the methods that the specific affiliate\n\n used before deploying the core Nefilim group’s ransomware payload.\n\n In March 2020, the actor jsworm discussed a new unnamed project that is believed to have been Nefilim.\n\n The first version of Nefilim was spotted in the wild (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.A)\n\n around that time.[23]\n\n#### The Way In\n\n###### The people behind targeted ransomware attacks are, in a sense, like professional penetration testers with\n\n malicious intent. Armed with the required tools, skills, and financial motivation, they can achieve network\n\n access through various means such as access as a service (AaaS) brokers, where access to compromised\n\n environments is purchased for varying prices depending on how lucrative the victim network is; via direct\n\n exploitation of internet-facing infrastructure; and phishing.\n\n In terms of how Nefilim actors gain access, externally facing infrastructures present attackers with potential\n\n inroads to internal corporate networks, especially when such infrastructures are not fully secured. In the\n\n case of Nefilim ransomware attacks, our investigations uncovered the use of exposed RDP services and\n\n publicly available exploits to gain initial access — namely, a vulnerability in the Citrix Application Delivery\n\n Controller (CVE-2019-19781).[24] After gaining initial access, Nefilim attackers start by downloading\n\n additional tools on a web browser. Among the files downloaded are a Cobalt Strike beacon, which is used\n\n to establish a remote connection to the environment and execute commands;[25] the Process Hacker tool\n\n used to terminate endpoint security agents;[26] and Mimikatz, which is used to dump credentials.[27] In one\n\n case that we analyzed, actors initially attempted to deploy an unsigned Cobalt Strike beacon, which was\n\n detected by the antimalware agent running on the server. The actors persisted, returning several days\n\n later with a signed beacon, which was once again detected. The next section describes the group’s lateral\n\n movement approaches and the tools and techniques that they have used.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In order to run certain tools as administrator, the actors took advantage of an unpatched vulnerability in\n\n CVE-2017-0213,[28] a Windows Component Object Model (COM) elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability\n\n that was discovered by Google Project Zero[29] and fixed by Microsoft in May 2017. The fact that a patch\n\n has been available for this vulnerability for several years now also demonstrates the importance of\n\n timely patching, not only for critical vulnerabilities that tend to get more attention in the media, but any\n\n vulnerability that would allow attackers opportunities to compromise infrastructures.\n\n At this point, the attackers have landed inside the victim environment. They have downloaded a tool that\n\n enabled persistent remote access to the system and have become ready to pivot to other areas of the\n\n network.\n\n The following table lists the initial access methods that we have observed based on our analysis of Nefilim\n\n so far. We also call out methods that are commonly used by similar ransomware groups, but to date, have\n\n not been specifically observed to be used by Nefilim.\n\n##### MITRE ATT&CK TTPs\n\n|Tactic|Technique|Observable|\n|---|---|---|\n|Reconnaissance Initial access Privilege escalation Credential access * Credential access|Active scanning: Vulnerability scanning T1595.002 T1133: External remote services T1068: Exploitation for privilege escalation T1003.001: OS credential dumping: LSASS memory T1110.003 Brute force password spraying|Attackers actively scan for internet-facing hosts that are vulnerable to recently disclosed exploits.

(See Appendix) Attackers dump and use credentials to gain access to additional parts of the internal network after gaining initial access. It is also subsequently used for lateral movement. Look for evidence/artifacts indicating the use of such techniques. Attackers use commonly abused passwords across different accounts.

Initial access methods of Nefilim actors and other commonly used methods by similar ransomware groups\n\n *Commonly used TTPs but have not been observed in our Nefilim investigations\n\n##### Recommended Defenses: Preventing Ransomware Attacks by Mitigating Vulnerabilities\n\n###### Internet-facing systems like VPN servers are directly exposed to untrusted networks and are at greater risk.\n\n Organizations can prevent ransomware attacks by mitigating vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems. In\n\n addition, attacks against internet-facing assets should also be secured through regular patching and\n\n the robust implementation of access controls. Solutions that provide virtual patching or vulnerability\n\n shielding can defend organizations against known and unknown vulnerabilities while avoiding work\n related disruptions.[31]\n\n Shielding the Network Perimeter From Exploits Used in Ransomware Attacks\n\n Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) provide a layer of protection by shielding potentially vulnerable\n\n infrastructure through generic and specific filters from exploits that are used in targeted ransomware\n\n attacks. IPS can provide rapid protection ahead of patch availability or patch deployment. This is\n\n particularly important with targeted ransomware attacks, wherein attackers quickly capitalize on newly\n\n discovered vulnerabilities or poorly secured infrastructure.\n\n Additionally, the mining of IPS logs can unlock a wealth of actionable intelligence such as exploit usage\n\n and attacker infrastructure. Having high central visibility over these logs can help spot the initial stages\n\n of an attack.\n\n Network and Vulnerability Scanning\n\n Defenders should maintain an inventory of all exposed services, including ports and software versions,\n\n across the corporate perimeter and mitigate risks as required. Periodic scanning for exposed services\n\n and vulnerabilities provides visibility on potential inroads to the network. Subscribe to security feeds from\n\n appliance and system vendors to ensure the timely mitigation of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Account Security\n\n A least-privileged administrative model should be implemented. Organizations should provide users with\n\n the least permissive roles possible that would still allow them to accomplish their jobs or functions. On top\n\n of this, strong authentication systems such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and conditional access\n\n for all users must be deployed.\n\n Defenders also need to segment accounts into non-privileged, privileged, and highly privileged. It should\n\n be noted that the use of highly privileged accounts should be limited as much as possible and should only\n\n be used from select hardened machines. \n\n Incident Response\n\n Targeted ransomware attacks like Nefilim often utilize data that has been exfiltrated by information\n stealing malware. Security teams should perform comprehensive IR investigations in the aftermath of\n\n an information-stealing malware infection. Compiling the full kill chain and root cause analysis provides\n\n important lessons in the learning phase of the IR life cycle to prevent reoccurrence.\n\n On the detection of malware like those mentioned in Figure 6, predetermined procedures called playbooks\n\n can be used to ensure a consistent and comprehensive response to mitigate the latent threat posed by\n\n loaders and information stealers. A common defender mistake is to assume that an IR ticket can be\n\n closed upon the removal of early-stage malware files in the system. The exfiltration of sensitive data like\n\n credentials or the dropping of additional payloads and subsequent lateral movement could be missed in\n\n this case. We recommend that for any malware detected in an incident, defenders should read security\n\n reports and research to see if the malware variant in question is commonly used as an early part of a larger\n\n kill chain. If so, defenders should assume that the later stages of the kill chain may have already been\n\n deployed and they should be investigated and neutralized.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Tric|kbot|\n|---|---|\n\n|Dri|dex|\n|---|---|\n\n|Dri|dex|\n|---|---|\n\n|Qak|Bot|\n|---|---|\n\n|Qak|Bot|\n|---|---|\n\n|Em|otet|\n|---|---|\n\n|Em|otet|\n|---|---|\n\n|Em|otet|\n|---|---|\n\n\nMalspam\n\n\nMalspam\n\n\nMalvertising Blackhat SEO\n\n\nMalspam\n\n\nMalspam\n\n\nMalspam\n\nNefilim\n\nConti\n\nBazarLoader IcedID\n\nMalspam Malspam\n\n\nMalspam\n\n\nMalspam\n\n\nMalspam\n\n\n###### Figure 6. A non-exhaustive diagram that features the relationships between malware loaders and\n\n the final ransomware payload at the time of writing\n\n Cross-Layered Detection and Response\n\n It is becoming increasingly commonplace for organizations and enterprises to use multiple security layers\n\n to detect and block threats from email, endpoints, servers, cloud infrastructures, and networks. Though\n\n these perform their function well, the disparate layers can result to siloed threat information and an\n\n abundance of uncorrelated alerts. These can deter the proper and efficient remediation of threats.\n\n Organizations can benefit from a threat defense platform that provides a correlated and comprehensive\n\n view of threats. This provides organizations with streamlined alerts of all pertinent threat-related activities\n\n that will allow them to investigate and launch a complete defense plan.\n\n Visibility over the entire infrastructure including emails, networks, endpoints, on-premise servers, and the\n\n cloud is key to defending organizations against targeted ransomware attacks. Managed XDR solutions\n\n can give IR teams a broader perspective and provide better attack-centric context to the chain of events\n\n from a single dashboard. These tools help facilitate faster detection and complete remediation against\n\n multi-stage attacks like those seen in Nefilim ransomware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation\n\n###### Once the attackers have gained a foothold into the network, they will attempt to perform host discovery\n\n activities to find even more hosts to attack and compromise. Lateral movement is the process by which\n\n an attacker tries to use a compromised system or systems to find others to which they can gain access.\n\n To avoid detection, attackers will often weaponize tools that are built-in or are commonly used by\n\n administrators, a tactic that is otherwise called “living off the land.”[32]\n\n PsExec is one of the most popular tools attackers use. It is a tool created by Microsoft’s Sysinternals\n\n group and meant for legitimate purposes such as launching interactive command prompts on remote\n\n servers.[33] However, attackers abuse PsExec to execute programs on remote systems with credentials\n\n that have been harvested either via the lateral movement phase or pre-ransomware attack phases.[34] The\n\n tool is used to execute a batch script containing a list of commands that stop certain running services\n\n and processes from running. Ransomware actors would not be able to encrypt the files that are locked by\n\n certain processes and services, hence, they use PsExec to stop these from running.\n\n The use of PsExec, a legitimate tool commonly used by system administrators, has been observed during\n\n Nefilim infections to launch taskkill.exe on remote machines. This would effectively stop processes that\n\n might alert the victim to an attacker’s activities. In multiple cases, PsExec has been observed being used\n\n to stop a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) daemon, backup services, and other services.\n\n It has also been used to stop certain running services and processes in order to avoid access violations\n\n when encrypting files locked by those processes. PsExec is used to execute a batch script containing a\n\n list of commands. These commands stop certain running services and processes in order to avoid access\n\n violations that could prevent the ransomware from encrypting the files locked by those same running\n\n processes and services.\n\n Figure 7. Triggered taskkill.exe to end select processes\n\n Windows PowerShell, a management framework system administrators use for automating tasks, is\n\n another common tool that attackers abuse because it is a powerful open-source and cross-platform\n\n platform.[35] We observed how cybercriminals abused a PowerShell command to drop a Cobalt Strike\n\n beacon in one of these attacks from 2020.[36] The command uses the FromBase64String function to\n\n decode a Base64 blob. When manually decoded, it matches a PowerShell Cyberchef decoder recipe\n\n on GitHub that can extract Cobalt Strike shellcode.[37] This technique has been observed being used with\n\n multiple ransomware families, including all of the Nefilim attacks that we have analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 8. The Base64-encoded Powershell\n\n Mimikatz[38] is another tool that we have seen in a few Nefilim infections. Mimikatz is a popular penetration\n\n testing and Red Team tool that dumps plaintext passwords, hashes, Kerberos tickets, and other sensitive\n\n information from memory.[39]\n\n In some cases, plaintext passwords are stored as variables in memory. Even if it only stores the hash\n\n of the password, there are ways to crack those hashes offline with tools such as hashcat[40] or John\n\n the Ripper (JtR).[41] It can also be used to utilize cracked passwords or tickets in pass-the-hash (PTH)\n\n attacks,[42] which is a common technique used to gain access to other systems within the network. While\n\n this tool is popular, there is no major legitimate purpose necessitating system administrators to deploy\n\n this tool in their systems. Mimikatz is also a tool that can be used for privilege escalation, which means\n\n that the attackers are looking for higher permissions on the system than the ones they have currently\n\n compromised.[43] This most commonly occurs if a service or a user with higher privileges is logged into a\n\n compromised machine, which can cause their passwords to still be in memory and possibly be extracted.\n\n Attackers can use unprivileged access to enter and explore a victim network, however, they would require\n\n elevated permissions to proceed with their intended objectives.[44]\n\n Timestamp Path Detection\n\n 08/03/2020 20:54 C:\\logs\\x64\\ProcessHacker.exe PUA.Win64.ProcHack.C[45]\n\n 08/03/2020 20:54 C:\\logs\\x64\\kprocesshacker.sys PUA.Win32.ProcHack.B[46]\n\n 08/03/2020 20:54 C:\\logs\\x64\\peview.exe PUA.Win64.

Attackers typically deploy\n\n Cobalt Strike in strategic places on the network, such as important systems to which the attacker knows\n\n they will need extended access. Most often, these are servers and not workstations. Attackers can also\n\n avoid detection by using DNS beacons, which provide an inconspicuous — albeit slower — transmission\n\n of files and other items for exfiltration.[50] Because of this, we have also seen in many cases the use\n\n of MegaSync, a cloud-based synchronization application of the infamous MEGA cloud storage service,\n\n to exfiltrate data.[51] In some cases, attackers have used HTTP or HTTPS beacons as opposed to DNS\n\n beacons, which allows for faster data exfiltration. This is possibly why we might not always see both DNS\n\n exfiltration and MegaSync in the case of Nefilim.\n\n Table 3 lists the tools that we have observed being used in lateral movement and privilege escalation.\n\n However, it should be noted that ransomware actors are not limited to these tools. Attackers use tools\n\n based on the environment being compromised and what tools they think they can run without getting\n\n caught.\n\n##### MITRE ATT&CK TTPs\n\n###### Tactic Technique Observable\n\n T1550: Use alternate authentication Attackers can use Mimikatz to dump hashes, material tickets, or plain text passwords.\n\n T1570: Lateral tool transfer Attackers can deploy tools within systems to aid in lateral movement.

(See Appendix)|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Recommended Defenses: Preventing Ransomware Attacks by Blocking Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation\n\n###### Defending systems against the lateral movement and privilege escalation phase of a modern ransomware\n\n attack can be difficult. This is because attackers are more likely to abuse legitimate tools that administrators\n\n regularly utilize. In this attack phase, ransomware actors have already gotten inside the network and\n\n are starting to look for other hosts to compromise. And though it is possible for the time between the\n\n initial breach and the lateral movement phase to be lengthy, once the lateral movement phase starts,\n\n most actors tend to work more quickly knowing that their risk of discovery increases. During this stage,\n\n attackers will prioritize moving between hosts. Modern ransomware actors operating the same business\n\n model favored by the Nefilim group will start exfiltrating data.\n\n Network Segmentation and Micro-Segmentation to Inhibit Lateral Movement and Support Security Monitoring\n\n Attackers looking to extort victims through data theft and destruction with ransomware must first move\n\n around the network to discover sensitive data. Making lateral movement more difficult for an attacker\n\n slows them down and increases the chances that they will be discovered through effective security\n\n monitoring.\n\n\n**FLAT NETWORK**\n\n\n**SEGMENTED NETWORK**\n\n\nAttacker breaches\nthe firewall\n\n\nAttacker breaches\nthe firewall\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Security perimeter DAAS DAAS DAAS DAAS 2 Protected Attacker is not able to move Protected subnet laterally and escalate privileges subnet due to network segmentation||\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Security perimeter DAAS DAAS DAAS DAAS 2 Attacker moves laterally and escalates privileges to access critical information||\n|||\n\n\nAttacker exfiltrates\ncritical information\n\n\nAttacker launches\nransomware payload\n\n\n###### Figure 9. A diagram showcasing the differences in security between a flat network and a segmented network\n\n\n-----\n\n**Network segmentation**\n\n\n**Microsegmentation**\n\n\n###### Figure 10. A diagram showcasing the differences between network segmentation and micro-segmentation\n\n Organizations can benefit from segmenting office and server networks to effectively limit an attacker’s\n\n scope of compromise. This can be done by micro-segmenting information systems, using properly\n\n defended management networks to protect underlying administrative interfaces on network infrastructure,\n\n and employing virtualization and cloud infrastructures.\n\n Intrusion Detection Systems\n\n Intrusion detection systems (IDS) can help detect malicious activities and aid security operations in\n\n tracking anomalous events after attackers have gained initial access to a system. IDS sensors can detect\n\n attackers leveraging compromised users, unknown malware, exploits, or covert C&C channels at the\n\n network, cloud, and endpoint, and server layers.\n\n Multi-Factor Authentication\n\n Employing multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a good way to limit the reuse of comprised credentials that\n\n may have already been stolen or collected by attackers from data breaches.[52] Attackers who have access\n\n to accounts that are being used in multiple machines and are running without MFA will be able to log in,\n\n execute commands, and pivot to more machines. This allows attackers to more easily perform lateral\n\n movement inside the network. It should be noted that security best practices must be followed when\n\n using local authentication methods, such avoiding the use of the same password on multiple machines\n\n and limiting the use of any administrative accounts if the built-in administrator must be enabled.\n\n#### Calling Home and Exfiltration\n\n###### As discussed in the previous section, Nefilim-associated actors frequently use the commercially available\n\n software Cobalt Strike after they have successfully compromised an organization’s network. Cobalt\n\n Strike is a versatile post-exploitation penetration tool that allows penetration testers, red teams, and\n\n unfortunately, attackers, to further attack the network, control the compromised system, and exfiltrate\n\n interesting data. For this to work, Cobalt Strike beacon is run on or injected into the compromised system.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### When the software is abused for nefarious purposes, the beacon will connect back to the Cobalt Strike\n\n C&C server that an attacker controls. The callback can be achieved using several protocols, including\n\n HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS, as we have observed in the Nefilim attacks that we have analyzed. The attacker\n\n can connect to the team server component of the Cobalt Strike server, by default on port 50050/TCP.\n\n When this happens, the attacker can have a convenient overview of all compromised systems and the\n\n capability to remotely execute attacks. Our analysis of Nefilim attacks points to evidence showing that\n\n the attackers are connecting to different Cobalt Strike C&C servers through residential IP addresses,\n\n indicating that those have been compromised as well.\n\n Figure 11. A screenshot of the Cobalt Strike management interface.\n\n Image source: www.cobaltstrike.com\n\n We have also seen different clusters on the internet hosting Nefilim-related Cobalt Strike C&C servers.\n\n The actors have a preference for hosting companies in various countries including Bulgaria, the UK, the\n\n US, and the Netherlands. Other Nefilim-related Cobalt Strike C&C servers are hosted through small\n\n bulletproof web hosting services created by various shell companies. These might belong to one bigger\n\n bulletproof hosting company. As far as we can tell, there are dozens of these shell companies, with their\n\n assigned IP ranges mostly being used for nefarious purposes. Most of these shell companies have been\n\n in business for several years and thus can provide stable bulletproof hosting for bad actors. Some of the\n\n shell companies seem to be set up almost exclusively for hosting Cobalt Strike beacon C&Cs, large scale\n\n internet scanning (including the scanning of Citrix servers), and in one case, the clear-web back end for a\n\n Tor-hidden website in which Nefilim actors post data stolen from their victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Based on our observation, Nefilim actors make use of at least three different kinds of bulletproof hosting\n\n services. Apart from a Tor-hidden server that is used to leak stolen information from victims and the small\n\n IP ranges belonging to small shell companies, Nefilim also makes use of the so-called fast flux hosting.\n\n The front end of the clear-web website corpleaks[.]net, where attackers upload information stolen from\n\n victims, is hosted on a fast flux network. This means that the front end regularly changes its IP address.\n\n The same was true for the affiliate website of Nemty operators. The RaaS back end of Nefilim, which hosts\n\n the real content, is hosted through a fast flux network to keep it from being taken down for an extended\n\n period of time. We are confident that we have identified the back-end server of corpleaks[.]net, however,\n\n it is hosted by one of the small shell companies that offers bulletproof hosting.\n\n One remarkable thing that we have discovered is that Nemty’s websites, which were hosted on fast flux\n\n networks, consistently shared front-end IP addresses with websites of the infamous slilpp[.]io actors\n\n for more than one year. The slilpp[.]io actors specialize in the large-scale stealing and selling of financial\n\n assets. Whether sharing the same kind of fast flux front-end servers is merely coincidental or otherwise\n\n is part of our ongoing research.\n\n Figure 12. The passive DNS data of slilpp[.]io and Nemty\n\n Cobalt Strike beacon callbacks may be used by Nefilim actors to exfiltrate sensitive data in chunks\n\n of a fixed size. When the Cobalt Strike beacon malware makes use of DNS as a C&C protocol, victim\n\n machines will not directly communicate with the C&C servers, but via a configured recursive DNS server.\n\n For the exfiltration of large files, malicious actors have also been observed using external data sharing\n\n platforms like MEGA to exfiltrate data. Beginning Spring 2020, we have logged exfiltration data from an\n\n FTP server that was likely set up specifically for such a task.\n\n\n-----\n\n|C&C|Date Created|IP Address|Country|Protocol|Confidence Level|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|89.105.195.203|~2020-01-13|89.105.195.203|Netherlands|HTTPS|High|\n|179.60.146.11|~ 2020-02-02|179.60.146.11|Sweden|HTTPS|High|\n|185.147.15.14|~ 2020-02-02|185.147.15.14|Netherlands|HTTPS|High|\n|localskype.com|2020-03-06T20:27:25.00Z|88.214.26.57|Bulgaria|DNS|High|\n|nsskype.com|2020-03-06T20:27:25.00Z|88.214.26.57|Bulgaria|DNS|High|\n|ns1.dnsskype.com|2020-03-06T20:27:25.00Z|88.214.26.57|Bulgaria|DNS|High|\n|ns1.dnsskype.com|2020-03-06T20:27:25.00Z|5.188.206.219|Bulgaria|DNS|High|\n|ns1.safeinet.dev|2020-06-01T12:40:16Z|109.234.36.148|Netherlands|DNS|High|\n|securityupdatewin32. org|2020-07-01T11:52:53Z|209.250.247.32|Netherlands|HTTPS|Low|\n|ns1.fairyschool.art|2020-07-01T19:55:54.0Z|88.214.26.29|Bulgaria|DNS|Low|\n|win7securityupdate.net|2020-07-16T14:46:59Z|209.250.243.71|Netherlands|HTTP|Low|\n|adobeupdate7x32.org|2020-08-26T11:51:19Z|78.141.211.59|Netherlands|HTTPS|Low|\n|ns1.msdn7x32.net|2020-08-28T13:07:24Z|89.44.9.221|France|DNS|High|\n|msdn64x7.net|2020-08-31T11:08:41Z|95.179.155.43|Netherlands|HTTPS|High|\n|193.239.84.186|~ 2020-08-31|193.239.84.186|United Kingdom|HTTPS|High|\n|ns1.vaultsecure.net|2020-09-02T10:13:36.00Z|5.188.206.221|Bulgaria|DNS|High|\n|iqio.net|2020-09-17T12:07:02.00Z|185.153.198.134|Romania|HTTP|High|\n|ns1.iioq.me|2020-09-17T12:07:05Z|185.153.198.7|Romania|DNS|High|\n|ns1.iioq.io|2020-09-17T12:07:11Z|185.153.198.33|Romania|DNS|High|\n|ns1.emailsafety.net|2020-09-29T21:07:29.00Z|88.214.26.33|Bulgaria|DNS|High|\n|winupdate10pack2048. net|2020-10-15T09:36:01Z|95.179.138.46|Netherlands|HTTP|High|\n|ns1.owadns.com|2020-10-19T11:37:10.00Z|45.227.252.161|Netherlands|DNS|Low|\n|ns1.owadns.net|2020-10-19T11:37:20.00Z|45.227.252.59|Netherlands|DNS|Low|\n|webintercom76delivery. net|2020-11-02T09:38:06Z|185.141.24.71|Netherlands|HTTP|Low|\n|ns1.cafesunshine.me|2020-11-09T12:25:23Z|46.161.27.212|Netherlands|DNS|High|\n|ns1.siteswhoisit.com|2020-12-30T12:06:12.00Z|41.216.186.237|Netherlands|DNS|Low|\n|dns12.org|2021-01-11T15:02:48Z|144.202.108.45|United States|HTTP|Medium|\n|dns20.net|2021-01-11T15:56:57.00Z|95.179.152.5|Netherlands|HTTP|Medium|\n|dns25.net|2021-01-11T16:41:25.00Z|185.244.150.147|Netherlands|HTTP|Medium|\n|ns1.dns30.net|2021-01-11T17:23:20.00Z|194.36.191.31|Netherlands|DNS|Medium|\n|dns35.net|2021-01-11T18:08:12.00Z|194.36.191.25|Netherlands|HTTPS|Medium|\n\n\n###### Table 4.

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.

Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services.|\n\n\n###### Table 5. The TTPs used in Cobalt Strike\n\n Recommended Defenses: Halting Ransomware Attacks by Preventing Cobalt Strike C&C Server Misuse\n\n To protect systems from Nefilim’s calling back to Cobalt Strike C&C servers, we recommend keeping\n\n antivirus (AV) solutions up-to-date and implementing machine learning plugins of AV software. Defenders\n\n must also monitor — and if applicable, block — suspicious DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS connections. A policy\n\n can be created to block the uploading of files to file-sharing platforms, however it should be noted that\n\n this could hinder legitimate day-to-day operations. It is important to take measures to detect and block\n\n traffic to Cobalt Strike C&C servers in general. Since Cobalt Strike is designed to evade detection by\n\n security software, a multilayered approach is imperative in thwarting this type of threat. In some cases,\n\n it is possible to detect Cobalt Strike beaconing by looking at suspicious internet traffic patterns. For\n\n example, when an attacker uses DNS as the communication protocol for his Cobalt Strike malware,\n\n regular DNS requests to relatively young domains in the log files of the corporate recursive DNS server\n\n can be viewed as possible C&C traffic. It is critical to block Cobalt Strike C&C traffic that makes use of\n\n default Cobalt Strike settings and known JARM[53] fingerprints to either generate block lists or use third\n party block lists of known Cobalt Strike C&C servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Malware Payload\n\n###### The first Nefilim ransomware sample we detected (SHA-256: 08c7dfde13ade4b13350ae290616d7c2f4a87c\n\n beac9a3886e90a175ee40fb641) has a compilation date of March 10, 2020, at 01:40 (UTC). At the time,\n\n the file was signed with a valid certificate issued by Sectigo, a cybersecurity provider of digital identity\n\n solutions. The sample was written in pure C/C++ using the Windows API and compiled for a 32-bit\n\n architecture. No packers or cryptors were used in the sample. We have reached out to Sectigo, who\n\n has promptly revoked all of the certificates used in this campaign, therefore making the execution of the\n\n malware substantially more difficult. It should be noted that Sectigo already revoked almost half of the\n\n certificates included in our report before we contacted them.\n\n The malware decrypts a ransom note using a fixed RC4 key. It features three email addresses that victims\n\n can use to contact the Nefilim actors about the ransom payment.\n\n Figure 13. The Nefilim ransom note\n\n It then generates a random AES key for each file that it queues for encryption.\n\n To enable file decryption in case the victim pays the ransom amount, the malware encrypts the generated\n\n AES key with a fixed RSA public key and appends it to the encrypted file. To date, only the attackers can\n\n decrypt this scheme as they alone own the paired private RSA key.\n\n##### Detailed Execution Flow\n\n###### As stated in previous sections, Nefilim is a post-compromise ransomware. Therefore, it is launched\n\n manually by actors or affiliates only after they determine that they have adequate control over the victim’s\n\n infrastructure. Once it is running, the execution flow is very straightforward. First, Nefilim creates a mutual\n\n exclusion (mutex) object to prevent more than one thread of the same process.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 14. Creation of a mutex\n\n The next step involves decrypting the ransom note. This is done by calculating the SHA-1 digest from a\n\n hard-coded string to further derive it to an RC4 key. This is carried out using the following functions from\n\n the Microsoft CryptoAPI platform, which Microsoft has marked as deprecated a few years ago:\n\n • CryptAcquireContextA\n\n • CryptCreateHash\n\n • CryptHashData\n\n • CryptDeriveKey\n\n If any of these functions fail, the ransomware exits without encrypting anything. It should be noted\n\n that though Microsoft CryptoAPI is deprecated, they still work on recent versions of Windows, such as\n\n Windows 10.\n\n Nefilim has the ransom note hard-coded, encrypted with this RC4 key, and further encoded with base64.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 15. Decryption of the ransomware note\n\n When the abovementioned function is called, the ransom note is kept in memory. It will be written to disk\n\n in a succeeding step.\n\n RSA Key Import\n\n After decrypting the ransom note, Nefilim imports an RSA-2048 public key and leaves it ready to use for\n\n encryption.\n\n Figure 16. Importing the RSA-2048 public key for encryption\n\n The key used by the function above is stored in the .rdata section of the executable, as shown in Figure 17.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 17. The Base64-encoded RSA public key used to decrypt the ransom note\n\n##### Impact Modes\n\n###### Single Directory\n\n The Nefilim payload supports a command-line argument that contains the full directory path. This contains\n\n the files the attacker wants to encrypt. In this mode, it does not create a ransom note. We believe that\n\n criminals use this for testing purposes and/or manual encryption of specified directories for performance\n\n reasons.\n\n Normal Operation and File Encryption\n\n If launched without any arguments, the Nefilim executable prepares to encrypt all logical drives with\n\n writing permissions, including A:, B:, C:, and D:, in an affected Windows machine. Removable drives and\n\n network shares are also targeted but the latter must be mapped to a drive letter for Nefilim to see it.\n\n Figure 18. The malware iterates through drives to encrypt\n\n For each suitable logical drive found, Nefilim decrypts and writes a ransom note file named “NEFILIM\n DECRYPT.txt” (or “<VARIANT_NAME>-DECRYPT.txt”) in the drive root and creates a thread to encrypt all\n\n content in the drive.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 19. Function for creating the ransom note\n\n Exclusions\n\n Before Nefilim starts to encrypt files, it checks if they match its exclusion list of files and directory names,\n\n as seen in Figure 20.\n\n Figure 20. Files excluded from Nefilim encryption\n\n This prevents Nefilim from encrypting essential files to allow the operating system and common applications\n\n such as browsers and e-mail clients to continue working properly. Some folders directly related to common\n\n security products are also excluded, probably to avoid being detected by such products.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### It also skips files with the following extensions:\n\n • .cab\n\n • .cmd\n\n • .com\n\n • .cpl\n\n • .dll\n\n • .exe\n\n • .ini\n\n • .lnk\n\n • .log\n\n • .mp3\n\n • .mp4\n\n • .msi\n\n • .pif\n\n • .ttf\n\n • .url\n\n Additionally, it also skips encrypting files that have previously been encrypted by checking the extension\n\n of the variant name, such as .NEFILIM and .MERIN. The exclusion list has changed for later versions of\n\n Nefilim variants, but it is still hard-coded.\n\n##### File Encryption\n\n###### The largest function in the Nefilim code is the encryption function. It uses different code techniques to\n\n attempt to bypass security products.\n\n The overall algorithm:\n\n 1. Generate two 128-bit random numbers using the RtIGetRandom/SystemFunction036 function\n\n from ADVAPI32.DLL. As this function is not exported, Nefilim actors load it using LoadLibrary and\n\n GetProcAddress. The second generated number will be used as an AES-128 key in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 21. RtlGetRandom function dynamic resolution\n\n 2. Encrypt both numbers with the RSA public key and write the result to the end of the target file\n\n 3. Write an ASCII string containing the variant name to the end of the target file\n\n 4. Read the file content to a buffer\n\n 5. Encrypt the file content with AES-128 using the second random number as the key\n\n 6. Write the encrypted content back to the file, replacing the original content\n\n 7. Free both generated random numbers and the encrypted keys from memory\n\n 8. Add the variant name as an extension to the encrypted file\n\n 9. Remove itself three seconds after completing encryption by executing the following commands: cmd.\n\n exe /c timeout /t 3 /nobreak && del <path> /s /f /q\n\n##### Variants and Evolution\n\n###### After its first version was spotted in the wild, we have continued to monitor Nefilim’s activities and its\n\n evolution. To date, we have observed 18 different variants among an estimated 75 different samples,\n\n using a total of 22 valid certificates. We also noticed that the Nefilim actors tried to switch from Microsoft\n\n CryptoAPI to a newer replacement called Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG).[54] We captured a\n\n unique sample that uses functions from the bcrypt.h header, which is a part of CNG API:\n\n Figure 22. CNG (bcrypt.dll) functions seen in the Merin variant\n\n The file analyzed in Figure 22 has a compilation date of October 4, 2020. It loads both crypt32dll and\n\n bcrypt.dll dynamically, using LoadLibraryA and LoadLibraryW, respectively. This completely replaces\n\n CryptoAPI and the need for ADVAPI32.dll as seen in previous samples written in C++. Interestingly, we\n\n\n-----\n\n###### observed a major evolution on July 9, 2020, when the first variant of Nefilim written in the Go language\n\n appeared.\n\n Throughout the different variants, the most significant change started with samples that encrypted files\n\n using the .MILIHPEN file extension. This variant completed the migration from CryptoAPI to CNG and\n\n uses an embedded JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-based configuration. This suggests that a Nefilim\n\n ransomware builder exists. The JSON has configuration fields for mutex name, ransom note content,\n\n ransom note filename, RSA public key, directory names, file extensions to skip, and Windows API function\n\n names to resolve dynamically.\n\n Figure 23. An example of a JSON-based configuration for the .MILIHPEN variant\n\n This variant also has some debugging function calls that tell whoever runs the payload at which stage the\n\n ransomware resides. This was not surprising given the fact that Nefilim has been used as post-intrusion\n\n ransomware that is manually operated by its attackers.\n\n Figure 24. Debug messages from .MILIHPEN variant\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 25. Success message when encryption is finished\n\n Other variants include small tweaks to the code. For example, the GANGBANG variant added a custom\n\n encryption to hide its JSON-based configuration. It first decodes it using base64 and then decrypts it with\n\n a custom algorithm as shown in Figure 26.\n\n Figure 26. Base64 decoding of the JSON-based configuration\n\n Figure 27. Custom JSON-based configuration decryption algorithm with a fixed key\n\n\n-----\n\n###### We have summarized the evolution of the Nefilim ransomware and took note of its variants in our Appendix.\n\n Based on the information we have gathered, Nefilim samples follow a consistent pattern. This suggests\n\n that:\n\n • Each victim gets a unique sample including the contact information of the ransomware actors in the\n\n form of three e-mail addresses in the ransom note.\n\n • When Nefilim authors change the certificate they use to sign the binaries, they also change the\n\n extension added to encrypted files.\n\n There are quite a few interesting PDB strings and mutexes in the Nefilim samples we have found. Our\n\n investigation shows that most of the mutexes are connected to specific Russian rap songs. We will\n\n explore this angle further in the Attribution section.\n\n##### MITRE ATT&CK TTPs\n\n|Tactic|Technique|Observable|\n|---|---|---|\n|Initial access Execution Privilege escalation Defense evasion|T1078 – Valid accounts T1106 – Native API* T1059 - Command and scripting interpreter T1055 - Process injection T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode files or information T1070 – Indicator removal on host* T1070.004 - File deletion*|Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion.

The TTPs used by Nefilim actors in the samples we have found and analyzed\n\n##### Recommended Defenses: Shielding Organizations Against Nefilim and its Variants\n\n###### As stated before, Nefilim ransomware binaries are straightforward. Although some samples found were\n\n packed or protected, most of them were not. The following ransomware mitigation techniques can work\n\n to protect users from this ransomware family:\n\n • Back up important files using the 3-2-1 rule: Have at least three copies, in two different formats, with\n\n one of those copies off-site.[56] The cloud is a good offsite backup, which provides additional security\n\n features such as data encryption and server virtualization.[57]\n\n • Limit access to shared or network drives and turn off file sharing to minimize the risk of ransomware\n\n spreading throughout the network.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### • Employ canary file-based monitoring and process killing. Organizations can make use of canary files,\n\n which are essentially files that ransomware actors are more likely to infect but are not valuable to the\n\n company. When ransomware actors infect canary files, it will trigger an alert for security teams.[58]\n\n • Monitor encrypted network traffic via Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS). This\n\n security tool allows SOC teams to inspect network traffic metadata to see where encryption and\n\n decryption are done.\n\n#### Victimology\n\n###### The profile of a Nefilim victim is relatively broad in terms of location and industry. Nefilim has been\n\n observed to target multi-billion companies more than other ransomware groups. Nefilim has also been\n\n able to keep its website up and running for more than a year. At times, the Nefilim ransomware group\n\n posts the sensitive data of their victims over several weeks and even months to scare future victims into\n\n paying ransom. \n\n The majority of Nefilim victims are located in North and South America, but victims are dotted throughout\n\n Europe, Asia, and Oceania.\n\n Based on our observation, the US has been consistently targeted from Q3 2020 to Q1 2021.\n\nAustralia Brazil Canada France Germany India Italy Jamaica\n\nMexico New Zealand Sri Lanka Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom USA\n\nMar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar\n2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2021 2021 2021\n\n###### Figure 28. Timeline of Nefilim activity by country per month from March 2020 to March 2021\n\n A global look at the industries impacted by Nefilim operations highlights the breadth and scope of this\n\n threat. Based on our data, Nefilim has victims across five continents: North and South America, Europe,\n\n Asia, and Oceania.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Construction Energy Engineering Financial Food Manufacturing Oil and Gas\n\n Outsourcing Pharmaceutical Real Estate Technology Telecommunications Transportation\n\n Figure 29. Nefilim victims by industry and location\n\n The next section compares Nefilim with 16 other RaaS actors. Nefilim distinguishes itself from most other\n\n ransomware families by targeting high-profile companies with revenues often reaching billions of dollars\n\n per year. Nefilim also shows better control over its website compared to other ransomware families and is\n\n particularly vicious when it comes to leaking victims’ sensitive data over extended periods of time.\n\n Based on our data, there has been a steady and substantial growth in the amount of sensitive data that\n\n Nefilim actors leaked.\n\n\n-----\n\n2K\n\n0\n\n\n###### 1,752\n\n1,196\n\n1,040\n\n746\n647\n\n321 333\n\n187\n131\n51\n4\n\nMar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan\n2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2021\n\n\n###### Figure 30. The cumulative data (in gigabytes) leaked by Nefilim actors from March 2020 to January 2021\n\n##### Leaking of Stolen Data: Nefilim Actors vs. Different RaaS Actors\n\n###### To put further pressure on their victims, ransomware actors often threaten to leak sensitive data that have\n\n been stolen before deploying ransomware in their compromised networks. We found at least 16 other\n\n ransomware actors who maintain websites wherein they publish their victims’ stolen data. Some of these\n\n websites are on Tor-hidden servers while others are hosted using bulletproof hosting. Some RaaS actors\n\n upload stolen files on commercially available and free file-sharing platforms. The effect of these sensitive\n\n data leaks on victims is not immediately clear. It is unlikely for a victim to eventually pay a ransom to a\n\n malicious actor to get sensitive data removed from a website, or to prevent even more stolen data from\n\n being leaked. Once sensitive data is stolen, a victim cannot do much else: sensitive data is already in the\n\n hands of malicious actors who can wreak havoc and monetize that data in different ways.\n\n We think that the primary reason ransomware actors leak sensitive data is to issue a clear warning to\n\n future victims: ransomware actors will try to cause further harm when the ransom amount is not paid.\n\n Some attackers seem to act in opportunistic ways and try to explore new ways of illicitly earning money.\n\n For example, the infamous REvil actors boldly started an “auction” option on their website on the dark\n\n web.[59] The stolen data of a victim organization that refused to pay the ransom is put on sale on their\n\n website to be sold to the winning auction bidder. To date, no one has participated in the REvil auction;\n\n all auction deadlines for stolen data have already passed without any public bids. But though this tactic\n\n seemed to have failed thus far, if and when malicious actors start to successfully auction off stolen data,\n\n it would prove to have a chilling effect on ransomware victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Some ransomware actors, including Cl0p, have also threatened to release the sensitive data of an\n\n organization that they have breached unless a ransom is paid.\n\n We researched the leaked sites of 16 ransomware actors and found significant differences in the way these\n\n actors implemented their successful extortion tactics. Most actors claim that they will keep stolen data\n\n publicly available for several months. Some actors such as Nefilim and Cl0p manage to keep terabytes of\n\n stolen data online for over a year and claim to regularly leak an increasing amount of data from the same\n\n victim. Other actors, such as LockBit and REvil, host their stolen data mostly on free and premium file\n sharing platforms. These file-sharing platforms are usually quick to take down content that goes against\n\n their terms and conditions. This means that only a limited amount of the stolen data by REvil and LockBit\n\n can actually be downloaded. We have also observed that the REvil RaaS website has many dead links to\n\n URLs that previously hosted their stolen data, which gives off an impression of disorganization. Several\n\n actors make stolen data available via Tor-hidden websites. However, storing hundreds of gigabytes of\n\n stolen data on a Tor-hidden server is of limited use: downloading large archive files over Tor takes time —\n\n in some cases up to several days — because of its low throughput. A determined person will eventually\n\n succeed in downloading data over Tor, but for extortion purposes, this kind of hosting on the dark web\n\n does not make much sense.\n\n Some actors also host files on their own websites on the clear web. For instance, Nefilim actors have both\n\n clear web and Tor-hidden websites on which they publish stolen data. We detailed how Nefilim’s website\n\n uses fast flux bulletproof hosting in the “Calling Home and Exfiltration” section. This is mainly because\n\n Nefilim’s clear web website is hosted by fast flux bulletproof hosting.\n\n Conti 207\n\nDoppelPaymer 155\n\nEgregor 151\n\nREvil 139\n\nDarkSide 38\n\nAvaddon 34\n\nNefilim 29\n\nCl0p 25\n\nRagnar 23\n\nSunCrypt 18\n\nRagnarok 18\n\nMount Locker 12\n\nLockBit 9\n\nCuba 8\n\nBabuk 5\n\nRanzy 3\n\n0 250\n\n###### Figure 31.

Doing so allows us to better understand the driving force\n\n behind these ransomware developments.\n\n The change in the tactics employed by these actors is a direct response to the new, defensive approaches\n\n applied by the security industry that has brought us to where we are today. As this malware trend continues\n\n to evolve, we have also seen a shift in the activities of malicious actors in recent years — including\n\n the actors behind the Nefilim and Nemty ransomware. We tracked the group behind these ransomware\n\n families under the intrusion set “Water Roc.”\n\n As discussed in a previous section, we believe that the Nefilim ransomware has evolved from an earlier\n\n ransomware family called Nemty. Jsworm and Jingo are two underground actors we currently associate\n\n with Water Roc activity. We have also seen both actors actively selling and supporting Nemty in the past.\n\n Based on their activities online, both actors are believed to be Russian speakers. Nemty’s code also\n\n contained lyrics from several Russian songs and artists, as mentioned in an earlier section of this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 35. Nemty code that contains the lyrics to the Russian song “MORGENSTERN -ПОСОСИ”\n\n We first encountered jsworm in May 2019 with the initial sales postings for RazvRAT, a remote administration\n\n trojan (RAT), and the JSWorm ransomware affiliate program on a Russian forum called Exploit. It should\n\n be noted that “jsworm” refers to the ransomware actors, while “JSWorm” refers to the ransomware.\n\n The RazvRAT malware was advertised with a US$250 starting price. The amount was US$950 for the\n\n full package, which included a hidden Virtual Network Computing (hVNC) module. Jsworm removed the\n\n listing after a buyer appeared several days later in what appears to be a one-off sale.\n\n Figure 36. An advertisement for RazvRAT posted on an online forum\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 37. The RazvRAT control panel\n\n The sale of RazvRAT was followed by the emergence of the JSWorm ransomware from the same actor.\n\n Affiliates of the program had to provide their own traffic and two abused emails for inclusion in the\n\n ransomware note. Profits from any successful ransom were to be divided — 30% for jsworm and 70%\n\n for the affiliate user. Jsworm also advised his affiliates to use the cock[.]li or tutanota email providers. An\n\n early version of this ransomware was spotted in the wild in January 2019 by several security professionals.\n\n The JSWorm ransomware was spread through unprotected RDP configurations, email spam, malicious\n\n attachments, botnets, exploits, web injections, fake updates, and repackaged and infected installers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 38. Jsworm’s JSWorm ransomware advertisement\n\n Figure 39. The JSWorm ransom note\n\n Figure 40. The JSWorm .JURASIK ransomware variant’s ransom note\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In early January 2019, the blog https://id-ransomware.blogspot[.]com/2019/01/jsworm-ransomware[.]\n\n html listed a decrypter for version 1.0. This predates the advertising of the malware on the forums we\n\n observed it on. This, combined with feature requests from users, led to a series of release notes and\n\n updates to the JSWorm ransomware being posted to the Exploit forum. JSWorm ransomware continued\n\n to get updates until version 4.0 in May 2019.\n\n On August 20, 2019, jsworm started advertising the Nemty affiliate program on Exploit. By this time,\n\n jsworm had received several positive reputation points from his JSWorm ransomware program clients.\n\n A good reputation is very important for malicious actors in the criminal underground, where proving\n\n one’s past activities is difficult due to the competing need for anonymity. Positive feedback from clients\n\n provides actors a better chance to charge more for their creations and services.\n\n The initial version of Nemty supported Windows XP and later versions. It was written in C++, with\n\n Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries banned from being targeted. The profit model was\n\n similar to that of the earlier JSWorm ransomware, allocating 30% to jsworm and 70% to the affiliate user.\n\n There were 25 affiliate slots available year-round.\n\n Figure 41. Jsworm’s Nemty advertisement\n\n Meanwhile, Jingo started advertising Nemty on the Russian forum XSS on September 4, 2019. The terms\n\n of the affiliate program were the same as jsworm’s with 30% for Jingo and 70% for the affiliate user. It\n\n also had 25 affiliate slots available year-round.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 42. Jingo’s Nemty advertisement\n\n In January 2020, Nemty actors created a data leak website on the dark web to publish the data of the victims\n\n who refused to pay the ransom. This is their attempt to put additional pressure on hacked companies\n\n to pay the ransom demands. Other ransomware groups, such as DoppelPaymer and Sodinokibi, have\n\n adopted the same strategy in what has commonly become known as “Double Extortion Ransomware.”\n\n Figure 43. The Nemty ransomware payment page\n\n On March 30, 2020, jsworm posted that Nemty was completely rewritten and renamed as Nemty Revenue\n\n 3.1. The Nefilim ransomware was first spotted in the wild around this time. On April 14, 2020, jsworm\n\n announced that the new Nemty ransomware version was shifting to private sales only, and that Nemty\n\n\n-----\n\n###### victims had one week to buy decryptors. Jsworm has been inactive on the Exploit forum since September\n\n 18, 2020, but we have seen continued activity from Jingo, who was seen looking for a Cobalt Strike expert\n\n in November 2020.\n\n On November 16, 2020, Jingo posted an advertisement for Cobalt Strike using the Jabber contact\n\n farnetwork@jabb.im. Interestingly, a user by the name Farnetwork used the same Jabber contact on\n\n an XSS forum post published on November 9, 2020. The post indicated that the user was looking for a\n\n Cobalt Strike expert. We believe that Jingo and Farnetwork is the same actor using a new alias.\n\n Figure 44.

A timeline of Nefilim actors’ activities\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\n###### Nefilim is one ransomware family among many, but it offers a good look into the modus operandi of\n\n modern ransomware:\n\n • Nefilim’s way into the network often involves the use of weak credentials on exposed RDP services or\n\n other externally facing HTTP services. In at least one case, Nefilim actors may have also used critical\n\n vulnerabilities on services, such as Citrix.[60]\n\n • Once the attackers are inside the victim environment, they behave in a manner more commonly\n\n associated with manual targeted attacks as opposed to automated malware. They perform lateral\n\n movement to try and find important systems, which are more likely to contain sensitive data to\n\n steal and encrypt, in the victim network. They can also use important systems as jump-off points to\n\n keep finding more critical data. Moving to other servers in the network also allows them to maintain\n\n persistence. These lateral movement attempts often use common admin tools to avoid detection by\n\n automated defense tools, a technique that is called “living off the land.”\n\n • The attackers set up a call-home system using the Cobalt Strike software. This utilizes protocols that\n\n can pass through firewalls, like DNS, HTTP, or HTTPS. The C&C servers that the attackers use to\n\n receive these call-home signals are often hosted on bulletproof hosting services.\n\n • Once the attackers have found data worth stealing, they proceed to exfiltrate it. They may use\n\n external hosting sites like mega.nz for uploading a large number of files. The exfiltrated data can\n\n be published on websites hidden behind Tor services and fast flux networks. The publication of this\n\n stolen information will be used at a later stage in an attempt to extort the victim.\n\n • Once the attacker is ready, they launch the ransomware payload manually. The payload encrypts the\n\n data so that the attacker can demand a ransom. The encryption is well implemented, eliminating the\n\n possibility of creating generic decryption tools.\n\n • Nefilim actors target high-profile, multi-billion dollar companies located worldwide.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Even though Nefilim certainly has unique aspects to it, the commonalities with other new-breed\n\n ransomware families are very pronounced. For example, even though other modern ransomware families\n\n tend to publish victim data one way or another, Nefilim has a more stable way of hosting stolen data.\n\n This could allow them to create a second way to extort money off a victim. If the first extortion attempt\n\n fails, they can threaten to publish the victim’s critical data if they do not pay. This tactic, which involves\n\n exfiltrating data prior to encryption, is a common feature of modern ransomware.\n\n Similarly, modern ransomware families behave like targeted attacks in a way that they are not usually\n\n automated. The vulnerability exploitation that provides them a way in is performed semi-automatically.\n\n This means that the attackers use automated tools to scan the company’s external IP ranges. Once a\n\n possible crack is found, they try to exploit it and sneak inside. Once inside, they behave like targeted\n\n attackers by trying to move laterally looking for more targets. This contrasts with how traditional\n\n ransomware compromises a victim: the initial entry is done via phishing emails and the data encryption is\n\n done automatically just by looking for files with certain extensions.\n\n An interesting observation that surfaced from our study is that the group of intruders who first breach\n\n the network is not always the same group who will try to move laterally and monetize the attack. Our\n\n research on criminal underground websites revealed how hackers and vulnerability operators sell access\n\n to breached networks to other criminals. This disconnect between the initial network access and the\n\n ransomware monetization that may come later is what we think we are seeing at play in these attacks.\n\n A substantial side effect of this multiple and disparate involvement of many groups may confuse\n\n investigators who are trying to piece together the attribution part of a ransomware attack. The full kill\n\n chain becomes more complex because various groups are involved. Investigators need to be more aware\n\n of this and avoid merely relying on the perfect matching of observable events to known MITRE ATT&CK\n\n matrices.\n\n The shift in business plans is now becoming more apparent: Ransomware affiliates are looking for bigger\n\n revenue targets. To do that, they do not launch an attack from the outside in. Instead, they just buy\n\n their way in from access brokers in a gamble to make their money back by searching for sensitive data,\n\n stealing it, unleashing the ransomware, and extorting the victim.\n\n These newer business plans have also been enabled by modernized ransomware affiliate programs. The\n\n software that they use is highly professional and user-friendly for the affiliates. For example, they can log\n\n in and simply make some small changes in the configuration and the program will take care of generating\n\n samples, communicating via email, setting the ransom amount automatically, setting the ransom amount\n\n to increase over a specified period, and processing payments.[61]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Modern attackers have moved on from widespread mass-mailed indiscriminate ransomware to a new\n\n model that is much more dangerous. Today, corporations are subject to these new APT-level ransomware\n\n attacks. In fact, they can be worse than APTs because ransomware often ends up destroying data,\n\n whereas information-stealing APTs are almost never destructive. This puts network guardians in a difficult\n\n position: There is a more pressing need to defend organizations against ransomware attacks, and now,\n\n the stakes are much higher.\n\n The current situation is as good as it gets for experts on the defensive side. This is the new benchmark —\n\n and cybersecurity and professionalism will only get better from here. Despite the apparent complexities\n\n of protecting organizations against nefarious threats, the takedown of malware giants such as Emotet\n\n proves that even the most advanced malware families can be brought down. For the good guys, winning\n\n the fight against the ever-evolving ransomware is within reach.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix\n\n###### We have included a non-exhaustive reference set of the hashes for each of the major malware samples\n\n outlined in this research.\n\n JSWorm\n\n Detected by Trend Micro as variants of Ransom.Win32.JSWORM\n\n • 0dfebfe5dcb8e8cfe420b1de32f49b5509c3afc46c83b13a3f0969b7ccd37868\n\n • 0f0babba3778192eeaf9bb1e3084de192306bd5442f0caf02b705bd6736d35bf\n\n • 182d23eeb0cc9885bdc80c6c96da99947c5eff702389ce4ecee6fe0f5b497026\n\n • 1bf01b4fb827b2ce8fc04c952ad487d5a3606415fcf34447ed5d11207aad8a65\n\n • 1bf5a742be1c1319ed3646793efe6b909b80e077c5960ac3b1cebc9522498b77\n\n • 39786f7e6f59f0372c586e321f077c3c0930e0213b6223f1c9f037113e7a94d9\n\n • 3d076d5fdee68cee80e7f457216ed4af4eaab892b55335d776b5fc6309de24d1\n\n • 3d9cb812c0316691196aa2d6b2560a64c59a955228237f67cdb581d4bee9d396\n\n • 40753596e42b5d9114e00d959b96f76d3575f6624a85b4d4e68a4f1d2c037389\n\n • 46761b8b727f3002d1c73fa6c8568ebcf2ec0066666251f66dcda9d4268e03e8\n\n • 4895da9ff897cb955c66499a0b6bc4d540ee1ed633fa28b3b62457b24cc26ddd\n\n • 52389889be43b87d8b0aecc5fb74c84bd891eb3ce86731b081e51486378f58d2\n\n • 5e640325c3ca93e8c860dfc85e9aca670a4568a191ea617825b6caf484201ffc\n\n • 6e4b5f03370f782dbb46c1f4e24c4a55ef5bd57dbdadd8fb4c2d02253a038473\n\n • 78d70856b3f33814434e2d485f7bb1e99cf70de452271bb15be644b6b90d9205\n\n • 82bb0c287099b392e990a9f96b47e5d47373ef5e00255f4152d9d40fd309be78\n\n • a0a1fa5d66c4e3de1d7be24ca02cb0ca65721735d42a5b45572a0f40961251c5\n\n • c2febc4e0fd673a4e83bfa5f56382a6abb568a58c1f1d35678b1c9e4cf88da75\n\n • c8d9642156e7f0144e009013792f16a9a7258393c1d1798e8813f60fd3dcf8bf\n\n • d30f198cee2d81f876a756c85fbcac71389131b3c48ac639a48d2c1ac92ecac5\n\n • Db78787540d1352b498c7838d14aa9ef0abe52949f5713559e558712f6dc5706\n\n • db94b1740ead9c9b7e0e1362b16d42037ebd4bc53954b0cd3a30fb8d47275359\n\n • fee98e2efdfa296666859e6fb652fe753b994cc62cdfa67c7c650ca194169725\n\n • ff1e6435313860439c043cdb72084ca75b52e20d73faeef000b50b3dd57adf55\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Nemty\n\n Detected by Trend Micro as variants of Ransom.Win32.NEMTY\n\n • 1ac0c87c3ff27dc6d630cb3f543311fb48edfc88d33470836438b1d388ae9687\n\n • 3207b5da6ecf0d6ea787c5047c1e886c0ee6342a5d79e4bcb757e7e817caa889\n\n • 42e9356feb10e5814fb73c6c8d702f010d4bd742e25550ae91413fa2a7e7c888\n\n • 664b45ba61cf7e17012b22374c0c2a52a2e661e9c8c1c40982137c910095179a\n\n • 6e18acc14f36010c4c07f022e853d25692687186169e50929e402c2adf2cb897\n\n • 7fab9295f28e9a6e746420cdf39a37fe2ae3a1c668e2b3ae08c9de2de4c10024\n\n • 8e056ccffad1f5315a38abf14bcd3a7b662b440bda6a0291a648edcc1819eca6\n\n • 8e6f56fef6ef12a9a201cad3be2d0bca4962b2745f087da34eaa4af0bd09b75f\n\n • bf3368254c8e62f17e610273e53df6f29cccc9c679245f55f9ee7dc41343c384\n\n • c2a32b7094f4c171a56ca9da3005e7cc30489ae9d2020a6ccb53ff02b32e0be3\n\n Nefilim\n\n Detected by Trend Micro as variants of Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM, Trojan.Win64.NEFILIM, and Trojan.BAT.\n\n NEFILIM.\n\n|First Seen|Compiled|Certificate Thumbprint|Certificate For|Extension|Mutex|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|3-13-20 1:40 AM|3-10-20 11:06 PM|29239659231a88ca518839bf57048ff79a272554|Sectigo|.NEFILIM|Den’gi plyvut v karmany rekoy.
