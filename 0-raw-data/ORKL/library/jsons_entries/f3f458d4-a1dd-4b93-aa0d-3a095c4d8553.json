Wu\n\n[Banks](https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/bank-news)\nUpdated\n\nBy [Jim Finkle,](https://www.reuters.com/journalists/jim-finkle) [J.R. Wu](https://www.reuters.com/journalists/jr-wu)\n\n3 Min Read\n\nBOSTON/TAIPEI (Reuters) - The group that orchestrated the theft of over $2 million from\ncash machines at Taiwan’s First Commercial Bank in July was also behind an ATM hacking\nspree in more than a dozen European nations last year, according to cyber security firm\nGroup-IB.\n\nThe methods that the so-called Cobalt group used in Europe matched those used in Taiwan,\nGroup-IB said in its latest client report.\n\nThree Eastern European men were arrested in Taiwan in July on suspicion of collecting cash\nstolen from ATMs owned by First Commercial Bank, a unit of First Financial Holding Co Ltd.\n\nAttorneys for the three defendants in an ongoing trial in Taipei told Reuters their clients were\nnot familiar with Cobalt.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe men - identified in court documents as Peregudovs Andrejs of Latvia, Colibaba Mihail of\nRomania and Pencov Nicolae of Moldova - were among a total of 22 individuals, all foreign\nnationals, that Taiwanese authorities suspect of taking part in the theft, where most of the\nmoney was subsequently recovered.\n\nThe suspects used malware dubbed “ATM spitter” in the First Commercial Bank attacks, as\nwell as similar hacks in countries including Armenia, Belarus, Britain, Bulgaria, Estonia,\nGeorgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia and Spain,\nGroup-IB said in a report to its customers that Reuters reviewed on Thursday.\n\nGroup-IB first detailed the European spree in a report published in November, identifying the\nhackers as the Cobalt group.\n\nThe firm linked Cobalt to the Taiwan heist in its report last week.\n\nInvestigators in Taiwan told Reuters they were not aware of any links between Cobalt and\nthe hackers behind the First Commercial Bank heist.\n\n“What we can say is the people behind this hacking were very good,” a Taiwanese\ninvestigator familiar with the case told Reuters, on condition of anonymity because the\ninvestigator was not authorized to speak with media.\n\nThe defendants, who maintain their innocence, said in a court hearing on Wednesday that\nthey were not members of any international crime organization. Taipei prosecutors have said\nthey suspect First Commercial Bank’s network was breached at a London branch office.\n\nReporting by Jim Finkle in BOSTON and J.R.
