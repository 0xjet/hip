    "plain_text": "# Cobalt Group 2.0\n\n**blog.morphisec.com/cobalt-gang-2.0**\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Over the past year, Morphisec and several other endpoint protection companies have been](https://www.morphisec.com/products/advanced-endpoint-threat-protection)\ntracking a resurgence in activity from the Cobalt Group. Cobalt is one of the most notorious\ncybercrime operations, with attacks against more than 100 banks across 40 countries\nattributed to the group. The most recent attacks can be grouped into two types of campaigns.\nMany of the campaigns are based on the known and prevalent ThreadKit exploit kit\ngeneration framework. Other campaigns are more sophisticated, borrowing only some\nfunctionality from ThreadKit builder while incorporating additional advanced techniques from\nother sources.\n\nMorphisec Labs believes that the Cobalt Group split following the arrest of one of its top\nleaders in Spain in March of 2018. While Cobalt Gang 1.0 uses ThreadKit extensively, Cobalt\n2.0 adds sophistication to its delivery method, borrowing some of the network infrastructures\nused by both APT28 (aka Fancy Bear) and MuddyWater.\n\nOne of the Cobalt 2.0 Group’s latest campaigns, an attack that leads to a Cobalt Strike\n[beacon and to JavaScript backdoor, was investigated and presented by the Talos research](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/multiple-cobalt-personality-disorder.html)\nteam. Morphisec has investigated different samples from the same campaign. The following\nanalysis presents our findings, focusing on the additional sophistication patterns and\nattribution patterns.\n\n## Cobalt Group Technical Details\n\n### Stage 1 - Word Macro + Whitelisting Bypass\n\n\n-----\n\nAs with many other campaigns, the victim received a document with malicious macro visual\nbasic code.\n\nAlthough the code is heavily obfuscated, the entry point is easily identifiable. The VB code is\nexecuted starting from the Frame1_Layout function – this method is used much less\nfrequently than the obvious Document_Open or the AutoOpen.\n\nThe list of additional possible execution triggers is defined here:\n[https://www.greyhathacker.net/?p=948](https://www.greyhathacker.net/?p=948)\n\nThe macro is executing the legitimate Windows process cmstp.exe (connection manager\nProfile Installer). This technique was previously used by the MuddyWater group when\nattacking Middle East targets. The use of cmstp.exe whitelisting bypass was researched by\n[Oddvar Moe, where he showed how, by manipulating the inf file, cmstp can execute](https://oddvar.moe/2017/08/15/research-on-cmstp-exe/)\nscriptlets or executables.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn our case the attacker abused cmstp to execute JavaScript scriptlet (XML with JS) that is\ndownloaded from the e-dropbox[.]biz site. This way the group limited the exposure and the\ndelivery of the JavaScript to relevant targets only.\n\n### Stage 2 - JavaScript Dropper + Whitelisting Bypass\n\nThe JavaScript is well encoded with rc4 and some custom modifications:\n\n[The decrypted JavaScript has some similar functionality to the ThreadKit builder which is](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/unraveling-ThreadKit-new-document-exploit-builder-distribute-The-Trick-Formbook-Loki-Bot-malware)\nheavily used by the Cobalt Gang 1.0.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs can be seen from the deobfuscated code, the JavaScript yet again bypasses whitelisting\nby manipulation of regsvr32.exe, another legitimate Windows process. The two dropped\nartifacts – a payload DLL and a Word document – are written to the “Users\\<Log on User>\\”\nfolder (the document will replace the opened malicious document with clean stub after killing\nthe running Word process).\n\n### Stage 3 - PureBasic Legitimate Executable Mixed with Additional Malicious Functions\n\nThe dropped DLL is actually a PureBasic compiled code and a legitimate application. The\napplication is not signed (as many other PureBasic applications) and therefore easily\nmanipulated to execute inserted malicious code. In this case, the exported function\nDllRegisterServer wasn’t part of the legitimate application and is perfect for application flow\nredirection when executed by regsvr32.exe. Because PureBasic is a full programming\nlanguage that compiles to assembly and has endless possibilities and APIs to manipulate the\nmemory, it also complicates the generation of patterns by security vendors that base their\ndetection on static or dynamic pattern signatures. Although some security solutions will block\nall PureBasic programs (wrong move – there are plenty of legitimate PureBasic programs in\nuse today), it’s a smart move made by the attacker group.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo function properly, the malicious injected code needs to reflectively load and map to\nexisting core functions. The same code also applies anti-disassembly and anti-debugging\ntechniques. It gets the following functions from Kernel32 and Advapi32:\n\nThe code then uses the identified functions to add persistency through registry and add next\nstages file names identifier through the following locations:\n\nHKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript – next stage command (JavaScript\ndownloader executed through regsvr32) is registered under UserInitMprLogonScript.\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Notepad\\<$UserName$> - The code creates a new value\nunder Notepad Key with a pair representing randomly generated key pair. The right\nside of the pair is the name of the JavaScript in the next stage (stage 4), while the left\nside of the pair represents the file that will be downloaded as part of stage 5.\n\nSuch a combination of registry manipulation was reported a year ago as part of an attack\n[campaign executed by the Cobalt Group against Ukrainian banks.](https://cys-centrum.com/ru/news/activity_of_cobalt_summer_2017)\n\n\n-----\n\nAs part of the last execution step of the dll, the malicious code writes a JavaScript scriptlet\ninto the Roaming directory and then it executes CreateProcess on the regsvr32 as described\nby the UserInitMprLogonScript.\n\n### Stage 4 - JavaScript Downloader + Whitelisting Bypass\n\nHere, the scriptlet is automatically obfuscated in a way similar to the first scriptlet:\n\nAfter quick deobfuscation, we get to a clear JavaScript that is trying to download the next\nstage JavaScript backdoor using the same regsvr32. Note that the name for the JavaScript is\npart of the Notepad registry key that was written in a previous stage.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script also validates that no one changed the name of the executed file that was\nrandomly given during the previous stage. If the name of the executed JavaScript doesn’t\nmatch the name registered in the Notepad registry key, the script will not execute\n(researchers sometimes change the names of the files to execute the different stages\nseparately – this will not work in this case).\n\n\n-----\n\nThis decoded JavaScript downloader is almost identical to downloader previously seen\n[around one year ago - https://twitter.com/ItsReallyNick/status/914894320766943232.](https://twitter.com/ItsReallyNick/status/914894320766943232)\n\n### Stage 5 - JavaScript Backdoor\n\nThe last stage JavaScript is downloaded from hxxps://server.vestacp[.]kz/robots.txt.\n\nThe JavaScript is obfuscated the same way as in the previous stages. After deobfuscation,\n[we encounter a backdoor that was used in attacks against Russian speaking businesses in](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/backdoor-carrying-emails-set-sights-on-russian-speaking-businesses/)\nAugust 2017. This backdoor protocol of commands here is almost identical to the previously\ndescribed backdoor, aside from some name changes:\n\n\"d&exec\" – Download an executable or a dll (if it’s a dll, use regsvr32 to execute it)\n\"more_eggs\" – Downloads and replace the existing backdoor script with new script\n\"gtfo\" – Clean traces, remove persistency and stage 4,5 files\n\"more_onion\" – Execute the Backdoor script\n\"via_x\" – execute cmd / shell commands locally\n\nAs with every communication with the C2, the script collects and sends information about the\ntarget environment including the stack of security solutions installed on the computer and are\npart of the following list:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Artifacts\n\n[https://github.com/smgorelik/Meetups/blob/master/09272018_Meetup.7z](https://github.com/smgorelik/Meetups/blob/master/09272018_Meetup.7z)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs organizations improve their defenses, attackers find new ways to get around them. Threat\ngroups such as Cobalt are increasingly incorporating delivery techniques that allow them to\neasily bypass whitelisting and AppLocker policies, and we see more and more attacks using\nlegitimate processes to carry out their malicious intent.\n\nAlthough some of the decrypted artifacts have been seen in the wild since the beginning of\nthe year (or earlier), the attack is still very effective as many security solutions do not detect\nthe artifacts once they are obfuscated and encrypted. The need for a different approach to\nsecurity is greater than ever. Moving Target Defense, as defined by the DHS and\n\n\n-----\n\nimplemented by Morphisec, breaks the assumptions made by the attackers. Morphisec\nEndpoint Threat Prevention natively prevents the attack before it can perform any type of\nmalicious activity, no updates needed.\n\nOrganizations should expect to see much more coming from all Cobalt Group factions during\nthe next year.
