Note that my source IP has\nbeen edited for this diary to sanitize/disguise the actual IP address. See the\nimage below for DNS traffic representing a possible spam blocklist check by my\ninfected Windows host. In other malware families like Trickbot, the octet order is\nreversed. But order is not reversed for this Emotet infection.\n\n\nBrad\n\n433\nPosts\n\nISC\nHandler\nJan\n25th\n2022\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Possibly spam blocklist check by my Emotet-infected host on_\n_Tuesday 2022-01-24._\n\nAs seen in the above image, the following DNS queries were made:\n\n**_173.66.46.112spam.abuse.ch_**\n**_173.66.46.112.b.barracudacentral.org_**\n**_173.66.46.112.bl.mailspike.net_**\n**_173.66.46.112.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net_**\n**_173.66.46.112.zen.spamhaus.org_**\n\nAgain, I normally see the octet order reversed with other malware like Trickbot.\nThis reversed order also appeared during SMTP traffic with the command ELHO\n\n**_[112.46.66.173] as shown below._**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Victim IP address in Emotet spambot traffic on Tuesday 2022-_\n_01-24._\n\n[Twitter discussion for last week's diary indicates Emotet developers may have](https://twitter.com/netresec/status/1483705031564144642)\nbroken something in the spambot module to produce the previous 0.0.0.0\ntraffic. I'm not sure if this new traffic--the reversed order of the victim's IP\naddress--is intentional or not.\n\n**_Final words_**\n\nYou can find up-to-date indicators for Emotet malware samples, URLs, and C2\nIP addresses at:\n\n[https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/browse/tag/emotet/](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/emotet/)\n[https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/emotet/](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/emotet/)\n[https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/tag/Emotet/](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/tag/Emotet/)\n[https://threatfox.abuse.ch/browse/malware/win.emotet/](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/browse/malware/win.emotet/)\n\n--\nBrad Duncan\n\nbrad [at] malware-traffic-analysis.net\n\n\n-----",
