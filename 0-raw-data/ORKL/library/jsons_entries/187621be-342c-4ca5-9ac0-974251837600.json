    "plain_text": "# APT Attack In the Middle East: The Big Bang\n\n**[research.checkpoint.com/apt-attack-middle-east-big-bang/](https://research.checkpoint.com/apt-attack-middle-east-big-bang/)**\n\nJuly 8, 2018\n\nJuly 8, 2018\nOver the last few weeks, the Check Point Threat Intelligence Team discovered the comeback\nof an APT surveillance attack against institutions across the Middle East, specifically the\nPalestinian Authority.\n\nThe attack begins with a phishing email sent to targets that includes an attachment of a selfextracting archive containing two files: a Word document and a malicious executable. Posing\nto be from the Palestinian Political and National Guidance Commission, the Word document\nserves as a decoy, distracting victims while the malware is installed in the background.\n\nThe malware has several modules, some of which are:\n\nTaking a screenshot of the infected machine and sending it to the C&C server.\nSending a list of documents with file extensions including .doc, .odt, .xls, .ppt, .pdf and\nmore.\nLogging details about the system.\nRebooting the system.\nSelf-destructing the executable.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile it is not clear exactly what the attacker is looking for, what is clear is that once he finds\nit, a second stage of the attack awaits, fetching additional modules and/or malware from the\nCommand and Control server. This then is a surveillance attack in progress and has been\ndubbed ‘Big Bang’ due to the attacker’s fondness for the ‘Big Bang Theory’ TV show, after\nwhich some of the malware’s modules are named.\n\n[A previous campaign of this APT group was uncovered by Talos in June 2017, and since](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/palestine-delphi.html)\nthen very little of this operation was seen in the wild. The Big Bang campaign described\nbelow incorporates improved capabilities and offensive infrastructure, and seems to be even\nmore targeted.\n\n**What’s New in Ramallah?**\n\nThe first instances of the current campaign began to appear in the middle of April this year.\nBut, thanks to the attackers known affection for decoy documents that pose as news\nsummaries, we were able to date the campaign back to March 2018.\n\nThis campaign, as well as those in its previous form, uses phishing methods to deliver its\nreconnaissance stage malware. But unlike in 2017, this time the malicious attachment is an\nexecutable which is actually a self-extracting archive, containing a decoy document and the\nmalware itself. It is almost superfluous to mention that in order to give the file a legitimate\nlook, the developers pinned it to a Word icon and called it “اﻟﺘﻘﺮﯾﺮ اﻹﻋﻼﻣﻲ اﻟﺸﻬﺮي” (Monthly\nPress Report).\n\nWhen this file is double clicked, it opens a Word document with the logo of the Palestinian\nPolitical and National Guidance Commission. This document pretends to be a press report\nand contains news headlines that were actually copied from various Palestinian news\nwebsites.\n\nWhile the victim is distracted with the legitimate looking Word document, an additional\nexecutable which is archived alongside the decoy document is installed in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Screenshot of Word Document._**\n\nAlthough the archive was found on mid-April, the Word document shows that it was last\nedited on March 29, 2018. This date is also mentioned in the document’s body and used asth\nits title, “29-3.doc”. The metadata in the document shows that it was also titled “ﺳﯿﺎدة اﻟﻌﻘﯿﺪ /ﻋﺼﺎم\nأﺑﻮ ﻋﻮﻛﻞ”, which happens to be the name of the Guidance Commission Office’s Chief\nExecutive:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe naming convention and content of the file may indicate an attacker’s familiarity with the\nnature of the victim.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nWhile the analysis below discloses the capabilities of the spotted malware, we are pretty\nsure it is part of a multi-staged attack that targets very specific victims. The malware below is\npart of the reconnaissance stage and should lead to the main course, whose nature is still\nunknown.\n\nAs for the malware’s language, during the 2017 campaign the group used a fairly\nunsophisticated malware, dubbed “Micropsia”, written in C++ and wrapped in Delphi. In this\nyear’s campaign, the attackers use an upgraded variant of this malware, still written in C++\nbut wrapped as a self-extracting executable.\n\n**The Executable**\n\nThe executable contained in the archive is called “DriverInstallerU.exe” but its metadata\nshows that its original name is “Interenet Assistant.exe”.\n\nOnce it is executed, the malware ensures its persistence by setting a mutex\n(“InterenetAssistantN”), copying itself to the “ProgramData” directory, and adding itself to the\nscheduled tasks.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce secured, the malware communicates, by default, with a primary hardcoded command\nand control website that varies in different samples (spgbotup[.]club). The APT actors,\nhardcoded additional backup C&C website (lindamullins[.]info) that is contacted in case the\nmalware does not get a response from the first website. This is likely to be a mechanism that\nthe threat actors implemented in order to handle cases in which they would have to go\nthrough infrastructure changes.\n\n**Figure 3: Hardcoded 2 command and Control Websites.**\n\nOnce the sample is able to reach the main C&C, the first thing it does is fingerprint the\nsystem (user and PC names, OS version and AntiVirus engines), and exfiltrate the gathered\ninformation.\n\n**_Figure 4: Initial Beacon._**\n\nFollowing this, a POST request is sent to the C&C every once in a while\n(/api/serv/requests/[base64_fingerprint]), and in turn, the C&C sends back a configuration file\nthat turns on specific functionalities of the malware.\n\n**_Figure 5: C&C Commands_**\n\nWhat is interesting is that each key in this configuration file represents a different module in\nthe executable, and when the key is marked as true the executable will run the relevant\nmodule’s content. In addition, the names of those modules are taken from the popular\n\n\n-----\n\nsitcom, The\nBig Bang\nTheory’, in\naddition to\nactors’\nnames from\nthe popular\nTurkish TV series ‘Resurrection: Ertugrul’ (Celal Al, Sonmez and Gokhan).\n\nIn the configuration file we found thirteen keys for thirteen different modules. However, in our\nsamples we could find only five corresponding modules. This could mean that this campaign\nis evolving and that there will likely be more samples in the future that will implement the\nmissing parts.\n\nThe following table describes the role of each module:\n\n**Module Name** **Purpose**\n\nPenny Takes a screenshot of the infected machine and sends it to the server\n\nWolowitz_Helberg Enumerates running processes, saves their names and their IDs in\n“sat.txt” and sends the file to the server\n\nCelal_Al Sends a list of documents with certain extensions. The extensions\nare: doc, docx, odt, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, accdb, accde, mdb, pdf, csv\n\nRunfile Runs a file, receives a process name and a file type from the server\n\nNayyar_Sonmez Downloads a file with a ‘.txt’ extension from a given URL, changes the\nextension to ‘.exe’ and runs it\n\nKoothrappali Logs details about the system and sends them to the server\n\nBialik_Gokhan Reboots the system\n\nHofstadter Terminates a process by name\n\nParsons_Sheldon Deletes the payload from the startup folder and deletes the actual file\n\nReshad_Strik Sends a list of the partitions found on the infected machine\n\nPinar8 No such module in our sample\n\nMehmet7 No such module in our sample\n\nBahar6 No such module in our sample\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that unlike RATs that try to keylog the infected system and harvest\ncredentials, this sample shows the irregular behavior of looking for Microsoft Office\ndocuments on the victim’s machine, or enumerating partitions. In addition, the file has the\ncapability of downloading and running another executable\n\nAfter reviewing all the malware functionalities, we are confident in saying that the attackers\nlook for victims who answer well-defined characteristics and believe that further stages of the\nattack are delivered only to those who fit the specific victim profile.\n\n**The Attacker’s English Level**\n\nThe typo in the file’s name (Interenet Assistant) helped us find another executable with the\nsame name that is almost identical to the original one. In addition, using the communication\npattern we were able to find another sample called “DriverInstallerU”. In this sample,\nhowever, the module names were changed from actors and characters’ names to car\nmodels, namely “BMW_x1”, “BMW_x2” and up to “BMW_x8”.\n\nBut typos are not the only English mistakes of this APT group. Incorrect grammar phrases in\nthe C2 websites also assisted in uncovering the operation infrastructure.\n\nUnlike what is generally expected from a C&C, browsing the websites actually returns the\nfollowing response:\n\nWebsites related to this campaign use readymade bootstrap templates, but include unique\nand grammatically incorrect strings such as “Probably the most Music Site in the world!”,\n[and “[email protected][.]com” in some of the websites.](https://research.checkpoint.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#22414d4c56434156624c434f5b4e57445b790c7f414d4f)\n\n\n-----\n\nThose strings helped us find other websites that use the same template, and while they\ncould not be linked to specific malware samples, it is possible that they will be used in the\nfuture.\n\n**Looking Back**\n\nWhile the APT has gone through significant upgrades over the past year, the conductors of\nthese campaigns maintained evident fingerprints, both in the delivery methods and malware\ndevelopment conventions. These unique traces assisted us in correlating the current wave to\npast attacks, and may also have some resemblance to attacks related to the Gaza\nCybergang APT group.\n\nDuring our investigation we spotted three instances of the renewed operation, but unique\nartifacts in the command and control website revealed a wider infrastructure that may well\nmanage more unknown samples.\n\nIn addition, the concept of using self-extracting archives and decoy documents is not\ngroundbreaking or new, as we have seen similar attacks being carried in the past by the\nGaza Cybergang APT group.\n\nThere were, however, many similarities between the samples we found and the ones which\nwere found during the 2017 campaign, such as the usage of actor and character names from\nrenowned TV series, as well as fingerprinting the system and sending the information to the\nC&C. According to Talos, those files were distributed to victims in the Palestinian law\nenforcement agencies during 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, in 2017 the group used an executable wrapped in Delphi, whereas the sample we\nfound uses a self-extracting archive. Both of the above open a document as well as another\nexecutable (written in C++) when they are double clicked.\n\nFinally, the C&C communication has also been improved in the recent campaign, as backup\ndomains did not appear in the old ones. In addition, the newer malware strain has stronger\ncapabilities and a wider functionality than the older one, which would only send information\nabout the system version.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWith the experience gained from the APT attack that began in March 2017, it seems this\ncampaign has evolved into an attack with new capabilities, and an even more specific target,\nover a year later.\n\nAlthough the group behind it seems to be focused on carefully selecting their victims, using a\ncustom-made info-stealer for intelligence gathering operations, due to its very nature it is\ndifficult to assert what the ultimate goal of this campaign is. Indeed, the next stages of the\nattack may even still be in the works, not yet deployed or only deployed to selected few\nvictims.\n\nIn addition, although the clear fingerprints of the perpetrators leave no doubt we are\nwitnessing the comeback of the same APT, it is still not yet confirmed exactly who the threat\ngroup behind this campaign actually is. As no concrete attribution has yet been made, due to\nthe shared interests and malware features of both 2017 and 2018 campaigns, the Gaza\nCybergang may be a good starting point for further research.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\na210ac6ea0406d81fa5682e86997be25c73e9d1b\n\n994ebbe444183e0d67b13f91d75b0f9bcfb011db\n\n74ea60b4e269817168e107bdccc42b3a1193c1e6\n\n511bec782be41e85a013cbea95725d5807e3c2f2\n\n9e093a5b34c4e5dea59e374b409173565dc3b05b\n\nlindamullins[.]info\n\nspgbotup[.]club\n\nnamyyeatop[.]club\n\nnamybotter[.]info\n\n\n-----\n\nsanjynono[.]website\n\nexvsnomy[.]club\n\nezofiezo[.]website\n\nhitmesanjjoy[.]pro\n\n\n-----",
