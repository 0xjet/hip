The UK government has publicly attributed malign cyber activity to parts of three Russian Intelligence\nservices: the FSB, SVR and GRU, with each having their own remits.\n\nA table of the parts of the Russian Intelligence Services that the UK Government has publicly attributed is below.\n\n### RIS cyber organogram\n\n## The FSB cyber programme\n\nThe FSB (Federal Security Service; Russian: (Федеральная служба безопасности (ФСБ)) is Russia’s state security agency\nand the successor to the KGB. Since its formation in (1995 the FSB has conducted electronic surveillance of equipment.\n\n### FSB Centre 16\n\nFSB Centre 16 (16-й Центр) is responsible for cyber operations including the intercepting, decrypting and processing of\nelectronic messages, and the technical penetration of foreign targets. Its full title is the Centre for Radio-Electronic\nIntelligence by Means of Communication (TsRRSS; Russian: Центр радиоэлектронной разведки на средствах связи\n(ЦPPCC)) and is also known as “Military Unit 71330” (V/Ch 71330) (Bойсковая часть B/Ч 71330).\n\nWhen the KGB was disbanded in 1991, the 16th Directorate of the KGB became FAPSI (Russian: ՓАПϹИ) or Federal\nAgency of Government Communications and Information (FAGCI) (Russian :Փедеральное Агентство Правительственной\nϹвязи и Информации) a Russian government agency which was responsible for signals intelligence (SIGINT) and security\n\n\n-----\n\nof governmental communications.\n\nIn 2003, FAPSI was dissolved, and the 3rd Main Department of FAPSI (responsible for SIGINT) was transferred to the FSB\nforming the basis for FSB Centre 16.\n\nThe emblem of FSB Centre 16 hints at its activities in cyberspace: a satellite dish (signifying SIGINT activity) and a key,\nbroken by lightning, (signifying the breaking of an encryption key) are both present.\n\n## Cyber operations conducted by FSB Centre 16\n\nFSB Centre 16 has been observed conducting cyber operations since at least 2010. They conducted significant campaigns\nagainst the energy sector in 2014 and the aviation sector in 2020.\n\n## Cyber operations against worldwide critical national infrastructure\n\nCentre 16 of the FSB have targeted/gained unauthorised access systems in countries around the world that are necessary for\na country to function and upon which daily life depends. Known as Critical National Infrastructure or CNI, Centre 16 has\ntargeted systems essential for energy, healthcare, finance, education and local/national governments. This has been a\nconcerted campaign over many years and in a wide range of countries across Europe, the Americas and Asia.\n\nNCSC and cyber security companies have warned network defenders on multiple occasions of the risks posed by this pattern\nof activity. While there has been speculation of FSB involvement, the UK government is confirming this activity was carried\nout by FSB Centre 16 and providing further details of specific examples of this activity to increase awareness and\ntransparency around the threat.\n\n### Table 2: Cyber operations against CNI\n\n\n**Date** **Activity**\n\n\n**Description**\n**of targets** **Further information**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date** **Activity**\n\n\n**Description**\n**of targets** **Further information**\n\n\nJune to\nJuly 2013\n\n\nCompromised\nsoftware\npackage,\nturning the\nsoftware into\na Trojan, a\nlegitimate\nappearing\nprogramme\nthat contains\nmalware\n\n\nSymantec report:\nhttps://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/communityhome/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=7382dce7-0260-478284cc-890971ed3f17&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f44e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarvdocuments\n\nSymantec report:\nhttps://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/communityhome/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=7382dce7-0260-478284cc-890971ed3f17&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f44e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarvdocuments\n\nSymantec report: Dragonfly: Western energy sector targeted by sophisticated\nattack group https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threatintelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks.
