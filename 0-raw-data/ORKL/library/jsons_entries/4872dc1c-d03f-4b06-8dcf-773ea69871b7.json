The National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have all\nbegun publicly sharing tactical reporting containing technical details, indicators, and\ndefensive recommendations. These reports have become a staple of any major cyber\nincident because they provide an authoritative situational overview and an initial starting\npoint for collaboration.\n\nIn recent reports[1][2], attribution has been presented at the forefront of the report and used\nindustry cryptonyms along with military units or specific government entities. While this may\nbe intended to support broader usage (outside of technical consumers), attribution in these\nreports, without supporting analysis, is creating a dangerous precedent.\n\nTechnical analysis is fundamentally rooted in scientific methodology. When research is\npresented, a basic requirement is that it is sufficiently detailed to be validated by reproducing\nthe analysis. Within the aforenoted reports, attribution is presented as a statement of fact,\nsimilar in confidence to the reported dates or software versions, instead of as a confidencestructured assessment.\n\nIt may be possible the authors of these reports have a Palantír[3], allowing them to perfectly\nidentify the hostile authors, but without proper confidence language and presentation, these\nassessments are just as likely to have been made by a roll of the dice.\n\nIn future reports, providing context regarding how reported activity links to named sets will\nprovide critical information to existing understanding of these groups. In instances where\nproviding this information may risk sources and methods, limiting assessed attribution to a\n\n\n-----\n\nbroad geographic estimate or omitting it entirely may provide a better service.\n\n[1]\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2020/May/28/2002306626/-1/-1/0/CSA%20Sandworm%20Actors\n%20Exploiting%20Vulnerability%20in%20Exim%20Transfer%20Agent%2020200528.pdf\n\n[2] https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jul/16/2002457639/-1/-1/0/NCSC_APT29_ADVISORYQUAD-OFFICIAL-20200709-1810.PDF\n\n[3] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr)\n\n**Older**\nBackdooring a HID Reader\n\n\n-----",
