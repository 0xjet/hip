    "plain_text": "# Threat Update: Industroyer2\n\n**splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/threat-update-industroyer2.html**\n\nJune 23, 2022\n\nBy [Splunk Threat Research Team June 23, 2022](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/author/secmrkt-research.html)\n\nThe Splunk Threat Research Team (STRT) continues to monitor new relevant payloads to the ongoing\n[conflict in Eastern Europe. One of these new payloads was found by the Ukranian CERT named](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39518)\n[“Industroyer2.” The name of this new payload references the original \"Industroyer\" malicious payload](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0001)\nused against the country of Ukraine's power grid in 2016 and allegedly was able to affect a fifth of the\npower capacity of the city of Kyiv.\n\n\n-----\n\n[According to the recent Ukraine CERT and](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39518) [ESET report, Industroyer2 resembles the former Industroyer](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/04/12/industroyer2-industroyer-reloaded/)\nin functionality and is also targeting the electric grid containing commands targeting high-voltage\n[electrical substations. It was reported that Industroyer2 was also used along with CaddyWiper, another](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/threat-update-caddywiper.html)\npayload recently addressed by the Splunk Threat Research Team. This payload — in combination with\n[previous featured destructive payloads — targets CPEs. These customer premise devices such as](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/strt-ta03-cpe-destructive-software.html)\nmodems, cable modems, and internet gateways are devices that provide connectivity to the great\nmajority of commercial and residential customers, and speak to the attacker’s intention of overwhelming\nor degrading the victim's infrastructure.\n\nThe following is an analysis of relevant detection opportunities of this payload and observed TTPs\nduring the deployment of this payload.\n\n## Parameter Check\n\nThe first part of its code is checking parameters that can execute some of its features related to timing\nand logging. Below is the code screenshot of this checking with its 2 parameters.\n\nThe first parameter is “-t” which will trigger a waiting timer relative to the current minute of the system\ntime. For example, if your system time is 14:19:22 PM and you use this parameter with a value of 25 as\nthe third parameter, it means it will wait 5 mins before it executes its code like the screenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the -o parameter is a feature to redirect its console logs to a debug log file you inputted as the\n3rd parameter.\n\n## Console Logs\n\nUpon executing this malware, it outputs some console logs with a customized code structure that tells\nsomething about what features it executes. Some of it will be discussed further in the next\nsubheadings. Below is an example of the console logs during its execution.\n\n## Terminate Process and Rename Process File Path\n\nThis function enumerates all running processes in the targeted host and looks for the process named\n“PServiceControl.exe” and also the process name stated in its config data. It will also look for the file\npath of that process in a specific folder that is in the config file and rename it with “.MZ” file extension.\n\nThe code screenshot below shows the process termination and renaming of process file path. We can\nsee in the code snippet the code “RNM” plus the last error code after the call MoveFileA() function that\nwill be displayed in its console logs after executing this part of the code. You can see that in the console\nlog screenshot earlier.\n\n\n-----\n\n## HardCoded Configuration Data\n\nThis malware contains hardcoded configuration files that will be parsed with the help of\nCommandLineToArgvW() function and put in a structure that will be used later in its code. Below is the\nscreenshot of the parsing function.\n\nThe config data contains values and checks that this payload uses through its execution. We saw four\nmain components of its three configuration data settings that are hardcoded to its data section like the\nscreenshot below: The first component is the IP address of devices where it tries to communicate via\n\n\n-----\n\nIEC-104 protocol, the next one is the port number (2404), third is the process name\n(PService_PPD.exe) it tries to kill aside from “PServicecontrol.exe” and a file path (D:\\OIK\\DevCounter)\nwhere it locates the process file path it tries to kill to rename it with .MZ file extension.\n\n## Detections\n\nBelow are the detections related to the Industroyer2 malware and other components found during the\n[attack that was mentioned in the ESET blog and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/04/12/industroyer2-industroyer-reloaded/) [CERT-UA blog.](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39518)\n\n### Linux Adding Crontab Using List Parameter\n\nThis analytic identifies a suspicious cron jobs modification using crontab list parameters. This command\nline parameter can be abused by malware like Industroyer2, adversaries, and red teamers to add a\ncrontab entry to their malicious code to execute to the schedule they want.\n```\n| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime\nfrom datamodel=Endpoint.Processes\n\n where Processes.process_name = \"crontab\" Processes.process= \"* -l*\"\n\n by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process\nProcesses.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.dest Processes.user\n\n | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`\n\n | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n | security_content_ctime(lastTime) \n\n### Linux Deleting Critical Directory Using RM Command\n\n```\nThis analytic identifies a suspicious deletion of a critical folder in Linux machine using rm command.\nThis technique was seen in Industroyer2 campaign to wipe or destroy energy facilities of a targeted\nsector.\n```\n| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime\nfrom datamodel=Endpoint.Processes\n\n where Processes.process_name =rm AND Processes.process= \"* -rf *\" AND Processes.process IN\n(\"*/boot/*\", \"*/var/log/*\", \"*/etc/*\", \"*/dev/*\")\n\n by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process\nProcesses.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.dest\nProcesses.user\n\n | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`\n\n | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`\n\n\n### Linux Disable Services\n\n```\nThis analytic identifies events that attempt to disable a service.

A scheduled task was created to\nidentify suspicious tasks registered on Windows either via schtasks.exe OR TaskService with hidden\nsettings that are unique entry of malware like Industroyer2 or attack that uses lolbin to download other\nfiles or payload to the infected machine.\n```\n`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4698\n\n | xmlkv Message\n\n | search Hidden = true\n\n | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Task_Name, Command, Author,\nHidden, dest\n\n | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Windows Linked Policies In ADSI Discovery\n\nThis analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify the\n`[Adsisearcher]` type accelerator being used to query Active Directory for domain groups.\n```\n`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = \"*[adsisearcher]*\" ScriptBlockText =\n\"*objectcategory=organizationalunit*\" ScriptBlockText = \"*findAll()*\"\n\n | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText\nComputer user_id\n\n | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`\n\n\n### Windows Root Domain Linked Policies Discovery\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify the\n`[Adsisearcher]` type accelerator being used to query Active Directory for domain groups.
