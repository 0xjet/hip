This one-man show has nearly completely dissolved\nthough as one of the most prominent trends that emerged instead is the specialization of\ncybercriminals in different niches. If we take a typical attack, we’ll see that not necessarily\nevery cybercriminal will have the know-how to perform each stage involved in the attack:\n\nCode (code or acquire malware with the desired capabilities)\nSpread (infect targeted victims)\nExtract (maintain access to infected machines)\nMonetize (get profits from the attack)\n\nEach stage includes various malicious activities that different actors specialize in. As\n**ransomware operations have been growing and maturing, KELA’s researchers have**\n**been observing more cybercriminals offering accompanying services that fall into one**\n**of the four niches. When looking specifically into the ransomware supply chain we can**\n**see many actors piling up in the “extract” niche – where actors focus on escalating**\n**privileges within a compromised network – and the “monetize” niche – where actors**\n**are involved in the negotiation process with victims, DDoS attacks and spam calls. In**\nthis post, KELA focuses on these two niches in order to better understand the actors who\nhave surfaced around the growing RaaS ecosystem.\n\nSome of the major takeaways include:\n\n\n-----\n\nKELA assesses that domain admin access level of privileges eases ransomware\nattacks, therefore it is more valuable for cybercriminals. However, only 19% of listings\n**offer domain admin access rights, which raises demand for intrusion specialists**\n**capable of escalation of privileges.**\nUsing [DARKBEAST, KELA observed multiple posts describing a new role in the](https://ke-la.com/our-solutions/)\n**ransomware ecosystem – negotiators, whose purpose is to force the victim to**\n**pay a ransom using insider information and threats.**\nAs ransomware attackers have begun using additional methods to threaten\n**victims and their partners, such as DDoS attacks and spam calls, the need for**\n**such services also appeared. The ransomware ecosystem therefore more and more**\nresembles a corporation with diversified roles inside the company and multiple\noutsourcing activities.\nIn order to prevent the attacks and mitigate the risks of being attacked by such a skilled\nhacking community, enterprise defenders should continually monitor their key assets\nand their supply chain to mitigate their most relevant threats from the cybercrime\nunderground ecosystem before further damage occurs.\n\n_The figure above expresses how a ransom is split between ransomware developers and affiliates following_\n_an attack._\n\n\n-----\n\n_The figure above expresses how a ransom is split between multiple participants involved in a ransomware_\n_attack._\n\n## Escalation of Privileges\n\n[Following more than a year of monitoring Initial Access Brokers using KELA’s intelligence](https://ke-la.com/1-million-is-just-the-beginning-q4-2020-in-network-access-sales/)\ntechnologies, KELA’s researchers identified the influence that the obtained level of privileges\n(i.e. user or domain/local administrator rights) has on the price of access for sale. For\n[instance, in previous research, KELA observed threat actors raising their prices by 25-115%](https://ke-la.com/kelas-100-over-100-september2020-in-network-access-sales/)\nfollowing their success in escalating privileges up to the domain admin level.\n\nKELA’s analysis of network access listings publicly offered for sale in January-May 2021\nshows that average domain admin access cost at least 10 times more than access to a\n**machine with user rights. It seems to be a rarer type of offering: domain admin access**\n**was literally mentioned only in 19% of listings where initial access brokers specified**\n**the level of privileges. That would mean that the majority of offers pertain to lower**\nprivileged access, mostly user rights level.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Note: when we compared the listings, we included into the domain admin category only those listings_\n_where actors specifically mentioned it and not just the “admin” type_\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we see, the domain admin access is a more pricey and more valuable type of initial\naccess. Even the percentage of payment ransomware affiliates receive for their work can\ndepend on the level of privileges. For example, in one post, users were looking to work with\na ransomware affiliate program or affiliates who supply initial access. They specified: “In the\ncase when we started the process with user rights and encrypted the network after\nsuccessfully escalating it, our share [of the ransom – KELA] will be a little higher.”\n\n_Threat actors stating they want a higher fee for encrypting the network starting from an unprivileged user’s_\n_machine (auto translated by Google from Russian)_\n\nHowever, not all Initial Access Brokers and threat actors know how to gain such types of\nprivileges. This is where actors experienced with privilege escalation enter the stage. In\norder to understand their work, let’s refresh our memory on how the RaaS supply chain\nworks.\n\nHere is a possible scenario of a ransomware attack involving multiple participants: it starts\nfrom opportunistic attacks involving phishing attacks or mass exploitation of publicly known\nvulnerabilities. Such attacks can be performed by Initial Access Brokers themselves or\ndifferent actors then selling gained credentials on markets or directly to other cybercriminals.\nThese attacks enable threat actors to gain an entry point that they can transform into a wider\ncompromise and establish a sustainable entry channel for other cybercriminals – remote\naccess through RDP, VPN, and other methods. Once the entry channel is finalized, the\nbroker puts up the access for sale where it can be bought by ransomware affiliates who are\nthen proceeding to lateral movement and further malicious processes with the ultimate goal\nto plant ransomware. The question is: how do they move from user-privileged access to\n**a ransomware attack?**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Possible ransomware attack scenario illustrated by KELA._\n\nIf ransomware attackers start a lateral movement from a machine of domain admin, they\nhave better chances to successfully deploy ransomware in a compromised network.\nHowever, if all they have is user access, then they need to escalate privileges by themselves\n– or call for the help of skilled fellows.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Demand for cybercriminals able to escalate privileges (auto translated by Google from Russian)_\n\n**KELA located multiple posts seeking skilled intrusion specialists (“pentesters,” as**\n**Russian-speaking cybercriminals slangy name them) capable of gaining domain**\n**admin-privileged access. One of them mentions escalating privileges up to admin rights on**\n“bots from a botnet, European corporations,” which shows another role in the ransomware\nsupply chain that can be outsourced: botnet operators, which can supply the leads to initial\naccess brokers, intrusion specialists, and ransomware affiliates. The post reads: “This is\nteamwork, we pay a percentage of the profit. We are looking for one person to work out 2-3\nbots per day. Constant flow until the end of the year is guaranteed. A little about teamwork:\nwe already have specialists, you can count on fixed bonuses in USD and about 10% from\nthe financial profit.”\n\nThis means that these actors are looking for an intrusion specialist to escalate privileges on\nmachines from the corporate networks included in a botnet. Then, they would be able to use\nthe access for attacks, including ransomware. Since they mention a fixed fee and 10% share\nfrom the “financial profit”, it can mean such specialists will get a percentage of the ransom.\n\n**Based on several different offers, KELA assesses the intrusion specialists can be paid**\n**10-30% of the ransom for escalating privileges up to the domain user level.**\n\nUsers ready to escalate privileges often offer other services and perform other roles in the\nransomware ecosystem, namely as Initial Access Brokers or affiliates/affiliates’ partners. For\nexample, in a thread titled “Will escalate admin rights, will gain domain administrator,” an\nauthor offers to perform the whole ransomware encryption process: to bypass antivirus\nsolutions, steal data, delete backups and shadow copies and even encrypt a network. There\nare other users ready to do the whole job once they’re provided with initial access. Another\nexample shows an Initial Access Broker who usually sells VPN access listings – also ready\nto escalate privileges for a fee.\n\n_Intrusion specialists advertise their services, including escalation of privileges (auto translated by Google_\n_from Russian)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Initial access broker offers to “raise DA” for a fee in addition to his listings (auto translated by Google from_\n_Russian)_\n\nIt is important to understand not every actor that offers escalation of privileges may be willing\nto cooperate with ransomware affiliates. For example, one offer KELA discovered specifically\nmentions “we do not work with crypto lockers,” meaning ransomware. These threat actors\nstated they focus on working with payment processing systems and using credit card data to\ngain profits. It illustrates the variety of monetization methods employed by cybercriminals;\nwhile now all eyes are on ransomware, it is crucial to remember defending against other\nthreats.\n\n_A team claiming, they can escalate privileges, among other services, but they do not work with_\n_ransomware developers and affiliates (auto-translated by Google from Russian)_\n\n## Negotiators\n\nA brand-new position seems to appear in the RaaS landscape: negotiators. Initially, most\nransomware operators communicated with victims via email which was mentioned in ransom\nnotes. As RaaS grew and became more prominent and business-like, many actors started\nestablishing their own portals through which all communications were held. The ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\ndevelopers or affiliates were determining the ransom sum, offering discounts, and discussing\nconditions of payment. However, now this part of the attack also seems to be an outsourced\nactivity – at least for some affiliates and/or developers.\nWhy do ransomware gangs need negotiators? Two hypotheses seem valid:\n\n**Victims started using negotiators – while a few years ago there was no such**\n**[profession, now there is a demand for negotiating services. Ransomware-](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/07/how-to-negotiate-with-ransomware-hackers)**\nnegotiation specialists partner with the insurance companies and have no lack of\nclients. Ransom actors had to up their game as well in order to make good\n**margins.**\n**As most ransom actors probably are not native English speakers, more delicate**\n**negotiations – specifically around very high budgets and surrounding complex**\n**business situations – required better English. When REvil’s representative was**\nlooking for a “support” member of the team to hold negotiations, they specifically\nmentioned “conversational English” as one of the demands. This is not a new case:\nactors are interested in native English speakers to use for spear-phishing campaigns.\n\n_REvil hires “support [manager] with conversational English” to negotiate with victims, speak with media_\n_outlets, recovery and information security companies._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Avaddon describes its administration panel to potential affiliates, mentioning “a chat for communication.”_\n\n_ProLock ransomware gang negotiating with a victim._\n\n**KELA noticed several threads on Russian-speaking underground forums where actors**\n**were looking for negotiators or discussing their work. In March 2021, a threat actor**\nstated they have access to a large company, most likely in Saudi Arabia, and need a\nnegotiator to contact top managers of several companies. The actor specified they look for\n\n\n-----\n\nan insider or someone with well-established contacts among recovery and cybersecurity\ncompanies in Saudi Arabia.” In the case of the ransom successfully received, the actor\npromised to pay 1-5 million USD to the negotiator. Several actors responded to the offer.\n\n_The actor looks for negotiators to receive ransom from a Saudi Arabian company (auto-translated by_\n_Google from Russian)_\n\nThe work process of such negotiators can be inferred from a dispute between the Conti and\nREvil (Sodinokibi) operators from one side and a negotiators’ team they worked with – from\nanother. This is how Conti’s representative described the collaboration confirming that the\nservice was quite new for the affiliates: “We got interested. When we asked him how it works,\nwe said that when there will be a suitable material [a victim network – KELA], we will offer it\nto outsourcers [negotiators, among others – KELA].”\n\n[The dispute began after an attack on Broward County Public Schools, in which Conti](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/broward-files-leaked-ransomware/#:~:text=Broward%20County%20Public%20Schools%20was,bn%20budget%20over%20to%20them.)\ndemanded a 40 million USD ransom. It turns out, the negotiations were held both by Conti’s\naffiliates and side negotiators who didn’t manage to collaborate properly. The negotiators\nclaimed they managed to gain insider information that could force the victim to pay the\nransom. However, according to the negotiators, the affiliates meddled in the process and\nruined their efforts. Conti’s representative argued the negotiators didn’t behave\nprofessionally. REvil’s representative also shared his experience of working with the same\nnegotiators’ team, accusing them of scamming.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Conti ransomware attackers communicate with Broward County Public Schools. Source: Hackread.com_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Representatives of REvil and negotiators team accuse one another of scamming (auto-translated by_\n_Google from Russian)_\n\nThe actors and the forums’ administration didn’t come to a conclusion about who was a\nscammer in these cases. However, it illustrates the demand and supply for negotiating\nservices. While the dispute was held on the Russian-speaking cybercrime forum\n**Exploit, users from another forum XSS got interested and asked for the negotiators’**\n**contacts. The REvil gang, as mentioned above, was also looking to fill a negotiator**\n**position, promising a monthly salary of 3,500-30,000 USD (a fixed fee plus “tips”).**\n\n**KELA’s findings show that for such services negotiators ask for 10-20% of the**\n**ransom.**\n\n_A threat actor looking for the aforementioned negotiators’ team on a different forum (auto-translated by_\n_Google from Russian)_\n\n## DDoS and Spam Services\n\n\n-----\n\nBesides the cybercriminals directly involved in the ransomware supply chain, ransomware\noperators and affiliates use other services that primarily help them to intimidate victims. For\nexample, DDoS attacks became a common way for ransomware operators to force\n**victims to pay the ransom. In order to perform the actual attacks, REvil was observed**\n**seeking to hire a team or a person with a botnet that could DDoS a targeted company**\n**and its clients as an additional measure. The REvil representative stated: “Estimate your**\npotential – we can ask to shut down even Microsoft for a couple of days.”\nAnother method of intimidating victims into paying is through spam calls and SMS\ncampaigns to a victim company, its clients and partners, or to media outlets. These activities\nmay be carried out by the ransomware operators or, as with other auxiliary operations,\noutsourced to other actors who specialize in them. As a showcase of the variety of pressure\nmeans used by ransom actors, KELA observed Avaddon ransomware operators looking\n**for fax spam services – which can be used both for spamming the victim with threats**\n**and as** **[the ransomware delivery vector in certain cases.](https://www.paubox.com/blog/faxploit-fax-machine-hack-malware/)**\nIn addition, just like corporate enterprises, ransomware operators have design and coding\nrequirements. Since they need it for malicious purposes, they also look for such services on\ncybercrime forums.\n\n_REvil advertises DDoS and spam services’ availability for their affiliates; Avaddon looks for someone to_\n_carry out spam fax._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDuring recent years, ransomware gangs grew into cybercrime corporations with members or\n“employees” specializing in different parts of ransomware attacks and various accompanying\nservices. The recent ban of ransomware on two major Russian-speaking forums does not\nseem to affect this ecosystem, because only the advertisement of affiliate programs was\nbanned on the forums. Ransomware operators and affiliates still remain active participants in\ncybercrime discussions, they can hire others, buy their services and offers. Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\noperations attract cybercriminals by being a fast way to make profits – not only for\nransomware developers and affiliates but for everyone involved in their activities with millions\nof USD in ransom.\nConfronting such groups require enterprise defenders to invest in:\n**1. Cybersecurity awareness and training for all key stakeholders and employees to**\nensure that key individuals know how to safely use their credentials and personal information\nonline. This cyber training should include specifying how to identify suspicious activities,\nsuch as possible scam emails, or unusual requests from unauthorized individuals or email\naddresses.\n**2. Regular vulnerability monitoring and patching to continually protect their entire**\nnetwork infrastructure and prevent any unauthorized access by Initial Access Brokers or\nother network intruders.\n**3. Targeted and automated monitoring of key assets to immediately detect threats**\nemerging from the cybercrime underground ecosystem. Constant automated and scalable\nmonitoring of an organizations’ assets could significantly improve maintaining a reduced\nattack surface, ultimately helping organizations thwart possible attempts of cyberattacks\nagainst them.\n\n\n-----",
