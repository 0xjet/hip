The most recent activity included targeting email servers\nbelonging to diplomatic entities located in South America and Northern Africa. APT29 is a\nthreat actor commonly associated with a national intelligence service and has been widely\nreported to conduct espionage operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n[We initiated this research after RiskIQ reported their own research of command and control](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/external-threat-management/apt29-bear-tracks/)\nservers of the [WellMess malware, operated by APT29. We discovered that some of the](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2018/07/malware-wellmes-9b78.html)\nreported WellMess command and control servers (C2s) are used as layer 2 (L2) operator\nhosts (OH), while there’s also a layer 1 (L1) OH in contact with the victim’s email server. The\ntargeted email servers are running open-source webmail clients that have a history of\nvulnerabilities. Recent reporting by the National Cyber Security Center of the UK on APT29\nactivity confirms APT29 operating procedure includes exploiting recently detected software\n[vulnerabilities (as described in Further TTPs associated with SVR cyber actors, and](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf) APT29\ntargets COVID-19 vaccine development).\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, communication within the infrastructure is cyclical. This indicates an\nautomated framework that regularly communicates with, and possibly exfiltrates data from,\nthe victim’s email servers. This behavior includes what appears to be the actor, connecting to\nL2 OH over port TCP/8443 with anonymization through TOR at 8 PM UTC. This indicates\nthat the actor likely included a Layer 3 host in the automated infrastructure setup. The\nobserved infrastructure setup confirms APT29’s ability to perform long-term automated\noperations. Such infrastructure provides APT29 with the ability to continuously acquire\nsensitive data from the targeted environment, highlighting the espionage focus of the group.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe recommend searching for and investigate any traffic from the listed layer 1 operator\nhosts.\n\nThis analysis isn’t meant to be a complete exploration of the APT29 infrastructure but is\nrepresentative of our ongoing analysis. The analysis performed in this report includes only a\nsubset of the APT29 related IPs reported by RiskIQ, and the reader shouldn’t necessarily\nassume these conclusions hold for the entire infrastructure.\n\n### How our visibility and actions help our clients\n\nOur Threat Intelligence researchers monitor telemetry of suspicious traffic traversing our\nGlobal IP Network Service global Tier-1 IPv4/IPv6 backbone network for threat indicators.\n[Correlating such findings with the insights of our global Threat Detection (TD) and](https://services.global.ntt/en-us/services-and-products/security/managed-security-services/threat-detection) Managed\nDetection and Response (MDR) services enables a truly unique perspective of the evolving\ncybersecurity threat landscape.\n\nResearch findings on threat actors and campaigns, such as APT29, are continuously being\nfed from our Threat Intelligence analysts back into our services as machine learning\ncapabilities, behavior models, indicators of compromise and threat intelligence. This process\nenhances the service’s ability to efficiently monitor, detect, triage and respond to these\nthreats on behalf of our clients often without an initial compromise.\n\n### Indicators of compromise\n\nIndicators of compromise where the L1 OH is sending traffic to the L2 OH on the same row:\n\n\n-----",
